*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* understand continuing mandate masks everyone opportunity vaccinated. yeah that, say go it. I've pro social distancing masking throughout this, me, expires everyone (not high risk folks, everyone) chance get jabbed idiot decline.

Maybe I'll see Cedar Point! need SteVe, Millennium Force, Maverick fixes. isn’t gonna mask mandates concerts states. Take state (Tennessee) example. can’t even get people wear masks now. People won’t tolerate permanent mask mandates pro mask come. LAN parties I'm saying 46% immunity great explanation drop amount cases.

Right, I'm saying not, despite apparent correlation, herd immunity work way. virus needs X number people available keep spreading, long X people available, keep spreading, accelerating finds pools people infect, spreading slowly mostly immune people exposed.

Imagine one cruise ships originally infected.. 1000 people it, 500 vaccinated think would difference many eventually infected, fast would infected?

The former number easy guess - 500 people would eventually infected. amount time would take, however, depend number immune people... rather, depends many non immune people sharing air, often, close quarters other, etc.

Your hypothesis would correct immune people distributed way 100% random whether non immune people exposed virus.

But, people live randomly. b117: Hold beer I'm guessing behavior based fact numbers seem go arbitrarily cases. states surges lulls despite behavior changing restriction restriction implemented. Behavior plays role, whole pictures. media wants paint whole picture influence people's behavior, bad thing. agree much know. numbers next months interesting. Good. US better hurry vaccinate then. Pushback getting stronger patience run out. 10 years. remember checking county website daily dread would first reported case city. Pfizer previously laboratory testing using full array mutations found SA variant. used serum received one dose vaccine. two distinct studies Eh part makes laugh get triggered wear masks themselves, people wearing masks. people wearing masks deprives social interaction demand everyone around them. Novavax probably get approved Summer heard... hope moves faster. Inferior alveolar moderna shots infrastructure need make mRNA based vaccines different need make adenovirus based vaccine. Plus, storage requirements mRNA vaccines still big hurdle distribution lot areas.  ""The temp check said body temperature 94°, can't possibly COVID."" game changer regardless smoothbrains r/coronavirus think (hurr durr 95% vs 72% durr).

This vaccine prevents hospitalizations death logistically easier administer large populations. big step towards normalcy. essential worker, vaccinate elderly us. FAR higher risk.  don’t think it’s bad thing schools offer virtual learning families like it. know it’s anomaly daughter (13) really well format. Turns out, take away social game middle school, let work pace comfort home, really shines. Yeah, think it’s possible another surge like one had? I? /r/oddlyspecific . That's number seconds 10 days case anyone wondering. Wisconsin approves idea. Incorrect.

Pfizer previously laboratory testing using full array mutations SA variant used serum people got one dose vaccine.

These two distinct studies Obviously positive trend going here. However, wonder one factors harder get testing. know LA Dodger stadium converted testing site vaccination site. largest testing site LA, wonder could reason fewer cases reported. variant spreads faster, mutations evade vaccine. likely going cause bit bump, full scale wave assuming vaccinations ramp expected. Sweden going full florida man. Yeah yeah yeah but...what SA variant? violence Innsbruck Vienna.
Also can't really sports, except jogging skiing. Team sports gyms restricted. 
Young people general fed up, even doctors nurses (I young doctor myself). Especially those, (like me) already still face severe restrictions, despite immunity. Also work endlessly without extras, many people short labour getting tons financial support year now! Half staff intensive care ward quit job already.

I say risk, Caucasian people 30 less dangerous many Influenza strains. older obese people however much worse. Also Asians degree Africans seem worse outcome.
So course joke young people either, know many young people serious symptoms. many common viridae, like Coxsackie too.

So long going continue like this? enough vaccines next months seem work new variants.
So majority population wants keep staying lockdown, ok.... money printing working..hyperinflation never helped anyone Mask wearing already much prevalent Asian countries pre-SARS. UK variant already know minimal vaccine escape. Brazil South Africa variants concerning ones. comment pretty scummy. Way skirt around getting banned directly saying glad happened. Good thing opened schools up, theatres, restaurants. Gotta stay number one America. matter cost. Fucking shit can't believe this. Fuck. (the famous R number) apparently lower, containing U.K. variant eliminate SA variant. 

That's great news! link source that? Took year get herniated disc fixed one believed limbs becoming numb one female doctor even said “this isnt face pain” explained walk 15 min I’m extreme agony. also work couch lying feel pain. 

The system 100% biased me. went working every day moving one believed me. 100% believe UK variant's increased transmissibility somewhere 10 25 percent rest spike blamed ineffective sometimes harmful public policy decisions, spurring need increased transmissibility scapegoat. far I’m aware Pfizer already tested vaccine lab using real SA variant found effective.

Not correct. talking paper weeks ago nothing pre-print paper Pfizer issued press release on. US better hurry vaccinate then. Pushback getting stronger patience run out.  varies widely different countries Asia. Right totally simple. Get job wrong company? want people die therefore die It’s another vitro study looking antibody neutralization (and aren’t even testing actual variants...just isolated mutations). haven’t actually tested efficacy people. question all. me, answer unambiguously no. drawback -- get shot back jaw..... hospitalizations US declining month. IHME predicts continue decline June:   hospitalizations also declining UK South Africa.  see variants major problem US.

In individual states, like CA NY, predict another spike deaths March/April. would guess we'll see another round spring lockdowns over. Well, I'm big fan vaccine big lose IMO, frustrated told last year vaccines would made risk never actually happened. much higher fraction covid cases undiagnosed covid deaths undiagnosed. people severe enough symptoms end dying it, likely seek medical attention, would involve getting tested. undiagoned cases mild. yep. even doctors it. deal something similar, assume someone lazy tough. myself, thought Aunt something similar ""push it."" Til understand nothing effort. get sides now, definitely frustrating Newsom lost made school reopening 25/100,000 cases, 7/100,000 cases.... He’s petty dictator whos means didn’t help people all. Ron Desantis better job tbh Maybe enough mRNA vaccines go around. right elderly need far more, can't help feel selfish them. choking playoffs. Cuomo want expand got yelled it, expand got yelled expanding many people. He's following CDC guidelines made clear he's going treat part phase important another, either expand 1B expand nobody. Everything comment sucks. comment well true. Yeah, saw retail price kid’s prescription nebby first time filled nearly fainted. Thankfully, semi-decent insurance time, much cheaper yours. new insurance sucks, I’m excited first fill new plan. lot known SA variant. UK variant transmissible, SA variant become dominant. basic evolutionary pressure. like youd things go states. Except lab testing done full mutant... even include mutations RBD, let alone full spike protein. NYS using almost vaccine allotment recent weeks since eligibility expanded. expanded eligibility time coinciding hospitals told ""you one week vaccinate people doses specifically set aside guys become fair game anyone"" state going more. Stonksn’t First thought... ""They crated win election"" - Conspiracy nuts Pandemrix

Only caused higher rates narcolepsy nordic countries. even risk lower influenza I'm pretty sure

Dengvaxia live vaccine course risk causing disease. Uk variant Maybe unpopular opinion including political affiliation obviously trying drum pretty negative sentiment towards deceased. really care much say ""told so!"" dead guys' family? dont know anything Ron Wright pretty confident role Republicans stance covid protocols minimal none Different states' populations different behavior. know everything pandemic years, I'd guess different behavior.

The scary fact we're still dealing novel (new species) virus, one really knows behavior, human behavior affects affected it, even animals like pets transmit it.

If want get degree molecular biology, epidemiology, related field, plenty material thesis work decades come. things deserve never get keep listening health experts. Get two shots get hugs, you’ve earned them. Don’t wait permission. theory, no. subcutaneous shots insulin pretty different intramuscular vaccines. reality, probably. 

I’m iddm myself. daughter giver shots now, y’all gotten pump? Im med student learned give vaccines last month give COVID shots. shots given MAs RNs. Peds intentional MDs wanted avoid kids fearing them. adult medicine there's enough time MD drop everything give shot literally anyone do. way easier closing surgical ports starting lines do. don’t blame people science background understand airborne transmission works. needs explained like 5. hasn’t been. driving huge drop cases? It’s something I’ve trying figure company hired J&amp;J make vaccines, contractors around world. Maybe case waiting close approved place making even more. really low standard “good situation” Mind yours. Make masks optional. 180 days = 180,879,360 (unabated).

190 days = population US (unabated). I’ve seen fuzzy masks romwe! High risk how? amount activity seeming effect news I’d expect SCID something. Humans social species mask barrier social interaction.

Last spring wear mask pandemic (wasn't really socially acceptable), never really liked handshakes, I've always tried stay away people, I've always kindof germaphobe washed hands constantly kept sanitizer ready, sound hipster, whole health precaution thing long covid made cool, yeah, plan stay way long covid forgotten (if we're ever lucky) looks like likely hit 50 million total vaccinations US week, remember took 10 days get 1 million vaccinated, 1.5 million per day average, done million days... phone ""stress tracker""/fitness tracker, may built-in pulse oximeter. Galaxy S8 it. would help patients? vaccine doesn’t prevent passing people. told otherwise? Me. There's comment made /r/covid19 back March/April saying I'd volunteer get contribute herd immunity since pretty ideal situation quarantine, got pretty upvoted. think afraid first started hearing it, looked raw data studies, known even age stratified disease. I'm 30F pretty fit overall. also assumed would get since normal times, take public transit work. Obviously changed WFH. 

I distinctly remember zoom chats friends March/April. third panicked another third attitude ""I'll get eventually, mind getting with."" changed lot time, social death sentence get covid. None groups gotten it, btw. 

Idk, I've never afraid *for myself*. Yes, even long term damage hot button topic. I've witnessed friends family get weird long haul symptoms sicknesses, didnt strike odd covid would instances that. However, risk folks life *am* afraid getting covid - hopefully get vaccinated month!

I've also lot time think death/life means year. I'm really afraid death. I'm afraid lying deathbed regret though. want make life. know much better most, damn tough year kind outlook. Definitely feel like I'm failing life sometimes :/

This got long lol think chances pandemic level restrictions staying place duration summer way pretty unlikely think that’s mean ending pandemic 

Covid still around, doubt coachella happen I’m pretty sure you’ll able throw party mean that’s scientists try time. It’s IFR is. thought lack vaccines lack people give them. Trains great need anywhere soon. Nope, doctors definitely prescribed NY area, rumored help way back March. Unfortunately, one sister's coworkers stole inhaler purse, double unfortunate severe asthma needs without respiratory virus making rounds. Worse off, get inhaler refilled right away demand. sister ended sending one midwest. everyone understands. They’ve taught since toddlers germs spread touching things. Idk rest country testing im gone wayyy down. Like unless u going ER u gonna get test. Pure speculation. Worthless article. fuck asking people wear mask occasionally martial law? Fucking pro histrionics you. Immunity lasts months. years. know paying people antibodies wear off. second round infections emerging now. already understood likely outset since coronaviruses offer short term immunity. say whenever see pictures, shows opposite. Closing gyms certainly helped right? Expect April/May time frame supply outstrip demand.

I sure hope so. Fast approaching mid February state county still anywhere close finishing 75+/front line workers. think we’ve known time. VACCINES Knew reading treatments, know dental use. feel way work covid daily basis (covid scientist) I’ve scares reality hit. try let get much go work housemate likely positive, it’s bit hard. one knows they’ll cope they’ve got confirm. also done got wisdom teeth out. Never squirrel cheeks done.

Unfortunately, vague memory waking mid-procedure mouthful metal making pathetic screaming noise going back under.  VACCINES. course hospitalizations? Less people sick = less people testing. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

He’s saying makes difference. It’s piece cloth. I’m anti mask things way now. things relatively normal won’t wear one. I’m sure many others, “not wearing mask” symbolizes life was/is meant be. Sharing smiles, goofy faces, reading lips, things despite simple, important social situations. Wearing mask forever means taken away share similar moments closed bubble people.

If jump here...

Your argument certainly sound, problem context. we're talking things like specific office school open dollars allocated towards construction, renovation, cleaning/maintenance, certainly priority *by far* air. think anyone denying that.

Now infected person coughs hands, shakes mine, wipe eyes, nose, mouth without first washing them, taking risk? infected kid spit shines apple handing go ahead eat it, taking risk?

When asking commenter post sources, think that's valid debate, stop washing things using hand sanitizer pump gas, I'd like see data showing Covid transmitted via fomites, ""rare"", ""less likely"", ""reduced risk"", etc...

Oh, I'd also like see data showing mutation Covid could result increased transmission capability fomites. think that's possible.

FTFA:

*But threat unbelievably stupid behavior mass level shouldn’t warrant multibillion-dollar war fomites.*

If last years, especially 2020, taught us anything, stupid behavior mass level never underestimated. that. also coming telling countries stop cycling PCR tests 40 instead go back 30-35, huge decrease false positives sadly still counted/impossible track. also therapeutics progression keeps people hospitals. spouse wife receiving fertility treatments, pro giving intramuscular injections (progesterone).

Same regularly give hormone, steroid, vitamin, etc., injections others.

It really difficult. getting downvoted one main page threads saying less 0.21% population getting reinfected big deal

NYC obviously giving 110%! thought US basically business usual, hand sanitiser stations signs telling social distance?

Yes no.

A lot professional class people still Zooming work. Many (some, anyway) teachers still teaching remotely home even students reporting physical schools (in often hybrid teaching environment). think indoor dining still closed NYC many places, I've lost track that. Clearly everything open Florida.

But everywhere, people psychologically done all.

So mean social distancing Americans ever going nation assholes. Vaccinations crawl. People wear masks noses, attend house parties politicians hell bent opening economy everyone gets vaccinated. I'm pretty sure CDC's ""best estimate"" IFR around 0.6% since last summer. People know tested positive get treatment, even vitamin, send home isolate. get sick enough get hospital, treat you, 'early' treatment USA (some countries using ivermectin USA) got first dose phfizer thought going die, I’d explain flu hangover time. headache relentless nothing worked pain, day three snap fingers gone. looking forward 2nd dose hope isn’t severe I've answered accusation unpopular comments thread another. Nobody, included, demanding American willingly take risk. Outside Empire sort 'demand' would recognized - grand example lack morality. USA surfeit propaganda says selfishness quite OK many ways. attitude common USA Americans tend suspect others idea mind. like leap cough 'argument' agendas subtexts wshen someone else merely presenting facts, facts like. strange thing American mentality universal, common. 

If care bother search recent history posted WHO's COVAX program aims protect everyone - whether blind **fact** thing necessary protection well whether not. USA repent recent years deadbeat send MONEY VACCINES. COVAX program require single vial shipped Burkino Faso anywhere else. 

The inapplicable 'argument hypocrisy' trying use case ridiculously mark, is, course, grand example collective responsibility erased daily consideration Americans constant propaganda promoting distorted 'individualism'. 

That 'individualism' characteristic overabundance *spite*. Americans obsessed constant comparison situation others, overly willing hurt order hurt others consider 'undeserving'. Often 'undeserving' mutates fantasy good things happen others actually brought taking good things - *no matter false even ridiculous reality*. resentment becomes way life even unthinking reflex - cerebral cortex required. 

Sooooo.... care find much cooler heads, heads much knowledgeable am, actually proposing working see links COVAX. prefer live slogans emotional spite - well carry on. One possibility would patients infected coronavirus many weeks ago

As far know retirement homes test people workers weekly. Maybe one course.

Don't get wrong, negative it, important understand people still get virus even vaccine, even health remains untouched. want get vaccinated rethink position. Sorry hasn’t paid attention days. check bit worried Israel seem great initial results, maybe things changed quickly. 

Normally pay attention stock market, hasn’t cratered recently. Israel showing proof vaccines won’t working, I’d imagine really bad days Wall Street.

Get fuck it. Thank you! ask decided it? always wondered would offered! case testing positive twice, first time either got little virus beat quickly, never ended developing antibodies second time symptomatic. possibly, asymptomatic twice opening possible third time testing positive? case low viral load non issue body produce anti bodies.

I expect things open find kids testing positive quite often no. Kids vectors colds such. guess that’s question — health authorities pushing this? NBC news interviewed pharmacist UC Irvine article linked — January, heard via Yale immunologist NSAIDs fine re: COVID vaccines (“suppressing fevers muscle aches doesn’t anything immune memory formation far know”) glucocorticoids definitely avoided.

full disclosure — got vaccine doses, nobody mentioned avoiding NSAIDs either time, took Advil booster shot. don’t want anybody unnecessarily endure physical discomfort fear altering immune response post-vaccine don’t good evidence caution OTC drugs everybody access Maybe require everyone dress Mandalorians still go on. way everyone keep masks on.  correct. Drives crazy people make confident statements topics absolutely clueless about. It’s infuriating, bullshit, misleading, click-bait headline using “emerging strains” Cool hobby bro far know, Dutch government bit optimistic though, already counting CureVac vaccines April, still counting Sanofi deliver. regardless, vaccine future looking lot brighter now. evidence outdoor exercise meaningful effect spread? Private parties actual problem, naturally increasing popularity 3 months lockdown. I'm going go full conspiracy J&amp;J include mild. moderate-severe efficacy line published firms. Nothing J&amp;J history actions raise suspicion alternative motives. trial makes sense, sample size big enough, they're presenting straightforward case vaccine. that's number I'm comfortable accepting new evidence data suggests otherwise. 

I'm sure SA boat came conclusion. J&amp;J's vaccine data presented acceptable outcome (~57% preventing moderate-severe). AZ's likely ineffective, even given best benefit doubt unlikely better. clearest conclusion drawn AZ data inconclusive. 

When data inconclusive, can't cherry pick parts like (100% preventing severe) throw away parts (10% efficacy symptoms). err side inconclusive, hospitalization prevention also inconclusive. accept numbers are, work satisfactorily major case care about. 

I think pharma firms watching situation seriously, that's they're developing boosters tests strain. pretty clear data presented none hit 70%+ pandemic ending efficacy goal. 

As public policy, we've already seen one country make pretty serious leap faith technically high error inconclusive data. think SA's decision far less controversial plenty reasonable: take better one use first. better data makes available later, make better informed decision later.  Great info, thanks. Took bit get through, sorry lol

If less 12 months covid mutated least one known strain vaccines (depending one) less effective main strain, almost certain next 36 months mutation escapes vaccines altogether. 

The solution really radical. Society shaping two groups, follow health guidelines don't. also know reason lockdowns usually correlated hard hit hospitals are. 

I suggest main hospitals used followed guidelines still got sick. Everyone else sent open field ward broken tents get treatment there. can't destroy entire world someone believes bs fakebook mommy groups.  wife felt worry. People work call bad. awfully sore arm first one couldn’t sleep couch bad (she graciously tried first night came back surgery shifting bed caused lot pain). second dose wound easier first. EU citizen whole thing variants new vaccines deeply concerning. fear stuck endless cycles Brussels taking 6 months longer everybody else negotiate new vaccine contract. Then, time sign contract, vaccine already use anymore repeat negotiating process. I'm getting pretty scared second Moderna dose side effects based reading little much people bad ones. anyone non-fear mongery links stories share? Sure majority deaths older people, whole lot people died lot younger life expectancy, including children teenagers. Theres enough data suggest help hospitalizations. far know, one got astrazeneca vaccine hospitalized variant. It’s effective variant immediately dominate. AZ setting us 2020 again. United States covid hospital census change, last four mondays:

I'm still seeing evidence drop COVID prevalence United States slowing down. anything, speeding up.  


I seen leading indicators preceded ending downward period last two times one: Pneumonia-like symptoms, test positivity, wastewater reports, rate drop cases. Nothing's sending signals say ""we're going plateau soon."" bloody scandal! end getting oxford vaccine instead BioNTech one Germany, gonna pissed. Sorry hit reply quickly, also wanted thank expertise! Valuable work. ever expect molecular biology get exciting? Lol. Keep up, thank you. It’s joke, brother HH Budesonide steroid like dexamethasone. Systemic steroids generally work better inhaled steroids acute disease acute asthma attack. create study shows evidence inhaled steroids work better, see reason give inhaled steroid give people tablet. oral formulation fraction cost. see anything greatly change treatment strategies. Interesting applying steroid powder directly lungs still efficacy, though. premise “better safe sorry,” agree, also personally attest plenty physicians happily taking non-Tylenol NSAIDs either doses vaccine (U.S.). somebody uncomfortable bc COVID vaccine side effects access OTC systemic NSAIDs, I’d tell honestly don’t evidence claim effect risk compromising efficacy vaccine extremely low would embarrassed release numbers public.

Journos gotta journo  would think less transmissible variant would become dominant one? equipment almost ready go applying EUA still really goddamn fast.

-manufacturing engineer paper describing ""mimmickry"" human cells autoimmune response answers jist question. Basically spike protein mutations throw cocktail, likely vaccine could harmful generate autoimmune response.

As up/down proteins spike, read simplified explanation spike protein difference normal vs S.A/Brazil mutations RBD. ""Up"" S.Af. Presumably could configurations (although I'm unclear unlimited spike mutations could be) therefore cocktail would grow grow.. sounds un-ideal say least. point surprised American variant discovered SA. kind talk make masses see point taking vaccine. immunity virus highly variable, whereas immunity vaccine consistently good. lol. 19 started I’m 20 now.

I MUCH terrified virus. easy calculation majority die older life expectancy. (In country, US may differ). 

You need make case comparing quality adjusted life years lost. Makes sense. Thank sharing! hope well 🙂 especially make note answer direct questions since polite least do. Also, knew I'd sit spend time compose reply. 

Then followed cycle remembering forgetting again.

Started worry article going hit 6 months old lock out, knew getting close happened yet.

I guess thing helped remember combination subject article (our family Sri Lanka, near India) dad's job similar. sure, there's great argument keep using AZ population facing active variant already escaped vaccine.

I can't stand decisions made clearly science available, shitty spot politician right now. There's great argument keep using AZ vaccine even know risks later. can't imagine throwing away vaccine assumption create population waiting get taken B351 variant, happens really break many people. sounds like family member mine. Shes med student, got white coat too. Went wedding Cancun, masks. flew back school. like lives different reality. 

 100% agree. People consideration others safety practicing. They're risking coworkers safety also patients' safety. Nol needs to. Greece participating trials.

But yeah, let's hope keeps promises. could help also lot easing pandemic could reliably make covid patients better days. wife gets like pretty much needle, including taking bloods.

I never seem get symptoms needles. got vaccine yet since live area covid high priority it. Would least get high horse Meanwhile us Australia receive AZ one that's recently dudded. correct area, x-axis. /s think would better multiple variants time? would want risk long-term, unknown health bodily damage? get vaccine stop flippant. Well could bought enough everybody vaccinate EU twice second hits approval. 

EU wasting money crappier projects daily even spending 20 billion taxpayer money would ok end fucking pandemic! OP also Moderna trial participant. saw Instagram ad bookmarked days applying. Ultimately brainer... reasoning went something like this:

\- severely, chronically ill whopper viral illness (mono) would never want repeat this. willing take medium level personal risk avoid reliving experience. risk lower phase 1/2 participant (and tbh would probably volunteered early).

\- traveled world nonstop 10 years. point, never get colds. makes concerned normal delivery method, \*viral vector vaccine\*, would less likely work intended immune system wipes harmless virus helpful instructions take hold. \*mRNA\* delivery method would complication.

\- asked mother, chemistry phD, read everything available Moderna Novavax manufacture phase 1/2 trials. excited volunteering saw issues far methods, delivery, probability harm.

\- live healthcare worker would like protect even though stupid ever get vaccinated herself. would also like protect her. 

\-I young, female, low BMI, relatively underrepresented groups vaccine trials generally speaking. Data people like needed even get placebo. 

\-If get sick, trial still covers medical bills. serious undiagnosed/untreated illness death vaccine trial nightmare company. dedicated study doctor would move heaven earth take care me, even (and especially) hospitals later become crowded. Even received placebo. privilege extends years-long length trial. taking this, stop wearing masks start travelling? not, what's point taking vaccine? pre-emptively took Tylenol second round maybe helps offset inflammatory issues?

But fevers first time responsive medication. low grade, never hit 101F (oral temps). enough call safe since work covid patients.

I think immune system getting excited make antibodies real job versus trying destroy may organs lol Ya don’t quit. Win win 😂 Hope sarcasm US getting enough vaccines already. Europe rest world needs much more.  Opinions reading U.S. west coast colleges back person fall 2021? What's likely happen? They’re turning pandemic money making machine, maybe unprecedented hyperinflation fixed one time event, parties week instructions thee Tampa Bay mayor. see week effect. definatly irresponsible, hey Florida talking about. new vacine called Nolvavax (or something similar) also effective, less. protection original 2020 strain 96% mutants drips 89% (or average 82%). effective vaccines keep protectiveness pretty high, J&amp;J AstraZeneca drop significantly (but still prevent death hospitalization, matters. logical, mutations wont drop 0%, mutation small change therefore vaccinated people sensitive develop symptoms, equals drop efficiency. must vaccinate warp speed, lower virus load population drops chances mutations near zero. Right could expect new mutated variants arise every couple months, lowering vaccine efficiency percent. means 2022 might need revaccinate eveone again. gonna long race #1 priority right ramp vaccination production application, stop mutations test quickly revaccinate whole country necessary. Oxford groupie

Two days ago: AZ recommended elderly. 

UKers: purely political move Netherlands, Germany, Switizersland, South-Korea aimed UK. Supporting businesses lockdown cost Netherlands alone 10+ billion dollars. 3 billions dollars absolutely peanuts entire EU-economy. Three billion nothing compared even single country spending covid measures! Hell even 15 would reasonable get quickly!

Outbid rest money! EU shit again! Uh, I've unemployed since April, nice try. know life hold better life lost. Youre 10 days symptom onset symptom free week id bet clear, id get test see says, bet youre non contagious point. Totally agree limited evidence, there's enough reason avoid NSAIDs. Good stuff. private companies aren’t sharing formulas though isn’t case ‘AZ make Novavax instead.’ context AZ vaccine exists might well use it. I’m compelling big corporations share methods produce generics every vaccine, however isn’t cards moment thanks USA, UK EU. bed flu-like symptoms 3 days 2nd dose (fever, chills, joint pain, body aches, headache, nausea). fatigue 2 weeks disappeared. wasn’t keyword. agree you. wanted let know spite idiotic comments defend similarly idiotic ""witty"" comment started estimated death rate based Chinese data worked backwards.  still pretty rough estimate. 

I'm hopeful real number infections 3 times reported cases.  Considering amount mild cases, hard imagine high % Americans seeking test finding one. empathy billions lives put hold last year. Weird flex Ok I’m aware.

The world polio-free. eradicated. context thread offered indication implication anyone talking United States specifically. take virus affects every individual differently, there's many factors whether someone exhibits symptoms not. vast majority people probably catch COVID once, individual varying degrees severity symptoms.

Ultimately, comes viral load. individual inhales virus particles, body would able mount immune response suppress virus quickly, symptoms would probably mild individual. Perhaps reason, pre-existing immunity prevented experiencing severe symptoms. Another major factor quantity ACE2 receptors individual body, increases age. latter point, children experience mild symptoms relatively ACE2 receptors body.

In sense, everyone gets virus considered infected, symptoms ranging none (i.e. asymptomatic carrier) severe disease requiring hospitalization. ties altogether viral load. verrrry limited evidence this, blunting effect NSAIDs antibody response clinical significance, almost certainly initial exposure boosters (we don’t quality evidence yet COVID vaccine least compare previous vaccine efficacy vs. NSAID use studies). Tylenol good rule thumb since CNS-selective NSAIDs highly unlikely prevent reaching seroprotective levels IgG even amount systemic COX inhibition mean people currently busy facebook mommy groups streets more? might cause 4th. 5th 6th wave. Headline made think report released excited read it. Pretty poor choice words nbc. walk outside without mask. End story. science backs up. article say Tylenol later amends it. Ibuprofen naproxen anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such, thought might dull blunt immune response vaccine. Tylenol (acetaminophen) works differently understand, prefer take post vaccination symptoms requiring pain reliever. guys send money could protect us. Shame us. false, spreading misinformation.

There evidence efficacy drops 55s, nevermind considerably.

The AP biology answer, memory B cells directly correlate antibody production. still take second viral infection create higher longer lasting amount memory B cells truly consider “immunity,” also happens correspond higher concentrations antibodies blood well. 

covid highly unpredictable part trigger immune system overreact dangerous sometimes deadly ways. think reinfections covid likely fairly mild cases based rare diagnoses reinfections occur (in absence newer variants least), means relatively lower concentration memory B, preformed antibodies, cells probably pretty good. there’s cases people severe illness upon reinfection — think part due unfortunate overactive immune responses — it’s better get vaccine even covid recovery truly boost antibodies memory b/t cells levels prevent secondary infection establishing first place.  Mentally economically survive??? fuck going there? Thank christ wasnt war, America lost cool week 1. know 4 people confirmed reinfections UK. publishing data, entirely expected reinfections occur coronaviruses masters immune evasion - see common cold Israel 39% first dose accurate number use compare US 10%. cases seem going down, quickly. knows, tiny country far crowded entire US 1/3rd people least one shot, may take bit longer see things drop. heard anything SA Brazil strain there, thought getting Pfizer vaccine matter much. full plane recently women behind stop coughing. know covid test twice week never tested positive far. Thanks explanation. hope gets approved soon countries covid19 eradicated need isolate other, everyone else. Currently countries closed, there's much incentive rest world.India yet covid19 control. China &amp; India close borders, countries dependent trade follow. Germany. They're even ambulances. expect mRNA vaccines see drop efficacy bit more.

Why? someone know side effects neither dose, seems differ person. Hotboxing, minus weed. Everything said conjecture, try find iirc saw info ago. Im sure it’ll easy find since news recent trial data right now

If going make claim, got source dude. Otherwise I'm going ignore someone involved design couple clinical trials long enough time ago, pretty good rule thumb you’re clinical trials results radically different lab data something usually went wrong. would pretty hesitant push something totally unexplained affect human trials directly contradictory lab data showed unless could least postulate case

There's lab data shows ~6-7x increase antibodies required reach neutralisation SA variant Moderna/Pfizer vaccines test tube. there's actually lot evidence going work particularly well either. Moderna/Pfizer jabs induce stronger immune response Oxford jab, fair assumption efficacy slightly higher. much higher? knows.

Truth know effective even Oxford jab overall. There's huge question mark prevention severe cases, efficacy higher age groups. Moderna/Pfizer jabs simply data yet. Taken Pfizers press release:

""Pfizer BioNTech encouraged early vitro study findings currently evaluating full set mutations spike protein South African variant.""

All they've done test vitro, virus subset mutations. Funny! hope people smart enough see way let guard down. Even lab results showed 6-fold reduction neutralising titres antibodies. 
It’s hardly encouraging. That’s article says Yes, get psychosomatic symptoms kinds things, including corona. company engages ridiculous levels hygiene theater...but enforce mask usage anybody building. entire department (amusing, environment, health, safety department) get sick within days other. refused let one guy get sick quarantine desk 6 feet away everybody else.

Feel relieved  help took ages admit Interestingly, Moderna BioNTech/Pfizer (and J&amp;J/Jansenn Novavax) use [a modified version whereas everyone else using something closer original wild type. might still differences. radicalizing idiot Americans

I wish americans fell BS. Facebook radicialised people world seems part “pandemic cycle” happens surge. look May-June 2020 August-September 2020, see decline surges. definitely decline holiday surges.

However, decline different drastic. Vaccinations definitely helping enough make big enough dent... yet. 

I truly believe beginning end pandemic. sure I'm going source basics vaccines work. 

Immune response efficacy. need immune response efficacy possible. occurrence immune response alone (with simulated virus less) suggest much efficacy. 

All vaccine candidates strong immune response, able demonstrate efficacy following immune response. You’re making foundational error.
The ongoing consequences repeated infections year year dire. People think like playing Russian roulette once, it’s like playing twice year, still don’t know much worse virus get. article refers peer reviewed results: stated Pfizer slightly less effective still effective based sources. still prevent hospitalization death. maybe job elected representatives private companies reason deputised responsibility governing speech billions people? Yea, could also make everyone infertile cause opposite effect...so knows. Great hear glad much success UK! Looking forward seeing AZ J&amp;J approved states coming weeks. Hopefully, start seeing huge payoff vaccines really soon. Would nice normal summer again! Check happened methane levels last year. methane bomb going now. Last year remember people sub trying gaslight believing holiday caused massive spike wasn’t reflected numbers all. sure what’s shit. take data is. chick thumbnail hot vaccines produced profit get positive coverage, one produced at-cost, siphoning away billions pharmaceutical companies gets reputation tarnished single non-existent 'study' south africa.

Would again? 100%! matter bad some, infinitely better serious case covid. quite can't quite visualize long 65 years old man wait get vaccine **IN EUROPE** .

They thought pushing give vaccine older people Pfizer Vaccine full protect them.

The reality 65years old man wait (if everything goes expected) least **4 months** could vaccine like tomorrow gain least protection serious symptoms death. get symptomps thinking corona virus. Something like placebo? contact infected person ever since felt weird. Im gonna tested tomorrow want know thing Well pets like dogs cats probably vaccine covid, many people worried mutations... done people pets follow, believe dogs spread extreme circumstances even become sick themselves. Go Wikipedia read different economic social ideologies, good start. Comparing plague seriously stupid. SARS-CoV-1 closest relative virus, **and longer exists anywhere earth**

**The SARS-CoV-2 virus genetically closely related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), first pandemic threat novel deadly coronavirus emerged late 2002 caused outbreak severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).**

Now read post sound like guy Sopranos makes fun Romans asks Tony ""Where Romans now?"" Tony responds ""You're looking a...ole"".

That Covid19's reply say SARS-COV's longer exists anywhere earth. 

Here clip  yesn't. Yes, b1.1.7 far already spreading Europe expected. already know vaccines issues dealing mutation. biggest YIKES recently discovered mutation b1.1.7 UK 484k mutation South Africa, basically one Transmission rate b1.1.7 also minimizing vaccine efficacy South African mutation. lot data 484k yet, first data however shows reduces efficacy vaccines 20-30%.

Basically, means is: covid19 probably going issue most/all 2021 well. Idk. first dose side effects, even sore arm. I'm going overconfident second dose. There's chance spread everywhere already sadly. ready hu----

So another coming stupidity, well done. socially awkward.

Now know 60% Reddit crying thought masks going away. Dude, people 70 dying.

You live couple days chills. can't cure death. article right. It’s super dangerous reopen early vaccination finished. gonna variant continues mutate more? Vaccines aren’t readily accessible students yet outcome anyone expect? Yeah, right. memory excess deaths slightly ahead covid deaths looks pretty similar point covid deaths slightly ahead. 

With similar probably suggests covid deaths measurement relatively accurate. probably ever get true death toll though. compile dossier citizen’s activities, needed determine place new healthcare apartheid? special police agency created purpose? depend tips informers? authorities know you’ve following rules? 

Will court appeal decision deprive healthcare, lawyers debate precise definitions every infraction level necessary proof? think deaths per million \*state\* around 2,000, 0.5%. know people like that, anti vax skeptical/not wanting one. example, person I'm talking vaccines kids vaccines got HPV vaccines recently. get one. opinion rushed trust it. give credit, everything else (no gatherings, kids still distant learning, wears mask, etc.). fence sitters problem long run.

I hope people like far between. many people reject getting vaccine we're going problems. I'd wager people use overall lack control say ""see, work"" ignoring enough people getting vaccine problem. Trendsetters. muh variants! Let’s hopeful improvements AZN vax turns better coverage different dosing regime. 

Australia needs AZN vax effective put govt sunk investment in. love husband much, covid sure convinced stick women ever goes south (I’m bi). man drives insane. get it. member World Health Organization expert team investigating origins coronavirus Wuhan said Chinese side granted full access sites personnel requested — level openness even hadn’t expected.

Peter Daszak told Associated Press Friday team members submitted deeply considered list places people include investigation objections raised.

“We asked wanted go. gave hosts list ... see we’ve been, we’ve key places,” Daszak said.

“Every place asked see, everyone wanted meet. ... really good,” said British-born zoologist, president NGO EcoHealth Alliance New York City.

Daszak said team concluded site visits spend next days trolling data consulting Chinese experts presenting summary findings news briefing prior departure Wednesday. news report, need time write article. headline come people want know that, hence way things. new development. people live political points. Politics religion game people. Heretics must perish eyes. joking...... unlike idea “mitochondria power house cell.”

Oh man, hated prequels introduced idea! heard hard blend mrna vax coz act adjuvants. There’s also wide range age comes Reddit users. younger likely bad side effects. young sustained 103 fever day. wasn’t horror story still felt like flu. Worth though. feel brother. whole thing supertanker shite. “Just wait little longer!” I’ve fed drivel 11 FUCKING MONTHS. Time never ever get back. It’s going 2027 people like “I know family died causes now, friends digital interaction doesn’t maintain friendships you’re homeless economy collapsed multiple times HANG BIT LONGER! IM SURE REASON ALIVE RIGHT AROUND CORNER!” Yeah I’m done. Yes. It’s called, “Thinking relying trusted sources.” Even 50% effective vaccine good enough enough people vaccinated get R0 1. Occupied Gaza. Australian here, don’t distance loved ones. 

We hard yards 3 months almost restrictions now. direct link neutralising titres vaccine efficacy. basically says ‘we expect beneficial immunity’. Nah, I’ll go vaccine..... funny trolls always seen come night. Like clockwork. Good hear. hearing Six Flags America im 2020 put good front entrance park, goes crap, never ended going despite season passes, luckily extended 2021.

TBH, Six Flags America isnt cleanest well maintained outside Gotham area I'm guessing much care given. guess post placeholder ""articles"" actually news report.  Sure, whatever. Let Delta Delta. part I'll continue opt economical convenient flights, regardless social distancing protocol. That's support return normalcy, even means slightly added risk. run trial dogs multiplied 7 afterwards. Apparently, another one cut finger. one bruise upper arm! Clearly, preexisting conditions much. 

Darn paper cuts. know explain people celebrating without getting insanely political.   situations personally thought could've possibilities. Ranging likely less likely, specific order:

1. jumped animals wet market Wuhan humans
2. lab Wuhan. Possibly someone breaching safety protocols, carelessness, simple human error.
3. foreign government trying destabilize China (and going terribly wrong entire world). 
4. Powerful entities around world wanting cause crisis implement agenda mask imminent collapse financial systems. 
5. simply virus existed animal world jumped onto humans, unrelated wet markets found way maybe even start Wuhan. (Probably likely thing happened. convoluted conspiracy seems unlikely thing happened. likely virus started naturally course China wanted cover want responsible).

China also loads time cover things up. wonder accurate investigation be. probably gonna bunch obvious revelations. ''So yeah, natural know came specifically.'' duh, China time world cover things up. 

The virus still here, matter origins went through. still need combat medical lockdown measures got worldwide. New medicine, vaccines, wearing masks etc. needed get mess. still lot people need wake that's tragic hell, year Pandemic. Still calling ''just flu.'' I'm pro new normal, also new normal. depends kind new normal comes this. 

A new normal treat planet better? Give people tools work health? Accessible healthcare worldwide? focus mental health restructuring way approach work? take measures climate change high possibility new virus breaks much fuck nature? Yes please, bring new normal. new normal fuck around corporations/governments/elite try take advantage situation? hard swallow situation even case, would feeding ground kinds destabilizing entities take advantage make people think happening, wasn't. stir shit destabilize nations. Oh well, crazy times ahead us. ain't surprise! young got second dose Friday. Woke middle night chills. morning woke 99.9 temperature. rest Saturday 6pm 103-ish fever. going bed 100 fever Saturday night woke headache feeling off. 

The time period high fever really sucked. felt like flu, without nausea digestive symptoms. conclusion anyone expect? China showed team wanted show them. cases aren’t interested cooperating contact tracing? ones don’t get tested first place? Governments world going use ""misinformation"" moniker control people see hear, frankly, say. scare everyone. We’ll see. Would nice. New vaccine; new variants; assumptions. wish understood potential long-covid among less severe cases. Still much learn etiologically. Interesting, considering Facebook incubator nurturer things misinformation. Combating activists? think that's last straw Facebook. What? There's multiple reports saying natural immunity last several months, sound like someone talking new york city never within 1000 miles sound like fun whac-a-mole. getting people _A_ shot massive evolution Well 70% willing vaccinated. comes point simply care Republicans want to. want die, stand way. Yes youtube. know people spend hours caught vaccine conspiracies. dont make charts criteria. Give specific examples background information I'll let know think them. Ferrets spread it. exotics vet taking ferrets URIs unless they're literally death's door even 102983108 precautions. won’t. dumb. I'm thankful did. also result America could change bad decision (IMHO) made Europe. Best coast variant! Really? think heart attacks strokes get covid tested? I'm curious are. would make feel better. really think masks makes impossible spread virus? Social distancing ventilation way important masks. variant E484K mutation commonly called Kent variant however distinguish previous UK variant Yes. Especially considering studies focus specific mutations. People would understand contents much better thought way. Oh, totally right - England. bad.

Will downward trajectory cases continue? 

Come people wait little longer vaccines now. could see another big surge pushing normal back 2022 screw now! Jeez, offense man like REALLY fucking dumb. New Zealand US nothing alike whatsoever. New Zealand managed stop COVID quarantining every single person entering country. US mass illegal immigration thousands people walking across border every day countries (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras) massive COVID outbreaks.

I also miss Cars Coffee. stuck inside long midwestern winter much looking forward getting house drooling cars also partaking photography hobby. COVID ended even started. Egypt controls border Gaza Egypt. Israel. Can’t 10x anymore we’d exceed number residents many places. good news means lifetime risk cut significantly. estimated 22% exposure risk 10x. initially announcing pause rollout, Monday South African authorities said vaccine would rolled ""stepped manner"" issuing 100,000 doses see prevents hospitalisations deaths.

Paused, think, adapt. 

I blame them, SA variant predominantly deal with. need make decisions based available data. AZ clearly picture Guys cmon,

The global Corona virus pandemic started Wuhan nothing Coronavirus laboratory Wuhan. 

Haven't ever heard coincidence May something post-Christmas spikes. Families broke quarantine, travelled around Christmas New Year, took 7 10 days get positive results means highest number cases 10 15 Jan.

Nearly Europe lockdown 10+ weeks. Even lockdown last spring numbers start dropping 10+ weeks. local reservoirs coronavirus carrying bats, dolt! Congrats :) still waiting parents get 1st shot.   

  

Tell still follow social distancing mask wearing, till least 2 weeks past 2nd dose. agree, except really going convinced scientific study?  could anything young people rarely suddenly drops dead

You'll get 40s happens usually pre-existing conditions heart guards borders controls imports. It’s bit like saying prisoners detained guards control walls doors. people study

Yes 40 cases disease. hypothesise vaccination protects severe lung disease protect upper respiratory mucosal disease, results consistent small study worth shit. 

AZ favour restricting trial younger cohort. 

The staged roll-out far better plan giving vaccine all. right. We'll doses required entire population, eventually. However, government bought lot vaccines, succeed receiving early. Right now, vaccination campaign almost completely halted Pfizer's delays countries vaccinating. 

I believe Trudeau asked covax vaccines. lack vaccines long term, lack right next months.

That said, pretty controversial use vaccines. prepared, would built facilities able produce vaccines depended entirely vaccines produced elsewhere, slowing rollout.

At least going valuable lesson us. Hopefully keep vaccine factories currently building even pandemic. Asking simple question facts virus ""platforming"" previous pandemic ended certainly relevant current pandemic. Yep. tell people time choice lesbian, I’s choose hot minute! got second dose sunday, flu like symptoms overnight woke fine next morning, though little sleep deprived.

Yeah. go Reddit 95% people post got vaccine ""It like Death day."" 95% represents probably 5% population large got vaccine.

Lockdowns needed virus control health care funeral systems overrun collapsing. view pretty much place hire number refrigerated trucks store bodies would benefit lockdown weeks. maybe even start building temporary hospitals parking lots park. Lockdown seems way break high level transmission. look everything ""scientists"" policy makers say terms affects public rather facts data behind it, makes lot sense.

Like talk herd immunity exposure might encourage people take vaccine wait immunity occur naturally. throw absurdly high goals vaccinations like 85-90% impossible attain, order encourage people take vaccine. say vaccine reduces spread want people stop lockdowns precautions prematurely.

27,778/8,419,000 = .33%

.33% NCY's ENTIRE POPULATION died COVID. every man, woman, child entire city already infected COVID (they haven't), IFR would .33%

As everybody infected, IFR much higher .33% literally CANNOT, even theory, .23% like person said. understand point. point coming assumption. reading “teachers need priority essential workers”, isn’t said. 

Teachers one (of many) priorities there. That’s it. Priority whom? doesn’t say. Maybe it’s non-essential workers work home (like me). case, agree teacher get vaccine me, works desk job home. agree priority jobs also interact plenty people every day higher chance catching spreading virus? No. one saying otherwise. 

If agree teacher, interacts 30 children day, get vaccine me, interacts literally one still contributing society, agree *a* priority. 

No one disagrees workers ALSO priority. you’re arguing literally nothing since article isn’t saying you’re saying said... hear you, it’s frustrating, gotta keep refreshing pages. couple really maddening near-misses almost got appointment finally secured one many articles pfizer Same. 6 delta flights, next person 0 times. half someone row behind.

Lockdowns school closures certainly public health harm, can’t continue risk offered vaccines. pure virtue signaling. Unless want wear mask you’re vaccinated, understand, find hard believe people wearing masks time next year Except whole March 2020 mask thing, agree fucked hard there? 

Maybe lesson learned that. want cynical answer? tested positive late November, symptoms, recovered couple weeks.

Tested negative December.

Just yesterday, tested positive. zero symptoms. read someone continue testing positive within three months initially getting it. However, explain testing negative December?

All PCR tests, suspect false positive. guidance advice would appreciated. mean.. it’s year, year half. great humans tough adapt well. don’t understand they’re saying vaccinated people still spread like it’s fact

Who's saying this? seen anywhere. Precisely, literally millions people entering cycles every week, know absolutely nothing it. 

That alone would ease pressure vaccination allow people might need get line first. “Awaiting instructions...” There's subtle goalpost transition preventing hospitals getting overwhelmed ZeroCovid. 

ZeroCovid absurd societal cost-benefit perspective, literally impossible.

Society needs reject destructive narrative. vaccines work, do, hospitalizations deaths CONTINUE plummet next TWO months. 

Then time open take lives back. feel safe, stay home. certain point, idea perceived safety anyone else's responsibility becomes completely rediculous.

It’s worth noting Oxford Pfizer vaccines similar (Pfizer mRNA, Oxford Adenovirus vector), Oxford vaccine ineffective preventing mild/moderate illness South African variant necessarily imply Pfizer vaccine issue Ah, yes important remember small study actual efficacy may vary significantly readout. fear mongering made pandemic worse? Technically state book says BMI Texas, classified pre existing condition. places raised either way. 3/5 state Texas eligible vaccine! Same, COVID like month ago, getting vaccine 15th, im fucking around shit. Again. Um guys forgetting crazy spike we're going National Almond Day week cases per 100k

positivity rate **over 10%**

schools open yet, IMO. you, sore arm. Oddly, flu shot always makes sick, anticipated making sick well.

I’m sure I’ve COVID not. work healthcare couple coworkers got it, never symptoms. tested June asthma acting up, negative.

I believe plays role though. antibodies, may feel little sick first one less second one, didn’t COVID, I’ve heard first generally bad 2nd rough.

Interestingly, coworkers got sick vaccinating ones got Pfizer shot #2. I’d say 50/50 people got Pfizer whether got sick not. far one Moderna got sick. help allergies, asthma, respiratory infections. keep wearing? virus know end March much vaccinated people spread it. one going diligent fully vaccinated. Whoa, vaccine family situation sounds awkward! Ohio (if are) mostly open? Great. tackle 3rd world country level vaccine rollout. Silly paper hats masks equivalent nice try comparison. posted corrected mate. Pfizer Moderna done large trials SA data say big difference be. people think similar effective 57% efficacy baseline J&amp;J, exceeds FDA's original stated threshold whether vaccine worth approving. people also vaccinated offer time. friend Lupus already second jab. 65s high risk offered vaccines, way net benefit closures continues lean toward continuing them.  wot It’s problem for-profit mass media. 

Half population believe EVERYTHING willingly go mass hysteria something might actual issue. half ignore EVERYTHING pay consequences without care. literally never win way media currently structured.  mean now, almost 5 months later I’ve recovered bit smell decent amount taste. nuance flavor gone, subtlety longer exists, can’t smell things unless get really close, smell dull anyway. don’t know they’re even getting better anymore. really miss food used taste... No. It’s world, well, society general. 

They thought pandemic would lead utopia. 

It didn’t they’re upset wasn’t worse. Variants? could see flu season flying/using public transportation. participate Novavax vaccine trial can? I,m scared something bad could happen don’t know TOOO much  Dude world, autism something? would make sense, otherwise quit whining Sorry, Oxford Pfizer. here's link I'd say people share articles based headline — without reading content — much blame. strict whole time, especially holidays.

Pursuing seem little strange. Maybe trying get ahead anti-vaxxers wanting travel could vaccinated. lying it. Parent told us planning vaccinating kids vaccine become available kids. wish could enforce testing keast. Yeah I’m gonna need source one keep seeing articles school closures lead lost generation kids social techinical skills. drop restrictions need start discussion cover costs long-haulers. includes immediately ruling new taxes.

We can't treating people like 9/11 survivors.

Yea, going get little less paycheck... that's cost reduced restrictions. Shut except say thank you, complain it. Nothing see here, totally coincidence virus appeared city lab working coronaviruses ! Fear mongering opposite effect desire. propaganda. fear mongering propaganda sites like subreddit actually made pandemic worse, people think they’re helping actually hurting. I’m done chat. you’re making shit up. Bye now. 


Edit: making read full articles, heading (I’m heading reader, really don’t know me, making assumptions) make I’ll informed comments. I’m backing everything say, you’re jumbled echo chamber “tHE MedIA” don’t seem able think critically see difference scientific method playing real time reputable scientists study new variants, source isn’t “the media” , media reporting (and reputable sources properly verify information) it’s universities studies, ISN’T presented absolute, made clear (if actually read articles) forthcoming aren’t peer reviewed, still testing. POINT (there caps don’t like, least spell) variants mutating, getting stronger, vaccines may protect. people already vaccines, data released like early let’s people know we/they safe new variants they’ve vaccine. don’t keep conversation keep digging heels attempting hair splitting. I’m class kid, owe response, edited anyone else reading, maybe, even though you’re stubborn, you’ll learn difference sources realize created equal, realize difference spreading false information political gain, get country open make people think there’s cure vs releasing data studies already peer reviewed vaccines public letting us know new variants look evading vaccines, people still get sick, spread disease 10% efficiency, even protect severe disease. want argue, now, I’m going stop wasting precious moments life. Good day 😃 Yesterday said March 1st though. Seems like planning pretty hard regardless. MRNA VACCINES 90% EFFECTIVE. 95%!!!!!! seem missing saying ""if"" ""in case that"", etc. I'm making assumptions factors happen; rather, I'm saying know result do. Yeah would definitely able convince americans party go bars. Get real, lack discipline real issue here, late warnings. believe people would listened youre fool. think ""still wear mask follow precautions public"" telling people scared though, unless missed something said?  Source? believe correct. Great know! first shot? slightly sore arm, hurt direct pressure moving specific ways (mainly side). know COVID before? far know, haven't. sure much plays role though. Awesome ideas, greatly appreciate input. Essentially aim fields, homelessness reached around 550k U.S large portion can’t afford housing, that, many consumers lost homes due pandemic moved back home parents alleviate that, provide housing college students want work homes college. Even fix problems, huge market people want live tiny focused source this. lot moving pieces year refining really honed whole idea down. presenting pitch deck different ones heard lots positive feedback made partnerships process, mention web platform we’ll developed really solve lot grunt work. 100% people going argue 100 cases 1% positivity low-risk populations cause lockdown hit critical mass vaccinations.

I've extremely strict precautions currently pro-lockdown, vaccinated herd immunity, really lockdowns, risk new variants likely treated booster shot potential precautions rather super strict impositions.

If lockdowns become Covid-peak-related-measures, people going listen them. saying ""we're never going normal again"" asinine; whether Covid exists, people social power get vaccines easily. say shit like that, people tune out. consider, too, previous surges, testing still increasing decline catching infections making drop look smaller.

[Look hospitalizations decline summer peak looks similar slope declines winter peak. saying click bait scientific article? why? would someone this?!?! think we're waiting herd immunity lift restrictions anyway. fully agree prioritized. people pre existing conditions? brought pushed comorbidities people can’t even get shot? confusing. would people apologize? took median death rate bunch studies, many poorly done showed zero deaths, wrong.  


Good science calling shot fitting data make theory work. Also, 0.23% IFR \*not\* good. 0.23% US population like 750,000 people dead. Using 0.23% IFR excuse toss restrictions aside moronic. Wealthy countries tend big excess/official difference, afford expensive testing programmes notice deaths. gap some, eg US 448k excess vs 360k official, Italy probably worst ratio (63k-37k, 3mths date tho). 

Several western Europe (eg UK, France, Sweden) actually negative difference, ie slightly covid deaths excess. state?? wish state legit  There’s nothing wrong that,

It's still highly transmissible, that's what's wrong that. problem before. Would love see study health insurance plays this. mean, asking impossible. US anyway. herd immunity, say need 75%+ population vaccinated. That's going happen. MAGAs anti-vaxxers take vaccine circumstances. also black people extremely hesitant take vaccine, given experimented upon past.
 
Given that, impossible give concrete time frame. going take long takes, lift restrictions based date rather reaching herd immunity and/or containing virus plausible. providing Israelis, Jewish population. Israel significant Muslim, Christian population getting vaccines. Religion factor, citizenship residency are. amount misinformation going sad.

I pessimistic person way many people saying ""the worst yet come"" ""it another year"" ""just wait SA variant"" etc.

The numbers plummeting. large immune population. Worldwide now. variants already widespread plus numbers plummeting UK SA well.

The next large hurdle dealing long haul issue.

Why obsession stay bad? I've read peoples comments excited. Makes sense yo me. haven’t hugged anyone since March since live alone. I’m even sure rules become stricter dipshits don’t care. can’t even go 9pm thanks senseless morons can’t keep distance. don’t really feel reason comply anymore, country fucked anyways I’m even afraid get myself, trying good citizen. really mean hurt that? It’s like get thank getting sick over. Outside family don’t know anyone that’s planning getting it. aren’t “far right anti-vaxxers” either. normal vaccinations. even left leaning Biden voters. want people get vaccinated need lot better messaging. say everyone. think absolutely clue VAST majority people feel scenario though. Covid also kills political careers seems. though? Isreal 9 million people it. 

The US vaccinating 1 million per day. taking long small 'country' get everyone vaccinated? Except vaccine AVAILABLE flu. choice take not. Right choice COVID vaccine. binned group people like not. 50-60% hospitalizations age 65. like things improve drastically.

Children far eligible, 12+ trials process likely fall. get bulk eligible adults (well 16+) vaccinated, we've likely hit herd immunity, 12 already unlikely negative symptoms illness death COVID. things like bad faith arguments. They're saying inflicting death others never bloodlust youre sufficiently personally aggrieved. dead wrong and, frankly, scary think people real life justifying behavior kinds ideas. hard think number ways applied justify atrocities. Wonder 6% they’re smelling. Maybe virus body/clothing? Dogs either smell don’t. LMFAOOOO DARE lion. Thank depends. State says BMI 30 hubs (we hubs around state instead run state) say anything 25. 

It's asthma. hubs require severe asthma others say asthma fine. asthma triggered appointment vaccine local hospital system see doctor also happens hub. funny thing is, also cancer type cancer triggered appointment cancer hospital yet. Yay asthma guess? There’s verification. Perhaps something something diplomacy could assist process?

But something like 6% population country affected rising seas alone... Wow it’s almost like there’s correlation There's good reason given higher priority.

If one teacher free 30 parents go back work, yes, probably get priority folks. sound like kids understand families going through, considering long-term impact society economy. 40+ million vaccinated even one shot make difference. wrong. Thank service! Docs like treasure. like major viral illnesses (measles, mumps, rheumatic fever) Covid pandemic leave wake people affected medical complications. Since it’s novel virus, limited info serious long-term things be. numbers people died serious reactions taking vaccine. public right know Hospitalization rate per 1 million

## Abstract

COVID-19 patients may exhibit neuropsychiatric neurological symptoms. found anxiety cognitive impairment manifested 28-56% COVID-19 convalescent individuals mild respiratory symptoms associated altered cerebral cortical thickness. Using independent cohort, found histopathological signs brain damage 25% individuals died COVID-19. affected brain tissues exhibited foci SARS-CoV-2 infection replication, particularly astrocytes. also found neural stem cell-derived human astrocytes *in vitro* susceptible SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism involves spike-NRP1 interaction. SARS-CoV-2-infected astrocytes manifested changes energy metabolism key proteins metabolites used fuel neurons biogenesis neurotransmitters, elicited secretory phenotype reduces neuronal viability. data support model SARS-CoV-2 reaches brain, infects astrocytes consequently leads neuronal death dysfunction. processes likely contribute structural functional alterations brain COVID-19 patients.  article lready posted abd discussed yesterday Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Uh... what?

I doubt ever reach 100 COVID cases day US. Pfizer Moderna allocation remain roughly week 2/15 US.

Last four weeks allocations (first second doses):

Week 1/25: 8,599,750

Week 2/1: 10,151,550

Week 2/8: 11,159,750

Week 2/15: 11,003,750

Sources: don’t think country discovered variant running rampant population bears responsibility containing it? onus Zambia Congo test keep infested population? joke. Citizens world indeed. Next month? possible? state don’t even start vaccinating people 65-74 end week, spent month vaccinating 75+. I’m calling shenanigans evaluation; largely haven’t even vaccinating people retirement age yet. I'm American assume teachers considered ""Other essential workers""?

I'd consider frontline essential workers, personally. matter angle take, teachers crucial society economy. Kids need get back school able safely, teachers absolutely first 20% vaccinated.

Anyone says primarily care economy needs understand American workforce can't stay home time. know school daycare, workforce needs get back there. fall it, Sputnik anagram Putins k = Putins konspiracy!!1! made day Unpopular opinion, he's wrong. Corona damaging lungs makes hard get enough air, thinnest mask real PITA case. Simultaneously, corona himself, he's probably immune next month two. means spreading people anyway, primary purpose face mask. biased, scientific. title implies conclusion supported actual information, namely vaccine works, biased. implying something unscientific, AKA tell effective vaccine looking absolute numbers deaths. 

IMO probably one least egregious example bad title I've seen. saw one op-ed says “Covid turned everyone potential serial killer”.

The hysteria real. experts speaking eyes, “Anything keeps people vigilant good”, irresponsible. Impressive somewhere already given 38% country least 1 shot

As right now, Israel Hmmm, wording exactly clear.

But, estimate 1/4.6 infections reported 83.1 million estimated yields 18 million reported infections happened mid-December, would change things. Also, they've definitely updated first looked 1/6 infections reported. really bad taste friends, entered without consent bar. Vaccinations 200k Netherlands last week.
Terribly low, embarassing numbers.
But also almost half total vaccinations weve stabbing away month now, last sunday even anything die weather. Incredibly misleading title. Possibly - arbitrary checkpoint needs crossed? approach 6 months ago clear everyone alive going perish? big worry variants effect resistance conferred prior infection. takes big hit forget depending prior infections contribute herd immunity. suffer conditions incarcerated person. comparison draw valid. I'm assuming got word Moderna seem prevent transmission 90% time, kind data waiting for. "" tl;dr Moderna vaccine blocks (87-93%) infections &amp; 91% (89-94%) transmission. "" Think vaccine like condom. Condoms stop lot pregnancies aren’t 100% guaranteed prevent Father’s Day card. problem homeless, especially Cali, 90% CANNOT work. suffer either crippling hardcore substance addiction, gross mental health disorders. easily treatable. 

I family friends money &amp; means disposal who've literally shelled hundreds thousands various private treatment programs avail. kids cannot hold steady long-term job self-sufficient.

My best advice micro-target efforts. Maybe focus homeless seniors expanding board &amp; care. think ways help struggling &amp; homeless foster adolescents who've aged government programs. Maybe Americorps type service program free room &amp; board? targeting homeless college kids? Maybe set incentives local alumni respective universities add granny/mother-in-law additions house them, rent-free. think get I'm trying say ill spell out. said "" thought idea perceived safety anyone else's responsibility ridiculous beginning"". I'm saying think people always expected people take reasonable precautions keep people safe. 

I giving examples, trying argue law (which probably different anyway). glad family friend.

Male, mid-30s, completely healthy pre-COVID. lives NYC got sick early pandemic. never hospitalized sick. kept telling pneumonia. later tested positive sars-cov-2 antibodies. 

It took months recover worst it. Now, almost year later, still fully recovered. longer run strenuous workouts. regularly sees cardiologist pulmonologist damage heart lungs. heart damage bad, lung damage appears permanent pretty life-changing. cysts lungs significantly reduced lung function. 

And there's colleague got COVID. Health 50-something woman, health issues. largely physically recovered, dealing extreme fatigue ""brain fog"" every since sick back April. brain fog bad reduce workload found can't keep track one project time. able get answers dealing this. 

Unfortunately, idea long-term effects virus are, clear people recovery struggle long-term health effects. Oh children years out? Right. That's weird going trials already age groups. Surely responsibility receiving country stop varients entering country?

SA varient UK already, UK one successful vaccine rollouts world, best jeopardise that; better late never.

Also, god knows vaccine dodging varients there? Shame countries shit genome testing. Hatuna Makata, np.  downvotes blatant hypocrisy. matter spin it, there's way crowded protests can't spread Covid even perfect mask wearing distancing, obviously even case. refusal accept simple reality reflects blinded commitment ideology, hence downvotes. virus care protests for. trying compare job incarceration?

I’m anticapitalist. Labor markets coercive day long. even put paragraph incarceration reeks privileged victim play.  I’ll send private message tweet provides info clinic. don’t know they’re vaccinating Palestinians sure seem vaccinating pretty much anyone shows can’t verify anyone super immunocompromised would suggest try it. Politics AfD directly linked Queerdenken Protests, actually agree OP. thing sucks US it'll individual companies airlines signaled they'll likely require vaccine international flights. Specific countries require travel likely cruise lines well. oh fuck bad. misread it. Old man cancer dies virus. supposed groundbreaking something? Show one actually healthy person died — obese people healthy, athletes hid comorbidities public. everyone (or people) vaccinated world wide. disturbing. dont understand people upset this. technology blessing curse - virtual options, students would school. Why? thought nerds happy it. course it, stick needles precision millimeters every day clinic, giving vaccine piece cake 🍰 signed up, soon contact you? lung scars do? Smokers lungs aren’t damaged scars. They’re damaged they’ve filling smoke sex

I fourteen months. 100m infections people guessing anyway. Covid hospitalizations US declining month. IHME predicts continue decline hospitalizations also declining UK South Africa. 

I see variants major problem US. anyone also unsure read title; mean one 55 receive AstraZeneca vaccine, people aged 18-55 receive one. Life much easier back then. Animal crossing, tiger king, dunking snobby celebrities. Good times. know specific information new variants contagious? generally increased level contagiousness, contagious via droplets, surfaces, etc.?

I met 6 people weekend outdoors park 1.5-2 hours. kept masks on, able maintain 6 ft distance others. I'm kind anxious it. know pretty low risk, I'm wondering increased contagiousness means, practically. said people exercising masks sweat gets enables bacteria grow gets inhaled in. yes cringing people jogging masks. 


The risk outdoor transmission, especially passing by, also low. like 8th time going jump back papers daily walk within govt limits

Depends state, given papers corporate months March April/May drive work. Wasn’t ever stopped still occasion  “Stop living fear.”

Now, heard before? getting veterinarians paramedics administer too. Oh, could ever argue wise well reasoned response. Woe unto I. shall hang head shame forever evidence whatsoever data.

Well source new case numbers dropping DRAMATICALLY areas absolutely policy changes. What’s alternative? virus suddenly decide stop infecting people? Dentists probably injections doctors. least dentist seems heavy needle :( Doug Ford wants people die money. “We illusions COVID eradicated time start school year comes up,” said William “Chip” Sudderth III, spokesperson Durham, North Carolina schools, whose students school buildings since March.""

I thought people supposed educators. course covid eradicated.  Humans eradicated one virus that's smallpox. goal minimize risk, eradicate goddam virus. 
Hopefully district's admins bad assessing risk. Vets? 

Dentists certainly experience giving injections, I've found. Painfully. Though perhaps part country, simply nobody's going leave house unnecessarily -miserable- out. alternatives fairly obvious. reason hygiene theatre exists extremely easy relatively cheap spray stuff aerosolized disinfectant make look like protecting people airborne virus, fact action minimally effective. capacity restrictions necessary protect people difficult, extremely damaging bottom line many businesses (airlines, restaurants, bars, popular retail outlets tourist attractions), hence extreme reluctance effectively implement them. agree. getting massively downvoted weeks saying that. Well Sweden, nice knowing you. Thanks Ikeas Zero chance. snowball better chance hell! Inbreeding? Yeah anybody thinks people required wear masks outside fuck right off. I’m going tested 5 days! hike lovely though. thanks! Thanks OP posting this. banned 7 days sub posting numbers underreported Florida, many states. even gave CDC references, work STEM around data analysis. blew mind. think people automatically assume ""drastically underreported"" negative.

Nobody ever going 100% data thick pandemic. Ever. I'm glad finally studies popping expansive pandemic been. prove fatality rate even smidge less is, that's huge win world. two vaccines approved US one that’s likely next confirmed effective SA variant. criminally charged   I'd go far say places filled people think *temp checks* make impervious. use different vector first second shot. allows second shot effective. develop immunity vector first shot use vector second shot, like Oxford vaccine, reduce effectiveness. think longer 12 week spacing observed boost effectiveness Oxford one, vector immunity wanes. here. sorts stuff outdoors wearing mask. Run, golf, name it. It’s problem people don’t want comply. 

That’s problem. seems producing already. FDA hasn’t approved vaccines use, manufactured. Im part social life whatsoever spring. midwesterner understands... good! :D

If south, outdoor schooling might bad idea. Although know get kids focus outdoors.  vaccines EU ordered made within EU (+Switzerland Moderna)? drug-substance production fill finish.

I’m tinfoil hat type I’m still skeptical cabin air filtration argument. 

Planes cruise ships fly. Nastiness everywhere. People love talking pharmacies give vaccine, they’re responsible around 25% flu shots every year. It’s going take hell lot do.  use check community spread

Which used for. far better indicator confirmed case numbers everyone using policy decisions. Massachusetts super reliable. Like weeks show huge increase cases continue decline. Also, good tool new infections, ongoing declines would lag.

Maybe research could get better numbers could useful. hate dismissive think approving, buying, manufacturing, distributing, administering AstraZeneca vaccine anywhere right would massive waste time money. already beaten. Anyone gets likely going need another vaccine anyway, buy, make, distribute, approve better vaccines?

I'm sorry ridiculous me. AstraZeneca vaccine help people get South African variant. Meanwhile Pfizer's, believe Moderna's, function well it. would want faulty vaccine distributed here? gain it? love masks make casual comments gross back used breathe other. That’s ok. Kids 12 rarely issues it. given priority Australia. use check community spread, country single case community makes Australia wide news. become ""touch"" conscious. wear surgical gloves pump gas, public buildings, etc. Keeping habit. alcohol spray gloves without drying hands constant sanitizer usage.

I eating people's birthday cake ever candles it. Nobody blows food ever again.

My work takes hospitals. last time flu, know caught ER reception area. yes sometimes wear masks....I hope people come work sick over. think thought process numbers wazoo want eliminate possibility transmission. Youyang nice projection tool: [Pathway Herd country ~30% total immunity: 90M past infection, 6M vaccine only, overlap 2M total population immunity 98M. seems little high, 33% vaccinated already virus. consider first groups first responders, health care workers, nursing home patients, surprising.

Obviously there's confidence interval margins around these, well thought-out tool. Remember created dozen new agencies increased size surveillance, scope government oversight basically restructured entire world view 2,977 people died one day? Okay don't. I'll enjoying show complaining wearing masks confirm, nerd. They’re upset Swedish variant hasn’t taken world storm. Like deadlier version ABBA. Anecdotal situations. Recovering Covid big deal good immune system local unit [Medical Reserve almost certainly involved vaccine distribution would roles non-clinical volunteers. pretty easy find information Long covid / post viral fatigue syndrome strongly correlated severity infection. vaccines greatly reduce chance getting infected, unlucky enough get infected anyway vaccine guarantees mild case. So, vaccinated means get severe case covid develop long-term symptoms. get inhaler, even insurance $150 one inhaler. Insurance ripoff. life, never found city dwellers average better people non city folk. hate masks something don’t understand. allergies way less severe year flu nothing. 

I run outside mine almost every day. Never problem don’t breathe exhaust pollen! real nice could hoard like every thing that’s suspected help ‘rona it’s preschooler uses nebby he’s issues. Granted, little dude’s healthy horse since hasn’t near booger factories much nearly year, allergy season coming...

Also, it’s COVID, attest fact absolute flip light switch got pneumonia bronchitis issues dealing years back. Within like day went crawling stairs winded shot least able walk go whine wife sick I’m manbaby. much longer? 1 year? 10? 200? think sounds realistic. people get aren’t immune immediately. people understand isn’t 100% effective risk it? Assuming 72% people already wear masks, yeah. believe it. feeling us got already didn’t even know. point, I'm afraid ""boy cried wolf"" scenario, something like tenth variant we're supposed afraid actually winds huge threat, nobody believes it.

RemindMe! 3 weeks 💉💉💉 AZ isn’t “traditional” vaccine either Doesn’t include South African variant (unless missed article). vaccines don’t appear effective variant. stop it’s supposed read U.S. Aussies compassionate use force would necessary. was. You’re subjects, citizens.

Meanwhile a, what, 10% bump average deaths year lived freely. I’ll take trade hard lockdown Australia day. 

Each own. little annoyed thinking everything hunky dory months. Things looking better year going like light switch everything back normal. would people closer strangers? Hahaha. 

Yeah, worst ratios covid world everyone listening staying home. Thats constantly see empty stores without lines crowds people.

Go outside day see self. like constantly see bars full people anything like that. 

In world head virus gone. Let know 3 weeks us right. Friend got Pfizer vaccine. First dose lot aches fatigue, like weather changing two days. Second dose fever three days, chills, hot flashes, aches, fatigue, etc. E. Lives Florida good news.

I assume would one last groups (based CA's age-based system) honestly scratching walls waiting turn get vaccine. least get college years real study SA variant AZ yet hard say. I'm glad options. guess. reason wait even one day, though, think there’s chance won’t approved. anyone earth thinks that’s even remote possibility?

And safe enough inject thousands thousands people vaccine trials, start injections complete approval? one's talking endless restrictions. think reopen early like last summer slow burn cases wait couple months till get Australia/New Zealand level cases snuff (with strict quarantines people coming international hotspots) like australia opposite frozen. helpful, all. I'm convinced immune system reacts harder most, incl. wife. man flu legit.

My colds longer. get fever knocked day I'm good day 3. see wife cold lingers.

The second dose vaccine got hit hard. Fever, chills, migraine, exhausted. well may right, like said there's lot variables.

However, thought people go Superbowl events likely also meeting New Year, Christmas, Thanksgiving, countless private backyard parties, likely large percentage already gotten COVID.

Quite commonly, one member household gets sick, he/she gives everyone household, vulnerable (e.g. elderly) get sick enough require hospitalization. vaccinations prioritized elderly, possible group heavily impacted before.

Finally, there's fact many people strictly isolating throughout pandemic. long continue previous course expect risks go up. worry subset get careless unnecessarily expose themselves, damage quite severe members group exposed COVID way members reckless group been.

EDIT: applaud careful though. slowly transitioning back ""normal"" 2021, along way many people get careless impatient. still good vigilant. Here's frustration...they're saying get vaccine still safe wear masks social distance. Then...what's point vaccine? Reducing someone's chance getting 95% means reduce quarantine 95%, right? I'm talking hanging groups everyone vaccine. 3-4 month period vaccine administered people desperately want it. Throwing people wolves done everything right time would wrong there's sizeable population feel aggrieved restrictions want people suffer. Afterward, becomes personal choice, yeah. Presumably vets (unlike dentists) maintain certification equipment BLS / ACLS case allergic reaction. Generally giving shot easy anyone trained hour -- dealing rare life threatening side effects requires training.

Dentists offices already setup since reaction happen drugs regularly use.   best way help convince people get vaccinated incentivize way. level herd immunity reached summer people country lose minds think right, unless places refuse tell government requires certain vaccines specific risk groups. hope choice. best way show someone love year take restaurant since indoor dining repeatedly linked infections outbreaks.

Best post thread  Thank congrats! really appreciate this. court marriage last summer too! right here. It’s astounding weak whiny considered “tough” now. eyes, tough right thing even consider burden. means wearing mask, protecting others, hitting parties indoor events. Half country become pitiful mess whatever reason there’s lot people know better want way. Yeah, that's stay stay home follow cdc reccomended protocols. Can't get I'm social distancing. weird many people downvoting sensible caution.

That's concerns backed legitimate concerns. like saying ""that's fast \_\_\_\_\_"". result sounds like meme fuel lots prior experience capitalism.

If experience includes manufacturing, know processes optimized result increased efficiency also quality.

I link, guy Pfizer making rounds TV talking went straight development delivery instead normally would terms refining manufacturing process efficient. instead, deliveries shipped, they're refining process. QC standards place. That’s fine please least wear mask that’s actually something you. cotton mask really doesn’t much BLM marches maskless protestors. Thank you! effect first two shots me, imagine I'll end like guy Time Trax got three doses time travel drug.

Oh well, still better getting 'rona considering what's happened friends family got Walgreens CVS first contracted groups vaccinating nursing homes. really appreciate this, wish best June wedding! also hope late spring excitement ""non-lockdown"" summer. east west coast? Bloomberg vaccine tracker, might able scrape it. know sources, looked CDC data. Yeah wording J&amp;J vaccine really feels like bad sales pitch.... hope options. Even means waiting. yes ""People low platelets without symptoms, possible some, vaccine reaction could drop level further, point becomes apparent causing bruises bleeding, Dr. Bussel said.""   ""He paid consultant Pfizer, vaccines drug platelet disorder."" say anyone ""must"" anything. asked person might want go somewhere far away hurry. gave reason. thinking Dentists could help add number people giving vaccines. Pharmacists already give shots. increases number vaccines given. mean, technically are.  First it’s called “while” you’re it, grandma stay home she’s vaccinated like every fragile immune system. thank you, think going go matter what. point, huge weight shoulders Right. know saying 70% herd immunity matters vaccinated sterilizing immunity can’t pass along virus contract it. don’t know case yet. 


If vaccinations reduce hospitalization death 70% vaccination rates enough still strain hospitals death. sub always little off. There's still subset people insist dangerous flu ones insistent vaccine work never end.

It's quite insane facebook, similar vibe sometimes. But... know there's horrible long-term effects Covod... right? seriously thought through. everyone else died. gain weight easily maybe I'll go breathe exhaust days. I’m sure 80% people even NOW. Lol boggles mind people claim eradicate virus...with non-human reservoirs. What, they're going wander every cave vaccinate every bat northern hemisphere?

There's reason we've wiped smallpox (nearly) polio. live humans. Yea I'm forced options Moderna J&amp;J sure. Pfizer AZ yea AZ, guess depend options. Cancer, recklessness, working conditions, nutrition, tobacco. Etc. I’m 32 already got first shot Texas overweight. Texas rules. Canada but, get free samples Dr. Less dosage, like 30 less? paid symbicort literally years. really need explain difference millions people traveling throughout country see family someone going restaurant 15 minutes away home?

Given virus already spread country, sharing indoor space (especially maskless eat, along talking) travel.  Though people live together travelling vehicle, that's indoor too.

However, new variants start make travel issue again, since yet pervasive everywhere yet. believed less similar UK variant. Supposedly first dose worse covid, second dose worse haven't. first shot sore arm. Little worried second one going lay flat day eh, one day feeling meh better getting covid. sounds needy. However I'm following. believe people work days working must board plane days. 🤨 

Planes bad make global heating.  vaccine proven way young children. Probably approved summer. US doesn’t need vaccines bro. got enough leave rest world. still wear mask, make sure hands sanitized still socially distance,"" cautious hugging kissing, says [Dr. William Schaffner, infectious diseases Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""Wear mask, give quick hug around waist, back off. kiss extensively, maintain distance,"" Schaffner 80% people vaccinated get closer herd immunity, urges people satisfied ""half loaf."" Limit quick visit, take walk, sit park bench, wear mask. time, viral variants ones less deadly. goal virus spread order survive, deadlier virus, less “successful” become. Unhealthy hosts still suffer die like see flu, many contract mild symptoms (similar common cold).

Also observer, sister doc MPH tons research virology. California hasn’t locked months. Restaurant dining may banned, didn’t stop restaurants open indoor dining. live, county sheriff made video promised wouldn’t enforce COVID restrictions. I'm thinking developing serious disease cut ahead line. always *someone*, many compare Covid truther legions. told choice economy grandparents ended worst possible outcome thanks total misleadership. Totally agree! easy politicians health advisors say matter...they likely already got shots. I'll waiting better vaccine to. COVID CASES DROP ZERO!! actually even realize nomenclature; makes sense though think it. maybe direct patient contact vulnerable severe illness. Well damn think right, must've clauses pre-purchases happen assuming FDA clearance something. That's would buying experimental therapy mass clinical data published. Otherwise, want new vaccine company wanna go halvsies, I'm split multimillion dollar contract you. highly upvoted article subreddit bloomberg said seven years away end pandemic. Now, tbf, people parroting article downvoted they're misunderstanding article look hashtag ZeroCovid twitter see people op talking half life estimate estimate long vaccine last? be. Heard explained interview virologist radio like this. Imagine whole arm spike protein fingers binding sites allow covid enter cells. mrna vaccines produce antibodies latch onto fingers keep entering cells negating infection. that's place attach. antibodies also attach forearm, knuckles, elbow, bicep, etc. variant may change shape fingers make harder antibodies attach, they'll still attach areas. areas may prevent covid entering cells alert immune system essentially plant flags it. Thus reducing severity infection Take vaccine doesn’t happen. People need listen Dr Americans general extremely selfish guarantee vast majority Americans sub would rather horde every single vaccine 100% population get give others. parents got phiser one hope one Aw, man. tasting comfort food sucks. make easier eat healthy though? lol seen fe comment, perhaps contribute think sufficiently good explanation explain disparity, see good data spike AZ here, conformation pre fusion demonstrate native-like post-translational processing assembly, reveal expression proteins surface cells adopting trimeric prefusion conformation. data presented confirms use ChAdOx1 adenovirus vectors leading platform technology SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Further clue see AZ 100% protection severe, whereas J&amp;J report 85%. can't logical explainer give single example someone saying lockdown forever? I've yet see one posts people seem complain lot. think k 100% NYC infected? I'm going copy/paste part comment made days ago relevant vast majority city Brazilian variant emerged already recovered covid, thus antibodies. Despite this, currently large reinfection rate may due waning antibodies population, may also due new variant resistant antibodies possibility Brazilian variant resistant natural antibodies still explored, confirmed increased infectivity primary concern experts reinfection new variant individuals who've recovered original strain real risk South African variant reasonable assume may continue happen variants Furthermore, cases covid (regardless variant), opportunity mutations new variants emerge idea 'going back normal' heard immunity thru infection absolutely feasible option point. We're going require mass vaccination, continue masking socially distancing. that's what's recommended CDC that's states going by. Nowhere US disqualifying recategorizing patients based whether they've not. much sacrifice people want. vaccine gets everyone needs it, shit better done with. Selfish rich fucks people comment thread advocating zero covid. unachievable goal, attempting would result endless restrictions, least gave up. don’t know long immunity covid infection lasts. think immunity vaccine could effective last longer. Covid infection also increases immunosuppressive factors individuals blunting body’s ability mount immune response.

Also, person could healthcare worker elderly qualifies vaccine current recommendations. There’s recommendation someone previous infection vaccinated. someone received monoclonal antibody recommended wait 90 days. ironic group USA fans China (they group Chinese people dreamed ""a noble American "" ) want family die use political weapon China. Better getting sick incentivized wait know works. get keep money didn’t work professional athletes? follow hockey Connor McDavid Auston Matthews — career years. baseball, Freddie Freeman right start abridged season, rather seriously fact (104.5 degree fever) — proceeded win MVP. quick let's hurry get American next multi-billion dollar federal bailout pinky-swear keep laying thousand employees. tell give steroids try mitigate body's strong immune response virus, called cytokine storm. Since many severely ill people, viral infection itself, body's overly exaggerated immune response causing damage. Steroids depress immune response, downside steroid act systemic level affect entire body, even though lungs getting hit hard patients.

You give inhaled steroids, I'm guessing powerful enough depress immune response sufficiently. new treatment uses tiny particles called exosomes contain active ingredient, difference inhaled directly lungs, exosomes absorbed inflamed lung cells within alveoli. targeted treatment compared systemic steroid treatment. I’m glad qualify sign area. Good luck! Many parks North opened summer. Silver Wood Idaho, Cedar Point Ohio, Six Flags Great Adventure Jersey. unscientific, previous covid exposure part eligibility consideration. hand, taking Ab titers everyone determine eligibility would dramatically slow vaccination effort might well go ahead vaccination. Healthcare workers old people Appreciate clear answer. suspected exactly happens, seen explained well.

Thanks. exactly academic but: good authority Iranian cleric vaccine causes people ""become homosexuals""

Feels legit. People reaching real hard normalize idea masks stay around forever. never going ""snuff out"". disease way widespread that. way places like Autralia New Zealand able get zero cases (a) starting restrictions case levels low (b) extremely strict lockdown, military patrolling streets 24/7 questioning anyone went outside (c) strict border closures. way happening US Europe. Wondered thing. downvoted reason reading it. Americans STILL high? feel bad guys find helpful liken room full people smoking cigarettes. Older people NA especially remember like. Afaik, reduced chance kind weakness exploited. Genetic diversity, individual level population level, *tends to* provide resistance disease. 

Honestly, know actual mechanism would allow covid successful certain people. Could shape receptor maybe missing protein fluid produced receptor. 

Again, one proven yet, seems plausible explanation disparity symptoms, given know genetics predisposition illness. Thanks. 

I COVID December tested antibodies mid January. Plan wait April May get vaccine, given situation I'll sign tomorrow take there. You’ve gotta pretty dense think ND reached herd immunity, considering cases still last summer. friend posts bunch Instagram photos various “quarantine life” related hashtags.

Got example this? “zerocovid” brigade? Otherwise seems you’ve proved point. Unfortunately Moderna’s vaccine less US market now. Moderna doesn’t posses manufacturing distribution capabilities, compared Pfizer available throughout world. hope i’m wrong though. get sick, spread it. study waiting for? vaccines sterilizing. may reduce spread, definitely reduce severity, don’t eliminate virus totally halt spread. 

And everyone acknowledges Covid around decades. got second dose Friday. 
Besides mild headache body aches. reaction.

Plenty co workers harsher reactions. drank plenty water took chill weekend. totally fine. nothing masks, notion wearing masks control pandemic wee bit simplistic. Masks may help, effect modest. humans humans, turned masks religious objects—talismasks, will. 57% long administration vaccine? think means antibodies get vaccine vulnerable populations need got certified administer Botox year ago instructors said used dentists medical professionals grouped together eventually split dentists shorter course already good working needles.

Maybe says something state things think identifying someone Republican efficiently generate negative sentiment. makes incredibly angry.  Let dude stay inside forever, lol. good point, everyone risk option get it. left decided risk getting covid. young healthy people, risk going quite low. reason would can't open time. Thanks appreciate it, I'm waiting hoping best. can't tell hate exhaustion inability taste comfort food more. What? communist country hiding information public? never happens. similar experience– with arm paralyzed pain year's flue shot. Vaccine side effects weird. I'll take million times compared alternative, especially something like COVID. 

Congrats getting vaccinated btw. I'm high risk group (just turned 42 today) live populous county US, point I'm writing summer hoping vaccinated fall. Essential workers elderly. makes incredibly angry. mean Asians less susceptible getting infected Caucasians protein deficiency? I’ve flights still serve beverage food service. bloke next mask half flight sipping drink. 7 doctors? 

They group whistleblowers Dr. Li. one mention them?

Just still alive? Currently living developing country area dependent tourism. personally know people who, point starvation, sure going hungry. [I'd give vid SciShow quick first vid published 1 week ago)

[As well one background mRNA vaccines use mRNA presumably holds both. possible prevent every death covid. tried would end keeping restrictions place ever. think getting level risk level flu reasonable target return normal. Second dose typically worse because, immune perspective, immune response naturally robust much faster (thanks, memory cells!) Basically body says “not shit again!” Ramos antibody production less week, whereas first exposure takes 2-3 weeks peak antibody secretion.

Disturbing much upvoted. NYC one highest IFRs due hit first overzealous intubation time also led increased deaths. overall US IFR .5%. early vaccine effect. I've read opposite, related UK variant; different mutations. I’ll add grey area. looks like peak antibodies weeks recovery, falls off. amount protective antibodies long stay around varies lot person person.

they think there’s still memory immunity things antibodies (your white blood cells) potentially reduce harm get reinfected, varies person person. virus damn chaotic symptoms.

so, you’re bit safer recovered person someone exposure covid, go get vaccine soon you’re eligible don’t know long incomplete protection lasts good new variants.  I’m nurse, got it. Yes, especially taking account variants getting stronger, viruses do, yes STILL people crowding together wearing masks. It’s wrong. don’t need way. many people still don’t take seriously allow virus mutate transmission. got first shot almost immediately pretty severe case covid. 3 days isolation period ended (and confirmed negative test sure). told wait 90 days treated convalescent plasma monoclonal antibodies, otherwise, good go soon clear isolation period.

Do know whether Native Americans exposed coronaviruses Europeans arrived? wait add warm weather, UV, open doors windows, fewer indoor gatherings mix! Honestly despise ad. I'm one use phrase 'tone deaf' often, that's feel it. Seems like we've gone way cycle ads: Initially, advertizers pulled everything together. deep, slow, ""THANK YOU, essential workers.

I hate ad much. normally like Alaska Airlines, screw you, Alaska Airlines. Why? think vaccine resistant strain force us spend another god knows many years develop new one? Exactly. People think variant inherently bad. It’s usually neutral sources/articles lead believe that? nice. going cancun party april, would hate catch covid plane instead club gets funnier everytime people get covid super market super bowl Yes. can't believe people thinking vaccine making dent like, even 2% fully vaccinated. usual, people impatient. Pandemics general take *couple years* resolve. curious, judgments either way. anyone (64-year-old female) felt fear virus, even back March 2020? absolutely think Covid hoax, I'm acutely aware mortality morbidity stats, risk always seemed manageable me. I'm also especially scared death, worry it. weird way?  already widespread, seems impact already felt.

Social life go brrrrrrr outside least LA...sounds right Pzifer? Four family members asymptomatic. Four ""mild” symptoms. four, including myself, got pretty bad. felt glad four develop symptoms. Holy tarnatin' terwillikers! I've kerfuffled twice fortnite! California converted testing centers vaccine centers

I used able drive 10 mins get tested, 30+ appointments hard get live near Knotts. never heard steroid shot tooth extraction. special dentist normally? Hm indeed. Games getting canceled left right still.  They've approved older people lack data. data suggesting ineffective older people. Abscence proof proof absence. went B C correlation case count city know. Mental health socialization 2019. Mental Health exist anymore.

All matters getting even mild covid. even worse, people get asymptomatic covid day. /S Wind chill -20 degrees F today, must say wearing mask outside made inhaling bearable. article joke. China exactly thing vaccine didn’t see fake ass concern trolling it. Ocugen already ran gas. It’ll like BNGO now, hover around 10-15 something happens There's hope, there's near certainty (unless 80 something). Controlled asthma significant risk factor. Maybe reporting match tone taking - is, written way clearly designed cause panic. Someone loose friend group (I’m pretty isolated now) definitely got reinfected.  anyone could would them. socializing like Covid never thing. depends where... California planned vaccinate ""essential"" workers reverted age-based system Sike bud. Los Angeles area. one time go onto sub see best news I’ve heard year. 

I’m done shit. I’m hoping take trip two summer, maybe even massive party masks shit with. I’m ready go back! Yeah you’re right. need break yesterday told whining baby wanting wear mask future. not, honestly I'm surprised stores larger parking lots sqft able get done dentists I've used smaller places small parking lots mostly pick anything close ideal place vaccinations.. manage logistics ppl limits such, especially also patients there.

Drug stores would hell lot easier compartmentalize since like 90% bullshit 10% medicine... plus get eggs milks snowstorms! ;) That’s pretty bold claim, suggest Germany, France, Italy Switzerland data justify decision approve vaccine elderly.  Username check  I’m guessing something U.S. still denial infections begin with. kinda suck here. think important. light end long tunnel feels close, reason put heads sand. news want hear mean vastly important. variants important, they're identified quicker working vaccines get back work end god awful pandemic all. may well close eradicating thing, variants may well cause surges, instead waiting surges happen, atleast brace event numbers begin going again. this? stance long avoid crowds keep sufficient distance, masks provide marginal benefits(and risks) significant warrant making mandates general recommendations them. big issue here, split two camps like US. use can't avoid close-up crowds, first go-to pass full bus crowded shop. seldom crowded experience. 


...but kind libraries visit? think typically excellent air quality routinely cleaned. great place hang out. interesting study. Due political polarization we've basically left reality sides, different degree. happens everything signaling believe rather actual science. seems like make global concerted effort get country South Africa vaccinated first. selfishness downfall...

Edit: vaccinated Pfizer vaccine obviously... Right, longer shortage ventilators. still used severe cases mostly last resort. 

Early pandemic massively overused ended harm good. eeeet!!! Yes, absolutely still used especially people go hill fast. Better quicker testing probably helped starting treatment sooner still people end vents. going boost confidence straight banning ""approved"" information.....do realize antivaxxers already paranoid? confirm ""powers be"" hiding something...because are. 
Putting warning ""go read evidence"" notice least blatantly say ""Hey stupid prole, allowed read that!"" quite loudly. information better silencing bad information...it still spread via email face-to-face, added ""boost"" ""they want know this"".

Does anyone actually look studies people change beliefs? Seeing people know like getting vaccine reporting (almost always mild) side effects honestly would wonders. Sports figures, country musicians, military people, conservatives likely change minds Facebook slapping people down. mean, every sub is? people fascinated something particular, family tree viruses, wild people show interest bunch strains. There's degree risk aversion that's sensible, degree risk aversion that's OCD. chance transmission passing outdoor encounters latter category. enable it, get OCD perpetuity. That's works - incentivize something, get it.

Do yell people gas station touch metal part car filling discharge static electricity stay grounded? That's level Nth-degree risk micromanagement we're talking (and that's probably generous). hit absolute donkey. You’re falling Fox New’s fake news Washington State confirmed 325,000 cases likely many, many cases never tested reported there. 

sorry ""underestimating"" implications less 0.21% infected population getting virus second time Biden celebrations gtfo Good you. Thank you! Came say explained better planned to. Thank well done. Novavax seems like great candidate since requires refrigeration recall correctly actual data shows efficacy vivo vitro Wait, global pandemic? look satellite image see 10,000 on-site parking spots norm. costal cities large parking areas, availability parking purposes people walking stadium get shot. That’s wildly impractical put standpoint turning vaccine drive super spreader event. On-site parking still mile away building. value stadium there’s massive parking lot sectioned many car lines covered vaccine zone give shots windows observation lots accommodate build 20 minutes shots first folks start leaving. Add walking time (and stairs elevators) cars parked easily hour whole thing falls apart. deal medical events 30k people going per day totally unfit people walking long distances, vaccine reactions. Etc. building value proposition NFL 15-20 functional parking lots purpose. new Herman Cain emerged. fear variants continue, long threat neutralized, hope right. Ugh man don’t understand happening .. logistics figured point Literally same. Sore arm two hours first dose got worse night. Woke next morning fine. second dose past Saturday sore arm night, still sore morning quickly felt better. I'm hoping immune system busted. Don’t terrified, prepared. fever chills. I’m 4 days post vaccine I’ve developed small rash arm near injection site. Likely delayed hypersensitivity reaction. It’s super painful itchy anything. Apparently it’s known, uncommon, side effect. make sure Tylenol ibuprofen hand manage symptoms fine! Germany gets 90 million doses Biontech alone year. Biontech. Enough vaccine 45 million Germans. 80 million people live Germany, 50 million need vaccinated herd immunity. course Germany ordered many vaccines. Biontech alone would almost enough already. thoughts lead believe tourism spread virus. Business travel spread virus. International travel spread virus. Humans migrating escape unseen force spread virus.

My thoughts also lead believe never attempted turn flow.

I issues accepting virus stay, go conducting ourselves. swap dose reactions that's me. Markedly increased reaction first shot, second shot fine. headache in. 3 days headache fever sucked.

But autoimmune issues usually days everytime get flu shot. confusing N501Y mutation (shared UK variant, proven much affect current vaccines) considerably concerning K417N E484K spike mutations (which also South African variant, UK variant).

Those ones make South African variant resistant current vaccines, still question here.

You get information differences UK “variant concern“ South African variant Wikipedia N501Y mutation also detected United Kingdom.[5][15] Two mutations found 501.V2, E484K K417N, found Variant Concern 202012/01. Also, 501.V2 69-70del mutation found Oxford isn’t approved America wouldn’t issue here. vaccines approved shown effective. LA pharmacies could it, cvs Walgreens etc pre-super bowl right?/s Vet yes. Paramedics no. Think need Dr. administered it. 

Dentist vet dr thier related fields Thank going back editing looking up—god wish redditors that! I'm talking anything pointing guy seems suggesting. Cus there’s fuck ton people older folks much danger merely overweight can’t get fucking jab.

Nothing still pisses off.  might thinking obvious, sometimes, obvious answer incorrect. Science confirms ""common sense"" useful type science. Sure, low risk outcome COVID. End summer realistic. national goal. Though think it’s little pessimistic.

March things start looking Canada, April things really start quacking off. 4 vaccines, Canada purchased, ready least 2 likely approved summer.

That’s got nothing work health care actively touching people, requirement.

Why? vaccine help bodies develop immunity virus without us get illness. doesn’t prevent spread virus. me. find cases miss leading. depends many people getting tested. test positive tests going get no? Treatments getting better know against. Depends. flown 6 times since pandemic began due work.

As long food beverage issued, everything fine. moment everyone bags peanuts, masks they'll remain rest flight.

I really understand airlines cut costs simply giving food beverage. absurd. immune response symptoms. mRNA vaccines capable causing unique covid symptoms like loss taste/smell. couple years means 2 years. couple years means could last less 2 years.  current COVID-19 vaccines offer protection, may fully stop contracting virus.

It probably lot higher 0.5% New York last spring, medical community completely unprepared. Many early treatments, mass intubation, turned actively harmful driving deaths. We've learned much better treating it. Imo it’s reason became pandemic. brains wired think “feel sick” = “can make others sick”, we’ve mostly managed eliminate chance pandemic terms. virus unique enough completely fucks substantial amount time, sit here. time, leaves confidence future. took Covid helluva special virus get here, it’ll take another equally helluva special virus again- something like flu SARS child’s play.

It’s like opinion matters anyway. speak up? aren’t engaging good faith clearly don’t want hear sensible refutation, fuck dude? What’s major malfunction? regulatory hurdles moment get public’s arms?

Why would need another trial? trials flu shot year. Or, know, didn’t blindly spread misinformation first place...  would expert nutrition purposely choose disingenuousness public desperately needs accurate, level-headed information pandemic? actively resist correction people whose expertise direct his? probably insane variants here. bruh Yup, it’s called half life reason.  vaccines work well mutations covid19. e.g. ""African"" mutation. time there's mutation, repeat whole process. countries stop mutations borders following effective long term strategy.

If go assist/persuade countries trade follow strategy. border control becomes less damaging economy. e.g. China/India seem attempting that. Ok, explains lot. definitely first time experienced kind symptoms flu shot.

The pain went shoulder– the shoulder repaired 20 years ago tearing cartilage. got severe days thought maybe shoulder injury returned. days later like nothing ever happened. act like people aren’t making argument already. aren’t smart making antiquated argument I’ll explain why. 

It’s severity illness. never been. It’s always concern ICU’s capacity. top that, concern get sick aspect long term effects. Star athletes losing scholarships newfound inability exercise half hour without extreme fatigue. People developing conditions thing spreads reaches different kinds people, obviously would want stop aspect illness. stop it? preventing illness causes first place.

It’s fucking simple yet people act like we’re ones aren’t understanding anything here. drives crazy. dare try refute me. You’ll resort back preconceived notions bias relying fallacious cockamamie bullshit. stop talking covid. don’t know you’re talking about. FUCK country decide okay let people idea they’re talking taken seriously do? cares upsets don’t get speak something know nothing about? You’re wrong. **Deal it.** felt like shit 2 months COVID infection. there's always alternative us 27 million documented infected cases. think easily real number could 3x ie \~ 100 million. biden plan vaccinate 100 million end march. suspect virus news cycle much longer march 66% become immune then. think know everything knowing nothing all. alternative untenable civilized world. live large city well. know ppl area one close city it. also find strange interesting. People act like it’s floating around everywhere airborne, don’t see anyone. I’ve signed kids sports, dance, camps, go work, see friends. It’s fine. think gamble worked out. Alarmism catch term used people lacking argument. 
Climate science dismissed many due dire consequences climate destabilisation, crazy. Well they’ll never achieve even keep restrictions forever. Zero covid complete nonsense fantasy. Gee wonder anything government admin actually wants solve crisis rather let rage see might perchance profit it? Nope. I’m 41 year old mom don’t think it’s hoax, mask stores etc honestly worry it. husband terrified, makes sense bc he’s age chooses smoke seems like riskier activity. figure happens, happens I’ll probably ok. Ironically hardly know anyone I’m careful. Hey, Reddit sticker laptop! One us! Right, suspended use vaccine. agree. much cheaper long run make investment upfront many vaccines possible take L. It’s like it’s first time Reddit ... welcome. real information article. reference ? 

Not believe I'd like read something trust random redditor repeating fact. Source, please? Again, understanding line article; immune response SA slightly lower, significantly so. try find iirc saw info leak recently 

But 100% sure AZ ever state solid lab results SA variant. Im extremely confident  Things aren’t normal FYI. it’s still easy interact people different Pfizer Moderna even effective afaik. Correct, BioNTech development production EU. Pfizer clinical trials, approval filing, much manufacturing. Pfizer handles manufacturing US 3 different plants (delineated production) US Missouri, Massachusetts, Michigan. US media, it’s referred Pfizer’s vaccine that’s said Pfizer, BioNTech developers. think agree rest. It’s true, nothing Israel, article Israel. expected(at least expect), but, please, get FYI, redditors, AZ vector vaccine can't easy updated effective AGAIN. every new strain need booster, based yet another vector, a) expensive b) complicated c) may impossible. story russians J&amp;J.

This true..There shown difference anti-spike antibody receiving prior immunisation vector long enough time passed..ffs replication deficient vector, theres temporary immunological memory vector.. *demonstrated* discussed length science sub. SA variant reinfecting people natural immunity. Brazilian P1 strain. 
Vaccination way keep numbers down. known inhaled corticosteroids suppress immune system. immune system overreacting one ways disease kill people. I've sitting small budesonide stash since March case. got Pfizer vaccine shit either dose, except mild pain arm.

Idk stories severe reactions coming from. I've working mobile vaccination team (we drive old people care homes), hundreds 80+ year olds we've vaccinated, one person severe reaction vaccine. tbh, even know vaccine messed up. Might something else entirely, wasnt clear (he really bad rash second appointment). 

Most reported pain it. Maybe moderna works differently, idea. Pfizer one generally fuck people up, experience. country losing thousands people daily, whichever Western ""democracy"" might from. I'm fine refusal like us due delusion implanted propaganda far superior ours. They're also presumably better strains. [Cases Austria still Sort similar Sweden. \~90% population lives southern 40% country. Says you. selfish little neighborhood isn’t whole world. quite people disagree. Furthermore it’s yet clear vaccinated prevents people infecting others. also new variants may prevented vaccines. selfish assholes let little thing like mask stand way making world safer others. UK SA variants increasing number, it’s hidden overall decline. 
Reinfection play increasing role next wave. There's much concern really, reporting trial results messy vaccine works effective, thankfully UK effective variant Kent. prevented hospitalizations would say mission accomplished. 


South African study small concerning making headlines vaccine work all. far know, certain whether stops severe cases South African variant people study younger. 



I hope people assume work would absolute nonsense shame astrazeneca didnt work well... mean nice cheap vaccine lower efficiency symptomatic case, 100% hospitalization death protection first shot... game changer becausr need vaccinate cheaply whole world ($3 per shot vs $30 mrna) otherwise mutated variants keep coming back continents like africa, asia south america. Unfortunately mutations really drop effectivenes lot... mean useless, likely still prevents death mutants, months might useless even worse... actually posibility covid virus changes lot, vaccinations older strains might actually dampen ability create proper immune response? read russian flu 1890 particularly vulnerable spanish flu 1918, also heard similar things vaccines older strain illness body thinks produced antibodies work, reality mutated strain immune, prevent development proper immune response. AZ’s lab testing showed inadequate SA variant iirc,

Can source claim all? goal European countries? country 60% beds free hospital, thought lockdowns overrun hospitals. still, there's curfew spent 2 months school 1 year, probably closed September. AZ’s lab testing showed inadequate SA variant iirc, turned true trials. Moderna Pfizer’s not. It’s absurd statement sorry hear that. Hoping body able recover time - also always room new scientific discoveries this. Stay strong positive!


How process recovering 25% smell / 80% taste? got back first weeks? estimate also comes low end discussion too. long consensus ""true infections"" somewhere around 3 8 times much actually gets caught reported testing, depending availability testing severity outbreak given area. think time goes testing improved, probably move closer closer lower end 3x. certainly months past, spring summer surges, probably much high end. 

So basically I'd say almost surely 71 million infections estimated model, there's fair chance too. surprised learn almost third country caught thing point now.  Duh Initial infection probably roughly efficacy vaccination. really shouldn’t causing panic. 95% leaves holes rare cases we’ve seen accounts fact certainly rare cases falling cliff manner strongly suggests overwhelming majority prior cases immune. Don’t rule natural immunity many places getting huge numbers infections According quick Google search average income india $4.90 day. I'm sure price lot better considering. get post-quarantine testing; capacity, can't argue logic.

But what's point testing someone going quarantine, five days last negative test? know efficacy impact Pfizer/Moderna given trials, lab tests. lab tests confirm antibodies still work, reduced effectiveness significant. think translate efficacy. asked structural question.. I'm structural engineer :) minor apparent overlap though!

Of course ask N-glycosated Asn's located.. evenly distributed throughout, mainly RBD? I'm guessing RBD.

The thing stood prior articles linked coronavirus longest RNA positive-sense genome.. period. think length ~27kb makes mutable? analogy V12 engine (DNA) straight 6 engine (RNA) equally long crank shafts, happen longest found civilian cars. shaft subject similar degree twist, V12 runs much smoothly errors balanced also distributed across larger number cylinders, meaning stability. long RNA length naturally lend ""twist""? know RNA/straight 6 leads less stability compared DNA..if yes, seems ideal mutations, 1% change bigger 1%. 

The autoimmune *potential hopefully top concern. Unfortunately FDA plans fast-track future boosters.. understand touchy situation due transmission curves I'm hoping continue vigilant.

Yeah, completely justify time forums encounter excellent explanations given, also mechanism completely avoid ""news"" still understand bit what's going :D thanks expertise ... Yep. worst part it’s exactly bullshit said non-N95 masks didn’t work early stop run masks. They’re pretending know obvious it’s convenient social-engineering world without people lying vaccinated things, it’s real harm. reason people keep repeating people still spread virus even vaccination, fact? Almost vaccines stop transmission. bc vaccine yet proven (because it’s still studied) mean opposite true ! fact little point kinds statements, yet people keep repeating over, enough times ppl decided that’s proof enough. &amp;@#% lol typing like that? Erm. No.

The new one dominant one dude. Moderna vaxx side, hell handbasket. done years ago Plus close 25-30% population covid probably immune already. We'll virus cornered eventually. Moderna Takeda Pharmaceutical provide vaccine Japan, country ordered 50 million doses, available May so. Vaccinations expected begin Pfizer's month. Mask mandates definitely driver pandemic fatigue. people vaccinated, won’t mask. shouldn’t. anyone says otherwise idiot antisocial/radical introvert business participating discussion.  Shitty headlines like get clicks. That’s reason why. Lol bullshit weird, daily cases drop globally now. it’s Flaming lips concert everyone’s big hamster ball hamsters gently bump hamster ball, enough like moshing? 😜  Comparing plague seriously stupid. SARS-CoV-1 closest relative virus, longer exists anywhere earth one hand US 10%+ vaccination rate already witnessing weekly drops

On hand Israel reached 60%+ vaccination rate number new cases refuses go down...

This confusing... Moderna Biontech vaccines work better South African variant. herd immunity might work using vaccines, especially get booster shot South African variant.

With AstraZeneca, clear vaccine effect South African variant all. Certainly herd immunity variant possible vaccine, can't sure yet even protects got vaccine. started sequencing two weeks ago, every lab it. Fomite transmission **statistically** low probability. dying car accident. still wear seatbelts, still happen.

Wash hands. Wear masks. No, people want risk getting sick live lives. However, Pfizer develop vaccine; Biontech did. January last year, developed 20 vaccine variants days reduced 4 variants March. signed contract Pfizer execution study production. Biontech also produces vaccine, Marburg (750 million 2021). addition, contracts signed Baxter companies production. Biontech holds exclusive rights patents vaccine. Il one step further. AZ’s data showed massive loss efficacy SA variant, tried spin it. Moderna found theres still functional. Again, maybe take face value dude, AZ’s ineffective, Moderna Pfizer not. Simple that

Just following discussion, must say absurd statement make based data available. Pfizer/Moderna vaccines simply effiacy tested yet, that's end it. idea well actually work.  won’t need shutdowns masks eradication. push cases low individual cases contacts *all* quarantined vaccinated effectively, assume people stronger symptoms going eager share them. may Ischgl 2.0, even lifted lockdown Austria.

You're looking every small sample size MILD disease this.

There zero data severe disease hospitalisations. say ""useless"" factually incorrect. Yes, well America whole different breed stupid. Stock paracetamol ibuprofen, take dose prophylactically evening get second.

That's advice I've gotten number people who've already second dose, I'm days first. first shot 67% effective. second increases 95%, also likely effectiveness antibodies prior infection (which rEiNfEcTiOn hype dumb hell. there’s 1/20 risk second exposure quashed immune system, course you’ll find second cases, they’ll mostly mild asymtomatic very, precious exceptions).  wildly misleading headline? Reddit? subreddit? Shocked tell you. UK government started financed studies, said next area concern pandemic control. 

They looking impacts are, long last, also put warnings case (I dislike link called study, case study lack information probably best take nothing roll - again, know, next month reported need triple masking, Tylenol efficacy + left arms better right arms -- proud y'all taking vaccine + thank you! might wanna need calendar know 2021. 4 weeks. antibody levels peak 49 days, there's good chance efficacy could even higher one wait long enough. also find half drunk bottle wine 2 years? clean bedroom disgusting creature! think cancelled trial South Africa. paused rollout, sure next. Well, Moderna's Pfizer's seem effective, use two weakest, AZ young people. mean. AZ still reduce symptoms... Ineffective zombie variant. little late. Facebook started antivaxx movement. let fringe conspiracy theorists organize recruit site en masse 15 years now, facilitated transformation weirdo tinfoil hat cabin woods type thing credibility legitimate movement.

Zuck blood thousands hands. die Covid and/or someone know refuse vaccine, immunocompromised kids kids who’s parents turned antivaxx last 15 years. Facebook must held accountable. watching David Muir last night wife. watch see different angles this. course grim I’m looking 77k cases registered day lowest daily count *months*. wife nervous told can’t get upset if’s, could happen. We’re staying masked, limiting trips, washing hands. Vaccines rolled consistent climb numbers day. 

Even though lot numbers first shot, said, it’s like they’re injecting water. still provides protection. don’t get 95%+\- effectiveness second shot, understanding least. chance, link articles studies suggest data you’re referring response? I’m curious find interesting cases SA decreasing much though variant said much transmissible. lockdown imposes nationwide curfew closures leisure spots that’s it. would like look possible.

Not that, SB stadiums (except one Florida) filled nothing empty seats cut-outs. Sorry, opinion worth considering! could went socialistic way helping pay it. would rather giving italy spain free money without checks. Yeah, year pandemic, we're used seeing two numbers together. disease implied throughout conversation Type 2.

No one ever mentioned Type 1.

But yes thank reminding type 1 exists.

I considered that. ""it is"" - 45 think conceptualized thoughts rather well. won’t be. never realistic scenario. People (except tiny rich assholes) don’t travel SB overwhelming majority people watch home families. “super bowl party” trope really exaggerated general.

To put perspective, holiday pandemic long actually register legitimate spike cases couldn’t statistically attributed catch-up reporting people working getting tested actual holiday/holiday weekend Christmas. Even thanksgiving ultimately smoothed long-term curve developing around time period. July 4th, Memorial Day, Labor Day, etc effect all.

It’ll another 4th July scare again. People talk doom hellfire next 2-3 weeks *inevitable* spike coming SB, never come, they’ll either try gaslight believing happened numbers show otherwise they’ll try turn attention next Harold Camping-esque covid prediction.

This cod shit. essentially 1/5 likelihood rest us catching again. mention severity however article study this, ""Not doctor"" guess less severe also catch it. guess talking 300k city middle nowhere, creates local spike population density. known extreme temperatures, -30 C (-22 F) winter, occasionally getting low -50 C (-58 F). Would vet able handle possible complications, like allergic reactions? Northeast. state's restrictions essentially last June. 

I hope there's plan drop course month long metrics hold, weather starts improving people going say ""Eff this, I'm living life again"" regardless state says. I've two doses Pfizer, middle work day. Worked immediately side effects besides normal sore arm. hopefully happens you. 

 means future investigations focus laboratory incident potential cause outbreak. AZ looks worse variants (SA, possibly Brazilian). Italy cases Brazilian variant, end hospitals like happening, put risk weaks. They're protected Pfizer/Moderna

They'll using n=30000 US trial probably show good efficacy. It'll get approved.

RemindMe! 2 months Depends. 

With overall efficacy 95% modern vaccines mandatory vaccination could eliminate COVID-19 five years. 

But big pharma bureaucrats responsible COVID-19 EU/UN/WHO/US/ whatever best outcome. prefer COVID-19 forever Yes, lower risk grocery  UK like 300mn doses non-AZ vaccines order (with \~60mn RNA coming next 3-4 months) not? people don’t want acknowledge taking care mental health lead big improvements physical health it’s important aspect consider. It’s understandable, though, since chronic illnesses really sap mental energy harder overcome. Moderna manufacturing Switzerland since last summer.

Article continues mistake thinking Singapore easier 

Never said that. use past tense all. remotely relevant anything said.

Rich micronations like Singapore (or Luxembourg, etc.) simply exist without patronage real nations. value judgement; observation--do grow enough food feed themselves? quarry steel lands build skyscrapers? No, not. ultimately dependent vast lower classes toiling away countries. 

For reason, endless attempts shame USA issues involving lower classes ironic. Irrelevant saying, deeply profoundly people America speak one language

And go, displaying ignorance nonsensical take see. 

A common language (spoken home, public sphere) **cornerstone** melting pot. value judgement; fact. (You're free believe melting pot model inferior wish, still fact.)

Separatist, respectful multiculturalism, practiced many countries, melting pot. Singapore separatist philosophy less melting pot, comparison USA. (Though less countries could think of.)

Multicultural systems language respected held equal, like say Quebec-Canada former union Czechia Slovakia, obviously conducive melting pot.

Again, consider bad good fact. extremely obvious emphasizing respecting differences cultures less motivation converge common language (for home well school/work) results less cultural mixing often/eventually separatist sentiments. happened again, particularly Europe. Though separatist feelings much less likely arise prosperity authoritarianism... Singapore undoubtedly safe that.

The rest race-baiting virtue signal crap nothing whatsoever I'm talking about. (Oh yeah claim studying cultures ""isn't even offered"" American schools, ahaha. That's Russia-level propaganda there. Multicultural stuff starts kindergarten.) a) trying negotiate price. shameful EU. EU US pay.

b) based decision opinion ""so called experts vaccines, viruses immunology"". shameful. summer, we've understood, thow experts know nothing ignored. EU US buy everything available 2021.

c) begun specific european games. ""Biontech bad, Germany firm"". ""Pfizer Moderna bad, US"". ""Sanofi good, French firm on"". Slovakia number reliable. antibody dropout, PCR testing. It'll end much lower. least it’s safe say majority decade pandemic times [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Mirror: got Pfizer one got second shot weekend. far know, haven’t covid. First dose, arm slightly sore next day bit sluggish. Easy recovery. 

The second shot way different. arm hurt almost immediately (on arm first). end day body aches headache felt like start flu. touched head hurt. next day rough. slight fever aches everywhere, pounding headache night shaking chills. woke next morning (about 40 hours shot) drenched sweat, feeling better think today (60+ hours shot) feel like again. tried advil aleve various points. Aleve worked much better it’s worth.  likely wrong. reduce transmission significantly. Besides, immune escape variants becomes issue, it'll probably stopgap measure towards end year, still get mRNA vaccine shot.  hope so. sure correct see. saw another thread: evidence SARS-CoV-2 leaked past China laboratory incidents regarding SARS.  general seem less effective mRNA vaccines. Even immune escape variants similar among vaccines, could still leave mRNA vaccines better residual/spare effect. remaining effect could sufficient AZ Sputnik. Oh yes, Israel, famous extremely humane treatment people colour territories occupying. Yeah, first thought...oh - well that's *South African* variant...

Yep, talked stepsister got shot (she literally didnt want army made get it'd hard lie about) stationed Korea, covid actually going around small outbreak stationed, removed comment stating false. Really rubbed wrong way. ... BioNTech Pfizer. Facebook needs start allowing authentic news agencies labeled news. rest either advertising, opinion, public relations, etc -- news! schedule? much important, raw numbers. do. CDC said 6% covid deaths result covid, others one multiple comorbidities late age groups. take deaths 75 already life threatening medical conditions death rate plummets. proven virus jumped multiple species, thats one hypothesis. Cold weather large portions US acting like mini lock down. Plus actual snow many areas forces people home days there. Doesn’t matter anyway. middle next year pandemic likely painful memory developed world complete lack evidence evidence leaked lab. evidence amounts people education qualifications saying it’s possible.

Facebook loaded YouTube videos misleading information vaccines covid {period} am. genetics work isn’t personal opinion. Good us all. Moderna/Biontech

I hope CureVac effective too. China SARS lab leaks past, need make sure happen again. We’re aware uneducated conspiracy theorists pushing nonsense. 

We’ve aware years people used social media sites push nonsense. 

Believe me, we’re aware. 

Some us want see punished. us want fix better education. us want remove platforms help spread. aren’t aware deal them, we’re definitely aware existence. long second dose peak immunity? know fairly organized effort Netherlands, well communicated publicly. inform policy. example provide sanity check unreliable case numbers Christmas/end year. Also tracks (thankfully) slow infiltration UK variant. Speak mate Why? data says case.
Your skepticism bearing upon reality. are. time also state still need wear mask 95% effective. I'm fine either way. hope CureVac game changer soon. Idk man. That’s life sometimes truly surge coming new variants, understand CDC refuses discuss better masks, better ventilation, push public improve health. Yeah it’s pretty small. must inflexible attitude. Genetics really don’t anything actually dentists seen big uptake patients! Supposedly whole.breathing mouth wearing mask speeds decay. still can’t even comprehend y’all deal numbers. Australia haven’t even clocked 30k cases total. entire pandemic. even 1k deaths. cannot fathom trauma challenges ahead yall country. It’s tragedy healthcare worker, I’m sorry experience this. I’m sorry people passed away one side, people unable removed homes passing, healthcare workers make ultimate decision - decisions doubt haunt forever. one day Melbourne hit 700 cases day sat computer cried. brain can’t get around numbers guys get way people, it’s quite incredible scale. hope many many takers vaccine truly keep pushing numbers down. Good luck may you, families loved ones stay safe.  going reduce severity infection, correct?? girlfriend extremely COVID-19 fatigued got second dose. get mine Friday. wants go Colorado (we live NJ) see friends. want stay home pandemic variants there. Plus, feel like likely get infected variants, transfer friends, even vaccinated. want believe wants go eat. wants things back normal. pessimistic realist. still feel like attack. able eat restaurant now. travelling stupid. can't seem make understand. vaccination better vaccination. Also true AZ useless SA. seen anyone claim IFR less 0.2% read academic consensus population like US Europe IFR 0.4-0.8%.

I'm sure exactly insurance gets work lives/works low income part Michigan. basically cover absolute bare minimum unless force further. we're looking grants hospital state also trying apply Medicaid. worst case scenario file bankruptcy :/. Yes, say earth flat, make true.

Israel zero presence Gaza. FFS, stop bitching AZD1222 B.1.351 variant. CD4+ immunity still intact @ 76 87 antigens waiting preprint confirm, humoral immunity end-all be-all. read article specifically mentions occupied Gaza. It’s good hopeful articles change.

Yes, point pandemic end. Even covid never truly goes away, vaccines make manageable point learn live it, like live yearly flu. Effective treatments development well.

People disagree positive outlook: Please don’t lie yourselves. Stop making excuses lock room never come out.

I doubt even truly afraid virus. think many use excuse social anxiety don’t want live life. say sincerity: **please seek help.** don’t need like this.

God help young folk deprived good life mental health woes. It’s virus. problem internal everybody knows it. I've saying long time. much stuff people/companies look 'safe' nonsense. Maybe. Certainly would nice! may still another surge, taking get people vaccinated variants gaining traction. However, definitely making progress least able lot summer earlier. may agreement metric is, agreement flexible metric here.

For me, based hospitalizations deaths. I'm vaccinated, I'm pretty done even virus still spreading since zero evidence spread ever really stopped. Ive always curious this, forgive weird place ask. wonder, immune period, someone exposed virus again, immunity extended? Like booster sorts? baiju sounds pretty good. hey doc, ever get verified? 😉 testing down? excited died? Seems like love it. tell enemies! wonderful guess. think it’d big cross bear. 

I'm fine taking cross. Open schools option distanced learning overly concerned parents. data support keeping school closed.

Both kids in-person learning since August moment's thought it, data says fine. fine. ""This shit never going end""

500 million vaccine doses available summer.

Ok. TL;DR. virus endemic impossible vaccinate enough people animal vectors worldwide eradicate it. Even developed countries get close mutate poorer countries access vaccines. reasonable thing change expectations. hospitals woods deaths dropped pandemic over. That's sterilizing immunity is. Damn :( Ok translate action? words people act information unknown? Sure, two papers adenovirus based vaccines. vaccine. also mice. second paper talks nothing IM vaccination terms data, quoted discussion, I'm even gonna talk 2nd paper.

The 1st paper mostly devoted proving nasal administration vaccine provides sterilizing immunity. almost barely compares IM injection vs IN. data produce shows difference IgA apparently detected virus (I able determine talking looked figures 3x see data talking about). vast majority paper also seeks establish vaccination barely looks IM vs IN. Also maybe 10E10 viral exposure illicits response allows replication virus IM vaccinated individual. really convince though A) that's unnaturally high exposure B) really look virus actively replicating C) look virus alive level virus people expelling. point is, sterilizing immunity proven disproven vaccines currently market, despite mouse based adenovirus paper says. variant already one state, already game real question many cases/positive tests per day/month reinfections... number single double digits vanishingly rare. people headline readers. ""CDC Says Reported Cases X"" taken gospel. Articles like ""Model Estimates 3x"" may see well. Try argue could 4x 5x oh boy... trouble. 

Apart headline readers only, good majority people also understand models/algorithms work either. also STEM background built model based available data unknown variables. hard, models good data put it. probably mix things including spike, vector, dosing. talking drug testing. can't always correlate 1:1 what's happening test tube what's going humans. That's expensive risky. see high stakes 'failure' AZ vaccine. could anything. Plot twist gums. SA variant causes issues vaccines Brazil variant likely same. Like know AZ effective stopping symptoms SA variant would apply Brazil variant. people want go back fun parts pre-covid, agree bad things left out. hearing me: people going back normal, virus change that. They'll accept bad outcomes vaccines available.

Someone saying they're going back normal summer probably going changing date.... Numbers still going encouragingly though. hopefully months, skid row tenderloin district, come! Bahhhhhh hahaha.....


Bahhhhhhhhh hahaha hahaha




Hilarious Thank god interpret. don’t list one thing death certificate.

For example, ignore covid altogether. Person breast cancer, eventually dies hospital pneumonia. important.  count pneumonia death breast cancer death.

So always case people get counted multiple times.

It’s weird/dodgy thing happen covid.  It’s find links.  people covid susceptible dying sudden strokes, prove cause death mentions stroke covid.

Their argument usually “but died car crash?! It’s obviously related!!!”  could be. Took cold meds operated heavy machinery.  coughing fit behind wheel. Including covid death certificate could help researchers see whether driving risk.  It’s probably big one, tell unless way count?

The next argument probably “okay, wasn’t link, car crash absolutely non-related, they’re still counted covid death”.  Yeah.  Happens every single disease.  Maybe breast cancer patient always going die pneumonia it’s “inflated” breast cancer stat. That’s works.  covid isn’t counted differently disease. confirmed superspreader events planes? seems masks ventilation quite effective. I'm talking without insurance, too. use GoodRx. article: indication virus spreading Wuhan December 2019, investigators said.

What think needs stood public? Hep A,B vaccines 0, 1-2, 6 month intervals.

HPV 0,1-2, 4-6 months. still know sure though AZ prevents hispitlisations thr SA variant. Since even prevent symptoms prevents hispitlisations could still good enough atleast get booster shots Hey everyone 😊 it’s cannot read well. 
You think escape zoonotic virus means must created using gene splicing. need brush reading critical thinking skills. 
I note you’ve moved goal post ‘scientists’ ‘experts’. exactly meant.

When get vaccine vulnerable groups would vaccinated...so protecting anyone else...and I'd protected vaccine...why would continue distancing point? I’m birthday party son. gave birthday last year. two missed ones. Damn, vaccine trial participant **health worker** antivaxxer living together. make sitcom you. wild overlapping CI study arms means there's difference two. Well set yearly cycle updated vaccines guess coronavirus would set similar timeline. know either moderna pfizer already working updated vaccine account SA variant.

And know trials guess, I'd say vitro testing. wants go party done vaccinated. can't stop that. could add literally dozens similar links, mostly Russian, confirm conclusion Spiegel:

*Probably vaccine good effective, data related efficacy side effects full mess.* data going get. There's going another 14k patient phase 3 trial this. There's simply not.

And let's talk small sample size results. something like 19 cases vaccine arm 24 cases placebo arm. thing larger study going help statistical significance (are numbers 19 24 really different true value identical chance--in words 'real' result).

Let's say larger study tells real result. even clinically significant? anyone really happy vaccine that's 19 infections vs 24 placebo?

Put together bad news. SA government right move away AZ vaccine think legit scientist would blame them. alive inherently unsafe activity. could spend day dwelling 1,000+ ways could die day, accept there's always chance move on. ignoring 100-ish million already natural immunity, also ignoring least one vaccine likely coming online well increase production/supply existing vaccines. seems lack willingness among scientists admit immunity infection happening larger scale. think overreaction anti-vax talking point people get immunity getting infected recovering, obviously moronic idea. clearly immunity recovering Covid, even strong vaccines there's concern re-infected variants (though there's reason point think people re-infected SA variant still protected severe disease) That's nah me. Lol, whining able go restaurant 10 pandemic accusing people historical rich.  Novavax J&amp;J studies South Africa? I’ve wondered since didn’t much response Pfizer vaccines. don’t know says immune system. I’ve working Covid ICU past year I’ve exposed kind infectious pathogens multi-drug resistant organisms years without getting sick. I’m hoping strong immune system would think case, would really robust response. Yh evidence yet show stop severe illness far presumption. Unfortunately small trial South Africa showed stop symptoms full young healthy adults. representative sample honesty. think South Africa looking decide still help since course dominant strain South african variant countries want require quarantine block travel UK that's them. e.g. USA. actually fucking loled come Asians Britain US hit hard it? remember reading something NIH study found that, healthcare workers, controlling job role, Asians likely test positive white workers. Uhmmm... 1-1.5% chance death enough you? Someone failed risk-benefit analysis. part alluded to? Invasive medical procedures might permanently damage lungs?  hospital stay either ICU quarantined area?  suffering long Covid syndrome last months years?  getting sick?  aren’t complete selfish ass care around you? divert medical resources already burnt medical staff care lowering chance transmitting virus others. people still pretending IFR &lt; 0.2% cases vastly overreported? realize two conclusions quickly contradict eachother, right? guys better love new requirements like 9/11 aren’t going anywhere Aight cool, enough us get mutates Read article again. tested different variants, make effort point one B117. Totally. people 20s 30s vote large numbers, bet politicians find excuse bring front line too. statistics based universal seat belts..... per si, wouldnt put belief what's based theology, secure scientific method. I'm mean, outdated like classic physics outdated Einsten relative physics on. Yep ""you still spread 1/100th much vaccination"" ""you still spread it"" technically true statements. media can't report anything degree though... everyone sub chance dying today choking ice cube. big chance there's chance. Read article again. tested different variants, make effort point one B117. Probably poised leading Covid virus US sometime March, I’ve hearing. checking oxygen levels? Happy hypoxia thing covid. make sound like opening schools directly causes kids die. really simple. Kids teachers die whether schools open closed. fact hardest hit places country located areas kids school almost year. think missing point completely. want wash hands that's fine means large scale place spent tons money resources unnecessary risk reduction expensive efforts towards actually matters acting like they're super responsible. proof mRNA vaccines “helpless” variants? expect natural immunity last around 5 months: huge “protests contingent” country stall reforms..One going right :( Right, fast that? human trials vitro testing? mean is... guess people know.

[Covid-19: Study showing Oxford vaccine slows virus spread overwhelming majority people watch home families. “super bowl party” trope really exaggerated general.

And people would go friends house watch would probably already contact friend somewhat often past 10 months anyway, nothing really changed distancing either.  mean, I'm parent data reassuring me. kids vanishingly small chance succumbing disease, though possibility. them, within range risk must take flu year (though get flu vaccine family try help). 

I've said people like reply version ""it's statistic kid"" gross assumption 1:100 even 1:1000 statistic somewhat rare medical occurrences (we been, including newborn flu). types things cost human. side effects feeling little tired usual arm sore. boyfriend. Hopefully side effects mild too! Vaccines rolled countries high rates death, countries locked still locked burning (at least killing old people/sick people perspective). mean gets point passed around kids younger adults ICUs full flu. dreams!! weird dreams doses. first arm hurt bad super vivid dream turned black fell off. Second dose fever/chills x24 hrs fine except tinnitus x4 days. mean like Joe Biden promised '$2k checks door' Senate victory Georgia, **February 9th** Dem-led Congress means-testing $1400? This, along multiple states kicking people unemployment? That's help? pony want lockdowns bad instead waiting government help people stay home, since seem disinterested? appropriate response ""if get shot know spread virus not"". They've made calculation teachers vote seniors do. sarcastic?

It depends number people plane/in car, average, passenger planes better per passenger*mile cars.

The environmental issue people traveling long distances almost mode, airplanes.  people around world wear without forced

Nobody issue this. mandates must end date. 

Look, certain point vaccinated. matter courtesy I’ll even stay home period second dose reach full immunity returning usual social scene.

That said, reach point, fucking force wear mask. dare you. fuck wrong would think this? Everything situation fucked up. I’d much happier everyone wore mask spread truth deadly virus. ""swine flu"" related/the strain one caused pandemic? I'd heard that, sure true is. Exposing kids larger groups people going increase likelihood they'll contract virus. increase number cases create opportunities virus kill them. common sense. people get it, people die get deathly ill. Especially hospitals become overrun area.  Hee hee hee...so funny science downvoted would try particularly hard avoid seeing least dozens studies subject come last months.  ""There currently evidence people vaccinated spread virus. any?"" holds true vaccine rollout goes smoothly new (more contagious) variant(s) don’t cause huge spike next 3-6 months. Vaccines need stay ahead new variant, new variant spreading exponentially...we head start cannot squander it. exactly see ending basically turn thing flu less start live normal lives again. 98% effective, 2% vaccinated become symptomatic. Also, theory mine, bet people vaccinated might act reckless think immune. could explain it, work finance, could wrong lol. Sadly true right now, I'm still optimistic countries open spring, higher vaccination rate warmer weather. Remember, politicians, like Macron, said summer 2nd lockdown would impossible. make heel-face turn like previously, start talking mental health crisis educational results drain etc. takeaway headline well. sounds like bad overall news 3 % deaths vaccinated people, though hopefully already infected got vaccine, caught shortly afterwards, full doses + wait time (did actually RTFA). civil. Absolutely, totally agree points! Congrats beating infection, congrats getting vax. :)  plenty people setting foot medical facility even seeing doctor COVID. 

So, efforts underreport infections previous administration, folks avoided medical facilities formal form testing. could asymptomatic well - way test/track instances. we?

My state today looks nothing like back April comes closures restrictions. fully back normal today, there's really nothing can't large gatherings long willing abide wearing mask capacity limits establishments. hope school back full person spring break. whole staff chance vaccinated then. I’m probably one educators want kids back ASAP. But, think offer sort virtual learning next year, going hard time getting families kids back building. Still waiting details gonna feed, house, isolate support 100 million people U.S 12 months straight vaccine became available. 

Oh wait, never plan. wanted let risk death could go life. Dude said lots people got Christmas, that's Valentine's day, super bowl, Halloween. drop continues faster past despite people's behavior relaxed (it is) conclude due immunity. This. chances died due Covid slim based information.

Unfortunately people use justify lockdowns restrictions. wait valentine's day spike.  want true it’s guarantee you’d bother read statements informed people topic. Covid testing free insurance. I’m sure aren’t flying without health insurance.  need get point we’ve got herd immunity

It’s becoming increasingly clear herd immunity far ambitious goal considering percentage population would need vaccinated. think best-case scenario getting maybe 70% US take vaccine. Hesitancy anti-vaccine sentiment rampant extremely difficult combat communications strategy. Better set reasonable goal reducing yearly Covid deaths roughly similar number flu heard orgies. Virus work way, unless referring sort heard immunity. LMAO nothing left back statements news articles. find data Lancet, BMJ post comments actual data.

curious though, part make up? true effects vaccinations yet seen, start effect numbers plummet. thought going lockdown, wear masks avoid till end time. happened? twice many deaths per capita neighbor told daughter return vaccinated even means staying home next year something schools need think planning. 6 might 2022 time approved age. Schools need decide long willing offer online option. brink every day....except Fridays Saturdays - usually drunk hungover dont time brink Right, conversation had. lived state, could go visit outside w/ mask. Since chance spread (presumably), people act like understand people's outrage people say still cautious. Good luck degree! left money grandchildren used travel. found world travel opened mind heart anything else I've done experienced life. get chance, maybe stimulus money go back pack around country choice. change life! No, point pandemics who's primary transmission vector traced cats. cats can't get humans sick, cats exist right conditions pandemic start first place. 

Epidemic/pandemic diseases start populations high density spread easily right conditions epidemic spread. species lower populations, want ""burn hot"" disease run hosts quickly. overcrowded conditions, like cave full bats, inhumane factory farms, densely packed human slums, reach critical mass disease's best chance achieve massive success become infectious possible always hosts. Since cats live small enclaves, densely packed caves, right conditions create sustain epidemic disease ""jump"" humans, odds low disease would ""jump"" cats jump humans - odds one jump low, stretch two jumps without time infecting secondary species. should’ve happened way earlier. think telling people nothing changes vaccination already done good amount damage mass vaccination effort. you’re low risk yourself, you’re told still spread vaccination, nothing changes life vaccination, would get vaccine? Glad least making changes now, though, think demand issue sooner think. presume lot way think, article represent think I've communicated here. think know 3% comes from. Pfizer trial one person got severe case even though person fully vaccinated. could explain it. least looks rare. mention people assaulted reddit

lol Israel like 20% fully vaccinated, look death per million though. USA much COVID go Israel. would bet 20% total population more. Non-edited headline:  Never Reach Herd Immunity?  threshold might actually impossible. vaccines still help end pandemic.  I’m done chat. you’re making shit up. Bye now. interested see history say situation. past pandemics guide, significantly overstated fatality rate underestimated many people it. went ""Swine Flu"" originally estimated fatality rate 3-5% eventually revised 0.01%. trend happening people 18 months sounds like lot normal year pre-covid, 300-350k people die nursing homes, 30-60k die flu, 2800k people die causes. 600k sounds like lot needs kept perspective. Statistically 18 month period, 488k people die nursing homes average non-Covid causes (infection, sepsis, etc).

I never understood anyone thinks fatalities counted even remotely accurately, could either high low. new disease doctor ever seen people die average 3 serious comorbidities (cancer, heart disease, diabetes, etc). enough tests test died. Countries regions changed methodologies time, like UK changed theirs. anyone think numbers even remotely accurate? Probably mix brigaded people blindly listening ""experts"". Either way, sad Kind hard get accurate numbers doctors murdered reporting truth. also culled entire herds. joining contact tracing firing squad? Oh well, grandma got sick, gotta kill family now... Agreed. people listened advice time. bring good point. hallucinations cramps too, aches hot flashes got vaccine mild comparison. really wanted people know working getting vaccination might best idea would go 1000000% meant getting covid again. ...gotta wait til enough people vaxxed numbers observed - data, will. Ever wonder crazy anti-science conspiracy theorists made? Check comment section here. Authorities obviously lying! paid off!! Scientific method trustworthh claimed ‘there evidence [something later found true]”. isn’t weird scientists never say something 100% true? means lying!! don’t want responsible claims lies exposed!!11!!! Jesus freaks Twitter getting info wonder - hope therapy helps. Missing senior year must suck. Hopefully able spend time friends summer. best college! I'm betting social dynamics change dramatically post Covid. kinda like we're getting solitary confinement. Mom actually got different sized ones. Mine looked like photocopy original template, annoying looks fake lol. tried get tech re-do went second shot refused.

Anyway, able cut edges mine make smaller mine little bigger credit card. fit cardholder slot bigger wallet, might fit money part. sure originated US would discovered

Hard doubt friend. also evidence Italy extremely early well. matters China first real response pandemic started, thats originated. Hence death toll. sharpest tool shed. can't say I'm surprised. “Old society doesn’t suit personality. change suits personality”. That’s comic book villain style thinking  sentence even mean?

Most Super Bowl stadiums? Except one Florida?

Huh?

There's one Super Bowl stadium. one Florida. specifically Tampa. Glad got it, bit reach. idea herd immunity via infection already debunked extensively. wish could stick fork all. Community transmission much significant. Israel 74 cases 100k. US 40 cases 100k. Israel double rate infection. 

Take look chart see clearly. takes significant spike cases suck O2 results cases plummeting. Depending herd immunity losers bet shown data.

The vaccine effective see impact, also may see short term negative impact vaccine well. Families gatherings may celebrate Easter etc. since elderly vaccinated. talking recently, comments sub local sub suggest may also problem US. 40 cases per 100k improvements mask usage, vaccination health care personnel, increased ventilation, could get 15 April. use testing, tracing quarantine eliminate community spread US. 
 
But Fauci warned, community spread still rampant, start family gatherings, cruises, social events, people stop masking, rebound cases long large population people vaccinated. problem I'm shown absolute not. causes panic shouldn't. Articles like 10% article help people, makes things worse.

Nobody said anything exponential spread false sense security.

My comment reading headline making ill informed comments look absolute false. matter whether comes news source treat media publications scientific data. Also typing certain words caps help anyone understand. looks like Trump typing. Per Capita testing 30% higher US.

Positivity rate Israel still 5% magic number.

The US may modestly higher undiagnosed rate, say Israel ""very little natural immunity"" comparison US seems quite reach given numbers confirmed cases. isolate animals though widepspread disease. try even brief wiki article linked? spent $5B decades long vaccination campaign far, new cases 20 years. Lots scientists disagree, according New deaths plummet--and highest risk 10-20% population vaccinated--we need easy restrictions almost immediately.

The restrictions huge impact people's livelihoods, need extremely cognizant that. recognize ideal solution would compensate people employers lost wages/income, world live, never going happen. 

Approximately nobody advocating endless restrictions job ""restricted"" away, really easy flippantly sacrifice *other people's livelihoods*, way would feel way job. also shielded consequences thanks corporate liability shield. applies big corporations small closely held ones cannot benefit law structured way easy ""pierce corporate veil"" closely held corporations. Walgreens NY already started.

For believe never worked private enterprise large orgs. country goal eradication setting failure.

Totally agree yet taking route. 

Based pretty much every vaccine history, logic would tell vaccinated people likely easily spread virus one seems willing say definitively. accept maybe data isn’t say sure yet certain point feels like telling us keep people totally refusing follow masking requirements example they’re vaccinated. see backfired lie public masks early hope going path again. wait Two Weeks(tm)! Israel fact occupying force. Israelis live so. he's right!, doctor scientist knows this, redditors does! Thanks report describes first confirmed case reinfection P.1 lineage

It could concern know likely yet. said things normal. right now. vulnerable vaccinated masks won’t saving hundreds lives. could reevaluated thing 6 months ago noooo. set foot airplane get vaccinated, even then, I'll still wear mask. I'll still wear mask subway. lockdowns, masks working home model offices, flu season NYC. COVID precautions took resulted lower flu cases. 

I'll keep taking flu shot well. And, mask, crowded urban setting like NYC, would best. 

Now, downvote away!   Even double triple overall death rate likely still much lower EU US much younger avg age surprising, unfortunately. far far virulent old strains, going take hold wherever goes. noted UK negligible cases older variants now, basically B117. guys careful, along Europe. Yeah... cats susceptible COVID-19 live humans. 


So cat hunts bat catches could bring back home human. 


I mean COVID-19 also quite willing infect mice. Bat Mouse Cat Human. 


I'm saying paths 'Bat Lunch' make sense. 


Oh understand - read comment assumed said virus started cats. Reread comment. similar diseases high death rate. able isolate, host patient dies even spreads another host. Also asymptomatic spread.

This Ebola somewhat easy contain western developed countries. offense developing countries substandard health infrastructures. People want pretend major delays production distribution want able live restriction mask free may Yeah, average lifespan used 30. Let's go back that! people fucking insane. obtuse purpose? said right bat, government providing businesses forced close there's big push open everything right now. April 1 seems like reasonable target, assuming everything goes smoothly then. Although, made April 1 target, announce needed postpone lifting restrictions, would worst April Fool's Day ever. rinderpest, spent $5B several decades vaccination campaign. Yes, lets fully get rid it. really dangerous thing conservative rhetoric spring 2020 making valid arguments... summer 2021.

In words, concerns perpetual lockdowns mental health / economic side effects largely valid — context completed mass vaccination campaign minimized death severe illness. valid arguments vaccine nearly year away hospitals overflowing.

But making arguments full year-plus early, discredited moment we’re find in, risk virus must weighed deleterious effects mitigating virus. Refusing wear masks April 2020 silly harmful. Arguing mask requirements September 2021, concert venue closures March 2022, going different matter entirely. well already poisoned liberals associating resistance restrictions irrationality cruelty, may difficult accept good-faith arguments time appropriate. efficacy always approximation. Results different trials different countries vary. Illinois, metric ""Phase 5"" (no restrictions) always ""vaccine widely available, effective treatment widely available, sustained Zero COVID"". looks like we'll hit first metrics first point Pritzker heavily pressured keep word. sounds like cough caused post nasal drip, would likely indicate allergies COVID

I would say go get test safe since asthma, I’d surprised positive based don’t eat exotic animals....and clean wet markets. Wearing silly paper hats wouldn’t hurt anyone either showed survey saying 75% people gonna start wearing reason I’d eat mine

I’ll bet $20 3 months stop recommending masks, &lt;10% population wears mask regularly. read last night Pfizer 10% effective variants. No, die something, level risk reduction covid makes probably less dangerous plenty diseases activities shrug constantly.  ""The lab boys informed mentioned control group. They're telling ought stop making pre-recorded messages. gave idea: make pre-recorded messages. pay bills here, talk control group damn day."" Cases dropping, maybe government lift travel recommendation? Better check say - oh say April 15th,good know! lies short term solution creating issues line. think would best tell truth Wrong move. need open essential workers independent committee world study origin virus since lost credibility comes confronting China. Wearing mask, preferably N-95 KN-95 would good idea then. Air travel pandemic carries certain amount risk, think that's unavoidable. even policies are, cases still going vaccines speeding up. We're getting close end vaccines widely available, make sense something would cripple air travel get end this. likely effective enough matter. best friend, Rheumatoid Arthritis, (lupus/ra), run issues riding light rail people even recognize actually disabled every bump jostle causes shooting pain, one can't even say visible. know fact elderly woman saw winces gave seat me.

My work puts contact lot high risk folks usually see pneumonia/flu deaths year. times feel sick enough stay home, also dont want put people risk. Wearing mask makes sense me.

Another reason love dogs 🐶  It’s true. protestors stood line masked six feet apart waiting turn loot Target. frail elderly often anergic (have defective immune response) might made vaccine ineffective. flu vaccine, made high dose version elderly.  Personally, think necessary helpful. USA live bubble (though tries to). Worldwide travel affects others ourselves, responsibility think actions harm countries. reasonable move make restrict travel willing protect others (except medically exempted cases). 

Just hands tied make one strong move capable enforcing disproportionate. What's disproportionate lack response responsibility everywhere else.

Edit: Adding see said domestic travel, apologize. even airports workers exposed international travelers, thinking insulate consequences domestic travel want protect people's convenience mind boggling me. I'd like better children that. *deserve* better ""what happens, happens!"" manage live 117, you’ve already got sort genes side. Congrats her! anything make worse? start? ways describing broken world is, post takes prize. Talk capturing despair single sentence. It’s entirely possible right, intentionally trying pessimistic here. cautioning *assuming* we’ll done high risk then, cause 1C category huge. (And don’t really want get discussion/debate prioritized 1C, anyone, valid arguments made whole lot “sides.”) sure! I’m moreso hesistant lodging risks along lines. went 118k 111k day. feel like 100k nd week plausible see China interested letting investigators in. amount evidence change minds nutty American conspiracy theorists. made mind it’s “very likely” related Covid? don’t leave doctors autopsy? That's ridiculously irresponsible method analyzing addressing risk. ""It'll probably fine, not, oh well!"" considering potential lifelong complications misery, death? you’re missing obvious answer radiation came Italy somehow flew China Exactly. worst part year people got sick died. That's bummer I'm far traumatized. worst part nothing going work going home. Almost every day. year. can't wait get back chop unwashed masses. Death one concern. Children still physically developing might horrible complications road. know plenty parents premature kids NICU oxygen due underdeveloped lungs, want know COVID might later life. Cardiovascular issues another concern. Oh, wow. expected say eventually. think get data transmission we'll get certainty messaging thing. doubt help willingness take vaccine first place.  I’ve done ton research haven’t found much I’ll ask here. anyone, preferably reliable source, know travelers UK US required quarantine arrival even vaccinated. would able provide proof vaccination negative test result done within 3 days arrival. not. New Zealand Taiwan using it. They're poor countries. Covax basically insurance policy pay guarantee supply. media spinning something else. Lab theory Conspiracy fuss creating vaccinated-only rules recommendations? literally posted daily. Remember, two ~~weeks months~~ years flatten curve!! What’s even point anything anymore? Covid tamed, yet tamed. deaths still high they've ever been, cases higher ever first 8 months pandemic. know reason we'll continue see declines even go completely back normal right second. even read posted? literally contradicts abstract lol. one? North Carolina still 9 PM curfew. Fucking Cooper sort joke? believe will. look covidactnow.com every day state daily new cases trend less vertically downward trending despite like 8% people gotten shot. Penetration meh.... i'm eating vaccination-only restaurant bar. antivaxxers want party go right ahead! not? run rampant among younger crowd, allowing additional chance mutation? Potential long COVID hundreds thousands otherwise healthy adults? younger crowd (i.e. 65) make 50% hospitalizations. like they're impervious virus. less likely die. probably happen next school year, though. Re-opening schools mid-session would pretty chaotic likely cause problems would solve. probably need summer break retool get prepped in-person classes Fall.

In meantime, it'd nice least kids interact kids regularly, require school. Lmao tf takes time edit comment  Anti lockdown sentiment late subreddit disgusting.

Lives saved always outweigh inconveniences. dead option complain narrative becomes one sided,  knows vulnerable vaccinated need compel people take somehow Evidence? Trump longer president. could want? /s

It's like mosy unpopular president ever pandemic anything I'm afraid we'll end over-medicating. There's nothing wrong psychiatric medication, root cause behavioral fix behavioral.

We literally millions people suffering due pandemic, would suffered otherwise. hope medicate all. lmao many EU member states. Medical staff, teachers sick/old people top priorities. mean, team wanted get alive... = many

You want redefine words. make false equivalencies. 

That's you. Nope, at-risk populations vaccinated, health trade nowhere near worth restrictions lockdowns. get numbers worldwide enough people vaccinated imo. virus mutating time, may change way non vaccines work anymore least less good. can't afford let happen else second pandemic efforts useless. Nah. Wait 2 months vaccines widespread. actually smallpox outbreak began 1978. wild sample virus stored research lab UK escaped. don’t statistical analysis use logic. vast majority vaccinated among risk groups. groups make disproportionate number deaths. example US something like 85% deaths occurred age group 65+ make 16% total population. fact 3% died received vaccine (and likely got one dose) shows incredibly effective eliminating risk virus. vaccine weren’t effective you’d see closer correlation number percent people country received versus percent die. Yes, Moderna Pfizer vaccines probably reduce transmission risk AZ. best case transmission risk reduction somewhere neighborhood 15x-20x, since efficacy preventing symptomatic infection \~92-95% range. That's great: like N95 mask permanently strapped face. key transmission risk determined protections (vaccines/masks/etc) case rates. period lots people vaccinated case rates still moderate high, still important aware potentially exposing others. mean ""act like vaccinated nothing"" mean still avoid high risk activities. We’re missing it. chose focus extreme. worst case scenario poor kids see MIS-C death well so, they’re included. 100% effective shots relatively small (still, tens thousands people) sample clinical trial volunteers. vaccinated participants contracted covid, number died even smaller, statistics break little bit point. determined 100% effective within margin error able achieve. 

In case, 3% would include people contracted covid mere days first dose vaccine, hard tell many people, all, died time period body supposed created sufficient immune response specified trial results. Fortunately people anti-vax people likely get natural immunity infection. fringes stop society recovering. saddens agree statement much.  Retired people can't always stay home. might suddenly get sick, visit doctor hospital.

Some retired people afford spend extra grocery delivery. Others can't. didnt start Maryland, started Wuhan, China. many times story survey posted again? stop absurd repetition ... 

I entirely sure US, see various media, seems attitude masks less welcoming Europe, - way hell people wear masks covid even Europe. 

I personally wear mask outside legal mandate. see legal mandates masks covid, anyone trying get voted next chance. point real world trials even lab results testing SA Brazil specific mutations Moderna, Pfizer, JNJ AZ? one social distanced BLM protests, lmao happened doctor Florida. vaccination made sure look hands feet sign brusing, petechiae, purpura. also made sure eat plenty iron rich foods. normally low blood platelet count yearly labs diligent look symptoms. 7 days post vax great! :) Calm down, guy you’re responding throwing REALITY. know pandemic years ago landed USA, infected 60 million people, one gave shit didn’t kill old people. 0.02% mortality rate. guideline americans giving shit, see OP would say going back normal US, are.

TLDR AMERICANS GONNA AMERICAN, don’t shoot messanger. wonder we'll see flatten due super bowl festivities Maybe vaccine isn’t good generally? Antimaskers trying impose beliefs others create false consensus. least post history consistent, posts anti-lockdown. Same. build plans federal government execution, come recommendations. liar fooling yourself. **some** masks, universal, limited distancing. supported protests, I'll support ones, too. Oof, rip rules tremendous amount damage. Rates Anxiety/Depression tripled, substance abuse way up, people financially ruined. Society made hard decision ruining destroying people's lives consequence lockdown worth mitigate effects COVID 19. OK, vulnerable get vaccinated, harm COVID becomes much less, reduce harm restrictions well. Don’t forget MLK Jr day spike, hitting us day last night got really bored spent much time sacrificing mental health laughs going *other* subs here’s favorite takes found:

• vaccinated healthcare workers attended Super Bowl “traitors profession”

• Wishing Sinovac Sinopharm vaccines succeed “western” ones fail

• Cases falling new variants aren’t showing tests

• Young people committing “ageicide” elderly spreading virus

At point I’m convinced practically everyone sort troll it’s like shows there’s gang/cartel every single member actually undercover FBI, DEA, ATF, etc. agent don’t know yet. Hope buy luxuries donate money saving lives. Otherwise disgusting standards Sputnik vaccine useful SA variant give away AZ orders. reminds ads like 10 years ago.

This one weird trick, discovered mom, modernize website! read something wrong title? implies 3% recent deaths vaccinated? Vaccinated still got infected died? Pfizer’s Mondena’s? 
I honestly expected better. assumed yes, still possible infected even vaccine body somehow knows “fight” death rate even lower.... F100 tech company said quickly changed course 3 months later back onsite. I’ll make even stronger prediction say 1,000 day US end April. mortality rate almost 0 well  Positivity rates prove otherwise happens push people far ridiculous restrictions. needs balance act things end worse. one's fault governments here's passage (paywall unfortunately)

\[...\]BioNTech said October vaccines China's market would manufactured entirely Germany, BioNTech told *Fortune* that's case BioNTech's first vaccine shipment China. Starting second shipment, BioNTech send vaccine materials Fosun ""fill finish,"" meaning Fosun fill vials package vaccines distribution. companies told *Fortune* Fosun may eventually manufacture vaccine start finish China\[...\]

I doubt BNT ship 100 mil Marburg first doses Pfizer/BT production facilities US, stay US... doses AZ production facilites UK, stay UK...all doses new Fosun production facility stay China, that's true. 

I implying Belgium facility, one get even less 75 250 Marburg, that's even worse. 

BNT disclosed anything Marburg apart rough estimation 250 mil per Q. production starts, I'm sure we'll get accurate estimations, BNT far really careful/ conservative estimations, maybe avoid things happened AZ &amp; EU. Math really add BNT supply doses EU Marburg. much order globally now. Means 10 days 40+ million Americans have, average, 60+% immunity. That's pretty big deal. 

I hope Biden admin keeps good work ramping vaccinations. It'll make huge dent faster people think. Waiting vaccine arrived UNTHINKABLE start pandemic.

This sold public short-term measure let hospitals prepare.

We handful 'near miracle' vaccines.

Waiting beyond spring cannot table, point.

We existing, living, moment. know damn well couple months gonna saying damn thing. might well copy exact comment post May. people risk screwed don’t really mean anything. Lots vaccine hesitant types spreading claims screwed vaccines reality find excuses seek out

I put quite way. There's split overall big picture vaccine rollout going well lots people getting vaccines soon people live nursing homes work hospitals even elderly want vaccinated manage get vaccinated, individual experience anyone trying get vaccine spend days refreshing multiple web sites waiting appointments pop try snag quickly possible someone else thing order reserve vaccination date March. People continue negative perception vaccine rollout vaccine availability appointment crunch starts abate, might months short term demand exceeding short term supply. meantime, think normal people annoyed personally struggling get access vaccines, even one's ""fault"" per se overall covering large fractions vulnerable populations already.  mental health pandemic going devastating

Drug abuse already huge problem going much worse. Israel indication ~50% population tipping point supply demand vaccines. 

We'll point first shots within couple weeks, sooner.  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well, like ~95 million Americans age 55 we’re ~1.5 million vaccine doses per day now, don’t hopefully increases soon. still piss moan complain I'd said May 1. I'm Florida

Say more! 100% honest, sound like complete scam. even mentioned product service offering, let alone explain idea better existing offerings. 

No one take seriously even explain proposing. mean pandemic ever started? Lag Abolish misleading headlines I'm pretty sure 83 million infections end December, November. double counting December. I'd wager we're somewhere 35-40% infected range point. CA positivity rate also falling. yeah, cases really falling.  lying? entirely new variation still know plenty older eligible people struggling even get appointment. I’m NY. thinking along lines person told they'll never walk again, person terminal illness weeks/ days live. degrees highly unlikely. 17 meteors land earth every day, eventually hit people. Limiting meteor hits (you, next 45 minutes) makes chances essentially zero, certainty happen someone. Winning lottery also highly unlikely. Yet people win lottery dont understand news. Like.. shit? wernt vaccinated. Soooo...

Am missing something here?

Explain like I'm 5 even read article lol

This isn’t even really “new” variant. It’s simply extremely small subset UK variant picked mutation found SA variant. Uk something like 50% genomic sequencing world, they’re surveying it, it’s surprise would identified change even it’s extremely rare controlling income inequality NY vs GA, though. expanded medicaid, they're probably likely avoid seeking medical care, especially going hospital. I'll Google see excess death percentages playing out.  Hah, think craft cocktails $10 drink? only... They're finding vaccines, there's level protecting 21 days first dose. know exactly long protection lasts that's mostly vaccines new.  need fact check Biden, needed fact check Trump. get trying do, that's law works lol. driving sidewalk, reckless, law infers intent. reasonable person would drive sidewalk without knowing action would high likelihood causing harm. yes laws negligence. I'm saying law never recognized getting somebody sick breathing air negligent act. saying *should* be, well that's different issue. laws would change, right now, real precedent that. don’t think fauci would sympathy different view $400,000 yearly salary stripped away? Even though afford given savings compared effected Americans? It’s insane think wouldn’t different views financial well impacted fact 3% deaths people vaccinated something publicized enough. result, deaths due vaccinated people thinking safe. Nowhere thread say loosen restrictions immediately, countered claim - big chunk population vaccinated herd immunity. 2 might safe general rules going still place overall cases die 1- can't trust people truthful 2- know vaccinated people could still spread though individually vaccinated, can't go back normal society everyone (or ~70% herd immunity) also vaccinated. They're lucky get early still ongoing people.""

There indication ""herd immunity"" going reached next months, threshold even is. Even theoretical herd immunity localized outbreaks/illness/hospitalization, additionally run issues vaccine uptake, vaccines children.

So, I'm sure argument besides ""wait months!"" - that's poor message, one that's rooted discrete milestones health.

There's containment variants without significant restrictions travel/widespread vaccination populations countries. care meant USA, that's flaw reasoning. didn’t say priority, shouldn’t last solely fact they’re prison, especially elderly immunocompromised. fair, can't ease many restrictions see 100 Covid cases day. like lied public masks try prevent panic buying almost half country says work. 

Public health 101 honesty true, death numbers get low enough people stop caring. it’s easy get false positives. Easy cover something find (drugs, contraband, etc). great isn’t physical evidence (asymptomatic carriers aren’t showing symptoms, tests may show positive).

Either way, people vaccinated, resume much normal life reasonably safe. best motivation go get vaccinated yourself. Ok, I’m driving sidewalk, intentionally hitting people? it’s ok? case I’m trying hit people. always reasonable expectation people must try avoid hurting people (hence negligence laws exist). Literally I’m arguing harming people negligence bad, don’t see controversial all. evidence brigading? supporting narrative China surprising. lost credibility. Next announce Covid start China started imported cold supply chain. shut door lab leak theory cold supply chain theory. unlikely still contagious. Stock market predicted this. anyone talking variants vaccines? really feels like media saw finally legitimate good news find something make sound bad. true, helpful stuff time impact case #'s yet Stats biggest lie. Look statement tell significant? Yes. also possible vaccinated catch mild asymptomatic case, would increase possibility escape mutants astronomically. Hell yeah. That's one loved ones gotten. Trust me, אני זוכר lol, I'm Palestinian.

Stay safe bro/sis, hope able get vaccinated!!! Nevada, blessed Governor Sisolak ranked prisoners worthy (higher priority) 70+ yr olds comorbidities.

Frankly, didn’t read article don’t want read whiney shit, know Governor wanted!  agree. risk long covid isn’t worth going restaurant plane either - particularly lingering brain fog memory problems long haulers have. Might rough treat asymptomatic COVID carriers Terminators though (hose massive firepower). big question mark whether vaccinated people still spread virus. yeah Hasidic sects issue here. Kanievsky told people get vaccinated. Hasidic leaders much. Also people stopped Thanksgiving/Xmas/New years parties now, except weirdos.  grandmother 99 years old clue get vaccine. it’s maddening. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ Yesterday Scott Gottleib said expects supply demand early next month. believe he's board Pfizer probably knows something don't. would shocked governments pharmacies doctors offices begging people get vaccine Memorial Day. entirely clear lag infections deaths (3 weeks? Maybe more?), we're going see fast drop deaths (hospitalizations assume) point going very, soon.

People nursing homes make something like 50% deaths done. We're well 75+ age range point well. vaccines work well think, see extremely sharp drop matter weeks.

We're seeing yet people dying presumably got sick January vaccines could given/take effect. I'm also worried people viewing stories Norway deaths occurred recently vaccines (hank Aaron, dude NYC yesterday, woman VA) 🧼🙌 Got shot already, lick toilet seats skanky bars.

We learn /u/ekaceerf take shots, go back licking skanky seats. valid point know risk vaccinated people might pose others. mask hardly ""little thing"" many us, point going start allowing least people vaccinated gather without restriction. Sorry would local museum. Fair, I'm OP. sentiment come from? pro-Trump thing, general conspiracy thing something else? got shot licked toilet seat skanky bar. recommend. Turns hepatitis fun either What? That’s bad straw man attempt. 
Are creationist? 
You seem zero understanding biology evolution. Humans didn’t randomly arrive current state - due sustained selective pressure. 
Viral variants evade immunity selected for. doesn’t need god decide variants propagate - consequence increased fitness. Name one exciting thing happened ""fun"" states 2020. everything shut down, rural states (since businesses open), lower cost living, less crime, riots. Seems like downside try lock another pandemic less decade. agree point. understanding public health experts decided protecting hospitals collapse crucial reopening schools. would put teachers next group vaccinated. New York, teachers able vaccinated weeks, don’t enough supply either. 

It’s seems nationwide vaccine rollout mess due logistics lack supply. West Virginia states done well. happening people get lesser side effects second dose? Peace Corps volunteer. really good project working on, even going take extra year work national government implement (and necessary byproduct spend year living really cool capital city rather tiny village). Instead, almost year ago now, got told 24 hours close almost two years service say goodbye. came back immunocompromised parents, job market makes question whether even worth going first place. Experts seem bit split second dose thing right personally I'm siding ""follow guidelines people made vaccine"" proven otherwise.

And I'm science denier anything. see weekly ""next month worst time human history"" title sigh keep scrolling.

But stayed fairly date times I've seen something horribly concerning additional research get context rather believing media headlines face value. hospitals woods deaths dropped pandemic over.

Literally Spanish flu ""ended"" well. mean still know, endemic. think sensible person considers evidence would questions zoonotic hypotheses presented point. asked taking long explained. really lack information point. one knows effective mRna vaccines South Africa variant. evidence prevalent USA yet. know effective vaccine preventing spread. There's lot know.

Her position probably rational though, absence evidence, go back normal till there's evidence contrary. need normal lives. future never guaranteed. sorts terrible things could store us, viral otherwise. Go, get vaccinated selves top mountain. Go see friends. Go make memories enjoy life bit. may able later. you’ve already COViD first dose produce stronger reaction. haven’t COViD second dose will. Either way, expect lose day work. Fever, chills headache common symptoms Oh see, makes sense. German guy myself, I'm ashamed fellow country men women. frustrating many people think little science, especially given history regarding sience (before ww2 obviously).

Please know Germans general like morons comments individual posts seem vary lot. 

""Good news"" posts usually optimistic comments.

""Bad news"" posts pretty mixed. Sometimes people call fearmongering, sometimes go along it. general trends though:

* Anything suggests ""restrictions forever"" tends comments look lot like ones thread (i.e., people disagreeing post). 
* bad news interpreted fault American right tends much pessimistic comments, obvious reasons. 
* Anything involving school reopening tends pessimistic comments. sure reason this.
* Stuff variants still somewhat mixed, starting trend direction optimistic replies. People sick media constantly bringing doomsday scenarios variants never materialize. 

Anyway, help combat fearmongering posting reasonable replies comment threads one. Well claiming virus BRAND new one could conduct study people busy trying save lives. like study came April saying coronavirus immunity last 3 months everyone said ""See! 3 months world ending never get this!"" like bud... studying 3 months way could say last longer that... guess you’re serious baby 15 min handle. son says thing wearing collared shirts. Makes amount sense.  Dude, go see friends listen zeroCOVID dipshits. news federal pharmacy program individual states? Government announces plan open Thursday two vendors opening state want silent locations appointments. I? national guard military defense

It also support civil authorities, conducting pandemic defense. don’t think outdoor cats could pointed intermediate animal. thousands stray cats Istanbul centuries. Yet, single outbreak sourced back cats. Wiseman thread downvotes anything happy talk upvotes vehicles misinformation like sea lioning. sad getting downvoted pervs like someone tells stop perv shit. know. agree happens, seen many politicians defending zero almost zero covid, certain plans vaccination passports heavily imply that. false-positive rate COVID tests also issue. Imagine traveling something extremely important falsely told COVID even prior infection vaccinated? hope then, continue put life career hold, give seeing family, help save lives. number factors play. locally Raleigh NC USA, weather getting warmer. meet friends family safely yard. Restaurants, retail, schools, leave windows open. virus travel far live long. Combined vaccination, could see community transmission plummet March perhaps end June. 

In UK, similar factors play seeing rates plummet.

In Israel, COVID rates deaths design. willing higher rates deaths, long Jewish die higher rates. report high rates vaccinations, ask, ""Does include Palestinians Arabs living Israel?"" doesn't. 

For UAE, stepped efforts recently roughly 3 week lag increasing immunity. see precipitous drop kicks in. Considering almost 40% people Mississippi obese, Mississippi basically eligible. get need come lab. many avian bird flus came China? None ""manufactured lab"" fanfare still virus different animal jumping human. 

Research origin course, keep seeing comments threads denouncing organization investigates origin match conspiracy. entirely possible constructed lab, possible mean likely. There's possibility hits 30 degrees Celsius today, likely given winter snowing.

Even argue government can't trusted ""cleaned up"" site origin, attacking experts get visit see ""cleaned up"" site make sense. China blame hid tracks, everyone attacking researchers investigate cleaned crime scene? Possibly, seem like driving decline hospitalizations trending well. tests artificially low, would still reflect positivity rates. Top human are. listen said serious pandemic. Wake up. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm locking 3 years anyone trying make fuck off. Weird ""experts concerned"" something like that, ""experts *fear*"". almost like headlines intentionally written way. people won’t problem wearing masks foreseeable future""

I know...I certainly going willing return working office (as opposed remotely, I've since March) I'm told mask day. tolerance wearing one 10-15 minutes, enough time go bank grab things grocery store able get delivered. 

As anything else long masks required, forget it. Much looking forward able go things again, going wait mask mandates dropped. offense, Canada botch virus vaccine rollout fucking badly? guy replied said people listens things would different.But didn’t managed better whinge would different? described it. producers use terminology like mRNA delivery, mRNA transfer, integration. can’t fault Canadian Prime Minister working behalf Canadian citizens get many Canadians actually vaccinated quickly possible. Exactly daycare. One teacher tested positive room shut 2 weeks. school open since end June. Humanity eradicated *two* infectious diseases time we've trying, another four barely, maybe, within reach.

They slow-mutating diseases trigger strong lasting immune responses: smallpox cattle disease similar measles (rinderpest).

There never reasonable hope eradicating coronavirus. best (and should) hope lasting partial immunity causes Covid-19 dangerous another rather nasty bat-related coronavirus causes bronchiolitis, pneumonia, multiple-organ inflammation.

It's common *everybody* gets first years life, reinfected several times throughout life.

Those reinfections common colds. first one usually too, common first infection worst, look infants hospitalized pneumonia, NL63 often cause cause.

In scenario (and NL63 similar well-known virus SARS coronaviruses) vaccine needs give immunity similar first-time exposure. need last forever. Says random internet guy right, point epitopes immune system recognizes cases (the spike protein). delivery different less important escape variants. people become anti-vaccination activists ? 

Seriously, many cause become activist. fight human rights, volunteer teach kid poor families, become union representative, even conservative join religion. hell would people become activist motto *I want people get sick  ?* like big pharma ? advocate regulation, government owned pharma sector ? people see ""small tin 150 people it"" assume petri dish even data says otherwise. Lack evidence doesn’t mean jack shit since anyone reporting inside savagely beaten useful investigation delayed year. already found among frozen foods New Zealand shipped another country? pandemic already started, clearly cause spreading it, thought already proven die cold Short answer it’s poorly understood, know virus caused pandemic essentially endemic. Waste time. investigation probably paid recover defamation. Friendly reminder friends (especially post much power users here), sub representative people feel (including posters tell us people whole feel). look sub, likely stronger opinion COVID strategies combat one way another (or stop combatting it). 

If post here... take notch. 

I've reddit long enough internet longer realize messages boards great place get peoples opinions, comes caveat look two contrasting opinions upvotes downvotes assume that's people want.


""Everybody know plans X"" -- everybody person knows might idiot.


""The studies show X definitively, 15 links"" -- person might completely ignored 5 studies contradict that.

But important remember views, even minority ones, someone really believes origin. probably representative general population think are, sphere influence. K. Fully vaccinated still panicking? Seriously? going restaurant safer travelling? None makes sense.

Your GF right here. part country, restrictions went back due surge. 

But general, we've never big surge, big behavior differences right surge right (i.e. Christmas vs. Christmas). people ""social distancing"" years Covid went weirdos heroes, shaming everyone making ""sacrifices"" already anyways. can't easy give up. Well it’s me. you. Local governments they. still don’t mandate it. Others do. I’m sure point it. much problem (a) NC pushing schools go back person next couple months (b) counties ability move next phase even counties lagging behind. numbers optics NC look good, many actions aligned words. mean speculate, US definitely entertain nation wide lockdown holidays... Israel one leading Hanukkah went right back one afterwards. mention Israel's testing regimen puts shame (I think positivity rate 5% ages). likely they're actually capturing 90-95% cases best hope capturing disease curve looks like. taken tylenol? so, help fever? Honestly I'd tune frantic ones out. moment mentality still ""COVID cases = Big Bad"", idea vaccinated person possibly getting spreading seems like vaccine useless. 

The concept ""Yes, COVID exists, due vaccines toothless virus causes minor inconvenience"" really wormed way brain. get period something like ""5,000 COVID cases reported today, 4 hospitalized, 2 deaths"" gradually see reality filter in. fiance started dating Jan 2020. able meet friends, get married REALLY sucky. Also, spending Christmas folks really hurt. blaming UK countries incompetent? Lmao. British, Danish South African sequencing world would dark various variants late. 

Imagine scenario sequencing place Spanish flu deadly mutation caused deaths second wave slowed restrictions? imagine begining second wave vaccine starting given millions people? Tens millions lives saved. confusing daily new cases cumulative total cases. care get downvoted hell, find weird fact people blame using scientific method orden research virus. everything black white, specially un science! they've done objective throughout pandemic, giving people facts know INSTANT... aight, wrong times, that's science, proof can't prove ir disproof theory, end, 100% sure something normally say ""there proof X"" , ""there's evidencie Y"" ""Z believed G"". please, learn take science grain salt, nothing 100%, nothing ever be... remember, science states something till proven wrong, scientific organizations work way. (Also, involving politics topics rather unnecesary useful, beg you, plz try politicize pandemic already is) Hey, another post sub's front page US 3x cases reported, make comment thread? Huh? western give crap regardless said. Wake up. know won’t PREVENT tumor liver 5-10 years? social anxiety don’t want live life. say sincerity: please seek help.

Not everyone needs socialite Type personality. know many think people like crowds mingling sick head. Isolation good anyone. there's nothing wrong people wanting socialize time.

I also doubt there's many wish pandemic continue sake everyone's misery. like WFH aspects helped reduce stress levels forced live society designed personality. Weekly symptoms surveillance reported wait sporadic news reports 

Test positivity trends cases monitored covidtracking.com I'm grown. no, mask wearing ""big deal"" forcing permanently is. 

One last time, force people vaccinated.

Yell scream want, stamp feet like child, people abide authoritarianism **NOTHING** it. 

Accept it. Honestly media’s messaging made go “never getting vaccine” camp recently started considering taking it.

Maybe Fauci others said something like “We still need restrictions masks right now, people get vaccine ease states metrics that.” 

Instead Today show still points every crowd “few masks little distancing” people try human change like they’re trying fill quota many times say that. tell everyone “you wear mask distance can’t travel even vaccine kicks in.” would want get year later they’re still told enjoying life terrible? 

And oh yeah still two grandparents alive. accept risk don’t want live life behind computer, also don’t call selfish sitting home protect them. due forced work essential job make ends meet, everyone who’s bad habits keep moving weight people stop caring....as ignore them.... also fucking pay mortgage. also Bangladesh less urbanized North Dakota. People look pop/km2 assume must jampacked like sardines, actually Bangladeshi live rural villages. mention bots creating it.... work virology lab unconfirmed hypothesis people severe reaction first dose exposed covid before, thus antibodies cells it. mean could've come contact. Again, tested thats think happening many deaths Biden responsible since January 20th? blame old guy everything? found u/a_happy_otter's boss Lol says dude post FreeKarma keep karma much gets downvoted. So? doesn’t conflict point extremely irresponsible tweet CDC also estimated could 100 million cases already would greatly boost herd immunity vaccine barely around month 2. FB basically decides problematic long term effects concerned about, delete them? scientist would agree hard conclusion. Sounds like 1940 Germany me. Heyan, here's need complete dick here. trying point two people talking different things.

The reason said I'm talking anything really trying add information saying commenters missed original trying say highlighting important point might see it.

If want take it, I'd glad give it: new variant wide spread see behaves seems favorable even significantly worse vanilla covid wrt transmissibility. say new data suggests variant worse situation without it, current situation better two months ago, that's good thing. I.e. variant worse (sans situational context) situation changed may big impact things overall. 

Again, complete dick reason. I'm Virginia. weeks ago bottom percentage vaccines distributed. elderly parents. kids made lot sacrifice last year. looks like Va starting pick pace getting people vaccinated finally I'm ready kids parents able function safely. I'll take anyway get it. Really? often would say occurs? fiancee quite careful whole thing there's instances feel could exposed we've never ""had"" it. always wonder. really. like sensible people expected. I.e conspiracy theorists. remember job opening wuhan virology website. page posted time mid November 2019, 1 month first viral pneumonia case reported Wuhan.

The job opening looking virologist around world. studying bats coexist many diesieses. One main diesies testing coronavirus. one back 2001 believe.

Wow. year since last saw that. There's insignificant chance could pass infection get infected walking, running, biking past someone outdoors less 5 seconds. need think logic, emotion. That's assuming even COVID first place. overly safe. Day 13 since beginning symptoms. Smell comes goes. Taste 90 percent can't taste jelly spicy foods far guess. nose burns little dont know means smell coming back. Plus they’re probably missing reinfections initial infection asymptomatic. sounds like paradise. Another day 100k cases today. Heck even fewer cases today yesterday. Dem states tend people urban/suburb areas rural. Close proximity would increase covid-19 rates. think least short term logistically easier distribute supplies large places well personnel there. 

How control numbers people supply sent many smaller areas makes getting everything place difficult.

Haven't congress-members reported positive since? think read 2, unsure. Social damage too. occurred today, 14-year-old around person opposite sex who's age 11 months. Easy joke about, actually funny. Right? guy seriously think nobody spread Covid NFL games? Bullshit. mention restore charge hair dryer another name? use pro Air Wixela 0 clue getting downvoted stating truth. agree 2022 much likely goal July August. 

We COVID issues fall/winter, albeit much lower cases. don't? u wanna wear mask let in. use fabric softner 57% overall. Far perfect, way better 10-20% AstraZeneca likely protective severe infection. Good securing better alternative. worried too. ""No happened Janu—wait minute..."" Duh.. sun coming out.. knew would really high winter lower spring summer thats Australia New Zealand Come Texas panhandle. either a) older 65 -or- b) older 18 chronic condition. 

The way vaccine held authorities states like gollum's previous nuts, IMO. reading ""amusement park"" reddit thread shocked many people claiming never wear mask time summer comes around vaccines widespread.

This going ongoing issue sorry say. actually contact tracing document spread.   Agreed. medium-sized group C people also in-person social circle right now. Nobody circle it, exception one works dialysis clinic (but got last March see June). see light end tunnel! time diagnosis, Mr Wright confirmed experiencing **""minor symptoms""**, campaign announced Monday died following battle Covid-19.

I wish realized rapidy COVID-19 turn mild fatal. Literally matter hours reported cases. leave hospital admitted soon after. time parks open, vaccine widely available people want it. I'm careful person comes virus even say ""open up"" vaccine widespread. IIRC, far prevent hospitalization death roughly degree. makes sense reverse: save ones biggest effect transmission people likely transmit, lot lose even mild illness (time off, mandatory quarantine, etc.) happened thread? used cool evidence-based, circlejerk good things going. read comment? person ""cheering virus"" way, fact obviously want things go back normal. They're discussing pace vaccination program, much intelligently are. Zero Fuck, delusional... ""my life again"" think comprehend magnitude economic damage experiencing. Usa Europe's economy life support. pumping $ like crazy protect falling abbyss. ""Your life back""... Man, told subreddit drinking hopium didnt know drink gallons... They’ll harder fight tweak-able vaccines without vaccines all? Come now. It’s mutating without vaccines anyway. sounds right. seems wisely getting ready planet (or well, country, least) plenty vaccine go around. Pfizer Moderna make numbers, we're looking something like 140mm doses end March another 200mm across three months that. Plus whatever J&amp;J pump out. Masks going required concerts amusement parks too. stickers even gone local Walmart while. least self-checkout.

I used go grocery store never stickers begin with. Somehow everyone managed fine six feet thing best could. (Small city.) 57% efficacy, reduced still good enough. Full protection hospitalisations. ""locked up"" continue wearing masks social distancing many years. Exactly, know several people lately bothered get tested person gave tested. Well, there's much else do. going COUNTLESS variants future. four options stage, three terrible, probably factually incorrect.

1. Reform Society

We reform society technologically-oriented, work done online rest lives. Things like grocery stores would turn grocery distribution centers, drivers delivering food directly homes. Masks would never needed, since people would almost never leave homes first place. would dating, concerts, movie theaters, nothing requires physically close strangers extended length time. Life know would completely changed forever.

This would never actually happen, ever, one options.

2. Open Everything Up

The deadliest options, involves throwing caution wind restoring 2019 normals immediately. Millions would die deadliest single event since World War 2, again, would never happen, another option.

3. Vaccine Whack-a-Mole!

This far likely option right now, looks like actually what's going happen. We'll reopen partially, get stuck many years critical issues masks, indoor dining, concerts variants. new variants keep mutating infinitely, new vaccines developed every months year respond said new variants. Ideally pill format, since people get tired shots every months. slowly, cases start drift down, time span variants begin widen. 3 5 years time, possibly even 10, cases low enough, tracing good enough, sequencing fast enough reopen keep close checks potential new variants. might year long lockdowns tie loose ends.

4. Miracle Breakthrough

This refer say people ""so blindly push head sand regards variants"". They're hoping current vaccine able keep variants, fully return normal minimal loss life summer. Unrealistic, possibly, consider three options above, blame thinking like that? Work school different 45%?! That’s crazy! source that? not. Plenty schools done tests came back negative, least.

Yeah, they're maskholes, anti-social hermits even COVID. would lot worried went church person, get DVDs shipped weirdo fundy cult Texas. Ah gave year fuck it, cares dies long get cheeseburger. Give fucking rest. Well yes, without vaccines virus less prone evolve escape immune response, new mutants far harder fight off. It’s getting public. It’s saving lives. Italy’s elderly severely impacted covid deaths hospitalizations. AZ works better younger folks. MRNA effective older folks. seem easy answer obesity, tell poverty? little self discipline solve too. Really, want hear simple-minded answer. spot on. 0 clue people celebrating amusement parks music concerts SUMMER. Absolutely clueless. FDA let Novavax apply EUA without finishing P3 U.S. trial, could much sooner (\~3 weeks approval submission EUA Moderna Pfizer) family preference irrelevant qualify education received isn’t adequate. It’s actually human rights violation. Next time need surgery, tell surgeon want mask ""that's letting viruses bacteria win."" post video laughing here. kicks. deliberate cope genius strategy involves letting spread asymptomatic, ""winning lottery."" Given age health risks, ""more likely experience severe symptoms catch it"" bucket. But, dude, lab tests mean nothing compared stiff upper lip Group here. Haven’t caught covid. Funny shit works mean, agree, it’s better airlines aren’t shit approval comes, “Nothing changes,” told Hellgren. already producing vaccine. 72% 1 shot vaccine poor? Take lap. Coronavac even bad. Brazil trial conducted medical workers higher exposure virus general population resulting lower reported efficacy rate. way Epidemiologists think moment maximum danger wasn’t virus spreading without vaccines without substantial population immunity, lot people *are* immune?

That’s pretty silly. chill fear-mongering variant articles people going telling everyone afraid perpetuity? Ya sounds like FDA working speedier process prepare boosters if/when need them. Sounds like won’t require trials larger scale Pfizer Moderna say create boosters whatever variant comes way. I'll get booster every six months means live life again. Vaccine distribution going take several months. get want with... it’s going process. Probably well spring start seeing things loosen fall least really say Covid completely US. summer question capacity administer vaccines vaccine supply. Moderna Pfizer, 365M doses shipped end May, enough \~182M adults. That's 2/3 \~255M adults US. Novavax could potentially start shipping vaccines April/May well. suppose depends are. would say America, zero chance lock again...except maybe see localized shut downs certain businesses, *if* spike cases. honestly chances lock slim.

Numbers coming down, vaccines administered, vaccines **do** work variants, even cases specific vaccine sees drop effectiveness specific variant, still protects serious infection hospitalization.

Again speaking American, normal achieved year. see pretty much normal summer. come next fall, suspect sports back full capacity. want know people wore masks restrooms limit number people allowed once? one biggest hospital TLV, rows light cases, severe cases, critical care total.

columns vaccine, 1st dose only, less 7 days 2cond dose, 7 days 2cond dose total.

It's bit deceiving people 2cond dose 1/1/2021 numbers can't compared current day share inoculated population. looks promising. saw promo story week two ago Kate Middleton handling parenting pandemic. I’m sure parents everywhere relate Duchess Cambridge. /s  Regarding frequency, remember seeing top analysed data 4182 incident cases COVID-19 logged symptoms prospectively COVID Symptom Study app. 558 (13.3%) symptoms lasting days, 189 (4.5%) weeks 95 (2.3%) weeks.

Another study looked 201 young, low-risk individuals reporting symptoms least 4 months later found 2/3 showed signs organ impairment least one organ, 1/4 showed impairment multiple organs.

The challenge data generated cases. Hospitals regions lot infections rigorous follow-ups needed capacity immediate cases. lot people reporting symptoms looked lot potential factors like post-viral syndrome, PTSD, simply ignored symptoms seem particularly dangerous. Similarly, many hospitals US actively *avoiding* various scans infected patients due danger staff.

As dust settles immediately dangerous cases, assume start seeing lot information coming topic. r/HailCorporate Both, effective one dose waiting longer time takes time build immunity, delayed second dose boosts first observable protection starts waning (and makes protection durable, longer lasting) 

If give second dose soon, diminish effects. closing gyms? Moderna concluded vaccine would still remain effective even 6.4 fold decrease, seem conveniently left out

Except can't actually make call know neutralization levels needed are. 6.4 fold reduction corresponds neutralization titers would put older vaccinated individuals levels less lowest convalescent patients month 3. criticism. think that’s criticism clearly haven’t done much publishing. explain discrepancy results, it’s pretty bad look would said “well, hell knows why, don’t”. Criticism would involved UT directly stating Columbia’s method inadequate poor approach, etc. know that. You’re trying push buttons

You see one way, see another way. put much faith study think going play Pfizer like saw manufacturers trialed already. Exactly. Prepare disappointed, things aren’t going snap right back normal soon elderly vaccinated. Remind people we're asking get public again? suggest looking states website “we”? Looks like took 3 weeks first submitted docs calling me. say could call number speed things up, kind forgot it. call though, getting shot two days later. (Los Angeles area least.) doubt. infected group people mostly seniors living independently/not home five went hospital one died. NONE ones article mentioned getting ill huge win.

Thanks again! ❤ vaccines sterilizing. Covid still live upper respiratory, rarely makes lower respiratory (which usually people get sicker). still level spread vaccinated likely. case count started going January 6th. Go ahead ban can’t change facts Think it'll region specific. guess overall cases continue decrease next 2-3 weeks, sometime March increase slightly level now, go here. rough guess though lots unknowns play here. coworkers definitely said stuff like “I love masks; might keep wearing one forever!” saying like get compliments masks, even putting briefly Teams meetings. Sharon, you’re going catch screen. relax. beeing viral vector vaccine influence ability fend variants. matters part spike protein chose encode DNA carried virus carrier. read Madonna's covid 19 vaccine super confused.

Yes, people misunderstand articles. think majority understand US lot places behind end year. imagine find lot ridiculous hashtags like #flatearth doesn’t mean entertain ideas. UK funded Valneva vaccine (French-Austrian biotech company, kid not) producing first, EU might get deal 2022. I'm good deal negative people think it'll unconditionally summer still think things look lot better next year, pandemic end point

That's gonna help get many Chinese tourists Chinese still strict 2 week quarantine return home. think everyone knows bangladesh populated russia. seems constant misunderstanding (understandably, due poor reporting media) antibodies important aspect immunity. antibodies drop rapidly still likely immune. important factor memory B cells - respond virus reinfections rapidly recreate antibodies.

And want published review discussing importance immune cells antibodies, Nature review meant one knows they’ll cope physically they’ve got it. can’t predict body react one point said steroids would bad.

And said steroid severe covid useful.

Now this.

Converter confirmed. it’s Safe say, compare ‚new‘ mRNA vaccines ‚old‘ vector vaccines, mRNA vaccines way go future right?
I mean pros: higher protection, easier modify
Cons: storage vector vaccines easier produce. 
What think ?  good news saying vaccine effective emerging variants incorrect. biggest concern South African variant mention article. already proven bypass existing vaccines i.e. Pfizer Oxford. article correct. risky ease restrictions right United States, article focusing on. Cases, dropping amazingly quickly, still quite high.  media overhyping perceived inevitability variants order drive fear clicks, sub, particular daily discussion thread, overcorrected convinced variants meaningless. 


Some variants, like ones South Africa Brazil, present theoretical problems United States many months future. B117 variant, however, presents fairly credible threat immediate future.  data continues support increased transmissibility 50% range, limited ability trace variants showing definitely present United States almost certainly growing even versions virus shrink.

Does mean doomed? Absolutely not. Many experts agree US maintains current behaviors continues vaccinate schedule, cumulative benefits vaccination outweigh increased transmissibility B117 variant become prevalent enough cause another large wave cases.

But threat currently positioned defeat empty, riskless threat.  40+ million vaccinated even one shot make difference. Forget variants vaccine less effective against. 

The problem that, even successful vaccine roll-out protects 100% serious disease reaches 80% population, reduces transmission 2/3, (and taking children equation altogether) R0 2-2.5 12-20% population vulnerable serious disease (depending numbers unvaccinated previously infected).

Eventually get herd immunity final, brutal wave disease would infect 5-15% population within matter months way herd immunity. Lasers. shit magic. helps, one advantage mRNA quickly developed technology proven. Pfizer created mRNA vaccine within day sequencing genome virus.  Everything else trials, approvals, logistics. FDA said subsequent adjustments vaccines would require lengthy clinical trials (more like tweaks flu vaccines). logistics place, able keep pace virus. 70 percentage population vaccinated like 90%+ people eligible. Good luck. Seasonality community resistance. 

Mobility nothing metrics improving 

Why refuse acknowledge basic principles respiratory viruses? However, another paper/test saying modern Pfizer still somewhat effective African strain?

The key word “somewhat“. illustrate, new Novavax vaccine 96% efficacy plain vanilla Wuhan strain, even higher Pfizer Moderna. result overshadowed fact vaccine 57% efficacy South African strain. expect mRNA vaccines see drop efficacy bit more. drug users shoot fine, see problem dentist vet That's true. Herd immunity established around 70 percent population vaccinated. Covid likely around long time goal become dangerous common cold. Yes, studies likely reflection variants discovered. B.1.351 variant first discovered people South Africa identified October 2020, B.1.1.28 lineage P.1 variant identified people Manaus, Brazil January 6 2021. variants independently developed E484K mutations, likely exhibit similarities antibody resistance one another. E484K mutation recently detected variants B.1.1.7 lineage around Bristol, England, well, variant widespread P.1.351 P.1 variants. there’s time, there’s money, may safe get different vaccine. health departments would want prioritize vaccinating non-vaccinated people re-vaccinating already vaccinated people. it’s tough call. know, I'm saying many close winter every year. aren’t articles like this? Almost everywhere globally cases dropping dramatically. Why? variants U.K. Africa supposed spreading faster killing yet cases snd deaths dropping sharply. It’s coldest time year current rise predated holiday season. I’ve yet see decent explanation. used called sooner, sure recent trend doesn’t get attention. different using asthma medicine then, steroids inhaled, without (or little) systemic absorption? Well yeah haven’t even year. truly won’t know “a couple years” passes. me, first dose sore arm, muscle joint aches. Second dose sore arm day of, extremely tired next day, like ready sleep like 530pm either, compared world visited shop two weeks, driven car three weeks, done anything outside home go walk members household year, I'll take it.

And I'm means extreme shut-in - ordering groceries online, life basically bare minimum compliance actual laws here. Insurance won’t cover this. Yes reports infections cats dogs, denying reports. care pets too. They’re safer quarantine owners going vet visit get tested covid19. Exactly. Stop greedy. axe grinding isn’t me. I’m trying keep info straight. SA Brazilian variants concerning, even shitty vaccines seems keep hospitalizations deaths occurring. mRNA vaccines likely keep people getting severe (and even moderate) COVID even strains, already going testing booster them.

I’m optimistic! think mostly background noise summer countries able get adult population vaccinated. both. Infect 100 million African teenagers basically none die, even notice. Infect 100 million Americans... know happens. 0.23% could global IFR relies heavily under-reporting cases, albeit there's reason think average people poor countries getting tested barely notice symptoms. average age 70% less average age west, clear virus affects population whole much less. chart gives PTSD. genuinely hope opens general population summer/fall current rate vaccine distribution California right now, looks could vaccinating people 2023. swear wait even well 2022 get vaccine, raising fucking hell! [may ask complained Sputnik V published interim results, pointed AZ’s results also interim, you’re trying wiggle it.

it’s thought process hazy, mine nice! answer question simple: Money. 

I too, exhausted headlines. Since inception covid19 mutating, didn’t even start talking vaccines rolled public. top this, US done piss poor job compared EU tracking covid19 lineages. worried variants causing issues future, epidemiologists since March 2020. scientists aren’t blame, they’re job. Meanwhile, media - funded viewership - sat waited absolutely breed fear began come second peak pandemic. keeping people glued television revenue, speculate enjoy selling fear much unwitting public. media anchors statements “summaries” talking health expert cherry pick, literally comes medical advising. honestly illegal, don’t live money hungry country. negative? Cats dogs get covid-19 too. think get tested now, actually good news. vaccinated people still spread new mutations, mean herd immunity concept exist form protection get vaccine (or covid think dont want that)? people kinda anti-vax fear side effects etc., hoping 20-30% minority unvaccinated people protected herd immunity, basically busted decide getting vaccine getting covid long long run basically? imagine herd immunity everybody exposed covid eventually... stand corrected forgot 484 mutation part it. However, another paper/test saying modern Pfizer still somewhat effective African strain? pardon caddiiness later thread I'm getting worn good news yet bad news cycle. 18.4% UK England findings important.

  They’re people get idea world going shit. That’s literally whole sub. Obviously, internal dealings make worldview pessimistic, don’t agree think you’re impractical it’s whatever. They’re super radical people ignore anyone thinks continue live like years accomplish unrealistic, non-feasible goal mind sort personal motive behind views (mentally, socially, etc.) Wait licking door knobs ? Omg talking understanding. Stop downvoting hard. 

The airline industry conduct study tailored fit goals. one mannequin releasing steady stream particles air. told measurements seats extremely far away. omitted data one people sick detectable particles sitting next sick person couple seats away. mean, said sub full deniers people who've decided pandemic already they're correct whole point impossible certain around while. like they're concealing carefully guarded secret. Time dump AZ. focus making new vaccine. August latest. JnJ online 2 weeks, we’ll probably cruise right past 2 mil/day pretty quickly. Feels like we’re finally near end. That's bad headline unless trick get actually read article.

Logically, impossible test something emerging.  However article use language makes sense ""recently emerged variants"".

Aside verbiage, still skeptical sentiment since even confirmed effective recently emerged strains, like flu vaccine, strain mutation moving target. Nice! Hopefully won’t SB surge cases soon. actually clue efficacy Pfizer/Moderna vaccines SA variant. studies done. number compare likelihood getting infected (during similar timeframe),

Huh?? 40 1000 infected died 24 hr window? misleading headline. Covid19 deaths (40) take days weeks occur, diagnosed cases (1000) sample today. delay infection, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis (die live), even reporting central health agency countries. despicable, fact they're pushing UNLIKELY SCENARIO vaccines rendered useless criminal. Ok forgot 484 mutation. Sorry. looking ray hope forgot sub I'm in. hope allowed ""but this?"" never going end it? That's important distinction; ""effective"" used field-specific scientific sense, rather canonical English language sense. Astra Zeneca deemed ""not effective"" B.1.351, bit 50% threshold. seems like fairly arbitrary distinction, think using pop media articles, rather listing efficacy percentages, led lot public confusion. Thing Pfizer Moderna really sure. Based studies I've seen, AstraZeneca/Oxford actually done efficacy study ~4000 South Africans determine protective really is.

By comparison, Pfizer/Moderna looked antibodies test tube decided neutralising, albeit lessor extent. true Oxford vaccine.

that's basically happens already, stock prices follow reality lol mRNA based vaccines better future reason. mRNA vaccines specifically created coronavirus. Oxford/Astrazenca not. It’s development years first SARS break 2003. turned coronavirus similar enough one vaccine effective. mutations moving away dropping efficacy. think detected variation PCR tests, yet sequencing determine exact variant.

I'm sick stupid fucking articles advocating abandoning deep cleaning contaminates diseases breed surfaces.

Fucking stupid. People keep repeating far know moment it’s true. several vaccines produce sterilizing immunity flu pertussis vaccines. think it’s dangerous assume block transmission actually found true.

And far good regarding current vaccine new variants. Thanks heads up! 

My entire family fever days, than, dry stuffy nose days far symptoms go. incredibly lucky!! virus three damn components never seen: ease transmission, lethality (using host kill itself), &amp; mutation rates

Just name big hitters, Measles much higher rate transmission, Ebola much higher lethality, seen exact number paper COVID-19's mutation rate, everything I've read says pretty slow compared viruses. HIV much, much higher. get attacked posting ‘disinformation’. That’s happened similar post. Maybe things, even article reduces those. lost child tragically/unexpectedly, I'd probably difficult time supporting financially good long while. would make sense China intentionally leaked it.Do think biological weapon sth?(that first used people reason). fuels propaganda anti-maskers. main point masks dangerous work (well, one common). main point social engineering operation, pandemic tool reshape societies towards atomized world shut-ins without human interaction.

And honest messaging kind makes wonder whether onto something all. ""Covid big deal"" *dies covid* sensationalizing here. Jog on. advent mRNA platform, possible able better answer annual flu season? answer upcoming endemic pandemic faster one? though, antibodies don’t last long body get infected, albeit mild version. got another wave coming, getting around it. April people getting really relaxed like September. Plus variants unknown future variants. data showing previous infection doesn’t create whole lot antibodies long time. it’s really thing count first place.  assuming government mess booster shot looked like things control. Also lockdowns lifted vaccinated people start socializing. got Oxford vaccine yesterday (first dose) god feel like total shit. Slept 14 hours, feel incredibly drained, got fever night.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* got moderna vaccine covid 3 months before. know normal get symptoms receiving vaccine, Im trying scare you, go get vaccine. know, many people know covid positive saying feel lot like covid again. Idk happening people already covid happened every person know got both. pretty intense body aches, mind foggy, headaches. went completely away two days. would definitely suggest taking day can. Ah see. EU even signed deal Valneva. exploratory talks Valneva, deal probably coming soon. expect start deliveries Q1 2022, seems like limited numbers now. seems like Valneva vaccine mostly donated countries and/or used second round vaccinations possibly yearly COVID vaccine. do, poor bio security real concern. WIV allowed SARS escape known dangerous was. covid started field collection sample wouldn’t given anything like classification needed, could easily mishandled. insurance makes $100 3 months. talking cost without insurance, cost pay. locals complain every death marked Covid death well, even though covid related deaths. evidence pets spread COVID19, unless pet mink. places safer spring general lot virus fall rule. want hug grandma :( Yeah won't. still see epidemics rippling massive amounts spread I’ve heard explained radio doctors scientists refer antibodies confer effectiveness it’s easiest thing measure vaccine. 

There ways vaccine confers protection body’s immune system, they’re measurable. Tanzania correct- vaccines trusted. Good behaving caution. 
UV rays proved kill corona, living hot climate help them. ridiculous take lmao. Yeah, let’s quit game fourth quarter. Less 10% vaccinated plans rest within months? Nah, let’s say fuck right get sick. Sounds great. Probably huge chunk americans infected immunity it. serological test results, proportion young children sample SARS-CoV-2 infection low. Intrafamily transmission seemed plausible transmission within daycare centres. epidemiological studies needed confirm exploratory hypothesis. Sorry pessimistic, realistically, highly doubt country reach herd immunity vaccinations.

Just amount people anti vaccine insane, guess, countries would get 80% adults vaccinated max, probably &lt;66% children vaccinated due much lower risk. ..... and? Well carry gun reusable bag robber see coming. /s So, date red herring. nothing reality, yet keep communicating like has. Poor Kaliningrad :( researchers determine whether

Sure, problem people omit bit, repeat follows. nah right; better couple billionaires whose singular motivation profit unlimited capacity dictate literally billions people allowed discuss digitally get ready open clinic morning! Thank &amp; Fuck healthcare workers! “someone didn’t show don’t want waste dose” situation. Plus, coworkers got vaccinated quarantine. absolutely don’t know you’re talking about. suppose interpret recommendation ""We think definitely April 15th"", actually mean ""We think going April 15th least"". personally trust government given definite end date, would prefer give estimated date instead saying ""who fuck knows, permanent recommendation travel"". suppose people feel saying ""no travel date"" implies they've promised travel date absolutely okay, would clearer message differently. 

Noone really knows answer regardless put dates out. really fit point he's making. He's talking focus disinfecting surfaces costs money really address main way spreads. high profile athletes wear mask sideline certainly theater, exactly cost much anything scheme things effort get others wear masks situations matters. Masks address main way virus spreads, air. wouldn’t count guys get done hurry, talking fighting last five years still date locked arrive that? Please tell us qualifications? Yeah really sad want push narrative like this. would one thing honestly said ""We supply better vaccine fill now"" instead ""It matter one get, get offered"". 

If go read J&amp;J published study clearly avoid comments effective vaccine ""mild"" ""symptomatic"" covid. guess long covid mild infection thing and/or ignored. amazing dismissive people it. 

I know touching J&amp;J AZ vaccines. I'll take chances time get one others. Definitely, let's give elected representatives job. really working well us January sixth.  

/s, case needed. What's new variants. I'm impressed. Exactly: “previous experience shows likely around two years, know, won’t absolutely know two years actually come pass.” yea first dose moderna cake, mostly sore arm. super excited 2nd...but also excited it. No, comparable one another. Found guy know happens governments empowered regulate speech. happened me

got contact traced phantom symptoms

tested negative though Yeah. avoid bad news, it’s annoying don’t like sand. It’s coarse it’s rough it’s irritating gets everywhere. Pardon ignorance thought asymptomatic didn’t experience harsh effects symptomatic people. Still recruiting last week. even signed got appointment. Oh wow totally misread comment like moron. thought said long term effects covid heart. wrote entire comment thinking issues started recently, covid. used work Pakistani hospital CanSino trial happened asked buddies it. vaccine mostly safe, 40,000 people miniscule amount got sick. staff vaccinated virus too. safe. COVID cases 100k, first time since November!

Disneyland set paid food tasting experience March. 

Disneyland trying reopen limited capacity soon.

Malls open across california, food courts well. Lines people eating together outside curbs. 

Grocery Stores saturday super bowl crowded people yelling phones without masks. 

Funeral homes across inland empire full bodies. 

This news good, fear imminent wave coming soon. can't shutdown forever. increasing numbers vaccines, wearing masks parks reducing capacity open manner ""safe enough"". What's magic number head open parks (and closed businesses)? Zero? realistic (stands up) kids won't. daily tests performed still moment? Less test performed lower cases. playing Devils advocate here. revolt distance learning extended next school year.

They revolted first full school year, area. large parochial school system talking going 100% NTI. large swath parents told would send kids public schools get NTI free unless promised close, churches, faced losing tons tuition money, followed money, almost always do. diapers, wipes, non-perishables online selection limited. also used get milk, cheese, select fruit/veg, occasionally meat - mainly I’m missing now, end world! Ok live Chicago too, hell im going keep wearing mask pandemic, cold wind actually nice. fooling around wrapping scarf face? dont make super fuzzy soft knit masks keep face warm? dont need extraneous scarf material.  big dick drag floor /r/bigdickproblems. someone posted different thread yesterday, efficacy really confusing target days. Without real world large scale trials there's much guessing fact press jumps every tiny study blows click hair really help. biggest beef FL success story perspective possibly state churn people coming FL punctuated trips. Many stay week least 2.  get wrong people get Covid anywhere point trip decision travel  average incubation time symptom onset roughly 5 days there's good chance flying lot Covid cases people bringing misery back hometown. 

Before call speculation, exactly happened friend's dad mom.  flew FL week symptomatic Covid day got back (and gave rest family PA (one family member hospitalized)). next town one prominent deaths summer (a beloved community figure) traveled FL right Covid infection (the whole family got symptoms 2 day retuning). doubt much state control population size know FL pretty much epitome open comparison states. Good summary vaccination issues facing elderly Upstate NY, represent disproportionate share population (compared NYC). SA variant appears  Yep, race vaccinate becomes crucial.

Last year countries saw peak, decline followed spike 2-3 months later people got complacent tried get back normal. 

But pretty much every vulnerable person wants shot gets one May next wave far less lethal.

If guess trajectory US, continue decline till March/April start pick people get less careful- there'll moderate spike new strains summer large scale vaccination major impact severity spread, gradual decline afterwards, covid becoming background disease like flu- annual rollouts tweaked vaccines battling dangerous infectious variants. Covid still thing time next year, something need spend time thinking about, matter updating shots year risk category. Theres kind major sampling bias Ok, waiting approval start producing? reason can't start stockpile now? think reality gloom doom. Must lame living head sand! Wow awful. would say report health department dont know would result boss treating wife poorly firing her. 75 year old mother law type 1 diabetes, heart disease, needs double knee replacement, thought cold....and bad got covid. Reddit go gaga this. site already hates Valentine's Day. valve problems. born Swedes fucked head one guy: responsible lax Covid approach resulting deaths. really understand could fucking stupid. *smh* People understand. originally wrote respond someone asked ""why, cases falling SA, Brazil, UK, etc"". least person understand possibility (though comment got deleted reason).

Anyway, experts think strong possibility. lots factors, can't really tell. Vaccine rates, fast variants spreading, whether people keep wearing masks social distancing, etc matter. 

Stuff like tad worrisome, 8, 2021 -- variant first detected United Kingdom rapidly becoming dominant strain several countries doubling every 10 days United States, according new data.

While cases US going down, appear increasing rapidly US certain variants. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 300 thousand new cases day dude Admin not. still plenty stupid people out. completely think Biden better Covid think worldwide takes actions get results. unfortunately can’t give Biden credit drop. Mind business I'd bet 80% never went concerts first place. Lol retarted chimpanzee . Stfu stupid name !! Lmao slap hard comment reeks classism overly cautious extremely destructive line thinking case. take action based abundance caution overshoot needed you’ve done significantly harm society necessary. real costs cautious outlooks acting those.  turned working South Africa variant

It's ironic label ""trashy"" original AstraZeneca study take gospel South African study much poorer quality. butthurt downvotes stated fact might impact numbers people get feelings hurt.

Facts care wittle feewings: quote: ""More females males disorder, generally begins middle adulthood."" .5 lbs/week = slow
Making fat fuck stop stuffing fat fucking face= hard
But making fat fucks wear mask fat fuck President cult leader anti mask stupid fuck alternative facts = also hard nitpick want. dozens studies show you.

You took issue study N95 masks. here's one cloth masks - incorrectly claimed second article referenced BLM protests. reality cited 14 different studies. Day day variations pretty large. Less people get tested weekend example. 7 day average better look trend. also shows consistent drop though. Yeah, no. keep living fear, refuse wear mask vaccines widely available. That’s draw line refuse keep living fear. point getting vaccinated can’t go back normal? Superbowl entered chat would explain I’ve passing every time turn microwave. Burning books next? “knowledge futile” That’s small sample size it’s less meaningless impact becomes similar.

And yet not. reduced fatalities point 90% would still multiple orders magnitude higher flu deaths year. Multiple. Orders. Of. Magnitude. Doctors literally telling longhaulers ""It's anxiety."" Like, anxiety made lungs form scars, sheesh. 'Running people infect?'

lol

'deaths going plummet negligible levels month well.'

double lol. Three four months, maybe.

There's lot ignorance wishful thinking upvotes received. loving girlfriend thankfully, don’t know would alone. feel like I’ve maybe recovered 10-15% past 5 months? rate doesn’t seem like I’ll better time soon, ever.

Sorry deal :( brain fog honestly terrifying...every mental task difficult Bless heart, believe conspiracy theories. That's adorbs. claim make want source? built, state also neglected give actual guidance allowed ""outdoors"" even meant. hundreds restaurant owners trying make went along, result. I’m history teacher. vocab terms. Obviously. Nina Turtles 🐢 Mutant Virus 🦠  Bless heart, actually believe numbers!! That’s precious Man, that'd something 

How wife's experience injections? first last Thursday. Tiny bit sore arm me, symptoms. Figured might placebo, friend get Pfizer vaccine day basically experience so, knows. would take estimated higher case count (diagnosed cases + undiagnosed cases) try figure ""true"" death rate based diagnosed cases? accept premise cases diagnosed, impossible escape conclusion deaths also, due failure test failure properly test failure diagnose. 

It evident since beginning lot undiagnosed cases involve deaths. little month in. headache comes back point every day. I’ll random days start coughing lot chest hurt. brain fog worst part. NEVER stops gets worse time time. I’ll get dizzy, can’t focus, it’s like severe derealization. It’s really bothersome I’m trying get used it. 

I’m sorry hear you’ve dealing five months. hope completely recover soon! Hopefully aren’t dealing alone. There’s mall town small toddler playspace. Kiddo going age feels safe go back (not hard; height limit 40” he’s currently 38.5” tall), I’m sad all. Yeah us OG coronavirus fans still waiting summer vacation crowd clear lived here, wouldn’t asking that. Biden recovery  Wow, low case count today? Wasn’t day like 96k? That’s pretty massive drop.  think Dentists would great resource give vaccines. parents son caught covid within last two weeks mend hopefully keep path (my son already gotten 15-16 months old parents considered at-risk 60s). 

It worried greatly them. around dad got tested, unmasked outside 10 min catch it, would probably asymptomatic able get tested unless symptoms don't. make sure mask stores. Yeah seem consensus around 3-4x, early January, [Gottlieb estimated 30% would exposed end January, 4x cases time.

This actually good news... 30% exposure plus 10-15% vaccinations (with overlap) we're close 50% population immune. wife works vet. 10 days ago one ladies works front desk tested positive Covid. caught cousins visited week before, likely exposed everyone office week. head vet owner decided remain open require employees even get covid test. Luckily wife managed avoid catching got negative test weekend.

Today work employee sneezing day said taste smell anything. also decided get tested even learning previous employee tested positive. owner still yet anything. reference taking place Arizona. anything powerless situation? wealthy neighborhood vast majority clients coming 60+ years old. whole thing feels extremely negligent. little money right since can’t work like even know doctors say there’s nothing done, kind feels pointless get one. maybe anyway. free live civilised country hugging friends absolutely happen year, even maybe international flights option. hang there, day come. totally agree vaccine completely safe vaccines widely available anyone wants them, I’m going back normal. means mask. go along “new normal” everyone antivaxxers vaccine.

As question: yes, concert experience compromised mask. Drinking singing along part good concert experience. types concerts go crowded, standing room venues gets hot fuck. won’t even bother returning concerts wear mask. pandemic end you? 
“Indeed, data suggests considerable amount cross-reactivity recognition hosts immune response different coronavirus infections” answer no. didn’t. For? got fully dosed, C rarely B months now, knocking door. AZ effective J&amp;J one shot read articles primarily editorials opinions, small studies check things like droplet trajectory virus transmission.

The first article editorial, cites study people wearing N95 masks work hospital reduce infections, masks people wearing public.

2nd article says uses fact BLM protests ""did seem trigger spikes infections"" evidence... actual data anything.

Also cites statistical studies try draw correlation regions masks spread, endless droplet analysis.

But none study actual virus spread. J&amp;J, Novavax, Moderna, pfizer, CureVac, etc use mutation protein elicites many it. constant. testing become available, undetected rate almost certainly dropped.

In pandemic's early days, hardly anyone could get test. paper covers essentially March-June 18. 12x time period surprising, line Gu's model many others. Today, Gu estimates somewhere 3-4x.  Buy oximeter oxygen levels. Source? right-i sure misremembering. Almost like wuhan seemed world away year ago? look data, studies science...not anecdotes. Yeah sure get can't possibly believe enough variance among 20+ data points comparison Florida similar states completely question without accounting them. I'd understand comparing Los Angeles slums Mexico City we're anything sort.

There! Cherry picking argument solved. Florida sits somewhere middle list, South Dakota sits somewhere closer top. course multiple variables play guy, I'm talking one: **lockdowns**, seem much correlation locked-down states non locked-down states terms spread virus. Therefore, would much rather trade say California heavily locked Florida locked suffer consequences virus according numbers. make baffling attitude toward virus variant vaccine touch hits. Sigh Post source didn't

""People absolutely gotten infected, spread virus, died fomite transmission""

Im still waiting sources worry good economy done get some. hold till 2030! lots prior experience capitalism. Plus, last year, Republicans add rule, earlier COVID bill, Pharma companies can't sued mistakes, something like that?  
   
Also, weird many people downvoting sensible caution. They. Welded. People. Into. Their. Homes. In. Wuhan.

They arrested pregnant women Australia promoting anti-lockdown events. 

Nations hailed Covid hysterics done right demanded tracking apps people’s phones times. 

It way “occasional masks” well know. 

They traded away liberty little extra temporary safety. half mutants LA COVID-19? Title confusing. Also, looks like article says 7 years world whole, US. 

Also, cases going nationwide month. Spotted European know what’s crazy Russia may biggest country world doesn’t even crack top 8 highest population.... makes article really concerning He’s literally talking excited go spend money again. Isn’t precisely get economies life support? people know covid didn’t even get tested. back March April wasn’t easy get test.

But flu like symptoms 2 weeks trouble going stairs cause breathing assume that’s it. Wait. looked article again, looks like says 7 years entire world, 1 year US. I'm deleting this. made mistake aunt gave vaccines dentist. apparently got specific compliments providers vaccinated well done painless said something us like... usually putting shots GUMS! need careful! Anyone limited days off, starters. fuck happening Canadian vaccinations June bride here, postponed September. 

Guest comments place. Back October asked constantly postponing (8 months new date). vaccine news came like light switch - people started giving us tips renting suits talking pre wedding events. winter happened. weird mix saying events happen 2022 (concerts, Broadway, traveling) sentence telling us excited see us June. Maybe we've told everyone getting married June matter what? Idk. mind fuck. 

I wish best July. really sucks postpone twice!! worth, think summer much better time wedding anytime past year. also think public sentiment change come spring. Fingers crossed. article says 7 years entire world. USA estimated 10 months read article actually go Bloomberg tracker. 3 deaths result vaccine

lol don’t think it’s much vaccines make life perfectly safe summer - Biden make everything safe. think it’s latter point - reality people can’t take much threshold “what low enough risk go back living life” grown point people see light. Again, light total risk free living - growing risk tolerance lowered risk levels vaccine going intersect probably point summer. WeSTSiDe! lol nobody conceding opinions. one said anything shutting forever, thousands people dying everyday. give shit bored staying inside saving people's lives important. already nebulizer home spare albuterol youngest son used get colds sounded like hard time breathing. would help sleep better.

Anyway, immediately plan case us trouble breathing if/when got covid.

It suggested media. made sense head. Trouble breathing? Try nebulizer. work hospital. don’t know counting patients code brought back life. Hey bro wanna jump support people totally irrational, started May/June studies saying overwhelming majority covid cases came aerosol/droplet transmission rather fomite transmission somehow everyone embraced popular myth fomite transmission rare. want ask people would touch something infected person coughed rub eyes, mean really believe can't get infected way full shit? Antibodies infection fight. it’s memory cells, again, activate infection comes around again. Okay, well Sputnik V team sent raw data lancet, also group external experts - that's one example. analysis discussion data publicly published. 


So critique exactly? Thank god. looking forward repeating day 2nd dose feels, 3rd booster dose. shit sucked. I’m I’m almost default since work home don’t visit people. get vaccine (which I’m dead last line for) I’ll probably move B/C I’ll visit people still distance mask up. emergency? needs place far away soon? expertise treating immune thrombocytopenia said suspected vaccine play role. said cases vaccination likely ***exceedingly rare***, possibly result ***unknown predisposition*** people react vaccine developing immune response destroys platelets. disorder occurred, rarely, people received inoculations, particularly measles-mumps-rubella one.   Bussel said important share information cases, severe thrombocytopenia serious, physicians need know treat it.*** Sometimes condition resists standard therapies, low platelet counts persist, patient faces increasing risk severe bleeding even brain hemorrhage. 

No, vaccines dangerous besides allergic reactions, people need watch bruising bleeding skin caused lack platelets.  think point article. briefly scared March, April calmed back down. odds dying didnt sound bad then, really now. Give two weeks Superbowl, St Patrick's, cinco de mayo, 4th July, generic ""summer"".

You smell that? We're looking right shit pipe Randy! soon people get vaccine. point matter vaccine becomes useless due variant. We'll add misery lives move on. Great.

Any indication isn’t case? general pessimistic “point” making. Maybe stayed home. Welcome United States losers. inflammatory mediators destructive process, I’m pretty sure cases COPD due things like smoking chronic exposure hazardous chemicals/pollutants. idk mean mean lockdown now. ""Pandemic over"" translate ""lockdown forever"" going offset carbon pollution? not, like wearing mask? try normalize individuals irrational fear vaccine.

At end day, black anti-vaxer harmful society white anti-vaxer. They're same. OMG, imagine took seats completely, people space!!! also change cycles testing? Plus get biscuit afterwards i'd agree. day far boris starts crying presser. evacUKate. 7 years current pace. Key words ""current pace."" vaccination rates contunue increase. reason believe continue snails pace started. think PR. Operation Warp Speed said they’d ton doses ready go day 1 (like 100 million something I’m remembering correctly). Clearly didn’t come fruition. 

It’s possible took long get manufacturing running, knows get married, matter happens variants. Maybe friends show, maybe don't. Either way, fucking time life. It'll day, theirs. Life's short. nothing builds confidence product idea like silencing voices anyone like it! Blocked trying claim victory concession speech. course does. point saying this? Right? sudden everyone extremely negative mean. flip flopping. One week saying something gets downvoted hell, next week line gets awards really don’t care do. get lonely see everyone else fun come caves. Okay well really matter much about? They've covered CTE decades, think NFL willingly giving info makes enabling deadly pandemic profits? Yep - early data is. OK, sorry fucks. I've stores many times, mostly food, clothes shopping dining. made ample stash n95s jan/Feb 2020 ride way. anxious getting covid chances small (I still get it, understand that). previous post come anxiety rather anger people ignored pandemic day one, today either wear mask wear chin think life soon normal. vaccinating slowly, b117 spreading. Mutations actually result us allowing many hosts. angry end mutations. made covid endemic behaviors. want get back normal hope soon will. see light end tunnel ""superb owl"" comes videos Tampa flood internet. angry morons. wait two months, hopefully Yolo summer fucking wait, put mask on, keep focus... smart. Nope, gonna happen.... economy yet another topic, look amount dollars printed recent months, evictions, dead businesses, lost jobs, compounding another 2 trillions pumped Biden admin kicking road, placing trash. 🌈🐻 /s Post text. AZ targets full spike protein (S), others mostly target modified spike protein (S-2P). Don’t ask makes difference seems possible reason AZ’s doesn’t hold new variants. Early data shows Pfizer effective UK South Africa variants. sure Brazil would mean fatality rate three times lower reported. Good news! don’t want interact people, may keep mask avoid whole “you smile comment”🤦🏻‍♀️ Life normal NYC actually go opera Broadway show without wearing mask. sub funny. awhile I’ve begun see adherence “vaccines going great fix everything summer” fervor dissimilar blind loyalty “hope” promoted covid deniers antimaskers. Almost like liberal version same. It’s depressing, we’ve clearly seen damaging toxic optimism pandemic. suspect there’s unsaid loyalty Biden admin everything happens Democrat presidency, well reality people can’t take much restrictions, especially who’ve following closely taking everything seriously nearly year now. true 1% That's potentially gonna happen year two. hopefully easily get vaccine tweaked rolled booster.

I mean covid example that. shit years bird flu swine flu etc. I'm surprised many take seriously months still today. JnJ vaccine effective SA variant.. prevents severe symptoms, hospitalization, death. good thing many vaccine alternatives. Good chance one sticks. Basically, countries adopt similar restrictions ones already used East/South East Asia, sounds alright me. Meanwhile know 40 year old guy overweight otherwise alright died. daughter still going parties...  I've seen somebody first told keep science Pfizer already run full mutation. turned case. presented Pfizer released press release turned exact paper except preprint. showed Columbia study, authors paper already addressed media release claimed authors study concluded Pfizer vaccine would still effective made claim. Then, issue mutations used UT paper full mutations excluded even additional RBD mutation Moderna used studies. factor declining immunity time seen Moderna duration study ultimately affects efficacy even short 3 month time span...

It's one thing another. come keep science expect respect? Get high horse. We’re going lockdown summer even bad scenario happened, you’re kidding think Advisory board regulatory body. purposely group external experts. may driven ignorance evidence things like anxiety depression correlated greater perception pain, chronic fatigue, delayed recovery surgery, etc. 

Just saying evidence psychological factors impact disease recovery. Like compared hyper-optimistic person symptoms, outside observer would think person much better symptoms exactly alike. attitude actually translate faster slower recover depend approach healing process. works teach people critical thinking skills, binary culture, even understand true concept discernment anymore. 1 million? rate general population? yes  Canada: Please Sir, want more. keep mind count undiagnosed deaths too... Could anything strokes/heart attacks states intentionally hid cases. California variant news feed showed 'Pfizer hopes cut vaccine.. ' mild panic attack! :P already insurrectionist tendencies simmering boil Isn’t Walgreens giving out? buss sustainable I'm sure we're due significant increase due b117 variant introduced. Go go USA! Gotta spread all! calm Superbowl superspreader storm that's comin'!  There's also slight misconception and/or exaggerated belief surgical mask effective filtering pollution/smog air. Username checks Nice! expect see approval date distribution couple days later? someone send 7 inbox messages saying lying said covid never fully eradicated user going kill “slow vaccine rollout” kept up. weird today. Haha. teenager 90s pulled braces, like that. fun, also mom cheap drove ass cheap dentist hood. lol. put getting wisdom teeth pulled years ago 30s. time much advanced. special tools would crack tooth pulled right out. shocked simple was. One bit complicated impacted. super easy. Face swell eating Doritos day 3 surgery. AZ likely getting approved US use anytime soon tbh.

Who would want take wait 3 months doses gonna get line one options SA variant. Capitalism stupid. fear death myself, really want end hospitalized (in addition burden system, hospital sucks right now), fearful infecting one patients - lot elderly see anyone else, one came virus worry somehow give them. Fucked around. Found out. mask mandates end anyone wants vaccine get one masks longer required suppress spread keep vulnerable people getting infected? vaccine now. keeping hospitals getting overrun. going several months people still dying vaccine widely available. intentionally throw people meat grinder would survived given opportunity get vaccinated? human decency

No. I'll show human decency right GOP starts so. u/tb0x u/Hotzendorf1918 mean get feel like J&amp;J dragged long time. Thanks reply. seems like CAL.20C seemingly flying radar coverage. Yet, rapidly taking California's case load, accounting 30% Next time save everyone time declare hopeless anti-vaxxer get-go. There's need go BS. wife find different vet clinic work at. vet clinic hasn’t letting clients building since March 15, closed two weeks (with pay) twice employees tested positive. Wonder insurance company actually paid service providers. often little 10% stated (to patient) charge. I’ll translate dumbfounded non-Americans (and Americans arent horrifically callous): “Fuck got mine” Ohh Seriously? I'm joking friend :) Sweden (no lockdown): 1 death per 850 people

UK (infinite lockdowns): 1 death per 600 people

When over, need take long hard look ineffective lockdowns proved be. that’s gonna happen Praise Science ""new"" vaccine could cover several variants, one. Varies. Pfizer, first second dose, worst complaint sore arm time. Can't say experienced noteworthy symptoms. read article today (I believe) Pfizer able shorten manufacturing process something crazy like 11 days. One sec let double-check.

Ninja edit: Pfizer shortened process 110 60 days. still takes that’s still crazy improvement. makes selfish then, get judge acceptable risk her. proven capable living without human contact, exception. mean fact polio still isnt totally eradicated...proves point lol. many decades now? think bigger question different new vaccine need it’s needs new trials? Somehow get flu shots every year new strains suppose big year. get covid? delivery method it’s similar mrna based vaccine design start cranking newly expanded capacity? 8 mo testing every time new strain? Public health experts said even coronavirus becomes regular threat human health, Americans continue taking every possible measure protect themselves.

Public health experts lot things say nobody follows.

Masks commonplace post-summer America barring unforeseen circumstances. Idk, read ICU psychosis like fully medicated awake vent... shit certainly scares me. could also already one disability like thought getting covid, surviving, becoming even debilitated already am. No. make sense. way vaccine current variant works less SA one, giving people vaccine SA variant would cover current ones less. They'll given. It’s 5 percent people infected shares almost characteristics post-viral symptoms almost always clear up. 

That’s know. 
That’s honest. 

Any scary nonsense past quite literally made based nothing. allow made scenarios discussion, discussion becomes pointless it’s longer based reality. certain vaccines

AFAIK, that'd singular, AZ one. paramedics, veterinarians, cosmetologists give Botox. 0 delay vaccines produced injected peoples arms. Literally life death alternative, doubt damage 21 gauge needle outweighs societal cost getting people atleast first shot. Shit give hourlong class I’m sure it’s rocket science shooting 1.8ml arm. Shoot Performance enhancements took Tijuana pharmacy bathroom 5ml went butt. flew United recently packed flight. end made announcement need remain seats “maintain social distancing”.

According CDC data, United States Thursday reported 618 cases novel coronavirus variants across 33 U.S. states. total 611 cases B.1.1.7 variant first identified United Kingdom, research suggests transmissible, potentially deadly, possibly less susceptible vaccines earlier variants Five cases B.1.351 variant first identified South Africa, research suggest transmissible less susceptible vaccines earlier variants virus; Two cases P.1 variant first identified Brazil, research suggest transmissible less susceptible vaccines earlier variants virus.

Let's address piece piece.

""Suggests"" term scientists use something looks like *might* go one direction information needed.

So going post fearmonger rise new variants (which know doing. recognize username, posting links fairly often agenda ""variants prolong this, get used it.""), agree [some data suggesting Moderna effective U.K. variant worth fearmongering yet. I've found studies say Pfizer works UK variant well.

There's also data suggesting [Moderna effective B.1.351 \(South I've found studies say Pfizer works South African variant well.

I can't really find information Brazil variant, think spreading U.S. much. Ah yes, ol' ""the people die old people deserved it"" canard first read Madonna’s covid vaccine Worth mentioning avoid NSAIDs. Tylenol regional equivalents only. according health experts haven’t even seen effect vaccines yet. things look without seeing effects mass vaccinations, imagine look like see that.

Pulmicort, Advair, Singulair. got wondering carry old days. fatigue first dose joke...I felt several days shot. think better access always good. However primary care doc tries keep patients date vaccines dentists report vaccines given state database similar (my state database) anyone else see patient shot. Big pharmacies bad reporting little pharmacies rural hospitals report (extra unpaid hassle). Employers often report. Flu clinics (like Sam's report). Patient's often remember vaccine. Often ""already one year"" got 19/20 flu season shot early 20 realizing Fall 2020 shot different. Canada two centres. Calgary Toronto*. Winter peg neither those.

Thank fuck numbers December look table. estimate 4.6x infections compared confirm cases. 100-130M infected Americans 30-40%. 

Hope don’t get banned summarizing government data speaking simple facts. You’re livelihood obviously isn’t affected worthless lockdowns dipshit. continue lockdown, rest us move on.  What's ""safe""?

Add mounting pile evidence that, looking it, we’d found UK variant everywhere November. four grandparents died long Covid. think so. There's really limit much mRNA inject. see reason can't inject multiple different mRNAs different proteins once. CureVac/GSK attempting mRNA. 

However, limit much adenovirus inject adenovirus get sick inject much, would limit amount mRNA gets produced adenovirus.  K US? think general pushed long term economic effects virus wayside. people get it, even survive, chance Medical debt can't pay. worse handle pandemic likely mutate, worse handled higher list vaccine, seems like sort thing makes sense feels unjust people would it. someone ELI5 terms percentage effective current vaccines speculated current known variants? Yeah, long jobs there? 6-18 months go back normal? first rule long covid nobody talks long covid. Rather fight SA variant, fighting SA variant plus others.

There time 13 months ago facing one strain COVID19 little protection against. go well us. Yep, work trauma positive pts GSW MVCs. Trippy Promising UK variant. South Africa variant seems concern. meaningless exclamation. medical malpractice still fresh communities color. sterilization experimental drugs. personally gonna wait see.

Yes, certainly happened. ancestors victimized America. However, worse that, ancestors *denied* healthcare comparable whites denied altogether even critical (my father miraculously survived severe infection grandmother, nurse, drove hospital hospital finally one would admit him).

My point blacks black communities disproportionately affected Covid, cases, terms high-end life saving treatments.

Vaccines offered all. trust vaccine delivered community delivered white community, simply go white community get vaccine.

Don't victimized racism America past experiences preventing current means help. said emergency; requirement? Actually said need said nobody needs great need anywhere soon.

I mean picky. free speak mind, lol. blame lying though, threat getting imprisoned exercising human rights must persuasive.

Feel free deny want, know criticize China CCP risk. Go ahead prove wrong. Prove chained dog. hold breath. West coast :) 

I've really hard lately trying host wedding June. Looks like venue giving us agreeable parameters, thing holding social pressure (will get ostracized society wedding? Etc). recent call couple friend groups, asked - ""how would guys feel us somewhat normal-ish wedding?""

The response really supportive. covid-cautious people life - live bay area. agreed already took lot steps make things safer (postponing, outdoor, spaced tables plated food, etc) postponing would probably disproportionate amount hassle. get little gloomy, even sent links articles vaccinations ramping optimistic me. really sweet.

I think reason getting many comments postponing twice already. spread word June tweak needed work, comments postponing stopped. get comments people saying wedding one thing look forward too. Like beacon light (hopefully close to) end. 

I agree poster below, point, people come, come. don't, don't. postponed twice already, best can. also - people tell couples wedding wayyyyy often. that's tale old time lol. Covid no. CDC recommendations first groups get healthcare providers residents aged care.

Like said, healthcare providers obviously high risk transmission since definition encounter bunch sick people every day.

The question whether 80yos high risk transmission interesting one- yes likely hitting clubs getting about, live large aged care facility effectively living share house large number people, many need close contact physical assistance workers moving around home . saw cruise ships early pandemic sort environment recipe high rates transmission.

The factor think infections much less likely underreported elderly begin with(because much likely get sick therefore get diagnosed), change rates transmission amongst group going affect overall figures disproportionate amount. Canadians going wake one day stupid number vaccines real quick here.

The amount timing means many arrived yet compared countries. Canada starts getting supply, it’s going go lightening quick. Yes, issue people want vaccine able fully immunized mid late summer. Fully immunized groups acceptable 2 weeks second dose involved. lived Russia I'd probably think drunken tuesday morning construction site parkour cool hobby too. hope isn’t silly ask but.. mean people OG Covid infection still antibodies protect new variants? Correct. People dumb looking rules/laws rather reasons behind them. transition periods people. never going disappear overnight. feel like 10 year olds understand science facts behind better many adults. U.S. 600M Pfizer/Moderna doses ordered agreement delivery end summer. 400M expected June.

About 65 million Americans age 16. remaining 270 million Americans, I'm guessing 1/4 (probably sadly) want vaccine. ~400 million doses cover everyone age 16 wants one. 1.5 percent 2 percent. Basically need study more. good worried things studied positive note we've got lot previous research done we're starting scratch. people actually supporting 2022.

The ones hysterical, borderline /r/collapse users. Good point. hope getting stuck quarantine mindset. multiply chance serious illness .05 seems like great thing. nyt article today 2/8:

Pfizer Moderna said preliminary laboratory studies indicate vaccines, still protective, less effective B.1.351.

South Africa halted use AstraZeneca-Oxford coronavirus vaccine evidence emerged vaccine protect clinical-trial participants mild moderate illness caused contagious virus variant first seen  already happening right comments. people know excited getting thinking ""Maybe I'll wait...they need censor everything up."" Based what? Disabled children tried years get remote learning accessible assure doesn’t mean anything. far evidence Pfizer Moderna safe effective “ traditional” vaccine. requires participation can. get vaccinated made choice protected way feel it. sore arm. team members adverse symptoms people hyping up. felt crappy one day shot, vacation symptoms ranging chills, low-grade fever, headache, body aches.

Basically felt like mild flu symptoms. think overhyping ridiculous every one say there's question 100% worth it. Ask yourself, worth taking *chance* mild flu-like symptoms **for day**, order guarantee staying vent chance death?

It's brainer. let sensationalism scare you. Russia technically exists 30 years, territory entire empire, mention completely devastated 40 20 years ago absolutely straw man, read headlines like “X won’t resume 2024.” Youre absolutely delusional. deadly virus doesnt give fuck weak-willed people handle. Bars open later. comes someone thoughtful insightful :) Well wore fucking mask year ago long hard road. are...... Still bitching fabric cloths. felt totally fine 2nd shot Weird. would think people get vaccinated, would become harder people believe fake news stuff see vaccine causing weird things people vaccinated ones getting sick. 

I think fact many people got indifferent now. felt fine x 💯 Illinois approved dentists administer vaccine health clinics working see administer offices vaccine supply increases. know owner practice work doesn’t want administer office potential high volume post op calls patients adverse reactions could see big hindrance many dentists wanting administer location. don’t buy wearing masks another 6 months public stores workplaces people vaccinated drastically reducing people’s quality life. think school closures worth debating mask mandate people vaccinated reasonable. Moderna's CEO also gave us general estimate half life long thinks vaccine last.

I think Pfizer released commentary long think vaccine remain effective. know comments literature? It’s Covid science. It’s evaluating cost/benefit safety vs freedom. would get vaccine covid one month ago read article. usually information explained. Wooo! Glad got Moderna. 

I still human sacrifice going grocery store since I'm one vaccinated. 

Downside, get ass grocery store. 0.5% NYC died Covid. think 100% infected? hope - that’s one got ? Every thread involves people talking want lockdowns eased think we’ve reached herd immunity 30 percent. sub joke. Tylenol is. looking forward headache. Oh shock another anti vaxx covid forever article NYT saying try stop end choice. child wanting ice cream parents choice. brother riding motorcycle without helmet choice. can't physically stop like parent stop child eating ice cream. Totally not. 

Governments strict cold war. Even 21st century, way America rules Iraq still dispotic China today, one seems sad that. 

As see, political issues, nothing related ""cultures"". enough people vaccinated restrictions lifted 95 percent less chance catching spreading dangerous disease. top comfortable things like eating out, seeing friends family indoors infectious usually bad quality. It’s 5G module syncing towers going feel like shit 24 hours so, passes day feeling? get 2nd dose tomorrow They're less effective, still ""effective"" barely. I've family full COVID symptoms. might suck days better laying bed barely able breathe move guessing whether tomorrow gets better end ER. Typo meant say ""got it"". talking people thread got vaccine. would kill symptoms...Canadian likely won’t get vaccine September. :( read beyond headline come informed understanding probably California hell time Covid.  amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

Dr. Anders Tegnell guided Sweden's public health policy clear mind steady hand, resulted fewer per-capita deaths many countries implemented punitive, damaging, tyrannical policies total lockdowns. easy example:

Sweden (no lockdown): 1 death per 850 people

Yes, America island totally independent rest world. /s case obvious. 100% wrong. immunity still long ways off

North Dakota entered chat simple twofold deduction: 1) Antibodies created expectancy varied shotgun scatterblast short term solution infection (see: Getting cold twice winter mutations abound) providing less tailored, homogenous approach example MRNA-vaccine, thus need vaccinate even elderly already disease. 2) simply information data mutations Covid-19 interact human endogen antibodies, since data, cannot assume safe.

Tldr; never safe proven. even then, ever mostly safe. Medicine partly rolling statistics. Past 2022? Nope. mRNA ones understanding, way reactogenic include one antigen. side effects would eccessive. 

Maybe Novavax I’ve reading many half adults asymptomatic COVID-19 abnormal CT scans lungs (ground glass) also heart abnormalities neurological issues. also article asymptomatic children blood vessel damage. 

My daughter 7, wouldn’t able forgive became infected Covid ended lifelong health problems. realize I’m lucky stay home help virtual class work. I’m rush send back know certain kind damage health-wise, Covid population. say human contact? ever say that. said people shouldn’t Super Bowl Christmas parties. Omg keep putting words mouth.

Good luck country one cares about. open up, Americans westerners travel countries quite often, live access healthcare. baby don’t really sleep moment anyway :) Already California think Florida, it? news report listening morning recall they're concerned become dominant strain long.

I voiced concern scenario COVID first arose cracking hard enough globally. need lock much prevent spreading prevent different strains. pandemic right now, last thing need endemic. Slowing spread strains way we'll able control it. lose ability control many different strains able put genie back bottle.

We need recognize threat we're facing actually give respect deserved eradicate it. Hopefully adjusting vaccines accommodate new strains ramp quickly we're make things worse people keep ignoring risk. Betteridge's law headline ends question mark answered word no.

I suppose case answer would ""they're not."" welcome February-May U.S. I'm sitting wondering people us got out. Embarrassing months later people still understand. Nobody right mind supporting endless restrictions keep straw man try make feel better. first Pfizer couple days ago nothing really aches feeling lil weird. Maybe lay smoke time being. got second Moderna dose next week. made sleepy. mild headache next day.

Don’t worried. side effects common, generally mild moderate much preferable compared virus. bed time got headache chills... fine woke up... Really struggling see you, anyone, could read wrote get it.

Sorry job sounds like awful do. depressing disability effects immune system seeing everyone decide now. Everyone gets go back regular life except people like me, stay home forever go die, please ask people wear mask public thousands still dying every day real pandemic. headline uses word ""variants"" though effective one, perhaps even them. stuff get upvoted? get older realize adults grown kids. make much worse decisions kids time hardly hot take, shower thought optics covid, belief covid exactly virus also frequently something benign outwardly visible like turn skin green visually apparent harmless lesions something, entire approach attitude virus would completely different, even pathology otherwise identical. fact disease largely invisible extremely sick it, exposure takes show person, testing still something go way do, stuff affects attitudes disease viewed. that's true diseases guess particularly pronounced one that's pandemic right now. idk late mind recently realize past 2022 endless. prolongs life many 0.5%, even die immediately, lasting health conditions (and lasting financial conditions insane hospital costs).

At moment, affects AZ vaccine. Vaccines reduce incidence symptoms death necessarily spread, people doesn’t mean it’s necessarily safe everyone since herd immunity still long ways off. first dose Dec 22 sore arm. 2nd dose Jan 20, fine overnight, next day really really tired. it.

Yes terrible, going look? No, also fascinating. super helpful comment tho, awesome contribution! point there's dozens studies showing wearing masks prevents spread virus.

And

““One thing learned pandemic teaching learning different, fully used think `normal’ ever again,” read January agenda item Board Education.”

Terrifying There's difference CASE fatality rate INFECTION fatality rate. every infection becomes case 3-5x infections article draws conclusion *infection* fatality rate 0.23%. symptoms? I'm glad vector vaccines coming online well - given nature data Brazil, I'm getting increasingly doubtful SinoVac's inactivated virus vaccine would offer durable protection variants.

I'd still *rather* get BioNTech/Fosun Pharmaceutical mRNA vaccine given choice, apparently approved Hong Kong far. cares *Banning* masks? Even anti-maskers USA don’t want make *illegal* wear masks. actual fuck  Exactly! mean I’m smart hardworking student, definitely don’t feel like earned 4.0 last quarter. felt like I’d learned almost nothing. Nobody stopping going?

Plenty lines inside inside portions though I'm referring to. Thanks! forget take account things people gathering celebration for, like super bowl passed. valentines day right around corner. Even without vaccine young people incentivised personal risk Well would help reports ""long covid"" included numbers often happens prevalent is. Usually one two anecdotes one doctor. Since 75 million people recovered Covid worldwide seems like enough people run actual study. Everyone knows exists. one cares it’s worth justifying whatever extreme lockdown measures people think reasonable death rate nowhere near 2%. Besides select geographies local politicians forced elderly covid back nursing homes, lot overloaded hospitals. fact, many healthcare workers lost jobs due lack patients. Stop disaster porn. Take look many people believe evolution USA. lung scans bad worse smoker's lungs, indication permanent can't reversed. lung scans seen influenza Come guys. Debating restrictions views post guy’s death straight rude inappropriate. massive protests various sporting parades outside country there’s literally evidence case spikes it. 

Can please stop absurdity big deal outside? think parents stupid. can't fix psychology.

I think Russians Cold War first document repeat lie enough human brain eventually accepts true even knows lie.

The problem rhetoric like saw certain people America *very* careful even mention twofold. First halo authority. President supposed trusted authority. President makes fun guidelines around, say, masks suggests completely untested cures claims added weight position. coming someone trusted. makes lie much effective.

Our huge challenge going forward put lid rhetoric like dangerous outcomes we're seeing affects country literally leading unnecessary deaths. Conspiracy theories hyper-partisan news entertainment beholden facts needs eliminated matter untrustworthy narrator *is*, given platform anyone real damage words.

#this purely political post, psychology lies become truth. interesting 6%...few days ago Slovakia tested possitive tests british variant results 70% nothing magical number waves

Sure, let dream another wave. comes, wake up. also think alter existing vaccines needed, super worried dream getting disturbed. 95% interval. median values much line seroprevalence surveys. Open thing posts read comments leaves. Maybe pro covid wrong way say it. Pro new normal forever. anti vaccine? Take pick Ohhhhh.... Thoughts prayers? Would like grab beer bar.

Or failing that, dinner lasts later 10pm. unions strongest cities. Chicago, NYC, LA, SF, Detroit, Washington, D.C.,...etc. Yes, there’s huge difference h1n1 flus 1920s treat today vaccines. 

it sucks piss poor job think doesn’t bode well future new virus outbreaks, there’s reason assume covid bad future age. Vaccines amazing. understand anecdotes understand handful data points, fact remains chance death 1 1000 age 55 despite them. Telling someone ""insensitive fears"", showing facts, decide scared light facts that's right. course, side story important well think important say ""hey listen got 1 1000 chance death personal experiences, make will"". things true, coexist, I'm wrong neither you.

I'd argue telling someone afraid based personal experiences insensitive approach. get it, suffered tremendously this, negative experiences norm would disingenuous try get people act though are. considered light information available. got there...people even now. can't tell many times remind people keep im qork. need go CNN, look subreddit. many California.

Principles panic. understand possibility happened, people just, general, believe likely... yet seems like almost every positive news title immediately followed ""BUT ANOTHER SURGE COMING"". BS. 

With number people getting vaccinated growing huge number people already virus, another surge seems unlikely. even happen, vulnerable population protected. So, another surge cases may somehow happen high levels hospitalization fatal cases- goal begin with? lol Yeah guy street people packed garage watching game big screen.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess things back normal /s 16+ population US 230m, 300+. Plenty people won’t accept vaccination conditions. Glad hear :) think use big difference asthma triggered beta 2 receptors systemic infection caused virus. Ayy, glad decided join Novavax trial then. Anything help get approved faster. Strange, comes hair 2 weeks since got administration takes seriously...

My company year-end kickoff started memoriam dozens people died COVID-19. heartbreaking number young people, late 30's 40's. There’s reason assume safety-tested vaccines severe side effects pop year later. however many reasons fear infected Covid. dentists navigate around teeth tongue get tiny needle specific nerve I’m confident also hit upper arm bigger needle. there's reason there's cure polio Yes, also get higher titres bacteria CHO. still method purify scale developed there’s practical way produce them. way people would allowed 450,000 children’s deaths. ""To clear: fact coronavirus much less likely spread surfaces mean impossible get coronavirus touching things.""

From article. get saying - comment example; I'm well aware COVID affects elderly. least they’ll killing taking rest us (except can’t vaccinated, awful sad, they’ll least less risk).

Unprecedented. one could predicted it. many assumptions here... variants contagious, yet widespread be, vaccinations less effective it, surge happen enough vaccinations...

What say variant already widespread? Maybe cause surge cases certain areas? Maybe vaccines and/or immunity least adequately effective it? surge start happen month two point vaccinations widespread?

It speculation guessing people trying spin negative story. I'm dumb one foresee realistic scenario okay pack thousands people standing room concert wear masks, don't? sort health insurance have? maximum pocket expense? Anything purchased health care marketplace maximum pocket expense.

My sister go chemo 2 years ago. stay hospital month 3 additional months patient care (she'd go 3x week chemo). total costs insurance 180k.

BUT pocket individual maximum $7500. paid...$7500. $172.5k paid insurance. Update - parents shots arms! Thanks advice! That’s Russia frozen wasteland nobody wants live in. habitable parts Russia East west coasts.  BR variant similar South African one probably similar results, confirmed scientifically yet. need be. get invitation. emergency use anyway. Double Exactly. variant especially worried SA since affects vaccines. Last heard (about 2 weeks ago), start testing 12+ year olds. even mention testing would start younger kids. unfortunately, rubber stamp likely happen toddlers least another year. fair, makes sense given low probabilities young ones get super sick, give peace mind boy asthma. include B117 variant? beggars can't choosers. willing wait another year 2 taking exposure risk period get ""best"" vaccine fine. take 10% chance lose 60% future boost least i'm protected worry 60% later probably compatible vaccine coming deal issues. posted archive link like always do. problem get lost comments healthy strong Glorious Russia. know mean, would especially cool dentists could give shots alongside dental appointments. would wager fair amount people putting getting dental checkups dental work unless really need it, could give vaccine checkup think would alleviate lot stress lot people. Yeah I'm here! I'll passing J&amp;J vaccine want risk long covid many people want dismiss. said, could get mRNA vaccine later I'd take now. likely let happen though. going DPA vaccine, it'd probably make sense Novavax cause simplest produce (classic vaccine made conventional tech) _and_ best efficacy results far. Hey now, terrible flu season. Like dozen people got it.

It’s like flu numbers showing around 2 percent normal levels countries 2 friends died shit

and still screaming things get back normal now? second shot 2 weeks

Nevermind, explained.  Clickbait title - TL;DR ""variants bad know happen"". article four pages already know. S20 Note Ultra :( Yeah, vaccines pretty much available anyone, hospitals overrun, deaths issue, restrictions got go. 

That could happen summer, idiots saying endless restrictions vaccine Fall/Winter 21-22, etc. get everyone nerves. forgot dreams! weird. mean don’t want take MRNA vaccine, doesn’t J&amp;J use traditional technology well? Moderna Pfizer already said shots still effective variants. type immunity common type virus onus disprove rather prove it. many people quit caring move lives. Unless next strain Captain Trips, social end coming progress front? Haven’t heard much. People support ""endless restrictions"" essentially nobody vaccines proven, worth discussing further. kinda reassuring says true. Honestly, read sub, expecting least 90% chance ugly scenario happen, would mean herd immunity reached many years- even decades. Though imagine anxiety pushes imagine worst scenario.

We need hope best outcome work towards it, time prepared accept ugly one that's happen. Good luck, everyone! Hang there, kind tougher times! side effects first dose Moderna. Crossing fingers milder one 2nd dose couple days. EU buy 6 different companies including different technologies bought enough vaccinate whole population original deals even Sanofis failure AZ problems.

Even without AZ EU would get enough vaccinate citizens year. additional doses essentially new back case even problems arise. reason EU looking Sputnik V.

The original 2020 purchases would doses Janssen vaccine would also deliver additionally Sanofi AZ. Maybe billionaires got tax breaks Ha, it’s bad. annoying. Flu-like stuff, aches, sore joints, sweaty sleep, really tired. Onset 6 hours shot. ramped worst probably 12 - 18 hours gone 30 total hours. 1st dose sore arm nothing else. really seems hit miss. You’ll great. actually know several people. I've personally told people lost business laid ""get another job"" stop worrying. even called lazy. know anyone who's voiced opinion mean people exist.  Yeah hopefully would great normal summer! someone young risk would much prefer take traditional vaccine, must take vaccine. careful, 100% Pfizer Moderna testing South Africa strain became dominant. would shocked still 100%. Better pray stays mostly effective. J&amp;J say 100% hospitalizations death. still severe symptoms hospitalized. Yeah, American Airlines flights March opposite response, American cut flights destination, plane 100% full. Thanks American! Hasn’t Israel innoculated almost half population already? long take Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna? 99% us left :( remember reading studies inhalers like April maybe may. sure nothing came seemed work. people antibodies sick? safe? call pro-life would western world taken seriously assured human human transmission?

H2H well-known mid-Jan well first reported case USA: H2H transmission, fake news ignorance also suffers H2H transmission. Excellent news, I'm honestly mentally prepared opposite. Hope effective variants too. mid September would say Ontario least well covid - think got cases double digits day, things didn’t feel control. obviously schools opened back things went shit are, Ontario vaccinating less 10,000 people per day. 

Things definitely pick point, I’m still faintly hopeful semi-normal summer. it’s gonna telling see improve vaccination rates drastically upcoming weeks. source something like 80-95% cases SA SA variant. Totally agree. Confusing low risk risk deadly virus wise game. Hand hygiene crucial sorts sicknesses. Covid mostly air, absolutely infect touching infected surface touching nose/eyes etc. kind weird people act like possible now. breaks heart people gotten sick? seems like weird sentiment. Nobody supports ENDLESS restrictions, virus still large. made .5 percent mortalitiy rate pandemic puts huge strain medical apparatus. Dude, get head ass. Australia police state. People caring others society Marshall law. Socially distancing wearing masks police state. friend Australia living took seriously ended whole half measure we’re wasted killed 400k+ people like whose precious freedom get haircut important saving people’s grandmas. hope enjoyed meals Chili’s, worth it? vaccine supply increases dramatically, maybe. Otherwise far priority list May. Young, healthy people end line antsy go back normal even get vaccinated, especially message ""we've got old people, deaths down, pandemic over."" could see large wave infections among group even result many deaths. CDC reports 2 million Covid vaccines day right increase. looking entire US population vaccinated least first shot next months. Covid absolutely worse Flu flu still killed 2k month 2018. point Covid treated flu? 

I'm saying thousands die month flu season everything open normal, Covid better numbers months anything closed? outside protesting things shut Flu? figure, anxiety isn’t rational, sadly AZ's vaccine bad variant, others took moderate efficacy hit? Imagine realizing little ask people large gatherings Christmas. Christmas different still Christmas. talked everyone met still got see video chat. okay knew would see soon. don’t think postpone Christmas. People postponed gathering. 

Delayed gratification something completely missing society it’s evident everywhere extremely evident people seeing obvious benefits large gatherings. Nah I’m you. I’m really afraid much I’m peace idea death personally haven’t concerned all. respect choice. However, CDC, state local governments allow indoor dining certain parameters, I'm going trust experts say. risk indoor dining? course not. However, stepping house involves measure risk. can't remember saw it, video report showed virus stay air someone walking street. particles stay air reach someone walking behind distance greater six-feet rule. Unfortunately, there's risk walking street.Like you, talk 100 people day, I'm fine well. So, think mandates governments working. formally “the rules” doesn’t mean anybody following them. nothing stop dating. Many people right Quebec dating, assure you. Lmao first world hording. Like every country except US UK 1%-2%. 2 countries make first world. Russia vacine, China etc. comment screams white guilt. don’t get things you’re stupid learn. walk among hopeless, truly. people selfish, pathetic Varies person person. Plan day feeling achy headache + chills hope best. reaction mild (headache ~3 hours) coworkers felt lot worse took day feeling back 100% Imagine stupid responsible lax Covid approach resulting deaths. really understand could fucking stupid. *smh*

Could please outline position responsibilities Anders Tegnell, Folkhälsomydigheten comes decision?

Could explain assertion Anders Tegnell one handed controlling response policies Sweden's covid strategies?

And could show total yearly death Sweden last 30 years normalised population growth?

Also please explain death U.K., Belgium, Italy, rest Europe correlation lockdown? People support seemingly endless restrictions (past summer, 2022, even beyond) need ask this:

Is worth dramatically lower nearly everybody’s quality life means prolonging life less 0.5% population years? need cut storage temperature half too! Kill grandma you’re it. got week ago. pretty lousy 24 hours. 8-10 hours shot chills aches night really weird dreams. woke feeling like really bad hangover. throughout day got gradually better bit tired days. It’s fun get better quick. promise it’s worth it! Oh damn. experience mentioned couple years ago (I'm 40's). waited long first experience, like 20 (also 90's), top bottom right side teeth getting removed pleasant. eventually get side done lower wisdom tooth left side sideways, gum, pushing teeth together causing decay teeth.

I also ended dry socket. kidney stone removal surgery year prior, know worse. I'd put wisdom teeth (as well adding one implant) worse. Ugh. dentist wonders never want go back even cleaning. think actually PTSD that, lol. significant effect super bowl, valentine's day? earth would people closer strangers? desperate doomerism point.  regards, naysayers fussing 70%, probably got less 50% science math. second dose usually worse people? first dose bad.  Yes, testosterone suppresses immune system slightly women’s immune systems high endurance helps die less often also complications. drug needs better name. hope effective larger scale trials 🤞🤞🤞 second. Great news. still waiting hear deemed effective toddlers. feel like 2 half weeks reasonable, I’d rather see right start distributing March, rush February release. Would interesting target regions higher vaccination mutations. thing since 80s US.

Vaccines capitalist North Korea. amount regulations industry, rules, laws dwarfed things like nuclear industry. 

Considering vaccines need meet QA/QC western nations, tends mean highest standard becomes standard. That’s nature vaccines west. Hasn’t always case, it’s universal. anyone west, it’s safe things get.

Keep mind efficiencies led gain stuff like moving material x new location saving 4 hours per batch. Hiring additional staff saving 3 hours batch. Installing faster fill machines saving 36 hours. Small steps gets batch 500 hours 250 doubles production. Nothing fundamentally changed.

You don’t get worried damaging floors switch tooth brush mop, get cleaner floor faster. glad general anesthesia wisdom teeth removed... That's true, enough evidence yet, said still true. reason ""paused"" rollout [disappointing early Pfizer Moderna said preliminary laboratory studies indicate vaccines, still protective, less effective B.1.351. Novavax Johnson &amp; Johnson also sequenced test samples clinical trial participants South Africa, B.1.351 caused vast majority cases, reported lower efficacy United AstraZeneca-Oxford trial South Africa, roughly 2,000 participants given either two doses vaccine placebo virtually difference numbers people vaccine placebo groups infected B.1.351, suggesting vaccine little protect new variant. 

By accounts early numbers, existing vaccines less effective dealing South Africa strain. saying people going driven ignorance pointing towards covid deniers gaslighting. got second dose Moderna, terrified horror stories. got overnight chills regular sore arm. first dose lot worse - chills, fatigue, body aches, arm paralyzed pain 2-3 days. varies much person person. Hopefully won’t bad! small subset people become unhinged end pandemic around corner. want continue. Please report rule-breaking comments. looking them. get bronchitis get sick. many kinds gave wasn’t sick yet. recommendations? agree, think there’s good chance get there. mean, though, don’t discuss possibility variants screwing things up/aren’t skeptical pharma companies/can’t critique new administration idiocy like leaving intl travel open variants spreading, stuff like that. Somehow concepts vanished sub get downvoted hell. First doses started 1-2 weeks ago states. Mostly recent advancement considering vaccines approved around 2 months ago. shits creek without paddle making reaction comment regarding Novavax vaccine. fully agree you. vet it, give dogs shot without even noticing good response period average deaths per population. reason think good comparing USA lots deaths. Vaccines huge bummer seriousness I'm hearing might another year till age group gets vaccinated that's governments offical time line. One good thing USA producing fast done hopefully get vaccines hopefully vaccines get approved. Documentation eats care time. point tech take care it. Same. I’m nurse so. Bc white male privilege. Duh. virus knows Lol, going say thing. mother law got covid recovered fine, afterwards wouldnt shut every little thing months after, like ptsd. Nothing physicslly wrong her, mental.. Illinois school district vaccinating teachers school. New York might same? ...those spikes hit...are living fucking rock watching Fox News? well stated. People seek illusion control, impulse moralize runs deep. It’s Florida, it’s do. hell would disclose Reddit account employer? Especially one spend signifiant amount time baselessly insulting others....

Because requirement. nothing said needed nice since two developers seem want dump Pfizer Moderna, one mentioned Novavax, I’d say it’s reasonable perhaps work them. could comment want, since trial data Novavax public

You mentioned basically every major manufacturer post responded to... Yes overall numbers remaining steady community spread still high. point vaccinating vulnerable population enough call day restrictions masks. need vaccinate significant portion non vulnerable population get rid mask mandates. think restrictions loosened see drop deaths/hospitalizations masks last go see sustained low level cases. I’m sayin 1 10,000 current level still high many states. goes drastically stays talk getting rid masks public settings. Visit linked subreddit risk. may high amount misinformation.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Hahahaha even r/coronavirus automod thinks r/coronavirusUS sub doomery. love it.  America bad! Health care workers absolutely heck driving cases up. risk, go home nuclear families, potentially spread others.... Delta least still trying... airlines gave months ago. Yep, site confirmed blinded crossover second visit today. Everyone participating receive vaccine. first link: doctors told family suspected previously undetected case Guillain-Barré syndrome

LMAO, even gonna bother rest. even best article muster squat.

Also: doctor said one-in-a-million case — they’d never seen something progress way did. Doubt it, look inventor PCR test said way Fauci using (long current situation), think really throws question many asymptomatic cases actually infected.

It means present body. Huh. That's pretty dumb get banned that. CDC last updated estimates 1/15/21 indicates range 71,639,264 – 
97,219,850 . CDC website. let know possible.


Respiratory droplets also land surfaces objects. possible person could get COVID-19 touching surface object virus touching mouth, nose, eyes. ""Think children!!!"" know ten people Covid never tested person family tested pointless waste co-pay go couldn’t smell taste. sure case nationwide. exactly it. ton people antivaxxers, kind meh getting it. go way it. think surprise people soon come US. Expect April/May time frame supply outstrip demand. Or, y’know, people don’t want risk even minuscule chance transmission complaining moving way fuckin weird.

They’re prioritizing safety. New York lists people chronic lung diseases one new eligible populations. 

i would ask healthcare provider No, you’re realistic, vaccines end game everyone.

Once everyone chance get vaccine kick restrictions go necessity draconian overreach. Even second long restrictions utterly unacceptable second masks aren’t necessary make sure COVID doesn’t overrun hospitals fuck right Let's postpone christmas next year. world live people OK that? well....there go weekend plans. I'm group 3 I'm 64 (in excellent health, knock wood). intend get vaccine if/when offered spend little time thinking it. I'm much concerned getting back normal living. I've got plans! didn’t say did, hence multiple disclaimers made. direct evidence wrong, ""In placebo group trial Novavax’s vaccine, people prior coronavirus infections appeared likely get sick people without them, meaning weren’t fully protected B.1.351 variant swiftly become dominant South Africa."" varient spreading usa weeks FYI; phase III Moderna trial (which still ongoing), last clinical visit Doctor talked entering booster trial. start date ,but already lining existing trial participants enter booster trial. Yep. Notice every single weekend, deaths new cases plummet. TRUST ME, nobody goes ER super bowl. Lmao even hold Super Bowl first place then? I’m using fluticasone  cares. Theme parks trash people. *NOT JAW, DR. KESHEN!*  I'm gonna leave here. things worse death. WEAR MASK RICHARD. 20 percent COVID-19 patients found blood clots veins, among patients intensive care unit, statistic increased 31 percent. Blood clots vein, deep vein thrombosis, reach lungs develop pulmonary embolism, resulting higher risk death.  focusing death (because apparently 300,000+ americans previous conditions? guess lives matter huh?) start focusing long term effects. People disabled covid. People welfare long due covid. People medicare of... COVID. almost like huge amount people get sick relatively preventable disease negative effect stuff. 

In short, SHUT FUCK UP. important note: literally subgroup people majority die. even close. matter fact, mass testing studies showed something like friggin’ 1/3 cases asymptomatic.  yes, call circle-jerk. would call people coming senses realizing virus virus, variant variant, vaccine vaccine, can't continue live way. ""selfish"" want live rather merely exist, I'm going selfish.  one argued ✌️ They’ll fine. know I’m nervous mom empirical evidence shows vaccines incredibly safe symptoms mild. I’ve practicing whole fckin life proof that. simply data say one way other. every state except Alabama reached 10 doses administered per 100 people. 49 50 44 50 Friday evening

roll tide ventilators still used? know treatment constantly progressing, place more? There's shortage now, correct? Don’t be. I’ve known 6 people gotten 5 including basically symptoms except really sore arm better two days getting vaccine. One friend covid previously mild fever body aches two days. makes feel better 9 percent people reported symptoms common pain 70 percent , fatigue/headaches around 20 percent, fever/chills around 10 percent. aren’t exact numbers around right. people taken vaccine don’t report symptoms. Worst case you’ll feel like crap 24-48 hours better Monday that’s norm God I'm tired hearing low IQ people subreddit claim something anecdotal fit narrative. remind idiots facebook told last January posted video Wuhan ""that's place China never heard it'll never here"" except EVEN dumber time variant Manaus detected across America, atleast back covid19 America yet. dumb people died, million calm. saying work school equals...that’s got diagnosed 6 years (5 years ago). people improve need treatment while, course, we're still learning lot long-haul covid. story struck SUPER familiar mine, wanted reach out. 

That said, treatments, symptom management thing. I'm stimulants brain fog (also diagnosed adhd, knows one really there's difference all). help significantly fatigue, too. constant exhaustion since starting them. I'm also beta blockers keep hr down/stable. helps palpitations (weird feeling beats), too. try eat lot salt (to keep blood pressure up), sometimes take salt tablets.

For me, gets 80% normal. there, really ""lifestyle changes"", used get mad saw. blaming lifestyle. listening body keeps feeling best. That's unique person. me, I'm worse morning, morning routine non-existent. get get office/recliner asap. shower evenings stool case get dizzy (I need less less time). feel much better put feet up, sit way whenever can. there, eating enough drinking enough water, getting enough rest. together gets like 95% feeling normal. can't everything used pay attention body stuff, life pretty normal. Sounds right. said many(like me) it, survived, still follow social norms wearing mask such. biggest difference personally don’t anxiety COVID. 

For it’s worth, still plan get shot soon it’s available me. overall situation US paying four times per vaccine. That’s bottom line cost. take preventative asthma medication? so, keep taking regular interval. studies noting Budesonide usage decreases recovery time reduce hospitalization drastically. truly think case you’re insane. I’m vaccinated it’s taken enough time kick I’m going back normal Lol opinion agree ""Trump"". Absolute baby brain. 👶🧠 

Isn't one end February?  Go go go! Can’t wait available everywhere. makes feel better, 21st Columbus day weekend, friends gone home. found one kind-of friend hasn't, single 4-loko pregame, went club downtown, got turned away wearing sneakers, went home ordered pizza. 2016. Oh bro it’s PLAN. Calm clear-cut all. large % people given area received Oxford vaccine, creating massive evolutionary pressure South African variant grow there. turn exposes rest world significantly greater amount SA variant, leads reinfections infections people received vaccines (as well increasing odds additional mutations could accrue.) 

There's not-unreasonable argument saying outcome could worse simply chucking trash. 

Of course could mitigate mixing (on geographic basis) Oxford vaccines much possible. I'm literally data scientist lol. list many variables imply contribute significant way end outcome, that's I'm trying say here. Believe want really care, agree disagree. No, ridiculously selfish. Maybe is, going almost entire year! overwhelming majority people, unlike media shows you, following precautions. Please give people break. 

Winter arbitrary date. Cases, hospitalizations, vaccine rates determine return normalcy. lot pent-up angst frustration flowing around undermine logical discussion decision-making.

You mean like ""logical discussion"" lockdowns - is, panicked frenzy, ""cautious"" crowd shouting anyone everyone questioned them? shifting goalposts ""just weeks"" ""until nobody anywhere dies endemic virus?""

You talk ""collective well-being,"" yet restrictions tremendous harm society next benefit. We've ruined millions livelihoods home reversed decades progress lifting global south poverty - what? peoples' lives disrupted year, policies responsible even led better outcomes average places implement them, course people going pissed frustrated. be? Slightly topic... Blackbox warning Singulair scare all? much worth trying convince people. order mask mandates go away majority people think longer necessary. people convince greater chances getting back normalcy. actual studies yet cdc saying bevause study done otherwise.

If case vaccine worthless significant majority population looked requirement. concern ta anywhere. kids going wear masks school permanently? College students? Rightfully Biontech developed vaccine colloquially Pfizer vaccine they're household name US media dominates Canada. really surprising. Capitalism requires rule law protecting property rights.

This political corruption: abusing state resources personal gain wonder site become doomery things gradually return normal. normalcy returns less doomery people stop caring much covid spend time real life things rather posting here. Eventually left people want stay home rest lives. get vaccines. supposed manufacturing doses without knowing vaccine would work, yet vaccines got approved, manufacturers million doses hand. quickly scaled produce tens millions per month (I think moderna + Pfizer like 18 million per week).

So question is, actually making doses prior finding vaccine works PR? were, lot already made? get building facilities modifying hard seem scaling super quick approved. Long term nah wear mask; I'll stick sleeve. 7 years old? Don’t forget Last Ride! Somewhere MJ took personally normally host massive indoor party everyone know

You host party 3 whole people? C: hang friends outdoors masks 15 plus feet apart. wife outdoor dining find restaurant doesn’t poorly ventilated tents. I’m long hauler neuro study NIH. No. Goodbye.   people social contacts already gotten covid. Estimates suggest 100 million people infected. enough major impact rate spread. Won’t happening JnJ 85% effective severe illness. Pfizer/Moderna 100  I’m vaccinated what’s problem? don’t know. theory, formulation identical swap bit expressing via brings mRNA.

Have released genetic sequences vaccines yet? would telling reality, places control spread likely get infected surface, real contact tracing.

There contact tracing world entire pandemic start now. know spreads. surfaces. 

China crazy country lies everything. take face value. chance dying roller coaster covid. interested coaster. That’s why. TIL something new! Thanks :) believe CDC categorizes increased risk, high risk. South Africa

We've heard stuff SA one, hardly anything Brazil on. Really hope end fucking us over. Brazil horrible right now. People saying don’t realize many high risk old people they’re trouble getting it. assumes everyone getting vaccines part high risk group know isn’t case all. logic, people stop wearing masks? opinion, restrictions go away everyone access vaccine. Vets probably good getting clean shot hissing, flailing animals daily... I'd let take shot wrangling stubborn antivaxxers! maybe couple months then? conceivably could go sequencing massive distribution matter 3-4 months? social media accounts disclosed. consider C too. time truly negligent sports :( otherwise always wear mask properly stores, drive thrus, etc. don’t go unnecessary activities. 85% school went back in-person online sake getting quarantined, getting sick, and/or transmitting. look things obvious you’re much responsible party-goers people won’t wear masks nose, lol 2 points:

1 - matter *why* cases falling, are. Meaning resurgence start much lower place, many fewer infected persons. smaller group infected persons fewer fewer targets rapidly approach full vaccination coming months. 

2 - Israel fine, massive drops infections among elderly (who received vaccines)  tried explaining people Reddit last night essentially got downvoted hell. It’s worth trying convince anymore. surprised, six months ago talked leaving house leisure people would send gallows 🤣 Yes. using pump since 12. CGM last 4-5 years. Why?  It’s even impressive consider large chunk day vaccinations aren’t happening. Got mine day ruthlessly efficient site.  Oh yes, people laughed took pandemic seriously. said order masks; thought going shortage. friends said masks useless laughed me. times change. switched sides I’ve risk downplayer ever since. want follow every time something “but I’m vaccinated wore mask.”

Then stop saying it. fear judgment anything. Get used things saying proudly without offering justification. wear mask.

I literally don't. happy continue wearing one now, taking vaccines widely available nothing anyone else it. general public stand continued restrictions everyone vaccinated, reason to. What's point getting vaccinated otherwise?

If scared take mask vaccines widely available, probably never going comfortable taking off. never going reach point covid entirely eliminated, refuse continue living life fear accepting ""new mask law.

These mask ""laws"" already enforced places. summer, become joke nobody going want wear mask getting vaccinated. happily one people. free keep wearing mask, gonna hard ""no"" everyone access vaccines. let fear dictate life main risk passed. mean, continue Pfizer Moderna current rate + J &amp; J expected rate, we'll still done 2022. I’m extremely skeptical “reporting asking one random doctor” stories. That’s good science works.

I’m saying covid good lungs, that’s reliable way collect data I've called beginning, everyone else trying explain you. 

If another factor causes increase cases herd immunity found. even partially. That's like saying, ""Oh, 1 person got infected recovered...we've got partial herd immunity already!"" make difference. Especially factors impact case load much immunity factor. Keep folks. great see positive news US.

The challenge slip backwards many countries have, vaccines there's every chance good trend.

A happy day, say humanity, boarders, race politics What's b117 area.... think legit argument start massive full city lockdowns akin China did. I'm suggesting I'd want bc inherently un-American, contained early draconian measures hundreds thousands lives could saved. You’re fool reality, places control spread likely get infected surface, real contact tracing. near identical article wapo topic. Apparently cutting edge come year airborne viral pandemic say much money spend sanitation. Yeah, know. mean hand hygiene necessary, risk infection surfaces, people WFH wash hands 9 times day excessive. 

Consider this, China banned throw mass quantities food tested positive covid. Why? surface transmission least plausible according CDC/WHO, food transmission not. China this? Hmmm. coronavirus anymore? Hmmm sounds like could explanation what’s going on. looks like there’s treatment either? accurate diagnosis cool I’m really trying find form treatment. get diagnosed treated it? Really ? ate KFC entered India ? next thailand free cases drink sewer foreigners drink water parcel flying pony ? maybe California actually release vaccines healthcare sites pharmacies instead trying convince people work parking lot. 

Sure! much crow want eat? choose willfully think part problem honestly fact bunch ""early qualifiers"" want quote unquote guinea pigs got first. They're willing get now, month ago they're basically told ""You chance, try hard everyone else."" lot people wait months getting now. find happens. I'm saying April guaranteed, think certainly likely. expect wait fall summer though. Wait, telling place like handful people 7 years fascinated virus? must've sitting around like, ""Gee, sure seems like contagious virus. would suck spread across world turned pandemic!"" xD  Never heard it. saw healthcare workers UK, US marines, Qatar. rate 5-20% naive individuals, higher rate asymptomatic.

Is high low? know Ya, talk dirty me. Really exciting stuff!!!!! You’re fine. Outside transmission rare Hey that’s birthday. Better American plane today packed 150 person plane could ask family members gotten vaccine managed get it. Maybe family member trying get vaccine could something similar. “It’s grim projection, unfortunately,” said Ali Mokdad, professor [**Institute Health Metrics **(IHME**) . . . 

No need read more. CDCs guidance mess, essentially admitting vaccinating age would faster effective terms death recommending states vaccinate occupations pre-existing conditions reasons equity. Essentially, regular old person pre-existing conditions would prioritized ahead 1/3 vaccinatable population. 

Minnesota NY making mistake- eligible population large relative available doses lots eligible people trouble getting shot. guidelines restrictive less people told get frustrated/disappointed. NY, credit, lottery like MN is. South African strain looks like might turn completely resistant vaccines. so, never ending. Even Moderna stored fridge temps 30 days need. simply can't afford vaccinate whole population big despite

If see dumb .

So India gifting away millions vaccines free cannot afford ? 

Being rich china requirement bench mark .


All see butt hurt person enjoys poverty porn getting there. Massachusetts used really far behind slightly behind now. going right direction, guess UK trained volunteers work larger vaccination centres, mostly experienced first aiders (St John Ambulance) recruitment website implied necessarily need experience. centres experienced medical professionals deal incidents questions course. That’s Moderna study. guess pulled everything ass huh?

Now go one step read Moderna 119 day antibody duration study see 6.4 fold reduction ends time older populations compared convalescent patients...

As work particular company specifically vaccine infection/reinfection, cannot comment publicly rest post. really wish could... sure getting info, [this recent 95% subjects retained immune memory ~6 months infection. came read Texas Republican wear masks take pandemic seriously...  would make death rate roughly 0.36% That’s one point one seems really making. vaccines 100% effective severe illness. people don’t get sick anymore, isn’t pandemic anymore. don’t need 100% getting, need 100% wont get ill. really comes simple things. we're together facing unprecedented pandemic, wear mask. standard social distancing help Fauci experts avoid worst super-spreader events. like people complaining lockdown last spring half-assed. closed everything essential businesses. want? Armed men guarding every home making sure didnt open door? wearing mask causing people depression like one user said need get help piece cloth bother much. Either way us, enforce rule gonna follow it. hang ceiling, cry, throw fit, masks still enforced wearing one. three groups people: 

1. want vaccine go way get it.
2. want vaccine go way avoid getting it.
3. care much, would accept vaccine offered it, would exert much effort get vaccine themselves. 

We hear groups 1 2, suspect group 3 constitutes pretty large portion population. 

It quite likely number people group 1 less 100 million. so, April anyone actively seeking vaccine able get one. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

There's point using whether backup plan not. know even ideal time table we’re still looking towards end may beginning June everyone access vaccine takes month half first dose full efficacy. That’s think masks public spaces June fairly reasonable protect workers. cases/deaths/hospitalizations absolutely plummet I’m open lifting sooner. anyone says look much they’re plummeting can’t assume continue go current rate indefinitely.

Surprise surprise. 🙄 thinking vets too. ninja shot dog running laps around room without even noticing, I'm sure manage shot stationary human. part story, important deny/downplay Covid playing role there's underlying vulnerability, perceived 'well' ""he Covid."" 

No one outlier, much part whole system. comes another fortune teller western exceptionalism . weird theories. Apparently 600 million infected India dead bodies . everyone hiding. First western supremacists accuse government people. . 

Why better us everything ? 

Only usa tracking everything . India reporting higher numbers tha usa India track , numbers lower nobody tracking ? convenient You’d think veterinarians would qualify, too. I’d honestly think would grossly overqualified that. point exclaiming would live utopian society man perfect nature? Duh. what? Man doesn’t consequently don’t. It’s obvious pointless can’t imagine people keep bringing up. we've moved calling partial immunity?

I've called beginning, everyone else trying explain you.  Like said several posts ago, nobody claiming we've reached full herd immunity.  benefitted vaccines partial infection-based immunity, continue so.  words, fewer infected dead people today vaccines partial immunity growing population. facetious gets me. 

It's literally arguing.  evidence? Everything good hearsay (it may reduce hospitalization death), people died receiving vaccine. I'm anti-vaxxer, I'm cautious care health, sake family.
What know least risk contracting virus leave house take every precaution recommended CDC out. I'd rather get false confidence go receiving 5% failure rate worse. nothing, making educated choice observe. Yes u decide everything. wear mask. what? Big deal. Nobody cowering fear. Wearing mask law. personally wanna wear one mean anything. Efficacy AZ vaccine drops considerably 55. Italy’s regulator approved vaccine people 55 55 use alternative vaccine. also true Germany, France, Switzerland. Pfizer Moderna increasing production, vaccines going get approved soon: J&amp;J couple weeks, Astrazeneca Novavax later. give us enough well 2 million vaccinations per day.

Note necessary everyone get vaccine get back normal. vulnerable 20% population (mostly elderly) vaccinated, hospitalization death rates fall dramatically. 

Also 1/3 population already infected, herd immunity yet help slow spread, especially combination vaccines. mean 'underestimating'?

There several studies COVID reinfection. People infected 5-20% chance getting reinfected exposes. pretty well established now. source spread NFL games? depends definition ""soon"" is. mean right instant, no. mean start next month assuming continue decrease rate are, agree. Who?! recognize drops it’s far likely due seasonality vaccines. mean point you’re looking like 2-3 percent second dose 10 first dose. doesn’t explain drop we’re seeing far likely due less gatherings, less people going out, seasonal drop. suspect point we’ll see number stabilize continues drop stays low I’ll happy admit I’m wrong. I’m saying we’re bad direction. think news mostly positive we’re pace good summer/fall. think people need honest delays distribution actual immunity. think people like Fauci pessimistic estimates herd immunity they’re grappling things sub largely ignoring. Israel almost 60 percent first dose end still haven’t seen major drops cases deaths. delay first dose real world effects. optimistic think many people convincing certain timetables based logic empirical evidence desire done masks/restrictions. liberal virus conspiracy overthrow government better start working faster this. Trump's bound take office day now. Yeah, except literally isn’t going happen, lmao. nerds cower fear basement long want, things going back normal year whether like not. covid schools least worries. suppose planning good though. fire evacuation routes never hope use Look Japan Olympics, it’s expensive, long term effort really challenging pull off. city Tampa already spent millions time named. Mayor Castor elected 2019, vote move LA Tampa 2017. 

There’s lot places would choose host large scale event right now, Tampa locked partially economics. Combine state restricting ability put mandates place curb bars, nightclubs, et al, get this. Blaming Mayor insane (I know you’re not, adding point) best news I've heard since release vaccine Yeah amazing. I'm beginning believe reddit site lot Trump-ish imagined. 

We going wearing masks lot longer summer like not. Maybe Florida lol.

I've downvoted much doubt I'll able post much quick fire. Good luck trying talk sense people! economy simply important lives could lost. Nah, podiatry set schools. usually easier get podiatry school medical school US. Orthopedic surgery operates everything including hips, back, feet specialty MD/DO school. Ah dang la area aren’t wait spring. It’ll skyrocket again. mean, kind get it. anything nice say either them, think could ""be civil"" (Rule 1) tried. Lol. don’t appreciate calling simple-minded.

ASTRAZENECA

Not quite effective variants he—

ASTRAZENECA Thrombocytopenia caused lot different things happen spontaneously. vaccines certainly cases thrombocytopenia adverse effect. Even common antibiotics cause this. antitrypsin (AAT). AAT deficiency

Presuming indeed medical reason. article says Europeans risk, Asians less risk. say anything Africans ? Given higher African-minority death rates USA/Europe, would corroborating evidence African's worse AAT deficiency. Lmao. “Planes bad make global heating” funniest dumbest way saying that. Wow remember got shit wanting go drive once. Apparently people telling went drive, might get crash strain healthcare system. gas up, touch handle virus give someone.

Some thoughts people way extreme. 😢 received doses. patients ask did, say, ""Heck yeah did. I've got many pre-existing conditions risk contacting virus."" Duhh completely ignoring vaccination effort. Social distancing mask mandates exist everyone chance get vaccinated Oh “high quality information” decide is? Ha. Nope. corticosteroid inhaler (Pulmicort) Umhmmm keep eating sweet apple pie fed, smell someone lets drop rows away I'm trusting magic filters move air flow differently virus particles rather smelly particles it. Pharmacy student here. Think like this. First dose's purpose help body create antibodies fight covid. Like train bunch cells become big buff bois hunt spike protein (which found covid cells). second dose basically reintroducing spike protein again, got big buff bois fight off. typically expect see definite reaction second dose  know age group largest decline? surge started mid-December result Thanksgiving. live L.A. got SLAMMED. Ambulances queued 8+ hours unload patients. National Guard sent help hospitals. Morgues overflowing funeral homes overwhelmed. Patients treated parking lots. Christmas, people getting scared least stayed home. hit 20,000 cases day L.A. County. 

Here's snapshot worst days lot people still dumb now, saw kid's birthday party baby shower set driveways weekend people could stop drop gifts say hi. people wearing masks though try get away keeping down. think enough people know someone died seriously ill take seriously now.

As far opening - retail never shut down. Malls packed holidays one enforcing capacity limits. fact, one store wait line get - since last March. Funny, every time we've started see improvements, people stop taking proper precautions go right back up. testing regardless symptoms contact teaching much possible. Yea that's I'm after, I'm curious relationship infected immunity simply carrying immunity?

Like would possible people testing positive second time this? Thank you. I'm convinced loose (or least incomplete) understanding COVID spread general (internationally, nationally, regionally). understand less think; mainly believe able track behaviors billions people once. make inferences virus good going flow. BS headline BS.

First all, virus end vaccinations pick pace, already beginning occur.

But secondly, even end sight virus itself, distancing sure hell end soon. People 2+ years hermit lifestyle. People getting antsy watching case rates go either desperate get see friends loved ones panicking thinking somehow something still go wrong we'll continue stuck lockdown. 

I sub I've reading threads day reason.  articles implies current variants interest study test B.1.351/501Y.V2 South African variant? That's real concern far evading current vaccines. suspect works corticosteroids weaken immune system overaggressive immune system lands people hospital. downside weakened immune system also makes susceptible types infections.  

In case may mean much likely catch coronavirus. needing hospitalization great, given we're seeing people ""mild"" cases showing damaged organs long term problems might bit double edged sword give corticosteroids people need keep asthma controlled. Why? Meanwhile, grocery store would rather carry gun shop rather reusable shopping bag. Shame exclusive US. Fuck got first dose tonight 😭😭 technology newer? That's disingenuous. person caught polio America 40 years. know effects mRNA vaccine 5 years, 10 years, etc. road certain?  says “up couple years”, way different. Thanks giving real info russia isn’t communist country anymore dumbass never said Singapore sucked. said authoritarian melting pot melt-y America's. although secondhand knowledge Singapore, stand that.

Singapore rich microstate extent quality life better large nations significant chunks impoverished areas, yes. never said otherwise.

When evolution ever random? [this Phoenix municipal stadium! February spots full plenty week ago don’t think get snapped crazy fast-site says updating March openings sometime mid-February keep checking back! disappeared. thoughts South African variant becoming resistant AstraZeneca Vaccine: 

At least UK, may face lockdowns: think chance additional variants become resistant vaccines extend restrictions indefinitely? Probably basing fact one South african study hospitalised though representative sample. young healthy. really need studies regarding AZ thr South african variant. nothing suggests right prevent severe symptoms either. 

Although UK EU Sourh african variant still appears small numbers AZ atleast still help get current dominant variant control Yeah that’s supposedly Pfizer higher efficacy J&amp;J. Sadly, no. turns they're giving covid-19 Chinese tourists, charging it.

It's really one worst gifts could get, kind dick move opinion. Half population get vaccine, open everything let people chose get vaccinated fray? idea sorry info Phoenix Municipal Stadium! wonder much focus vaccines treatment studies weren’t funded? corticosteroid used long-term management asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). telling husband same. want go see fireworks 4th July. Take kids parade fair. extremely bummed low risk outdoor activities get cancelled year. wear mask, dont care. give us stuff again. Yeah areas country people wearing masks. choice. looking math missing 100 million people likely covid. 40 million vaccinated, 100 million recovered, maybe 70 million seriously isolating = 210 million/320 million resistant virus. infection rate slow drastically seeing huge numbers infected November, December January say full herd immunity number one. get full herd immunity need 75 85% people protected. look covid-19 projections live 35 40% people virus. 35 40% people going out... Well know? cases plummeting like rock without lockdowns currently. Same. now, I'm vaccinated see reason go stuff again. honestly grim proposition think people refusing believe that's said all, fact blatant hyperbole change subject. Individuals can't set mass testing, fund vaccine production, create stay evictions foreclosures people work. I'm glad found ways live without government, changing topic. Heart wants wants! Aww hopefully find someone like equally caring! 💕

But keep doctor exactly need healthcare provider, someone makes feel heard cared for! Good doctors hard find! keep seeing everyone saying “herd immunity” reached reached it’s dropping. source “herd immunity” claims? Alright Bloomberg in, 1.1 million shots reported today pretty good monday, went 12.7 13.1 doses per 100 people. Congrats Alaska reaching 15 percent population getting least one dose 20 doses per 100. Big fat L Alabama even reaching 10 doses per 100 yet wtf. CA FL reach 10 percent population vaccinated tomorrow Wednesday people keep getting vaccinated, jus may feasible. Let’s hope... grandparents great grandma got vaccine week they’ll fine. *shakes fist “Reviewer Number 3”*

CURSSSESSSS Honestly respect people taking considerable precautions quietly anyone. always supported everyone educated risk profile taking &amp; anti-lockdown I’ve been, lot situations I’m thinking “this exactly person NEEDS careful”. you’re living cautiously, support that. don’t think shrieking everyone really much anymore. That’s huge range. way estimate using sewer measures? That’s really true.  Thats estimates heard immunity based original strains.   Vaccinations lower r value day, 70% vaccination levels would drastically reduce ability virus spread assuming sterilizing immunity vaccines, really clear yet. know severe disease/hospitalization / death appear avoided vacinated( really need). 

If SA variant like infectious may need even people vaccinated assuming sterilizing. certainly right point view That's I'm at.

I'll likely get vaccine early summer based age, I'm risk.

After vaccine personal incentive stay locked house summer. Thanks heads up. noticed post Dagger Controversy next wondered why. 

This reported often enough really shouldn’t surprising. hydroxychloroNO! never fucking snake oil.. UK government keeps saying AZ vaccine reduce serious illness SA variant evidence? mean I’m also judging history WHO. U.K. example easiest way backing distrust... I’m UK Wow. info yet whether covid vaccines prevent long-haul covid still get infected vaccinated? Also, safe assume vaccines would prevent people developing micro blood clots covid causes lungs organs? come March, we're 2020 again? Ugh. Another good (I would even say great) comparison Dakotas, though. Neither really restrictions, November-ish, North Dakota implemented mask mandate capacity restrictions, South Dakota continued nothing. that, ND slightly worse, afterwards, SD slightly worse, recall correctly. stop spread like last year. high cases already. related saying post history wow pro covid? Pro deaths? Seems like Problem increased community spread causes chances mutations produces COVID variants capable getting around vaccines. 

We can’t take eye ball elderly vulnerable people got vaccinated. 1.1 million according Bloomberg work hospital constantly amazed many patients come something completely unrelated, standard covid test, they're positive, completely asymptomatic like ""now hell get that??"" Lol appreciate wall numbers. pessimistic May estimate proves right, end spring - Jun 20th, clear. 

And words, failed recognize *massive* improvement seeing right now. Case numbers dropping, 12-15 million getting vaccines week, numbers continue drop. time nearing 50-60% vaccination numbers need, pandemic already much smaller today - thus vaccinations drive numbers exponentially. Bottom line, great days ahead us. welcome wear mask worry never get vaccine 2022 like. ⬇️⬇️⬇️ But.....you high chance survive it...plus vaccines proven able prevent death. Possibly gain soft power vaccine related favors. saying definitely case, Russia already seems use vaccine get soft power motive seems there. understand now, thanks explained comes infection rates getting much lower vaccines rollout. dont understand got downvoted though, genuinely sad thought everyone enjoying yet another summer.  Pssstt.... Don’t know you’ve “gotten news” form negative covid news experts considered “fear porn” thus downvoted. using generic version AirDuo (similar Advair) able get $25.  Also found Canadian study 80% participants able drop long acting inhaler per 24 hours, thus doubling life inhaler. may grants programs. reached hospital try applying secondary insurace like medicaid? agree you. get risk people either vaccinated it. Reopen all. risk people refuse vaccinations first ones get die. wave over, similar hospitalizations flu, unless one mutations makes vaccines ineffective causes bad reinfections. think June worst definitely over. “Most reasonably healthy people extremely low risk death virus”
Your interpretation: “covid isn’t real” never thought would miss drinks spilled people’s sweat would pay extra human pleasure right now. miss crowds, strangers &amp; giving fuck I’m enjoying music &amp; dancing crowd! Ok exception 😃... atend phone mild symptoms. like talk doctor. sweet kind voice, always feel truly cares you. Well Imagine stupid post internet stranger, I'm starting love her. course chance but... 💘 daughter diagnosed diabetes 17 months. give 1000's shots first 10 years life. Can't send vial I'll administer immediate family friends? Understood. sub-reddit blatantly pro-CCP

The amount posts say would point actually true.

Maybe anti ignorance, sure lot sub. people get vaccines people gotten virus, it’s possible many people even going get tested come April/May.

I would imagine vaccinated assume it’s common cold get sick virus (assuming unlucky enough get anyway). Ditto already covid.

Hope get back normal soon. Sn08? 9? *Available?* Probably April May. could take months actually get it. Hmmm... ask sources claims gender discrimination? 

You sure sound like one gentlemen sure systemic gender bias exists... Although does, likely men ones suffer it. I'm sure large events also mask ""rules"" too, lightly enforced 2022, things jump right back normal. I'm pretty good basic asshology think AZ trial low sample size, confidence interval something like -50% +60% efficacy, helpful. 'There 1,300 coronavirus-related deaths United States Sunday, data show, lowest single-day toll since late December' meanwhile 3 days number deaths record high 5,116. Ahh that's good news prevent SA variant becoming dominant since that's one cause issues vaccine efficacy Yup. US good ignoring sick people. Thanks really science thing, wanted hear y'know. grandad getting vaccinated next week (1st shot) granny weeks later safe im gonaa feel amazing exactly arguments imply silly. putting eggs basket governance. always disappoint. Humans need risk assessment, tolerance &amp; control decisions. Asking government dictate every move never ever ends well. live Tampa, Castor pushing stringent enforcement county state keep neutering enforcement. thread taken covidiots. Early 10X test scarce. 3x good news. I'm sorry hear lost family member this. However we're going look raw, readily available stats, actually fact true. 

Some assumptions first: OP United States age 54.

Dividing covid deaths/cases states gives 1.71% death rate. numbers obtained using Google's numbers posted embedded plots come search ""covid cases united states"". least nuanced numbers get.

Using data obtained here: determine 93% 1.71% deaths occurred people 55+ years age. 

So means 55 bank 1.71*(1-0.93)% chance death. That's 0.11% - one one thousand. course, people dying this. Statistically though, age 55 taken good care yourself, probably fine. apologize sounds insensitive, want reiterate truly condolences loved one passed away, stats stats I'd rather tell someone little concerned based hard numbers tell something worry based anecdotes. due vaccines stricter restrictions? one point start leaving house again... got second dose Saturday, felt little crappy yesterday, 100% now. Even I’d felt worse, it’s worth it. Short term suckiness long term gain. true all. reason people still got Covid everyone following rules laws masks limiting enforced pretty much anywhere. could go ""red"" town city country seen people going stores without masks seen videos parties big cities. I'll bet every person sub knows 10 family friends regularly visited people without masks. everyone followed rules 450 million people died. could gotten vaccinations minimal deaths. selfishness humanity encouraged former president caused deaths. say rules work born facts reality. facts compliance did, deaths would 10 fold. CDC still recommending people get vaccine even they've recovered. virus recently could, discretion, delay vaccination 90 said meant inoculate majority people living former British colonies. wasn’t used regions world well. pointing it’s used Brazil relevant? Imagine living first world country actually possible.  Now, laugh US practically zero understanding variants spreading where. SA variant exists low levels. Mostly imported cases, community transmissions. Transmissibility (the famous R number) apparently lower, containing U.K. variant eliminate SA variant. want get vaccinated would wait extra months Moderna shot Sputnik crap. trust Russia. think open herd immunity achieved, happen 2/3rds population vaccinated think I’m sorry :( try never complain state. county-based mask mandates indoors only. Everything else open &amp; unrestricted state. don’t know would cope tighter restrictions.
Please stay strong! Don’t let win getting down! Exactly, outbreaks disease. great tool see much community spread have. account fact states surged fall surge winter? California never saw surge expected Christmas, numbers stayed high, increased surge never came. Cases supposed surge Labor Day, never did. little restrictions early fall cases fell dramatically. Also, states restrictions states seen surges. I'm guessing surges ebb flow. lot people congregating isolating respectively since started. people working living crowded situation living alone working home whole time. Holidays probably play part, many variables never talked numbers support popular narratives talked about. look numbers daily read news daily (mostly LA NY Times, ect.) numbers always match every aspect. interesting say least. Well still *complain* , go doctors it..! get news MSM world controlled virus like east asia New Zealand, chance virus mutating type strains would orders magnitude lower think we’ll see another spike vaccinate everybody needs be. Also vaccine unproven promising according studies got approved won’t know well works until
We see mass population scale coming. Prepare downvoters. Long term covid exist far sub concerned Covid certainly death sentence even risk people. Username checks. I'm sure meet person close fibromyalgia life... ??? Read thread. responding comment can’t let grandma assess risk could spread others—the usual justification keeping things closed. floor!!! missing forest trees here: lot people saying think summer things turn around subtle hint plan done summer terms restrictions. think people sub need understand that, people act rationally government beholden people make demands it....do really think politicians going allow another summer closures? live vaccination distribution actually run medical clinic, they're ones compiling list, really easy verify actual conditions. Makes really hard understand. US partial herd immunity situation. 2/3 Americans going much 1/3 infected that's we're seeing terms numbers... Also would suspect already infected likely level immunity guy coronavirusca subreddit last summer complaining people Tahoe vacationing Tahoe. rich Eh, I’m stuck Schrodingers COVID. didn’t hit anyone bad know (no one old) mom even entirely asymptomatic. worries spreading getting it. guess it’s ironic considering least concerned getting somehow one avoided entirely. UK EU depending AZ vaccine short term (hence EU raised diplomatic shitstorm production shortfall). shown protect variants makes vast majority cases Europe. 

In long term, UK EU ordered enough doses vaccines protect population need arise. UK ordered many Pfizer vaccines, instance ordered 60 million doses Novavax jab (which shown work South Africa produced UK) 30 million J&amp;J jabs, soon approved use UK. So, take away another outdoors exercise possibility? logical move, doubt... Nearly states following ACIP recommendations.  uncle passed complications covid. went hospital senior care/rehabilitation facility it, twice; means many others likely exposed even though never ventured room. politics (in U.S.) around virus FKING joke!! pisses scares crap things handled. Meanwhile family whole FKKING year social distancing isolation continue witness countless others selfish lack discipline. That’s gonna too. Can’t wait spend 21st drinking alone home instead partying friends. ohio, still masking everywhere. person dining social distancing masks unless actually eating. Bars limited time numbers, etc. And?

China finalized paid order December.

Germany EU supported Biontech 500 million €, facility aquired German tax payer money help German government.

Fosun Biontech also open new production facility China weeks, case produce mainland China export anything everyone vaccinated.

The export stop happens US Pfizer facilities UK AZ.

I totally get doses Pfizer Brussels facility exported world, that's contracts made beginning, doses German production facility (aquired September!) also exported world, beyond me.

The EU know everyone else structured contracts, pure incompetence. It’s funny family dumped 10’s thousands dollars sit home reading textbooks. online classes really feel like scam. Canada already begging. AZ plant EU Belgium serves EU. reason they've issues AZ deliveries UK allow exports AZ plant UK AZ said Belgium plant production issues. 74.9% population immune, benefit virus hindered way, effectively 0% population immune

Being facetious gets me. Again, I'll try explain herd immunity one last time easy understand terms. herd immunity achieved, changes mobility effect number cases. Period. That's easy gets. one person American get infected today vaccinated, already infected, benefitted vaccines partial immunity.

So, we've moved calling partial immunity? lock contours un-challengeable projections. many new cases average April?

If cases increase low point wave, herd immunity achieved. That's bottom line. Herd immunity would mean 1 number cases continues decline. getting paid this? Sweet! Also reported name-calling You’re welcome health insurance inhaler still expensive. (And even GoodRx.) makes say this? really think it’s hard everyone different ways. I’m hoping fall keep pushing change time comes lost hope. I’m sorry you’ve lost time family, think see irretrievable.   know former nurse (who's health care well decade) signed work location like 10 hours. exchange, he's front-line medical worker qualifies get vaccine.

I'd probably too. bot know something civil incivil? wondering alot J&amp;J AZ especially whole South african variant results appear wildy different. South Africa said AZ offers minimal protection mild moderate symptoms due young age group can't say yet definite whether still stops severe symptoms. I'm assuming looked anyone symptoms right? 

J&amp;J meant similar vaccine said they're vaccine offers 57% moderate severe symptoms. I'm probably missing something seems paper J&amp;J excluded mild symptoms considering say moderate severe different small study South Africa. Would correct thinking numbers J&amp;J could alot lower well include mild symptoms well not? think give another 2-3 months right. point majority high risk people either vaccinated, developed natural immunity. cases Covid go way open nation largely younger, healthier people relatively spread outside events provided keep distanced, even without masks spring coming many things open. Right many states even gien vaccine people 60-70 high risk chronic illness. people get hospitalized die. know. May be. But... AstraZeneca also many plants, EU.

I would say, CureVac real EU Novavax. Novavax option future. May be. Thank much. know people weren’t good spreading probably wouldn’t evolving much. understand that. pointing recent vaccines produced long term effects haven’t appeared two months existing technology. suggesting ""new normal"" permanent? add fuel conspiracy nuts. Restrictive suggestions. Lol Well misunderstood comment, invite try again... know wrote 5 days ago things went back normal plague Spanish Flu, way worse people even much them. Yes it’s sufficient. Everyone good go right comment pro CCP comments, belong neither lies others telling China here. obvious lie disproven question told first place. copd auto immune ? Imagine saying “fam” 2021. Found boomer I'm sorry 🐑 Yeah, inexpensive health insurance. really bad news Wyoming South Dakota you’re hoping get see people moving 😂 Well, maybe paid better. wife asked give vaccinations... unpaid intern. doubt many dentists used making $100/hr interested. Asymptotic complications? scary! happened??? American !!!! you. Everything *must* reduced sort lecture individual responsibility rather dealing *public* health. bad habit people outside Empire's heartland notice immediately. characteristic accents, perhaps so. American's love fight amongst make accusations moral perfidy opponents inevitably descends insult. internet magnifies bad habit. 

As age, given statistical probabilities pretty well certainly twice age, probably parents possibly three times age. 

As personal decision get vaccinated play silly little moralistic game seem love. Guess, guess country. Kazakhstan perhaps.  help anyway. EU export ban fit ""doom gloom"" narrative allowed. got dates wrong admitted - Chinese stifled investigators scientific community early on.

Hell, went far doctor tried warn colleagues severity virus publicly admonished dragged police precinct sign admission guilt force promise keep mouth shut.

With practices, anyone believe better question.  vaccine (not covid-19) need time become effective. immune system need time make antibodies make cells remember ""threat"". game? game? Hypocrisy partying French Laundry lost.

Was though, I've heard pretty much every day since We're never gonna vaccinate 300m people. Kids 24% population get earliest June July among adults probably like 20-30% never get it. knocks us like 175-210m people get pre children. People starting come around fact probably never reach herd immunity (not stop normalcy coming Summer though) prison health care staff facility employees fall Phase 1 vaccine distribution plan, prisoners classified Phase 2, Gautz said. Phase 2 mass vaccination campaign for residents 16 older may begin number mods delete posts altered company, till date, initiated rolling review process regulatory agencies across globe, including European Medicines Agency (EMA), US Food Drug Administration (FDA), UK Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Health continue submitting additional information, including clinical manufacturing data, part rolling reviews carry Novavax concludes pivotal Phase III trials UK US till initial emergency use authorisation granted country-specific regulations. every virus ever known, people get it. Scientists entirely sure tons theories factors go consider incredibly lucky. US population = ~328.2 million.
300 / 328.2 = 0.914 91.4% vaccinated.

We'll herd immunity vaccines + infections LONG end summer. less cases reported less testing. wrong, fun see people wrong opinion surprised. end April, want vaccine get day. I’m 100% fine mask mandates continuing another year. problem wearing one anywhere. want able go friends house responsibly, see outdoor concert anything.  masks aren’t issue, it’s go hang house. website say, want 30,000 take part 2/3 getting vaccine &amp; 1/3 placebo. boyfriend’s roommate began experiencing symptoms two weeks ago today, tested positive two weeks ago tomorrow. Thankfully, around roommate week prior first symptoms. Tomorrow supposedly roommate’s quarantine ending, boyfriend intends go home then, he’s staying mother back forth avoid going home. dad who’s cancer patient one lung, don’t wanna risk bringing home anything boyfriend gonna getting exposed infection. two weeks generally sufficient? prepared downvotes since asking question still would appreciate answer. 1) cases trending down
2) vaccine vulnerable people been/are vaccinated Reddit going without Covid constant talking point?? Sample size 30 meaningful. We’ve seen lot stories similar premises fall apart upon inspection. randomly test everyone involved

Wouldn't bias trials positively, since catching early/asymptomatic infections getting early treatment would lead better outcomes? Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

Scientists seldom issue statement absolute certainty. Add fact mRNA vaccines mRNA therapy market long (or all), scientists say know long term effects are, conventional knowledge tells us near-zero long term effects, good gets. yes, agree say, scientists attest statement data back claim. Anti-vaxxers generally cling idea scientists cannot prove certainty long term side effects, hence vaccine might harmful, totally untrue. violent protests Austria peaceful protests took place Vienna lead young population mostly middle-aged old right-wing populists.

It's also true young peeps risk. read it, scope seems bit coworker anitvaxxer... likes argue vaccine. try stay simply can't change guys mind. latest thing showed [Israel stated 160k people vaccinated &amp; .4% (I think) contracted virus. showed demonstrate 95% effectiveness vaccine accurate &amp; work. whole thing is... study vaccine given. thinking get vaccine &amp; get sick go back &amp; count statistic? asymptomatic? thinks data way since could get vaccine &amp; symptoms, therefore count ""study"". say guy terms study statistics vaccine actually administered? Prince?  numbers way multiple reasons. First off, people getting second doses gonna bring first dose value way estimate. point people wearing masks places like department stores, grocery stores, etc workers actually immunized means likely early summer won’t eligible till late spring takes month give take couple weeks fully immunized. thinking well - suggests asymptomatic cases thought. remember seeing study back summer testing wastewater area Italy, study suggested ~3x people infected confirmed/reported. there, question extent carrying virus asymptomatic means antibodies give sufficient immunity near (or near) future, significant risk re-infection.

Let's fail realize seem correlation lockdowns+masks working progression/spread virus.

Neither side argument holds whole lot water. I'm saying things seem much worse Florida anywhere else, South Dakota anywhere else, etc... Personally, given choice restrictions harsh lockdowns seem whole lot besides destroying mental economic health, I'd take restrictions day. Given respiratory plague I'm really surprised we're considering asthma treatments. think would first place look. tend agree see people even go outside without mask time. wearing even really necessary probably harm good (I'd imagine people need get much sunlight possible vitamin D) see stopping anytime soon. people, especially reddit seem love masks. mRNA vaccines incapable infecting anything definition infectious agents. 

This wrong. mRNA vector could made full kit get using ""infection"" colloquial sense,

It may man made, uses nature's tricks. tricks, virus use infection. body reacts infection. chemical /mechanical aspects same. scientist, sure hell sounds like infection. Fair. I’ll leave rest discussion r/sino Nooooooooooooooooo hahaha gone long change deal now, need begin planning reopening. People tired this. true 1-dose J&amp;J vaccine too? sure... kind kidding, know that's possible. Would fun tho. Wouldn’t comparing data two states scientific way look it? don’t understand. question going become comparatively common seasonal flu, occasionally weirdly show areas. 

If it’s former, I’m confident we’ll ever reach true normal. Even looks like do, think people living 20s pretty scared reach 70s Covid still around. Almost feels like ticking time bomb you’ll inevitably catch virus also low chance survive it. Ah yes, Biden becomes president covid disappears. wonderful America truly is. askscience thread, said able vaccinate 300 million Americans end summer. sure doesnt sound like Spring timeline given case certainly wont get normal summer like many hoping. wish could get actual timeline knew prepare plan accordingly.
What bothering rollout complicated phase system. dont understand phase 1 wasnt Health care workers, grocery workers, teachers, large group living environments, phase 2 everyone else!! r/coronavirus case realize. IIRC antibodies peak day 57 something J&amp;J phase 3 went day 28? Wonder maybe efficiency increases past day 28  2 friends died shit, know cost. Getting second shot 2 weeks. Good luck Exactly, like people comments dont understand works lol.. contagious strains spreading like wildfire.

Is fact scientists predicting it? problem viral vector vaccines grow new strain massive quantities, takes lot time. mRNA vaccines skip step entirely don’t need cultivate live virus, making process much faster. get liver treat too!!

No one followed them, one got stopped fined breaking curfew. fact, many law enforcement agencies throughout state outright refused enforce them. total joke. go back normal, year? local news station says children won’t get vaccine January 2022?

That said, suck job all. quite decent it. they’re slow vaccines start vaccinations occupied territories?? Could also due high exposure coronaviruses dense populations, giving way cross reactive cell exception negative side effects buried studies, financial reasons, long term negative effects long studied drug definition unforeseen. Pure speculation

The explicit point article speculate might happen. fact AZ basically doesn’t work B.1.351 doesn’t matter you? think critique intelligence others. fall 2019 community college transfer uni 2 quarters (5 months), covid hit March. graduate June...  No, been. green new deal high school science teacher. trying simplify explanation people much possible understand without much background. Sometimes, jargon gets way good science-y fellow. AZ currently company making profit vaccine. selling cost production 2 3 $ depending part world it’s produced in. AZ vaccine currently also one suitable use outside big vaccination centers don‘t need deep freezer store it. AZ also produces doses Pfizer Moderna. vaccine can‘t prevent every mild case variant. it‘s effective original strain prevents severe cases SA variant let‘s use it. cheaper widely available. still use for-profit vaccines high-risk population. let‘s forget Pfizer Moderna still haven‘t shown vaccine works variants real-world setting. poignant observation.  confirm. 

People tired Cuomo around . vaccines use spike protein well, deliver protein instead mRNA codes protein.

AstraZeneca's vaccine uses spike protein, effective South African strain. cancelled trial South Africa due this. Dang, want USA get more. need ASAP continue bottles. think there’s still memory immunity things antibodies (your white blood cells)

What describing tcell response verifiable medical science. certainly cell response covid. know. U.S. big companies corporations make rules pay politicians big money things way. big pharma insurance companies never get free healthcare. still pay lot insurance, deductibles, premiums, copay, prescriptions whatever else covered those. things said plus fact kept businesses open similar ones close, much relief money got small businesses got shafted course fact can’t even follow lockdown rules set out. Why? interest politicizing basic hygiene pandemic? Interesting. conclusive stretch everyone assuming Asian culture helping physical distancing/masking habits.

A quick search shows US mortality rate COVID-19 kind shows trend. you’d assume Asians would somewhat uniform feelings towards masking...not totally somewhat more.

The difference Asians next two (Latino/White) pretty crazy.

How many young patients mom had? data certainly suggest young people great risk. True. now, holding line.

It's rough. really rough. want visit friends. want go crowded bar around hot women nachos beer dancing bar band lose moment. Everybody know who's far said first dose nothing maybe soreness injection site, second dose came side effects ranging slightly muscle soreness can't get bed 2 days. 

I'm still waiting first dose. one other? I’m curious going true. first dose moderna vaccine. covid previously, first dose mimicked worst symptoms initial run covid, lasted one day instead 7-9 days. Getting second dose couple weeks. take way, trying elaborate. Essentially thought immune-mediated thrombocytopenia result vaccination, theoretically anything ""foreign"" risk trigger immune mediated thrombocytopenia. moment history susceptible individuals vaccinated, point continuing ""eradication"" campaign? Every hard-fought inch progress made pandemic incurred devastating consequences people supposedly protecting. afraid of? cure eventually worse disease? it? quacks like duck. Whatever people ultimately ""choose"" do, viruses keep spreading way make efficient spread. seriously take threat infectious disease; based history, generational lessons get passed on. Ok news that? taking over? california experiencing surge cases it? Explain articles time said opposite then: ""And hugged second. Happy consider friends. Crowd stands applause. Curtains drop. Lights go out. Good play article:

The Colorado Department Public Health Environment (CDPHE) says hard use surveillance outbreak data attribute cases specific exposures. cases like lift lines, visitors staff may multiple opportunities exposure also eating out, mixing households, and/or traveling friends.

Since Nov. 11, 32 COVID-19 outbreaks associated ski/board resorts ski/board industry. outbreaks include 106 cases among staff four cases among patrons. According CDPHE, hard detect patron outbreak cases, officials believe reported number underestimate. number surprising given it’s lethality primarily amongst elderly?

To clear I’m arguing nursing homes general fucked not, age previous health conditions obvious correlating factors, many people old nursing homes likely aren’t great health  concerns actually almost year now. seriousness COVID, impact have, questions regarding variants mutations, questions regarding re-infection, questions regarding children able catch spread covid, potential benefits masks.... yet along positive spin put. articles negative outcomes, article questioning instance re-infection, voted articles giving support closing schools. led half million deaths counting. far worst outcome country. People pushing positive outcome want end want 'go back whatever manner ' covid came along.

Vaccines another one subjects. conspiracy theorist, chipping people, controlling people narrative rather narrative support idea vaccines come along quickly over. narrative may well quite substantial timeframe full effects vaccines seen impact covid daily lives. Maybe continue wearing masks even vaccinated? Maybe mutations arise requiring vaccine development? 

If people really want reduce impact covid lives need start assuming responsibility careful measures slowly reduce risk drip drip. 25 million cases US giving 25 million opportunities development mutation. 

But that's going happen. want problem go away. willing accept responsibility. want magically disappeared go back normal lives. meantime blame WHO, blame Chinese, blame governments, blame neighbors, blame scientists, blame Brazilians, South Africans British. 

Rant over........ number surprising given it’s lethality primarily amongst elderly?

To clear I’m arguing nursing homes general fucked not, age previous health condition obvious correlating factors, many people old nursing homes likely aren’t great health got first Pfizer vaccine, arm sore day two. honestly felt like flu shot! I’m pretty worried second dose though... I’ve heard lot women really feel effects 2nd one. :( second dose worst side effect slightly sore arm, almost like put good workout night before. know I’m minority, want know there’s hope. sincerely hope they’re able find way this. Could last 60 seconds! probably not. Whatever is, $1 million dollar worth care nothing compared debt hospitals built pandemic. Surely government bailout gonna happen books audited; imagine hospitals partially bailed essentially forced collect payments owed aggressively. mildly sore didn’t sleep well. felt unwell enough justify calling work getting day off, couple Advil would done trick too. don't, see curves worldometer here! Getting girlfriend, we're prepared dead Sunday lol know difference dentist sadist? mean suggestion already observed several variants issue inherently bad.

Which generalization irrelevant content posted. posts go sideways. talking about? Deaths follow curve new infections. Unfortunately dont know many people would willing go me, even break plans make small group trips fully take advantage pass, I'm lucky ill get go great america once. I'm kinda small person like alone big places like that, I've bad experiences. Maybe travel taser, lol. 

But maybe they'll travel starved get go enough merit season pass! wanderlust confined more! That’s good eli5 Fuck ya got one today. arm pretty sore Cowabunga* Lmao idk think want it. I'm saying 35% population still susceptible dying really see going away asap. Especially vaccines children yet Good timing hahahaha would commenter purposely choose disingenuousness pandemic article? rabid anti-dentite! Oh, starts jokes slurs, next thing know saying schools. rain anyone’s parade, study done lab. see vaccine actually protects people UK SA variants, need run study thousand participants countries variants prevalent. Like Oxford/AstraZeneca South Africa non-profit vaccine, proved less effective variant. late 70's parents got last week: soreness injection site.

The nurses spoken said almost identical flu vaccine terms percentage people feel something soreness.  I’m favor long term mask mandate; definitely think politicians need make threshold decline cases, threshold reached, mandate ends.

That said, wish could end like Asian countries people sick choose wear masks voluntarily. Yep, exact thing..

Except possibility [long-term neurological cardiac damage (!!!), damage olfactory nerve, damage lungs, etc..

All us participated (and continue participate) trials helped ensure public trust safety vaccines. Yeah, hurts. fun vaccine. fun time, sure fun 460k families. also fun mom young patients code her.. people 70 without comorbidities? data/recovery rate? concerning mutation 484 too... wish people would verify share. I’m happy share information, never want vector misinformation.  moderately sore arm first shot, second shot, extremely sorry arm, fever, chills, body soreness fatigue two days gone woke next morning. bad can't scroll read comments something  response popular one criticize South African variant N501Y. article says 

These results show neutralizing antibody titers following natural infection vaccination effective UK variant (B.1.1.7) viral strains containing single point mutations positions 501 614 within spike protein. 

Is South African variant covered then? they've said postphoning. Tokyo 2020 2021 would cancelled altogether Here's hoping right. Overall, I'm optimistic well, back forth good news/bad news frustrating confusing. I'm hoping end summer puts us better place. Title misleading...unless I'm missing something here?? tested UK variant.
 
Warning article: ""However, variants continue emerge, essential assess impact potency neutralizing responses following infection vaccination, warns team."" aware two mutations popping elsewhere, including Brazil UK. point study commenting prove vaccines efficacy them. B.1.1.7 N501Y mutation. read pre-print article based time. Zuckerberg Sandgirl need start taking responsibility radicalizing idiot Americans. Misinformation becoming dangerous country rest us. overall incidence cases continues fall across Spain, authorities warning people ‘drop guard,’ possible fourth wave way thought interesting twitter thread discussing might be:  source covers extensively? insane incompetent negotiators seem be. would say 2 reasons may better regular inhaled steroid.

First active drug different garden variety steroid. may work better control cytokine storm.

Secondly regular inhaled steroid diffuse cell wall order get cell work, slow drug actually might make cell all. experimental drug contained within exosomes, external membrane sorts, allows cell ACTIVELY absorb exosome contents. likely using exosomes drug taken targeted cells lungs. Looking mortality graph. Second wave over. First wave finished seasonality virus. winter would continue march/april/may woul huge first waves small second ones. peaked almost month ago. Deaths always follow cases 2,3 even 4 weeks delay. Sweden over. countries. Even without vaccination. Examples? Bosnia&amp;hercegovina, Croatia, Serbia, India,... That’s honestly p remarkable, god willing hold fast mother late 80's 1st dose (Pfizer) even sore arm, kept checking home allergies meds + fine - said Influenza vaccine last Fall caused arm really sore covid vac - second dose Wednesday, hope goes well first one! (she never covid-19) absolutely idea many asymptomatic individuals longterm negative health outcomes. study Diamond Princess showed 30% group older guess undetected health problems 

So let's imagine 0.5% infected lung, heart, whatever problems virus. 

If 100 million Americans COVID, that's 500,000 people affected, idea damage quite time. Agreed, countries EU agreed think, poorer countries wanted cheapest deals hindered ability negociate doses. /r/collapse pretty extreme place people rational thought. said that, definitely users equally delusional thinking next month won’t wear masks. Brazil one mutation two strains (P.1) (P.2), infectious one P1 cointains spike protein SA UK developed year, E484K that's source explain Moderna already sure thing JJ likely. AZ probably stop gap measure autumn/ end year. Anyone overweight safely lose counting calories. 

But saying it’s easy like saying heroin addict easily put needle. act actually setting needle physically easy, there’s lot mental issues go along it. IMO that’s entirely reasonable thing Fauci say.  we're cool. take way. honest intentions start conversation. getting permanent damage? 

AGAIN, there’s reason think it’s permanent. You’re creating information doesn’t exist. this? 

You’re literally example called comment you’re replying to. There’s chance stay actually incurred 1.4 million dollars expenses hospital. month. nurses doctors cared hospital’s payroll whether there. bed monitoring equipment already arrived. $1.4 million like hospital thinks services worth. Yes. I'm concerned new strains honest... Went check Wiki Ben Embarek, whilst Google's cache says ""Danish scientist"", page says ""Chinese scientist"". people *quick*. give time life work done save lives year. China several lab leaks accidents two last decades resulted outbreaks.

So matter make sure know case SARS-CoV-2 prevent happen future.

Who fucked chinese government (CCP), (just remember) also concentration camps order eliminate Uyghur culture, chinese people. Also Herman Cain. Caught Trump event even, anyone cared, including Twitter handlers. live mainly covid soon could others could make better use vaccine someone already existing antibodies. Enough time? OK. 

Until ""enough"" time passed allowed die. Nice you?
And nice infectious ""enough time""?
And nice absurdly low overall efficacy 60-70% AZ? recall: low efficacy can't stop pandemic. nice stay pandemic forever.

For AZ F-grade vaccine excluded forgotten.

Biontech(as Modern, CureVac Novavax) vaccine without drawbacks. nothing discuss, Astrazeneka(as Sputnik J&amp;J) dead. You’re missing key point. 

It shouldn’t considered “it’s highly unlikely”. 

Which is. There’s reason continue theorize something didn’t happen, morons continue conspiracy theorists. 

Hell, going post, better isn’t allows conspiracies take over. Thank last sentences. Sometimes get unreasonably mad spouse still don’t understand hard things me, even “good” day. 

My dad condition me, tell look bad I’m feeling given day. He’s one can. guy never played obsidian statue That's conclusion **at all**, rather ""a growing number top experts lab leak remains plausible scientific hypothesis investigated, regardless likely unlikely"".

And think anyone disagree - interestingly increasing likelihood time goes on, due China's hiding know lack additional ""natural cause"" evidence due US etc influence.

I would like US declassify know w/ lab workers getting sick, country pretty direct propaganda previous administration. Hard take Pompeo anything.

I agree though, end day modern day Chernobyl, sound well meaning scientists lab unique purposes - really know information beyond feel sick them. But, still good know, carry investigating etc. It'll gradient, variants showing clear signs immune escape easier time reinfecting already prior infection. Definitely Brazilian strain, example. already thing? one whole year. bad, like first dose lethargic. pfizer one supposed worse. typically one day weather arm hurting. girlfriend Spain got Moderna. got apparently shite useless AZ one weeks back. agree with. anti vaccine makes pro death yes probably 20 delta flights I’ve taken since summer, I’ve next person 2 times. 2 southwest flights I’ve taken, I’ve next someone times.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* article tell anything. said went China thats it. Everyone aware Waaaaaaaaaaaaay early say anything close definitively. Whats big blob south/east Siberia, seems heavily populated? three vaccines close one another efficacy original strain, ultimately function way, targeting protein spike original Wuhan virus. change spike affects efficacy one would theory affect efficacy others way.

I say mRNA vaccines could take bigger dip slightly less effective Wuhan strain compared Novavax, assume dips efficacy proportional started. guesses, though. aggressive smokers, overweight alcoholics? I’m blaming I’m blaming headline Probably Fauci multiple sources saying things like: even one lucky gotten Covid-19 shot, important continue wearing face covering researchers determine whether vaccines prevent people spreading virus others vaccinated, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said district work in-person since October. However virtual option aren’t comfortable child in-person. a) still efficacy numbers Pfizer/Moderna SA variant. They've done trial yet.

b) Oxford team still confident vaccine strong effect severe illness/death SA train - trial data yet. trust NYT, article gives good summary: TL;DR

No.

And matter? 2 problems now: become pandemic, *some* focused shifting blame away trying anything virus. help calling ""China-virus"". *here*, *now*, names origins remove it.

No matter world came from, *probably* came animals. Maybe mess nature much? We're going cross-infect eternity. dismissed right away. mostly bunch weak bureaucrats CCP's payroll. No, reaction second shot. matched doctor tinder. Might ask vaccine point. Anyway stupid. day. COVID going real issue around world several years come. winning, covid olympics. holiday pandemic long actually register legitimate spike cases couldn’t statistically attributed catch-up reporting people working getting tested actual holiday/holiday weekend Christmas.

The US large surge new cases mid-June late July, following Memorial Day Independence Day holidays. almost continuous surge late October second week January, corresponding Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's Eve. Starting two weeks New Year, new cases plummeted people hunker holidays, vaccines reached little 10% population. 

The big test vaccine success Memorial Day year, least one rhird population vaccinated perhaps another third half naturally exposed virus. would put us overall percentage antibodies experts say need slow spread, something probably achieved yet today. Got second dose feel fine, sore arm nothing else. Ran mile hours getting usual 3 mile run morning. Drank boatload water receiving today. Keep pet. starting. everywhere unfortunately. USA example, pretty comprehensive ban immigration right live Manhattan. People Jersey driving die Lenox Hill. hope India sustain double digit economic growth decades resources fight deadly diseases like Covid, TB, malaria, many more. 

Sadly see country still stuck sluggish growth leaders unable see full potential nation instead wag dog. weeks insane amount time... 3 months doses

I think that's pretty standard lot non-COVID vaccinations - no? AFAIK small gaps moment mostly would mean quicker trial results. think lot people never really thought hard, all, number deaths US every day/month/year prevalence viruses illnesses, number deaths occur nursing homes tragic itself.

But see drumbeat news Covid big numbers fatalities think worst disaster world ever seen, whereas statistically really bad. also think people realize 80-90% fatalities among people elderly sick already. say people count anything different story affecting primarily young healthy population. someone got Moderna vaccine....YAY! asked said Covid related deaths wondered would direct only.

In UK included everyone ever Covid initially, think saw much dodgy reporting.

Then moved within 28 days positive test. also stats mentioned death certificates also excess deaths.

I think UK stats yet probably estimation using excess deaths category end - doubt priority.

Something like cancer would expect increase delaying treatment bad outcomes flu would expect drop.  Immigration still happening, extent want move country can. won’t optional point OP, I'm sure would quote several things article miss Food Drug Administration Centers Disease Control Prevention said looking reports, far, rates condition vaccinated people appear higher rates normally found U.S. population, cases could coincidental.

seriously, non-story actual doses primary bottleneck. Next comes older people forced use scheduling systems they're comfortable using means children helping them, get appointment. 

There enough people administer shots aren't, state-imposed obstacle deciding set vaccination centers instead using existing medical centers. setting ever people give shots get sort dose allocation, also increases search costs finding appointment. get search state-run vaccination centers, hospital vaccination centers, drive stadium ones, local pharmacies, dentist. real issue went finding mother-in-law vaccine appointment.

Dentists want people go get dental work done getting covid vaccine. Trips dentists due covid.

Fun fact: dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants considered front-line medical workers first covid vaccination phases many states.

You clearly idea talking about. think genomic analysis SARS leak would shown?
It would shown natural virus. Leave science scientists. antibodies shown last least 8 months.  MERS SARSr-CoV strain Yep, Oxford academic institution means likely keen get research data. basically bottomless pot research funding long pandemic continues haha. Usually clinical trials challenging fund getting funding stage extremely laborious. American thing pictures come US everyone waiting trucks queued get vaccine. Makes chuckle bit. Nope. total waste. 

I get enjoy wailing gnashing teeth bunch illiterate redditors 😎. already have. MERS still thing pandemic. one things media botched messaging...yet again. Technically possible spread vaccines provide sterilizing immunity, way interpreted ""you still totally spread like before"". 

Not true. vaccines greatly reduce spread, (Pfizer, Moderna) eliminate 95% symptomatic illness, bulk spread goes away. theoretically possible prevent, say, 70% true asymptomatic infections, secondary attack rate &lt;1% regardless. Pandemics medical social end. social end happens people decide risks virus smaller risks getting life. enjoy cope. It’s do. Half world... People going constant reminders pandemic need get vaccinated long time yet really doubt anyone going forget. may want look quacks. There’s reason started equivocating Bill pressing kooky theories. 

Bill even called squirrely segment. plausible, fit known genetic evidence. Hence theory popular amongst laypeople among experts.

If virus undergone long chain evolution wild, add extra completely unnecessary step going lab? Like running marathon getting taxi last tiny leg. Whilst evolution occurred lab, would obvious telltale signs. Well said. think people need also realize vaccines 100% effective preventing severe cases, deaths, hospitalizations. lot states track individually seen national sources BBC always done this. story breaks initial article bare bones, facts come verified internally them, flesh article. really issue it. responsible reporting. horrible lose child young. That’s gut wrenching. I’d lost moment like that. whole state think 1 nearly 10k deaths someone 20 Covid. google pets covid, says dogs quite immune still somewhat spread virus replicate mucous membranes, cats ferrets catch spread quite easily. dont confirmed study, seems logical covid binding affinity ace2 receptor (most?) mammals, although dont get sick die it, virus replicate dog cat licking face could give covid. comment dumbest thing I've ever read. There's pride achieving herd immunity comes expense 155 thousand recorded deaths.

India succeed mix vaccines post-infection immunity. Get head ass. competition countries, global pandemic. Pushing unlikely scenarios began Ferguson model last year. precautionary principle running wild. countries. 
America waaaaay fair share nutballs countries competent governments could’ve contained virus like China did. 

Especially got see China handled first. 

I would’ve preferred harsh 10 week lock almost year bullshit US response been. fact US airlines given competing anything beyond price. source youth vaccinated causing cases highly vaccinated countries. virus spilled humans though intermediate animal short stay Chinese lab. Ah!

I find articles interesting though encouraging. team continues analyse data impact population increases use data driven analysis come updated hypothesis. resources show this? I've trying this, I've read bits pieces. technically true based recent studies, spreading virus ""healthy"" ""young"" people make barely blip hospitals older folks vaccinated 12 weeks insane amount time... 3 months doses, means would get vaccinated April, even able get next dose July... 

Wouldnt lead lot people forgetting get second dose? eventually variant X evade authorised vaccines current form. AZ really working SA variant good news inevitable one product would first fail new variant. There’s already AZ 2.0 SA variant that’ll trialled real soon - hopefully enough greybeards sample time! Okay, sure, happens reached full herd immunity exactly date everyone went home rest holidays. Rigghhhhtttt. saying unless concrete causes believe this. interest advertise product one constantly becoming less effective. health officials say that? Cases going people getting vaccinated!! It’s wonder health experts getting tuned general public. think responded wrong post missed context response.  Americans would stop first four letters start snickering, followed crying remember pre-Covid life. Also, expecting people indefinitely forfeit new friendships relationships? Hard no. (This apply me, burns policymakers dismiss basic social needs.) Uh that’s said all. It’s well within human nature cooperate sacrifice greater good. lab leak natural virus exactly plausible - it’s happened before. don’t see scientists denying previously demonstrated happened. supposed take path flu vaccines - i.e. fast track approval That’s like cops checking drug dealer drugz. Next year.  Please. one sense believes garbage Mayor town says considering granting permits large events public areas (convention center, outdoor parks) maybe quarter 1 2022, take city council publics feedbacks well chief medical officer county's opinion countries like UK US high vaccination numbers Vietnam Thailand controlled virus quite well ? number people online saying “if get shot still spread virus!” conviction makes want put head wall. article say covid-9 That’s true. Many people around world wear without forced. change time Americans even realise that's name country. No, get reasonable estimate looking rates change dna residues. That's here.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 4 weeks going smaller city need requarantine. Chinese International tourism vaccinate majority population. Cases amongst vaccinated population almost non-existant. Covid affects brain organs well causing blood clots. hope autopsy find cause death. File under: shit. world without tourism immigration isn’t one want live in. Check patient assistance programs manufacturer. Post COVID inhaler went $579 $505 GoodRX.. $50 copay insurance... $0 applying patient assistance program “insurance” manufacturer.

... it’s Spiriva Respimat, godsend, i’m literally paying shitty proAir brand name med lol I’ll wait “a little longer” one condition - soon one dose vaccine sits unused 30 days everyone eligible, one wants it, everything 100% opened back up. questions asked. 

This doesn’t seem likely me. Please read article rather spread misinformation. Australia almost perfectly, isnt it? guys like cases per day, usually small outbreak due someone importing overseas. really hurry except closed borders living pretty much normal lives? people comorbidities also get asymptomatic/mild cases covid? 

They say people issues like High blood pressure, diabetes, lung issues, obesity, cancer, heart disease highest mortality rate. Old age well. curious also common people get asymptomatic/mild cases covid. 

Thanks! Anyone else long enough remember time saying word China got destroyed sub? likely scenarios order:

1. Intermediary animal = pangolin
2. Intermediary animal = different bat species
3. Intermediary animal = mustelid (family includes mink)
4. Came lab testing son’s college promised shutdown completely 3% student body got Covid. gave goal back September.  Doesn’t matter lot crazies (like nearly everywhere else). fair share brilliant scientists. CHINAS LYING /s. Millions died incompetence ignorance want someone blame. Yeah, China’s fur farming district Weifang. farms 100,000 mink they’ve outbreaks influenza A, distemper (which combined influenza made scarier version), pseudorabies, corona viruses, even mad cow disease feed dead mink back living ones, brains all. poor St Petersburg Going to? are. decades already. Great news. Even then, confidence interval study wild, can’t even make conclusions mild/moderate AZ either. noise it’s completely useless fake news letter. I'm tin foil hat kind guy believe possible. fast mutations make wonder whether designed purpose well. never know Yeah, no... sorry dude. Antibodies important part vaccine response. 

Sure, memory B cells better nothing. chilling spleen lymph nodes, sites virus would actually enter body. don’t make antibodies themselves- differentiate plasma cells first. help clear virus faster, can’t respond quickly circulating antibodies can.  No, study pandemic history, animal human contact, simple see happening since XX century: mass farming advances deflorestation. Reddit become wasteland type mindless comments past months. Everything worthless fear-mongering ‘disinformation’. guys refused wear mask first 6 months thing, think finally ‘get it’. still don’t. doesn't. Numbers falling took office, nothing done could possibly make big impact quickly. easy tweet sentence, little bit harder analyze data facts draw conclusion. studied yet can't get them. Again, solution cannot lockdown forever. People listening point need come realistic restrictions hault exponential growth. Honestly point need much information. AZ vaccine awful lot testing SA got decent results. 

The results small scale study obviously concerning, T-cell data encouraging considering means severe illness.

People panicked based really small study. results may end accurate certainly far early panic. Probably early even countries widespread vaccinations. Cases common young healthy illnesses fatalities far common among elderly, generally elderly vaccinated first.

I know getting attention media reports remarkable, cases falling almost everywhere. guess media can't get ""it's going get lot worse"" bandwagon.

I personally think widespread immunity starting effect, ""herd immunity"" on/off switch degree. surely parts world 30% even 50% people region exposed. like chain letters Ponzi schemes, can't exponential growth forever eventually run people. What's going SA right now? They're preferred vaccine rendered useless scramble. likely going happen US? think anyone really knows zero losing side bet really really bad (see SA).  Occupied exactly? Israelis live anymore. Occam's Razor unscientific? There's relationship Christmas, I'll give that, otherwise normal curve. Also, 10% population gotten vaccinated year really know saying sarcastically. propagated go 60 countries quickly becoming leading variant several European countries. Obviously telling people insufficient response. Wrong... Feb numbers coming little changes behaviour here. call Procurement Officer household. least others get vaccinated.  does. cov December pfizer late Jan. Vaccine felt like covid lite like one day. isnt face pain

This annoying thing well. Woman honestly probably hide pain much, much better men part period camps also we'll mocked labelled hysteretic. That's horrible lost entire year nobody would listen ""scientist"" reading comprehension poor. Believe whatever want believe, I'm sure know better experts. Interesting. kids 12+ age group, younger? Right. specific case, neutralizing titers certain threshold significantly increase/decrease vaccine efficacy. interesting. tad horrifying. can’t imagine patient. Nailed I’m glad it’s weigh deaths children education generation. think it’d big cross bear. think follows usual parental paradigm want kids safe know need life experiences functional human adults. God help kids poor sap make decision. point needs understood general public Three days moderate nausea here. Sucked nothing like Covid imagine. Lol sure. I’m sure wasn’t influenced China finding. exactly discover dispels notion came lab went intermediary species? Nothing 51 good health family also healthy honestly worried us one bit. think hoax anything know people ill, know friends-of-friends died. worry all, statistically I'm little risk many illnesses recovered fine.

People circle run gamut attitude even carefree, completely terrified refusing contact outside world. brother law unemployed watches TV day scared leave house, married couples know barely left houses, groceries delivered, etc.

I think people pretty exaggerated idea risks, [polls people think 15-25% chance dying get virus. young healthy people closer 0.1%. main risk people 65+ serious health conditions. friend tested positive, completely asymptomatic, except taking part vaccine trial back November contracts. Idk. one got covered insurance pharmacy gave one. know much time. Well help us prevent future pandemic happening last year show that, fact, dates useful all. unknown people assume worst case scenario definitively proven otherwise.  Ugh I’m supposed get astra zeneca one week government saying ""We see earliest date could remove travel recommendations April 15th"". red herring? Yes, mean ""We see April 15th end travel recommendations"", useful? Enjoy ban 

\- mod team Goal get everyone people vaccinated fast possible. Otherwise cars go restrictions ease go yo-yos indefinitely. Nothing fully recovers economy gimps like trying walk without leg. vaccinate everyone fully open economy get run. got Pfizer doses fine both. Sore arm that’s it. point, live country bet right horse buying huge amounts mRNA vaccines, end clearly sight think UK Identified variant told everyone. France promptly required tests UK side channel, UK put place. got second vaccine yesterday holy duck feel like got hit train Probably covid flew anyway. It’s consequence free states Hawaii not. 

Although understood nonzero number people *knew* covid going anyway, wasn’t found someone know realized prevalent must be. people sick people claim feel better it. ton selfish people there. It’s countries put every single covid case hospital community isolation center. literally cannot trust people right thing. 

As far planes, (empty) international flight months ago high covid low covid area plane’s ventilation flow rate unreal. maxed out, literally continual roar. cycling much quickly normal. way back low covid high covid area, (empty) planes ventilation dialed back again. yes essential flight. ""I'm talking anything"" exactly nothing brain talking like genius copying heard another idiot using completely unrelated generalizing fit feelings LOL. 35 classified obese, overweight. That's 25. We've ~10 8k total deaths, however think underlying condition. say minimize loss young souls, frank need come terms numbers soon decide community's interest open schools (ours hybrid mode since nearly start year). determine this? FREEDOM DIE ALTER APPLEBEES! !/s theological based simplicity says: ""Simpler explanations likely correct; avoid unnecessary improbable assumptions.""

C'am, i'm going anti-scientific route debatibg fucking joke, arrive year later, spend hour market, spent time hotel rooms, visited Chinese propaganda museum, found zero evidence origin virus, blaming frozen food tow Chinese line. Fuck Lol, there's vaccine 95% effectiveness that's yet available sitting telling us ""Just little longer"" nonsense?   cases dropping across world sudden? vaccines taking effect? scientist. China, sure accusing Chinese government. think spokespeople extra cautious, point delivering confusing message.

They also want unvaccinated people remain lockdown wear masks turn, guess want vaccinated people normal things leading spike cases. give cautious pessimistic guidance possible. big game trying manipulate people behavior want use worry fear. think there's data really conservative view assume worst. repeat:

Listen scientists, politicians media commentators.

You find definitely considered simplistic scenarios. many relationships biology linear   lottery. younger, unlikely symptoms vaccine damn virus. finally data this? They’re voting overwhelming people would. stupid. right, course. I'll fix error. don’t see problem relation vaccine passport? Sadly, *developed countries* close end developing nations lag behind leaving world middle pandemic. It’s almost like people take joy seeing bad behavior resulting consequences.

I’m happy guy died. still fucking moron helped validate morons. directly lead unnecessary deaths.

Don’t like it? Maybe shut fuck listened people know better. Instead touched hot stove. choose ignore Occam's Razor? goal prevent exponential growth vaccine place. Exponential growth hits hard causes problems, including overwhelming hospitals, killing people, maiming people generally bad time. can't undo starts.

[This AskScience thread explains well. relationship linear. So? almost perfectly COVID really hard lockdown March, April, May June 2020 thanks State Leaders also responsible health system states. states lockdowns strict leave homes radius unless work. 

Our federal government struggles run economy relies net migration growth/foreign $ stimulate economy, suffering significantly dont people moving here.

Many states (mine particular) significant tourism industry large part state economy struggling overseas border closures. effective vaccine needed industries survive.

Our wage subsidy (JobKeeper) ending late March '21 means many people start lose jobs cannot open overseas visitors need effective vaccine maintain industry. way dismissing tourism industries countries, however majority countries economy banked net migration tourism recipe disaster. Better convince neighbors get vaccinated. memory b cells produce antibodies. Totally believable. /s There's lab data shows ~6-7x increase antibodies required reach neutralisation SA variant Moderna/Pfizer vaccines test tube. there's actually evidence going work particularly well either. Moderna/Pfizer jabs induce stronger immune response Oxford jab, fair assumption efficacy slightly higher. much higher? knows. Pretty sure you’re one selfish unreasonable here. don’t think history judge “just wait two weeks/months/years” people kindly. tired ""experts worry"" articles. Yeah we're worried facts? Oh wow good hear. men die virus amazes we're Nothing bad upset - know missing lot time prior that? happens..people abuse time call nice days, pretty days things rather work need stuck want argue. thread stories/anecdotes almost daily. seen maybe 10-15 people say 2nd shot led 24-36 hours symptoms headache, fatigue, muscle soreness, etc. gone 2 days. educated guess, would think so; side effects felt would think they’d less strong, since body still reacting, takes bit longer. 

But I’m positive that. true, much likely campaign simply lied feeling, knowing people recover downplaying disease good way score political points.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* wonder that’s intentional specifically chosen (with good reason, IMO) use privilege cards result came pre-arrange findings given CCP. Let us forget team never given independence investigation. Think case I'm referring pandemic already going months. found outside packaging suggests workers loaded truck likely it. 

Wasn't sure guy replied saying found frozen foods lies he, like yourself, means *start* frozen food first place. seen much hopefully that's suggesting... Earth would plan trip April 1st? sorry wrote wrong. it. wanted light reading Well, there's also tens millions people parroting political disinformation meant minimize federal administration's mishandling. That's nice, dearie. trying get China without arrested. said weeks ago investigation would farce. Let's say I'm interested planning trip April 1st. go online see government saying foresee travel recommendation go least then. stop plans. Good information. they'd said knows known likely lifted Feb 15th, Mar 1st, something. do. 

Now, course problem people read saying pandemic definitely April 15th, plan trips April 16th. people understand uncertainties process treat promise. Flu deaths 90-99% lower year. supported may come frozen foods clear CCP narrative. lol. UN deeply flawed compromised CCP influence. analogy immune system makes separate antibodies one fingers, even though one fingers changes shape others still covered. memory B cells little trick produce little mutated versions mimick small changes fingers virus might make. mutated versions hang around background, encounter new kind finger make better fitting antibody for, jump action replacing ineffective antibody.

Also, kind non-issue me. city locked down. can’t anything. It’s 20 degrees outside. don’t care hundred morons Tampa point, long kee vaccinating. Finally one experts realistic. think continuing wear masks distance general public important since won’t know isn’t vaccinated group people fully vaccinated there’s reason taking precautions. Let’s real, Americans aren’t taking recommended precautions around family friends even without vaccinated. articles I’ve seen telling people still can’t hug loved ones see unmasked etc even though they’re fully vaccinated going backfire. Oh, right, brain fart. 2nd dose reaction, first arm soreness. Moderna. Holocaust denialism engage in? Sure - Yea I’m disputing survive frozen food. idea somehow got wuhan way even though detected anywhere else multiple reports warnings danger pandemic starting perfect zoological virus conditions China, especially wuhan. 

And CCP pointing America specifically frozen food import theory. It’s propaganda. don’t wear mask, do, fact, suck. I’m going run math whether it’s likely killed anyone, shouldn’t to. No, one look articles calculate percentages comparing confirmed covid deaths excess deaths. USA, UK, Spain, Italy, etc. underestimates, lower 50 %.

On hand, countries like Mexico, Peru, South Africa, Ecuador, Bolivia, even Poland (as well parts Indonesia mortality data available), show underestimate well 100 %, 200 %.

For many poorer countries, including vast majority Africa, data excess deaths simply unavailable, testing levels extremely low cases mentioned Zambia study [Kano Nigeria emerged. Yes comrade! dare people blame righteous ccp! Let’s make New Zealand pay!! Sending pea rona rest world. mean wtf New Zealand even contributed world anyway?? Lord rings? Psh hail xi!! Coronaviruses flu. true could br 6 years 5. Point conjecture go motions ""could be""...and fault thinking that. But, pure conjecture? Sounds fine short term questionable long term immunity.

Hopefully end pandemic booster shot plans becomes big issue. I'll even take bad bar bands! feel you. baby January premie. kept friends away. Grandparents only. March came changed. went back work parents watch baby stay daycare, nearly enough time need work. barely worth it. 

My son already afraid people. Everyone says wont remember grow it, I'm still worried inside time. like little bit larger size bifold wallet multiple highly effective vaccines. Wtf? That's convince the, want say idiots, kind idiots, actually take damn vaccine. Thankfully, virus plague sent God punish bad people. cold, indifferent biological phenomenon. would prefer people done Tampa, doubt enough change downward trajectory seeing. next fall/winter wave, hopefully small though. Next up, moon landing Honestly long get vulnerable people vaccinated, deaths hospitalizations drop flu level. understand pfizer vaccine designed make IgM IgG spike antibodies. test IgG spike antibodies Yep, 1 531 people state dying. job market bites! accepted escaping retail hold. think vaccination passports end much thing time get infrastructure place get rolled out, many people vaccinated concern hospitalizations deaths dropped far really necessary. 

There's also going ton pushback resistance idea first place, I'd surprised idea really takes all, outside maybe international travel settings, high risk healthcare, things like that. I'll gladly take 4 days chills, fever muscle aches 1 year Covid-19 immunity. even question mind. super bowl back go ... investigated found guilty... also distributed much better new government. Lol, believe random internet people say troll  Understood. want lecture get debate risk. know shoes info given, thinking would go something like Hey sis, I've vaccinated now, still 5% chance (or whatever number is) transmitting her. That's low, still possible. would like see eventually. would like proceed? Talk husband daughter let know want do. 

That's though. fair, quotes things consider. Mental health deteriorating, thats fact. Lockdowns, practice, arent working wont work, unless US government goes full authoritarian. 

One year ago hopeful would able erradicate it, thats going happen. get comfortable idea. almost like learning new information leads forming new opinions. Cuomo politician Politik, probably thinks best way re-election opening up.

Specially anyone, even therapists trained proffessionals tell ""hang there, get better summer back normal fall"". Thats fucking least 8 months, youve already year.

Best case scenario people actually start wearing masks get current vaccine. Covax formed provide vaccines vulnerable  Yeah would come somewhere appropriate animals kicked Wuhan seems unlikely. even impressive that: age groups death common, penetration much higher.

Viruses need spread continue exist. general, viruses inside dead body spread limited amount body buried cremated. Viruses quickly make ill find harder spread lie sick bed.

Others get lot worse though. point every 1 encouraging thing guy says like quoted, probably says 10 like quoted. 


No, I'm going spend morning looking Fauci quotes back said, anecdotal. talking national program--look big picture. 600k people going dead died covid exceeded death cancer heart disease--its exceeded two largest causes death America. virus that's easily spread without mitigation. 600k could easily gone millions anything.

And perspective think what's going said 10-20 years line. I'm convinced viewed catastrophic loss American lives tragedy unique shame American history. Yes know everyone suffered even die, included. bigger picture indeed national disaster respond certain way. There's easy answers clear way go--people going get hurt matter what. I'm glad I'm making decisions taking responsibility them. need 100% herd immunity.

Cases drop reasons besides vaccination, including people gathering Christmas anymore, things get really bad, people make behavioral changes avoid getting infected (as we've seen previous waves well prior vaccinations).  Which, personally, think unwise. *not* effective South African variant, effective preventing disease still appears pretty damn effective keeping people dying.

It seems like person talking West Coast variant, seemingly outcompeting previous strain, since went one person point half LA's cases now. Nah, I'm vacation right now. acting pandemic like never happened before. countries might take 2024 get enough vaccines, practical keep borders closed require mandatory quarantines.  *will* following strides mass vaccination.

By April 1, anyone who's real risk dying Covid given, offered, vaccine. 1000% did. terrorist attack enemy bring Donald Trump. sure aren’t gearing war right now. That's we've finally waiting for!!! That's trying get people get vaccinated. 70% unreasonable goal, 85% literally impossible considering right vaccinate 78% americans 22% Americans &lt;16.  Absolutely; data may available and/or need see happens immunity established.

Anyway, deaths 100% prevented clinical trial, people vulnerable age group trial. Hell, mortality rate age 95 far 3% per month (life expectancy three years). going take 40 years vaccinate everyone. Many countries took virus seriously back normal months now. Wuhan wet market tested animals. covid them. Preach brother! Preach! nice visualization lot people relate to. live somewhere cold, winter dragon breath works too.

Sometimes even divider smoking non. hard believe ever concept. Yeah i'd love 3% data too. I'm 6 days post second shot scared shitless still go 2 weeks passed stories people infected 1 dose shortly second. kids' school activities. Fall festival? Cancelled. Christmas party? Cancelled.

Who says people care? care. trying keep people locked even vaccines widely available terrible way need pit every effort eliminating virus.

We need vaccinate people, need isolate cannot vaccinate, need develop treatments. social distancing continue 2 years more. seems incredibly unlikely could get 85% adult population get vaccine. Even 70% would quite impressive feat. Realistically we'll plateau vaccinations lower percentages range. Well. somebody heartbroken...

Even general herd immunity still localized outbreaks. question china originating country.

[Globally joke seems strawman. guarantee CDC recommend bars open full capacity right away. initial comment said agree recommendations relax vacinees, changing mask requirements public gathering size anything creates incentive separate public spaces people vaccinated versus people end knee-capping vaccination effort public health effort.

That sounds like slippery slope fallacy me. late this. 

If anything, empower anti-vaxxers; *""See, telling truth silenced!! FREEDOM!!""* joke horror stories I've heard par flu? correct? anyone else concerned implication 3% died vaccinated? think hard ignore 30% people already achieved immunity infection cases/hospitalizations/deaths fall low levels lot sooner 70-85% population vaccinated.

I don’t big hopes suddenly becoming reasonable helpful, still think saying something obvious “why would get vaccine get back normal” progress. I'd surprised Super Bowl parties noticeable effect. thought a) travel town Super Bowl typically b) people holding/attending Super Bowl parties likely terribly cautious rest pandemic. Super Bowl parties likely attended either group that's mostly immune-by-infection COVID hit yet, would worked way soon enough Super Bowl Super Bowl. change said all. 136 infections week hundreds thousands people low number. Well should, hero, earn right wear cape without looking like crazy person. dad Med school LLU, great institution Cases. Yes, summer vacations next 40 years!!

Except 40 years I’ll 80 therefore either dead near death, leaving question spent half life inside watching Netflix never seeing friends family person. Comparing effects vaccine covid definitely depends severity disease someone had. 

I got first dose 3 days clearing isolation severe case Covid. told going suck, did, feel like covid (although amount symptom overlap). felt like worst flu I've ever lasted couple days, comparison hell went covid. talked people moderate cases, way described experience sound lot like first dose. severe case whole different ballpark.

It certainly share *some* symptoms, fatigue, soreness, fever, etc. course none severe breathing issues, open sores mouth, constant leg cramps, hallucinations, random infections, etc battled covid!

This disease chaotic affects people differently...
I'd hate someone severe case scared away vaccine expect feel like went disease.

First dose knocked back butt sure, agree folks it, take next day off! 

But also know dose, whole time smiling telling wife still felt 1000% better point experience covid. Absolutely regrets, went back knowing now, I'd without second thought. question many true positive cases actually counted.  
Israel likely caught cases due widely available testing, low cost healthcare, better contact tracing, govt support need take tested positive/were contact people tested positive. 
I suppose they've missed quite cases too. smaller fraction. question conspiracy theorists piece evidence would actually get give completely based emotion twisted hope fantasies? put little piece scotch tape writing card protect - bifold tends rub it. would really like read this, got source? read actual statistics, stay away articles. statistics paint far less scary picture article will.

Yup, life's short lies games. Child abuse bout no? get you’re saying, someone who’s end line get vaccinated, can’t muster much sympathy. least vaccinated people fly planes, eat restaurants, go friends’ houses etc, things perfectly allowed places advisable don’t vaccine yet. really shouldn't. things taken seriously, called hoax. potential destroy lives. everything power prevent next one. requires bit fear mongering, I'm ok it. 🥅➡️➡️➡️➡️➡️🥅 let vaccination metric?

They love hosting family unfortunately, they've missed Thanksgiving Christmas already. turn Ohio itching get vaccinated hopefully week. get vaccinated week next rest family easter year.

As I'm really place extreme jealousy right now. brother father moderna trial got vaccines, mother nurse got second dose late january. tough clearly itching start really going enjoying life holding back thread US. worry AZ.

J&amp;J running ENSEMBLE II. double dosing strategy may prove effective.

Data regarding efficacy death severe disease shown better mild sickness. even 60% effective mild symptoms, 90%+ efficacy death could still possible

We also boosters developed. 

I guess I'm worried going back square 1. even back multiple pegs. We've got lot tools March see likely E484K going drive us back restrictions. Proof? think least plot roadmap returning back pre pandemic life. key vaccine vs new variants. Good news coronaviruses whole don’t mutate quickly flu viruses. Time essence though Well, much disinformation bullshit going (in sub thread) matter anyone says. people believe it, won't. 

There proof ever accepted people.   large gulf ""everyone isolated everyone else entire year"" ""bannahbop like people criticized them."" idea 3 4 people continue wear masks out, VIRUS STOPS SIGNIFICANTLY SPREADING!, laughably incorrect I'm embarrassed anyone would willing claim it. I'm jealous Tell sister school year friends still college zoom schooling. 100% agree, least people acknowledging horrible effects hamfisted measures including lockdowns shutdowns. performer Disney World got laid off. ok. end world. planning staying Disney forever anyways. *fuck* wanted go terms. worked since March parks first closed, I've mostly gotten it. every while, memory hits I'm supposed creating magic right now. Fuck 2020. Well least know lockdowns work variant. Along vaccines warmer weather coming there’s probably huge need worry. article doesn’t claim are. read it? exactly viruses work. Ebbs flows inevitable, often exacerbated behavioral elements. That’s experts speak often “waves”. holidays caused huge spike coming peak infections.  one “heartwarming: 8 year old child works overtime pay brother’s surgery” type stories. It’s heartwarming, it’s sad type thing happen first place. Valid question somehow never seems appear news.

Every newspaper quick give facts X% protection vaccine Z variant...

But studies natural immunity? Fauci really good reading tea leaves. saw negative impact existing narrative around post-vaccine life people going far less willing take vaccine hope return normalcy. definitely things like Fauci experts, Fauci master public relations messaging...he knew here. one alleging developed COVID-19 lab. talking about? call bs Go Trust interesting doc. look money. ""These guys""? WHO? Gay not. orgy, together.

Just honest hubby! So, wet markets still closed?  Teachers greater risk average expand you’re referring to? think 2 hour ride plane cabin may comparable dining indoors 90 minutes without mask, activities completely different category risk grocery shopping mask on. think Biden could done level change quickly, especially drop began took office? It’s narrative it’s current recommended advise based evidence.

I'm American assume teachers considered ""Other essential workers""? order teachers get vaccine earlier, another group need later. healthy teachers think vaccine ""People ages 65-74"" ""People ages 16-64 high-risk conditions""?  Y'all seen snowboarders aint slopes?

While antibodies necessarily work well, every chance T-cell immunity sufficient reduce chance life-threatening illness death. enough long term, lower risk death lower transmission induced widespread vaccination (not zero, significantly less) mean lighter touch restrictions achieve protection. perception personally it’s major detractor mental health choose seeing friends family trying feel like life somewhat normal criticized called selfish peers taking advantage “freedoms” left. That's poor choice families. doubt kids make 330m people. happens AstraZeneca? Going bin?

Idaho - can’t even get approved it. great need get teachers want vaccine. know couple teachers Arizona refuse get it. “Change like us miserable” also comic book villain style thinking. idea everyone try like everyone else fit sick. don’t see you’ll catch virus going snowboarding. never likely, door never closed theory. China lacks transparency. every step along way China insist controlling investigation. real evidence, China would never let see light day. Eh family fine thankfully worry mental health own. Me? super great. talk requiring negative covid test fly domestically really down. Thankfully I’m position afford rapid OTC tests know many spend every last dime plane tickets trips won’t able afford even go. feel like government constantly looking way isolate compartmentalize stop people anything working sitting front screens.

a lot people scoff say ""well, can't much baby anyways"" yeah, like we'd take baby clubbing. experience first time parents shitty. i'm one want spotlight center attention. but, we're new parents! exciting! love son, sweet want share joy. FaceTime. 

and, top that, parents right-wing conspiracy nuts chose love DJT relationship son first six months life. so, yeah. cool lol. God, I'd love politician fact they've changed mind even admit making mistake. U.S. political system joke. E484K mutation variants? idea majority vaccinated protect even small percentage cases (if transmission stopped ou reduced least, we're yet see that). would really easy defeat virus internally. Make positivites quarantine R plummets. R reaches 1 would high already Especially considering world probably need re-vaccinated least 2-3 years.

We learned last year live COVID.  Waiting really option. edited headline pessimistic enough.

Everything click Spread still mostly driven non-vaccinated people, difficult predict variant become dominant. still achieve R0 1 mixture vaccines, like AZ's vaccine guaranteed useless like people insinuating. I’m hearing you, you’re hearing me. Also, we’re speculating, cheers. “Back normal” means masks social distancing. Aside small handful island nations, we’re really seeing higher compliance measures consequently much lower rates infection death, normality. example, Taiwan “normal” sense almost local cases nearly businesses open, everyone still wearing mask there. That’s normal. Hmm, seems might trend here. \*looks summer BLM protests\*

In words, ZeroCovid happening. We'll develop strategies living persistent occurrence, similar cold/flu. Next summer different. vaccines people much opposed restrictions last summer. agree, someone claiming “follow science/numbers,” Cuomo punishing New Yorkers happening Florida. think virus made lab. I'm seeing evidence outside circumstantial coincidences seem strong enough. Everything I've seen leads believe virus evolved naturally.

Then again, “thread locked wishing death harm people” like mods typed sentence so... yeah. believe Lab Leak theory means either 1. made lab got 2. studied lab found elsewhere got out. 

Your entire first paragraph true( think almost definitely is) still line lab leak. 

Isn’t lab known studying Covid strains across country? Seems feasibly one couldn’t accidentally exposed staff, especially considered chinas track record experimentation. death likely counted infection. can't adjust positivity rate across countries. even did, I'm sure Israel's rate far lower united States. Well restrictions already lifting places Incorrect. Studies informs us ""hidden"" cases officially recorded, even then, truly poorly-conducted studies that. studies use determines outcome.

You need studies know correct numbers enter calculator. Orange County, North Carolina (home UNC Chapel Hill, Tar Heels) 2%, positive testing rate, lowest county somehow, despite college kids college things, positive testing rate county (where college students make large part population) lowest state.  mean Lori Lightfoot one step away forcing go restaurant gunpoint juncture Really? checking sub every day?

Because idea going endemic like happened Spanish flu (the modern world still deals variants it) pretty commonplace sub. I’m house sitting week couple flew Wyoming skiing week. got 2nd shot since they’re surgical field 2 weeks ago. know lot people aren’t vaccinated all. Ski resorts seem embracing putting heaters outside set distanced seating areas drinks food. Everyone I’ve seen slopes looks happy there! say it! possibly disagree more. 


I think reaction always optimal. There's lots ways would criticize it. size threat size reaction definitely line. got second dose modern week ago. basically hangover me. Fatigue, headache. arm hurt first shot, debilitating. 

That said, believe COVID beginning pandemic (travelled extensively work, meeting 50 people end February enclosed space, numerous people caught bad respiratory infection, woke days later said wife felt like drowning, worst illness life), it’s possible lesser set side effects prior illness, knows. fun. Travel involved minuscule proportion covid infections, vaccines, risk even lower. love travelling too! Assuming 30% Americans infected, bold estimate, assuming infected provides similar protection getting one shot vaccine, Israel still slightly immune us. NEWS: White House told governors Pfizer going able deliver 50 million doses quarter originally promised, per people I've never known single person diseases got vaccinated kids. Yes, entirely eliminated, what? flu right example use able evade vaccines far quickly diseases. roll world wide vaccination effort COVID-19 effectively eliminated there's sane reason end like flu killing 500,000 people year. Hopefully, it’ll end like every social movement stops trendy. People quietly stop supporting. Remember, it’s virtue signaling plenty people. people care now. people thing that's stopping going restaurants, concerts, clubs, gyms, open. people, reason they're wearing masks stores let inside otherwise. Policy essentially thing keeping pandemic caution place. really hope trend continue. mental health really shit bed last months feeling hopeless pandemic. asked around family, stepmother second Moderna shot reported sore arm. said two coworkers reported feeling feverish. even then, start getting things control easy adapt MRNA new variants. We're going dealing years, hopefully encounter new variant produce tens millions doses get arms couple months. cases, got positivity rate used adjust.

With deaths? There's lot variability there. said change suits personality? put words mouth. said many people feel comfortable many consider ""normal"" society. normal them. cope to. try change all. Unless think COVID Society Recluses conspiracy keep everyone restricted fun socially. Talk Austin Powers style villainry... Lol, stupid. accuracy less mortality rate. Oh wow! cool-sounding term pandemic-born babies? yet? Great parents husband almost woods. Atleast there's light end tunnel! Might vaccine still possibility large re-outbreak, even larger previous waves, seen actual re-outbreak occurred? China would reveal early positive cases , would go back post Morten test people vaccinated then. That's big factor. doubt that's real cause. Israel vaccinated 5x much population us, drop larger. think vaccine effect take little longer kick in. guess drop we're seeing due natural immunity, maybe covid seasonal thing season winding down. betting favorites Nobel Prizes earlier pandemic. would made careers. 

Now worst major vaccines. 

So release optimistic statements. unusual - anybody would do. Since Nymag New Yorker? Also scientists article suggested needed investigation got it. Slash mortality, make “normal” illness world better place get back it. 

A lot focus variant vaccine efficacy pointed preventing mild disease, don’t need worry mild disease (relatively) think real easy talk big much love restrictions choice. things open up, people go out. Good God, Fauci finally said something that's somewhat critical overly cautious. I'm really happy this, he's obviously smart President Biden seems taking seriously, he's talking relaxing likely manifest policy soon.  never said that! study affects vitamin covid responded could link 50 studies showing otherwise. 

I'm taking offer show vitamin D, living healthy lifestyle, determining factor covid transmission symptom severity! 

Btw, ""misinformation"", ""disinformation""! 

But knew that! put mandate top priority instead states currently doing. could possibly get near end March. I'm expecting mid March get 40-50k per day average. Knooooow. people rise up... premiums, deductibles, copays out-of-pocket costs go someone's mortgage payment per month?! breaking point. Ok, trust regarding whether began lab not? Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

Last passover lot families gathered illegaly holiday despite lockdown. vaccinate people then, passover 100% bring another infection wave. people 2 months say ""Why nobody want vaccine?"" entire idea people optionally ""avoid"" Covid rest society engages behavior spreads long proven false. increase spread people allowed get vaccinated, gets people diligently waiting vaccine too. Id believe much would ccp... Oh wait... also investigated 1977 Russian Flu, concluded Laboratory contamination excluded laboratories concerned either never kept H1N1 virus worked long later studies showed virus near-identical strain 1950, without expected mutations occurred virus circulating undetected human animal host 20-30 years. Back lab escapes polarizing political topic, scientific consensus sufficiently favor lab origin NEJM--which highest impact factor medical journal--casually reemergence probably accidental release laboratory source setting waning population immunity H1 N1 funny see people claiming there's precedent lab accident start pandemic. likely precedent that, there's also precedent exclude possibility time. People terribly afraid believing disinformation online? Idk. I'm sorry Seulement la rheume 😝 Unfortunately, that’s true many states. WI, example, don’t expect offer vaccines people 65 medical conditions end April even May Hmm maybe people haven’t gotten vaccine yet continue cautious do, try keep everyone else miserable well?  Computer says They're talking honor system. Sorry, clear work well society. respect it, think close family friends able police themselves. abused.

That said, nothing technically stopping people gathering already facilities encourage mass gatherings, closed. hindsight, really matter? People despite suggested recommendations. test more, going cases. /S read article, nothing protests everything politics. You’ve got think, pandemic started beginning 2020...we 2021. 

Don’t know everyone else, feel time flying fast.  Look prisons - less efficient vs public. Costs incarceration way up. year complete hell understand frustration. hate want normal life ASAP. data evidence look back help us truly understand impact various restrictions. downsides lockdowns become apparent time goes on. 

That said, effective vaccine much sooner expected taking advantage this. let at-risk population gain immunity process instantaneous. keep mind lag two doses couple weeks wait second dose efficacy kick in. Giving people chance also help feel comfortable rejoining society let rip get life. ""bloodlust"" lmao guy genghis khan relax Sure...yeppers! Ok....right ppl actually buy shit believe it...ugh many parents screwed up... praise tooth fairy! Yeah I'm also late 20s bet cohort feeling way. Oh god, read headline “WERE vaccinated” almost stroke. 

This good news. thing Fauci, people already way irresponsible based vaccine roll out. think Fauci knows normal group vaccinated people, says that, even higher percent people (who aren’t vaccinated, like group 5 friends, 1 vaccinated) start getting together unsafe way. think Fauci choice preach cautious anything like 50% people already cautious enough can’t afford give indication less cautious right now. Thank you. Nevermind states certain tiers restriction based around severity case levels state.

New York anything like this, least restaurants. open governor feels like it, whatever capacity feels like.

Luckily decided allow us 25% indoor dining starting Friday, least we're making progress! 🧢 limited data that. Almost certainly does, know much yet. think Israel AZ sime preliminary data.

Edit: Biden ran platform something Covid. Reality there’s huge amount actual things do. States drive policy. Vaccines going large driven manufacturers states, high level trouble shooting role fed. So, areas left basically areas direct federal control, like planes. mass amounts Covid theater directed disproportionately areas say “did” something. Regardless thing helpful necessary. told 1% chance fatal car accident wear seat belt, won’t wear seat belt? that's good. hope see more. that, fine. dad got first moderna shot 5 days ago soreness warmth injection site. alternative say soon vaccinated go back pre-covid behavior. bar covid hotspot people heard ""go back pre-covid behavior"" they're willing lie order that. mean something like 50% french population refused vaccination. doesn’t bode well.

Shit needs legally enforced somehow HIGHLY suggested sort normal life: need vaccination. persistent trolling disinformation, impressive 

Ok, fine, concede. We'll go take. Vitamin beneficial effect immune function, contrary current scientific knowledge I’m thinking worst case scenario, end year don’t get back full “normal”, restrictions left masks large gatherings (I.e sports playing without fans, packed venues/in-studio audiences).

Basically Canada UK last summer. “Russia consider delivery self-developed vaccine Sputnik V European Union possible May June. head State Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Kirill Dmitriyev, said Russian state television Rossiya 24 Tuesday. ""The big deliveries EU possible mass vaccinations Russia finished.""” Yup - absolute bullshit. insurance classifies Tier 3 - basically going pay all. 

1 inhaler cost 300-some bucks last time. Luckily rarely use it, make one last LONG time...but good god. daily need it?? would make angry. 

How *any* medication helps BREATH fully paid for....I even know insurance exists. I'm guessing want quote picked apart really meaning entire point Fauci Daughter vaccinated behaving give vice versa. behaving way that's policy promoted ""You still need 14 day quarantine even though vaccinated""

So maybe someone can't find direct quote right person saying general climate right think got vaccine kill grandma try go back normal. virus isolated ? Koch’s postulates ? Yea enough freaking potential unknown future possibilities

When current wave subsides, everyone wants vaccine gets one, it’s time move case numbers actually show something worry  True, however majority Canada's vaccination efforts gone towards care homes/health care workers possible impact made massive protests US cities summer weren't. Oh, right, protesting ""right"" thing OK article about. Read hard-hit Toronto, instance, number new nursing home outbreaks “way down,” homes existing outbreaks, new cases seem stop 21 days residents received first vaccine dose There's always another reason. Even though majority risk ability receive vaccine move everyone needs ability receive vaccine. Since know risk vaccinated obvious hospitalizations decline even removing restrictions. March 32nd? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically.

Bloodlust? Fuck's sake, think little inflammatory? welcome continue staying home want. People going flushed homes like animals hunting season open back up. worry,
When idiot anti vax ""covidiots"" realize can't fly, go gym, go vacation enter movies without ""green passport"", they'll get covid long line vax. Idiots. time birthday :D

Best gift ever Hoping back normal time throw big Toyotathon party!  tell vaccine reduces infectious period eliminate it. Thus confined space plane long periods time understand extra caution herd immunity via vaccination hit. see things rolled back percent vaccinated climbs. ""More 97% recent deaths people vaccinated"" meaningless without knowing % population vaccinated.

2 months ago 100% deaths people vaccinated. course going down... elections determined virus didnt come lab Wuhan China... 2 months covid another cold.... ways? feel like ways media fear mongering late way harm good. Kinda disappointed CNN others.. Spray cigarette perfume on. advisories hearing wrong. based flat supply vaccine. supply actually increasing significantly every week. 

They trying control expectations real. live Germany never depressed life last couple months, false promises early vaccines broke heart, still say trying make weird point. well fucked up, hence suffering, soon we'll better again. living country even worse statistics... even important? Merkel (who fact human) better leaders that's fact. Also, great many Germans responsible pandemic, (and our) suffering Lockdown Bogeyman causing serious derangement. Folks created parody governors they're cackling villains want Forever Lockdown.

Nevermind states certain tiers restriction based around severity case levels state.

As cases/hospitalizations drop, restrictions ease. baked system. Wow, SEVENTY PERCENT happening. Get head, nearing 10% right reach 40% whole bottom falling demand problem. gonna plummet like turned emergency already Israel find people get vaccinated hit 40% first shots administered population.. April max turns setting appointments begging public get vaccinated. can’t wait get vaccinated know almost one wants vaccine... actually take thay back, know one person, rest flat said arent getting actively tried dissuade getting it. people Tennessee, Florida, North Carolina, Atlanta local thing either possibly regional thing.

Vaccinations normalcy way get this. You’re acting like lip fillers kind extreme surgery they’re not. someone wants get them, fine? It’s increase confidence change look, like hair dye makeup indeed... you, 40 yo man? Hello Sweden here, confirm 2020 felt like living turntable. even sure way it’s spinning point. 

at least don’t anti-lockdown protests, that’s something. messaging already ruined prospects compliance many, seriously doubt shift stage significant enough affect decisions vast majority group. School closures suck mountain debt lack public services future real killer. kids deal levels austerity would scare fuck millennials. know results Phase 3. data everyone see. Well 2 months ago 100% deaths people vaccinated. Lol Biden hasn’t even office 3 weeks numbers improving. Really highlights tremendous ineptitude apathy Trump administration. definitely several congresspeople got sick think many us right you. fucking insane established soon tests became available. Gold comment DeezNeezuts. come here. Yeah, received 2nd dose yesterday. 12 hours fever, chills, headache. Woke today feel bit better. Dude. year masks still ""controversial"" US sizable portion hell bent they're Communism. 

No way anyone US wear public end summer year. one.  No, vaccinations widespread enough threat hospitals overrun thing anymore. COVID black swan event, must never anything like again. Unless something contagious deadly pops wet market.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  I'd imagine regulatory hurdles similar making new flu vaccine every year.  think likelihood vaccines preventing covid deaths low. trial data, however, shows single person died covid vaccinated. Stating fact lie. angry wrong people Fauci masking distancing vaccination: 

“But believe that's going change,"" Fauci said. ""We're talking level CDC.”

""I'm doubly vaccinated. daughter doubly vaccinated. last time tried come home, go quarantine 14 days get tested,"" said. ""It big, big deal finally see daughter room. think that's going change.""
""**What's reason get vaccinated first place, want get normal?**” said.

FINALLY. Common sense prevailing. feels like huge weight shoulders. government need throw immense resources it

And probably wont. Look long took us get $1200. hate pessimist, mental health never issue government thought important enough tackle. hope I'm wrong I'm fully expecting nothing mental health care change. kids certainly affected years future, ""lost generation"" bit stretch. end line extremely unlikely suffer serious COVID negative effects. 

You totally free fly planes, eat restaurants, go friends’ houses etc, know? oligospermia = reduced numbers sperm

azoospermia = sperm

oligo-crypto-azoospermia = reduced virtually sperm vaccine available everyone (well +6 weeks double dose) reason restrictions. then, OK. Well. really fucked everyone huh. I'm sure want public health officials lying get things. Lack energy, tiredness, mild headache. Damn even get read reoly. Gone seconds notification. Way go mods! Here's trophy 🏆  wasn’t AstraZeneca. also sanofi Pasteur powerful state backer EU. Neither vaccine candidates worked out. Well yeah that's pitch public health nuts claim need wear masks socially distant even vaccine widely available.  


Man people feel like plot lost google covid19 look news headlines now. sub missing much. check longer rely it. ZeroCOVIDers sub think restrictions last late 2021....its hilarious...

If think getting massive restrictions beyond summer, probably wake up. I'm saying neither better other. long exists one protection against, immaterial many others are. Sunflowers incredible sources folic acid. 100 g kernels contains 227 µg folic acid, 37% recommended daily intake. Folic acid essential DNA synthesis. given anticipant mothers peri-conceptional period, may prevent neural tube defects baby. care. They're getting paid either way. cares you? really. 

The US lot natural immunity Israel holidays, too, yet cases skyrocketed US. 

Clearly, factors, especially people behaving. did, variants spanish flu still around. severity different fro ordinary flu, though, since mutations tended make virus less lethal people pre-existing immunity.

Most likely, thing happen covid. always around, enough population immunity built severe flu cold, even mutates enough cause significant amount reinfections. like people arent happy middle seat empty ""normalcy"" anyway. Variants aren’t gonna shit, dismay media. obvious 'what lab leak?' theory convoluted. utterly mundane.

Guy traps bat sells contact sells world's expert studying bat viruses bat put cage bats virus rounds bats handling/decontamination mistake anyone handled, fed, cleaned walks lab goes buy dinner local market.

I'm saying that's happened. 

It's quite plausible mundane way bat remote cave find way middle city, remain skeptical motives people continually refuse entertain even remotely plausible, instead appear determined explore far complex theories. 

If find high amount radiation laying around ground, right next reactor, first theory chase going one unique natural confluence pushed ground.

No, first going looking holes reactor. right fucking there. likely place came *there*. question get *there* *here*. get work investigating obvious possibility prove **rule out.**

Having head investigator swear black blue likely emerged faraway deposit travelled naturally along underground river leeched sunflowers seems really fucking shady.

It absolutely truth, everyone's going eyebrows raised asking proof. Relevant starting plummet quickly. isn’t vaccines (yet). may starting see combination seasonality side likely seeing herd effects kick in. SCHOOLS!   98 year old grandmother asymptomatic case. weird. evidence this. Many clinical participants got pregnant trial. truly believed would never take medicine ever. literally zero reason believe would happen extremely paranoid anti vax nonsense. shouldn’t elect anti-Semitic terrorists office (who subsequently suspend future elections like Hamas did). Public health isn’t going priority them. Nope vaccinations. 

Remember, cases dropped previous surges even single person vaccinated. goes cycles people alter behavior, etc. Anyone still trusting guys? important, humans avoid disturbing wildlife habitats, keep respectful distance wild animals.

Good luck that. don’t want media lmao [nature magazine disproves asymptomatic spread likely much lower 1/100th. comments make feel crazy. like there's two subreddits one lol. daily thread mostly good discussion comments individual posts get really cynical depressing, bad news gets downvoted here

Seriously? Maybe ""bad news"" usually overblown nonsense point pandemic lol  Sometimes travel necessary. suggested reasonable alternative complain? Dude everyone likes fucking party. coronavirusuk sub link molecular biologiest twitter feed.

The counter argument AZ vaccine still provoke cell response, resulting mild covid.

Still good update booster anyway. “Anyone don’t like right Mao deserves die enjoy free-moving human meaningful relationships purpose world” seems reason Redditors enjoy seeing people die. No, havent. assume vaccines provide sterilizing immunity? 95% efficacy probably overwhelming sterilizing immunity vaccines work. Yeah people eager blame experts McConnell likely could’ve much generous stimulus maybe everyone could’ve actually stayed home essentially assume happen course summer. People underlying conditions died covid, people died vaccine died underlying conditions. Funny works... many factors determine changes rate infection besides vaccinations. 

For example, cases tend go weeks month ""record deaths"" headlines. People alter behavior enough change rate infection. article engineered viruses include full set spike mutations found [U.K.] [South African] variants,” researchers said.

This test specific mutations, actual Uk SA variants. did. Parts still around. course also don’t know potential long term effects adenovirus medical treatment ever invented. also don’t know 5-10 year effects covid. guess covid far damage cells mRNA doesn’t even enter nucleus cell. top little evidence vaccine injuries occuring two months recidving them. We’re 8 months testing zero evidence even minor long short term effects that’s almost 100 million doses. Every medical intervention risk risk long term injury likely far higher vaccine extremely promising safety data. getting downvoted Jesus CHO said this? Color surprised. ""You disagree must trolling"" lmao bro wonder anyone life respect all? protection infection higher one vaccines (Pfizer-Moderna). documented several studies generally also dogma virology.
I'd rather prefer antibodies immune system vaccine additionally due shortage worldwide better leave jab someone virus. Stop spreading anti-vax misinformation. want take vaccine, don't. think crazy choice. stop spreading dangerous misinformation extend pandemic seems like coronavirus follows hard-coded evolutionary path mutations seem develop independent across world. fact virus develops escape routes antibodies worrisome, 'bright' side may able predict mutation path virus going take. Besides really hope virus mutates 'wrong' way becomes super contagious, gives cold-like symptoms. text book?

This talking vaccines, could applied people test positive covid. Gold spoke rallies leading storming Capitol, inciting fear vaccine claiming COVID-19 non-lethal. stated people must comply taking ""an experimental, biological agent deceptively named vaccine."" agree, far likely reason. UN harping years habitat encroachment intensive farming lead pandemic.

But flip side, it’s worrying even considering farcical “it came another country frozen food” theory. That’s infinitesimally unlikely scenario. ridiculous theories could include “migrating bird dropped covid infected acorn wet market”. Oh great, actually lowering cutoff income better file taxes last deadline spread anti-vax misinformation. serious flare use 6 puffs day pulmicort. taper.

This happened healthcare.gov rollout well. consulting space butts seats bill hours vs anything useful. always true? didn’t see “prophet” bio point, doubt statistics make Newsom budge anything. good numbers. Yeah, I've fond trusted word mouth since ran [racist AF] re-election campaign ""רק ליברמן מבין ערבית"" [""Only Lieberman understands Arabic""] tagline. Man probably speak lick Arabic lol. weird way state statistics. even bother reading headline, let alone actual article. COVID doesn’t kill many younger people, definitely long term effects significant portion cases. particular know kills neurons, many people report ongoing “brain fog” COVID.

Now whether avoiding worth huge economic damage people fair question, think it’s definitely still worth inconvenience wearing masks help get case count roll vaccine everyone.

I think may underestimated much economic damage caused virus rather restrictions. Many many people go eat aren’t vaccinated virus still raging even restaurants open. Unless purposely cough someone, yes is. person stay home? course, someone out, go purposely coughing sneezing someone, getting sick one unfortunate things deal with. That's way always been, doubt clutching pearls last year. think truth somewhere two comments. absolutely 100% responsible improvements, also 100% done nothing. done meaningful shit helpful. Wrong. lab studying coronaviruses time first outbreak. confirmed time time again. approach would prolong pandemic removing best incentive get vaccine, resuming normal life. escape mutation E484K also brazillian variant cases UK  think best analogy cars. Allowing people drive cars kills people. Raising speed limits kills people. society decided driving cars 70 mph worth tens thousands deaths causes. Likewise, society probably decide allowing people leave houses fun social contact months earlier worth deaths causes matter personal responsibility. also easy way vaccinate large number people. 

People shots show chool schedule ddya, stab, go next school. supermarkets provided better PPE workers, transmission work might much less likely, early vaccination would less necessary.

We'll take anything prevent people dying mRNA may never available general public Palestinians aren’t citizens vaccinating Israeli citizen resident. Palestinians actually health authority. That's fine dandy respect decision. social anxiety respiratory issues, find change social dynamic welcoming. respect choice, would hope respect mine. That's see happening. hip virtue signal staying eff home wearing mask near future.

Virtue signaling going away anytime soon, least anymore. parents 1st shot 2nd yet. vaccinated I'll sure go see I'm going let us restrictions we're looking MUCH better general. real life, express concerns days public health say anything “I’m fully committed staying home years necessary”, 50% people respond “so ok people dying?”

It’s really “your us us” issue many people makes conversation largely impossible. Same. would almost entirely social media reddit able converse places without MSM-induced herd mentality helps keep sanity levels high now. can’t wait free all. correct. people essential jobs couldnt anything avoid virus. comment didnt really imply people bad habits got affected. said people bad habits got it, condescending. least, think intent people likely die got vaccinated people roaming around without care already it. people virus could infect ones could isolate because
1) jobs let it
2) taking advantage ability isolate it. 
So virus running stream since cant find many hosts. I've see comments sub people cant understand everyone stay home still survive, didnt think that. completely obvious  dont problem this.

I've really good wearing mask would wear one vaccination levels good I'm vaccinated? Hell no.  thought trails counted differently least SinoVac SinoVac counted everyone beginning end whereas manufacturers counted people starting second shot. anyone got sick protection period kicks counted certain trials. sure applicable CanSino though. feel assaulted.

He understands well people choosing die home: 49-year-old daughter succumbed coronavirus Christmas Springfield hospital, family got phone updates condition deteriorated.

""The separation part really rough, rough rough,"" said Simmons. ""My daughter went hospital saw glass put ventilator, never saw died.""

Across country, terminally ill patients — COVID-19 diseases — making similar decisions dying home rather face terrifying scenario saying farewell loved ones behind glass video calls.

""What seeing COVID certainly patients want stay home,"" said Judi Lund Person, vice president regulatory compliance National Hospice Palliative Care Organization. ""They want go hospital. want go nursing home.""

National hospice organizations reporting facilities seeing double-digit percentage increases number patients cared home.

The phenomenon played Carroll Hospice Westminster, Maryland, seen 30% 40% spike demand home-based care, said executive director Regina Bodnar. said avoiding nursing homes coronavirus risks biggest factor behind increase.""

Lisa Kossoudji, supervises nurses Ohio's Hospice Dayton, pulled mother, 95, assisted living brought home live pandemic hit. gone weeks without seeing mother worried condition deteriorating restricted room facility sought limit potential virus spread.

Her mother, condition causes thickening hardening walls arteries brain, receiving hospice services. Kossoudji seeing families serves make similar choices.

""Lots people bringing folks home physically, lot physical issues, whether feeding tube trachea, things everyday lay person would look say, 'Oh gosh, can't this,'"" said. ""But yet willing bring home want able see them.""

Before pandemic, hospice workers cared patients dying heart disease, cancer, dementia terminal illnesses long-term care facilities and, lesser extent, home settings. Many families hesitated go die-at-home route many logistical challenges, including work schedules complicated medical needs.

But pandemic changed things. People suddenly working home time, comfortable home hospice knowing alternative lack visitation nursing homes.

""What happened COVID everything steroids speak. Everything happened quickly sudden family members prepared care loved ones home,"" said Carole Fisher, president National Partnership Healthcare Hospice Innovation. ""Everything accelerated.""

""I heard families say, 'I care aged mother differently could working home,'"" added. ""And togetherness family unit COVID.""

Dying home everyone, however. Caring needs critically ill relative mean sleepless nights added stress pandemic rages.

Karen Rubel recalled want take 81-year-old mother hospital stroke September pushed hard bring home soon possible.

She president CEO Nathan Adelson Hospice Las Vegas, designated one in-patient facilities COVID-19 patients.

""I get people coming from,"" said. ""They afraid."" Oh damn lmao, even notice that. Like even need argumentation absurd face. link site itself. So, drive...? Take bus...? 

And dying, likely can't ""see them"" anyways hospitals senior homes allowing visitors. correct 38.8% received least one dose always still shaking yourself. Heh. exactly right. seems extremely ambitious company already contacts employ somebody able figure contact. specific product service? Alternatively could reach local homeless coalitions ask help need. Another big problem investigating nearly 14-18 months outbreak started.  i’ve screaming metrics using since beginning all. hear lot governors control restrictions “we letting data drive decisions” ok u please tell us data?

i think caused lot mistrust people use say they’re lying cherry pick stats get want, instead absolute set metrics goals needed hit would transparent.cuomo new york spring thought great allow people see know hit get restrictions lifted.

but couple months basically threw window..

if give people goal would get back reach goal feel like people would much willing comply restrictions, instead idea goal anymore.is deaths, hospitalizations, cases, what?

i realize difficult deaths hospitalizations lagging measures u ignore cases look those, time start rise it’s late restrict idk seems like need set clear goals are, KPIs determine meet goals, get meet goals Biden made LOT logistical, educational, contractual decisions made distribution lot easier country. 

Source? they're widely available (and conditional guess successful hope be) I'm (might keep masks though). We're still several months though. Chinese government want tell anything first person know got virus. Except lived Hubei province. Openness first confirmed case would start. Virginia. Still Hunger Games here. fear open groups parents get appointment.  restrictions supposedly curb behavior. Imagine opened everything tomorrow restriction ""you vaccine participate"". many people think would suddenly show claiming they've vaccinated? company working leveraging post-pandemic synnergy better position market leader abolishing chaos ushering new normal world peace.

What asking? question sounds like trying fancy unclear. company create jobs help people homeless? places US vaccinating healthcare workers even see patients COVID. idea, think, must see patients up-close small rooms, therefore vulnerable.

The decision vaccinate first tricky, since question logistics, vulnerability, spread. Older ""at-risk"" people likely get sick, fills ICU. people work public likely contract COVID, likely spread it. Schools particular guaranteed become superspreader sites, vaccinating teachers mitigate that. already number schools quarantine high numbers students staff reopening.

There also question fairness access. personally see ""at-risk"" individual ability work home given priority workers asked return work. at-risk person protect themself staying home avoiding gatherings. teacher asked return classroom option. people face higher risk, many otherwise ""healthy"" individuals get extremely sick even die COVID. still lots questions confirmations vaccinations cease asymptomatic spread, particularly variants like B.1.1.7 P.1.  


Vaccinations counted metrics, metric utilized determining how/who/when open up. real metrics mean around positive test rates hospitalizations, likely Biden administration already ramping testing resources alongside vaccinations. can't identify spread region, eyes there. allowing virus spread control among young people increase chance mutation developing would covered existing vaccines? varies lot, horror stories ones people going talking going notice. handful people know who've 2 doses either mild symptoms. 12 weeks sounds extremely dangerous.

'Among concerned Paul Bieniasz, virologist Rockefeller University. “Rolling partially effective vaccine regime peak highly prevalent viral epidemic great idea one goals avoid vaccine resistance,” says.

There’s chance, Bieniasz explains, people waiting second dose may sub-optimal level immunity places selective pressure virus. someone become infected interval jabs, pressure could allow emergence mutant version SARS-CoV-2 able shake person’s immune response—a so-called escape variant. variant also proved capable causing severe disease could potentially spark whole new, devastating wave infections deaths.' I'm glad still posting this- needs heard.  cant pretend know... article cites Fauci specifically mentioning regional quarantine requirements asked small private gathering. seems recommendations could span entire gamut. airports big public locations like Malls. Easy way catch asymptomatic super spreaders. could Huge catch even 50% time. I’m numb numbers. I’m glad OP posted MTG read it. Listen, thought correcting one small error (saying demographic info) give demographic info anybody reading bolster point.

And got panties wad it. incredibly incapable admitting getting minor point wrong get upset someone correcting minor point, even helps overall point?

Honestly, expected say: ""oh, that's right, helps point thanks!"" would it. want quibble strange reason. truly bizarre conversation. let's end here. Goodbye nice day. Easy say, diagnosed horrible disease pandemic millions people give fuck refusal wear mask could kill me. People know willing wear mask.

I fine, hope family, there's barely empathy country. That's bleak actual threat death due COVID. People freaked diners closed 500k dead people. Collectively, barely anyone willing fucking thing help fellow man, would rather friends killed stay home day work.

Yeah, recent good news, yeah shit covered baboon left Whitehouse coup turn out... dude, critical thinking lead one dark conclusions future. think bad, think we're going react global warming?

No, need

I'm probably biggest hypocrite world saying this, start content possessions. happy instead trying ""grow"" time. likely teenagers paying attention Zoom classes.

Reddit trends much younger people realize. Death rates never drop like brick. cohort people infected given day go die different times (some two weeks later, two months later), even new infections among risk go 0 single day, would see instead decline deaths weeks.  closer get herd immunity greater pressure select immune evading mutations.

Ok, go again, viruses (this one, one) conscious beings... copying error occurs virus spreads, virus **chose** replicate mutation, mutation, mutation always able replicate (unless course copying error impairs replication process), one mutation particular continued spread evaded antibodies. sooner? vulnerable populations vaccinated next month think mid spring return normal question There’s data shows vaccinated people can’t pass virus

Bro, use double negative. use literally anything.

There **zero** verifiable evidence vaccinated person spread virus rech maximum immunity. anything presented without evidence dismissed without evidence. Saying ""well can't prove vaccinated people **can't** spread it"" ridiculous excuse justify permanent restrictions peoples' lives. want take deep dive pros/cons lab leak hypothesis article amazing:

[The Lab-Leak Hypothesis decades, scientists hot-wiring viruses hopes preventing pandemic, causing one. long read, best researched review evidence I've seen far. see presence Peter Daszak team new light. want shot shots skanky, dirty, pub find.

Fuck it, I'll lick toilet seat. OG SARS used ACE2 receptor.  Yeah sorry don’t feel bad someone refused wear mask endangered people purpose, basically covid denier, said women get abortions prosecuted, ended dying.

He got deserved. Yes, hopefully continue years, fact there’s moral debate giving placebos wanting continue gathering good long term data. 

But definitely got data needed confident efficacy much much quicker would normally take wait many months enough controls catch illness know good vaccine was, therefore went much quicker expected. right make call. Nobody make see important people know still might spread it?

I'm prefer well-informed public never suggested otherwise, I'm sure coming from.  think that's strategy it? valleys fully open everything shoot rapidly. go restrictions less restrictions cases dictate go vaccination.  Uh huh. Sure. I'm done summer one going stop me. empty middle seat feels like Covid theater.

It's illusion safety.

At point may well go whole hog fill it. estimate, red herring. would send Mods message then, links posts referring to. China Tedros Sigh.

On top know people devastating effects, 2 also doctors, also claim antibody tests negative. Haha fantasies here. 
There’s data shows vaccinated people can’t pass virus. people need wear them. Vaccinate not. That’s way Right? fiancee's parents caught mom immunocompromised worried. dad never mild muscle aches mom single symptoms. Makes sense. I'm insanely thankful, weird disease. really interested find asymptomatic cases happening frequently. sub seem done though. anything see bit careless optimism times, especially threads.

Assholes never wear them. Considerate people will

That's false choice. Considerate people wear masks around people they've vaccinated. they've vaccinated, longer significant risk spreading virus. point mask longer neccesary.

Again, force masks people indefinitely. accept society never conform around authoritarian fantasies. lot people said separated guy met prior covid first world problem lots Americans can't afford travel. (Is first world problem though, lives middle income country?)

## Abstract

**STUDY QUESTION**

How semen quality sexually active men following recovery severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection?

**SUMMARY ANSWER**

Twenty-five percent men recent SARS-Cov-2 infections proven healing oligo-crypto-azoospermic, despite absence virus RNA semen.

**WHAT KNOWN ALREADY**

The presence SARS-CoV-2 human semen role virus contagion semen quality recovery coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) still unclear. far, studies evaluating semen quality occurrence SARS-CoV-2 semen infected proven recovered men scarce included limited number participants.

**STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION**

A prospective cross-sectional study 43 sexually active men known recovered SARS-CoV2 performed. Four biological fluid samples, namely saliva, pre-ejaculation urine, semen post-ejaculation urine, tested SARS-CoV-2 genome. Female partners retested specimen found SARS-CoV-2 positive. Routine semen analysis quantification semen leukocytes interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels performed.

**PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS**

Questionnaires including International Index Erectile Function Male Sexual Health Questionnaire Short Form administered subjects. occurrence virus RNA evaluated biological fluids collected RT-PCR. Semen parameters evaluated according World Health Organization manual edition V. Semen IL-8 levels evaluated two-step ELISA method.

**MAIN RESULTS ROLE CHANCE**

After recovery COVID-19, 25% men studied oligo-crypto-azoospermic. 11 men semen impairment, eight azoospermic three oligospermic. total 33 patients (76.7%) showed pathological levels IL-8 semen. Oligo-crypto-azoospermia significantly related COVID-19 severity (p &lt; 0.001). Three patients (7%) tested positive least one sample (one saliva; one pre-ejaculation urine; one semen one post-ejaculation urine), next day new nasopharyngeal swabs collected. results three patients partners negative SARS-CoV-2.

**LIMITATIONS, REASONS CAUTION**

Although crypto-azoospermia found high percentage men recovered COVID-19, clearly exceeding percentage found general population, previous semen quality men unknown, known whether recovery testicular function occurring. low number enrolled patients may limit statistical power study.

**WIDER IMPLICATIONS FINDINGS**

SARS-CoV-2 detected saliva, urine semen small percentage men recovered COVID-19. One-quarter men recovered COVID-19 demonstrated oligo-crypto-azoospermia indicating assessment semen quality recommended men reproductive age affected COVID-19. People replace cruises traveling, anything money spend local economy since giving giant cruiseline corporations. better economy yo-yo ""more activity"" ""less activity"" vaccine widely distributed, stuck ""less activity"" whole time? 

The economy cannot ""get run"" things re-opened. Many businesses closed permanently. Isn’t Canada stuck deal required entire population? happened? one pro lockdown. People want die. care. getting paid. policies advocate directly contributing problem, pay. End story. must forgot mention China denied access initially months negotiations let year later. Ya, thx coming out, ! Ah sure bro. Whatever say. Assholes never wear them. Considerate people what? response non issue. need distribution points need supply. literally NFL pr point lol. surge like before, either. get drop hill. 

And areas put restrictions, btw. course, Christmas vs. Christmas means huge behavioral change much population (i.e. traveling see family vs. so). many corona viruses? People always seem read less effective ineffective. world communism failed..we manage capitalism pull billions people poverty.

No use trying failed model again. state country ever going kind Lockdown delusional think otherwise. Quidditch. Yes Harry Potter. I’ve playing since 2011, last year supposed last season. worked hard get nationals, team tripled time win record one season, traveling across county. came grinding halt. supposed go Nationals April. I’m coming 1 year since played, longest I’ve ever went. Normally looking forward games starting gets winter. just...nothing. sucks. cases nose diving feel like something done 6-8 months ago. point covid every nook cranny country. 2 hour plane ride riskier going restaurant grocery store point. I've never heard phrase given context assume asking innocent question intent bring illegitimate points. Correct? still see issue question per se. mods ban OP consistently later half fine asking legit questions even perceived intent good. public health officials ones blame, republicans congress surprised posters get thinking they're better people ""follow rules."" 

I'll get vaccinated can--but I'm going resume ordinary life soon restrictions lifted, whether I've jab not. People scared ""long COVID"" lung scarring stay fuck home long want. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Bro, going force people wear masks they've vaccinated. not.

Deal it. Yeah 1% isnt enough Yeah, like consensus western experts along. surprise here. figured would end. widespread virus became also became evident would become endemic. OH YEAH LETS END COVID, GET FUCKING SHOTS. IT. 3 different statistics, within 28 days test, within 60 days death certificate mentions Covid. believe article based around death certificate one (only saw briefly paywall popped up) much closer excess deaths. Celebrating 40th birthday husband two couples Las Vegas. trip planned early pandemic, sad miss it. We're parents young-ish excited get away long weekend - little know we'd miss trip, facing 11+ months babysitters, school, support. Ohh. Scary day rise wondering today's piece insanity former sane world Tuesday Feb. 9 population density! know Swedish population spread perfectly evenly entire country 64 people per square mile? right, situation extreme risk. chance vaccine's provide sterilizing immunity, take chance. see important people know still might spread it? There’s also lower level lab Wuhan also studied bats. Jan 14: ""Preliminary investigations conducted Chinese authorities found clear evidence human-to-human transmission novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified #Wuhan, #China""

Should interpret as:

\- CCP spent little time researching virus therefore, little information?

\- rather, CCP researched lot confident human-to-human transmission?

The tweet extremely misleading international organization countries rely health policies.

In admission tweet CCP, get access CCP data. IMO completely irresponsible move, showed much influence CCP bought international organizations. say, I've flown Delta whenever possible even pandemic. Never got massively screwed flights affordable, without service cheap.

And flew Delta see family (safely), happy split middle seats. I'm sure going make *massive* difference long run shows they're trying. Damn get snowboarding skiing frickin fun... pandemic people keep shit set us back? annoying .. Unlikely still possible, fact virology lab studies coronaviruses bats near Wuhan first port call investigation. trials shortened. 

The phase III trial still going run entire 24+ months. asked emergency approval initial data, ask full approval end trial, present full trial data end. 

If enter boost trial, effectively phase III trial however. sure going continue phase III trial boosters approved. certainly see competing people pro-Communsm pro-Fascsm forces Reddit. posters favor middle ground responsible leadership sustained economic growth needed healthier nation. Sorry automod speaking truth. 

*Animal Farm* *1984* predictive.   Last one u/GovSchwarzenegger shocking development, horseshoe bats reservoir coronavirus. got go places wanted go to, year later. exactly? They’re buildings markets. There’s evidence them. supposed feel good Chinese let tour around buildings meet people China stalling year. 

The evidence received whatever Chinese decided give them. doesn’t matter buildings visited people talked to. It’s also comical think anyone talked *inside China* would say anything Chinese government wanted say. J&amp;J cusp approved imagine get sooner later. Stay strong friend.  covid skepticism troll... need lip service Although hopefully things go back normal, people aware spreading diseases like colds there's bigger culture around staying home (with new virtual work/learning options) wearing mask public flu-like symptoms. Lawmakers miss single paycheck 2020. Correct - 3 4 NOW. Gérard Julien/AFP/Getty Images Europe’s oldest person, Sister Andre, French nun, survived Covid-19 celebrate 117th birthday week, caregivers said. Lucile Randon, took name Sister Andre joined Catholic charitable order 1944, tested positive coronavirus retirement home Toulon, southern France , 16 January. said Sister Andre, blind spirited, would celebrate birthday smaller group residents usual coronavirus infection risk. wish they'd honest say, ""We want people keep wearing masks vaccinated keep unvaccinated people lying failing follow health guidelines."" That's real reason want people keep wearing masks. subs, people really harsh frontline worker right now.

In r/thebachelor, general consensus home 24/7 reason, responsible someone dies virus. lot Americans worried since last March Seems like aren’t deferring doctors autopsy already made mind due Covid though? Maybe not. China country values free exchange information.

They get run censorship state cry foul people assume would censor negative information. course Whats bloodlust kill many people possible get vaccine? give people chance get vaccinated? 6 people received poll crumpled threw away without responding, already dont wear masks point become dominant lot vaccination vaccine protect one variant.

In words, case use ton AZ vaccine, variant evades become dominant, yes, get herd immunity.

So lets use AZ vaccine. widespread use vaccine key variable, SA variant becoming dominant follow that. Yes,I think anyone ever suggesting otherwise Many assume got covid within 10 days getting shot. speculated many would exhibit less safe behaviors post 1st shot. people lost jobs ""protect"" others, subsequently going need pay people contracted disease?

How fair sense? Ah see jedi culture well Masks far foolproof barrier, distancing avoiding promiscuity far important. point is, people saying time little risk gathering outdoors justify protests, ludicrous. already knew couple months pandemic kind crowd potential super-spreader event. comparing surgery makeup? two comparable comes associate risk. truly recognize difference medical procedures take weeks heal medications calm body's inflamatory response/antibiotics proactively treat possible infections, etc....and lip gloss. old you? 19? Let’s try seems like good idea. doesn’t work, booster, nothing lost. fact we're also fucking another area allowing unnecessary deaths good argument opening schools. good argument Coronavirus overblown. anything, pointing little government cares us kids. Archived link:  even assume difference 100% due mask mandates, still goes show effectiveness mask mandates nearly high people think is.

The rhetoric often, ""If people would wear masks would go away!"" reality like, ""If people would wear masks might slightly lower cases deaths."" Almost like there’s middle ground “we’re gonna fine it’s over” priapism every time see upcoming holiday calendar Drives nuts too. 

Thanks laugh.  What’s funny many categories aren’t even joke. California, Michigan, New York appear process loosening restrictions. 2 months open everything full stop, restrictions period, includes mask mandates

I would keep mask mandates month two restrictions lifted, hard lifting date. Like, April 2nd every restriction besides mask mandate lifted, June 2nd mask mandate lifted. first worldwide lockdown human history, plus five 'near-miracle' vaccines enough stop it, can't operate sunk cost fallacy continue road. Nah, that's thing gets control. everyone think OK reactive instead proactive? couple months, vaccines everyone, long cases still (they better point, otherwise working), open up. Sure, winter Santa Ana winds blow across SoCal, take early morning walk keep warm, even possibly future packed train.

Otherwise, forget it. Try make me. Toyotathon surge 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 people received second dose peoplle could got infection receiving first jab first jab immune response really kicked (around day 10-14) Except year year data disproves this. tried over, evidence support wild claim?  link evidence suppressing showed spreading?

Or concern trolling nothing back up?  Please dispose unused masks environmentally friendly manner. Archived link: got second dose Moderna yesterday, I'm going now. fine middle night last night, woke standard aches chills. took Tylenol went back sleep. 

This morning felt awful, bad enough sleep day. 10am got shower I'm feeling better. Still achy tired. took ibuprofen earlier I'll probably need lunch. suck, immune Covid huge relief. It’s still likely prove otherwise. UK government’s top scientific advisers warned early signs Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine less effective stopping mild moderate cases South African coronavirus variant “worrying harbinger” 2021.  Sir Jeremy Farrar, director Wellcome Trust medical charity member government’s Sage advisory committee, told Financial Times year “very unpredictable” new viral variants less susceptible current control methods likely undermine efforts contain virus. doubt 3/4 wearing masks begin right now. Sure maybe northeast flyover south like 1/4. Facebook using conclusions justification censor posts think wise times use common sense especially information given section people strong reason believe certain way.

eg:

**Airline Industry,** wants believe safe fly maintain profits, especially important consider directorates companies legal obligation believe best company, customer.

**Common sense** could argue impossible filter air person could breathed someone else unless wearing breathing equipment directly connected said filters.

&amp;#x200B;

**Government** says schools safe, children get infected, many governments considered economic cost parents sending kids school (hence parents unable work kids impacted education) higher potential risk life.

**Common sense** could argue even kids become fully infected symptomatic, absolutely reason could carry spread virus, reason believe kids magical immune system comes preloaded 100% efficient antibodies ready (not even memory cells take time spin up) destroy virus material soon enters body. Common sense could argue kids unlikely physical symptoms still able pass virus even less efficiently.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow that's thoughts, continue evaluate told common sense filter personally think would great everyone else could :) going change Yes, ""coughing people old-folks home"" hyperbolic. point conscientious thing aware possibility exposing others. risk spreading disease lowered eliminated. say smoke. Buy pack cigs make seem real. think you’ll certain percent kids probably solid future ahead stunted unable function society. agoraphobic shut in. every child resilient bounce back. guessing human nature explode many crave socialization, partying &amp; participating society fiery passion. Vaccines tests target specific virus. vaccines show lower effectiveness variants they’re exact match. need reformulate vaccine also target variants.

Why would tests, also designed specific virus, find variants 100% accuracy, test isn’t told there’s something new look for? 

Just like vaccines - tests work certain degree can’t work 100% - target changed.

Say strawberry seeds one seed square. test kick negative finds square? get better, likely going back normal people realize pandemic turns endemic. start pushing narrative little imo start shifting societal norms wear masks, improve ventilation, practice safer cleaning forever. makes people reading anyone interested   Right. keep seeing articles like ""if vaccine work new variant X, would bad"" - like shit. would also bad sun exploded.

The problem people hard time understanding probabilities, articles like easily get people wound up.

I also see lot bad faith comments technically correct. Things like ""we know vaccine reduce chances spreading virus"".

Yes, may scientifically true (as now), intent spread science. spread fear.

If not, could also included ""but probably since vaccines do, vaccine stops symptomatic, simple fact coughing everywhere likely help reduce spread"". 

I get cautious stating things scientifically proven yet, sometimes common sense help draw conclusions. need run controlled experiment know getting hit head rock hurt. many anti-maskers Fauci created last year outright, deliberately lied it? Newsom, Whitmer, Cuomo, lockdown happy governor public health official two random things.

1. father got COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna) Friday. side effects far!

2. played *skribbl.io* part team-building activity work today, one words ""vaccine."" topical. support direct benefits long haulers, rather blanket tax freezes everyone.

But need clear, medical diagnosis 'long-haul Covid'.

Specific, measurable effects observed recorded doctor. ""My brain feels bit foggy,"" going cut it. learnt reading comprehension, would know preliminary investigation implies researched well enough point. updating people live fact-based moment. Could stay silent 22 january data? Yes. time, panic anxiety growing, intended soothe didnt expect become pandemic.

It's adorable people blame mistakes government. changed verdict got data looooooooooooong government imposed travel restrictions. warned everybody seriousness disease, none countries prompt follow protocol. instead admitting fault, (especially usa) feeding narrative people mistake, theirs. give example, central asian south east asian countries never mainstream news blaming whole time. every local news health ministry, specifically mentioned following guidelines. compare western countries Please tell general public tell difference someone vaccinated idiot believe vaccines thinks government can't tell do. bye real time? Cause said like 3 times already. 

Go back class Karen. Yeah, insane. lot people giving up, also political narrative completely changed Biden became President. people spent last year calling Trump mass murderer locking harder suddenly flipped supporting lockdowns. ridiculous. One reasons slow uptake covid started exactly SARS/mers, happened years apart avian flu swine flu. Ebola. I’m even 30 yet distinctly remember 6 “omg going die” viruses. first one actually mean much. 

There’s zero chance didn’t affect response. fully admit last week February “oh fuck” meter actually started swinging. swung hard. hope you’re right honestly don’t think he’s competent enough pull tea leaf reading well sort of, like, woman. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* got yesterday 8:30am, 8pm started feeling like getting flu. Super cold even though I’m always hot one, super weak extremely tired. Came home bundled up, hours later fiancée said burning up, took temp 102.5. Feeling little better today though. Car accidents also cause 30,000 deaths per year compared nearly zero airplanes. wondering could link studies vitamin D, like offered, friend?! Maybe they'll use money take time work grieve since lost child. Pretty gross people would suggest sort money grab. 

I know woman lost child used leftover crowd sourced money start small business. allowed stay home spend time children grieve private still making income. judge money spent on? I've posting almost every day since Jan 8th, adding time. Barely anything changed since yesterday though. I'll continue edit one post tomorrow's.

If suggestions links, feel free let know! I'm anti-lockdown come, disagree this. ok keep mitigation measures place make progress wait make meaningful change hospitalizations quickly cases falling.

There really evidence this. Give high-risk population chance get vaccinated talk easing up. agree waiting herd immunity open necessary, mitigation measures thing hard lockdowns/closures. actually referencing celebrating one year anniversary [this yes, agree you. they're currently loosened every state think of. you’ve already decided China covered head amount evidence change position - stop pretending care investigation admit want see headlines confirm existing beliefs Stop moving goalposts! /s  disagree. short memories. Things may feel different time eventually world continue pandemic. could repurpose tens thousands psychology graduates work marketing suppose. enough people vaccinated, yes. period I'm concerned substantial number vaccinated people enough herd immunity. Another way look case rates: vaccinated case rates minimal, go party. vaccinated case rates high, really need worry still mindful whether potentially exposing others. rate things going, seems many children missed 1.25 2 years worth social development.

Keep mind children normal years miss amount social emotional development compared peers. Kids capable learning, especially age. They're going stunted life anything... worst they'll take another year three years learn need develop. best, children fine soon socialization begins again. go school Midwest won’t lie it’s lifesaver days it’s 0 windy. Might consider wearing one walk long time outside, infections gotten control life return normal don’t see wearing one socializing Yep. people least susceptible symptoms, severe illness, death last able get back ""normal"".

I doubt ""honor system"" work though. People use opportunity crowd bars, theaters, restaurants, night clubs concert venues, like really ready, probably they're actually vaccinated. ones likely ones slated vaccinated last.

I'll let guard parents, myself, family vaccinated vaccines made readily available anyone take.  seriously needed chuckle today, lol. Poor Mets. There's still ton restrictions place across country. Funny people sub question validity data agree preconceived ideas.

Questioning data good. bothers see people express valid concerns regarding studies lockdown mask effectiveness get nuked downvotes told, ""Listen experts!"" Plenty people got vaccine infection around time, based symptom onset timelines, evidence harm. might want get tested, vaccination interfere swab results all. impressive since vaccinated people elders tend make 70-80-90% thde deaths 3%. good numbers 747 isn’t really used anymore passengers never used domestic travel. would 1000% love see proof normalized. Remember normal, extreme justified actual extreme circumstances

I really worry future lockdowns much less serious things. People regularly comment things ""aren't bad"" ""don't mind"" masking/distancing/etc indefinitely. I've taken Covid extremely seriously beginning, shocks people desperately want normalize people also vaccinated offer time

Janssen vaccines, bit 200% considering much deliveries Janssen vaccines. Considering this, almost enough (or enough) vaccines whole adult population end Q2.

These numbers come directly Dutch government include supplies initial contract, optional additional contracts, top-up contracts ""surplus"" countries. Also, includes NovaVax (Q2 start limited amounts) Valneva (Q1 '22 start) well.

By numbers, Germany enough 63% population (around 200% needed) Q2? considering full treatments second numbers? taken account vaccines additional contracts yet? “Not big fan” lmao wut?!? relative.

Im sorry things like happens, rare happen without tested positive covid.

I know title misleading still cause people panic. Lockdowns work, evidenced countries like New Zealand eradicated virus. I’m sorry you’re unwilling unable understand facts contradict emotional outbursts. 

Good luck middle school next year. UAE little natural immunity compared US. israel, although cases deaths begun falling significantly last couple weeks too. According research secondary research sources Chinese scientists god, people exhausting. cares came from?What change learn came lab not?Yeah it'll another reason hate China,then what?Does practical consequences battle pandemic?No. whatever motivating Americans big carbon polluters cease.

That stuff doomed. based death toll, US twice much natural immunity israel. recent interview, Scott Gottlieb said combination factors. Approval happened bit quickly expected; manufacturing took bit longer hoped.

They still started earlier would have, saved time, didn’t hundreds millions doses ready go December. avoiding everyone? uh no. people I've 8. go big parties, keep sane yknow Sure - odds getting killed accident 1.25 per million miles driven - far, far lower chance catching Covid, far, far lower dying Covid. 

Yet wear seatbelts. 

Wear mask, wash hands. true Oxford vaccine. Chances cut severe illness stop infection, similar Oxford.

All heard Africa variant efficacy Oxford vac regard infection. Severe illness endpoint / data that...

So, say still expected cut severe illness, experts, can't really claimed yet.

But I'm wrong, please show source. carbon footprint must horrendous.  wake leave copious quantities heat-trapping gases others deal with. Shame you. Prevalence actually high. really high (like 10%) long time ago since everyone would infected already.

If prevalence like 1% would expect see 1% covid-unrelated deaths covid-positive. 46% deaths. Covid prevalence way, way 46%. honestly wish could tell you. don’t remember content. it’s kind don’t feel like you’re actually asleep wake realize dreaming makes sense? real shame young soul go... truly horrible RIP her.

Wow really needed charts figure out? pushing idea virus 96% similarity bat viruses found southern China travelled overseas got imported back China frozen food like CCP spokestrolls claim?

OK. Pfizers vaccine hard scale up. Serum institute india plans produce 50 million Novavax vaccine every month. good efficacy pfizer vaccine. guys even read title article? 
If reduce transmission, reduce hospitalization giving younger people?

You telling "" wrong vaccine still useful *this, that* "". 

But article literally says Tons people however get vaccine. instead wait months get one. 

And said wrong.


So basically since said I'm wrong means think fair people aged 50-69 gonna wait months get vaccine even tho vaccine stops hospitalization, reduce symptoms _reduce transmission significantly_ given younger (even tho high risk getting infected) population. someone explain health authorities/hospitals attribute covid death someone died another illness/symptom even though also covid?

A friend uses argument state covid numbers way overinflated due I'd like debunk rational answer point trying make people tested fall COVID numbers reported. Meaning may closer herd immunity think Photoshopers R Us back? Give vaccines back countries. SARS-CoV-1 direct ancestor SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-1 totally eradicated descendants lineage still exist. overall virus species SARSr-CoV still exists (all strains besides SARS-CoV-1 SARS-CoV-2 limited bats), SARS-CoV-1 still exist descendent either.

NO. make up? made different facilities around world. idea 60 year old multiple issues get covid shot Ga? Desperately searching shot mom. Thats cited wikipedia also references this:  ""effective emerging strainS""

Plural.

And South Africa *variant* (which really is, technically strain) -- perhaps famous emerging variant world right -- included? headline writer needs shot. soon. ""No evidence human human transmission""

""Masks work general public""

Ok WHO, forgive struggle trust think odds comparable. accident almost guaranteed get hurt without seatbelt costs nothing Yeah don’t think Biden administration trying fuck us totally see looks like That's great! actually never said money flowing CA state budget. sure point comment is, though. whole, CA budget done fine whether storm. locally, many LA residents access capital needed go work.

So shutting things scientific reasoning hurt helped. Sorry, Rant-TLDR. I've feeling really triggered past couple days constant MSM saying variants essentially useless vaccine.

Sometimes wonder what's Redditors. Get head ass, u/eulenauge see elderly/high risk people start wear face masks consistently especially flu season; rate flu all-time low due mask-wearing hand-washing. think people wear masks precaution develop viral symptoms well. Beyond that, think people try go back pre-COVID behaviors. good thing longer ""weird"" wear face mask public barrier lower.

Dont assume arrogant shit like that. need locked spread controlled stopped. NEVER go away meaningfully otherwise. need paid pandemic government, thats one reasons fucking exists. Thank you!! Exponential growth dampened 1/3 still exponential growth take much longer reach number infections without it, albeit approximately 1/3 lower absolute ceiling. 1/3 highly skewed towards vulnerable dampen hospitalizations deaths far absolute scale lot people still hospitalized die, possibly still overwhelming numbers hospital system beds \~0.3% population given time. 1/3 population vaccinated get us woods means. need like 2/3. Besides select geographies local politicians forced elderly covid back nursing homes, lot overloaded hospitals. 

I work hospital system, wrong embarrassing see sub, bad enough anti vaxx facebook groups, overloaded months.

Here updated NPR chart hospitals stress due COVID, right now, significantly worse past see hospitals country severe stress.

You can't occupy 20-50% beds one new cause expect hospital function, hospitals operate less 10% surplus bed margin, many people dying including people COVID attended exhausted healthcare workers attended fast enough overload. got second dose 13 hours ago I'm currently suffering work... wish luck. Right? can't imagine someone getting annoyed side effects vaccination thing digging us shit pit pandemic.

Plus, unable deal without 1 employee 1 day indicates management poor. whole ""everyone vulnerable getting vaxxed"" thing pisses reason no, people can't get vaccinated others vulnerable whatever reason get state's list ""high risk groups"" got 2nd dose moderna

The day shot fine, sleeping could feel muscle aches, next day fatigued pretty bad muscle aches. Think time flu fever , think recovery stage flu/fever, body muscles weak. me.

I friends 2nd dose worse off. Fever, chills, nightsweats 2 days. Americans vote change healthcare plan. It’s pathetic. Almost countries free cheap healthcare. know funny America gives billions every year Israel free healthcare schooling every citizen. country paying screwing people mean mRNA based vaccine could better approach becuase Astrazenca one seems reduced effectiveness new strains? Cool story bro Well dont know vaccine actually stops spread, thats really measured for. optimized 95% reduction symptoms, basically creating mild asymptomatic cases, may still able spread illness. Frankly, everyone vaccinated im ok getting mild case getting cold worst, dying getting hospitalized see reason even consider actual case numbers resume normalcy. im scientist issue likely far complex, layman stand currently Poor reading comprehension. Strawmen. Personal attacks. Angry rants. 

Do really think changing anyone’s opinion? probably opposite direction nobody wants associate embarrassing behavior.

Congratulations need understand don’t owe anyone explanation choices make. judge you, fuck em. patient gsw positive Worse first, terrible. Everyone office got 2nd dose took next day sick came back fine day after. mild body aches chills headache 36 hours perfectly fine Figure out? Sucks way? ..or reinfection asymptomatic. somebody got infected dozen times one asymptomatic might never know. Based YouTube diet I'm guessing fair number die thanks meteorite impact frying pan skull  Looking forward dreams! Second Moderna due ina week. Implying year delayed gratification hilariously naive. different levels. Asking someone see one 18 months delayed gratification, worst criminals. never large gatherings, would called parents wanting see grand child. long 4 year told can't see grandparents? many people died taking precautions? delayed gratification? People dying NYC hospitals != people live NYC. massive metro population immediately outside city. true, maybe said asses risks time comes must. That's... literally said though, fact definite minority. 

The comment implied nearly everyone deals it, wrong. 

We agree this, would dismissive profession, something worked incredibly hard on?

Of course find studies own, literally did, that's comment said. damn, new variant?! it’s almost don’t really care. quit fear mongering. Cuomo's presentation say indoor dining like maybe 2% cases New York compared private gatherings much higher?? open parts state think time open 25% NYC. know. What’s funny transmission much higher summer. (In area anyway). reopen. Fully respond. masks. social distancing. Back 100% normal. Mask mandates persist vaccination rates higher case rates plummet (summer sometime US guess). then, decision makers simply erring side caution. Thank science live arcades? remember masks hard find, they're everywhere. legitimately identical second dose. Nothing changed though.  same, conscription little authoritarianism. recently much western world conscription. forcing vaccines never pass here, benefits may happen. Misleading title. one person ""underestimating"" reinfection, even article states want monitor lack resources (resources areas pandemic response lack well). That's like saying US underestimating vaccine importance they're pushing enough doses per day. 

Plus one case stated beginning article got infected twice 2020, semblance vaccination place. vaccines become prevalent, cases reinfection drop people become immune it. approve use US.

Good thing FDA huh?

I'm glad smart people making decisions relying low intellect armchair scientists Reddit. didn’t see numbers J&amp;J variant? Good SA though pivoting Women likely seek MEDICAL care. Men tend ask women lives provide support care sick, generally go physicians. correlation population density.  certainly work better every voluntary guidelines everyone else tried. vaccine efficacy vs SA - ""fuck it, we'll live"", guess. I've book many seniors (friends parents, e.g.) appointments. system built digital natives. I’d like see specific reports population. addition 45% nursing homes, another large percentage would vaccine eligible due age immune compromise. populations excluded vaccine trials. vaccine trials saw nearly 0 hospitalizations deaths, didn’t include populations represent majority Covid hospitalizations deaths. So, month interesting see vaccinated folks get good result healthier people vaccine trials. That's looks like state. flat 2020 steady surge started late October cold weather pushed everybody inside. Cases stop dropping two weeks ago, they've fallen around less half peak. new mitigation effort closing businesses (restaurants/bars) 9pm. weather still cold enough keep everybody inside.

I think ""f--k it"" crowd hitting herd immunity among makes total sense. Hopefully everybody else hang access vaccine. Sorry even read whole thing? ""Hey guys, math add understand we're gonna hit optimistic timelines."" exact opposite ""cheering virus.""

If everyone actually could get vaccinated April would excited. seeing get here. Wishing someone would explain way magical thinking handwaving ""exponential growth"" . do... hand data FDA (and likely EMA- I've never part process). Tegnell might killed Austria beautiful. wish best Israel considerably younger population Israel, means people completely ineligible vaccine young adults less incentive vaccinate numbers reflect. 

e.g 94% 70-80 age ground vaccinated (one dose), 79% 60-70. Meanwhile 33% 20-30 41% 30-40.

The US better, Europe even better still. Reddit full socially awkward nerds think it’s okay live fear forever. I’m going back normal vaccines widely available. mild asymptomatic. quote article via Google translate :

"" 14 cases British variant B.1.1.7 detected end last week. affected already received second vaccination vaccine Biontech / Pfizer January 25th. far, according home management, asymptomatic mild courses disease found. still unclear exactly residents infected. ""

And quote article prior one mentioned:

"" asked Robert Koch Institute Paul Ehrlich Institute exam, said Spahn Monday. authorities would concerned infections occurred vaccinations. Spahn emphasized could several explanations. One possibility would patients infected coronavirus many weeks ago, infections remained undetected. However, cannot ruled vaccinations prevent infections, alleviated course disease. also conceivable take time full vaccination protection. "" bad, lol. got mixed up. Meanwhile people thread acting like pandemic's over. anything even little negativity gets downvoted Washington state, instance, health officials investigating nearly 700 cases meet criteria possible reinfection, three dozen awaiting genetic sequencing one case confirmed. 

Washington seems one states means intent pursue number re-infections. local newspaper followed multiple cases yet there's reference cases state anywhere else--it's strictly local person focused. Again, whole question long antibodies protect go away never convincingly answered (maybe 2 months 16 months). wasn’t told otherwise decreases chance could contract pass on. helps protect which, turn, helps protect others. CDC’s site said 5k DEATHS February 4. 
“On 4 February 2021, state reported 1,507 new deaths. CDC working state assess time period data cover. may temporarily impact death counts, rates averages. “ 

Makes hesitant cheer one day reported deaths low Scientists confirmed reinfections initial illness caused SARS-CoV-2 virus possible, far characterized rare. Fewer 50 cases substantiated worldwide, according global reinfection tracker. five substantiated U.S., including two detected California late January.

That sounds like rather insignificant number. scientists’ understanding reinfection constrained limited number U.S. labs retain covid testing samples perform genetic sequencing. KHN review surveillance efforts finds many U.S. states aren’t rigorously tracking investigating suspected cases reinfection. I've always assumed podiatry medical specialty, entirely different degree. slow start picking speed. According NYT’s tracker, tied NYS % population least 1 shot (9.1%), although NYS fully vaccinated.

Progress. NOPE. Herd immunity lie. Variants take over. Masks social distancing forever. /s ...and nobody that. whole subreddit been. 

I get everyone tired COVID-19... can’t put arbitrary timeline it’s “over”. lot people sure hell tried pretend last summer we’re enjoying consequences right now. sue ass retire early. legal advice IANAL. due underestimating every aspect well?  Today oddly doomery reason. Here's seeing times soon Today work employee sneezing day said taste smell anything.

I would straight call cops along county health department. feel like people ""demanding"" social interaction you, wear mask forever. care *you* long force others.

I'd actually appreciate keep wearing mask forever know toxic people worth interacting are. Wow, thanks delta, way bare minimum even enough time. tell, may need trials, much smaller scale phase III. I'm certain looked discussed speak, know soon. They’re proactive. Recall bunch tech companies allowing staff work home *forever*, yet people sub salty school districts actually plans place case pandemic isn’t control think might fall. get it!  Lol oh god...you don’t remember last March read back Clorox wipes started hoarding saw “effective coronavirus” smoking gun blew thing wide open? 

I sure do. Feels like lifetime ago. r/ChoosingBeggars figure walking outside without mask passing within feet someone seconds extremely low risk.

Low risk *to you*, mean, right? 

Masks mostly protecting others, case infected asymptomatic. 

You way knowing infected asymptomatic. Therefore way knowing infecting others around you. 

There wedding Maine people wear masks practice social distancing, six seven covid deaths traced gathering. deaths even attendees, caught attendees. 

I assume risk averse -- wedding attendees is, people died result self-centered carelessness. Connecticut, also authorized podiatrists (they regularly give cortisone shots) veterinarians administer vaccine. Right now, state can't even get 85s rolled successfully. We're getting 1% doses need vaccinate number people categories state announcing. think *possible* they'll get shit straightened really ramp numbers but, year taught anything, there's nothing important partisan hackery can't ruin it. it’s worth noting Columbia study still concluded vaccine would remain effective, that’s recall saying read whole thing originally

That's conclusion Columbia paper... said would remain effective UK variant. called SA variant worrisome made judgment call study wasn’t criticized, Columbia used pseudo virus wasn’t closely related, researchers University Texas pointed likely explaining efficacy difference. seems like reasonable thing point out

I certainly would call criticizing. saying use pseudovirus accounts terrible explanation. Moderna ran similar study pseudovirus, saw 2.7 fold reduction added one mutation (K417N RBD) mutant. also Eli Lilly's binding site monoclonal lost effectiveness SA variant. UT study contain mutation, even though falls directly RBD. mutations added, Moderna neutralization fell 6.4 fold, line Columbia paper Pfizer vaccine. reminds me, Chicago, early pandemic, mayor drive around yell people homes breaking lockdown lmao. live, people started partying like 1999 minute Pfizer Moderna vaccine trial results announced. wild. like ""ummmm...you know actually get injected first, right?"" (I get mine injected weekend partying 5 weeks.) Completely understandable. really don’t think remote going needed fall.

Simply put, evidence harm good vice versa. believe good people want help, I'm going forget happens trust people say going help. add onto this: 


3) time health workers (and police, etc.) vaccinated moral dilemma appears whether continue elderly whether start lesser priority group parallel), new data possibly (e.g. American trials). could modify age restriction overnight. 

4) still assume vaccine avoids transmission, social distance face masks remain vulnerable groups vaccinated. 


5) New vaccines available finalise health care (and really key) workers. 


\*By key workers mean working frontlines (health, police, pharmacists, ambulance drivers). teachers, cashiers taxi drivers. Outdoors low risk looking going maybe 0.01% risk 0.013%-0.017% risk (assuming new variant 30%-70% infectious), words, still low worry about. doubt hoarding. expensive need prescription. *Thanks fish! local mask bans logical product nine months consistent anti-mask statements Swedish state...

Unclear. think lot undeserved cynicism J&amp;J's decision use moderate severe cases gauge efficacy. chose measure efficacy terms moderate severe cases [their ahead phase 3 trial December, cleared FDA, like Pfizer Moderna chose include mild cases protocols ahead phase 3 trials. really know many moderate severe cases become mild cases vs asymptomatic, know many mild cases become asymptomatic. Totally possible included mild cases, done much change reported efficacy, although suspect would found way include press release better. asthma spelling AIDS  booster type may required. Obviously trials exist yet, stands reason receive AZ's vaccine may also develop immunity mRNA vaccines effective South African strain. would say something like joke, don’t see someone actually stupid Twitter handle probably owned campaign legal entity.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  right. It’s unfair they’re rolling long wait. don’t think people realize long we’re going wait. I've got ready part usual asthma action plan. Since taking forever get vaccine hopefully limp along prednisone luck runs wrt avoiding infection. Sorry, things getting back normal whether like not. feel area actively cheering virus? guy *assuming* 100 mil Americans want vaccine... even though US somewhere around 260 million people age 16 LOWEST polling still 60% saying want it? people see around getting it, likely want it.

I agree 100 million courses (2 doses each) allocated/delivered April reachable. disagree demand ""dry up"" less half eligible received it. Fun fact. Life isnt escaping pollen. Absolutely right thing do. impossible safely open schools vaccinated. allow everyone PhD administer vaccines, doctors, right? said death blue check removed cases testing major variants conducted yet, it’s foregone conclusion.

The companies using different adenoviral vectors. AstraZeneca using ChAdOx1 CanSino Biologics using Ad5. could differences vectors result different efficacy. USA never reach 70% vaccine coverage. survey suck, probably, that's issue. Rather counterintuitively, margin error pretty much relates sample size, population size, 2000 would equally good polling population larger thousand people. thanks Superbowl parties, they'll back up!
Hope enjoyed dip fuckers! missing preexisting cross immunity SARS-CoV-2 unsupported woo. Upvoted. sub full lunatics disregard common sense reason. source this? I’ve read 90 days get antibody treatment, actually catching covid. precious metals 💎  you. Plans always good thing considered now.

That's ""it's bad wind"" proper Midwest saying 🤣 Herpes park bench? idea talking about. touch surface flu covid, touch nose, mouth eyes, infect yourself. difficult. virus infection human history wiped besides two, took decades even vaccine

Eh, SARS probably wiped out, itself. Sweden decided eugenics problem 60s. Pertussis one. Hey hey! Yeah, cold. Even January, February, March well 32F days, maybe hit mid 30's midday short time. way kids sit focus temp. mention frequent howling wind... I'm plenty cautious virus. stay away people, wear mask. little different comes state funded vaccine administered medical facilities sterilized grandma. plenty reason weary. could placebo falsely give us confidence coronavirus, something even malicious. There's million ways vaccine go wrong first year, one thing supposed do. I’m 33 cold always minor inconvenience. hospitalized cold summer (yes, tested positive . wasn’t covid first, second, third, fourth time swabbed me, get positive adenovirus expanded respiratory panel). avoid wearing mask, bet I’m going to. Ah, another article roasts mitigation measures individuals actually themselves, offers zero alternative people states spending time money trying protect covid. telling people Australia took papers please route followed basic restrictions shown work even remotely close martial law. Sorry, get pretend actually made good point actually idea hell talking about.

you know martial law is. know police state looks like. posts comically uninformed bullshit. Don’t shoot messenger 🤷‍♀️ I’m saying support it. think it’s ridiculous much do. Probably scans certain keywords comment.  Yeah considered russia bad? ...oh have, nurse, high percent fakers sadly.

Hopefully find doctor believes work figure don’t currently that... makes HUGE difference. Yep think exactly it.

At beginning cases basically people sick showing doctors hospitals testing. Remember months widespread testing.

Once testing rolled ""case"" could anything someone sick, asymptomatic healthy person testing positive. time passes latter especially areas mandatory testing employees transit passengers etc.

Also virus continues spread people get ""hidden"" cases. Post source falsely claiming ""if impossible."" Post it. source!!!!! Coming 5 months in, fatigue worst part, feeling similar you’ve finished strenuous run, except whole body basically lay bed day. get brain fog / confusion, chest pain, difficulty breathing / chest tightness, chills, muscle joint pain, nausea, headaches. symptoms come go exacerbated activity, even activity like walking stairs. days feel pretty normal now, never lasts terribly long. initially lost smell taste, probably recovered 25% smell, 80% taste. chest get tender too, shirt blanket feel heavy painful. feel like heart beats weirdly sometimes too, way measuring heart O2 levels. lungs appear fine X-ray, that’s good least. I’ve taking Alvesco, steroid inhaler, help breathing, well Vitamin D, Zinc, multivitamin. think Alvesco really helps. 
The brain fog make really difficult read focus basically lay wait out. Even sitting extended period time quite taxing. Pfizer/moderna said vaccines still appear work lab studies suggest antibodies still appeared 

It's highly likely probably still work without clinical trials hard say efficiency is. would naive think still offers 95% efficiency SA variant especially Novavax J&amp;J reported dropped efficiency levels. hate ask it’s horrible, could attributed partially fact lot vulnerable people already dead?  guy can’t conceive way. gatherings 20 plus people times asking lot. Asking watch Super Bowl groups asking much. 

Since pandemic call making sacrifices. Postpone Christmas, thanksgiving, Easter, Super Bowl parties don’t spread risk people. It’s asking sit couch year. It’s asking nothing 18 months. 

It’s personal risk it’s people might effect. college student I’ve quarantine roommates refuse responsible. I’ve safe done right things ended risking family coworkers simply I’m living selfish idiots. 

Refraining gatherings least could done. shows self centered shallowness people. 77k new cases. 1.4mil new tests. 80k hospital. 1,309 new getting vaccines out. We’re gonna get this. really hard know. good news vaccination rate increasing. areas also may approaching herd immunity among subset population socially distancing well.

But new variants people letting guard might enough opportunity virus make one small comeback March, vaccinations drown good. electrostatic effect destroyed soap, alcohol.

I've used steam supplues short, articles it. 

Baby bottle microwave sanitizers used w N95, procedure masks iron wire (zap, melt, fire). Entire point post.

The US weld people homes, demand papers see daily walk within govt limits, force get tracking apps phones.

Good. would bite back ass did? what's even point? seen various articles giving range 3x 10x infections vs. cases, 20x one 80x. Peer reviewed journal? impossible. extremely unlikely EXTREMELY.

And said ""People absolutely gotten infected, spread virus, died fomite transmission""

Post sources 

You say author data make claims right make claim nothing backing saw another ""stop optimistic"" post. couple lockdown forevers too. live her. biggest difference flu kills little 34,000 Americans year, covid killed almost half million. covid numbers flu, totally lets open up, extremely unlikely vaccine shedding new mutated strand vaccines helpless against. Whenever Americans make claim anything, laughed Fair enough got first part yesterday. got headaches bad muscle pains. far good. eligible get vaccine COVID last month? Heres hint;

I edited comment seconds posted felt aggressive uncivil, top that, quoted isnt even wrote. dont care, since probably already noticed that, plan put overtly aggressive condescending start (like people website) BS people already died taking vaccine. I'll take vaccine available trust par vaccines. even month? championing unrealistic harmful idea. human contact year terrible idea. calling people selfish able handle that. Yeah that's true, forgot that. 2-3 weeks MIGHT hit 1.5 mil/day weekly avg (assuming moderate climb 1st doses).

Well according Bloomberg 7 day average 1.47M today looks like prediction wrong there. suck rest world.

I think also sucks us too, longer pandemic spreads uncontrollably, virus mutates, likely variant threatens vaccines pops up. might feel sick day, nothing worse you’ve likely dealt before. It’s day second dose definitely felt pretty yucky morning (malaise, low grade fever, headache/achey), times I’ve weather. warm bath ibuprofen seemed help lot symptoms mid day. Hope goes well :) don’t quite agree this. live learn long enough, know well enough good idea we’ll respond different life stressors. 3-4 month period vaccine administered people desperately want it.

What? CFR IFR. CDC estimates 80mm infections US 450k deaths. know someone sore arm second dose got drunk night got shot maybe helps lol. mean know difference again, pretend like know difference either. Mercers really. stuff gets banned cancelled experienced enough younger bother me.

You get ready lot bomb ass summers climate lockdowns coming. temporary everyone gets vaccinated. know long takes. 

If lift restrictions soon risk bringing back need wear mask time reach herd immunity variants.

After sure take masks need restriction that's still far away unfortunately also one widely distributed, worst one found useless

I'd argue place vaccines distributed ATM America, approved AZ.

Sucks rest world though. please provide source could learn more? child adult make decisions? No, analogy work. counts overweight? seems pretty shitty country, people like mom older overweight cant get vaccinated someone like could. It’s like Texas vaccinating 3x many people per population states. many vaccines go around. grossly simplifying think like this. first dose meant teach body attack COVID, second dose meant test body learnt first dose ensure retain it. COVID typically immune, first shot ways acts like second infected before. mother got 2nd one Thursday arm still killing her. Though tbf student nurse injected wrong area way fast, according mom. first tired, chills, that’s Here's hint. want civility, opening line be, ""Maybe keep science spreading misinformation."" That's it. parent selfish letting kid eat ice cream breakfast lunch dinner think really depends person. elderly parents got 2nd dose Pfizer last week. experienced mild soreness injection site 1st &amp; 2nd doses. unfortunately also one widely distributed, worst one found useless Gosh, nearly 70 years...crazy nearly gone ravaging human populations thousands years tho renders one vaccine fairly useless. is, coincidentally, also vaccine amount fudged data surrounding development given two dose regiment also pound pound worst

(Its tha AZ vaccine fyi) What's Alabama at? Exactly this. Honestly, hypotheticals like kill arguments keep making up, I’ll entertain it. 

I assume pro vaccines (all COVID). I’m sure you’ve heard people say baseless claim cause autism, I’m sure you’ve heard argument even cause autism parents still get children vaccinated it’s better greater good. 

Not full Christmas parties Super Bowl parties like getting vaccine. rare possibility die anyway something unrelated, still greater good. 

And don’t know me. pandemic might tearing apart inside. It’s like I’m great time missing family gatherings seeing anyone roommates basically year. curious, judgments either way. anyone (64-year-old female) felt fear virus, even back March 2020? absolutely think Covid hoax

I'm young essential worker. family members, friends, coworkers, test positive Covid.

I'm fairly large county Maryland, one bordering D.C. populated area.

I feel fear. feel confused nobody know gotten it. seems unlikely. Vaccine everyone long way away even vaccines 50+ long way away. 

It September least sufficient portion country vaccinated remove masks maybe November.

If ease early risk covid coming back soon. Sure probably able update it, many millions still needed initial contracts plus redoing dose everyone already vaccinated. That's meant base. know able make combo shot 3 dose everyone.

That's lot extra doses -- already like 40M+ US. eventually enough capacity, I'm sure, doubt boosters get priority first vaccinations. know 5 percent? think might ""based nothing""...

That's much lower estimates even then, 5 percent permanent damage? Wtf that's horrible 100% serious. Texas currently vaccinating people pre-existing conditions, regardless age.  Super Bowl coming up. think it’s safe say 1) people 70+ vaccinated younger people given vaccine. Early shots AZ given healthcare workers, keep Pfizer/Moderna elderly.

2) someone despite gets vaccinated parents, they’ll hopefully visit assume anything age, thus felt needed reply. I'm aware statistics, I've obsessively following since last January many high risk family members. 

I know even needed concerned anyone besides 65 family group like said, lost someone 65 health problems, daughter's best friend lost 44 year old mother (who smoker) 16 year old cousin mild case heart damage care pediatric cardiologist. year round athlete (and since age 4) still cannot aerobic activity (this since April). 

I get vast majority people catch COVID die, one ever suggested that. novel virus zero information long term effects. Telling someone there's reason worry incredibly insensitive fears. People vote want change reality virus unpredictable. thanks. school strict protocols missed two days since resuming person classes last September (last two days Christmas break). coming September, reason distance learning obligation schools unless we've severely screwed vaccine rollout up. probably 20+ factors contribute case numbers. want compare apples apples would need create alternate universe Florida restrictions. 

But we’re cherry picking comparisons, let’s compare cold weather state like Washington warm weather state like Florida. Despite Florida’s weather advantage (viruses survive better cooler air), Florida’s well-documented data shortcomings, Washington done much better. Per capita numbers below: 

Total cases per 1 million people 

Florida: 83,050

Washington: 42,495

Deaths per million

Florida: 1,295

Washington: 698 Update - parents shots arms! Thanks advice!

\-The UK variant dominant one Israel around 70-80% infections.

\-The lockdown, strict paper, really enforced, especially two problematic sectors population- ultra-orthodox (main offenders) Arab population. Life communities continued pretty much normal limited mask use, giant gatherings thousands people (weddings/funerals), open yeshivas etc... (fuck religion!) 

\-Coincidentally two populations lowest vaccine uptake. It’s “wanting over.” pro mask beginning. pro lockdown even small business owner wasn’t getting ANYTHING. cannot stand anti-vaxx crowd reopen protesters. isn’t that.

Imagine helpful would sequence wastewater airports transportation hubs? acting like death rate would kill potentially almost 3 million people US absolutely devastating. That's even factoring uncontained spread would cause downriver deaths due healthcare overload. That's colossally stupid. Yellow fever epidemic Philadelphia, almost Europe Black Death, plague Justinian.

How entirety middle America full fragile morons? Ah Minnesota Senate. Always day late, dollar short, slightly different planet. T'would good idea, except solve problem actually have. We're short people administer vaccine, we're short vaccine. at-risk ones spreading though... vaccines likely lower death rates, I'm pretty sure drop due Holiday rush finally subsiding (only replaced SuperbOwl rush) took election  yeah, really saddened me. I've lost lot faith people year. Ironically, driven closer religion I've ever yearn moral community. found one yet, though! Yeah ""eye hurricane"" new thing. Things ok they're going get much worse, tune 11... I've spent past year B C. C first started. summer hit cases low MI B way, I've spent last couple months C sharp rise cases. Weird comment rockets go crashing down. Ask Musk GME holders. name was... Tater Salad. interesting pointed early March late March discrepancy. longer hold B117 variant becoming dominant one country- us getting vaccination coverage weather that's conducive spending time outdoors, better we'll come late Spring, early Summer. Vail Breck yesterday today state. Reminded it’s like normal again. 11 day since first shot moderna. say eat outside cold sucks. Glad enjoyed! Key word ""reporting""... know, actual difference genders could larger, smaller reported one. Nobody really talking brazil strain. one worried THOUSANDS PEOPLE doesnt matter Honestly, think choice make. virus negotiate, open everything virus thing. Super spreader bowl nationwide. neighbor 30 people house yesterday super bowl party. myth scientific journals honest unbiased. corrupt rest society. Good! Tired damn bad news variants. Unfortunately human behavior tolerance lockdowns play equation. People limits, friction see results varying limits individual reddit members. 0 reason this. Horrible. horrible:/ literally subject thread mean probably convince him, one study, Israel simply kept track 750,000 people vaccinated found far 531 tested positive 38 got think far zero deaths Covid reported anyone vaccinated least weeks, though I'm sure that.

However assumes numbers made there's something wrong every study analysis he's going believe guess. I’m saying acting like it’s shocking someone serious lung cancer died covid? bad respiratory virus could killed point. saying covid isn’t horrible - it’s scary sure. isn’t shocking! Thank you! feel way. many people like love taken ""denier"" route hardest thing feel resentment serious character flaw. guess good test us consider moral/religious learn judge really hard see people suffering dying. holidays opinion ""fine, lets stop masks restrictions everyone want wear mask sign statement saying seek hospital care immediate family get Covid"". Consequences actions. Let's see many faith beliefs freedoms faced that. kawabunga think wrong person dropped conversation. Thank you! It’s likely housemate positive. get vaccine two weeks ago fingers crossed that’ll help. still isolate hopefully won’t bad Um...or recover normally. That’s also option. postponed twice last year decided small thing. unbelievably frustrating know pain.

I advice, wanted wish best. Strangely, regret microwedding even though pictured myself. Yes, know 26 27 hope negative don’t want get two vaccines protection, I’m personally taking AZ unless put forward booster updated version provides decent protection SA variant.  whole ordeal left pretty disappointed American people. We’re weak whiny now. One guess awful things climate change truly gets control.  got downvoted talking California variant couple weeks ago saying unique strain was. guess “fear mongering” said take variants seriously 🤷‍♂️ bright side, probably stopped developing alcoholism, alcohol/substance abuse, alcohol/substance dependence, like (alcohol abuse, bordering dependence) friends college! :)

Or cooped-up isolated made drink/smoke/partake even more, case...I'm sincerely sorry, hope find outlet kinder (I alcohol 6 months [I'm stopping forever, probably year get healthy in-shape]).

But might leave great opportunities learn/do something typical pary culture college would prevent doing? Maybe could learn instrument, language, craft, skill, hobby always wondered about? YouTube Google free, video/voice-chatting friends family (especially friends made freshman year college) could great way bond get together!  article restoring electrostatic could maybe done static generator high voltage coil old TV, I'm skeptical using hair dryer.

What UV decontamination? husband group D. work overnights crew maybe 10. vendor go every job. passed away exactly 1 week ago today, almost 3 weeks since contracted virus. I'm furious group A. folks major collapse begins! Another factor take account ease speed travel (internationally nationally regionally). COVID truly exploited human behaviors infected lot people, allowed people vectors extended period time without symptoms prior becoming severely ill prolonging duration severe illness. 

It's obviously speculation, COVID occurred 1918, may spread globally could worse due lack intensive specialist care today.

edit: Essentially, virus perfect infection current day.  inject lidocaine gums think handle giving vaccine arm, agree. Looking forward hearing details it. late now. Still tracing, enforced quarantine, enough vaccine system target anyway. shitshow incompetent dumbasses...what joke. least they’re paying funerals. got going us. Smh We're disproportionately vaccinating people less likely transmit infection first place. 80 year olds superspreaders, young healthy people are.

It's possible deaths come vaccinate people likely die, transmission rates go *up* people back line vaccines decide ""now really like flu"" completely give precautions. know size scale US completely different could vaccinate entire population 2 months Pfizer vaccines sent US alone. We’re track it’s frustrating see fumble Canada praised months end covid response. That’s awesome! wish best. Yes, enough us vaccinated buy bigger house bigger car. waiting that. go 10k daily certainty b1 variants laughing precious vaccines. BEFORE. get difference? wait two months hopefully done Yolo surprised faces thing blows March levels seen. Check Brazilian varian, infecting people antibodies. allow one spread, back square one. wait bit ... bad it? I'm terrified second dose Yeah. Sorry wasn’t clear. vaccine intramuscular. wouldn’t like giving insulin shot. said. Florida: hold Super Bowl *aka* “Spring Break 2020 Vol. 2” people spread back states like before. literally paid $2 per dose 300 million doses AZ, $600 million total. Whereas bought amount Pfizer around time $19 each, costing $5.7 billion. Nearly 10x much. earth 'buying AZ hype'?

Also, may forgetting, literally idea vaccines would work bought. vast majority candidates either discontinued still finished phase 3 trials. Sure, want get right. fact, however, based current timeline, J&amp;J timeline handful days longer (time application FDA review) either Pfizer Moderna timelines.

In current situation we're in, extra time noted. fair ask ""why extra days?"" Alcohol culture/ cold/ lack vitamin D

Russian men die young already less tests administered. work ER large hospital, see maybe 2-3 10 people getting tested nowadays. sayin'. dipshit, thats 400,000 dead. ROI negative. care opinion happens I've nothing prove you. metric hospitalizations deaths? That's really care about. possible get satisfactory mark *before* vaccine threshold. Visit linked subreddit risk. may high amount misinformation.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* [Good bit Personally think people saying end May ridiculous. People saying end summer also ridiculous. likely reach immunity sometime mid summer based timetables released manufacturers. enough doses 300 million end June. Add month give take lag distribution feds distribution states. Add another month people actually immunized first dose. That’s think you’re looking somewhere around July early August. People don’t want hear though want able stop wearing masks end restrictions. question becomes stop restrictions ones. say personally around early summer loosen business restrictions keep masks groceries, department stores, etc late June July workers customers mostly chance vaccinate percent vaccinated makes spread indoors much less likely. cases low enough April probably reopening schools. I’d say sooner least live know it’s hard teachers get vaccines community spread still pretty high. sometime March April seems like good idea reopen schools. “Chrissy, give schtickle Pfizer.” look one app store. pulse oximeter works shining LED light finger monitoring sensor like phone camera. something every phone has. dedicated devices better sensors calibration. Seriously, wtf happened sub. ""Dems took power time brunch"" get high extra? Ride train. Flying sucks anyways. true all. Monoclonal antibodies work best. Steroids late. Sane anti-coagulants. Reddit aren’t 

And hell would disclose Reddit account employer? Especially one spend signifiant amount time baselessly insulting others....

And since two developers seem want dump Pfizer Moderna, one mentioned Novavax, I’d say it’s reasonable perhaps work them. could comment want, since trial data Novavax public Many inhalers use steroid confirmed. $42k? steal! That's cheap COVID treatment would otherwise require hospitalization. Hundreds vs 10s thouands going say same. 😂 think we're hearing South Africa variant recent studies vaccines far worse ""vanilla"" COVID UK strain. Brazil strain bad. least till end next winter. Like one posts mentioned, March next year seems far likely summer things normal possibly be. 

What people countries done years feeling sick, wear mask courtesy others. new norm people vaccinated. 

But idea get vaccine summer time time go maskless hitting music concerts amusement parks ridiculously selfish. No, realize they're trouble getting it. problem fixed. Lol drama ?This 1820 2020 faith. dumb throwing deti words proves idea herd immunity is. Steroids effective treatment while. No, first two days instruction. deal rest school year might looking 40x amount, point probably looking handful older relatives dead maybe dozen long term cases. many die price semester hybrid education one school district? hard questions, I'm trying flippant. alternative may waiting fall vast majority vulnerable chance vaccinated. wish receive amount sympathy gave others died him. Question all.

If already COVID, recommended get vaccine not? (late) 60-something family member also cancer survivor asymptomatic covid. Unlikely, possible! Reopening happen without conversations hope well, planned better plan. Actually, no. 

Anyone overweight safely easily lose 0.5lb / week reducing calories. 

Takes 10 minutes calculate BMR monitor weekly. 

You will, however, need honestly accurately record calories consume - much people. 

If much hassle, “look mirror, eat less chubby” method works too, although less accurate. restrictions, gives suggestions though. Youyang Gu machine learning model uses IFR along many, many metrics state level, positivity rate, hospitalization rate, days diagnosis death, death reporting lag, days til recovery, distribution Rt values. results slightly higher study: 89M infected range 59M 134M.

His values pretty closely matched seroprevalence studies state levels. should’ve gotten better vaccine distribution plan rolling lockdowns 100k new cases..

Sounds got PhD Trump University. It’s different different points. 

As testing expanded, multiplier dropped. referring gas-lit, understand pain frustration know us older even worse. health problems make likely live another 5-10 years. I've lost year life spend time kids grandkids. least young people make lost time. People like see irretrievable loss time. believe though get vaccines, I'll hugging kissing grandkids much they'll begging mercy! LOL. home state wants Guinea pig it. Scheduled vaccine tomorrow. AZ.. I'm Interesting. don’t like original version? Yeah, possible unforseen decapitation quite side-effect. Stop making poiltical. dropoff forecasts back November December. apex peak predicted shortly holidays Christmas gatherings New years. also sudden drop Jan 21st. We're still seeing way many people dying. Everyone breaking point they're done. active covid claim hit yet, will. won't. Japan’s “lockdown” hardly called lockdown honest. simpler answer culture accepted mask wearing kept many people safe. thread-within-a-thread protecting grandma vs allowing make decisions. guy Islam's Alex Jones?

Something something... Chemicals water... They're turning frogs *GAY!*  really start closing damn windows really hope scares lot people away concerts though. would nice tickets easy obtain awhile. Doubt though, think demand crazier before, hopefully surveys like little right. That's two questions one jury still both. first deals reinfection. disease get ? answer yes, frequency thing iws presently unknown. second vaccinated given strain still get disease different strain. also yes, results studies suggest possibility greater reinfection strain one. question frequent be, still unknown. matters weeks time absolutely sufficient make estimates probability. Agree it’s good lose weight mask wearing distancing easy instantaneous. Weight loss super difficult takes forever. I’ve seen plenty staying active/eating right covid lot mainstream news shows. Perfect time filler piece morning news. Lmao Yep.

None new.

And? Since similar Oxford/AstraZeneca, testing done see holds SA UK variant? believe Sputnik V also class Non Replicating Viral Vector. That’s particularly scientific way looking it. There’s kinds factors haven’t controlled area opened 1b today, Feb 8th. nice sloow roll out. Same, ugh. reads like literally 0 idea US vaccine rollout gone out
 vaccinating prisoners first they
 
They part Phase 1 many states sign Levi’s stadium Running republicans? Plot twist.  Actually many states still gotten 65 high risk patients (lung heart problems, etc). live Ohio people 75 still can't schedule vaccine. Pretty big selection bias going clubs... everywhere really degree. People would care enough wear mask club going go club first place. People type would go club pandemic type wear mask.

So lot people answering survey saying wear mask public vaccinated probably going right now. Like me. ever seen store see mask on... go stores. buy everything stores drive pickup. contribute people ""see"" look people wearing masks. Yet. soon I'm vaccinated start going stores again. I'll wear mask.

People careful part see go out. can't see us. impossible? completely possible. Again, author data data. majority people state clue got virus got from. consensus MAJOR pathway infection. People absolutely gotten infected, spread virus, died fomite transmission. think special box vaccines give specifically separated race something? 4th Semester lockdown began 4th, 5th Semester completely online classes. Final Semester (6th) starting later month expected online aswell. Covid messed College life well. Novavax multiple plants though? export ban would apply manufactured US. know plant UK. taste music? lagging people going about. that's problem vaccine rollout. national plan. states people like get vaccine, states high risk people still can't get likely weeks. state vaccinated house bound seniors first round, least likely people get give virus. think horrendous. I'm nurse works home can't get vaccine (despite also 5 high risk factors 63), yet country loss getting qualified people give vaccine. offered give vaccine nurses, retired, semi retired, work home, etc agreed sign one 8 hour shift give vaccine, would tens thousands nurses give vaccine could given 3 million vaccines day. shame one government see big picture organize anything. Awesome. Where's Marshfield? Bay Area Complaints

- Cost living (self explanatory) 

- Taxes (Our state income tax top goes 13.3%...they want even higher...)

- Terrible Public Transportation (BART full homeless people &amp; crime.)

- Crime (They pretty much give criminals free reign Bay Area. rewarded criminal here, punished. Look DA city joke)

- Dirty/Disgusting (Bay Area turning shithole, especially SF) Homeless everywhere, human feces, needles, city disgusting.

- Roads/Traffic (If work S.F. &amp; live outside city pretty much impossible drive traffic bad. Many freeways they've taken lane away made paid make situation worse).

Everything points state wanting take money they've made things worse. Anyone grown Bay Area tell same. Manaus, Brazil would like chat. estimated 70% pop infected April OG COVID, even worse wave December P.1 variant, suggesting new variant gives fucks prior infection immunity supposed come it. It’s Herman Cain Twitter team. true, factor people changing groups. goes on, people slide ABC groups, less move group. Late spring/early summer best case scenario, early fall worsr case. This. need everyone get vaccine people want to. vaccine works 70% population vaccinated. oof first dose arm hurt two days. Canada won’t give us second dose months wonder feel get criticized decision equivalent denied ability make decision. \*Especially\* social media, literally one power talk let them.

Virtually one isolated choose first couple months. Cities bus stops higher infection rates, blame ""lateral thinkers"".

This non lateral thinking right there.

I hope scientific paper better article. Palestinians really excess capacity. make excellent point. seems large contingent political messaging continuing live lives like this, overrun hospitals fear run amok pushed government media. much misinformation - like many people know age, thirties, believe catch this, 100% chance dying. Nothing change mind. nuts anti-vaxxers. anxiety around virus, reading/participating forum news cycle probably one unhealthy, unproductive ways manage it. Like said. happen anyone. time. multitude ways happen.

 exactly worry dwell die. perfectly good waste time given live.

You simply live enjoy time given long given.

I saying. Prepare tomorrow, never plan it. *say* want, helping. ""Saying"" nontangible action everyone losing money. know damn well working faster, shocked people wanna open up. avoid happening future?   didn’t want cause scene lol also works restaurant thinks like this? blood boiling think target Metrics right call. ""X"" percent fully vaccinated hospitalization numbers vaccination numbers fall within threshold start easing.

Strapping date seems arbitrary, hit acceptable metrics before? after?

Though, everyone wants vaccine get one, think strap ticking clock everything. Say 2 months open everything full stop, restrictions period, includes mask mandates. Gives month get month kick in, you. it? Ah heard moderna working update shot, perhaps 3rd booster original vaccine optimize immunity newer strains big thing remaining open young people risky underlying health conditions. least state it’s age job allowing access. really let people heart conditions diabetes get now. big lag death reporting, basically talking sheet music speed US is/will vaccinating.

By time actually see effects vaccinations elderly deaths, going well mass vaccination campaigns Sorry. making new pot coffee. Fuck downvoters, go enjoy trip live life, happy graduation boyfriend. We've wasted lives, given up, time take back live lives!

If life ever goes back normal I'm going UK. going cry many happy tears get see auntie cousins. People go fuck (besides already Covid). Personally feel American journalists already negligible credibility, make money appealing people believe anything want hear. Yes, two people talking different things didn’t much research guy appears figured out. even made video explaining all. Like, idk main stream media hive mind Reddit hasn’t jumped this. Ok, first word looking is, ""epidemic"". ""Endemic"" means localized certain region, widespread. secondly there's reason disease either. words imply disease widespread vaccinate. cases year epidemic. Good bot U.S. highly skeptical China (on bureaucratic level, independent Trump); participation perfunctory, criminally late investigation take away this.

Why China let investigation happen sooner?

Why China invite help world immediately?

Why perpetuate blatant lies nature virus fell line China's narrative? Yeah co-workers fight bitter end coming back. Honestly hope quit. ignoring questionable statistical methodology there. what's hypothesis? Jews good giving vaccinations? Americans wearing masks social distancing? Yeah, chance bat coronavirus outbreak starting next lab studying bat coronaviruses could anything said lab. Except one arguing never stay inside again.

You don’t change shit wanna stay inside. Look big Reddit is, you’re hardly one.  I'm utterly indifferent Querdenker Covidiots getting ill due actions.

But long R rate 1 time, take large numbers others — turn pass cases overall numbers fall.

Without them, Germany's case numbers whole would low (Munich 45/100k/week) Merkel might able get lockdown extension March seeking. [This would disappoint Big Boss Man. award clearly says, **This**. hit nail right head. 

I believe next great societal divide pandemic pretty big challenge, related said - managing expectations. think society widely diverse set expectations ‘end’ move pandemic, think we’re going really hard time taking next step collectively.

I personally think accept always level covid-19 risk forever now, hopefully quite minimized via vaccine’s aid severity reduction. anyone gets chance read rest comment, someone telling mutations *maybe* mess way eliminate virus. They’re saying they’re bunch introverted *comic book guy’s* want stay like forever ... they’re real people, probably quite extroverted saying they’re scared &amp; reason lost every ounce risk tolerance. don’t know convince people move away eradication opinion move forward life. think we’ll divided society - lots aggression emotion *overly risk averse* towards rest us, mind ‘we putting risk’ ... think did. novelty worn off. miss hanging friends school. sucks hybrid model doesn’t allow mingling. Oh yea university issues students testing positive still trying break quarantine rules. flight get back campus since option in-person activities. I’d wear 2 plane unless hard breathing Thanks. I'm still unsure Linux help pull old laptop fedora sure. Spread still mostly driven non-vaccinated people, difficult predict variant become dominant 

No, easy predict. case vaccinations slow spread, variant slowed vaccination become dominant, able infect vaccinated people. Considering indoor dining open throughout rest state numbers continued go down, little evidence suggest opening would cause problem. Ha, zoomed husband's cousins last month - kids ages yours. boy gone stir crazy! kids, really feels like parenting pandemic feels under-appreciated. 

I Big Brother program Little's mother went completely AWOL start pandemic.Kid (10) communicates difficult figure he's ok. unpack 3%. people varying degrees antibodies vaccine. 3 days vaccine effective compared 30 days vaccinated. 

If give 100 average people vaccine 0% chance death COVID 30 days later, different # looking COVID deaths entire country. fucking coup capitol bunch people never cared pandemic. 

And outbreak. definitely pretentious clickbait side things Dr. Fauci said would releasing new guidance fully vaccinated. Right guidance everyone else, wear mask social distance, stay home larger gatherings. Apparently that’s changing soon. think might getting data vaccine affects transmissibility Well, virus' biggest proponent got kicked Twitter month ago he's pretty quiet since. Wonder anything it. people either join herd forgotten. people like sort weird negativity thing? guys every comment section needlessly pessimistic.  bad nobody else believes that. Indeed.

I downplay Covid, mask take precautions.

But we're year now, nothing short rapidly vaccinating 85% entire world enough stop this, need figure tradeoffs need live this. think OG goal 100 million doses July, so, new purchases promises? think maybe 150 million Q1? Someone correct wrong  death likely counted infection.

That mean anything.

If missing 90% infections, consistent 90%, better metric comparison sometimes missing 20% deaths times missing 50%.

With infections, metric help know many missing. deaths? Less so. Excess deaths get far. They're higher priority every essential worker. came lab guys. think collectively we’re smart enough realize this. should’ve told that. Covid religion many now. masks like face head coverings required religions. Call shit move on. hello xinnie pooh fanatic. we're tired paid comments. there's subtlety, ""hur dur pro-chinar"", honestly makes look worse. must tracking infection rates time - they're still occurring basically rate trials, guess data project anything. infections start ticking upwards start estimating X% people lost immunity. 66% countries, 75% Pakistan. Also, one-dose vaccine. you’re saying become endemic? Exactly. trustworthy tho? know ccp, looking good controlling narrative first priority. 

It's still Little suspicious scientific test bats covid going around time. suspected wet market nearby. Sister flying today wants know one N95 mask better 2 masks, thoughts? computer probably look bank account hope learned something this. Listen experts selfish, let mass hysteria control either. Make best decision based situation, others try guilt into.

Some examples:

1. Wear masks early days pandemic. WHO/CDC/Fauci said to, reddit shamed people did.
2. Wear mask indoors home avoid crowded indoor places randoms, stop enjoying outdoors socializing people ""bubble"". People suffer mental health consequences quarantine extremists did.
3. Buying enormous amounts TP emergency supplies.

I can't say everything perfectly I'm glad decided follow herd time around. anxiety. fallacious mean appeal discount reasoning. sub supports protestors. people act switch. pandemic little light turns green.... reality there’s going “purgatory” stage effectively ends emergency.. 

You’ll see pop like little wildfires there, variant make akin “bad flu year” enough people vaccinated enough therapeutics around take edge off. Yes. See, e.g., Moderna. similar statements Pfizer. pretty much did. restrictions managed get lifted like 25-50% indoor dining, gatherings 20 people, etc still deal constant bullying via social media swaths people calling ones decided take advantage freedom selfish, murderers, irresponsible, etc. either voluntarily stay completely isolated, go live whatever semblance normal society left deal people berating us choices. winning.

Prior 2020 long term lockdowns isolation healthy people showing symptoms never considered reasonable strategy limiting disease spread. Especially data came last summer showed asymptomatic spread pretty much thing strategy shifted efficient testing anyone symptoms quarantining sick. It’s absurd people still think it’s reasonable place restrictions HEALTHY people. B.1.1.7 (UK variant), would appear least preliminarily Same. state closed certain businesses summer surge zero effect cases, reassessed said would never close businesses drive people private homes spread much higher businesses closed. ton respect reassessing basis. journos lose credibility keep fear mongering like that. 

Either stop fear mongering us lose credibility like Rona. It’s win win eyes. Dude literally flu told old people die time get vaccine positive covid doesn’t mean died covid every time. Prob closer 1% tho, still ends pandemic 1%(expected death rate without vaccine) 1%(vaccinated death rate) probably lower flu several margins. I'm anxious, I'm empathetic. want see people dying reason. anyone mental illness sociopaths care less others die long eat out. Experts wrong different aspects covid 19 every step way. book COVID leadership going write itself! Well, answer courts allowing bullshit amidst pandemic. rate (331 per week) 52 weeks 17,212 people infected. 16% 107K students.

This course assuming underreporting numbers all.

If assume twice many reported get 32% 107K students.

Maybe correct math? maybe OK numbers? Today one friends told mask mandates going permanent almost told fuck off.

Why people think going like forever? UK mostly new variant overall cases plummeting. South Africa. Kinda unexpected. Maybe we’ll see explosion cases soon? Maybe not. amount awards post got disturbing me. called progressive individuals celebrating death someone. Even someone misinformed Republican doesn’t wear mask mean deserve fucking die. Uh oh President's Day spike genuinely disgusting, Americans understand deranged European politicians past months. surprised lock us fall, Europe exits lockdowns year, they're ""concerned cautious"" new Uzbekistani variant spreads 0.1% faster whatever fuck they'll use excuse then.

I think situation getting back normal pretty hopeless Europe stands, best hope parody pre-COVID life designed incompetent bureaucrats they'll claim ""near-normal"" even seems far, far away point. I'm done, what's point living world like that? want friends live ocean away. (Many place even begun vaccinations.) that's possible, know I'll feel better I'll trip plan look forward to. 

I one friend time zone lately wanted talk much. Family even interact social media, let alone real life. work alone. I'm lonely. Good. forced to. lockdown stupid, hasn’t saved lives Awww hurt feelings disagreeing you? run back safe space. said know exactly opposite say is. come lab. nothing suck defend China since day one totally untrustworthy. comes literally anything China related dont believe paid insane degree Chinas bulldog ardent defender literally issue minor big. agree - it’s me. It’s people risk. outside tell dead cousin aged 31 great health access great medical help nothing worry about. Many people luxury quarantine 13+ months.   impression met him?  Well study korea (actually online form voluntarily submitted) among 900 people found people ""symptoms"" weeks covid, one ""anxiety"".

Is possible people experienced anxiety locked global pandemic jobs schools disrupted? sound like kind scientific study yet people draw ""long haul"" conclusions it. opinion? hysteria problem. find scream Whole Foods cashier it’s difficult understand people masks on. 

I haven’t complained much masks, stop trying normalize them. need go like 100 deaths per day. Media spreading message poorly. Dont forget fear-mongering propaganda copypasta. “HERES BUNCH LINKS PAGES PUSHING AGENDA, POINT PROVEN HAHA GET FUCKED, KID” 


Damn suggestivematerial really got us Yup. Zoonotic viruses go hand hand mass farming. wet market hypothesis convenient, sooo many arguably sensible infection pathways treat wet market given. 


Bat Farm Human, Bat Human rural areas, Bat Outdoor Cats Human. likely ever able trace real certainty.  bullshit answer. Canada last spring US response mocked? Yes, right mocking. reason support allies allies times need. 

Canada doubt get American support need home acute, expect receive special treatment given. distance measure? Well, duh.

Nearly novel viruses passed though species. known epidemiologists 100 years.

Not news. mild cases? Somebody thread posted smart observation yesterday believe rings true. time goes threat covid shrinks, people get lives leave subreddit similar ones. 

The ones left behind extreme. We'll probably still corona subreddits 2024 populated people think next big megasurge around corner thanks unknown variant #3451  thought said take shot, okay symptoms develop?  mean months... extensively (the media kind missed one), give official sources:

Biontech received 375 million € (+100m€ EU) German Government scale-up production capabilities German government helped aquire former Novartis production facility Still closely related all. Curse Randy Marsh Pangolin love! sure mean ""multiple orders magnitude"" two orders 100x saying reduced fatality rate Covid 90% would 100x deadly flu, numbers support that. would mean IFR Covid 0.4%, reducing 90% would 0.04%, IFR flu 0.0004%, simply correct.  finally state think might human human transmission covid. I’m sorry always believe intentionally leaked wuhan virology lab. Sure, corona virus also results ARDS. love good satire Like fish? /s Got second Moderna vaccine Saturday. Sunday Monday felt like shit. Like flu bad cold. 100% get vaccine, beware prepare. Everybody know got second one got least little bit sick 101 temperature.  exactly would trip vial lab leave genetic effect?

So virus mutated way countless hosts capable human infection widespread transmission, wild, right human outbreak occurs naturally gets caught sent lab ...then accidentally gets released anyway? massive implausible totally unnecessary step. 

Listen scientists, politicians media commentators. Doesn’t stack Indians living UK - amongst hardest hit.  threat? Shades Herman Cain. wait see there's tweet afterlife minimizing covid. reason CDC recommend masks months pandemic, recommend masks prior outbreaks, continues debated Reddit within scientific community. evidence incomplete mixed.

For example another meta-study 2018, pre-covid, analyses viruses transmitted, basically concludes know. way perfectly logical conclusion. Even studying something years necessary need understand know also think hyper-focus masks distracts people possible recommended means protection simply washing hands, somehow seems gotten lost messaging Covid. Pressure applied implications mutant strains global travel, vaccinations less effective understood. aren’t many shots left go around NC. They’ve used like 80%+ they’ve received. I’m pleased ability scale vaccine delivery I’m looking forward increased capacity weeks come. nutballs amplified everyone else’s. best universities world. That’s silly think none started 

Anyways. Every nation started immigrants. move stay they’re American American children go great things. 65 million Americans age 16. 

Trials actively underway 12-16. reason believe vaccine approved group, Fauci thinks happen late spring/early I'm guessing 1/4 (probably sadly) want vaccine. 

This rapidly changing. August/September, 63% said would definitely/probably take vaccine. December, 71%. people know people get shot, become less less skeptical. think, course making up, 80-85% uptake end year, among vaccine approved, plausible. saying that? result media public health officials lying public instead explaining complex situation. easier say ""You still spread!"" ""There enough scientific data determine whether vaccinated individuals still contagious, hopeful case. still cautious data comes in.""

This ""Masks work! buy them!"" again. case ""don't eat every living lay eyes on"" Chinese listen. They're #1 driver poaching shit like this. Felt nothing. even sore arm. Highly recommend 25% late month early next month. Production getting ramped hitting 2M vaccinations day Deflorestation? I've tried bit time. November-ish started get particularly bad Northern hemisphere past year. implausible spreading before, got noticed cold weather kicked infections overdrive. private industry always efficient government. think socialism good idea, look corona vaccine rollout. Biden good person matter appearance looks like it. law... point. guess trying make daughter precaution poster children something.

But said -- point vaccine return normal? daughter vaccinated going self-quarantine every time leave house? mean, why? seems completely absurd. flu bro? 

Come lol Completely agree. There's still hundred two million people left infect guess what, contagious variants spreading. Yes, things declining looking better. Yes, vaccinations continue. That's good. However, re-opening right now, mindset screwed us every step way. We're eager get back real life. Myself? I'd rather wait end limbo caused.  like new strains escape vaccines? get new strains escape vaccines. read title ""Casino"" wondering Casino involved making COVID-19 vaccines. Israel vax % Jewish population. covid stats count entire country + occupied lands don’t care covid killing people Even discovered evidence, likely trust result? Given we’re one investigating it, we’re one spent years researching Chicago bring refrigerated trucks store bodies heat wave 1995. take lot overwhelm morgue mortuary capacity. 

Shutdowns 1918 lasted weeks couple months fall, areas got really bad. think maybe get buy-in population shutdowns like that, see what's going eyes (and might staying home themselves, whether there's lockdown not). 

Broad, panic-button shutdowns, applied areas whether there's problem not, without exit strategy timeline, hearing doom around corner almost year, without means support workers businesses work... 

well, that's end today, kinds massive secondary consequences, many people burnt given (if ever followed them), really even able tell locking like New York/Illinois staying open like Florida really made much difference. would need target apples remove already got rid dragonfruit lychees? Hindsight 20/20 though. really didn’t know much start long would take get vaccines. loved ones mental health-wise?

Let's see, 3m maker masks gets pulp BC BC doubled production States April despite fact US seizing PPE shipments overseas bound Canada threatening block exports  wish would've given data 3% companies said 100% effective preventing death. would still take based data alone, breakdown would've nice. Cool thanks, although appear say test spike mutations found SA UK variants. good news fully test probably two vaccines, three probably change like april may. different countries mean there's nothing take away I’m neither know give shots animals pets. can’t imagine it’s harder people. would want random people giving covid shots, course, illustrating easy teach people give vaccines. Yeah sounds like bs me. evidence far suggests started Wuhan Dec, possibly Nov, 2019. Records showing Chinese doctors medical professionals struggled figure learning SARS like virus. 

I'm sure originated US would discovered hit Wuhan everywhere else nasty thing say.

You’ve made social distancing way personal. way, greatest minds art, science literature “locked room.” immense impact society. everyone needs like you, agree you. great news! need distribution routes - well vaccine available. original title article. Sometimes publications change title articles hours they’re posted. No, no, no, no, no. problem entire time. Things get little bit better bam, time re-open, undo progress made. we've time we've absolutely inadequate (read: nonexistent) national support federal government. People economic support incentive stay home. People lost jobs. open screwed time time again. Combine leader refused lead actively spread misinformation are. We've made far, locked least spring give chance vaccines ramp things really decline.

So, there's estimated 100 million cases that's slowing spread there's less infect. Guess what, there's still 200 plus million people. Yes, vaccinations continue lower number, we're close finish line, contagious variants rise, let's risk now. There's evidence didn't. That's others pointing out. ruled out, considered suspicious previously healthy child passed away. known medical issue right covid, considered. logical explanation someone diagnosed viral illness passing away without obvious reason viral illness least played role. possibility least deserves investigation. could provide information virus possibly prevent future deaths understanding happened. onus claiming superspreader events prove uptick cases. 

In Brooklyn protests tens thousands people shoulder shoulder shouting. wearing masks, masks perfect, especially people shouting/singing mask usage isn’t perfect. 

There apparently cases tracked back protests. millions millions people similarly protesting. what's missing perspective. [Polls people think chance dying virus 15% 25%, approximately 100 times high.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Israel hasn't?

Confirmed cases Israel equivalent 25.5M adjusted US's population.

You really think undiagnosed population much smaller? small groups private setting, think would fine. I'm worried bar hosting ""bring cards, come party!"" kind thing. mean, that's reasonable... COVID 0 unreasonable standard, need get point we've got herd immunity via vaccinations, teachers feel comfortable back classroom (ie: they've vaccinated themselves), we've turned COVID pandemic nuisance endemic like flu. rule remains place: ignore announcements restrictions weeks future.

It makes sense school districts plan fall might look like still need distance learning. doubt plans needed Well yh im purely speculating I'm assuming reason pfizer, moderna etc chose 2 shots first shot gives protection. There's variety reasons sometimes vaccines require one doses sometimes first dose give strong enough immunity others immunity begins wear first dose. Although doubt wears immediately 21 days. first dose already gives immunity logical assume immunity maybe wears first dose. CDC actually document vaccines work generally. also messaged things safely. stay home unless absolutely necessary. Exceptions include anywhere money exchanged hands.

The messaging mess beggining Ok thanks clarifying. area saying greater 35 makes sense cold chain. Beijing wet market outbreak happened way. pandemic, ""ending"", giving want go vacation summer. Cases, deaths, hospitalizations falling like rock, airlines starting climb coffin, government proposing shove back nail shut.

This makes sense, political move opinion. Cases already widespread, I’ve never seen pandemic planning guide says restrict travel internally already disease everywhere. 

Maybe work getting vaccines getting stimulus checks. probably help regular people he’s trying lay hard. 

And anyone thinks “more testing” make people want fly more, that’s it’s gonna work real world. Quick! deflect countries remotely comparable! 2 hours I'll leaving get first dose. would stating vaccinated reduce social distancing behavior around vaccinated people knee cap vaccination effort? feel it. Nothing quite like dead kids people start taking diseases seriously Yeah, acts politician scientist. don’t really expect change, least directionally, seems like progress terms restrictions vaccinated people. long aware actually facts support idea. may well wear crystal talisman around neck think protects evil spirits. logic makes sense. Poor countries usually HIGHER rates vaccinations. Yes, take years, vaccinated eventually.  deadly younger patients still worry

I even think worry word here. We'll still need aware, focus needs vaccinations continued restrictions. Meanwhile plebs told can't go back normal. people shame mock us. 

Shoot Tampa Bay mayor caught maskless Superbowl saying would go maskless people police. reached levels absurdity never thought possible. outdoor boat parade Tampa Lightning Stanley Cup back fall. projected super spreader event reverse progress city seen people outside wearing masks.

There demonstrable increase cases. Link data? I’m desperately hoping (domestic) trip planned boyfriend May graduation go ahead. 

With vaccination rates vulnerable hospitals fine neither us high risk. disagree - basically ignoring science completely amazes me. morning radio looks like mexico well. even new cases dropping. looking forward getting vaccine qualify. think people stupid enough really fuck up. think even getting hit head two four good part America really figured yet. Wife frontline medical got 2nd shot yesterday moderna. definitely feeling 1 day 1.5 day side effects. son kept room gets tested today due exposure made aware of. work long time (cruise ship related income)It nice go away eventually.. PS bitching, consider lucky. neighbors tell ""This go away election"" think may readjusted story inauguration now. What's rationale thinking US much higher rate undiagnosed COVID cases Israel.


Israel 700,000 confirmed COVID cases. Multiply (328/9) get 25.5M. far US's 27.7M. Great Sweden litterally targeting groups scientists dare speech homocidal experiment.

Can something done country already? Seriously danger everyone, suggestions regarding crimes humanity really hope goes through. Sweden need serious ""denazification"" esque movement. population brainwashed beyond belief honestly sad see.

Sweden also needs get thrown international cooperations. Now. here. I’m ready able go classes They're often like what? often make straw man arguments believe we're going lockdown forever/life never become normal again? state income tax low I'd content. I'm content paying double triple people states pay issues have... California makes fortune businesses here. best schools, roads, cleanest cities nicest public transportation country. Instead near bottom many categories. Superbowl weekend. sure we’re going see continued drops 2 weeks super bowl parties :/ fact fact we're seeing positivity rate rapidly decreasing well number positives suggests we're pretty good job testing considering. We're longer state lot testing really going needed part actually happening... end game. likely largely done US 3 4 months. still think things opening like back normal somewhere may 1 early June range. Less handful cases. Contradicts mancolds theories ?? thought ""legit"" (/s) colds certainly terrible... asking Americans give delay opportunity get vaccinated order provide opportunity someone else another country get vaccinated.  seems reasonable ask whether you, asking us get vaccinated, vaccinated.  nothing ""personal responsibility"".   asking country... country one would benefit vaccine transfer? Yikes. Sounds like graduated summa cum laude too. Man u judging China's COVID19 situation move UK ???? 

mean offense logic confusing somehow hilarious confirm going ok sooner rather later. trust confirmation, okay? good insured. Exotic treatments often expensive, especially they're new. Plus insurance automatically adjusts, tries to, health risk predictions like healthy eating good doctor check results like. someone mentioned weight loss, people freedom wish many willing pay cost pleasure. economic cost, physical emotional ones. suppose California could like nations tax unhealthy foods place warning labels it, ban outright. would likely cause opposition among people eat those, moderation pleasure dick still since Harambe someone please help find pants I’d hate germany right now. I’m sure lots honest brilliant russian scientists. govt untrustworthy nefarious gets. log upvote handling, deserves negative! :) Right probably getting 40% total cases. seems truly symptomatic cases fewer thought maybe 15 20% total. lot cases called asymptomatic even fact like cold like probably another 20-25 percent... know frustrated look whole picture. death rate 2% take consideration considerable hospitalization rate long term affects virus. hospitalization rate real issue. saw states holidays, hospitals clogged Covid people risk serious illness, rooms, supplies, staff, EMS, etc. young healthy person appendix burst gets car accident, life literally risk due delay care. can't get situation again. happened even mask mandates restrictions restaurants, bars, curfews, etc. imagine would happened that? People died Covid, would died due delay care everything else too. ran Emergency rooms divert patients. saw people die waiting hospital ER's 6-8-10 hours without care. real, hoax exaggeration. get majority high risk people vaccinated, able open worry hospital overcrowding younger people giving older family members. like flu younger people part. Well listen, agree spread really low, etc, make sense less restrictive. 

The problem wit idea that, certain date, would act differently matter what. actually position, agreement. numbers US today? Show work shame favorite bands gone wind never toured begin. OP comment specific, nice try though. Good approach anything increase uptake vaccinations. people find comfort knowing religious leaders endorse vaccines use religious buildings vaccine centres Even though vaccine huh ? really interesting recall people predicting case counts would actually *rise* due people hanging indoors. misremembering? 

Super neat anyways. I'm stoked good news. always thought otherwise, curious, us men like cared, manflu mancold etc things... declare act given circumstances. Given circumstances similar projected be...thats acting then. Whats wrong putting line sand accept? Academics humanities often like this. work them. seem troubled. hope whatever pain mental anguish right subsides. best you. Long haul lol. mean post-viral syndrome? Love media renames thing make sound nefarious nature.  Yup, do. God bless America Vaccines don’t side effects show within first months. thing leave body. It’s like long term medication things develop months later. Cases dropping literally easy targets left infect. *absolutely* hope. I'm going play doctor say absolutely *will* OK, based upon mathematical odds things favor. Also, treatment knowledge COVID come long way early days.

Still, important remain aware symptoms, keep close eye changes time, plan things become serious. Universal health care would good start. sure doesnt sound like Spring timeline given

Well 1) Spring timeline 100 million vaccines. 2) need 300 million, need old people high risk people vaccinated, open deaths hospitalizations fall cliff. true, media failed public this, local state guidelines misled us. science pretty solid beginning. Dicks Covid. Former British colonies like Brazil Don’t care. Reporting means took heart. I’m glad did. 

Glad know aren’t smart enough aren’t smart enough even attempt refute points.

You aren’t good person. You’re person extremes. 

Everyone see right nonsense, don’t worry. 

Not replying again. Enjoy life privilege selfishness. Guess cant read, title say **new cases**.

It says **new covid deaths** states **cases 100k** first time factually wrong.

I see came thinking clever read wrote always look idiot. simply enough. Young teachers risk getting older sicker people also work public aren't. Excess deaths happen would teachers expedited. seems little petty treat someone literally giving life annoyance wait line. nanobots taking brain bro Cases dropping like lead balloon. Vaccine rollout gaining steam. April. Oof I'm sorry guys. I'm 29, married, pets, work home. social isolation rough, nearly bad guys it. 

I can't imagine happening college, really social golden years. really hope wraps soon everyone. People forget data could quite easily turned way around adenovirus based vaccines extremely high efficacy mRNA ones high less so.

There reliable way know phase 3 results. title ------------cringe No, means influenced lot export bans countries, EU within borders. EU even finalized order NovaVax vaccines. Although final stages process, happen moment now. deal 100 million doses option 100 million additional doses now, think. start Q2 deliveries EU. Could somebody confirm gonna ok sooner later? SA variant arrived Ireland today, heard crappy AstraZeneca news wanna hug friends fly Greece German found wont happening year Lol, people listen new round Lockdowns anyway, overestimating amount people accept forever. literally zero evidence support this. Pfizer/Moderna said they’ll 200 million doses end March another 200 million doses end may June respectively. J&amp;J said 100 million doses end June. Let’s say production schedule linear J&amp;J distribution mid March 

End March: 200 million mRNA + 14 million J&amp;J (114 million people)
J&amp;J rate: 100 million/3.5 months = 28.5 million/month
Pfizer rate: 100 million/2 months = 50 million month
Moderna rate: 100 million/3 months = 33 million month
April: 283 million mRNA, 42 million J&amp;J (180 million people)
May: 366 million mRNA, 70 million J&amp;J (253 million people) (Pfizer done)
June: 400 million mRNA, 100 million J&amp;J (300 million people)

Very rough estimates keep mind major lag production distribution. top major lag first dosage actual immunity. estimates used assumed zero lag production distribution crazy assumption, production schedule linear know it’s ramping accelerating. Meaning numbers way overestimating actual doses administered end April. would wager we’ll much closer 120 million people vaccinated April 180 million referenced would happen perfect conditions. sure workers going ones least likely able vaccinated due less schedule flexibility. cases keep decreasing low levels maybe remains seen. I’m saying masks forever certainly past summer people here’s expectations vaccine timetable based reality. people able get vaccinated April meaningful sense. may much better estimate. may eligible get vaccine may hard actually procure appointment. may get easier find demand also greatly increase people become eligible. People saying well done masks may psyching disappointment. Ugh I'm way, need give break haha would like play lottery odds. tell that. recently spotted pro-lockdown person thinking whole sub filling nothing covid deniers, not. Especially post involving remembrance loved ones. Even replies. there’s good chance FDA going approve it

Has actual indication speculation part? believe people died COVID lockdowns anywhere feel free prove wrong. (and guarantee dying starvation from... restaurants shutting down?) saying ""shit"" general thing negative context. Although got bit annoying every day get reason small scale use Singulair hospitalized patients early suggested improved prognosis sure ever became widely used treatment. make feel tiny bit hopeful potential prognosis ever catch though since take literally ever day. publicly funded like vaccines? No. Nothing ""morality"". practicality fact. want avoid inevitable failure USA quit deadbeat fork money withheld 96% humanity sleazy opt COVAX program last year. Cough free rider. end nobody cares past actions future actions accord *reality*. Chug many vaccines want facilities USA. Nobody cares, duty help others. leech eventually rebound detriment USA even gives warm fuzzy feeling 'taking care own', even 'taking care' inevitably fail whether USA citizens like not. actual fuck wrong people

That's I'm asking read post. get sentiment, need make sure balance here. can't bankrupt people destroy businesses, cause Lockdown depression, etc. ""save one life"" thing.

I think accept covid risk factor limited deaths probably never going away....so someone still get die. way stop deaths elimination it....the it'd take intense Lockdowns literal years decade.

So maximizing good outcomes, that's summer seems like good spot. Deaths lot hospitalizations following sincr vaccines 95-100% effective stopping death hospitalizations. However, lot people pushing back Lockdowns point, staying shut irresponsible do. hope that’s case right there’s data supporting taking multiple vaccines - hope changes right assume it’s “one shot” deal idea. assume whatever want it, since they're private business. account numbers? guys peaked winter like everywhere America numbers dropped dramatically, compared live California. guess could say restrictions, variant strong, make sense would drop quickly. many cases virus, numbers match news reports. one narrative numbers never discussed. That's Uk variant correct? I'm assuming South African variant still small all?  worry right, one likes circlejerk people like us. also never admit they're wrong, even though like said, we're obviously repeating pattern. would “shit”? get it’s gesture still maybe made day healthcare staff hard. Yes long term consequences could bad:

“patients who've COVID-19 symptoms show severe chest X-ray every time, asymptomatic show severe chest X-ray 70% 80% Gaslighting means saying something (even isn't) much people believe so. case, talked much covid real take precautions killed congressman. ate onion, speak. think people stopped going tests. moment. reported incivility. i’m sorry right choose type vaccine want triggering justify attacked. take breath calm down. Online classes seriously joke, atleast College. one gives damn lmao. Smallish surge? superbowl 7 days later valentine's. People infected weekend able show symptoms day 2 even symtomatic.

Let alone secondary infections idiots went super bowl parties get family's next days capable contagious. people capable contagious time V day. refuse u want, kick u let u in. Problem solved Oh boy, gets hand shit another ten years. Freeeeeddooooom! could see spike couple ish weeks super bowl Valentine's Day gatherings / outings. I'm hopeful downward trend continue. hopefully huge spring break spike ahead. post mardi gras saint patrick's related spikes. Group B. Never got it, fully vaccinated. Sorry that. would people continue wearing masks vaccines widespread? whole point masks slow spread covid pandemic, hospitals get overwhelmed. vaccines widespread covid becomes less threat flu. Mask wearing choice business likes make money

I mean they'll ""strongly-encouraged"" government company mandated enforced. cabs high  That’s sucks temper true feelings China fear censorship moderators! New pharmaceutical companies making BioNTech vaccine disappointing?

Basically EU shifted gears AZ delivery stance, well UK stance vaccine production.

EU right thing go mRNA.  evidence vaccine good harm. opposite vaccine, reliable tool fight virus that’s basically affected every aspect life, nothing except masks, distancing, etc

Doing nothing fear going solve anything. 

It’s ever worse minority groups suffering coronavirus. guess irrelevant anti-vaxxers. Good. worried dropping AZ without real backup plan I'm wondering everyone left sub come believe power magical thinking. hold hands, click heels together, say ""there's place like normal"" somehow whole thing disappear.

I genuinely hoping someone answer question explains realistically outperform current vaccination trendline (from pfizer moderna). math wrong? miss fantastic press release doubling capacity next week? (yes! oh wait no, that's probably doubling eventually, next week, gotta READ article) related cohort 'half dose' 'full dose'. Originally thought potentially half dose led higher efficacy quite confused why. UK's Joint Committee Vaccination immunisation looked data relatively certain fact due 3 month gap doses one reasons recommended dosing strategy UK currently using. think seditious traitor nice? everyone wants blow $10 drink drinks mason jar coastal city restaurant filament bulb distressed wood table listening “indie” bands. this, I'm scared Government (of countries) disease itself. way MSM drumming constant fear porn, I'm getting serious 9/11 vibes... Younger people tend spread disease still vaccinated Israel. 

Also, one dose vaccine seem prevent transmission (as evidenced viral load) infected. Two weeks second dose appear prevent transmission still testing positive. (Of course one dose still effect since prevent infections altogether.)

Deaths gone somewhat Israel starting point might expected to--two weeks second dose 65+ folks. wrong. wouldn’t care went point point.

You’re incredibly unreasonable. potential end pandemic year vaccine. That’s never happened before. pandemic lasts 2-6 years.

We seeing selfishness man right now. Since covid mainly affects old sick we’re seeing weird gross thought process people encouraging reopening shouldn’t worry covid.

History won’t judge kindly. Thank God world leaders scientists disagree taken control measures we’re seeing. Calling mask fatigue selfishness doesn’t make go away. may wish masks driver pandemic fatigue think they’re effective personally don’t mind wearing them, fact many people mind them. It’s irrelevant whether makes selfish stupid, is. Many people hate masks won’t wear unless forced. comes Western cope, lol. would Daddy Fauci told would save grandma might lucky 25% vaccinated April 1st. near enough curb original virus, let alone, much contagious new strains. could something would worry about, reality see side-effects vaccines, generally see anything significant within first two it’s isn’t possible, absolutely imperative go study beyond two months every single one vaccines that’s looked at. within two months generally see anything significance rarely find anything significance two months No, I'm specifically talking leak theories. actual geneticists people expertise field think leak scenario plausible. layman's theory, scientific one.

As example, complex mutation chain indicates variety intermediate hosts suggests endemic transmission wild rather anything laboratory based. Newer vaccines. Yeah. UFC's 10's athletes post-COVID really staggering in-cage drop offs. Even cases fight's postponed 2 weeks. vaccinations, natural immunity large percentage people infected winter. got fever, fever dreams lol.  Well everyone balance risk unknown desire live happy life. Like know I'm going get car accident eat bad piece shrimp still drive go eat.

But medical spokespeople interest striking balance, take extreme position think prevent illness. like asking barber need haircut, answer always ""yes"". Canada one biggest contributors Covax, giving $440 million. Half money secure doses itself, half developing world. vaccination passports really make much sense experts saying could spread virus even receiving vaccine right? would point still spread even vaccine.  vaccine rollout continues, we'll keep learning people certain predispositions adverse events following vaccination. reference, came learn people thymic disorders suffer yellow fever vaccine–associated viscerotropic disease get yellow fever vaccine. Nobody freaked canceled YF vaccinations. Instead, like vaccine, state get YFV Thymus.

Let’s take ‘ugly’ assumption covid mutate something - bypasses neutralizing antibodies - something bypasses arms human immune response doesn’t reduce severity virus. assumption make say mutations could overwhelm hospital system. 

1) evidence right support mutations could this? answer no, really don’t know scenario used null hypothesis 

2) respiratory virus history ever mutated version dangerous, severe it’s novel strain respect effect immune system? get flu every year? mutates something get past neutralizing antibodies become re-infected. never severe first time population exposed strain even though population reinfected? immune systems learned fight type virus without needing go overdrive.

Yes. Covid *could* mutate strain infects post vaccination also yields severe bodily response. But, much evidence suggesting 2022’s strain influenza *could* mutate something stronger completely blows past previous immunity. monitor this? Absolutely. assumption *definitely* happen take precautions prevent it? No, probably not. recovered? Congratulations! Free vaccine! It’s already dropping, COVID-19 mortality US plummet April 1. vaccines good. We’ll still worry circulating among young people, least won’t 3k people dying per day. hundreds millions doses 95% effective vaccines coming online next months think answer ""probably"" not? Right.

2. Sure chance people dying reasons COVID happens.
3. young child COVID died completely unrelated issue like lottery winning ticket chance, bad way.

So saying coincidence would died anyhow COVID? what's point planning date give? useful information give know probably nothing change April 15th?

Novavax Johnson &amp; Johnson also sequenced test samples clinical trial participants South Africa, B.1.351 caused vast majority cases, reported lower efficacy United States.

If anyone cares provide source saying something different would appreciate it. would genuinely prefer good news point. However, seen os bunch quotes various companies saying anticipated vaccine still effective, that's thing **demonstrating** equivalent effectiveness. Looks like putting mask on? Agreed, countries EU agreed

It seems minority EU members wanted mRNA, initially. Even end order doses eligible Yes, blame person actively denied severity responsible said politicization virus. Donny dumbass responsible happend US. also responsible spreading misinformation globally said virus.  Wow. Good point blame nonetheless got really excited actual title article, :/ 

*Sigh* getting really tired good articles negative headlines. mean, look US; new cases started sharp decline second week January continues plummet, new deaths peaked start decline remain plateau weeks later (despite top couple posts sub would believe based single Sunday's numbers). 

Even new deaths started decline today, would almost month lag. still people peak recover dying off, post-peak medical facilities staff effective time recover. lead mistake shortage related deaths things normalize. Well they're going little different, even pfizer Moderna mRNA ones. try thing, show body spike protein, maybe variation achieved produces slightly different results? 

I'm guessing here, would bet genetic make mRNA strands various vaccines different produce slightly different spike protein. viral vector vaccines, I'm guessing they're limited variation protein produced since adenovirus vector vaccines seem work well multiple variants. would bet protein subunit vaccines problem since they're injecting straight lab produced spike protein arm. 

The good news seems like we're lucky mRNA since Moderna already started testing booster targeting new variants. Pfizer announced they're going reducing batch time 100 days 60 days starting month. Hopefully end year plenty vaccine+booster entire world. Quite opposite. Massive underreaction.

The countries done best went hard start, ""overreacted"" shortened length, breadth number lockdowns required.

The countries among worst ignored build tidal wave, either locked down, meaning double-fucked economies... first slow attrition, extended repeated lockdowns - or, know, fuck lockdowns economy something something.

What idiots realize economy going get fucked either way pandemic. choose short sharp, long drawn out. I'd say there's ample evidence way smarter now. Governments didn’t expect many people refuse COVID vaccines.

I agree lot vaccines probably donated poor countries, especially prevent Chinese gaining influence. think need adjust goals something achievable. 

Zero transmission going happen. friggin *cold virus.*

Making moderate severe Covid disease rare *is* possible. done many times 2020 decisive emergency action, vaccine trials show mass vaccination able replace masking contact tracing.

Researchers come conclusion anti-lockdown demonstrations Leipzig Berlin November superspreader events Germany.

On November day, people push way center Leipzig, mostly without distance mask. Many so-called “lateral thinkers” (Querdenker) make comfortable picnic blankets folding chairs middle streets, central Augustusplatz big enough crowd. police lost control. Police officers ended demonstration 20,000 40,000 people, hours later thousands demonstrators march unhindered city.

A similar picture emerges days later Berlin. Opponents corona measures want prevent new infection protection law government quarter November 18. Stones, bottles firecrackers fly - 77 police officers injured. Water cannons drive front Brandenburg Gate.

Here, too, mixture “lateral thinkers” conspiracy ideologues, well esotericists, right-wing extremists, citizens Reich general critics corona policy adhere obligation wear mouth nose protection keep distance. police dissolve gathering 5,000 9,000 people three hours dozens warnings, eviction lasts evening.

It clear two anti-lockdowns demonstrations Corona Superspreader events. rallies canceled, 16,000 21,000 Covid-19 infections could prevented Christmas.

This result current study ZEW Mannheim Humboldt University Berlin. scientists examined seven-day incidence developed districts high proportion corona deniers.

Three factors superimposed: proportion AfD voters area, party consistently denies dangers virus. compared measles vaccination rate district level bus stops ""Honk Hope"" network.

Many lateral thinkers (Querdenker) use buses network self-styled Corona critic Thomas Kaden come demonstrations Germany. bus network differs significantly lines comparable bus operators. ""Honk Hope"" stops Germany, many smaller cities also served. One focus south Saxony, north Bavaria east Thuringia.

With factors, authors study come conclusion two demonstrations Leipzig Berlin, seven-day incidence increased significantly districts cities served “Honk Hope” network.

Compared counties without stops, around 40 higher average Christmas. example, incidence rose 60 100 city without stop, rose 60 140 period city B stop.

""We see data ten twelve days demonstrations incidence bus stop counties increasing sharply,"" says study author Martin Lange Tagesspiegel. ""Because even people Leipzig Berlin, assume Leipzig demonstration also greater effect number infections.""

Lange want single individual districts name phone. clearly recognizable incidence increasing strongly, especially small towns bus stop. “We interpret mean place quite small, still bus stop like this, must particularly high proportion corona denier demonstration participants therefore also plausible infection numbers increased demonstrations, ” explains Lange. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

And US: 83,400 cases 980,229 US. That's positivity rate 8.5%.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think virus made lab. I'm seeing evidence outside circumstantial coincidences seem strong enough. Everything I've seen leads believe virus evolved naturally. anyone get evidence contrary, I'd happy take look it, time nothing I've seen convinced deliberately created.

That said, think investigation convince anybody anything. all. First all, outbreak occurred well year ago, time China fought tooth nail avoid kind independent investigation. Secondly, World Health Organization reputation cooperating China detriment rest world *on specific virus.* Lastly, China reputation lying virus, get political reputation lying general.

It's definitely appropriate investigation happened eventually entire thing comes across pointless me. think anyone fence origins virus going convinced China organization says whatever China wants agreed China it. There's real credibility problem here. People trust WHO, people trust China, people absolutely trust statements China. would different? agreeing bad study was. 

I pointing that, contra said, know something demographics, makes overall point even stronger. People seeing significant they’ve likely seeing regularly anyway? Ehhhhhhh blue line rate tests return positive. decline cases result decline testing rate positive results would go up. restrict testing people cut disproportionately unlikely positive Interesting 50 articles saying thing. 

Did anyone expect anything else come this?

We text stuff, whole experience feels like fever dream point. better? Sinovac's overall efficacy 50.4% mainly healthcare workers studies showing much higher effucacies. 

It better comes cost though. vAcCiNe MaKeS StErIlE!1!oNe! study linked mention masks single time. produce single study suggesting masks slow spread COVID-19? Wearing masks much important washing hands. COVID-19 primarily spread shared breathing space. stay homes complain want. rest world move without them. attitude backwards, also surprising. Apparently still haven’t learned repeatedly obviously lying public isn’t great way earn trust cares them, though? JnJ also said goes 100% 49 days hope wrong, though think right. Based AstraZeneca trials looks like vaccines significantly reduce eliminate transmission risk. vaccinated lot things become reasonable before, still good idea mindful possibility exposing others. Yeah, go hug grandkids vaccinated, invite vaccinated friends dinner, too. probably good idea go old-folks home start coughing everyone. thinking terms sheer numbers, I'm inclined guess correct infection pathway involve farming sort; given frequency human contact seems likely direct transmission wild animal. research team included members multiple countries including US. People act private company, international body. US conspiracy blame China smart people ""get it""? 600K people additionally died that's mitigation everyone complaining about. Without 'hated' mitigation could reached millions. estimated excess deaths could reduce life expectancy America huge statistical impact events happened span one year. 

We argue correct stats methods legitimate argument. numbers show huge deal downplayed. acknowledge painful everyone fact remains huge problem nothing would turned dial millions absolutely monsterous. 

That's every country mitigating. ones nothing either turned back admitted took wrong strategy (Sweden) total denial either cover mode. broad multi country conspiracy. Literally every advanced/educated country wrong this. problem real. Cool. Thanks this. I’ll look. Right cue! official death rate US 1.8%. Mind children adults. look 18 closer 9% (CDC statistics). Even consider many scientists believe every one positive test 3 positives tested resulting death rate much lower, first 4-5 months pandemic recognized many people dying micro clots brain, heart, kidney's etc many death attributed heart attacks strokes attributed Covid may balance difference. far healthcare workers losing jobs due lack patients, please quote references ridiculous. hospital except maybe remote areas Alaska small rural areas laid anyone pandemic. Right one reasons can't vaccinate alot people enough nurses. Many states contacted nurses, vet chiropractic clinics asking volunteers saying train clinical health care provider give injections. know fact I'm RN. many hospitals overloaded went diversion (diverting EMS hospitals) across country. nurse friends acquaintances across country every single one knew closures overloading. fact occurred even though doctors surgeons restricted necessary surgeries, elective surgeries cancelled months surgical nurses floated work medical floors. Even now, waiting serious neck surgery two months. hospital still 30% Covid occupancy double post surgical patients inpatient rooms. high risk Covid surgeon want operate go back private rooms due risk infection roommate. hospitals post overcrowded understaffed want panic people also used lawsuits. (Again, ran two emergency room 10 years fully aware hospitals work) woefully misinformed posting, research reputable medical sites information. think behavior big one.

I think people US become compliant end here. They're final push. going give holidays vaccine like maybe going roll point FDA finally got together, see happening they're content waiting last months. see pretty clearly post history don’t think schools open all. news going report outbreaks ignore schools well really least concerning part wrong. sequence it, clearly say clearly say 90% cases entire trial variant. truth. 

We’re going hit tipping point vaccine going stop seeing unilateral restrictions. Basically, virus around, social restrictions lifted. Shove ducks mouth Thanks sharing. article also suggests one dose might provide 90% efficacy 21 days, goes thought previously. Crazy think almost year, we're still finding new things every day. correct thinking along lines, done kind statistical analysis anything, would think vaccine ineffective nearly 40% people vaccinated would expect lot 3% deaths vaccinated people. True, we're final stretch. need burn masks yet (even though people basically already are). Things hopefully improving dramatically April so. “By measures, five vaccines — Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax Johnson &amp; Johnson — look extremely good. roughly 75,000 people received one five research trial, single person died Covid, people appear vaccine makes able resist Covid: make immortal.

Unless government officials completely talking ass, COVID vaccines everyone available next months. We're near finish line. need hold course. Yeah. That's never take anything sub says seriously. truth never far left far right. often hides middle. Bro better now-infamous ""Pfitzer cut COVID19-vaccine production.... TIME!"" 🥳👉👉👉 bigger story 3% covid DEATHS Israel past month people got vaccinated? say much effectiveness vaccine. vaccinated, way. continues belief. think engineered anything, think escaped containment studied. I'm guy reddit. constantly run headlines like “The pandemic won’t 2025” “masks social distancing us forever,” people get upset angry fuels conspiracy theories anti-vaccine anti-mask movements. Creating much fear media causes non-compliance makes people feel less inclined follow guidelines. several possibilities note likely transmission intermediate animal. never said arrived China via frozen food. people try understand people saying, please. given time passed anyone really believe found anything meant find? course bobble head Joe nod head swallow whole. It’s popular internet ground level lost credibility. enough blood analysis storage virus spreading nov 2019?

Not Wuhan. like failed understand said. Re-read try again. engage someone either intentionally dishonest arguments outright trolling. That’s normal tho? see, everyone exp strong reactions second shot. It’s weird someone exp strong reaction first shot guess vaccine developed Kremlin. know develop tumor liver example 5-10 years now? Hey, you. Yeah, you. sacrificed lot past year want take opportunity *completely selfish* tell something missed past year bitter about, complained compared people actual problems big deal. little comment thread reprieve that.

For me, obstacle course racing. registered six races 2020 busted ass putting miles cold winter hours gym get ready. pr'd deadlift February 2020 probably best shape life ready spring, summer, fall taking races. I've able keep running whole time kept grounded mentally, like I've truly lost much progress anything. running actual races fun life still hate able them. 

Clearly people bigger problems. People lost loved ones, jobs, houses, etc. mean minimize compare first-world problem those. think okay take moment selfish lost past year. What's story? Richie Allen lmao

Y’all post articles written children fits narrative That's comment article. actual study. Reading article hard. one thing got wrong early thought steroids big reason. advice early from. China way everyone took gospel. Even cdc trainings telling medical folks avoid it. 

Idk thought like first 6-7 months bc true would invalidate lot established science. suspect delayed looking asthma stuff. never made sense me. interviewed lab folks state officials, told wasn't. 

""Welp, guess lab then. Case closed. Great work everybody!"" 

LOL. frozen food transmission idea seems utterly, utterly bonkers.

The fact giving credence idea worrying. Hopefully it’s placate CCP Christ it’s reach. asking people sacrifice business years experience industry, time pay. [Fauci made Donald Trump last year terms public employee pay, spare 100+ million people taken vaccine. 

If find random 100 million people roughly 1 million die within next year. death every 30 seconds. even factor vaccine currently used risk people higher chance death regardless. 


So say hi 100 million random people 50 likely die within 25 minuteshi, mean saying hi killed them. Sorry say would feel bad Covid nails - people like reason businesses shut - - kind job, would open right now. I've covid. 

Lost sense smell. returned everything smells different. sense taste gone. almost 4 months. long distance girlfriend C visit her, soft home, rarely around brothers sisters Oh trust I’ve seeing shit took since even summer. sub 100% compromised *some* capacity. It’s shame propaganda actors taken ahold social media point even what’s supposed fact based sub became target.

Hold onto hope sanity. You’re crazy seeing you’re seeing. dust settles future see shaped Actual infections much higher confirmed cases, pretty obvious lot people dont get tested asymptomatic, mild symptoms, live somewhere getting test difficult worth effort. lost credibility. anyone take proclaim seriously? Yes, Communism quite popular right India. happens economy stagnates long people think State controlled agriculture actually makes sense despite century total failures usually result famines genocides brutal authoritarian regimes. 

Strangely Maoism still supporters. parents got appointment 2nd dose got 1st dose, there's 10 week gap. Thats exactly it. friend like too, regular sore arm like shot would give you. interesting wide range symptoms  r/conspiracy users lmao  That's gonna happen tens millions people anything. really notable. organization COVID-19 transmissible person person.

They literally never said this. said evidence (until did). That's science works. comment got censored, agree feel like end. 40 million people US alone taken vaccine. vaccines safe. would seeing small handful people dying taking it. Wow, sounds terrible!! body really working hard though :) Least know it’s good kind pain Almost 8. Pretty certain not. original research paper anyone interested[Persistence evolution SARS-CoV-2 Immunocompromised It’s dismissed, prioritized people dying. vaccines here, patient. understand hard end unknown almost Sounds like really much confidence stance. bet believe impossible get food right? someone covid sneezed pad thai would do? worry can't get way? prediction low-quality? conform approved message sub? cost vaccines marginal compared benefit society. profit vaccine capture small fraction value. 

In case, you’re going get ‘good deal’ point time it’s demand product world. countries delayed signing try get price delay admit vaccine timelines far out. one proposed could zero COVID cases everyone actually social distanced people animals virus dies human population. 

This well within realm utopian thought. zero chance everyone Earth socially distance effectively long enough SARS-CoV-2 virus goes extinct. simply world works. could say thing gonorrhea. everyone Earth agreed pop antibiotics day abstained sex two weeks, could eliminate gonorrhea. that's happening, sorts reasons, notably nature human beings. utopian delusion think cooperate sacrifice greater good. 

Jigshingyongnan, know country live communist country, language communist propaganda. rings extremely hollow people indoctrinated communist ideology children. marketing slogan.

I'm sorry credibility went became China's puppet. take year investigate pandemic? Wuhan month 1 2 year later. good useless can't prove efficacy. civil. case 'not liking it' though, lying it. Saying loads people dying it, getting lung damage etc. spread false rumours people would libel. According actual data, refusal vaccinate higher among black hispanic demographics republicans. need know spread immunocompromised family members. it’s possible I’m traveling see Eastern kentucky. gotta drive 19 miles arcade Pullman square WV. article horrific, simply piece journalism. Feels like written either 13-year-old, AI someone writing experience. huge downer I'd rather dentist focus stuff right - see patients either regular check-ups dental issues. extremely hard see dentists given health restrictions like. Passing law generate view dentist vaccinating people instead taking care dental needs.

There studies 10% health issues driven poor oral care. starts seeing dentists. That's understood adenovirus vaccines (e.g. J&amp;J, Oxford AstraZeneca). thought way worked similar mRNA vaccines, viral vector delivering spike mRNA cells rather lipid nanoparticles.

How understood work modified adenovirus spike proteins make look like coronavirus immune system, bit also ability infect human cells cause cells produce spike protein get expressed cell surface, causing immune system attack cells. 

I understood Moderna Pfizer directly supply mRNA via lipid nanoparticles get taken cells used produce spike protein, rather using viral vector achieve goal.

Am misunderstanding something? mine virtual since August, areas really fine. close schools one teach kids, kids attend quarantined in-district positivity 40% one point. like anything else. One area fine another area devestated. need start using actual data resources make choices. close schools Florida state California burning wildfires. approached way, get front stay there. Far early vaccines make cases drop like that.  It’s wave cresting.

Previous waves less synchronised around world. (One location would up, another down.)

I think one ended synchronised due holidays.  Could pure seasonal effects random, money would holiday gatherings. got second Moderna last week. sore arm one day soreness actually bad first shot. symptoms besides arm soreness shots. Obviously. original research paper anyone interested[place Drawing conclusions mid-investigation... believe one second. WHO's fault fucking thing beginning allowing Chinese government feed line bullshit. want ask people would touch something infected person coughed rub eyes, mean really believe can't get infected way full shit?

No, would knowingly touch something known infected person touched purposefully rub eyes. would outright ridiculous insane.

There HUGE difference recognizing rarely spreads touch real world (while still acknowledging physically possible) described. insane made statement, intellectually honest. ridiculous take Russia there's still sign deaths declining.

In Sweden suffered 4x-10x many deaths per million neighbours, brilliant strategy. clickbait. want ask people would touch something infected person coughed rub eyes, mean really believe can't get infected way full shit?

Again, *possible* could've originated elsewhere, data really support that... Yh original variant UK variant. we've seen South african variant causing issues. J&amp;J/Nivavax said vaccines still effective greatly reduces efficiency although J&amp;J measured moderate severe symproms.

Bingo, jackpot!

I'm myself, ""smart"" guy. 
Because want economy recover faster. 
And want lockdowns anymore. 
And want infected infect somebody else. 
So wear mask stop spread.

But concept complicated you, see. 
Because reason see wearing masks ""Daddy Fauci says"". 
You think masks politics. 
Like many rednecks do. 
And ""cool free man"" (read ""uneducated redneck, unable build logical connection facts""), certainly refuse masks. Yeah they’re sick live somewhere huge amount air pollution, every time step public fresh air 4-5 days, wow that’s long time symptoms! body really working hard, that’s great! That’s good you’re ready second dose, hopefully won’t bad you!! exciting vaccinated, good luck you! hell stimulus approved yet. civil. Boohoo excess deaths 270k end Nov, slightly ahead Mexico. obvious ages figures wildly wrong. trying say point?

Because pretty obvious desperate ""keep Lockdown going"" posts small vocal group wants stay forever. role COVID-19 vaccines may ultimately akin flu shot: reducing hospitalizations deaths mitigating disease’s severity. COVID-19 vaccines whole excellent preventing severe disease, level protection far seems hold even new coronavirus variant found South Africa causing reinfections. This, rather herd immunity, achievable goal vaccines. “My picture endgame will, fast can, start taking people harm’s way” vaccination, says Marc Lipsitch, epidemiologist Harvard. virus still circulates, fewer people die.

I’m pretty sure people expecting. predict vulnerable protected vaccine hospitals won’t risk overrun, world able open.

We haven’t able protect people isolation that’s possible sustain anyway. vaccines administered properly get us social distancing measures can’t reach. end. People anxiety panic disorders triggered wearing masks makes hard breathe body tell something feels wrong. likely panic attacks public isn’t little thing. Masks go point relatively soon. Well young niece immunocompromised, I’d like visit her. need know can’t spread it. can, I’m going visit her, can’t, Exactly!! Burn baby burn!!!

Nothing protests, guess protesters might live, I'll wait peer reviewed journal making conclusions. point she’s mom? 
Would dad? Who. Cares?

Again, New Zealand, Taiwan even Singapore using program get vaccines themselves. They're poor countries getting vaccines it. Vulnerable countries benefit, donors. 

Covax basically insurance policy pay guarantee supply. happened way around happy get help. Society work keep asking ""what's me, me?"" Yeah, burn building something extreme? Aren’t pretty damn close risk offered vaccine?

How defining ""at risk""?

Everyone nursing homes healthcare? Yeah, might close.

All senior citizens? Anyone critical comorbidity? seem like it. I've never stated opinion, looking take offer, friend! 

Mind linking papers now? 

That vitamin reduce covid transmission symptom severity healthy individuals compared healthy individuals lack vitamin D? 

Just wanted take offer, pal! Already given 60% country least one shot. peak flu season February. almost year since sniffer dogs first tried. fuck almost every corner US elsewhere?  Good. anti vax disgusting person, go start shit version FB tot spout verbal diarrhea There's talk ""vaccine passports"" today, free exactly thing vaccinated people able do.

Whether you. said: totally free fly planes, eat restaurants, go friends’ houses etc...

People since March 2020 never stopped it. translated article. infections direct result demonstrations. Absolutely. think ridiculous I, 34 year old, moderately annoying time finding vaccine appointment. can't imagine ridiculously convoluted someone 80s tech savvy .  There’s saying barn doors horses comes mind. we're talking immune system harmful (like say, cytokine storm), infection would pretty severe already happens. efficient immune response prevent that. worse case reinfection could immune system weakened, especially person recovered severe infection. Aren’t pretty damn close risk offered vaccine? Anecdotes people risk screwed don’t really mean anything. Lots vaccine hesitant types spreading claims screwed vaccines reality find excuses seek out

We basing able get it. also dealing large group people think aren’t risk 

People think obesity huge factor isn’t average American thinks 1/6 chance dying get covid. wrong. Many people think risk capacity need accommodating fears cost rational people’s freedoms one tell rates car collisions. do... could pedestrian-friendly cities, they're willing pour much money shutting things down, get percent money walkable places? :) retired parents took advice play video games day grocery pickup.

With proper PPE, fine healthy senior citizens go inside supermarket pick groceries.

For worth: Grocery-delivery workers often wear mediocre however younger person work lot elderly people grocery store. Instead specifying age group takes months vaccinate, prioritized elderly people still work like this.

This excellent idea.

Vaccination clinics could look patient's [W-2 (wage statement) [tax Working senior citizens could get priority retired senior citizens.

I wonder might worthwhile suggest local government. Attorney Dennis Herrera added new counts[ existing San Francisco Unified School District, previously alleged school officials failed create specific plan reopening required state law. trust Israel's current Prime Minister much trust Putin.  teach high school Northern California, we've online year. partly agree, also think Biden going beneficiary timing: vaccine taking alongside natural infection get us point herd immunity next months. think ran ""100 days curb spread"" nowhere... think smart people looking data believed would positive inflection point hospitalizations, deaths, infection moderately successful vaccination program. fact animals tested positive buried deep someone unearthed interview think Gao Fu? head china cdc. 

So wanted fake anything would deep sixed interview.  Let check Ministry health website see find anything it. even *high risk* country anymore? agree non-story regarding COVID. discount COVID related bit common sense I'm saying. 90% ""news"" stories subreddit really pretty weaksauce articles lot maybe, perhaps, should, could, likely articles. Yip, died COVID vs died COVID Seems like numbers need analyzed sort conclusion drawn. opinions inferred raw data would seem likely reflection person's priors, opinions based upon new information. sure, like spanish always usual suspect. canine detection pilot programs since nearly start thing none ever seem graduate mainstream use. :( People going lie vaccinated not. way, Americans going lie something serious pandemic. thought idea perceived safety anyone else's responsibility ridiculous beginning, guess makes outlier here. point making sympathy Germany Germans, criticising them. I'm assigning blame credit anyone. Germany suffered less European countries first wave suffered badly second wave. can't see good reason someone tried deny it. large portion Southern California schools closed hybrid. I’m going scroll 50 papers mobile entertain trolling ass. 

What exactly position vitamin d? Mine clear: aids healthy immune system, part healthy lifestyle. disagree premise? not, move along. so, good you, don’t care, FYI opinion unpopular. Pandemic won’t end year, help nonetheless See rent condo cabin hang there. avoid bars, saunas hot tubs. They're mostly closed anyway like even tempting! 

But seriously, go. normal felt months. Exercise outdoors good soul, everyone kind happy &lt;3 Im trying understand downvoted - anti-lockdown/mask rally obviously entitled people attending wearing mask, compared rally marching lives. necessarily helpful. Overactive immune responses big part kills people COVID. always chance could harmful, even. ADE thing viruses. 

I believe reason believe data case COVID overall, proven cases worse time upon reinfection original infection. even more.

I ask question everyday. nice see someone thinking thing. Covid messaging complete total disaster. Gotta cite sources. Forgot cite mine. That's works. finding variants looking them, test cant recognize them. testing. Shocker u/GovSchwarzenegger many viruses known affect ACE2 receptor. 

Also, probably wasn’t fully adapted given quickly virus picked D614G mutation. give oral injections Im going ignorantly assume complex giving one shot arm. inb4 ""if afford travel pandemic afford test!!!!"" 

You easily find round-trip domestic fares $80... hard-pressed find rapid COVID test costs less $100-$120. biggest hill. dwarfed previous surges. drop also going bigger, then. 

Or let put way: US record Jan 8th. Jan. 18th, cases dropped half. 

Are honestly trying tell 10 days, much additional natural immunity cause that? change total number people got infected 10 days absolutely, completely dwarfed number people already infected hit high point. makes zero sense small change overall numbers would huge effect, much larger numbers prior high point didn't. time friends. miss bonfires dinner parties shooting shit people always see regular basis. supposed go Washington DC beginning April 2020. canceled trip :( Let's call hope works                   u/GovSchwarzenegger There's bar nearby city found about, great menu awesome atmosphere. really want go back bar.

Agreed, China let spread US gave booster shot. someone ELI5: natural protection lasts ~3 months event get actual disease -- would vaccine last 8x longer? drop like before, past restrictions IM vaccines like ones currently market generally produce IgA mucosal immunity, still theoretically possible URI infection occur without greater spread within host. infection would still detectable via PCR. agree IgG production triggered vaccines would halt infection rest body, true sterilizing immunity means cannot replicate anywhere. However, believe URI infection would last long post-vaccine CD8+ cells would lyse infected mucosal epithelium regardless.

Thankfully intranasal spray vaccine currently development provide IgA mucosal immunity. I’m sick seeing post. I’ve seen certain family members low risk since April.

God things I’d give go concert right implication? question imply new variants less deadly. issue OPs comments would direct comments actually spouting misinformation. hope pray trend sticks, despite variants.

I remember last year, trying search ""Good News"" flairs here, seeing anything already read / upvoted days prior. 

Yet basically every day, there's pockets good news here.

We this. may travelled frozen food Wuhan accidently leak Wuhan lab drumroll....... studies coronaviruses. Fact given frozen food credence even looking possibility lab leak seems lost credibility. well countries well spring lockdown... time... maybe except USA rise summer, northern hemisfere cases plumeted close nothing, people scared unknown spring months combination strict lockdowns, summer basically back normal. end August beginning September, numbers started rise again, people werent scared already knew mostly olds' sick's disease, despite lockdowns, even harsher compared spring, cases skyrocketer since struggling keep control. Australia differently September, come completely stopped exponencial growth? Maybe warm weather helped, end comes people, want meet socialize, find way. differently, learn? test lot, higher fees violating lockdown rules... somehow communicate better people listen? Right highest tier lockdown, everything closed except essentials, even ski areals closed, barbers closed, cannot outside 9pm... thing left lock people homes close homes shut nonessential factories industry, nobody wants would economical well human catastrophe.... main reason deep sh*t people rebel, dont listen actively go restrictions, mainly govrrnment whole lockdown wrong even senators policians caught multiple times private parties... Israel 74 cases 100k. US 40 cases 100k. Higher infections per capita Israel...almost double. Assuming US, that's ridiculous. quarter 1 2022 everyone US wants vaccine one, half year. guess change mind sees low deaths hospitalizations towns start allow large gatherings. always easiest lose first pounds fat finally commit diet.

It's lot harder people somewhat decent shape already.

(Obviously quite simple think general idea). Yes 100% trusted Totally coincidence.   hero! *swoon* aren't. us it. OP posting question though. give platform evangelize everyone infecting themselves. new variants less virulent, implication fundamentally wrong point evolution Covid. mean surely it'd reasonable hang girlfriend. like going parties stuff, single person seeing... haven't. Pfizer vaccine covers SA variant variants tested far. vaccines work well one worst results still prevents severe hospitalizations deaths. possible change future right spreading misinformation. Lmao. Glad find farcical still saying need keep mitigation measures herd immunity reached. kids vaccinated next, ain’t happening another year. Yeah, no. Yep I've bunch Delta flights never anyone next me. definitely case airlines unless enough empty seats shift people around. That’s relief. stay locked even longer period time newer vaccine needed developed, would disaster. Would want sitting 2 seats away someone Covid regardless? feel like you’re missing point. It’s logical make people get test airport plane crowd people authoritarian porn stay locked bizzare shut lifestyle questioned. ignore him. It’s bad guy. We’re pandemic going end enough people take vaccine. people trying spread “but vaccines bad?!” hysteria unequivocally bad guys here. Go away. calculation people 65 years old die go hospital often Covid, (mostly younger) teachers Sounds like mind made too.

My point really scientists, doctors, etc want respected speak like clickbait article. reserved making broad hyperbolic statements without facts. drop special. 

Look previous surges. almost every one looked fast climb followed slow decline. first fast rise followed equally fast decline. 

Some natural immunity end holidays. vaccines really making difference though risk individuals starting immune. care party stalling what. still getting paid others not. Take pay cut like everyone else. What? think legitimate question. hear lots new variants evade immunity thus prolongs pandemic significantly. raises obvious question happen large pandemics. Seriously. share button driving force crap. Since beginning feel like society fool’s errand eliminate every single COVID virus particle earth. Unless prove we’ve done that, treat every activity even least bit risk like au comment false, useless, illegal. Neckelmann wrote Michael ""very healthy,"" stating delivered many babies pandemic loved community. added Michael ""pro vaccine advocate,"" got himself. cousin got married December.

Hope “health care system” plan deal lifelong mental neurological illnesses chronic diseases causes/triggered entire two generations 30! (And yes, American health care system- socialized health care bear incredible burden years come, even it’s free, find fund many providers treatment programs, drugs... class illnesses never cure never go away?) Nah, goes cycles. I've seen people yell ""natural immunity"" time there's wave drops.... even though later there's another wave. Someone right? think like 10-20% positive cases end type permanent damage? Michael went hospital three days getting first dose Pfizer's mRNA injection noticing petechiae hands feet, Neckelmann wrote Facebook. admitted emergency room, blood test showed platelet count zero, diagnosed ITP. Thanks. Btw great username. Yes, people tested positive covid still want make flights forced find alternative. Laugh, it’s sad reality many people daily. people don’t know exposed didn’t take test yet. 

Airlines worried irate passengers test positive end stranded somewhere. Since course happen since it’s point. People won’t want take risk flying somewhere (such vacation...) might get stuck there. decrease demand air travel.

Everyone knows this. care job, apparently Fauci does, enough take pay cut others twiddle thumbs go debt. got one scarier things I’ve read last 11 months unions North Carolina mix going teachers grave mistake sure way help schools start functioning never seen anyone claim cases vastly overreported. pretty much universal agreement number positive tests less number actual cases since lot people never get tested. 

There issues false positives caused tests picking pieces virus small cause infection. Maybe thinking of?

Regardless, number actual positive tests + number false positive tests still lot smaller total number infections. flew Delta returned American. Delta much better job. Empty center seats hawk eyed cabin staff telling passengers keep mask times. Even interesting, Peter Daszak working closely WIV prior pandemic closely tied gain function research coronaviruses. Pretty cool got job investigate them! know, I’m nurse actually, addressing death rate there. become easily spread, less deadly?

See comment directed mods. honestly grim proposition think people refusing believe it

The people low-risk fatality category used excuse ignore responsibility point refuse accept possibility fact take seriously. mean true lot countries.

Ensuring insurance pay therapy would first step would ensure therapist would paid paid well service provide. would hope pandemic drive many people fields like social work therapy driven public health. 

I think we've already seen start mental health pandemic. large subset population prone agoraphobic, hypochondria, germaphobia, social anxiety, social isolation, on. need ready address current administration needs make top priority. fuck talking about? interact people. That’s ridiculous hyperbole. Wow, it'll blast! 100 million doses initial doses, production starts China. 

Yes, initial doses (of many millions come, **Initial supply delivered BioNTech’s production facilities Germany.** 

This still explicitly say 100 mil doses come Marburg. might **initial** 20 mil rest Fosun's facility China. cas onclusive press release implying. Marburg facility able produce Million doses Q2, EU gets 75 million doses, rest exported.  fact whole output (taxpayer funded) facility, going EU EU, able secure doses facility much quicker, pure insanity.

EU sign 300 mil contract get vaccines solely Marburg, it'd stupid so. signed BNT/ Pfizer, means EU gets Belgium Marburg. company sign contract/ promise based constructed facilities, surely made sure (I'm guessing) keep promises based existing facilities.

Yes, said supply 75 mil Q2 later contract estimate global production capabilities decisively (increased production Belgium Marburg), say 75 mil *explicitly* coming Marburg, Marburg Belgium. Maybe we'll get more, knows. BNT/Pfizer supposed produce 1 bil doses June far 836 + 100 (Fosun) mil doses definitive contracts worldwide according including EU's earlier contract. get 1/3 Marburg production nothing production facility outside EU, that's quite shitty deal ask (negotiated incompetent people) . 

Again, doubt EU's deal solely based Marburg. absolutely right EU's negotiations, EU's deal shitty made incompetent people. learned AZ deal, EU tends get vaccines EU around, there's that! Neither health workers want jobs want look kids home? isn’t health it’s productivity, kids school stops economy functioning. I've made lot sacrifices pandemic, refuse cancel National Almond Day party 30 closest friends eat big shared bowl almonds. hard data yet, couple papers came yesterday vaccination lower viral load: looked pretty promising me. much doubt it. Healthy early 30's checking in, wfh job. Lost massive amount weight 2 years pandemic. apparently stayed unhealthy? /s Deaths undercounted know. Excess deaths 100-200k higher. Thank 😂 didn’t even notice don’t celebrate Easter they? need begin loosening restrictions

Who ""we"" here? Seems like states currently process loosening restrictions. God &amp; faith (nunhood): 1 - Covid: Europe’s oldest person, Sister Andre, French nun, survived Covid-19 celebrate 117th birthday week, caregivers said. think normalization masking sick worried getting sick, normalization shaking hands sure things.

I think we'll see reduction business travel. Lots meetings done virtually.

I think society general diligent flu season. I'm sure replying then. op claiming AZ vaccine would make herd immunity impossible, pointed scenarios might happen. acknowledged point making original comment ""This true B.1.351 becomes dominant."" altering feline Coronavirus infect treat human cancer cells lab. look studies published online people worked there. Scientists kinds dangerous experiments coronavirus Wuhan. None surprising read lab. guess case maybe 3% caught immunity kicked in. [New York use Citi Field mass vaccination Unfortunately means there's good chance vaccines underperforming Yes, huge swathe population dragged back work, kicking screaming. they're scared, simply want work office again. understand feeling, feeling people pretend scared vulnerable avoid in-person office work. definitely true. We've never pandemic 24/7 news cycle before. you...this devastating everyone's mental health. incompetent organization trying placate CCP. knew investigation would either uncover nothing put China better light. don’t get ‘experts’ education can’t grasp basic investigation strategy; instead go ‘it came another place’. Yeah one buying crock shit. investigate happened doctors Wuhan blew whistle beginning silenced? None prevented children getting real education social development. Whether want true not, real world “how feels” immensely changed last year. don’t think people ought live fear, think you’re going see large, things listed going together different experiences going forward. 
You don’t get something like this, pretend like never happened. Can't wait see excuses Reddit keeping restrictions. thanks. vaccines widely available anyone wants them, I’m officially ignoring mask distancing guidelines there’s nothing anyone it. Yeah, surely take years repair much damage lives.  what? didnt even know results phase 3 trial was. important reasons it’s even considered approval agree Oxford trial look great, tiny trial results may may mean anything. Plus record 100% effective preventing hospitalizations still hold despite new variants. That's accurate. 6 people died trial, 2 vaccine. I'm sure though whether died covid natural death. need go back edit comments links trying prove right must stressed out.

This Lancet paper different VOC. vaccine effectiveness. title literally says understanding variants concern. 

&amp;#x200B;

STOP SPREADING MISINFORMATION. comments needed. stop. Yes biased unscientific title. ya scientist say impossible scientifically impossible 

so thing common peon consider impossible labelled something like Highly unlikely. 

like could struck meteor next 5 min highly unlikely. 

or could hit 45 times natural lightning strikes life highly unlikely

impossible kinda reserved things cant happen regardless chance / coincidences like claim fly thru air power mind, would labeled impossible. could agree more. think it’s good hypothesis would seriously skeptical even exposed. Seriously, bubble boy since day one live alone lol. ma' 'individual liberties', amiright? Canada's vaccination numbers way low make impact though.

This every country. Numbers dropped simply cause holidays matter vaccination rates are. travels January/February? They're super slow travel gathering months. shut ins screaming void really move needle. see concern reporting ""well numbers good, maybe there's still risk?"" nothing really happens everyone forgets stories. 3% people died vaccine still died? don’t understand they’re saying vaccinated people still spread like it’s fact.

They aren't. They're saying know. messaging changing evidence comes out. really make date April 2 care went dream vacation, took 6 months work. can't begrudge extra money. Outdoor protests bad masking distancing adhered too. 

The anti-lockdown protesters wear masks distance show care. currently using mRNA vaccines states AZ’s vaccine vector vaccine. preclinical data showing mRNA vaccines somewhat weaker antibody response SA variant need real clinical data know clinically relevant. Still dismissing variants hand wrong headed. problem. mRNA vaccines fixable problem. convince Neanderthals general public get vaccinated available. interview hilarious reporter basically calls saying providing evidence China tells you. insane. Guess many people Brazil get infection genetically tested..... many.

How many have? guessing here, too?

You said data supports point. asked it. present data. data. one example rare thing happening knew could already happen.

Maybe wider spread is. Maybe not. presenting fact (""Why? data says case. skepticism bearing upon reality."") misinformation, misleading, outright dangerous.

And wrong.

It would one thing express concern question whether variants running wild people recovered Covid. think us level concerned it. outright say pretend data flat wrong.

Your post reported misinformation. need update original post read Oxford then. Pfizer. leave wrong. feel like high school right would worst. wanted high school hang friends chase girls. stuck home family time would've torture. called - matter findings team investigation future turns another university research group, still cherry pick evidence support existing beliefs dismiss goes against. 

Just admit you’ve made mind already stop pretending evidence logic ever mattered you. Happy cake day, Sexy! wait... 3% vaccinated? thought 100% protection death.    
Also... it'd pretty neat Palestinians get vaccines Russia. Yeah odds getting false positive PCR test threshold 40 way higher odds getting reinfected. also possible escaped lab Wuhan. OK.

If thats case wanna WW1 gas masks back fashion public use....  Finally, international joke smokers category US - vaccinated phase 1 teachers Gone? No, see happening anytime soon. It'll probably kids get COVID vaccine. usually fine it, still spread others. mention there's probably going 30% people going get vaccinated without someone shooting dart gun. think we'll good shape easter, we're going low level spreading years probably, that's also assuming get crazy mutation beats vaccine. proven liar though? We're half million dead year, bad people trying say lot countries (mainly poorer ones) rely heavily vaccines like AZ short term availability issues vaccines. Also, SA variant prevalent one lot countries. doses available, throwing away based results small scale study rule effectiveness vaccines preventing death hospitalizations younger populations idiotic. could see argument vaccinating at-risk population vaccine, saying ""useless"" far truth. 65's teachers vaccinated, much less concern. death rate small, people still risk keep kids virtual school. Oh, please. even believe 3 4 people wearing masks now. Speaking myself, can't wait throw every single one masks fire. It’s b117 . SA Brazil variants ? would make effective vaccine ever reduces death 97%. Government websites 99k regulations (before pedantic asshole corrects me, yes I'm aware I'm exaggerating) usually designed multiple groups, implemented someone awful like Deloitte Accenture. 

&amp;#x200B;

So intersection miserable experience involved, changing (thankfully) slow going process. want schools reopen, Vaccinate Teachers. Instead expect governors fight teachers unions instead bothering get vaccines arms. school reopening delayed even more. Popular opinion shifted much. Six months ago sub super pro lockdown praising people said never leaving house ever again.

How turntables RemindME! 3 months Yes possible people shed dead virus fragments months recovered, shedding inconsistent, quite possible swab December pick material, whereas one yesterday did. probably likely scenario re-infection based describe. probably good idea go old-folks home start coughing everyone.

 good idea COVID, start now? things kill elderly besides COVID. normal thing epidemiologist would ask clarification assume second option.

It would like Trump tweeting want destroy Iran soldiers bunker took green light launch nukes. damnit bro think happening people exposed Covid enough actually infect you. need full infection develop immune response something.  Old data 1 23 samples UK variant. Trust me, can’t say haven’t tempted 😅  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

Or person us thinks idiots idiot reading them? Kids least 10x risk die influenza states refuse make vaccine mandatory. make flu vaccines mandatory, schools never safe disease. MISC cases hospitals right even Covid positive kids. Colds, flu, strep cause MISC, they're news drives ratings.

Once teachers vaccinated, kids able go back full time parents choose. it’s still that. deal covax donating country gets half doses purchase vulnerable countries get half. People mad expect Canada say “oh don’t need half take them”. problem Canada needs vaccines too, we’re far behind vaccinations That's evidence outdoor protests spread Covid unless BLM protest.

This facebook, Karen can't really compare two countries like that. instance, possible without vaccine, virus would spreading far faster Israel compared USA due number reasons (social norms, etc.). know without running experiment. don’t know you’re talking about, all. all, all. wait see, promise.  Uh that's kinda pathetic...perhaps older vet. nursing home. going learn lot effective vaccines shutting transmission watching Israel next couple months. I'm going make prediction right now.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Wow. states different criteria. I’m MS anyone 65+ 16-64 chronic health condition currently eligible. Nowhere say prefusion _stabilized_, key point. They're obviously going create prefusion spike, problem prefusion spike change postfusion spike stabilized. month ago it'd probably relevant one variants getting covid. Use fucking brain. Chances good mutated strain since recent. even Singapore? American who’s lived Singapore expat 8 years comment reads someone completely ignorant incapable looking beyond seeing merits systems outside ‘MURICAN FREEDOM. Also you’re plain wrong different ethnic groups interacting. Singapore one international country world. 4 national languages, national food literally amalgamation cuisines stemming multiple cultures, expats literally world. children attend international school, student population diverse mix many different nationalities. taught histories religions cultures order foster global mindset young age, building tolerance respect people backgrounds. 
 
Your assertion peace somehow forced outcome ludicrous. It’s peaceful Singapore literally efficient competitive economy world, well one second safest countries world. Life good people don’t really much complain about. 

Is Singapore authoritarian? Yes...but name. materially different freedoms offered America? No. enforce cleanliness? don’t allow graffiti? truly standard supposed measure windfalls freedom? Get night really weird dreams

Interesting! notably weird them? willing share, mean -- know pretty personal. may say number New Yorkers attending private gatherings vs going restaurants anything inherent risks indoor dining. Researchers show hotels gyms among source infections. 

from article:  JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Monday said found level in-person spending restaurants three weeks ago strongest predictor new cases would emerge. 

Nothing really changed make safer today. Community spread may lower, gathering people enclosed spaces without masks going cause number infected people increase they're forced go back even harsher restrictions get again. There's need endless cycle making progress letting cases rise again. vaccines work, matter weeks people access point indoor dining far less risky. Wtf, today first I’ve read restaurant workers eligible NY. check damn survey everyday NY.gov still doesn’t say anything restaurant workers. know it’s NYC? vaccine already wife doesn’t works restaurant. vaccine distribution NY annoying say least. Well, many European countries set exit lockdowns, starting opening schools. SA variant become dominant, albeit maybe relatively slowly. perfect immunity cuts transmission 90% 70% vaccination effectively 63% herd immunity. remaining 30% need get ""naturally vaccinated"" enough drive rate well 1.0 virus contained mutates enough achieve significant escape mutation. vaccineated July/August. 

There end sight. it’s possible reinfected Covid? there’s multiple strains it? stupid? It’s common sense, use fucking brain. Science would say don’t trust science unless proven multiple times peer reviewed times, trust science good since there's concern USA UK B.117 become Dominant strain COVID-19 US. sure Moderna tested vaccine B.117 UK Brazil South Africa mutations? terrified, bad flu anything, joint soreness, fatigue, maybe even lymph node swelling ... day, two max. ready take ibuprofen maybe even benedryll day take work sleep off. fine, well worth purely matter ""higher risk"" ""lower risk,"" would definitely guess airplane travel full plane low risk thing would imagine higher risk.

I imagine things calm down, official airline stance mask wearing recommended throughout duration flight need drink eat take mask reason, increasing exposure accept risk. risk taking mask coul exposing someone else even wearing mask, risk overall implicit decide travel public mass transportation. Oh really? moving lights everything! Wow. went way humorous response is, real information never rise top. really don’t care witty responses people looking information. realize makes sound miserable parties haha March-December home. I'm actually back campus even person classes. campus handling pandemic well announced today opening person classes new COVID cases campus low. campus also vaccination site near future going start giving students vaccine. Want ask Astrazeneca well. people know preferring take Pfizer reason. Thanks sharing  second one sucked bad day half, fine. 

10/10, would again. Asymptomatic infected mutually exclusive. example, HIV asymptomatic many years, infect people regardless.

Asymptomatic another word ""carrier"". havent dentist since last April, I'm normally quite thorough dental care. swear read 10 percent effective toward S.Africa variant. I’ll look come back attach. Pfizer I've yet see any. one ever complained existed able give single example one. Fair point Ohhhhhhhhhhh! see there! extremely dismissive ignorant comment make. seem consider restrictions upended livlihoods millions, threatening create lost generation students deprived adequate education plunging globe worst economic crisis since depression. lack empathy dissapointing people fed current Situation. fact economic mental fallout lockdowns going far outweight direct casualties pandemic. tough pill swallow truth. I'm left leaning come , conservative/libearl issue. Anyone common sense see impacts restrictions having. body suggesting get rid now, however going extremely difficult justify come late spring summer. want ""party "" go bar. People struggling make financial ends meet, kids loosing crucial points development grad students graduate job market ruins. please considerate jumping conclusions. good day stay safe. Aren’t blaming dems problems? vaccine works, safe, since sickness leads hifher immune response. variant able bypass vaccine, might also bypass immunity Please report comments post misinformation/break rules we'll remove/ban. Thanks! keep vaccinations coming Fever listed three times AZ (fever, determines whether important, mild, moderate fever, J&amp;J one fever criteria always lands least mild. 

I personally whether fever present, especially 37.8-38C range really boarderline normal. fever, fatigue, headache normal immune responses caused vaccine itself, think particularly big deal symptoms missed. 

I'm interested COVID exclusive symptoms like loss smell vomiting. argue AZ sensitive fever, I'll counter J&amp;J bigger list actual COVID symptoms (eye discharge, bluish lips, red toes). 

Either way, we'll likely never see actual data armchair analysis. None vaccines released data detailed. Best possibly hope FDA/EMA numbers normalized raw data calculation themselves. Arguing couple single digit % difference vaccines using public data that's 95% CI vaccine cheerleading cheerleading purposes. 

As far I'm concerned, mental buckets 70%+ (ends pandemic), 70-40% (good enough use meantime nothing better available), &lt;40% (start planning pivot different approach asap). Please report rule-breaking comments see! huge help. I'm pretty sure read somewhere airlines reported massive cash reserves able get liquidating long-term investments. used pay employees. bailout, would annoyed would go towards paying massive debt built last recession. hear/read this? pretty bad side effects 4 5 days first dose, I'm still waiting second.

I've also SUPER paranoid catching spreading COVID. live apt front doors leading enclosed halls instead open, check mail every months middle night avoid people, never leave unless absolutely to, thankfully times. also live texas covidiots everywhere. 

It would interesting caught it, asymptomatic. saying possible means, justification distancing masks. I've seen couple here, they're way prevelant Twitter larger subs (r/movies, r/politics, sub couple months ago etc.) No.

How would get ugly?

They homes bar, restaurant friends house.

Once media stops playing COVID news BREAKING NEWS, things normalize quickly. focused getting people sick *one specific cause*, often without regard secondary effects problems generated result. Mam, Wendy's. also helps many skiers snowboarders wore face coverings anyways pandemic. Even anti-maskers know saying natural place wear mask they've done years pre-pandemic well us actually jobs know? missed single day work since started. comment make 5 5 Umm wtf even talking about. #reported people lie say vaccinated order get social benefits. agreed. I'd love see consistent clear messaging countries? Australia NZ locking soon detect one case? Traitor redditors: ""We can't trust Chinese scientists say, need send people investigate lab leak""

WHO scientists investigate: ""very unlikely leaked lab""

redditors: ""I can't believe scientists white washing China"" making way many assumptions, even experts confidence expressing. using AZ vaccines, we're using multiple different vaccines. 

As today, vast majority spread caused unvaccinated people. circumstances know strain become dominant, possible SA variant remain less prevalent making AZ vaccine still worthwhile.  trust China means nothing me. likely true lost credibility. probably fine go TBH. outdoor activity realistically, skiing one place pandemic basically wearing mask anyways cover mouth. 

None ski places I've seen issues. post instead original source? mean literally everything wrong start pandemic. realizing telling people immune still scared stupid. Sorry. I’m different opinion. choose mild “needless” death isolating children plexiglass cubes school ... especially death coming people end lifespans anyways. 

You’ll fight desired world. I’ll fight mine. Good luck. Like completely understand overly optimistic but, come on, there’s much good news many good things coming right there’s little reason believe isn’t going getting better mental health pandemic going devastating government need throw immense resources it. Step one making coverage mental health therapy mandatory. going dealing mental fallout least decade. Yeah “wearing masks” “ordering takeout” there’s it. small minded sheltered you’re either 12 years old serious Hope strategy, though... really believe several predominant strains COVID, we'll need vaccines them. Uh, millions people argue that, actions words. 

I’m talking people wanting stay home recluse. I’m talking way society social gatherings operates. shaped outgoing influential people. like puts others huge disadvantage many ways. It’s another type minority. 

Most people don’t like go out, aren’t sake going out. It’s going like. norm bar party number social events could look quite different appeal different people, like would miserable going out. 

Obviously find niche group friends enjoy things way options cater nearly everyone. it’s norm, expected participate norm order advance careers make connections. It’s big disadvantage. 

All I’m asking put people’s shoes consider things instead writing people aren’t outgoing. even talking about? Nothing sais anything said.

Read said.

1. sample size low statistical significance predictive power

2. previous sperm quality individuals unknown. say healthy sperm got COVID unhealthy sperm. says extremely small sample, unhealthy sperm general population. 4 comments article. 4 idiots. Batting 1.000 Yes, husband got sulfa antibiotic Bactrim. ICU 4 days. we’re talking 2 surgical cloth masks, yeah, well-fitted N95 likely better personal protection. N95 vent, may need cover surgical mask. It’s weird too. Beshear pushed teachers vaccinated KY parents would stop complaining kids going school. teachers vaccinated Friday they’ve plan implement it. great see, reservations look like 2-3weeks Super Bowl parties. measures voluntary I'd agree.

But neuroses others imposed entire population. I'm predicting major fights big companies start bringing people back office would like WFT indefinitely, also fights ways. lot people would kill office again.

TBH whether job require office something taking account post-law school. despise WFH useful pinch (I think WFH option legal profession forever necessary), need office time best severe reaction severe reaction general? decently severe reaction Moderna shot 1 (searing headache, full body soreness, fatigue, bad arm pain, slight nausea dizziness) definitely COVID (I’ve practical shutin since COVID reported US, work home, everything gets delivered, never whiff symptoms). you’re telling going worse I’m going happy haha I'm fucking pissed happening way. one taking seriously 'lol vaccine'. gone months ago. surprising all, since always projected would peak typical cold flu season obvious reasons. imagine majority Americans point last year point too. Well, we’ll see. Nearly 80,000 Americans age 65 died COVID-19 far (~30,000 age 55). may still risk depending roll-out goes, definitely huge improvement. Sounds like someone life wants everyone else continue shut like is. understand people's obsession almost cheering virus reach hire rates vaccination, feel like states mask mandates going keeping place. Otherwise, antimasker going claim vaccinated even they're middle coughing lung symptomatic case.

But I'm hoping see something official assume safety vaccinated people traveling private settings unmasked unvaccinated people.

Not anyone even enforces quarantine rules, little ridiculous I, vaccinated person, would quarantine went vacation state came back. valid lost generation claims?  Fortunately, Fauci CDC disagree. increasing evidence vaccination reduces spread.  They're 66% population vaxxed. Going hard country go far beyond that. others get COVID (or already gotten it) herd immunity soon enough. Yep, exactly. base level though, realized made outdoor dining better absolutely ventilation airflow. Feel bad ones sunk money build things.  don’t fucking get it. many accounts rooting world fucking end... many gloom doom posts, positive posts comments getting downvoted. Granted I’ve sub 1 month, way? 

Are bots?! nice leaders lead example. Wait see non lethal damage US population, for-profit healthcare system.

Without structural changes see absolute rise disorder crime due increased poverty.

Medical bankruptcy number 1 cause bankruptcy US.

Crime already rising city centres homelessness, expect rise long term health effects realised also. We're currently quite strict lockdown, why. less restrictions cases grown like crazy, hitting 60-70k cases day easily. Nobody letting hook. they're ones saying everyone stay home forever go broke. using cases argument? hospitalizations follow double peak?

Because numerous states give metric new hospitalizations, current hospitalizations cumulative total reflect day day fluctuations making impossible get overall picture US. get one big peak people leave hospital enter hospital. states report daily new hospitalizations, see double peak number new hospitalizations corresponding holidays. never known single person diseases got vaccinated kids

Bullshit. refuse believe youve never known kid chicken pox. think they're trying prevent situation people vaccinated running around without taking precautions people vaccinated claim also running around taking precautions. That's true. mainstream narrative certainly though. Yeah, go Southwest disappointed stopped keeping middle seats empty Dec 1. Much inclined fly Delta going forward pandemic ends guess rules really came bite ass. hair dye? makeup? thing. let people want nice website people shot. Palestinian Authority taking Israel's vaccine. may started recently take table, intentionally deprived people order seem ""in charge."" Lol, I'm gay - big deal. orgies count. I'm married. Husband shy post corona he'll make peace it. Bunch public health cranks pushing #GoForZero hashtags now. Option 2.

Americans social distancing more.

Herd immunity cause obvious spike. much slow kick in. go huge growth huge declines basically overnight like cases US every day get immunity. would much slower. Yeah, think that's singular heartache chronic health conditions--even effects visible, seem register. think matter lack love kids bad love much instead, feel themselves, simply lack adaptations ourselves. always know gives us trouble repeated attempts we've learned experience. can't learn way. Still maddening.  


I'm glad dad able spot it. kids quick spot even slight limping I'm really done (it gets super obvious) know ni ni time me. Grateful that. Hang there. Yup point y’all nasty believe bit worst. grew next Texas (and visited last Feb thanks season passes working everywhere) others.

Gotham/DC area great neat rides, rest park feels neglected.

King's Dominion Busch Gardens look nice want go isnt like casual/spontaneous day like SF. Especially later. friends way though Newport News gonna go 2020 know happened there.  vaccine envy go roof :/ Nobody's life negatively affected. need fo vaccinate world localized lockdowns new vaccine resistant strain breaks out. fight even US, 3rd world. literally requires nothing aside wearing mask months getting vaccinated. Plus maybe dollars taxes fund 3rd world vaccinations surveillance. Ok, clear, agree West Coast variant likely infectious given fact outcompeting older strains? sure sounds like good news anecdotal.

i missing info whether testing amounts analysis changed well Thank Joe Biden always someone else, me. Same, doctor checked waiting period times recommended Tylenol. article clearly states many many times know certain, disagree (nor could since article written months ago news recent). states simply many believe possible, course makes sense. scientist would disagree that, scientists make absolute statements without evidence. read statement WHO, clearly says ""extremely unlikely"" completely impossible. one quoted article shared states disagree probably zoonotic, possible virus leak lab experiments.  sides agree, pressed, lab origin can’t conclusively ruled natural origin can’t ruled either 

Even Baric believes source likely bats. 

The thing stand people claim lab based, fact they've never stated hypotheses think got humans. think janitor accidentally threw petri dishes? employee somehow breathed survived spread somehow affected themselves? argument virology lab suspiciously close wet market. really lab escape, think China would stupid enough tell world virus originated place street lab? Hell no. would claimed started literally anywhere else. Nah, go back soon hospitalizations deaths reasonable. There’s nothing magical 70%. imagine basically, everything U.S. largely normal then.

If choose stay home ignore vaccination, power you, rest country move fine. Hell maybe even international travel select countries back table summer proof vaccination. I’m waiting Ides March spike I've 2 friends die suddenly one teens 20s, unknown heart conditions, them. sad happens 
. think afraid crying wolf h1n1 turned dud warning bells rang. It’s definitely good trend. Hopefully 7 day avg get 100k soon. mean get plane drive long distances visit extended families Valentine's Day? 

Valentine's Day spike gonna thing. people going go Valentine's Day people already going bars restaurants. We’re never gonna truly know actual origin that’s fucking sad also believe headline counts individuals got one dose vaccine ""vaccinated,"" totally true even they're better someone vaccinated all. Look, I’m trying downplay happened currently going on. It’s tragic heartbreaking. said, I’m leaning agree this. Even micro level, something simple someone cold 2 years old, workplace, might freak someone out. anything virus related definitely going blown proportion. 

Until current precautions I’m taking longer work, I’m going stress worry anymore last year. US least, taboo change mind hold two differing opinions true way. 

No, first opinion led carnage misery, get pass changed mind. ...and yet look southern California Florida data find minimal difference point. year restrictions, effectiveness lockdowns plunges due blatant noncompliance large segment population dimply difficulty controlling respiratory disease general. isnt people lazy. pandemic literature prior 2020 actually doscouraged lockdowns lasting longer months reason, school closures longer 6 weeks. ""closing borders"" per CDC deemed largely useless. admit seems work island nations others fairly useless.

We need vaccinate elderly opening summer (when cases lowest anyway) make sure vaccinate everyone fall prevent winter surges. point deal minor outbreaks add yearly boosters corona shots. Absolutely, almost forgot. recall looking early finding tons researchers warning aerosols, statement posted likely airborne.  keep fighting it. get 75-80% vaccinated hospitals packed. Get way. government websites always piece shit? School websites too. You’re something important 2006 html website can’t scroll properly. Yes, that's nice have. explain massive drop numbers quickly, especially drop began took office. big chunk population vaccinated herd immunity. 2 might safe general rules going still place overall cases die 1- can't trust people truthful 2- know vaccinated people could still spread it. 

Even though individually vaccinated, can't go back normal society everyone (or ~70% herd immunity) also vaccinated. They're lucky get early still ongoing people. Viral vector vaccines designed modified. administered, less effective body develops immunity first two months mostly. Nerds follow rules anyone, rules hard also want happy. Also many people caring whatever want sad Reminds time commented thread restaurants sub restaurant twice since March point, sat table even close customers, used hand sanitizer, servers wore masks, got downvoted hell. Followed every damn safety protocol province still satisfied decided spend night room. You’re messing around Good! live Germany. Honestly tired oddly optimistic people sub seem predicting ""2 mil vaccines day average"" ""right around corner"" US. allocations states barely inching upwards. Last week 5.1 mil first doses allocated states/territories combined. 2-3 weeks MIGHT hit 1.5 mil/day weekly avg (assuming moderate climb 1st doses).

I'm saying distribution concern, would need ""national guard deployment"" ""NFL mega sites"" ""Dentists giving vaccines"" states getting enough doses warrant needing kind extreme measure? states opened eligibility point can't fulfill demand due lack doses, lack nurses give shot. Scheduling real nightmare, clinics even know much getting/can book.

I know POs say fill, see pfizer moderna go delivering 5 mil week February finishing 200 mil may/june. Yes J&amp;J one shot, approved, I've heard manufacturing ""still coming up"" whatever means.

I'm worried people saying ""I give masks elderly high risk vaccinated, anyone get it."" realize still shortages months ""anyone"" could theoretically get public refresh like they're trying buy ps5 Christmas willing drive Kalamazoo get it. Time, money, privilege weigh heavily gets when.

I'm tired want over, ""things looking up"" sounds hollow data we've getting shows painfully slow trickle doses actually coming states. CDC allocations reluctant get hopes people saying November ""vaccines March"" ""June"" April say ""August"" reality us waiting til January.... 2022.

Thanks reading rant. I'm tired I'm giving up. lucky enough vaccinated, please still wear mask public. can't see vaccination status shows respect rest us. That's seems like. Wish could pumping vaccines several months back. Thought would big initiative OWS... **Feb. 9, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

You also read terminology - virus alive cells, particles. gosh they'll recommend international travel affected areas soon rate. Wait what?! Please tell real. There's reason pandemic diseases practically always zoonotic. Antigenic drift takes several iterations completely escape immune response raised previous infection/vaccination. endemic people's immune responses continuously evolving new infections vaccination. 

Flu viruses known humans constantly mutating escape immunity. Sometimes results particularly bad flu season, still something people pay much attention to. end? implement mind-control matrix computer? behind big conspiracy? Lysol? Clorox? rest economy suffering. got scientists agree big **world-wide** con? ask questions giving conspiracy nonsense? Cover-up confirmed. says EUA.

And people replace anyways.

The bird flu BIG ONE, too.

With said, we're trailing viral mutations, fully understand mutations. know significant ways understand.

Ill take covid day im feeling moment. virus infected replicating. anyone wants take deep dive pros/cons lab leak hypothesis article great:

[The Lab-Leak Hypothesis decades, scientists hot-wiring viruses hopes preventing pandemic, causing one. long read, best researched review evidence I've seen far. see presence Peter Daszak team new light.

Also want hear CCP propaganda action snippet today's [China/WHO press amazing. see... isn’t something “media running with”, isn’t touting fake cure *cough* hydroxychloroquine *cough* give anyone false sense security. need realize difference spreading false information hurt people, make think there’s cure there’s not, difference sharing information comes available potency vaccines (that already studied, peer review,) studying new variants current vaccines. Diseases mutate live, do, get stronger, one is. malice releasing information study head caution, it’s looking like S.African variant pretty nasty! It’s ~50% transmissible, looking deadly, learning evade current vaccines, take CAUTION. Don’t false sense security vaccines work new mutants, keep mask on, keep distance difference is. “now, now, now, guardian skews left, better keep keepin were, don’t KNOW vaccine won’t work!” another media source, excellent vetting information, well non biased, “ThE MeDIa” reports something, always consider source! source Oxford, they’ve forthcoming isn’t peer reviewed, again, aren’t touting cure give false hope media done! Here’s another Reuters, excellent, non biased, highly factual “media” read from. NPR, AP! Fox News/Breitbart, much... find Bulgaria's data? frightening see social media groups impacted data vaccinations. actually said that? believe bill gates microchips china new order bullshit, summed exactly issue people consider.

I young covid never big risk begin with. European countries offering vaccines oldest oldest oldest moment. time possibility get vaccine crisis largely over, combination risk groups vaccinated, weather, natural burnout.

From health perspective absolutely point. main reason want get vaccinated giving one less reason idiotic politicians power trip continue lockdowns. Unless, course, said something agreed with... case solidly praise world wide health authority are. Reinfection vaccines working thing though. people still catch COVID-19 vaccinated, especially depending vaccine. never even mentioned China, answering people say lost credibility. Thanks changin topic contributing anything conversation Bots can't take joke. disagree. can't even understand point. can't disagree something even know disagreeing with. you’re trying say ‘viruses conscious’ - nobody ever said.

The post responded said: ""but fact virus evolve evade vaccine - need prepared"" simply false. cannot say virus definitely mutate avoid vaccine. scientist would assume would know that. reason bought idea consciences sounded like insinuating virus cell would purposefully look way avoid destroyed asked creationism don’t seem grasp evolutionary pressure forms populations. think understand I’m saying pretty well - I’m scientist. seem done basic background reading see expert. pull ‘viruses sex’ from? different paths genomic variance.......

I using outlandish example ""viruses sex"" used humans example purposeful selection plays role evolution (which one disputing, course occurs procreating organisms). Even someone virologist smart enough understand natural selection always purposeful choice, instead result environment around organism. viral cell **purposefully** choose certain replication mutation survive host, mutation occurs via copying error new viral cell left continue replicate bodies immune response targeting cell particular mutation, thus creating ""evolution"" virus continue spread. viral cells (however many millions) continue replicate mutate none mutations able evade vaccine induced immunity eventually disappear. insinuate virus versus may one day evade immunity stretch best downright lie worst. true vaccines would essentially useless every virus would evading immunity every host. Hmmm sea lions. used poster loved phrase. Yorkers tech skills appalled tried make vaccine appointments older relatives. knew better way. see. Thanks clearing up! one thinks medical professional refusing vaccine lose job? profession help people, save people, they're actively choosing thing would exactly that. There's evidence may around before. three strains amongst early cases A,B C, oldest main Wuhan strain B may around bit probably somewhere nearby. long term yes, protection all, ignore big vaccine companies confident take short time tweak vaccine. Short term however, stopping variants mean way less infections overall, also less deaths. course, say either. undiagnosed covid still kill you. I'm saying count confirmed deaths cases certainly underestimating real death rate. 

This something statisticians picking probably half decade. Even excess mortality tell whole story - people staying home means fewer car accidents, causes death might up, preventable deaths health care preoccupied covid, etc. big tangled mess unpack there's certainly easy way it. another good argument veganism. animal farming industry negative environmental impact, wastes land water resources, drives antibiotic resistance, causes fucking global pandemics. angry anti-vaxxers/anti-maskers still eat meat ordeal hypocrite. lesser percentages, however. Underestimates USA/West European countries tend 10 % 30 %, poorer countries often well 100 %. Please use correct term Experimental Vaccine Thank you!! totally agree, give temporary vaccine side effects, don’t give Covid. I’m high risk either, 23, I’m medical student I’ll seeing covid positive patients. 

Hopefully Johnson &amp; Johnson coming soon, you’ll able get vaccinated summer semi-normal summer! Happy birthday way!!  Thr South african variant isnt dominant one Europe North America transmissible advantage hopefully takes become dominant we'll booster shots. far AZ one longer effective South african variant. J&amp;J Novavax still effective albeit greatly reduced efficiency. I'd expect something similar Moderna/pfizer probably anywhere close 95% hopefully still prevent hospitlisations etc. Tylenol NSAID, safer. Ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen (aleve), etc. NSAIDs. Classical physics works fine long dealing large small. Occam's Razor works fine well determining verisimilitude competing theories; outdated theological. vaccine South Africa stopped distributing due working? 'The'?

Anyway, maybe continent incredibly low testing levels Zambia example. countries studies made data excess deaths available (South Africa, Sudan, Nigeria) point vast underestimates. cannot date though. Noone really knows pandemic ends. 

That's exactly point. date useless, thus distraction, red saying ""We review restriction latest date"". Yes, mean lift restriction date, better saying ""Here's restriction tell time analyse situation again.""

I agree better. think better government honest direct constituents. April 15th date based *nothing*. civil. investigated found nothing wrong. Tylenol / Advil lower fever, fever part body's activation immune response, trying stimulate. reason think taking lessen effectiveness vaccination. trust anything said? lied us entire pandemic multitude things places. Unsurprisingly. diagnose lecture people? Maybe look yourself. still net good news.

There evidence suggest people covid tend carriers after. means concerns transmission vaccine may bad fact vaccine stop transmission. doesn’t even make sense. People speaking multiple languages doesn’t prevent speaking common language?? Dude want talk distorted history you’re still citing citing American history relevant white immigrants. push ever integrate Chinese speaking minorities? Vietnamese? Hindu? communities less insular, less accepted. 

It’s race baiting make claim races better integrated US. true, claim would “glossing” current reality country. 

When forced speak one primary language belittled speaking another, you’re forming singular culture, erasing part people’s identities. kind backwards international education US teaches. Erasure. saying merry Christmas, happy holidays. Don’t acknowledge take part cultures it’s appropriation. kind /insular/ mindset unique US. may taught cultures, approach wrong. isn’t “separate equal” it’s “different equal”. multiculturalism works. 

Instead America, ‘MURICA first types like like espouse virtues immigrant America without ever dealt associating hardships stigma. Anyone who’s educated outside US probably attest abysmal embarrassing system passes education country (primarily k-12)—it jumped chance send children school abroad. 

Honestly whole mentality doesn’t even offend much makes sad. sit there, making assertions strong arming opinions country, system, culture you’ve never even compare America so...American. 

I’m clearly going change mind, I’m going stop there’s talking rocks—but highly advise get out. Go travel. Leave country. guarantee you’ll change mind see firsthand. Yes, extent cases are. Similar previous surge cases simply due increased testing.  Makes wonder often happens. Horrifying indeed! makes sense aware possibility. isn’t like it’s far fetched. pick pace vaccinating people, help immensely. Right small number people country fully vaccinated (2wks post 2nd dose.) us still aren’t even eligible 1st dose full vaccination 6 wks initial shot. 

So reasonable say may see another surge work towards vaccination. However, won’t necessarily SA variant- could UK one rando shows scene. important thing remain aware situation unfolds remember moving right direction. China enough time destroy, rebuild, destroy rebuild lab might initially. civil. Probably job like healthcare worker etc, elderly risk Reinfections rare talkinh meaningful impact numbers gas lighting clickbait. Well, yes. concur. Wow several days? stinks! next day extremely fatigued, couldn’t focus anything, take nap. It’s wild much symptoms vary people anyone doesn’t believe hyping ‘new variants’ extension strategy justify restrictions remaining indefinitely?

They treat every positive test case test unreliable illness case hospitalised, asymptomatic positive tests it’s hardly surprise they’re one calling it. people used part whitewashing exercise. They’re finally let year later shown evidence Chinese want see. Letting used claim brought packaging means Chinese exactly outcome wanted. 

His second mostly likely theory jump non-intermediary animal - bat - human evidence support this. second likely theory actually encompasses lab release theory. without Chinese providing evidence happened, support it. course conclusion based evidence given. 

The lab release theory extremely unlikely. release past sars China. There’s accidental lab releases kinds pathogens worldwide. Chinese researchers, included suspected early patient, disappeared. Chinese claim young researcher alive well never offered proof life - would wanted go away could provide it.

Eventually actual truth happened come people may may looked back poorly. know they’re used, though. BioNTech deserves lot credit, leave name out. Governments open definite loosening restrictions, agree that. Things like cases x, bars open. hospitalizations, deaths, vaccinations. cannot date though. Noone really knows pandemic ends. 

What saying ""We review restriction latest date"". Yes, mean lift restriction date, better saying ""Here's restriction tell time analyse situation again."" I've heard alot second shot worse first. you? vaccine yet expect terms first/second shot sure Ontario Toronto doctor literally talked new pandemic variants briefing yesterday.

But digress, virus variant spreads one evades antibodies (either vaccination natural immunity) thus destroyed inside host. natural process occurs (obviously like said) ""fittest"" viruses able survive replicate. saying viral cell ACTIVELY seek mutations evade immunity, instead occur due replication errors mutation successfully evades immunity left replicate (as natural process cell) unabated body recognizes begins kill it. meantime particular mutation spreading hosts mutations occur possible evade immunity **even more** mutations.

3 weddings

2 Cleveland Beer festivals (it much fun January 2020)

An entire seasons worth Indians games, including opening day

My grandmothers 90th birthday party

Both Christmas thanksgiving parties sides family

Easter.

I haven’t seen aunt uncle year now, grandmother I’ve seen 3 times total Hong Kong government released stop uprising. proof this, proof pangolin like lied first time, proof fish market, proof minx, proof bats either lab wild. 

They know. Anyone (including WHO) says know speculating guessing., purposefully part covert cover propaganda campaign (usually supplied info exonerates CCP). Shhhhh, wrong sub. chance dying dice-roll. lab, natural.....so ask happen naturally 2, 5, 10, 25 yrs ago?? Ha, no. I'm actually big fan etymologies such. found unnecessary especially given we're Reddit talking simplicity.

Seems like ""I use big word win argument"" kind situations. Okay, required participate workplace practices bad habits. horrible relationship advice. start, get lawsuit dismissed saying [news actually really entertainment nobody take get call ""news."" think idea people activities *safely* local case numbers would stay low enough keep activities open. exposed whole virus, body attempt make antibodies every part virus. Whichever ends sticking first antibody gets ramped production. Eventually virus gets handled immune system. 

If spot targeted isn’t particularly conserved variants still susceptible variant swapped single amino acid part protein antibodies target. 


The vaccine forces body produce large quantities single highly conserved protein allows virus infiltrate host cells. B-cells build antibodies target conserved region. makes hard virus infiltrate host cells blocking rapid propagation also means successful variants able circumvent antibody damn near unfeasible. It’s impossible sure keeps chances low. 4 days ago 5000 deaths 3600 day always slump Sat-Mon goes 2000. bit disingenuous call drop deaths really seems still plateau reached early January. 

I'm certain deaths drop match decline new cases possibly first inkling drop starting, drop occurred yet. mean, 1300 Jan-3 1400 Jan-18 (a Sunday Monday respectively), followed 4000 Jan-8 Jan-20. numbers look actually indicate drop deaths Tuesday Friday. wedding. supposed get married November 2020, postponed November 2021. ended courthouse elopement still got married big party year, it’s hard plan don’t know restrictions I’m struggling getting back wedding planning mode. I’m 32 bridal showers, bachelorette parties weddings multiple family members friends years excited finally turn. least buy wedding dress shortly pandemic, glad normal moment world changed.

We lucky realize that. still jobs, haven’t lost loved ones COVID, able reschedule wedding vs say, senior prom graduation can’t reschedule next year. still want moment everyone else. February prime flu season. Maybe month two weather helping us, right still working us. first point completely context. He's said numerous times we'll get back normal viewed ""post-covid"" normal. He's already said hopes attending summer Twin's game grandkids. 

Your second example ""misinformation"" absurd. Plenty people warning B117 cause major surges US (like UK, Ireland, Portugal, etc. Even Denmark, lockdown since mid-December, [seeing B117 cases two days ago authored country's leading experts genomic surveillance said following: 

""Unless decisive immediate public health action taken, increased transmission rate lineages resultant higher effective reproduction number SARSCoV-2 likely devastating consequences COVID-19 mortality morbidity U.S. months, decisive action immediately taken.""

He said wearing 2 masks COULD dangerous wearing 1 emphasized importance fit filtration. 

He's never said skip second doses. He's said [consider delaying Nevermind fact he's saying [backed Dr. Stanley whose book *Vaccine* go-to reference vaccines. Neal Halsey Johns Hopkins. Marc Lipsitch Harvard. 

Obviously mind made guy he's steps ahead many others. said would pandemic late January, month half declared it. White House Fauci saying could kill 200,000 people, said 480,000. CDC saying spread droplets surfaces, saying aerosols. yeah, sounds like dangerous misinformation, I'll disregard says. Trump job public pay lol Maybe investigate Elsa source Covid. I'll take next trans atlantic train. Happy weezes* I'd say judgment call. level risk she, parents, doctor, etc. willing take level risk willing put her? research, assess risks/rewards, make decision. Yes - people listened advice, pandemic would turned differently said name politicians, shortened it. message applies. Asking investigate like asking fox count chicken. assumes virus mutate escape immunity (whether vaacine infection induced), and/or mutations cause severe disease. mutations escape, cause severe disease, pandemic starts again.

Immune/vaccine escaped mutations *already* found - endemic SA Brazil, detected elsewhere. ZeroCOVIDers honestly infuriating dangerous COVIDiots point. wake fuck up. Same, 19 1 month away 20 started I'm staring 21st birthday wondering 1/4 golden youth years went cares? I'm sick blame game. People tangibly getting money, are. rich. takes forever deliberate amounts gets what, go without pay people get something. keep getting deleted? want point AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine totally different Pfizer Moderna vaccine.

This dispute anything said, want put people start jumping conclusions. Bad bot. good point. point, paired ""so healthy despite 300 lbs weight, could died"" stories drives people mad constantly worry person? Odds wont, 9 year olds dropping dead everyday Covid story would longer news worthy, exceedingly rare/a freak coincidence thus news worthy. sad thing everyday possible wont wake million different reasons. proactive protecting let stories like consume life never able rest easy. Completely wrong. way coronaviruses circulate exactly response increasing selective pressure host immunity. closer get herd immunity greater pressure select immune evading mutations.
Mutation random, selection - seen independent emergence identical mutations unrelated clades virus. Trudat. long legs middle seat mighty uncomfortable. consider cold chain supply worth investigating? Lol. expecting investigation joke stupid. tendies mommy's basement? say doesnt work inaccurate.

It *possibly* ineffective preventing mild-to-moderate COVID younger people.

But trial small draw conclusion.

But abundance caution, SA suspended distribution AZ going later analysis mainly based infections new variant, 22% lower risk developing mild-to-moderate Covid-19 versus given placebo. Although researchers said figure **not statistically significant**, due trial design, well benchmark least 50% regulators set vaccines considered effective study **did account whether vaccine helped prevent severe Covid-19** involved mostly relatively young adults considered high risk serious Bahhhhhh hahaha hahaha......

Ahhhhhhh hahaha hahaha......

Hilarious, still believes WHO? can't open discussion topic? one side (pro vaccine) constantly pushed sub anyone questioning vaccine gets silenced get called ""bad guy""?.... misinformation? 2 people died soon taking vaccines... that's literally happened. study showing 66% efficacy? Chinese vaccines... different efficacy numbers result different demographics trials conducted differently? Could anyone break me? Someone tell Cuomo pls really think skiing snowboarding high risk provided behave sensibly it. Eat outside lodge bring food, limit contact others hotel, wear mask required, get snowboard within 6 feet anybody (which, fair, much prevent collisions covid). places allowing 1 traveling party per chair lift chair. Unless work still-unvaccinated nursing home something similarly sensitive, seems like reasonable way get physical exercise time outdoors. side effects result immune system reacting. already antibodies present previous infection, body immediately says ""Hey, jerk again, kill him!"" jumps action (causing fever, chills, whatever). infection before, shot teach immune system attack neutralize threat. cases, second shot likely result side effects, immune system primed ready jump action attack threat. aware median age. means trial poorly designed. mum already Covid thinks invincible beaten developed anti bodies. keeps trying get brother go her, shopping, eating. mad caution told brother leash. (We live together respects husband enough risk health please mother.)  
But yeah would totally back theory. getting close herd immunity, plus variants bad media hyping be. Yes sequence it. said 90% cases trial SA variant.  Correct, H1N1 influenza virus. know fun book global pandemic John Barry's ""The Great Influenza"" awesome read Spanish Flu era general, 'modern medicine' really started become thing centered around Johns Hopkins U. Rockefeller University. Well main floors trauma ICUs typically see exact situation...they get brought something else, typically crash fall, found covid. entire units pts need hospitalized covid I've seen ALOT asymptomatic patients. 

Yeah that's trippy thing. I'm 99% sure summer coworker tested positive started showing symptoms. test negative tests accurate symptoms specific enough covid seems likely. (no respiratory issues, intense fatigue body aches... like flu without typical symptoms lol) 

But since recovered I've directly exposed covid times count. I've literally lost track. yet I've never gotten sick either definitely antibodies I've gotten since completely asymptomatic. There's telling know words. basically Vaccines beast. 

The fact adapt yet great. effective every viable strain currently circulation, means months get things control variant could potentially spread worldwide. 

Since COVID cases much lower then, easy spot said strain blast gets going, probably slow anyways likely vax still effect. fact can’t find solution holding person classes group largely unaffected covid fucking bonkers. feel like job asks come solutions difficult problems weekly basis. I’m sure you’ll start feel better day goes on. Stay hydrated hang there, friend! dont understand people would downvote you. Im starting think anyone would downvote comment like severely mentally ill person. comment almost cry help. hope well man/woman/person Again, trust scientists predict random people forum like shitting certain people (not necessarily you) think. wasn't. Many countries still taken necessary action. true 76% AZ single dose l keep sharing. confidence interval extremely wide. Depends insurance. high-deductible plan, covid test cost $100. urgent med center, public testing site. Reopening schools offices ugly, matter data tells us. Way much fear hysteria there. expect lots “You don’t care society” vs. “You don’t care lives” arguments managers, executives, employees; students, parents teachers July August. Won’t fun all.

Lots firings resignations horizon IMO. things approve locale, hopefully soon. agree probably explained fully natural immunity.  
Other possible explanations: 
\- local COVID variants (I think UAE Israeli cases right British mutation)  
\- compliance. articles certain groups within Israel non-compliant, sure UAE. Osterholm also said we'd need half billion vaccines Ebola. Sorry, allow comments solicit donations requests money. Thank understanding!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   Read [this good explanation shouldn’t trust word Fauci says. tl;dr man openly admitted numerous occasions telling “noble lies” public major part communications strategy somehow heavily restricting lives entire population year+ realistic? didn’t even try come plan acknowledge significant differences covid dangerousness young old people. forget country we're talking about? 

There tens millions people United States health insurance, many whom: 

A) high risk contracting severe symptoms 

B) compelling reasons fly domestically 

Furthermore: 
1. insurance providers obliged cover rapid COVID-19 tests
2. many insurance providers cover COVID-19 tests deemed medically necessary 

An uninsured person could, conceivably, get non-rapid COVID test, cost may covered federal government. However, clinics actually guarantee non-rapid tests adequate turn-around times. I'm sure sort limitation Biden administration would implement, many foreign countries require travelers submit COVID-19 tests older 72-96 hours. mention nothing demography people trial)

The median age 31 years old. part none even placebo group ended study, produced researchers universities Witwatersrand Oxford, involved 2,000 participants, half got vaccine half got placebo, median age 31, meaning little could gleaned vaccine’s efficacy severe cases new variant well protects elderly, likely hospitalized die. think majority people going quietly stop isolating vaccinated. always people claiming things aren’t safe, they’ll never anything vocal minority that. still selfish take simple measures enjoy lives again. means plexiglass surrounded desks vs people needlessly dying...I’ll take plexiglass desks.  LOL got banned covidvaccinated repeating Cdc says moderna vaccine taken 6 weeks doses Europe say twelve Let them. think comparing deaths across countries reliable?

Because even comparing across states suspect. /s? already known reported time Italy begin showing signs country began hit hard? remember watching bad getting hit US started reporting cases, timeline got fuzzy US got hit misinformation begin flowing rampant can't shit US?


Oh right... ""muh rights, freedom tracked major corporations"" blah blah blah, 

while every idiot records lives social media, shares locations , use every trackable softwares phones made corporations hate. right, look like seven day average crossed 5% line wave, whereas finally dropping point wave. can't argue point cumulative positivity rate nearly order magnitude better ours, please keep snark. think we’ll get late spring / early summer least state. 

Good news either way numbers plummeting even can’t get vaccine way lower chances catching it. I’ll feel better lowering guard little summer. Lol! guess surprised! still think hospitalisations deaths prevented 

They absolutely data showing that. None. study, none PLACEBO group ended hospital dead. Ah, can't even imagine tough kids. Glad things getting better. ordeal is. time changed messaging late. fucked up. rooting happen? would say that? Remindme! 1 month would even need vaccinated to
go snowboarding? could go tomorrow wanted feel protests/riots summer? vote mayor places, reevaluation meant something like “we’ll 25% indoor dining instead 50% indoor dining”. States constantly tweaking restriction parameters doesn’t seem like many evaluating parameters themselves. Anyone else think going get ugly fall people vaccinated, still people staying homes complaining. Yeah hate say it, say true. republican argument last year true, overstated. proper 4 6 week lockdown spring 2020 would barely none negative consequences lockdown pros. Whenever heard DeSantis Cruz talk economy mental health thought: ""You arent wrong, misguided"" getting point talking points misguided, assholery. self fullfilling prophecy ever saw one. Ok wash hands. worried wash hands. saying people got died way fact bit much need post sources.

Of course sources stuff extremely rare. could go outside get hit lightning extremely rare, much base life it. raining storming I'll still go inside decent amount unaccounted deaths beginning pandemic. I'd say .5% average would good estimate. also think we've gotten better treating it, probably higher beginning pandemic one variant evades vaccine others don't, variant soon become dominant strain. changed guidelines PCR testing don’t use ‘prove’ science. 
We know happens, data gauge scope. civil. Thank you. swear sub looks essential employees forced work sometimes want restaurants closed. Michael Osterholm last night said going get worse England variant plus superbowl parties. guess everyone Covid burnout want hear actual infectious disease expert says. think reports capture full scale number outbreaks? vaccination better vaccination. 

Well might accurate. could sorts problems giving low-efficacy vaccine, including things like giving people false sense security run infect people, interactions bad vaccine better ones people would later take, wasted resources bad vaccine could used better vaccines, etc. Two daughters teachers could qualify region. country ""overreacted"" spring got overconfident fall - ""overreaction"" much smarter choice let things get back normal much faster. Every time someone makes argument response always same. Feeding, housing, isolating risk much reasonable plan *actually* went with, isolate *everyone* *everyone else* year real plans support unemployed businesses permanently closed result lockdowns. 

Protecting risk *much* reasonable, sustainable, achievable plan actually went with. Thank great reply. life upended well - career, finances, everything. And, yes, comment may dismissive saying “everyone” wants party, truly believe virus going get worse worse worse come common idea protecting other. want things open good percentage Americans selfish take simple measures. entire anti-mask brigade ludicrous. it’s can’t nice things. Hmm, let’s think moment. said: 

1. Don’t implement travel restrictions infected countries 

2. Don’t wear mask unless you’re health care worker

3. evidence human human transmission despite growing number infections 

4. evidence airborne transmission despite scientists suggesting otherwise 

Actually countries best pandemic ones exact opposite suggested. Countries restricted travel, wore masks, treated virus like highly infectious airborne virus start ones best. ones listened got fucked. crazy considering possibility weekend getaway snowboarding trip? I’m last phase vaccinations operating assumption it’ll available make appointment mid-end April. wrong thinking along timeline based J&amp;J look supply wise, assuming get authorized also assuming occur use mRNA sequence, different dose sizes lipid nanoparticle ingredients. H1N1 ""longhauler"" checking in.

You want go lifestyle change acquiring multisystemic neurological problems, especially adolescent. Problems including never ending muscle spasms cramps, fleeting weakness, heart palpitations, skin rashes, swelling, more.

I suppose argue case rare outlier I'm fear mongering, studies circulating COVID longhaulers imply level reasonable concern warranted.

Keep mind I'm imploring hermetic lifestyle, warning consequences chronic illness. glib, stay safe. states did. Fortunately live one. think CYA move. media today looking ""gotcha"" moments, people get crucified say something turns incorrect, even based best information time. using cases argument? hospitalizations follow double peak? testing correlates cases hospitalizations. that?

the pcr test, know, severely flawed identifying actual case don’t understand they’re saying vaccinated people still spread like it’s fact. isn’t enough data sure yet, say that. saw lying public masks early backfired you’re absolutely correct backfire too. I’ve followed pretty much every recommendation far logic tells based pretty much every vaccine history least much less likely spread virus we’re vaccinated. I’ll continue wear mask distance public I’m asked friends family vaccinated going back socializing normally other. Agreed. lack viral genomic data Brazil, investigating urgently. 
Let’s hope evolution evasion slow. warned spreading meta drama many times. Please stop, result ban. needs affirmative instead saying shit like “We believe human human transmissions” “We believe it’s Lab”.

Failure organisation can’t argue independent investigations. I'm much better last month. mother (nurse) 88 year old grandfather fully vaxxed. wife relaxed kids still showing anxiety public. presume way think changing recommendations. laid thread. yes, article extremely representative harms misinforming public sake believe would best public, especially undermines something important vaccination uptake. Sunday Monday always going first hit that... Tues-Sat. Let’s this!!! Tests aren’t consistently picking variants. Wait see. Oxford team still confident vaccine strong effect severe illness/death SA train - trial data yet. 

Why give ""confidence"" value? Also, actually use word ""confident"", something like ""we think likely"" something else like that? I'm not. I've wearing masks socially distancing best them. get vaccine, will. literally almost nothing fear decent health age 70. I'm devaluing someone's life they're old weak, perhaps people risk quarantine instead everyone it.

But perhaps two week nationwide shutdown back March 2020 would've also done trick. heard right - I'll start few. I've missed them. seem putting lot credence social media comments anonymous strangers. Meanwhile US states sat asses nothing API months. 100% effective vaccine trial population, didn’t include elderly infirm. let’s dismiss idea could accidentally leaked lab studies exact family viruses! Didnt Pfizer say 100% agaisnt death? guidance probably (at least partially) effort keep haven’t vaccinated comfortable / still adhering it. Use best judgement based science. 

Do want person wearing mask you’re toward end line? Maybe not. monstrous asshole decide flout mask full vaccination? Probably not. 

There probably isn’t perfect guidance issue kinda messy vaccination ramp time, they’ll lean toward caution. big whoop, imo. many humans managed adapt situation social interaction illegal, massively shunned upon masses? Tripling production delivery late March sounds pretty realistic, least. Dunno it'll happen quick enough March goal. context public? could see people continuing wear masks public transport maybe stores after, bars/nightclubs/restaurants/parks? - literally zero chance start smoking, you’ll able get next phase. 

/s wasn’t obvious Oh sure we're still 100k day yeah let's throw fucking party!  ready Perfect Peggy stop screaming anyone daring anything besides meekly sitting obeying orders! Fauci's trying make mistake made masks, good him. Nope. Guess again. fact, broaden MS 1 million people US autoimmune disease, estimated 5-8% US population suffers autoimmune disease. lowball estimate, that's 16 million people trust me, we're treated like crap society medical system. Well stop spreading misinformation then! 🤣 Also keeps warm lol received shots yet. Guess many people Brazil get infection genetically tested.....
Not many. guess makes running ball SB 49. aware that. [My county coronaviruses colds, probably severe novel. Better I've put actual end date restrictions.

July 4th, first NASCAR Cup race Wisconsin since 1958, first actual event since September, 2019. (The last game played fans Miller Park). headline bit silly without context. recently, 100% COVID deaths worldwide people vaccinated. used go bars talk people. used go sporting events scream exciting moments along others. used go concerts sing top lungs hundreds people. things smiled others smiled back, sharing human connection. made life living. worry getting sick every moment over. true basically every one. sub gives impression people going carry like millstone rest life. real world feels. all. wish people sub would stop spreading misinformation comments posts, outside daily thread.

They get hundreds upvotes either flat saying implying SA Brazilian variants mean we're fucked frustrating Absolutely decision. friends kids cancer years keep kid home year normal times. Interestingly, friend's son leukemia right now, oncologist says school fine. Covid impacting cancer kids since there's little flu year, worried normal year. understand people's obsession avoiding unpleasant thoughts. makes fake. think that’s seasonal effect. hospitalization/death numbers at/below average flu years, wouldn’t call “wave.” Really sucks. want chat/share, hit up. send dm. Yesterday talks needing negative covid test prior domestic air travel, vaccines accepted, even more.  Okay?

We know Trump fucked up. objective fact point. going explain Biden physically could done short time he's office explain massive drop cases, especially beginning case drop began somewhere around week took office. assumption ""50M originally promised"" means ""50M 100M"" fully incremental 120M.

Thus, think means 150M end March, definitely entirely clear. Either way, great news. lot states have? Mine barely shut ways. remember job opening wuhan virology website. page posted time mid November 2019, 1 month first viral pneumonia case reported Wuhan.

The job opening looking virologist around world. studying bats coexist many diesieses. One main diesies testing coronavirus. one back 2001 believe.

What believe happened finished testing bat, sold nearby wuhan wet market, someone bought bat, contracted virus way.

It's suspicious happened testing bats coronavirus, one month later people bought wet market nearby started showing symptoms coronavirus cherry pick like, 10 days last year represent social everyone been?

\*looks kids family barely seen friends year\* People die preventable causes time. always have, always will. Trying eliminate it, destroy people's lives livelihoods process making life worth living lives standard 'this needs eradicating!', empathetic sociopathic yourself. worst case scenario vaccinate people widely circulating variants variants E484K mutation allowed run unchecked restrictions lift. 

Then we’d back square one. square one, back place restrictions updated vaccines. 

This isn’t guarantee, it’s likely point based limited info have.

Yes Modern Pfizer vaccines lots protection variants still (though it’s determined limited lab setting), it’s likely JNJ pretty well reduced efficacy AZ’s basically completely ineffective vs mutation. US plummet April 1

Do think get niece reduced mortality sixth birthday? “But, Muh Side Ho’s!” Communists Sadly Six Flags America generally considered worst Six Flags park.

You might better getting Kings Dominion going bit farther park days. Williamsburg far, get Busch Gardens pass, that's one best parks world. point silly. picked throwaway example path. 

Mink viable pathways, wild meat like pangolins possible pathways, direct contact wild bats viable pathway. Literally anything could become contact bats humans vulnerable SARS-CoV-19 viable pathway. aren’t school 52 weeks. like 40 weeks. Plus can’t know cases transmitted campus within community. Maybe would occurred even schools closed anyway. Regardless greater good educating children matters more."
