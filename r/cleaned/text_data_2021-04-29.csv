0,2021-04-29," here, never got flu vaccine till year. concerned myself, found 50, 000-100,000 people year die flu. never clicked before. lives matter much die covid, would hypocrite start getting flu shot every year. obviously doesn’t mean it. It’s literally different Eddie fucken Bravo coming show going, “look, I’m crazy, don’t listen me, but...*insert two hour long conspiracy rant here.*” proves much contagious covid flu. Testing day, big difference.

Testing working flights people week test actually flying, getting infected. Indeed. land morons half wit man king. India DRASTICALLY underreporting numbers. government purposefully suppressing data too, it’s absurd. Thanks detailed reply. Depends touching nose mouth...  mean win? Disagreeing ""reserving judgement,"" passing judgement find claim false.

So evidence presented either way, general, fine utilize greater breadth knowledge subject. They’re giving people first dose Moderna second dose Pfizer Moderna deliveries delayed. That’s meant ""problematic,"" four month delay mistake.

Also, per earlier comment, it’s ""up to"" four months, ""exactly"" four months. People receive second dose within four months soon supply allows (which earlier 4 months supply continues way it’s projected May July). Vaccines like virus scanners computer. Virus scanners keep computer getting virus, good cleaning computer ""infected"".

Does everyone think getting vaccine get virus?

Health professionals working hard get public understand vaccine do. read their/your username assumed giving nickname pink mush OP coughing up...

It’s long day. Flu seasonal see need get production fast??? flue back...its transmitted easily birds humans. Spotify acting like they're loving every second controversy That's crazy! got first dose almost 2 weeks ago period came week early unusual me, would never thought even connect two. also lot cramping pain ovaries days cycle started, wonder happen second dose. Narrator: *it didn't* open revolt mobs

Monsoon season start doubt that's going happen, make crisis worse. today announced everyone book appointment next 2 weeks. Quebec getting enough vaccines May vaccinate everyone wants it. perfectly summed oof, ended closer 42% intention defending dude, really. thought good intentions thought could appreciate, understand hes meathead douchebag that's trying cover ass, repeatedly that. get it. wear mask indoor public places now, absolutely hate wearing one. hope pandemic creates good enough treatments vaccines adapted different viruses masks won’t quite necessary future. think vaccine hesitant people respond well threatened jail time? Seriously? talents intellect might better suited North Korea. good news vaccines seem helping people long covid symptoms like yours. issue people buying negative tests, people getting infected week flight since got test actually flying.

The best Covid tests super accurate, 54% best, even need high viral load detect virus. Woof. I'm sorry. Hope feel better soon. given every year though...  don’t like dr Drew either,  like loveline joe organ people learn sick mask (or better stay home) would greatly reduced. joke Istanbul December anti-vax tourists literally spitting ""prove"" nothing worry about. Got heck quickly, type tourist attracting unsavory. already kind today.

If knowingly infect somebody HIV [criminally places. 


There course arguments made around “intent” something like COVID. intent bypass protocols, gross negligence property protect guests, puts hot water somebody  think it’s going long tail. don’t wait online phone hope maybe get appointment weeks, instead walk pharmacy get offered dose, procrastinators start it. You’re still 50000 cases day, around 1000 deaths day.

They're interested explaining world, rather furthering conspiracy theories such. 350,000 cases day india right now, read news Peanuts committing crime humanity. Come Mississippi! hospitals literally full India.

There's states empty hospitals, issue always India population distribution. mega-cities 20 million+ people 10 hospitals, vast rural areas hardly anyone. I’ve always good enough understanding viruses spread effectively avoid myself, pretty much never get sick. one thing didn’t know many people actually die flu every year. floored found out. didn’t know dying flu even thing, outside extremely old/infirm people would die anything. Masks 100% people wear they'er sick coughing. precaution others. Go new England!! important 3 weeks chosen rushing trials. 3 weeks minimum amount time Pfizer believed would safe effective doses. UK 12 weeks Canada 16 weeks depending supply. What’s deal Israel? country gold standard? Exporting vaccines hot button issue months.

I'm surprised they've hit point export since administration US slowing pretty quickly production presumably ramping up, surprised Pfizer trumpeting it. think flu deaths relabeled COVID. scary dangerous mainstream fringe conspiracy theory thinking become. still saying it. really anything... dodged take responsibility acting like meathead can't keep mouth shut things unqualified talk public, highly viewed setting. 

Also. Facui corrected him, 'disagreed' Rogan. Saying disagreed important topic suggesting somehow equals field... aren't, metric. Rogan got put place, rightfully so. 

I feel ... Bad? Sad? anyone listens Rogans podcast takes opinions heart acts them. flu right now. hosting podcast millions people explicitly fiction, they're going start listening opinions. goes. Joe Rogan might claim dumb, he's around long enough know this. someone US... hell going Ireland? Outdoor sports spectators starting June 7th 6 people meet outside starting middle may? Put masks animules missed century chance could aggressively flu vaccinated people maybe killed flu? whole family got young kids, probably try get us mindset, always got SUUUUPER sick, stopped going ( young remember), I've never gone gotten one it. debating changing we've COVID, reaction vaccine (tbf, vaccines different types, Rna vaccine Flu shot not) you’re making names.

Many people turn US border lost passport Mexico, UK one coming back France, border control ask series questions establish actually natural born citizen obliged grant entry, can't detain refuse entry. Yup, saying walked back statement others exercised 1A rights (likely sponsors). sponsor's money important opinion his, walked back. decision. So, walk back - wanted to. Huh....interesting...it's almost breathing reduces spread disease..... 
who would thunk it. 


Personally always thought West following suit Asian cultures wear masks sick. used work Hong Kong job would give us masks every use sick days get others sick sick. 


here US god forbid ask people wash hands. Can't impede freedom someone dirty poo hands.  Putting distance students whenever cut illnesses almost none school. went sick constantly nothing instantly. Made wonder ever differently. get shot two Pfizer vaccine Friday 

People don’t talk enough amazing success science speedy develop efficacy vaccines 

Much better political institutions. money science technology always Honestly would said thing year ago.  Sure that's true. point late current wave. difference new seasonal influenza strains tends emerge China Southeast Asia people live close proximity poultry pigs. human animal strains recombine create new human strains. People clapping back social distancing mask wearing, really, greatly reduced international travel Asian countries strict controls, new flu strains didn’t reach west winter.

This contrast common colds remained circulating especially kids catching first time. think widespread viral transmission countermeasures coincidentally stopping spread significantly LESS infectious family viruses transmission medium coronvirus sus? Thank you! sums lot facts people getting wrong around here. They're giving control group placebo second shot, they?   Oh neat, good know! wanted offer caution case got nucleocapsid-only test freaked :)  Lol ok. Well moron brigade doesn’t want them, send abroad help rest planet. I've wanted mask wearing acceptable America since got used Asia, though rather forcing everyone wear (I mean look amount anti-mask bs we've dealt pandemic), holy fucking shit flu awful it. simultaneously hot cold fucking awful. get flu shot every year reduces chances much 3.50%. Mask least helps remember touch face since used bad habit that. Cool. You’re fucking moron. opposed US slowing... God ashamed many countrymen ignorant. Tests imperfect. got happy second could also see that.

 ""Hey bro shit take mask weirdo"" - dude public train.  even known Covid lost sense smell. That's made go get test. still right four months later... Well story behind this:

Oct'20 - Double Mutant identified. 

Jan'21 - Kumbh Mela, world's largest religious gathering 100s millions, preponed 2022 advice motherfucking astrologers. fuckers go back corners India Nepal. top Jan thru April various mid-term election rallies. Cases steadily rise positivity rates go control. Result? FUBAR watching unfold. 

Complacency triggered it. total health care infrastructure collapse making humanitarian catastrophe.

Now, take breath think, THINK. talking 2nd populated country planet. I.e 1.4B fucking people. Let sink in. Next weeks months worst entire Pandemic.US, Italy Brazil's situation pale comparison. 

My prayers towards hoping vaccines work towards current virulent variants new ones. Otherwise fucked globally. 2c. man, fuck guy. geriatric folks died covid. besides, encouraging young people reckless/cavalier spreading covid results spreading people healthy are. selfish piece shit. happen?? I've weird sinus pressure congestion days.

That would probably reduced people got flu nothing 800 kids drowning year

There’s whole bunch rules prevent drowning deaths, mention lifeguards. I’m sure there’s work on, we’re certainly “doing nothing” Crossing fingers get high covid get choked out. Oh please. spokemen take brunt international disapproval billions people smoke too... Turkish economy greatly depends tourism income.  Olympics actually get held, probably get even worse. year since pandemic began, still difficult get tested, people died shuffled around told go another hospital willing admit them. government legal authority demand citizens anything everyone basically whatever hell like. Even people working Ministry Health went party got infected. stupidity mind-boggling. Yea but.... Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said strictest regulations world, would ""make apologies"".
Then, days later, Ms Ardern took unprecedented step closing borders entirely almost non-citizens residents. masks needed logical travel bans isolation. like ya fucking crazies deliberately coughing spitting people. didn’t set 200 plus citizens communities isolation returned China. Good leadership delivers good results. ""they"" taken every single virus testing lab country forced lie results. Also ""they"" managed keep lab techs perfectly silent, leakers. impressive conspiracy! /s damn HEeeedeeLllllll. smell sulfur Hillary’s presence left cowaaaaard. 1776 ride globalist scum suckers. know aren’t taking alpha pills! numbers support anecdote. problem rogan hides behind idea self-admitted moron. classic bait switch. says moron can't held responsible says, yet still hosts wildly popular podcast. wants cake eat too. classic instance post-modern deterioration stable reality. attempt hold two completely incompatible positions time, indeed contradictory. actualy, problem thinks admitting moranicy excuses Yep, we’ll see.

Covid back February spent three days worst chills nausea. heat turned mid 80's soaking hot baths warm up. eat three days, either. got it, persistent cough since. recently started paying attention VO2 max noticed dropped lot since catching Covid. keep trying push cardio exercise harder harder bring back up, happening. VO2 max right line above-average Covid, hair low yesterday. bought breath exerciser I'm going see help going forward. not, doctor go. shit real, folks! yes one way look it. looking impact point view. southern neighbor , 60million Mexico would greater impact holistically. Indians cover that. Oh god thought said it, that’s cursed...  also exercise nut prior getting hit covid. Could easily hour intense cardio prior getting covid. mild case covid could barely 2 minutes light cardio without feeling like winded would die. 

It's year later still able get cardiovascular shape back was. flu migrate winter seasons part every year. lack heavy international travel would seem main factor allowing flu make rounds. Republican putting restrictions employers powers? doubt Good choice.

I friend study exact topic. needed volunteer samples people who’ve gotten flu shots years. Well, I’ve every season since least far back 2002 (military), said antibodies every flu antigen tested for. lol

When 2009 H1N1 came San Antonio, felt like trash week, never got anything near “emergency room sick”. firm computers maintenance coding released today new requirements location work offices: hours, 1 person office wearing mask keeping safe distance must fully vaccinated. come.

Good them. agree completely. felonies killing people stealing car happens time. People care Hypochondriac much? Also gyms like restaurants pretty risky areas. always wear mask gym. 😐  cousin said asked zip code, presume basing live. Same, sick once. Knock wood. Woo testing less positive cases, let’s goooooo read Alex Jones' voice im convinced   Preach friend! Tell it!!! People need hear it. real. Losses orbit year now. NY. ages. Talked friend Colorado weekend, disaster there. Triathletes, pro skiers , lift workers struggle breathe even lingering effects contracting it. live high altitude well different lung capacity have, Covid kicked shit them. World class skiers..Felt like cinderblock chest Covid weeks/ months . scary!!! virus friends. honestly say didn’t get bad. lucky especially considering hadn’t heard covid got wasn’t later told that’s had. fever two days felt like worst flu ever. said year covid swallow mucus time constantly cough STILL especially morning. It’s gross. worrying future...no cigars me! Ha kidding cigars thing. love hiking mucus funnel now. Sorry mucus talk. Awful. Parents vaccinated, seems like tried everything right, soon spring break vacation vaccines kids yet. high say need indoor masks go? shit Kansas got early on, we're pretty good compared lot. hope do. Stop idiot protect family/friends. don't. I'll take freaking job, jagoff! may actually worse that... sure articulate why. Maybe feel larger audience... maybe sort difference men women. could wrong feels like women stake entire self image femininity words Gwyneth Paltrow, may build lifestyle around may talk lot never convinced otherwise... feel like bros put entire self image masculinity Joe Rogan says what/how Men capital act do. reason think different worse. confirmed 3 things pandemic:

 1) little effort could significantly reduce things like flu, common colds, STDs. Get vaccinated, get tested, go sick, must, wear mask.

 2) could drastically reduce incidences built society around things like idea staying home work sick rewarded punished. 

 3) won't. mean long term? research, really good research, asks questions really gets people open up. Watch first interview Elon Musk, go watch recent one. Night day \~ 8 month lockdown ended COVID elimination Melbourne, Australia, many people got got sick sorts bugs. debt paid point. I, one, delighted this. Ontario also opening scheduling everyone 24th. weird, flu vaccine reportedly 50% effective, right?  Honest question...how reconcile CDC guidance around risk “Individual close contact (within 6 feet total 15 minutes more”. Outdoors, well ventilated, UV, etc. Even walk person COVID-19 (2 second exposure?), science says minuscule risk exposed sufficient viral load infection. Corruption poor governance Modi/BJP exacerbated lack medical infrastructure.


Sprinkle massive political rallies religious events common sense health measures place along dash nationalistic exceptionalism good measure voila! contact got vaccine ask proof? 

I'm sure possible, retroactively vaccine 100% effective blocking transmission infection, still grounds creating resistant variation? Even 100% vaccinated, vaccine say 90% effective, thats enough people dormant virus, speading mutating. Sometimes even give gift card get feel comfortable so, I'd allow vaccinated visitors. Wanna see baby? Get shot. Apparently currently 10 close finished rest somewhere? production. Everything welcome doubt we'll see big numbers Watermelon buddy! Flu several years ago along spouse. fact body hurt much prevented sleeping tell everyone thinks Flu shots bullshit. sick want sleep, despite taking pain relievers, achy sleep. WILD me. able take Tamiflu almost instantly got symptoms spouse first gave us prescriptions it. fact Tamiflu probably helped illness less time. always fan getting flu shot, year new job offer us made point go own. Never again. Flu shots every year! India, takes 60% world vaccine production capacity. Obviously yet shortened. still looking vaccinating around 60% adult population. 

Once demand first dose dries need keep people waiting tons jabs sitting around. turns vaccine risky virus healthy 30s/40s/whatever, what, give thus never get herd immunity? keep locking forever? seems logical conclusion basing individual risk taking current prevalence virus. too, get flu every 10 years it’s nothing, desperate get covid vaccine, think I’ll get flu shot year too. Conspiracy theorists: aha! KNEW shipment delays weather result, cancellation appointments. vaccine arrived quantity, going much like clockwork. People finding easier get appointment finding community vaccination sites. mobile vaccination buses going apartment complexes city areas. help lot homebound people. Thank you, 3rd friend. Actually, new. Researchers trying define entirely new classification virus symptom set seen possible silver lining look forward mRNA flu shots future. Hopefully better have. got J&amp;J suspension best choice. done healthy. vaccines leaky. I'm definitely going start getting mine every time well. know before. Every time get flu always really nasty. guess thinking since I'm young healthy let reserved vulnerable, thinking herd immunity. Whoa. tinnitus nose. Someone else called bro science worst, that’s hilarious Holy fuck. Cant people watch Joe make minds vaccine. argument Joe needs careful says null. cant use mind listening really shouldn't. Yeah. got yelled grocery store wearing mask “touching face make spread!”

I got yelled neighbor washing car. 

I got shamed kids riding bikes friends. 

A lot insanity. Due experts. There’s nothing wrong using judgement. Farmers' protests (yes still going on) responsible spreading UK variant New Delhi.

In Delhi, UK variant contributes 50% cases. Punjab high 81%, brought Double mutant epicenter Vidarbha (Maharashtra) spread neighbouring Elections Bengal Kumbh Haridwar(Uttarakhand) main reason second outbreak. originated states Maharashtra Punjab. gym open season, thing they're sanitization working machine, masking distancing tho, still 0 case day since June last year. similar experience commenter. (38F got Pfizer) arm sore right away 2nd shot, 24 hours after, felt tired rundown. took Tylenol, went bed, fine next morning. husband (41M also Pfizer) almost exact experience. Good luck! vaccines make antigen protein, identical COVID mRNA-and-other vaccines work.

I dont think thats quite right. 

mRNA carries genetic RNA instructions body becomes flu antigen factory. 

Current flu vaccines inject already created antigen you. get bits pieces flu without infection. body detects pieces, dosent make them. 

With flu mist, actually get mild flu infection replicate nose, virus can't live inside body. comfortable breathing air others around us

How dare... we? also born vagina covered blood, totes gross.  Eating gas station roller food think easing outside would helpful - light exercise (walking) may leave less exhausted, especially exhaustion mental stress. Maybe take Uber eats outdoors park. ""i think young people need get vaccinated"" stupid, ""clearly false information""

I'm saying I'll continue say, sub pissed wrong people. pissed Joe shitty opinions pissed people take medical advice Joe Rogan. I’m hoping get vaccines everything technology. stayed whole year one aspect spectacular never getting sick. could combine actually going world? Wow would great.  states (all?) vaccination registry Yes someone also said yesterday means it’s impossible thought yesterday One 3 people mentioned though least highly educated...  think it’s pretty much given people don’t really care people aren’t close circles. No, basic responsibilities like spreading clearly false information could put millions people risk, embarrass oneself forced retract moronic information shared day before... absolute basics. FWIW sore arm like flu shot, felt tired rundown day 2nd shot. Fine next day. hope much trouble it! data children risk simply incomplete. particular, studies long term
effects children even less far along adults studies seen seem come conflicting results. really don’t great sense likely kids get Covid unmasked world haven’t existed world all. Schools proving safe schools also many stringent mitigation strategies place, including generally requiring masks. Youth sports proving seemingly problematic spread standpoint. 

I live area saw measles resurgence couple years ago, child young vaccinated time. really worrying go family. would hate return feeling (and measles much dangerous Covid vaccinated child, risk exposed Covid exponentially greater risk measles exposure brief resurgence due people opting vaccines letting herd immunity lapse). 

I don’t disagree number immunocompromised people can’t vaccinated effectively likely low. also don’t disagree risk variant developing US vs countries low. 

Where disagree strongly idea benefit stopping indoor masking public short term outweighs harms. Even harms may small outweigh benefit wearing mask opinion see benefit extremely small. What's odor similar to? Man someone found Rogan's podcast early depressed twenties like 12 episodes out... really fucking sucks see he's ended days. Nowhere word vomit bullshit provide single source. literally listen newer podcasts cause this. He's become way political me. wish could go back 2016-2019 Rogan Fucking bad 2018 well, took nearly 2 weeks fully fully get past it. years flu variant punch it. understand, nonsense form cancer wish best luck. essential. safe, everyone safe. Covid care ethnicity, nationality, borders wars. humanity common enemy right beat together. guy work got Moderna shot, said like ""the way made feel"". achy day. going wait get J&amp;J shot.... blood clot thing happened get shot, ever. symptoms happen, extremely rarely would symptoms happen single individual.

Anecdotally, dozen people know fully vaccinated, including myself, none symptoms described except arm pain, curiosity actually painful. Yeah, removed much uncertainty. people don’t care. Many people do. don’t see possible, given released placebo group upon publishing first set statistics, need placebo / control group determine efficacy. Might deter though  reasons. flu come somewhere. Usually southern hemisphere bad season brings northern hemisphere, vice versa. countries bad travel down.

Some percentage people, even areas open, adhering guidelines reduce spread. Handwashing, sanitizer usage, mask wearing everywhere.

The states ""open"" know fully open. Take Florida, instance. Disneyworld open, Rays playing front fans, Wrestlemania took place weeks ago. reduced capacity, around 20-40% normal.

Flu usually R0 around 1.5. measures we've taken reduced spread 50%, cases decline. 33%, cases remain steady.

The worst months flu December - February. Texas earliest state recall saying opening everything up, March. Even areas people ignored guidelines acted mostly usual February, reduced spread December January. Typically February cases come infections people January, got infected people got infected people December, forth. lot infections December January, going many opportunities infections February March. completely agree, ""vaccine hesitancy"" take overcome, make selves safer home vaccinating people want vaccination abroad.  Hmmm.... people still choose think masks social distancing work. Hmmm.... Real sport? talking like bowling fly fishing something?    hope rebuild trust two countries again, USA begin steps towards rebuilding relations neighbors. map basically mirrors political maps. live rural Texas county went 80% Trump vaccines people willing get vaccinated. Pretty much everybody going get already gotten around here. worried larger population getting *any* doses  best act gets worse. sense smell completely gone? Like can't tell someone smoking next you? can't smell garlic onions frying pan? things dampened smell strong used to? know last time someone posted Joe Rogan dropping audience 40%? shit like this. He's become buff Alex jones  dont need shit right freedom movement legally restricted multiple reasons.  Including public health.

You can’t *arbitrarily* deny citizens returning. pandemic valid reason. obviously know humanities war viruses. exact said vaccine. wrong goes whole reality entire process beating pandemic. Viruses mutate find host. host vaccinated virus even stand chance mutating. immune system recognizes attacks immediately. replicate. Lol lie dont want get it, employers way proof without legal trouble basic responsibilities like disagreeing opinion? I’ll check thanks! suspicions, seem lean little towards conspiracy bs. Lol now. Gotta get Belli back

Happy cake day! That’s good point - admit got frustrated last time. I’ll go next time little better prepared. Everyone thinks vaccine shield protect yourself.

It's not. wall protect family, families. subreddit acts cultish times.  ask cite sources cite like would debate. get people call moron, he's dude podcast. He's bad person. He's guy likes talk opinions hear peoples. 

You mad people take word gospel, fact opinion. 

I listen Joe Rogan even though heavily disagree lot stances. He's entertainer. illustrate COVID flu, [there flu epidemic Social distancing mask wearing quashed flu. 

COVID kicked butts court. Pfizer moderna continued testing, tested newer variants j&amp;j, efficacy stayed . flu gone Joe Rohan idiot. fucking idea got popular. Even places mask mandates, lot people still wear masks socially distance. apparently enough keep r&lt;1. both.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* listened Rogan cool? explanation nobody heard podcast first 3-4 years suddenly ca 2015 something magical happened turned kind podcast superstar? That's almost 0.25% country's population. would recover that? way shape insult anything negative thing. read lot posts people comparing physical ability absolute health. course big factor. people also get fit shitty diet. 

So question, diet? I'm trying find really healthy people (eat well, excercise regular, good genes) also risk mayor covid symptoms.

I know answer hence question. colourblind friendly first glance, dots aid reading this.  Joe “I believe whatever you’re talking long you’re show” Rogan can’t compare raw numbers like that. course 21% 40m half 26% 80m. it’s proportion. EU distributing vaccines proportionally country’s population. 

Germany yesterday distributed 1,1m vaccine Denmark vaccinated 1,3m people first time total. they’re still 20s %, equally well like rest EU!

As anti vaxxers don’t know say. hope prediction wrong, though, I’ve got family friends Poland would love visit safely again. Bear mind dealing self proclaimed man ape probably testosterone 50 50, 50 year old men.  Longtime Joe Rogan fan. also strongly support vaccination.

I go scientific advice. Getting upset waste mental emotional energy.   become insufferable douche.

Just ~~are~~ funny point career, mean people listening life advice, yet that's exactly happens schmucks. depend many infected people community - answer would 5 times higher January US now. given variable case loads across world (and even US), meaningless try estimate without accounting that.

I mean, sure, expect 90-95% less risk someone eating outdoors restaurant without vaccinations, know baseline risk, can't calculate 90-95% less. don’t think proportion anti vaxxers USA higher countries. Even Trump-suppprting boomer republicans work 30-something wine-mom-healing-crystal types tried sign soon could. 1. wasn’t anti-vaccine comment. 
2. didn’t walk back shit. Used to. Moved Texas relatively recently   ""God wish never signed guy""

someone Spotify, probably mean like every year Japan ? Nah moved back idiots think strong immune system overlook children probably got vaccines nastiest diseases known man, also access wide array antibiotics help fight infection. didnt help like third would dead now. People *already* given jobs based personal beliefs, beliefs directly harmful others work (or least management thinks be). That's ""slippery slope"", that's way jobs always been. Yes coercion great way get people side. worked well history. vaccines work all. lot less data I'm general moderna versus Pfizer firstly Moderna much smaller company. Secondly, Biontech/Pfizer deal Israel prioritize vaccination. return Israel gave access immense amount data lot information vaccine came from. need know although extremely risk averse health officials eager sued people moderna tell 99% everything hear Pfizer vaccine also true moderna vaccine. difference vaccines pretty much negligible. contain instructions literally inside unique lipid coatings.  25F! Oh sorry buddy got tuberculosis thought I’d share it! tired dense idiots.

Morons like virulent variants opportunity crop up.  know it. asking t-cells statement Apparently WA too. checked, state site shows got first shot 17th. Even includes lot number dose.

I’m scared getting Chinese vaccine case can’t enter UK. Listing lady gave chills. can't believe people still trying defend government. sources I've heard say still transmit virus vaccinated. depend sources.

His point valid, upset it. heard one source say stop spreading virus vaccinated.

On surface, smell seems like pretty superficial sense one people would pick lose lose one, losing ability smell would wreak much havoc life losing others. Let’s see many colleges require August. probably every one except niche religious schools. Full FDA approval help.

That assumption seems fit current data.  Joe Rogan Trump style gaslighting suppose that's buddy buddy ""celebrity"" Fauci recognised professional studying medicine epidemiology longer maybe alive. also celebrity oversees research infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis malaria) experience talking infectious diseases. also responsible overseeing research recent threats like Ebola zika virus. plenty experience emerging epidemiological threats. mention quick research shows Fauci ranks 9th 2.5 million authors field immunology. 



I personally think opinions ""celebrity"" matter bit guy used host tv shows commentator MMA finally host podcast desperately seeks approval amazing magic mushrooms  ""Covid like flu"" happening India regular annual thing. American living Australia, heartbreaking see different levels concern community members. Australia, tolerate almost risk community, America tolerate almost inconvenience individual. 

Obviously, I'm speaking generalities. American family friends taken Covid seriously throughout vaccinated small serious cohort Aussie anti-vaxxers we're perfect either.   Soooo doctorate immunology? 
What says opinion, based type research. Pure observation &amp; skewed leanings .  Dang, snot isn’t bad doubt anyone would want shit throat. avoid it? Gee, bunch know-it-NOT-at-all celebrities power spread lies.    Germany could 1M/day 7-day average would amazing. looking spiky nature graph, think that's true.

Hard believe guy hosted Fear Factor... vaccine allows 'hang out' longer? Come think seen lot penguins around year.  ""I said young, healthy person need it"" sounds like doubling me, walking back. Fauci said, perspective speaking though vacuum, never public, tantamount selfish, paranoid, uncaring anti-vaxx statement. Hey guys, find info Cansino vaccine (chinese) one offered country, decided better remain unvaccinated found conflicting info regarding efficacy.

Also people got vaccine still catch covid reports young healthy people even worse symptoms. Also let's forget know zero mRNA vaccines long term, scientists theorise nothing happen, will? get vaccine even care yourself. mom getting care claims low risk (yeah, dumb true reason low risk anyway) selfish. grandkids?   figured out, eh? could possibly go wrong....

... stupid people get?? increasingly resisting social distancing towns cities ease restrictions, cheered President Jair Bolsonaro.

If president encouraging behaviour obviously pandemic spread more. Ultimately fact anyone profiting pandemic businesses forced closed go bankrupt fairly disgusting. say someone whos company benefitted greatly pandemic. 

Im saying losing money too, probably type higher temporary taxes businesses benefitted compensate made sacrificed, largely societal decision throw bus. Basically two arguments discussed. First individual argument where, Joe claims, COVID deadly disease Children young adults comorbidities. Whereas, seasonal flu hospitalizes children per annum. backed CDC organizations. Secondly collectivistic perspective individual’s duty take vaccine protect community large. latter agreed with. former weak argument based upon unfounded evidence. Good know. full year human trials point. great silver lining- ppl converting anti-vaxers showing carnage India. Atleast good come devastation.   afaik pharmacies supplied directly feds, state california supplies things like mass vax sites. might also proximity. drive mass vax site theres pharmacy around corner? ""Mandatory"" strong word. think forced government. think private business absolutely feel entitled require office workers warehouse workers vaxxed. can't run business half employees at-risk spreading Covid. colleges/Universities. likely coronaviruses become light colds people. theorized covid too, eventually, population gets exposed us Canada. got first moderna three weeks ago. aren’t giving second one July 29/21 change efficacy? read somewhere people getting sick well first shot second shot supposed weeks first fourth months lol Thing is, already plenty data shows single dose works well, large part vaccination program UK. See example: Schools kids masked, distanced, pods don’t see broader group kids, rules needing stay school based potential exposure. It’s incredibly different world around unmasked strangers could potentially carriers. 

I could really see relaxing indoor mask rules sub 1% test positivity honest. would absolutely love happen - we've learned masks effective, so, many infections came people simply refused wear (or got lazy, etc). Yes, many religiously wore masks got sick worse, overall infections absolutely managed mask wearing. 

BUT

I faith habit carrying over. Even aware, educated, science-loving friends either forget shrug off. I'd love see people rock N95 running store winter protect themselves/others flu season, I'd love see people go ""my wife sick flu, I'm buying chicken soup wearing mask I'm infectious, I'm protecting others.""

It happen. happen simple:

- me, literally anyone cities
- Girlfriend sick, run Walgreens wearing mask
- customer decides loudly tell need wear mask somehow I'm infringing freedoms

Probably happen most, it'll happen enough well known thing. @germany? company giving gift certificates away getting it, also explicitly respect choice get one. ones take tested every two weeks. neil tyson elon musk leftist? hardly even political Nothing, call double aspects uk California variant shouldn't. right. Even could treat air, doubt would useful. robots operate absence people. treat air people present, needed. UV disinfectant machines air draw air them, clean it, push back side.

Bombay, Michigan? already way. surprising. 23,9% one dose, 8,7% fully vaccinated. population 80 76% fully vaccinated 90% 1+ dose. That's standard disclaimer South Park too.

Right public health officials super excited medicine public health look like COVID. 

1. Many countries expanded public health coverage. 
2. Many nations set protocols sharing medical research disease surveillance. 
3. Companies university research institutions result covid using software makes way easier share collaborate research. 
4. Hospitals, research institutes, governments way gene sequencers used covid they’ll sitting idle, expensive they’ll figure use them. 
5. public much better informed personalized medicine gene sequencing whatnot. 
6. several new vaccine technologies including mRNA received ton funding result many therapies. Vaccines don’t viral bacterial diseases. also genetic diseases. Teach body recognize kill cancer. 

This isnt last pandemic ever have, may last globally crippling one.  fine country allows younger students getting actually get vaccinated, however, Canada places started vaccinating 30+, I’m going either uni college soon heaven forbid province actually gets shit together say hey, maybe everyone get vaccinated (older people hesitation getting vaccine allowed A.Z scares waiting Pfizer instead, province moved age group complaining vaccines)

P.s sorry format- phone Louisiana Mississippi require neither proof residence insurance. vaccine, specifically supply chain. medical assistance, like helping get gloves, masks, sedatives, machines concentrate oxygen....

Yes, chances low. Nothing life safe, ABSOLUTELY nothing guarantee except death. Hmm I'm surprised ask point, even webpage asked fill stuff could skip section. sometimes things disorganized.

However, millions young people listen actually get advice information it, becomes something completely different. 

Joe continually refused accept that. wants act like insanely powerful podcast still selling Fleshlights talking legalizing weed. 

As ""argument"" Joe, realize vaccine much people you????

This pandemic really opened eyes lot celebrities used respect. Joe certainly one completely changed opinion on. Literally says every episode “I’m moron take say fact”  find hard believe people hate masking much aren’t already vaccinated ignoring rules already. 

Masks indoors thing allowing children go indoors safely community spread ongoing. Clinical trials used test vaccines new therapies. average vaccine clinical trial lasts 10-15 years approved general population. minimum 3 phases trials, increasing size. Phase 1 usually dozen healthy people, phase 2 hundreds try work dosing, phase 3 thousands try work issues general population.

Be smart. Get vaccinated. Enough people mindset things back normal really soon. I'm distinct impression AZ underproduced everywhere.

Obviously best thing vaccinate everyone, but, numbers are, makes lot sense give everyone one shot give half people two. Ok. I'm anti-science, even close. matters science coming from.

The past 4 years seen drastic cuts/elimination research filtering research FDA EPA particular politicians Trump administration.

Same happened Brazil Jair Bolsonaro. People getting fired contradicting Jair things like Covid climate change/Brazilian Rain Forest.

Saying smart people involved good enough reason assume everything involving science board, scientist usually ones power.

Companies censor science hide damning information product safety. Tobacco Oil industries come mind. EPA FDA come mind thinking Trump Administration.

Even well intentioned honest scientist gate-keepers, twist censor research.

I'm saying happening, live world 1 shot Pfizer could effective, Pfizer's CEO/board members/shareholders pushing 2 profit.

I’m open convinced otherwise but... Enough vaccinated doesn’t matter. would ever want anything forced you? better literally means better. Like said, get proactive vs. reactive I’m sure would “do better” repeating year long standstill. ""Dramatic Benefits""? doubt it. little better efficacy probably longer effective vaccine life.

This biggest question, important 2nd dose? doubt single pfizer shot would give efficacy month least year, maybe 2nd dose prolongs another year, would nice know since many countries could benefit right stopping pandemic way faster giving single pfizer shot.

For time being, likely separate sections religious medical exemptions vaccines social distancing enforced. You’re also idiot. AFAIK, Pfizer even submitted request yet 6+ months. Moderna requested EUA 12+, let alone 6+ months.

I'm guessing Pfizer 12-15 approved next week week after. *hope* 6+ months coming school year starts late August. Israel showed decent results vaccination levels low 50%.

With restrictions still place. It’s effective.

Why?

Because point deploying vital resources area allow area continue ignore issue hand.

Fantastic. think one planet make better use vaccines India. certainly better get shots, I'm sure nothing language (""dramatic benefits"") helping.

Most people, large margin, get second shot get first. people getting first would took one? J&amp;J, know pretty popular, excitement seems waned pause.

I think honest saying ""one shot great, two better protects longer"" probably gets amount people getting shots *may* convince people get one, certainly way better nothing. Canada taking approach also! agree first dose policy. Covid numbers collapsing NJ. love see it. Gone R value 0.92 0.63 like week. Vaccines hopefully new strategies like offering walk ins continued campaigns keep numbers 20-40k first doses another month two. Either way we’re gonna great spot month two now.  Exactly, spike protein attached nothing behind dead end. fascinates many people convinced vaccine long term damage confident Covid poses less chance that.

One like key stuck front door lock you.  like key front door hand junkie. knows fuck get he’s there.  recent paper (from Netherlands think) showed risk kid passing person lived half risk adult. kid kid risk it’s much lower adults. two/three weeks late, ok. get rid restrictions, seems like unvaccinated get much faster. Maybe help lot places US already fully open though want travel certain countries need get vaccinated certain things. nothing new. late implemented immediately say expressly said that? vaccines fully approved FDA, top military brass mandate settled issue. Bullshit. Covid-19 deadly individuals 20 times? Stop talking ass. vast majority people get Covid fine. Imagine throwing away current career putting former employer blast refusing shot 1 billion doses given world. didnt lose job, significantly harmed future jobs process.  Nothing, vaccine work fine. Indian variant really concerning like media portrays. comment. China?

Island island china island peinsula Island island. Peinsula peinsula. educate people smart enough want higher pay need worked for. ""my scenario"" is. Congratulations! worth, looking available evidence, really reason suspect myocarditis *caused by* vaccine.  agree approaching, doesnt meant stop 63% tho since lot people still getting 1st shot, remember, since lot walk-ins out, appointment stats matter less Awesome! Bear mind takes weeks vaccination fully kick in, generally deaths 2 weeks infection. death rate reflects number vaccinated month ago. Similar results minus headache getting second Pfizer shot yesterday morning.  [Also sending 5 million shots I’m visiting Florida June, already full blown nightclubs concerts Miami already 22 years old. THANK FUCK. got vaccine nonsense. girlfriend suffers pill.

I get 2nd dose AZ watch fuckers.  2/3rds 66% fairly close numbers thrown around potential herd immunity levels. ""largest"" anything? Lots people read National Enquirer too. fact one self-branded ""news"" network isn't, kind academic. good example trying prove people wrong J&amp;J vaccine. many people choosing think traditional vaccine contain DNA. wrong, better keep mouth shut try correct them. idea, maybe wait numbers go significantly deciding everything ok risking people can't get vaccinated, like kids. can't believe someone voted you. exactly doing, returning normal second vaccine. Lmao, medical version ""pass bill find what's it!"" good mix Yes. printer, get card stock, tech know-how get image work. buy one online someone. people go route like said, especially die-hard anti-vaxxers.

But vast majority lazy decide get vaccine. It’ll path least resistance. really fit sub? completely different coronavirus ""traits akin"" SARS-CoV-2 nothing pandemic. may prudent countries control. may end variant resistant current vaccines, time know exists already spreading. think pressing luck. arguing keep mass gatherings since corporations giving hospitals oxygen? one. yelling void.  “The vaccine” kind vague, referring vaccines currently approved US. Also, statement still applies (all?) vaccines approved across globe embarrassing colleges mandating non-FDA approved, emergency vaccine?

k words, get two shots supposed to, worry variants. India know producing mRNA vaccines? It’s brand new technology even western pharma companies lack knowledge produce.

It’s simple building vaccine factory start producing vaccines. people involved know they’re understand technology implement mass scale. hope return completely normal. learned *lot* jobs WFH capable.

Unless talking vaccines vs mumps stuff get high school.

Also news cause everyone comfortable getting vaccine, mean ""anti-vax"" forced getting want go school, pretty huge news IMO. guarantee isn’t FDA approved ones. think AIDS vaccine schools would require it?

That SINGLE shot given out, chosen strains contained it. I’m guessing many new exemptions “religious reasons” used fall easier get people get second shot already got get first one. pretty uneducated Like Kane Richardson Adam Zampa? variant Brazil makes Vaccines

Well technically want make *other people’s* vaccines, agree. Another lie AZ never overpromised, communicated thought would achieve time,"" Soriot told media briefing, adding AstraZeneca delivered 50 million doses EU end April.

Today 30/04 they've delivered 34 million. lie something easy disprove? Recent UK study begs differ strangers? also weight also affect since people talking gaining 10+ pounds... PHI : Pretty Heady Indeed willing sacrifice total normal way life people refuse get vaccine?

That's noble. someone goes college ohio list needs longer. Yikes. importantly, made Jagged Little Pill musical? Man would pay good money see that. Agreed, stupidity rewarded. drives nuts many people Reddit hate people enjoying life things don’t like lol   deadly lab created Wuhan stated former CDC director Robert Redfield. knows many thousands generations virus went let loose? Nevertheless, targets exact groups typical seasonal flu targets, say sick elderly. There's half million deaths, many fabricated cause, linked covid-19. population 300 million. 
But keep panicking like shitlib busybody are. Oh, didn’t realize that.

Still, it’s sleazy tabloid image. Let’s use tar good journalists. vaccination education? Sounds like really prosperous idea.. visit northern New England, I've known several completely unrelated people last name lmao. I’m almost 3 weeks post second shot sitting fairly crowded upstate NY diner type this, feels weird Agreed. never know. guesses get tested. hold vaccinating first-world youth elderly people still dropping dead like flies planet, total vaccine shortage?

Seems pretty sick me. undergoing cancer treatment (I know kind cancer treatment) oncologist wait finished vaccinated. he's either get vaccine #1, fully vaccinated while. know much ADA accommodations. assume guy though husband's former supervisor helped approach HR get changes made workspace better accommodate limitations rheumatoid arthritis damage. know husband got offer asked former supervisor turned explained vaccine issue. Cheers! discount previous infections Man oh man. thought one!

I think became best internet friends. said. comprehension low. You’re welcome try materials provided. Good luck! “inviting,” actually mean inviting people site prefer it, mean mandating everyone come in? three months ago, FB hoaxer friends posting India well ivermectin hydroxychloroquine, US liberal government (of course) diabolically withholding population part conspiracy, guess? course it’s crickets funeral pyres burn... people aggressively, purposefully stupid. Murdoch sky news...

It sold years ago.  Shhhhh. Let people enjoy things. many public universities vs private universities? Lmao comparing centralized record vaccine registrations North Korea, theres logical discussion you. wouldn’t. going ok. concerned herd immunity slowing development mutant variants US, fire raging equally worldwide? 

Makes sense.

Why stocking vaccines encouraging 0-21 year olds take vaccine shortage risk populations dropping dead like flies India.

Shouldn't every first world country vaccinate 30+ send rest doses overseas people dying? And/or sick time offered. people get paid use vacation hours take sick suck go work. math off. 1/14 nothing rate among two shots shots. entirely wrong. However, Biden's case, handling Covid much better Trump did. Why’s that? even trying make sort moral political statement. literally asking question many have. downvotes are.. strange. *something something MuH FrEeDoM something something* understanding policies contingent upon vaccines passing FDA approval process. Maybe colleges looks like policies trying get ahead expected FDA approval summer. Orlando, go errands/groceries it’s rare see someone inside without mask. Without exaggeration count one hand many people I’ve seen inside store without mask period many months lol. Long covid issue, long term effects vaccine? said, ""the second dose old age homes mixed given early.""

It given early. inaccurate. still sticking four months thus far. fact FBI issue warning means happening. you’re USA, vaccine available now. 

Get vaccinated. problem would impossible proved locale infection. immune systems example.

Why people keep saying this? get vaccinated, less effective. Like friend works specialty health clinic people compromised immune systems churning vaccines like crazy months getting everyone in. vaccination rate among immune compromised people very, high. Boy! sure showed me. right now, I'm 1/2 Pfizer vaxxed, 6 days #2 I'm still taking precaution. I'm thinking definitely lead ""tailored variant"" 3rd dose.  funny read articles saying ""they're vaccinating minorities!!!111!"" reality go black/hispanic neighborhood, they'll find want take it. several folks written multiple times Sputnik, although Russian government completely untrustworthy lying COVID cases deaths day one, lab created vaccine extremely well respected. despite general decline Russian institutions past decades, science, especially bio-science, effected remains world-class community. legitimately good product. Skimming looks like private aside Rutgers Denver.

I'm Virginia state AG declared state universities could require vaccine Fall, hopefully many public schools start following suit. wish got rid distancing masks vaccine negative test requirements. Yes, still Covid test negative, make people accept risk. time get back normal. Yep, I'm assuming lot follow full approval.  Every nation behaves way.

If we're criticized deaths highest case counts world, we're criticized holding onto vaccines, like countries would, vaccinate first. Somehow, we're also criticized countries vaccinating fucked logistics involved distributing currently have, and/or banking vaccines removed service study needed.

What's next, going criticized holding onto months grain stockpile case emergency people starving? We're nation world. Others help, especially since get criticized helping helping. Well, get vaccinated won’t anything worry about. 

Unless legitimate medical reason prevents getting vaccine, there’s reason don’t get one. know settings working vulnerable people (hospitals, nursing homes, group homes adults disabilities), employees refuse flu vaccine philosophical/religious reasons, required wear mask times throughout flu season (even pre-pandemic). wonder companies would go route covid - proof vaccination, stay masked. Thank list. kid's school know expect! worldwide data sites ourworldindata show daily testing capacity stuck ~1.5 million per day now. positivity rate tests also increasing day, probably testing cap indeed. COVID remains much deadlier disease unvaccinated flu. IFR’s Thanks. sis told get second shot yesterday dislocated knee... ouch. Sigh. What’s zoo? I’ll donate right now. Also, fair question, know people downvoting allowed criticize U.S., worry valid concern lot US citizens asking questions again. Foreign occupation rarely goes well, especially purpose destabilize foreign powers. solution either, obviously tough problem, still trying figure out.  **NYS update first dose shots**:

It’s late enforce quarantines everyone arriving country now, although I’d hope we’d adopt strategy future there’s another pandemic. 

We vaccines, know spreads, best way stop us use tools available. Banning flights best gives us delay incoming cases, need use time get many people fully vaccinated possible remaining cautious activities could spread virus.

Pretty sure CPS something say keeping kids school vaccines, too. 

Your sister terrible parent. don’t think Pfizer ever hit even risk hit European export bans. Pfizer exceeding far past anyone’s expectations. possibility variant completing evading antibodies generated vaccines short term issue. Sure, vaccinated people might still get sick likely hospitalized. might take several years might see variant evades vaccine response. Waiting come down. going suck lose people vaccinate. team folks extremely valuable, take years replace likely. they're really smart, they'll probably turn fake records - easy enough do. 

Personally, got second dose week ago, I'm going lie long possible start going office traveling again. Correct, dramatic impact health dissipate falls myriad illnesses took risk every day. 

The biggest threats posed COVID that:

1.) spread easily
2.) life threatening symptoms

These two factors completely overwhelmed healthcare infrastructure. infection rate goes minimal levels, it’s good enough go back normal. Vaccines mitigate two factors future, COVID bad flu. stay home, take care yourself, recover. 

As long vaccines prevent serious side effects hospitalization, it’s big deal get vast majority people.   one time double bump Pfizer opens age eligibility more. good % parents vaccinated get teens (12-15) line week 1 electing shoulder risk remaining unvaccinated ""prioritizing every else"" say? follow guidelines set forth CDC minimize contact folks. Yes. could like fan disagrees team spending 250M team spends 50M Yeah remember seeing videos managed vaccinate 10 million people polio 10 days example vaccinate large numbers people quickly.  I'm repeating article said, wrong article's fault mine. No. Students make choice get vaxxed. There's schools attend choose get vaccinated. might (or probably is) dumb question, seems like main argument variant skeptics worried mutations due increased opportunity infections. people infected, chances mutation. 

But people never mention animals... grand plan include vaccinating every animal earth lift restrictions? whole thing started first place? Society get split Thank seeing point view agree. I'm low-risk category take advised steps mitigate spread virus others that's somehow good enough.

This makes wicked uncomfortable lot reasons. unreasonable tell return I'm fully vaccinated? reported anonymously OSHA today, telling return open firing/discipline? \*really\* need work right I'm honestly lucky job right now. first dose today, enough saved cover return. advice post appreciated.. Masks help lot, people. even feasible Michigan get 70% vaccinated? 

Whether it’s feasible not, that’s take control virus without restrictions place. That’s based properties virus. can’t negotiate number think it’ll hard reach. Meaning what? majority eligible americans already received first dose, think would continuously increase rate vaccinations forever? common cold vastly contagious flu. First, HIPAA. Second, HIPAA nothing it. HIPAA applies healthcare providers disclosing PHI patient's wishes. prevent anyone asking it.

Third, US Supreme Court ruled early 1905 vaccinations made mandatory EEOC already ruled employers ask information (with typical caveats) take action comply... know else still repeating mistakes? media. number delivered state includes extra now, used administered delivered. also everywhere high precision needles get extra dose, perpetually lagging, number lag continue increase. Correct. worry much would cautious take wait see attitude.

Anecdotal evidence seems indicate strain especially troublesome. impacted younger people normal variant, seems evade vaccines used India, contagious deadly.

Are vaccinated? mRNA vaccines supposedly effective reduced rate Indian variant. exactly means determined.

I would wait see. Worrying never productive sure know that. sincerely hope new RNA vaccines open new chapter fighting tough protect deceases. don’t think magic pill like portray it. Flu extremely adaptable easily mutable virus. We’re lucky humans exposed since Stone Age except truly nasty variants (like Spanish flu swine flu), learned coexist together. 200 clots 41 deaths Obviously, going slow many people already vaccinated. 

Some parts country, even large parts country, reaching fairly high levels gotten least 1 dose.  

The SF Bay Area already around 70%, example. appointments/doses give out, 30% many people get them, course means less demand surplus. Sure, longer issue America. point believe real push skip 2nd shots. many wanted 2nd shots delayed due supply issues, resolved US still exist lot world. 

I mean people desperately want get vaccinated. anti-vaxxers never get vaccinated. hesitant people. really people want 1 shot decide care 2nd? 

That's I'm saying. I'm buying large percentage pro 1st shot anti 2nd shot. type articles keep getting published that's real problem. admit people died neighbors life goes on. personally sees disease like natural part life nothing afraid of. also ain't afraid death maybe me. Reports lot vaccinated people dying.

Source ""a lot"" vaccinated people dying? Yep. 1000x greater chance dying Covid complications vaccine.

I got shot, I’m taking better odds. platform that? I've worked developing something similar.  Carrot stick mean, even big caveat ""you can't two viruses time"", point original statement longer modified, wrong. Red Cross tests antibodies Covid infection Covid vaccine give blood them.  Haha six years ago sure lmao got pretty sick last November, got COVID test CVS, telehealth call doctor came back negative resulted nothing. could go doctor's office might tested flu, COVID happen. I'm still pretty convinced COVID test accurate, exhausted I've ever felt sense smell way off. I'm sure happened lot last year either way. would matter? would help prevent future waves like one currently going Ahh, understood. Yup, quite misleading. sensational headlines name journalism game everywhere else. actual article paints specific realistic picture. symptoms consider mild whom?

Lots people runny nose Healthy young people also die virus. Stop spreading bullshit. Hey also wacky father! believes virus really made vaccine. get shot made susceptible 5G tower waves eventually put zombified state unwillful subservience. 

He requested family members(including grandmother) take vaccine reason, bought it.

Idk do. someone situation? think change mind. Great, whatever want, right. lost ""hemisphere"" call anything initially, however OP claimed ""usa vaccine"" designate vaccine country, would Germany, American. Joe Rogan everyone's dumb uncle opinions things can't understand still feels need spout anyway.

He podcast Gwyneth Paltrow/Goop insecure men. Glad mostly ok now. :( mention whole part planet public hospitals profit. Man really nice consistent, continuous drop now. Wish deaths lower god it’s better 1000, 1500, etc. 15th wave anytime obviously.  Easier get flu shot stay home sick—that work school let you. Hope it’s acceptable call sick this, doubts. Quebec expecting everyone one shot June 24th, two. Show excess death numbers. everyone build good immune response vaccine. Older people, immunocompromised people, people blood cancers, etc.

That’s mean high risk people. Im going around someone transplant, I’m wearing mask even we’ve vaccinated. Right sums perfectly I'd say thing hate even first place instead everyone getting vaccine. went lot trouble here. dug study, literally reading appendix. Instead addressing points, say "" think really grasping straws here""?

Yeah, ok, I'll blunt here. cherry-picked absolute highest number exists flaws methodology. took previous study adjusted numbers one hospital using national case numbers, tiny sample sizes huge margins error. ignoring bunch studies show lower. 

The vaccines really good. extremely lucky them. doing. stay home. 

I live Manhattan feel totally comfortable living life fully vaccinated adult. going office every day (via increasingly-crowded Subways) going weekends. zip code, 66% total population (not adults) received least one vaccine dose, COVID positivity rate around 1%. Manhattan arguably safest borough right now. Spot HIV attacks immune system, flu covid might fighting territory. Don’t know. 
I kinda missed sick without sickly worried it, probably biased. Give back flu? Proceed what? That's pretty vague whom. adjusted island one person would mean 10 million Germany getting vaxxed! Great drop hospitalizations! far off. Entire country end April. That's entirely true. Phase 1 phase 2 years data full FDA approval typically, bet still monitoring time period. 

I enrolled Covid vaccine trial observation period 2 years. agree get Covid shot 2 years could monitor you. crossed over, however. time around, ONE ""accurate"" numbers... years ago, never got flu shot. young healthy also thinking much risk others community back then. got swine flu. don’t think truly understood bad flu (2009 maybe). boyfriend, college athlete super healthy guy even broke ribs coughing. livid friend got us sick. came visit even though ill everyone house confirmed swine flu. made really think GUY ass stays home sick. I’ve definitely gotten flu shot every year since. company (manufacturing) literally hundreds cases since start pandemic. One HR lady flew LA infected 24 people alone. shut production whole plant. They’re trouble finding people want work floor right now. company shite. People also used wearing masks symbol virtue.

I’min favor judging someone wears mask not. 

It’s blown way proportion. Let people want. good question.

If ever get coherent answer, please let know. Human influenza undergoes reassortment animal influenza, makes new serotypes. Random animal influenza viruses rarely jump directly human population. mix human influenza first. take human influenza take long time animal influenza replace 1918 flu backbone. Also, idea competitive exclusion 2 viruses compete. one virus already present, makes less likely infect host. would COVID competitive influenza, influenza infections less likely. sure happening, happen viruses.  California started fall, around time flu season started. contact tracing time, mentioned calls easy distinguish covid flu; starting soon, would testing flu covid. fall, perhaps stopped flu season over? said young, healthy person need it.

I know qualifies ""Joe Rogan walks back anti-vaccination comments"".

This guy like stupid person's idea smart person. several German states opened AZ everyone 18 btw, condition doctor telling risks detail India alone frightening! Like let’s honest least 1 billion people India much people actually dead scary Even mandatory rapid test everybody stepping plane would good step. (And investigate anybody tests positive possible fraud pre-flight test paperwork.) anybody plane tests positive rapid test, whole flight gets extra strict quarantine.

You absolutely forcibly quarantine somebody reason believe may carrying contagious disease. *is* illegal so. Additionally, unauthorized use official government agency's seal (such HHS Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC)) crime, may punishable Title 18 United States Code, Section 1017, applicable laws. that, I'm sure. people likely get vaxxed though IMO 1000%. 

Sure, next year’s killer flu variant won’t included year’s shot, it’s shown people get every year increased immunity va novel flu challenge people don’t. Dude walk back... Right cliff agree says he's respected source information.

It case, *is* respected source information significant number (mostly) young men. irresponsibly spreads misinformation, actually problematic. matter weeks US demand falls million day. Hopefully lot goes Canada said you’re eating healthy, working every day, etc. you? Congratulations… guess?! :)  one million shot happens, happens infrequently. daughter flu doesn’t mean everyone does, something uncommon doesn’t mean won’t happen someone know. hope kid makes quick recovery. like it. 70% number feel better heading back gym. see read thread yesterday, too. good enough half. think people really hold Spotify accountable letting spew nonsense.  One major hotel chains picked random get going. Holiday Inns would alright. So, advise 88 year old fully vaccinated Grandma proceed? realize India worldwide largest producer vaccines exporting everywhere put ban export keep vaccine production country? Also, way vaccinate 1,4 billion people India least 70% without impacting vaccinations elsewhere major scale.  tail gonna long fuck one right perfectly sums Yeah that’s “I’ll say want people listen say told I’m idiot one listen me” line uses every time there’s controversy idiot opinions. shitebag true! took alpha brain got smart could see micro toxins non-bulletproof coffee beans ate cordyceps mushroom drank mjolk smart like Jocko.  ate elk injected DMT TRT Sunday Graham Hancock true carvers Sphinx. virology friend says same. think may culture conditions virus MOI's saturating. animal, can't be. happens medicine time.

Wtf?

I listened entire Santino episode. Joe didn’t walk back, anything doubled original position. completely disagree headline. day heard ""COVID type flu"" work.

I guess use word 'flu' like might say caught 'bug' days, world live in.

It's type flu, docs reporting flu covid inflate numbers well death crosses path, oh virus understands economic/isolation stress reason reopen gets rough... Bali hardcore. lucky deportation punishment. Today’s raw reported metrics:

- Tests: 1,802,109 (+155,388)

- Cases: 55,464 (-7,123)

- Deaths: 816 (-64)

- Currently Hospitalized: 37,778 (-733)

- Currently ICU: 7,732 (-126)

(+/- compared day last week Tests/Cases/Deaths &amp; yesterday think exactly right. 8 second graders infected one class supposedly vent open wide, two fully vaccinated parents infected kids class. 

It's also interesting researchers test kids school show symptoms. Way covid would think.  sub allow opinion pieces now? wondering numbers bat state level looked weird. seems like rookie mistake. *If* insurance, clinic pharmacy *can* request reimbursement insurance cost administering vaccine. (Syringe, bandaid, alcohol swab, time pharmacist poking needle, etc.) vaccine free, cannot charge *you* copay fee, whether insurance not. Asking card facility trying minimize costs. run anyone confused it, explanation. important part patient pay, without coverage. Okay, already said someone else didnt know pulled shit time. dont follow work, general statement seemed like right thing pulls crap time ""humility"" null void.  correctly attempt explain support flu reduction conservative colleagues, specifically deaths due COVID vs Flu categorized? 

This seems like could used incorrect support opinion Flu cases counted COVID data.

I’m sure scientific support lower Flu deaths haven’t cared drill it. every respiratory influenced death retroactively tested way whether due COVID, Flu, another root cause?

Or generic statistical approach doesn’t go minute case case detail? Lots people didn’t even read first Since novel coronavirus began global spread, influenza cases reported World Health Organization dropped minuscule levels Fuck asshole 6 pack bicep veins could barely get bed days. thought going die little while. pretty mild case.

Everyone needs get vaccinated. Vaccine Hesitant great label, though bit general. Technically everyone could fit category. simply getting vaccine protect elderly people weak immune systems? Certain people prejudice source. though? said “Fauci disagreed me” like he’s right Fauci wrong. That’s fucking fantastic getting downvoted public messaging COVID-19 *not* made clear airborne. Maybe confused ""airborne"" means context person sarcastically replying to, usage, 15 meter transmission distances. CDC many, many official public health sources *still* recommend 6 foot/2 meter distance guidelines, which, figured yet, means operating assumption COVID-19 *not* airborne. instead droplet-transmitted. study posted OP makes clear mistaken assumption.

I think quite reasonable argue CDC public agencies setting guidelines combat *airborne* virus, expect (or sarcastically admonish) people understanding fact. Shit, follow science pretty closely even know study posted guy you.

My hunch? know either. confused ""airborne"" means conversation, compunctions making others feel like shit kind superiority play Reddit. stop bitching people downvoting belittling others every reason know, read quietly bit, learn something little humility. Pharmacies ask insurance info when. sign appointments basically saying ""no"" minority community good amount younger people.

Setup massive vaccine sites, like sports arenas, pay people $50 shot, see turn out.

And give people fucking incentive. ""hey stay masked always"" help. buy card stock. Yea saying agree suspect OP isn’t Rogan talking you, perpetual disappointment tow :[

Education isn’t everything. highly educated still dumbass. They’ve months, sadly.  father law jobs require vaccinations, seem issue guess outside US. foolish, past 2 months I’ve going gym mask, wiped everything use every time. 

Today I’m itching, sore throat, slight shortness breath. also went school today exam. Never socialized anyone though friends. I’m bit bloated, get dehydrated really quick. I’m also 17 years old. fatigue kinda always depression, it’s bad anymore it’s definitely sick type fatigue day day life fatigue.

This could sick something ate, exercise fatigue lifting lot. also don’t get much sleep. somewhat feel like got food poisoning tbh. Like there’s much “could” have. I’m really worrying I’ve realized I’ve huge dummy gym mask, it’s community one, it’s usually like 3 people I’m never close anyone wasn’t scared would get sick. know make mistake anymore  remotely fuzzy.  great. followers were/are anti vax, anti vax long listening Rogan. super-duper-mega flu I’ve heard lumped vaccine hesitant. Don’t know specific name not. Really split second stimulus payment made third payment conditional proof complete vaccination. travelers wander streets alone?

I've seen ton people SUB deny long-term health problems, deaths young people, deaths without preexisting conditions. makes angry. I'm sorry. like South Carolina then. That's interesting. heard people getting one dose. call types people? They're certainly antiVaccers. flu exponential growth winter. Saying exponential growth meaning. degree growth matters. see repeated Reddit much. disease history spread grown exponential rate, saying exponential 0 meaning say spreading. serious? That’s don’t shipments yet.  can't get without help. Electric Boogaloo Really? doubt remember read that? know. saying Canada US' #1 export partner, even moving timeline 4 weeks makes US millions millions dollars. uproar late due fact people actually giving shit opinions? Yup, people got first shot April still waiting June up.

US exports could shave ~4-6 weeks Canada's timelines. sometimes starves parts brain oxygen well, even asymptomatic people gotten permanent damage thing beyond foolish believe arguments made politicians take precautions getting infected.  Looking outside Brazilian, thought thing... No, stuff like (2 weeks ago)

See masks? Distance?  800,000 people one Obviously can't say conclusively proof, I'd suspect many countries like U.S. counting, rather intentionally lying. yes, there's difference. practically impossible get perfectly accurate collection data naturally cases going missed, possibly tests wrong, never got tested, human error somewhere along way. leads counting whereas saying lying suggests conspiracy intentionally withhold hide accurate information favor intentional inaccuracies. Maybe I'm naive, I'd like think that's less likely, knows. Watch video, saying kids dying too.

Edit: thought comment chain, watch YouTube video cases rising India. saying kids 5 g adults dying too. know whole day, honestly, going continue conversation, common sense vaccines work way, found study might find infected vaccinees broadly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 antibodies previously infected people received Pfizer vaccine were, average, 4.3 fold higher variants vaccinated without previous infection.

Previously infected patients also increase antibodies 10-fold vaccination, slightly higher vaccinated people naive virus.

None translates efficacy numbers, illustrative notion somehow vaccine lessens immunity flat wrong.

Hope get shot eventually. see holds. now, every available dose got gobbled quickly. story behind paywall, seems suggesting available doses one take them. probability work - vaccines people willing go get. trying say probability random day works given person, that's bound part problem, see rest numbers make sense. absolutely is. figure real possible side effect jumped here. love “shedding” idea, even though it’s true oral polio vaccine.

this go fabulously US, i'm sure.

not mandatory enforced quarantine arrivals india reckless irresponsible. Also, relative inability unwillingness government stop mass (and mean mass) gatherings.

This 2 weeks ago, 800,000+ people unmasked place, traveled country get together, heading back home last week, probably significant number infected, spread variants every corner first question be: go elementary school? need degree realize like flu. Knowing read enough.  Seems suspicious.  Also flu shot based aggregate data recent flu season. data means next batch shots may effective. Bill Burr showed opinions worthless subject. Excellent reason get vaccinated. Yeah, saw news 2 weeks ago, though ""oh man going bad"".

Plenty science supports longer periods shots, including UK used single dose strategy actually seen better suppression cases per capita compared US... Group insurance never factors smoking rates. Individual policies do. can’t imagine hope father country gets well soon enough. 

I hope encountering future post tells everything turned good. Ugh

But eventually caught muscle soreness worked way me. 

I think I'm getting blood work done tomorrow, case. 

I leg soreness past five days. I'm paranoid blood clotting. blood work tests done body's autoimmune response December. feel like could heightened risk. I'm probably nuts. I'll live advocate want body. 

Better vindicated dead lol


I really bad brain fog too. emotionally, terrible. made pain worse scared would permanent. made start questioning getting second dose May.

That's good point I've never seen made argument.

Paltrow never pretended part masses never popular influence. entire catalogue supposed appeal elite limiting actual influence. others mentioned, even flu shot prevent catching flu one year; proven evidence reduces hospital admissions large factor. i.e. catch it, less serious less likely land hospital.  thing I’d correct say “believe science.” 
Science isn’t something believed not. 
It constantly morphing based observations data. 
You studied vaccines made informed decision! 

I skeptical early (think summer 2020 perhaps?) vaccines rushed. 
I read rushed found none rushed points concerned me. 
So, vaccines became available jumped right it. 

The second day shot two good chance sucking, damn wasn’t fully worth it! get shot every year, every time nearby someone miserable flu symptoms, glad habit.

In terms per capita deaths, America even top 15th anymore (excluding microstates). EU nations dominate top 15. 

In terms economic impact, America's GDP retracted least like western power. 

Yes US hit hard, way country ever hardest hit. Pfizer vaccine's wiki page, there's table shows efficacy dose different time periods. There's also link source, 150 page EU  Hahaha wonder black market this. science pretty clear - limited supplies, one-dose across double population effective double-dose.

And enough doses coming May/June, 80% population second dose end June.

Just something random noticed. J&amp;J exploring two shot regimen. fully expect J&amp;J eventually become two dose vaccine. Total yes, exports. 45% eligible population left. around time Israel started seeing large declines demand. fact far outside norm occur countries too. 

It's mix vaccine supply ramping really fast peak demand met 2 weeks ago. First dose vaccine demand plummeted 50% since peak 2 weeks ago. Vaccines stockpiled tens millions right now. need exported ASAP. Thank pointing out!! wild flu serious lot population risk covid. Obviously completely different scale, flu season always terrifying immune suppressed person bad asthma. 

I get flu shot every year I'm immune suppressed helps lot around vaccinated too. I'm glad mask wearing least normalized now. hope weird wear mask pandemic over. kind prefer it. gotten sick year. Id think mRNA flu vaccine years away, right? think they'd eager EUA flu vaccine already one fully approved. 

Why tjink they'll cheaper? looks like flu shot already ~$40. 0.5-1.0x's cost mRNA vaccines covid. IIRC, mRNA covid vaccines right little margin. Could be- PR good PR? (DJT got long way adage). Mexico largest trading partner  anyone care fuck Joe Rogan say? Since name headline news worthy? one's job safe unless business.. got first flu shot earlier year.

I tried couple times since head cold moment let to. 

This year home couple nurses passed vaccinating whole street, got mine. good (finally). enough cover us. Arm soreness started within hour slowly increases day.

Now, I'm always smelling faint odor; I've seen others liken tinnitus nose. They’re leaving city bc it’s expensive can’t enjoy pandemic. It’s reasons suburbs around Boston expensive buy right now. average age going bc older ppl vaccinated think said beginning pandemic, virus highly contagious. I’ve seen lots cases family members friends, things spreads incredibly fast. don’t know anywhere that’s randomly giving four different shots. would complicated making trivalent quadrivalent vaccine. really care another statistic. family, anyone close matter? Thumb well guys Joe Rogan 2024! Stop listening Joe roegan. stopped entertained Ben Shapiro logical fallacies ironically kept describing wins arguments. long it’s EUA FDA, suspect would “iffy” try require it. Hospital work currently REQUIRE RECOMMEND it. That's literally said tho. said spread gets it. ""But go vulnerable"". Issue can't get vulnerable since takes time vulnerable young folks know body can't handle it. problem co-host challenge Lmao. knows many get sick afterwards. Easy control narrative PRC government allows independent inquiry/investigation. GDP ‘growth’ easy blatantly steal IP close market fair competition foreign companies. That’s PRC mo since Little Bottle. actually that, making what-if statements? Joe Rogan says that. Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine

not ever uses that. Smokers Hospitalized Less Often one thing, shitty though is, whip fake vaccine card get concert event.

Misleading people bad info trying pretend influence even though millions (or whatever) people listen show: still legal free speech, worse thing do, fooling anybody. increasing number folks fully support taking us back dark ages. word ""solidarity"" dirty word.

CDC like “just get flu shot... you’ll probably survive flu, you’ll probably survive Covid, may survive flu Covid time. don’t vaccine Covid, one flu... get it.”

And lot people otherwise ignore flu shot got it. Agreed, caveat finally get covid fully control U.S. better keep wearing masks public. Covid still making rounds enough kill several hundred Americans per day, let's make hard possible continue. think right heart breaks them. hope virus passes find degree peace healing horrible experience. Montana would like word. anyone know pre-clinical animal (monkey/mouse) trials Pfizer took place? be. understand got here.

Oct'20 - Double Mutant variant identified. 

Jan'21 - Kumbh Mela, world's largest religious gathering 100s millions, preponed 2022 advice motherfucking astrologers. fuckers go back corners India Nepal. 

Jan thru April - various mid-term election rallies. Cases steadily rise positivity rates go control. Result? FUBAR watching unfold. 

Complacency triggered it. total health care infrastructure collapse making humanitarian catastrophe.

Now, take breath think, THINK. talking 2nd populated country planet. I.e 1.4B fucking people. Let sink in. Next weeks months worst entire Pandemic.US, Italy Brazil's situation pale comparison. 

My prayers towards hoping vaccines work towards current virulent variants new ones. Otherwise fucked globally. 2c. endless ""grouping?"" really think done intentionally keep society divided. idea entire generation ""threw aside apathy"" fake supposed collective feelings ""insert race/ethic group"" community issue. Shit, haven’t able smell since xmas. mean may even halfway?!

Edit: didn’t read whole post responding. Shit man, I’m sorry. he’s idiot. Fun fact: name Nimrod refers Biblical figure great hunter first used insult Looney Tunes short (by Bugs Elmer) Interesting. Bay Area California already 70% 16+ population 1 dose. Hoping see cases start plummeting soon like Israel give evidence good threshold. FALSE: manged get Flu once, FUCKING TWICE!
ALONG PNEUMONIA, COVID, BRONCHITIS!
WHAT LIFE?!?!?


And yes, wore mask religiously, social distanced. “On gripping hand”, flu known throughout Europe *the grippe*, French world convulsion/seizure, modern times. get herd immunity. Want job? Get vaccinated.

Boy certain people states even going howl happens! Yeah, responded called moron said people shouldn’t trust cuz he’s doctor... shit like lot. 

He acts like authority makes super stern statements, later, back tracks, acts like casual statement made. gaslighting unreal really, he's fairly reactionary often feels like he's bitter considered progressive anymore. Though ""better informed Rogan"" low bar guess technically clears it. earth possible healthcare workers US, like nurses, doctors, PAs, nursing home workers, mandated federal law get vaccines? Gotta stop licking doorknobs. Cool, quarantine all. Idgaf. never listened Rogan's podcasts -- I'm looking quotes reported. 

When folks thread reacting purely emotions thinking guy actually said, takes numbers logic hope reconsider knee-jerk response. may overly optimistic that. btw 1 5 chance get right one. make 4 5 different strains flu shoot ever year.  Love it! personally know man mid-30s got it. seemingly healthy. spent 60+ days ICU, ventilator, trach, nearly died. Luckily survived home now, PT use walker get around. COVID joke.  disagree. Shut take medicine. Go work die.  Anymore large scale stimulus destroy USD. Small state wide efforts way go. Well considering making national headlines looks like people care unfortunately. It’s fucking guy recording talking, I’m tired seeing headlines something controversial said, hell cares don’t listen him. Interesting. know people making big deal vaccine requirements. Certain countries always required vaccines. Certain school districts well (probably most). get controversy. started ok (ie around national average rate) fell cliff pretty quick. used rate PA pulled way ahead recently. Uninsured paid fund set federal government PA population quite old, 65+ really highly vaxxed places. reason wearing mask?

Wiping everything really make difference, never close anyone wasn’t scared would get sick. I

Aerosol spread friend. Get vaccinated wear mask then. Thats better: context!

I inkling wasnt Survivor. dont watch shows: hoping ur correction program thinking of. Okay, let go source it... hold on...

[Fear could find r heavily edited bits, read Rogan's account article. submission grabbed contestant ""avoid escalation"". Like pinning ur wife ground slap u! Legit!

I cant recall site full, unedited clip, trust me: Rogan lunges grab guy hold him. ""fight"" escalated level necessary submission hold. Call stupid? Im cops choke holding u ur skin color, too! 😳 yeah, see u think Im stupid. Fair enough.

Edit: calling someone young (a ""kid"") become insult? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 very... weak. wish insulted! 🤣🤣🤣 Exactly. fun games blew times something 'random' occurances, things sometimes planned though. Humans done shit things society future too. 
The worst thing one prevent conspiracies manipulation. Thank you. hope so, too. Fuck Joe Rogan. sympathize. It’s ridiculous. info happening people vaccinate regardless got infected? prepared next 24-48 hours uncomfortable.

For lot upper back, shoulder hip stiffness I've heard worse.  Ditto. year without much runny nose. Simple. hospitals get paid/reimbursed $1,000’s flu? No. Corona virus? Yes.

Saying someone Corona virus really flu order make money appealing believe! many people care random guy Texas says podcast. say wants someone gonna hear say “oh don’t need vaccine joe rogan said don’t need one” fucking moron begin with. Jesus it’s like blaming video games music people dumb things. Every state at-will state. AstraZeneca vaccine scare me. sort thing (and worse) much common virus. bone pain really makes sound like COVID. Cases hospitalizations still rising reason. I’m hopeful; King County’s numbers seem leveled off. got friend saying that.... Lol. Yes. thank raising awareness positives article

it's something need right Oh really?! Well fucking found me! trash. man help kill Americans statement.

Well fucking done. J&amp;J efficacy keeps improving. day 56 equal Pfizer. day 28 quite effective. sure one dose others maintain efficacy. odd day 14 dose 1 2 seem least effective. Yet listen anyway. know quite number older people died flu. Even small country still \~220 deaths every year it. Although we're 0. makes wonder companies make cold medicine such, wonder sales going. Everytime go store see lots marked cold flu medications, selling enough meds expire. submission linking news-medical.net automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Canada needs vaccines tbh lot arriving already think needed. Canada get many doses next 5 weeks total date. things shift really fast. Even current pace Canada 1st doses US end May. take throne? Turns 5% hospitalized Covid patients developed hypothyroidism.

I wonder might common cause tiredness, brain fog, etc. lot people Long Covid report. Imagine fucking ignorant understand mRNA works think edits genes. 

Moron. Well UK even better, can't even meet people inside yet, land country without three Corona tests mandated quaratine  workplace safety measures... Employers mandate vaccination employees may object certain exemptions. states employment (almost states), employer fire employee reasons w/ exceptions vaccination part it.

If chose follow workplace safety rules, free find another job.  dare bring logic reason person. Clearly care.  Joe get respectful healthy 21 year olds going war fellow Americans. Thank service etc.

But comes getting vaccinated protect fellow Americans, miniscule risk comparison arguably useful, promotes selfishness bro science.  understand point, although agree people watching CNN segment ones actually convinced original statements ? Like it’s achieving anything. others also frustrated way treated like babies? appreciate Maher's low tolerance religious bullshit though, regardless religion discussed. He's afraid go them. least he's religious conservative.    breakdown. spike protein cell communication portion. entry key cell. inside virus hijacks cell produce virus copies. It’s actual viral DNA produced hijacked cells could randomly inserted DNA. 27F here! family fully vaccinated well! Met teenager pretty much situation, debilitating disease needs eradicated. Could actual medical professional midst pandemic? early on, bro science Dr ratio basically infinity. think I'll keep mask public transportation even vaccinated (and obviously required too).

I got flue also get colds, stomach problems. makes sense now.  Joe live LA? live them, maybe bright side least they'll leave alone \~2 weeks think cooties. downside they're apparently gullible fools. Assuming US - \~143MM people US gotten vaccine, caused covid, \~56% population would've probably gotten covid now. We're almost half, even started kids, still going, we're majority go full Legend, really want cool mutants? E.g., extra hand really increased typing speed.

For deaths, think latest [""Fifteen women diagnosed condition; three died seven 3/143MM. took chances comparison 570K dead (ballparking here) 100M covid cases. case, 3 hands applaud getting vaccine anyway.  one listening making life decisions are, idiots. obviously exaggerating upvotes. Shame Yep, Fox ""News"" defense. Good job America :) happy Mexico! think virus hit hard right?

I got appointment first shot may (Pfizer shot) I’m happy it, can’t desribe it! Let’s fight fucking virus! Remember healthcare system collapsed, even small accident kill.  God bless India. sad terrifying. could next, though, since flights continually coming in. quarantine process sort. It’s large reach despite fact he’s never strayed position ‘I’m meat head comedian talking shit one misconstrue random cuff opinions anything that’ powers terrified someone even potential reach/influence many people.  remember reading, ADE issue antibody levels drop later point (months years later) someone gets infected different serotype.

With SARS-CoV-2 things evolve, may get kind ADE know likely while. Also, mutations/variants pile higher chance time goes sheer numbers game. op, effectiveness vaccines decreases rampant like India. constantly exposed virus, means unlikely chance breaking gets even higher. remember correctly, tested one interval. AZ found longer interval 3 months actually better. case childhood vaccinations too. gives body chance learn “revision”. reason short gap trials get vaccine faster. numbers guestimates likely get infected eating outdoors restaurant fully vaccinated? genuinely conceded point, would simply say ""I wrong, young healthy people need get vaccinated"". None ""I still believe"" ""That's different conversation"". He's trying make sound like original point still valid completely wrong.  I'm disabled agency hires caregivers offered $50 bonus employee got fully vaccinated. incentivized needle phobic cargiver get vaccinated. people average levels intelligence.  hope potential booster shots side effects like mine. bloody useless day JJ Jab; everything fatigued sore could barely lay bed like four afternoon. FDA authorized vaccines EUAs. approved them. Formal approval usually takes 2-3 years. case talking (Jacobson) deals state-law mandated vaccinations, employer mandates. settled law. means 20 people  within country fully vaccinated, one could get sick Covid-19 should transmission occur.

&amp;#x200B;

Just no. plain wrong, scientifically illiterate ""Senior Health Correspondent."" said means 20 people within country fully vaccinated *who would gone develop serious illness Covid-19, transmission occur, one so: still want avoid one.* Well reminded anyone brain see. He's podcast conversations doctor.

Google says college dropout Billy Gates powerful doctor world see anyone losing shit nonsense. could also get flu shot wash hands.  Absolutely don’t throw party yet. 

But India 10% it’s population vaccinated don’t think blamed way vaccines working. new variant cause concern though. never know vaccines. Remember controversy around military anthrax vaccinations? cousin army get it. felt fine three days then, *BAM*, struck lightning. Must microchips. Holy shit. Someone different opinion you. gives af.    got permanently banned tooafraidtoask saying this. oh well want, force others same. wearing mask public mandates lifted. ""It's prank bro!"" doubled deliveries EU that's possible due increased production there. Canada I'm sure also Europe. Possibly Pfizer move forward delivery dates start exporting USA. know production capacity though, think smaller Europe. explained article, there's 3 things:

* [Fill&amp;finish J&amp;J vaccine EU instead [Removing raw material bottleneck [Securing AZ Halix production discussion beginning CEO AstraZeneca, understood, told me, ramp Halix financed British government,” Mr Breton said.   happens went visit site asked much they’re received British government, chairman CEO told ‘zero’. fact, asked three times question got three times answer.” stay home. doctor's appointment in-between 1st 2nd shot nurse doctor said something along lines ""oh, see already gotten started that, need worry it"" Good. afraid virus deadly people tested even know it, going outside first place.  around first I'm sure, eventually probably wonder worth cost phased schools. ""Don't believe me, here's believing.""  Stunning, take rates well really good, hopefully stay 80%+ acceptance rate 30+ well hate Joe Fucking Rogan, comedian, entertainer podcast host make {possibly} erroneous statement, makes evening news ABC CNN.

It’s like it’s president who’s making false claim. It’s thing, even game.

Why feel need push back 15 minutes segment comprising medical experts vaccines gurus?

Is think public large cannot make mind based facts known truths ? hate it’s like treating everyone like babies.

If Joe Rogan says sky yellow, need experts proven otherwise? hand grabbing?  course still get it. It’s called breakthrough infections. Although rare, people vaccine died virus. certainly transmit it! Report J&amp;J vaccine experience: COVID early January, still antibodies spike protein early March. decided get vaccinated yesterday, hay fever peak waning, figured I'm going feel bad, might well recover hay fever covid shot time. pharmacy Pfizer J&amp;J available. picked J&amp;J. 

The shot much smaller thought, 0.5 ml higher gauge (smaller) needle. pain injection, pain injection deltoid. mention give weekly IM shots thigh, IM rarely hurts anymore. 

Shot 4pm, woke 1am moderate chills mild headache, extreme thirst. took Tylenol seems helping chills. first recommendation big container water next bed get shot. hurt put Tylenol next bed pets kids could eat it. ???? wrong you? anecdotes indicative scientific findings Also let's start casting doubt actual origins fire. Could come neighbor kids playing firecrackers driveway evening before. possibly China left stove night could it? want give body enough time form memory B cells booster job activates second shot. Waiting longer time allows happen. Fuck JR he's self righteous prick Rohan hack POS. guy thought moon landings faked. He’s last person anyone listen life decisions. since March 2020. Terrible person  really reaching try paint brush as, say, denying someone job race religion. 

Things like religion, example, boil personal opinion. ""I think Islam way go"", ""nope Christianity got right sure"", etc. would poor road go indeed allow people deny employment stuff like (even though happens anyway, BS reason given). 

This one things. There's literally correct choice incorrect choice, based absolute scientific consensus. much closer to, say, decision smoker. flat incorrect smoke - know this. illegal, one forcing throw pack away. allowed areas affects people, face consequences incorrect choice increased insurance premiums. constitutional right dumbass make bad choice goes science. everyone else equally right tell go ahead f then.   Something remember well whilst diseases time appear become less deadly, that's 1) ones killed hosts 2) happens *a lot hosts died* many generations. short term, mutations random. yeah news reporters scientists. None things proven, least evidence seems suggest opposite, particularly regarding vaccines. I'll say this, scenario variant comes completely wipes protective effect vaccines compelling science fiction, much else. Maybe Italian citizens India? don’t think ban flights Italian citizens. friends sister British born Indian parents get back UK via repatriation flight, commercial flight.  new informations Moderna vaccine? wonder symptomatic/severe 4 variant breakthrough cases are. course ideal vaccines cut transmission full stop, least keep breakthrough cases mild still positive outcome. Thank you. Hope get past soon  Man, sounds terrible. hope family safe. Thank answering questions, hope visit country better times. Know people cruise industry. Apparently going allow 5% non-vaccinated people aboard well. Hey guys, know right thread ask like try it. I'll getting first shot moderna next week everyone around got Biontech/Pfizer vaccine. understand mrna-vaccines would nice see data Moderna one. around 700000 people Germany got Moderna vaccine till April, database vaccine comparatively low can't finde new numbers. anyone paper/study recommendations? get hit bus probably died covid. major pharmacy chains like Walgreens, Rite Aide, CVS vaccines. Check sites. That's took mom. Took little get appointment. sat hour refreshing pages early morning hours something new made available. right vaccines became available pharmacies, too. imagine would take much effort right now. mention lawsuits people infected. saw comment Reddit someone literally said ""why change routine protect you"". Like they've got point that's valid argument, know enough change mind. Cant still get spread vaccinated? 

According CDC, vaccines may also reduce Early data show vaccines may help keep people spreading COVID-19, learning people get aware... FDA approved 3 vaccines 200 million shots already given.
The Supreme Court already decide vaccination case 1905. Good questions. Oh thought one provaxx members. Spain, 6% say they'll never COVID vaccine. Take step back second. India benefits country demographically coronavirus. relatively young healthy. weaknesses, large multigenerational families too. 

But all, has, hugely dense cities, fuck tons people them. I've expecting countries like india crippled coronavirus since day 1. fathom seeing numbers far beyond usa, country many times less populous. ripe spread.

Then, realized taking seriously. stopped. much larger second wave first every country did, ripped them. numbers scenes worse new york onset excepting one thing. disorganized, attrocious infrastructure, people dying, due poor understanding care best practices, due wholly avoidable lack supplies. Countries like Portugal, Germany Spain problem reaching 90 adults vaccinated

I doubt Germany reach 90%. many anti-vaxx simply care enough. I’m glad moron actually got type entire essay lol

Joe Rogan stupid you’re bigger fucking idiot lmao  That’s lot solid conclusions limited evidence  Speaking raw numbers 21% 40 millions even half 26% 80 millions. besides predict sudden halt around 35-40% Poland, many antivaxxers I'm losing hope. covid vaccine invented Biontech Pfizer though   remember reading, ADE issue antibody levels drop later point (months years later) someone gets infected different serotype.

Correct. know serotype means gave trying understand paper point. many technical words - overload.

Bause recalled problem accurately sound like know second paragraph becomes worry. guess pharma companies going run Corona research work anytime soon. Really? get CDC card? need reunite yankee friends

interesting change language massive hate seeing canada earlier.
 
:0 We've already seen mutations make deadlier infectious. irrational thinking. Everybody deserves vaccine doubt it. I'm waiting one well country. believe Biden said AZ would sent India. real. 

I enjoy podcast I’m pretty sure it’s common sense ignore politics medical advice. Yes. 10.1M Janssen 1.4M CureVac end June. met one - slightly crazy German woman 60s. used attend meetup group one started saying friend posted things Facebook read 5G causing cancer (this pre-Covid). 

Of course, Covid appeared vaccine quickly flipped 'the vaccine conspiracy'. Classy.👔🍷🤵 healthy buddy caught can’t taste anything 9 months fact still interesting guests on, Physicist Brian Green recent one.

Like life, avoid politics fine. I've seen claims 80-90% first dose pfizer, second adding marginal better.  claims low 60, still seems reasonable get 2 instead one two much less likelihood death hospitalization. it

The irony words order written sub... Rabies near 100% fatality rate left untreated, covid something like 0.03%. understand argument that's really fair comparison. JRE fine. 

Just you’re done doesn’t mean it’s over. I've heard talking points before:

""If sick stay home. Social distancing everybody necessary.""

""The death rate less 2%. Everyone reacting.""

""Only elderly really ill die. die anyway, try stop virus?""

""If time go, time go.""

It's absurd. Anti-intellectual Dark Web You’re spewing BS fox news talking points now. Vaccines would definitely help, reducing number susceptible people 50+ population likely need hospital care. Yes, take weeks vaccines effect, crisis going end soon either.  think everyone agrees india needs help badly quickly.
 
mexico definitely needs help well, since lot worst people went covid vacation likely helped spread it. That's best part this
- someone like Joe Rogan stands goes meh need get vaccine
- listener / watcher / audience get vaccine
- someone like Joe Rogan gotten vaccine getting vaccine

People getting vaccine. someone famous someone know says aren't, are. antivaxxer given platform result new way edge lord. 

'yeah take facts face value. research' great research inherently flawed years training area. take car garage argue mechanic problem is. car-ologist. pay man fix car. Ah ! knew getting fat lockdown worth .. :( This'll one topics docuseries later: Pro athletes lost careers due Covid. yay! 
 
about time!
 
keep ramping production everywhere, many people need this. dont know shit. listen experts  Question. Say catch covid, unable work like 2 weeks so. Like, even home, serious case. employer fire me, days unable work exceed leave balance? I'm thinking hourly salaried perspective. question ever since covid started, since wondered must issue lot people. companies fire sick pandemic? dont think ill test personally though. Already caught covid jobs, half vaccinated. No. vigilant stay virile bro! vaccine prevents COVID-19 using body breeding ground virus. virus can’t reproduce, won’t enough viral load spread effectively via whichever body fluid would normally reside in.

Can argued vaccine can’t “literally” prevent transmission, can’t stop methods transmission... mean is, can’t stop person sneezing another person, can’t force people wash hands wear mask.

I’ll say again, vaccine stop virus reproducing. Technically that’s stopping transmission, see simple wording might used confuse people. Isnt pretty great? believe vaccinated unvaccinated groups equal size, points 90% efficacy? Israel vaccinated group larger unvaccinated group iirc, efficacy seems totally fine then, no? Dont see worried data all. expect way things nowadays? Young people don’t watch trust news, get information 7 second snippets TikTok context credible sources, vocal minority taking hold western society telling everyone gender isn’t real, earth flat, cops terminators designed kill black people, pandemic isn’t real 1% survival rate somehow good thing.

Science critical thought missing collective consciousness, turning husks regurgitating endless information see online can’t possibly sift daily basis. People want guidance security, it’s unreasonable see people look influential figures. crazy times living in. Cool. get extra $$s per counted case. there's incentive lie. nobody cares next year. much love joe, comments topic seriously smart. King queen? thought Nepal got rid monarchy Communists took over?  hat americas pants.

Is Canada brains Mexico cajones? odds would low still take risk, go outside home - ever. Turn thinking risk management.  strains virus killing younger younger people

Show data. Maybe vaccines older folks working, new deaths younger people, disease worse? Philippines, population 110M, 1.4% got first dose 0.2% fully vaccinated April 27.

Hospitals capital, Manila, nearby provinces still full capacity.   🤯 need brush history Joe Rogan walk back. People need boycott advertisers show get moronic asshat air. act new entertainment nothing renovation country's population search mythical Make India Great Again- going back conquerers.

Probably dating back Maurya Empire? think look occasional measles outbreaks now. Great job OP Inb4 ""HIPPA!!!!!!!"" 

FYI idiots. doctor access medical history records. sort need able to, know, treat you. already got 1st shot helped one cousins apply earlier ago next day (today) LA. carbonhealth, many slots available entire community also maybe forced stay house arrest, prohibited seeing faces people, made job illegal. Fuck tyrants charge. course got burried... EU number reliable 2-3 days fact different countries numbers updated time, 2.59M might 6-7 EU countries. Well theory better variants antibodies formed whole virus instead spike protein only. Let people spew whatever want, Jesus. worryingly authoritarian here. upvote. done protect unvaccinated. point move forward, reward ourselves. choose risk forgoing vaccine protections, it.  Colleges businesses requiring vaccination, proof able travel Europe bring us high vax rates need time. background statistics?   female age 7 today, unknowingly infected COVID-19 two months ago, give birth deformed sick baby 13 years today, mother asymptomatic COVID-19 infection 13 years earlier

The answer no. parts viruses DNA affect us way. Also sure comparable HIV, covid dies quickly, HIV stays you. Spotify CEO BACKED up, despite Spotify saying don’t misinfo streams.  LONG ONE. read somewhere beginning pandemic starting 2017, US government’s cuts CDC funding made research flu vaccine less accurate years row. lot coworkers get sick work lot, knew LOT people either flu incredibly bad cold fall/late 2019, well previous season 2018/2019. Makes sense, India needs everything muster right now. are, comment misleading bullshit. Spike proteins can't shit (apart giving immunity). That's averages work. print fake card want lmao fake spike proteins vaccine able change gene expression like actual spike proteins right

They fake. spike proteins changing expression though, let rest virus get inside cells (the virus whole change anything replicate). useless perfect vaccine target. Stating facts without sources subreddit rules. source shows ifr 30 going up? mean say want Pfizer, make best drugs medicines! Cant say Brazil, India dozens generic pharma companies FDA EMA approved production facilities. sure could produce them. might perfect solution surely can't hurt. sorta doesn’t matter CDC anti-vaccine disinformation allowed spread far wide via internet, it? thought can't export fulfill contracted number doses US ordered? Which, far knew, complete yet.

The US government probably agreed. contract fulfilled parties agreement Ya know, it’s refreshing hear JRE fans basically turning Joe issue. Opinion != Fact

People forget that. Kids young adults ones spread everywhere, period. vulnerable people tried run hide safety. young spreaders made sure many successful. ""We"" grounded science, huh? certain percentage people ""only getting one vaccine"" actually received both. husband got vaccine mass vaccination site due poor organization second appointment booked like supposed to. eventually able get it, logged first vaccine received email booster. bet lot people mass vaccination sites similar experiences. Jeez still digging. Let walk it

1) said Charles Michel spreading lies U.K. “outright ban”, put quote in...quote marks
2) said “He didn’t”
3) posted news letter written Charles Michel pointed section said words put quote marks since proven wrong. longer quote “random“ newsletter written Charles Michel “The United Kingdom United States imposed outright ban export vaccines vaccine components produced territory.”
4) started digging massive hole


Hope helps  great, terrible.

What? Vaccines made prevent infection, make sure even covid mild symptoms, they're made reduce hospitalizations. cause concern?

#explainitlikeiamanotsosmart8yearoldkid I’m immunocompromised wearing masks years anyway. I’m hoping precautions like commonplace!  Nobody’s saying can’t go outside, wear mask want go anywhere. mask really hard you? Seriously? toddler sensory processing disorder manage it, really think number grown ass adults can’t lot lower number won’t, sympathy bruised ego. Freedom speech still exists tho...for now.  Happy cake day though! agree. feel like Canada actually pretty lucky vaccines considering domestic manufacturing capacity. I'm inpatient friends family get access also need get world vaccinated won’t happy admits air dumbass doesn’t know talking about. made stem cells fetal tissue among things course. Looking comments it’s clear lot people reddit care way much opinions lol   Well lets see Tony fauci head NIH, NIH funds gain function research wuhan virology lab studies bat corona viruses, outbreak bat corona virus started wuhan (the bats virus allegedly came many hundred miles wuhan) guy directing institute funded research couldve leaked virus said ohhhh nooo couldn’t lab know REALLY care people? Anthony Fauci! guy admittedly lied entire country masks working, later say knew worked want people buy healthcare workers them. medical professional knowingly giving faulty advice, causing people fucking die CRIME. US incredibly high amount antivaxxers. US 30% fully vaccinated already slowing vaccination rate quickly. Two down, 251,999,998 go see mean, don’t think provincial government talked modifying four month regime elderly care homes everyone vaccinated (although sounds like might good idea). can't really comment live New Zealand Incorrect, stop cherry wanting nursing home patients get second dose quicker decreased efficacy,” said. “If knew 90 per cent effective among residents, probably worried second dose. lot lower, lot us asking get second dose quicker Jon Stewart defence. ""why listening me, come puppets make prank phone calls"" support denial employment people based personal beliefs. whoo boy that’s slippery slope actually last week, lot people testing positive airport coming India days. neither shoddy rushed, quoting things never said? simply parameter set accelerate test process. context pandemic absolutely great idea.

However mean parameter cannot changed science knowledge immunology. really simple that. really hard understand.

And UK been, like US Israel, absolute leaders comes vaccination. UK actually seen better reduction COVID transmission compared US single dose strategy similar per capita amount doses. yes, strategy viable, experts following reason. Again, hard understand. someone legitimate concerns safety new vaccine still care others. Wtf anybody care brain damaged “comedian” podcast thinks vaccines? someone says idiot shouldn’t take opinions fact someone listens knowing well knowing he’s podcast way professional medicine can’t handle opinion really shouldn’t listen podcast, mean fragile nevermind fact many people gotten vaccinated already dont need 1st shot, especially bay area. example, despite vaccine shortages san francisco county, 72% adult population already vaccinated least 1 dose Yup. Joe's mantra throughout been, ""It's thought was"" - implying, course, that, Spanish flu, ""not bad"". He's teetering brink COVID trutherism year now. Notice he's never Dr. Osterholm (who sounded alarm March 2020) back JRE. doubt that's accidental. Honestly, he's going continue he's hurts pockets, people canceling purchases sponsors citing reason. then, he's going care platform irresponsibly dangerous. Canadian hockey player hospital covid? even athletes safe It’s fine simple, easily pleased person. probably simple life. Enjoy dear. Lol. Don’t play games. don’t understand difference? conceded you. opinion wrong. It’s like decide believe God way life don’t believe agree with. case, actually conceded saying multitude reasons young person still get vaccinated. please go ahead continue painting antivaxxer meathead trying hard do. care little health safety people would working with, would employer find good quality? want team players prima donnas attitude.  mean, know kid underlying condition. Neither us knows is, I'm asking, worst case, happened. 

You're assuming parents guilty, I'm wondering might true. first time poor people rich could afford isolate stay indoors.

this time uppercastes see news. poor never counted times Fucking heartbreaking That's I'm asking mean ""natural"" R0 Dunno you’re getting downvoted. You’re wrong. Joe Rogan purposefully missing point.

Yes, younger people time die COVID-19 (allthough sometimes will), yes protection risk populations. know realizes trying get global pandemic. know knows complained shutdowns shit ton.

So want society open 100 percent future shutdowns occur, makes sense EVERYONE TAKE FREAKIN VACCINE!!!!

I get people willfully stupid. Biden taking away cigarettes! Conspiracy! He's friends Brendan Schaub, Eddie Bravo &amp; Alex Jones. chart percentage total population, eligible population. people generally wanting riled something instead applying minimal critical thinking.

A legit issue vaccine EUA approved like normal one rules may twist little differently. racist all. Simply stating reality. call mindset. It’s propaganda. Well, blame China. produce vaccine, Japan excuses late vaccination. Yep, young ppl chances get vaccine unto July far know. Thank you! I’m hoping goes well. :) people? agrarian society spend days outside city society made commuters, students, office workers etc. would significantly different R0s respiratory viruses. oral-fecal pathogens would differ lot more. standard people live? Gwyneth Paltrow bros. tell happened second shot. hours nothing later around 8pm felt little feverish. mild take anything next morning back normal.

It feels great get second shot though ngl. Hope goes well you. why? efficacy would substantially higher order (10%+ greater get signal within reasonable confidence interval). Obviously—not everyone vaccinated yet.

And no, mixing doses giving early first dose isn’t protecting enough. waiting four months always giving vaccine doses possible within four month period.

""The protocol give two doses of vaccine, Arruda said, ""if available Pfizer Moderna, think recommendation change saw stats average person gets flu every 10 years. Non flu getters freaks moderately lucky bad memories (or know.. survived) Degrom’s HOF speech brief. one thank lol

Oh yeah, masks. Wearing outside seems pointless since got vaccine don’t it. That’s tho Oilie friend states, handful exceptions, residency requirements. however, florida tried clamp middle rollout, probably wasnt good idea considering many undocumented cubans NC residency requirements. rich white people could come wanted. friend friend trying get daughter come DC get vaccine tiers opened daughter. Literally, defense FOX news hosts sued. Glenn Vilenueve episode shocked couple days. brilliant strategy. Wtf? ever open door?  Um viruses spread rate lol. Measles also respiratory virus, like 18x contagious influenza ~6x contagious Covid. **2nd place** Dodgers know parents’ fault? kid picked school? Cant still get spread vaccinated? Thought take care symptoms course much blame Joe, feel deeper issue here. fuck people still take advice celebrities shit know nothing about? stop thing? simple ""rich=successful=smart"" another symptom celebrity worship? exposing child criminally negligent?

Not cop lawyer can't say exactly charge be.

Ok walk anything back like said mindframe makes fun fact kids wear bike helmets softer surfaces playgrounds - ""We crap kid fine!"" Ya, kids fine, take lot children getting lifelong brain damage us decide maybe would worth things little bit safer.

Even putting aside societal good everyone getting vaccinated, individual level one argue vaccine riskier catching Covid. Hundreds million vaccinated - tens thousands got year ago. evidence there's much downside. think bronze age compliment UP, India flu mutation probably going stay low long time   smartest thing I've read today late that.

The moment west decided stamp virus like china eradicate it, instead wait vaccine, also distribute evenly throughout world, fate sealed virus would become endemic, yearly booster shots mutations first world mass deaths third world becoming norm. signs made get checked out? I’ve argued many morons point I’ve given trying.

“It’s none business get vaccinated not, it’s like affects you.” 

YES FUCKING PLUMB. US heard red cross test tell type antibodies catching it, separate type antibodies vaccines produce. like real answer. Brazil get sanctioned several countries international organizations. get last Pfizer shot morning, I'm nervous lie.. worrying catching covid makes nervous. Two weeks tomorrow I'll fully immunized! can’t extrapolate year. It’s going continue taper months pretty much nothing. listen episode segment? Joe literally agrees it’s reasonable assume young healthy person vaccine help transmit virus. Flu weird one multiple genes person gets two flus recombine genes new strains. mutation easy mode. Covid slower mutate flu faster diseases. Residency proof probably put place prevent vaccine tourism time vaccine supply constrained.

""The Los Angeles Times reported back study found 71 percent gas pump handles Kimberly-Clark researched tested considered ""'highly contaminated' kinds germs associated high risk illness."" Compare 41 percent ATM buttons 43 percent escalator rails.Mar 24, ""Pfizer, Moderna vaccines 90 percent effective preventing coronavirus infections U.S. study essential workers, CDC says"" (note includes asymptomatic infections, probably better data research trials reported 95% effective symptomatic infections) durability:

I realise I'm probably pushing open door this, read lot supportive comments man earlier get among people actually see is. believe armchair expert (Dax Shepard's podcast) good fix someone wanting hear specialists different fields Correct. That's ever intended be, like little card dentist gives appointment reminding next one stick refrigerator. Several tech companies working actual vaccine passport systems sell states states evaluating want proceed. CDC card gave got shot vaccine passport people need stop considering be. said young, healthy people don’t need it. Yes bad messaging, align story (the young people hospital unhealthy).    Joe rogan Goop men. good health.     Joe's comments (through influence blind followers) threat public health.  Yaaaass card back attendant germ 😭🤣 Yeah, black Hispanic friends wanna take it. even discussion last night, one friends said trust it. think seeing positive news USA well cases rapidly falling, figured worst behind us, need take vaccine. Really sad. doctor told get second dose reaction 🤷‍♀️ think facts science “narrative” [Joe  really lost started appealing alt right got deep anti leftist/science conspiracies… Scientists hesitant make claims good data supporting claim. may hear scientists ""unsure vaccine protects Indian variant"".

That *believing* vaccine provide protection. Rather, everything suggests vaccines still effective it, like effective known variants (B.1.117, B.1.351, P.1 etc). *proven* yet.

Tl;dr: media stirring fear things know little fear sells Probably minuscule difference. actual clinical trial Pfizer vaccine used 7 days second dose obtain reason CDC says 14 days second dose protocol used Moderna clinical trial want confuse people specifying two different intervals guidance, say ""you considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks second dose"" without specifying Pfizer Moderna.  Probably not, get ready bi-annual booster  Let's also forget US vaccination rate going weeks production steadily going up. Right? unbelievable free thinking demonized nowadays. said supported DATA yet apparently that’s good enough folks. don’t guesstimate outdoor infection risk always low. obviously consider outside packed like sardines. area spread apart reasonable distances Vaccination one field really thought India would deliver considering massive vaccine infrastructure has. incompetence administration ruined weapon fight covid. right since vaccines stop spread? What's point young healthy people rushing vaccines approved emergency use , young people clearly vulnerable demographic , they? . genuinely asking. see, right downvoting. 


We're point pandemic vast majority people want even hear potential bad news variants thing. Bit *lalala can't hear got vaccine everything going fine i'm checking that* attitude.

 sub great information last year time digging see whats what. late now, many deaths. 100 colleges across United States said require students receive coronavirus vaccines order attend in-person classes fall, according New York Times survey. group pointed many students employees high risk severe illness complications coronavirus, said college reopenings fall associated spread surrounding communities. University Wyoming offering vaccinated students staff members chance participate weekly drawing prizes tickets football basketball games Apple products. Feels like witness real catastrophe.

We already are.  Joe Rogan entertainment scientist #whysoserious Please re-instate comment. really optional people put immense pressure take make feel guilty taking it. agree vaccine good thing taking sub shamed notion hesitancy towards vaccine really fair.

We need explicit law executive order states forgery cards federal crime punishable 5 years jail $250000 fine.

The county vaccine centers never leftover doses end day late February/early March, think. don’t data verify it. 

While frustrating first, realized fact everyone wanted vaccine parents/grandparents showed lived area well-educated compassionate people. Aside symptoms, tests diagnosing blood clots vaccination? heard of:

- Platelet test

- PF4 antibody test

Are tests? labs commonly PF4 antibody test, require specialized lab? hope youre ready 4th wave then! 5th wave? whos keeping track lol agree you. aside, article (the issue) Class gossip. Creating controversy hell marketing tool. better way get people listen show? Nonetheless, hopefully pointing issues JR's opinions power surrounding people questioning even consider cutting back listening nonsense. risk/reward decision impact Covid impact vaccine. it’s easy decision someone young healthy get vaccine, means they’re uninformed. 

People whose minds blown person weighing options impact virus disproportionately kills obese elderly could gravely around harm versus putting fast-tracked vaccine body unknown long-term consequences absurd. 

It’s interesting watch scorn someone wanting make weighted decision health. think point they'll tell base whatever fuck, care us peasants dying. comes protecting they, too, trust experts enough know using privilege jump line best interest. due respect, dozens millions people do. great, terrible.

You realize thats 98 percent efficacy? Sorry explicitly acknowledged argument vaccine could help OTHERS getting virus, quite rightly said... rate people getting sick age 21 is... negligible. need lie that. 31 it.

I relatively mild case compared people, never get sick, completely kicked ass.

The fever dreams awful, constantly waking cold sweats, always thirsty despite drinking water constantly. Everything ached cough felt like lungs trying escape.

I'm pretty sure lasting effects breath given issues muscle pain before. couple stoner friends listened around 2010/11, we'd listen blunt cruises. generally funny, sometimes interesting, something I'd ever listen sober. genuinely surprised still ""blew up"". sure did, wanted please extremists Hinduva side.

Almost everybody know, especially age group little bit inconvenience all. openly discussing statistics somehow shamed. Let alone debating idea self sacrificing instead leaving horrible world next generation.  follow official narrative without question like good little boy?  Hopefully. vaccines eventually wear lose effectiveness could climb back again. I've heard lot people say get another one. 

Will severe past year? I'd surprised. around 3 times worse fairly bad flu year seem like crazy pessimistic view. 

Hopefully happen vaccines last long time vaccine uptake continues increase. bullshit excuse people give. Manson claimed thing cult murder bunch people.

Wearing mask much less work less disruptive life steps already take avoid touching public surfaces flu season. Trust me, balancing subway without touching poles much work wearing mask.  Could mandate incoming international flights terminate Florida? long incubation time also allows asymptomatic infection (from understanding). really bad.  question studied trials remains frustrating. since then, largest data sets (Israel UK) show vaccinated people drastically less likely spread virus. 90% less likely. Got 2nd shot yesterday part officially played out, get wait watch good enough % gets done go back normal. “Young people don’t need vaccine” Foaming mouth  BioNTech pfizer vaccine?? Either shared thing, ""pfizer vaccine"" headline useless.

To knowledge even pfizer vaccine singe distribute it? Correct wrong. dies everybody call pfizer cause USA? u call freedom-vaccine well.   memory like elephant's (its good) I've never contracted type illness knowledge. even cold.

However I'm taking chances COVID stuff though; part. Wear mask, keep distance etc. vaccine available age group live yet wait I'll getting it. Tell Phillipines France curfews. Philippines people shot wearing mask. stop spread - nope. curfews France stop spread? No. Australia different position US. US could limit travel way Australia getting lot transmission inside country. Plus high podcasts shooting shit friends I’ve seen comments sub others saying “well, sympathy gathering 100,000 deep religion.” read comments like wonder people cruel. 

I wish family nothing best hope father pull through. You’re do. Always remember that.  crazy things I've read since COVID hit, one incomprehensibly idiotic forced believe school owners trolling everyone they're bored and/or morally bankrupt. way grown adults stupid; goes beyond limits belief even Florida.  amount sickness directly correlates infectious are. vaccinated people get covid, mild, meaning significantly less infectious. definitely still spread it, way less likely get virus first place less severe, less infectious, lasts much shorter time.

Haha funny, make laugh long time. covid kill overnight? mechanism? People die sudden deaths time, continues pandemic. Inevitably people die deaths infected. running Texas avoid getting meaty Spotify deal spending years talking he's ok rich people bring taxed higher would never go back listening hypocrite again.

Oh I've destroyed. bad I'll still vote BJP Modi social distancing, working home.

But importantly flu virus around. Kinda hard catch if, nobody it. freaking out

Who freaking out? also find part *lala can't hear attitude*. Bringing ≠ freaking out.

I listening BBC Newshour podcast earlier week interviewing doctor India situation casual mentioned covid vaccinated still admitted hospital week. Obviously sample size one notable me. shouldn’t even story. unless working remotely, even business owner, customers might require vaccinated go site, too.   ""No evidence"". sentences useless He’s wrong already giving vaccines workers cross border, believe alaska vax tourists starting summer. Love see get shot. rubber insurance companies force companies this. workmans comp carrier advising require us ensure workforce vaccinated vaccines fully approved. don’t want liability.  health systems remain intense pressure — relaxation COVID-19 measures, sluggish vaccine rollout spread contagious virus variant — experts predict pandemic soon get worse. fun going welfare claim 😂    Yeah I'm one  Brazil raw materials infrastructure manufacture covid vaccines? mean Poland called doctor couple times last year always told ""ya, sound like covid. Stay quarantined. Byeee"". sore throat. gf. 

What I'm trying say throughout last year noone even tried diagnose anything else covid, even actual signals so. flu symptoms often similar covid think, mild cases, flu missed disregarded. good policy vaccinations babies getting Sputnik V shot, take it? concerns? actually insane lucky him. still managed blow though. last year office felt like watching flounder slowly dying off. convincing anyone except Q people believe anything. They’re takin jabs! Joe specifically called idiot multiple times podcast thread talking about. Nice snark though, friend.  thought same, I'd like know Joe got bought republicans changed Spotify moved studio. I’ve lost respect him. show used fun informative look alternative views opinions many unorthodox subjects. he’s spokesman GOP. Sellout asshole. Gonna get beer chips, put feet watch show. problem getting vaccinated. 

I hardly notice microchips days. (/s case)  580k could still improve lot Ma

It 100% Nah think understands Whose going tell them? 2023, wear mask gas station probably think robbing them. probably waited last possible second make decision like everything else done pandemic  believe LA fire department require vaccination, required documentation refusal vaccination site. Turns people there, they'd rather vaccinated announce want protect coworkers. yet - I'm afraid pandemic last another year reason vaccine manufacturers make new influenza shots year. 

We’re going live virus it’ll integrate regular vaccination season like flu. Flu shots mandatory. let people go refusing. Stay safe, vaccinate! Yes California one.   Somehow Cardi B better person Joe Rogan. also loves play card of, ""I never claimed expert. would anyone listen me?!""

He knows full well pull idiots. Yeah, I'm feeling great part referencing say “pulled bridges up”? 1st grader died covid. Another kid died vaxxed parents took hawaii vacation say, surprised people ignore wearing masks anyway don’t think much effect. we’re hearing US, it’s doesn’t sound like treatment options right now. keep monitoring can! Important keep mind entire human population kind antibodies flu. COVID hitting completely naive population antibodies whatsoever running rampant unchecked. Well constantly give alex Jones compliments ""correct"" lol cmon, everyone knows ""loan"" sense sent canada mexico get paid back ""eventually""  Yes! Sweden. felt like regular shot. Got 1pm started freeze evening escalated shaking. Got really bad headache take sleeping aid fall asleep. Appearantly majority department got fevers 1-2 days. Luckily feeling better next day. barely got symtoms tho few. Good luck!  Exactly. can't believe scroll this. 

He hold personal opinion *and* still concede Fauci's world right taking vaccine sake public protection. 

We saw death satire 2020. guess we're saying goodbye nuance 2021. know just, go china right? closed country. Man, fuck Joe Rogan. Pretty sure that's insurance fraud. going say same. Many common items worrying gas pump. Like door gas station, instance.

But honestly, one live fear things. bodies fight coexist microbes already. Sure, it’s creepy. it’s going kill you. 2.3 million, like less week vaccines. Hopefully but, far reports repaid. rate AZ approved U.S. anyway may likely need repaid U.S. use interesting workaround done Pfizer Moderna. lot people 18. think got almost adults vaccinated 99% rest family members 98%. yeah, possible normal level that.  Congratulations hope get need there!  Hi nurse here, sounds like you’re pulmonary edema/embolism. There’s chance permanent damage lungs. Best luck Everyone flight needed negative Covid test, may exposed earlier Maher went anti-Twitch anti-youth rant day. reminds he's old fuck he's Rush Limbaugh thing.

Rush said ""I never wanted grow fuddy-duddy like old people young. going stay hip, matter old got. realized, young people stuff stupid. parents wrong understanding me, kids today wrong understanding me.""

Paraphrasing course. Although, literally used ""fuddy-duddy"".

But Maher thing, better phrasing.  four million loan. I'm fully vaccinated probably go Dodgers game next season ticket prices drop back down. :( Stay! Stay! exactly do?

Nothing really changed contracts put charge, things work alrady place everything went shit happened charge. Yeah dude use common sense China stores it’s medical data, media outlets government agencies utilize information inform public nations whether China filtering information ...or chinas integrity whole, maybe factors go nations trustworthiness... mean pretty common sense stuff bucko.  pandemic get much worse thanks people getting vaccinated  based UPenn study, bigger question dogs actually recognize covid sickness.

The study used covid positive samples samples healthy people. samples people common cold example.

It really seems case dogs detect sickness kind knew already. Joe Rogan idiot. Plain simple. knows nothing infectious diseases work yet comments millions followers opinion it. 

I’m really sick everybody opinion everything today. know little quantum physics. I’ve watched read things, way entitle opinion anything quantum physics. 

People dedicate 20-30-40-50-60 years lives science, right opinion. rest us listen try learn. 

We’re talking taste here. it’s debate restaurant best cheeseburger, means, chime in. 

If we’re talking highly infectious diseases, unless you’re expert highly infectious diseases, shut listen. 

And no, odd doctor making YouTube posts opinions coronavirus opinion holds merit. family doctor, surgeon, he’ll even neurologist, business talking highly infectious diseases. 

That’s medical specialty field epidemiologist. It’s study work every day lives. 

And general consensus global medical community, especially epidemiologist community, vaccinations best option have. masks, social distancing, lockdowns best methods have. 

Joe Rogan, people like him, go visit Brazil India. tell people COVID bs. Joe Rogan fucking best fucking dipshit Since Gen X supposed apathic? people 40s 50s. Maybe add disclaimer either full shit currently writing novel that's based fictional story? Like, people actually believe you, understand that, you? right. shame got downvoted chinese bots UV radiation sun primary germicide environment. mean refuse shot wear mask flu season. Unless hospital weird. Yea lol

People denied employment ""personal beliefs"" time. called ""saying wrong thing interview"" lol. ""Personal beliefs"" sacred, protected thing make be.

Enjoy 10th grade bud Besides, fire gone April young people don’t get shot, virus continue mutate get worse, perhaps rendering old vaccines useless clue inferred comment lol. hesitancy wall im talking exactly that, point cant vaccinated anymore simply want it. l.a. county wall probably 80 85%

Joe Rogan idiot. Even worse that, he’s dangerous. true: Im astonished made $$$ podcasts acting comedy. Depending ur point view, success fail.

To say Im hateful... u paying attention r discussing actual things jock said? would opinion all. werent spouting ignorant nonsense podcast. Remember 180'ed comedy plagiarism? Wait, men Spotify payed Rogan $100 million exclusivity Podcast, talking Spotify subscriber revenue? doses loan paid back, give us. Great. we've stooped? treat everyone like little kid offer rewards getting vaccine. Fuck neil tyson podcast... unwatchable man, can't go 10 seconds without interrupting. much ego. compare think deaths US 100% reported?

Well look ""excess deaths US 2020"", 500k number matches reported COVID death pretty well. course could 20-40% mark, overall American numbers quite accurate.  I'm trying make clever point. I'm somewhat commentating disconnect believe many regard filthy world live really is. U.S. export ban vaccines ones sent Canada (AZ approved there) loan paid back. agreement Pfizer ship Canada Michigan plant but, Trump nixed Biden change it. far, announcement first time U.S. agreed ship Pfizer vaccines anywhere. no, Biden done much that's shame. kind like guy but, U.S. vaccine hoarder. Brazilian variant much fatal young people too. believe US. drove 80 miles dose 1, dose 2s date 6 weeks later minimal effect pretty much location around country. Joe Rogan right one thing, fucking “moron”. It’s first time he’s spread conspiracy theories, invites people show spread conspiracy theories... wouldn’t problem challenged it, doesn’t, nods like fucking moron says shit like “that’s interesting point”. listen various episodes podcast, flip flops back forth positions time. far right guest on, he’ll nod agree, liberal guest he’ll nod agree, scientist he’ll nod agree, science denier conspiracy theorist he’ll nod agree. reality doesn’t position, easily swayed way that, doesn’t intelligent throught process put time arriving research studies points view... makes dangerous, lot people listen him, presents considered, free thinking confident positions, he’s easily influenced anything anyone regardless evidence, lack of. 

Rohan’s excuse “I’m moron”, reminds lot Fox News taken court shit Tucker Carlson said, defense basically Carlson doesn’t speak actual facts uses exaggerations, reasonable person would take says facts. 

The problem lot people fucking uneducated, stupid easily brainwashed people like Carlson Rogan, “I’m moron” “I exaggerate don’t actually use facts” defense doesn’t cut huge responsibility based number people listen you. Oh Bill gates talks vaccine it’s fact? one celebrity right wrong. Bill gates buddy buddy Fauci everybody loves it. another rich guy talking idea about. people gonna hate Joe Rogan, don’t people go listen Bill Gates say Judging first comments read one actually listened full part podcast smfh. agree others sake get vaccinated that’s separate argument, everyone existing health complications vaccine young healthy people wouldn’t necessarily need it. headlines keep trying throw bus smfh. people seem think viral vector somehow similar inactivated live attenuated vaccines... really general concept mrna vaccines... virus wrapped dna instead liposome wrapped mRNA... 

I saw someone saying conspiracy talk efficacy Sputnik V ""which uses good old fashioned vaccine technology"" instead force people guinea pigs new mRNA vaccines. hard time processing ways wrong. never gave opinion it. Buts clear JP two...

You've shoehorned opinion JP nobody asked - almost read like kind echo chamber copypasta too. hand poster said, ""Well, background math modeling, virology."" stereotypically seems trend towards sci-fi reference translated flu terminology. :) June, wife (40) (38) two children (4,6) traveling Taiwan US live permanently. provide negative COVID test getting plane, vaccinated. wife discussing arrival US. 

My parents, fully vaccinated, allow us quarantine home (where separate bedrooms) live find place. quarantine standpoint, we're sure should:

1) Stay parents arrive -- we're sure risk infecting them. plane flight long, one transfer SFO -- risk getting infected traveling (with kids) non-zero. 

2) Rent house apartment stay in. would go directly arrive, stay inside quarantine. may may better, know place we'd moving into, stress take care children enclosed space non-zero.

Can stay parents? isolating moral thing do? plan getting vaccinated ASAP US. Oh he's definitely always ""faux woke"" best. pulled ass. ""Experts"" claimed anything 50-90% required. shot dark. sucks treat everyone like little children reward get vaccine. don’t think he’s failed anything, didn’t get paid quarter billion Spotify JRE. sound hateful Wow guys watch 5 min clip yt walking back saying resourceful says opinion says shouldn’t matter medical subjects. literally said im moron cage fighting commentator steroids drinks smokes lot. ""Why restrictions place vaccines arrived?""

Because never restrictions rigorously enough get covid control without vaccines. Compare Australia, handled covid well able reopen things last summer, covid death since last year. research

That clearly fucking false. sentiment correct, wrong reasons, shows perils comparions.

NZ's COVID response central, strong sub-national structure. cnetral government led Prime Minister dictated strong response, entire country protected.

Conversley, country, Australia, Federal Government's response COVID lacklustre. Instead, state leaders, irrespective political alliegence, tough COVID, imposing lockdowns essentially eliminating community transmission. forced Federal Government agree hotel quarrantine system prevent inbound travelers reintroducing community.

In Australia states lot power consitution, including ability shut state borders states health grounds. Federal Government hated much supported Federal Court case one states (Western Australia) force open borders. court case failed.

One suspects Australian Federal Government able exert authority (eg. like NZ), we'd outcome like UK.

So trying say? Country country comparisons fraught. There's alot context required explain country dealt COVID. Interesting. Mind share source? Doc here.

I would sent ed even hospital crisis situation delirium likely lung blood clot.

Minimum would done oxygen level, set bloods chest x-ray place totally overwhelmed.

But really needed CT lung clot more. concept entirely understandable. However, AZ explicitly said one thing November last year (that $3 cap would applied developing countries) something entirely different. ""Those TV ads useless. work me!""

God y'all dull well shit works. entire western planet built PR media manipulation thinking surfing propaganda wave getting wet.

You exactly target. Great work.  mean, Yes, people infected likely mutate. Also, immunocompromised people get it, also bumps mutation rate (cause evolution occurs within one single person since can't clear covid). another reason need everyone vaccinated, immunocompromised people get hyper mutate it.  dense irresponsible. fucking pissed. fucking Wendy Williams. experienced vaccine representation mild symptoms offer, want fucking part I'm glad missed  think episode days earlier Josh Rogin opened lot people eyes possibility lab leak heavily critical CCP 👀 30

#It NOTHING that's enough time passed show long vaccines stay effective, Offit said.

But Covid-19 vaccines, ""you that. one- two- three-year study ... virus killing hundreds thousands people. wanted get there.""
He stressed vaccines' EUA status mean they're less safe. member FDA vaccine advisory committee, Offit said vaccines reviewed level scrutiny would get full approval.
Offit said he's confident vaccines get full FDA Paul Offit director Vaccine Education Center Children's Hospital Philadelphia member FDA's Vaccines Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. reinforces things say head thought allowed say loud. love validation easy cop of, ""who would listen Joe Rogan anything blah blah blah.""

Um... you? listen Joe Rogan... That's good policy!

I've baby, get-togethers poker nights works house next weeks MUST fully vaccinated attend. I've made clear, expressed dismay vaccines gotten ""Hey, that's bummer. Let know get vaccinated hang again!"" me.  Oh Bill gates talks vaccine it’s fact?

Bill Gates, noted smart human, Joe Rogan, Comedian. yes EXACTLY SAME. people gonna hate Joe Rogan, don’t people go listen Bill Gates say

You're fucking dumb. cult bro. He's stupid guy. people believe plain stupid. Seriously guy tinfoil hat guy.  Like exactly remember listening Dr. Osterholm interview thinking, man Joe really got together. informing whole bunch people. started path anti mask strange type Covid denial. stop listening him. good way filter ignorant. need another lockdown well. Let's real here... going Joe Rogan political commentary medical advice really need reevaluate life.

This coming big JRE fan Right 70% people least one dose factor natural immunity you’ve drastically reduced risk spread negates need constant vigilance masking. Offering removal mitigation also persuade chunk people fence shot go get vaccine incentive return normal. don’t, you’re right. it’s possible will. That’s one things could change we’ve pandemic.  scam safety public health. gone foo He’s unfit talk anything isn’t MMA recreational drugs/roids stand up. topics he’s great.

Other that, might well listening anyone street. It’s laughable anyone would take medical scientific direction him. He’s completely unqualified providing platform people pushing factually incorrect scientifically false ideas/conspiracies.

I honestly think he’s caught echo chamber lost touch. things/issues entertaining start providing medical advice people, particularly young, easily influenced people, becomes dangerous. 

Covid isn’t political position conspiracy. may big affect you, may vulnerable people around you. still carry transmit virus others vaccinated, whole idea wearing mask - it’s people.

Part problem people don’t fucking care people anymore.  turning vaccines, help administering think. Bill knows best moment think fictional anxiety 100k dead recorded. That's 100k + families grieving dead UK alone. sorts anxiety rear ugly heads - survivor guilt one. idea mono-type replies imply you. toddle on.  dare people put non-existent freedoms public health\* (just little typo fixed ya) covid previously.

You welded building. think something premise. type person enjoy virus per se, enjoy circumstances virus created. disturbing number people want live lockdown lifestyle forever. Yeah go say ""muh freedoms"" Venezuela thing AZ real control SII vaccines. fact, AZ cannot import vaccines India claim theirs. 

This different vaccines made Europe AZ responsible whole logistic chain subcontractors. So, no, data. study trying create way assessing covid anxiety.

None questions relate actual anxiety long term changes behaviour. Nice one. AL first lockdown basically said follow rules football.

Too bad stick year. What? :) tourist friendly muslim country.

Mrna vaccines hard manufacture make sure ones waiting 2nd shot get it. district fancy masked prom football field difficult home countries would poor vaccination program vaccinate 18+

Especially look third world countries like Germany   Same. kids in-person entire year illnesses school. positive cases, nothing serious. hospitalizations among students, importantly, among staff. kids pretty normal school year outside mask wearing prom cancellation. bit circular argument.

If read notes data immediately see pivot table way created give useful result. somehow thought does. Canada alright vaccines now, really. see [forecasted here, Pfizer scheduled shipping 2 million week Canada out. also vaccine doses coming companies (AstraZeneca, Moderna, J&amp;J), add close enough give 10% population vaccine dose every week. rate, everybody eligible Canada opportunity get least first dose end June.

What logic behind though? fool could predicted this. Yeah, pharmacy probably care - assume bill government insurance companies (though maybe not). group wants push fill insurance info actually government - well theory taxpayers want people fill out. 

It way COVID tests state city run places. Joe rogan big meathead idiot say anything podcast guests feel like friends. Well that's weird distinction make considering none vaccines really made AZ.  update: You'all 470 cases yesterday 7-day average 353.  average number deaths last 7-days 9. 

Better Virginia live. We're clocking 14 deaths per day. Maybe higher population number something this?

Correct Indian world let strain spread. Young people history health problems dying.  Facepalm Congrats exception rule.  set goal 55% population then. easier hit especially add 12-15 total next weeks. Whatever works, I'm it. vague sense mentality lot Americans become ""Pretty much everyone else getting vaccinated already vaccinated, would bother? pandemic good over.""

So right I'm feeling simmering rage group member far done work one else would. I'm looking group members who've done nothing, they're looking back like, ""What? work mostly done, would anything, idiot?"" Yeah new Pfizer deal winter, understand correctly. One could argue vaccine. I’ve already got two shots I’m chilling. saying Look travel history then. India last 2 months allowed in/deported. know percentage population vaccinated?  Old people getting vaccinated younger people larger % hospitalizations deaths. Shocking results! People strange strange state denial. It’s weird. think pandemic negative effect mental health sadly. People don’t want hear schools open seem doable (my mom person teaching since September) outbreaks student student transmission tied sports extracurriculars like school plays programs like votech.  got HS shut last week 9 confirmed cases one school 8 tied school play.  People pretty reluctant comply contact tracers testing could US opened schools masks distancing canceling sports extra curricular activities (which people would flip send death threats principals) school outbreaks would rare.  kids continue zoom virtual lessons stop spread virus estimates peg around 10x give statement context headlines triggered outrage Twitter. saying right wrong things. Maybe, mean can't approve use vaccines age groups, independent what's prioritized.

And EU exporting vaccines whole time, unlike UK US. Disney right thing allowing verified California residents. wish California same... check European numbers here: [COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker | European Centre Disease Prevention Control They've used mostly Pfizer/Biontech Astrazeneca (mostly UK) Others like China, India, Russia done US fraction GDP per capita logistics infrastructure US has. fact remains we're begging idiots US take incredibly effective vaccines much larger stockpile needed human beings India Brazil dieing unfathomable rate. difficulty viewing link, check archive: choice people wear masks number children die unnecessary deaths, that’s incredibly easy choice make.

But could use logic support number insane restrictions. Requiring everyone wear masks every single flu season would inevitably result decline child flu deaths, would hope people would recognize that’d nuts. There's study Israel -- world leader vax progress, says single shot Pfizer gets 91% efficacy given weeks. 

When someone tries motivate statistics skeptical. People cherry pick statistics fit argument they're promoting.

Two shots better one? Duh, course. ""Dramatic Benefits""? doubt it. little better efficacy probably longer effective vaccine life. IMO worth doing. did. I'll probably third fall/winter offered. tough call? volunteer military. people want it, welcome leave. cases decline, continue decline, happens next? disease become endemic background noise? Presumably enough people vaccinated, probably never be, wiped out(?). give people five Powerball Lottery tickets along vaccine. 

That good job incentivizing ignorant people get vaccine. sacrificed last year people couldn’t handle staying lockdown long enough get virus totally control. What’s extra months minor restrictions wait immunity levels get point don’t need worry virus anymore?   train thought never open even 100% vaccinated 1 20 chance getting it. god bad headline China, forgone conclusion. Canada, 18+ get AZ May 24 Yes.

I'm still sore, heeadache gone energy returning. country that? India? That's 0.7% per day. could done September rate.

Good news. imagine CDC would two households kids mingling indoors, assume people it. know are. I'm US citizen today's latest data = 400k+  whole pandemic revealed bifurcated American health system is. covid leveled communities others, vaccinations there's huge disparity areas, even zip codes county. totally see neighborhood vast majority gotten shots think falling ill dying. balkanized communities (real life &amp; virtual) easy forget places less 1/3 ppl vaccinated. What’s point anyone vaccinated keep wearing masks? mention, outdoor spread barely anything begin with. kid one insane statistical rarities horrendous condition, wtf going school outside anyway? 
I mean good you, keep wearing forever, people gotta feel self righteous something.  Makes sense me. person quite insistent sitting inside didn’t feel like fighting it. second shot wearing good masks. annoyed someone would come get vaccinated sitting mask blathering away room like there’s thing Covid-19. [CITATION NEEDED]

These data two weeks old, recent find:

In Minnesota, [561 breakthrough cases, resulting 6 mortality rate ~1% among breakthrough cases, three orders magnitude larger "".0008%"" number.

Even take account vaccines 95% effective preventing breakthrough cases all, still get close number stating. Don’t worry. mom filled paperwork sent records. Exactly, slacker Redditors panhandling park. Yes, still big decrease, think people (me included) expected deaths fall farther faster cases, haven't. older population got vaccine, figured cases would younger people much better survival rate. hear statement “I got mine, screw everyone else.”  vials ""sitting around"". manufacturing contract company fucked big time, ""we"" go ensure they're actually JnJ vaccine wrong formulation anything like this.

We can't ethically use sure chain custody steps proper   second dose 2 weeks ago, joined ranks ""fully vaccinated"" today! Yet want allow people *pee breaks* let unionize. probably pay less taxes Trump, ant all. know. hard problem. people see branch path get smacked across nose. 


I think sharing sad stories local could help. data, nothing ""others"" suffering places like India. Unfortunately, religious leaders republicans leverage. Israel mounted successful media outreach campaign aimed vaccine-adverse religious community, think try something like that. Everywhere I’ve looked says vaccine stop transmission virus that’s need maintain social distancing mask wearing. Essentially seen vaccine stops dying. That’s could wrong seen anything say otherwise open proven wrong.

The vaccine lowers chance transmission get anxiety/apprehension, 15 minutes probably fine. people room immunity (staff/volunteers plus anyone 2nd dose). Also, could gone sit outside, probably weren’t going physically stop you. will, sake people family sake myself. I've already died really going know First Pfizer *dose* would better framing title Thank appreciate I'll deal last lot worse shit, I've breathing problems that's thing I'm really concerned about.. know anything that? ""it would crime anyone return Australia high-risk country 14 days prior arriving""

Seems reasonable me. graph terrifying Yeah. vaccination US nearly done. Big move. 

Character shows emergency situation. clear yourself.
I didn’t expect anything else Trump egoistic prick. thought Biden might show bit character help rest world. still egoistic stockpiling US completely covered. cares people dying countries. don’t US citizenship, Life worth much. 

I mean, good thing now. rest world knows right bat US still reliable partner business tackling global challenges solidarity. depends hesitant people anti-vaxxers. people unvaccinated, breakout cases happen people still die. literally harassing everyone know still hasn’t vaccinated. think connected India UK? Lmao. know many flights daily NYC London? legal discriminate country long specifically illegal discriminate. I'd put money people staff attorneys rather people scream ""I'll sue"" Facebook. You’re assuming country 1,300,000,000 people can’t mutate COVID new, deadly strain. Indian variant first reported India October. going everywhere now. US enough vaccines, wonder, prioritize first doses Pfizer? way people worldwide could vaccinated.

If J&amp;J Oxford supposedly good enough public like 6x% effectiveness, give many people first dose Pfizer Moderna possible? people, Americans whole able get vaccines. Like poor countries even 1% vaccination rate?

If we're told 2nd shot necessary, that's almost saying J&amp;J ineffective right? including children, that's what, half total population vaccinated? sound like much, especially since unvaccinated people tend show clusters. children particular. Pacific Northwest, totally see happening.  [here’s research mild cases seem be. 

We’re fortunate lots research ongoing rn feel free well! Okay sweet.

Sorry fucked writing, want anyone wants jump help correct that's fine voice text. Yes places them, order help open things midst global pandemic. forever. Why? Canada still administering two doses. lengthened interval save lives working wonders UK. 

I would agree Canada forgone second dose entirely 1984   Okay ? much longer it’s year half basically, come never talk diseases illnesses, even losing weight healthier ? Agreed. County state health departments. Facebook. USA. That’s little complicated then. I’d probably stick outdoors. question regarding vaccine. conspiracy theorist means, questions would like cleared one able clear me. 

Everywhere I’ve looked says vaccine stop transmission virus that’s need maintain social distancing mask wearing. Essentially seen vaccine stops dying. That’s could wrong seen anything say otherwise open proven wrong. 

The virus really affect young people much unless shape underlying health conditions, affected push everyone vaccinated benefit vaccinated? heard need herd immunity, people risk vaccine would need especially considering vaccinated virus still spread. 

As well know risk blood clot insanely low, risk dying young healthy person, take risk vaccine there’s possibility blood clots? 

With talk vaccine passports whatnot, would need vaccine go places still spread like unvaccinated person? difference vaccine make odds dying hospitalized already astronomically low? 

I hope questions make sense, one I’ve talked able answer questions hopefully cleared me. sudden majority people comment section becomes epidemiologists scientists. CU Boulder sure thank goodness. national level companies requiring employees take vaccines. fLu that, uniform across country. 

Large areas country higher uptake, like SF Bay Area already 70%+ least one dose.  could end meaning regional outbreaks instead nation-wide scourge. U.K. 50% AZ clearly really well would want that? comes magic infused strain ""bullshit"" meaning hospitalizations deaths? get want resume life, real costs, real people sickened killed. Politics balancing needs desires EVERYONE, single faction. Sure, ""liberty"" others may risk right health &amp; safety too. little late :/ Oh strongly disagree. Now, reopening may cause jump case rates might cause temporary panic, yes, reverse trajectory. cares. Sure September, doubt difficulty early Summer even. 
 
I looked around recently relative mine, moment places checked nearby booked another two weeks. Fuck em, tbh. Send vials India Brazil. Funny, that's like really good entry exam. smart enough get vaccinated? Probably smart enough higher education either. That's college works anymore waitimg 2 hour lines 5 minute roller coaster rides

Only know hell Disneyland. Pretty straightforward ride big rides minimal wait times. give liberty give death types. know. Free men. ehh anti-vax don’t see need get vaccinated I’m around high risk individuals. Sounds awesome. Get vaccine almost set rich then. know non fda approved vaccine school requires? people think like that. ""It'll never happen me"" thought process people resist things. Condoms, seatbelts, helmets, etc. 

One important reminders pandemic gave us crucial messaging is. People live logic, live feel. whole family got Covid. thing mom brother got week earlier close recovered. cough lost sense smell taste. okay near chance get affected me? Sorry stupid question. Kind ironic everyone falsely calling covid flu. I'm pretty sure able stop public walking unmasked public campus regardless. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Of course possible new strain resistant mRNA vaccines AZ suddenly want back ASAP. barely realm even possible best though. general US want back. like conspiracy relies literally every political leader doctor lying it. Even politicians, even telling truth would DESTROY political rival. Nope; they're lying for... reasons? Yep, people's rights away want. could terminated, article clearly states gave two week notice?

Like, stupid people?  Hilarious everyone shitting yet agreeing time :P still defending Modi, something genuinely wrong you. Nah, Sweden respects freedom individuals body much. interesting see UK pays price back end (will spike immunity wears earlier, perhaps next September?). Probably worth gamble especially given incredibly success lately got second last week. hope night bad mine. Still, small price pay would necessary 3 weeks since J&amp;J pause US daily 1 dose vaccination rate went 2.4M per day even 800k per day. 

This going get drawn even people getting vaccine.   wonder (if any) kind privacy protection come kind service. Mine one them! UMass Amherst. Seems prudent. High odds aren’t wearing masks unless forced shop send kids school. People dumb. nah plenty undocumented florida, pew estimating 775,000 2019, gives florida 3rd highest number undocumented folks. undocumented mexicans small minority number, 15%, safe assume majority ethnicities, including cubans came ending wet foot dry foot policy  Maybe family ones messed up? care virus insofar affects them. need better, don’t understand wouldn’t want to.

Because better means world come another year-long standstill, that's going work. Wishful thinking one thing, really think that's going look like actual reality.

There lot dangerous diseases world COVID-19 one more. Great job, Tucker Carlson &amp; Joe Rogan! Children “choosing get vaccinated.” can’t.

It’s also absurd suggest normal activities, mask on, equals “putting life hold.” seems plan. means hundreds millions vaccinations per year U.S. alone. Pharma lobbyist really work time. Lol. already happened US. 

You take care family friends first that's human nature. illegal. I'm sorry ever posted that. I've Debbie downer ever since started. Thanks answers. know 2 shots Pfizer important worry much. 

I thought wasting 2nd doses giving people access 1 dose.

So I'm guessing generally though, Pfizer J&amp;J might effective people know/think.

Because know many people actually infected many people show symptoms.

Do know single shot effective everyone Covid, including people never mild/severe reaction?

Is single shot effective worse symptoms were? thats say, floridas numbers currently northeasts, whatever did, ended hurting No.
Women vaccine gotten pregnant. Women gotten pregnant vaccine. They’ve done fine.

One solid fact pregnancy coronavirus pregnant women get infected high risk patients. best way protect mom baby mom vaccinated. protection raises time. day basically zero protection, 14 days around 90%. 28 days got second shot, knows. studies this, though I'm working memory I'm careful state much. Religion phony nature, realize it’s oxymoron. replied way post me. current rate decline 2-3 days falling 1mm new doses. time 100mm people yet even start vaccination. Awesome. Great news I'll never understand one professional health care industry apparent belief faith science. /r/byebyejob say ""rollout"" I'm referring medical aspect, logistical one. Improving reach minority low-income communities, etc. important agree that's really related asking, medically necessary second shot is. 
 
To answer original question ""why forego second shot get J&amp;J-level immunity?"": that's people spent literal decades researching, testing, building vaccine process determined needs work. That's really it. You’ll find airlines try increase flights run Tuesday. desperation small amount inoculation better none. politically adventagius. wonder rates tick back indoor restaurants venues open up, require proof vaccination?

I know least one company working LA County provide smartphone ""wallet"" vaccination cards crosschecked country vaccination records. misinformation echo chamber he/she lives deafening long vaccine covers new variants well, otherwise false security. Im really gonna bother everything else said limited view comment 

The vast majority binding sites protein. Covaxin doesn’t, practice offer “bigger view” virus vast majority antibodies still bind spike. inactivated virus simply another method presenting spike. rest plays extremely minor role neutralization. Covaxin designed way, again, prominent antibody binding location.  far definitive proof vaccinated people infectious. disturbing? Tell starts throwing rallies thousands slavering fans laugh calls Hindu flu. Possibly favorite movie tbh, fantastic 34 participants...nice.

I'll take much recent study 43,000 participants: People really romanticising end pandemic. Nope! conspiracy based guy claimed see remarkable similarity two proteins IMPRESSIVELY DISSIMILAR. Like, wanted modeling dissimilar proteins, I'd pick two, that's ridiculous conspiracy is.

No need concerned fertility!  probably case. NYT remove Covid tracker app homepage? us unfortunate experience finding many close circle belong one groups.

It's honestly shocking many people know intention getting vaccine. lot even reason, think important. strange experience sure. I'm way, I'm going normal things often used  Remember saying Disney World opened too?

Ah, good times, good times... defund marijuana legal states since flaunting federal law? gist: Krystal shows Gate's claims IP protections obstructive distribution demonstrably false. video also shows long-term pattern behavior Gates affecting one disease cure. sorely mistaken think US remain restricted year waiting rest world vaccinate. summer, vast majority restrictions US gone us living mostly normally. There's benefit us sitting homes hypothetical threat variant popping somewhere world.

People also need stop taking article faith vaccine-escaping variant inevitable coming us. Can’t say guys, I’m sure stick.

Yes, said already, already explained SCOTUS many lower courts stated federal employment protections religion apply religious choice trying cite protected public health risk. So, no, religion protected class would apply. also believes people get vaccinated due mental health ""selfish assholes.""

I would personally like see vaccination tied visas (vax'd within certain amount time plus quarantine measures upon arrival) supercedes state regulations. Vaccine refusal would make infringing persons religious beliefs, discrimination. covered illegal at-will employment. still within legal boundaries fire someone. U.S. Department Education tallies nearly **4,000 colleges universities**. U.S. News ranked included **1,452 schools** 2021 best college rankings filtering criteria.

So assume take 1400 colleges seriously, maybe 100 requiring vaccination, unless portion hundred discarded 2500 ""colleges"". we're optimistic, 100 ""real"" colleges, that's still 7% requiring vaccination attend.

Not looking good folks.   It’s 55% adults, demand slowing, hasn’t stopped. We’re still administered 1 million first doses per day (seven day moving average).

I also think we’ll see uptick data unpausing J&amp;J starts trickling in. Many colleges postpone vaccination drives, hold again. sure say they're less dangerous people enable anti-vax conspiracy theorists say, ""look, people want masks distancing 4ever"". making jobs even easier already is. we're going stifle voices anti-vaxxers people deny existence Covid, probably right thing do, also stifle opposite equally aggressive side.

Also, I'm sympathetic towards people Covid anxiety, really am, turns something like attacking someone walking outside mask on, even outside large crowd, miss shit. Yes Enjoy it! People country age still wait least good two months much infection everywhere India, opportunity maintain/decrease cases via lockdown also closing can't wait second dose moderna. number Pfizer/BioNTech correct? seems awfully high. it’s true, seems like ahead schedule. mean too, eff Covid. 

I guess mean people lifting finger since day one, complaining way bunch us can’t say screw die. spent year ignoring half million deaths spend time amplifying blips radar comes effective tool get mess. 

Congrats vax. I’m 8 days past 2nd Moderna dose. Retrieving records sent third party third party verification.

Third party verification would presented vaccine card able check validity without consent me. driver's license, university degree items public record, personal health information. still get it. reason vaccine available young people risks vaccinations lower risks get covid. risks low serious outcomes, risks vaccines significantly lower. Someone tried real funny immune response effective immune response resulted immunity completely different set criteria US already 50% eligible population vaccinated (at least one shot) still administering 1 million first doses per day average. Although demand falling, looks like haven’t started reporting much J&amp;J data since resumed. (J&amp;J used target college students, homeless people, homebound disabled people.)

We’re well vaccines, people making right choice. Infections falling accordingly. standard far majority work places united states.

Lol, serious? At-will default America. Like, yes, exceptions *where law makes explicit.* knowledge, laws make explicit can't fired vaccine refusal. even studies said it’s bother, talking like fist fighting brick lmao  Taking vaccine makes risk even lower. not? Nop, applies companies receiving state's grants contracts may lose applies customers, employers. may change that... hit Constitution wall likely lose. actually access myself, sorry. know compiling list seen referred elsewhere. First, vast majority college students legal adults, referring kids simply misrepresentation. Second, it’s students whose risk low; it’s faculty, staff, members surrounding community often much greater risk. disease highly contagious, getting vaccinated individual’s wish protection. Hey healthy 21-year-old scheduled get vaccinated evening. still get right? I’ve seeing stuff certain figures saying shouldn’t get you’re young like Joe Rogan don’t really know believe? Yeah read “no one knows.”  french disagree source? They'll likely given campus cases advance semester. colleges probably require quarantine two weeks campus give vaccine. Exempting foreign students make sense. Outstanding point, hadn’t considered Things never thought I'd ever read/hear:

*...reached Shauna Pomerantz, TikTok scholar associate professor Brock University, Ontario.*

#tiktok scholar Nobody knew mRNA vaccines would quite easy scale been. Nobody knew viral vector vaccines would difficult. win some, lose some. At-will employment requires sign contract order accept it, standard far majority work places united states. really research spouting stuff clue about. I'm curious considering industry dead year shut unvaccinated coworker, think managers would lose collective shit. see others taking court. everyone get vaccinated though medical reasons. Compromised immune systems example. herd immunity important.

But think fair give stimulus people medically can't qualify for. 100 colleges... even end hospital someone brings in. Insurance knows already. unvaxxed threat unvaxxed. Let 'em take out, care?  I'd say opposite: even made tons doses, overpromising still serious problem, sniffed at...

Countries planned vaccination based promises. Many countries buy enough manufacturers thought would get enough AZ, finally negotiate others late get doses late. second shot might convenient might reschedule schedule somewhere close house (like me) shots way abundant march Puny Mantellian. protected class cant get vaccination religion mean?

Multiple courts, including SCOTUS, ruled discrimination protections based religion apply public cant hire fire people reason.

Yes, literally can. called At-Will Employment, standard American law, unless explicitly contradicted another law. unless someone passes law protecting vaccination status (which might), legal. Yeah really fucked. least school providing foreign students currently states.

The warnings vaccine bidding wars course one power listened. one saying changes reason get vaccine. also can't wait get vaccine little ""Hey might happen... alarmed, normal sign anything dangerous"" would nice. Instead doctors defaulting telling women they're crazy there's possible way month long period immediately getting vaccinated could side effect.  risk? would identify that? 60M doses vials. Hopefully vaccines ok quality wise - would tragic. Yet still see people wearing gloves shopping local stores. allow it. form print out, tell authorizing see records, sign it, fax back states.

Had kids school multiple times. isn’t easily expandable employers lot faxed paper work. probably need expand log in, hit “mail copy address.” Well that’s accurate. women developed blood clots J&amp;J got 6-15 days vaccine. Idk you’re getting 15 min hours sad. Evil, evil virus think Oklahoma already said public schools &amp; universities receive state funding require covid vaccines.  feel like would world news. 

Can provide evidence claim? Good don’t care. 18000 credits something. 18 hurt me. pointing saw news. nerds read way want read that. screenshot list something instead linking another paywall, especially complained paywalls?  clearly are, bitched downvotes blamed others problem *you*.   know person doesn’t understand anything HIPAA say it’s HIPPA should. Vaccination highly effective fool proof. universally available. Even age restrictions, immunocompromised get full benefit even though counter indication vaccination fails protect them: know AFAIK.

The biggest benefit vaccination multiplicative. 5% chance infection much better 100%. know what's way better? hang others also 5% risk infection. That's .25% risk (of giving you, assuming exposed manner would guaranteed infection unvaccinated person). live society 90% share 5% risk, well, thing can't take hold area.

We actually effect US measles time. introduced dozens times year US, burns little spread unless finds community lot anti-vax moms. people need protection can't get vaccine: kids (currently), people allergies vaccines medical contraindications lots immunocompromised people get much protection vaccine. Herd immunity reduces transmission among whole community vulnerable protected. Also lot variants believed incubated immunocompromised folks long covid who's immune systems fight virus quickly, allowing time mutate. protecting people getting infected helps protect everyone potential dangerous variants! someone understand relative risk, bet think do. protected class cant get vaccination religion mean? unless work right work state cant hire fire people reason. govt already stepped protect employees. tell hire fire. internet lot pissed individuals unhappy life, like you, who, read things way feel inside. here. It’s either continue open wait see cases continue decline (or increase), stay home wait see cases turn out. Either way, it’s wait see game, best thing get vaccinated trust judgement. Totally agree understand. 

I tried logic, emotion, ridicule nothing seems influence people. want students getting sick pandemic? I’m also J&amp;J gang, one done baby. article hilarious, dont follow tikTok didnt realize going Except scenario accepted flu century, reason unacceptable COVID? two viruses IFR, lot people died COVID lot people *caught* COVID vaccine. is. I’m deeply disappointed AstraZeneca deliveries now, it’s great relief see production delayed suggested couple months ago. Yes, much, much lower initial estimate, latest delivery large vaccine delivery help immensely. Netherlands means everyone 60 first shot, urgent risk groups vaccinated shortly. doses one facility created allowed circulated facility approved, still get J&amp;J vaccines made factories. I'm sure schools implement policy time goes on.

It's completely understandable precedent requiring vaccinations, hope people actual medical issues would prevent receiving vaccine (legit, anti-vax bullshit reasons), denied entry school. 

The whole point vaccinate everyone safely vaccinated protect high risk can't vaccinated. 

I'm envisioning bureaucratic bullshit inevitably make life harder immuncompromized students staff. Hopefully legitimate exceptions built system, like expect case vaccine requirements, though know sure. bout, Covid killed 10 20X typical yearly flu mortality. say, likely perhaps acceptably low future. Unless variant develops makes world start again.

That could happen flu given horror 1918 Spanish Flu. take flu lightly.

There's justification excuse can. pass law allows infect one else. went day (morning shots) day shots felt completely fine. soreness site injection. one 20 times deadly, sure, keep showing us never stepped foot college None vaccines US caused single death Well, PA 7 day average decreasing streak end point... details pharmacy report? Yes is. downvoted saying that. truth.

At least lifted export controls materials India manufacture own, export controls seem lifted Pfizer well. Hopefully Moderna next.

Lots talk astrazeneca world still waits. Europe, Russia China world leaders comes vaccine distribution.

I imagine future students ask share vaccines earlier almost 100 million sitting ice, India countries crisis. Nobody forced get Sounds like never went That's responsible answer, media would probably fun. Demand definitely big part logistics probably issue. consumption far less produce. pm details too. Sounds like already Oh lord. think someone 25 can't catch spread it??? talking concerned 1 dose offering adequate protection - reason they’re supply, hence they’re considering mixing Moderna Pfizer. Try keep up. don't, danger children embarrassment generation.

Get it. theory, yes. practice, incredibly hard. last thing Biden needs bunch civil disobedience among military personnel, followed significant number courts martial, creating martyrs conservative anti-vaxxers. horrible look. Might worth it, cost line.  Sure prove god real we'll give exemption That's fine, also respect schools wanting keep people safe  perhaps individuals might anti-vax pro-pandemic. fact arbitrarily dismiss largest cable news channel says lot. quite frankly news sources bad worse Fox News. add lewis &amp; clark college well placation stupidity irrationality going ultimate downfall, swear. likely case shortly FDA approval. thought card/passport. However, recover password Walgreens appointment, asked bunch security questions could come personal credit report. interesting never gave social security number. 

Anyway, point I'm getting vaccine information likely tied identity/social security number. I'm fine bet drive anti-vax conspiracy theorists absolutely nuts. college FDA approved? military still gets smallpox vaccines smallpox ""eradicated"" since late 1970's  Remember people still get sick normal, addition things like COVID influenza. I'm saying COVID flu, easy convince did! Allergies seldom cause fevers, worth. happy news. like it. little math: 1 14 7%, meaning 93% people hospitalized first jab. That's vaccine's overall effectiveness rate anyway. sure says anything all. Bruh what. put quotation marks cuz referencing comment.

The Quebec government hasn’t started shortening four month interval nursing homes, period. You’re inaccurate saying are. That’s all. complete protocol (two jabs) less protected new variants. 

How news opposed common sense? 🙄  let people enjoy enjoy. may missed it, huge deal people. Neither yours, seems. perfectly valid concerns government organization making something mandatory yet fully approved. make ""anti vaxxers"". CDC guidance says visiting unmasked fine long one households unvaccinated people they're high risk. 
FWIW, let son play vaccinated family members like 2019 worry all. kids also can't vaccinated that's tricky navigate, IMO. so? Testing? krispy kreme gives free donut  need to? variant proven escape vaccines. also evidence readily re-infect natural immunity.

Personally, believe corrupt extent would intentionally misrepresent positivity rate, agree system underreporting cases deaths design. I've noticed lot needle-phobic people, mostly guys. ask still vaccinated and, mostly lame excuses, find real reason simply like shots.  single dose Pfizer's (PFE.N) coronavirus vaccine may generate sufficient immune response protect dominant new variants, except people already infected COVID-19, according UK study published Friday. immune response first dose shot weaker people previously infected, potentially leaving risk variants, researchers leading work said. research, published journal Science, analysed blood samples presence levels immunity original strain SARS-CoV-2 well so-called UK variant, known B.1.1.7, another known B.1.351 emerged South Africa.

Yeah shit Sherlock. Stating obvious doesn’t make sound smart, FYI could make argument probably one concerning variants India discovered yet (just due number cases). Opposite experience me. I’m active 23 year old. Second dose Pfizer last thursday. 101 degree fever crazy body aches day day after. Feeling 60% today. anyone else confused people asking hasn’t major fall deaths numbers? Like 4000 deaths day January like 800. definitely wished much lower it’s still big decrease Someone posted video before--an interview man organizes cremations NGO. said ""in week bodies streets, cremations streets.""

It uploaded 5 days ago. 😕 Maybe willing challenge court? utter bullshit allow University protect students staff. Put mask helping others! see US states lowering age requirement UK still 42 (not sure that.)

Close! Announced today everyone age 40 book on. somebody PLEASE think GDP! people handling post-vaccination life kids? Like CDC said two fully vaccinated families hang indoors problem. kids vaccinated. They're J&amp;J doses.

Why reserved second doses?  We’ll see. Wouldn’t hold breath. I'm expert, studies vaccine say reduces symptomatic infections 90+%. assume either high concentration dose body takes 2 times fully learn fight effectively.

I hate her. everything power get people resist closings masks fights anything actually improve situation. 

I’m tempted post potential reactions side effects Tylenol response. would lost her. natural immunity recovered people ignored given credit stats reporting?  trying see increase too. far tell, already knew going get 2m next week it’s increasing week. 

The newsworthy portion instead vaccines shipping Michigan instead Europe. Still covid spread Wuhan. see India 14 days, intermediate person give let's say previous day board flight US.
This wise countries like New Zealand mandated 14 day institutional quarantine enter destination country. know successful was. US plan good enough California since least 4/3 - Far slow, Again, blocking flights time India. dangerous likely believe, maybe start think steps advance. Flights  still arriving Europe India couple days ago. check today yesterday .What use measures, curfew whatever, planes full people potentially much lethal variants still travel world. ask  stupid, them, obedient ass.  Sorry, want go fishing outside free travel zone. Cranky. think thing that's missing vulnerable, non-vaccine eligible people would also protected. agree generally, leaving lockdown lot people vaccinated put idiots refusing risk. Anybody know many J&amp;J reported yesterday? Funny everyone talk real world restrictions he’s holding long. anyone know find date data fatalities linked various vaccines? far looks UK least 41 deaths linked blood clotting 209 cases clots low platelet counts recieved Astrazeneca Vaccine. 

To put perspective incidence clots low platelet counts normally 120 whole year deaths adults condition would 5% around 6 deaths year.

So mind **just months** cases low platelet clotting almost double national average 41 deaths puts deaths 20% reported cases. Obviously cases clotting low platelets may unreported yet included figures would bring percentage down. 

I also could find data long term effects condition chronic impact longer term mortality even life threatening time. know AZ vaccine induced low platelet clotting (ITP) carries risks.

I would like find detailed information affected complication vaccination, risks mortality relating vaccines are? Globally UK.

I Covid fine even though 40 relish idea using vaccine (AZ) risks safer vaccines available. Starting today (May 1st), walk-ins longer allowed. So, current rush subside. 

If can, make appointment CoWin state/centre vaccination centre near you. believe Central govt stock still available 45+, 18-45 State government private clinics stock (which order - but, received yet). So, places CoWin (at least Tamil Nadu) accepting appointments 45+.

 slots filling fast though..Hope able get appointment soon. Stay safe :) Trump Modi buddies. narcissists. Thankfully guys Trump idiot gargantuan proportions. Modi isn't. He's cunning shifty able change narrative time fucked up. one might big though. time tell. going vary lot state maybe city county. many parts country months ago. NY NJ starting see pretty good numbers. think dominoes going start fall soon we'll back pretty normal Memorial Day. one really respects time Javits. It’s big returned second, didn’t seem like 10:30 dot. really Russia, Putin pretends big mighty keep public image, Russia relatively little geopolitical economic power beyond immediate neighbours, compared China U.S. God love reddit compares ban Chinese nationals coming directly China. older policy, anyone Chinese national could come directly China Chinese national could come US via anyone Chinese national could come directly Azar explained announced travel restrictions Jan. 31, **the policy prohibits non-U.S. citizens**, immediate family U.S. citizens permanent residents, **who traveled China within last two weeks entering U.S.**

You literally made shit event year ago covered exhaustive details 1000s articles 1000s hours TV coverage. ""anyone Chinese national could come directly China"" get reddit comment? holy Trump bans foreign nationals traveled China entering US. There’s mandatory quarantine, foreign national traveled within China last 14 days allowed enter United States, according proclamation President Trump. US citizen traveled China undergo health screening upon entry country asked self-quarantine 14 days. US citizens traveled Hubei province, virus originated, held mandatory quarantine 14 days We’re past day it’s time
To fuck coronafuhrer specify kind restrictions? European plant also producing Xanax stress lessen soon No, won't. even opened UK, almost eliminated COVID. we're unlikely reach full-blown herd immunity IMO. we'll probably hover somewhere 60's range children's vaccine approved. cases fall still localized outbreaks we'll watchful variants coming outside US immune escape. think we'll end needing annual COVID shot least next years not, like, good. ...make food? control take out. 

Hence said, vaccine mere months away would take risk, matter small? I'm also 100% surfaces thing. happened studies showing long lasts surfaces? Seems like trying keep simple people since air travel primary concern.

Very interesting china included ban. article sort casually mentions it.

I wonder why, seen news major uptick china, California State University system University California system listed single line, list reality much longer.  People like me, built pure muscle ounce fat, actually soak tub vaccines contents absorb via osmosis (trust know works googled it). think first shot bad wait second one dump micro chips bath you. 5g reception tremendously increased though. vaccine stop transmission virus

This pretty debatable. Many studies shown cuts transmission way including study CDC. apparently studies convincing enough people make public statements. read carefully usually say something like ""we can't sure vaccine reduces transmission"" opposed ""we sure vaccine reduce transmission"". Like, proven yet, actually know.

I agree point though reduce transmission, little personal risk, what's point? say something like immediately criticized ""anti vax"" ""conspiracy theorist"" ""Joe Rogan"" whatever. agree logic.

I feel pretty sure vaccine reduce transmission significantly lot scientists doctors agree, virtually every vaccine works. Hopefully experts finally agree change saying it. France opening us tourist 9th june guess us same? make sens ban vaccinated people sad... hope outbreak least help encourage vaccine hesitant people across globe give whirl. least little? many? Canada rules 659,041 died heart disease US 2019. Yet McDonalds never forced close 2020. Sorry incorrect. UK restricting 30+ people age 40 can’t even really get vaccine moment it’s based priority groups. Next week it’s likely UK restrict 40+ come release 30+ cohort able book vaccine. could, message. 

If said month two, says they're constantly monitoring updating needed. gives people faith arbitrarily. 

Four months says ""no matter do, we're still long time"" (even technically could retract this). makes feel like things people (getting vaccinated, wearing masks, etc) matter. said month two now, could extend data says necessary. know benefit picking longer amount time is. scientific evidence could happen last year. 

There none right totally different situation. way would make vaccinated inconvenient, travel restrictions wear masks vaccinated to. know else would work tbh. country this? is. know plant Michigan huge never expected able expand production much one location. 100m/month alot one site. ?? cited numerous scientific studies, including Centers Disease Control Prevention report published Wednesday found Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna Covid-19 vaccines 64% effective preventing hospitalizations elderly one shot 94% effective two doses. study evaluated 417 hospitalized adults across 14 states January March.

That’s pretty dramatic benefit decreased hospitalization. efficacy one dose vary widely depending age individual’s immune system. also seems two doses greater protection variants. That’s blood clotting properties COVID neglected tell us about. Aspirin would’ve great prophylactic this, nobody talked that. things already mandatory vaccines, fine. I’m even kinda fine large planned event like concert. come complete lack distancing, masks, anything else like that. don’t wanna anything those. Israel allowing vaccinated people full, maskless access bars clubs indoor dining early late March. That's well ahead states like California time (and degree still are). nationwide vaccine passport society a) half folks vaccinated b) said passport effectively serves pass normal life restrictive sounds. Vaccinated individuals several states fewer options Israelis, even now. like 3 weeks offering one everyone wants one lots vaccines delivered.

Lol, wish. like 3 months sides fair too. Every opposition knows government fails, win...  checked available appointments county’s largest vaccine site last night 11:45 fully booked 70 available. Saturday 40 times available Monday 100 Tuesday 120. That's good know. 

Stay safe there! one hand could call anti-vax, could say way encourage people get 2nd shots still risk first.

Truth is, still risk even 2nd vaccine. Nothing ever 100%. 95% plenty.

This problem messaging... easy interpret either way. need get better communicating message. many hours day / week? Probably minions r/coronaviruswa think wrong.  Cope harder fear uncertainty doubt here, saying schools waiting full fda approval might well say require can’t mandate fully fda approved However, really wish productions filmed TV, virus not. Hamilton movie enormous success Disney+ probably allowed millions people see show otherwise never would. suffer narrow urethra like certain propane salesman  I’m one quoting article, looney tune. 

You’re one claiming things happened directly contradicted article. 

You’re insane. You’re going ignore. gaslighting bit heart’s content. cases high need restrictions. One thing grateful mom teaching recieve medical needle concentrated breathing back toddler.

Look (away needle), smell roses, blow candles (while needle going in). thank nurse recieve lollipop. 

Never felt thing kid, never panicked resisted way. Still day, though like watch needle people skipping second shot?  haven’t met anyone skipping it. [They announced April 5th found San Francisco I've got sympathy people saying they'll present documents go anywhere rest life- said anything permanently? Sorry questions, really bearing real threat is. ""common sense"" thinks well mutate dangerous spreading billion times, probably won't. maybe right.

Thanks answers. FOUR... 9 million threat now?

That gives flashback February last year. variant evades vaccine course start cases.  Source this? haven’t heard anyone dying Covid getting vaccinated waiting appropriate time. Maybe, actually cared vaccinating many people possible would argue comments smugly counter productive. really. policy never issue one shot. Hence UK 80% 2nd shots every day. policy extend gap allow people get vaccinated ASAP.
 
You may potential vulnerability one shot, 100% guaranteed vulnerability shots all. never going away then? Fuck good strategy despite this. people protected even protection weaker newer variants time anyway. Typical Western hubris. Reminds sure masks don’t help even though everyone Asia wearing them. ""Heavily involved"" lol Many people died covid despite vaccinated. always fairly mild. yes, matter. BC promised one dose end June latest wouldn’t surprised it’s bit earlier. Fuck Dodgers, respectfully

-giants fan  cite study? 2 weeks first dose Pfizer said 50% efficacy Israeli study said 33%. (I'm 2 weeks 1st dose). Thanks. That's interesting data point. done month ago  post going able receive *any* topic comments??? it’s not.

We could always people die. vague all, military requires voluntary informed consent vaccines EUA. overridden presidential order driven clear national security threat, covid currently not. list Canadian Universities Colleges? said words. Good job There's study Israel -- world leader vax progress, says single shot Pfizer gets 91% efficacy given weeks.

Link please? citing one took previous study made questionable adjustments number get high?

As actual number, studies map:

The highest one I've seen CDC one. CDC's study showing 80% single-dose efficacy tiny - 4k participants (and young-ish healthcare workers).

The UK Israel ran much larger studies (24k UK one, huge 1.2M Israeli one.) UK found 72% efficacy three weeks first dose; Israel found 66%.

UK study: study: study Sweden 45%: one showing Pfizer vaccine efficacy 52% first dose 95% second dose, paper shows discussing vaccines general, specifically J&amp;J. meant years wrote ""long-term"". 

Is it? blood clots conclusively linked J&amp;J. appears correlation J&amp;J higher risk blood clots, think they've proven causality. could wrong, following J&amp;J story. Yeah currently college professor old could tell republican asking couple questions. said gonna wait get vaccination mask works fine him. post locked nearly new comments off-topic political comments insults. That’s week two, “long term” also immediate disaster many lives lost colossal number cases almost certainly breed new variants, could well undermine whole world's progress vaccines. 
 
The Indian government really, really fucked up. There's need postulate immune escape explain what's happening India. India's vaccination numbers COVID cases low compared population. great majority Indians immunity, even account fact true number cases likely many times higher reported number cases. Eh bad reactions think data would pick pretty easily literally cannot start storing life long memories 3 years older. wouldn’t say 100% certainty, don’t think that’s studied *this one,* vaccine known that, I’d say it’s pretty unlikely.  full ride Harvard guarantee many colleges could transfer get full ride well. tfw can't even bothered find relevant fact conspiracy theory

no idea idea gained traction right, even flu. less that. people infected covid-19, yet tiny portion get symptoms. get infected influenza, definitely going feel it. go back normal now. faster wait see people get faster achieve heard immunity. think it'll still go slowly since things open, eventually we'll see things completely open like 10k cases day one really care anymore. Also, experts agree China acted slowly contain virus. don’t now. one ever forgetting started. Yep. Moderna already testing new formula targets South African variant believe Yeah times nurse giving shot told they'd heard patients Depends administers it. felt first dose(second coming Monday). hurt really, pinch. definitely felt it. I'm wondering world prioritizing Pfizer/Moderna 80%+ effectiveness, also pushing J&amp;J telling people good enough. figure could vaccinating twice many people achieve 80% effectiveness instead 95%. 

Well, starters, one dose probably 80%+ effectiveness. 

 highest one I've seen CDC one. CDC's study showing 80% single-dose efficacy tiny - 4k participants (and young-ish healthcare workers).

The UK Israel ran much larger studies (24k UK one, huge 1.2M Israeli one.) UK found 72% efficacy three weeks first dose; Israel found 66%.

UK study: study: study Sweden 45%: one showing Pfizer vaccine efficacy 52% first dose 95% second dose, paper shows trial participants told stop taking NSAIDS shots. You’re fine. Impossible read due ads. I'm Canada got 1st dose AstraZeneca today. I'm female, 30's work school. round offered teachers first responders town 30 years old. AstraZeneca choice although said MIGHT different kind offered later date, count it. 55 peeps area got Moderna 3 weeks ago. basically, solid reason backed certain facts. don’t think it’s true “China gets praised.” Many people spoken methods including use tech surveillance citizens, forced removals homes, locking people homes allow leave.

Their brutal tactics universally admired praised. Bold move cotton. Private businesses require employees get many already planning that. people want old normal back. True, that's countries UK richer GDP country compares normally.

The vast majority, 98% either banned restricted west. US pop large Europes even approved, EU countries +55 banned Norway Denmark.

It's microscopic minority gives unrestricted besides UK.  think issue people selfish want see direct action get vaccinated. Obviously stated would work everyone thought situation whole, people think *they* get it. talking about? Anyone free study US consenting participants. government going stop limit ability publish findings like country like China would do. lot estimates higher. CDCs estimate fairly higher. 20% would surprising lot people. state stalled around 42% seems like last two weeks Typically side effects show within first 6 weeks

Is possible long term side effects? 30% people keen vaccine fucked.

What's actual uptake rate? Even start immune escape like gonna drop 95% efficacy 25% overnight. We'll developing boosters getting annual shots awhile now. sure cuz thing think scientific experiments require tutus international flights, see it’s effects COVID spread. never know! UCLA list along university California system. course literally going make difference US case rates. asking, I’m pretty sure public universities can’t mandate vaccine fully approved otherwise opens lengthy litigation potential moratorium whatever vaccine requirement. fully FDA approved vaccine required vaccines can’t challenged (not easily anyway) due standing precedent. grandpa already gotten vaccine?

I'm pretty sure work better give arm. also helps flu doesn’t cause asymptomatic spreaders. get flu, you’re going start coughing sneezing. Well, symptoms happen overlap something else that’s going around now, everyone symptoms going assume worst stay home (except get brain tickled).

I truly don’t get people NYC insist wearing masks outside walking street even there’s, relatively speaking even NYC terms, one around. well should. Got second dose Tuesday spent yesterday bed achey joints, sore arm fatigue. great also bad - got this! hit hard vaccines get rid flu too? Sorry. That’s cool there’s layers phrase. It’s like ogre, alien third hand. ever happened still first wave? 😂 Hope gets well soon fail see reason angst statistics reported here. Or, worst, little worry. rate vaccination uptake reportedly decreased 50%. time article says approximately 45% population received least one shot.

Take sample size like, 10, 100, 1000, 10,000 assume constant probability change member sample given time. Call sample size 'x'. Remove 45% sample (already vaccinated). time frame observation event remains *new* probability event 55/100, 55%. number seeking vaccinations **should** decrease situation else remains constant. may still worry wish, subject concern 5%, 50%. Yeah astra would great here. I’m really hoping get least 10 million 60. put numbers bit per-capita context, adjusting population 10 Israeli deaths, would 360 US deaths. Still great improvement current US numbers though. science matter anymore? That's Since flu mutates fast, could make batch closer flu season likely effective strains. create one batch start flu season updated one middle flu season.  already resolved wear mask public places rest life. care people think me, want get sick. Covid really put perspective comfortable breathing air others around us good point. Unfortunately person replied deleted post, context lost. 

Currently, CDC says scientists ""are still learning"" whether vaccinated people spread COVID. means nothing go back normal vaccinated, scientists learn whether fully vaccinated people spread COVID, decide accept certain degree risk. Never seen Larry Nevin reference casual conversation before.  There's people actually can't get vaccine cause allergies 12... saying means want kids get sick die. ...so yeah sociopath. Stop making stupid people famous. original scare story year ago claimed 5G ran frequency 60 GHz (it doesn't), resonance molecular oxygen (it is), changes unbreathable form (it doesn't). time, people fighting breath initial Wuhan outbreak (true) Wuhan supposed site first 5G rollout (it wasn't). Last chacked months ago, David Icke ""Dr. Buttar"" still claiming this.

If story traction, would blowing India, mercifully isn't. That's basically entire media works, unfortunately.

Unsubstantiated BS goes front page, retraction goes halfway page 37 week later. People vastly underestimate exponential growth. 

That's literally major repeated mistake see covidiots.  Laughs bulk billed Australian (bulk billed term covered public health system) $0 doctors visits depending practice go to.  see people interpreting information massive conspiracy theory flu deaths counted covid… Joe Rogan trippin DMT humans animals pass back forth create new strains? tendies! Yay! undersecretary health confirmed days ago! That's pretty accurate. 

We friends former camp. latter group unfortunately tends judgmental. caused fractured friendships. melted September, maybe get lucky cool front. Yeah comment little vague implying that. Sorry. brainwashed. Rupert Murdoch's propaganda empire convinced source accurate news either comes network network biases. fair, thats guess strains circulating (based what's southern hemisphere), since influenza mutates alot, even get infected strain thats shot- might already changed enough vaccine fully protect well could have. 

Interesting see make flu shots year. flu never got covid past year hence controversy Florida biggest state cruise operations sued C.D.C. force restart sailings. **But state passed legislation mandating companies business state get state subsidies cannot require people vaccinated admission service. could make difficult cruise lines guarantee met vaccination rates set C.D.C.’s new letter.**

DeSantis playing 5D chess covid flu, change mind. enigma. Sometimes comes across sensible intellectually curious guy, times block headed moronic times douchebag. Yeah does. I've felt worse actual Covid (I know one 'fortunate' ones there). 

I'm going spend exactly zero percent time worried flu, I'll get flu shot lessen chances getting lessen severity do. Wait, what's a""rainbow"" baby?
edit: nvrmnd live greater Seattle area going gym since reopened last summer. usually pretty full. People care health enough exercise regularly hide-in-the-basement-bunker-and-wait-for-vaccine type. article probably catering people start going gym New Years weeks stop going February. actually seems pretty reasonable. almost everyone vaccinated see cruises could run safely again. would make happy.

One someone else getting vaccinated we're much closer beating this, two might convince someone same. biomarker elevated bacterial viral infection. Well, suppose is. Letting people die sidewalk front hospital economical, repeatable, accomodate almost number patients.

Why rest us think that?

Now reflect moment, believe Boris Johnson did. Agreed sounds like worst thing unless trying help spread 😓 Definitely keep telling everyone stay masked can't return normal life vaccinated, seems really convincing hesitant. Probably schools colleges closed buildings reducing Capacity  boggles mind accepting complacent people getting flu dying flu. seemed almost normalized. Like happen masking least winter indoors distancing prevent deaths illness. 
Also, see RSV sick kids year amazing! Pink frothy sputum, sounds like pulmonary edema Honestly works, works. gets hesitant people states take vaccine, win. Send Canada I'll post video injecting one 'OOH, nice! I'm glad could swipe unsuspecting Americans!!!' - works people. kind thing works mom haha infuriating. hell wrong people? still get Covid19 still linger throughout next flu season influenza may come back vengeance too. think wearing masks peak flu season indoor settings would bad idea. 

At least one good practice may come whole mess normalization masks public settings. Got mine today, done. Originally scheduled pfizer, resumed JJ ones, rescheduled right away. CVS plenty JJ ones, least couple days ago scheduled mine. well covid aerosolized/borderline airborne, flu droplet infection, pandemic measures/ protocols designed fight flu, course worked slow almost stop, now. missed annual trip Montreal punk festival last year, year canceled too. can’t wait get crush Boreals eat poutine smoked meat guys. Poscast 1109 Matthew Walker, sleep get best sleep amazing. rounds neuroscience academia interesting.  Yes, US millions doses wants donate. misleading. listening podcast yesterday talking looked up. numbers went around 20k people still died flu. Given UK lost quite bit credibility delayed response blood clotting issues, independent endorsement Vaxzevria would go long way towards encouraging adoption developing countries.

Additionally, US sitting millions doses don’t want, FDA approval really necessary ethically donate - it’s hard justify donating medical product don’t believe safe use within borders.

FDA approval make big difference worldwide acceptance AZ vaccine, may finally represent turnaround perpetual misfortunes. Perfectly, summed sure that. Argentinian regulators supplied Brazilians techs data vaccination program seems amount errors detected ""erros programáticos"" much higher vaccines. source: people die? Probably safety vaccines gambling game problem.  Amish Mennonites, lot different Mennonite groups, remotely hardcore.  think that’s enough, you’re fooling yourself. One article/study prove anything. Plus, dropped rate work completed body without second dose Pfizer Moderna. want single shot vaccine? Go get J&amp;J.  too. think it’s mistake, following protocol. would nice continued sanitation precautionary measures end flu prevent another outbreak, know businesses 90% people go back nasty restrictions lifted. Nobody? like asking class whose homework gold standard. answer one. Everyone homework. Copying people's work good practice. one dose J&amp;J better one dose Pfizer? know vaccine efficacy rates directly comparable seem like one shot Pfizer likely good one shot J&amp;J? 3 weeks ago got 2nd shot. 
Went public week later, food sports bar, wore masks except eat.
2 days later felt miserable. 
Throat hurt.
Fever.
Tired. 
Just miserable. 
Thinking got covid. Panic sets in.
Go clinic throat closing up.
It's strep. 

I sick since feb 2020 &amp;&amp;&amp; sick. suspect covid. Getting strep...did miss getting sick. all. Prob continue masks lol free speech? mean he's guy speaking mind podcast? Also, that's first line defense, pretty often disclaimer says anything knows super knowledgable about. Honestly curious hear opinion alot. also censor rap music cause talk drugs kids listen it? People Russia distrustful government, wary vaccine developed government. Right, mine manifested sinus infection. would call mild.  Extremists playing culture war. got first AstraZeneca shot night fever/chills/muscle aches, like really bad flu. fever bad years (and work child-care), totally sucked. Still way better actual covid. 


I'll take couple sleepless nights endless fever dream thank much I’m pessimistic that, feel like Americans going see masks painful memory never break next pandemic. I’m one freaks gotten flu years managed remember get flu shot. know I’m anti-vaxxers wet dream, I’m still planning get vaccine on, every year. don’t think quite understood full scale selfish let things spread - keep people developing pneumonia caught flu me, I’m willing take chance more. Joe Rogan really gets nerves.

I think realizes weight says podcast. portion audience takes says word God himself, many people demographic (young men). 

Now nimrods age gonna get vaccine ""because exercise eat well"", they'll give virus chance mutate something that's resistant vaccines pandemic extended even longer.

Was following social media platforms unfollowed comments, they're unforgivable me. [Exports allowed since April 1st, Pfizer already exported first batch US flu contagious diseases always exponential growth. Sometimes reproductive rate (exponential base) 1 1 (negative growth exponential decay).

What normal unintuitive cutting base factor 3 dramatic (indeed, exponential) impact outcome. cutting cases factor 3, cutting factor 3^n n generations. waited four months yours? know anyone has? Eh, that? many frontline worker friends get second dose though. stop embarrassing yourself. see comments you’re crusade complain bicker Qc’s vaccination plan just... please, you’re truly irrational. went round round one day covid would become pre-existing condition whole bunch people next severe anything. might flu, might another coronavirus, might something unrelated even epidemic.

There time sub count anything death big deal brushing deaths pre-existing conditions (my personal anecdote 20-something died meningitis couple years before) coping mechanism stress.

The tone changed know end possible sight, wish could get people talk long term problems benefits vaccination young. Instead get morons like Joe Rogan. I’m 30, healthy, workout 4-6 days week. 

Got covid. Felt like flu. Recovered, still shape thought...

It shape, blood clots leading PE would’ve gone undiagnosed wasn’t hypochondriac. 2 months post COVID. 

2 marathons, regular runner, 10K+ steps day. Young healthy, still got blood clots lungs. happen anyone (and genetic clotting factors). making vaccination records high-stakes document (can't employed without it!), creating powerful reason counterfeiting industry spring up.

I agree people get vaccinated, obviously going 20 30% population going one reason another. 

The upshot vaccination records going less less trustworthy. got this! I'm 31 get systemic/fever issues, sense smell still fucked almost four months later. even know long term is. People fucking cavalier it. hmmmmmm Neil deGrasse Tyson, Elon Musk, Bret Weinstein, Jordan Peterson, Bill Burr.. lots greats. get put with. fun single dose summer, I’ll back US fully protected administration actually cares/follows science. got sick last year scheduled Covid test (was negative) told stay home. testing done. felt better time got results. trick is, start conclusion work backwards. lol. Cool! am
Clearly old one! people don’t take says word God. average listener base KNOWS he’s dude interesting podcast opinion variety questionable subjects.  5g? still get reception??

/s guy pumps full growth hormone, testosterone, steroids, snake oil, jet fuel trying tell ppl need vaccines lmao Sounds like good plan. net corner. Ohioan here... get it. state keeps getting worse worse time. seems like stupid taken getting stronger time. I’m bit skeptical. 

Did flu actually disappear another explanation?

Like maybe simply haven’t testing flu much, earlier days easy testing simply incorrectly labeled many flu patients COVID ? broke seal. mask everywhere used weird. I'm definitely letting people fucking breathe like used to. know bit 2 dose system designed though doesn’t work properly without 2nd dose.

This simply true (either part).

The vaccine works better (and probably lasts longer, although data obviously yet) 2 doses, saying ""doesn't work properly without 2nd dose"" fake anti-science nonsense.  COVID-19 also becomes contagious many major symptoms even appear, compared respiratory diseases. date published, general expectation early may stop holding famous people ridiculous standards Why? deposit still pending something else?. Yeah, cases sharp decline end January increase after, appear reason locked additional 3 1/2 months. Hopefully people go bit crazy actually following insane rules. Ireland. Isn’t also entitled walk back? Kinda like big headline article news incorrect needs walked back. see retraction, one even given. incompetent populist government lead to. lucky Trump kicked office late. see you’re spreading hella negativity. Try little gratitude, might make appreciate actually have. Pouzza. Usually takes place venues near St Denis Latin Quarter. venues Katacombs (RIP) Foufounes Electriques. It’s 3-day punk festival drunk fest! Lol, testing flu? 

“Got Covid? No? Go home.” he’s pro vax know never really thought like that. I'll get flu shot next year. especially getting covid one bad. better safe sorry. You’re lucky wait 4 months second dose? Geez, how’s boot taste buddy? He's wrong..... Exactly this...

I didn’t make decision get stabbed EU announced week vaccinated Americans allowed summer...

In NY...I still wear mask work, outside, vaccinated...why take time day go get vaccine don’t want?  Although there's evidence since beginning airborne, consensus building recently. big paper month. therapist said help make least least scary scary things fully vaccinated. maybe simply exposure therapy, like what’s least scary. example, going shopping person fun kn95 mask least scary me, that’s started doing! hospitalized mild, moderate hospital intervention and/or oxygen required, severe ventilator and/or ICU care. Florida banned requiring vaccination customers bet ban employees too. believe respiratory issues/trouble breathing, moderate symptoms. positive though. would u rather apologize say anything matter?

Notes: 

* Pfizer EUA expanded age 12, eligible population increased 6,020,000+. also make change total population 7,029,917 (from 2020 census) time.
* (- n days) means n days later, away, compared peak 60,522 back 4/14. country opened start December circuit breaker lockdown Oct/Nov. government promised would normal Christmas everyone travelled back home brought British variant droves. January absolute disaster highest rates per capita world, almost one percent population tested positive space week alone January even entering lockdown 26th December nothing changed since. Thankfully lockdown worked hospitals didn’t become overwhelmed positive cases deaths high January Feb think government afraid we’ll go bit mad open staving long possible people vaccinated. Shoulda Sprung full Pfizer experience! need create incentives selfish people. Maybe pay something, develop vaccine passports gives vaccinated people benefits. worrying part tbis guy finished 2 weeks quarantine safely... rapid test PCR? Depends place I’m there, yes. risk vaccinated person good health, like me, low. generally don’t hang crowded indoor spaces anyway concerts, honestly can’t wait get back to. Proving unfit comment issue all. people saying June India starts pull this? that's case, way things escalating, that's long two months. definitely can! like changed mother’s May 21st June 24th month first dose - joke 🤣 Mass vaccination sites exist, although places shutting since aren’t filling appointments. yes ask insurance info don’t charge don’t insurance, copay. didn’t know taint sweat candles isn’t really minor, terms quality life. anosmia virus years ago. (Negative flu, telling was, nasty.) Mine came back unchanged, quickly, soon recovered, probably kind damage Covid does, *really awful.* didn’t really want eat, felt depressed. It’s bigger deal people think.   Iam looking vaccinespotter Texas cant fathom 37% done availability. Texas Texas. average 2009-2010 2019-20 43 percent. Anyone else surprised MS considering vaccine rates?  Yes. Exactly. haven’t enough doses start scrambling. guess we’ll wait get act together hope 1 dose 2 dose vaccine enough. Good enough us! Every state database. states keep track immunizations administered state Rest Canada.

QC ahead most/all provinces. Yea it’s absolutely ridiculous. work health coworkers though insurance going charged. It’s surprising people think tried different brands different places, fiji water oddest taste it. brands tried, warm cold, prefer cold, lie little bit, fridge water dispenser, water goes two filters, honestly best tasting water I've had. Mines spotty, darn Moderna stop spouting medical advice. Thank Reddit 😎 … it’s flu…. Smh Canadian , yes absolutely go Mexico. listen him. really enjoy podcasts magic mushrooms, ancient earth, aliens, etc. can't get behind starts going politics skip episodes, opinions covid. 

But disagree opinions necessarily mean content trash... Oregon, same. forgot even thing. Except hardly seems walked back (not disagreeing observation btw). takes several weeks ships make India.

Vaccines flown priority air. takes mere hours ship side world. would rather issue genuine apology proceed stay lane. It’s like options fake apology nothing all. Well, flu 35 years, guess I'll keep I'm doing. 60 million doses still 30 million people, almost entire population Canada . Theres thing drop bucket something magnitude. Imagine 5 countries 60 million doses hut attitude amongst drop bucket. Isolated safe atleast till vaccine product goes overdrive He's always saying ""listen, I'm dumb, listen me."" fucking get it. People listen matter many times says responsibility stop spouting moronic nonsense hurt people. health care workers, law enforcement officers tourists also exempt stay-home order.

What tourist going everything closed locals shut homes....ride alongs local police? work school district one offered us. got really sick days I’d again. Also sold us taking, even though less effectiveness, bc single dose. 

Most people worried virus health took two shot. honestly think isn’t terrible pitch. Young people get one shot since statistically you’re less likely get sick anyways older people get effective shot. really sure come conclusion.

Because want to. Sadly, anti-vaxxers/anti-maskers/anti-lockdown idiots argument ""98% survival rate"" whatever number they're using. Apparently care people get severely sick, long-term effects virus body, toll takes hospitals Covid allowed spread rapidly. probably walk pharmacy june second dose. raining vaccines soon Canada Notice Daniel Bier draw line CDC graph?

[Go makes point lot harder make dive starts two days prior pause 13th. Instead chose draw lines graphs. Graphs I'm sure came from, assume use reporting date, administered date, placement drops. Proud say I’m one group. 29F US isn’t “doing nothing,” want US citizens working abroad come back US cause India’s healthcare system shambles right now. means get sick enough go hospital, doomed stuck India. I’m sure quarantine protocols place isn’t “laziness” US. may go waiting period shots. 🤷🏻‍♀️ got Pfizer #2 yesterday. started feeling minor fatigue ~8 hours afterwards. around 12 hours after, started getting fever + headache lasted day today. Feeling basically 100% [ Good Old Day ]( ) UK extra order also coming US seems. surprise me. I'm 45 first time remember gotten sick year. usually get 2 3 sore throats respiratory infections per year. Theyre saying Covid19 tests positive flu. Could used closer shades blue map? /s Appreciate sentiment, think moment would better sending o2, masks ppe, stuff acute care. Vaccines too, sadly vaccines won’t help current crisis. Let remind copy ( piracy) legal Brazil long sales profit it. done sure save lots people. 
A close relative mine died yesterday it. data 

This response simple question leadership behaves whether reflected death rates, population behaves. TV appearances hoopla Andrew Cuomo, Ron DeSantis ultimately better job protecting elderly state disproportionately burdened retirees. Understandably, New York one first states deal pandemic, perhaps forgiven transferring infected people back elder care homes, monumentally stupid might appear. 

Also, respect looking populations: Given [obesity lot GOP counties, possibly older Americans likely vote GOP, mortality rates strongly distorted factors politically-linked compliance leadership demands.

Dr. Drew go back advising 20 year old guys one testicles big potato. Totally agree. think reducing ""Goop men"" diminishes **ridiculous** amount social influence man has

Gwenyth Paltrow basically nobody compared Rogan definitely big one too. Shopping carts too. too. long time listener many years. Started listening 2013 spread JRE around friends. Now, disappointed. There's going better version JRE one day, though. definitely frustrating. Damn. actually likely worse, we've passing around mostly human specific flu viruses, occasional zoonotic jump sprinkled in, zoonotic jumps happen hear it, swine flu, bird flu ect ect, hear time severe strains, one happens pandemic capable could seriously fuck us up. covid scared commonly called nuclear flu, zoonotic jump leathal infective. still scared nuclear flu coivd, probably since we've practically accidentally wiped avarage flu virus. possible flu vaccination rates could rise substantially flu anymore ever.

Moderna already working covid+flu vaccine I'm sure others far behind. could imagine covid vaccine becoming required many settings flu vaccine ever was, voluntary uptake likely higher flu well. would surprised end permanently much higher rate flu vaccination.

Of course, always get season strains match vaccine think pandemic flu ever really gone, could see disease burden greatly reduced. Plenty counties massive need vaccines. they’re getting used here, let’s ship em out. Turns out, barely graduating high school qualify someone dispense medical advice. \*HIPPA entered chat\* We'll probably also get lot better making good vaccines research last year, including beginning use mRNA multivalent flu vaccinations. could become incredibly cheap vaccinate wider spectrum flu possibilities.  *Boogaflu
How could fuck perfect come back? Exactly. second shot (the booster) included trial design made trial likely successful, Pfizer/Moderna want run trials single-shot trial ineffective. antibodies shots given?

Because herd immunity important, don’t think that’s specific metric goal immediately looked article happen Joe participate it, real. We're pink inside. joe rogan king medical lab oversee mostly getting orders covid flu providers since beginning pandemic. tested *way more* people typical flu season, ten positive flu results year. nuts. Jocko good podcast interviews veterans Jiu jitsu guys.  wanted say mjolk. Guess JRE T-shirt bought year total waste money... Yeah, enough deal sure. Wishing best! :) people comment shit they’re passionate/ knowledgeable seldom post. standards, account seems WAY fake, I’m totally definitely probably really real person. Yes tested time. tested negative based symptoms doctor told flu test almost certainly wrong. There's lots open appointments LA county May. April booked. know thread question, new. applied sorts ways. gripping hand, flu lot animal reservoirs. necessarily spread scratch.

This important fact, Im told. 

I also wonder flu vaccine less effective. 

1. effective flu circulating, thus mutating much. 

or 

2. effective enough circulating accurately monitor predict it. understanding flu shots calibrated year based strain flu scientists expect dominant year, flu cases low season, may enough data make accurate prediction next season. hopefully get high enough sort herd immunity Oh cool damage done Went best friend get second dose local food city pharmacy Monday. asked seen rise vaccinations since Virginia opened everyone 16 finally. pharmacist said they're seeing cancelations friend said may something ask insurance making people think free without it. reply time free ""everyone getting bill her"" 

I assured charge insurance cannot charge people without said regardless. Boy, can't wait people sue crap food city. Looks like, I'm getting job..

Fuck getting vaccine.. 👀👀 Mine does. I'm glad it. Thats figure case. COVID, must flu stay home case. know they've tested people I'd like see number tests given year year. Nah I'm good. Yep, completely agree. Seems best middle eastern gay bear nightlife (this important me) I've found. Otherwise, Beirut Rio. Here’s question incredibly relevant. 

Do current vaccines provide sterilizing immunity?

The answer actually No. Therefore, virus continue mutate via natural selection pressure regardless vaccination status. likely rapid rate single strand nature RNA virus allows rapid change advent multiple strains arise one individual - particularly weakened immune systems - spread quickly due aerosilized nature virus. 

To also throw water onto hopium induced vaccination - virus appears capable fit survive pretty much mammal ACE2 receptors. Good luck vaccinating way something that’s transmitted every freaking mammal planet. Joe willfully naive position power world. Wait, get $500 check deliberately saying flu COVID? Call handler immediately. That's missing point.

LeBron famous people care thinks. He's famous plays basketball really well. And, yes, makes people care thinks, talking head generated fame.

As aside, miss whole Hong Kong thing got lit for? Bc we’re kicking ass vaccine dept. /r/BillBurr leaking, loved nipped bud Rogan's show :D Damm. deadly year flu, killing 5-10 times normal rate. footnotes CDC data say tracked state residence. caught cold twice. think know common colds spread touch much though.  Joe Rogan entertaining

Was entertaining, longer is. He's lost addition original skull circumference &amp; ability mimic color tomatoes due aggressive steroid &amp; HGH fight age. NFL discovered significant evidence last year. every player wearing tracking devices, discovered players repeatedly infected, even though didn’t meet definition “close contact.” probably great stand comedian then. one satisfied kind apology even this, thought pretty funny forgiving time. People tear regardless says....sad. Yes, herd immunity thresholds based whole population. influenza early pandemic. Thought dying, horrible virus. Dr visit times home, bad state. stayed isolated room though, see kids whole time, hubby left things bedroom door me. thankfully get it. Glad hear covid preventative measures helped slow spread influenza. one hand, yay vaccine. 

On another hand, boo Dodgers. 

But another another hand, yay Mookie! That's assuming human influenza present swine, is. issue historically influenza vaccines overall pretty shit, last 15 years 10 60% effective.  Easy say now, harder rubber meets road take basic responsibility hold others standard. source vaccines reporting well. huge dump 92k April 1st (our 7 day average 10k time). I'm expecting another big catch number hit may 1st bring first second dose numbers closer again. Lesson learned.  Well actually discussion one, engineer working air layer WiFi BT ICs, quiet interesting conversation.

He trying teach known 30 years ASIC design testing various wide band, narrow band frequency hopping algorithm testing nothing compare learned 2h video YouTube guy used work NASA. wonder even prioritize shots. Wouldn’t 2nd dose administered utility using first dose, given neither person would reach adequate immunity weeks second shot anyway? comment sections podcasts absolute trash. Stopped listening long ago. current restrictions lot places would wear mask table designated area unmask. restrictions certainly relaxed point. Unknown happen vaccinated people first, making businesses check vaccination status, cases decline.

Vaccination reduces likelihood becoming infected, feeling sick infection, disease becoming serious. get trending. flu first introduced people im sure bad. Wait 50 years covid season bad. That's based early numbers Wuhan. know now. Well Yellow Card scheme place pick incidents, seems UK problem registration. 

The problem yellow card scheme, uneducated misinterpretation data.

If read drug analysis print [almost anything understand looking at, might assume drug causes death sorts mechanisms actually nothing **There 685 fatalities post AZ 14 days ago UK investigated yet, number probably closer double amount - words 1/40.000 seems correct Problem much, much worse C19 anyone 60**, deaths among healthy relatively young people. Also many life altering sideeffects like non fatal brain hemorrhages.

Because total horseshit.

We restricted use vaccine appropriate patients low-risk COVID-19 (currently 30s without health conditions, may later revised 40s case rates continue decline thus reduce risk infection).

So run quick list bullshit post:

1- No, data 14 days delayed, stop reporting 14 days ago vaccine analysis prints published every Monday. document ""26th April"" printed every page.

2- No, ""fatalities investigated yet"". Cases removed corresponding drug analysis print post investigation.

3- No, ""much, much worse C19 anyone 60"". Covid-19 also causes blood disorders, UK we've deaths under-60s age group, around 700 pre-existing conditions. estimated death rate due CVST roughly 1 death per 700,000 doses so, COVID-19 10x likely lead death age group, even pessimistic interpretation data. brutally accurate description. Hippa violation lawsuits incoming.... Ya. true, many birth control options stop cycles together (or minimize, etc) received 1 dose. people waiting time second dose. Fucking jackass. post removed article title likely sensationalized. Please use source less sensationalist title instead.

I think are, wasted doses even close 100k it'd utter disaster, reporting lagged 5 days assume 12M 80 actually used, leaves 68M collecting dust. Yes! I'm happy friends Mexico joining Pfizer gang soon!  company LA office worry. let lease lapse. WFH another year maybe permanently 🤞🤞🤞

(Two fingers swelling point bend pinkie skin looking like ball sack *vomits*)

You too.

Hopefully doc highly tuned symptoms catch anything abnormal quickly! absolutely hate sizing cards. fit traditional wallet without fold them, universal way proof vaccination stamped card. providers write information, others stamp sticker.

I get point rely honor system, given huge chunk population take vaccine, knew start, seems like oversight.  understanding mask directive get people shelter place buy time limited mask stock health care responders enough? Canada thing. masks became recommended required, people started getting comfortable close other, too. vaccinated Republican wish so. us grateful vaccine! 13 year-old child Ontario died last week bed. also need walk back supporting Trump Virus King. I've never flu. get shot years, years (got year). get COVID also even get cold winter. Vaccinated ready go back licking barstools argument got dad - he’s impression vaccine protects thinks good immune system 🙄when pushed back said science supports prevents spreading too, mumbled something depends sources look at. Sigh…  That's reality, lot vaccination sites make clear.

I went CVS mine, shots reminded multiple times bring insurance card - ""bring card it, free"", ""bring insurance card"". Now, reality, going charge anyone. broke got notice, super worried. Maybe cancel. know big group affects, think clear group exists. So.....no comments gripping hand casually tossed there. Bravo sir. tell literally wrap homes plastic stay inside forver. Haha comments friendlier sub. point, I’m sure fans Reddit People take medical advice Joe Rogan issued cyanide pill. Let's get waste everyone's time. cares - vaccinate everyone everywhere- we’re together compelling reason get shot stop development mutations. don’t stop covid asap, could left mutation (perhaps deadly) require another vaccine. Sounds like mean mainstream people believing him, maybe go get big ol' blob virus right lungs prove us wrong? sound like jackass. I’ve jobs US required vaccination (or medical exemption.) That’s get HepB series adult. wasn’t routinely given infants born. Mexico takes UK's approach, would use first doses cover many people possible even scheduling second doses since first doses offer substantial protection. that's 60 million people far less likely spread virus go hospital. walk back damn thing. Clearly really cool dude even listen content.  would take months year even longer enough vaccine impact wildfire. They’re making makeshift crematoriums parking lots. need oxygen medical supplies save many sick can. 

To clear, I’m saying don’t get vaccines. mean vaccines going little late India. won’t able vaccinate enough people fast enough. pretentious, incorrect joke hit water fell boat. maybe hero worship celebrities bad idea sure? must take lot oil slip practically every math text published last 300 years.  they’re basically UV roombas. there’s anything wrong that. DM Vegas picks lottery numbers dumb dick, hes dumb dick integrity Asymptomatic case better described pre-symptomatic lightly symptomatic. virus incredibly long incubation period many people, spread virus days symptoms. issue barely symptoms, maybe light cough morning fatigue, nothing makes think ""I sick"". roommate, coughing slightly, maybe 1-2 light bouts coughing per day, got headache 2 days later, friend said get tested covid exposed, voila, covid. symptoms? Yes, technically, nothing would made us get tested own. 

This also found military. found large majority people wrote 'asymptomatic' actually symptoms pressed it, feel relevant. Usually light cough/sore throat/fatigue might lasted day two. mention still actually know long term effects virus hanging body. Smh fuck last season want new drip 😤 supoosed moot point enough people got vaccinated  recent announcement everyone Canada able book appointment stating 4 weeks. That's big difference everyone shot 4 weeks. Competition = Amazing  Asking thigh like ordering Arby's Meat Mountain. worst happens say no.  flu years ago pure agony 4 days. Super high fever, really bad aches pain, chills vomiting. taking extra strength Tylenol often could safely even barely helped. high fever made virtually impossible sleep days. Im 30s pretty good health exercise often flu still kicked ass. think alot people realize bad flu be. 

I actually ended getting flu following year gone flu shot extremely mild. mild fever day feeling almost back normal next day. Everyone please get flu shots!!!  Michigan, they're recording vaccination state health department's immunization registry. I'd suspect company would pull record consent. sauna 10 hrs day? I’m sending positive internet stranger vibes. &lt;3 
 understand auto immune issues well. Lupus (sometimes really Lupus lol) terrified would one person freaky reaction. discussions Dr. research felt safe moving forward vaccine. hope feel better soon get answers help feel better. Better wrong ignore something potentially serious. Joe Rogan is, always been, fucking idiot. can't recognize that, got news you.  666th-ish comment Witch's Night Eve! Getting second shot week next! IIRC Air India increasing flights States India ...  anybody good friends alex jones shit head  Forever. depends lot was. 

Underlying condition could mild asthma (not shown risk factor) terminal illness (obviously risk factor, also potentially reason travel kid still alive) anything between. There's enough information say. Covid ate flu flu bad 2 years ago little bit scared. hardly ever go doctor moments wondering go hospital. want fuck covid. ""People catching covid people space fifteen minutes earlier.""

Yes, sign airborne transmission. Droplet spread liquid, often cough sneeze shoots virus-ridden saliva front landing surfaces peoples sinuses get infected. 

Airborne transmission stays air, predominantly get breathing in. someone go room exhaling virus hour, another person come inhale virus another hour get infected. Joe Rogan walking thumb midlife crisis India enough capacity manufacture own. needed materials, we’ve got way. Ready doses better sent places aren’t already huge pharmaceutical manufacturing centers. Science case would testing effect parameter efficacy. manufacturer this. 

They put shortest admissible time period fast track tests. liability measure backed genuine study effect time doses.

In meanwhile, NACI CIQ scientific orgs, stacked country's best immunity experts genuine knowledge immunization science. Data UK also really positive lengthened periods immunity. Here's article Lancet. genuine support experts science see point. humans come this. needed. reason, humanity stepping up. many behaving like pandemic over. P1 variant India terrifying.

My heart goes everyone India Nepal bracing this.  Well, classify every flu case covid sell narrative fear submission ..you flu cases 🤷  ""Their argument was, need people ... that's different argument. That's different conversation.""

Bullshit back-pedaling; good faith sort thing. always point. Snakey. variants taken hold, horrifying untreated. That's bummer, I'm sorry.

Here's hoping full panel eventually leads symptoms lessening. Yeah, know girl 26 sense smell totally returned.

Sure, 50-60, unlikely **die** COVID, death negative symptom illness one have. mean, kid terminal? locked home rest life? regarding annecdotes India's vaccinated doctors getting infected current strain...India use Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna, right? research vaccines effectiveness India's strains?

Also many countries sending vaccines India? know India makes lot, largely export understanding. I've heard total deaths 2020 change. huge spike clearly related pandemic. wrong? one respond this? (Not provoking, looking educate)  Look UK, saved thousands lives following protocol.  Indian variant already here.

Not saying ban would useless point would limited effectiveness. probably creating many multiples people infected Indian variant right would prevent travel ban.  Vaccine passports great idea international travel.

Domestically, think tied decisions certain businesses. Even possibly shut-down orders lifted business requires vaccine passport. imagining nice would open movie theaters, bars, restaurants, coffee shops, requiring masks, vax card front, get hand stamp, come enjoy socializing. barber (72 year old woman) still gotten hers.

You guess going working half hour every 3 weeks gets it. Nah, Dr Oz definitely ""supplements"" pushes. think implies shots hard get. least within America they're all. supply issue concerned demand figuring get hesitant, anti vaxxers **hesitant,** people take it. would benefit point that. I've sick 4 times since news outbreak. u think theyll get rid indoor mask mandates? Untreated meningitis kills 50% patients. 8-12% caught early memory isn’t bad year ago. always felt like people don’t understand problem is. problem virus; problem immune system reacts virus. vaccine addresses virus problem; doesn’t address immune system (over)reacts problem (since similarities reacts vaccine would react virus, albeit lesser degree). Unless find ways tweak vaccines. eventually variant booster shot might end causing immune system cause much damage virus itself. least that’s theoretically possible. I’m bit worried that... tough one. get N95 mask? Also, particular vaccine holding variant?

I would probably double mask take chances. got Pfizer vaccine happened arm sore: made sure keep moving arm/shoulder much possible hours getting idk made difference I’m huge baby pain wasn’t bad all. You’ve got this!   mean effective longer.

Either way people get sick get skip second shot thats obvious prolong it. knows prolonging meainingful obviously extent. would pass opportunity promote widespread influenza vaccination? hasn’t. flu like 2 months ago.

Wow! first I've heard this! I'm glad happening. found reading got flu shot anyways flu fucking sucks though, something easy drastically reduce risk getting it, you? it? Time pay people get shots, done start. Hate dumb show. Love line Adam Corolla way better. Wow, there’s really end sight India there? horrible.  PCR tests look Covid genetic material. JnJ AZ contain viral genetic material. Sinovac Sinopharm contain small amount genetic material, killed viruses cannot replicate, chances trigger false positive test basically zero. Laughs 4 euro/ visit  India's Bharat Biotech vaccine too. Really, worried right (only bit, breakthrough cases). worried kids cannot get vaccinated yet. love taking place. one question think yet answered, dogs catch COVID work? know dogs catch COVID, I'm wondering risk them. Anyone know? Survey UK Canada hopefully happen soon see goes Jesus. People impaired immune systems prevent normal response vaccine. says worrying despite strict lockdowns. That's pretty misleading - we're easing lockdown, shops open, restaurants pubs open outside trade, kids school while, gyms open etc. travel ban place week, rise cases kind expected. *aside* ONE TIME LAST YEAR! keep seeing comparison, sad reality he's like Oprah men true, Russia doomed people? CDC investigated issue find correlation Pfizer vaccine Myocarditis new information I'm aware of?  thought OP talking cases, deaths.

But deaths also misdiagnosed. Many people die covid never tested. Many covid flu covid chosen cause death. kind conspiracy theorist think accurately distinguishing flu covid cases deaths probably realistic. late right call. im interested much second dose 12 weeks (or 16 weeks Canada) effective compared 3 weeks normally Anyone else experienced slow recovery smell covid?

I got virus 7 months ago, couln't smell taste anything 4 days. read pretty common, people recover within months, less fortunate lose forever. could taste food felt relieved, still wan't (so smelling). 6 months now, taste strong flavors, smell something really close nose, really strong scent.

I'm curious anyone problem long time, recovered fully.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: 

I light headached covid, nothing severe. Good. hope followers walk back anti vax thoughts. It’s bad individual variants. H1N1 protection bad, yeah tanks average. would rather include could declare better efficacy? It’s one deadliest strains. even 20% reduction people get pays dividends people don’t infect people people don’t infect. One associates came back work covid. thought ""odd"" got got first shot January. never went back second. 🤦‍♀️ is. What's happening worst wave world, including Wuhan think.   5% kind meaningless really. It’s like &lt;&lt;1% walking around outside unmasked people around talking face face extended period time someone Covid positive here, stopped mountain biking big California surge winter. health insurance time either double whammy.  data know started vaccinating people back december/january, maybe still good even longer Lmao  already first shot. planning skip second. Still worried humanity.. poll seems point country road normalcy, 7 10 gotten vaccine planning two-thirds comfortable returning regular routines. public evenly split whether students attending in-person classes required vaccinated (49% support 49% oppose it). new CNN Poll conducted SSRS April 21 26 among random national sample 1,004 adults reached landlines cellphones live interviewer. Equating danger jumping balcony danger flu shot dumb. take anything wrote seriously Yeah second thoughts every time fired chainsaw turned table saw last year. remember article correlated number complaints candles number COVID-19 cases. That's true! Fake tests...flights India banned true great news. good many vaccination options possibly get entire global vaccination effort.  annoyed sat thought it. path something quickly bureaucracy. eliminating checks would done order put shot arm age (scheduling based profession, i.e. healthcare, teachers, etc done employers part) got done got done efficiently. ended really good system. KISS: keep simple stupid. come either. Saw twitter know original source. vaccines could help next wave tho Canada UK prioritise everyone getting first dose second dose (12 weeks UK, 16 week Canada) Flu animal reservoirs always around, one way another. Isn’t Covid? mention wee jab arm exactly like jumping second floor balcony.

The times life I've gotten flu shot I've felt like pure shit day two. add fact ""best guess"" variant think might possibly maybe someday potentially come way? thanks.

As today, deaths per capita bleu governor States would 158, compared red governors 163. would 157 vs 164 factor two red governors took strong precautions early blue. disparity even serious considering looking purely superficial level governor breakdown; analysis population affiliation shows even wider gap, exactly along lines one would expect.

The Supreme Court already decided compulsory vaccination 1905.  Maybe thoughts go away long term data available. Shame really liked JRE always seemed like rational guy he's another American idiot ravaged COVID nowadays. Health system collapsing. ICUs left, scrambling resources (as suspicion resources money pocketed, evidence this). Testing limited ~40% positivity rate. handle non COVID stuff.


We solid health system function normal times, pandemic. general population also obeying social distancing, making everything worse.

As far know, like million vaccine doses, 200k applied (and increasing), underway. India hope accept. Hearing oxygen availability heartbreaking. Alleged comedian.

Because quote response interview question person presumably expert immunology research article. fairly common knowledge weaker immunity general population, chance virus develop mutations escape immune response created vaccines. already known fact vaccines lower level efficacy many variants without selection pressure created them. go first? Go get infected, get entire family infected. go hospital that, let nature take course. MIS-C classification affects children far worse initial Covid infection does. I'm saying par numbers saw covid peaks. I'm saying kids affected negatively something talking about.

However there's still obvious benefits individual reach collective threshold. protected, go day peace mind, partake relatively normal social life vaccinated people, without herd immunity milestone, getting vaccinated contributed us reaching goal.

The reason it’s taking longer compile data they’re including real world data UK. None approved vaccines US done - real world shots done point approved back Nov!

It’s like saying takes longer write full thesis rather one page abstract. Duh, obviously it’s going take longer, there’s lot data included.

For record, thorough evaluation especially using real world data it. think AZ haters really check bias. FDA approval isn’t important Americans wealthy countries - sure hell important emerging markets cannot afford expensive mRNA vaccines (which profit vs AZ cost) symbolic confidence boost FDA would welcomed.

Great, bullshit, bullshit malice aforethought. 5+ *variants* identified likely transmissible and/or deadly.

There thousands mutations identified (a recent article read situation India said researchers identified 771 mutations time writing). Poland Germany really similar vaccine numbers! 21% Poland 26% Germany. you’re EU, you’re well EU countries. sick proven healthy??? Good news. Everything fine. No, quite literally caught flu Monday. Thought Covid, test came back negative. Vaccines limit spread. limit effects virus...  Yeah guy wrong. 

When ~.2% 1.5M+ flu tests positive, statistically definitively say know fact flu isn’t spreading significantly season. 

His whole “you can’t trust flu numbers” Schtick nothing opinion someone doesn’t know they’re talking about. flu literally gone extinct, like 99%. Vaccine induced herd immunity. Like measles. caught measles, you? come home infect us? stupid advice. Quarantine there, come home it’s safe. think case beer might work better. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

People always add qualifier discussion outdoors, see why. 

I'm far anti-masker, I've worn mask religiously ever since advised so, still wear one today. see still seem far removed talking removing masking requirements indoors too. Every piece science I've seen indicates vaccinated people need worry catching spreading covid environment, indoor outdoor. 

As 10 days ago, every adult country get vaccine want one.  choices adult number 3: get vaccine whatever want, get vaccine never go building again, get vaccine whatever want going catch covid.

Masks helped, one thing among many. Mostly anecdotal stories I've heard radio (NPR) reports India.

I'm trying make scientific claim trying alarm people. Sorry people may taken way. many blood clots happening suddenly getting less exercise? People getting groceries delivered learning work home. easily take less 500 steps day anywhere go. asthma catching flu could quickly become life threatening me. always get flu shots (which helps stronger immunity different variants time), flu vaccine frequently barely 50% effective individual level.

Getting flu shot every year contribute herd immunity huge help someone like me. I'm happy hear mind changed I'll thank stick it.

Yes, course. nothing US exactly model lack federal response. region state locked earlier CT (Bay Area CA), stricter health measures pretty much anywhere US since day 1, still disaster frankly. much one uh, South Dakota, something I'd call model. happened UK too. invited around 20% people wary vaccines. everyone 50 vulnerable people offered it, take 95%.

France much bigger pool wary anti-vaxers, imagine people actually offered jab, there'll similarly high uptake. I'll surprised 2m expected doses arriving Mexico coming Europe.

If US indeed exporting doses I'm sure quite covert. Masks aren’t unnecessary you’re vaccinated high risk person around high risk people. Also everything I’ve read virus makes want keep far away possible. day last year, 2500 people died coronavirus, time northeastern quarter country really even it. Yesterday, 950 people died across entire country. nothing like last year. upvoted, five times increase. Covid-19 deaths stand 760k so, I'd say pretty comparable. mRNA vaccines literally nothing DNA.

And flu new smallpox hopefully. work together can't catch smoking overweight you. come work case covid could take whole office/plant whatever weeks. Kinda blows gaping hole company profits would think.  Yeah started feeling like shit last Thursday work Saturday bad shape.

I'm sort feeling better now. first time I've ever flu whole family bed ridden never got sick. even sure got around anyone could kids maybe brought home school always thought “flu shot” thing old people. never clicked vaccine worked way vaccines regard immunity, partial immunity, helping protect vulnerable populations. know sounds dumb, literally never clicked year. got flu shot continue include 'instructions' European Union

So Covid-19 broke took well established flu pandemic protocols pushed out. ready. good news flu pandemic protocols work fucking great. 

Unfortunately dead flu. Source reeking bullshit? Every time hear someone say ""I strong immune system, I'm concerned COVID"", wish social media ""Rabies Challenge"" people purposefully get infected rabies show tough immune system is. 😑 never tested time due emergence variants mRNA J&amp;J trials can't compare trial results. 

This myth needs die.  
1. J&amp;J trial sequenced majority COVID cases US trial participants. 95%+ cases original COVID, variants. 

2. Multiple recent studies UK Israel (both countries B.1.1.7 predominant) found 90%+ efficacy Pfizer two-doses. 


So there's little reason suspect J&amp;J would gotten significant higher efficacy results tested fall, Pfizer would gotten significantly lower results they'd tested winter.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, number studies showing roughly equivalent efficacy one-dose Pfizer J&amp;J single-dose. suspicion likely correct. It’s time US treat neighbors north south like close partners been. want preface saying everyone get vaccine

If you’re around sick people aren’t wearing masks little you.

A year covid people still can’t understand works... mean literally giving shit opinion, no? care much says?

Teachers can't claim defense of, ""I'm idiot says crazy shit, would anyone listen me?"" Sure, pursuit long life quality risk management. stopped smoking, risk management. 

I could get car crash. Seatbelts become risk management. 

You can’t run virus forever, sure. actively telling people avoid vaccine could save lives asking take advantage tool manage risk. 

The guy I’m burying today, qualified vaccine state exact day. I’m fully vaccinated he’s box. really think didn’t think needed vaccine, believe vaccine. shrugged off. It’s ravaging mind thinking he’d scheduled day he’s likely alive today.


Guys like Rogan feeding thought, I’m saying we’re going lose millions 30 year olds...but...we’re going lose some. we’re officially point pandemic don’t to. current denier line flu misreported COVID.

Because else would expect? anyone gonna listen muscle headed meat ball lol tried Lion’s Mane mushrooms sense smell? nurse gave second vaccine told patients tell periods weird vaccine.

It’s foolish, prideful dangerous.  There’s mix people hate Joe Rogan. 

People actually heard understand what’s happening he’s talking casually conversational format show fast loose massive audience think that’s irresponsible unethical.

Then there’s people hear criticisms insults assume it’s worst blatant possible version happened really feverishly hate Rogan.

Theres good amount mix people hear podcasts clips shows didn’t hear fall second group it’s exciting time.

I think it’s mostly second group seeing statement thinking “walked back” stance anything. he’s always been. 

He’s repeatedly, consistently, nonstop years said he’s shooting hip smoking/drinking often times conversation. he’s bright, he’s doctor, listen him.

It doesn’t excuse everything he’s done said, needs checked called plenty, isn’t new stance even little bit.  Interesting Nice. idiot look US countries like Australia did, quickly solved problem didn’t. It’s amazing can’t put together  2 months people India screaming begging attention.

USA specific Michael Yo covid, sure heard mother died flu aged 48. Two weeks ICU run-up death. nasty disease. asked show insurance card 4 times. wouldn’t let go next section verified. alright children, everybody stop crying joe loser. sending india I’m shocked people don’t understand. It’s fine company doesn’t want require it’s EUA, that’s choice, law. 

My sister keeps saying it’s illegal hospitals give medical info. keep trying explain whether that’s true completely irrelevant, it’s illegal *you* give medical info, it’s illegal employer require give employment.

I think even religious exemption would tough get private company really didn’t want give one. I’m sure would, wouldn’t surprised private company could get away allowing even religious exemptions. employment, better worse, gives companies shitload freedom controlling employee’s lives wish exercise it. That’s three hands! Ummm no... Joe said Dan Crenshaw podcast (after laughed insane notion taxing rich), rich got rich immense disapline, hard work, decades (DECADES!) trenches. saying can't possibly true American hero Dan Bitchaarian. /s buddy (also 20s) lost smell 8 months!!! Finally starting come back still back normal. I’m sure fans Reddit

Not fans Reddit typically means you’re something right. think he’ll fine $100M Spotify deal lmfao. Hahahahahaha cultures like asian ones feel much community oriented thinking  parts Germany handing Astrazeneca vaccine everyone wants it, OP one areas, could get shot age 20 without underlying conditions definitely good efficacy, come number? one person working office, keep safe distance from? like listening discusses MMA that’s something he’s actually knowledgeable in, asides don’t really go opinions anything lol Canadian, thank thinking us. vaccines rolling well month. challenge going administering deliveries scheduled receive. countries could use boost USA more.

Come again? People know covid cough days slight loss taste/smell fine less week after. known ""very mild"" symptoms.

Bullet proff coffee, ( joe called bs). 


Mushroms clinically proven.  


Graham hancock, interesting agruments gaining evidence times pass. can't mandate vaccine fully approved FDA. I've seen spate articles recently rhinovirus thought protective effect covid outcompetes virus causes covid within body. company one? heard news JPMC begun calling employees back starting july Win win sides asile. Call vaccine / voter ID document. Verifies took shot vote. Everyone gets little win  apologise. repeated himself. anyone acting like walking back clearing air? said thing again. CDC fucked hard. 30 isn’t 16 ? idea. Why? It’s Axios. expect?  Yes, generally. guy facetious antivax. quadruple dipped year, tribe gave $25, employer gave $50 (one me, one household member) wife also got $50 (same deal, employer) got done grocery store got 10% coupon stacked anything beer cigarettes, used holiday meal shopping. Much less screwed covid19 screwed either way let friends drink drive. body, choice. happen crash tourbus full nuns puppies, it. allowed take risk. whats best joke? think case beer might work better.

People would literally start going back third, fourth, fifth, etc. shots that. rmemwber got mad Eddie Bravo called Eddie trying seem smarter everyone else wasn’t interested learning damn thing.

Now sane people Jamie then, he’s morphed Eddie, voice argument little bit better kids thinks knows he’s talking  LMAO. r/MurderedByWords Start Canada Hi folks,

are studies vaccine side-effects (even benign ones like flu-like symptoms, headaches, similar) correlating delay doses? 

I would expect correlation longer time doses less side-effects, simply body built immunity first shot immune system recovered. solid studies this? parts viruses DNA affect us way

That might due fact ""virus DNA parts"" affect humans negatively past killed humans, made unable / less likely reproduce, humans kind harmful DNA change extinct. There's natural survivorship bias comes DNA changes.  still couldn’t answer point. Look many people attend Kumbh compare Farmer’s protest.

400,000 people farmers protests 6 April 17. Today it’s April 30. Also, 5037 number among tested. doesn’t mean Kumbh entirety affect 5K people. actual number shock us tested all.

Guess what, even single source showing many people infected COVID farmers stupid? asked source link COVID cases tracker NDTV. claimed Kumbh contributed 15% total cases still iota proof same. also conveniently missed fact Kumbh’s effect shown upcoming days. doesn’t show immediately seen coming week

Math hard you? want scientific paper help divide two numbers multiplying 100?? Also COVID tracker still better ""source"" mashable lmao, we're talking pandemic, paper mache craft. Go back blogging.

((1217952(all time cases UP) + 810955(all time cases WB)) / 18762976(total cases till India)) * 100 = buzz fake BJP propaganda come back proper sources back shit, kid.

I SOURCES!? Lmao ignored guys' sources. Here, let post again, please go chronological order. Answer post first, Joe Rogan tool.   It’s probably people forced wash hands, check temperatures, wear masks, distance others. Idk tho.. Okay, so, he's wrong, stopped listening him. went spotify he's completely life basically. used interesting guests occasionally, but, I'm honestly listening guy claims Ayahuasca, one potent psychedelics, god told sell supplements... one called 'Alphabrain'. stand comic something think supposed satire. Oh wait... he's stand he's serious. Guess he's idiot. rich idiot. tracking pays it.

Is though? vaccine appointment website state asks Insurer Policy Number they're optional fields. insurance card handy left blank. actual vaccine site one asked information checking anyone's insurance cards. doubt even getting tracked, even vast majority people leaving blank. Apparently issue resorts, well things frowned upon illegal bathing bikini, alcohol, etc. Mods, think conversation sub allow far political discourse goes valid. You’re censoring outmoded. Says guy believe title remotely true, 36/m/cali - got AIM myspace? I’m starting feel I’m person listen someone enjoy content whilst simultaneously recognising agree quite lot man said, yes, platform, people also agency, people make minds you’re going “influenced” Rogan would assume you’re weak minded individual would’ve “influenced” someone much worse anyway Still way round, ( 99%) would got downvoted told annecdotal useless. 


Enjoy retrarded echo chamber  75 million fully vaccinated people US, 270 people subsequently hospitalized due rona 74 died it. That's 1 million.

That statistics works. also reminded everyone hes doctor comedian Yeah thinking well...  Yes Line thought it’s going tested. It’s law anywhere block use requiring vaccination public private schools. There’s couple cases easily distinguished situation Wait children dying virus? seems bad Dude covid fucking wild.

Im also 30, disabled stepson caught school. cough, fever, sore throat days.

I quarantine take care would miracle catch him.

The thing noticed eyes hurt like 2 days.

Just fact wildly different symptoms different people make scary. They're starting? Wtf  Alex Jones national treasure mean fair bad Spanish flu. Spanish flu killed four times many people per thousand Covid has. say C19 nasty disease is. 33 years old, healthy-ish though I’m probably pre-diabetic imagine due cokes. lost senses two three weeks. It’s different everybody. Pfizer’s trials calculated efficacy one week post shot #2 go trials fully immunization conspiracy theorist back day? point much? would recommend whatever would normal flu season. vaccines, Covid much worse flu, vaccines, comparable. Sometimes people get hospitalized die flu, people concerned, unless risk factors live people do.  got number twitter thread look it, says either 98 92 percent. cases, good  That’s it, approved speech comrades anti leftist science conspiracies? think adapt post covid life similar prisoners adapt life outside sentence up. Well us mostly complied restrictions least. can’t expect instantly go back lived like year. need day release! 

I’ve vaccine dose month now; I’m awash antibodies; get exposed handle it. I’m still getting used able see people pub (well freezing beer garden least). know it’s legal I’m vaccinated it’s nice see folk again, still feels slightly vague reasons can’t put finger on. year zoom calls you! Noo nooo nooo.. point stop individual become bearer morality?! fuckkng moron like eye. interesting conversations. idiot idiot. Slippery slope Permanent damage longues confirmed patients ages. Joe care that. Fellow NJ here, time claim justifiable reason live regard whatsoever. Seriously though sis law would get creeped many times gas stations California. eventually got Tesla sole purpose never go shadey gas station again.    Wish he’d walk back whatever cesspool produced too. primarily hosting alt right conspiracy theorists lately. platform, especially Alex Jones. I’m anti vax promise even though sounds like am, surely surely see irony comment I'm sure families 3,80,000 dead people understand. Btw number official figures. Couple experts pegged much much higher. last weeks Delhi missing 1000 peoples' death.  Great idea tie restrictions % vaccinated, hopefully encourage hesitant can’t-be-bothered Sounds like made good decision got virus. Normal person reading : 'Whoa that's awful - hope ok - scary lose sense like rest horibble too'

Anti Vax idiot reading : 'So what, survived, fore rest suffering irrelevant'

Anti vaxxers scum earth. Absolutely surprise see Alt Right recruitment officer chief Joe Rogan one. US approved AZ, seems unlikely happen there’s zero demand. issue Joe Rogan, always Joe, he's intelligent ENOUGH know he's sided bullshit. often change mind based science, opposed continuing lean emotional macho biases. first says dumbest thing. excuses saying ""no one"" listen him. do, Joe. care retract said. care time said dumb thing wanted hear. STILL said thinks young people NEED get it. That's exactly walking back, that's retreating slightly.  would vaccine lol, that’s point dummy There’s big difference listening scientists consistently found vaccines create strong immune response variants. 

I understand keeping track variants, don’t see it’s helpful keep freaking something could maybe, possibly happen highly effective vaccines proven time time work well. second pfizer Wednesday.

I annoying headache,a fever, slightly achy legs(that might bed day) loss appetite. 

Forced eat yesterday 6pm could eat half.

I feel fine headache minor morning took tylenol gone now.

I'm happy. past year ive felt much anxiety even tho I'm young family hypertension idk it. anxiety family etc.

I'm happy breath sigh relief now.  “Why anyone taking medical advice Bull Gates? “   title still click bait. going rogan anyways. He’s always said he’s moron. He’s drunk high talkin shit love Joe Rogan Joe Rogan dick. Someone said men's version Gwyneth Paltrow. better description.

For guy works UFC seen fighters, prime athletes get ko'd (Cody Garbrandt, Khamzat Chimaev) genuinely comes across thick individual. classification mildly symptomatic means require hospitalization lifesaving medical intervention. important people understand discussions cases particular group “mild” people made understand mild case permanently disable you. No, body would still mount defense both, defense triggered vaccine efficient defense triggered virus (because vaccine target weakest part virus, spike protein) types defense work.

We give vaccines post exposure diseases like rabies polio, work really well disease long incubation periods easy vaccine out-race them. Covid trickier take week body mount immune defense vaccine, infection incubation period shorter that, vaccine probably anything. incubation period long, vaccine good chance helping reduce symptoms severity. Ah, ol’ “I’m moron” “no one listen me” defense. Alex Jones got head. know handful states offering money get vaccine (which great) wish Biden administration would plan miniature fourth stimulus vaccinated people qualify for. Maybe something like $500 fully vaccinated person. IMO would virtually guarantee get enough stragglers vaccinated get us herd immunity. 

It's important thing get many people vaccinated possible, feel like pulling stops. can't see majority population getting vaccinated without compensation due disinformation.  keep walking. You’re right, didn’t know now. Thanks info. he? morons listening him, words Covid effects everyone differently. got minor fever day completely fine after. I'd like note though take vitamins regularly workout twice almost every day I'm pretty active. severity symptoms placebo aswell, believe going sick odds going sick. FBI stop this? Like, already federal crime forge documents official federal government seal it, would take minimal effort make bunch honeypot sites, amount time, arrest everyone bought fake card. mean, listen podcast it’s good entertainment find guests interesting.

You’d moron take medical advice Joe Rogan. That’s entirely fault. COVID side effects thing, even mild case. Uh... 99.98% is. I’ll take odds anything anyday  100pct correct however. one?

That’s idiotic. could say plague everyone would end dead mid-last week, travellers India permitted travel Seychelles proof COVID-19 seen practicality enforcing difficult. Getting vaccine difficult verifying vaccination certificate also difficult. discussion held, putting India category Brazil. means vaccinated allowed country. revised travel advisory released tomorrow,"" said Gedeon. Sure, young healthy people don’t need Medicare health/ dental/ life insurance either eh? 

Just super dumb, aligned overall public health aspect vaccines offer really dumb way look preventative care.

And also don’t know long term impacts virus it’s straight irresponsible dismiss risk population group really.  lol same, nearly decade me. honestly miss sneezing  anger Modi led front, campaigning state elections allowing religious festival - pandemic raging. time fury absolute haunt prime minister. housefire breaks spreads houses neighbourhoods. occupants original house blame people pulling houses fight fire? I’m sure propaganda you’re referring Joe disagree plenty. lands really big names guests show. It’s healthy diet likely that’s causing =( “3.8 lakh” mean?  IANAD, understand vaccine works providing immune system certain “blueprints” fight virus. Kind like get chickenpox young age immune system remembers fight likely fight future infections. People use “chickenpox parties” give child disease order prevent worse infection later age, vaccines safer alternative. 

The point stop virus vaccinations people’s immune system fight virus preventing copying mutating another strand virus inside host. stop virus copy mix strands bodies prevent mutation process. suggest Bill Burr pandemic over.  People long covid symptoms chance taking vaccine got symptoms cleared don’t think is. seems like might taking shitty take vaccine sign research guests. We’re comparing apples dog turds. weird thing is, CVS COVID appointments booked state California I’m typing this.

I may never stop wearing masks. take advice entertainer ? Particularly smell majority consider taste. tongue pretty much distinguish sour, salty, bitter, sweet, rest smell. Don’t believe me? blind taste test similarly textured items nose pinched. class took raw potato apple bunch people couldn’t tell difference. Loss smell far greatest fear covid. mean death, obviously, odds quite low. Another fun fact: smell huge libido. People lose sense smell often report greatly diminished libidos general lack interest sex. like fucking, like eating, fuck risking loss olfaction complain Spotify moron? Yeah young kid probably would fine getting chicken pox killed couple hundred people year US. half million. guess what? kids started getting vaccine pretty rare hear anyone getting it.

I simultaneously pissed people take medical advice celebrities like Joe Rogan.

That’s two things pissed about... hey, pissed third thing - people don’t understand it’s possible pissed one thing. It’s okay guys! [According athletes get infected they’ll prioritised hospitalised Japanese people, even though don’t enough rooms us! Yay!!! better walked back...he right! а ? Что ? Кто искал Русских редиторов ? добро пожаловать на r/pikabu ))) там нас 170к Hmm, nice hopefully share experience bad covid? talking coworkers. partner slowly resumed normal activities hearing fully vaxxed people getting really sick covid worries me. Even right healthy people didn’t get sick it, still give someone compromised immune system. selfish, short sighted attitude I’ve ever heard. Fuck Joe Rogen. People need stop supporting him. He’s bad world. Shots given. Antibody protection impossible measure records it, scientific projection estimates. Eh, yeah. really partly frustration, partly anger, general confusion people still traveling around global pandemic. would hope things handled remotely, conference calls, video calls, work done digitally. Actually, incorrect. ""she"" works CIUSSS charge determining gap doses. advocating shorter interval. provincial government charge sticking 4 month gap. Boats? Seriously? I'm sorry misunderstand mean, saying native born Indians traveling back India care family?

No. shouldn’t give opinion audience wide. neither uncle Facebook matter. Honestly Internet taking society shit many people opinions stuff know nothing about. wish people could control yes. Heard accounts people managing get serious cases covid despite fully vaccinated. concerned this? enough concern partner shouldn’t go eat maskless gatherings something accept move on? people listen bozo? America wasn’t much better months ago, denial stands strong even presented evidence. People died Covid believing it’s hoax. Paying people get vaccine terrible fucking precedent set. 

It inherently implies sort legitimate reason get vaccine...it fuel people's belief there's sort danger it. 

We need pay anyone get smallpox vaccine wipe face earth. Yeah, son compromised immune system. Joe Rogen fuck himself.

Even did, I'm okay surveillance state attitude ""just get it"" disgusting would forefathers rolling. love fact Mum trying responsible beyond required legally.  please look motel, cabin, rental house caravan park style accommodation rather hotel.

Australia many cases transmission within hotel system.  Multiple cases spread adjacent rooms. There’s lot pressure give hotels start freestanding cabins. enclosed shared spaces (like hallways) makes big difference. wants make “compelling” could pick topics aren’t pandemic could bring experts conversations debates like every responsible podcast covers topic. would compelling listening bros bullshit way epidemiology. U.S. citizens living India? could work remotely?  It’s sickening discussion. should’ve common knowledge pandemic lonf

Trump call March 7th “it’s air, bob.” governments known along strings people along keep peave  mean pandemic over, flu current infections it'll take long time, maybe years, become prevalent again? expect see spike right back like every year.

Keep mind flu plenty reservoirs animals like birds pigs jumps humans. flu probably still jumping humans regular basis proximity livestock humans developing nations, simply go anywhere COVID precautions. COVID precautions completely lifted suspect normal flu season would follow. it’s podcast... it’s job educate public all. hate standard disclaimer. stinks. worst bit know actually thinks he's super fucking smart. guy somehow experienced CTE proximity. mention weed mushed brain. restrict citizens movements inside country state can’t refuse entry, otherwise you’re legally leaving stateless violation Article 1 1954 Convention relating Status Stateless Persons.

If UN simply issues person diplomatic passport gain entry way.

This happens lot refugees occur first world too. cares it’s podcast matter people 2021 hits someone love. Humans really suck, yeah hot take, whatever, think us deserve this. That's comparing Israel numbers US numbers adjusted, current US numbers now. Re-read parent comments. would take anything related tobacco &amp; covid grain salt: absolutely bro post. You’re welcome fact check every single statement. Here’s start based simple google search. made sure use summarized, aka dumbed news articles, instead scientific papers written information directly CDC.

Sterilizing immunity airborne aerial It’s impossible deny this. Arguably fault government stockpiling masks like many countries did, forcing Fauci lie could ration. whatever he’s government official, government represents fucked really bad deserve scorn opinion. Shermer isn’t Egyptologist, he?  Sounds like supreme court material here. Here’s one article. listening unbiased science podcast go lot stuff well. work Denmark statistician public sector. means ""bashing"" anything. 100% pro vaccine. said contries either banned restricted AZ vaccine 55+, small exceptions.

In countries multi-source vaccines large supplies different ones yes done that. countries that's case lead massively larger number deaths. AZ vaccines lifesaving populations regardless age. case better taking option different one. Absent choice AZ vaccines needs given everyone. 

Canada's AZ vaccination continues allowed everyone 18 over, used people 30 far likely used even younger people alternate vaccine supply available. data overwhelmingly supports vaccination ages 18 vaccine. first Personal physiology factor literally illness. TL;DR 

ADE previous infection makes subsequent infections dangerous. dengue fever infection accelerated presence antibodies (which derailed vaxxine efforts past data multiple SARS-CoV-1 MERS-CoV vaccine efforts failed due ADE animal models (75, 81), reasonable hypothesize similar ADE risk SARS-CoV-2 antibodies vaccines.

So paper 24th February. Would know vaccines counterproductive? seem working rather well US, UK, Israel. Also look leronlimab. Longhauler treatment currently testing. NYT tracker breaks country (where data). I'm Australian knowledge Florida's geography limited, looks like panhandle really low rates. would immoral. Still irresponsible. EU citizenship haven’t left US. No, I'm watching people die others shrug off. 

What's difference? There's X factor. Bullshit journalism sorry. MonsterTalk skeptic science podcast digs pseudo-science crytozoology hoaxes. top field representatives scientists come help explain discuss topics. Hardcore History literally talks shit happened already. podcasts compelling Joe Rogan ever been. know sarcasm tag good take people like hold platforms disseminate lies guise ""just honest"" detrimental us all. maybe lot COVID cases regular flu cases misdiagnosed? Serious request...

Can please link research says vaccine prevents spreading Covid? ask government (Australia) still wants restrict travel impose quarantine vaccinated. I’ve similar case too. 8 months later smell taste COVID I’m almost 18 amazing guests sometimes. love episodes scientists. Special mention: Brian Cox. acts interested episodes think maybe he's complete meathead. alas, I'm wrong You’d think education would improve quality work puts out, least make coherent. nope, it’s straight garbage vomit jungian pseudoscience sprinkled vague white nationalist dog whistles incoherent babbling “postmodern neomarxism” philosopher social scientist coherent label one find jar alphabet soup. Oh, bad faith reactionary interpretations trans rights law literally person summary understanding would tell utter nonsense. Makes sense. Clearly talking previously healthy catching COVID. pedant. Every person I’ve heard say barely spell immune system lol, much less explain works intricacies specifically. 

Ask break specifically ribosomal level. “Well digest Taco Bell!” Morons. Masks help mitigating allergies. I’m going wear one gusty days, etc. First second shots gave sore arm Pfizer. Hoping goes well also wrong misguided. huge messaging issues specifically Perfectly healthy people die, they?

I know dozen got Covid coughed couple days.

Do perfectly healthy people get hit cars?

Do perfectly healthy people get cancer? heard even wear mask shower, naps found Fox News Youtube channel zero coverage going India. anyone know Fox News covering going India TV? 
The lack international coverage really contributes ignorance rural suburban united states.   Cake smell everyday bad Passing anxiety point. take around 2 months believe situation normalise bit. think globally current effort vaccines mitigation; reduce number deaths rather slow spread. lot governments advise vaccinated people gather, unmask etc. still considered vulnerable people still bit unclarity vaccinated people contagious mechanisms propose long lasting effects vaccine occur? No. Ugh get I've sinus infections, nice. start getting worse infection ramps I'll sniffing whole house trying find source smell but, yeah inside sinus. found especially difficult get normal sinus infection treated year everyone immediately assumed covid, time swab results back infection feeling pretty shit. That's even saying though. least getting vaccine scared might reproductive system discernible connection reality, taking medication body unwanted effects general idea. saying people scared NEAR person vaccinated, going reproductive system. FUCK, people might shed vaccine material, affecting people around though secondhand smoke.

SHEDDING ""VACCINE MATERIAL"" LOL Must Orange County issue— substantially improved past week so.

Edit: spelling  compelling seeing Trump, Cruz McConnell waddle worthless asses front line get it. couldn’t get shots fast enough, know. gets it. He’d rather take money responsibility. wonder infection rate, sheer number people getting infected once, may drive mutation make slower mutation rate. Please, please report whoever listen. Report local health department. Report corporate office chain. Hell, report local media (news station, newspaper — it’s easy reach reporters Twitter sometimes find email outlet’s websites). beyond unethical, needs repercussions sooner rather later. Zero? at? see everyday LA. Made appointments 5 family members. within week date looked. I'm midst fourth fifth cold since covid started, believe flu gone. Yeah olfactory cortex closely intimately connected memory centers, including place ones. experience particular smell childhood teleporting us back nostalgic place. it’s detergent cousins’ laundry room/game room, we’d stay playing command conquer war craft. 

Olfaction also smell bypasses thalamus, shuts sensory input sleep part. means bad smells wake pretty easily (good house fire) also they’ve used smells issued training readministered sleep evoke memories training dreaming enhance learning sleep. Crazy shit.

Edit: source last bit  knows he’s doing. doesn’t care long money keeps rolling in. Yeah understand it’s early pretty much monitoring anything unless progresses.  suggesting Bill Gates doctor? definitely scare you, people wanting there's vaccine risk higher efficacy Har label anything besides influencer reality TV personality...

Would listen Kim Kardashian's medical advice ? here! thought one!! Eh, east really innocent either. Look India. That's exactly view too. actually lost year life. never had/could work/learn home whole life created mindset home place ""not work"". year really struggled, academically workforce. save lives. 

And government wants say ""well f we'll let everyone else stuff still wait 10 week (and that's best case scenario) fully vaccinated. 

The government year prepare create concepts semi normal life corona times, everything use lockdowns kind light switch. Uhh... what? No, no. He’s always full crap. It’s better picking misinformation parrot viewers ignorant identify misinformation. episodes discusses trans people like example. straight garbage whole way through. Definitely joke. Glad survived, though. That’s worst part. thinks argument towards better option reality it’s anti-vaxx stance alternative. Rogan access intelligent people planet chooses one-eyed grifters navy seals supported insurrection. honesty, point really discussing anymore, he’s Alex Jones without spine. goes must come down: every country that's massive spike cases like significant decline along after. Generally, steeper increase cases, steeper decline.

The reasons could partial herd immunity, political action driven panic, population becoming terrified go outside. Sometimes may combination three. ""I'm comedian, journalists"" 

HE NEVER SAID HE'S **JUST** COMEDIAN.

He explicitly says accept responsibly fact big megaphone. Yeah everyone points low death rate young people don’t talk possible long term organ damage. There’s also fact vaccines aren’t 100% effective everyone everyone get need many people possible get protect vulnerable 95% protected become unlucky 5%. Malta passed 20% population fully vaccinated. first shot scheduled Monday morning. pretty much UK? data strongly supports strategy almost negligible numbers cases deaths. People seek media agrees them. Yall bunch cry babies. show say wants. past... year? amazing.  Yes! He’s basically saying “I’m healthy. Fuck everyone else!” doesn’t give shit people syndrome million conditions cause compromised immune systems. doesn’t care gets sick. flu segmented genome RNA virus error correction enzymes lots intermixing animal resovoirs. means mutate distributed fashion inter intra species. flu mutates fast. 

Covid this, overall mutation rate much slower FLU. Mutants still possible course, think we'll see yearly shots forever like influenza. conceivable we'd able eliminate covid forever, require high vaccination rates worldwide. Stamped like China? China let virus escape world  State database mean died. Sorry, bad wording part. ever heard Khazmat Chimaev? fyi mexico is, technically speaking, americas important trade partner, even beating china &amp; canada. mexico represents 14.9% american trade, china 14.7% canada 14.3%. comparison, next country japan 4.7%

from suggesting ignorant millions doctors earth unanimously urging everyone get vaccinated?

Because spectacularly stupid thing say. It’s sad treat people like children order convince get vaccinated mumbled something depends sources look at.

Your dad's completely right valid sources information completely disagree him. So, yeah, depends source. Asia long time! Yeah wife works gas station would get cold like 6-8 times year carried home, she'd get later, havent cold since started, nice. He’s spreading sort garbage years. hasn’t obvious now. 

I’m sorry anyone filled heads crap probably don’t even realize common sort misinformation always show.

Anything anyone show ever told trans people show something fully delete mind forever, example. bad, point COVID unlikely go away quash current pandemic. likely going enter pool viruses deal regular basis. Charged what? kid caught home. dying regardless. get vaccine, contract COVID say day before, injection (aka pre-symptomatic), could worsen situation (as opposed fighting infection itself, short term perspective)? 

My understanding body basically fighting something looks like virus actual virus simultaneously - aka akin spending resources could otherwise fighting real infection? That's awesome! took year get even small amount improvement. Since can't seem get levels right starting fuck body. see somewhere prior SARS-CoV-2 pandemic vaccine developers working ways target stark flu spike proteins generally regardless strain whereas tip spike protein may vary greatly strains. one day may universal (or close it) flu vaccine. saying yesterday boss talking French Canadian ancestry new england pretty much part Canada falls within US borders (most people around either French last names French Canadian mother's side) Seriously. He’s always saying this. taking medical advice stream consciousness mumbling that’s you. don’t understand point you’re trying make. People get sick people. sure birth anything  don’t know you’ve reading, literally CDC guidance fully vaccinated people wear masks situations you’re around large number people. 

No one actually paying attention going refuse vaccine that, especially alternative keep wearing mask distancing probably another year.  Joe idiot. Harsh lockdowns? never happen   trying funny, dick. 30 going get mean It'll go - university sent notification email vaccines required yesterday. think delay organizing students access home could get vaccinated campus school starts. also believed Chris Cuomo curling shoulder pressing 100lb. dumbbell obviously gag video, Joe like ""Yeah Italians naturally strong fuck. That's real""  friends parents let vaccine ""it's FDA Approved."" expect get FDA Approved nobody uses it?
I got first vaccination recently I'm hopefully getting second Mother's Day. I'm looking forward hope friends get vaccinated too.  think incidence rates converge time. can’t see difference vaccines significant enough warrant large difference incidence blood clotting problems. good thing J&amp;J second dose therefore risk possible causes rise antibodies re-exposure virus.

This would seem likely explanation. I’m starting think Joe Rogan might another idiot microphone.  obviously 1 person office/client must keep safe distance wear mask fully vaccinated send people work office. Pretty clear, least me, no? There's also lot scientists recommending things like continued masking g fully vaccinated, conveniently dont want listen sure we’ll see end Covid soon due variants lack vaccines globally. mention hospitals stood make much money patients they’re diagnosed Oof 🤦‍♂️ reason bad public relations AstraZeneca Oxford completely tone deaf. Harem* won’t lol everybody yet longest time Joe Rogan thought moon landings hoaxes? hate forward, hope see day Headlines say ""Joe Rogan died"". day kickback drink, invite pizza, dance heart out. 

This idiot weak podcast done much harm humanity. want listen him, fine, medical experience, experience cases look forward dreadful podcast replaced another person. Hopefully someone support racists, rich idiots voices medical opinions endangers lot people.

Edit; headline seems wrong.

I stand statement, Joe Rogan deserves platform. true Indian variant resistant current vaccines

No. don’t wear outside anymore. lot people choosing so, longer required Ny recommended cdc  feel awful kids, really affected screaming look nephew, protect brother died. heartbreaking.   think early, know hospitalization rates age group month they've vaccinated. Woah went 18+ already?? Despite everything going on, organized system place rather “it’s open good luck everyone bye!”

Also I’m really sorry hear family, really hope get vaccinated soon. Oh, used 85% vaccination rate adults rather 60% complete population calculations. guess makes sense, provided adults tested B.1.617. non-adults tested well, however, slightly misleading.

But matter two vaccination rates use, calculations still show 90%+ efficacy.  clue talking pal. Joe Rogan piece shit. employer sue bring COVID work? past year also raised awareness high filtration masks (KF94 KN95) pretty easy get now.

/r/Masks4All win. Great contribution. That's great! Come - know New Hampshire vastly superior mountains Vermont. Canadians love White Mountains. listens idiot medical advice athletes


[Mo That's fair, someone audience millions, think careful potentially harmful things say? something relatively small like ""heat shock proteins heal everything"", literally life death.

The flu *less* problem, still much us. Yeah, kidding. JRE responsible huge amount positive change life, stop listening together back March last year went nuts. It’s sad thing, man. appointment slots available (the schedule based age, year birth):

I’m say we’re completely rational able meet people inside you’re vaccinated draconian. America maybe 20% people actually followed types recommendations T. people still met w close friends family could trust fucking idiot spare time. anyone explain news. Colleges already require bunch vaccines, long remember. got J J problems I’m pissed others can’t.  least US, really think will. think lot people mentally adapted pandemic life past year change, reality level decline socialization unprecedented virtually everyone alive today. Even WW2, society still able go school, drink bars, etc. Thus, think lot people even realize extent going want get things pandemic hits truly non-threatening levels next month so. top this, U.S. personal savings rates historically high levels due pandemic's impact consumption fiscal stimulus efforts. Buckle folks! true Indian variant resistant current vaccines? mistaken? You’re getting downvoted you’re conflating mainstream media reporting scientific data. top you’re framing sort “inconvenient truth” really condescending tone. you’re saying irrefutable evidence people don’t want hear, you’re obnoxiously speculating parroting MSM talking points. We've officially opened vaccinations 40's today. ones younger already vaccine generally health workers young people underlying conditions. AZ vaccine affect young people sample size much smaller rest vaccinated population concerning.

I fully expect AZ banned (or rather, substituted possible) 40's prior rollout. health questions? Maybr directed healthcare professional instead. Tbf, hesitancy wall approaching already 63% infuriating frankly mental. shit's get real vax refusing idiots. 

There lawsuits. 

*freedoms*  finally chance wearing mask, stopping facial recognition, effectively anonymous. What? vast majority people wont die car crash even though drive everyday.

But dont go telling ""Dont wear seatbelts, fine""  still risk vaccinated people. might small DC CDC Disease *Control*, Disease Collaboration.

So call perfomative ask people mask large crowds high risk scenarios disingenuous. History doesn’t repeat rhymes listen first hand experience nba players ""this guy said so"" listening BBC Newshour podcast earlier week interviewing doctor India situation casual mentioned covid vaccinated still admitted hospital week. Obviously sample size one notable me.

I mean, obviously hanging around treating Covid patients day, risk catching Covid higher someone living life place like US 50% adults vaccinated. 

This people mean say freaking out. ignored context even acknowledged sample size ONE, yet still moved forward idea *this bad, bad news*. No, that's reflected utter FRUSTRATION anger see r/India subreddit right now. many ways clear see handled better one top seems give shit, even now. buddy athletic scholarship college.

Early 2020 got way mouthy started listening less. Matt yglesias one fave pundits late 2020 didn’t even give 5 minutes defend new books thesis busy soap box. Havnt listened since. he’s saying vaccine doesn’t work still wear masks social distance. That’s really hurting vaccination efforts. ~40% Canadians shot May 1. enough coming cover ~35% Canadians May.

Almost everyone wants shot get one next *5* weeks (better?) Nah dude. It’s opinion, one respond criticise opinion ever. That’s opinions work brah. Sorry don’t make rules around here, comment brought motherfucking cash app use buy alpha brain totally aren’t bullshit caffeine pills FDA approval.

Masks pussies. Rogan out! people don’t seem understand it’s sick sucks covid. Even though course. It’s long term lung damage. person know ended diabetic getting organs became inflamed. It’s “shitty flu” literally scars body. listen medical professionals years experience decide fate based musings person. Get vaccinated. It’s way out.   He’s kind looking weird prism , usual. First all, though it’s sort weird experimental thing dreamed mad scientist, secondly inherent risk, third vaccines new... remember freaking “Some schools going require vaccines?!?!?!?”, yes shit, Joseph, case since 1950s. order go schools need regular/typical inoculations. like play card “I’m expert, I’m comedian”, however find hard believe doesn’t realize huge group people there, mostly idiots, take podcast chapter verse. encounter far many people real life non-ironically cite JRE source good information. …watermelon sugar right course, may ask why? point vaccines continue spread keep dropping, necessary. Canada #1 importer US goods.  Trump wrong excuse self appointed experts telling abject lies. Trump, President, wasnt charge country.

The thing president charge military, little power domestic matters. country is, least be, ran citizens. Misleading title smfh also idea there’s anything long term come getting vaccine would worse. Frankly, many comments post stink Covid-19 science denialism. Blaming evolving recommendations scientific community pandemic asinine. willfully neglecting reasoning behind early recommendations support blame war either ignorance, misinformation. Personally don’t understand downvoted tend agree vaccines distributed first foremost vulnerable frontline workers.. hey maybe that’s come place isn’t readily available.  Cause actually reduce liklihood infection, mean smallpox magically go away. still spread people, idea long term effects heart, lungs, neurological system. ain't run mill cold, shit hits vitals leaves mark.   condition unemployment public benefits getting jabs. private employer mandates cover many people. There’s easier solution: official seal like dollar bills that’s shown light You’d figure they’d keep kind information govt system, shitty piece paper..

[In-Depth: full FDA approval would impact vaccine mandates, competition Joe Rogan's podcast really cool thing...

No wasn't. you’re vaccinated travel safe per CDC. Still masks such, it’s fine Hygiene hypothesis auto immune diseases allergies make sense. think pure alcohol makes difference like antibiotics mutate bacteria, dont know.  enough doses vaccine, due neglect incompetence due uncertain nature making vaccine, fair every country nation. AZ done that, every country got many vaccines ordered. yet see anyone else gall threaten sue vaccine manufacturer middle pandemic? cut EU replaced Trump, everyone would outraged irresponsible conduct. clue you’ve downvoted. Even CDC says domestic travel ok. Don’t dick  Gross. authoritarianism showing.  Make n95 mask blue surgical ones protect others you. one else wearing one you’re still risk before. case. Developing countries need access vaccines. wonder anti-mask anti-vax president charge country then? swallow pride get shots help get state back situation get hired someone bad actor. I’m talking trump  work home wear masks. 5 year old source. Agreed pfizer contract said export u.s. like april Joe Rogan full Idiot. know people still listen him...  Somehow think must Fox News talking point I've heard garbage repeated too.  totally free. They're supposed get reimbursed federal government harass uninsured people leave. Omg NEED uninsured people vaccinated keep hospital!

Edit: report alternatively, viruses responsible evolution life earth.

Rabbit hole Wow, keep proving useless tool are. Today Learned colds flu thing Depending type company work for, shit care long warm body shows performs job. PPE make product shipped out. 

With many people work money loving streets kids going hungry.  Yah wise do.  work thousand people since last June stopped yet.  Requires mask well say distance impossible.  Bout 2 3 hundred going exit one time.  others entering.  people got covid. Probably less 50 people actually claimed get 2 weeks paid nothing.  Knew that. 
A fair amount people claim they're getting it. wanna wait say whatever reason give.  Temp checks enter, thermal deal wall. Kinda cool actually must say.  However want people show up, perform job nothings going course mask ect.  actually say team work reality going well care anyone speaks long job done good quality.

So I'd say depends type job. article total click bait criticized christianity, often involves criticism old testament, includes torah. Also, 20 million jews whole world (if count least one jewish parent), criticizing judaism really priority. Yes believe too. wonder happen second doses 30 well second dose signals continue rise well. Worrying. probably part bought another 60m Pfizer. another rich guy talking idea about.

Please explain, detail - sources - understand clearly Bill Gates not. n95 mask protect wearer though, least that’s understanding. Idaho worse Mississippi? know bad dang... serious mean allowing presently illegal hippa, yes would say serious. I'm sorry loss. lot info vaccine. Every platform triying cram throats. let joe rogan sway decision anything ain’t right. audience easily influenced, impressionable men take says gospel? crazy defensive people getting comment opinion really matter 😕

It's opinion, matter?  agree! playing extra precaution planning seeing people weekend aren’t completely vaccinated. thanks reassurance!   survive long term think. Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax (given production), J&amp;J win longer term.

It's good stop gap get pandemic supress future can't imagine anyone, even UK, signing deal doses boosters/variants due supply woes, increasing safety signals lower efficacy rates mention vector immunity. think people missing point misrepresenting meant. People accusing anti vax he’s saying isn’t.

Look Joe rogan fucking idiot parrots whoever thinks last smartest guest said wasn’t really anti vax, stupid was. states young people shouldn’t get vax, doesn’t believe works don’t need it. He’s objectively wrong that’s anti vax Fine, go ahead keep monkey secrets. listen him. Seems ~~like interesting guy, but~~ arrogant.

Fixed “not caring” Rogan, sound like sure care lot lol   Yeah! live Ontario announced shipments coming may enough open mass vaccination everyone 18 end month. news waiting for.

Our provincial government screwing everything response, seems like finally good news.

Also, getting lot more, means rest Canada getting that, play Mrs. Lincoln? surprised levels anxiety covid-19 produced people. Behaviours definitely changed, greet one another take hygiene seriously. lot mental health issues yet surface pandemic. human race dealt normal-changing event like since 1st 2nd World Wars 1918 influenza pandemic. Behaviour something comes on-off switch, adaptation takes time correction.  also says ""I'm doctor, I'm morron""... problem Joe, government Trump administration said ""neaah we're going listen science know""... rednecks take info brainwashed media.. matter age, take vaccine bois, COVID creates long term harm lungs brain.  Im sure personally added lot society, fuckin dweeb Honest question here: aren’t natural covid antibodies counted herd immunity measurements? article sub last week natural antibodies infection good better vaccine. huge number asymptomatic cases, shouldn’t much much closer herd immunity?


The definition herd immunity decades vaccinated, addition it’s stated SARS 1 antibodies protected years thinking SARS 2 similar. seems like basic point talked never is. strange me.  Yes true. North Conway tourist season makes LA traffic look like breeze. still let flights China even though said wasnt even listened JRE podcasts 3 hours long, think talked pandemic? Also, expect fear factor guy people responsible investigating coronavirus? yourself? Perhaps. 

Maybe data prove otherwise? would bet many people, particularly story got covered news outlets shared widely social media, never really went donated zoo begin with. literally gonna say sounds Trump-ish 🤣. bunch dumb shit like WHOA WHOAA... said expert?! Unfortunately idiot still get grandma sick Covid, like not, matters says. BS move pull. retractions never get circulated way original comments, post, etc. will. say things increase audience appease current base means $$ pocket. could give crap damage inflicting others means $$ them. Maines beaches 4.5 hours away car Montreal Politicians rarely good crisis leaders disasters. focused business usual next election. gets big trouble gloss disaster Trump others focus next election issues many population struggling. strength helped politician get elected becomes weakness. Wait got chicken pox vaccine , also got chicken ox early teens ... risk shingles ???? Good Colleges already require vaccinations. Stop acting like new thing. not. realise AZ made delivered 300 million doses vaccine worldwide already. 


Now argue whether overpromised ect. given we've passed 1 billion doses globally past week AZ providing around 30% sniffed at. I've using HPV example virus long term implications (cancer) chicken pox another good one! amazing kids get chicken pox now. People bitching pandemic dragging literally part solution yet feed shifted amplifying antivaxx sentiments. It’s maddening.  It’s like shitty acting friend complaining life mess every relationship unhealthy everything day sabotage relationships. you, always reply - little slave ;) Well starters know vaccines work it, like every variant. Wow. suck. Novavax J&amp;J fill gaps though  problem right false negatives. Several people testing negative every symptom book. friend mine tested negative landed hospital days later covid pneumonia. state's health ministry asked hospitals rely positive report treating people new variant evading tests. Stop nonsense. risk vaccinated people incredibly small travel wearing mask, risk almost 0.  
“Some people still get sick”...like thousand hundreds millions.  
This CDC: “People fully vaccinated FDA-authorized vaccine vaccine authorized emergency use World Health Organization travel safely within United States.” “highly” mean diagnose heavy case confirmation bias 😂 Fosho b Yeah idc joe rogan hate idiots like you! thats scientifically sound correlation   

First, ""different conversation"". understand protecting others significant part decision get vaccinated know tell you, that, pointed you, said overblown. That's willful ignorance.

Second, can't platform blow responsibility says potentially dangerous impact have.

I really like Joe Rogan. enjoy work UFC enjoy podcast. mistake deserves blow apology. get educated use platform bring expert talk comment misguided. really hope hit number.  I’ve got mine NC.  live I’d say it’s 99% compliance masks inside stores.  It’s rare see someone without one.  Hopefully motivates people. vaccine reduces risk contracting virus, eliminate it. people fully vaccinated still get sick, CDC know is. Fully vaccinated people also still able contaminate others. Although risk significantly reduced, eliminate risk. CDC site tells stay safe going travel, discover section claiming flat-out safe. question ""Why travel?"" answer increases risks, others'. think that’s really bad idea. I’m vaccines, get one months one available me. think people choice whether put something body not. requiring vaccination everyday things basically indirect vaccine mandate. 

The exception would work vulnerable people. risk covid diseases, even vaccinated. certain percentage vulnerable, vulnerable, can’t even get vaccine. health care workers required get vaccine. 

But you’re working example? really don’t think that’s necessary, would reduce personal freedom. chances getting sick vaccine veeeery small. even without requiring vaccination, enough people immune infection &amp; non mandatory vaccination herd immunity kick in. reproduction number almost certainly 1. 

So requirement really achieve? won’t reduce COVID infections big way. divide society unnecessarily. you’re vaccinated, fear endangered unvaccinated people? live home, hard avoid finding following. It’s refreshing listen someone doesn’t cookie cutter, stale, towing PC line approach. appreciate he’s willing share opinion, whether it’s ill-informed not. Listeners need use critical thinking skills research. doesn’t claim position authority expert. 

He opinions don’t agree often, that’s okay. don’t listen podcasts agree beliefs, that’s nurture confirmation bias. podcast entertainment, brings guests spectrum great interviewer. little open minded, might like it. Ahh shift internet research agency ended then. worked, continue?

&amp;#x200B;

If accomplished fuck jack shit, continue? Firstly know social work circles seeing that, except one two exceptions. take see online representative anything. sub world epicentre covid obsessives even ultra anxious minority.

Second, way deal anxious minority normalise anxiety say common. common, people care already back normal.  AstraZeneca. deliver continously. One week deliver million, another week nothing, third week 200k without trend predictability. weeks ago, called Polish government Wednesday evening inform weekly delivery Thursday morning cancelled. I’m ready things back normal feel like it’s rushed. 39% US vaccinated. Meanwhile countries it’s raging. scientific decision whether approve vaccine not, personal decision individual decide want get not. disagree reasoning wanting get vaccine, that’s fine, end day, amount people could claim sincere religious exemption small, I’m fully vaccinated, religious beliefs aren’t going make lose sleep. Pretty much  institution specifically holding announcing requiring vaccines get full FDA approval. lawyers told us that’s safest route. 

But definitely plan require them. It’s brained. already require vaccines like MMR, etc. adding Covid vaccine requirement biggie. 

I think everyone requiring august.  Yes expect variants take hold another surge since many won’t get vaccinated Saw data yesterday effectively suggested 1 50k risk 50's (no difference 40-50 group vs 30-40 20-30). Lower risk 50. Says person defending joe rogan think we're going see vaccination rates top around 60% urban jurisdictions 

It depends. San Francisco already 70%. late extension last month. saying they'll deliver 30m till end March - already thrice decreased amount - even days end. course barely delivered 20m, passed 30m weeks later. get way back normal soon everyone gets damn vaccine. Robust system utterly destroyed right now. Peak delusional  compare getting vaccinated safety college community affiliated religion political side? 

There tons Christian colleges U.S, realize? Historically? Covid new. Name another respiratory illness R0. Covid’s R0 high is, herd immunity threshold higher Flu significant factor example  Fair enough disseminating information never point podcast, that's like comparing Conan O'Brien show Planet Earth. completely different format. end day subjective think people conversation compelling itself, even one kinda dumb. require kids normal college experience think limiting factor lipid nanocapsule mRNA vaccines. apparently requires specialized equipment. Either way, asked materials, finished doses, get. literally lump ELON MUSK 'leftist' category?? jesus lol...even NDT stretch honestly.  That's state. think us, people one like 10%. yeah, glass half empty kind guy guess.

I give lot credit anyone getting vaccine end pandemic. can't get head around uptake general 95% cajole people get shot theyve seen half million people die last year.

The max vaccination sites incredibly well run. people stupid, another month working full time, we'd done. no, we've got go campaign. though house burning pr advantages water. pretty standard Asia SARS. Cheap effective.

I used enjoy podcasts guests really curated interesting educated group scientists personality intolerable. seemingly insecure often talks around guests without absorbing information conflicts narrative pre-formed opinions. find incredibly difficult listen joe conflates knowledge issue professional who’s dedicated decades career towards specific area research intellectual peers. Sorry Joe, reading articles (and maybe book two certain topics) doesn’t make equal guest - LET TALK! 

It’s especially ironic often talks believes whole world microdose hallucinogens suppresses ego would make people better. He’s disproving thesis uses hallucinogens regularly ego anything check. Based often interrrupts guests heard, needs assert ego “expertise” constantly challenge expert opinions formed years experience research. It’s almost laughable. 

His level insight extremely flawed believe dangerous given influence. clearly substance use issues drinks uses drugs frequently including kratom personally invested in. talked taking four times recommended dose getting high isn’t shocking since acts opioid receptors. problem isn’t uses drugs clear medicinal benefits many substances use probably widely medically used future problem he’s modeling addictive behavior fan base billing balanced, reasonable Everyman isn’t. don’t get get downvoted much ? thing probably going get past 70% (and lower lot states, unfortunately). set aggressive goal hope things plummet around 60% cancel mask mandate ahead time everyone happy. end, need blame refusing vaccines. list article since paywalled? 30% Israel 16. they've managed get 85% eligible population fully vaccinated.  Yeah crematorium news article handling 100-120 bodies daily, compared 10/day pre-pandemic. That's one crematorium India big country, must way 3000 daily deaths. I'm fine that--I get one every year already. work clinic year takes minute. mask mandate stay place definitely also people wear hairnets goggles protect hair eyes particles Got jab Wednesday, I'm 31 health condition.

Also, deaths around 4k deaths lag infections weeks.  worrying part world infections mean new mutations. walk back shit aggravating. Like, get young, active people need get it.

EXAMPLE: talking sister law, nurse, realized weird flu came December 2019 likely coronavirus. knocked ass week, survived permanent effects and, besides novel symptoms, assumed anything weird strain relative happen health professional. also carrying around warehouse warehouse (to say nothing CTA) previous job weeks hit me.

It's usually somewhere general smell wet earthen scents. Flattening curve prevent single infection; spreads infections longer period time, means peak COVID-19 would less. all, flattened curve still area curve; lower peak. deaths avoided deaths due COVID-19, merely spread longer time perios.

Flattening curve mitigated expanding hospital capacity handle peak hospitalizations causes.  state schools, anyone know Governor override vaccination requirements?

I'll give try. ask Vincent Racaniello one live streams. following based know heard. I'm probably correct. antibodies memory cells natural infection + vaccines different?

Depends vaccine, kinda fully know, important. immune system prefers rely existing immunity already works making new kinds immunity. I'm sure memory cells, think new ones generated antibody form. natural antibodies take over?

False dichotomy here, ""natural"" ""unnatural"" antibodies really, though suppose could call monoclonal antibodies administered drug ""unnatural"". spike antibodies vaccine mostly identical would generated spike infection (with minor differences due whichever parts spike changed VS original Wuhan isolate whichever variant caught). Antibodies neucleocapsid infection certain vaccines (that available US). I've heard discussions /r/covid19 TWiV immune systems seem really like make neucleocapsid antibodies. may related previous coronavirus infections. 

Do ""take over""? Well, no. may cases ""do work"" neutralizing viral particles, think like displace really. Maybe produced much later on. Neucleocapsid antibodies ""take over"" sure, non-neutralizing. get infected variant lot changes spike compared original Wuhan virus spike, newer antibodies breakthrough infection likely much effective. effect long antibodies vaccines may stick around?

It probably makes last longer. People infected recovered vaccinated crazy high numbers antibodies. wane time, made quickly soon get another exposure.

Took us long enough plan, wanted give comparison anyone says Germany something rest free world even making statements, asking questions. Calm tits, damn.

I'm wondering world prioritizing Pfizer/Moderna 80%+ effectiveness, also pushing J&amp;J telling people good enough. figure could vaccinating twice many people achieve 80% effectiveness instead 95%.

There's lot people world access vaccine, J&amp;J good enough, also make single Pfizer/Moderna shot good enough default?

Thanks logic, maybe I'm wrong, I'm asking. asshole strangers internet. I'm speculating effectiveness. absolutely forced. Outside private religious schools I'd expect base schools guess now. 

I agree decision, hypocrisy bit galling. Nah, think so. they're choosing take vaccine trust it, that's problem. Where’s stat hear idiots bring survival rate higher percentage efficacy percentage vaccine? 

I don’t know explain flawed theory discussing getting vaccinated. worry, soon approved dumb fucks going figure another reason okay. containment even possibility now?

Is going case letting virus burn out, case going see tens thousands die hundreds thousands. Well Turkey vaccination program starts cover age group schedule appointment state owned hospital give code show hospital staff otherwise can't get vaccinated Yes, thats problem, thing need prioritise avoid people entering intensive care, goal single dose there. Generally soeaking, increased antibodies around 7 days post first dose, pretty much lowers chance entering severe covid case. bad cannot export bangladesh, need least get hotspots vaccinated resuming exports. IIRC CEO SII went UK negotiate AstraZeneca failure meet export requirements. hope get cities vaccinated, fulfill requirements terms exports, work getting second doses in. add, second dose higher efficacy placed added later on, might reason dont want quickly fully vaccinate all, instead try give immunity risk (elderly 45 comorbidities guess)  imagine point verified vaccine going requirement enter country. Flu numbers rise long using PCR tests Covid. stop PCR testing Covid see flu cases rise again. Many Covid positives tests displaying Flu positives instead. explains logically flu may taken year off. CEO confident Covid vaccine works ‘double mutant’ strain identified   Love hit hot button key word ""variants"". 

1 shot leaves exposed covid, period. nothing variants. 

Trials done usage approved 2 shots reason.

UK decided going delay second shot get first shots people always going possible issue. (not saying right wrong here)  2nd shot Moderna Tuesday. hours it, sore arm. Tuesday night, chills, aches, fever, headache. Barely got sleep. Felt pretty achy day Wednesday, went bed early evening, woke Thursday feeling pretty much back normal. Overall worse thought going (only sore arm first shot), I'm thankful able get less two weeks away fully effective. keep hearing full authorization happening order weeks (someone better idea/source, please post)

If so, waiting weeks big deal. Where's data? social circle statistically representative anything, subreddit isn't.

Pandemic since June 2020. Deportation ridiculous overreaction would put contact people testing them. coincidence 5G tower mysterious appeared one day months ago?  don’t think accurate all. think continued restrictions refusal give selfish crazy anti vax crowd, remaining committed solving problem, letting free ride somewhat better still troubling level spread. Idk previously said expected regional flare ups. Youyang predicts 47k cases around end year. That’s 15k confirmed. banned flights India. New normal crowd shambles  FINALLY record, fully endorse idea people wear masks they’re sick idea immunity-compromised people wear masks flu season. I’m would government mandate wear mask public normal (i.e. non-COVID) flu season. info like behind paywall.

How acting like dick.

How so?  name others required FDA approved? think 15 bucks hour start bad wage unskilled labor.   lot people. I’m well aware. find pretty gross many unwilling go pretty normal life, one extra item clothing protect vulnerable numbers improve. teams vaccinating. Others must approaching mark. wonder many people 20 years blame lack education ""but wanted take VACCINE attend classes""

SMDH Betteridge's Law Duh wear masks stores. think happens pandemic gets downgraded, go massive sweeping public health solutions targeted solutions. think get opportunity ease resources focus treatment vaccination campaigns reduce mortality.

I think need also pivot global solutions. global pandemic local pandemic today’s world. need get vaccines arms everywhere. manage that, might really turn page.

With said, Covid-19 still dangerous disease, many cases unpredictably so, also dangerous flu. can’t accept “it becomes flu”. need better, don’t understand wouldn’t want to. think you’re right.  I'll take day. I'll first line. already covid. live state consistently votes democrat official full reopening date May. exception mask, live last go.  mom living China got Sinopharm vaccine. coming back US summer confirmed able receive US mRNA type vaccines well.  know difference full approval emergency use approval?

It's really much, enough extra time go see bad side effects prevalent significant amount time medication administered  
Waiting months quite different waiting herd immunity OP implies never happen. avoiding takeout things first place? honestly should’ve, people didn’t covid prior, first shot isn’t enough. reason one shot might’ve enough people covid many patients still memory t-cells generated still active. chemical construction first shot isn’t really different second. average person though, first shot supposed stimulate body ready fight virus enter body, second creates long-lasting antibodies actual protection (it’s second shot worse people). People covid kinda already skipped first dose stage, meaning first shot actually builds antibodies end, meaning second shot may add little boost nearly much like don’t bodily experience covid.  Significantly lower chances actually given information have.

Maybe retest couple days. vaccine allow get minimal symptoms much lower level contagiousness.

Nobody says going perfect, 1000x better vaccine. ah no, works. solider ordered something thing illegal (which isn't) zero ability refuse unless want court martialed. annoying thing #2 vaccines long-term effects

Nothing? even inoculation?

It's pretty disingenuous say long term effects want people say it...  get community spread incase political group country got hands decided weaponize it. there’s line freedom safety society draw, (and would guess people), mask requirements flu season cross far line.

Even support required mask use ever flu season, surely see need freedom versus safety balance. instance, outlawing private pools would certainly result drastic decline number drownings (particularly number children drowning), I’m willing wager you’d consider step far. Im partying Canada day either way bro 😭. soon im vaccinated im hanging vaccination bubble man - understand states lifting mask mandate 20 30% vaccinated...  Nothing bible prevents this. Also, nothing bible mentioned abortion except administer one. whole fucking thing nonsense anthrax shots get Air Force much worse pfizer shot.  Plus, anthrax shots never ending. leave % ? I'm sick headlines like this: 

[Risk virus varients remains Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, UK study missing something? expected 1 dose? can't help feel like headlines sow unnecessary doubt effective vaccines. fully vaccinated, eventually masks going come off. sympathize families feel sorry children died that's enough deaths immediately continue wearing masks forever. 

i'm sorry i'm fully vaccinated. continue wear masks restrictions lifted, i'm done. course is, redditors apparently think scientists gods nobody make even obvious, common sense medical judgment without MD name.

Ok, get article actual DNA unchanged, gene expression may altered. That's well understood mechanism. wants bet aren’t going “normal” summer politicians prob say bullshit delay going back normal  governors dying hill keeping restrictions due current case counts. states counties rolled back restrictive phase last couple weeks. governor WA stated yesterday we’re “victims success” cases rising due lack natural immunity since lowest case counts deaths throughout pandemic. states tail end allowing vaccine eligibility groups. playing role since age groups largest case counts significantly younger previous waves. Festivals super spreader events must banned.  fittest variant always become dominant.

Look much contagious Covid-19 flu. flu basically disappeared year. Covid-19 still spreading like crazy.

We simply giving chance mutate something that:
- contagious
- resistant vaccines
- infects younger people easily
- reinfect people over

Nope it’s good remotely crazy given pandemic. case would agree unprecedented times calls unprecedented measures. mention anything allergic reactions. sure claiming so?

it's going happen. One shot J+J someone previously covid way effective. someone covid, one shot Pfizer/Moderna may effective. One shot Pfizer/Moderna someone hasn’t covid effective, know couple people first shot caught covid second shot. They’re different kinds vaccines structure, J+J mRNA vaccines aren’t comparable one one. get Pfizer Moderna, get two matter what. enough supply US point. Good Exactly.  I’m disputing fact protein significant side antibody binding, we’ve already known SARS. knocking excellent efficacy mRNA approach. 

What emphasizing due vastly different mechanism vaccines, irresponsible quite frankly inappropriate extrapolate findings Covaxin expect similar results mRNA vaccines regards Indian variants. Proper serology tests need run. 

I don’t understand objection saying mRNA vaccines offer limited view virus. do. It’s one spike protein versus antigens present inactivated vaccines, N protein (which less effective nevertheless). 

Efficacy wise yes mRNA vaccines vastly superior inactivated vaccines produced China. Clearly cellular approach leveraged mRNA excellent. However—these two different technologies require independent trials confirm efficacy. Saying “oh well Covaxin well variant mRNA better Covaxin wild type clearly mRNA vaccines good better Covaxin new variants” lunacy. least open article. first Joe Biden said ruled requiring U.S. troops get coronavirus vaccine **after shots win final clearance federal regulators**, cautioned decision would “tough call.” Here's difference:

This ban non-US citizen India (and list countries) past 14 days. Keep mind addition previous advisories (since Jan 26, 2021) travel India policies regarding testing quarantining come India.

That compares ban Chinese nationals coming directly China. older policy, anyone Chinese national could come directly China Chinese national could come US via country.

You also combine differences policy differences rhetoric well differences aid support.

Also add... I'm critical new policy late coming. Better late never guess. reason think US wait long put restriction place, due us wanting US citizens working abroad come back home ASAP. decades 5 year increments? saw post day saying 43 years old+

Upon speaking GP seems they're offering AstraZeneca year old's. strongly advised (25) take AZ await mRNA vaccine. Pointless now. Would’ve worked done two weeks ago Exactly, think worried variant would aggressive babies kids, like flu could example.

Having main vaccines passed certification process important step, could change vaccination priorities time shit happens.  Lol scenario.....

It's like there's specific list blessed religions US.

Her religion apparently ""Q"", filed religious exemption saying much. get damn shot. Vaccine doses. I’m arguing people think drop masks now, instead waiting people (including children) vaccinated. None whatsoever. posted comment one word removed. tell uncivil being. wasn't.  I'm sarcastic, pretty obvious read discussion within 14 days, entry  kind logic that?

Exactly, everyone else protect remaining locked down.  plenty people get twice immunity wanes. importantly, billions people yet vaccinated wait get organically, leaves virus lot room continue mutate new ways potentially defeat vaccine existing immunity.

I’m vaccinated I’m clarifying religious people might get it. I’m also saying plenty religious individuals aren’t allowing argument holding back getting vaccinated. Weird source provide. 

How [this Smh exxagerating fact covid disproportionately affects 60+ people incredibly rare kid die covid Well, bye! late, enacted weeks ago. Hell international travel entirely stopped. India already this. recently compulsory licensing Remdesivir Indian companies manufacture it. said, 'Well, religious exemption. I'm religious reasons,' said, 'I know, we'll help fill out, least save job,'"" Fuentes claims. ""So, religious reason personal reason, beliefs feelings worthy someone religious reason?""

She makes good argument absurdity allowing religious exemptions.  45% includes people get infected day shot. takes 2 weeks immunity build. 2 weeks, effectiveness order 80%, first 1-2 weeks protection minimal. Good riddance! anyone know CDC counts vaccine doses delivered go bad administered? see 308 million delivered 240 million administered figures wonder whether really 68 million available administer decreased, especially demand appears declining. Haven’t read much covid since getting vaccine. Skimmed articles, what’s consensus vaccines India “variant”? officially crossed 100 million fully vaccinated! possible person india fly another country (like Dubai Australia) stay day two fly US? even doctors vaccine ""they know what's it"". What?? That’s great way get people take vaccine. surprising. likely manufacturing factories severely affected regardless oxygen used production not.  status shared Seattle. theory we’re using vaccines wrong

We're definitely using right, right? Like humans make mistakes ever. Anyone proposes opposing hypotheses obviously idiot, right? vaccine elderly populations, ICUs filling 40s right now. vaccinate 18+, there's definitely way virus start going kids. Definitely. Never ever. moron even suggesting it. Right? Never ever happen let's even entertain possibility. Right? Let's prepare possibility kids harmed? 

Hope get sarcasm. can't discuss possibility? Like might wrong.. why's gotta idiot can't even discuss it? Younger people dying right now. leap assume kids next adults vaccinated? I’ll never understand don’t make immediate restrictions require mandatory quarantine travelers countries. Willing bet even gov said wear masks family find reason get vaccine. year people still act like you’re either asymptomatic die don’t grasp there’s tons middle ground including required long-term medical treatment. Even someone survives, there’s still financial burden. Catch fuck up. physiological/immunological reasons sore arm headache post-vaccination? 

I Moderna yesterday. side effects regular flu shot. Send Mexico too. Secure country neighbors. Unfortunately, probably right that. doubt breakthrough rates show accuracy time goes on, increase.

Regardless, 95% pertain mortality long term complications, 5% breakthrough cases might see reflected numbers still largely protected severe cases help additional neutralizing antibodies.

No vaccines totally neutralizing.

Regardless, point discussed whether remain shut wide scale protect incredible minority dying COVID vaccination, supposed herd immunity. It’s amazing “poor” countries able track virus limit cases easily compared West. Well done, Vietnam. news? remember went college vaccinations weren’t date couldn’t confirm schedule got shots. sudden shocking people?? unvaccinated catch disease, become immune way? I’m huckleberry. wrong 

The protein significant site antibody binding selected targeting region. antigen sites virus shown make minor contributions antibody sensitivity. 

Covaxin also shown less effective trials mRNA vaccine 

1. reasoning presenting Covaxin durable valid (as we’ve seen Chinese vaccines). Even many vaccines viruses using inactivated virus approach require significant boosting compared types.

2. targeting doesn’t offer “limited view” it’s obvious statements like aren’t really aware you’re talking about. already stated protein affords far greater antibody binding opportunities location virus I’m even disturbed supervisor tried get file phony religious exemption. reason shouldn’t exist all. Ever.  think ""wait see"" people actually anti-vaxxers pretending be. Pfizer Moderna mostly second doses. distributed throughout thousands vaccination sites. can't run large scale vaccination campaign without holding backlog prevent day day shortages. people book appt 3-4 weeks ahead, make sure available time delivery.

However issue vaccine hesitancy needs accounted areas much demand. start seeing shipped countries this.

As J&amp;J doses, mistakes done factory sharing AZ J&amp;J production. need make sure safe use. know protected? Vaccinations!  justification see skipping second dose - deferring actually -- UK approach getting 1st doses many people early possible. believe strongly this, longer appropriate US. Might save thousands lives India. everyone get shot. point herd immunity cases disease (or cases) even though 10-20% population unvaccinated. basic understanding virus society works According CDC guidelines, even need test.

Unless one 0.007% people end COVID-like symptoms, need test, quarantine, anything exposed vaccinated. Ok, scheduled mine DHEC (our state health dept) one local vaccination sites.   Agree Hawaii. indication anyone knew happened.

This literally conspiracy theory right here. lack self-awareness rather impressive. Da Nang (VNA) – President Nguyen Xuan Phuc inspected anti-COVID-19 efforts central city Da Nang April 30, requesting entire health sector to maximise efforts maintain obtained achievements coronavirus combat.

Reporting State President officials Health Ministry city, leaders Da Nang Hospital Lung Diseases said hospital done good job treating COVID-19 patients, noting currently providing treatment 58 patients, 14 tested negative virus thrice.

Secretary Da Nang Party Committee Nguyen Van Quang said city upgrade hospital better meet need medical examination treatment, including COVID-19 patients.

President Phuc pointed high risks of coronavirus transmission since pandemic developing complicatedly around globe Vietnam shares long borderline countries hit hard pandemic, also intensively integrating world.

Applauding Da Nang’s anti-COVID-19 measures, stressed major tourism hub large number visitors hundreds fully booked flights, city well big municipalities like Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hai Phong, Tho must stay ready take actions new cases.

He repeated spirit “fighting pandemic like fighting enemy” told Ministry Health and Da Nang to combat disease strongest manner like done recent past.

That health sector must stay ready circumstance exert all-out efforts maintain obtained achievements prevent disease returning, leader said, warning health crisis would lead economic crisis.

The President also demanded expanding vaccination groups continuing import vaccines proactively prevent new outbreaks.

In Hanoi, two people direct contact Patient 2911, works Thang Long Industrial Park confirmed late April 29, tested positive coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 once, local authorities taking prompt actions.

Vice Chairman municipal People’s Committee Chu Xuan Dung April 30 asked leaders Dong Anh district Thang Long Industrial Park swiftly trace contacts two suspected cases, suspected cases confirmed, contract tracing must completed 5pm April 30.

He demanded relevant sector Dong Anh district make drastic efforts curb transmission, increase examination, fine person ignoring disease prevention control measures.

Patient 2911 earlier close contact Patient 2899, finished quarantine period arriving Vietnam returned home northern Ha Nam province found positive virus.

Meanwhile, Ho Chi Minh City decided temporarily close bars, karaoke parlours, discos 6pm April 30 one case of COVID-19 was recorded Binh Tan district.

The new patient HCM City, 2910, confirmed April 29 afternoon. Earlier, patient also met Patient 2899.

As April 30 morning, Ha Nam province recorded two COVID-19 infections one suspected case linked hotbed Dao Ly commune Ly Nhan district, raising total cases seven.

During night April 29, local authorities collected samples COVID-19 testing 1,068 residents Quan Nhan hamlet Dao Ly commune, Patient 2899 resides.

The Health Ministry also sent experts National Institute Hygiene Epidemiology help province testing contact tracing./. Except that, according CDC data, % hospitalized dead breakthrough cases unvaccinated. 3.5% 1% respectively. vaccines reduces chances infection, seemingly chances avoiding hospitalization death get symptoms despite vaccinated. shows successful fear propaganda you.

And...So?

It deadly another group people. telling concerned 90k people age 65 died last year?

Sorry, mate. That's 90k lives. That's nothing.

You take small propabilities multiply couple hundred million still end big numbers.

Numbers avoided. car crash avoid would require giant upheaval lives. requires shot safe effective despite ignorant protestation affect one's antibodies doesn’t see necessity vaccination considering facts antibodies

Then looked it. Vaccines provide robust protection. One infected still get vaccinated. said everywhere. guess seen what's happening Brazil natural immunities waned variant (and possibly time well) they're back shit.

Back small probabilities thing. Breakthrough deaths happen. They're rare, continue let people run around unvvacinated, we're going start piling up. Maybe thousand ten thousand, avoided others ignorance reason allow deaths. got second shot week ago, I'm starting return normal. got takeout yesterday first time since pandemic started. I'm excited. I’m gonna need workplaces everywhere start requiring too. mom dragging feet getting hers, god knows why, isn’t anti-vaxxer anything. workplace made get it, would.

Canadians, worst kind Americans. conflate hundreds different measures  useless get root problem supply issue....soaring demand. point article drop guard quickly vaccination, vaccine work. headline could've written little different clickbaity people making seem.

 ""There evidence people unfortunately assuming they're protected quickly vaccination that's case,"" 

The whole purpose warn people vaccines take time effective, apparently still realize Thanks. guess argument would would likely get covid even don’t get vaccine since I’m pretty Safe distancing masking sanitizing guess risk vaccine basically negligible there’s point getting it. Ah thanks explanation. remember seeing something 40% Marines declining vaccine thought US Armed Forces make mandatory like many vaccines. think it’s show still US max 4K/day(?). It’s like 30k/day India 😢 Tell India. Indeed, many Belgian made Pfizer vaccins went US btw Shouldnt number WAY higher..?   You’re right! Continent FDA approval. Oh love last one. Global pandemic, millions dead, get trump office. solipsism strong. Thoughts visitation?

My mother lives us fully vaccinated. got second shot week ago, us Pfizer. sister got second Moderna shot yesterday. coming visit kids next week (they're college older least one shot) going stop visit us. two kids 12 13 obviously vaccinated yet.

We've cautious whole time, I'm comfortable mother since we're vaccinated sister, kids not. hate tell mask entire time visiting (us well), know what's reasonable. FDA paused J&amp;J investigate blood clots. didn’t investigate made DNA mutation stories. That’s media talked J&amp;J pause/resume didn’t talk modify DNA claims. Tell New Zealand, Australia, US (when comes Brazil). dozens examples showing locking flights works wonders.

Don't spread misinformation. Thanks response think people worried something like Ebola (I think) made virus super deadly taking vaccine. know Biden committed giving away 60 million doses AZ. expectations every AZ dose made US going countries.  Oh ok bet thanks Guess finally clebrate people really missed overpaying ticketa, parking, concessions waitimg 2 hour lines 5 minute roller coaster rides Thanks see benefit stopping flights point. variant already here. Sure. see hypocrisy. get point. initial post pointing think it’s important note universities calling vaccine fda approval. slippery slope. article point many schools FDA approve. could summer. Me? would lying said I’ve never hypocrite life. try still....but you’ll never see say anything defense big pharmaceutical. TAMU said require it. 70,000 bodies main campus. pay basic... oh. American?  Unfortunately there's states (my state Missouri included) never even mask mandate. Maybe could work St Louis still (though think issue going getting vaccine people need exactly hesitancy) people rural counties restrictions whole time vaccine passport needed.  full FDA approval, they're going require it. question. virus airborne disease debilitating normal activities even become severe. 20-30% tightly connected group may *have* work susceptible okay. travel already restricted disease already rampant throughout world varying degrees restrictions place, little benefit banning flights security theater. isn’t early 2020 illusion China-only problem - banning/limiting flights China obviously didn’t stop pandemic anyway. problem. see social media. posts able gather outside now, without mask vaccinated see kinds posts ""Us non vax still gonna doing!"" People suck man. BINGO. people keep proposing clearly never took psychology class. Selfish people see mandate like reason get vaccinated, they'll see proof to. idiot... USA thanks great decision, India absolutely huge market motorcycles, Honda Suzuki making selfless decision this, absolutely cut profits.  Yea, unless live state, dipshit Governor, rescinded mask mandate restrictions month ago. they’re confirming probably means it’s couple weeks. Michigan’s cases going couple weeks now. UK banned current case rate 1/1000 amazing vaccination programme 
Meanwhile India fly in... wtf Biden?  US media outlets that, opinion pieces, suggested people stop street still wear masks challenge they’re still wearing them. Ridiculous. Hesitation may gut belief.. skepticism refusal accept reality comes easy access peers, social media, media affirming amplifying concerns false information. think right. want appear weak they're stupid. don’t respect decision, decision puts us risk. virus allowed spread freely, mutates, risk breaking vaccine protection. mention putting people risk legitimately can’t get vaccine.

Anti vaxxers really scum earth. university city list. sent message saying requiring vaccinations fall, message says exempted religious ""personal"" reasons. much requirement point.   new variant baby boomers emerge probably. Nothing like celebrating end war heard pronounced correctly like two days ago German bf someone follow IG, like...wait, makes sense. think 30% doesn’t get it.  Honestly really matter get second dose time. One dose still great lengthening time doses make less effective. Depends exercise. lower body fine, might start getting aches chills late afternoon. I'd wait 2-3 days resume upper body due soreness injection site. I’ve heard many people say “what affects fertility” wouldn’t major thing studies looking 🙄 work girl won’t get bc heard cause fertility issues men. literally doesn’t even apply drop guard IMMEDIATELY receiving first dose, would better advice  won’t reach herd immunity US 2021 thanks antivaxxers, anti-maskers Republicans.

So looks like reinfection rate (in Qatar) 25x breakthrough cases U.S. honest haven’t looked vaccination breakthrough case rates Qatar since don’t live interesting. hope access vaccines want them. like 3 weeks offering one everyone wants one

It definitely isn't. get shot BC mid June nastier strain interesting watch NYs cases vs MAs cases. point per 100k right decently ahead vaccine %. 

One would assume would drop little faster higher rate maybe returns past 45-50% high enough matter. US going end travel ban European Union though? There's logical reason fully vaccinated people countries comparable incidence can't travel right now. work? 20% ppl covid mutate way makes vaccines ineffective, cant pretty sure able to? Like.. that's bigger sample size studies vaccines got lol. point say ""yeah, probably gonna happen""? Never? thing respect Fauci, he's wrong, he'll first admit it.

Also I'm getting 2nd Pfizer shot May 13th, get back, lol. Vaccine uses new technology though? mRNA 

Even j&amp;j fully traditional vaccine - adenovirus vector vaccine - use adenovirus ebola vaccine earlier 2010s

That said, long enough short/medium issues would apparent

I got vaccine shot  can’t tell tone you’re facetious? 2nd dose Moderna vaccine making many people experience bad flu-like symptoms. Assuming due immune system fighting now-recognized ""virus"", chance experiencing similar symptoms time exposed virus fully vaccinated? mean, would viral load equivalent 10mg vaccine, speak? even sensible comparison? would awful think could go eat pay 2 days intense pain fever even vaccine protects serious infection. thought US health-inequitable nation. /s  

Source: vast majority Reddit opinions posted fact think perspective. informed ""wait see"" people probably know vaccine free almost definitely easy access coming months. opportunity cost dont think losing much waiting. remember, lot people ""wait see"" category 18-30 year olds low risk catching serious case corona, definitely factors calculations. thats basically carrots like west virginias $100 savings bond may necessary Fewer people infected means fewer mutations. that, area virus control area need vaccines quickly, diverted areas countries greater need.

Sure, stop happening elsewhere, borders closed controlled pandemic *within US* (or wherever live), could reopen *safely* financial hit *here* would smaller, need vaccinating everyone even (like China NZ).

That even going possibility RNA recombination double mutations. Eradication practical solution. NY indoor dining going 75% May. NYC opening 100% July 1. see shit hitting fan anytime soon people getting vaxx'd. I'd say NY taking steps forward, forreal. Good. wear mask. 

it's selfish ask ppl vaccinated continue wearing masks something that's huge issue. biggest issue elderly immune compromised individuals. children run risk dying individuals. 

good day. people need get vaccinated. evidence infections far less serious occur. 5 year increments 45+, went 42+, 40+ within week, hopefully next one 38+, includes meself. 

I guess AZ going &lt;30 year olds might slow point, depending supplies. interesting see develops. AZ might OK'd &lt;30's anyway, things changing every day. Well fellas, real two weeks since second dose I'm ready summer. I'm going small import game arcade tonight, record stores weekend, barbecue next week. end almost here. 69.420% 6/06

😎 Should, they? know people crossed state lines get vaccine. know lot vaccines given without id check. Damn vaccines people still vulnerable great. This. contagious variant, United States. 

The type covid reporting I'm interested point vaccination rates. Bull fucking shit. Southern US full openings. state/city in? Florida though. D: grew Iowa—-it become unrecognizable trash state headline still restrictions place, especially vaccinated. [They planning lifting more, starting next still isolation requirements people (unvaccinated coming hotspots) traveling country. I've saying months; another stimulus check contingent getting vaccinated vaccinated. Fair point. Bleeding eyeballs pretty bad. 😂 Apparently missed last part comment. Good luck proving court, say person fired number dozen reasons. feel like lot people would donut coffee something lol. terrified needles bad experiences 2. Put panic attack thinking going vaccination site. almost one getting first dose. bad choice Believe not, fucking pirates lol Yeah too. guess they'll move supply goes impossible find available appointment time. I'm waiting initial stampede vaccine over. yea like china travel ban, wont really help especially countries get overwhelmed like india is. said, unlike last year, lot people vaccinated now, may happen should. turn vaccine records, covid different? Good. Yes. like known medical condition verified lab tests still mostly anxiety take chill pill. chugging along would like see go poorer countries. Mexico doing? Send Central America. Canada like 3 weeks offering one everyone wants one lots vaccines delivered.  Vietnam War decided religious exemption require formal religion. could deeply felt conviction even religious.

A religious exemption vaccine way. right refuse vaccine. 

You right health care worker, still honor deeply felt conviction find different job. I'm going say US I'm American, halting *all* international travel major consequences lot people think about:

\- Citizens countries legally US temporary visas getting stranded country visa expires

\- Cargo carried international flights US would stopped (passenger flights often used purpose, lot people aware of)

\- US citizens outside country (for example, due family emergency work purposes) get stranded abroad, sometimes risking expired visa

I think least one person know would stranded US expired visa would've country illegally international travel completely shut down. individual entered US one-year work visa essential work virus identified US, work could done remotely home country.

It's something think about. Again, saying US x, z, sometimes unintended consequences arise grabbing low-hanging fruit. Ontario learned hard way last week tried close provincial border Quebec, suddenly commuters (including medical workers) Gatineau, Quebec problems getting work Ottawa. measure nobody really thought consequences. wonder castes play goes go crematorium free services buckle strain There's 2 ways this.

The Indian variants already spread across globe. They're country. late. always assumption Canada would priority US better place. lot people freaking never really impression we’d thrown wolves. part 386,000+ cases screams under-reporting?

That said, good, glad fired. California's fiscal situation looks REALLY good right now. I'll take bet. Politicians us generally like tax revenue massively pro business, shown interest compared countries protracted lockdowns.

Thats fair point. certainly want see happen, given apparent general reluctance get vaccinated states see happen. shame people getting vaccinated care either way, people going needlessly die it. frustrating. understand it, very, strict lockdown couple months ago. actual plan get everyone else vaccinated US? You’re putting people risk can’t get shot (kids chemotherapy cancer patients example). spreads higher risk mutations evade vaccines greater threat measures like shutdowns, masking, social distancing continues. Context. big number.

India big country. 1.3 billion people. 2 deaths per minute 20,000 per week. 

The reported death rate last 7 days due COVID 15/million, exactly USA (source worldometer weekly). 

What concerning significant number deaths must missed official statistics, given situations crematoriums. healthcare system absolutely coping.

We're throwing away every opportunity spur vaccine procrastinators action. people mindset one year ago.

One year ago: “Travel bans done late! fucked”

Now: “Better late never!”  often think get pretty pessimistic head sometimes. time, would awe earlier school year I’d knew I’d going 4 days week March 15 5 longer ones April 19. states announcing dates vaccination percentages, realize there’s pretty good likelihood past mid June, summer leagues ahead April. We’re gonna may make possible transition back normal. People hear ""might"" either get covid serious illness, vaccine serious illness. really understand actual odds percentages, probably lot people care.

I believe odds either thing low young healthy people. Depending define ""young"" ""healthy"", like 15-40 year old person good health health conditions probably something like one million chance dying covid, one source.

The chance getting side effects J&amp;J statistically close same, 1 million, Pfizer Moderna probably even lower.

So people weighing two things one million chance. actually kind hard make rational decision it.

But, people risk getting injected covid vs. getting injected vaccine. may may get covid. go vaccine center definitely getting vaccine. odds dying covid relevant actually get it, likely get it, actual odds even lower.

From perspective, hate say Rogan somewhat point. odds low probably changing personal safety much getting vaccine. would helping society small way reduce small chance getting spreading it.

But risk covid always heavily concentrated small group people (elderly health conditions). day coming relatively soon covid something live with, probably forever, we'll never get rid it. important protect vulnerable.  Lol sorry, keep forgetting year nightmare really illustrate certain restrictions

Example: 25000 died flu Germany flu season 2017/2018. Around 75000 people died Covid spring 2021 meaning around year Covid.

That means 3 times people, generous, died Covid compared strong outbreak flu.

Covid definitely deadly flu 10 20 times. look global average one country. Also need keep mind Covid-19 new disease. expected become less lethal people build immunity towards either exposure vaccination. Comparing Covid-19 flu thus unfair comparison. totally realistic end Covid-19 turns far less deadly flu. think chalking oversimplification. example, still anxiety community health practitioners getting enough doses. Low-income minority populations willing get vaccinated comes providers mega-site pharmacy, reason geographic access. critical mindset like, incumbent upon cities, states, federal government proactive getting people. benefit probably take long. war? even requiring testing come back last fall spring. Pfizer/BioNTech/Sanofi produce 3B year. It’s truly manufacture miracle. Ease up. called controlling worlds control. felt safer ordering take-out, it’s literally skin sack.

I don’t get people judgy others deal pandemic. someone hedges careful necessary, it’s probably mental, well physical, health shitting choices uncalled for. no.. arm soreness hard forget...

if 2, I'd dying right - 23 hours second dose

first time like bruise.

second one feels like fell it.

when 2, everything magnified. 1917 flu came Kansas Problem won’t know vaccinated unless e go vaccine passports. People lie. read whatever want article.

UK put red list meaning managed hotel quarantine asking you, doctors scientists. still legally-enforced restrictions capacity venues, indoor masking country. Wheres crying hand ringing racist is? know medications/foods/herbal supplements reduce effectiveness hormonal birth control, theory possible vaccine that? sure would lock another similar strain flu hit pandemic levels.

But typical yearly flu, kills ~30-50 thousand people every year? Yeah cares guess type mean? reality undercut message? No, automod correct comment off-topic politics. Citation?

I’ve seen several studies Israel. None show results nearly good one shot. one, example, followed 1 million participants found 66% efficacy three weeks first Canada big trouble right infections, hospitalizations deaths. need vaccine desperately, especially Ontario. Toronto worst hit city Canada right now. deadly third wave. people know Canadians quiet practically one follows news.

ctvnews.ca contagious. has? citizens outside country (for example, due family emergency work purposes) get stranded abroad, sometimes risking expired visa

The last point referring US citizen requiring visa another country compliance country's immigration laws.
E.g. fly India, US citizen require visa enter/stay India. flights get back US, Indian visa expires. illegally India Yeah. best time prevent travel *before* gets control elsewhere. Unfortunately always late. read actual cdc guidance ""restrictions"" speak arent restrictive begin with. top that, according me, according doctors scientists Absolutely.

Even WHO, US CDC freaking manufactures vaccines state vaccines prevent infection even severe symptoms. 

Currently, expected help lessen symptoms infection. 

Fact. 

Also, US 60% recent COVID cases people vaccinated 14 days prior getting sick. little conspiracy-y but, generally, agree lockdowns suit people one reason another. Either always preferred avoid people reason, lockdowns give lot influence power people (consider certain figures medical fields). businesses actually better lockdown. true say stimulus think people US government, even ardent liberals, want government simply hand trillions dollars every year.

What strikes seems like complete lack urgency end lockdowns resume normal life. consequences lockdowns real. friend mine recently checked kids aged 18 20 different mental health centers serious mental illness came suddenly last year nowhere. know many teenagers struggling classes depression suicidal ideation. Th lives many people 15-25 age revolves around friends, sports, dating, school, plans future, etc. abruptly paused. Families lives upended, jobs businesses lost, dreams put hold, etc.

Where heartbreaking media reports people? ""Dr. Fauci"" mental health making rounds TV social media? experts education telling us badly ""lost year"" going affect people long? Somehow completely one-sided, remain locked wear mask notice. lives saved bonus call skepticism. really fear, held place fear-is-profitable-because-of-all-the-repeat-customers media. cancel anybody speaks vaccines masking. things:
1. People vaccinated en masse US well way herd immunity. immunity re-infection spread virus, justify risk health (however minuscule) whatsoever getting vaccine? 

2. live alone WFH, propagating virus 

3. continue wear mask follow guidelines provided CDC 14th amendment nothing private businesses deciding employ. US finally exporting doses neighbour countries means plants EU start delivering elsewhere world

Belgium plant alone capacity produce 1B doses year, mention plants Germany France agree. arguments threshold figures ending certain social restrictions, needs least thresholds existence demand becomes main constraint. bet side based absolutely 0 facts? I’ll take - what’s venmo? stop allowing dumb people decide do. Reuters reported Thursday Pfizer started shipping vaccines made plant Mexico, first time delivered abroad U.S. facilities Trump-era restriction dose exports expired end March. 

So..the export ban ended april 1. wonder delay. “The important quantity” drug substance came American plant, owned Catalent, put vials Italy process known “fill finish,” documents said, let get straight: according you, vaccinated peopel still live restrictions (distancing, masks exc.) people CHOSEN get vaccinated? Right understanding fever/chills/pain etc body fighting effectivelly. chances facing sort ""dose"" wild? People going want risk unmasked activities penalty every possible exposure two days misery effectively-trained immune systems thing.

I'm saying there's anything bad wrong vaccines... I'm saying ""how 'safe' we, vaccinated? Safe serious illness, sure, safe immune systems? high-enough viral load similar effect likely wild?""  It’s gene therapy all. Nothing changing gene. mRNA tell body make spike protein body immune response allows achieve immunity wild virus. free mRNA eventually degraded natural process body degrading recycling mRNA process constantly. would could find freaking appointment Yes. policy since early January. started 90 day delay moved month later 4 month wait period. Pfizer asked ignored. found  fourth time parks closed completely, represent longest closure history.  closed November 25, 1963 part national day mourning President John K. Kennedy, 1994 Northridge earthquake. parks’ last closure September 11th, 2001. single-day closures. Correct, it’s transmissible like COVID, (which requires come contact droplets someone coughing sneezing, breathing). 

What I’m getting at, many people die either preventable diseases narrative “get sunlight, need vitamin D, don’t eat processed food. Get plenty hydration exercise.” 

Instead “stay inside, order grub hub, get shot”.  Ironic stupidity seems cultivated primarily educational system. mean stop normal life can't get flu vaccine... Except rely positive cases 14 day count like it’s gospel. number used would low end estimate. live confused.

You mean getting shot booster shot August instead manufacturer's 3 weeks? grandparents. actually get fairly early on, offered vaccine unrelated doctor's appointment. planning getting all. That's proven false Everywhere get herd immunity, it’s one recognizes formidable natural immunity Early pandemic could allow sympathy people. seriously, kind narcissism people stage, completely ignore thousands reports people suffering Covid. Anymore people crying gave relatives friends flouting restrictions seriously making dig deep empathy store. different economic hardship mental health issues, things like parties different matter deserve sanctions. Right. exactly benefit Canada, benefit world makes Canadian supply chain simpler opens European production capacity people. key statement ""China found"". ""China found"" ""ccp found slang "" BULLSHIT "" ""self-serving information"". heads up. That’s amazing! Definitely response would expect either. It’s good know good bosses there. Totally agree. Look Canada done, even banned citizens.
I like approach US taken still allows citizens families come home. Wishing US citizen. Probably hard-known value like number people vaccinated, estimate true numbers effect. gets old fast. get food make? growing yourself? it’s grocery store it’s exposed people also 100% surfaces thing

Ah, you’re anti-science. makes sense now. It’s though. Covid it’s variants fact life. Indian travel ban nothing, it’s going spread anyways. We’ve got get vaccinated accept Covid never going away. Live risk open everything back don’t die poverty. second injection may delayed advised longer quarantine/isolate. Exactly this. fact, study says Virus cultures negative asymptomatic positive repositive cases, indicating “viable virus” positive cases detected study.

Translation: *not* active infections.

People try use study evidence asymptomatic transmission doesn’t occur simply don’t understand science. vaccine prevents infection transmission. vulnerable non vaccinated people? 

We're talking reopening people want vaccines them, herd immunity reached. Yep college required Actually good point. reported NY Post vaccinated but, right, probably not. sure never get vaccinated.  Ooh, got cheated. got upgraded 6g reception. Surprise surprise surprise did, last June. Many family tree died won’t diminish it. it’s transmissible way airborne disease is. know this- I'm glad getting shot! Sorry harsh. biggest concern is, internet is, even posing questions doubts something like enough sway someone get shot whatever. Gaining trust general populace get vaccinated end horrible situation massive uphill battle and, well, people stupid. many people would read ""do really need second shot?"" think ""well sounds like people questioning I'm gonna hold off."" honestly sure kind message trying send.

I want get political sub. really think many people government want pandemic restrictions go long pass much stimulus possible guise 'we cuz pandemic' otherwise would snowball's chance hell passing congress. 

So message saying even vaccinated, need mask, distance, resume life.  understand viewpoint agree vaccines highly effective reducing severity infection safe people. stated, lowest-risk category, immunity virus already, deemed risk remaining unvaccinated acceptable taking precautions advised government. Ideally, I'd like see 2+ years data. April, Canada getting 1M Pfizer doses per week. Yeah hardly due vaccination 50 year olds kind misses point. question. person gotten vaccine get COVID someone virus? Read words again: ""I believe anything large scale without images videos since cellphones Internet access become popular NOWADAYS. ""

I've already narrow contemporary era.

Maybe heavily underdeveloped countries also excluded rule since mobile devices popular, China India definitely one them. I’d put money whether realized post savethechildren weeks Q accounts got booted platforms co-oped hashtag cause.  Half family’s church posting Q adjacent stuff obliviously. mention Q roll eyes say “do think bearing real world. That’s overblown Democrats.” little unsure people worried ""long term"" effects covid around little year. long term, definition. Sometimes people long term effects illness. Maybe underlying health condition poor treatment knows what. Sure worry kinds things seems like worrying boogeyman.

I agree original point Rogan saying lot people thinking getting criticized it. people freaked idea taking brand new vaccine. personally one part cannot blame them. adults make choice.

There also people think young healthy probably get covid even problem them. admit one people. saw affecting least bit worried getting year. know people got recovered without problem. Yes understand ""just flu"" never worried it.

So get coming from. Unfortunately public figure indirectly encouraging people get vaccine. one hand sure would great 100% people took it. always dream. vaccine ever taken 100% people even 70% 80% would really good. always thought going top around 60-65% looking like what's going happen. Pfizer deliveries increasing April though. April 1M doses per week, May 2M June 2.4M. schedule known \~2 weeks now. push comes shove would probably take it

I'm eligible 25, due fathers illnesses. doctor on-site advised strongly taking AZ vaccine. reluctant give me, said signed waiver would administer it. waiver doctors recommendation. Maybe couple weeks, we'll solid advice, along look for. sub since beginning Plus people died cancer 2019 COVID 2020. Thankfully not, looks like I'll keeping way! state? Basically every southern state surplus vaccines variety reasons. Might drive outside major urban areas another county get one, almost easy get vaccination appointments. J&amp;J AstraZeneca viral vector vaccines MRNA like Pfizer Moderna. think found people clots J&amp;J already Covid which...causes clots. Sweet pirate bussy Yeah I'm pretty sure Trump didnt include ""if country past 14 days cannot fly US anywhere"" part. help prevent people flying another nation banned first. People like threat free speech. Read articles post.  Stop repeating BS. article using SII name doesn’t mean they’re SII. US 60m doses AZ varies stages production US didn’t order SII. AZ doses SII know, AZ production sites direct subcontractors isn’t SII.   Early Q3 think production comes online France too. US least (which article talking about), vaccinations open adults states week 2 ago. areas may issues lots people want them, especially southern states states rural population, basically anyone wants one get one month now. Simply rural and/or red state is, higher % population refuses vaccine. common Asia wear masks everywhere always.  sure hear this. They'd wear feeling ill situations, always thing. 4 infected vaccinated people 9 million? Sounds like non issue. vaccine 100% effective, reduce spread low numbers I'd say everything working well possibly could. Say something goes wrong student gets vaccine. Would school face legal consequences decision?   true. familiar DUI laws?  That's wrong lol I'd love vaccine passports. know controversial here, another surge happens, keep businesses open pretty safely them, rather hoping people coming covid positive. would also encouragement get jab. escapes vaccines, going get eventually anyway.

Besides, moderna Pfizer seem confident pivot mrna vaccines quickly soon new variant sequenced. question fda approval speed point. I’m assuming. doubt it’s loan US won’t need vaccines soon doubt selling optics wouldn’t great. mention whistleblower protection. Anything’s possible think so, court define waht pandemic is. Yeah. fact America supposed another wave right looks decently blunted tells lot vaccines. start almost $18 COL fairly low. pandemic profoundly changed view fellow humans. simply cannot understand wanton behavior people willing risk death many people greatest economic recession modern times.

If people believe right socially destructive behavior, society needs come hard people protect vulnerable mock made effort reducing contacts preventing infection. lmao crazy think going brunch equated outright murder last year. sheesh comment removed because

Spot checking colleges either attended family attend, mention much plans fall.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  This. tough call health standpoint. tough call political standpoint. Maybe already mentioned, CA Public universities require COVID-19 Vaccinations. know that, Covidshield name AZ vaccine made Serum Institute India. US basically saying ""we'll divert order stay India.""  scientific evidence this. might true, anecdotal now. Thank you!   time... got downvoted day daily discussion. makes sense, need protect progress made help others. fair. mean way. Sorry unintended offense.

I probably said, students Brazil India. meant regional issue, specific race. Simply countries suffering terribly covid.

Does help? China always gets praised ability suppress virus, can't think regime better fits description ""autocratic nationalist"" right now.

The likely connection big, diverse countries hard govern prone social division, leads dissatisfied populations electing leaders tough guy personas (despite largely making libertarıan policy decisions). Big countries almost invariably shocking case death numbers reasons obvious. Unfortunately, analysis allow kind political point-scoring.

An *actual* autocratic regime (as opposed merely leader LARPs dictator) massive advantage pandemic. things democracies can't do. Likewise, leader wanted take full control crush opposition, pandemic perfect opportunity so.

EDIT:

Another factor socially divided countries tend populations people trust other, leads people displaying kind selfish attitudes we've seen US last year. Let’s see Anti-Vaxxers survive free market without college degree 😎 COVID never going away. IIRC it’s actually time elapsed benchmarks. hope means won’t actually wait four months second dose. I’m scheduled august. means approved, accelerated approval, orphan drug designations approval comment replied Save administrative stuff, depending infected, vaccine would either help least somewhat nothing. translation? evidence strain fully escaped vaccines kinda late right?

Just trying cautious real possiblity. Proactive vs reactive  you’re saying they’re 50% total population coverage still haven’t made rabble eligible? I’m surprised. can’t tell you’re joking don’t realize already thing. point level death society finds acceptable quickly approaching COVID. especially true widely available vaccine. Yes sucks people can't vaccinated, society stop them. So? They're hurting people choose get vaccinated point. perfectly reasonable look people openly always prioritize everyone else, even inconvenience helping everyone else extremely low benefits high. selfish sense argue rational decision. Community health requires young people get vaccinated herd immunitu.....and long term effects getting vaccine. 70, people say herd immunity 

How know? 

For example, SF Bay Area already reached 70% lease one dose. top that, natural immunity. top that, there's still restrictions. 

In San Francisco, seven day average cases right basically (1 case higher) mid-March.  airline attendants tasked determining fully vaccinated not, needs mask doesn't? People put big boy pants wear mask till we're thing. Kind point, suppose. Maybe could like New Zealand, Americans proved: masking travel vaccine adoption, absolutely take right steps. already know there's solid 20% adults alone intentions getting vaccines. According report Haaretz, 24 COVID-19 positive people, found infected B.1.617 variant, per several experts, maybe infectious variants. people infected Indian coronavirus variant returned recently abroad, officials said. waiting India send Reddit takedown letter.

🤣 Fortunately it’s college parents aren’t nearly important TSA done anything useless reactionary theater? think technically moot say kids get school year opens. Surprised Canada first (considering economic interests).  Hello fellow Redditor.

I'm sure understood parable Schrödenger's Cat, used explain concept superposition quantum mechanics. see applies news article.

If I'm incorrect please redditor correct me. Glad still us watermelon friend Let’s see pans Miss well Canada! Ottawa trip last year got covided. Older people getting vaccinated explain younger people getting infected/hospitalized higher clip. real question is: Mike Stoklasa replacing Rich Evans' diabetes medication? big concern second doses want make sure immune response first dose died enough get proper ""boosting"" response. concern, then, taking second dose early; part, minor fluctuations delaying second dose really harm. low key might wear mask pandemic lmfao, feel like goes well outfit. getting common cold flu seems like plus me! wear mask? Easy. Especially winter 15 can't vaccinated yet. They'll move up. 4 months sure supply would come fast enough. sit millions doses July keep 4 month gap. Second doses going start accelerating July end doubt people wait 16 weeks. supposed continue increase rate vaccinations reached 500% Americans vaccinated? We've hit almost half eligible adults, obviously we'll begin slow down. India decline, Emperor Modi declined would easier sell 90%+ effective, past 15 years best 60% effective worst 10%. understanding established COVID, rather based understanding cases may husband calls stomach upset ""the flu."" Drives nuts. still better booster longer protection variants. Even small losses efficacy mean vaccine stops working significantly faster. Additionally symptomatic spread may become common situation. worth getting every year strain got shot for, might closely related next bug causing pandemic. Partial immunity thing.

This even healthy people get shot. Like zombie apocalypse. Another gun couple cans food always appreciated shit hit fan. flu shot extra gun. became symbols safety; **markers virtue**

Boy ain't truth people using treating moralizing shifted behavior purely rational grounds intense back — horror mask-free life today.

Oh. actually make Wearing mask much public wearing condom, role model. there’s cost too: people see no-one liberated vaccine, they’ll less likely get one. leaving masks behind fruit vaccination, people party want join.

Oh okay gets point everyone sub making.

It's interesting. CDC flopped response AIDS crisis 80s latter stages Covid, they're continuing flop. got second shot Tuesday. Absolutely wrecked morning fever subside.

10/10 worth it, would needed. Ugghhh. can't stand either one. then, old enough remember time AIDS, condoms something used get pregnant, - unless taking Pill. 

I'll wearing mask indoors for....however long takes. Putting date like ""June"" ""July"" stupid. (Mark you, that's argument Biden. ""July 4th barbeque!"" thing utterly idiotic face pandemic.)

When shed indoors? damn virus worked type cold; burned way becoming *completely* deadly. work medicine. alone gives right keep ""wearing"". kidding. Hearing friends 20 years older still we're done 2 weeks already... thanks, people poor risk analysis tracking pays it. They're still getting money. depends insurance federal government.

Not saying can't make messaging better (they definitely can), clarifying. actually happening. person motivated enough get first dose says “meh that’s good enough”?

I got first dose second dose different places, know multiple people gotten two doses different states. highly doubt numbers able match doses individuals. states, hope normalizes use masks one sick. hard little selfless slow spread virus one go public sick. matter flu rona. think possibly maybe unvaccinated employees may slightly affect profitability stability company many get infected miss weeks worth work. true. world full people looking someone think them; wasn't, would Joe Rogan who? Jordan Peterson who? Donald Trump who? etc may may case come July. Again, wait see. truly South's middle finger reaching up... 
And cities. China blame overblown illness? 43.5% Iowa bad. However, many church goers get vaccinated. right here. Sums OK, totally serious question: ""the gripping hand"" reference Pournelle/Niven novels, non-English words flu (such French grippe, Spanish gripe, German Grippe)? contexts? wish could ""It's like Polio bro"" campaign instead...  far know hasn’t reduced capacity run standard diagnostic tests. Clinical labs reported nearly 100,00 flu tests CDC since September. positive rate 0.2%. Normally like 20-30%. flu spreading much years past testing limited positivity rate would sky high since testing would reserved likely flu. person sick enough get hospitalized they’re going confirm diagnosis. There’s even tests check seasonal flus COVID time specifically used surveillance spread flu. mention, story happened world. It’s beyond reasonable doubt flu spreading always escaped Interesting numbers pan out. Ok.

I want ask end goal powerful cabal data manipulators?

Converting flu deaths covid matters because...? Yup, disagreements here

I know people scared even go outdoors COVID.

Shit would say people type. First months pandemic see body streets parks manhattan

Yeah, got that. think grip/gripe likely reference here. heck, might even particularly clever multi-referential pun. Yeahhhh Thanks H3H3 podcasting 👏🏼 Nice *You* need accept actually no, people *won't* become infected. 

Those people agitated public health measures, either selfishness misguided believe 'everyone get it' need understand horrific death toll played part causing. Ok that's figured. Thanks  understand, 5-11 year olds' vaccine might approved August. ones 6 months probably next year. % France obese? Like 1%?? we’re closed, that’s point. don’t understand think we’re going “0”. *please let flu go away*!!!!!!  can’t anything prayer you.. hope gets well soon 🙏🏻  No. Plenty countries pushed pfizer 2nd doses 12 weeks 1st dose. true. vaccinated, asymptomatic transmission extremely low.  Got tested 3 times week last 6 months never checked flu strep anyone unless sick didn’t pop Covid test. Nice expert insight here.  risk sounding dumb- how?

Bearable weather. Yeah, US finally turning corner conquering Covid issues come one worst hit countries bring variants you.

Makes sense. different times old narrative. There's lot research disputes points. last month, US UK released data shows pfizer superior variants effective one dose. Interesting WA hasn’t anywhere near cases RSV east coast had, presumably border closures really helped that.

The interesting one Australia massive spike Gastroenteritis cases child care, caused people using hand sanitizer instead washing hands soap, realising hand sanitizer doesn’t kill gastroenteritis, it’s transmitted everywhere 

If look [surveillance data things reduction, quite infections massive spikes, like Ross River virus, Zoonotic diseases, things like Yeah, last 15 years I’ve never sick, don’t wash hands really work eat food floor.

I'm 100% board outside eating outdoors. Honestly, advantages job done home. really work personal levels safety based whole lot factors able trial error lot things. Avoiding parties, events, grocery store lot heavy lifting - oh, kids. Never caught covid never quarantine scare.

You'll okay. think mental health needs focus virus vaccinated slowly acclimating society summer safest way it. current college student trust me, nothing it. moved apartment back parents peak summer kids still partying like nothing changed vaccinating fast, wave hopefully going short one. There's lot there, course still early. here's one  Maybe that's we're disinfecting surfaces like crazy, still failing mitigate airborne transmission.

Ironic, 100 years Spanish flu solve problem different pandemic. neighbour North, shots gotta get India first fast.

Sincerely, Canadian still waiting shot isolating home past year. Bullshit. Utter bullshit. Quite possibly, except us categories mentioned. It’s also caring self though. Everyone needs get vaccinated adaptable disease. currently least 5 variations surges, lockdowns, deaths starting happen places appeared everything right this. Yes, vaccines. I’ve Covid received Pfizer. original comment advocated vaccines well. comment redundant best.

The point antibodies one way another move past this. 99% population die. mean mild. flat wrong.  Right? people extremely they’ll get counterfeit cards, sure. people say fuck decide it’s easier get free vaccine going steps buying making fake card. Yea, same. Every time one patients (we're still getting form MIS-C), makes furious. SHH watermelons talking Lazy very, pets caught living positive human family 24/7, haven’t gotten sick. don’t think would much risk quick sniff legs/feet, article, it. wouldn’t want put face face positive patient extended time, though. Why? two 30 something coworkers good health, yes mean normal BMI, exercise, etc (one always talking “hitting macros”, ffs), COVID19 kicked asses. One got long covid year resolved got vaccines. Shocked. slight majority. steep drop good. well compared what/where? Exactly. truly great interviews best minds time. really dumb ones too. large number doses discarded due expiration human error

Citation needed one - see 1 2 million, that's still &lt; 5%. Lol. I’m happy green spine Vermont wanted brag 42 bpm resting heart rate.

Just kidding. Feel better. flu never eradicated, mutates fast animal reservoirs. least know stop flu pandemic ever happens. wearing mask washing hands kills it. Teacher here. announced today likely still wearing masks fall.

Obviously I'm one person, I've usually gotten sick least twice point kids 3-4 times. oldest got one cold preschool. Otherwise we've healthy since pandemic began. amazing! There’s another one chose from. read direct quotes get it.  Osheaga? Upvoted visibility. Lots info know, thanks.  Airlines need make $$$. usually defined mild case. Others similar definitions linked anything short hospitalized mild. meant 80% mild. Stop you? Sounds like tool. Congratulations Joe. Good choice. Always continue *now* fan. clarify many young people tough time, mean life changing effects contracting virus. *America entered chat* Even what's quoted article, Rogan walk back. He's continuing propagate myth young healthy, COVID harmless vaccine unnecessary health. also called criticism said ""clickbait"". future mother law want daughter get vaccinated dad scared get vaccinated case causes infertility. 

Honestly, began question science one point two intelligent households scared vaccines. thought going crazy telling future parents-in-law parents vaccines safe take them. 

I'm still going get vaccinated turn. believe science doubt biological knowledge others choose believe conspiracy theories.  fair, January handful reported cases beginning rear ugly head, language “don’t panic let’s see happens be, deal contagious/deadly diseases like flu alright enough, likely okay too”

That 100% evolved later people dismissing risk established monster downplaying virus equating nothing flu. 


But think it’s fair acknowledge first way people panic. really terrifying first nothing making sense everyone trying rationalize means coping. 


Also, long long time many people truly realize annual devastating impact flu, early quotes well think bringing attention health systems ability manage disease annual basis without society collapsing. 

Anyways I’m saying “just flu” well aware. think it’s bit dismissive cause think people used language cases assholes trying subvert public good ways lot understandable makes sense. would argue Lebron’s influence reach great three. anything says taken gospel followers makes relevant comparison. Profit Fauci Pfizer investment. course. could give us another stimulus payment $600 whatever proof vaccination. We'd reach herd immunity instantly. straw bullsh#t ""self-defense"" training does. Saw video clip Survivor literally engages contestant physically verbal exchange. Self defense? knuckle-dragger ITCHING ATTACK OTHERS. literally chomping bit. He's full sh#t, comes surprise he's anti mask, anti vaccine. guy giant douche, horrifies many idiots listen roided up, failed comedian.  agree. fact *has* audience large proves responsibility audience. Instead accepting responsibility says he's moron pretends there.  surprise? mean think ppl. silly wanting get vaccinated. data pointed public opinion slanted vaccine rate 3/10. 
It isn’t surprising US creeps 50% start get natural asymptotic curve approaching mark. 

But given natural infection rate combined vaccinations effectiveness vaccines showcased news. hopefully continue move needle towards 70%

I don’t like reporting something shocking fairly well documented via surveys slow would come. pretty much said fuck weeks back rumblings coworkers wanting get together and/or travel work facilities said need vaccinated enter. imagine customers require visitors vaccinated enter well. (Sales)

Get 2nd shot next Wednesday. first question going be: go I'm referring Uni taught think critically, learning differences Primary Secondary sources, biased sources read them, write unbiased Thesis, empathy races cultures, learning history countries religions.

Maybe needed college learn that, nobody go college learn that.  Bill Maher dick he's much better informed Rogan topics covers. Nobody puts Jocko corner. Corona infectious would think depends fast return sanitizing everything time. think us better. Personally could see wearing mask least awhile covid completely gone. imagine there's lot places going like 'well time money spend money cleaning supplies, great'

So I'd say going localized. seems common cop-out comedians. 

As much loved show bothered often Jon Stewart would say ""I'm comedian, journalists"" and, technically true, always felt like take pride it. Rogan feels like he's become bizaro version that. Jordan Pederson Trump best examples? Eh, think Pederson good any. Trump might be, he's terrible example. (Rogan's reason inclusion obvious). LeBron objectively terrible example. LeBron is, first foremost, sportsmen. recognition fame gets magnitudes greater gets talking head (so speak). Pederson, Trump, Rogan? Can't sane them. want get rid masks? way talk CDC then. outline multiple scenarios vaccinated people go unmasked indoors: That's Tom Brady, actually. Asshole shitty company took PPP money &amp; used workaround get paid extra Pats.  way, he's mixture two. introduces new quacks like Oprah did: ""Drs"" Oz Phil, stupidly large fanbase, covers sorts topics daytime television way pretends expert.

Oprah surrounded scammers whereas Rogan seems part it. feel like Oprah's scam show itself. Rogan drinking Koolaid sells. That’s news me, although it’s opinion one doctor.

That said I’d love right wrong one. sooner kids get jabs better. think would great everybody chose go selfless route thing would benefit everybody tit head get Vaccinated not? Im gonna go former. They'll 'hug Indian'' day . I’ve seen really isn’t much issue. remember last Joe Rogan show went - back Tom opening newbie. uncomfortable general demographics people. 

So many testosterone fueled meat heads. People bro-ish. 

I've lots shows previously watched podcast beginning. always seen diverse group people. I'm bit older side - I've following since late nineties. crowd weird aggressively lacking intelligence.

There definitely line seemed draw one type person.  Istanbul? Seems oddly specific go gay saunas. charge smoking surcharge mandate vaccinations many employers. obesity exercise far complicated getting free shot two.  Since getting vaccinated, alternate irrational fear clear throat versus things feeling normal forget grab mask leaving car go shopping  Yup even Columbus, I’m in, I’m frustrated lack precautions you... fudge truth... get second shot somewhere got first, saying it’s first? messaging 2 years [**2023-04-30 01:42:28 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2023-04-30%2001:42:28%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

Edit: seriousness, good luck everything! stop following Stop making excuses people take basic responsibilities. sounds similar mine, lasted 5.5 weeks. Took 8 months get close full lung capacity too. Actually 2 answers. One answer year second shot, next April, take blood last time stop recording efficacy antibodies that. still go back two times next year monitor safety make sure long term effects. Literally everyone know waited 4 months, given appointment 4 months out... officially policy, myth, rumor. Google search, stop spreading misinformation. Yeah I'm gonna stay inside months. See fall. Cause dirty, snot covered children kept away. reason flu season beginning school year happen time Bill Gates medical doctor either. saying. high school hand sanitizer around years point today’s day age media spouting every single opinion every subject, going hold listener least mostly responsible decisions? Joe Rogan says everyone walk cliff still people complaining maybe people actually based said? need cancel everyone willing conversation that’s recorded voluntarily?  Yeah still said ""I said young people get it."" That's walking back ANYTHING I'm American. Yet, spouts ideas like expert. refuses take responsibility role has. obligation reach level pretends like doesn't. says he's journalist plays one podcast without sort actual research. 

""Don't listen me, here's advice."" 

Screw morons listen him. Yup! Going 4 months now. Everything taste like garlic  read, flu significant asymptomatic spreading disease well, Covid precautions basically made extremely difficult flu spread People skipping second shot afraid symptoms get, little bonkers. Uh, cool. get tested flu every time assuming?

They likely bad colds. people get flu twice every decade Yeah, mine seems reported primary care doc I've received first dose. I've received both, second one almost 3 months ago. Exactly right. mean... going apologize better right, anything else insulting. would better shut hell since least calling audience morons lol, New Jersey ftw! remind pus-filled wound. question?
Does meams vírus dont automatisms faster mutation?
Or, didnt encounter right condirions, yet? Yes is. point vaccine collaboration pfizer, American company. can't get mad someone calling American say German. vaccine result international collaboration. Got second Sinovac dose 8 hours ago, side effects besides mild headache. waits little bit thing concerns hospital beds left. stays home, basically impossible catch Covid right? Also idea crowded vaccine clinics pretty much guaranteed people distancing. think greatly relying vaccines. certainly policies put place, far goes, United States really good vaccine rollout.  1. comment seens imply Brazil coutnries like us western. West definition word tailored include wasps only. speak western european language, religious background church west, culture dissimilar latin europeans (albeit ethnically culturally mixed) sure orient.
2. multiple vaccine acquisition contracts underway, western developers, including Sinovac (API comes China, processed Butantan São Paulo), Oxford (foreign API, processed Fiocruz Rio), Pfizer (first imported shipment came today), J&amp;J (waiting) Sputnik (maybe anymore). problem really incredibly incompetent government denied sign contract Pfizer last August, gravely delaying vaccination program putting us horrible situation now.

Also, OP: lower quality simplification chinese vaccine. Sinovac, example, inactivated vaccine, expected lower efficacy, sufficient vaccination, could lead us herd immunity, least seeing signs mortality reduction elderly, much important metric efficacy symptomatic infection. Also, product much better side-effect profile, also relevant trying reach vaccine-skeptic crowd. yeah, Sputnik V dropping ball hard denying info regulatory agency acting like angry teen twitter. absolutely brutal there. Here's TIME explains got point. Wow lend car seat? need go India.  Yes that’s we’re planning vaccine holding baby social distancing enforced. won’t going anyone’s houses. mil asked said didn’t know we’re yet (this months ago) “good didn’t want vaccine!” Like ummmm feel like would’ve lied required it. aren’t vocal yet we’re exactly doing. think I’m beginning we’re staying home visitors first month visitation outside social distanced vaccinated. depends cases outbreaks too. it’s air lol flu nearly contagious COVID. social distancing masking definitely impact flu cases.

As deaths, even flu deaths misdiagnosed COVID deaths, talking 30,000 less assuming COVID mitigation impact flu.

Also yearly numbers flu deaths diagnosed cases. use statistical analysis come multiplication factors estimate deaths. actual diagnosed flu deaths per year generally thousands tens thousands.  write book one kick real good get air. make felony crime forge cards - let's see law order crowd then. thing seems happening viral vector-based vaccines seen COVID infections too. Keeping eye early identification treatment protocols this. That's asked adding nothing helpful. That's asked adding nothing helpful. We're near threshold this, achieved yet. trying prevent death, deadly virus running around reason started locking everything first place. COVID gave really rough ride fatal shutting it, we'd calling interesting flu variant keep eye on.

Pegging end restrictions high vaccination rate prove fool's errand, though. Hospitalizations deaths fall bad year flu hit 70% vaccination mark, especially considering there's 3% gap population says refuse vaccinated percent people needed hit mask removal mark. people realize COVID killing sending people ICU, point happens, they're going pissed they're still back normal. Yes. No, give false positive, worth getting tested days anyways give virus time build (if you) detectable level. choice also want get tested now, getting tested days also important. That's walking back, that's basically standard disclaimer can't, local authorities acting prevent even spread. like African hospitals would let entire family touch bathe Ebola-stricken relative. (This creating new cluster Ebola cases.)

We're Bronze Age anymore. Get people grieve responsibly without causing exponential grief everyone around infecting them... Recent variants targeting younger younger patients. Right average age infection Florida 34. Every week seems go year (in Florida). Children catch COVID seem asymptomatic, get fevers, sore throats, runny noses. **They pass parents caregivers.** Whether agree not, one individual kind power. She’s taken away freedoms way get back comply demands?  I'm really curious they'll able develop better flu shots mRNA technology sorry, turbo sucks Weirdos? guess depends live, remember hearing anyone 65 receiving flu shot. I'd guess even among elderly vaccinated minority. Well Yellow Card scheme place pick incidents, seems UK problem registration.

As said, anomaly data UK, 20 countries seen less pattern banned restricted accordingly.

Of course case may UK vaccine different facility problems compared rest Europe, still mystery people working health sector literally contries sincerely hope gap UK data, seems weird lots countries wrong, UK right. time tell. can't say evidence for. know sure trying correct misunderstanding. uphill battle.

Hostpitals (mostly private owned) declaring lot cases COVID related since get significant reimbursement sum government cover costs, kind like insurance scam everyone's onboard it.

Person walks hospital mild symptom/flu/injury whatever, hospital tells sign COVID thing, gets free treatment, hospital gets additional funds, politicians get cuts.

Edit: Poor third-world country. Even exist happen them. Uh... good? Headline buries lead, get vaccinated game get free hotdog! Lmaoooo numbers support anecdote? saying kids permanently injured MIS-C?

And business healthcare provider covered HIPAA requesting provide vaccine card. 

If they're requesting healthcare provider, yes need authorization.


(**I'm aiming cunty tone, lol clear) much American German. Pfizer 100% American company working BioNTech since beginning. Look total number deaths 2020 compared previous years—just counting toe tags—and it’s shocking. *something* definitely killing lots people. 

 Yikes, getting flu shot? Sure that's true. point late current wave. Mine like moderate cold. Congestion, non-stop runny nose, sneezing, clear mucus. thing made think cold sense smell went away completely. went CVS got test came back positive. congestion cleared up, still sense smell couple weeks. came back gradually, lot things smell like ""Covid"" me. weird burnt chemical/garbage smell happens certain scents like coffee soap. sucks go eat drink something like taste/smell Covid... remember back 2019 like 4 subreddits, people saying know people government told they're running grid cabins years. hatchet bed fight anyone wanted take bags rice, beyond paranoid. scary times. According Joe Rogan fans, everything says perfectly rational reasonable.
Until point saying something like this, he’s comedian shouldn’t take seriously. ""I'm respected source information, even ... least try honest I'm saying.""

Then get f'n air.


JFC Joe ever system place could actually used show proof vaccination? I'm 30 morbidly obese lost sense smell two weeks runny nose couple hours.

All else equal, 70% effective vaccine, risk catching COVID 50000 cases day vaccinated vs. 15000 cases day unvaccinated.

On relative basis, exposure risk trumps vaccine efficacy day week. That's herd immunity important. know genetic mutation works? Never heard mutations you? virus mutating quickly mutate even faster people get vaccinated kill kids adults lots people.

/s (I went too, bad, certainly nothing wish worst enemies) may rare side effect article saying getting vaccine affect cycle. ludicrous. selfish point view ultimately self defeating. Mask mandates indoors allow children safely go indoors, along vaccines doesn’t work for. Mask mandates indoors also help prevent unvaccinated infecting creating aggressive variants. answer frustration needing wear masks isn’t give up. answer get unvaccinated actually get vaccinated. Every time feel frustrated follow Covid related restriction, remember unvaccinated population forcing that. Dude INDIA saw 360,000 new cases today. entire thing fascinating.

Yeah, side though, anti vaxxers much higher chance inflict major FSD spreading damage though. Luckily need AZ Covid's long incubation period good thing. reason possible eliminate Covid NZ numerous countries. flu mitigation strategy possible can't trace quarantine people become infectious, simply enough time. 

Flu also mainly spread droplets, much lower R0 rate Covid, primarily airborne. 6 hours (Moderna). count cross state? know (was?) lot vaccine tourism, especially near state borders. Lots DC folks went MD VA get MD VA rural areas DC have. Though beginning opposite true due people working district lived outside it.

I'm guessing example. Im sure metro areas crossed state lines likely happened fairly commonly, too. cases plummet 20k, Biden announce going back normal 100%.

Put pressure places want reopen August later. Yeah, major bummer. could point excess death last year 10/10 pharmacists/technicians would recommend drink alcohol getting vaccine. Far COVID, Flu shots. worked near large university. So, college kids clientele talk.

They’re going screw everything us trying right thing. Who’s disagreeing here? many, unfortunately. still around course, foolish think otherwise. I'd never report flu - others millions Americans. Everyone needs chill false information claims op.  wonder Sam Rhonda think not, fact asymptomatic covid still spread it, probably touching surface touching nose mouth... elite athletes struggled long-term effects Covid actual fuck talking about? I’m legit copy/pasting CDC website:

If you’ve fully vaccinated:

You gather indoors fully vaccinated people without wearing mask staying 6 feet apart.
You gather indoors unvaccinated people age one household (for example, visiting relatives live together) without masks staying 6 feet apart, unless people anyone live increased risk severe illness COVID-19.
You gather conduct activities outdoors without wearing mask except certain crowded settings venues. It’s amazing watching gears turn people’s heads point disappearance flu, can’t explain rise pneumonia coronavirus-related deaths. Listen, really dumb, going tell want hear, going believe it. late. He's winking camera whenever says that. It’s always curious people care much opinions. listen cause he’s one beat interviewing people random topics. I’m guest, really We’re pretty well - wouldn’t say it’s desperate need here.

We’re really well Quebec vaccines. think approved people hadn’t trial that, randomly assigning 1 shot vs 2 shot. people assigned 1 shot, I’m sure make come back second shot placebo. said syringes longer taped block view what’s syringe. surely isn’t double blinded. amazing people think us country actually exists one look India.... menstrual irregularities indeed might rare vaccine side effect. (I reading today, I’ve got start bookmarking things find again.) hypothesis it’s physical stress mounting immune response vaccine. wouldn’t shock. get irregular cold. definition medical community basing mild/moderate/severe oxygen requirements. yes many people know . HOWEVER lot . Asking insurance mentioning free ads unneeded barrier poor messaging ""early adopters"" gotten shots.

These people reached means reached FB (or even reddit ) Ad. message sent ,,,is going cost somehow cause say bring insurance card. (and viewer either insurance or..has high deductible)  

It mass media messaging problem adverstisement design problem know *everyone* gets vaccine, indeed nobody get virus.

Vaccine induced herd immunity. Measles R0 18 - yet almost nobody even exposed, let alone infected. Canada getting bunch Moderna shortly, thankfully: hopefully people Moderna (like parents) get second Moderna instead mixing.

Hopefully reduces little let sleep tonight :(


Doing part holy crap body liking it. Lol got seriously sick one time flu life, ok
Covid totally different, know people recover fast personally I'm really sure come conclusion.

The one heard ""The government pays better COVID flu cases, hospitals billing flu deaths COVID deaths extra money.""

I hung someone first time life heard one. work healthcare. IIUC places laws specifically protect stuff like HIV status that, historically, basis utterly irrational prejudices.

So mean, there's precedent. irrationally prejudice nowhere near comparable yet. alone, friend. Where's substantial body evidence shows additional efficacy 2nd shot?

Because regardless length (some degree of) immunity, efficacy number matters fast end pandemic. Doctor straight tell get yearly flu vaccine Yeah, put away motorcycles while, really justify adding level risk already high risk activity. Thanks would rather wrong one lol.  

I’m glad I’m one people that’s got done. think great teams promoting vaccination, understand people going game great way get people out. life can't fathom unvaccinated fans allowed game/mass gathering. Seems best thing would offer free tickets second shot....or promotion (of course going attract people lazy go get shot)....but makes sense unvaccinated people allowed sort mass gathering.

Edit: live life ever get JRE he’ll try convince everyone got COVID bad cause already-weakened immune system from.... training, antibiotics, bad cold, working late nights, whatever. Right? lol BAD flu weeks ago. toddler gave whole fam. (not corona, vaccinated) Around pharmacy/big box chains signs every year advertising “free flu shot” basically bill insurance whatever they’ll agree pay. may provision affordable care act act, sure. 

My problem less cost (due insurance coverage) forcing take time go. Basically kids made sure start getting help keep safe. covid variants? Moderna block infection completely vast majority cases? Anyways thinking start go restaurants, clubs, maybe travel aboard. ok fully vaccinated or? Enwaille Legault asti continue comme ça, c’est de même qu’on aime ça yes think goes ways, one friend lives 3rd world country received Astra Zeneca Chinese vaccine, strong disinformation campaign Chinese vaccine point people would wait get Astra Zeneca get vaccine all. would spread rumors like 4000 people got serious ill many died street Chinese vaccine, even photoshopped pictures shows bodies street says people took Chinese vaccine.

I'm sure started disinformation campaign, effective. don’t hear anyone say covid harmless you’re young healthy. says that? wife managed pick too. 2nd 3rd flu cases urgent care went seen 4 months.

Fucking miserable shit, flu is. spike like every year. RSV.  go “oilier thou” I'd say many people forced views literally every direction vast majority cases vaccine blocks infection completely.

The covid variants? Moderna block infection completely vast majority cases? Anyways thinking start go restaurants, clubs, maybe travel aboard. ok fully vaccinated or? Tony Fauci also assigned funds level 4 virology lab wuhan many labs gain function research, Clear conflict interest says lab leak theory true Thank Jim Justice droplet vs airborne. different. 100k dying everyday? serious?

Considering death rate 1% among infected (which higher side), infections India would need 10 Million day, suggested death rate. rate 3 months -every single living Indian (half 28 years - avg age India) would infected! 

I know people like say deaths undercounted India, disagree, let's stop rational here.

A accurate estimate, albeit higher side, might 2 3 times official count - might close 10k day. (Cries Brazilian, we're still suffering vaccine shortages) Ya, dad got covid back July barely noticing taste food little bit still can't smell well otherwise.

It interesting see true long term effects weird.

Got vax glad part solution. Flu say? Surely mean COVID? “The cruelty point”  Yes, got first Moderna shot 4/9. seems like issue worsened since. get second shot next Friday. issue platform. say ""I'm soldier, I'm fucking moron"" would legitimately concerned like ""ok, stop swinging machine gun around then?""

He say whatever wants, kind power, topic contention millions lives literally stake, regardless label yourself, responsibility say stupid shit. legal responsibility? Maybe not, sure ethical one.

Why get vaccine? A) natural immunity might less targeted, B) cost benefit analysis indicates right thing do, C) dont get sick. Thank posting this. I’m way deep end ignorance pool here. Could trouble please share exactly would google learn this? definitely changed though. got progressively wealthy famous, views changed lot. Sign up. reaction well Since seem pinpointed started caring people think opinions, maybe could tell us. I’ve listening podcast like 7 years he’s always said “people shouldn’t listen me, I’m idiot.” 

Let us know.   Efficacy closer 90% Moderna Pfizer actual use, still amazing. vaccines high. Joe Rogan Gwenyth Paltrow monster energy dude bros. used watch podcast, ever since got filthy rich, ESPECIALLY since covid, became utterly insufferable. claims idiot excuses says, clearly knows level influence dudes, lot ignorant, privileged views. addition card, provider entered state’s digital vaccine database (so primary dr could look print copy needed it). similar thing live? makes think last year. 14 months lungs feel like I'm permanent state mild asthma attack. got sick horrible side lasted week, coughing pink shit month afterwards. felt somewhere 40% 80% lung function since.

That's exactly happened originally November lockdown--the original variant shrank away, UK variant increasing share infections first sign spreading much faster overtaking restrictions.

That said, case make speculative especially strong, certainly suggest vaccinated people danger infection severe disease. two UK papers often see talking covid, guardian one often overblows risks scare stories covid (while conversely telegraph downplays covid overblown scare stories restrictions). best sort look they're saying wait scientifically backed sources, really.

Something posting anti-Chinese/vaccine propaganda. 

Oh well. wish right could march side let jump rest us live peace  People behaving normally, without consideration it. Statistically chances issues low shouldn’t really worry. Don’t know you’re downvoted. don’t quarantine known contact, test, test comes back positive, right thing bunch islands. Fascinating worked well Great, thanks this! grandma India got first dose vaccine. afraid get second shot afraid get covid going vaccination center since cases high. Right never leaves home groceries items come washed. take 2nd dose vaccine? China still sending sinopharm doses (500k shipments better nothing)

we'll get 2m sputnik doses next month.

we can't really blame india holding AZ doses ordered, need atm actually helped us vaccinate vulnerable 10% early on.

we need J&amp;J doses ordered tho, send single dose despite ordering year ago. Yup. couldn’t get flu test Covid test sick last March. someone believe government capable faking pandemic (which would involve bribing/threatening millions doctors, nurses hospital workers), trouble believe numbers fake. No. containment measures taken largely effective something less infectious covid. almost par Pfizer US afaik. Vaccine production seems economy scale, right scale small go fast recieve larger orders Europe. It’s 50% new things would reopening? They’re opening capacity even more. Broadway still dead, masks still indoors. 

What want? 51% 52%? work Manhattan team planning going back July 1st.  hope doors wide enough..Sometimes can’t get in. It’s strange 100 days herd immunity India guess 🙄

Let’s hope peak breaks soon absolutely true also lead flu cases counted covid. Idiots! time proud, time pragmatism believe Quebec almost 5% ahead rest country probably two weeks ahead still Joe Rogan ""Goop"" men. Yes agree. convince them? put energy resources something beneficial instead wasting result.

I’m saying give today, even soon, eventually can’t keep trying help people won’t helped. money effort go better use. Nice see testing strategy reliable. opens lots possibilities. exactly China's angle discrediting Pfizer shot? hoping one notices Fosun-BioNTech shit eventually start using it? Liquid occasionally track needle injections given. self injections migraines often lose medicine way shot still it’s job time. don’t side effects could get antibody test. going gym vaccinated: gyms Oregon require masking, distancing, reduced capacity sanitizing equipment user. date: one confirmed case transmission Oregon fitness facility. healthy, fit people avoid worst effects Covid get it. US banned travel India yet

Seems dangerous popular theory amongst coofers authorities reclassifying flu cases covid. minds, coronavirus cases actually flu, meaning flu cases normal. Yup. never doubted vaccine awe damn good are, especially considering rushed much possible. started getting flu shot four years ago know someone ended coma month flu. started working school around time became friends. went home double pink eye, pointed germ filled place needed shots. year, got flu shot TDaP. I've getting every year since getting shot time pick prescriptions convenient getting sick 🤷🏻‍♀️  Many companies actually take idea providing safe work environment seriously. It’s also good way weed idiots. 94,000 per day without masks, packed concerts, clubs, offices, public transport, dinners, house parties, travel exc.

COVID days 250,000 cases confirmed testing, likely region 600-700k real infections, despite measures. reason believe vaccine work. got mine (Moderna) 4 PM. time going bed feeling really tired.

The next morning still felt tired ok. 10:30 meeting boss asked said fine. said feeling 2 hours. Sure enough, around noon started getting feverish. 102 fever afternoon really tired. 6 PM fever gone started get energy back.

So case apparently boss's case, tiredness started 5-6 hours fever start 20 hours.

I never bad headache. may pounding water. really wanted sleep unpleasant. 

Note: take fever reducers fever got 102. Since uncomfortable bit experiment.

My wife similar experience fever came back next night. also got 103. Vials go air. mean, it’s like could hurt. insurance, it’s free. Ok, looking appendix additional data, tried compare person's exposure baseline many cases entire country community exposure date calculated sum multiplications number national newly detected cases day previous 18 days probability COVID-19 positives getting infection 18 days day detection.

That seems wrong, community spread would even throughout entire nation. Certain areas country accounted cases, actually (lower income certain ethnic religious groups). one particular spot, Sheba Medical Center. using area around there?

I like trying take additional factors account, think correct way it.

And top that, 4 things:

1. adjusted numbers fairly large outlier comes studies it, unadjusted numbers not; and
2. sample numbers small. 11 people symptomatic cases, swing lucky case two pretty large.
3. #2, confidence range gigantic. 95% confidence level 71% 92%, 72% 84% adjusted ones, 52% 87% 38% 74% unadjusted ones.
4. Due large ranges 95% confidence level, make sense look studies well, pretty much show lower efficacy? experience, say already believe masks social distancing work, order thought process logical, flu cases still happening unreported. get agree masks social distancing work, might able get believe flu cases diminishing that. However, agree masks social distancing work, worth arguing with.  thread total dumpster fire.

1. AZ != vaccines.
2. safety signals mRNA vaccines.
3. Covid seriously harm *anyone*, regardless age comorbidies.
4. Vaccine induced herd immunity way - like measles, polio, etc. Protect yourself, protect people around you.

Some sort unholy alliance seems forming like bashing AZ (I can't claim entirely innocent point) want see Covid virus survive thrive population. even here...? real. stupid social media drama probably assumed they'd lot time enough data emergency authorization , small company half got covid Las year , half got vaccinated year included .but hopes anything beyond 50% Florida can't especially vaccines even FDA approved, emergency use authorization. fact that's exactly many people hesitant  tad off-topic, Could covid blessing some? Could provide unlearning opportunity ppl raised lead life addicted crappy, nutrient deficient food. 

I mean, eat healthy, cant make enjoy things eat. skip second shot due immediate allergic reaction first one. kinda wonder happen next....

I appointment allergist May figure allergic it....

Sucks, life.  Learning people 0 concept vaccines designed work societal level. second dose moderna Sunday. Can’t wait go Dodger games weeks US generally request one doctor spring summer, sometimes order it. regular pre flu/flu season walk chain pharmacy get it. low risk people avoidable risk calls question manufacturing quality control  Wasn’t China sodomizing citizens calling “covid tests?” think shutting international travel Asia lot good here. lot flu strains really come Asian farms.

Of course masking social distancing helps well. really matter. much spread came people foot Mexico? There's reason also implement mandatory travel quarantine snuff things out. Australia Taiwan tons travel bringing virus early on. leak quarantine system, lockdown, contact trace, take totally effective measures round up. * India healthcare system comparable US, hospitals overwhelmed.
* testing situation India bad right now, many cases missed. partial immunity even getting wrong strain nothing scoff at. husband slackass getting flu shot, always get mine, even though also makes feel like shit day after. Last time got flu, knocked ass solid week. runny nose felt little congested couple days. tested positive flu B, basically fine. miserable. Yeah, literally even sort nightmare mutation doesn’t exist won’t exist, Pfizer make booster vaccine similar variants within month people could get like three months that. took multilingual pun. French, “the flu” *la grippe,* Spanish it’s *la gripe,* German it’s *die Grippe,* etc.  said young, healthy person need it.

I'm 30 picture good health. Still got sense smell back year. 

But yes, otherwise absolutely fine got covid... except half delirious fever, coughing hard felt like diaphragm disintegrate... curious experience waking middle sleep choking pink, foaming, blood filled sputum every night 16 days, trying decide serious enough call ambulance despite hospitals overwhelmed officials pleading people go hospital unless life-threatening. vaccination tracker looks vaccinations administered manufacturer? seem stats US, 3 approved vaccine here. I'm curious vaccines administered around world well cheat dog dogecoin joke. kids never get years experiences back. No. Condoms permanent thing. Masks unecessary vaccinated. Mid June mask wearing drop matter it’s still mandated not. don’t get vaccine protect yourself. get vaccine help get herd immunity avoid vaccine-resistant variant fucking everything up. 
Hit us 12-15 hours after, felt better maybe 12 hours. Nothing major. started thinking people actually give shit opinions

Joe Rogan exists quantum superposition ends political horseshoe theory. bro open-minded brain fell out. love this. bumper sticker. Yes, removing mean cease exist online...  eff cares rural Nebraska broham remaining India right huge safety risk right people access medical care. 


The India variant already spreading US, deal using measures used variants. Also, CDC guidelines quarantine international takes several weeks ships make India. Mexico Canada would best targets. Mexico Canada, next closest targets would Caribbean. I’m thinking haven’t flu year, hopefully much social summer, getting one might good idea. stopped daily shot Clorex, conflicted. want eat McDonalds! None fast food places near open eat in. UK amongst pro-vaccine countries Europe around 20% population wary getting it. However, groups offered it, we've able convert 3 every 4 people fence it.

France might much bigger anti-vax movement, people offered it, imagine people opt it, convert people getting jab.    will, there's really ""hopefully"" it. We've seen pattern hundred times already. literally already guaranteed - everyone could start 500 person kissing parties tonight deaths would still drop coming weeks, decrease already ""locked in"" past 2 weeks plummeting case count; i.e. essentially already happened wait several-week combined lag course illness reporting time. local CVSes Pfizer. seems vary. Gotcha, didnt know first dose provided much protection Theoretically, reduce much people drink drunk spending night out. thought drunk people would likely spread virus. state saw bars selling $1 chips booze, state tried determine types food could served alcoholic beverages. However, almost restaurants (near least) followed ridiculous mandate, kept selling snacks anyway since rules getting ridiculous. Even worse that, he's funny either. awful, that's Delhi.

Now imagine everywhere else, much much less access medical supplies. Except, wear seatbelt take risk yourself. get vaccinated also expose - even vaccinated - others function incubator new variants. reach herd immunity socially responsible behavior get shot protect others. way. got flu think best way tell look new cases deaths. dropping lot. getting close. Let's finish it! Besides possible bad batch, Sputnik V also effective vaccine many poorer countries choose. Spray Florida private school allow teachers get vaccinated.   fuck Bali get horns   loops fit well bollocks I'd like, no, really. Well, may yet remain essentially asymptomatic. Best luck. there's choice, sure would say take

We're talking third world countries, though. them, terms price availability convenience indeed might another choice. ""not good"" comparison best vaccines available - still perfectly good terms reducing hospitalizations. Meanwhile, fact tried tested technology means also safest one regard possible long-term consequences. Yes could fire you. Biden passed something says people collect unemployment quit unsafe job due Covid I’m sure proof give that. simple counting perspective, going already harder COVID flu significant overlap symptoms. essentially accurately count flu, run influenza test parallel run millions COVID tests per day.

I doubt flu fell year, time easy data get blended COVID data test much influenza begin with. already proven vaccines protect variant. Well cdc said cdc would fucking wrong don’t think get good news. Love see it! deserve far I’m concerned data suggests immunity pretty high 3-4 weeks first dose. Second dose adds little bit. 

For example, let's say population 100 give everyone first dose efficacy 80% 3 weeks. 3 weeks, 80% protection entire population.

Or give 50 people 2 doses efficacy 95% 50 people, 50 people unvaccinated 0 protection.

The first population better protected case. 2nd example leaving half population completely unprotected boosting efficacy 80 95% 50 people already good immunity first shot. 

Now vaccine supply issue matter. places supply issue, prioritizing first dose probably makes sense. We’ve eradicated smallpox close eradicating polio. I’m sure would skeptical. takes concerted effort. Might want help explaining covered entities business associates are... either way, still HIPAA :-) Anecdotally, kicks anywhere 3 24 hours (excluding vasovagal fainting needles short-term anaphylaxis within 15 minutes). feel much that, probably going experience side-effects.  Nope would guy saying wants people die cares himself... using ref. Go work die.

That’s one plausible advantage anti-science - won’t work long die. Dead people get either. [""Oh, arm I'm never going public transit without mask  would excellent plan, specially Mexico, need move fast case Indian strain went wrong starts spread Mexico. weird hearing people COVID state still can't smell. saying I've become aware sense smell strong smell person's individual scent whenever take mask sip drink (I'm fully vaccinated, really high risk situation). can't imagine world would like smell.  try imunocal. fix ur smelling issue less 3 months soon 2 weeks insane. know really anything personally, sucks helpless we’re grateful getting shot! great 20 years literally documented recorded everywhere everything ever?

Do carry cell phone everywhere go? GPS car? use internet? Seeing post reddit makes yes. smart TV?

No need wait 20 years documented recorded friend, happening years years already. Shot records nothing new either. people think brand new thing government spy us unknown reason really funny. Yeah, same.

I figure even literally don’t help year, don’t make worse. generally speaking, even strain vaccine off, still often offers small amount immunity anyways.

I get free there’s usually vaccination table set front pharmacy, I’ve gotten every year last years.

It’s back traditional levels now. Hopefully it’s going continue (so single peak) rather turn upwards winter.  K think they'd cheaper update every year, since that's mRNA production excels at.  Flu vaccines make antigen protein, identical COVID mRNA-and-other vaccines work.

Actually, great numbers. Israel's population around 60% vaccinated, assuming equal distribution (no protection vaccine) would 16 cases un-vaccinated group 25 cases vaccinated group. However, distribution (37 un-vaccinated 4 vaccinated) would suggest efficacy 93% calculations correct, i.e. efficacy initial trials. course, way little data draw actual conclusions.

No vaccine ever claimed 100% efficacy, vaccine need effective.  Yep, I'm Louisiana department health announced they've found Brazilian variant here. comes suspected UK variant prevalent one He's wrong also idea averages work indeed 50% less average. thinking median, average.

…  I've met defended decision remove episode saying, “We going ban specific individuals guests people’s shows

What guests? host. said it. I’m guessing aren’t serious illnesses theory there’s good chunk population (non-athletes) consider completely recovered Covid actually damage/ lingering effects. many couch potatoes going notice longer peak lung function longer run mile fast? 

Professional athletes people previously prime condition however would aware even small changes. Like said though, theory I’ve come reading long haulers. Joe Rogan needs walk back gets commentating people getting punched head stay knows.  could accept personal decision move on. He's openly anti-vaxxer good source facts. Weird. wife got first covid vaccine 3 weeks ago similar symptoms you’re describing. Pain roof mouth pressure one eye. importantly, limit chances genetic drift. Every time anything copies terms DNA RNA, there's chance code get buggy - becomes C C becomes G - something different.

Most time, insta-death. Fatal error - abort, retry, ignore. 

But - tiny change makes slightly better? Slightly likely get around vaccine, resist treatment, causes new symptoms? suddenly young healthy people find far fatal?

That would fuck bad thing, right?

And everybody lets get COVID basically rented body petri dish process free. importantly, renting body petri dish - might also renting people's them. 

If think happen - that's MRSA - Strep (Strep A) many petri dishes - many changes replicate finally hit something good - resistance methicillin. funny say l.a. county vaccinated 60% adult population. obviously break zipcodes stark differences whos getting vaccinated create pockets. l.a. county able limp 70% alls said done Rogan grabbed guy ""being face"". That's escalation.

Let's PLEASE argue chokeholds amazing DE-ESCALATING conflicts.

If u grab guy head, still battery, matter u dress up. Contestant attack Rogan. Rogan made allegation. defend ur hero, still uneccessary aggression, even u dont like contestant. give u benefit doubt ignorance call u old geezer? 🤣 guess black white days, submission holds sign police bravery!! Rogan hero grabbing screaming men head! guy totally deserved it! 🙄 watched full clip. dont biased opinion assume Rogan right thing, simply told u ""de-escalated"" situation. reality? Contestant flailed grabbed... didnt look less violent all.

Right problem all. future, although nothing impossible, expect anything significant worrying. dengue-fever type nightmare scenario, got lucky. mind asking: wear mask around others? kids? job exposed lot people? ideas why/where picked colds year? personally don’t follow Joe Rogan good admit wrong; say stupid things time time us admit it. getting downvoted Fauci literally said people ""shouldn't"" wearing masks. Like think wrong was. said need to, that's different, instead discouraged it. Telling people dangerous misinformation.

His excuse evidence ""outside hospital setting"" masks effective. Ok, let's take true. effective hospital setting, would tell people wear them? Telling people effective they're free one thing, literally said wear one. top clear evidence mask wearing effective time. lied.

He lied becuase paternalistic view tell truth - enough masks - without Americans hoarding away healthcare workers. instead saying ""don't buy masks, make them"" said ""don't wear masks"".

People hate pointed out. Fauci reasonable scientist contrasting Trump make infallible. That's mine does, dont moles go propogate fact none vaccines give immunity virus. herd immunity isnt thing anymore lol. vaccine isnt necessary, blow me.  sorry happening really like thought ppl choice vaccine know I'd already freaking j&amp;j possibly vaccine alone. vaccines work intended. wouldn’t worry it.

Yes reopening period. know matter kind “approval” comes FDA morons move next excuse/conspiracy. 74 75 million fully vaccinated people died according last CDC numbers saw. basically one million. every American get vaccinated, would work 330 total deaths COVID.

Meanwhile, 37,000 Americans die car accident every year. vaccinated, got better chance dying car crash way restaurant dying COVID contracted restaurant.  forgot part said anything masks? 

All said scientists found far vaccines worked creating immune responses variants, pretty much every serious serious scientist relayed message. crazy think back march frantically refreshing pharmacy websites try get vaccine. local walmart walk appointments really know children aren’t catching highly controlled environments like school. don’t know happens throw kids indoor crowded spaces unmasked, unvaccinated people. 

Bottom line, masks aren’t big deal. choice people wear masks number children die unnecessary deaths, that’s incredibly easy choice make. There's reason tell got vaccinated. yeah, going college requires vaccination might tip off... link vaccines *distributed*.

It’s it, much louder. 54% total population! 

This article strange since headline calls percentage adults, data listed full population.

We must high 60s adult pop CT! Heaven forbids working making effort leave terrible world behind… nerve people reallocate inconvenience. Children less likely hospitalized from

As long students able enter US unvaccinated, imagine schools willing able find workarounds unable access vaccine. Even 2021, I’ll wear mask whenever I’m feeling sick feel norm. enjoy personal freedom that. rest us vaccinated would rather wear longer think fact 95% people getting second shot impressive. ECDC tracker takes time update. Spain received morning 1.5M AZ doses, roughly translates 15M doses EU level. 

The supply shortfall still inexcusable, 50M claim true. restrictions unprecedented, experience.

No one knew doing.  Correct. couple Universities mentioned early made requirement contingent full FDA approval, wouldn’t surprised 100 listed well.

This also one reasons mandatory military. Sames here.

I'm fully vaccinated every student too. simplest easiest way get back classroom lab. think started Rogan back comedians longer allowed perform college campuses stand-up routines deemed ""non-PC"". legitimate concern. though Joe went deep rabbit hole, first alt-right BS outright conspiracy theories. don’t doubt work hospital, major city? see comments like I’m skeptical. 
I doubt seen teenager pass away serious complications. However, doubt number you’re implying. comes across fear mongering. 

On average - AAP publications - “About 1.3% children known case COVID-19 hospitalized 0.01% died.”
1.3% roughly 2.4 million 624 hospitalization per state. Divided among state, way could seen dozen children hospitalized covid average. 
Of course outliers anomalies, you’re smaller state large cities etc. could make argument one teen affected many, I’m denying comment reads completely differently statement. They're minor, like me. still restricted parents. Well ya, matter someone wants to, I've lived Japan couple years wife there, exposure people wearing masks already. curious all. That's excellent. heard anything state I'm glad see happening elsewhere, hope catches everywhere.

In regards issue, something work one shot mRNA vaccines confers level immunity J&amp;J, far know. even small portion get double dose big step right direction. Joe Rogan poster boy group intellectually insecure people think contrarian thinking makes look intelligent.  loudest voices. Overly cautious people, riddled covid anxiety, also far less dangerous loud misinformation spreaders. Don’t conflate *spreading* misinformation *being* misinformed.

These people know exactly doing. AZ delivered 34 million 50 million...

I doubt deliver 16 million It’s killing young people India. variant something else. Turn news you’ll see all. Flu also asymptomatic infection. Covid's long incubation period 100% good thing comparison flu, especially people generally infectious period, last 24 hours showing symptoms. reason elimination possible. countries took advantage used pandemic plans written flu made assumption elimination impossible. FREEDOM SPEECH.

FREEDOM THOUGHTS.

FREEDOM DISAGREE.

Joe Rogan doctor, listeners base life decisions Joe Rogan.. it. Freedom choice. Darwinism.

I listen sometimes disagree lot things says, thats kind how... things suppose work.

Pull required measured gone. matter use it'll exploited matter what. People nice eyes ugly mouths living life like kings queens.  good get official word though. Indiana business requires mask required wear one, one enforces whatever. Good lock flu 1918. I'm sure would lock another similar strain flu hit pandemic levels. periodic ""[animal] flu"" scares we've decades basically proof that: early warning system sounding loud clear another H1N1 (or similarly deadly) flu variant appears spreading rapidly.

Everyone get flu shot *should* getting flu shot every year--as well taking easy steps safeguard others, like frequent effective handwashing--and societal support everyone social opprobrium not, regular flu ""lock globe"" health threat. Eliminating Certificate Need laws would go long way. shortage ICU beds great extent artificial problem owes existence onerous regulations. study based perceptions caregivers, real data take account impact epidemic death closed ones. Opening now, summer idiotic - vaccinate least children summer reopen, doable US, UK, Israel EU. course countries low vaccination rates option. Yes, know I’m talking live there. ""prepare"" conversation take responsibility fact people listen say maybe give opinions topics know anything about. 

If care thinks things says true, fine, that's one thing. saying people listen him, entire job millions people listen him, incredibly dumb. Natural antibodies aren’t showing stick around long Oh doubt - I'm sure many do. doubt pharmacist grocery store billing department submits everything send out. think bunch type operation generate bills actually physical billing send codes central location? 100?

The optimal point time start restricting travel positive inflection points - cases stop falling start rising; they're already astronomical. even then, resulting hurried repatriation flights cause superspreader event unless absolutely sure quarantine everyone repatriate. repatriation flights, entirely illegal, immoral, inhumane.

Beyond that, quarantine national boundaries entirely futile. sort like trying separate hot cold oxygen atoms room putting divider two halves. Remember:

 * know *who* sick
 * *do* know *are* novel variants India US
 * However, knowledge two week delay
 * Furthermore, India's rising case numbers month (and inflection point even out)

Ergo, almost certainly case variants concern currently India also US.  18, what, 2 weeks ago? takes time put kind policy place, particularly large university systems. needs message, front center, every channel. Get life back getting vaccine, maybe also get free donut. article useless propaganda study based perception real data. Designed give result wanted. Also, IMO, people 45 generally followed doctor. symptoms unlikely go get medical care, even warn them. already issues followed doctor medication. people 60ish are.

That's cop out, ""oh fault millions people work hard get listen actually listened me, they're stupid"". 30s currently new pzifer deal reports become 40s. young healthy. teenage friends rated disease around level flu even less COVID novel, started zero immune memory. Even ""pandemic"" flu days likely deal level immunity spread. Yikes. beginning told ""The correct reaction look like overreaction"", often viable way operate heavily individualistic democratic system.  look Canada, population 10million Australia similar spread population across country. Yet Australia less 30000 cases Canada 1 million. essentially back normal yet Covid still thousands Canada. That’s true   states recognize pharmacists providers bill insurance consultation. pharmacist. covid kept package baby wipes car gas pumps felt grimey. comedians banned college campuses? still expensive AZ. EU probably sign new contract them, don’t think end. hopefully fix damn supply chain. believe said 30s offered alternative vaccine? major countries loads citizen working India. guess hard deny citizen returning. 

That said, current situation still unbelievable. OSHA make permanent rule prohibiting employers forcing sick employees report work. Would support that?  Minors part aren’t able get vaccinated due age restrictions lack testing kids don’t see can’t. article said we’re already near around 50% NC, 66.7% number people received least one dose, fully vaccinated. think that’s reasonable goal.

Though think it’s fair assume XYZ population partially vaccinated, people likely fully vaccinated weeks. don’t know many people getting one dose getting reason. peer review papers still out, we're still middle pandemic, noticed. Hold onto hat, kiddo, example ""covid anxiety syndrome"" already lorded next problem post-covid mental health teams facing. I'm sure Google might results that. Please don’t mistake unpopular one uneducated one. already ways getting foreign students vaccinations attend colleges. non-healthcare workplaces require employees get flu shot, prove vaccination history all.

Yum applesauce apple product, right? think that's good idea either, I'm anti vaxx got first dose respect decision others get vaccinated (at least yet) even agree NC saying 66% 16+ first dose. MI saying 70% 16+ first dose. 

Bay Area Counties already 70% 16+with first dose. Let’s hope scientists NC MI right thresholds. fine skeptical appeals authority. okay question, ""Why believe Bill Gates?""

It's fine use fallacious false dichotomy of: *""well respect opinion Bill Gates, respect opinion Joe Rogan""*.

As even needs said, Bill Gates focused investing Pandemic Response well-over decade. Investing billions dollars cause. think writes check take time actually read research? clearly passion his, billionaire afford take time study passions depth.

Meanwhile Joe expressed interest Pandemics coronavirus (like average person) background even interest hard science. fact two biggest interests seem be:

1. sport continually beat head
2. inhaling drugs cut oxygen brain

Which two people's opinions Pandemics think respect more?

If Bill Gates starts spouting dumb shit MMA, let know I'll join thread criticize him. They've delivered 21% EU's total doses. impressive. happens Pfizer even impressive. shame second place. people already complaining NC subreddit bar low lift mandates...

Someone asked recently wanted get vaccine. response didn’t really matter wanted. Given little time, wouldn’t optional. get little say goes bodies. hope creators vaccine money mind. 

I’m anti-vax, think people choice well complete transparency creators full financial support major side effects pop up. 

All people developing blood clots severe allergic reactions medical expenses (including psychological) paid government and/or vaccine companies. shouldn’t worry missed work days, etc. expenses paid fully back feet. 

I want able trust leaders feel confident nothing worry best interests mind too. Seems like one-shot option key reaching people yet get vaccine. JnJ good, still limited supply still fear around pause. Anyone know vaccines tested one-shot applications? Seems like initial data Pfizer Moderna pretty damn effective one dose. seems practical hard reach busy young people aren’t much risk. options = vaccinated. stock market crash gotcha. don’t even get flu shots worry much perspective already way would flu season. Thank putting perspective. know TON people get flu shots nearly always end flu one personally died it. exactly case.

It also made clear something stupid would make non-full mission capable (FMC) would face consequences. classic example getting sunburn bad could strap ejection seat. officer would mean Article 15, kiss death officer's career. sure punishment would enlisted personnel would slap wrist.

Either data correct, *(temporarily) eradicated Flu year simply locking down*, data/testing wrong. 1-10,000,000 doesn’t exactly make feel like need thing even better odds. That’s good hear transmission still don’t see matters risk vaccinated. require people vaccinated? navigating. We're still keeping gatherings outside mostly masked (but less masked before, makes sense).

I figure kids school since September things gone OK, mostly try copy there. little cautious due wanting keep school 2 weeks exposed. Remote schooling work well us. irony world damn near killed Flu year least Covid precautions/mandates lol. tell everyone much virulent covid compared Influenza.  make argument.

My point, hill die on, argument shouldn’t based made numbers! “Full approval” tests efficacy, safety. They’ve already met every FDA safety bar is. Virtually vaccine side effects present first 6 weeks. numbers significantly underreported. 

[You don’t convert dog crematoriums human ones aren’t seeing significant deaths. girlfriends friend tested positive working coworker tested positive. fully vaccinated asymptomatic currently. chances false positive test? speaking vaccines general, ""long-term"" meant terms ""years"", weeks. 

BTW, blood clots conclusively linked J&amp;J vaccine? I'm asking ""correlation imply causation"" kind way, following J&amp;J story. Yes. group doesn’t include anyone I’m close to, I’m still willing wear mask protect them. completely appalled number people won’t something simple save another person’s life.  accept free men run private businesses deny entry, hypocrites.

Stop LARPing distopian resistance fantasy get fucking vaccine. fucking public health crisis. wrong way look though, people (vaccinated not) get sick time period. argument, mortality rate unvaccinated like 0.01% (deaths/around 4 million unvaccinated MN). obviously incorrect.

You consider efficacy preventing symptomatic disease (which know trials ~95%) look fraction infections resulting death.  less risk people still get fucked plenty risk people havent cant vaccinated Where’d get one? I'm certain exception would carved people object mandatory vaccination. Breaking news: colleges require high school diploma GED fall Novavax included HIV-positive trial participants, medically stable - *not* AIDS immunocompromised. 

J&amp;J also included HIV+ participants clinical trials Pfizer declared safe medically stable HIV+ recipients. point pandemic people forgotten eliminate death?

Everything society confers risk death. Using ladder. Owning pool. Driving car.

The risk dying COVID19 never 0. risk death non-disastrous number (which already vaccinated) there's reason restrictions society. curiosity, saying ""screw jerks would use forged card"" based fact bad actors forged cards, mandate vaccination? Fuck shit Damn, also give lottery numbers, knowing oracle? say social distance? didn’t. don’t think that’s now. Literally said keep wearing masks protect can’t get protection vaccine. 

325 children died. I’m sure families would appreciate unwilling wear tiny piece cloth prevent deaths. Well like required attend. You’re willfully ignorant. probably doesn’t matter sounds like approved (for efficacy) soon. necessarily. school one 100 list requiring covid vaccines, entered school years back, sign paper saying vaccines required. find paperwork, care.

The big issue vaccination tracking non-existant many states. state (until recently) sort vaccine database, even now, doctors fail actually enter information system. way prove immunizations show records individual vaccine, people good keeping records like that. school said ""fuck it"" honor system. difference vaccine make odds dying hospitalized already astronomically low? 

1 10,000,000 way better 1 10,000. 

Also, vaccinated people spread virus considerably lower rate unvaccinated people. can't leave tour over. Um. me? different kids needing vaccinations get school? honestly adult boosters getting vaccines also required high education. wanna bring home family. Still explained virus mutate. realize one variant show India, right? They're massive breeding ground. virus meet like, ""Shit already used Indian variant can't mutate anymore."" Can't study variant exist yet.

See that's said things like, ""vaccine-resistant"" ""rapidly changing"". Neither one condescending bullet points actually replied said left context out. Last year problems people bringing virus country; would different last year vaccine-resistant variant? would think whole resistant thing would nullify vaccine efforts turn problem shrug off.

And holy hell, answer one question asked (none ever do): would like explain vaccine-resistant mutation possible? going pretend can't hope best?  ""long term"" means years, weeks. But, think really hard nail something happens 6 months vaccine caused vaccine. No. isn’t procrastinator. appt backed like “they rushed it. I’m gonna get it. I’m great health.” like all. usually pro medicine. 

Oh! friend whose daughter (20s) recently reaction flu shot left paralyzed. suspect that’s it. Vaccines starting kick lot people. expect May things look even better.  Israel pretty much restrictions two months 

Pretty much thing left place mask mandate Well, least you’re honest flat don’t care vulnerable.  Fixed it.

6 deaths nearly 2 million vaccinated minnesota, across vaccine spectrum. 

The CDC clear vaccine keep infected, warned breakthrough infections, yet vaccines proven extremely effective neutralizing severe cases COVID.

6 people 2 million enough nix way life anticipation herd immunity epidemiologists agree impossible.

But you, that's noble. “Quite literally already happening”

Regardless, parent immune compromised child. teacher school NC. ditch masks kids aren’t vaccinated, accepting certain number kids get sick. school also stated distance option next year. students choice exposed measures protect getting education. insane choice giving families.

As far “why vaccinated people worried,” answer right now, numbers still bad vaccines great perfect. case counts low? Sure, think vaccinated people would fine drop masks, except areas geared children (like schools). aren’t yet.

That's fair. opinion idea commitment relevance.

Once we've vaccinated people willing vaccinated, there's nowhere go there.

Continuing lockdown solidarity net benefit society point. Montana 0.32% US population. basically rounding error census. would scenario.

So drive supply educated people down.

Where demand go? Up?

What happens demand goes up?  Well no. missing huge part this: 

There ALSO community protection. Get spread even 1 20 protected coming contact virus. 

And vaccines really help reduce spread. teams anti vaxxers. much 100 days masking thing guess. Correct. are...  This. much this. Actually insane huge populous state like Florida, got rid restrictions LAST June, like middle road death rate Covid. Especially crazy given Florida huge elderly population.  Yeah seriously, mean feel people going readjust, sure don’t *get* it. I’ve already got loads plans made vaxed friends acquaintances I’m two weeks post second shot literally counting days. small chance could get asymptomatic case never know it. big since I’m vaccinated, pass someone seriously immune compromised? think reach point cases start dropping dramatically then, yeah, don’t think need masks (except places full people either high risk unvaccinated- hospitals, schools). cases really low overall, odds vaccinated person catching asymptomatic case passing along become very, low. we’re quite yet. hope larger investment treatment, contact tracing, sequencing samples pivot reactive proactive. We’ve using lagging indicators manage entire time. governments using hospitalizations metric, it’s lagging indicator - damage already done. Nah, don’t want told Government, don’t join military. Right, except commander chief expressly said happen.

This refusing push ups dig ditch.  *might* relevant identifying romantic partners/hookups might exposed (though recorded necessarily mean directly used).   websites generate revenue clicks. 

Intentional clickbait. little, late. can't use breakthrough numbers time delays.

For example, lets say fully vaccinated, I'm person protected vaccine. Lets say eventually catch COVID 3 months now. 

Well, next 3 months would counting someone protected vaccine reality I'm make breakthrough numbers 3 months.

The breakthrough numbers would eventually trend towards trial numbers given enough time. that's fine - 95% REALLY good. company requiring without requiring. employee fully vaccinated, two weeks post shot, spends overnight stay outside house required quarantine unpaid use PTO 10 days returning travel. done three weeks ago. military require full FDA. want get extremely technical, can't literally hold give vaccine involuntarily, secretary HHS set punishment refusal. language pretty much extremely vague. nothing stop secretary saying ""sure refuse, fired job"" ""be jailed do.""   Get damn vaccine unless sever reactions vaccines. Believe 1000 times better getting virus itself. arms muscular like hardened steel. problem needle breaking go vaccine ? Good see equates 55% 18+. still need need approved kids is, actually. 

The thing confuses people mean 5% chance catching COVID, lots people catch even without vaccine. 

But indeed mean 5% protected (again, mean catch it). compare vaccinated group placebo group determine effect vaccine. think referring market crash 1929 Yup. lazy say put eradicated quotes… that's funny, must've missed Biden calling Indian virus  different type technology, point stands nonetheless. going severe effects statistically significant number people, almost certainly would happened now. That’s great, many universities waiting full FDA approval.

At least public ones, likely private ones well.

Stop concern trolling get jabs. Like whether vaccine exacerbates breathing problems? people know vaccinated now, mostly either Pfizer Moderna. heard anyone name cough shortness breath anything like all. I've heard sore arm, low fever, chills, achy, tired, headache. That's it!

Completely anecdotal, take grain salt, MIL suuuuper sensitive medications vaccines. arm swells like crazy gets red hot gets flu shot. also COPD. got Pfizer right became available (she's 75) even react strongly Pfizer shots flu shot. severe headache first one (that lasted 1 night) second shot, arm little swollen injection site. nothing major. Zero breathing issues. They're doubt using mRNA binary shots. Process take 5 weeks. Vaccination Demographics update 2021-04-30

But maybe think avoid covid long enough ""herd immunity"". factor high likelyhood corona become endemic(extremely contagious, worldwide, animal vectors) never really go away chances able avoid covid forever goes zero. choices essentially become take vaccine take virus.

I got vaccine. I'm young healthy. I'm also MD. reason got it, got wife soon possible save world. immense personal benefit vaccinated pandemic. Helping society good side effect. hope public health officials start stressing personal benefit getting vaccinated. Yeah maybe. Especially Moderna May seems likely, since increased projected deliveries yesterday (although there’s mention Moderna article, I’d imagine probably allowed export Canada now?). Pfizer confirmed May deliveries awhile ago though knows already knew this. Either way, it‘s encouraging see Canada priority matter future boosters, etc. also spring side, leaving cold flu season means almost certainly need less vaccines impact. definitely felt way worse moderna shot actually covid. first vaccine shot far. It’s myth, scan titles know exactly bent tomorrow's page same. $$$$$ society collapses food longer making stores... People like reviving visits people like me. mean, many places walk-in/drive vaccines now. That's still literally easier buying card stock trying print card.  don’t even realize full FDA approval vaccines waiting long term efficacy. nothing elderly basically done Canada. 85% 70+ people received dose 70% people 60s have. Sounds great, move Sedona become crystal healer shit, buh bye!! Hey, someone explain India managed avoid covid now? One would think country high population density relative poverty would highly impacted way earlier. Like Europe almost permanent lockdown several restrictions mobility, gatherings masks, yet experienced 2nd 3rd wave India fine? also sort lockdown? hard time imagining stricter rules Europe.

If look hard specific states/sites, may find CDC requires all organizations administer vaccine report number vaccine doses “that unused, spoiled, expired, wasted required relevant jurisdiction.” CDC also asked states describe wastage monitoring method distribution planning ... reporting requirements vary reliably communicated vaccine providers. Even rules clear, regularly enforced, numbers reported public.

Minor point correction. *felt* sick shots actual virus. *actually* sick virus. shots caused immune response. 100000% everyone vaccinated consider bioethics mandating vaccines beyond work school employer basis. said, mandatory rapid testing far less ethical considerations rolled congregate settings.

Fortunately vaccine rollout came time. Vaccines children arrive end year.   You’re probably right. already tell next step is:  It’s vaccine, it’s gene therapy. 

Hoping knowledge aspect too. Haven’t seen discussed I’m sure react statement. Freaking amazing contact tracing. Public Health England said working international partners currently evidence Indian variant two related variants cause severe disease render vaccines currently deployed less effective.

Get vaccinated lose job denied unemployment it.  additional colleges requiring aren’t list, including schools University System Maryland. Good. school I'll annoyed. Never argue idiot: They'll drag level beat experience. who's fool wears crown case?  Ah ok yeah makes way sense. go Tech requirements either. think clicks! government uses tax credits (aka money) incentivize certain behavior people qualify participate in.

* Mortgage interest deduction (not everyone owns qualify home)
* Child tax credit (not everyone children medically able children)
* Solar tax credit (not everyone owns home put solar in, everyone afford up-front cost solar)
* Student loan interest deduction (not everyone student loans)
* many, many more

Furthermore, lot credits deductions phase make much money (much like stimulus checks last year, really tax credits given advance).

The number people medically qualify get FDA-authorized vaccine very, small - much smaller numbers people qualify one tax credits listed (again, including stimulus checks, tax credits given advance).

I know feels unfair exclude certain groups, would much, much better medically unable get vaccine maximum number people get vaccinated - even means someone gets $500 check they're unable get. long time vegetarian also concerned things.  they're tested animals? so, animals benefit vaccines well. They're already used protect primates zoos. expect we'll see lot that.  Also fwiw Vegan Society supports them. 

I figure prolonging pandemic terrible environment zillion ways. Whatever end good animals well people. 

  horrible. use word grief makes hit home bit harder tonight. can’t imagine pain suffering people, dead alive, deal with. I’m shocked find Naomi Wolf charlatan shocked tell you. think it’s rich people NY, Boston, north would fly Florida, stay 3 weeks, get vaccine fly back home. takes away vaccine supply local communities. that’s bc northeast really strict vaccine rules south giving everyone. nice see alma mater list  60M J&amp;J exactly ""extra"" since even determined produced properly yet. know canceling area recommend expecting heavy lifting least day shot. move mid week would that.

Assertion: anxiety rare

Your response: empathy

Stop going around trying look validation anxieties. precisely people private companies access medical records. US banned flights India yet? mean eyes public, people consider brazil right really isn’t what? tiny inconvenience? Yes, is. wear mask 40+ hours week think people whine selfish.

As far flu comparison - There’s difference much regular flu spreads vs. this. Unmasked people public right much likely spread covid spread flu typical flu season.  Remember even though higher age countries cause obscene uptake. Everyone getting jab takes longer get age brackets, what? happen brazil though, heard Canada  Anyone else exhausted variant talk? nothing, second one pops impact serious illness death needs front page.

This though makes people panic.  won’t admit they’re wrong face. they’ll go quietly get it.  Saint Edward's University requiring vaccine anymore, per orders Greg Every heard charter flights?

You ban commercial airlines reserve charter flights US citizens. possible see Fall. They've Phase 1 trials since last March pretty good idea longer term efficacy already. Typical turn around 2 years authorization seeing quickly large focus would crazy see happen months earlier.   people like Indy antivax? like open wheel racing also like vaccines science. Fair point. Great, headline reads better reality. Offer, complex term. 

France likely month quicker UK UK estimating end July. suspect, low vaccine acceptance comes play here.

As see US states lowering age requirement UK still 42 (not sure that.) reason 95%+ uptake UK slows roll age group massively helps stop pandemic.

If 30% people keen vaccine fucked. asking side affects risk level?

Side affects wont hit till 12+ hours 

Risk level thats you. personally stayed mostly locked 2 weeks post first shot first time “monitored” citizens. Hopefully college science department. lot states tying reopening vaccination numbers, even low risk worth getting vaccine add another +1 vaccinated column get state much closer reopening. parents type would disown though?

Narendra virus vaccinations counted. certified vaccine certified countries’ national medical regulatory counted. don’t side effects would come one given Pfizer vaccine US AZ vaccine given 2 months back home country. bring quite bit. There’s actually examples past reactions taking several weeks that’s sort moot. 

The overall point there’s literally thing “long time side effect” randomly 6 months later shit happens. think medically it’s sort near impossible even case

Would love color exactly people worried related “long term” Sinovac? Vaccine passport moot point here... nothing whether pendemic go forever (which leads view losing basic human rights INDEFINITELY even devastating 1 1000 dying time, assumed go forever)

I saying, repeat - get vaccinated, pendemic go indefinitely. see 1 1000 dying either.

Whether vaccine passport gets implemented country another argument altogether. mix up.

Israel getting back normal vaccine passport. 70% population getting vaccinated first place, amount passports ever get people freedom hugging one another again.

You vaccinated oppose vaccine passports case see option. (But discover many places requiring entry, trust will, want protect employees etc, maybe start thinking benefits outweigh loss ""equal rights"")

To point ""they indefinitely get jabbed every 6 months"". Think - many pandemic human history. need get jabbed every 6 months diseases? No. enough people immune disease, simply spread chance developing variants anymore, eventually eradicate. People become immune either actually getting sick (1 1000 dying) getting vaccinated (1 10000000 dying). prefer?

To last point - become available, choose get it? Something says won't. frankly clue why. Maybe either. There's vaccine car crashes. rest family fully vaccinated, somehow still can't shake fear might spread covid despite always wearing mask leave house leaving house essential stuff I'm playing safe I'm fully vaccinated.  true young people bad outcomes new variants long covid also possibility covid . Vaccines make entire college experience safer . rate increase actually decreased, merely testing capacity getting maxed physically can't test people rate new infections? means employer fire reason want aside certain things like discrimination, even prove it.

Uh, yeah. fire reason aside specific reasons *aren't* allowed fire (race, sex, etc.). add COVID vaccination status list.

There plenty at-will states add employment protections beyond federal law, would exact same. basing of? far can’t even say long last haven’t started waning yet. think anyone forced anything. 100% favor restricting air travel unvaccinated people, mask events. Vaccinations going get back normal; want participate? Fine, choice, enjoy living restrictions. We're vaccinating students campus right well. seems likely we'll get most, all, campus body vaccinated end term. However, =students studied remotely, took gap year, incoming freshmen access might need accommodations get vaccinations without endangering larger student staff body. moved forward idea bad, bad news.

I'm probably best chilling reddit still observing CDC guidelines despite fully vaccinated.  assume it'll work like required vaccines. university said they'll accept vaccine even though AZ/Novavax/Sputnik approved emergency use US. everyone vaccinated, virus would disappear. that's possible, portion worlds population remains susceptible ongoing infection. becomes caldron virus continues existence, progressively mutates maybe eventually breaks free vaccine altogether starts pandemic again.

I would hire someone views. Many friends self employed earn living receive healthcare.

My uncle fired job last year posting white suprematist garbage facebook wall. lost privilege work company hard time finding new employment. white suprematist protected class, sucks him.

I would hire someone told interview believe easily disprovable theories. would tell person lacks critical thinking skills probably building enterprise client facing software. Cuz they're smart?  Like, supposed go? get vaccinated, lie it, spend next winter desperately trying dodge winter COVID?

The people would make fake vaccine card definitely give shit ""dodging COVID"" whatever.

Many probably young/healthy personally extremely low risk complications anyways. first one argument taking vaccine? unvaccinated, one danger unvaccinated people, me.

This logic stems certain unvaccinated-and vaccinated people, matter!-people caring COVID spread vaccines stop spread individual mass scale.  Unless live Oregon Washington, case, keep dreaming downvotes? Even worse quality control vacs, works brings us one step closer beating pandemic global scale. Apparently mean going say no..... stock prices affected.. time tell. Vaccinations FDA approved approved emergency use. But, yes. two recent studies show opposite. Natural immunity infection proving similarly protective vaccination. true.

I said _this_ case investigated parents charged.

If going argue please stick semblance reality.

You clearly triggered this. maybe spew nonsense time? so, think good let appointment lapse. nice paywalled hard. going steps buying making fake card.

Is hassle? card got CVS got vaccinated plain card someone wrote name/DOB on. even signature.

It's *nothing* like driver's license, sorts security features. card got vaccine security features whatsoever. could print one regular home printer card stock.  Meanwhile people work Campus Police department refused vaccine. Oh look, paywalls. age year birth different?
Time machines? vaccines 100% proof... virus mutates infectious deadly variants thanks idiots. we'll start again.

If want vaccinate, free find another job. true? likely women die car accident, somehow thought number would high?

Mandates going drop now. proposal drop mandates 2/3rds adults vaccinated. We're months away that. Cases inevitably lower time standard met. Polling ever showed 60-70% people willing take vaccine expected never understood people don’t think appointment moved supply increases. 4 month gap lack supply 4 months MAX. majority country isn’t going waiting 4 months second dose. It’s likely people got vaccinated first implemented will. Come July adults first dose, seconds doses flying arms Mach speed. boyfriends parents received first dose recently nurse said “we’ll schedule second dose 4 months expect moved up” time foreign students showing up, US enough vaccinate anybody still wants one. combo vaccine hesitancy, anti-vaxxers, people already vaccinated long term issues well (meaning ones don’t show initially) vaccines don’t those.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Absolutely. seen country implode like since beginning pandemic. Furthermore India government even trying, CCP douchey least tried stop quarantining everyone Peddle narrative elsewhere. usual, story every time, late again. Govt deptt analysis &amp; analysis &amp; till time action taken analysis, late. history repeats... One reasons took long vaccines aren’t profitable. Companies would go slowly didn’t waste money candidates didn’t pan out. Governments turned money shower whole world put manpower making working vaccines. sped things lot. Even so, we’re lucky great vaccines quickly. multiple companies tried failed, don’t hear much them.   I’m correct, time ever closed 9/11 happened one asked one freedom press allow foreign correspondents country duty journalists without interference. know fully vaccinated?  right choice. happens get infected first dose second dose?  basically zero evidence Covid transmitted food surfaces. purely air breathe. think (and hope) fairly large population get next 12 months, going way get it. Maybe next doctors appointment land hospital something. special trip (at least without carrot). follow COVID guidelines - e.g. mask, social distance, handwash public

Because people get vaccinated STOP masking, distancing stuff. People like worst. prefer anti maskers. hope previously infected over-represented wait see group. think wars plagues didn’t happen ancient times videos photographs exist them? Even though plenty first hand accounts? silly standard.

Absence evidence evidence absence. way get American things either food money. deny niece nephew education issue responsible? think really mean that. important difference - regulated pot hurt anybody unlike spreading disease around. Unfortunately education also one gateways remove ignorance. Still, understand must this. Yeah gotta agree. true, congrats 10 million people high density city seems good true 🤔 think question simple right? USA ever allowed independent investigation anything? Strange said would hard decision, fully approved like vacinne.

Maybe thought 10 40 percent reenlisting vaccine service up..is consideration.

Suspect wait FDA approval. Try get service people vaccinated. decide based percentage left could choose potential blood clot kills instantly fight covid literally kills 0.001% people 50 fat...hmm tough choice legitimate concern variants India infecting vaccinated media sensation?

Yes Unfortunate probably prudent.  evidence strain currently escaped vaccines. strain escapes vaccines, means US nearly done pandemic due increasing vaccination rates. 

Last year virus actively circulating could infect anyone. caution ""what if"" scenario direct evidence happened. totally different. certainly somewhat flexible, really depends efficiently able move comment reports, general, we'd expect least hours per week help monitor queue remove misinformation. guessed it! mean stuff investigated sure think meant said “offer” you’ll able book appointment. line B.C. bad way phrase it. Lots colleges require things like MMR, TDAP, chickenpox, Meningococcal vaccines. alma mater started requiring flu shots last school year discussing next year. Others now. It’s released again. I’m glad got J&amp;J well. ever claimed 300 0 ratio asymptomatic symptomatic cases? math soooo grossly bad I'm 100% sure troll.

575,000 people died US COVID. total US population 328,200,000.

If EVERYONE US caught COVID, would put death rate 0.18%, 0.0001% spouting off. literally factor 1,800 that's even giving generous assumption everyone COVID, know puts death rate even higher.

Where receive education, father's tool shed? ONE individual would problem. Unfortunately many ones add quickly. Yeah, states less natural immunity. Life going go back normal year. Even NYC said plan fully reopen July 1st. 

There evidence variant evades vaccines.  dunno gf thinks business able require employees vaccinated coming back work office.  personally don’t consider 6-9 months long. look antibodies level charts show wane that, even still some. I’m gonna intentionally catch covid every year antibodies make using mRNA.

I’m gonna assume didn’t read study posted Qatar. 80-90% deaths occur age 65+ first priority group. point probably 3-4 months since vaccinated. expect deaths lower now, basically 80-90%.

It probably takes months get covid, get sick, die, death recorded, lag. like Israel example they're like 100 deaths per day, lowest almost year.

But still outbreaks certain states like Michigan, Washington, Oregon deaths increasing there. probably enough offset declines elsewhere country. still probably pockets population people risk refused vaccine. big country. people skipping planning skipping second dose? Good thing isn’t you! hand, overall deaths plummeted UK vaccine drive. It’s hard say reckless. way 0 symptomatic 300 asymptomatic cases. There's way. evidence? sure mean, evidence would global pandemic? remember saying evidence human human transmissible.

I'm speaking overwhelming attitude ""we can't assume eveidence... going assume best case scenario"" kept backfiring

We evidence right really evidence contrary either. Last heard south African significantly effective vaccinated ""normal"" strain. 

 possible let's try stay ahead instead getting caught pants like 2020. reason take shoes EUA approval. 1st shot: super sore arm, fatigue lasting several days

2nd shot: kind sore arm, fever, major fatigue fever fatigue lasted 24 hours. Restlessness day 3. much disliked former President, place blame squarely him, rather, irresponsibility many citizens Okay then, glad pro-science. Really articulated point one. Wearing mask actually increases risk infection common sense. 41, 37 unvaccinated 4 vaccinated. 4 breakthrough infections 9 million fully vaccinated people. Yea vaccine working. almost though journalism profession. flu. ignorance showing.  one disagrees that. else expect Honda fix it? meaningful distinction - fud people use justify selfishness. It’s exaggeration push point across. know…like favorite news channel does. 4 9 million far... Neither COVID keep mouth shut. ""People infected SARS-CoV-2 contact surfaces. However, based available epidemiological data studies environmental transmission factors, surface transmission main route SARS-CoV-2 spreads, risk considered guess take California's current numbers, fact month, Pfizer comments efficacy vs. variant worry it. Well... true means UK strategy wrong one. swear there's one new article contradicting every day. That's approval dude saying thats case example, well known conservatives hesitant general population, may confounding factor yall. elsewhere country, really conservative liberal issue much trust issue. example, black community, vaccine hesitancy going significantly thru months, still good amount people wary getting it. thats said said earlier, since, black community, know ""wait see"" crowd persuaded getting vaccinated  Apparently, people COVID may also higher rates reactions leave one FDA approved real amount time studied. Yes.. think shot per se think appointments available book. Ontario Quebec announced timeline Alberta far behind. can't speak BC guess
Hopefully optimistic haha. read book, don't.  loved movie figured would love book even more. know describe feelings towards book tedious, like boring, difficult, yet mind numbing chore.  Wait, would take one shot, second? common occurrence?

If take first dose mean you’re buying cdc/fauci advice, follow through? 

At least choose get vaccines consistent. Give time. next logical step parents fight vaccines children. going resist COVID vaccines, let kids get vaccinated mumps? We'll making polio great soon enough. read article posted? many first crowd getting 2nd doses? Chicken shit full shit, like thought ;) Getting drunk directly impacts others. ban that? reported 41 new cases Indian coronavirus variant, including four people vaccinated.   country population 9 million, vaccinated 81% citizens residents aged 16 using Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine April 19.

&amp;#x200B;

FOUR... 9 million threat now?

**vaccines work...** 

that's way get crowd big enough live, people still afraid go baseball game. want call someone isn’t “100% certain” anti-science. Yikes. 

It’s dog whistle calling things would get banned sub. I’m happy don’t live life like you. Phew... actually produced yet? Last update would go India ready US currently didn’t stockpile Covishield. could that, extremely low risk however probably hurting enviroment using plastic gloves neccessary. Canada still lower 7 day rolling average deaths per capita USA lol. article US schools.... enough doses vaccine, due neglect incompetence due uncertain nature making vaccine, fair every country nation.

Unless explicitly signed contract promised certain amount EU, provision additional contracts would interfere ability provide amount.

AZ willingly signed contract. failed satisfy parameters. they're getting sued it. entity blaming AZ, failed live stated promise. “We never overpromised, communicated thought would achieve time,” 

BULL FUCKING SHIT.

* Q1 deliveries cut days authorizarion 100M 40M , cut 30M
* Back february EU leaked report said sceptical AZ promised deliveries Q2. AZ denied reports, confirm day after
* Last week Ireland reported 14 15 deliveries AZ cut, delayed canceled. communicated day 2 deadline

Communication ass Trump ineffectual ban time part anti-China message anyway. I'm glad say today 2 week mark! also reducing production plants around world due microchip shortage, sooooo. excited state NJ. long, dark winter, finally light end tunnel. wasting time. Greatly depends type food, like take sushi vs bag rice league able disinfect example. 

All said even though risk small want add additional risk close getting vaccine ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 13mn day, talking 400 min month.. that’s 30% population ridiculous Montréal live work PA - since covid Montréal working remotely. E-transfer works too, I’m waiting :) Virtue signalling think decent line decisions directly impact others yourself. danger variants unvaccinated people, vaccinated people likely well protected technology used inherently faster older style vaccines. Plus absolute ton real world data mention funding poured research. makes perfect sense me. Seriously. There's evidence variants significant threat vaccines used US, know people refuse accept that. People addicted bad news seems. open countries got way covid cases people actually cared fully vaccinating population, they'd listen people like rather insult, downvote, shame. 

Yes, position selfish absolutely rational personal perspective, would go way vaxx personal gain? I'm curious, think outreach effort would change mind? government paid you? china bad upvotes left teach conservative area country (high school) students mostly vaccine resident say wait see....but fact family never going get vaccine. Similar issues polling previous election. convinced saying wait see want get admit anti vax. 

I'm extremely encouraging shameful person. try set example person excited getting vaccinated seeing others vaccinated.  might, sure. better say 4 months rather 2 months another 2? entire post history like huge anti AZ campaign lmao Oh please stop people pfizer vaccine (the type people Isreal) spreading B.1.617 (the variant that's exploding India right now) bode well. said lived Canada. Venmo Canada.....
🤣  really interesting part whole thing, gonna need every year covid booster. would imagine uptake would continually decrease whatever percentage hit year. offset degree ""natural"" immunity growing, eventually covid another cold. ask doctors scientists lol Everything said correct.  Idk predict future time Depends type grocery either let sit easily wash it.

Anti science? clear proportion SARS-CoV-2 infections acquired surface transmission.""

It's right there, low risk possible. Seems like parroting heard since think anyone actually claiming possible lower risk. 

And want call someone ""100% certain"" anti science. Yikes force people eat balanced, limited calorie diet? could save hundreds thousands lives every year so. India reports 401,911 new coronavirus cases, far biggest one-day increase record, 3,521 new deaths non-citizens. Citizens residents could still travel. Downvoting doesn’t change fact incorrect. No, is. half UK’s overall population one shot vaccine. Half done AZ. SPREAD Covid significantly reduced it, saved lives. Lots lots lives.

Stopping spread important. 20-something getting AZ may saved life, would saved someone’s grandpa. increasing 2m doses per week, headline gore? I'm pretty sure double got April. think Colleges something anti-vaxxers care about... legal protections citizens courts decided health well public harms way they(THE STATE) could force someone take vaccine declaring state emergency. Private businesses 0 authority comes someone's personal health cant force anyone get vaccinations anything else health related legal period. think opposite true. States lower vaccination rates ones governed Republicans, thus less likely impose restrictions.  Excellent question. first study (the 95% one) garbage. Half data 2 weeks 3.25 months first infection positive test. yeah, people think get reinfected weeks first infection.

The second, military one solid though. Although caveat healthy 18-20 year olds might differences immune responses general population overall. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* really care tbh, annoyed adamant following guidelines thing done make obsolete. I'm sure else could ""wait see"" point. We've waited, we've seen.

Even one-in-a-million adverse reactions would shown hundreds times now, none.

It really can't understated absolutely amazing mRNA vaccines are, absolutely knocked park. Efficacy safety profile beyond best hopes 12 months ago! Far late.  


Here go again. What’s TLDR? would fully vaccinated travelers need wear mask? I’m saying zero restrictions pre-herd immunity presents risk people can’t get vaccinated. That’s all. Agreed, problem people need convince get damn vaccine living like things normal along DGAF rest us. Yep, last year shown us flu COVID exactly same. daughters company fortune 100 requiring it. sons company Fortune 500 requiring it. company husbands company small businesses requiring it. think it’s scare tactic media piece vaccinations slowed lot. Many companies feel protected can’t sued Covid. flu kills around 60,000 people year, 600,000.  Nobody's explained you?  No. public figure expect people going call bullshit/potentially harmful information share publicly.

Saying drunk moron exempt criticized sorry bro. usa obviously resistant vaccines countries, lack push mechanism vaccines heighten this. southwest england, parents are, 97% elderly vaccinated. usa never get close that. sorts cultural factors, there's fact parents got vaccine someone called made appointment them, nationalized healthcare. 

Opt vs opt in. Good data sharing, great vaccine uptake. work pillow? 66% + immunity previously virus, 70, people say herd immunity Oh stop  Suggestion mods: chance people could flair whatever country state living in?

I think it'd make conversations easier follow. Like someone says COVID never worse we're reopening way soon, think they're trolling American, really live Timbuktu.  Well, like UIUC isn’t going require them, don’t get vaccinated keep testing 2X per week. That’s pretty big inconvenience. think people get vaccinated avoid it. I'm germaphobe, but

lol Bad news: virus (in part) destroy olfactory nerves. ever hear people sick clogged nose can't taste? idea. taste buds happen affected (as far know) yet flavor perception wack (flavor = taste + smell etc) 

Good news: UNLIKE nerves, olfactory nerves actually regenerate. like last majority people, olfactory nerves grow back eventually regain flavor perception food do. state (ri) moved stage three means demand constrained.

The mega sites walk now. Then, popups large businesses, churches, colleges, etc.

The one issue 4.5 percent people getting one shot mrna returning second shot, j&amp;j, obvious choice pop walk-in, wanted hardly anyone. information though opinion based personal experience. stated facts. This.

Seeing lot moronic comments like ""really, Italy?""

People ask average Italian wants planes flying India right now. matter level screening involved even took ground.

No one's enraged Italians. airliners clearly give shit. medical qualifications, Joe? people listen him, again? 😅 picture good health affected badly. overweight? Frankly anti-vaxxer don’t belong college anyway. realize you’re commenting USA tagged post, right?  thank you.

So 1 shot Pfizer/Moderna better J&amp;J, vice versa?

I figure saying 1 shot enough long term? J&amp;J single shot, even though less effective, long term like 2nd Pfizer shot, really comparable?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That’s incorrect. UV rays hit shade, fewer.

And looked study it’s flawed purpose. methodology: “Testers analyzed swabs surfaces levels adenosine triphosphate, signals presence animal, vegetable, bacteria, yeast mold cells, high levels found suggest transmitting illness, researchers said.”

There way identify whether cells living dead presence ATP alone. bad entire states whose governors populations either anti-vax demand everything reopens without verifying anyone’s vaccinations, might well thing. Commenters worried foreign students probably worried students TX FL.  masking (a) protect vaccinated (because vaccine), (b) protect unvaccinated (who also refuse mask), difference claiming make here?

I obviously agree unvaccinated/unmasked unacceptably cavalier others wellbeing, basically definition futile... hope so, I'm literally sitting line waiting 15min second shot packed busy moving along nicely. happy see many people community getting vaccinated. people want gotten it. case out. college, meningitis outbreak. Kids getting spinal taps find it. university gave vaccine required entry following year.

This different. people refuse wear seatbelts stupid reason? thing Sherlock. mention vaccine literally definition protection. ""Protect even though refuse protection!"" stupid logic actually pretty strict laws regulating type pool make sure people can’t access it. end, risk leave outstanding risk pool owner owner’s family guests may injured try protect public. 

I think smoking better analogy. used let people smoke public heavily restrict people smoke protect public risk. tried limit risk dangerous behavior person engaging instead society whole. would see public mask mandates flu season similar. people thought public smoking bans impossible past, gone great society safer pleasant result. questioning current rollout, established planned people know fuckton half do. There's likely good reason vaxxing people 80% point gut tells simple exactly work way. Medicine extremely complex two doses required, them. can’t accept “it becomes flu”. need better, don’t understand wouldn’t want to.

I agree. Even become another flu, flu kills *a lot people* world would unquestionably better without it.

But done already done? countries really managed domestically stamp virus, west, certainly legal, cultural, behavioral obstacles that. enough people take vaccine, what's alternative? Good luck! mods fantastic job difficult subject. don’t see reason skipping second dose, except showing bad reaction/allergy first dose. Yes first dose effective, feels incomplete. mentioned protection may last long. think believe scientists get damn vaccine. Expected ban Tuesday. damage done, see new resistant mutant happens

I hate reporting single day counts since often misleading. Looks like Portugal's 7 day average 2 deaths per day point, peak almost 300 late January. Right? ""Variants"" = engagement.

This kind clickbait-y reporting totally undermining vaccination efforts, especially since many people gather much information via headlines going dig actual study  [Transmission rate NJ lowest reported since beginning pandemic, first time number ever reported .70. think days ago ecstatic dropping .8 first time months we've obliterated couple days. course can't get complacent think fair say long keep gotten us (vaccinations staying masked havent able get vaxx'd yet) gonna get better better on.

The end really sight. love see it. Company health insurance. basically nothing pocket, fortunately That's ""triggering immune response"" mentioned. That's really bad reaction vaccine, way might get hives taking antibiotic. Right. long group legitimately undecided/wait- and-see people becomes small minority people left unvaccinated. certain point, still reached herd immunity gotten really close , address people get vaccine unless powerful incentive so, like avoiding exclusion businesses, jobs, schools, etc. latter, least that's pronounce German news also stated previously, state declares public state emergency STATE decides would mandatory public vaccinations. happened. Businesses legal authority. someone forced company get vaccine say got sick even worse died want talk getting ass sued lawsuit waiting happen. there’s Pritzker IL says mask mandate lifted “when CDC says so.” Knowing conservative CDC could years (or even never may say). % first dose needed reopen fully (which we’ve already met), I’m sure won’t different one masks. I’m hoping states (like MI) masks, too. Ehhh seems sorta true now. Lotta people died though. pays tests?  said ""it's nuts"" like people would agree said nothing support it. Seems like full friend.
