0,2021-03-30," realize weekly/monthly calculation running cumulative total calculation, right? That's 80,000 deaths vs 50,000 deaths last time weekly time point year. 80,000 vs 50,000 total. 20,000 excess deaths week. Add points 2020 points average take difference get total excess deaths. many 500000 plus covid deaths people died covid covid

::eyeroll:: Nah, Graph shows, western central EU never much better USA.  :Hear kids? march butts tv set!!""

/s we're it, put every kid wheelchairs fair children choice? blindfold kids year know like live without vision? actually imagine disabled children thinking? think they're spiteful vindictive monsters want snuff joy peers could ever have? could give shit NFL good lmao? kids gonna get hospitalized die. Covid without hospitalizations deaths caliber seasonal flu kids get time. COVAXIN better BS halted it. theyre currently clinical trials children see safe them. medications arent approved people 18 first need clinical trials test safety (and afaik, whichever one currently tested kids (i think age group like 4 11 something) looking really promising kids)

its highly likely months vaccine available anyone 4 unless freak accident happens meantime That's terrible way thinking it. Imagine times stupid drunk driver takes lives several people car crash, somehow survives themselves. They're certainly dangerous society, shunned such, think Covid killing degenerates point. Good  -5 upvotes asking people least attempt safe. Yeah, it’s fucked. No, he's scientist. qualified give us factual statements based science. clear kids get covid want wear mask. 

That mean every parent can't make informed decision. two little kids. Fauci going around saying ""well chances kid getting sick serious issues pretty low, need mask playground. That's decision every parent make themselves. Yeah, around Superbowl Sunday. bf already bought ingredients Superbowl feast got sick bummer taste lol. Fingers crossed sense taste comes back soon! family vaccinated don’t care anyone else, good here! info got. COVID far worse known vaccine issues.

Congrats hope continues well! chance many 30 vaccinated people get it. Maybe 5-30 unvaccinated would get scenario, 90% efficacy, would expect 0.5 3 vaccinated people. risk greater cost? Lol, sub sucks balls now. Yeah cost treatment linked cost capital acquisition. 

Considering hospitals seen charging $500 single dose Tylenol seems like cost treatment primarily tied greed little else. Sorry, don’t know you’re talking about, PhD irrelevant. numbers compare general population? Women naturally likely develop blood clot. Obviously he’s never met boomer cruise crowd. Notice blamed able attend reception *masks*, you’re (mostly) protected won’t care happens anyone else.

You go tough *you*, *you* can’t take anymore. can’t even wear mask maybe make easier someone else.

You don’t need make argument mask wearers selfless angels, you’ve proven it. [Half US seniors fully vaccinated hahahahahahahah stupid fucking thing say Try keep masks kids first place haha Lol wonder would Canada 😂 epidemiologist wonder effective ""surging' vaccine hotspot would be.

Once hit exponential growth curve enough time effects vaccine kick would minimum 2 weeks first dose. Thank sorry.

She back forth, leaning towards getting unknowns. However talking doctor OBGYN, recommended getting available, decided best course. Another wave? Lame they're fully vaccinated, surely perfectly safe let multiple vaccinated households meet together. 

Honestly, whole ""just vaccinated mean x y"" part pandemic hardest me. like experts pushing back finish line we're cusp crossing it. Yes. Mine came went three days. Day woke achy headachy. Later night felt like flu. Woke feeling fatigued next day much better. bouts feeling like really worn next couple days. I'd bath would wear out. None side effects made feel really awful though. 


Now I'm 11 days feel fine. republicans hate anything that’s done democrat. 75 million people voted Trump. 50% believe trump Democrats stole election. never admit Democrat good job anything. much hate hope surge ends soon, can't feel good vaccinations cases start coming again. lolll rip private University hospital Chicago husband tenure sciences I'm hoping get avoid deluge 16+. Plus mentioned established patients like I'm walking street medical records. Thank God got Biden!  Shocking. Truly. /sarcasm. family isn’t religious whole God thing weird them. arrested woman trying track actual numbers

This laziest explanation situation I've seen yet. I'm actually fairly annoyed whole thing. military beneficiary, got first shot army installation husband stationed. Made appointment second dose site left. Got call 5 days prior second dose appointment exhausted supply canceling everyone's second dose appointments.

&amp;#x200B;

What supposed now? 33 days since first dose, town, can't find Pfizer anywhere (which first dose was). There's Moderna here. I'm screwed :( think I've heard one before.

Is one level state actually confirm underreported numbers? Don’t kids. late advice ? 😂😭 theme parks Florida open months haven’t tied large increases cases. Parks reduced capacity everyone’s wearing masks, mention primarily you’re outdoors. It’s high risk stats kids flu? believe covid isn’t dangerous, couldn’t find exact numbers. I’ve mainly eating crackers broth. Tried eat cooked carrots ick - tasted like warm flavorless mush lol that's vaccine passports come play.

Put place I'm sure one issues. think best solution kids it’s kind fault putting situation. basically half people England gotten Covid? account false positives?  you’re vaccinated everyone wearing masks there’s literally nothing concerned don’t understand many commenters thread leaping objections can’t possibly keep kids interacting kids. Read article. That’s said. said kids get infected interacting multiple households unvaccinated. said avoid infection wear masks socializing. say shouldn’t part community. fact explicitly allowed fact world interacting kids. I’m denying sucks parents free make whatever rules want kids. actually read comments freaking won’t let kids see friends specifically talking best avoid infection that. sad getting lot attention mean, holy shit. way, way better expecting. gets even amazing think terms percentages.

1,907,577 people fully vaccinated Ohio. group, 34 ended getting infected. 0.00178%. group, five ended hospital. 0.000262%.

Obviously we've got wait little longer give people time get infected infections become servere, matter bend numbers unbelievably good news. Even every single person got infected vaccination got infected today, Tuesday 30^(th), would 35 cases 1497 reported Ohio today. state fully vaccinated 16% population. vaccines work work well. Damn well. Unbelievably well. kids care pledge, make it.

Kids forced pledge ""allegiance"" daily seems like weird authoritarian stuff really think it. tourism UK non-vaccinated countries? Vaccines make immune kids still thing. difference 'no evidence something works' 'evidence something work'.

Not everything life sanctioned science explicitly, fact things backed rigorous testing. extrapolate data make reasonable assumptions world.

Same reason go day tomorrow, without scientific study proving cars suddenly start exploding 1st April 2021. need data. Right! replied OP originally want persuade people personal risk, example flawed. Steak good analogy, speeding - sub freaking sensitive pointing assumed taking position. Nice See voter fraud Capitol insurrection. Nothing satisfy them. I'm baffled people satisfied Biden? Trump natural instinct science. labs helping develop vaccine giving pointers sodium hypochlorite ingestion. scientists impressed often asked next. take dose vaccine market, basically taking dose Trump's blood, sweat, tears. think two weeks ago qualified red tier. 'wait two weeks' get behind! claiming pledge political? Also, dumb. reason it’s going slow demand high, especially since way elderly compared states guy manage wrong almost everything? dare you! That's CDC's job! \#FirstWorldPriorities And? true time, based learned later, recommended cloth masks people, reinforcing points trying make now.

The dude's liar. know trying make one. learned women  actually went extent persecuting early whistleblowers start, horrifying.

I'm sure hold accountable point though? Spread around world Because... f&amp;#k testing... need anime conventions! Kids daycare whole time 5 don’t wear masks there. Yeah, pointed bad analogy. OP wants make point personal risk, reckless driving going win arguments. Outside small rise cases states currently having, no, really. Thats fine going lose business pandemic showed amorphous true herd immunity threshold difficult pin scientists. many factors play. say Israel, specific vaccine, population density, average BMI, average age, racial makeup faring well 50-60% fully vaccinated. 

I hope US follow suit similar percentages need see action first US. Israel's level month two. particular precautions

Ever course driving impacts people. discussion kids masks. Maybe better metaphor driving 5 MPH speed limit akin kids going maskless (when adults community opportunity vaccinated), whereas driving 50 MPH akin adults going maskless (without anyone vaccinated). They’re different levels risk oneself others.  europe still behind vaccinations? “Very early pandemic, early months, even many cases, shortage PPE masks health care providers needed desperately since putting lives safety line every day.

“So feeling people wanting masks community, namely people street, might hoarding masks making shortage masks even greater. context, said recommend masks.” Fauci needs step real world, kids want play friends keeping weird isolated lockdown state another year much damage long term they'd likely virus itself. need social interaction develop normally. One states went stage 4 lockdown due handful cases. 
Unfortunately keep happening vaccinated... that's long away. 

This US UK long Australia. bad. assisted livings Damn kids never get childhood years back...kinda extreme right? Yes really tough, pandemic started year death daughter peak depression.

 thank thoughts. appreciate taking time write share hard experience well.

We lost baby daughter 28 days birth. combine possibilities died, 1 40 million. alive, would extreme risk dying COVID.

Having suffered kind odds, reading arguments safe children really tough.

So, naturally, spent last year trying avoid contagion child, panicking afraid... assumed started China. There's serious theory suggests started elsewhere. 

That would quite 'coincidence' COVID happened start different continents month Wuhan outbreak, unrestricted travel inbetween. selfish asses still take valuable medical resources get sick? mostly normal week. gone could stand crunchy food, spicy stuff, bubbly drinks like sparkling water. ITT: lot people upset behalf kids care nearly much wearing mask play friends acting like mandate sort ban kids playing together. whole thread worst. Feels like everyone already decided team they're want yell now. depressing. Whole thing sucks. Thanks u/Pessimist2020. appropriate name. point think Fauci says things, knows it’s practical somebody give responsible advice. think guys get tunnel vision see problems isolation. Yeah, I'm Californian far prefers CA's pandemic response FL's (despite issues restrictions outdoors), facts facts. Florida disaster people predicted September. fact, CA state did. far undercounting deaths go, there's plenty evidence CA undercounted deaths early pandemic. People need drop narrative Florida fudging numbers absurd considering lax restrictions Florida. Florida even older population working it.

That said, also bad narrative. every Florida, there's Arizona Mississippi (0.27%, 0.31%). FL average response, yes, perhaps DeSantis's policies led Florida deaths necessary -- maybe better leadership could've closer Oregon Vermont.

But know after-the-fact post hoc analyses done. much California's winter surge due SoCal variant? effect doid endemic poverty/multigenerational housing Latino community (compare Bay Area LA) play? Right now, pure speculation, think sides FL/CA comparisons disingenuous. wrote almost exact comment. feel much. past 10 years, we've lost 242,000 Americans Flu.

In past 1 year, we've lost half million(probably closer 750k point count incidentals) Covid.

Can tell one worse? Sodium hypochlorite=bleach exactly I’m at. 3 almost 4 yr old see clearly taking toll mentally. think would devastating isolated another year. She’s still home think we’re sending back June. It’s terrifying decision make. hope I’m making right one. Maybe wear seatbelt walking street.

This he’s basically saying here, everyone wants vaccinated be, children COVID doesn’t affect children worse flu, continue wearing masks.

They keep continuing move goal posts.

You might get sick, might get hit car walking street. Enoughs enough already, everyone wants shot get one over.  20 mins. town hasnt changed much since 04 besides cabaloosas gone 😢 I've worked fr ont line hosp ital. isolated kid people around ignored it. missed lot. enough information know kids pretty safe. I'm still careful. I'm always masked. 4 year old masked unless accidentally falls running around. still go park every day like used to. still put halt everything came contact work. growing cousin missing that. Next fall starts school. one wear green shoes blue socks, blue shoes green socks “that’s way goes!!!” *proceeds go gibberish fit wrong colors*

You gotta love em. gonna sensitive feedback probably stay internet. kidding rate we're vaccinating expect venues full stuff reopened referring beginning pandemic said wear mask people panic buy all? know lot virus spread point either. kid better theirs, get it. Meanwhile town started vaccinating age 60+. Noone younger get unless certain jobs require it. Nah think undercounted nursing home deaths fucked up. see, ny hit march April wasnt substantial amount test available. federal government said would disappear like miracle. korea already done 160 thousand test march 12 done 2000!! nation. nyc hit massive surge cuomo fucked placing sick elderly back nursing homes. trying cover Headline slightly misleading—the Seder Saturday, it’s soon rise attributed don’t wear one. people want wear mandates expire it. It’s hurting others cares. think new administration unbiased source? think want look good take responsibility? better way pretending start square 1. know masks work know children age groups get COVID, incredibly unlikely scenario like meteorite. trying argue here?

For reference here's rates per age group: provide actual logic scientific findings poor recommendation since zero facts provided ""pro-science"" argument.  Try duct tape 75% covid deaths 65+, 1% 40. Half 65 population one shot least month ago, 73% 65+ gotten first shot today 40 million Americans, 96 million first doses 50+ probably point. 

So 65-75% people age demographic saw 99% deaths first shot least, data showing significant immunity 2 weeks first shot. scared right now? 

Wasn’t goal limit deaths, keep hospital admissions down? large majority demographic saw 99% deaths immunity, bad theoretical fourth wave be? she’s scared shitless don’t even want know handled third wave. said wear mask masks purchased fear (like toilet paper) really needed (nurses, medical conditions, etc) would able get it. seen lie herd immunity. AstraZeneca applied emergency use authorization United States. love ""you're conspiracy theorist"" common response presented nothing factual information vibe beliefs. need try disprove information, cry conspiracy theory move along. Hilarious world live in. death sad 34 1.8 million pretty encouraging numbers. talking .0018 1% thats insanely good. curious people think virus came from? still answer befuddles me. day cares Needles reason love getting shots (still do... highlight day usually)... got Covid vaccine last weekend (Moderna #1) literally felt nothing.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That’s seems indicate. 3.3 million seems. DeSanti's strategy: deny, deny, deny? data scientist got fired participate sham. Point hypocritical people whining saying they're tired masks, tired distancing, government tell I'm tired it. Want kids back school because... reasons. comes someone else's kid, well kid live bubble. many doses think prior administration ordered? many think ordered? adults get vaccine (because exist) good enough reason say, ""screw it, masks""?? believe 7-10 days, sure Let play playground. Keep away kids. Dont wonder “oh even get Covid” kid playing kids playground. It’s stopping spread get vaccinated. Children super spreaders. It’s us well adults. It’s irresponsible kids mixing children rn. That’s Pfizer vaccine though One might say common sense, controversial all... remembered planet lived on... lucky kid goes 5 minutes wearing June. right you. Eight month old working remotely caring child. limits. never tired frustrated lonely entire life. It’s best worst year life. alone. think it’s safe say everyone minding fucking business point.  I'm sorry rude you. drained work, frustrated negativity virus.  


I'm sorry again. one reading article super dramatic time, usual. Fauci admitted lying repeatedly order try shape public opinion. unethical unbecoming. US world weren’t sequencing high rate December/January. sequencing rate March-November 2020 would seen tons variants slightly different characteristics came went well. What’s point vaccine we’re still gonna wear masks? agreed said wear mask said lied number people need vaccinated reach herd immunity? Why?   Let’s see “public knowledge” proof then. easy it’s public knowledge right? Glad hear that! long start finish?

Side note, new paltz since graduated back 04, wonder much area changed. cases prevent first place, less transmissible virus becomes NY adults next week  saw another subreddit, guy ask doctor get vaccines. doctor said, find reddist(?) state. literally headline people still even reading that. smh. Remember required people source claims unbiased sources? Every parent: “duh”  say someone grew farm, 4 brothers sisters time, can't remember playing kids. learned read 4, parents enrolled kindergarten, would accept could read, long birthday December 31st. remember hiding bed first day. friends school, fifth grade. wore glasses, lisp, wore special shoes. hell. cases two years younger class mates, born November started regular school. could class work, always problem making friend. (Thank Cecilia treating like human. ) think wrong. important learn get along. always trouble entire work life due failing actually them, won’t. don’t judge parenting decisions others accuse parents take kids playground wanting kids die.  guy jumped shark needs relieved duty, wear two masks living room. Keep mind kids super adaptable healthy situations. suffer serious abuse/neglect can't turn ship around. heard risk blood clots women birth control pills 1/1000 - so? true, seems silly thing let torpedo likelihood people taking AZ. live Bay Area I'm lucky one lol. vaccinated worried 7 year old getting covid? isn’t lower risk many illnesses? 7 years old don’t even symptoms. Seems like risk aversion gone wild opinion. Fauci understand damn thing mental health child development? damage social skill development alone probably catastrophic young kids. he’s gonna move goal posts more? yes getting cuz would still staying Trump recovered people Israel authorities recommend one dose.

Not sure what's response rate though. don’t worry kids  hard get shot? CT opened age groups several weeks early, sign website call day two schedule appointment. really want vaccine early go hang CVS, Walgreens vaccination site near closing time they'll give leftover shots anyone schedule next shot. Well, kinda. actually selfish assholes every age group.

Possibly extremely elderly (haven't met lot those), groups, yes. like Redlands...In College Station, TX 80 percent. Moderna’s one stored fridge 30 days.

Imperial College also producing vaccine combat variants  old kids? 13 yr old A's B's pandemic. finally back school antidepressants lack person interaction puberty. struggled barely pass last quarter. politics half Chinese, imagine. interesting whether 20% get one talking family doctor. get physical minor rash need looked at. assume 2022 “do COVID vaccine?” standard question practically every visit. Children need get sick. Socially isolating them, constant hand hygiene, making wear masks weaken immune system long run.

I'm suggesting become ill life threatening viruses intentionally exposed sick people, need exposed viruses build immune system. viruses, varicella, obtained later childhood years make far sick get younger. COVID less harmful even influenza children. And, previously mentioned, critical social development happens younger years. Yes, Fauci suggesting children completely isolated, deserve carefree reasonably uninhibited play. 

Furthermore, children may wear masks wear properly. play touch mouths eyes, making masks pretty much obsolete benefit anyways. I'm reasonable precautions seems unrealistic me. mean got virus naturally potentially immunity variants? Finally someone listened actually said. love people crystal ball well regarding long term effects going children get COVID. realize likely die, science still 'out' kinds impact later lives. Interesting parents make kids wear clothes claim can't make wear masks. Lazy parenting. could.


But again, study says nothing aerosol transmission covid. didn’t study aerosol transmission covid here. ask: always wear yours? ever complain front kids?

Just curious. Last checked, *only* country Chile. kid (who 3 started) playing kids masks year. don’t understand comment. It’s public health recommendation / guideline always somewhat conservative need suit situation. Hell kids get sick time. remember common occurrence basically sent slip home saying student pink eye/strep/other illness last week monitor kids. Funny mentioned that. daughter frequently mask car home reason. thought showing off. Nope, didn’t notice — smartie decided made sense since going wear school anyway returned in-person. proud child. Depending state, teachers may already vaccinated. kids going daycare entire time one quarantine. transmission school whatsoever. MoRaL oBliGaTiOn. I'm sorry, want cite sources that, moron?? know mom's former employer, tell hello from?? Drunk power, frustrated nothing works. It’d fascinating weren’t terrifying. admit idea talking about. Glad could clear up. Noting this. Mask compliance high am. think issue reopening move based vaccine numbers cases. come air media sources fawning Psaki's ""circle-back"" rhetoric? Wow, BDS real totally better waste time Corona horray former Illinoisan living Idaho, pretend Fred Meyer Meijers' Anglo-Saxon cousin. heart knows I'm Kroger Ok, like many leftists I've confronted past, ask question. serious virus let untested people cross border droves? side says follow science regarding COVID, use science back argument. Unlike you, I'm using political bias (however moronic may be), template frame questions. Again, inquiry simple. stated above, evidence-based science supporting Biden allowing border? also might want address letting anyone media area. nothing hide, point hiding? Instead down-voting statement oblivion, blow away intelligence address question like adult? I’m saying US isn’t interfering elections Latin America anymore.

Bolivia? Venezuela? Lmao people really hamburgers brains.  dawg line literally makes sense it’s infuriating essential worker. honestly it’s available need it, go aboit flu coughing sneezing people Ugh....

495 people turn AZ jabs city yesterday, make worse..... think better tin foil theory people want discredit vaccine sold cost drive people towards expensive alternative.

I believed EU discredited AZ shot first time around political reasons mainly. Germany always strong pharma industry funded healthcare research  next day me, kinda like someone punched there. friend trouble lifting arm. low fever didn’t Whilst get you’re saying, it’s risk person getting fatal covid, it’s risk transmission mutation well Wearing mask protect people know sick. absolutely that, jist like many asians do.

But theres point randomly wearing stop getting sick outside pandemic. makes sense, except e.g. hospital. young. need 15 2005 one last received it. really good solution obvious doable: immediately match variant surges vaccination surges target vulnerable going are, cities states experiencing active outbreaks—an effort modeled public-health tool called “ring vaccination.” Ring vaccination involves vaccinating contacts potential contacts cases, essentially smothering outbreak surrounding immunity. this, surge scale, essentially ring-vaccinating whole cities even states. find ironic source found yesterday subsequently disproven viable source statement given amsourcdmfornthat statement. edit comment link fantastic comment explains this.  wonder happen? force driving absurd decisions? actually enough people believe wearing mask beach actual measure covid wins political support, people government simply drunk power? We're exposed germs time, true, masks still good line defense. country embargo neighboring super power survive?

What kind stupid reporting this? devastating embargo half century, still better neighboring countries.  know, daughter got similar reaction strep throat. Post infection post viral conditions always issue. Parent health groups full kids happened to. Underestimated underreported?

It decision made state officials accident.

Come on, use proper language reporting criminal actions. I've legit never heard debacle. I've visited sub regularly year

I've popped [the Wik find outbreak's contours somewhat baffling. H1N1 broke Ft. Dix NJ, killing one (a soldier made 5-mile forced march) &amp; hospitalizing 13. Ford Administration swung action, leading full one-quarter U.S. population get vaccinated ... 3 peeps died heart attacks getting vaxxed, although deaths found caused vaccine. Rather peculiar around

So where's debacle? Ford Admin went whole hog flu shots, probably preventing major outbreak, 3 peeps died vaccine. whole thing happened nearly 50 fecken years ago. I'm seeing anything resembling real ""long term side effects"" deter people getting vaxxed vs COVID **Taxpayers** invested vaccine development. Saying taxpayers vs ""a country"" makes poignant reminder remembered talking vaccines developed public funding. supposed get vaccine tomorrow. think I’ll wait Janssen... Canadian I'm beyond fucking apathetic point. I've seen like 30 different people last year work 23 them. Premier openly blamed age group, telling us ruining everything. sit back line people debate whether get vaccine.

We opened 55 65 20% people know getting it. Yet willing sign trials PM fucked up.

Sure COVID end soon, I'm sure Universe find new way discriminate generation reward others.  whole COVID open borders story non-sense conservative talking point used rile mouth breathing fools. Biden president two months. don’t expect Biden solved complicated multifaceted immigration crisis 60 days. expect approach compassion, competency, real solutions push better outcomes next 18 months - say anything Trump did/touched. 

Trump supporters bad people. Leaders actually listen act according science clear coordinated manner nationally, would wager.

Originally, prosecutor asked 3 years jail additional fine 50 million VND (around 2166 USD) according epidemic control law. However, cooperation authorities telling travel history (albeit very, belatedly), lack criminal record, father sick, sentence reduced judge. Besides several sources saying Biden considering mileage tax pay infrastructure projects, wtf pandemic response? Cloth mask actually protect others around quite bit spit would otherwise flying face. Anything stops direct airflow mouth nose helps. non n95/kn94/kn95 type masks much stop someone exposed getting it, even then, help droplet transmission. Ever gotten accidentally spit talking friend face face? That's masks help with. problem smelling garlic breath... that's need n95. Yet. thing is, building immune system great. that. reality lot people gotten sick died covid bc weren’t healthy. get vaccine! good Even we’re 65%, that’s pretty significant chunk population greater 90% immunity/protection severe illness. Israel already seeing huge decline cases around 50% country vaccinated 1+ dose believe, it’s like it’s 75% nothing. Basically every website counts vaccinations. really want get vaccinated, AstraZeneca. (Not anymore even wanted.) looks like higher probability die AstraZeneca Covid. others though calculation surely different. 

So reputation AstraZeneca vaccine really horrible Germany now, would make free everyone wants it. Everyone get informed risks, high personally, decide want not. limit get AstraZeneca much like now, lot doses left help fight pandemic. California Contact Tracer ~1 year here. Whole 9 person household gotten it. Newborns grandparents house gotten it. extremely easy many people get 1 person, genetic differences, would guess individual behavioral differences make situations differ anything. Older ppl super worried long term effects confuse me. mean 70 already....a child understand Absolutely. Nobody mentions ""non-essential"" workers lost jobs, businesses, etc. one knows exactly say them. imagine we'll finally hear eviction moratorium finally ends see explosion people put homes.  happily taking credit fruits investment. mean, guys use negative numbers describe normal every day temperatures. That’s weird man. Michigander living West Coast, god miss Meijers. nice see Germany reaping benefits investment. 
/s usually wear masks properly enjoying nightlife. ( new outbreaks Busan ) Helper T-Cell response, protective immune response.

No... Th cells activated, need cells already infected (secondary antigen exposure). That's protective immunity cells need infected immune response kick in. lag time secondary exposure antibody response 3-4 days. SARS-CoV-2, viral titers highest pre-symptomatic stages infection rapid viral seeding downregulation type IFN. So, time antibody response kicks in, already got infection. 

Not mention, natural infection (and vaccination) favors Th1 cells Th2. Th2 associated humoral responses whereas Th1 associated cellular responses, macrophages particular. Macrophage response exactly want SARS-CoV-2 infection. M1 macrophage polarization response intracellular pathogens (i.e. viruses) triggers monocyte-derived macrophages enter lungs leads macrophage activation syndrome cytokine storm. initial Th2 response infection (found largely children...children MISC Th1 response) fair much better SARS-CoV-2 infection strong Th1 response.

Its interesting men much lower compared what's expected. got numbers I'm calling natural occurrence [from interesting source right, German numbers still lower might expect. Australia chiming in. doctors treat covid patients still received vaccine dose yet. One infected Brisbane recently. Maybe also EU tired AZ's refusal stick contract _from beginning_ look reason get AZ stuff anymore? mean, would've preferred would've ordered enough Biontech vaccines _early on_ Frenchies think ordering promising GERMAN shots en masse would literally ""vaccine nationalistic"" No, employer former insurance company killed it. Walgreens bungling end vaccine rollout several points along way, state indicator. Disappointing. something different makes difference Germany UK.

The vaccine shot millions Uk side effects seen, unusual. cause mutations possibility nullifying vaccines. Plus, always going people can’t get vaccine medical reasons people deserve able socialize ignorant anti-vaxxers. Amongst unvaccinated. always leave part out. read all?
how break you

influenza average yearly deaths  24,200

covid 19 average yearly deaths 250,000+ counting.

can see tiny little difference numbers? morons actually address BS Biden admin peddling? wife factor v leiden. gut instinct. 
Given female cases Scandinavian countrys much higher rates, also Wales much lower genetic variance rest UK recall reading much less anglo saxon guessing much lower rate factor v leiden. that's people distancing, wearing masks, careful. Could imagine would without precautions? swear people death wish. fine. vaccinating record rates, still wearing masks, distancing much before. People mainly spending time outside weather great. Let people relax little. Medical professionals worry. always worry. job description :). Would consider person average higher intelligence? also know news side effects Hungary. seems happen countries, others.

While 200 000 AstraZeneca doses administered Hungary, people age 60, 2-3 cases could happened statistically. nothing news announced, vaccinations never even paused Hungary. 

The reason pausing would increase doubt vaccine hesitancy, people would want get AstraZeneca vaccine. Impossibly predict, point guess eventually see second doses recommended J&amp;J recipients.

There vaccines work well single doses. directly affected Biden's tax BS, let know. went though Obama. parents could barely pay mortgage Obama's tax hikes! Unless direct experience situations like I've described, better keep quiet. I’m sitting one dangerous Michigan counties I’ve seen two people wear masks correctly last four days.  think since Michigan amazing job vaccinations, don’t need wear masks anymore go indoor restaurants friends.  started days got first shot.
I honestly wonder whether increasing vaccine distribution could make Michiganders even careless. Maybe first Vanity Fair interview desperate make impact. hadn’t seen anything Arkansas, New Mexico, Wyoming yet, 4 list April 19th maybe they’ve moved since. Good hear! works. Biden wants use pay plan climate-change policies. 
When family owns small business think clear now. Seems like EU brokered poor deal. sad witch hunt cover fact up. wonder percentage GDP would better measure, eh? Factor iv leiden one genetic difference prominent northern European women causes clotting. 

My wife it, less prevalent row. 

Its prominent nin Scandinavia, would explain. Norways issues. look headlines AZ vaccine getting, news good news. Yes, show vax card negative STD tests go hell.

I’ll show &amp; proof r/Vasectomy.
Gen X sends love anti-vaxers. Who'da thunk it? foolish perspective found one here: 
There *so many* available appointments right opened registration adults, booked. Hopefully new appointments soon. take care citizens first without helping unfortunate areas.

Hit proof, fam. makes intuitive sense assume vaccine production requires intensive labour, true. nothing permanent temporary government program. They'll show who's registered sex offender Zero evidence covid-induced myocarditis leads permanent heart damage. 

Do source available evidence suggests temporary conditio

Again, keep saying this. see many viruses including relatively innocuous ones common cold, influenza, herpes, mono, several bacterial fungal infections easily treated rarely lead death. 

So saying bunch common regular diseases cause particular symptom...so SARS-CoV-2 shouldn't?

That's like saying many chemical compounds cause issues. H20, NACL, etc...so here, take HCN (hydrogen-cynaide). really make evidence college athlete infected covid fully recovered.

Do source every college athlete infected covid fully recovered?

I quick Google [this seems died covid.

When fully recover dying? get 75% people country vaccinated

Will get vaccinated think need it?

What gets stuck 65%? 

Covid forever. Great. actually happening? Adjusted inflation, wwii cost US $4T. Depends consider ""immunity."" cells protective immunity. still get infected. still get sick. might get sick. But, data paper impressive there's around 3 11 seem decently high cell responses. Read clarifying comment deleting snarky one. It’s still issue Read Search adenovirus thrombocytopenia. Turns exactly rare secondary effect gene therapy using adenovirus, precisely AZ (but also J&amp;J Sputnik) use.

I bit puzzled taken long make link, based literature existing ore decade side effect almost expected! dismissing athletes myocarditis. arguing severity and/or importance finding. Zero evidence covid-induced myocarditis leads permanent heart damage. available evidence suggests temporary condition, one see many viruses including relatively innocuous ones common cold, influenza, herpes, mono, several bacterial fungal infections easily treated rarely lead death. addressed point earlier. 

Maybe wording bit strong. evidence college athlete infected covid *not* fully recovered. words, may long-term effects don’t know about. short-term, recovered. Fucking awesome. future shit I’ve waiting for. governments still trying give vaccine may end harm good vaccine supposed prevent death cause it. Yeah, although it'll suck April, states opening eligibility later likely fare better long run (provided decent strategy vaccinate stragglers) probably see big bump winter super stupid article. Wild animal farm??? animal farmed, domesticated animal.  r/nottheonion Imagine trying strong arm team moderators everyone knows 😂😂 Streisand effect never see addressed articles, social aspect Latino neighborhoods. 'failed'. Many chose get tested. tested positive quarantine, taking family coworkers job....disaster. many chose get tested. Maybe fast enough, many county's offer hotel rooms, homeless, people living congregate situations.  can't force people test, force stay motel infect others. vegan cocaine lecture unethical meat production is.

Folks complicated mess. go back look subreddit news articles time. Anybody following production schedules contracts pfizer moderna would told same. 

This you?

Seems like made whole lot assumptions news articles subreddits read, well much following production schedules. That's cute.  got corporate. Sluggers still though. people vaccinated, front line workers received J&amp;J advised receive mRNA vaccine? Okay, what's plan? Masks work, vaccines eventually overtaken variants, millions cases every major country. epiemiologists want us do? Speculation destroying evidence evidence little it, neither Biden. said mention arent enough shots people higher priority list want one, governors shouldn’t expanding eligibility yet. 

I don’t care politics either, I’d hate see deluge 20-30 year olds like swamping appointments beleaguered governor wanted score cheap points.

But knows, maybe Texas New York successful vaccinating high priority folks there’s enough healthy young people now.... .....  spent adjusting inflation? 

Nah. Quit lying, yo. know Justin Turner tested positive game already action pulled. told stay field disobeyed. MLB nothing that. swear every time go Reddit see someone UK they’re either bashing US generally US healthcare system. states praised vaccine hesitant population, many cases effectively people praise state opening vaccine general public early.

Also, though much state government encourage vaccine uptake, many states low uptake less be. people vaccinated, front-line workers received J&amp;J advised receive mRNA vaccine? Well said. COVID certainly issue, nothing wrong questioning whether go far times. 

Sensationalism seems dying vaccines roll people look future, time many people, evaluating public officials government response, seemed correlate direness COVID predictions draconian measures leadership capability levelheadedness. I'd imagine there's factor virus spreading well Africa due hot humid climates, low population density throughout much continent. Destroying evidence, evidence. February NY? vaccinated, front line workers received J&amp;J advised receive mRNA vaccine? Wait vaccinated mean test positive antibody test? consistantly improving, one best country, issue parts US move slowly, many different groups people we're going add one letter 'x' per year? getting right? Kids germ magnets, probably likely kids going school daycare living anyone. obviously never planned large event. anime event scheduled months ago, yes brings site much needed revenue.  vaccine clinic even know much vaccine would week ago, planning hours/sites personnel shot dark. think great job making work both. Since 5000 Chinese died covid theory holds weight. Many countries sure took opportunity trim population. Energy falls two groups- kinetic energy potential energy. look Britain example 50% people average antibodies- still leaves 50% open infection. 15% Americans full vaccinated- leaving many not. isn’t over- ton potential energy remaining system, thus ton potential infections occur. Except states right now. California literally hired Blue Shield manage roll Newsom realized idea fuck doing. going better ever since. graphs countries willing cop to...I don’t think we’ll ever completely accurate idea happened it’s over...US definitely better I’m proud Imagine that. essential people though. New guidelines US, yes. Yeah even remotely issue. Trump around like 1 month vaccine rollout. bible thumping. ordered evidence destroyed let happen long time ago.

Proceeds draw conclusions based evidence said doesn’t exist.

The irony. 

Yes I’ll downvoted pointing out. downside pandemic ending need come new excuse confront self esteem body image issues put there. Haha, says ""probe"". graph Philippines absolutely bonkers. never said that.

You're right. mixed another poster. figure athletes suffering heart disease covid nowhere near 5-15%. 

An small, early study Ohio State athletes found \~15% [athletes larger study Vanderbilt found [3% covid postive myocarditis. Larger, robust studies need done, I'd like see sources rate myocarditis amongst college Thousands athletes every single one fully recovered. 

That's interesting. read no, way confront novel things science drawing baseless assumptions comparing similar phenomena well studies seeing apply new phenomena. 

Which viruses talking about? I'd like see data it. 


We know SARS-CoV-1 [damages  


Which similar viruses talking about? Like Justin Turner? 

They would pull whoever game, maybe, announce fact. one would ever know. mean like Biden ""loves"" us much taxes us per mile?

Taken way around makes sense, think:

1. AZ doses available, thought unsuitable people 60 (or 65, whatever) 
2. Therefore doses given groups would yet eligible vaccination otherwise. 
3. AZ considered suitable older people thus people 60 moved back queue older age groups done.

However, framed like rather taking vaccination away younger people (which point would high risk groups due occupation, e.g. teachers). far know measures announced give different vaccine. Multiple possible explanations; UK changing figures weren’t thorough vigilance; blood clots associated low platelets younger, mostly female, population, quite specific. bots key NJ.

In case, comment point “100% safe” poor choice criterion almost anything life, definitely vaccines. I'm changing goal posts, even sure mentioned this

Infact comment clearly says "" ***Not agree*** politic point scoring ***could*** say... ""

Could &amp; ""Not agree"" key words

the original guy comments "" What's political gain here? ""

and gave example could theory politician facing anger vaccine rollout general, use either poor delivery's worries around safety hide behind gain.

as say

""AZ meger 10% expected vaccine deliveries Q2.""

""thus cuasing slow roll out""

**or**

"" withdraw main vaccine caused problems""

""thus cuasing slow roll out""

Ive never claimed either reasons slow rollout gave example politician could use scapegoats

And pushed blame elsewhere completely somewhat.

""Although fair, AZ least partly blame slow rollout ""

if believe true, whether agree politician could ***theory*** use deflect blame.

You've taken comment way literally I'm saying 100% reasons rollout slow worries safety, I'm never mostly horse blood vodka right? 6/10 children survived 1st dose? would even go far say particularly surprised Sputnik main vaccine used EU. tough times show real friends EU clearly either UK US Yea honest really know solution cause problem is. know experiences horrible one serious cases really happy spend money saved get best experience Dad stuck shitty hospital 2 weeks hallucinating constantly moved different sections, even move private hospital NHS doctors able sign forms needed.

We're expecting enough vaccine doses year vaccinate almost everyone Germany twice (i.e. 4 times, 2 times single-shot J&amp;J vaccine). Including kids anti-vaxxers.

It's we're expecting Q2-Q4 instead Q1-Q3 like US UK. Everything 2 3 months behind US/UK schedule.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* right, blatant scaremongering.  I'll definitely disappointed stays 100k year. really affect everyone care getting vaccinated, it'll still pretty sad see. comparison flu kind place, really comparing apples apples, like 40% Americans get flu vaccine every year, vaccine usually roughly 50% effective. think lot 50% Americans get covid vaccine, also hugely effective. fair, nothing anyone wfh job could do. can't blamed keeping safe killer pandemic fortunate enough kind job done remotely. 

The blame what's going happen rightly fall government (both local federal) ignoring issue entirely. could used stimulus money help people needed most, instead sent amount everyone, regardless whether starving fine. wfh friends used cash expensive new toys vacations; unemployed friends basically got weeks totally run money. Honestly, scary read.  I’m ready get jabbed I’m constantly iffy AstraZeneca trying follow along it’s safe hard. Here's original link website details:

[COVID-19 Vaccine R&amp;D Yoir right NHS suck ways fucked sister scanning even though kept going e pains. took one docter belive since caught late incurable bone cancer. lot problems NHS stem lack funding think country need address almost like there's agenda... probably rethink trials work general.

We’ve underestimated virtually every facet virus, I’m going believe limited way Oh, I'd forgotten Imperial. recall they'd cooked something up, heard much.

It's another form University challenge enjoy. issue surgical masks,is filter media may good, air go it. reason prefer breathing comfort air comes gaps unrestricted. Use whatever comfortable with, test test shows massive amount particulate comes surgical masks. I've seen low 11% 60s%. cup hands around mouth create seal surgical mask, many almost unbreathable vs n95. US also export ban vaccines place EU exporting quite lot. BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine used outside US like WHO's vaccination program produced EU, Aztrazeneca comes either EU India. EU export ban would lot available EU rest world would even fucked. Yeah draw back see blood getting syringe, go another area

At least thats I'm told funding announcement commitment identifiable recipient directed towards development vaccine candidates. **This excludes funding directed basic research, vaccine purchases, funds directed increase manufacturing capacity, supply vaccines technology transfers**.

Here's Thank you! Thank explanation. Don’t sporting events right require negative test vaccination card? Bad enough 20-60 year old health workers suddenly dying cause people concerned though? seems unlikely relate that.. takeaway really focus paying vaccine research sexy saved global economy much worse scenario.

CSVT commonly causes hospitalisation death something easily missed, kind rates we've seen Germany would add hundreds thousand UK right related factor V Leiden. That's visible something could realistically covered up. wife almost certainly safe, least risk result factor V Leiden gene.

It could another gene, unlikely prevalence gene would different Germany, Scandinavia, UK. I'm really torn NHS. really amazing things ""free"" (we pay taxes).

But hand I've take people hospital pretty much every time they've bit shit. Tried take Dad scan one done someone else floor name mix up.

Terrible communication. hospital 2 weeks get talk doctor 2 minutes morning, different doctor every time really know whats going on. doctor say something one morning next say something completely different.

And visiting hours always allowed in, call really give update.

And lastly actually want go private really hard infrastructure setup NHS patient stable state allowed transfer.

Also technology sucks. send important booking information via letter (although within past couple years least improved use texts now). Email thing quite long time. put fact huge organisation never going able efficient. people still want thing? Jfc. numbers take *age* account, though? rate much lower among young people. I’m sorry think 100% made wrong decision. blood clotting issues incredibly rare. You’re likely get serious case covid get blood clotting people brought chances getting blood clotting birth control pills much higher, yet doesnt stop people taking them. 

This whole scare AZ vaccine killing me. It’s touch, realize you’re taking stop getting spreading deadly disease right? It’s discouraging see governments people take step backwards fear. It’s like completely forgot fuck need vaccines. province this? total death count germany COVID age group 0-29 entire year

**63**

not many people age group would need die adverse effects vaccine ""not worth it"".

PEI safetyreport (Pauk-Ehrlich-Institut Sicherheitsreport) say many age group died vaccine. say entire age rage, like 24y-87y. total age range adjusted 2 time already **at least 2** people 29 died far vaccine complication.
 
factor young people hardly getting vaccination hard see vaccination beeing stopped/halted. AZ given people sub 55.

I wish clear data here. show exactly many died age group underlying issues etc. hard.

Another interesting thing, really vivid, detailed dreams night shots.

To play safe, I'd plan feeling bit weather 2nd. rolled campaign getting vaccinated end whole debacle - full stop. vaccines enough people take them. qualified medical statements, wishy washy mask wearing future shit - take shot, end pandemic. Everything else noise. take shot, fine.

However, understandably concerns raised AZ younger people compared others like Pfizer.

Also, thanks work pandemic know must constantly challenging. That’s healthcare workers elderly care individuals. See study size (2,200 participants) incidence Covid placebo vaccine groups small. Forgives article larger, 40k people trial total cases groups around 150.

I’m much smaller trial making 100% efficacy claim probably instances vaccine group 5 placebo group.

People also dying showers 🤷 That's right, Jay! spouse definitely symptoms Covid without testing positive back December. well definitely close contact confirmed positive cases January multiple negative tests. surprised since confirmed we're sure. issue AZN releasing interim data. issue issued press release data also final data available. interim data better efficacy number, obviously looked better, literally fake news complete evidence showed better estimate efficacy slightly lower.

Going age sex, given blood clotting associated forms birth control already, wouldn’t surprised association there. change mood striking. agree Germany gas done quite well relatively large Western countries. instead going spark speculation whether vaccinated people need continue socially distance, wear masks, etc

I think conversation need start having. 90% 12 days, one explanation. soon, looking mid summer results, August approval (given month process). Results April frankly seem bit fast know. appears largely regional increases. hope FEMA gets deployed, extra doses (preferably JnJ) gets surges areas. long rises regional, fought. Serious Question : mean inactivated virus vaccines work better new variants?
Since immune system identifies entire virus body, rather spike?  guessing comment intended encourage people get vaccinated, instead going spark speculation whether vaccinated people need continue socially distance, wear masks, etc. saying ""data suggests"" vague. really needs lot careful says. Yes hence “more than” probably closer 400 million end. plenty opportunity get vaccinated chosen to, totally agree risk decision mine.  suspect many individuals also anti-maskers might convince get vaccinated. 

The primary challenge timing. states far ahead others vaccine distribution. 

Until states get caught determine / 18 vaccinated, IMO still need cautious. common labs study regional viruses? % labs would studying type virus? work field guy internet? Wow brilliant peace research, must took ages come study Especially Biontech fucking country countries get dips vaccines. that? Germany handled first wave pandemic well praised it. been. national guard called setup additional vaccination sites states cases increasing, 40+ million vaccine doses unused sitting states, 20-30 million coming next week. unacceptable time cases ticking up.

Ok said true, UK given north 20 million people dose AstraZeneca jab far Italians ""easy fine""? even mean? honestly think poeple fined happy compliant? 

The **real** difference central government quickly came strict regulations. lockdown quarantine enforced, majority population sacrificed comfort (and many income, well) greater good. spent 2 whole months indoors, non-essential business shut down. shopping, traveling, visiting friends family, nothing. everyone happily gone merry selfish way, police done shit. 

tl;dr: Government sense civic duty. We're ""easy fine"".

LOL PM meanwhile kicked blatant incompetence Yup. Hospitalizations significantly. Vaccines moving fast enough. still hope, people circle vaccinated, concerning. 300 mln? thought going more! 200 pfizer, 70 az, 55 j&amp;j 40 moderna BioNtech one, right? That's good news! company plans request emergency use authorization 12- 15-year-olds coming weeks, ""with hope starting vaccinate age group start next school year,"" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said statement. 

Really fantastic.

Also Pfizer trials ages 6-11 started last week, trials ages 6 months - 2 years start soon.

Presumably also bodes well Moderna trials, since vaccines similar. Moderna already enrolling kids young 6 months. good point. Unfortunately many interesting compounds great potential difficult put market large-scale clinical trials obscenely expensive. next three weeks decisive... also means virus replicating fewer times within person infection, likely holds vaccines (though course unproven).

So even infection, fewer replications means fewer chances mutate. I've seen lot people make dubious claims even vaccinated ""can still get infected, still variant-producing factories,"" there's really scientific basis claims outside ""technically true"" (in sense technically true house cat tiger dangerous, killer felines).

So vaccines get lower likelihood ever disease, lower likelihood producing large numbers viral particles get it, likely smaller chance create meaningful mutations. guess 30 million Italy recently discovered stowed away ? summer going historic petri dish.... effect, day vaccinate, effect observed 1st 12 days. get protection day 12 significant protection day 18 1st shot. Second invested, yet slow vaccinations. Glad see got monies worth. Guess one looked France yet... New variants continue arise decades, probably rest lifetimes. choose fearful them, recognize it’s big deal, viruses mutate, it’s Good point thank you. 484 points 9 months ago\*📷 

Italy here: USA basically moronic control country.

You guys saw happened us. big time advantage still managed fuck up.

The fun fact still magic absurd: wearing masks social distancing.

Why fucking hard that?

And even BLM protests.

Really loss words here, plain absurd.

Hospitalizations 2400 1930 3 weeks ago NJ. don’t enough people vaccinated completely disconnect case counts hospitalization death. won’t bad last surge expect definitely going see increases. happened sub last couple days? post explaining would helpful. goalpost shifting means people less likely comply. every time numbers improve, goalposts shifted there's still progress people bother following restrictions there's point. 1% sounds small also consider kids tend positive days school noticeable symptoms. tell definitely spreading bit daughter's school (in MA), though uncontrollably. likely wouldn’t difference vaccinated. takes least 14 days vaccine cause high levels antibodies system. get virus, replicating cells day 1. immune system responding virus well spike protein vaccine generated you.

I doctor, I’m speculating. variant known vaccines extremely effective. dangerous variant spreads easier higher fatality rate, good news dealt exact way original Covid. Maybe Trump something cut funding WHO🤔 It’s deliveries altogether. 300 million deliveries expected next 3 months, might better thought weeks ago. Plus politically optics better seem prioritising health economy, Conservative politician. harder Labour criticise caution went hard Tories easing lockdown businesses last year. Frustration distribution depending are. state (Missouri) we’ve couple stories thousands vials went certain towns literally house like 80 people, forcing people administering vaccine quickly go social media vaccines wasted.

Thanks. read article, Steffen Bockhahn man quoted saying Germany laughing stock. rest article details drop support among citizens towards governments approach vaccinations compared better work handling pandemic earlier last year.

Some shortcomings highlighted article include:

* Slow pace vaccinations
* Poor organisation vaccine rollout, despite
* Government infighting mixed responses new case surges
* Stop start U-turns lockdown/mask/testing policies confusing public
* Shutdown fatigue coming cases rise
* Red tape slowing vaccine processes further
* Targets promises set broken supply forecasts continue stagger

The article sets contrast earlier successes praise Germany's pandemic handling, well traditional reputation Germany image efficiency. god, awful human being. I'm glad states strict laws people like you, thief.  remember hearing Pfizer vaccine supposedly effective variants... atleast that's research suggested. blows mind side effects hormonal BC constantly swept rug. I’m happy copper, even it’s bloody, wish options (at least US). expect they'd fast lol article says, ring vaccination smartest way get things done effectively, especially among young social people lot contacts.

This fair read people understand impatience restrictions—I’m fed tired, too—but restlessness risks creating one last set victims could easily spared. condemn anyone last person die unnecessarily war win, shortly.  vaccinated clearly more, safely, especially two weeks final dose. it’s particularly perilous time unvaccinated, deserve attention, resources, continued mitigation measures appropriate. 

Great article! think Bayern-comparism works here, Football competetive discipline, pandemic politics not. football clear ranking end season expecting always top entitled.

However, handeling pandemic, need countries, suboptimal. set rules differeng state state, certain politicians go back find loopholes national agreements digitalization 1990ies level, although entire summer figure frustrating mistakes, entirely unneccesary. 

I'm mad, Israel, UK US better us vaccination campeign Australia New Zealand better us pretty much anything. I'm mad hypothetical version Germany could much better us, avoidable errors made. India manufacture lot, make lot medicines drugs. Especially point people vaccinated majority deaths this.

People 16-35 need vaccine now, tell middle age stay home weeks shelter, vaccination young would actually stop infections create kind death truly vulnerable die vaccinated. that’s ridiculously good news. WHO's investigation good data access provided. hate constant moaning fax machines still use German healthcare, like significantly different elsewhere.

For instance, NHS planning phase March 2020: US, probably still used: BioNTech developed vaccine, Pfizer handles logistics manufacturing. Natural COVID-19 still far likely kill vaccine. also antigens vaccine may cause unusual vaccine side effects well. think put vaccines nastier childhood diseases first. Covid-19 vaccine exciting probably first time able interrupt pandemic become really widespread means letting disease rip population. Smallpox holds standard vaccine eliminate illness entirely (hopefully soon followed polio).

Also arguably soap germ theory disease lives-saved department. Look many people vaccinated, wearing masks, staying in, yet cases still increasing! Meanwhile flu practically extinct. disease insanely catchable. find posts summer everyone sub celebrating EU 56 year old mother ITP antiphospholid syndrome doctor professional wants tell whether get Astrazeneca shot.
Her doctor advised so(and preferred Astrazeneca doctor said better people autoimmune) think tye doctor government hospital saying government saying. pfizer shot also approved country hard get.
We got platelets checked platelets currently higher 'normal' range. 58 normally around 30.
What guys say. (Saudi Arabia live yet banned Astrazeneca something)
Thanks every kind infection memorized well. Chicken pox remembered well, probably mutates slowly relative others. headline encapsulates everything wrong current American media.   added joy random adults smugly congratulating done it. sort afraid ask reddit awhile, honest question emplore people answer seriously avoid instinct downvote insult me:

It appears that, large percentage population would consider ""young healthy"" (ie. 40 serious health issues), side effects vaccine appear worse disease itself. time, course, often not.

This largely anecdotal I'll admit: hear lot people, including thread, saying vaccine knocked ass days, gave nasty fever, call sick work. Compare people age got it, compared symptoms disease mild cold (some sinus congestion, mild cough, messed sense taste smell 1-2 weeks).

Am base here? seems odd people terrified virus year willingly gleefully getting shot makes sicker virus itself, point (potentially) getting sick virus. 8 hospitalized 2 dead. 

So much 100% prevents death. 2.67m doses. Wednesday record. 50% 65+ fully Yeah can’t believe people wanna see friends vaccinated. dare 

A source arguing counter. Still much uncertainty  live Mont co list penn medicine extra doses given out. ended getting mine Delaware since DE license gf dad got call since list well. “More”? many “more”? I'm group! found Rite Aid hour 10 minutes away me, middle absolute nowhere plenty appointments available. got first shot yesterday helped 6 people get appointments too. add question:

How quickly virus mutate unchecked kids? Could virus eventually mutate affect negatively? allow happen take steps prevent it? that's still 90% effective means.

if group 1000 vaccinated 1000 unvaccinated peopel exposure 400 unvaccinated people get sick 40 vaccinated get sick, gotten hell lot closer 90% effectiveness.

it's common mistake, one people need recognize since simply exposing 1000 unvaccinated people barely result 100 sick people much time agree CDC guidelines follow. I'm partially vaccinated continue wear masks.  


But think entire point made bit woosh you. CDC facts/statistics, sure, also essentially running PR campaign. seem sensible enough follow guidance, good us...but want everyone safe. Even stubborn people acting like jackasses hard reach. 


How CDC best give actual advice help them? 100% think overstating case hopes people half asked seriously backfiring (Obviously I'm hyperbolic now, essence that's kinda doing). Public health officials done should, clear poor grasp human psychology times. think article OP posted kind overly emotional appeals worst case scenarios based disregarding good news right now, turn much public want win fight right now.  


But sure make sanctimonious pricks feel good themselves... People need get ask message best unite people help understand need do. Overly emotional borderline misguided fearmongering \*NOT\* way would argue...but also agree disagree. explicitly, rolling sleeve, getting coronavirus vaccine *waiting needed time settle system*, 102 people Washington tested positive coronavirus since February. ""I really excited see data. seems like number breakthrough cases *after people fully vaccinated* actually even way lower 5% would expect,"" said. ""It seems like they’re working."" 90% cases Paris region UK virus.

Your sad comment example inhumanity among Brexit folk. happen one vaccine fully approved? Could effect allowing effective mandates you’d obviously need exempt gotten another vaccine Folks going drive vaccine. Barks County Lebanon County plenty capacity. ""My sister's mother law died heart attack labeled COVID death"" awhile now. times emergency, SCOTUS tends differ emergency powers executive branch. WW2, FDR executive order 9066 allowed interment Japanese Americans West Coast fear Japanese spies amongst population. SCOTUS time (who friendly FDR, struck several parts New Deal legislation earlier) upheld Korematsu, Japanese American citizen would go internment camp, therefore upholding executive order.

The police powers state (aka government) drastically increase due necessity promoting public good. something uncommon throughout U.S. history. really recently hyper partisan politics created anti-government sentiment. many deaths per million? 1.6% infection rate know of.

How teens/kids get tested? 

Here's conundrum . . . kids/teens get infected show symptoms . . . would get tested? find data point trial study? find it. Except even people mild asymptomatic cases developing neurological issues even kids mild cases developed heart damage. 

Plus kids spread virus members community. shed lot light works. That’s awesome! Thank kind person, feel like would benefit kind context elevated. don’t blame people mistrusting institutions, don’t favors shying away institutions work. saying FDA blame here, messaging place. When, reality, situation optimistic! Colorado, it’s refreshing hear state gov transparent realistic guidelines, role out, communications. one said goal ""letting constant number people keep getting sick long hospitals swamped"" 

that works fine, constant goes (aka curve goes up) curve would need flattened wise saying long flatten curve given point, never anything again. Health care workers vulnerable people vaccinated, includes lots 50s. family 2 3 us 50 vaccinated. want EITHER things. we've offered vaccine, think time get 2019 rights lives back. really ""SELFISH"" want share facial expressions humans? Good what? Would add used mrna tech/research developed US university US government funding. Posts continue situation improves Biotechs vaccine, Pfizer allowed produce, thank much. correct ruling. WI state law limits emergency orders 60 days. legislature target blame heat breaking always. mother works nursing home I'll never strong. Even without covid sad stories think happened under-estimation infectious covid is. Therefore, flattening curve would undone exponential growth cases soon things reopened, putting medical system strain again. Therefore flatten curve strategy give way longer strategy.

I wouldn’t say it’s goal-post moving, it’s science. takes time get data draw conclusions, sometimes change. God forbid medical professional spent past year watching patients die droves moment levity. Good thing death_rages mansplain properly spend time. Interesting. Doctor said we're fine thing recommend rapid test yet, especially he's KO'd bed, fever, taste etc.

I never see symptoms pop up. He's also around anyone besides mom I. Mom vaccinated out, I've COVID already fairly recently. feel way. know concerns kinda selfish people dying hospitals alone, idea masks becoming permanent fixture everyday life doesn’t sound appealing me. 

I would much prefer wear masks vaccine passport though. view lesser two evils. somewhat protected COVID 12 days getting first shot? studies severity shots? someone catches COVID first second shots, first reduce risk severity? Obviously meant ""out 1000 \***vaccinated**\* people exposed..."" talking minuscule amount, compared diagnosed old exist globally. mention “effective” also used differently people interpret. 

None testing positive great. didn’t controls based many *exposed*. it’s like adult trials, IIRC tested someone showed self-reported symptoms efficacy based many people developed either multiple moderate symptoms hospitalized. 

COVID still causes neurological issues, heart damage, &amp; blood clots people mild/asymptomatic cases. great news reducing spread, wouldn’t rely vaccine alone keep family members safe. Except need extreme refrigeration variable means go wrong transport handling . . . Thanks 1.6% got Covid placebo, compared 0% vaccine. really material? know schools require masks, probably no.

After getting vaccine, probably go engage bunch risky activities purpose.

Also, remember, ""during study."" sure long watched for, maybe couple weeks something. 1.6% infection rate may every two weeks whatever, cumulative chance get year would much higher. Turns airplane safe place be. figured long time ago filter air one person flu take entire flight 200 people getting plane, dozen COVID

If 5% people population COVID extremely bad situation already. forgetting Korematsu vs. US something.

I know is, yes... are. least us are. Maybe go work COVID wards then, since clearly think much better. viruses mutate?

I feel like stupid ass opinions like allowed people *not* take precautions . . . virus mutating quickly.

Do, *want* deadly kids take seriously???

You remind dumb fucking college kids knew. driving home, **drunk** bar small town (no stoplights . . . stop signs).

They realized **too drunk** really see car coming intersection cross traffic stop, big solution, *to keep safe*, **count ten** stop sign, go.

You see like one ""count ten"" types. Pfizer could going online 12-15 within weeks though could help lot I'm fully vaccinated community vaccination rates reach 60-70% range, continuing mask distance public bc that's supposed do. changes far I'm spending time inside fully vaxxed people I'm less anxious grocery store. I'm montco parents (who eligible motivated get it) struggled find appointments. ended driving hour half area supply/less demand -- able get appointment next day. car willing drive, would recommend this! mistake opting EU procurement program competence area. better strategy would coordinate member states' governments bring best country's talents together. least assemble task force advise supervise EU's efforts.

Hindsight 20/20 though. I’ve asked multiple people need vaccine already Covid answer get “well everyone vaccinated”. saying it’s wrong get vaccine don’t really understand logic there. don’t support court done, 

Obvious reminder court deal law law. tons case someone morally right legally wrong.

The 30 Days delay, ridiculously law penalty fail obey court order sounds like kind *well technically breaking law morally right* Yeah people don’t realize 40 age block makes 1% deaths aren’t really serious danger unless underlying conditions last checked us 16 days surplus supply, small decrease matter since can't/aren't getting enough shots arms check numbers yourself

hospitalizations deaths continue decline vaccinate 2.5 million people per day Flordia Texas undercount deaths. ‘Its bad flu’ said far many people March never even realised bad flu first place. Fiv It’s definitely possible would get test 2-3 days symptoms started sure isolate possible meantime. source? tiny bit going thru sub difficult see u said infected u develop T-cell protection shows resistance known variants. Vaccination known produce substantially antibodies getting infected, logical assumption would T-cell count also similarly higher 

Also, look Israel, 50%+ population fully vaccinated UK variant widely circulating variant prior that. numbers went substantially even UK variant number vaccinations increased. 

All evidences pointing vaccines effective known variants, great news Watching sub attempt explain MI worse FL TX actually pretty entertaining. They’ll literally float idea isn’t “perhaps lockdowns masks effective previously thought.” somewhat unrelated question I’ve trying find answer young teens good spreaders.

Numbers show kids around 10 years age virtually never get sick spread COVID-19. Young teens also rarely get sick, they’re highly effective spreaders.

Is different behavioral patterns teens, physiological reasons? infected teen shed virus small child, behavior lead increased chances transmission? sure young teens need it. like people conveniently forget SCOTUS historically differed executive branch often. forgetting Korematsu vs. US something. It’s opposite side state. Clinics going hundreds appointments unfilled basically begging people say they’re 1A, bothering saying “we doses today, anyone come get don’t go waste.” hundreds people aren’t 1A want shot come show up.  Welkom het Royaume de Belgique, un überraschend Land Article says patient elderly. I'm always baffled negative feeling towards that. They're saving peoples asses, can't take break? Well yes, since there's reason believe Washington substantively different populations used real-world Pfizer/Moderna study, issue returns headline emphasizes raw number infections minimizing facts infections mild/asymptomatic found less .001% vaccinated population. Question got/are knowledgeable Moderna vaccine:

My dad got second dose sunday. Yesterday today he's cough, stuffy nose, scratchy throat, congestion that's making breathe heavy. O2 fine 98 doc said second Moderna vaccine sometimes cause kinds symptoms even though read fever, aches, chills etc.

This article says cases occurred among 1.2 million vaccinated since Feb. 1., 83 cases per million

From Feb 1. Mar. 27, WA state recorded [47,059 new population 7.8 million. Subtracting group subset 100 cases 1.2 million vaccinated, end 7,115 cases per million time.

So 7,115/MM vs. 83/MM effectiveness rate 98.8%.

Somebody want double check math? laboratory data supported lot work viruses systems show similar phenomenon, single viral infection cause transient protection subsequent viral infection. difficulty studying observationally likely fairly rare event. would need one virus (already semi rare event even Covid rhinovirus think fixed point time) short day period afterwards exposed second virus, equally rare event. observation side would need know person exposed second virus (if results true) actually getting sick.

There's also instances second viral infection worse due first likely timing part immune response active.

So either way, interesting data probably impact many people hard study humans  today? It’s pretty much even people died vaccine, healthy people age died covid country.

Fat people upset said fat bad thing. wish anything rational that, that's really is. Nothing said wrong, happy said it. study vaccine development, procurement definitely national distribution (4.9B alone figures). fuels intersection ""vaccines work"" ""can't math"" crowds give one everything send jolly way. It’s happening internationally, sure.  can’t confirm authors credibility, translated article says title implies. individual tested negative rapid test, later positive high viral load lab test. actually quite possible. vaccine doesn’t provide immunity, prevent spread. lessens symptoms. means people easily asymptomatic spread everyone else. 

I course can’t verify article correct happened. saying, it’s possible.  Shouldn’t exported half EU produced doses Sure! Fatality % case obviously go elderly, people health problems vaccinated. hypothetical, 50,000 cases vs 50,000 cases last September means different things, least view. (Yes there’s tiny fraction hospitalizations compilations, fraction going down)

Second, restrictions(at least negative effects) free lunch. People need money live, many restrictions detrimental that. There’s also mental health angle. it’s simple(in opinion anyway) cases go up? clamp harder. Cases go down, release grip throat. adds time it’s year basically.

Exactly this. can’t trust population whole act good faith, significant part population isn’t willing part keep people safe. treat everyone it’s safe enough to. adds 10% chance? What's point discussion thread want one side discussion? Look many replies question generated, compared every ""i got vaccinated"" post.

If going try convince vaccine hesitant people like myself, need listen hear perspective, shut conversation. think dawn already counting authorities tell ""safe"", going holding very, long time... in, never happened before.

Yeah sounds awful. You’d much better New York everyone masked cases shooting Low demand states absolutely give excess doses high demand states. It’s reliable. However, know yet: person get second dose vaccine? vaccine it? 

What know tested negative (with rapid test) PCR test showed HIGH virus load. According persons involved infected many people. 

But don’t many details yet, however lot news Germany report it. it’s legit.

Huh. business critical ""rescuing economy"" can't handled virtually, 2021?

I disagree restrictions need lifted couching international business travel weird Faith enumerated specifically protected class. getting vaccine not. also difference US government restricting access medicaid vs privately owned bar restricting access produce proof vaccination. They're risk getting sick covid since vaccines prevent transmission there's reason take one reply absolutely content.

It basically ""sOMeThING plain stupid"".

Dude, gotta learn debate small chance dead blood clot

It's 10x normal rate. high enough you? Would like wait 100x 1000x fair chance dead covid high chance spreading disease

For adult survives one full year without covid, risk fairly low survive months either another vaccine waiting data AZ.

But you, provaxxer, go get AZ. world needs data points AZ anyway.

It's win win. get prove AZ safe. get know sure AZ safe.

Let's unite pro-vaxxers go get AZ! Go go go! Hospitalizations fatalities increasing lot slowly cases, probably lot vulnerable people vaccinated. However trend since beginning. cases spiked 4x late last year, fatalities less doubled.

As vulnerable vaccinated young healthy go public cases, cases without illnesses cause concern. risk always highly concentrated relatively small part population. True - definitely schools last close / first open, unfortunately, though maybe indirectly (because makes parents work home) schools seem important driver infections.

News - Macron closed schools (for 3 weeks). Using medical resources consequence everyone. Sad realize this.

But again, also seem understand getting vaccinated choice easily fixed. Obesity choice easily fixed. guess surprised. fun continuing white knight bio terrorists. soon (if did) feel anything second shot Pfizer? I'm 6 hours 2nd shot really feel anything yet, even sore injection site. know different people, curious.  clue I’m willing bet 102 caught covid It’s ideal it’s fine. 

For every new covid case day, 25-30x many people getting first shot. Given math, way goes horribly wrong everyone gathers together one giant unventilated room takes turns coughing everyone else’s face. mentioned vaccine was, probably Astrazeneca. EU media miss opportunity give another kicking.

The vaccines never 100% effective anyway, news. pass virus someone less fortunate. rewrite guidelines say vaccinated people around unvaccinated people even without masks distancing,” said Ghandi. “Not public don’t know vaccinated not, **still going maintain masks distancing everyone wants get vaccine get it.**

Emphasis mine. 

That last paragraph frustrating people read this, think don’t use mask, still start trouble asked mask up. 

I think last line huge: come early Summer, enough vaccines (most importantly) *time vaccinate want it*, drop mandates. choose get vaccine “this flu,” that’s you. (Obviously speaking allergies vaccines.) want still run around carrying thing loved ones, I’ll let deal Damn comment tickled Miscarriages stillbirths noted infected COVID. got sick first second shot, second, would explain it. link already observed infected vaccine? mean make look way? Easy enough answer, 30 percent population vaccinated. 

It might enough prevent spike cases majority vaccinations older people vulnerable seems hospitalizations deaths getting back pre-vaccine levels would nearly impossible big lie. COVID vaccine PREVENT getting virus lessens severity illness. virus never going away, thank China ! vaccines experimental emergency use authorizations. whole thing highly irregular \*so far\* looks pretty ok. £600 million global efforts find vaccine.

Presumably that's bit translates $0.5B. Depending exchange rates ""up to"" means, right ballpark. would probably die covid, dying vaccine.

Makes wonder there's connection vaccine dying Covid. potential issues absolutely miniscule amount people

If call ""we can't give anyone 60"" ""minuscule amount"" suppose so. said ""open"" seventy eighty percent. talk eliminating masks social distancing. exact article quoting says people still mask socially distance getting vaccinated, comment seventy eighty bit.

If find talking number he'd advocate lifting mask requirements, I'll happy hear it. article accusing reading. change anything. enough vaccine everyone want anyway. would quote accurately wouldn’t issue. many people read headline mean everywhere sub. what’s get older 👁👄👁😳😳😳😳 Private businesses restrict business public health concerns. really different shoes, shirt, service.

I would 1000000x likely go bar requiring vaccination cards one doesn't. I'm sure difference 18 population 2000-ish participants would called 100% tbh Imagine smug taking vaccine virus 99.97% recovering rate. Also US conservative population lowest level inbred globe. arab african migrants leftist demand western countries import millions average 40 70% inbred.  feel like CDC national leaders speaking sides mouth this. Dr. Fauci wearing 2 masks CDC says fully vaccinated people don’t carry virus.

Biden too

 scientist, follow news I’m complete loss world message here. imagine confusion people don’t follow news much feel.

Always been. messaging mess since importantly, policy makers CDC state local governments going listen new CDC study similar ones?

Never. Restrictions go whimper due fatigue rather anyone vested (read: $$$) interest ever admitting wrong anything Approximately 25,000 total reported cases Covid Washington since February 1. 102 vaccinated people. Quick math let’s conservatively assume rolling average 600,000 fully vaccinated people time period. 600K since Feb. 1 .017% chance catching covid. 7 million residents .35% chance catching covid. Aka - 20 times likely get covid vaccinated people. vaccinated folks likely less symptoms. Everything else equal whole state vaccinated would 1,292 cases time frame... instead 25,000. Lol you’re soft hell  unable read link language (English). unable find corroborating article language. anyone confirm contents article reliability author translation headline? Bayesian inference? many million vaccinated came contact covid? Yeah. Like less people dying.  Facts exists even dont believe so. No. doses plant Netherlands works fine. tell we're still track majority American adults vaccinated April even without boost would given us, 4% country still pretty awful. Thank God manufacturers still accelerating. want like Israel.  

Agreed, probably reason. chance dying blood clot take vaccine : less 1 / 500 000 (0.00018%).

chance dying get corona (which happen nobody gets vaccine like you) : 1 / 500 (0.2% age &lt; 40) rougly 1/6 (14.8% age 80)

feeling lucky ? Crying vaccinated American, misses DimSum-binges Markham. Ah, seller advertising product. Surprised say cures diseases side effect, lol. Would cool true, know there's two 100% sure things world vaccine ain't one them. article says Emergent shipping vaccine Catalant.

Fearmongering intentionally misleading titles best vehicle ensure revenue.

Just look stories recently real-world vaccine efficacy. headline reads 80 something 100,000 fully vaccinated people hospitalized such. bury lede math, like order magnitude better expected. Haha barely post anymore would fit yeah that's works - going get shots evangelicals' arms unless make think they're losing doses liberals. point, I'm willing us try anything get numbers across board.

Good point, know necessarily translates ""we locked harder."" along invasive privacy policies inherently odds American culture. 

There's excuse testing disaster, though. still shitshow MONTHS started. would undoubtedly helped control little better. Make ordeal--no appointments, insurance, etc. understand capacity limited, really thrown resources like we're vaccines.

Unfortunately, anti-vax people get this. Tennessee's handling pandemic shitshow. using us example everyone else follow

Maybe statewide, specific regions. I'll even give Knox County could done getter Mayor Kane going full crazy. 

But I'd argue local county handled fine, time things got dicey January, dicey almost everywhere.

Which reaffirms maybe local handling situation based local needs stats better statewide policy.

I'll agree statement Lee useless.. since local health department handled things reasonably well, turned fine here. Which.. reaffirms general point above. Two separate entities, impact supply distributed week (20M) reported. 15 million doses trashed due “human error” Baltimore production facility, looks like FDA shutting plant investigate. ""Multiple"". Yea sure Jesus christ shitshow, pray try fill gap fuck EU vaccines. keeping people dying painfully without family hold hand

also greatly reducing less severe disease

sorry less death good enough Catalent plant fill finish. Emergent plant actual vaccine. exactly

*Federal officials still expect enough doses meet President Biden’s commitment provide enough vaccine end May immunize every adult. two federally authorized manufacturers, Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna, continuing deliver expected.* fully understand risks getting coronavirus separate doses. J&amp;J doses currently distributed distributed manufactured Netherlands. plant Baltimore supposed start delivering doses soon.  lot stuff read variants seems intentionally crafted terrify scientifically illiterate. Almost every single article referencing variants I've seen treats assumption they're lethal, deadly, likely completely resist vaccine infection induced immunity.

The reality really that. Dealing variants natural part dealing viruses, decent unique phenomenon. recent study came Israel demonstrated near certainty presently variants existence resist vaccines. I've yet see conclusive proof natural viral mutations could lead variant evades vaccines. impossible, I'm even convinced likely. NY Times article right they're amazing seasonal allergies Oh yeah, point cool haha, plugging church here

Unfortunately there's minority Catholics who've swallowed Evangelical Trumpian gibberish hook line sinker, also unfortunately technically member one parishes attending one acts like pandemic actually real lmao okay need get grip people lol. eating donuts bod :p. serves well 😈 far know, antibodies seem diminish time. 6 months severely declined. know much Covid tho, novel virus. new virus, previous ""cousins"" cause havoc, one specifically know little about.

Link uncertainty claim: don’t even know damage covid kids lungs. Like whether that’s reversible. long run, maybe stop supporting extremist political candidates end spawning copycats. happens. J J issue?? TLDR: immune system prepares ""variant"" viruses making ""variant"" immunity.  “Memory B cells immune system’s attempt make variants countermeasure potential viral variants future,” ... “Your immune system creating library memory B cells aren’t potentially recognize things aren’t identical,” Also lowers risk people go get vaccinated. Probably delays things week two, unless scale production. Annoying, grand scheme things blimp radar. disagree all. serious consequences COVID infections, firmly believe long COVID real serious.

That said, rates low young people, overall risk serious injury far used *except* prevalence high. things going appear common disease a) novel, b) extremely common.

Long COVID occurs somewhere 2-7% people catch disease, depending study cite. I'm sure numbers updated future. means \~1 20 people experiencing things like this. That's relatively normal severe viral infection. get viral pneumonia, one, experiencing effects months. could anything flu common cold virus something specific, lower respiratory infection take potentially leave lasting side effects. post-viral fatigue, probably closer people experience ""long COVID."" That's also relatively common. Think getting 20 severe flu infections. One times probably wind fatigue brain fog months after, people get 20 severe flu infections, assessing individual risk becomes hard conceptualize. ""want locked forever""

We’ve seen uptick cases I’d like rationalize variants data alarming. Let’s stay vigilant get thru thing. Brits stole dose UE country, fact, truly despicable country weren’t mentally capable adjusting expectations events unfolded became clear wouldn’t fast?

Officially programme finish 2005. thing think reached secondary school 2005? feel “jab” way intuitive fortnight. 

Is like week, day, knows without google. thing trump right trash Scientist I'm talking exports all, noone talking exports. conversation chain Novavax applying vaccines approved country


Nice additional qualifier put keep strawman. shame understand conversation is. Nothing like watching girls blackout drunk heels, helmet, 80 mph baseballs wizzing by. know tell then. government programme continued 2005. Maybe parents exempted missed cut Ask people explain mechanism long term side effect would develop. vaccinated (for non-medical reasons), must pay pocket COVID related medical expenses. bad enough pull back vaccine live east Michigan drive 40 mins south get , reason it’s tuff get east Michigan Kind wish air travel going back much, climate change perspective. favor rest, though. What'd think is, court law?

Away shite dumbo. Mate, voluntary decision. simply enough supply. highly highly doubt it. anything, there’d booster. J&amp;J 100% effective preventing severe covid death/hospitalization; there’s need get mRNA it. water wet.  Except 100% women 49 caught Covid. death rate caught Covid much higher 0.6 per 100,000. Bruh what? Living closed quarters someone highly contagious virus contracting said virus like speeding getting crash lol used live Wolfram. Really miss neighborhood. german governent corruption case isnt helping either used cleaning parking? mean ""floating business""? asking research US？ AZ mostly given older people 180k AZ people, well possible happen UK yet say like idea punishing people bad behavior regard society? making numbers here, flu killed million people 100 years, continued on, rona killed 1 million people 1 year, never seen again. matter? million people million people. gunman shot killed 100 people one day, would less tragic killed 100 people one day 100 days? 100 people dead.Lives lost lives lost comparing two, flu much deadly, actual numbers % death rate. problem publicly making people jealous want too. sounds like Russian bot trying convince americans get vaccine. listen Russians bois!!! Get vaccinated let's end thing! way vaccinate 5.6b people per year forever.

At least attitude...

""Moderna already said believe it’s going endemic."" 
Maybe, maybe going endemic PEOPLE VACCINATE? strict lockdown Washington? ~10 million immunosuppressed people US vaccine might partially completely ineffective. might people know love. Agreed.Many officials seem allergic discussing endgame. surprise level:

 ⬆ Prove scientific evidence. Wait can’t. It’s barely year. already long haulers. Can't virus lay dormant body emerge decades later i.e. chicken pox shingles? worry kids? Toys R Us went bankrupt! Yeah say crying happens pandemic pandemic lmao. wild ride year been. Luckily baby born right start pandemic, never felt need heavily socialize early global pandemic going knowing would affect her.

 grandmother kept 5 children close home three, kindest, loving members family. feel parents slightly older children. hard. got first dose Pfizer, nothing mildly irritating arm soreness. However I’ve heard people Moderna tends worse symptoms Pfizer. anyone confirm Moderna tends cause symptom issues? many kids get long term effects. flu bigger threat kids

COVID killed 331 kids far US Compare record-high 188 pediatric flu deaths US 2019-2020 season *with* lockdowns restrictions.

While COVID relatively low threat kids, still bigger threat flu. People love say “kids resilient” yet trace majority issues adults things happened us childhood. Children’s pain easier ignore. We’re gonna look generation fucked-up kids school social interaction keep listening bullshit “advice.” Someone tell Fauci step back let people handle lives. 70% antibodies: vaccinated + recovered.

In Israel estimated 25%+ covid-19 (confirmed cases 9%).

Of course overlap (people disease later vaccinated). son turning 2 soon. magically going start wearing mask age don’t think “good” mask wearer while. trying time sure eventually get it. get shot ends. One happen Scientifically sound, probably bridge far. downvoted? absolutely right. Everyone thread hearing want hear. say together, wear masks do. die covid-19. genuinely likely die car accident. sounding like dad Finding Nemo. never take kid outside again, nothing bad ever happen them, nothing ever happen either. Good luck that. December 2020 2 million kids contracted 200 died. long term effects children got 200 dead. it’s four months later. number likely much higher. recall posts subreddit widespread phenomenon US, examples states' data, like one provided

I tried googling failed. anyone dig threads out?  That’s dumbest title ever. recognized variants concern half dozen mutations already. Don’t tell people live. Sheesh would say 30-40% people know (and live ca) don’t want get vaccine. long live CA. foreseeable future, Disneyland seems restricting ticket sales CA residences only. Alright, listen. husband physician treats covid patients. pulled kids school last March spent following 12+ months hunkered without social interaction, breaks parenting, time away home. taken thing *incredibly* seriously watching others blow live lives perfectly fine. cannot anymore! I’m vaccinated, husband vaccinated, cases dropping like flies county. found hasn’t single outbreak kids’ school could think could gone along outcome would except would happier sane.

I took kids private park day ran acquaintances friends. kids knew kids (age 4, 2) wanted play IDEA interact kids. oldest approached playground said “mommy, first tell germs?” heart broke. 2yo bad separation anxiety I’m sure he’s truly never away me. cannot go another 1-2 years youngest age groups vaccinated. can’t. can’t. get Fauci saying case numbers drop positivity rates, I’m coming hibernation feel comfortable sending kids back world well. Yeah “kids fine” 15 years we’ll new crop school shooters. turns actually weren’t fine. Give Pikachu give death center work requires kids 3+ masks.  550,000 deaths country say *too* careful. Okay, buddy  guys vaccinated let kid play kids mask required. Kids don’t need worry Covid since can’t pass guys return normal. Enough enough. Live life fear THIS! Florida's covid death count comparable excess deaths, calculated CDC. study wildly line CDCs excess death numbers, CDC forever. They’re led lying POS, course undercounted COVID deaths Hold up. saying three year old individual person thoughts, ideas, impulses, free will? GTFO nonsense! 

My daughter 13 shitshow started. easy her, cannot (or want to) imagine navigating last year pre-schooler. Stay strong staple mask little guy's head. show him. many died? Other, better vaccines like Novavax’s Imperial College’s needed future antibodies current vaccines fade new variants become prominent. 

AZ’s vaccine particular effective variants Time new boss, option. not, condolences :/

Having anti-vax boss probably means exactly ""lets put opinion aside use data make decisions"" type. viral load much lower vaccinated people get infected, ability spread dramatically curtailed. We’ve pretty much “known” going case months now, it’s borne research places like Israel have. FDA explain people came living families yet one else family would test positive? NJ it’s common occurrence. people thought cold first didn’t quarantine immediately either initial contagious period. care kids 2019? still existed too. show children literally died. Cut out. many kids died covid Nice bait Well fuck got one Saturday (and I’m young woman) Yes, that’s it. kids quoting part you’ve fully gather indoors fully vaccinated people without wearing gather indoors unvaccinated people one household (for example, visiting relatives live together) without masks, unless people anyone live increased risk severe illness you’ve around someone COVID-19, need stay away others get symptoms.

Since guidance released evidence suggests even guidance overly Wear god damn mask.

I -- _until I'm fully vaccinated_ -- then, like said, I'm going stop unless required given situation. Otherwise going trash. Yeah seems like lot people thread missing point reason. He's definitely saying kids can't play together, wear masks do. He’s saying kids live state fear two years, everyone else vaccinated assure we're happy ""lose"" business type conspiracy theorists issues vaccine passport. Frankly, I've probably already kicked banned property wearing mask arguing politely asked put one on. responsibility protect employees rational customers dangerous people like that. Good riddance bad rubbish.

Oh yeah, please feel free leave negative review stating kicked property vaccination passport. got bad reviews kicking people property wearing mask caused massive surge business. Distancing unnatural state. Three year olds assholes, get it. best that's matters. 

All kids different. understand people freak ridiculous things. Private corporations what? Refused order given chance? Say doses available none? government things... Nah, 65 12 millions left so. refuse it, probably less. ""Governor Cuomo forced Florida lie covid numbers"" it’s kids work, it’s playing works, defeats whole purpose socializing cover everyone’s face   kids wear masks fine people masks don’t behave like before. don’t first one. enough people coming in. They'll accept anyone vaccine right now.  There’s also little question among foolish supporters previous president election. Doesn’t mean it’s true. you’re conspiracy theorist nothing change mind.  philosophy, many ways life viewpoints immoral people. Translation: I'm thick understand science kids pass virus not? 100%, are.  even understand basic concept selective pressure? understand vaccine full length spike? abs concentrated basically two regions (NTD RBD) rather full length? greatly increases selective pressure two regions. seeing exponential growth cases MI right now. perfect storm scenario selective pressure vaccine strain leading escape. Hep B vaccine scenario again.  hydroxychloroquine actually seen effective covid?

[If effective Trump receive Last part sounds... Familiar...

Another 2008 anybody? reasonable thing do. thing people wearing masks PPE, great vaccines effective we'll see things work places stop wearing mask 65-75% vaccinated population. idea situation like, seems USA heading direction kids unable get anti-vaxxers  still tens millions 65s aren’t vaccinated yet. still tens millions people comorbidities aren’t vaccinated yet. simply aren’t yet. mean came privately owned companies happen based EU countries? heavily funded UK gov early research supply lines?. We're seeing evidence humidity plays factor helps ton. probably helped Florida vs California lot desert pretty dry especially hard hit areas like mistake shooting 100M people total, massive sandbag job

The 100M doses goal declared early December. even think 1M total given time goal declared. Given poorly things going Biden declared 100M doses 100 days, *was* aggressive. got shot new paltz today ran like well oiled machine. Actually almost states ""undercounted"" deaths. U.S. averaging excess mortality 20% covid deaths. There’s probably several million people involved everybody trying boil one guy another guy president. Nuance dead. wonder society heading downhill. love people starting see bullshit. started panicked, telling everyone wasn’t taking seriously idiots. time begun see reality situation. Covid sucks, let’s move lives accept risks. kids play whoever fuck want wearing mask. Hope take Newsom.  virus isn’t going magically disappear think it’s long, though. absolutely cases among kids without masks school. Even don’t think that’s risk kids, mean quarantines (under health rules states require), don’t think ping-ponging class constant quarantine helpful students’ learning way. ideal world, sure, virus would disappear one would mask. don’t live world. pick two less perfect choices. think wearing masks school impacted students (5th grade) much, plenty unmasked time family help well. It’s better option constantly quarantines. tool guy is. get upset ones want listen anyways. thread joke. I'm sure know why, crazy shit going on, brigading group full force today.   comment responded perfect example vaccine messaging poor. fact anyone would think someone vacced would 30% chance getting 1 unvacced person it.... people throw hands wonder get it. 

Hell, even unvacced people live house chances getting isn’t high! believe latest risks measured something like 17-20%? vacced person 30% chance now? Madness. It’s 8 months. Moderna started human trials last March. Well things changed quite significantly since March 2020 lol.

I edited comment include yes, expect variant emerge future greater degree immune resistance. vaccines still retain decent efficacy major circulating variants right now, already booster shots development testing don’t need undergo phase 3 testing. said, compare iirc *10 years* develop effective antiviral HIV. even vaccine, treatment puts darker spin term Hanging Chads. can’t go two years without social gatherings

Nobody competent suggesting that. Fauci, WHO, CDC pushing school reopenings months social development important. Wearing masks, like Fauci advocating article, seems like reasonable safety precaution now. think Fauci officially jumped shark. doesn’t take mask public til 2023. I’m sure Fox News reporting scandal /s fat arms, seriously arm pain 8out 10 high tolerance, person giving shot got needle stuck. Thanks replying. I’ve trying distract myself. I’ve odd headache since vaccine nothing abnormal. Several countries like Vietnam New Zealand essentially Covid-free 3 careful families know gotten come house kids. we’ve told weeks/months year clear end sight. Looking excess mortality numbers CDC (visualized summarized NYT article linked). 

California/Florida seem par other. 

California 69.8K excess deaths per population 39.5M (.17%)

Florida 35.9K excess deaths per population 21.5M (.17%)

Which absurd considering lax restrictions Florida. Florida even older population working it.

These excess deaths, can't obfuscate numbers. Yes need keep masking social distancing proportion people vaccinated sufficient allow restrictions relaxed. masks social distancing public probably required allow enforcable. private environments vaccination status everyone known restrictions relaxed IMO.

In sense, mask wearing social distancing public form virtue signalling encouraged two dose rate 60% something (which probably another month?) saying something mental stress corona examined too? know children suffer kept apart like this. normal Don’t forget Vietnam probably best world That’s true, fault still it’s sad, many ignorant need minds changed.

A lot actually surprise open are. Uhh, doesn’t actually anything China US wealthy countries. exist take money rich countries distribute poor countries. 

Which great. kicking China hurts perhaps nations China may distribute money straight places Africa, cutting entirely strengthening control region. guess likewise can't say outside England, published steering policy find anywhere jusr opposite actually.

I say though friends family ""England"" unaware steering, logistically see could methods using book vaccines. Oh well I'm sure point become clear. wonder isolated clots side effect vaccine many factors involved. Jesus that's like half Florida's population concern isn’t kids wearing masks, it’s someone position adopting essentially anti-science position. 

There zero science backup significant benefit suggesting. That’s concerning coming anyone lay person. 

It would like director NASA advised everyone wear hard hats foreseeable future never know could struck meteorite fragment. It’s technically wrong, it’s concerning someone position fundamentally misunderstand apply probability. long last? True. apparently 30 million vaccines delivered week, 11 million J&amp;J. used point. actually evidence support idea caused vaccine virus itself? thought people finding blood clots virus vaccine. Oops. You’re right. Def jumped conclusions  different reasons - last week mechanic drove car back shop putting new brakes in. raining hard couldn’t put windows air someone else driving it. wore mask way home. 

Similarly, weekly car wash attendant drives car gets vacuum, wear mask first minutes I’m driving home after, lower windows bit air since someone else there. 

Another time clipped mask straps hair bun tight fit doctors office, couldn’t bothered removing doctors office home put mask back take elevator floor. know look dumb driving though. many people possible get vaccinated, officials random people Twitter weird way saying it. Like government horrible showing actual benefits vaccine people. don’t care indirectly admit say press conference somewhere, wanna say vaccines reduce transmission high degree NEED say make sure people know, instead spouting nonsense staying vigilant vaccination things going horribly right now, aren’t. People aren’t going get vaccinated reason it’ll get us back normal don’t get see tangible effects unvaccinated people won’t. need make clear vaccines game changer “get say so” kind thing. wait week he'll says isolation detrimental. week he'll find something else us scared about. lawyer would jump stupid case. You’d loaded. wins internet tonight. Vaccine rollout great- vaccine provider (pharmacist) exhausted. 

I’m expected give vaccines open close every day next additional help addition normal work load. get yelled several times day due scheduling issues (we can’t schedule appointments directly, direct patients website automated phone service). come home work days cry. drink. 

Just saying- nice people scheduling providing vaccines. It’s rough .. I'm angry wish Trump fired chance Canadian envious. back lockdown BC vaccine rollout glacially slow. Americans, pleased actually competent national leadership now. No, warn impending doom. warned new rise cases admitted feeling impending doom. That's close thing. example:

A years ago particularly bad case flu. told wife, ""I'm feeling like death"" warned stay away also catch flu. warn impending death.

Whoever AJC needs go back high school English class. REALLY poor. hope see irony someone desperate social eager break social contract, someone eager pandemic anyone else. hard find, man.

Stop denying science like way makes feel. suspect know this, share sentiment, deal consequences whether want not. decisions effect others. getting around that. do, good bad, radiates rest world, people adjust plans it. sooner everyone accepts lives thought toward whether they're helping hurting, sooner might chance putting behind us. I'm fully aware EU is, thanks stating obvious. said, CDC/FDA done tests various brands KN95 masks authorized meet exceed 95% emergency use. Since appear believe me, here's link test results see facts. number tested, approved, KN95's meet exceed 95% proficiency. Yeah think secure huge supply vaccine. Beyond agree didn’t anything special. every state held falsely triumph economy cost high number cases 5% deaths California - locked down.

It’s bragging well they’ve done badly others done increased scrutiny  Worldometers showing 62k cases today. 60k last week. Waiting usual update hospitalizations etc. also 4 year old. also started going back playground. immediate family, including grandparents caregivers fully vaccinated. can’t hold back anymore. needs play children starting school fall. child sad worried socialization.

On upside, making friends playing games children time go playground. think she’s going okay. sure look breakdown essential workers come conclusion. kid old enough wear mask? Kids old enough wear masks still play mingle, wear masks so. Congrats! 2nd shot Moderna fucked pretty good. Chills, fever, joint aches, mild nausea, back pain vengeance. Probably worst night sleep ever.

Absolutely worth it. brazil variant it? test B.1.351?
Should T-cells catch one?
Vancouver, BC - P1 - March 12, 2021
'Samples first screened N501Y, detected, subsequent targets re-tested discriminate prevalent VOC within community (B.1.1.7-delHV69/70 B.1.351-K417N) newly emerging VOC Wrigleyville seedy back day. Oh well, times change Yeah, bueno undercooked chicken especially. 😂 

I actually position whether kids wear masks (my kids adults/young adults, 2/3 fully vaccinated third gets first shot 19th), pointing one two examples persuasive context personal risk. Somehow interpreted wanting kids wear masks til 2050 something lol. think outrageous. like zero contact. game online jump discord shoot shit whatever, severely immunocompromised people life would incredibly disrespectful well society whole get together one basements watch fights play boardgame watch football. None things valuable life. personally, girlfriend done holidays family since Christmas 2019 friendsmas friends early Jan 2020. Yep, see lot kids park right now. I’ve got five won’t let play others yet. time know it’s hard can’t speak people’s situations. way lucky kids other. four siblings play with. rented movie theater took wore masks well. think would quickly forget playing kids, though. Best try Friday arm stops hurting Monday? know someone 2 yr old currently trial clots uncommon background rate population 1 1000. Normally would go radar evidence far suggests causal link.

This actually AZ drama about, least variant seem pointing numbers. favour read actually looking into.

You seem fallen thing warn against. Certain media seemed downplay actual findings representing ""typical"" blood clot. never case, media respective countries issue found clear this.  know boss... mentioning generally anti-vaxers influences positively people know get vaccines turn issues. quickly forget threat variants present. yes amazing accomplishment history mankind get bronchitis much get cold painful annoying exist try breathe. never quite scared covid like don’t live life way, can’t imagine much would suck experience able breathe. I’m sorry loss. question isn’t whether something statistically safe kill child; pointed out, causes childhood death statistically safe. question much fundamentally change lives children’s lives mitigate outcome already extremely unlikely. 

Case point: two small children. pool yard. Statistically, pool safe. also, 950 children drown year. I’m going take reasonable safety precautions like locked gate swimming supervision, I’m going something drastic like sell house fill pool mitigate already small risk. 

It’s COVID, adults care vaccinated, parents going evaluate individual risk COVID poses child decide reasonable safety measures would take offset risk. Canada 500k initial doses AZ believe we've used now. cases CVST thus far.

Every province different policy use. reserving high-risk 65, others essential workers, prison populations, etc. there's mix match definitely sizable population younger individuals who've received AZ, idea actual numbers are. Gods HAHAHAHA Kids still mingle. outside require masks distancing. Revisionist history end... go back look subreddit news articles time. Anybody following production schedules contracts pfizer moderna would told same. glaringly obvious.

Biden (smartly) picked goal easily achievable. reason people think stating much attempt credit trump something, isn't. Biden promised delivered, good leadership. literally hiding data public intense wave. could anyone possibly surprised this? anyone know normal rate condition would age group? possible nothing vaccine? different subreddit might satire. Yeah whack refresh like game hungry hungry hippos get spot. going get big surge sure. vaccine doses, is. remember seeing article Moderna vaccine useless South Africa mutation? ignoring Operation Warp Speed. wouldn’t even vaccine without it. continues even further... 8 months ago masks don’t work, it’s wear 2 even vaccine, covid asymptotic. 
Btw CDC says asymptotic cannot spread virus. Unreal, also made plenty lab China years ago. Also video saying 2016-17 would global epidemic within year two. doesn’t add up, sorry. finance bros moved nearly every state? people acting like he’s telling something don’t already know. Come on, basic stuff given know virus transmission. Yes kid yes know it’s simply must done keep safe. I'm satisfied! Got second shot Pfitzer today. think time bid farewell sub. Stay safe all. Get jabs! vaccines dont stop spread, covid mutate someone vaccinated? doesn't, that's point. society accept certain levels risk rule breaking. 

Sidenote, also eat steak, chicken fish, usually cook medium rare lol. daughter turned 4. (Her birthday literally last thing last March lockdown). wears mask fine, last year. sort tricked first, though. First, helped dad make it. mask could get wear long time. Second, spent night calling doctor. Pulled toy doctor set. still call doctor seems unhappy wearing it. Identified mean merely mentioned contract, application clauses criteria may affect how, when, circumstances plants might actually used. 

The reason deliberately specify 'as per contract' want obviate part contract.  Fauci fuck off. appointments anywhere We’re going look back Fauci lockdowns way look Bush Jr “War Terror”: dramatic overreactions genuine issue, action fix said issues end much damaging original event ever could be. Also people get fomo say fuck Lmao 2yo also licks hers. She’s actually pretty good keeping that. Sometimes won’t let us take off. toddler. seeing that? It’s incorrect based every source I’ve seen, including official OHA Lol mask Fauci, two mask Fauci, go away now. Kids wearing masks wearing masks year now, completely depends neighborhood attitudes there, daycare/school standards. guy create headlines print. browns fans I'm desperate see like home playoff game.

Also shoutout /r/lakeeriebros Wank Howdy, must new around parts  Follow Twitter bots. able sign six people family relatively easily. Yes agree! Well... can't really surprised head pandemic response, renowned epidemiologist, would recommend anything besides wearing masks cautious.

It's like asking primary care doctor think okay smoke. doctor going say anything except, ""smoking healthy."" certainly understandable take lives one goddamn countries banned AZ anyways people 55. even read news? Yep, everything else said reasonable rational, one bit got headlines everyone basing reactions around sounded extreme it. sure chose word way, maybe came top head. can't count votes suprise all.  yeah rough year think kids bounce back new academic starts person teaching social interactions. pay things?

We since Clinton office, problem. issue debt owe mostly ourselves. bill already due tune somewhere around 10% federal outlays. 

We inflating way it, sounds cool theory ultimately paying it. following, asset prices real estate, vehicles, stocks roof despite nothing economy really changing. money go it? Still wrong actually FIND Australians properly WEAR face mask...

Not many found. work 3-day lockdown, staff inside wearing chin-hammocks ear-rings...

They also look partner funny walk office door, turn handle walk straight (without wearing mask) wonder door locked... completely anecdotal tangentially related months Covid longhauler symptoms. Talked women similar symptoms noticed got worse menstrual cycles. Decided go birth control see got better. Within days symptoms disappeared. get rough days month PMS. doctor also mentioned seeing young women long term symptoms population. really make wonder something that. described selfishness entitleness. Governor recalled ? ballot 1.5mn signatures hard core Trumpists (who got 6mn votes CA). ballot Trump judge gave recall organizers 6 month extension. going win another 30 pt thumping like Trump got thumping Biden. CA’s response incredible success. 100 deaths second densest city country, currently second lowest infection rates. could easily Dakotas Arizona Texas. kind thinking caused polio outbreaks 60s.  19 average yearly deaths 250,000+ counting.

That mistake, went along assuming meant 2020 deaths 2021 deaths. tl;dr:
The US invested $2.2 billion vaccine development. 
Germany, single country, invested $1.5 billion vaccine development. 
The third place goes UK investing $0.5 billion, third Germany. 

In total $5.9 billion went vaccine development, Germany US alone invested half. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think you’re smart one comparing 100 years flu deaths basically 365 days Covid deaths?! Yes. Covid year ago, first dose Moderna Sunday, night got fever bad, Monday ok evening cue chills/fever/aches etc 24 hours. felt better around dinner achy fever hopefully I’m near end disgusting watching media try turn covid ""justice"" thing even disgusting people working. start earlier AstraZeneca apply approval ?  Thats anti vax, even anti single vax, false information company astrazeneca. since cherry pick data etc fair share controversies even vaccine even difficult jump conclusions. first vaccine either thats excuse. Doubt actually hid results trustworthy crap did? Yeah factoring things.

1) WAYYY people vaccinated covid year vaccinated flu given year. lowball figure right 60%, that's conservative, likely higher employers require it. 60% American adults get flu shot every year.

2) vaccines question significantly effective flu vaccines. Even J&amp;J one efficacy higher flu vaccines since lot years top around 50% 50% protected severe infection. Every vaccine protects death hospitalizations covid.

3) covid already killing 10% infected....that's blatant misinformation.


Furthermore anticipation variants odd, assuming going happen variants worse. Oh feel hard. came away conversation six closest friends absolutely stunned weekend. eight us, husband intend get vaccine. One wasn’t talked I’m sure thing is. Two others already also get hurry. three remaining hyper intelligent science minded people; antithesis fox watchers. I’m confused. It’s little complicated, read article! Pro-vax, anti-vax, left, right. thing consistent people want know science \*actually\* says. There's difference though. windows open see one maskless patient, time, office. Last year, use run outside seeing patients make office ventilate itself. 

I've made sure avoid, run quickly past, limit exposure time places indoor dining.

In Starbucks, indoor dining matter, multiple patrons removing masks multiple tables. windows open. Easier Covid air float around maskless patrons. 

Hence, reason state, 50% opening indoor dining, starting see rise positive cases. People think ok eat indoors, lifting restrictions, top mask fatigue. 

Getting back topic Korean Starbucks' story, patrons infected. mask wearing employees. Yes, N95 masks helpful, feel wearing strong material-made mask, itself, least, helpful well long limit exposure (an outside bubble) someone without mask. took almost 1 month ago still recurring headaches it. 2 days shot almost passed cause couldnt pump blood body keep head awake stand time. Definitely wait super long post made want nitpick everything. 

1. 100k americans hong kong flu argument. feel like pretty terrible argument 100k masks lockdowns social distancing vs 500k+ insane amount protections. I.e. apples apples. response flu covid would probably like 1k deaths. obv covid equal flu.

2. think actually tried balance thing. Keep things open, shut things down. places wear masks, others don't. got worst worlds. took economic hit still lost 500k people. Sometimes half measures way go. going take economic hit matter what. opinion used power richest country world full attacked it. see similar outcome australia similar economic hit took. potentially reopen sooner, workers better long term economic outlook.

Increasingly difficult studies. Would able provide source ? comment removed? Except BC requires prescription, consultation tests . Also huge disclaimer meds well

Clearly compared likes morderna Pfizer, AZ inferior everyway terms health outcomes young women, die much Ya, looks like either UK special anomaly they're missing . many countries catching UK , something going consistently relevant username.

In bright side watching Goff try get wreck Ralphed Mack two times year fun watching Bosa it. individual level, young woman, know risk higher; vaccine getting fatal covid. experience varies. know people get bed know people fine. people fine talked day shot cuz work they're family member. also people work take day off. issue that, seems like reasonable way weight uncertain risk blood clots known risk covid older people.

What take issue parent's comment, 'alarming trend people getting blood clots receiving it.' Said commenter watered response preceding comment something reasonable. 

Confusing publicity last thing need here. Uncertainty good, alarmist rhetoric not. That's BC disclaimers need prescription see BC suitable

Looks like AZ treated way look who’s anti vaping stance 

The world health service health bought kid's done none that. Thank god internet backyards. good luck little passenger O:-) recommended way less vulnerable variants. many countries reporting cases much higher % , seems UK anomaly either poor monitoring, genetics, different batches, really reason

But many different countries reporting higher amount cases AZ , much likely UK either special somehow, catching cases occur Can’t good witch hunt without someone blame. Let’s get everyone vaccinated first. hope I'm right studied worked media long enough recognize certain things. Breaking bad news art form itself. bet, others inside aware bad news regarding covid breaking outright would either cause panic anger unrest. Therefore steer narrative certain direction order make news seem less 180 break.

Considering major issue right vaccines escape variants, I'd think would something it.  Hope I'm wrong. definitely trust German numbers. lol What’s also sad much pandemic messaging tailored lucky enough already situations could easily switch WFH scenarios. seen estimates % Americans able this— I’d assume 25% less. everyone else it’s basically Screw you, yr career yr yr w exposure virus, best luck. make mild claim. said ""alarming trend people getting blood clots receiving it"". 

Had said said snapped you. Uncertainty good, 'alarming trend's, much. Maybe does, look? guess could even mail something. Btw math share too. Theres data many countries, make sure include things like chance catch covid, age groups, influence precautions, alternate vaccines etc etc list long ;-p Congratulations! anti's show sabotage success, run town :). 31 cases people getting specific type thrombosis specific blood vessel brain, 31 relevant number.

In 19 cases also observed blood platelet deficiency, far straw possible mechanism specific brain thrombosis could happen first place. know platelet issue really causes clot vessel know deficiency impact. statistics right now. I'm sorry people treating like that. means anything, internet stranger truly appreciates work doing! going happen soon. close finish line give now. vaccinating record speed. Cases way down. four weeks. Think through. May 10, first tier completed 2nd shot, well healthcare, teachers, 65+. high number 50+. 18-49 mostly first shot completed. 

Businesses, get reservation books ready. coming! People ignoring regulations doesn’t mean pandemic over. explain California surges despite strict rules paper. taking 2 year average one time event. flu around 1000s years. fact dont care 100% kill rate could kill every man woman child including entire family. people wanted take chance, allowed to. Sorry, allow comments solicit donations requests money. Thank understanding!

South Korea Starbucks cluster Same. scared vaccine all, got it, think wrong force onto people. 


Likewise, police harassed neighborhood teenagers playing basketball autumn last year, said wrong too.


Also remember visiting soup kitchen beginning last year police tried shut “gathering”. Bruh. People need eat. surge tied people deciding ignore restrictions figuring nobody enforcing everything honor system. confirm. I've 1b tier (logistics) high risk I'm 31 seen doctor 10 years bc insurance. signed text alerts vaccine available... nothing. peep. 

Then hotline opened up. called lead another hotline service. 

The closest vaccination point like 15 miles away business hours.

Pure Michigan  seriously Vietnam America doesn’t Health workers vaccinated early mostly Pfizer, it’s comparatively small amount 50s group 6/CV who’ve AZ jab. Similar here.

Its till late 90's discovered genetic variance Scandinavia made people immune HIV. 

I think given time find part population natural immunity covid 19. Oh, yeah. Covid going think Easter fun holiday year. False equivalency. beyond politics. Start sharing raw data, source samples, allow intnl investigators talk personnel lab, handful scientists. Also state categorically PLA operating lab force show cards US intel  I’m sure it’s they’re poor, FOSS nerds, it’s really cute use SerialCloner SnapGene something better 😊

I guess might indoctrinated using Word doc old habits, don’t think I’ve ever seen another piece software Cyan default color. Yeah, GDP changed lot, don’t know GDP constant dollars. It’s certainly easier raise debt now, many Japanese Chinese willing buy it. Back 40s US issue war bonds, increase taxes, enforce rationing. It’s ironic young people going get vaccine virus, they’ll wish dead everything said done.

Millions (yes millions) people going ruined point return. lot jobs never coming back. Mobile working automation going keep least 60-70% people work due pandemic, either permanently unemployed severely underemployed.   One large gathering result 100+ cases, make moving back tier reality. So, tell people mega-churches wear mask, please. Ah okay, thank you. actually went , refreshed page ton entered information, able book appointment relatively close apartment today. actually appointments appearing appear turbo vax. I'm quite sure though. Also: owning house pool increases risk drowning Alternative link:  finally eligible even list last week despite waiting month. Even apparently people state scheduled across state live, recently someone sued state travel expenses nearly 300mile round trip 1st shot sure is!

But I’m going protected 35 days 14. Even cautious CDC put shots 80% effective 14 days post. similar analyses I’ve seen usually boxcar days before, it’s already built-in underestimation, people developing COVID day 14 likely contracted around day 7.  That's pay big bucks retail pharmacists get breaks, math pretty close otherwise haha No, that's point. point everything requires balance, clear balanced, rational, utilitarian perspective this. Scotland, average age COVID death men 83 life expectancy normally 82.5. Ireland, 90% COVID deaths people never entered ICU -- i.e. hospital ethicists determined co-morbidities high would unethical extend lives further. anyone actually factoring ""loss years life"" instead ""deaths"" comparing costs well-known increased mortality associated unemployment psychological stress? think *impossible* ""medicine"" cause harm disease, simply wrong. 

Meanwhile... opioid epidemic killed 500,000 Americans, yet nobody shut economy prevent hardly money spent fight it. normal year, US 100,000 deaths nosocomial infections Europe another 100,000 deaths. Yet prevention simply matter demanding PPE, better equipment sterilization, better air handling -- things could solve spending money. Cars kill 1.35 million people every year, yet nobody seems suggest shutting car traffic. three examples kill people much younger typical COVID death, actually impact ""loss years life,"" yet reason spend $6 trillion mitigating them. 

In 1950s, vaccine, polio caused high rates paralysis death children -- valuable members society years life lose. Yet outbreak hit school, school shut week two reopened. People thought cost shutting education semester year high despite ravages disease. Americans 1950s different calculus compared Americans 2020s? one got balance wrong? 

The Hong Kong flu killed 100,000 Americans 1968, slightest thought cancel Woodstock, etc. flu 1958. American universities shut Spanish flu 1918 -- converted dormitories expanded sanatoria got students volunteer care sick. difference attitude? become smarter dumber? simply value life now? 

The bottom line normal inescapable tolerate certain amount death simply part life. shut life effort prevent every possible death. spend *any* amount money preventing death. somehow agree balance. Faced widespread media hysteria, know right balance? politicians policy-makers sitting economists, epidemiologists, psychologists *together* calculate right balance? meet one separately? simply react public opinion? know answer -- you? Getting mine next Monday! subject hand people *at fault*, i.e. gain spread coronavirus innocently. 31 years old, spent 8 days icu November COVID.

Eligibility. knew I'd eligible previous Monday two weeks still found appointments entire time I've checking sheriff's boss? reprimanded? too, doctors understand mechanism behind it, surveys self reported data, unreliable. respondents surveys also previously hospitalized, could skew numbers. I've seen anywhere 10% 30%, probably high based hospitalizations. idea, maybe 5%? Maybe 10%, considering 20% symptomatic cases hospitalized?


 reports people mild cases symptoms appear later, months testing negative, seem resolve, concerning. Living chronic illness really sucks, hope people experience that. Occam's Razor; Dozens unidentified Bat Corona-viruses transported Yunnan Wuhan institute virology already triggered warnings safety lack trained staff procedures. Outbreak starts Wuhan, still found natural spillover, process completed one month genome sequenced SARS 2003. country even think mine? 

Anyone thinks countries share food non-selfish reasons foot shortage delusional. 

If we’re food shortage first world countries can’t get food, international markets won’t jackshit. reason state (TN) opened vaccination age 16+ demand low. major cities lagging behind rest state demand much higher compared rest state people anti-vaxx even first phase could vaccinated showing rural county better vaccinate someone ineligible vs. one. 25-35% demographic thst saw deaths still 10's millions people? Remember middle last year saying vaccines available \*anyone\* June 2021? actually case, badly think US would right now? Would things much worse right now? would to. imagine media frenzy got ignored covid outbreak? I'm pretty sure legal either. guidance always cautious take precautions vaccine rollout complete. Thst fastest way, fewest deaths, oit pandemic. cuz would like Brazil Trump still power also cared Power people 550,000+ Body Count Selfish Pride Private corporations continued manufacture millions doses unapproved clear buyer. 

Do really think government saved you? mom sending texts day “don’t need vaccine” “the vaccine real vaccine, it’s shot” “it causes death, infertility, etc.”

Trust me, people exist. sure stop dissuade her.

The worst part vaccinated children... looks like need read international exchanges. common market's aim precisely avoid getting that, UK already starting experience.

I used always defend britons typical french would start throwing abuse mindlessly, I'm actually starting see saw since brexidiots started making heard.

You fools destroying country. wonder best amongst chose become french rather go back mother ship poised sink. Yup. I'm aware did, think Final Four game, Championship game gets called, fooling yourself. Umm report read tens millions AZ doses...it literally says 180k AZ doses.

So science seems gathering around 1 100k rate blood clots AZ prevalent younger women.

So 180k enough sample size declare substantial link countries identified started understanding cause.

So link statement accurate. 

In absence data studies countries deciding risk public health public confidence vaccines pausing use AZ vaccines smart move correct.

Do harm. Moderna already said believe it’s going endemic. Learn live learn live fear. shits going around decades. annual shot like flu. 

You think it’s going keep getting deadly 20% population isn’t vaccinated? That’s going change. way vaccinate 5.6b people per year forever. better compared countries IL 35% first vaccine kind hunger games getting appts distribution wonky causing folks quite upset. Since Pfizer Moderna require two doses, means everyone takes get double penetrated whether like not. Yeah weeds anti-vaxxers honestly idea hoping sub 100k annually, guess we’ll find out. Next thing I’m interested long vaccine remains effective needing booster they’ll enough updated boosters early fall older relatives don’t need isolate month 2 waiting. Yeah, CCP ordered evidence destroyed let happen long time ago. never admit admit lying omission save face. number one goal try appear competent even costs lives Chinese citizens that. Propaganda 101 control narrative costs. missing all.

Much less likely license ""return normal"" vaccination roll complete.

You still wear mask social distance strangers everyone wants vaccine one. fastest way pandemic largest reduction deaths..

This literally guidance every heath organization planet, include CDC. Let’s jump make socially acceptable wear mask prefer allow ppl choose want continue hormonal contraceptive pill clotting rate 1 600 users. hasn’t pulled? American drop u often.
Que one example . second u gone might well get rid e. 
They savages also spell colour color. elevator? Someone sneezed without covering? A'aight, let pull mask put on. judgement, questions asked.

Because scenario, already exposed germs. Holy shit! rational person they'll blame her? literally never told get virus vaccination. always told 95 percent effective. That's can't understand that. Nah, that's grammatical mess threw there.

1) put apostrophe plural.

2) lumped ""tested positive"" ""died,"" could read ""no one received vaccine tested positive covid,"" false.

3) OP shared headline exactly originally written, way better editorializing think correcting grammar. Yeah many covid vaccines Obama hand out?

I rest conservacase Masks/bandanas face pretty normal thing wear raves electronic festivals is. literally every single trial study; example Moderna phase 3 trial, conducted restrictions, double blind; 6 every 100 fully vaccinated persons contracted symptomatic covid. (They test asymptomatic cases); hence trial ""96% effective"".

Now keep mind people trial know part 50% got placebo, 50% got vaccine, trial conducted lockdowns mask mandates, Moderna pointed emergency authorization hearing, number high. 

Bottom line, Fully vaccinated persons contracted covid19, symptomatic asymptomatic. infected, contagious.

This virus stop virus vaccinated. vaccine practically eliminates risk severe covid death covid19 (though least 1 death aware fully vaccinated person aware Israeli data).

If fully vaccinated still get covid19, still give others. masks important everyone wants vaccine, one. people tiniest inkling wanting make lives safer, still reminded well vaccines help prevent illness transmission. still care that, they're likely lost cause.  Especially years many us know someone survived often describe ""not even worst cold"" they've had. average person medical field experiencing would expect major health crisis be. shit? even like sports go vaccinated.
I miss mass society.
Being stadium 60 thousand people screaming would amazing two regions part attaches cell. 

No shit. That's entire point. High selective pressure two regions leads many different shapes make lock pick stops able pick lock.

54% mutations RBM positive binding free energy changes. That's indicative selection driver variants. also indicates mutation favors increased infectivity. 21, health conditions, got shot yesterday. Took five minutes, awesome, out.

Also unrelated I’d contend Ohio actually pretty sweet place live, depending you’re looking for. Same, antibody testing super careful got tested every time felt off. showered every time went outside house came back, wiped phone whatever else bring outside every time, always wore N-95 mask. I'm getting strong reaction 1st dose Moderna there's literally way could COVID guess always possibility. Hope feeling better now, I'm curious second dose go! Younger people stronger, active immune systems. side effect caused adverse immune reaction, younger people could likely experience it. educated guess vaccines could mixed matched. use different methods get body produce spike proteins, they’re made, end result really similar - little bits look like COVID viral particles body learns attacks.

It’s kind like teaching recognize slice pizza. one day get slice pizza frozen pizza, next day get slice delivery, methods production different end result largely learn pizza looks like effectively either way.

(Slightly less ELI5 answer: mRNA vaccines send instructions making spike proteins directly cells, J+J AZ infect customized virus includes spike protein instructions. Either way, directions similar.) Good them. I'd rather trust dog healthcare decisions Biden, whose boy Obama killed mom's healthcare offered employer! Check Guelaguetza. People gonna lie it. What’s next “show papers?” know gross question know, lol. got first dose past Monday asked beforehand diarrhea (cha cha cha, diarrhea cha cha cha, diarrhea cha cha cha) last 14 days. lied said no, even though last week something ate (it may Taco Bell). vaccine still work me? guess asked diarrhea meant diarrhea result sick flu something like something ate, lol. gotten doses, work ICU, still scared shitless every day come home.
Fear always rational. I'm terrified airplane crashes even though they're statistically unlikely happen; turn 30 two weeks still plane!

You're scared continue go work every day even vaccinated, I'm guessing. rationalized somehow going work important fear, now, got ""fully vaccinated"" either true, antibodies Summer sure hell going get 2nd round vaccinations anyone else get's first. keep mind. CDC Biden administration even begun plan ""annual boosters"" yet. Additionally, antibodies last 6 months going 6 months year time get ""booster.""

As said before, I'm vaccine trial I'm helping find answers scary questions! fear, decided put better use scared. Maybe help people little less scared well. Translation: lockdown imminent want happy tier system fickle. Counties gone one color back prior color span less month. India vaccinate 60 million people got AZ. really curious know many people issues.

My mother also got vaccinated yesterday AZ. so? dream!!!! really really really hope get back knottsberry year!!!!!

I've trying weeks find vaccination. finally scheduled one morning site scheduled already appointments none available within 300 miles tonight. Oh Oklahoma kicking ass vaccines, surprisingly. got second shot weeks ago. I’m concerned us going back normal soon.. everyone chance become fully vaccinated. fully vaccinated, I’m talking 1 week (for Pfizer) 2 weeks (Moderna) post-second shot hitting town. It’s concerning several cities already elected end mask mandates, I’m sure you’ve noticed traffic insane lately. Yesterday actually ditched cart walked 2 stores checkout lines long. People like mild spring heat summer mention peanut butter 😊 agree you, many unvaccinated people things you’re talking (seeing grandkids, going dinner, etc.) whole time therefore won’t see scenarios kind incentive. almost OTC that’s used Germany that’s OTC anywhere else.

Highly regulated pharmacy sector. doubt it. Couldnt confirm 100% im quite sure mine drawn back. think we’re gonna hit demand wall sooner rather later. Polls already way sampling people gotten vaccinated hesitancy could worse think. “Waiting convince anti vaxxers lift restrictions” could probably extremely toxic political fight don’t imagine governor wanting put themself position. Hopefully everyones access weeks restrictions go felt nothing first second. flu hell February 2020, wonder odds me. Northwest indiana here, people wear masks pleasantry. private get together other's homes without masks. Reeeeally hope Factor V Leiden, (previous history clots including lungs). get first Moderna shot tomorrow. keep /r/Clotsurvivors though far everyone similar boat fine. second shot scares most, we'll see. either catch Covid, certainly want latter. Although can't help feel like guinea pig right now. blood thinners life though, hopefully helps. goal complete vaccination program without new variants spreading. Then, we’ve reached threshold population immunity - estimated around 70% vaccinated previously infected - able reopen rapidly safely.

The one asterisk plan children - probably fine summer break, hopefully study results young kids time new school year begins fall. This. lot center right old school right hopped bandwagon pandemic situation grew worse, change/improvement policy. chose handle coronavirus kid gloves pummeling us bare-fisted. question az. country got everywhere see see talk bad someone tell I'm talking blood cloght situation. Aspirin also safe, deadly people conditions causes thin blood. could similar problem astra's vaccine, that's statically deaths significant. None vaccines causing deadly problems like that, thus serious precautions countries taking. upvote too!  Try come something original. Especially people still obsessing former guy two months later. Death rates 60s 80% massive positive. believe April pushing 2nd doses. information well J&amp;J vaccine performing far? understand use 1/3 time others. Tens millions doses administered throughout world........ hate say it, oversee management apartments (like 1,000 them, lot buildings) I’d say half people owe huge balance go work every day like before, per on-site managers. lot people pay bills bc to. pay rent utilities bc didn’t, would get evicted water would get shut off. current pressing consequences. Future consequences don’t matter people. 

I’ve 15 years ppl really responsible. Landlords evil jaded people bc see worse people.  Well, BioNtech seems good too. Little side effect, hope receive one. huge numbers administered give certainty really safe claimed. Make people carry vaccine cards seniors wealthy counties got vaccines higher rates seniors poor counties though, that's discriminatory. discriminatory people less resources quarantine, that. Anecdotally, parents Florida retirees several stories among friends/acquaintances vaccination clinics exclusive country clubs gated communities early rollout. believable put rich people front line. Full disclosure though access article. going get AZ vaccine 16th April serious concerns getting  excuse glorify current idiot chief. I’ve dying official statement this. link source? Lol. Sureeeee. Keep telling this. getting numbers? Berkley? talking ""blood donation"", talking routine blood analysis conducted virtually every doctors visit. 

Firstly, test everybody. Sampling do.

Secondly, vaccinated people interest knowing vaccination harm them. low platelet counts detected, drugs prescribed prevent blood clotting. 

There good excuse sampling platelet counts vaccination situation many people doubts vaccine. end Trumps term, 1 million doses per day starting given. go ahead ignore fact. least one non-zero basis reality since flu vaccine actually contains flu virus. None covid vaccines contain covid. also boycott form EU UK? Yeah that's point use poor delivery's poor performance push blame onto  Yes, better safe sorry. fully understand, would feel paranoid too. girlfriend love her. Valid feelings.
If worry get checked sooner later. shame diagnosis says ""no issues found, normal vaccination side effects"".

Yeah, mate.

Yep that's point, fault AZ's LOL wish sarcasm strange feeling it’s not. I've gotta ask this, Covid vaccine single greatest medical creation history? IMO could surpassed creation Penicilin, hopefully eventual cure cancer. North West study quoted showed us 60%, looks encouraging. first jab 2 wks ago hubby second last week, older relatives theirs. Massive uptake rates UK believe far around 90%. Feels like right track. Biden didn’t anything either. Water wet. already millions shots going people's arms daily final days Trump's presidency. Biden that, Trump did. seems kinda scary, it? medical ultrasound rupture parts coronavirus structure, can't also rupture parts (desirable, healthy) structures? Short answer many human among space 31 millions. I’ll take risk think Curevac pushed partner larger partner experience setting trials. made Biontech - Pfizer partnership successful. Biontech never developed vaccine before. Pfizer knew set trial, manufacturing, distribution etc. perfect match. higher chance age group 2 weeks, one year entire life? Since big pharma proved less innovative small innovative start-ups past, reasonable expect true future. Innovation ongoing process.

Big pharma practices financial capitalism swallow innovators. Everybody trying get mRNA vaccines. State needs strengthen position innovators defend predatory instincts big pharma. bit absurd I\~m it, main reason easy implement police check. Also keep mind Spaniards dont know concept personal distance, see people chatting street hours close other. UK reports Deaths 12 week lockdown. vulnerable

That's part makes least sense. ""most vulnerable"" shelter place. target spreaders. indirectly help vulnerable effectively. Otherwise, yes, excellent article. BREAKING NEWS: spend time family makes conflict family. 

We spent money discover this. I'm group 6 got pfizer one yesterday.  UK numbers abnormal, others are.

Nobody scaring anyone ""no reason"". Medical experts found statistically much significant phenomenon needs understood. meantime good workaround: Preferably vaccinate older people AZ, see phenomenon group. head cannot seen independent authoritative figure comes China given money China invested native country best news: worst news latest death-rate data Brazil P.1. That's bad sign parts world lacking vaccines.  ^^^ except state governor doesn’t invoke state wide mask mandate, leaving local governments, later bans local government mask mandate places don’t require it. 😒 (can tell little peeved dealing today) 

I think mask proof vaccination makes sense. can’t prove it, wear mask. don’t mask, one provided you. It’s really great see Germany well investment, constant lockdown &amp; heavy restrictions since November end sight I’m donor UK noticed website recently states donate week vaccination. countries would similar restrictions place   assume. It’s interesting though. fair Germans stereotypically good planners. Headline makes sound like died covid. don’t mention died. die covid? time ? Kinda fear story posting. Fortnight contraction earlier usage, fourteen-night. Seven-night also used exist many years ago, nowadays week used. ""what vaccines developed public funding "" mean? Yes sure, per capita, Germany invested way US UK.  even mean? Germany clearly invested enough financially speaking, since arguably successful vaccine developed here. another vaccine candidate (CureVac) might good, kinda slow compared BioNTech.

Our main ""issue"" (if believe issue all) invested companies ""these global companies global world global marketplace, want successful Germany stays important influential global player global economy"" mindset instead investing companies thinking ""Germany First, doses belong us!"".

Another issue mostly focused giving money trusting right thing. BioNTech clearly succeeded that. CureVac? I'm sure. took way long set trials. Maybe government interference like US could sped process up. invested money. Honestly billion nothing compared lives money lost due pandemic lockdowns. spent dozens hundreds billions it. miserable failure. is? Talking potential issues vaccine we’re injected with? Vaccinating number people making older actually reduce spread more. places still ""in winter"" surges actually need help. Places outdoor weather problems. surprising government, fired people reporting fake figures, ended reporting fake figures.  big roughly 30% population California received least one dose vaccine another 30% natural immunity,” said, “we see fourth surge state.” havent seen single brit pst source showing much young people vaccinated AZ. enough data yet know good long-term protection provided vaccines is. also significant selection advantage mutations affect immunized individuals.

I would feel safer production could ramped two doses per person per year, range 15 billion doses per year. probably requires states provide guarantees manufacturers compensated decommission added production lines year two. sucks. end, clinic trying get registered system months able provide them, still aren’t yet. general easier get prescriptions online pharmacies attached rubberstamp doctor UK EU, prevalence would low explain anyhow.

The places like USA asian lot available OTC - unless something pops doubt OTC factor. Good job 25% transmission unknown routes. Germany, guess proud officials manage find transmission routes 25% cases, 75% remain unknown. Well actually know since health authorities even publish number districts, do, terrible number. lot people discussing AZ could benefit learning basic Trolley Problem is. *Some* effects vaccine extremely rapid. mRNA vaccines, [symptom mostly stopped day 11 (look cumulative incidence graph), [viral dropped 75% test positive day 12. J&amp;J [like week later know antibodies keep scaling afterwards (the viral load graph shows even bigger difference effects second dose kick in).

A B.1.351 outbreak prison Colorado appears ended almost immediately [85% population mRNA vaccinated within 48 although clear also used draconian distancing. weirdo kisses trumps ass biggly depends entirely risk groups in. take extreme example, live home office fine low risk covid infection also woman (IIRC) 20 50 high risk side-effect (apparently quite accurately described blood clots) might make sense wait research another vaccine becomes available.

Pfizer moderna. 

As move younger demographics, moral dilemma changes maths changes. problem double masking higher resistance airflow *through* masks lead air going gaps *around* mask.

I'm quite convinced fit much larger part equation filtering properties material mask (assuming course material least around 95% BFE, case FFP2/3, surgical masks, also good reusable non-woven textile masks). fact, textile masks (certified 95% BFE) fit better FFP2 masks due using elastic materials may thus actually work better situations. Unfortunately, materials tested certified, difficult find information takes fit account.

Instead double masking (which rather hit miss) think would better explicitly focus fit, provide solutions (better mask shapes, elastic materials, silicone adjustments, ...).

The issue rare side effect move younger demographics.  Hahaha same. freeeezing last night it’s less okay now. Still bit feverish everything hurts. Get well soon! Possible reason:

 - Low amount testing (24% test positivity)
 - late, soft lockdown
 - [Underfunded - [Highest mobility level EU March 22.](/r/hungary/comments/meywzk/emberek_mozgolódása_2020_januárhoz_képest/)

The [doctors demanded strict instead government announced easing next week. It’s mystery ifif look hard enough. I’m 21 AZ jab last week I’m FINE probably something obvious like autoimmune disease - case would've identified first stopped investigate. assume they're trying figure commonalities new cases (and appear happening UK). good news one different. unparalleled supply astonishingly efficacious vaccines administered incredible clip. act quickly, surge could merely blip United States. move slowly, people become infected terrible new variant, acutely dangerous yet vaccinated.

Interesting criteria “acute danger” lack vaccine. poor EMA. Doesn’t power UK work vaccine producer allow fast smooth approval system.

Are stupid ? Ema work AZ. simply apply approval. think visit doctor. Seems problems.  Lol ain’t taking shit 20yo really bad health even want vaccine.

sorry afraid something lower chance killing seasonal flu. 
I bet weathered 2 decades without developing anxiety disorder, no? mine morning. 27 years old. Currently full body convulsions. High fever, shaking like im frozen core every joint hurts. Feels like MS something awful I'm also aware less 1% polio cases paralytic symptoms, less 1%, 5 10 percent resulted fatalities. People act like polio baby killing machine, facts show far common far less deadly public perception would indicate.

I'll bet money vast majority measles deaths happened countries drinking water taking swim could easily kill you. link source figures? US supposed spent 18 billion USD Operation Warp Speed alone. significantly 2.2 billion mentioned article. thought places higher inclinations high need, riskier behaviors? cases without slowing, risk populations. 

Reservations US highest vaccination rates thought, could contribute Wisconsin vax rate also. 

Idk. Because.. get covid sure wait another vaccine become available? Poor deliveries alone would suffice that, reason even bother arguing performance. emergency approval

theres problem right there. cvs j%j? Oh poor EMA. Doesn’t power UK work vaccine producer allow fast smooth approval system. 

Totally victim this. Clearly AZ didn’t really want make fast effective vaccine, wanted keep themselves. Lol Russia rescue [what Aspirin can't cause problematic bleeding unless hematologic condition.. basically alternative ibuprofen/paracetamol frequently taken over-the-counter analgetic. 

Really sure mean. sick yes would considerate so. getting vaccine mean get covid either. decision whether get AZ wait another vaccine continue laying low. making decision, would compare risk death getting AZ vaccine vs probability would get covid another vaccine becomes available times risk death covid. I'd say 0.6 per 100,000 probably overstatimg tje true risk death waiting another vaccine (which would change based long wait another vaccine becomes available). explained variation aerosol production individual individual. produce lot, others produce little. 

Aerosol production might function lung involvement Covid infection without lung disease (e.g. Covid URTI), far less likely transmit (this perhaps what's happening kids). thought vaccine make us immune virus, reduces symptoms ? still catch spread ? know helps, here's FAQ Germany's Paul-Ehrlich-Institute (scientific institute vaccine safety agency). temporary suspension 7 cases (now we're 30 so). state point 4 expected incidence would 1. citation, though. yet, people bully hesitant get vaccine shot. 
A young 24 year old French guy died AstraZeneca shot.
People right ask questions.
That make conspiracy theorists.
People dying vaccine shot, lot, completely normal hesitant hear this. Portugal today recorded **two Covid-19-related deaths**, lowest number since 6 September, **388 new cases** infection new coronavirus,

A quick reminder: British variant hit country December, Portugal highest death rate worldwide daily new infections rose 15,000 January. 15,000 daily new infections 388 two months, even though Portugal fifth vaccines deployed UK Chile, example. should. 

the immune reaction spike protein real virus. 
you better long term contract naturally recover getting jab. 

as healthy 20yo really (good/sane) reason take vaccine. them. novavax one would even consider taking. thank god already COVID.
 
well, appease hypochondriacs arround you. suspect California done key.

Curevac eventually realized needed big player pharma industry signed agreement Bayer, much late.

It's infuriating Germany enough large pharma companies capable producing vaccines mass quantities. mean, could think Bayer last spring, I'm sure could/should have. family lake house small town. Beside flying lake house immediate family. Thinking strong point ?

AstraZeneca APPLY approval time. 
The EMA can't make AstraZeneca apply earlier. company decision apply approval. 2,000 UK - peaked around 1,600 daily deaths January. No, investment research production. covax fund different thing. mainly risk complications older age groups, contract Covid, outweighs risk clotting. younger people suffer less serious effects Covid risk serious complications would higher clotting Covid Cancelled appointment first AZ dose tomorrow due German halt vaccine age/gender group.

God hope made right decision... think states drop straight 16+, rather give tiers age scheduling system crash. US spent lot resources vaccine development last year, result ahead nearly world vaccine manufacturing distribution, three good options ample supply.

chance never need feel unsafe all.

taking vaccine stop feeling miserable absolute wrong reason. 302 deaths Hungary like 9 900 USA. I'm going go limb say absurd.

In ideal world, sure. Wearing masks outside, except crowded places, mostly useless. Wearing indoors, crowd distance cannot respected, enough.

But real world, what's more, context Spain, country people love ignore circumvent rules (and say Spaniard). Rules enforced generally ignored. Even enforced, people always try find excuses appeal fines anyway.

In region Spain, rule enforcing masks outside crowded areas keep safe distance. Result? people wear mask even tightest crowds. hard enforce could always say ""but enough distance"", ""but passed crowd two seconds..."" people ignored rule. also many people went without masks wanted enter shops, ""hey, forgot mask, one minute, buy bread leave"".

Then changed masks outside times, people follow rule. People forget mask, crowds always. Problem solved.

It's sad, things work here. Sweden people even follow government recommendations...  Every second day reddit see AstraZeneca trending. cheap kina giving edge india vaccine department world. seems attempt discredit vaccine whichever way possible. know sounds stupid every day feels fishy way targetting one vaccine. Changing goalposts now? Yesterday, thought restrictions explain it, AZ withdraw main vaccine caused problems, thus causing slow rollout""

Although fair, AZ least partly blame slow rollout, far worst company comes deliveries schedules. Great idea, awesome artwork. know, fuck American read find fortnight weird word? Thats way works everywhere far know. grandparents sign too. tough sell everyone outside UK. sincerely hope right, rest world worse statistics UK govt. does. 

Personally, still think measures countries like Germany, France, Canada, Norway , Denmark and. Sweden justified positions. also think FDA justified sceptical taking long time approve it, do. 

For instance Germany, people making vaccines mandatory, something like situation AZ could absolutely strengthen vaccines formidable political force here. parliamentary system... Chile went strict lockdown  UK one 3 months ... vaccinations? induce sort T-cell production...? There's enough vaccines go around. Germany need sign vaccine (except old folks etc, med staff etc). many people expect even know it? Sure, ordering something company failing illegally seize control purchase theft. Sorry we're longer dying droves entertainment hateful nationalists like mate. Maybe look issues rather throwing bile others. barely cracks top ten youre looking Spanish Flu, smallpox old ass inventions. rollout slow likely due vaccine scarcity due bad planning Canada. course there's medicine zero side effects, there's 10 years period vaccines accepted. Since possible, vaccines are.fast approved, means concerns single vaccine, put hold immediately.

There issue astra's vaccines, others cause reasons concern, continue vaccination. Astra's need studies deemed safe. different levels immune response. cell immunity important. Imagine immune system holding onto sort blueprint antibodies covid 19 exposure occurs body instantly produce antibodies fight disease rather spending time ""drawing blueprints"" speak. unless vaccines proven ineffective variants, ppl fine. People love joke Biden ancient he’s 3.5 years older Trump, people never talked Trump’s age way. guess much interesting things pick Trump. AZ shady hell deliveries. fucked vaccination strategies. Countries unprepared unwilling counter act possibility decided blame easy target. think variants trials. least remember correctly. Almost 70% isn’t perfect, better many flu shots. It’s one dose nature lack need super cold temperatures makes good addition raising immunity, key part Africas vaccination strategy would guess Donald Trump one entire year early say ""it's flu !""

Had say (plus numerous bs'es) wonder many lives could saved... really crazy. government made illegal people even go outside short walk outside sport two months first lockdown.  

I think driving force want put blame high death toll people.  Making people wear masks empty beaches open spaces implies causing virus spread. deflects real failings govt protecting care homes vulnerable places. think figures refer national contribution Covax, supply poor countries vaccines.

The public funds developing and/or pre-financing production would come top this. too, US Germany likely biggest source funding. Find state drops appointments. Mine every Thursday 10:00 a.m. drops 12,000 appointments next week. usually sold within 10-15 minutes fair Germans stereotypically good planners.

Oh that's vaccine rollout ""sign up"" joke FDA Emergency Authorization. None available vaccines FDA approved. really notice mine hitting woke next morning, got around noon day before. felt like starting get cold day fine morning think I'll get fired tell boss get shots? He's pretty anti-vax. Meanwhile, across river New Jersey... things -

Um.

Very, bad.  Exactly. congestive heart failure, gunned gas pump, die congestive heart failure. died gunshot. Thank you. wife proud first dose number!!! convince free rider? Trying convince 50yr brother since eligible lawyer. antivax. think they're referred microemboli, millions small clots body caused massive immune activation platelets exhausted. patient eventually dies due haemorrhage. makes sense though, right? Half-people antibodies per given volume! really isn’t big deal



lol, even gonna take bait EU complete joke point. Complete utter failure crisis management sounds high. Unless blood clot occurs brain , usually quite treatable blood thinners. 

Can show evidence this? Like always know 2 3 weeks impact regard. Hopefully mostly young people cases going sorta meaningless. vaccine card official document. would hold case able access medical records upon request, write it. Thanks showing everyone kind person are.

The idea think everyone want help others create false sense superiority speaks volumes. yet are, higher numbers. AZ vaccine doesn’t use RNA Moderna vaccines here. I've slightly sore arm - different get flu shot. know people varied experiences this, try worry. peers (public health) vaccinated, nobody far reported notable side effects. I'd happy grateful either way; ventilator fun. really sad time lot people right  I'm boat, brother. four year old made absolutely progress socially past 12 months. feel bad him. Since adults house vaccinated now, we're slowly getting involved activities seeing kids again. whole demeanor ability play others suffered immensely. NY NYC getting J&amp;J. Check distribution allocation J&amp;J here:  gave award good enough days :((( reports done year earlier full, transparent, access data, people sites around Wuhan without political influence.

I'm sure value seen something. Oh haha that's said rolling 7 day average 1/20 998k, 1.5M day.    Anywhere 1 hour 72 hours norm said, quote, ""Cases spiking Texas well"". spiking.  

They extremely minor uptick levels far even last summer's wave (nevermind extreme holiday wave) Correct. anti-vax spreading false information vaccine - either ignorance malicious intent (it really matter). 

The OP insinuating AZ covered safety issues - evidence make people sceptical taking vaccine - blatant anti-vax rhetoric. roughly 22,000 excess deaths causes five year average? Surprisingly low. Ibuprofen acetaminophen fine even right vaccine. Would mean even production now? people called us ‘crazy conspiracy theorists’ ‘science deniers’. again, correct. wait see much we’re correct /r/dadjokes needs you. I’m 18, male live Uk got AstraZeneca one little ago I’m starting feel really worried. There’s going back now. anyone know typically time CVS opens vaccine appointments next day? seem schedule 4 days now, current allotment filled up.

Is 12AM? Man I'm sorry, comment hard read.

My sister 12, special needs great. personal teacher school would help academically social skills. Ever since schools closed started staying inside time lost almost progress.

She's become aggressive, snappy, emotional pees daily. 12 years old. 

Virtual learning hassle her. can't focus class, always distracted. stay room constantly start browsing internet forget go class. 

At point worst part difficult even get go outside things grow adjusted comfort zone, 'normal' things become scary uncomfortable. Even experiencing grown ass adult. 

I honestly understand people say 'kids fine' shrug off. Well, least that's scientist say. Obviously, certain science trusted blindly. CA going reopen fully year get tf here, spreading dangerous misinformation. hospitals really along good reason keep it, number people getting sick hospital per-COVID insane. Also really think near every doctor medically paranoid? report origins COVID-19, started China. looked data back 9 months ago, FL's death rate non covid related respiratory 500% 5 year average. course cooking books. Look pathetic excuse governor. anything China could prove come lab? year. access lab finds nothing, ""they cleaned site covered up"". information give investigators ""they manipulated data."" confirm. soon adults family got vaccinated, kids went right back seeing cousins friends like before. They're 5, babies, masks going happen. 

The idea kids going sit home alone another year promoted people young kids past 12 months live another reality parents. it’s calm turns pfizer misleading US one countries insists days trials conducted US, finished time. submitted next best thing , large scale trial conducted UK. transparent it, hoped US would accommodating. took 6 hours achieve headache exhaustion. resolved 18 hours. big deal. could've worked I'd already taken day preparation. doesn’t share math then? maybe bring light body  Bill fan, seeing full stadium like Josh Allen makes happy. Man wrigleyville changed much since moved away years ago. happened dives stance ""others it, one mandatory one fine""

Seems like pretty weak argument. Next it’s gonna , wait new vaccine Thank overcoming fear part! people refusing vaccine people chose spend better part year fighting minimum wage fast food retail employees asked wear masks first place, messaging would accomplish jack shit.  They’ll admit it’s gone it’s gone. It’s even close gone right America. Stay house quarantine, police people. vaccinated people want live lives can. underestimate far along are. turned everything today killed 90% population we'd still fucked.

The seas dead within 30yrs, last pandemic, natural disasters get worse worse year. Children (combined variants) going new target pundits. fuel media gives them, teacher unions continue advocate keeping schools partially open pRoTeCt cHiLdReN. virus emergency children. Socially isolating keeping schools is. sort cleaning? inside? really frustrating. medical authorities need get shit together communicate cautions ways dont undermine confidence jab. current strategy fuelling vaccine hesitancy. 

Blood clots uncommon background rate population 1 1000. Normally would go radar evidence far suggests causal link. Lol ok fine. I’m scared shitless. whole point lockdowns prevent hospitals overwhelmed. majority elderly vaccinated, makes sense lock Young low risk individuals don’t get hospitalized. That’s point  Yet actually give gold. argument ""because companies it, allow another mandatory one""...really? need help Mexico central America ASAP. We're monkeys. blue...and big blood clots issue vaccines birth control hmm Sign longterm fear instability book. know history endless unification separation. cycles. Currently seems stable likely decent amount time. Treatment isn’t quite simple that. Ultrasound attenuates passes tissues, different transducers depending body part/ organ imaged. High frequency attenuates quicker lower frequencies. would need apply different techniques frequencies tissues, realizing won’t able penetrate whole body without large amounts power applied. 

We also need worry tissue cavitation, don’t want apply long term ultrasound tissues risk destroying healthy tissue along coronavirus. certain types Doppler performed certain stages fetal gestation. 

Unfortunately great breakthrough, isn’t quite easy “waving wand” someone. People would still rebel, awful low control seemingly reason vaccinated soon. Sometimes prescribed hormones menopausal symptoms. Currently living Arkansas. Outside city live in, wouldn’t know mask mandate. People aggressively stupid. got first dose Moderna today. far side effects aside slightly sore arm, nothing bad all. Hope stays way. Yes will. long international travel exists pandemic battle vaccines variants completed everywhere earth. pandemic? helps any, I’m Texas considered tier one, got vaccines December. Ha, one mine sick right get covid test today. surprisingly handled better did.  
It wasn’t covid, cold. Kids lick everything Goood job UK! works.

Even fully vaccinated contract covid19 (both symptomaticand non-symptomatic), give covid19 others.

So yes, go blast, wear mask social distance strangers everyone wants vaccine one. FaKe Noooooooz Yes US Canada upward curves due UK variant starting spread. short term mean cases, vaccine rollout well US still reason hopeful longer term, assuming vaccine resistant strains emerge (big if). Biden eyeing timeline loosening restrictions travel across borders Mexico Canada. Whether reciprocate think depends cases situation vaccines widely available Canada then. Based updated figures (which think improve get J&amp;J leftover doses US) could see mid-to-late May realistic tbh. We'll wait see. mine?  SAID that? zomg! Remember even sure we'd vaccine year?

This absolute miracle. Vietnam, probably done better countries. Population almost 100 million 35 deaths. citation this? I'm unaware name change AstraZeneca/Oxford ChAdOx1 AZD1222 vaccine...

Edit: yes, apparently ""Vaxzevria"". Wow.  UK one generous job support schemes Europe. They're paying 80% furloughed staff wages September, also applies self employed people, well cheap business loans. wow really loving late night anxiety giving European 20-year-old, female, recently AZ vaccinated paramedic.

genuinely, happy finally get sense normalcy, shit. wanna panic cause got mine 6th march, guess ok, still doom scrolling thread shred positivity great yay  No, didn’t take 6 weeks. Russia’s application late Could injection technique? muscle vs pinching skin? true, first quarter quite slow countries. reason believe production capacity ramping see much greater % population vaccinated Q2 Q1. think hard optimistic first 3 months slow.

The Netherlands (where live) slowly pushing back expectations though. beginning year, one high-risk medical group prioritized one block vaccines starting March. eventually split 2, 3 groups, last (""least-high-risk"") starting May. kind quietly move goalposts due receiving fewer doses expected. Hopefully next months changes. really necessary, warmer sunnier weather coming means people gathering. Horgan right. Don’t apologize right. Lets hope so. also kind hoping government would come tax credit something incentive. know jobs giving extra PTO recovery vaccine such, money talks. 

Some state already trying pass laws make religious beliefs valid reason exemption take vaccine. would rule schools able require it. Also making hard employers require it. Young teens catch release Covid. dont get sick get silently pass others. Think Typhoid Mary. strictly talking way graphs look. Thry wont look ""thicker"" proportion same. scale goes up, nothing going get thicker. Ibfeel going dumb irrelevant tangent trying muddle water.

So get back point. rest uk scotland would bean young people get AZ, even total numbers obviously bigger. 9 1 10 1 favor Pfizer, able math. 15 39 group makes like 30 million people? Right? 15% would 4,5 mill. Lets say 90% got Pfizer. Thst would leave 500 k people 50 got AZ. Since problem mostly females, drop 250 k. Feel free fix math wrong. not, brits stop misleading narrative ""we vaccinated 30 million, dont problems!!"" Yes, that's avoid getting infected. rest stuff parroted antivaxxers believe germ theory. Nobody cares children age /s I'm sure probably varies area area like think anti vaxxers vocal minority sometimes overestimate them. mean looking stats vaccine rates amongst kids age 24 months old around 90% mmr [vaccine around 50% kids 6 months 17 years old get annual flu [vaccine bad consider many people view flu relatively low risk thus see annual flu shot important. Gibraltar going back normal adult population vaccinated one dose. politicians need get messaging there!! Gibraltar said get adult population vaccinated go back normal 90% signed get it. 90% gotten first dose open, mask mandates distancing. hopeful messaging like crappy leaders? funny. met BMI requirement .1. 

I scheduled shot went in, even though met qualification, felt like using loophole jumping line. 

The whole time felt like going get scale tape measure, didn’t even care ask. could closer 100% effective 99% really large numbers. case, accurate thing say 100% effective. whatever reason refuse knocked 

Something law side effects 

I’m gonna wait needle version Username checks What's accuracy rate one? Ramasamy et al (an AZ paper lancet) actually mentions negative correlation. also well known phenomenon also reason Gamaleya Institute (Sputnik V developer) opted two different vectors. whim. “fuck trials”?  Damn EU sinking ship.

Good thing UK got time. Hello,

I’m allergic aspirin. vaccine take? 13% rise massive 40% + drop much less significant numbers Bye Felicia started trials months back moving right along Depends close infected person long. Also vaccine works, even test positive fine. would think would okay stab knife recipient survived first hit.

Maybe flawed logic though. is, unfortunately totalitarian regime. know block want see posts. someone took Pfizer, get vaccine shots, like J&amp;J/Moderna gain protection new covid-19 variants? Yeah get that. feel like last year Trump’s age big deal all, yet it’s daily thing Biden year.

Again, guess that’s best people pick for. wife covid early son 2.5 time even get sniffle. However, pfizer vaccine approved age group I'd interested giving him. think okay icky couple days vs chance he'd get covid get again. find absolutely abhorrent Germany fucked countries botched vaccine plan (Germany far main controller EU Von Der Leyen ex German minister) they're going save Russian vaccines Europe burns think might time, hoping they'll go! people accusing AZ elderly people trials, yet trial Pfizer running 2,000 people half got placebo? 

Pretty bold statement doubting results. interesting see lapped positively comparison. 

One could argue ""not enough data"" could rejected reasons countries refused approve AZ elderly. method actors gain lot weight get shot fast afterwards. I’m sure it’s happened schools NYC areas hit hard virus. areas too. people traced patient zero thousands cases, 70% positives don’t infect anyone.  
But mild cases likely didn’t really high viral load families didn’t catch it. point, don’t get vaccine accept risk going public unvaccinated unmasked. want us right now.

If die, then... that’s that.

It really sucks can’t get vaccines medical reasons though. Top quality proof. questions:

When updates current vaccines target new variants start get rolled out?

The virus seems independently evolved similar mutations across world make fit infect humans. think virus reach stable form always adjust vaccines forever? indication level population groups require booster jab? roughly initial rollout? EU still getting contracted expected receive 120 million doses end March AstraZeneca alone...  Virginia

The law exception written state emergencies. scenario considered, law rescinded. 

The exception health reasons bit onerous. I'd happy wear mask get runny nose bit congestion. would willing get signed affidavit medical professional able wear mask feeling bit off. though would pretty much whole new virus Cells antibodies work right? ...so don’t post things make uncomfortable social media? Would fantastic kids get vaxxed summer... Emergency Use Authorization turns full FDA approval adults next couple months good number anti-vax folks going vastly different situation though. Employers, schools, colleges, etc. able require it, least entertainment venues, sporting events, airlines, etc., many will. help scoop lot folks take otherwise, would guess. add up. Let's say school 2000 pupils. That's 4000 parents. Minus already died (statistically likely)

Let's say EVERY SINGLE parent infected, 20 dead would IFR 0.5%

EDIT: Ok, let's assume 50% children sibling school would affect percentages number pupils lost parent - that's 15 dead parents. Still really adding unless EVERY parent infected average age parents quite high.  concur. article nothing virtue-signaling drivel. poorly written mishmash ""body positivity"" ""look me, I'm concerned cutting line."" experts never stated become healthier order better outcome contracted virus.

Please explain think US delayed second dose like UK done.

Thank you.
I don’t know it’s allowed ask one question. not, pick one think important even call vaccinated mega site. basically spot used kind store size medium grocery store empty taken local hospital chain exclusively vaccination center. like stadium huge venue anything.  Good morning beautiful people! Lets kick Rona ass today! reference demonstrates anti-vector Ig explanation suboptimal efficiency observed AZ product? add J&amp;J Novavax next couple months Winnipeg sports fans building beer snakes getting drunk rum hut summer. already know vaccine works adults. vaccinated teens high levels neutralizing antibodies. saw statistically significant difference rate illness control group. 

The odds outcome due random chance minuscule next evidence vaccine produces immune response slightly younger populations already proven work for. Hey long Naruto gets shots Thanks, taking community feedback questions post? 

Ideally would nice safe guards ensure happen again. envision future UKs vaccine rollout terms successes challenges? ensure successes overcome challenges? so? touchy subject. over-weight friend posted social media received vaccine comments filled comments like ""how get shot?!?!"". hard pill swallow say ""because I'm fat"". I'm 12 days post AZ vaccine, still weird back head headache, severe way. MHRA recommended talking GP headaches persist past 4 days. almost impossible talk GP short notice. 

Given worry surrounding AZ vaccine, thought drive set clinics hospitals people vaccinatedd walk get blood tested? improvement current situation, good news. better recent stories EU getting doses contracted receive, good news. believe Germany picked wrong strategy, world would've benefitted Germany could go back normal earlier, option Brexit. phobia good enough reason get it. pass get shots made get one.  planning reach minorities country taking vaccine much? Interestingly, read vaccines given local stores, mega sites. Everyone I’ve seen who’s posted getting vaccinated mega site. don’t know anyone got pharmacy. issue resolved internally (the original mod team) control sub again. making short statement sometime later today clear things up. far allow export vaccines (unlike US

The Biden admin said last month they're banning exports per se, requiring vaccine makers fulfill contractual obligations US shipping vaccines overseas. Banning exports bit tricky anyways since vaccines usually made multiple countries (think EU AZ vaccines US supply chain, instance). honestly, know EU take similar stance start. &amp;#x200B;

Hello,

Are aware actual administration distribution category? question pertains gets vaccine. Ancedotally, every single person know clinically vulnerable higher risk category given Pzifer, course Jan-Early March. period, everybody know carer BOOk online (rather GP sending you) given AstraZeneca. coincidence? probably dumb question don’t know enough trials. ages 3- 5? assume? first dose Pfizer 23 March spare; initially logged AZ late day switched Pfizer simultaneous second dose clinic use open vial. 

I understand first dose Pfizer point time relatively rare adult population I’m concerned availability second dose. many first doses Pfizer issued last two weeks say, 16-17yo CEV/carers support clinics second doses Pfizer May/June?

The local centre won’t/can’t book appointment second isn’t providing reassurances, said wait 10 weeks! apt analogy would be:

I spent 3 months googling best gas prices along route well arranging carpool friends. left garage, find first gas stations premium. It’s 300 million + 107 already delivered. close 500 million June. estimate 80% usage doses (20% spillage, shelf, transit etc) get 60% EU adults fully vaccinated end Q2. bad number per se, especially deliveries increase even Q3. sincerely warms heart! would imagine fact it’s effective isn’t surprise. testing figure best dosage smaller (sometimes) bodies? Contact tracing works wonders manageable levels community transmission. NZ proof this. Every outbreak far successfully shut rapid contact tracing isolation. ""we taking great pride killing citizens"" heard JCVI recommended vaccinating households immunocompromised individuals. idea if/when might start? Sorry downer, group people anti-vax also likely children. hope stigma starts die down, state live going extremely hard time getting anywhere near 70% vaccines alone. Sadly lot people going get Covid use get herd immunity. Yeah foods drinks taste me. Thus far, sounds like maybe experience closer dad's, maybe. I'll try chill much can. really think obsessing helping things. 95 percent effectiveness severe symptoms, contracting virus. They’re studies too. 4 yr old signed vaccine trials. haven’t started yet, nearest spot 3 hour drive away, we’ll make drive she’s chosen participate curiosity im asking - negate benefits vaccine? Im gonna live life good know things.

Imagine asking question getting downvoted lmfao. That's January/early February question. know vaccines effective variants too. wrong. Let`s check back one year correct idea is. placebo ""effective,"" say?

Lol Sounds right. know nursing home worker lot coworkers take it. boggles mind lost half resident population past year, they've worked many challenges seen staff get fired following protocols bringing in. ""muh side affects"" mobile? Oh do, yeah tracking fear ...

Do live country cctv, police force alphabet agencies? do, yeah invasion privacy fear ...

Do live country member FVEY/nine eyes/SSEUR? do, yeah fears ... emergency use authorization (EUA) route FDA is, short, way still get “approval” without dealing red tape front. red tape reason, therefore warrant EUA situation critical - like global pandemic, example.

The normal route involves lot red tape, bureaucracy, paperwork etc. Lots lots paperwork! Rest assured level review data, safety, relevant study findings reviewed part EUA! still much paperwork review involved, hence takes weeks submit EUA application weeks FDA review providing approval.

All say EUA something fear, think “why vaccine formally FDA approved, EUA?” EUA option reserved extreme situations EUA process used right exactly way intended. “formal” FDA approval follow paperwork done - given months since EUA approval Dec 2020, see EUA option, without would still waiting right able get anyone vaccinated! see point. He’s kept sane last year. Nah 5 year old definitely still terrible. states perused? DC area battle get appointments family PA experience.

You mentioned penicillin, opened door antibiotics common drugs don’t even think save lives. 

mRNA vaccines treatment revolutionize medical field. They’ve already used, extent, experimental cancer research. vaccine could lead “cure” cancer eventually. could also lead vaccines viruses never resources research before. 

A lot medical advances held back lack funding. one researching cure common cold viruses isn’t money research there’s way find it. However, research modifying vaccine tech fight *all* corona viruses, prevent us another pandemic future, well fighting viruses responsible common cold, SARS, MERS. would incredible! 

So vaccine greatest medical advancement time? Probably yet, potential be. It’s truly exciting thing part of. got first Pfizer shot Monday couldn’t happier. variants? Yeah long take mutates much? Probably long time get infections control. good thing variant disease inherently less deadly, although could transmissible put 🙂 actually 2.5% chance. confidence interval 2 sided, range beyond true value could lower, higher, get 2.5% chance below. (In case course can't get higher 100%) second two going stage much worse whatever people consider terrible twos. 2 breeze compared 3, 3-year-old girl boss level compared boy....in experience, least. Bold assume still friends city past year people likely spread COVID often likely received vaccine (such people 20's). would need take account. 

Also, would take account fact vaccination numbers lag like infection numbers (it takes time get sick, get tested, get test results, reported). would need adjust that. example, lots people getting COVID march actually got February. Anyone getting COVID yesterday, would April statistics, vaccinations yesterday would count yesterday. Everytime took kid mall playground got sick. Every. Single. Time. blame government honestly. expect media push fear drive ad revenue public health experts supposed different. Instead play fast loose truth try trick people behaving certain ways. lot regular people generally try correct believing complete nonsense. whole country locked down?  holy fuck, never reason scared first place unless autoimmune disorder 100 y/o 600 lbs. fact govt use fear mongering tactics like actually works confirms american dream circling drain. true. hope least. Thank you, russia Rita Wilson's antibodies natural infection lasted 11 months tested monthly. take fact lasts 6 months. also think there's way could possibly know long vaccines last think anyone long lost antibodies yet. interested study comparing natural vs vaccine immunity.

Regardless, would *amazing* vaccine lasted years. 18-22 group probably worst, general agree you. go Mac route: people freaking vaccine passport told shouldn’t care they’re ones risk don’t get shot? Call doctor go state’s FAQ page. question Reddit. 95% interval cut ends, 2.5% chance worse 77%. father days Pfizer doses. Went away day 2. sure caused psychosomatic.

We’ve original vaccine 4 months fraction first world countries somewhat vaccinated.

Fauci access better data effects virus kids. Pfizer appears give even asymptomatic immunity 90% cases, spread cut (look also Israel Rt 0.53)

Further vaccinated folks US quarantine test show symptoms. 

I think really problem unvaccinated population, yet big there’s clear push promoting certain vaccines demoting vaccines. isnt even controversial statement lol. say ""it's political"", what's concrete thing trying say? politicians doing... what? something wrong institutions regulate vaccine safety? medical well guess could hormones? affected people pre menopausal women. could also connection birth control since thats population takes pill, already increases risk thrombosis. quote this. situation drastically improve upcoming weeks months. still realistic end June Germans received first dose.

Excellent point trump caused pandemic much worse, lets keep politics this. Great comment, fully agree.

I shocked though many people meet completely unaware make mask fit face. publicity made tv etc Europe least, adjust masks. Many people see even know top band adjusted around nose. teach everyone know personally cause everyone know met used wrong.

Wondering many lives could saved public properly made aware this. brief. Hang Wish movie theaters always 50% max. aren’t paranoid media hype. risk complications blood clots tiny. get vaccine can. Even right state German dissatisfaction, mean expectations unreasonably high. Germany well early pandemic; fair say vaccine roll-out best middling. 

That's like FC Bayern München winning league: people would accept normal, one laughing VfB Stuttgart ninth place; people would commenting Bayern position. It’s remotely excuse. Pandemic. Deadly virus. Desperately trying restore society somewhat kind functioning state before.

From headline - Germany done well stepped help countries. don’t know anyone would consider Germany laughing stock. know could done lot better.

Of course could. mean, couldn't, except New Zealand something? population wise, also receive another vaccine, another person receive AZ sure you’re trying school verified specialist lol Especially stockpile 2nd shot problem. really needed anymore, especially BioNTech's shipments super reliable increasing constantly. use everything immediately take 2nd shot future shipment. know gross question know, lol. got first dose past Monday asked beforehand diarrhea (cha cha cha, diarrhea cha cha cha, diarrhea cha cha cha) last 14 days. lied said no, even though last week something ate (it may Taco Bell). vaccine still work me? guess asked diarrhea meant diarrhea result sick flu something like something ate, lol. Chile vaccinated UK cases still rising lot. Also horrible results Sinopharm Seychelles, 64% population received first dose 34% second dose, yet active cases recently peaked. old data? think you’re underestimating what’s play Germany. 
Also fact German people unhappy governments response telling - people know could done lot better. yes, mitigate AZ vaccine choice. I'll try, tho there's definitely lot going on, might miss something out.

How work? essentially solution chimpanzee cold viruses ability replicate replaced ability create coronavirus spike proteins, body generates immune response against. chimpanzee virus harmless humans can't spread - used way smuggle spike protein generation cells.

Does work? Yes - depending study interval doses, efficacy (Testing COVID infection), (Both testing symptomatic COVID). studies vaccine 100% effective preventing hospitalistion death. IRL 100% suggest effective regard.

Is safe? That's slightly complex question. safe *enough* AZ able pull three separate trials without death rare type clot seems cause, safe *enough* MHRA EMA seem happy it. mention seem cause elevated rates 'blood clots' general, [one rarer serious (CSVT). whatever reason *seems* common Norway, Denmark, Germany UK India, major users vaccine. speculate clue.

 yesterday Germany reported [31 CSVT among zeneca'd population, either [2.6 [3.8 (think 2.6 mn sure). works incidence rate somewhere 1 84000 1 123000. 31 cases CSVT, 9 resulted deaths, odds (in Germany) getting CSVT dying AZ vaccine 1 290000 1 420000.

I'm wanting compare risk activities context, quite difficult, since getting vaccine one-time (ok, two-time) event, feels statistically shoddy compare lifetime risks events. Anyway:


Event | (Lifetime) chance killed by
---|---
Car crash| 1 106
Falling stairs| 1 1657
Drowning swimming pool| 1 5573
Plane Crash | 1 11175
Dog attack | 1 118776
Struck lightning | 1 180746
CSVT caused Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca | 1 290000 - 1 420000
(Data taken decision rests obviously, I'd take odds. I'd certainly take AZ vaccine, although young UK probably happen June July. say, risk willing tolerate you. torrential rain causing wide spread flooding sharks streets  mean, discussed pretty widely press. conspiracy, exactly well hidden Especially shockingly small effect cases Seychelles, 64% population vaccinated (but 34% received second dose), yet they're still dealing large outbreak. implies EU whole, individual members states including EU investments (important distinction two investment flows) probably tops US investment large margin. Yup. comprehensive lockdown fixed it, importantly including schools.

Reopening gradually happening, starting staged reopening schools, Rt drifting back towards 1, reopening may need paused continues. Vaccinations around 10%/5% first/second shot - proceeding slowly, accelerating next months. mean Germany follow lead US ban exports vaccines vaccine ingredients.

Just guess though. seems little conspiracy-theory-ish honestly 60% stockpile fine: 50% second shot rest fridges vaccination centers. Oh know loving crowd season last year. probably think baseball fans forgotten. soon rude awakening. Sorry, intending obscure.

My main point current mRNA vaccines focused proteins virus (which population genetic composites) potentially resistant selection genes express mRNA controls for. Mate incidence rate sickness among population around 1/1000 normal life. 1/62k like way above. That's true, still seems strage nothing happens UK Germany Canada find issues AZ...  could case DNA mutations like someone suggested. Maybe problems even linked vaccine UK (just guessing). think usually right trust experts, there's much political maneuvering Europe regarding AZ vaccine trust objective it. 

Most scare hyped EU governments punish AZ fulfillment issues EU, indirectly Britain fucking procurement process like EU did. UK, NHS contact letting know book appointment, need sign beforehand.

Of course need book appointment yourself, think there's way that. best way fight fire put out: Scientist Definitely [Officials added Germany's Paul Ehrlich Institute reported VIPIT incidence rate one 100,000, **with mortality rate 40 per cent,** although research needed risk reduced treated early

Even kinda happy im line wait beta end taking these... sometimes beeing first line good. Title needs word “slightly” inserted word new study United Kingdom found adults living children appear slightly increased risk getting COVID-19 compared adults live kids. don’t know word ”politics” means, what? Nothing described anything HIPPA science becoming pretty confident vaccine absolutely slashes pieces odds actually hurting anyone though fully immunized.  fully vaccinated, 90+% less likely become infected covid first place. covid, looking like 95% less likely transmit anyone else. 

I'm thinking logically. many areas country, already pretty unlikely encounter case covid (the areas country medium decent sitting around 10-15 new cases per 100k per day). given person run like thousand-to-one chance currently covid. unluckily encounter one, around case long enough would catch it; obviously catch covid every single time encounter case. fully vaccinated, there's 90% chance gonna catch it. run bunch thousand-to-one odds infected first place. infected, vaccine cuts odds transmission 95%. lots people also already vaccinated, basically can't catch you. somehow events occur manage infect someone, there's obviously still huge chance they're asymptomatic unharmed anyway, whole time.

At point longer makes sense continue restricting life infinitesimal odds actually hurting somebody. someone lives state that's currently well 10 cases per 100k per day fully immunized 3 weeks' time, I'm going start behaving lot normally. I've followed restrictions religiously since last March. I'm wearing mask everywhere today even required. I'm done I'm immunized, time situation deteriorates state changes calculation. mystery, blood issue happens time. vaccine pop eventually get people some, even dies heart attack, car crash following days. likely clots aren’t connected vaccine supposed connection confirmation bias people looking Oh you’re one posters. Bye then. plant FDA certified. guess Brazil’s drug regulators lower tolerance FDA. Krishna Ella also said Hyderabad largest FDA approved vaccine shit zero people die suffer organ damage we're going Done Covid-19 Variants relax take damn medicine German here. planning really quite bad, much bureaucracy little flexibility. actually quite large stockpile unused doses sitting around Germany. know typically like call primary sources they’re good thing use. “Trump didn’t plan” disproved pretty damn fast Trump publishing document plan. 

This quote seems relevant. pretend mind could changed anything did. many doctors Yemen begin with?

What kind doctor would still there? Old article. proper trial since run U.S. good results. Prevents death severe covid, 76% efficacy. reason think would long term damage. me, I've wearing double surgical level 3 masks since last March, plus face shield. work dental office put perspective. Even potential Corona patient month, windows open. windows still remain open ventilation til day. 

Scary times, made ok. go out, still wear double mask. (I use wear face shield outside well. Even beach.) 

Bottomline, trouble breathing two level 3 masks year now. plan stopping Corona squashed. also N95s stock, prefer surgical string breathing comfort. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

Sounds like obsessed getting vaccine faster people. We're going get within next months, maybe chill stop trying ""first"".

You're advocating punish people like them. advocating create two-tier society people hesitant get vaccine formally approved FDA. People like authoritarian governments come be. advocate shit.

You've caught bad drunken hour. I'll best. actually made error previous statement. said vaccinated person 900% less likely infected, noy 1000%. Efficacy relative risk. Imagine group 1,000 unvaccinated people 1,000 vaccinated people. time 200 unvaccinated people infected 20 vaccinated people infected, efficacy vaccine (200-20)/200=0.9=90%. notice ten times many unvaccinated people infected, means vaccinated person (10-1)*100%=900% less likely infected. reference, vaccinated person 100% less likely infected, 2 times less likely infected vaccine would 50% efficacy people really fucking sick restrictions want excuse get out. Actually terms political groups it’s like 30/40/30 independents don’t talk much lol. comment obviously taken context. Unless truly believe morbidly obese, vitamin deficient, sedentary person great immune system.

And look up, vitamin deficiency inpairs immune response. Biggest eye roll ever... unvaccinated people, potential carriers. longer virus lives likely mutant strains develop deadly. said, also bad narrative. every Florida, there's Arizona Mississippi (0.27%, 0.31%). 

Yeah good points keep mind. problem. like idea punish people getting vaccinated force get one. cases down, hospitals overwhelmed, everyone wants vaccine got one, personally care less whatever last 20% wants do. anyone's problem theirs. l rate general population (unvaccinated)?  That's number one victory royale I've ever seen one also true women regular flu vaccine. sure is, women higher risk generally. Biden somewhere drooling right quit calling Biden plan. Call pelvis plan something u done Meijer? signed one immediately scheduled week later. Lmao must fat ass unhealthy 20 year olds.

Nothing life zero risk. stadium capacities? correct reason we're choosing communist-sort-of-way gets get vaccinated. go party people 20s 30s supposed so? go TV say go back normal vaccination, possibly expect take seriously?

This safety issue, one fairness social expectations. almost careful previously low-risk people vaccinated, still make *little* easier vaccines open up. Lmao, think UK changing figures... Wtf. thing UK interested saving lives getting lives. They've barely got involved tit tat AZ vaccine assure citizens safe. Distributed. ever proven asymptomatic cases **could** spread thing? remember huge unknown last spring don’t know ever got definitive answer. hope appointment goes fast! 

Never went cabaloosas. typical outting P&amp;Gs happy hour McGillicuddy's wing night. Absolutely, reintroduce measures really concerned.

It's like college students hack together websites scrape notify appointments opened up.

It's like hoards young healthy people lying medical conditions skip line.

Yeah totally control. puts 80% tomorrow. Woohoo! Damn it. Going think another excuse avoid socializing people don’t want to. I’m predicting Easter might bring slight rise cases that, we’ll three months holidays, numbers begin go down, vaccine available general public May, things likely significantly safer July 4th. still rounding error. latter. good point though. Pfizer also causes blood clots noone says anything big pharma making $60+ dose let happen. US, state I’m in, you’re high risk group (asthma, smoker, compromised immune system, heart disease, etc.) get vaccine NOW, matter age. 
I got first dose Pfizer vaccine yesterday.  
Are really making wait June July??  Well /r/coronavirus sub so... odds gave Covid?

In theory well 10%, assuming [you 90% [per cumulative incidence curve] [75%+ lower viral load CT score was. risks rival getting pregnant getting abortion good question... risk higher birth controlz differenc rid vaccine save lives others around you, birth control backup plan condoms break.

“People aren’t corona-deniers, don’t understand constant shilly-shallying,” says Dirk Neubauer, mayor small town Augustusburg eastern Germany. federal regional governments constantly blaming policy failures, “but ordinary people don’t care who’s fault — want system work”.

Part anger ascribed shutdown fatigue: shops, restaurants, theatres gyms closed since November, rapid spread highly infectious B.1.1.7 variant first discovered UK stymied hopes restrictions might soon lifted. Jens Spahn, health minister, warned last week situation doesn’t improve, Germany’s health system might reach “breaking point” next month intensive care units fill Covid-19 patients.

Meanwhile vaccinations progressing slowly offer much silver lining. Germans incredulous received jab three months vaccine developed German start-up, BioNTech, became first world receive approval.

“A German company invented vaccine, given €375m German government funding we’re last ones get it,” says Bockhahn, official Rostock.

He describes anxious wait supplies BioNTech, Moderna AstraZeneca vaccines, proven erratic subject delays. “We’re like junkies desperate next fix,” says.

Germans mostly blame EU shortage doses: European Commission stands accused ordering little vaccine, late. also fail understand authorities Germany slow administer doses have. around 262,000 people received jab Monday, according Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s main public health authority — peak 306,000 March 12.

Some critics say authorities far strict eligible shot. “It’s German phenomenon — idea people shouldn’t vaccinated it’s turn,” says Ulrich Weigeldt, head German Association General Practitioners. “The message people get jab, better society.”

But it’s matter excessive caution. Inoculations slow snail’s pace Sundays — perhaps unsurprising country still takes day rest seriously still extraordinary considering gravity pandemic. What’s more, number states announced close vaccine centres Easter break.

The inoculation campaign exposed system government slow and, times, overly bureaucratic. particularly case appointments jabs: booking websites routinely crash hotlines badly understaffed. “It took five days calling get slot,” says Erika Olias, 85-year-old Rostock resident finally got first dose last week.

It killed much decade ALTHOUGH social distancing, masks, shutdowns, lockdowns place!

But still, 1 million still unlikely  fact lot high numbers hospitalizations caused overweight obese.

Yes, disappointing, actually surprising followed news. 3 much terrible 2, one talk it? Bill Maher anti-vaxxer.

And weird would choose give credit ""be healthy"" message every single doctor researcher saying thing decades. dogmatic enough think 'being healthy' means ever get sick, that's Maher's elite delusion (""I gotten sick, therefor live like get sick either!"") sorry, risk?

CDC came convincing study Monday essentially proving vaccinated individuals act major source transmission? say 55 female comunity low infectiion rate might reasonable choice - rational decision, still ok.

Its ok decide dont want vaccinated - want epidemic stop, requires people vaccinated - see part effort. Gotta love positive news spun negatively. Current statewide 7 day averages 900 cases 100 new hospital admissions. Oh ok, thought saying didn’t want AstraZeneca, bad great news. first shot scheduled second dose next week. hope daughter get shot sometime summer school starts. We're Denver spot struggle badly parts state. anyone give valid explanation healthy teens would need/ get this? much robust system routine healthcare (regular checkups) savings would offer national level would ridiculous. 1100 people active arm. headlines labeled ""clickbait"" reason.  

The primary goal educate, platform Taboola advertise get many people view ads. That’s 12 percentage point difference. It’s pretty big.

Ok, question this.

They're starting paperwork EUA next weeks. previous EUAs example, takes week two authorize. means mid-May. wait August vaccinate 12-15 year olds?

I know says ""before start next school year"", seems like saying ""early summer"". Anyone know why? wonder fact Curevac's CEO suffered stroke last March impacted all. Why? AstraZeneca vaccine safe, blood clots rare, 1 like 100,000. Yeah, situations change claiming one side is/was always better worse mindless tribalism. Theyre adding count friday!! Lets goooooo!!!!! -eat- paperwork includes loads. give non-exhaustive overview:

**Before trial** study design, available data toxicology/animal studies/clinical trials countries, risk-benefit analysis basically anything ""what happens participant harmed trial?"" scrutinised needs planned well needs make sense. always queries things clarified changed even starting.

**During trial** may inspections conducted FDA regulatory authority countries trial run. Due high profile Covid vaccine trials, seen lots inspections.

**After trial** immense load data submitted. Recorded results trials also lots chemical analysis drug stability, upscaled manufacturing procedures whatnot. whole ""can ensure vaccine doses clean, safe stuff?"" Aspect really, really trivial also contributes approvals normally talking long. new point though. point, guideline changed 'wear mask vaccinated'.

Isn't risk severe illness/death extremely low amongst teens/children? top that, cases dropping thanks adults getting vaccinated.

Seems like guidelines change, changed past. That’s different talk, pretty much agree with. Sadly that’s late. Wow. insane, baseless assumptions. crawled butt Sorry able feel valued worthy respect heavier

Can point said even implied ""on"" anyone change body hated yours

Of course not. ""on"" every unhealthy person change lifestyle *they healthier* (and probably happier).

And say I'm high horse. need take look mirror. Yes? peer reviewed study. literally EMA countless health agencies said opposite, type blood clots people got exceptionally rare well average. sure ""luck"" US invested literally every possible vaccine. essentially guaranteed US would get vaccines, though tradeoff course price tag. think *think* tricky here, not: probability we'd calculate would based prior probability infection occurring.

The reason everyone applies logic OP, one gets vaccinated vaccine fear mongering, there's something like 8 10 chance they'll eventually get COVID (herd immunity effectively stops spread around 80%).

So actual probability is: chance OP dies given COVID? go sample 20-39 year olds COVID. 

None data perfect, tonne factors consider (like known long term effects COVID infection risk infection poses others etc.), end day combined risks COVID infection higher blood clot we're even certain attributed Astrazeneca vaccine.

But hey, downvote away, anti-intellectualism fad around world seems. governor praised media, less thought put making good decisions. Alright. 70-80% effectiveness huge deal major tool goes toolbox. Could imagine essentially able wave wand identify 70-80% currently active cases? adult trial 25% 65+ really isn’t applicable lower end all. Young adults much likely see 100% protection end spectrum. 70% 16+ get vaccine, 56% total population.

If 80% 16+ get it, like 64%.

Very unlikely without kids getting vaccine.

BUT likely need get vaccine kids affects vaccine crush covid. mean, give one shot vax teens? little confused. Pls help There's way actually 100% efficacy, need larger pool.  real?! shouldn’t print vaccine 100%. don’t even need read article know false. first Moderna Monday.

I unsure right call, remove troll. understand posting annoy us, reading post, able answer others reading questions many have.  end, pointless argue him... guess better, keep group healthy without people, then.. alike post. arguing work, well, .01% efficacy number needs compared control group. need sort idea many people would statistically likely infected determine efficacy, otherwise could make argument 100 people ones exposed virus vaccine 0% effective (not true, example)

So vaccine work based data have, numbers show efficacy Germany handle first waves pretty well? That's idea have. True, handling vaccine could better, they're still well total numbers deaths.

I dont know solution - maybe subsidised private healthcare something? think 0 covid pipe dream?

Even covid vanished face Earth overnight, false positives means zero cases mathematically impossible.

Not mention, realistically, never going zero cases anything. There's still cases medieval black plague around world ffs.

Just try hypochondriac  I'm optimistic vaccine production continue ramp up, US least, time single vaccine children approved, supply problem dramatically improved, entirely solved

However world absolutely needs much vaccines, including vaccines kids. former moderator sub tagged ""Verified Specialist - BSc"" always made chuckle. - COVID-19 primary contributing cause 377,883 deaths United States last year, particularly high toll among elderly, according government report released Wednesday. Provisional estimates CDC, published last month, showed life expectancy U.S. fell year first half 2020 - biggest decline since World War 2 - stood lowest levels since 2006. Gourevitch, involved research, said direct effect COVID-19 mortality also compounded pandemic’s impact jobs economic conditions, disproportionately affecting minority communities hardest hit virus. current rate, 90% US citzens vaccinated Christmas, 70% Halloween. herd immunity rate bit range. 50% vaccinated August, believe around get better. still moving goalposts. arguing ""two weeks flatten curve"" bad goal first place; goal ""two weeks, plus knows much based case levels.""

Wisconsin well-functioning democracy. gerrymandered hell difference statewide election results district-level election results substantial it. Agree wasn’t great PR move totally irrelevant anyone understanding trials work. This. 'natural' incidence cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) approximately 1 66000 people per year. Let's say events occurred timespan two three months. multiply frequency five, give us expected incidence per year, hypothesize increase risk, however absolute terms relative risk (when compared benefit getting vaccinated) still low. 

Why say that? last year, 160 people per 100,000 USA died result merely existing, unvaccinated.  UK number higher (190), Italy 180, take three countries.

The incidence CVST would give approximately 7 8 cases every 100,000 people vaccinated. Meanwhile, would saving 152 (USA) / 182 (UK) / 172 (Italy) lives every 100,000 people vaccinated countries.

Do let 152 / 182 / 172 people die prevent 7 8 cases CVST?

Of course, ideal world, vaccines would side effects, however real world, never completely true, also risk immune protection. Also, yes alternative vaccines, vaccinating versus using AstraZeneca vaccine clearly going save (about 20 times) lives vaccinating not.

It's tough subject discuss enough bombard people data (tempting though is). open communication pharmaceutical companies, health systems public risk benefit profiles (e.g. safe mean? actually 'safe' get vaccinated?) worked thing going build people's trust measures like vaccination programs long term

Edit: source CVST incidence: equivalent living city tapped shoulder literally every day told ""Look ways crossing street!"". good know accelerating growth vaccination progress. lot pride American tech thread whatever means given actual origins many vaccines active strictly US, though US bid highly I've seen millions doses. hit nail head deaths numbers. US (specifically republicans) got lot people killed need die. ITT: People getting downvoted saying quiet part loud.

If want good idea quality diet, look caloric intake, sodium intake well. lot people don’t realize they’re loading way much sodium along daily 3,000 calories simple carbs cholesterol.

It’s eating disorder; were, could eat gigantic piles salad satiate addiction *food*. It’s addiction delicious, unhealthy foods, impulsive behavior. We, Americans, horrible control impulses.

It also doesn’t help 1,200 calorie box Mac cheese “eat love god matters world” packaging costs tomatoes. Plus lot people saying live country perfect air quality 1 person per square mile. 100 sounds like lot know 1.2 million people fully vaccinated. headline without 1.2 million context bit misleading.  Hope mentally prepared vaccine resistant variants inevitably negate slow vaccine roll every screen speaker shout covid spending acting normal again.

annual covid shots rest lives that's first world countries. rest world anti-vaxxers circulate covid forever average lifespan drops 65

Masks, social distancing, remote learning, wfh new normal. Accept reality adapt mental physical well being.  part people failed realize. exactly right. value, X, people would comfortable existing normally. masks/lockdowns/etc caused curve flatten point choice either keep flatting release brake. places released brake, number went whatever magic number, another choice, keep plowing ahead hit brake again. choose one chose other, end goalposts moving car moving around track Could another example under-exposure? instance beginning pandemic believed youths virtually impervious naturally. Now, 0-19 year olds make majority new infections many sectors world. possible vaccinated teens still forced socially distance better adults due schools closed independent transportation? /u/-RustinCohle- right. silence us telling truth. Much ado flu guess seem like fear mongering people don’t understand context situation. one work human excrement either, decide take job sewage treatment plant, will.

EUA mean vaccine unsafe. People choose work LTC facilities. absolutely requirement job safeguard life. refuse, terminated. Wait, responsible non fear mongering headline? Wtf this? People said last month too. vaccines always going another month away, like lockdown extended four weeks. 

I’ll believe happens I’m done bullshit timelines. thats fucked also crystal ball. whole last year wait see things develop. fluid situation multiple variables. notice, state opinion, shared facts current situation oppose original comment. Saying cases trending downward match statistics showing. 

One variables encounter variants mutations. According reports Brazil, P.1 variant originated predominant, people typically associated higher risk (age previous conditions) getting sick. variant shown infectious escape immunity thanks E484K mutation. also seems fatal, maybe thats condition Brazil's healthcare system. 

Do think see graphs trend upwards again? Perhaps will. think another wave herd immunity achieved possible. also think possible require several boosters current vaccines keep virus control. Lastly, think possible vaccines fail make meaningful affect virus mutates faster create disperse vaccines. may chasing tails. 

With *possible* outcomes, think foolish disregard CDC warnings. access information, knowledge experience likely have. 

If ready let guard down, thats you, won't. yet. Mask buttercup! :) U.S. could supply us enough entire country 1 week.

I cannot wait. think late April/early May happen. What? wonder kind excuse “It’s flu” crowd come now. “0 covid” used colloquially 0 covid cases, 0 deaths well sure getting vaccinated lol. What's risk someone age group getting dying covid? Nowhere state fact 6 months drop dead date. two years based top Dr.'s subject said likely last ie: Dr Agus. Like said know people personally got twice one around 6 months others closer 7-12 months  Plus, would voted office earliest possible opportunity every single one know it. Blue Red doesnt matter. elections nearing restrictions ease. Positive interpretation: brief moments fun entertainment help keep people motivated keep getting burned out. also promotes ""team"" mindset, also helps keep people burning out.

And clearly busy were. 128,000 hospitalized patients peak, 33,000 now. France government said open schools priority opened since end 1st lockdown last May. Closing schools extended recess possibility tonight (they due close 2 weeks soon Spring break). think second Pfizer shot left feeling like shit day. maybe? wife works pediatrics NYC seeing large increase children testing positive right reason, seeing even winter large increase adults getting COVID. Seemingly end getting discharged pediatrics ED without requiring admission maybe worst spend days hospital mostly treatable fevers, causing peds overcrowding anything, still obviously sucks kids.

At peak March 2020, hospital stacked two beds deep halls dying patients bring refrigerated trucks enough room morgue. second peak winter enough adult patients start sending younger adults mid-20's get seen pediatrics balance load bit, anything like crazy first peak. understanding many hospitalized adults point there's general sense woods recent increases case counts NY tristate area could problematic. Germany still half deaths per 1000 US... much higher Scandinavian peers believe. hate read that. Hope things change better soon Poland. Dude wish Croup anybody. That's morgue, right? guideline say play kids. Yeah decided razor focus example totally separate point post. unvaccinated people, potential carriers. longer virus lives likely mutant strains develop resistant vaccines. Well given US 50|50 diehard political groups, going 18% expected pretty decent.

A test expected get 100% know everything. Also kids age five don’t even need wear masks daycares county would parents make play dates?  trump's attempt herd immunity excuse damn thing Covid wrong well. No. Hospitalizations? That’s data care Jealous! Congratulations, hopefully live little safely :) sure people quick downvote literally didn’t know wasn’t disputing anything uninformed thank letting know. Sometimes anxiety gets way. fucking ghoul. Remember arguments mitigations bad flu years killed 40-80 thousand.

Now 0.13 % Florida's population died covid vs 0.14% californias population mitigations work.  Yes, means probably even need 70%. Enough people natural immunity many countries. Identical, different allocation pool. Fauci lie, spoke based known time. reality is, masks offer you, individual, lot protection, especially they're properly fitted N95 mask. (and he) learned, masks kind help block outgoing droplets. Around April last year learned simply talking breathing takes spread virus, many asymptomatic cases, became necessary wear mask. 

Birx sucked Trump's asshole. sexism, memory. seriously? Identical 1st dose. nah financial market implode take whats left economy it. school. I’ve seen almost zero issues mask wearing amongst elementary school kids. inspiring actually...   I’m clearly referring people got first dose felt sick don’t want go back 2nd. I’m obviously talking people don’t want get whether it’s they’re conspiracy theorist, think it’s like flu, don’t think they’ll get it, don’t think need it. they’re anti-vax. absolutely cold flu season. first time YEARS get cold/flu. Fucking awesome. Also- quite possible, since Florida, didn’t store vaccines correctly injected empty syringes something Floridian like that.  Notice stated experienced death, instead even saying “sorry loss” even acknowledging that, basically went straight “I LOST PEOPLE OTHERS EFF YOU”. Lol. “Thanks showing kind person are.”

Anyways, I’m sorry loss. I’m wearing mask it’s required. people, it’s required I’m get kicked grocery store something trivial. reasoning bothers you...it shouldn’t, point I’ll wearing mask. 

As hypothetical questions, sure. wouldn’t ultimately blame uncle’s death people. anything, I’d blame government’s shitty way handling things.

But irrelevant argument. Feel free blame whomever death mother, that’s grieving process it’s valid. argument wearing masks. argument idea mask-wearers selfless angels, vaccinated people continue vaccines don’t exist (not traveling, going restaurants, etc.) variants CDC director said.  imaging devices already medically approved, new device would need approval/emergency authorization. shortcut could existing design guts removed.

Might good prophylactic treatment nose accidental exposure harder treat entire body unless new device like x-ray table sized transducer hot tub. 2nd dose Phizer vaccine chemically 1st different formula/mixture? don’t data yet. believe mask mandates lifted three weeks ago. job weigh risks virus practicalities potential harms guidelines policies. Children suffered greatly pandemic, science clear COVID smaller risk influenza. adults chance vaccinated, think masking/distancing children personal choice families. didn’t enforce strict regulations past flu seasons, shouldn’t continue small risk presented. point, fully vaccinated elderly family members refuse, fuck them. them. coming number? news yesterday, I'm sure find second source. low transmission rate.  said anything home alone? Mask socialize safely. That's whole point! 20% include single digit percentage folk cannot pay get shot.

The rest probably like inconvenience attempting book, coming back, etc. individuals would probably take shot lines, secondary shot follow up. even threw gift card, really sweeten deal.

By late-May, early-June, we'll looking news articles excess inventory shots, everyone wanted done it. Birx complicit last administration. often lied severity situation last year. changing tune now. there's also millions children 16 can't take That's fine. seem like pretty serious person intended you. agree. want remove vaccine hesitancy, say vaccinated people behave live life COVID. Science seems suggest it. may true 20,000 person music festival, full vaccinated people, percent get infected somehow. wont hospitalized, thats ultimate point. recent reports show low transmissibility vaccinated people pass non-vaccinated. might since average shots day go up! think they’ll Easter spike point? so, severe think it’ll be? fun ‘What everyone dead?’ I’m sure. news articles say “hospitalizations 500%”, could literally mean going 1 person 5 people. It’s deliberately misleading Yeah, weeks change everything - hopefully we'll info contingency plans place soon! That’s young children second highest risk group influenza, lowest risk group Covid. 

Anyone understands statistics far concerned young kids getting flu. Got priorities straight half people England can't hear Hong Kong 97. Nice. see national vaccine passport implemented. Basically buy tickets, scan QR code pass. Done done. I’m incredibly sorry loss. parents lost child 3, painful thing ever gone through. Nearly 40 years later, talk lot re-train accept certain risks loss. individual risk tolerance changed permanently, realized life void risk unachievable. imagine pandemic really hard you, hope find peace coming years. bold assume sense humor lol Ah right, thank - two days me! Anecdotally, seems many restaurants re-hiring people thats good hear.  Neighborhood bars closing city since long COVID. miss living don’t know I’d recognize place moved back! I’m getting vaccine Saturday Texas cvs! That's brilliant - thank advice there. Best health you! Biden Administration set federally supported community centers mobile clinics delivering shots.

As Feb. 3, 130 federally sites operational across country. FEMA deployed 449 staff provide personnel technical assistance additional staff supporting virtually. number states obligations increases, FEMA working alongside federal agencies provide federal support critical staffing, supplies shortfalls help get Americans vaccinated.

The federal government partnered state governments launch community vaccination centers using primarily federal staff support state local governments. FEMA provides resources, operational support federal staffing support establish new centers. 

Federal Funding Accelerate Vaccine Efforts
As Feb. 3, FEMA provided $1.76 billion states, territories tribes expenses related COVID-19 vaccination 100% federal cost share.

These funds cover emergency protective measures include:

Supplies commodities needed safely store administer vaccine.

Transportation support reasonable, necessary security refrigerated trucks support leasing space store and/or administer vaccines, including utilities, maintenance security.
Medical support staff, including onsite infection control measures, personal protective equipment staff, cloth face coverings patients, temperature scanners, physical barriers disinfection facility accordance CDC guidance.
Dissemination public information communication regarding vaccinations.

FEMA supporting COVID-19 vaccine distribution providing reimbursement governments costs associated vaccine distribution administration. Providing funding states, tribes territories Administration priority. request submitted, reviewed validated, FEMA expedite reimbursement eligible emergency work projects ensure resources available support vaccine distribution administration.

The costs purchasing vaccine support kits covered obligations duplicate HHS funding.

Federal Coordination Identify Fill Resource Gaps
FEMA working closely state, local, tribal territorial governments fill gaps local health officials identified. Additionally, emergency managers working closely appropriate health officials.

FEMA released “FEMA COVID-19 Vaccination Planning FAQ,” document help assist governments vaccine distribution efforts reimbursements associated costs. FEMA work U.S. Department Health Human Services federal agencies ensure coordinated approach using Defense Production Act authorities wherever necessary private sector companies increase vaccine supply spur vaccine manufacturing.

**Vaccine Guidance**

FEMA working Ad Council encourage hesitant underrepresented Americans get vaccinated. research-driven public education campaign provides federal, non-profit, medical stakeholders insights communications strategies tailor communications reach diverse audiences. vaccine perfect fix. Everyone continue practice precautions like wearing mask, maintaining physical distance, handwashing hygiene measures public health officials say otherwise.

**New Funding American Rescue Bill:

$47 billion FEMA

$176 billion vaccinations Yes, always wondered risky contagious people masked whenever see public don’t go supermarket i’m broke college student eating ramen. Waiting game taken year away life, refuse let take more, especially i’ve fully vaccinated  feel like we’ll start seeing cases free-fall like Israel around beginning May. every state opened eligibility population it’s gonna free all, delivery amounts increasing every week we’re gonna see vaccine boom. I’m feeling good summer. ill give general say “single” parents widowed unfortunate ultimately decide bring life world nobody else ultimately. better family behind you. things one considered conceiving. Yeah, kids playing playground kids. 

I sacrifice another year peer play critical social development. Congratulations getting vaccinated! Enjoy Krispy Kreme donuts  Fuck 1 percent would perfect dunno, wrong everything. I've mainlining clorox uv bulb shoved ass every night past 6 months go hospital Covid yet! tell driving recklessly impact anyone else, say word whether kids wear masks anymore. Covidfest 2021 Automotive deaths increased last year decreased. drove less, faster, seem maintaining new Fauci obviously hasn’t raised child really, REALLY long time. wish cared iota millions children whose lives decimated lockdowns.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* risk children extraordinarily small. proven time time again. Adults choose vaccinated also minuscule risk. mandate masks social distancing kids flu season harm keeping isolated outweighed risk getting ill. adults get vaccinated, nearing similar risk-level COVID. rare doctors, Israel uptake amongst doctors perhaps highest country, iirc something like 97%. Astra Zeneca J&amp;J go screw wife works daycare. Since last year outbreak within kids families. even wife corona didn’t know week December. teachers/staff wear masks, adults allowed school, clean regularly, certain teachers floaters, certain classes, can’t hang classes, etc. daycare act together would imagine don’t much worry about. Short answer: Yes Yes.


Long Answer: doctor Florida received mRNA vaccine. seen occur mRNA vaccine. likely coincidence. Atthe rate vaccinating, pretty much anything think happens near time someone getting vaccinated. compare rates unvaccinated population. 

As German blood clotting issues, AZ only, different vaccine technology. Furthermore, seen UK used AZ extensively. Cool, thanks replying :)

I'm terribly worried it, curious other's experiences aren’t funny think are. right less concern. However virus chance mutating enough current vaccines don’t work. long significant fraction people it, low level risk new mutation appears population spreads already vaccinated people. course booster shot might help, see train thought, hopefully vaccinated, care am?

Also, seems like cite actual source saying asymptomatic spread real. come ""the experts agree this."" make less risky people, everyone sometimes?

We've rash pedestrians innocent drivers killed recently live people's reckless driving, I'm pointing best analogy talking personal risk.

I eat meat anymore, always liked steak burgers still moo'ing did. 🤪 yet UK find 5 cases casual link 20M shots. Sometimes think dude making things goes. mean? mom died covid. didn’t funeral, much less reception. Everyone make sacrifices, you. EVERYONE ready pandemic over, you. ready something doesn’t make something reality.

And uncle could’ve saved someone wearing mask, would wanted worn one? could save someone else’s uncle, wouldn’t want to? ruin everyone's life? I'll gladly tell kid can't.

I wonder think cancer kids? disabled kids? Somewhere unfortunate souls left out, guess they're still alive mental health social growth population preserved. Oh god.. Even cdc gets messed graphic. data shows 90% efficacy, totally different saying fully vaccinated person 90% less likely infected. 90% efficacy means fully vaccinated person 1,000% (10 times) less likely infected. finally, logical comment. up, people suggesting uk lack reported cases uk bad suppressing cases. much logical Women general make vast majority immune-mediated ITP, probably explains least gender specificity. Trump v Hawaii still upheld principle courts deferring executive branch matters security Glad everything back way was. sub wealth relevant news, especially medic NJ. Thanks, I'll here. think that's square-cube law action. wish effort made put distinction effectiveness preventing death, preventing serious illness preventing testing positive COVID-19. Hairdressers aren’t even contributing this, haven’t open Toronto since November yet cases sky rocketed toronto. would gladly go get hair cut now, it’s almost 5 fucking months since open.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* really feeling like sent supply places worse shape far infections per capita. Meaning hillbilly antivax anti mask counties.

Meanwhile us counties people right thing kept cases count low get shafted idiots thought pandemic hoax interested getting vaccinated anyway. Hi there. mum idea covid, took antibodies test got 560 got 180 BAU/ml threshold 33. definitely positive.

I'm curious levels antibodies vaccinated people, idea take vaccine ( appointment weekend cancel decides so). Thank you! Well, like flu times 10. ""AHA! expected! hiding vaccines vaccine-factory! Nobody could've possibly expected find vaccines here, found anyway, brilliant detectives EU! well truly exposed vaccine makers are! "" There's always plenty misinformation comment sections sub. Sort new controversial like Facebook Twitter. Sorry. got Pfizer watch 6 year old absolutely wreck regularly ways would leave considering trip urgent care probably needing trip. wipes spectacularly ragdolls pile ground, immediately yells ""I'M OKAY!"" gets keeps running. ""I'M OKAY"" since tiny, wife sisters would always immediately call ask okay. common sound we'll hear ""stomp stomp stomp stomp...\*THUD\*...""I'M OKAY!"" stomp stomp stomp...""

Made rubber indeed. directed specifically.

I provide exact number I'd sit plug Bayes theorem. eyeball relative risk ratio though, like said, 6 times higher covid blod clot aztrazeneca vaccine (assuming blood clots even caused vaccine, evidence actually suggest thus far).

Chance either happening low, blood clots even lower. People, would probably die covid, dying vaccine. Look data Norway Germany. much complex overall number. Germany believes women risk makes sense avoid demographics. survey also included open-ended questions parents share stories, large number respondents eager voices heard. Fisher collected 120,000 stories survey.

Apparently plural 120,000 anecdotes data. one thinking all, convey similar results mind. gotta go work I'll update dig back one mind super clear data visualizations powerful natural infection + 1 vaccine dose combination is. There's much data hard Google specific stuff, bad thing all! 125%  kid died getting shot went anti-vax hard. get mad world sounds like crazy person now. People claiming it’s 100% effective hospitalization death even 95% effective infection, clearly true Washington right can’t find information regarding incidence rates means low it’s worth talking them. Part also lack foresight bracing much would since know like fall stiffen up. get caught guard relax understanding severity fall, means bones mostly escape fall. better give break. Yeah, seem like €200,000 big deal national government. People delusional. good thing, that’s literally purpose checks balances. don’t kings, Congress. every time declared health emergency President Governor granted dictatorship democracy would fail. used frustrate kid I’d get cold would last like 2 days *max*. wanted last longer didn’t go school!! I’d thrilled cold lasted 2 days. like 2 weeks now. I’d imagine also wouldn’t enjoy intubated getting traechostomy done like friend hospitalized covid.   second overstocked they'll open up. what? need it. well, i'm LA, never lived there, still love every time visit. different strokes guess ""Despite vaccine""? What?

As last week Brazil less 2% vaccinated. ""everywhere"".

they literally said transferred absorbed air eyes. member reporters air using swimming goggles mask face shield? get fuck outta ignant ass. Looks like close 2.7 million doses administered today, getting close 2.9 million 7 day average think  Covid vaccine efficacy currently studied people weak immune systems (especially organ transplants autoimmune disorders). we’ll know soon. would much prefer wear masks vaccine passport though. view lesser two evils.

WE CHOOSE EITHER THEM. Neither table. Yes US could careful. think US rolled export ton demand. likely split allies aka Canada, JP, SK, EU, Australia, ...etc. think solution well-functioning democracy give elected officials _more_ unanimous power? particular case might good thing give governor power, really point, Supreme Court supposed decide. post amount doses correspond almost 1/4 whole EU population, considering ones yet vaccinated (almost 10% population) benefits coming 1 doses vaccine there. end Q1, vaccines get people quick enough maintain pace supply, EU around 50% people vaccinated end Q2. know countries better, still remarkable result considering want around 65-70% people get vaccine stop spreading virus. US passed 150M doses administered, 6.1M distributed today, 73.5% gotten first dose, hopefully reach 80% milestone! Really seems luck draw. know people worse second shot, others side effects either time. triumphant Agreed. Even beyond county city level restrictions enforcements, also decisions businesses, want sued people getting sick likely continue requiring masks, individuals, many continue wear masks regardless restrictions (just like many wear masks despite restrictions). please link us this? People seem misunderstanding headline... know date is. (although stupid headline tbf)
 
Today end march. basically catch-up ""this EU gotten far"". extra 100 million doses suddenly appearing tomorrow. know reuters trying spin like that. Michigan could descend anarchy change feel lockdowns. Keep pumping vaccines, protect first others second. downvote asked number vaccine surge starting? Anyone find surprising 18/1,100 teens caught it? know it’s small % (1.6) doing? Theyre probably still around, like 400,000,000 monthly active users reddit. agree almost definitely lower 100% liked dichotomy saying something never 100%. wear mask anyone work ill I'm ill, understand others won't. Im doubting want read Thanks! 'breathing' fine, gets winded can't breathe nose, like would head cold, makes sense.

o2 98 mouth breathes normally. Real world data suggests 80% efficiency preventing infection 14 days first dose Pfizer Moderna EU use mainly Pfizer/BioNTech. Second largest order Moderna. Studies UK shows real life protection AstraZeneca similar Pfizer one. 

Any vaccine prevents hospitalization death reduces transmission win absolutely lead normalcy. Unless Curevac unsafe worse efficacy different parameters compared approved vaccines, good tool EU! Got first Moderna shots last week.

I'm 31, spent 8 days ICU back November COVID.

I actually argue pharmacist get shot, ended finally taking argued overweight considered underlying condition. argue get dang shot? Virginia open vaccinations adults, though pharmacies can't even fill appointment slots. reason two kids could get elbow room flights. There's concern it. tracking like tracking aby side effect occurs population seems least plausible. difference placebo vaccine group statistically significant. measured trial one month 2nd dose continued look it. now, millions vaccinated. increased risk something obvious, would come now. 15k people vaccine 4 cases Pfizer 0 placebo 3 Moderna 1 placebo. Neither rates higher confidence interval events expected large population. heard followup nothing followup on. There's one case occurring since person 3 previous episodes vaccine. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine trials, Bell’s Palsy reported 4 vaccine participants. Dose 1 1 month Dose 2, 3 reports Bell’s Palsy vaccine group none placebo group. observed frequency reported event consistent expected background rate general population, suggests causal relationship vaccine cannot made (Pfizer-BioechD-19, 2020). Moderna trials, 3 vaccine recipients 1 placebo recipient reported Anywhere within reasonable drive NJ/NY border became expanded fight residents shots, allocation population effectively far short reality. native English speaker? word ""manipulate"" literally means ""to handle skilled manner"", derived latin ""manus"" means ""hand"" (see also ""manual"", ""manuscript"", ""emancipate"", etc.). literally quote sentence understand native speaker misread it.

As far substance goes, public know whether gain-of-function research (""genetic modification"" sort) done RaTG13 -- pointing article claiming contributing anything. already know people know this. entire point know this.

All link confirming closest known natural-origin virus study since 2013 lab history GoF research happened directly road outbreak. question evidence zoonotic transfer. Can’t reason stupid. I’ve talked couple coworkers won’t get vaccine “I don’t like needles” “I felt crummy flu shot one time.” Like sweetie, guess what’ll make feel even crummier? Full blown organic covid. Finally, good news. right now, it’s really hard get appointment. signed spot meijer january i’m finally getting mine sunday. people go state north get one. symptoms consistent vaccine side effects tested resolve within 72 hours course could covid. isolate meantime. breathing difficulties worsen, ER visit would warranted. 1.55m first doses reported today! Cool post this, mod Vaccines work. believe misinformation. Vaccines protect variants well original strain Coronavirus. parents grandparents vaccine hesitancy, point data! get it! FDA filings show moderna higher incidence side effects. highly unlikely event humankind still exists thousands years people look back events past year like, ""Wait, people went way make sure leaders could protect deadly disease?"" already started using correlates protection. Obviously safety studies. can't think way vaccine work mRNA vaccines do. seems induce decent amount antibodies. Governor never overrode Legislature anything. Governor issued Order - Legislature nothing (multiple times) except complain press sue Judiciary. 

Again, Legislature end Governors Order simple majority vote time. like voted end orders tried put order back place. nothing.

This precedent says emergency 60 days Legislature nothing, entire State nothing. sound better, reasonable, practical, logical? one larger dose. Korematsu seen disgrace modern times, like Dredd Scott Plessy

Also.... got overruled 2018 Trump v. Hawaii Yeah, they've it. fault EU waited long. Spinning supply chains production lines takes considerable time. Complaining, example, lines established months EU's action producing vaccines EU lines unreasonable. number anti science people sub hadls grown exponentially action team.

You eventually delete posts many hours ban users, keep coming back  basic solution government's proposal ban movement principle completely disproportional cannot considered necessary within meaning Constitution,"" said committee chair Antti Rinne (SDP), Marin's predecessor prime minister party problem highlighted possibility interpretation prohibitions, regulations exceptions. virtually impossible people predict forbidden permissible – thus punishable,"" said. mean 15% people still long lasting paralysis weakness. I’m really asking whether it’s serious incidence rates. I’m 21 I’m low risk I’m clearly getting vaccinated. end June 60% adults EU fully vaccinated. Mostly using Biontech moderna. recognizing constitution imperfect like law practicality needs outweigh exact lettering mask reasonable safety people.

This logic used enact almost law politician desires. 

And truly terrifying people realize that. source? inoculation process also involves great deal red tape. Take mobile vaccination teams administered jabs care home residents country start year. “There pharmacist fill syringes, nurse administer shots, doctor explain procedure patients three Red Cross employees paperwork,” says Neubauer, witnessed process old people’s home Augustusburg. “It leaves said attending doctor fill in, stamp sign eight A4 sheets forms patient. second team came give second dose weeks later go home they’d brought wrong forms, says. 

This almost exactly happened wife jab Germany. ludicrous amounts bureaucracy system here. Makes worry myself. kid, almost died sickness 4 times. 4 months disease normally shows symptoms kids, needed lifesaving surgery another.
I wonder effectiveness is, people like probably kind serious immune system problem. lesser even though I'm 19? I'm curious vaccines people received. even split 3? J&amp;J? seem like data vaccines administered available... 100 percent marketing gimmick. 

Pfizer started enrolling October finished late January, 3-4 months full enrollment. Enrollment Moderna 800 point month 3,000 looking for.

If get EUA sometime April, would 6 month turnaround. 2-11 age groups would October EUA timeline. speculation, parents younger kids might hesitant sign up, could longer. Bells Palsey usually resolves within days week. affliction lasts long all. feel health guidance condescension, feel like that's personal problem, reality. Apparently Americans want everybody fall floor praise half million people die. attitude 500,000 dead matter ignoring helps look better vs Europeans reddit. saying vaccine passports would thing huge government overreach. 

People say “oh that’s reaction, it’s 2 weeks”

Vaccine passports considered/implemented make good points. probably shouldn’t used word bribery, incentivization less aggressive way frame it. Numbers? must new reddit. supposed react headline without bothering read article first...and certainly considering context numbers presented. 

How dare you. Great, start giving people actually house driving spread. Glad grandma safe home, numbers going keep going 20-40 crowd vaccinated. Won’t vaccine passports discriminatory it’s hard oppressed groups acquire IDs No, results taken grain salt even though promising. mean people zero risk getting sick dying covid lmao wow miracle one cares sounding smart reddit lol. reason people keep saying brings good question even worth using vaccine supply portion population unaffected virus first place. argument could made vaccines gave people immunity, can't argue vaccinating herd immunity. argument reduce symptoms prevent serious complications also moot portion population already little symptoms virus anyways. Deliveries increasing significantly last week two. went averaging 20 million per week 25 million. I'm already seeing people argue need keep masks around children get vaccinated. Even though virus even half deadly children seasonal flu. I'm hoping people outweighed proportion population remembers entire reason started hospitals could overwhelmed. got vaccinated yesterday Moderna too. Today, arm sore, barely move it! chronic pain condition though, probably help, condition seem flaring little. I'm hoping tomorrow better.

It's totally worth though! MUCH better getting Covid! would kids need this? Wow....your comment history something else. hurt you? 1. Routines transitions take time develop classroom. Teachers asked change horses midstream point. lot kids practiced wearing mask distancing year. CDC recently changed guidance 6 feet distancing 3 feet, requires teachers remeasure classrooms order space desks classroom furniture appropriately. Teachers worked really hard adjust changes pandemic small handful parents lazily placed lot undue blame continued community spread. 
2. fundamentals virus changed. still spreads via respiratory droplets people close contact. 
3. vaccine 'available' mostly meaningless many Northern California, especially pertains Kaiser health provider. enough doses available vaccines yet. 
4. Lots teachers health conditions complicated covid (ex: asthma older). personally can't blame protecting health. Let's real though, decisions made wholly basis teachers want bargain for. made guidance county public health, DHHS, school board. get covid, classroom regardless severity symptoms. is. UK, NHS contact letting know book appointment, need sign beforehand.  course need book appointment yourself, think there's way that.

My 81 year old mum got call doctor's asking time best go vaccination centre made appointment phone. second jab (she's booked next Thursday). missing important digits. 99.9997% recovery rate rate 0-18 year olds. That's imprecise. 3.5 million completed two doses, immunity achieved two weeks second dose. people younger 60 recieved vaccine, younger people ones falling gravely ill right now. Wisconsin’s government messed Disappointing expected. bought basic economy flight Delta June care window aisle one sitting next me. Might look upgrading flight now. He’s also saying theories running too.

Also laboratory accident hypothesis, head investigation team, Danish scientist Ben Embarek told reporters Tuesday Chinese lab staff acknowledged initially feared staff labs told us first reaction,"" Embarek went back records... nobody could find trace something similar virus records able pick firm arguments proof evidence labs would involved lab leak said, Embarek added: ""We done full investigation audit team members took Twitter defend Daszak, effusive praise Chinese hosts January probe, hit ""pure politics"" played findings led elements media.

I don’t think Peter Daszak effusively praise them. michigan GOP batshit crazy incredibly incompetent. pure political theater try harm future re-election chances. One biggest pet peeves reddit. make perfectly valid point someone *has* make comment one rare thing makes comment 100% true. Unfortunately, going eradicate covid. cause illness deaths rest eternity. goal always get manageable state. People die, hospitals overwhelmed number severe cases minimal. population centric approach. Welp. sound good. Amazing high risk older people live vaccinated? case resume normal life! Ontario, Canada. wave lighter world, around January ICU 110-120% full, surplus patients went CCU/Step-down etc, ICU nurse partnered 3 non-ICU nurses take care Covid patients enough qualified staff. wave currently experiencing expected worst one yet hospital resource perspective started ICUs still pretty much full, least staff vaccinated afraid more. think likely April bad things get better May, summer pandemic vaccination cover every adult end June. still dealing variants 1918 flu day. reading something months ago made claim probably also dealing variants Covid-19 next century too.  Columbus, Cincinnati, Cleveland Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine one, three, said prevent death. think I'm fan (for myself).

Are saying one people think 50% people go hospital covid then? matter fact almost two magnitude? Things looking great - want people celebrating soon!

* Daily Deaths (7 day average) dropped 1,000, early November, even initial dip early July 2020 600/day.

That's point though. prevalence studies show original fatality predictions correct, we'd 3-6 million Americans dead now.

Do know total Covid deaths Manaus far? know, no-notice blackout really played havoc, right? assumed place joining ""time reopen everything stop taking covid precautions"" thought train, reason sub closed down. overall dialog heavily skewed direction last 2-3 days blackout, that's mind went. made happy day.

Just saying. could probably also say corona near 100% ineffective young teens given 0.03 death rate almost 100% elderly immunocompromised.... Derek Lowe brilliant writer. ""[things work really funny fascinating I’m going say lockdowns don’t downsides, flaws, limited. However really wonder people realize bloodbath would store simply nothing.

I don’t studies top head, I’m sure could find good ones googled “lockdown effectiveness” something similar. people saw finish line. really think CDC flip flopping masks start good thing? Probay tooal

leave master spell check.   sure I’m downvoted hell pointing out.

Because comes across needless pessimism. Rum bar investors group field Winnipeg like paternalistic attitude cdc taken general, regard mask wearing initially, (not staying necessary, need reserve masks healthcare workers), well statements regarding herd immunity.

That said, there's reason see believe people adhered largely sensible local guidance fauci cdc messaging. 

Firstly, two often equivalent, local guidance ignoring cdc recommendations.

Secondly, people ignored guidance suited selfish. doubt noncompliant people spent much time listening fauci all. 0 covid refers 0 deaths. Whoever using mean cases, wrong. started March 75.2M ending month 150M. That's crazy good progress. Kudos everyone involved making possible. 0 covid nothing cases. 0 covid *deaths.* really produce known mutation

Yes did. Two first identified New York (B.1.525 B.1.526), one first seen California (B.1.427).

The NY variants ""variants interest"" California one ""variant concern"". needing boosters becomes thing, probably get rolled standard flu shot, already protects multiple strains based happens circulating year. get feelings behind all, want us get back normal ASAP! see reason rush see finish line. like running marathon 26 miles quitting final .2. Let's right END IT. WHO’s Department Immunization, Vaccines Biologicals Kate O’Brien said expect shortages measles vaccine right now. However, warned could change intense pressure increase manufacturing capacity COVID-19 vaccine.

I’m tired headlines. Maybe I’m reading wrong. thought headline meant “may happen soon” rather “we need make sure doesn’t happen.” might people media online talking former reality, latter. Especially given many people America vaccinating, precedent uptick among younger people Israel back February. don’t know got 7 million figure active cases, don’t see could accurate. people recover within week two (at least terms ability transmit virus what’s relevant getting spread control) like said infection rate 65,000 cases day week 55,000 cases day last week. equates fewer 1 million cases diagnosed last 2 weeks. 

I think reporting recoveries likely either incomplete, including people persistent symptoms longer contagious, both. 2,200 teens trial, half got vaccine, half placebo. 18 kids placebo arm tested positive, 0 vaccine arm did.

Much smaller trial adult ones therefore less powerful, still fantastic 18/2200 Ans x 100 0.81
Did pass grade 4? Everyone would screwed mRNA didn’t work out.  got downvoted shit pointing think would say maybe 2 weeks everyone opportunity vaccinated (at least 1st dose), probably within next 6 weeks. required beards hijab would reaction? whole ""if saves One Life"" mentality extreme

Do evidence mentality even exists anywhere world? think strawman. whole reason needed covid restrictions first place save thousands lives--*millions*, global scale. we're approximately herd immunity particular country, deaths dwindled almost nothing, open up. Krispy Kreme baby guys explained chip uses *antenna* actually able receive transmit data? Yes, absolutely would been.

Really though, personally would wanted quite irrelevant - what's important getting people make policies lay clear, objective criteria would end emergency measures perspective. disagree measures, it, I'd accept clarity rules. Instead, we've ever shifting set policies, starting infamous ""two weeks flatten curve"" people believe risk populations vaccinated insufficient. Check nj.com. info Murphy’s press conference earlier. think makes people pessimistic see people getting vaccinated. clearly isn’t Wisconsin Supreme Court final authority issue Wisconsin. hell lockdown talking about? live MI governor pretty much threw restrictions window January. state health director even resigned recklessness. great decided YOLO suppression efforts, then, surprise, surprise, cases exploded. 

It's almost year effective suppression protecting people, followed utterly careless ""reopening,"" told everyone lies safe good go whatever, even myriad public health experts warned this. everyone got sick! 

TX FL skipped first part get go, explains difference, law book. emergency orders expire 60 days. governor follow law appropriately rebuked. absolutely set precedent future Emergency orders. Could point nothing. Key words. Sure, case that's \*good\* thing.

It kills supposedly Christian people encouraging idolatry school. entire year figure set systems distribute vaccines, we've basically fumbling along. could centralized system sign vaccine, nah, let's fuck around year scramble last minute.

We've huge amount time ramp production top vaccine candidates, yet barely available approved. J&amp;J worst offender, much extra time they've had, little they've produced, far behind projections are.

Young kids *need* social contact peers - adults vaccinated, think fair keep putting barriers place them. Dunno. willing use child find out. 

I watch states going orange red every day, rather yellow green, though. tells we're going wrong way right now. now's time ease anything. I'd sooner burn bra mask.  is? thought load kinds vaccines people don’t get like rabies, smallpox, anthrax, yellow fever, etc. literally idiotic expected florida texas? 24 month old, can't even wear mask 10 seconds. We've trying success. happy cousins age socialize play with. #BUT MUH VARIANTARINOS!!!! Social retarding kids worse guaranteed result keeping kids playing together sheltered inside.

But that's he's Masks young kids simply work effectiy

Doesn't mean try. kid like I'm going try hard get stick encourage social interaction it. hope others try well least teach kids understand kids wearing masks weird. What’s weather like month nineteen? parents ok children playing children outside without masks. Inside another story.  obviously majority adults much sooner, hopefully two three weeks now. exciting stuff. You’re saying things now. pull authorization. NYT article updated latest whenever CDC updates data. California/Florida data updated end February. That's cool. kind masks have? pain day. Nothing like week terrible arm pain TDaP booster! guy talking lol, hes comparing excess deaths. even still January, going change much 3 months. Useless comment. Yep, Biden said got office, Trump made plans distribute vaccines let states whatever want it, know terrible plan. state could turn inside open public. said tenant land open public (a gun store, sole proprietorship) follow COVID-19 restrictions. Definitely way suffered from
COVID. person’s antivaxxer next impossible convince otherwise. It’s pretty sad Nah think many kids like pledge own. know stopped kid school parents influence. OH LIKE KNOWS It’s untested. Anybody thinks need punish choose get vaccinated us favor move China.  Exactly. Plus number places take child get outside exercised without really worry wearing mask. 

Ride bikes them, take hiking, fishing etc. Chase around field, number things help get 

But dont use trip store family outing like see many people doing. Target, Walmart, c'mon! Seems kinda mixed messaging reading told CBS’s Face Nation sending kids summer camps allowing play playgrounds ""aspirational goal go for"". added ""we know ... sure"" possible summer. Hasn’t Changed

For now, **if you’ve fully vaccinated**:

* still take steps [protect many situations, **like wearing mask, staying least 6 feet apart others, avoiding crowds poorly ventilated spaces**. Take precautions whenever are:
  * public
  * Gathering unvaccinated people one household
  * Visiting unvaccinated person [increased risk severe illness death lives person increased risk

Combined AsztraZeneca stories coming Canada Europe, vaccines going really hard time converting anti-vaxxers :/ See also “Not racist, but...” venting. fucking hard states simply set objective measures restrictions lifted instead making guessing game? swear, people fucking want locked forever.

You one job hold true, know that. article 3 unknown number fully vaccinated people got covid19. 

In phase three trials every vaccine 6% - 25% developed symptomatic covid19 fully vaccinated.

(4-6% Pfizer Moderna, 25% J&amp;J). Daily reminder USA blocked Brazil receiving Sputnik V NJ NY natives crossing border taking PA doses PA residents.

There lots people ""work"" NY states coming take doses NY well. You’re fucking mind Probably 6 weeks average. Granted, vaccinated greatly reduce risk make symptoms likely mild get sick. point risk never zero, vaccine think point June difference big first doses, second doses yes maybe. 

Edit: vaccines approved teenagers, there's still room individuals vaccinated even there's high COVID vaccine rejection rate like expected US Germany BioNTech/Pfizer going 1,076,400 2,515,500 doses per week starting next week. EU countries similar ordering plans see increase.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* sure see correlation like Congressman Gaetz California lots appointments weekends. Okay, bad this? violent agreement think, stand reason mods did. hoped group due current situation would stay kerfuffle sake current pandemic situation. debatable sure. 15 million gone. Oops lol Americans trying ""get back"" Europeans mocking poor COVID response initially.  based reality judge everything merit. Yes, good news. still stay top variants may evolve resist vaccine Bruh COVID 3 weeks ago. Tested positive, full quarantine etc. recovered.

My girlfriend 3 PCR tests time, negative. tested positive rapid tests.

I see every day (we don’t live together though), including yesterday.

Does anyone know supposed quarantine I’ve exposed? continue normal life COVID recently? Probably spreading blatant misinformation unnecessarily panics people, encouraging make unsafe unhealthy decisions. Thankfully, virus particles smaller smoke particles. Plus they're living things killed UV light air temperature.  vaccine introduced 1950s, epidemics would result 7760 cases paralytic polio UK year, 750 deaths

One older siblings died complications measles, next neighbour unable walk normally polio, oldest friend poor eyesight measles. 

My generation high rates vaccine take saw first hand consequences vaccinated. ignore deaths disability others. pushing asymptomatic transmission hard November December lot people think change tune health experts getting muzzled politicians. start seeing daily numbers shoot states opening vaccine ages revising 40-50+ groups misread ""NYC could completely wiped within 6 8 weeks"" whew startle  Seems like weird way headline this. Checking rates march 5 (older) shows: 
Native Americans far highest 
Then African Americans Pacific Islanders
Then White Americans, Hispanics, far lowest death rate: Asian Americans. 
So, POC hardest hit least hardest hit? 
 
I'd bet economics, Hispanics outlier. Cases flying Ontario rn. agree lockdown obv work, surprised Getting vaccine possible risk yourself, getting risk everyone. Nope said 40 millions right claiming solved production issues. military prepared coup? 

Would Bolsonaro try coup lost next election? Yawn. trials said 95% effective, 100% effective. people get COVID fully vaccinated: 5% many would've gotten otherwise. Honestly, here, think fairly moral milk price lil make mink farms pay up. Brazil #5 world vaccinations relate jealous. can’t get hyped much. Except anger guess felt anything similar stroke immediately call ambulance lose time check honest. could right, someone else pointed below, eviction books make difficult folks find another place live long-term impact credit. can't believe people would choose bring even year free rent. 

Of course, larger problem many suffer consequences refuse pay rent, legitimately can't. Extending eviction moratorium delayed inevitable, we're eventually going see lot people lives absolutely ruined result pandemic. 

??? Dozens Central Florida contract COVID-19 fully Thats big group 0 positive tests shame getting vaccines Russia.

On hand letting USA puppets Brussels dictate European 
nations' vaccine policy limiting sovereignty time shameful.  people who’ve definitely ignoring rules entire time, I’m sure idea finally might comply guideline order whatever want pretty scary. 

You know what’s dystopian me? Living pandemic watching many people become completely callous death, refusing inconvenience even slightly save lives. 

Oh, wait. “Not anti-vaxxer, but...” equals anti-vax. Anecdote* Totally agree. diffusing whataboutism vaccine bashing anyone brings stuff like up. shit. can’t wait absolutely grind faces people said otherwise. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Local COVID subreddit talking still catch spread disease even fully vaccinated. thoroughly debunked false CDC earlier week.

The misinformation there. isn’t anti-vaxxers. far lower since significant level preexisting immunity (it's called asymptomatic infections, functionally thing).

I believe number somewhere around 45% reach herd immunity. quote though Israel probably less people catch Covid per capita US, actually get sooner. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

Perhaps would better give paranoid anti-vax idiot free extra pitcher ale already lubed up. Bartenders could last guardian get last 10%. Germany deaths almost one wave fairness. great response initial waves absolutely shat bed rest pandemic. Germany's cases rising again.. thumbs big. use context clues . . . Maybe?

Well, maybe not.

Also, I'm 40s grew falling trees 10 acres wooded canyons. It’s not. states reporting recoveries. active cases tracker thinks still people last March covid. Yeah matter low death rate disease. contagious enough it'll kill plenty. I've several threads Twitter people either stop responding bring immediately change subject. makes concerned vaccine? normal zero arm pain zero side effects getting first dose Pfizer? cant fill plane ‘blocking’ middle seats great way make good marketing/PR. Still laughably close people front behind you.. still hundreds planes 2-2 2-1 lol hey, still opted fly past 3 flights it. Story long term health effects ends controversial sort. It’s almost like there’s large group sub doesn’t want admit metric death. wanting spend entire lives inside wanting resume activities actually make life enjoyable “anti-science”, “hard right”. We’re year varying degrees lockdowns across western society. Given multiple effective vaccines it’s worth questioning exactly lockdowns trying achieve point. destruction cause society gets worse day. Refusing seriously consider strikes extremely narrow minded. 
 
“Science” according Reddit seems increasingly mean fawning small number people support preexisting political views. real person? Doubt it. know downvoted stating fact. less populous counties managed drop purple? think even 1 case would send purple per 100,000 scale. much later second dose get sick test positive? world would stagger openings vaccines?

Like seriously, hell make logical sense you? can't equate two calculated risks one two choices willful ignorance. understand sentiment. Healthcare workers refuse incredibly selfish stupid, suspend huge swathes healthcare workers pandemic seem like great idea. Presumably Italy, like places, huge abundance them. human rights standpoint, unrestricted COVID transmission violates people's right life, important rights listed, can't exercise dead. freedom movement swing fist ends face, also right intact nose. “Imagine vaccination card order things!! dystopia!”

Said person clearly didn’t attend university USA hasn’t traveled overseas tropical region. Mentioned politics gets comment deleted need masks impossible tell vaccinated isn’t, it’s unfair businesses try address that. 70% US vaccinated, see masks disappearing. R/Masks4all good recommendations. got mix n match 10 piece box Healthy test out, settled style kids liked best got bulk pack. FWIW, husband last summer wore KF94 daily work since great protection. Colbert last night acknowledged new CDC data said could change recommendation vaccinated people it. Nah, anything means ""war"" please. saying education campaigns course. 10x normal rate. 

Which very, low. 

Actually adult covid higher risk severe disease one it.

I'd get AZ anytime, can't. wife got first jab getting second one little doubts it. i’m getting first shot saturday i’m 17! excited shock story health consequences involving 20 something shoots top controversial sort. assume CDC continue advising masks know long vaccines last for? literally couldn’t protected. Next question! It’s likely cause dominant strain Covid significantly contagious one summer.

But still really doesn’t make sense. It’s annoying people taking masks numbers rising, won’t get close point. MIS-C sends regards. 

But y’all don’t actually care stuff long term complications, ya?

Now quick, hit sketchy Facebook/lockdownskeptic math won’t hold even tiniest bit scrutiny. mean, yes, there's still whole ""Schools can't dangerous cause kids ever get Covid"" crowd running around. Fortnight One giant unventilated room coughing eachothers' faces? Saturday afternoon Walmart. kill elderly start, even noticed ripping child population. Pediatricians might said, ""Wow, lots colds year. Must new coronavirus CDC mentioned.""

That would it. Parents probably even know existed. lol ok Whoa really screwed giving vaccine sick person. able rule wasn’t cannot state *was* ? Something seems amiss, even it’s glossing huge error. wouldn’t surprised lawsuit whoever administered it, potentially exacerbating whatever going him. don’t know getting downvoted, you’re correct, cure become far worse disease. mentioned UAE right Israel - Bahrain high list? seen numbers support Husband got first doses Moderna yesterday. Still feeling tired today (but could also cat decided perform cat opera 5am encore performance 7am). 

Also, mom stepdad got appointments get shots next week Monday! UK 50:50 Pfizer AZ, vaccinated elderly first. Let check. Nope. Imagine trying get kids, nevermind adults, keep wearing masks 2022/2023

Also, social development? Faces kinda essential that. Biden already stated Canada Mexico going get excess vaccines US first (being neighbors), rest world start getting help. Thanks, guess I'll refresh page around midnight later see things open up. Well, isn’t AZ giving UK preferential treatment European countries shady tactics (there recently article Italian authorities found AZ secretly storing vaccine doses earmarked exported UK)? Also, it’s EU, Canada also stopped giving younger population AZ also fucked trials US, giving incorrect doses another time providing incorrect/outdated efficacy data. I’m kinda inclined believe scientists saying kids 12 years vaccine 2022. guarantee parents kids adhere guidelines another 12 months.

Wonder many listening since March 2020 first national lockdown had.  

That lasted two weeks previous President got bored started pushing reopening ignoring health safety many people still carrying torch today. take state example (oklahoma)

the governor resisted *anything* covid *talking* entirety pandemic -- never got mask mandate, governor regularly spotted eating restaurants family maskless, public events -- got covid recovered without issue

just like trump many republican leaders, say, even fucking twitter, *matters*.

now, vaccines opened everybody week, appointment slots sitting empty. I'm even sure half population take it. Neither parents -- *most* family younger like 70 taking either.

I'd rather mandatory vaccinations, nationwide. I'd happily volunteer help hold / tie people necessary. surprised pikachu face lot people work super religious, essential oil loving, not-so-bright types. might harder think. need make sure rest world gets vaccinated count people tested postive 14 days second shot soon get second shot? No, doesn’t need done. say no, disagree this. it’s possible incidences serious reactions essentially zero. data useful data. 

Kids can’t encouraged get it. isn’t approved age group unable access it. won’t option matter much parents ask it. CVS saw tons people line shot, love see news?  one got vaccine died yet? So, immortality cocktail? That’s true, especially vaccinated population 50:50 Pfizer AZ  also discharged people care homes without negative test. local mental health services sending generic worksheets instead giving real care. I'm sending back without stamp they're totally useless. They're want work. they've spent months bouncing service service. 

The NHS also stole PPE care homes. orders diverted left without PPE personal care. apparent why. US spent stimulus one year WWII. better great deal economic payback else crippled future generations sake mostly elderly sick people fixing die within years anyway. I’m get fully vaccinated two weeks, daughter opted fully remote learning classroom filled 20 kids 5 including mine remote learning. allowed kids take masks recess kids age (she 7 she’s first grade) still gross. We’ve isolation year transitioning working full time stay home mom rough us. desperately want get friends bring park they’re crowded plus we’re nj averaging 3K cases day it’s tough man. We’re still probably going avoiding parks summer stick isolated hiking trails instead :/ wish could get vaccinated would heart beat say best way avoid COVID wear mask. Whether wise let child play kids natural way depend health status kid overall life situation. absolutely zero qualifications judging whether COVID lack socialization worse kids.

If know, say know. Otherwise, overly confident giving advice fit give. guess it’s due perception. I’ve hung around athletes basically life, lot good great shape, may carry weight due muscle mass. suppose average joe, BMI still uses.  

What fray here? say Murica, fuck everything else, say like, responding pandemic first place, knocked park vaccination world really quite jelly. Great, I’d like see state release roadmap levels considers “negligible.” then, goalposts. impossible unreasonable ask. Anyone young kid would attest that. Believe science! Don’t dare question anything! That’s scientific!!! Maybe don’t brave impressive, vent covid covid discussion sub, valid. 

Downvote move causes much distress. good day! Far best vaccine though This. People need realize Dr. Fauci one objective, one objective only, prevent spread disease. That’s it. balanced issues that’s job, be. Listen infectious disease advice, voice one among many comes actually making effective reasonable policy. 😂 joke. Fauci needs resign. another fearmonger seen data regarding children Covid? daughter turned three she’s exactly same.  International travel isnt happening another year two.  ever hospitalised asthma would eligible believe Reddit predominantly visited white men conservative fuck. think so, that's can't see since agrees viewpoints lol mean willing wait list treatment is... I'll wait days see feel. also feel bad work trip canceled planned Srping Break lake house cannot fly. Realistically, supposed say? “Fatties front line!”

BMI simple metric: weight/height. accurate measures body fat difficult calculate home. Sure, muscular people qualify overweight obese, it’s like bodybuilder epidemic country. 

BMI probably best way sort population people at-risk due weight. administrative burden sorting minority fit people isn’t worth it. Man...it’s weird science medicine works  sure. Covid case (tho viruses). Children ultimate super spreaders, everything, since forever. They'll fine. want kids (you kids, right?) wear masks, thats call. equally essential voice shared concerns international expert study source SARS-CoV-2 virus significantly delayed lacked access complete, original data samples,"" said joint statement released website U.S. State Department  hell, matter, clothes all. 25 MHz? Much higher diagnostic imaging BW, no? It’s cool result doesn’t seem immediately applicable clinic setting. I'm Cal weather past weekend perfect, bbq's alcohol. work grocery store. Everyone still masks on, think people think over. I'm waiting Easter spike. Hopefully happen Thanksgiving Christmas terrible. case I'd rather wait use another manufacturers vaccine take chances covid. TRUST SCIENTISTS MATTER majority AZ. 50:50 split Pfizer AZ far, Moderna coming recently vaccinate millions Yes. Every free months I’ve thrown CDC covid mortality datasets Splunk, data analysis tool. 25 flu considerably deadly. Even pneumonia flu covid. Sometime 30s numbers start shift, becomes much much dramatic get 60 so. 

The incredibly low risk children led sending kids back full time, person august. one know infected still.  Certainly is..especially one party leader makes fun others leaders ‘big mask’

Scoffing pandemic got us mess degree. understand!?! concerns! one concern remains: Stopping Covid. cost else. considerations wellbeing, economy society matter. Join us new religion.

All hail God Emporer Fauci! Yeah doesn’t feed pro lockdown crowds ideology!!!! weird, someone brings safety concern, always winds pros cons something dangerous, cons incredibly concrete, rare, pros nebulous often immeasurable.

You always wind justify things. ""Doing X well worth number kids die."" puts nasty image people's minds. We're unused imagining actions result death suffering we're faced it, treat like novel phenomena, like nothing we've ever done caused death.

""Family car trips convenience dragging kids along day well worth 900 child deaths caused car accidents year.""

Put way people might start thinking immoral *always* sitter possible, always leave kids neighbor, sort child rotation someone neighborhood takes care kids get awful death traps.

Really though, develop tolerance risk based experience, prior year people thought risk concretely ever lives. “Sure. get right that...” EU, also fucked trials US, second trial. legit don’t think they’re even gonna get approved US - enough doses contracted already + people gonna reluctant take vaccine bad press that’s last thing need. many deaths many you? People also die flu every year, albeit less still. whole narrative us going living lives selfish didnt apply flu seasons yesterday, why? weighing risks. said kids wear mask socializing. Somehow thread thinks said keep kids lock key. sounds perfect fair. Let’s safe wait 2025 anyone socialize again. kids get vaccinated need vaccinate lions minks. Fauci approves! It’s likely true poor case counts somewhat blame lower burden disease Africa, vital fact African countries much younger way less fat populations developed world US near top terms vaccine distribution. What's negativity. plain wrong. That's great idea. explanation immune system? Kids target market. Fauci nothing salesman. Biological science effectively uses Bayesian thinking evaluating hypotheses: given question start prior probability later influenced data arrive probability hypothesis given data. Whichever hypothesis highest probability wins. 

Even absence data, prior probability alone point answer likely true compared alternative answers. hypotheses may low probability even one marginally higher others. even one favoured, doesn’t mean confident it. 

On face it, probably opportunities zoonotic transmission Wuhan’s wild animal market lab accident. hand, high fitness virus humans might favour directed gain function efficiently done lab. 

People need test old biopsies area hospitals going back 2018 well old samples lab freezer. said, they’re still working it. don’t think communication skills harmed way babies’ communication skills. They’re refining, understanding faces first time. also think around parents, vaccinated grandparents, etc everyone unmasked practice skills then. big groups kids like school camp? think benefits masks school age kids outweigh downside get vaccines. numbers sound exaggerated it’s actually worse. Ruined social development millions save one. lot friends family Ohio eligible, everyone is, can't find appointment anywhere actually get one. open anyone available anyone two different things. Mine won’t either priming immune system develop response spike protein funsies, totally immunity involved.  guy powertripping balls Jesus move kid Texas. I’m Massachusetts liberal ridiculous! in, waaTER wet. whole place lost minds. Thank sane. Atherton, CA, 75% residents received vaccine. eligible population 35% Alloha too.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* never happens?  they’re vaccinated. 9 clotting issues happened days first dose. None second dose. half rare pre-existing health conditions. talk physician blood pressure concerns. currently trial underway UK AZ Pfizer given boosters other, think expecting imminent results.  Maybe let them? That's generous. frozen food theory blatant CCP propaganda. I'm surprised humor claim US military personnel planted virus Wuhan (yes, Chinese officials actually promoted that).

Source: 2s supposed wear one all. IMHO latest series fireably bad judgement calls Fauci. understood logic early pandemic guidance masks (flipping wearing), overcautious approach emerging this, eg delayed school reopening, gatherings vaccinated, etc far dangerous virus. poor kids haven’t seen another child year. Hopefully people passports ready Indeed. point risk anti-socialization vs covid? worse? god small moments stab heart gotta take em passing arent crying allll time lol

today son three boys took break lunch sat different tables took sons mask one boys wandered (as toddlers float thru world bumping people things lol) son squeezed real tight said ""im gonna get sick im gonna get sick""

-knife wound. heartbreaking even worry that. 

we'll add extra doses ""make feel safe"" ...AKA snuggle time (im fine that!!!!!! haha)  Pretty sure J&amp;J also adenovirus. 1 sec. brb.

“The researchers added gene coronavirus spike protein another virus called Adenovirus 26. Adenoviruses common viruses typically cause colds flu-like symptoms. Johnson &amp; Johnson team used modified adenovirus enter cells can’t replicate inside cause   Lol ain’t happening. Covid kids minor cold. flu bigger threat kids vaccinated scared of? younger one wearing mask hours end shortly turning two.

I believe you, son wearing mask day.  sees mom dad wear masks time, 5 minutes playing it. You’ll win huge settlement case does. Win-win. Could endometriosis possible cause?  Oh FFS i'm gonna able get vaccine again.
Been waiting weeks now. think adults allowed make adult decisions too! know man. I’m kinda going wait see definitely not. talk mandating covid passports seems like slipperly slope. happened HIPAA? getting asked kinds inappropriate medical questions strangers. 

Generally speaking choice I’m likely comply go along. feel forced.... naturally don’t want take contrarian position. 

I’ve 3 vaccine slots gave away. FDA doesn’t President’s bidding. Never had, never will. process, *always* processes place expedited review. prioritize urgent things, would expect could should. 

This nonsense people don’t understand FDA drug reviews reason people think “rushed”. FUCKING SHOCKED! Matt Gaetz rapist here. 2.5 year old wears one long periods without complaint. took work get used goes picks mask leave house. playground I’d say least 80-90% kids wearing masks. symptoms tested positive I’d imagine false positive tests think j j, moderna, pfizer used slightly modified spike protein stuck one conformation. Without modification spike protein flops around.  Same. I’ll probably wear one I’m plane mean come feel may getting sick I’ll wear one respect others reason can’t remain home. least work boss always go work home don’t spread germs here. use one change kids shit diapers there’s post pandemic use lol. anyone knows they’re talking explain what’s going Chile? feel like I’ve heard cases pretty bad there, also they’ve relatively good getting vaccines there. What’s that? go well US. heads cloth surgical masks somehow magic layer enough literally able breathe water. president doctor fuck telling take hydroxychloroquine? 

Imagine Obama told reporters inject something bodies fight disease. party would've brought forth impeachment proceeds within hour. 
I think assholes would like go forever guys get government control . 

You start insults mad ahole?  Honestly, I'm worried child getting covid anymore. I'm worried emotionally stunted protecting &lt; %1 80 year olds. year, time move on. can't draw conclusions based &lt;21 days data. metric may provide timely insights test positivity rate. anyone actually looked statistics could told month ago. 
Michigan’s infection rate fire continues climb. daughter 2 insists wearing mask time goes outside. fucking weirdo. I’m aware lockdowns reduce transmission. they’re always necessary avoid hospital crisis. Right Texas they’re waste time. cells? Resident Evil? one word comes mind, DUUUH! totally get it. 2.5 year old starting show interest kids pandemic started. We’ve careful freezes panics kid gets close her. finally broke invited friend two kids (f2 m10mo.) go Zoo us first hour would shout little girl “no! Go away! Away!” shooing hands. try super hard cry. finally get used bonded Tiger exhibit. worried catching COVID relieved socializing enjoying herself.

Edit: clarity Ha, thought well. project hard supposed massive amount anti-social shut-ins want continue yet posting much threads. outside day couple parks nice worked outside enjoyed it. 

I favor progressively reducing mitigation strategies cases decline that's mostly what's happening, even states known strongest mitigation policies, never even severe Europe elsewhere. support dropping mitigation efforts right second 20-30% (not sure right now) population fully vaccinated. Yeah didnt expect would be. figured would probably form MRI type contraption would target specific areas. Like Nose/throat/lungs mostly Covid (and thusly interposing areas like skin.muscle, bone etc... ) figured would difficult, anything better nothing. he's one private sectors, schools, &amp; government going listen to. word gospel. say ""I'm totally asking, lost mind"" powerless comes time bringing children anywhere homes. maddening. want go could spend time friends family celebrate uncle? want go could eat food? think kids would prefer close kids wearing masks maskless able play kids all. six year old three year old. younger one wearing mask hours end shortly turning two.

We wearing tie-on masks rather ear loops, probably helped.

But younger one wear mask without complaint long needed. first year getting annual sinus infection I’m good 2 every year almost. time changing fall winter winter spring. Forgot almost it’s like disagree messaging. Taking thoughtful measures pandemic fear. It’s analysis decision making. said, questioning thoughtfulness measures, overall reactions address real problem pandemic. Thanks. also relaying whole ton medical jargon thrown 2 minutes video. president, doctor. 

Let’s see run country try make sense every little thing say told boat loads information every minute. Jeez, haven’t already? Well California too? so, Florida try hide something not? paper implying DeSantis fudging numbers fires anyone dares reveal truth. Someone right behind you, they’re planning stealing “freedom” 5-10% ass. Based immuno- reactoginicity data, likely way less 1%. Keep mind two mRNA vaccines, two different expressed spike vaccines using chimp ad, Novavax using cellular generation natural adjuvants, fuck it, fly russia want Sputnik V.  


Also ""strongly recommended"" based what? know two people reacted strongly shot one still able get shot two. I'm saying people take precautions, I'm saying people take precautions told doom gloom. People need hope, need see light end tunnel keep pushing. Continuously telling people ""the end sight"" ""doom coming"" put people even trying.

Tell people diligent, persistent. Tell people help, help only, actually get crisis. Show getting crisis looks like. Depending age long, result children acquiring developmental disabilities. I'm still waiting easter surge last year here! precautionary bs. vaccinated, safe. people data sell, less valuable becomes. thought would come September... going eat together wearing masks? can’t eat mask on. there’s point going you’re going participate. 

Yes, vast majority people except specific want upvotes reddit.com. showcase California excess deaths it’s conspiracy Florida hiding Covid deaths. There’s lot dumb conspiracy theorists say deaths equal California they’re hiding something. method offer special privileges vaccinate going end post vaccination ""masking social distancing"" Allergy season death glare times 20. That's worse headline. fine way is. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 God Bless President Joseph R. Biden Jr. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Right trying clarify would worried completely escaping vaccine efficacy. Cuomo exact thing. kids playing fine year. appreciate concern Dr Fauci I’m going isolate 4 year old 25-30% lives something 99.999998% surviving. Same, want single reminder bonfire masks! Injecting bleach disinfectant would kill ass.

""Oh well say inject said inject deadly substance. Libs twisting words. Checkmate atheists.""

Actual degenerate. This.

I get sucks holed much 2020 still able eat out, attend concerts, etc. full capacity. that's much better physically ABLE go can't walk 100 feet without running breath, much less dancing mingling others nightclub. Part successful vaccine rollout getting citizens want take it, responsibility fall state. communicate effectively important, effective is, safe is, sign get it, etc. It’s called coronavirus spike protein. spike protein isn’t going away. Congratulations them. Basically positive news proxy Brexit movement. Felt like bad beforehand won’t approved kids year. going let die? do, what's criteria? isolate diabetic asthmatic obese kids we're African American Hispanics they're much higher risk Caucasians? article anywhere recent information AstraZeneca clotting issue? 

I'm woman thirties got first dose AZ Europeam country two weeks ago see Germany suspended use vaccine anyone 60. live Germany imagine countries might follow suit. I've series health issues since getting vaccinated, namely really elevated blood pressure landed ER, way know connected vaccine yet new, I'm quite worried might safe personally get another dose. want fully vaccinated. information whether mix vaccines? excited getting vaccinated seeing light end tunnel day first shot, blood clot stuff started happening. I'm grateful access vaccine all, course, kind feels like ended worst one. getting number from? That's fine fact he's even adding ""and serious issues low"" part context. many people understand actual risk even keep kids locked ""can't safe"".

It's obvious many people look things further. People need FULL CONTEXT. children, flu kills 1 every 10,000 cases. That’s 0.01%. Source: Lancet death rate children looks lower Covid 0.17 every 100K cases. that’s 0.0017% source: mortality rate increases dramatically higher age groups brings average overall population up.  However pediatric issue, Covid remains low risk threat children. Better well done ketchup like Trump say paid different amounts vaccine US also multiple states lifting restrictions early. Again. virologist data analyst. do, however, need data analyst. someone data analysis, guy pisses off. Sorry, know I'm talking major concern right months. mRNA vaccines use shortened form Spike protein, full length. Antibodies generated concentrated two regions spike protein (NTD RBD), entire protein. RBD (where neutralizing antibodies fall) increased selective pressure high case/high vaccination scenario selects escape mutants continue propagate virus vs low case/high vaccination scenario. But, I'm sorry upset educating you. country Island. Can’t simply reallocate doses within state itself? Dunno it’s like MI CA regions w appointments available rn rural regions haven’t given much thought Covid precautions (I’m looking Riverside). Whitmer closing schools otherwise it’s p clear that’s outbreaks starting there. Yeah, hospitals nowhere bear capacity, aren’t likely hit capacity either. 

We continue wear masks try limit exposure can, extended social distancing comes social cost beginning outweigh benefits. Source claim Pfizer causes blood clots? fiance EU her. 

The supply lower states country actually going back lockdown now. clarify, UK (now defunct Avon precise). EU exported 70.000.000 doses far. UK US exported 0 doses vaccines approved country. talking about? Stupid automod took comment. probably still see profile, though. downvoted.

This way important news daily vaccination numbers. Appreciate help. I’ll give read. Stay safe regardless! would like know rate blood clots brain comparable non vaccinated population. ""Come Romeo.

Why anti-science? know tell you. offered every secondary school kid 2005 get couldn't. Ask parents. Maybe exempted getting  [Here's Israeli showing 94% reduction asymptomatic infections. And, [here's even newer study came showing 90% reduction asymptomatic infections.

Regarding mutations, there're different studies different mutations course; [here's one Ignore title; look data showing there's still enough neutralization. Unfortunately still rocky. Restaurants operate razor thin profit margins absolutely cannot afford another summer down. Also, remember lot restaurants still alive able survive 1) less bailed either government, owners, 2) shifted takeout model laid 70-80% staff.

Rehiring without people come shut means absolutely fucked.

Even rough. Like said lot owners floating business, they're going breaking making before, actually making money covid pay back borrowed money make enough stay alive make razor thin profit. restaurants seem like they're going great, they're really falling slowly. Well. fair. Swine flu vaccine debacle 1976 oh definitely true. many people don’t follow covid guidelines :( also varies region within states.

I love NY vaccine easy get ny area, ny sister lives 3 hours West took recently get appt. precarious situation right now. talking friend (who healthcare) dumping countries entire budget covid vaccines right call. biggest unknown variants evolution virus. closest model covid outbreak OC43 jumped humans caused ""Russian Flu"" 1889. look viral respiratory pandemics well (flu) models. Historically, pandemics last 1-2 years disappeared background, remaining endemic population. probably combination lack remaining susceptible hosts, acquired immunity large segments population, well viral mutations leading less virulence perhaps increased transmissibility. 

The use vaccines antibody treatments new wrench thrown mix, much precedent global respiratory pandemic. really know affects future spread, pandemic length, viral mutation. fl mess. Hmmm Sweden quite close US... kidding. Same. I'm young healthy almost 0 covid cases country moment. I'll wait long term outcomes available consider getting it. think US pace supply need certain point. likely send excess vax globally. learned damn thing 7yo son licks inside his.  Allow help. People, especially people Facebook, fucking stupid. shocked face. I've lost weight since working home actually cook instead relying fast food! draw line? made Herd Immunity estimates based opinion polls? said wear two masks backtracked shortly thereafter? said wear mask (lying keep ppe available). pushed use AZT aids epidemic killed lot people? That’s really good number hear. hope get something like 90. 

It’s crazy vaccines weren’t best ever produced history medical science, would practically pointless even vaccinate people. Fine, Lesnard, 😡. thought supposed use real names internet.

There point going reception funeral, everyone grieving wanting community other, hug eat together cry laugh think death loved one, understandably so. That’s appropriate time say “um sorry, don’t get close me. um sorry, put mask”. That’s time masked up, can’t even emote *human* other. Someone died. time. Interesting can’t seem understand since claim lost someone. 

I hate virus turned us into, forced us less social other. why, I’m fully vaccinated couple weeks, I’m excited social regular human again, exception wearing masks required.

Judge please, I’m done conversation. Feel free argue yourself. Hope good day. don’t understand compare PRE COVID clot data likelihood blood clots vaccinations covid rampant it’s well known covid infections associated clotting blood issues. control group non vaccine current covid era clot rates else bad science?  Classy. Walmart opening appointments right midnight they’re near you. case, yeah makes sense. want target oldest first. Let's say town 70s make 50% population. going vaccinate university town 70s make 5% population. That's unfair unequal. best use resources. flu kills less 10% people given year Covid killed past year. argument means nothing Sure. Apparently kids care something means enforce it. everything free, know it’s crazy. could also read complaining. vote like move on. think fair people complain Covid Covid sub. It’s specific type blood clot. Blood clots brain laughing matter son got sick unidentified viral illness winter ended 104 fever. took pediatrician doctor told us almost certainly wasn’t COVID little kids generally don’t get sick COVID. Tested anyhow rule out. Sure enough, 24 hours later got negative COVID test back. screamers neighborhood never gotten message. play together, scream bloody heads live long day. proof back up, would imagine they're trying prevent people lying vaccinated circumvent restrictions enough people vaccinated matter hydroxychloroquine actually seen effective covid? never mandated use hydroxychloroquine covid19? said promising studies?

At end day, democrats beyond furious even got in. Everyone thought joke ran, floored won. result that, hate leached everyone. picked apart every last breath guy. 

My sisters friend Ireland said hated Trump didn’t even know why. Imagine that. daycare couple outbreaks (in son's class even) time one else tested positive sick kid recovered day two.

This really different young kids adults. I'd worry flu rsv outbreak classroom, tbh. Especially adults vaccinated. decision making around COVID-19 lockdowns highly political, exist technocratic bubble.

Back May/June last year short immediate lockdown would probably best thing Melbourne, political belief steps either necessairy publicly popular.

Melbourne's subsequent long level 4 lockdown 4 months informs Australian decision makers think COVID outbreaks. They're making decisions fear short, sharp lockdown, contract tracing cannot control outbreak, they'll punished public opinion.

The political cost lockdown 3-5 days easy price in, particularly they're highly effective. decision makers choose quantifable risk, versus unknown risk letting contract tracing thing, there's real reward that.

I'd also add this, Victoria lockdown December NSW outbreak spread Melbourne Thai resteraunt. subsequently potential spread Airport private gathering 2021. Perhaps actual context outbreak change response we're unfair making decisions.

I'd lastly add, easy hindsight criticise decisions made. looks clear fact know things played out. time picture far complete.  Except wrong. Fuck it, let’s wash hands ever, shower, brush teeth. don’t seem see difference pledge. Yeah well, tried failed. Lol fuck asshole Social retarding kids worse guaranteed result keeping kids playing together sheltered inside. Masks young kids simply work effectiy

A edgecases kids allowed play others getting sick well worth social skills young age. seen friends year covid? That's... interesting yeah already pretty isolated moved city one couple knew kid. pretty stacked week going library, art museum, different parks different days. covid happened stopped. would drive usual parks see people one wearing masks. like even back lockdown happened. put caution tape around play ground lasted long soon filled like normal one, nannys, kids... one wore masks.

But without seeing particular example, sounds like someone venting self-empowerment style me. would say comments make feel better, especially considering feel like something take collectivist action ""end"". even understand thought process this. state getting hammered harder ever want tell people truth inclined listen. Holy fuckballs. read entire article? author citing debunked conspiracy theory fact.

""Given state's somewhat dodgy history around reporting numbers - potential whistleblowers **harassed police** state **suppressed reports** **medical examiners** \- underreporting seems much deliberate.

It’s awesome seeing young kids playing together.  think lot due airline industry. big carriers would crumble international travel stopped. Airlines throw lot money politicians lobbyists therefore... wait see. still large number unvaccinated people. It’s surprising many people work nursing home staff still vaccinated. Lol telling anyone living fantasy still obsessed Trump UK stats frankly contradict idea simply vaccine-caused.

&amp;#x200B;

Ehh.. doesn't? none things listed proves anything. actual \*experts\* field conclusion like weeks ago?

This post shows bias anything else. age group finally able get vaccine, it’s nearly impossible find appointment. I’m guessing it’s going least another month get mine this. I’m sick waiting seeing everyone else get theirs. “Are going trend downwards...” actually think vaccine rollout continues graphs continue point directions? mean true don’t crystal ball, I’m scale months writing wall. 

Not mention vaccination prioritization vulnerable populations means numbers March *not* compatible numbers December. graphic deceptive terms discussing situation evolving. graph hospitalizations deaths time much telling.

Edit: okay February March. December. point still stands, start looking complications deaths telling number rather overall cases since many high risk individuals vaccinated. I’m anti vaxxer (I’ve gotten almost every vaccine available me) I’d rather get covid Yeah certainly be. I’ve enough ruining kids socialization we’re getting lives back track. 

The media using kids fear monger try extend misery long can. offense taken...I like think first name Bork though 😂. I'm guessing media covering big thing that.

Ah OK. read comment able get earlier making point wait third trimester. That's great news. dont think unexpected, would terrifying didnt happen. 🤮 Even reality, imagine Trump started months sooner. might election. Stupid EU, God damn. lots unvaccinated due many states ridiculous restrictions place get them. I’ve Michigan last days almost one wears mask nose, except dudes wearing bandanas.  It’s surreal.  would said average started, feel like I'm playing straight man farcical sitcom. stop blaming politicians, period? talking ADULTS. warned repeatedly. educated thoroughly. insist taking risks, can't save stupid.

Dude making extraordinary claims, requires extraordinary evidence. Vaccine already passed phase 3 clinical trials clear people get clots rate elevated baseline.

It dangerous politically motivated decision stop using it, made pundits public health officials damage done apparent: schmuck getting voted spreading misinformation.


You know what's sure dangerous? Covid.

Ugh.

Let's leave science public health authorities. two regions part attaches cell. There’s many different shapes make lock pick stops able pick lock. dad anti-vaxxer majority last year election. 

Ever since Biden won, he’s loosened stance “I’ll get vaccinated need mask distance long, long time, even vaccine”. 

I’m keeping mouth closed now, turn vaccinated approaching, know need come kind compromise afford move out, relationship probably deteriorate.  Pennsylvania finally expected announce next steps vaccine expansion tomorrow! WHO-China joint report. need see. came PRC lab.  Kent. live GR. Ahhh. Thanks! need read words. Agree message too. Yeah proven vector definitely draw AZ me. get choice UK I'm hoping got AZ, least Disagree. Ontario completely dropped ball long term care homes. hope humanity right it’s capitalistic disposable ways. tbh, wanted 1 kid, wife wanted 2, are. would honestly probably kill 3 kids. Sorry hear. Idk county ur matters signed Ottawa. Maybe check surrounding county? Anyway I’m sure u get ur shot soon. Got first one today. relative general time long antibodies last ? 

Had covid November likely able get vaccinated late summer 

I'm hoping antibodies protect also can't rely either. current unemployment supplement U.S., people making work employed. Entirely depends % salary state giving course...  ""great immune system"" prevent person infected virus exposed yet? doesn't. 

Additionally, impaired immune systems often better SARS-CoV-2 infection people ""great immune systems"" whatever define as. instance, HIV rarely get severe COVID-19. CVID. Despite severely impaired immune systems. personally know least dozen people COVID. one symptoms past 2 weeks. One pass away it, evidence long COVID remainder! That's pretty much high approval go country polarized. Administering life-saving vaccine global pandemic make money anime event...... decisions, decisions.   government can’t enforce since three vaccines still Emergency Use Authorization it’s gonna likely way till US hits herd immunity.

That’s epidemiological end pandemic that’ll come kids vaccinated. Macron literally said AZ bad 60s... seems Sinopharm, Sputnik V Pfizer-Biontech dominant vaccines given Serbia 2021.

Only 150.000 AstraZeneca received, donated, lot spent past weekend vaccinating foreign citizens, likely expired.

Who knows, maybe we'll see rare side effect next couple weeks. case, limiting AstraZeneca use older people done precautionary measure, enough vaccines need vaccine hesitancy. wife said think citing lack long term knowledge especially regards desire kids future.

The correct response morons say this:

""NOBODY KNOWS LONG TERM EFFECTS COVID EITHER. INCONSISTENT."" may true. Doesnt change think likelihood Easter related increase unlikely. day name doesnt mean influences cases.

There Groundhogs day surge. Presidents day surge. Super Bowl surge. St Pattys day surge. Hell, many places significant Thanksgiving Christmas surge. Many states hit peak case rates Thansgiving even happened.

Easter doesnt worry me. Can’t wait. excited see that.  doesn’t really anything commenter said, might explain government sees older people getting covid dangerous (and higher likelihood) getting blood disorder. Essentially risk worth 60+ likely going die without shot.  read title ""north Ohioan"" 


Holy Moly. take vaccine blood clot risk (reportedly) 1 100,000 take risk virus 1 1000 risk killing you/severely debilitating you?

Do realise stupid sounds, right? 

You folks bad anti-vaxxers point regarding AZ. happening?  FDR would've cool though He's right Ted.  Almost 3M AZ used Brazil single report. lot...lulz  vaccine changes dna think I've past year Stadium capacity wouldn’t matter vaccinated like 85% adults. everyone attendance vaccinated. people say Germans sense humor  think Trump cancerous piece shit world.

But still, say much. better Biden took right time. study day showing people got infected got vaccine crazy amounts immunity. Probably worth get shot. Also, would active immune system likely cause keep antibodies longer. currently 5 variants concern, zero variants high consequence, *despite likely close billion cases worldwide*. 

I’d say 9,000 cases day Michigan pretty insignificant.

And best way stop chances mutation overwhelm vaccine. problem vaccine distribution allocation proportional population state percentage total US population; irrespective actual demand, demographics, political affiliation trust vaccine. imbalanced demand/supply, thus states supply constraints frustrated residents. Feds really ought weight adjust factors determine actual demand state. already road antibodies show it, damn near entire social circle well.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's bit funny, I'll give read. Fauci saying unvaccinated children shouldn’t playing together, least without masks. That’s going snowball whole lot post-vaccination restrictions adults must “protect children” something barely affects them, one willing acknowledge fact.

So. TIRED. sure mean countries? US, that’s like right too. Whoever built map visualization US must drinking time. They're stating limited evolutionary paths, rather plausible antibody evasion maximized E484K mutation. course, way early tell, theory. tired depressed due contrived narrative then.

Normal life stopped murky government forces. stopped deadly virus. 

The fact kids vaccinated massive massive plus. means achieve herd immunity easier without getting higher percentage adult population. probably achieve goal people stupid. actually pretty standard viruses. weirdest thing new us, immune systems massively varied responses based antigens we've seen before, initial viral load, location infection, etc...

Most things explained fact exposure before. agree. Seems soon  Good news front Pfizer submitting vax FDA emergency use 12-18 age group. hopefully relief sooner think! jabbing current rate 70% US adults end May may seeing shots at-risk kids even sooner! lie people forgive Good discussion. That's works, yes. something effective, people go it. due certain political affiliation. avoid AZ vaccine making appointment? want clotting. says vector immunity isn’t important

Well that's vague also proven issue. bet wait two three months, antibodies vector drop.

That's AZ's vaccine administered protection basically increase all. Anyone username references Ayn Rand immediately discounted serious conversation. It’s never worth arguing cult member. OK, bear me, joke post.

Last March contact someone who, two days met positive diagnosis.

Some time later, partner daughter lost sense taste smell. members house flu like symptoms, mildly.

There absolutely zero chance us avoiding infection one others. house small distancing impossible. 

Virus testing was, time, unavailable, proof except evidence symptoms, proof seems pretty incontrovertible anyone else we've told.

Now here's bit might seem like joke post. 

I definitely caught it, right? There's way infected. covid, covid, possible symptom was...

Ecstacy.

For couple days rest house height suffering recognised symptoms covid, felt bloody terrific. Better, mentally emotionally, months, even years.

Can anyone else relate? reports confirmed asymptomatic infections people actually feeling BETTER definitely infected covid?

It's incredibly weird agree anyone disbelieves story, I'm telling that's happened.

So, tell I'm one got particular incredibly weird feeling. People die sleep time. sleep guess. 10 million believe, another 6 million early April. 13 million Covax First ""all populations risk vaccinated normal life resume"" ""every single adult child needs vaccinated even start thinking taking mask, let alone normal life"" countries keep coming lockdown early? Pfizer vaccine available UK? Excellent, though surprising given amazing efficacy current vaccine! Annually. 8-10 100,000 rupture, half killing grandma isn’t worth seeing movie  data dates criteria still easing mode yet? goal posts moved? half doses currently produced EU countries exported - that's even counting COVAX programme.

That sucks (as citizen EU country), course, wider perspective probably better - forty-something asthma several autoimmune disorders - wait bit means dose could go elderly Japanese man diabetes Canadian woman serious cardiovascular condition - two hypothetical people live countries import EU-produced vaccines, they'd likely die (even I'm likely die get seriously disabled average person). goes flu coughing sneezing? times I've flu even get bed. zoonotic transfer story would frankly compelling ... closer relative found in-the-wild last year-and-a-half people looking.

Not sure point is, since explicitly pointed comment seem disagreeing with. something contribute though, please do. They're busybodies. 

Why R&amp;D investment count manufacturing distribution proven rate limiting step? UK invested heavily paying dividends. Could rapid test actually sticks then? Promising hear it’s already rolled people percentages higher

That... percentages work good point It’s less think. 90% kids MMR vaccine access/awareness ideology. It’s ones tend really really loud it. Hell yes.

Many countries outside UK first targeted vulnerable targeted exposed high transmission work environment - like teachers, transit, grocery store workers, police etc...

Eh, kind agree. think going nearly bad anything happened last year, seasonality, variants, people coming hiding cases areas quite bit.

I think vaccine cuts 20-30 days, think fact younger people means hospitalizations result lot less deaths. 

Possibly warm weather existing immunity cuts bit sooner, seems cases begin rise usually takes months play out. Lucky vaccine, going reduce hardship causes order magnitude.

Rather thinking ‘how educate them?’ question pessimistic: impact would severe lack immunisation societal move herd immunity?  adults living adults immunosuppressed becoming eligible vaccines April? little man 3.5 fantastic. I'm proud smart is. Assuming mean first shot, you’re pretty shit luck unfortunately. You’ll get regular old covid. I’m sure would delay second shot all. advisable healthy 19-year old get shots pfizer vaccine? side effects expect? unrelated note, public data Sinofarm vaccine effectiveness, since country majority? mother doctor works covid hospital avoids coming home without mask two doses Sinofarm father. need calculate yourself. 

EU comprehensive overview EU rollout/uptake, 80% today. okay touch someone outside household again? 


Even things ""open"" last Summer, everybody advised still keep space people physical contact no-no. 


It year since even hugged anyone age (I live parents) incredibly isolating. vaccine, although Amazing; however predicted last year two. permanent solution works going become like seasonal flu shot? (Indiana) state done REALLY good job imo. aged based vaccine rollout first responders, healthcare. starting today adults 16 + get vaccine. 15% fully vaccinated already. got mine late December breeze. got email signed easily. parents, uncles, BF vaccinated. Honestly, healthy living habits common sense, know getting twisted it. want unhealthy, regardless pandemic.

Also, ""walk sunshine"" completely different effects depending latitude time year. larger amount air pollution near you, could actually make covid worse. actually one size fits there, larger message could get lost. yet Singapore use Sinovac vaccine program. Citing lack data thought too, also guess. limited understanding, Johnson Johnson somewhat similar AZ vax, maybe one watched seems like slam dunk way get 70% vaccine willingness 90% promising end mask distancing mandates.

""But 10% still unvaccinated they'll lie get wear mask!""

 said people understand overall results population level important controlling outlier behavior.  Even get infected? mean fall 5% infection breakout group getting vaccine catch covid can't spread people? We're bit worried house receiving 1st Pfizer shot we'll receive 2nd shot Pfizer. two reasons this:

1. studies efficacy mixing two
2. needing travel home countries soon safe so, one countries speaking requiring ""Vaccine Passport"". clear mismatched jabs recognized purpose. get second dose tomorrow.

""April fool's! actually lethal injection!"" Nice Overall deaths per capita behind Czechia, San marino, Hungary, Montenegro, Bosnia, Belgium, Slovenia, Bulgaria (also Gibralta that's bit cop id say 9th) don’t call terrible twos nothing. Good. labradoodle soon stop wearing mask. I’m currently working one symptom free testing sites I’ve received first jab astra much earlier would otherwise (being 19) suffered pretty badly side affects days. I’ve heard rumours regarding potential permanent side affects later life said vaccine example fertility issues. evidence prove this? anything going done investigate coming months / years? Thanks work everyone else done far! answered like 4 questions…what even AMA? important question obviously ignored it. surprise amount people vaccine work (remember, 100% effective) would probably dwarf amount people can't take vaccine, too. 

Overall, though, benefit transmission levels community really low, wearing masks month speeds time, what's big problem? Senior living facilities also reputation really underpaying workers, no? Perhaps also administrators, maybe paid employees worth employees already work wouldn’t much power rejecting vaccine expecting keep jobs. even doctor required proof something, would sent back line (which area open now). got first 5 weeks ago. made appointment, showed up, asked job reason medical one, said medical, let through. 

Different places might want doctor's note experience. BMI qualified shot. lucky enough schedule first shot couple weeks ago. tell people I'm fat. like anyone looks thinks wear size small. I've struggled manage weight life point, I'm proud despite pandemic loss bike commute, actually lost five pounds - friends gained weight. 

Feeling bad weight realizing people think ""obese"" going make coronavirus back off. Feeling bad weight going save ICU bed, know get really sick I'm going say, ""well, guess fault, I'll stay home die, saving ICU beds slender"". Feeling bad weight make easier family died make easier partner got long covid work. 

I'm getting shot condition makes likely get sick die. people respond saying, ""well, elderly father totally cool disability death got sick accept terrible person fatso deserve shot, also fat defines total value society"", that's problem. 12-15 year old trial Pfizer 2 doses. rate we're vaccinating people (with even MOAR vaccines expected approved next months), 100% capacity allowed every NFL stadium across country fall, something gone catastrophically wrong either virus collective nerve.  I'm actually starting feel bit hope beyond country getting ""fixed."" We've ramping production vaccine much we'll start supplying lot world it. Depending goes could go long way toward whipping us back around America world looked pity 2020 America world looks again.

Hoes mad, hoes mad drip countries banning it, re-authorizing it, re-banning it, limiting it, etc.

And forget citing outdated efficacy figures part efforts get US FDA approval instead getting publicly called US data monitoring board. Ah, right, forgot that. Would good countries though, Curevac covid vaccines need stored extreme cold. Normal fridges enough, hope export less wealthy countries, hopefully funded international community, try minimize mutations... Shhh, tell CDC...  main downside 

I would disagree say upside several reasons.

The first eggs one basket.

The second local people experts locality. know things like road closures, weather patterns, hospital systems, local pharmacists doctors, etc.

The third different states different needs. 

The fourth bottom almost always beats top down.

This great piece highlighting state level strategy beat federal wrote patient 0 miine really point thread, would bet money Democrats going ram HR1, gutting filibuster process. think people agree much everyday things like going movies someone lives area large latino population, nobody failed them. Generally seem care take many precautions groups. We're going vaccine passports anything like US. see vaccine restrictions really happening either government private entities. fact substantial evidence contrary exception small boutique cruise lines likely catering senior citizens anyway. said months. getting stuff? Sure valid question. paid £300 rabies vacc want AZ  I've saying couple months now, ""regardless Texas includes Phase 1C, Phase 2 'everybody eligible, get appointment'. Phase 3 'get CVS whenever they're open, like flu shot' "" things life 100% safe...

but thats ""small calculated risk"" logic people use avoid using masks vaccines first place.

if simply wants one vaccines... let ffs. theres need shame people would rather use different one. Americans realize hoax, good 👍 them, got mine Friday, keep faith people  ! sign live Oregon; Idaho closest state would eligible. I'd rather wait weeks make 8 hour drive. UK's data directly contradicts German data, probably issue vaccine itself. want it. I'd rather go bout days wearing mask self-isolating means inject something good chance making sick. know hit vein? bleed more? GSK plants world vaccine production largest precovid vaccine related revenue big pharma companies. 

GSK, Merck, Pfizer, Sanofi big dogs vaccine world back 2019 order. old Novartis vaccines business part GSK.

One thing come partnership/licensing GSK lot production good thing. states going back adjusting, think anyone tune 19,000. Also important remember Florida one going back looking these. still 3rd party.

They've misrepresenting % positive pandemic tho, shock anyone Yeah paper many Europe actually! permanent vaccination commission. confused temporary one actually ambitious goal, clear time would able meet it. poster trying rewrite history make Biden look less successful actually is. I'd argue insinuating whole hell lot, actually.  role Fc region play here? And, chances antibody titers starting wane health care workers already natural COVID infection? ADE, right? Please tell I'm completely wrong...? Need get 6/9 case fatality rate case hospitalization rate COVID lower influenza populations &lt;18. hospitalization rate among children 5 17 influenza standard year around 40 children per 100,000 children. COVID-19, hospitalization rate 6 per 100,000 children ages 5 17. like inside tomato, something gone horribly wrong. American, bringing tear eye. guys nice things. Kids may never vaccinated. 

Being approved age group isn’t foregone conclusion. risk children Covid minuscule vaccine essentially zero serious side effects approved age group. single child significant adverse reaction trial could sufficient scuttle approval. 31 cases? explain women disproportionately affected? Seems strange that'd reason consider things also mutiple countries seeing pattern. Ohioan's vaccinated, tested positive COVID-19 died. According ODH.

No offence OP. It’s called confirmation bias. They’re looking things probe preconceived hypothesis. objectively looking see hypothesis true Stick marvel movies then, dumbass. bit paper trail Florida deliberately delayed death reports cover spike ahead Thanksgiving. point scare influx people going holidays. 69.420% 6/16

Nice. get shots, go life, wear mask get plane viral vector shit still circulating widely, so. Probably avoid parents two weeks get back that's case. I'm frustrated anybody else, pushed wedding back twice point, I'm certainly itching get back forgetting ever happened. 

It's data daily infection case rate says over, get tired fed up. totally understand businesses people hurting, way life requires economic activity that's suppressed past year. really big lift keep wearing mask even get shot expedite end shit good. know many people reduced platelet counts vaccination since nobody testing it. know severe cases. what’s preferred goal guys dissatisfied vaccine goals rollout USA? administration set 100mn goal December ambitious time. okay complexly control world. EU signed contract fixed amount delivered vaccines. doubt contains anything pointing “but got cheap, contract terms wont met”

The UK could paid 100x EU did, EU still paid bought vaccines, another customer fine paying overprice problem. He's wanting az cos others vacc people think like what? haven’t watching news, vaccination commission (STIKO) German stopped vaccinating men women 60 AZ. 

No idea anyone younger would prefer AZ, like one shot like Johnson &amp; Johnson non fatal side effects efficacy better others, unfortunately ton 60s left needing vaccination. get AZ right-wingers tells Florida cases lower equal state (California) rates. left already drooling idea getting big business big government everyone's personal medical histories.

And right would drooling idea well Trump still office.  It’s always absolutely atrocious. Ran private companies, mates family MP’s, hugely inflated costs, terrible results failing contact appropriate amount people. app terrible doesn’t work properly millions spent got vaccinated. Gotchya, thank you! Hopefully ramp updated vaccines quickly. translated DeepL:

""Haas: No, interim results yet. course, study accompanied so-called Data Safety Monitoring Board. means abnormalities occur, investigated independent board, decision made whether study continue. far, surprises. expect results second half April."" Put tinfoil hat away Agreed. lot people subreddit would call 1% increase 7 day average another wave. Vaccinations rolling fast increase hospitalizations likely small blip. also seeing increase brief hospitalizations quick discharges. true new wave would hit hard fast ever increasing number people immunity. Tis danger single story. country live in?  “We chose state let people take responsibility decisions, instead appealing authority. can’t that.” They're really known smart wording/actions....  I'm telling actual reporting shows, someone Three half years now? What? That's research done. called scientific method. hypothesis. tested hypothesis. unable reject null hypothesis official numbers matched reality.  

How else propose research without hypothesis testing? I'm 1 11 retail store w lots customer contact. outbreak early December vacation. 8 11 tested positive..almost symptomatic. I'm 2+ weeks past 2nd shot. stands now, one else plans get it. Location: Louisiana exactly EMA said press conference, think difference us due difference population vaccinated. everyone chooses take vaccine instantly confirmed anti vaxer

Chances many cannot would love take cannot medical/phobia reasons Got 2nd dose Moderna yesterday 22 hours ago. Arm pain slept off. Arm feeling somewhat better today, easier move around. Still fatigued, got bit headache, legs aching now, started period today. fever. guys think ok take acetaminophen start feel worse? got vaccinated Moderna yesterday side effect got sore arm. Today, I'm perfectly fine is. Unfortunately, people feel way try keep convincing mother. lol. Paywall'd here. Yes, I'd like go see movie, yes wait second dose done doings. don’t bad case blood clot COVID. absolutely idea school like deaf hard hearing. Well course would UK started using months EU did. doesn’t seem like fair comparison there, want backdate guess?

The way phrase article think deliberately makes sound like EU sent Astrazenneca UK rather use themselves. 

Not U.K. started making vaccines U.K., using EU even approved AZ. Australia, New Zealand, China Singapore also pretty well 😁 encouraging, please give jackass governor ideas giving everyone half dose... evidence states dropped mandates somehow disadvantage? 

People still free wear masks really concerned safety get KN95s make investment. 

This feels like political posturing. yesterday today's numbers would done yesterdays number plus 7 day avg, 1.7m. 1 million. data went in, today's projected number vs actual went 700k (which expected low dose days) causes future days decrease. data fridays Saturdays come in, rolling avg, numbers go up.

Hope makes sense.

(Also 7 day rolling slightly decrease, compare weekday weekday) LOL. know literally next nothing Cuban real estate market googled. Here's first article found topic (not cherry picked means):

 ""Housing (along public transport food) one Cuba’s never-ending problems. “Housing Cuba’s greatest social problem,” academic Carmelo Mesa-Lago states.

According Ministry Construction’s figures, national housing stands 3,824,861 homes, 39% average poor condition. Late last year, deficit stood 929,695 homes, figure clearly increased tornado hit Havana they're nailing it. hell happened england? spike protein completely mutate. certain amino acids spike protein (located RBM RBD portion spike protein) need change vaccine becomes non-neutralizing. It’s obviously less risky return normal two weeks second dose, it’s also understandable people risk tolerance allows satisfied taking risk two weeks first vaccine. 

Next thing know, someone going reply say “why would ever emerge home 2 weeks second dose wait booster even higher efficacy!?!” UK can't job furloughed government pays 80% wages (it's complicated that's gist it) Honestly think aware going prevent lots flu infections infections. never really thought much room someone sniffling sneezing, people would always come work sick unless extremely ill, I’m guilty myself. basic awareness really help got first shot Moderna yesterday today I’ve felt fine besides sore upper arm, 24 hours later I’m starting feel kind tired feverish.

Now know completely normal side effects comes vaccine, usually show time frame? dad got couple weeks ago developed side effects 12-13 hours later, everything I’m reading says around 12 hours so. see anything said scientists believe chance long term heart issues seriousness long-term effects COVID-19, Dr. Cooper says early say. ""And that's disease has only existed around one year. need large patient cohorts be followed for longer periods time know whether COVID-19 increases cardiac risks, as arrhythmias. way previous poster insinuate that. get snarky he's enemy pointing something obvious?  7-10 cases day could contact trace, isolate, fully remove Covid circulation humans. Pretty darn cool. Yeah difference young people getting clots. can't compare 90 year olds dying cold young people whole lives ahead permanently disabled killed.  even one vaccine maker deliver said would beginning? NO. Yesterday sub lauding UK's track trace system. today we're back saying shit? Proud aunt going anti-vax, conspiracy believing kids still getting herself. Typically she'll go cousin says something finally drew line on. 👏👏👏  kids probably means more.

I childless friends leave house days time. parents trying make things work kids. means soccer practice, school (if open), playdates, etc... We're using vaccine shipments fast get them. actual distribution problem. Fauci saying kids isolate interact. wear masks. Thanks! went boat ride Florida mask mandate ages 3 up. 3yr old wore entire 5 hours. 🤷‍♀️ Good news Pfizer already [began kids 12 younger great hear.

Fingers crossed everything goes smoothly get vaccinated. Bad idea. virus could circulate back house HVAC vents.  It’s getting boring right time. guys understand country's accomplished viral specialist giving advice ideal course action would look like based scientific knowledge time deems appropriate give advice?

He saying absolute truth want minimize risk getting infected continue wearing masks. like it? wear mask, nobody forcing you. prepared certain people private businesses want associate you. right.

If nobody world anything curb spread virus, we'd looking hundreds millions deaths, instead millions. He's telling best practical method keep safe things re-open. tell fastest car one horse-power, can't afford one horse-power, get it. surprised get laughed race-track Prius refuse let compete. mean small percentage people right thing..

I'm still furious large number friends carried worst pandemic.

At end day think best family data have.. vast majority country shit neighbor. decided infallible everything basically god   state fear

It's possible take precautions without living state fear. instance, kids wear two years

I can't find evidence saying this. comments specifically current case number plateau. also said expects kids vaccine first quarter 2022, less year away. feel you...my 2 year old biggest anti-masker know smh hear someone expounding "" telling truth"". ivermectin hydro stuff. told house along vitamin d, e, c zinc.. also informed got vaccinated last Monday. control only, anyone live with. significant wants go Mexico get sputnik v "" that's one trust "" sigh. big fauci guy, needs know stop talking. It’s fear mongoring point, we’re getting shot atleast want it, even mention kids wearing mask outside friends til 2023 insane chief executive, Albert Bourla, told Reuters March expected younger teens eligible coronavirus vaccination autumn primary school children end  It’s like kids completely immune virus. stronger immune systems adults, still get really sick healthy, plenty cases perfectly healthy young people almost dying virus. saving lives making kids remote school. thank you! added!! I’m sure point here? argument literally try vaccinate many people quickly possible prevent trivial. Astrazeneca intends seek approval. layman's terms equivalent. There's nothing mislead unless intimately familiar process FDA needed issue clear guidance on.

Stop pedantic.

Nobody cares. Ok hypocrite. often force kids wear masks skip social activities flu. Nice see someone bit sense here. believe done lab. cancel culturing anyone believes theory. problem lot credible people including work CDC worked lab testified fact yes, possible. got former CDC director spoke possible Peter Daszak interview youtube mentioned easy do. turn, means done. given high fitness function signs point lab. People afraid admit Trump wrong association want admit wrong 

lol like 15 recently demodded powermods ran interference trump last year subreddit. Remember give flu vaccine kids young 6 months.   4 yr old sadly used wears mask 7 worry 14 yr old. house wearing his. Kids daycare age don’t seem spread much, maybe don’t get Ill? caught it, one else 3 year olds daycare (the kids don’t mask there) tested positive, thankfully! took one quick google search claim. 

Nice try. honest people source claims don’t pretend they’re saying true. able go school Shall fold sub automod sticky fuck every post * Made herd immunity understand. bad call. agree. Part recent pattern.
* Two masks - same. 
* mask - understood given pressures time. fault there.
* AZT - really tuned one contemporaneously. Generally speaking, don’t like Fauci they’re using misleading quotes make sound like they’re reasonable ones. 

Kids won’t able get vaccine anytime soon wear masks least next school year. (un)reasonable eyes clearly means he’s encouraging child abuse... AAP said get go kids need school person even frustrating couple months ago b117 growth seeing, push get everyone upgrade masks. Instead released disastrous ""double mask"" theory work extent, practice people breath vague exactly make work.

The US want maintain massive stockpile N95s healthcare workers average people told get them. also want normalize foreign standards like KN95s etc. ended One Pfizer One Moderna vaccine getting double registered guess, got pretty sick second shot, ran 103.8 fever three days. googled lot mixing find much info. supposedly ""okay"" considered vaccinated. Anyone else get mixed vax know anything scenario? I'm worried curious. They’re probably gonna ad campaign grieving parents lost kids Covid saying “this far over”. Thank loving parent caring children’s health. like people US ever that, nope, all. Fauci show everyone wearing mask big deal wearing one 24-7. rarely wears one public appearances. easy tell others wear one yourself. STFUFest 2021. hear there's gonna death metal there. First, lot read article plenty getting sucked head grabbing headlines.

""Dr Anthony Fauci said vaccinated parents still need careful allowing unvaccinated children play others.

Speaking CBS’s Face Nation Sunday, Dr Fauci said ""children clearly wind getting infected"", play kids despite parents vaccinated.

He added ""when children go community, want continue wear masks they're interacting groups multiple households"".""

This first part article say... 

No article Fauci mentioned kids play together vaccinated. Furthermore, stated cautious children keep mask different community groups.

In article linked CBS Face Nation. Go watch haven't.. said video 4:16 children still get Coronavirus, interacting groups multiple households. said interviewer asked question related children playing groups/communities.

Conclusion: stop getting sucked headlines research. rocket scientist thought couple hundred cases would make look bad, everything power ensure millions would occur. Best comment far. factual statements, yes, however things says opinions backed anything. Telling vaccinated people need still wear mask, intentionally lying people factual statements backed science. I’m glad I’m person noticed this. Let’s pretend mind could changed anything did. 

However items easily confirmed computing device care spend time. That’s choice make. always hard time making worse decision different races choose respond differently. would like present data basing recommendation on. publicly available data shows widespread public health risk unmasked children co-mingling. going make claim presenting data justifies it. 

Let’s start really easy one. outdoor transmission rates masked unmasked children age 12 prolonged close contact? Snore... people still take guy seriously? Smh misinformation. Virtually STATES excess covid deaths. Florida actually higher average covid death excess death ratio LOL! Straight defensive. Found lazy, helpless parent. God help anyone gets stuck Target you. Idk man wear mask anytime go out, I'd rather shit covering mouth nose times to. default position mask face, really anything masks ""political"" Fully agree, shame news media that. KNEW going happen, going new excuse keep people (kids, etc) inside longer.... hopefully people put think misinterpreted statement. I'm talking risks associated vaccine, incredibly low compared many common medications. lol pound sand fauci  live pro-lockdown state 50% people 50 don’t follow mask mandates outdoors includes kids.

I know something norm doesn’t mean what’s point measures nobody complies to. 

California’s useless Winter lockdown showed public “hard public health response” isn’t anymore, aggressive measures waste political capitol point. Ty much caring fellow man unlike OP.   Yeah unless tie kid duct tape everything everywhere 3 year old wearing mask long. current vaccines fantastically well designed hopefully control variants well controlled OG COVID, evolution tricky, uh, dude

This virus fortunately mutate quickly many others... yeah, much want push luck? We've seen handful dangerous variants many cases, many like willing see? Give SA variant billion hosts become? Okay lib I’ve lost trust yes, thank you!  really strong flu jab? Like really strong. thank god That’s literally would happen. think another country give food people starve asinine. No, I'm talking actual risks vaccine vs. benefit. case, risks still incredibly low, lower regular birth control women take, think pulling vaccine right choice. already reached point teen suicides went way year. 2yo bad separation anxiety I’m sure he’s truly never away me

If ever raised puppy, concept. Keeping constantly giving zero room explore *causes* separation anxiety.  kids wears mask public place except parks shes 3 years old. personally make wear mask park 90% parents pa perspective. choose mask kid playground 1 simple reason carbon dioxide. Running around carbon dioxide produced waste product needs removed properly. like oxygen, carbon dioxide is transferred blood carried lungs, removed breathe out. Daycare 1 case covid kid. kids wearing masks. You’re full shit. I’ve wearing n95s since august. I’ve got quite enough stock weather whatever comes. (God hope directed me...) Babies can’t safely wear masks. It’s strangulation suffocation hazard 2 Masks another piece clothing, get kid wear pants, probably get kid wear mask, since schools still requiring lot places worth working on. course exceptions kids different kids wear masks practice. kid exception sucks let's real, also lot parents even trying assuming pointless first time kid takes mask off. think neither required banned. available, businesses choose whether implement. kids young don’t seem spread much definitely don’t tend get sick much (may related). We’ve known decent amount certainty since last summer. fucking clue Fauci saying sudden. kids 10 less deadly flu fairly decent margin. adults vaccinated kids allowed kids without judgement. sub get taken morons? swear happened pretty quickly. suspicious Ah bad. Sorry man, misread it. :) Variants evade vaccines evade immunity. There’s little selective pressure virus become less virulent fatal, given long latency period infection symptoms.  anyone know look expiration date first Pfizer dose received? Registration second dose requires expiration date, printed card, lot number. Moderna lookup tool website, luck Pfizer.  He's also saying ""SHOULD"" wear masks, nobody forcing this. He's 100% correct scientifically wear masks limit risk transmission. People allowed make decisions, Fauci's fault he's giving expert opinion scientific public health problem. 

It's professional opinion middle-aged human people wash hands use bathroom. hafta. I'm saying hafta. Sometimes wash hands either, okay. Keep Junior locked attic? First EU charge this, countries within EU should.

Fuck, states less autonomy countries within EU, even states vaccine policy. Welcome American politics. Everything politicial. get annoyed experts TVs saying can’t socialize go stuff 60,000 cases way high bad situation “impending doom” stuff. you’ve fully vaccinated (like me), can’t go stuff especially light data released yesterday showing real world efficacy Pfizer/Moderna Maybe use different anti baby pill UK?
Other odd UK show ratio.  Yes. thought like that, makes sense. Thanks. I've holding tickets cancelled june 2020 concert rescheduled apr 2022.

I going concert. taking refund. Nope. happening! That’s rest world feels reading dates like 06/19/21 trying work you’d need sunglasses coat go outside it’s 42 degrees (still idea)! bet fauci eats steak well done A1 think Walensky still job this? investigate China? investigating US Europe too. Believe not, US actually vaccinating anyone country, legally not, free - we're taking public health driven approach want everyone community protected immunity. Restricting vaccines based immigration status anyone good.

The requirement vaccination state printout web site answers qualification safety questionnaire. staffed clinic vaccinated it, ID never checked form. insurance, even bother collect information.

(In states, need show basic proof residency, like utility bill driving license, many others requirement.)

The greater challenge European would course entry country right - borders closed Schengen UK residents unless direct ties USA. Idk I'm slut bricks Always hinting restrictions, actually implementation. Ford thing months ago. could see wave coming mile away stuck head sand it’s late. Exactly. New Zealand says ""hi"". No. Case hospitalization case fatality rate measures odds individual contracts disease hospitalized die. doesn’t take account likelihood someone contracting disease. child gets COVID, would statistically lower risk hospitalization death contracted influenza. Weird like US EU switched places last year. Understood. already changed mind. Thanks. everyone fully vaccinated? No? yet.

You hold months, really big deal. big pharma level much interested running stage 2/3 trials, production marketing. whole strategy buy successful biotech idea.

Coming they’ll enough mRNA capability start division Pfizer exactly business model designed for. compared whites, like racism involved?

Asians California account 6.9% COVID-19 cases California, despite making 15.4% population. compare Latino Asian rates? Ok, buddy. Aw dude - I’ve worked targeted marketing, know well much data already floating around there. 

If can’t tell difference signals obtained users opting using certain services, law-mandated universal tracking program, don’t know tell ya. 
There’s irony - hope see distinction. goalposts. football game. everyone keep talking goalposts can't predict shit? thing track metrics implement mitigation tactics dependent that. firm dates. Hi, American nurse, question. give IM injections know English nurses trained related drawing back syringe injecting vaccine? Tiny chance could hit vein inject IV accidentally? England draws back EU not, might explain part difference.  ""source variant higher mortality?"". UK variant much higher mortality rate, extremely well documented. ""Likely 64% deadly"".  That's substantial virus already relatively high IFR. Surprised first heard it. Seems need catch up. far hospitalizations work, first come cases, hospitalizations, deaths. precisely we're seeing happen 20+ states right now. AZ interesting, pandemic assuming they'd frontrunner based volume positive news coming efforts vis-a-vis others. 

They've hit fairly serious hurdles though. first efficacy variants (specifically South African variant) markedly compromised relative others, there's also whole clotting possibility. gonna open NY everyone 16+ next week going impossible get appointment city next weeks. would consider traveling somewhere else car makes kind tricky Read something today concerning double mutation India. try around schedule vaccine look sites scheduling 2 doses. Many scheduling time since easier way. scheduling one there's decent chance giving J&amp;J could possibly call ask it. ask right way could get answer. ""The site letting schedule one appointment supposed be?"" Could yield answer gets information want. every vaccine find BNT-162b2, that's name vaccine candidate (BNT = BioNTech). Depending destination vaccine manufactoring company called BioNTech-Pfizer, Pfizer-BioNTech BioNTech. every case BioNTech it. Pfizer. would call BioNTech vaccine.  Cmon fl let us want get them. 28 waiting waiting. difference 600k dead 2.2 million dead. That's why. 600k completely avoidable. we've got find way start chipping away it

I'm really glad read comments. whole reason decided get vaccine one less barrier towards able see kids again. It’s almost like trump didn’t make political Well, guess talking germany BioNtech CureVac? 
You mean AZ fair enough, would take AZ day. anything, there's far side. recent thread literally dozen people facetiously say Biden shifting goalposts changing vaccination goal. sub conservative liberal rest Reddit. Aw, dude, hate break you, kind data mining already happens- obviously specific case, eating McDonalds often would theoretically increase weight blood pressure, could increase insurance premiums health risk goes next time get insurance-mandated physical. 

And I’m saying it’s harmful wrong, I’m pointing irony saying you’re something already support every time click post anything internet. No, need take precautions infections spiking Africa.

A lot people valid question point: strict travel bans countries spiking? sarcastic? can’t tell heard theory vaccine accidentally injected blood vessel instead muscle may cause strange blood clotting. person vaccinated low arm, (tiny) chance hit vein. Men generally muscular shoulders/arms, easier see hit muscle, could partly explain incidence women higher. trained nursing school ""draw back"" syringe ensure blood aspirated syringe, would indicate needle blood vessel. nurses others draw back vaccine injections, injection deltoid, people giving COVID vaccines States taught withdraw. 
Just thought vaccine rollout differs state state. countries worst rollouts, best that. cannot say certain regarding specific virus hasn’t enough time. know viruses generally cause long-term heart issues. default position assume also true covid unless given reason believe otherwise. understand policy, currently using supply even close (we spread 50 supply). case nurse let know immediately told expect withdrew needle. guess maybe aspirated bit, saw blood injected anyway. remove needle bleeds overall takes bit stop blood. Typically IM injection wounds small close own. hit vein blood come instead healing quickly. count 8 plus Washington DC.

Alabama, Hawaii, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington May 1. 

Delaware announced earlier May 1 well. Maryland April 27, every state April 15th earlier. 35% country terminally stupid. Understandable, least it’s consistent don’t feel like check time like Walgreens never know drop. Lori Arwady finally surging vaccine hot spots north side. little late, every little bit helps. world happened Europe?

The UK variant. Ah covid dumb ass freedumb sheriff thing. kind didn’t want country hurt economically Covid?)

Well, precisely.

For example looks theoretically ""open"" country, like USA, look early days pandemic Washington State, local health authorities CDC slow &amp; reluctant declare apparent community spread virus.

Literally country wants get labeled infected suddenly unable travel nations. least they're certain severity communicability disease.

The nation-state level incentives align ensuring global isolation disease. overcautious make public declarations, take weeks unwind restrictions might imposed you. late announce, always go version ""We known, sure, idea would this..."". Israel rich country? That's news Israelis lol That's awful, I'm sorry. heard healthy 60yo male dying day got AZ. autopsy find died from. Obviously people die without vaccine shot, I'm jumping conclusions one possible data point. proud asshole?

but good admitting wear piece fabric good community. #merica

there lot places reopening live life 90% used - keep distancing wearing mask. still go eat, go breweries, go park... y'all act like someone padlocked front door house. CDC director literally ditched script say FEELS sense 'impending doom' direction we're headed. mean holy shit, approved kind messaging? exactly help? exactly right rhetoric. forced resign due mounting deaths bad handling pandemic, solely buying russian vaccines. seem intolerable right wing parties coalition, anti-Russian sentiment strong among those. 

Which show wicked priorities Europe. 100 dead day country 5 million people? Fine. Russian vaccines? ""biological weapon"", per words one members parties.  actual cause death determined? couldn’t find explicitly stated. Also, added layer detail provided- aren’t supposed administer symptoms COVID? God.. Rest peace. five year old developed reflex-like habit grabbing mask every time goes outside. Honestly, think good enough job normalize kids, they'd problem it. kids alright. got confirmation today start seeing deliveries end April. think pretty big surprise, expecting wait June Canada get J&amp;J.  know much getting delivery schedule look like, ery good news us indeed expecting shipments start end April. There's nothing understandable take. absolute risk par winning lottery. 

This misinformed fearful response based fantastical outsizing actual risk involved. Welcome world guess. Americans don’t care goes outside country, don’t frame reference compare. Many people see vaccine came four months ago haven’t able schedule (be they’re still eligible unlucky getting appointment) consider failure. scenario lot people warned about? first/urbanized world essentially it, developing regions get absolutely ruined covid since vaccination rate high? Stop calling everything anti-vax everything critizing one specific vaccine anti vax, think back swine flu vaccine sometimes caused narcolepsy plenty problems past specific vaccine batches taken market weren’t worth problems caused. call everything don’t agree anti vax you’ll discredit yourself. got many wonderful vaccines, even driven sicknesses basically extinction really want part problem destroys trust vaccines overall treating scientifically neutral. Trust vaccines overall worth way way specific vaccine all! like vaccinating anyone 60, matter vaccinating anyone long mask mandates effect shutting environments virus spreads, sure. Otherwise, sorry, license cut front responsible folks. first dose moderna vaccine couple hours ago, expect?

Southeast Ohio basically Alabama already... People still fly confederate flags there...  know much Bayesian probability, you? Ok case would mention senior living facilities notoriously hard staff fired everyone refuses vaccinations tomorrow literally find workers replace them. hospital 25 percent reject vaccine. can't fire 25 percent staff - anyone replace them. unfortunately. I'm getting vaccinated. necessary endpoint mandated public health measures lifted. I'll leave here: I'd rather less ""competent"" leaders means civil rights. that's me. trial two that's they'll requesting approval for. 12-15 age group produce almost twice amount antibodies 16-25 group though. ran trail one dose might worked.

Take care there! Definitely valid point. case landscaper, I'd agree 100%. 

However someone responsible caring vulnerable patients, disagree. would allow someone refuses vaccinated work patient care. Things would terrible. nothing else psychologically lot hope. 

My parents, 70's, finally able hang group friends. fully vaccinated. got take trip spend real time together. amazing done quality life. around peers again. Germany 1/4 population United States. latter could, likely will, reach head immunity June, see Germany still worry reaching herd immunity end year November/October supply chain getting ramped up. pretty ""duh"" result, amount posts see people running around hyperventilating ""spring surges"" acting complex mystery leads think maybe obvious others. 2,200 teens trial, half got vaccine, half placebo. 18 kids placebo arm tested positive, 0 vaccine arm did.

Much smaller trial adult ones therefore less powerful, still fantastic news. England vaccines issued centres batches whatever available. One day could using Pfizer, next AZ choice get except certain circumstances 2200 people study, 18 placebo group got infected according study, exactly big sample size drawing conclusions Whoops, thought still /r/CoronavirusDownunder/ weird seeing countries go lockdowns get thousand cases per day open straight rather Melbourne Australia drive way zero cases open up. want that's last thing need... unfortunately Krispy Kreme around corner burned down. Covid: k im leaving call BS. Nothing 100% effective. may high number appear 100% smaller sample size remember kids already less susceptible serious covid complications. suspect end 90+% effective, still high efficacy.  What's issue vaccinated? point acknowledge reality situation: intensely important society many people vaccinated possible. concerns want get vaccinated, that's fine consequences. going take precautions fewer privileges safety society.

It's reason driver's license drive. one forcing get license objection, consequence fewer privileges (you can't drive). benefit society whole - driving safer un-tested drivers road, theory. make similar decisions time. discriminating group requiring driver's licenses? 

The vaccine free. convenient. making easy possible people. safe. rigorous review. saving lives. want get one fine, get privileges make tiny sacrifice (like driver's test) good society. following comment thread? sounds plausible enough cases appearing AZ vaccines? post would much better served going r/coronavirusuk  headline came across E*TRADE new feed morning 
Covid: Children “well-protected Pfizer vaccine” 

I couldn’t help laugh covid speaking us: 
Covid like “Ok imma head now......” Agree this, symptoms, don’t go vaccine appt reschedule soon possible, even though rapid test negative. theory perhaps, reality never happen. Contact tracing work well practice we're going testing everyone 70% people vaccinated. meant I'm trying insult *you* haha kind say since placebo shot 98.5% effective own. theory old loose waiting feting vacinated now, younger better chanse surviving covid therefore afford wait untill better researched and/or new/other vacinenis avalible Well yeah hospitalized tough get isn’t completely sure Finally good news vaccine supply EU! really get things moving; many doses countries blame suppliers actually delivering. covid something deal still live lives.

That's always case despite many government officials media members tell you. though? Young teens innately immune getting covid. They're much less likely severe outcomes. late summer keep insisting anecdotal evidence. 

I idea it, confident 100% sure thing 1 million chance didn't. doctors cared hundreds covid patients never got sick. 

The fact symptoms strong evidence actually it, certain. Thank you. End March, Pfizer-BioNTech deliver 67.5 million doses, Moderna nearly 10 million, AstraZeneca 29.8 million doses. EU expected receive 120 million doses end March AstraZeneca alone... here, I'm blue area state noticed CVS RiteAid scheduling sites although appointments available area, redder areas state plenty openings.

If anything, Pfizer/Biontech main vaccine used. already one supplying far doses, deliveries regular steadily ramping up. Originally AZ supposed main vaccine, production issues came way.

Even J&amp;J, CureVac Moderna likely deliver doses Sputnik V. clinical trials. Thank you. eligible due work one state weeks ago eligible state actually live, Walgreen's let change location second appointment tomorrow :/ Oh well, get bonus driving.  safe take vaccine, I’ve heard people say mutilates various ways they’ll develop mental health issues locked inside year half 🤷🏽‍♂️ I'm Michigan scheduled first Pfizer shot Sunday. I've trying weeks, signed multiple pharmacies, county health department etc. Heard nothing place signed with. 

I've also manually checking CVS RiteAid several times per day, finally 3AM today able make CVS appointment myself.

I parents 80s still waiting second shot.

Meanwhile kids' school keeps sending notifications infected students. past week 5 students diagnosed. Also, Michigan's positivity rate pushing 13%. Scary shit, we're race time. limited evolutionary paths? Scientists positing virus evolve much compromise fitness! spike protein go many mutations still allow attach human cells. 

You consistently misrepresent science subreddit. Yes, COVID affect children much adults/elderly, they're still carriers, we're still shy need vaccinating risk groups. 

Unfortunately among there's strain magical thinking comes kids COVID, equates ""kids dying like elderly"" ""kids super immune even COVID dribbling snot unvaccinated grandma, nothing happens Kid Magic""

That said, agree folks likely try push narrative ""we need vaccinate kids relax"", end enough adults vaccinated deaths/hospitalizations/cases minimal, political social keep restrictions evaporate. twitter fear bubble able manifest reality point. least thinking logically sound reasoning decision. Completely respect that.

What can't stand people refuse wear mask, social distance, get vaccinated ""muzzling freedoms."" right LIFE, liberty, pursuit happiness? Life comes first, required things common good. Imagine republican saying ""a law killing someone infringing freedom murder!"" different concept. agree give ""freedom"" safer. Curve ball/alternate headline- covid 100% ineffective young teens, Like said along? wait doctor employer reach you.

Yeah, feel people loved ones looking them. aunt (with help rest family) went rampage get grandmother vaccinated available. vaccinating kids now? Probably not, say wait always chance rapid test false negative even spreading infection others time annoying. Many people worry covid quarantine.

Since limited downside waiting feel better, see limited reason risk negatives. expected. Young people awesome immune systems, makes vaccine work much better.

Need get approved another cohort people eat supply. son COVID, wife never got it! Seriously antibodies stick around long immune system get ""confused"" start attacking antibodies wrote another subreddit: lol.

Germany fewer deaths pretty much every western european countries vaccination campaign line rest EU.

It laughing stock compared who? UK, double deaths? US basically given trying contain spread 6 weeks ahead vaccination campaign, much grand scheme things?

I think Germans really need bit reality check here. like incredibly important immediately become ""laughing stock"" everything incredibly perfect better everyone else. mean look around God's sake. Point country unquestionably better you.

I guess hope has/will find 'local minima', settle point. course disturbing (e.g. letting run wild partially vaccinated population) might kick local minima, allow search contagious/virulent form. Yeah that's goalpost shifting. Lmao question government authorities? Good god. Use brain. Unquestioningly following advice flies face data led make bad decision. blows sick mean layman question governmental authorities? say it’s unsafe I’m take never, country I've lived asked blood test anything basic medical history getting pill...the exact get vaccine. 

It's definitely shitty medical practice, agree pretty standard practice everywhere. See, thing is, really don’t care antivax people get hurt. They’re menace scourge society suffering result shitty actions. really don’t care antivaxxers get sick die. Private emails vaccine supply issues leaked within hour earlier month (during press conference health secretary less) concern expressed vaccine cannot see way government could suppress all. many labs independeNt. many people involved process independent government. taken great pride keeping schools open far longer country European Union, distinction Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer hailed “French exception”.

That's works. keep schools open keep infections bay, otherwise disaster beckons per article. matter exceptional think are. I've called one phase 3 trials getting first shot (50/50 chance CVnCOV vaccine saline solution) later today, documentation sent beforehand wrote they're aiming approval around early-mid june, suppose they'll probably apply late may early june account days EU decide. taking long asking approval getting (hopefully) due vaccine already rolling review. Figures Go giants Um...duh? Kids likely die flu Covid know didn’t use “phobia” justification antivaxxing Eh got backwards...the blood clots birth control deadly. 10s thousands caught released southern border - indication many ca. 10% positive carrying dangerous variant?  US Germany, big bois Trust experts? They’re unbelievably reactionary short sighted don’t even need expert see that. 

You know what’s important expert opinions? Data. data saw article read said 31 people experienced blot clots. 2.5 million. Quick math shows 0.00114815% AZ vaccinations Germany. Even you’re young health conditions chances getting hospitalized covid infection higher that. 

I feel like I’m taking crazy pills seeing reaction governments actually pause AZ vaccinations 31 fucking people.  way Since EU wants vaccine passport EU countries already using Sputnik V, seems EU must make official.  
All achieved wasting time till now, EMA took 6 weeks acknowledge Sputnik V application arrived. 
What think wonder? Pffft...no don't. get blood pressure check every six months that's it. Zero checks. I've lived world...BP check that's it. Here's pill, go, see six months. 

The teenage comment made bollix, go doctor complaint all...my periods heavy, pcos, endometriosis, irregular periods, bad acne, anything really...First thing doctor subscribes pill. standard first step doctors go to. I've even stupid doctor tell take break week sort periods got frightened insane periods baby. take advice. know plenty women pill cystic acne. source that? strange tho imho. course I'm sure UK better China Russia data sure trustworthy.  we've , UK, actually given fair bit 55 health workers vulnerable people. get seem like give AZ young people.  page 15 New York City (population 8.4m) hospitalization March 30th: 4715

The UK (population 66.6m) hospitalization March 30th: 3283

We basically **less** hospitalizations entire country NYC still lockdown bar/restaurants/gyms etc. open.

Why seem quite right? Lol Yes, true, example riskier taking flight. Considering many people get vaccines 1/62k rate, vaccinating 8 billion people earth cause 129k deaths (taking extreme case vaccinate people AZ around world). That's lot people there. 100% efficacy hospitalization, organ damage, death already known Well alternative screaming void it.

Not sure what’s shitty rollout, it’s like doses going unused right now, they’re going soon get them. 

Obsessing “right” people getting shot would lead unreasonable delays verify everyone’s information. Meanwhile doctors nurses refusing vaccination. So... benefits then? Looks like paid thing, getting it... reasoning really it’s bad enough multiple governments trust don’t want go it, I’ll trust experts. mean trust country’s government right seems assume none 30% natural immunity gotten vaccinated. Where's shot true. doctor confirm fact. Read comment dummy Honestly feel better chance winning lottery getting blood clots astra Zeneca vaccine. would anyone consider FL model example state govt. beyond me.. Based vaccines administered past 7 days assuming supply issues - Based age, (You're JCVI band 12 (same me, Hi band buddy 👋)) could expect receive vaccine sometime April May. Given first doses administered April, it'll probably late May early Omni Calculator decent tool although 100% accurate 100% time, give rough idea - Also, either slightly early bang estimates family members. making points, lmao.

Since dont want waste time leave this.

  enough fully vaccinated people going things. absolutely fully protected people, please go see movies theaters eat sit-down restaurants again. make irresponsible person whatsoever. I'd imagine blood clots due sort interaction vaccine, immune system ACE2 expressing cells circulatory system responsible amongst things preventing blood clotting inside blood vessels.

Might immune system NF-kB pathway heavily downregulates expression ACE2 receptors leading increase angiotensin-II affected cells consequently coagulopathies? First thank hard work.

Many countries decided teachers high priority vaccination, UK not. first priority group finished first? constantly contact children playing together everyday. start loosen Covid lockdown numbers cases children raise make teacher vulnerable. covid shown us anything restrictions eased science medicine rapidly progress. makes wonder lot current diseases i.e aids cancer could possible better scientific breakthroughs restrictions eased also. Maybe organisation want restrictions eased reason. exactly accident. They're stock photos exact purpose lol someone literally surrounded classmates work Disney World daily (well normal times anyway, online classes - study theme park management), tell Disney, least according people I've talked to, might telling entire story one... English come mostly mainland Europe they? Vikings Germans. love hear consistent protection. remember read study? I've looked many times hard find real studies vs journalist saying ""you're protected variants"" without sources listed whatsoever.

I read study oxford's website tested 2 vaccines + natural immunity claimed 3 fared reinfection variants. find actual study aggravating.  Greetings, thanks this! Across pond US, getting increasing number Covid breakthrough cases. UK identify next step assuring vaccine safety efficiency.

Thanks! vaccinate young people again? Apart huge profits Pfizer course. 
It makes scientific sense whatsoever. 
Anyone thinks it’s good idea hand experimental clearly dangerous vaccine young healthy people, truly lost plot. 
What 99.95 survival rate get? may pass mothers fathers robust immune systems. Dafuq? Shitty guess. selfish that? trying eliminate global pandemic not? I'm saying taxpayers decide vaccine. sharing vaccines recipes world. Pharmaceuticals already got paid work. really granting intellectual property rights publicly funded R&amp;D make obscene profit misery suffering entire global population? Fuck. That. Shit. Thanks work!

Previous bad flu pandemics last century seem lasted 1 2 winters. think chance pandemic mostly now? 60/40 az now, Pfizer first weeks big dick vaccine Would ever take paracetamol? far likely adverse effect vaccine. mum (55;F) recently (about 4 days ago) received Moderna jab side effects like headache, fatigue fever-ishness. 

Is anything look worried taking second dose ?

Thanks. Don’t worry downvotes cuban family well cubans know Miami understand you. Redditors don’t know fuck talking about.  Crabs bucket really huge relief. felt hopeful second dose. vast majority COVID restrictions potentially lifting end June seems logical many closed venues currently used vaccination centres (theatres, sports grounds, community centres, etc.) would want return original function. affect vaccine rollout, particularly yearly boosters needed? 1,907,577 people fully vaccinated Ohio. group, 34 ended getting infected. 0.00178%. group, five ended hospital. 0.000262%. 

What numbers receive vaccine? Also, that's counting really recent vaccinations. small percentages population would gotten covid extremely recently anyway. really department provide answers vaccine make sure safe convince people take :)  far apart infewctions? I've read (and I've obessively researched times) true symptomatic reinfection infections positive tests very, rare. work clinical research industry - normal. proven safe adults, move minors burden minors’ trial focused SAFETY opposed efficacy. efficacy safety critical course, number one concern safety intervention minors, smaller sample size acceptable.

There’s course lot nuance this, vaccine trial extremely different rare disease trial example, jist it. No, it’s not. true (or more) case person dying vaccine stupid internet rumours anti-vaxxers cause panic? 30,000 hospitalizations that’s insane. That’s insane Vaccines surged Michigan (and already happening).

Michigan slightly US average vaccines received per half states vaccine distribution long Michigan continues using least 80% vaccines. Nah keep shit away America. Hard enough get people take vaccines now. got first dose Rite Aid street house yesterday. scheduling appointment ever 3 minutes 8 9 8 PM. reasonable margin error/breaks/whatever they're 200 vaccinations day. Around can't drive 5 minutes without going past another RiteAid/CVS/whatever pharmacy, overall lot getting done little little. don’t blame them. We’re told listen experts rather making emotional conspiracy-related decisions. That’s tough call. bunch experts saying something, trust random person internet? 

Now, personally? genetic condition predisposes clotting. lived country AZ approved, I’d want *my* hematologist give go ahead got vaccinated. live US though wasn’t option wound getting Pfizer week. (For context, clotted birth control 2007 nearly killed me)

I don’t think it’s crazy say, “I trust people let follow say now.” look citation, found support claim ""manipulated"" lab. use different citation support virus manipulated (handled) 2016 sequence data. 

This incorrect scientific terminology. ""Manipulation"" would mean virus genetically modified. ""handling"". case, everytime someone takes throat swab test COVID, would claiming manipulating virus. Posting I'm wondering anyone else experiencing metallic tastes result vaccine gone away yet.

Some background:

I got 1st vaccine shot (Pfizer) late Feb 2 weeks could sworn outside lips tasted slightly metallic like would chapped. went away day so. Second shot week half ago days ago, basically inside mouth tastes metallic.

I symptoms Dr. Google would say would indicate liver kidney disease gums red bleeding, however I've seen search results come back people recently vaccinated Covid metallic taste.

The thing add pretty upset stomach first second dose lasted week. (The type get really bad cramp first day, next several like gnawing sensation) - went away time probiotics/yogurt bland foods wondering taste result somehow catching Covid shortly first dose (and stomach issues Covid), maybe possibly have/had GERD also apparently cause metallic taste. I'm second week taking Prilosec metallic taste still kind hanging around.

It's frustrating could many reasons started recent vaccine. took rapid test yesterday came back negative. suppose could get antigen test next see recovering actual Covid infection. many damn variables play causes anxiety. Guess else causes metallic taste mouth? Anxiety. Sigh. point also sometimes wonder psychosomatic I'm simply focusing much.

So again, anyone else vaccine-related metallic taste mouth, I'd love compare experience peace mind. (Of course goes much longer, I'll get check doctor.) Got parents signed get vaccinated! entire household fully vaccinated May 1st. overjoyed. know much less long term effects covid vaccine. parent I’m much concerned child long term effects covid mRNA vaccine It’s absurd comments local news station FB page posted this, 80% comments people arguing bragging wanting live world void vaccines. still ton shame coming #maskup crowd. got yelled couple weeks ago mask on... outside riding bicycle. 

It’s folks made #maskup new identity get me. think best strategy combat misinformation fearmongering vaccines may lead people refusing vaccinations? could get vaccine 70+ year old dad 2 months.

And involved 2 hour drive get appointment, 2 hour drive back.

And next month.   still bugs media vaccine pretty much says natural infection amount anything. started talking vaccinating easing restrictions work brought natural immunity immediately shot CDC ""says count."" WHAT?

I may get vaccine sooner later shut hoping 5 months immunity got vaccine. Personally never believe anything 100% specific point disagree with? big fan Castro brothers? NY NYC numbers today, relief plateau uptick. One day doesn’t make trend holds happy. TEENS teens often symptomatic contagious. rather similar adults regards, except don’t get seriously ill. 90% less transmission note yesterday, think good spot.

Younger 12, start getting hazier grayer area regarding transmission amongst kids. correct I'm wrong rule 77% lower 95% time, there's still 5% chance worse 77%? since I've taken statistics class. 34 positives 1.8 million vaccinated pretty damn good imho. 

It could tad misleading without questions context:

1) what's percentage Ohioans tested positive time frame gotten vaccine?

2) percentage 1.8 million gotten vaccine got recently, less time exposed covid? that's counting people got last week....then people simply tested positive COVID last week even without vaccine. even time happen, would still 1.8 million number. 

3) vaccinated population different non-vaccinated population (i.e. less likely contract COVID first place?) think meant reply /u/Sc0tty2h0tty76, post.  sad, lmao. mean, there’s reason people love horror movies zombie movies... people like scared. Actually, went phone call vaccine two weeks. rest time verifying safety effectiveness. hope right, feels like got lucky last summer screwed winter! cases trending upward past weeks would nice see decline even majority people inoculated. yeah people pushing zero covid... Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Hey! callin' ""middle-aged?"" exciting fully vaccinated mother 12 year old 6 year old.

I still careful kids vaccinated. 12 year old signed school sports next year likes theatre arts. I'd feel much better extracurriculars he's vaccinated.

Hopefully, younger age group right heels teens. Ha kid going daycare mask whole time. exposed wife nothing happened. wears mask go stores I'm sorry he's wearing mask play. damn late that, especially 75% parents sons daycare medical workers know two Covid floors. people want continue reason want vaccines fail. recommended Ivermectin? Bear me, I'm going ask potentially dumb questions, think they're worth asking.

It's pretty well documented point disease affect younger people way elderly people, especially 65+. Especially kids 16, death rate incredibly small (something like 99.997% survival rate).

So vaccine exactly? protecting disease they're already susceptible to? prevent spreading asymptomatically? thing think would helpful rare kids high risk health issues.

And hit downvote button instinctively, please realize *I'm asking questions*. allowed ask questions science. happen people choose take vaccine?  50yr old friend got sick fuck it. Hoping one cases really want getting part 2 shot now. appreciate time taken reply albeit really doesn’t answer question supply. I’m aware guidelines. Got one right much worse 2. little ideas plans now. also started toying around lying get wants what’s great 100% statistic calculated comparing number infected placebo trial number infected real jab. 100% ratio 2 numbers great moved Florida 2017 lifelong Mets fan haven’t seen live since (I live near Tampa). I’m excited they’ll May! I’ll fully vaccinated! I’m buying tickets soon go sale. I’m even considering going Miami following weekend see there, Miami bit iffy right now. Remember everyone, safe effective! blood clots nothing!!!! 😂 Pfizer announced 100% efficacy ages 12-16. Thanks work!

Do idea many people UK level immunity, whether vaccine infected? enough start ""slowing spread""? going stay away unvaccinated people vaccinated? fear isolation restrictions, even precautions normalized kids won’t even know different. grow insufficient communication social skills. don’t care anyone says, masks social distancing diminished cordial neighborly interactions humans. Vaccine rates anything FDA recommended typically 70% children though. prediction time FDA full approval COVID-19 vaccine ages, rates higher children adults.

Unfortunately hardcore anti-vaxxers typically escape clauses cases, vaccine hesitant population large. Even escape clauses, things like pediatrician school requirements absolutely get rates higher children specifically. Even pre-vaccine you’d 10% chance catching it.  Attack rate quite low, even households infected person infects 20% household contacts.  Workplace setting like 5-10% (depending close people specific workplace).

Being vaccinated bring odds around 1%.  odds serious illness lower still.

Of course scenario playing 1,000’s times across world unlucky.  need quarantine test. you’re probably fine.

Btw - I’m sure you’re planning getting tested, could soon detect infection occurred weekend.  I’d give week least. (Your local health department might specific rules test.) Ooof. Aged like milk. heard they're terrible move out. confirm, child. may seem obvious us logical, well-informed people, anti-vaxxer golden boy saying exact opposite, important say.  Boy dont know trust Reddit buddy. Id personally keep appointment get second shot without hesitation, thats me. Keep mind, know person responding college educated adult bot 15 year old. Well there’s things, also doesn’t seem best health though. Trump isn’t healthy dude either stretch it’s nearly visually apparent watching him. possible someone whit 2 jabs Sputnik contract Covid anyway? happened aunt, seemed strange. Certain variations country affect clotting country variations? They’re gonna cite “x kid died Covid” “y kid got long haul symptoms” get everyone another year. 

I don’t even think they’ll let vaccinated adults aren’t around kids live normally then. People get spread COVID selfish assholes. Many contract spread work also socializing people (yes even pandemic) human nature. I’m going set kid fire keep someone warm. I’m happy keep kid home sick, though! 

I’m terrible person. point immunocompromised kids always existed one cared. Schools germ cesspools flu dangerous kids covid. 

Kids allergies get table - don’t even ban peanut butter many schools...and that’s actually dangerous kids.

Statistically, even kids health issues aren’t particularly risk covid esp compared average adults. believe conditions syndrome heart issues.  son turned 2 February he’ll wear mask time takes reach little hands yank immediately. ain’t happenin one. one said anything us would honestly laugh face. Good kids wear problem. Like many said, every kid different. Keep wearing mask find permanent cure flu next words guys mouth Keep pandemic keeps rolling put restrictions. child vaccinated

I'm even sure he's saying much. article video even say outright.  bad animals get :-/ 5 yr old, 3 yr old, six month old. wear masks take public areas I'm fucking jagoff. worry little think tries speak less mask on. Good kids compliant complain follow line. advise require children 5 wear mask. think would ridiculous continue requiring younger kids mask, especially majority adults able vaccinated Haha what. seen studies effects kids? It’s good something want sign child rest lives. Cope. sure point relates comment tbh. mean yeah, everyone doesn’t get vaccinated it’s likely new variants crop resistant current vaccines new vaccines need developed.

Our current vaccines fantastically well designed hopefully control variants well controlled OG COVID, evolution tricky, uh, dude (original word censored bot) there’s telling might happen future. less people operating COVID vectors, better. r/Coronavirus arguing expert opinion. Great.


Yup we’re fucked. heck  it’s not. comment misleading. applied thus course approved US. apply, (quite likely) approved. supposed avoiding unnecessary travel, even vaccinated. Stop going vacations, full stop. hear ya. Good you. I'm single dad raising two young boys own. work COVID, able work since. lose job due COVID, got screwed unemployment benefits, even PUA even requirement, work history last year can't work COVID (because I'm homeschooling kids).

Just January school opened hybrid person, opted keep kids home. 75 yr old mother lives want getting sick and/or dying crud.

I'm Michigan cases hospitalizations spiking opening 5 days week. WTF? least weather nicer get kids local parks playgrounds beaches soon. Wait, stop wearing 4 masks go 3 2023? 2, mask daycare. 2 wear mask day unless eating. state requirement Cherry picking one paper dozens automatically make right. telling child might get ailment 60 years old? Color shocked pretend save one. actually saving anything. suck parent. right president fix economy

President's role co-ordination, execution, leader cannot make difference, team incompetent. quite true case organization. father kid turned 2 day office closed last year due Covid, absolutely keep masks on. son’s entire preschool filled 2-6 year olds wore masks every single day day long. Saying otherwise cop parents teachers wanting enforce it. California matters. find gross boogers stuck inside sons mask every day. get hand wash clean too. Yay?  think really depends kid/s. Mine okay already homeschooled started. moved back home home state 5 months ago, they’re near grandparents &amp; family again, wanted anything. hang couple friend’s kids masked outside (friends doctors kids attending in-person school). talk friends old state video kids messaging app play games online. look forward seeing old friends coming weeks months. friends kids traveling stay us month summer, we’ll getting together friends weather allows. 

They honestly aren’t upset trouble it. couple years older (they 12, 9, &amp; 16 mos.), think would really, really tough, kids fine. buy 1 donut $1.10 piece... got 10 donuts, normally would cost $11. store offers discount/deal 10 $10.

So end buying 10 save $1, even though really need 10 times calories also don’t need advise get kid wear mask ask it. 

Yeah, obvious trying. Good job raising even selfish twits.  must since say doesn’t spread schools really need real journalist age fake news clickbaits.  old kids? won’t find one isn’t completely delusional. flu killing far longer 10 years, continue far far future. Rona allowed run course, likely would one done. yes, would say flu far worse. \~10 100,000 people US die every year traffic fatalities. 1 100,000 people experiencing severe reaction vaccine large risk. Exactly. Try u Asymptomatic transmission far less common people think is, lol. agree number higher flu agree number absurdly low compared number kids US, like freak accident levels Dangling carrot continues. going isolate 4 year old

The article kids wear masks, isolating them. Fauci (along CDC) pushing resume in-person school article sounds like he's also giving OK kids play together adults vaccinated. thought I'd comment since wrote this, husband appointment April 7th, sister CA got first shot. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 thank optimistic people :) you’re conspiracy theorist nothing change mind.

You're literally commenting thread peer reviewed publication well respected journal shows excess deaths 19,000 2020 14,000 thought COVID-19-related. somehow makes conspiracy theorist? anybody conspiracy theorist here, likely really said anything debunks what's paper rather whined include California paper Florida...as big conspiracy targeting Florida.  Also r/VaccineHuntersWA region specific sub covid vaccines. tried making 5 year old wear mask? Kids age still eat boogers. Good luck. Thanks reply :) Use vaccine spotter refresh every that’s got appointment reporter Akron, OH study counties reported Covid cases found one biggest counties started underreporting Covid cases fall. result report, Ohio corrected number include roughly 30% deaths. What’s risk going policy? Children experiencing symptoms cases severe reactions extremely rare. people risk want vaccine risk, vaccinated. trying stop point? Even raising cases U.S. hospitalizations still low. sure don’t kids wear masks. 3 year old entire school wearing mask since went back school June. coming guy year ago said didn’t need wear masks. actually wondered effect widespread mask wearing gonna social development young children, especially toddlers. pretty interesting. That’s insanity. NYC consent random testing mandatory in-person school. really hope stays like quick reopening creating playground new variants. That's all. think health experts really ignored mental health aspect pandemic. director’s message super negative recently “impending doom” comment. Even though think right concerned, impending doom can’t headline leave people 1 year pandemic vaccinations really picking up. Could imagine would literally cause social behavior problems depression? children do??? Getting back normal means ignoring CDC. 

There’s much guidance CDC puts one cares about. 

According CDC woman child bearing age isn’t birth control drink alcohol *might* pregnant. 

Federal food safety standards say cook steaks least medium shouldn’t eat runny egg yolks. 

Our rapt attention CDC past year aberrant, soon enough we’ll go back normal. mean, every school day day barely ever complain. Parents way upset kids are. 20 year old COVID seems kill 1 10,000. Now, really good enough data say much drops perfectly healthy, even drops 10x, vaccine still preferable risk profile.  state fired whistleblower saying undercounting COVID-19 deaths thousands, refusing screw data?

Who could foreseen this?  poetical ironic cared supporters’ lives would easily election. “3 easy payments $9.99 - plus! Free shipping handling! Act NOW! Operators standing by!” 'Pound foolish' new variant every year two people need get vaccinated companies make money on? Even 2 year olds know wear masks kids it. It’s truly easy.  ridiculous. I’m sorry he’s insane. risk death child infected SARS-CoV-2 0.01% according official numbers. However, considering total number children infected probably undercounted factor 10 more, odds death astronomically low. hand, damage isolation even masking done children’s development substantial well documented. probably 2022 children 12 vaccinated going make live like nine months everyone around gets live lives like before? basically wants treat headache decapitation. Sure get rid headache cure far outdoes problem it’s absurd. trust Fauci wavering ever since whole herd immunity debacle another blow that. Nice pedantic distinction. must missed memo. kids happily sleepovers playing friends pod since May without masks covid. unsolicited ""parenting tips"" reddit laughable.  masks completely ruin childhood years? risk level high, rush vaccinate children? risk children lower average flu year, heck, children exposed risk car accidents covid.

It's silly, unrealistic, unscientific demand children wear masks social distance adults full access vaccination risk necessitating so. main reason children wear masks try mitigate spread age groups exposed higher risk.   IMO developed countries far herd immunity end 2021.

I currently stay Philippines 0.5% population vaccinated, expectation year 30-40% vaccinated most.

Same goes Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Iran, African countries, Myanmar, Cambodia, Papua, etc etc etc think anyone forgot, like they're concerned. bad variants, would time stock N95s. People let mask mandates, vaccine breakthrough, better mask on. might fly shelves again. not...use work around house. Win-win son 6mo I've thing. physically cannot keep much longer. Fauci insane. Going repost another redditor applies article well

Probably cleanest way verify death numbers fudged look total excess deaths - year year vs. COVID deaths can't (easily) hide dead bodies, even accurately classified.

The NY Times solid data topic another article at: Florida shows 35,000 excess deaths vs. 30,000 reported COVID-19 deaths. roughly line national data (556k vs. 484k), I'm sure much death hiding states (ahem - Kentucky, Oklahoma, California, WV - showing least 30-50% fewer COVID deaths total increased year year deaths). anti-science position? know masks work slow spread COVID-19, know kids spread diseases play together (and spread back adults), know COVID worse health outcomes kids flu. also know kids still interact, build relationships, learn social-emotional skills wearing masks.

I'm also convinced ""until vaccinated"" part headline true since neither video article actually say that. Good stuff Next week. call Publix pharmacy 2 hours closing. day looking someone take leftovers. accident comes light DeSantis says Florida participate vaccine passports. I... never said that. fact stated pretty clearly didn’t agree coach. care accurately representing science unfortunately made exaggerated claims supported research. 

The figure athletes suffering heart disease covid nowhere near 5-15%. Thousands athletes every single one fully recovered. 

And no, way confront novel things science drawing baseless assumptions comparing similar phenomena well studies seeing apply new phenomena. would never say myocarditis covid serious health problem myocarditis viruses not, unless given evidence is, have. 2010 census counted age groups 10-14 15-19, 20 million.

I might try put together I'm nervous would date incorrect information. it’s somewhat callous attribute obesity solely “poor life choices.” 

Stop it. Stop making excuses this. fat poor life choice vast majority people. Even eating disorders need seek help solve those, poor life choice.

But also pretend people fat due eating disorders. people fat put fork. call callous want saying it, know true. 

And personally know true whale. 365 pounds. **100% fault absolutely one else**. ate much, ate terrible things. me, fixed it.

I understand hard make changes needed. I've done it. making excuses easiest way continue fat rest life. Even ""eating disorder"", *still* fix nobody else.

Stop making excuses fat people. dare use money excuse, either, eating healthier *cheaper* eating fast food pre-made processed garbage learn simple recipes. misinformation, check cdc website. one spreading wild lies cant still carry virus infect others already vaccinated What, like this, idea obese bad people?

I really can’t count “good news” group vulnerable deadly disease. saying sure, cautious. need know days showing symptoms spread full 2 weeks, asymptomatic spread it? Theres lot unanswered questions. good reminder vaccination provide 100% protection, public health officials keep saying people still wear mask, still socially distance, etc. we've vaccinated population. That's odd. Vaccine sites running around clock, basically 24/7.

Are running half capacity lack vaccine supply? read article? certainly couldn't. 

While clickbait headline seems shocking, could lots legitimate explanations discrepancy. example, counties equal distribution vaccines, ""higher rates"" administration could well due factors like access transportation.

Could contribute problem? Sure, lone reason surge, buy it. Ah, sorry, actually completely misunderstood original message. reread see mean. way hell venues requiring vaccine passport. They'd lose much business.

It would require young people regularly invasive test.

I vaccine. want vaccine passport, particularly used track way. addressed concerns. dismissed them. stop. evidence vaccinated people spreading virus (in fact evidence keeps coming contrary). Additionally odds hospitalized COVID-19 post full vaccination effectively zero people. Stop spreading disinformation. good reasons fully vaccinated individuals lead completely normal life. Writing headlines irresponsibly always crisis going get people killed. Probably already has. It’s tool, solution. it’s used together things like masks, distancing, etc another layer protection help stop spread. PCR tests 20% greater false negative rates depending timing test exposure/onset symptoms individuals location virus (nose, lungs, gi tract, etc), well sampling technique get specimen. Herd immunity nonsense without vaccinations. called letting disease burn population kill everone.

And youre gonna need provide reference getting vaccinated. I'll wait really get vaccine passports would bad thing. Especially compared masks social distancing closures.

Of two, give me.vaccine passports. opposite, soon Biden elected ""US good, EU bad"". Exactly going say. definitely sucks kids struggling missing part education, I'm sure last year felt MUCH longer us, kids highly adaptive pick things go back normal. bet time next year, even remember pandemic life. also might related superspreader status well since obese people tend breath air per minute healthy people.

I also understand countries giving everyone, considering risk low enough. can't understand country (Spain) doing: Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J reserved 65s, AZ 65s (they confirmed policy yesterday night). absolutely makes freaking sense data now, taking account plenty unvaccinated 65s Spain. Hopefully change direction I'm aware country still this. Wrong.

Refusing passport us, us accept vaccination if/when one offered us. choose say passport becomes requirement, effectively rule entering pubs, clubs, concerts, sports stadiums, etc, *reasons*, cool.

Since doubts (especially people literally dying) controversial. Contrary vaccines I've vaccination card included lot. Maybe different vaccinations produced different places batches?:  Sith deal absolutes. multiple vaccines, still fully effective treatment. Easing restrictions help, seems making vaccine easier identifying treatment. mean minimize breakthrough vaccines, already multiple vaccine platforms. challenge replicating virus's spike peoples' bodies could learn respond it.

Doing stuff alone highly underrated provinces going back lock down, region based response local positivity rates icu capacity. vax reduce symptoms? reduce spread? people, especially here, would claim vaccinated you’re good go. need mask, social distancing, closing events. 

I think eventually need mask, social distancing, go concerts/games/venues. need case curves flatten people vaccinated. doubt we've entered fourth surge many parts country, even surge ends small. Atlantic actually good job sensationalist pretty optimistic article. 6 times high blood clot even know linked vaccine.

In 20-39 cohort, September 2020 US hit 30mn cases, 3200 *known* hospitalized COVID infection, 20% ending ICU. 3200, 3% (over 90) died COVID. Never mind long term complications post-infection risk posed spreading virus others. invested per capita R&amp;D stage, thé US UK also dumped billions production facilities. surging separate populations due population groups vaccinated

Who would've guessed? 


Still, nice see someone actually acknowledging differences articulating workable solution instead telling people panic. kind message needs coming CDC CNN places visible influence. Everything helps exponential spread play. There’s way temperature check anywhere close 75% accurate detecting covid. TSA intended temporary? [Here initial bill Fall go show indicates agency sunset provision expiration date. forgetting curve didn’t flatten two weeks, necessitating longer lockdowns. Nobody fun lockdowns. Well live state like Wisconsin legislature controlled anti-lifers governor necessary protect lives. admit legitimate addiction unhealthy food/binge eating battle meal meal basis it’s something I’d say 90% fat people would admit having.

Been done that. fight every day. still excuse Would labeling “good news” title “alcoholics” “smoker” instead?

I'll say it. Yes. Covid mostly harmed smokers... I'd rejoice. means rest us make poor decisions (and smoking poor decision) would much better off. I'd even take smoking overweight one major reasons, smoking ridiculous, stupid decision least sympathize people overweight. 

The logic applies alcoholics like swap smokers. I’m understanding argument correctly (which may be) he’s arguing 80% statistic overweight covid hospitalizations correlation, causation roughly reflects obesity rate general population. He/she removed children bump obesity rate general population fine. Finish thought... rest population already vaccinated? 2.5 year old brought COVID home daycare last year. low grade fever like six hours it. wife got - put ass couple days one day, 4 year old never picked (or asymptomatic). told super minor we're good thankful, kids even bat eyelash. running around full energy wife dragging ass. I’m glad analogy resonated you! good post! reading comments, seems Germany dumped money development stage vaccine creation, spent lot less production stage. It’s really unfortunate feel German people. WTF. get call people follow science racists. DGAF makes vaccines, efficacy. makes sense trajectory US would follow Chile rather Israel vaccines using similar Israel. 90+ percent effective vs 50 percent effective makes large difference population level. obvious CCP troll. Ha, felt like got punched arm moment pharmacy tech jabbed me! rougher past experiences flu vaccine techs.  Gonna drop important many people possible get vaccine, since effective Yeah, feel that. Plus many bullshit ""get skinny quick"" schemes there, people get discouraged. actually works amazingly straight forward, takes commitment emotional energy. 

Anyways, lost 40 pounds COVID happened gained 38 back. people lose significant weight gain back I'm sure know. I'm ""time put money mouth is"" camp lol Use vaccinespotter.org website agreed. Using abundance caution wording correct also sending misleading message.

This is, far, likely scenario. information use moving forward. link media written story? studies empirical evidence I've seen says statistical significant findings all. Get 30 percent Americans want get vaccine, get it. US single country? send Brazil first tbh. global health perspective seems like smartest move. Cuba amazing country. Republican president, headline would absolutely different. Cleaning: Look ultrasonic cleaners, often small jewelry. (Per quick google 40-400kHz)

Parking: I'm guessing referring distance sensors. air based sonar. Example: Look HC-S04 fairly ubiquitous beginning electronics. (To note 40kHz devices. sure frequencies marine/naval sonar, see anywhere 10-600kHz)

The article refers 25-100MHz frequencies effective, look like things easily used is.

Other uses include welding (15-70kHz (not necessarily ultrasonic^1))

^1 Ultrasonic generally considered 20kHz + (but that's related hearing hearing loss. Also try test hearing online, aware things (audio codec, headphones, wireless headphones especially cut certain frequency. recall one cut almost exactly 15000 Hz. Looking documentation found something-15kHz.) issue UK somebody would piped now, country 65 million people million work government. can’t hide something big long, it’s possible somebody wouldn’t go papers saw money it.

The NHS, JCVI MHRA data this, I’m sure moment they’re happy seeing. I'm bit late got mine hours you. dealing significant arm pain, really helped move arm/shoulder around lot. tylenol ice pack huge relief too. Mine terrible, enough bother I'm trying sleep.  67% effective, wonder second shot would improve lower variants trials?

Any vaccine good, actually deliver. think we're talking thing.

In countries Europe, found statistically sifnificant increase certain pattern clotting (cerebral sinus thrombosis). incidence much higher would expected background probability. Cool.. thanks Apparently rebranded sold new name now. free (to patients least -- government insurer pays) places U.S., too. typical, think NYT would devote big story specific hospitals? story crazy unusual. vaccine 100% chance zero side effects please let every government know buy it.

There side effects every vaccine medicine, trial ever large enough find every single scenario. aware killed children, put others iron lungs, put callipers legs, left difficulty walking life. still 140,000 measles deaths year children 5. 

Older people Britain high covid vaccination rates understand benefits vaccination. Children dont know lucky are. know whole story would prefer believe politics involved here... especially life death.  

But say definitely seen clear break many people UK received vaccine, age sex. incidence rare blood clots there. 

If vaccine makers/policy makers want tell people ""it worth risk"", need open risks are. 

The problem faced big one. countries need get young people buy vaccine safety. young healthy need reason think vaccines might give rare blood clots brains, instead getting cold like symptoms days Covid. Statistically, exactly opposite saying. want look statistically prevalence blood clots vaccine vs general population actually lower studies already showed. want speak statistics, worry all. why, speaking statistically, scaring populations reason. yet US actually giving people vaccines Germany still struggling work old folks rest us stuck lockdowns. Twitter definitely worst

At least Facebook find go looking friends post thankfully none people I'm friends lost plot yet

However Twitter hard avoid. news site trending subject find them. YouTube comments quite bad well vials could pure cianide basically Australian would harmed yet... England recommended draw back injecting dorsogluteal muscle. Israel keeping social distancing / mask measures caution. see pictures streets Israel, people even following guidelines. vaccination works everywhere well working Israel, least social distancing thing past. Fauci delusional thinks kids wear masks get vaccinated. Shut-ins thread saying mean isolate, wear masks iTZ bIG dEaL gUyZ. Guess what, implying safe socialize without masks, harmful message spread. encourage abusive parents already isolating kids vaccinated. one kid like wearing masks, socially ostracized shut-in vaccinated ? seeing full faces peers whole two years, ramifications that? 

However I'm glad see people taking Fauci's words gospel anymore. ""Listen experts"" zealots happy lol. Listening mean religiously following say ffs. research estimate risk act accordingly. important point though. think people don’t realize dormant conditions exist, generally people get cascade failures flares bodies flu, car wreck, even tick bite. conditions either genetic developed time diet/life choices. introduce foreign invader promotes immune large adrenaline response, end awakening condition. know well, upon getting Lyme Disease plagued Lupus gluten allergy. conditions already me, small forms, probably wouldn’t seen 30s otherwise, 16, experienced suddenly severely. Vaccinations promote immune response. vaccines made brightest minds world, structured around system (mRNA vaccines) theorized formulated far longer existence Covid-19. people believing vaccines blame reactions ones say “it’s 1%” neglecting near negligible % people severe vaccine reactions. time alive, sheer genius innovation side-by-side willful ignorance. Anyway, agreed, assumption valid UK offered vaccine younger people yet listening, German government? U.K. could manage EU could have. think Taoiseach meant Doctor absolutely start taking aspirin randomly whim random Reddit comment. cause problematic bleeding used specifically indicated. Younger people haven't. girlfriend 20s never it. think stopped sometime 00s. recently article Italian authorities found AZ secretly storing vaccine doses earmarked exported UK)

Are talking 29 million doses 13 million going Covax scheme 16 million EU countries? UK neither those. think 0 covid pipe dream? vaccinate enough people herd immunity kick in, 0 covid deaths really achievable... sister 38 healthy, died last may. Covid destroyed lungs. parents fully phizered second shot 6th. wish could made now, family would still whole, also wished lived state treated seriously. I'm still waiting able Google inside brain. disappointed, 0/10. hhah yeah would nice. I'm 5'8"" feel bad 6'8"" colleague. 

That said, issue become less relevant years flew work. Pre-covid averaging 300,000 butt-in-seat miles per year. became United ""Global Services"" finally started treating nice. 

Unless flight completely oversold often raptured first class prior boarding. others least economy +. 

Other nice perk getting picked jetbridge driven straight connecting flight across tarmac. Made travel tolerable sure. Children 99.99997% safe covid according CDC figures, shown covid vectors entire year research thing. hypochondriac Yep. Even nearly everything else terribly wrong, acknowledge actually least one good thing.

Also, may outright antivaxxer, certainly shouting rooftops people get available. fair though, there's subset supporters get even personally asked - antivax mentality runs rampant evangelical Christian world. goal never back normal vaccines come lol. back normal reach high threshold vaccination keep caseloads/hospitalizations/deaths even full reopening. zero indication we’re still trajectory. Even face surging cases hospitalizations NJ increased outdoor gathering indoor gathering capacity. states going sometime near future drop mask mandates. restaurants stores back 50-100 percent capacity. Summer camps open parts country. kids either back school going back April. You’re getting mad people Twitter don’t actually control lockdowns. you’re talking outside US maybe US isn’t position anyone power (governors) actually hold. Stay strong! great feeling. I'm \~ 5 days 1-shot effectiveness kick in, hot damn exciting. doubt it.

who went hospital sniffles?

even did, who'd testing Rhino?

&amp;#x200B;

all last year: ""not covid - go discussion lab based results only

in vitro suggests worth looking population-level data shows relationship

except masks stopped flu happening (as usually does).

there's ""relationship"" year... could problem - know strains include flu vax next year.

&amp;#x200B;

i suspect masks also stopped colds.

&amp;#x200B;

**This year's flu season virtually nonexistent. could bad news next Scientists may struggle predict flu strains dominate next flu season—making challenging create effective vaccines. Good One theory Ace-2 receptors plentiful children elderly, I'm expert reading months ago. It’s lack funding - mantra political left Uk though. employs vast numbers administrators non medical personnel tick boxes move paper around. It’s hugely inflexible precisely centralised bureaucratic. needs reform anyone suggests gets shouted accused privatisation/sell off/cuts etc becomes politically impossible anything meaningful. left totally wedded current model right terrified accused dismantling nobody really looking improve it. lots European models work well could learn lessons - probably won’t. 

I wish rhetoric wasn’t always “our beloved NHS” American capitalism. plenty options provide universal healthcare without inefficiency bureaucratic behemoth now. whens da children vaccine coming out? pandemic aint till got don’t. CDC experts do. that’s consistent guidance point isn’t something new, it’s reminder, worth hand-wringing. less personal risk stopping spread younger age groups. Remember, June/July 2020 TX AZ FL saw second wave. There’s seasonal this, it’s people close together. Like hot summer indoors. sure assholes.

Just day nice morning stretch sleep weekend (like 9:30 10 instead 6am) 

Had massive Charlie horse cramp thing leg thought going die painful.  think understand vaccines work. fully vaccinated 3 vaccines chances severe outcome (hospitalizations death) effectively zero. infected COVID would extremely mild case worst (akin common cold). remember smackin head shit quite often nary bruise. please stop calling ""Pfizer""-Vaccine?! Pfizer man middle - BionTech-Vaccine! guys invented - Pfizer throws money interested satisfying clickbait clicking it, I've got question read it: article talk whether folks got infected weeks past 2nd dose? past first jab? ""Two weeks flatten curve"" meant exactly - letting constant number people keep getting sick, long hospitals swamped.

You're saying ""flatten curve"" bad goal first place. Perhaps was, change goalposts still moved. &lt;the covid coming inside thinking weather! forgot take vaccine hypochondria hear you. 

I thinking employer ""incentive/bribe"" employers high-risk fields like medical. non-vaccinated staff could potentially open healthcare provider large liability. pure greed/self-interest/risk aversion perspective, behooves employer implement measures. 

For landscaper much risk need vaccination guy trimming bushes face-to-face high-risk individuals 600 times day.

I agree government giving incentives...although predicating covid relief vaccination status may interesting approach. Maybe get $1000 right away, extra $400 showing proof vaccination? incentivize lots activity already tax refunds/credits. Everything buying electric cars making charitable donations handled way. Unfortunately part human condition mostly concerned ourselves. Appeals humanity usually doomed fail. Aligning individual incentives societal goals think better vehicle. direct quote assumed way thinking showing amongst leaders now. Michigan ahead Florida Texas deaths, likely ahead actual cases. Michigan simply able confirm cases early first wave hit. took Sinopharm vaccine got antibody test done. negative antibodies. got spiral fracture back 6th grade (98) , base foot way knee. Long cast month short cast month half. second week small cast running around friends lol. year ago broke foot still bothers day. Miss young. i’m certainly hysterical living life quite nicely, sorry shitty analogy. No, separate protocol ongoing different age groups 12 years age, started later dose-finding phase. another poster pointed out, paediatric trials focused safety, evaluated right amount youngsters is. 

As general principle paediatric trials (per international guidelines good clinical practice), there's emphasis enrolling children possible trying scientifically extrapolate available data, data published also lower participant numbers. Covid ""everywhere"". people hear yourselves? gonna calm eventually. can't live lives perpetual state hysteria covid lurks behind every tree waiting pounce. GMAFB countries bound treaty obey everything says Phase 3 trials essentially guaranteed breakthrough cases. Despite this, efficacy beat expectations trials replicated real world. 102 cases mild symptoms 1.2 million vaccinated dammed triumph.

Another way say massive numbers people saved disease.

Vaccine hesitancy remains huge problem, headlines like celebrating results top level irresponsible, contextualized article not. feel children need masked playdates vaccinated?

Isn't likelihood severe case and/or die COVID low? Coupled fact adults getting vaccinated, greatly help reduce spread. wish executive teams fly steerage like rest us. I'm 5'5"" feel cramped width legroom. things opening now, even us still short herd immunity, would anyone think things going restrictive we're situation summer sub 1% positivity handful deaths? vaccine, like masks, one line defense. catch it, catch covid vaccinated, 10% death hospitalization. sounds high, I’m guessing data get, number lower. that’s high chance personally, vaccinated (and clinical trial) doesn’t feel worth ditching masks quite yet. vaccines proving effective b117 Team rhino way. Read article? Reddit, kidding?  EU exporting vaccines others don't. Well, that’s also group least likely serious symptoms die that’s really saying much. Actial source I'm sorry hear that. Stay strong. Good news, even it’s completely unsurprising.

Vaccines work. Get soon can, everyone (assuming aren’t medically ineligible). you’re car you’re coming red light, start pressing break, begin slowing down, take foot let smash car front? Why? t-cell memory enough. realize different nurses work different parts healthcare right? every nurse even nurses Covid wards. bit simplification criteria move tier get less strict give vaccine doses. [The info here. Presumably also bodes well Moderna trials, since vaccines similar. Moderna already enrolling kids young 6 months.

I hope so! need vaccines get! 18/1,100 exactly ""running rampant"". That's 1.6% infection rate entire study. calm point. hysterics getting control.  state level stuff Wisconsin mess entire time anyhow. lot restrictions (and pretty much enforcement) happening county-by-county level, I'd bet really change anything ground. many doctors Yemen begin with?  kind doctor would still there?

There doctors here, death 74 doctors matter complicated. fear-mongering 100 sounds like huge number mention people mild symptoms transmitted virus people. Furthermore, 100 people *1.2 million*, large context. bodies assholes punishes sleeping weird. report already bit date considering 31 cases Germany reported yesterday? dated March 24th.

Edit yeah even sais so, ""This assessment based information available 17th March 2021"". wonder sit long. He's also Drew Barrymore, George Carlin, Jane Fonda million people show. 

Hopefully someone brings week talk Record deaths Ukraine well, 407. closely tracking Polish trajectory. got 2nd shot today, planning attending cafe indoors two weeks, thought, maybe I'll wait til May. get feeling still little early, soon going get better. (mid may-beg June almost everyone free clear) Idiots…I get tired shutdowns on,
But mask mandates something help us get back normal faster without risking lives. Plus helps businesses enforce mandates order customers feel safe inside. No, flattened really well late spring even decreased. still got longer lockdowns.  high levels Covid community can’t vaccinated. pro open strongly disagree guidance doesn’t still make sense. 

That said parents probably continue whatever already doing. We've people Ohio travel 45 70 minutes outside main cities deep red territory get vaccines nearby ones always out.

Now 16 plus Ohio, cities suburbs difficult while. hoping supplies stop going rural areas soon probably need soon. teens get vaccinated? I'm 13. That's nice point make here, two counterpoints that:

1. public goodwill also limited resource, nearing bottom right — stupid decisions accelerate this;

2. would justified empirical data showing mandatory masks outside work, believe supported data (I know curves Spain, Paris, making masks mandatory outdoors exactly zero effect effective *R*). got mine almost hour nothing excessive reaction wise besides sore arm yet need case curves flatten

It's seasonal point. gone endemic. bashing windmills That's especially remarkable since older people worse immune systems. even know anyone *got* it. know secondhand cases - friend's parents, half sister's sister, aunt's coworker - nobody actually know.

But means I'm absurdly lucky. mean COVID real. mostly run cautious circles hard locked down, masked couldn't, etc. Straight CDC website. keep vaccinating kids, none vaccinated kids ever get covid, point say really 100% effective? Well, that’s actually good thing. Nice big, scary headline article though. Yea, good point. formally withdraw accusation leave comment posterity. Reported misinformation well can't get vaccinated. affect local mask mandates state, seem like big deal (most cities mandates)  Finally, announced it!  fun, comment linking webmd.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

However, overweight/obese damages cognitive function, one could surmise ulterior motive legislators don’t want anything it... make us fat easily manipulated (as seen massive piles increasing stupidity see Internet forums every day), duh. Yeah -- think people forget purpose ""flattening curve"": issue overwhelming medical system. _most_ people, COVID19 light-to-moderate illness, enough risk hospitalization death system can't take additional load. want triage care -- hospital choose live die based available resources.

I think 'case count' correct heuristic reopening, though want low possible. Hospitalization Deaths far important. way -- presume name threshold -- personal opinion (for whatever that's worth, maybe nothing), reopening. lift restrictions incrementally numbers fall, even cases may slightly increase drop plateaus short periods vaccination effort makes progress -- long metrics continue fall.

Meanwhile UK administered tens millions doses found substantial link.

Actual evidence showing sign EST? maybe, maybe, sick year ago much protection hope have? that's said said? maybe takes several weeks get protection vaccine wrongly assume 30% already protected... problem R-values thing inherent virus, depend circumstances.

Covid-19 R0 2.5-3.0 immunologically naïve population precautions taken. Thus, every infected person infects 2-3 others. Spanish Flu pandemic estimated 1.4-2.8 range, similar. pretty infectious, extremely (by comparison, measles, infectious disease known, R0 15 unvaccinated people.)

Social distancing, mask wearing, etc. make people less likely spread virus. vaccines -- 80% people can't catch you, going infect fewer people. Since measles vaccine 95+% effective, R0 measles vaccinated population less 1, even though immunologically naïve population would 15.

In population -- many people get flu shots, many people flu before, everyone exposed variants flu virus -- flu normally R0 slightly 1 winter, 1 summer. 0.53 lower flu typically is! hand, 2020, many people wearing masks &amp; taking precautions Covid-19, flu's R0 extremely low. know exactly was, 2020 essentially flu season. mitigations took Covid's R0 3 little 1 took flu little 1 basically nothing.

The important value, though, 1. R0 1, disease's frequency population stay constant. 1, declines, 1, increases. 1 are, faster decline rise is. 0.53 great lot lower 1, result infection rate dropping substantially every week. 2nd dose? received 1st AZ dose around Valentines day due get 2nd one soon. seeks jamaharon.

Cautious medical experts going recommend things wing it. Feel good direction progress US making, covid entirely insignificant, going hear caution employed people like Dr.Fauci, that's job.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Lots smart people would they'd love see numbers. UK's scientists example.  touch comment completely disrespects working single parents antibodies vaccine selective - focus spike protein. virus mutates spike protein, new vaccine needed.

For people caught COVID , broad antibody spectrum. [The antigen presenting immune cell detects, engulfs, informs adaptive immune response infection. pathogen detected, APCs phagocytose pathogen digest form many different fragments antigen. **Antigen fragments transported surface APC**, serve indicator immune cells.

After that, immune system recognizes many variants/mutations coronavirus. sees variant, APC digests also presents new parts, upgrading broadness adaptive response every new mild infection. Trump set up, Biden enjoys spoils..

But don’t let facts get way fantasy. think people don’t use daycare? I’d happy stay home forever didn’t work full time Well that’s never happened history, no. Buying first X million doses manufacturer makes blocking exports. trade restrictions hurting global vaccine supply coming UK. UK exporting vaccine components EU uses make pfizer.   
 
The EU ones disrupting people's legal contracts. guess 2 substantially less 20 years warning enough? true. went never met “we met sure it’s still early reasons” Send daycare. risk low. ask staff precautions like Lions win either way. parent type 1 diabetic kid, personally ask people remember last people get vaccines kids, sadly, plenty also high-risk conditions. son almost 13, probably get late summer fall. him, even covid super high risk him, diabetes. makes viruses hard keep blood sugar control, (and son, past) send hospital diabetes care. covid, always get right care diabetes intensive requires frequent lab draws etc, something covid wards right always time deal with. even less likely die age, complications many people lucky aware of. Kids 12 looking get vaccinated potentially 8 months yet. still need protection. Seems like advice people follow, much smarter limit number others kids hang with, go new friend every week. China needed transparent right beginning too? That's never going happen, right. However, still held accountable lack transparency. Covering things advantageous. child expectation could pay someone hard part? J&amp;J pretty much moot point since US much moderna/biontech vaccine going around. still know sub shills J&amp;J much. supposed millions doses since FDA approval never materalized. Imagine theoretically 3 pandemics 20 years stem particular region due careless human development bat habitats, think would affect policy developers? knew point life, didn’t remember. Don’t look French though, guys hella smart! That’s comments suggestion super practical there’s literally reason two weeks following second dose It’s huge lift, friend. Better encourage people get shot showing get back normal do. states opposite, same? comment claiming vaccinated can't spread virus? ALs? one that’s approved America? Thanks, little help fight EUs participating sad horrifying treatment innocent people yemen. What’s normal rate disorders?

1 60,000 seems like could normal rate. 

And difference men (1 400,000 could random difference, given rare). We’re going stay closed people don’t want vaccine. Zero chance. everyone wants vaccine gotten it, that’s 70% country, we’d either herd immunity close it. death rate hospitalization rates would low people would immunity. 30% country decides they’d rather catch virus, they’ll get natural immunity that’ll that. bunch dumb stuff there, thanks.  lol ain’t kid shit Exprets TV exists keep people fear turn keep glued news. hope understand joking idk, mean least people def taking birth control (the men), might hard figure risk factor, I'm assuming taking bc quite common? sure.  Placer County. explanation required.  must fun parties Ahh didn’t see Irish news site. Makes sense 85+% adults vaccinated though, Israel young population third 18. could us? question dropping restrictions vaccinated, brought whatabout can’t vaccinated. worry, suggest dropping restrictions vaccines widely available? Another false equivalent. someone cough coronavirus slightly (/s) worse creep staring people eat. solution make immunocompromised kid self conscious isolated? yes

now im realizing it. talking wife discussing maybe need admit maybe freaked lil much. wanted safe. psych issues death lil dude. never loved anything much never something like live (not fucked way- mean say content life come grips death...then son much lol)

we also live one worst cities one worst states worst country pandemic. played large role

and know- fucking cares really. already passed know needs continue get back swing stuff Lockdowns effective long term strategy ending pandemic. Effective vaccine distribution is. time, ""slow steady wins race"" also times need take calculated risk urgent. saw getting like that, thrown essential workers appointments fill gap. OK....then stop international travel?

I'm getting vaccinated go back normal, means US ban foreign entry net positive book. Alright, listen oldies.. better blow frikken dying covid. AstraZeneca hasn’t applied. resources use (in Santa Barbara), LA. willing drive Oxnard, CVS availability right (as Ventura), matter county Federal Vaccine program. vaccine spotter really really great tool - put zip code, pull California, sort distance. real-time, seen ton appointments Los Angeles. would also check tomorrow morning CVS Rite-Aid links new allocations released every day - huge amount supposed come week. Note CVS easiest terms pulling ""underlying conditions"" - specific, care. CDC expanded underlying conditions, feel bad anything even remotely list. Anyway, good luck!

CVS: (you need sign account first see Walgreens appointments)
Vaccine Spotter (use search zip, change distance closest): http://vaxxmax.com/riteaid
Vaccine Spotter CVS/Rite-Aid/Walgreens (Walgreens even shows appointment times): Agreed. think what's frustrating tier system state lack transparency. opened everyone now, stage surprise see going get next. kids still need put social situations learn grow social skills. School book learning. figuring navigate different social situations friends people exactly like you. Open economy again. Vulnerable people stay inside then. Yeah think playing playground outdoors, especially adults vaccinated, little risk. OBGYNs I’ve spoken say (1) there’s enough data know sure vaccine safe enough pregnant women, (2) know sure COVID worse pregnant women. 

If pregnant woman high risk catching COVID (can’t self-isolate), seems reasonable recommend vaccine. pregnant woman self-isolate, seems reason recommend rolling dice vaccine still studied. lot deaths US

It’s selfish asshole. Both! people got vaccine, side effects come go? got shot yesterday felt crummy night, feeling completely normal afternoon starting feel crummy again. UK well though. low?

You might snag left might not. Can't hurt. know several examples places scrambling find people end day Yep. school teach, parents wringing hands still require masks. one single child object masks. They’re fine. I’m elementary hear issues high school, I’m sure that’s widespread. say elementary students better adults it. describe thing called personal responsibility. It’s pretty cool. people virtue signal. They'd ruin social development tens thousands children save one. dream scenario would events wide open people going they're still scared covid. I'd happy games concerts cheaper due lower demand post-covid. I'm much worried they're going screech everyone forced masks anywhere 10 people. may contributory increase covid infections.

Vitamin deficiency contribute increase infections. may (or may not...the data really iffy) decrease severity infection prevent severe COVID. stop SARS-CoV-2 infection.  

As destroying immune system comment...biggest eyeroll ever. point risk reasonable. one sick person hangs around 100 vaccinated people, yeah, maybe couple get it. won’t get bad, importantly tertiary spread. fizzled quick.  Trump pay rent space occupies mind. Time move man. numbers \*always\* wrong. Since beginning, still are. parent lost child something also ""statistically safe"", reading comment made enter panic attack again.

I understand mean good intention, kind thought relaxing. 

I mean, things actually kill children developed countries ""statistically safe"", right? believe science... believe hype read title someone northern Ohio died covid vaccinated. I’m happy see wrong. point never wearing masks people. never socially distanced people. never gave travel people. myself, family.

I’m dying hill. I’ll wear mask required (but get vaccinated, thinnest, breathable mask possible). I’m going live life.

My argument isn’t pro-maskers, argument people saying still need go though vaccine doesn’t exist, basically. I’m willing that. That’s I’m saying. pediatrician told she’s worried patients test positive influenza COVID. [Cases per capita state] faulty way covid deaths classified] Hopkins analysis identifying rise covid deaths correlated drop deaths causes] bunch dumb stuff tho, right? Certainly nothing factual. Need also get 42.0% 4/20 It’s really special type stupid there. Probably Scott Jones lives instead county. Cries canadian lockdown.   People 30, maybe even late 20s routine. routine vaccinations BCG quite recent now? Emergency powers perhaps justifiable first 30 days pandemic, gives legislature plenty time get shit together jobs. People feel inadequate threatened educated, intellectual expert types though. It’s powerful voting block areas funded performing education systems. Almost like it’s design. totally you. vulnerable feeling. parenting vulnerable nature. 

i think veil lifted us way never been. false sense security. 

god... year

just sitting parking lot reading crying haha. god parent emotions never stop! lol still vaccine Brexit though addition, I’d hate wait end getting COVID. know lot people say first trimester reactions, got Covid would far worse hours reactions vaccine. doesn’t help narrative stick facts :( never states stiko not. offered wider timeframe (last halt included). likely able receive AZ demand it.


Edit: plus AZ, see personally, mght mRNA based traditional vaccination technology. everyone worries mRNA vaccines rushed. Sanofi would competitior regard or, sigh, sinovac. salary can’t get decent data analyst anyway. to. may limit access private services locations. think perfectly fine private entities either require not. funding happened last year, it? J&amp;J Merck deal doses contract options existing contracts.

Other money, seems feds taken mostly hands approach. still 50 States plus large cities eligibility requirements, change May. came funeral dead uncle couldn’t go reception I’m concerned virus fully vaccinated yet.

The reception “happy” “sad” funeral. reception everyone gathers breaks bread together, obviously masks could worn, like funeral. Due damn pandemic, leave loved ones basically go “sad” go home. 

So yeah, I’m ready virus over. I’m ready around loved ones again, without debilitating fear. “Sorry” ( I’m sorry.) makes bad person eyes. Thanks showing type person are. dad got COVID sister couple weeks first shot asymptomatic. sister mom, hadn’t received shots yet, weren’t lucky.  got first dose 9 weeks getting second 13. doctors said get soon available me. read credible research says wait certain time. Don’t know helps! me, ""regardless symptom status"" could either mean 

1) symptomatic, infectious
2) asymptomatic, still infectious

They say study people tested positive symptomatic No, collective society raises children. That’s daycare, public schools, community programming exactly true, also heard Trump saying give vaccines NY Cuomo mean Cute Nah. political. I’m referring vaccine numbers referring specifically vaccine numbers  can’t wait vaccinated. miss gym much 😭 right things, know many families same. knows many lives potentially saved. compare R0 (the basic reproduction number) different diseases, shows many people disease infects average restrictions taken. 

For COVID-19, [estimated although estimates vary significantly. comparison, [seasonal influenza R0 around explains restrictions imposed slow COVID-19 spread enough nearly eradicate flu, Rt(effective reproduction number) 1 prolonged periods time. Spiking literally means going up.

No, spike means ""an abrupt sharp increase"". abrupt sharp increase here.  means way dumb. way dumb. works opposite way too. You’re gonna anti-vax nutties saying look vaccine doesn’t work hand, extreme cautious fear-loving people say, “look, 34 people still got Covid 5 got hospitalized still risk still need mask years” unlikely connected vaccine all, fear mongering politics. never said mask wearing easy distancing easy. said right life 90% normalized choose be. stay distant friends wear masks private settings choose - makes total sense still ask strangers stay socially distant wear masks around other. Yeah it’s hard phrase without seeming overly critical overly lenient strategy - think it’s important note numbers UK aren’t equivalent countries school isn’t option that. kids throughout history socialized fine without put artificial big groups based nothing common besides born year. I’m saying means school environment bad - I’m elementary teacher see good stuff come setting time! also don’t think it’s possible option. coming onto campus activities like labs, extracurriculars, etc, think kids choose new option fine. think kids choose may otherwise struggle find environment could thrive, choices good thing. Antibodies last forever supposed to. body creates antibodies needed. currently Covid antibodies floating around system mean need booster. exposed Covid assuming vaccinated already contracted Covid immune system kick gear make new batch. exact situation. wife fully vaxxed. 4 year old daughter playground school year. 

Last week finally starting hitting playgrounds peak masked. can't another year. pandemic cautious people know can't anymore. None kids wear masks. I'm big scared her, need let go point, let Jesus take wheel.  get upset following science. momma always said nobody made get pregnant Yorkshire hoping stay 1k deaths today. Cases going high everyday while, pretty much accepted that. One thing gives slightest bit comfort kid alone dealing this. entire year wash everyone, starts preschool next year, everyone going coming social awkwardness they'll learn kids again, together. 

It sucks, I've lot days like describing. I'm hanging hope kids resilient able put behind them.   Hospitalizations also climbing.

Ideally right, especially already covered at-risk categories. vaccine rollout program, national response COVID, Trump managed worst global response, killed countless would've saved competent rollout, pretended pandemic exist, got medical care almost one country would access got COVID. 

He throw money vaccine production, apparent Biden took office, plan smooth distribution. go walks time without wearing mask keep pocket. stay distant people. think physically eat mask restaurants open so... sure point there.

I'm focused masks get that's peoples hill die on. continue wearing public larger portion US vaccinated. look Israel get idea be. year long global pandemic? aunt chemical cautery something performed. cautious research, aunt donor kidney liver husband hiv+. aunt also always allergies. put chemical skin peel called TCA nose early December husband too. knew someone works Japanese foundation done allergies. actually sell skin peel tattoo remover 70% concentration Walmart. supposed get rid main cells covid lands nose. don’t think shit OTC tattoo remover. think worked coronavirus former tenet went hospital virus almost died aunt uncle fine. actually using propolis nose since summer low concentration. article it: convince pregnant cousin? works hospital first family get scared first said get you’re pregnant plan be.

You could easily double rate vaccine available. got first shot ten days ago nothing. get second shot Monday. Biontech German company  EU closing US month so

RemindMe! 1 month right decision. amount moderators involved family I've come trust moderators subreddits went private. still needed BioNTech raised target production 2.5B doses 2021? Excellent point. Yep. Still comparable due different time frames among vaccinated. There's way hell anyone continue mask indefinitely. US government barely get people places mandates. Ain't gonna happen. could see people wear cold like Asian countries, absolutely-no-fucking-way Americans indefinitely. outlets speculate want, people want to, happen. Pennsylvania still phase 1A record. It’s probably safe, avoided personally got first Moderna shot. Didn’t feel like putting body much one time. confer 100% protection severe covid, though. REALLY high, 100%. high really need worry it, clinical trials showed 100%- real world says otherwise.  many Alabamians able enjoy food future? Hospitalizations haven’t going two weeks.  wonder case. adjust supply enough based population? simply case demand differing significantly areas? wild difficult find vaccines collar counties whereas areas begging give away.

I'm incredibly glad parents found way get able drive order so, also frustrating vulnerable parents jump many hoops. Thank response happen one vaccine fully approved?

Total speculation, guess vaccine mandates allowed exempt got working vaccines received FDA approval, otherwise that's kind mess. Practically speaking, vaccines EUA almost definitely going get approved, probably approved different times means people got vaccinated vaccines EUA vaccines yet approved mandates start allowed, imagine nobody want mandate allow kid school received say Moderna instead Pfizer Moderna months away approved. would silly.

More uncertainty mind - people vaccinated countries vaccines like Sinovac Sputnik V even receive EUA US much less approval? If/when COVID vaccine mandates become thing, required get *American* vaccine joining military starting school whatever, vaccinated *some* vaccine enough? Like constitutes vaccination record get abroad? wonder already thing say MMR vaccines. go private. unanimous vote respond. 1.5 hrs private, said opposed spiraled there. That's vaccine parents got, apparently got 50% efficacy vs 90%+ vaccines cause study made covid doctors random people like studies explains well since doctors exposed much higher doses average joe, however said 100% effective severe cases deaths.

Great. 2 weeks ago, anxiety roof millions adults gotten shots far, vast vast majority completely fine, case rates already dropped quite bit indicating efficacy, makes think companies lying vaccine? That's interesting, impossible. Seroconversion 100%. everyone develops antibodies applies vaccines. Now, said that, impression happens Sinopharm often vaccines. thinking recommending third dose people, think that's specific demographics, sure. Again, surprising, sucks person happens to.

Why people talk like that? arms here, arms there. They're people. Nowhere comment say want vaccinated, AstraZeneca vaccine provider.
Objectively AstraZeneca vaccine worst one (worst side effects, blood clot issue, poor efficacy), reasonable people want best medicine available? It’s satire though take anything vaccine administered. suggests roughly 80% efficacy group. 80% reduction transmission 80% reduction illness results 96% reduction cases. Fits quite well UK data Pfizer provision things state emergency though. nuclear plant blows (or something like that), governor makes order, would expire 60 days. We're relying legislature (which almost designed get nothing done), help coordinate protect people. case, orders definitely protected basically healthcare workers and/or hospitals getting overrun vaccines available. 

I want governor making orders willy nilly, sometimes need decisive action, never get states legislature. think real-world evidence one way NSAIDs decrease immunity vaccines particular studied phase III clinical trials. 

Its certainly plausible could, worried it, especially avoid taking NSAIDs vaccine. responsible parent feel way. Depriving kids social development gonna damage kids COVID ever could. yes.

Everyone's bodies different reality unless EU starts using mostly Pfizer Moderna full sense normalcy YES, sane, practical (most importantly) legal order. noted above, WI Legislature ability, time wanted, take simple majority vote houses rescind Order Governor.

No legal challenge needed - decision create precedent future Governors. Just. One. Vote. checks balances use. Legislature stepped away pan scale whined Judiciary instead reason. also case made variants. larger unvaccinated population, opportunities variation occur--eventually lowering vaccine efficacy bringing vaccinated population back higher risk.

I hope moment soon! cost/benefit analysis yourself.

If *don't* get vaccine, risk catch highly contagious disease *probably* damage long-term, given age, well *could* unpredictable ways. Plus position infect others.

If *do* get vaccine, may may feel sick couple days, nothing that's going hurt long run. protected potentially debilitating disease -- one step closer herd immunity.

Do really want risk losing sense taste smell undetermined, potentially long, period time? Even chance 1% 2%? avoid feeling run couple days?

Get vaccine. Nah, pharmacies overstocked since Virginia open vaccines all, they're able even fill appointments said 100% effective death people dying. Take whatever say grain salt. like 100% protection severe disease saw Pfizer BNT / Moderna / Oxford AstraZeneca - number cases small 100% rigorous real world representative number.

SCOTUS time (who friendly FDR, struck several parts New Deal legislation earlier) upheld Korematsu, Japanese American citizen would go internment camp, therefore upholding executive order.

Hmm... either it’s minority rule majority. Seems excuses little king George stay throne. I’m sure correct upper bound 100%. chance 100% efficacy 0, either CI95 actually CI97.5 talking 0% 100%, CI95 lower bound double usual uncertainty (5% chance lower rather 2.5%). don’t know enough CI95 say way is. That's false narrative. Florida Texas undercounted deaths, least 45 states United States.

Florida undercounted around 14%. Michigan undercounted around Oh okay, amazes quickly scientists government able move this. Berlin started requiring work home 50% employees. None states moved it, even self-proclaimed covid hardliner Söder has. Impressive Berlin suddenly sensible measures Germany. makes sense me, I'm 1000% favor people making decision themselves. I'm saying young healthy people get shot, clear.

I would argue high risk &amp; elderly people vaccinated, there's less reason vaccinate lower risk individuals get it. choice I'm it.

Times emergency give Federal government far power. always case legally historically. great stopped/dissuaded French public using astrazenica vaccine. alternative lockdown worth compared 0.0000001% chance getting blood clot Still sign 11M vaccines JnJ. finished March 6.7M 20M promised.

On bright side, get remaining 13.3M, end fast track getting 20% whole pop fully vaccinated 25% adults vaccinated.

April huge exiting many people vaccinated. Germany wild ride AZ stuff.

Inititally approved 65, data efficacy older people. shall used 60 1 100,000 young people get brain thrombosis.

At least means i'm getting good mRNA stuff^[tm]. Come now.

1. There's nothing sub that's ""critical resource"" possible exception vaccine finder, available. Nobody died this, along multiple others, sub made genuine stand
2. Going dark pretty universally apolitical. already, I'd really recommend take look list subs went dark. Almost year exactly locked I’m line get vaccinated. fucking wild. Indians/tigers high 37 + wind, accuweather 34 real feel 23. thank you. I'm Bucks, realized residency thing almost relief (yet infuriating). staring dashboards trying make sense probably month. like leak somewhere, compared almost every place country. Indeed do. Actually singer song came anti-vaxxer. supports anti-maskers conspiracy-mongers. Yes. ECDC vaccine tracker site, number doses distributed 86 million today. need come another 20 million tomorrow :) seriously, numbers tracker site delay, one AstraZeneca manufacturing plants approved EMA five days ago. large batch already manufactured approved distribution. Mercola? mom's years relatively harmless pandemic. far tell, that's trusted source that's spreading connecting conspiracies. said Canada Mexico prioritized get borders open NAFTA trade flowing again. Hence gave us 1.5M Mexico 2.5 AZ already. state in, likely get vaccine now. started feeling cold-like symptoms last Sunday got tested yesterday covid. found negative today re-scheduled vaccine supposed today tomorrow. still concern? Avoid politics. give age range chance death and/or severe medical problems incredibly low? 100% go vaccination appointment I’m one them! Got first dose morning! one said did, however establish state increased powers time emergency.

The state government federal government specific powers delegated Jacobson v. Massachusetts Public Health Service Act comes dealing pandemics. get second Moderna dose Monday next week, curious why. Thanks info. Right, it’s function increased demand. Like said, get it. play things hurt injure, usually say ""BOOONK!"" afterwards. Like kid slips lands rug, walks wall, etc. I'll hear around corner BOOONK!"". spectacularly great. word ""perfectly"" already false Imagine actually believing epidemiologist wants time spotlight. people get line work someday could shine TV print pandemic. article quotes CDC director saying “Our data CDC suggests vaccinated people carry virus, don’t get sick, it’s clinical trials, it’s also real-world data”.

If Dr. Walensky, DAY said sense impending doom, says vaccinated people don’t carry virus (which means can’t spread it...even asymptomatically), I’ll believe her. “there still much don’t know” argument fading away quickly. [Everyone 16 Wisconsin eligible next Kind splitting hairs point. 3 vaccines then? dunno “short” bump isn’t time panicking. Cautious sure, don’t go clubbing whatever seriously need stop hyperventilating whenever line goes up. We’ll okay. Grats! Nothing ever 100% anything 😂 know mRNA vaccines work, pne big differences dosing. Curevac much lower still works well probably work advantage need less active ingredient. lot adults vaccinate yet, probably kids line. Fuck misinformation here. AZ failed? fully effective vaccine one scumbag pharma companies sold cost despite production issues created 2nd doses world far. Imagine waiting JJ novavax vaccinate world.

Tens millions doses done potential issues absolutely miniscule amount people undergoing review scientist world.

Absolute joke gets talked here.  I'm rough day second dose moderna. Enjoying pretty much common symptoms.

Absolutely worth it. argument *in favor* ignoring clear Constitutional rules? thought, ""hey, FDR ignored Constitution, racist internment camps"" would selling point. Got J&amp;J shot morning, happy included numbers! That's I'm asking US deaths. That's definition UK would skew comparison know NY CA horrible, considering size populations I'm 100 that. couple friends live state constant struggle since kids, health conditions (one friends dealing breathing issues), can't much like rest country. state extending amount individuals bars, restaurants, etc. mask mandate still there. (I'm looking you, TX MS) can't keep forever. YES!!! I'm happy middle school younger high school kids right :) Yeah. Sounds like well-intentioned rules backfiring. Whyyyyyy leaders reopening soon? Like, legit wait TWO weeks, we'll infinitely better situation  CDC update first dose shots:

1,549,244 first dose shots. Last week 1,541,671

7 day rolling avg 1,731,589. 1,730,507 yesterday. 

97.2m adults first doses - 37.7% (up 37.1%)

73.5% 65+ done (up 73.4%)

At rate, first dose shots:

**Adult population numbers**

End of:

April - 149.1m 57.8%

May - 202.8m - 78.6%

40% 4/4

50% 4/19

60% 5/4

69.420% 5/18

**Total population numbers**

40% 4/21

50% 5/10

60% 5/29

69.420% 6/16



The 65+ % keeps chugging along going slower pace general population. last 5 days, gone 2.4% vs 3.1% per general population. shock anyone since numbers high honestly still going rate faster thought would. could see 75% 65% crowd 5-7 days depending demand stays. YES, sane, practical (most importantly) legal order. noted above, WI Legislature ability, time wanted, take simple majority vote houses rescind Order Governor.

They exactly that. formally ended previously declared emergency Evers issued effectively emergency declaration day. wonder CDC going decide redistribute doses low demand states high demand states. two three week window make decision make difference. 

Laggard states like MS, AL, AR per capita unused doses nearly 3X higher states high demand / good getting shots arms (like NM). I'm fine allow masks since everyone vaccinated. wish they’d elaborate this. I’m high risk shots done, impression per studies chance severe case death 0%. pretty lucky. personally know least 10 people got it. One seriously ended hospital week. said lot family friends think ""just flu"". Outside chance hit Saturday tends biggest day. Lot big box business still require local orders still place public buildings. ya sucks still aspects still around Still takes 2 weeks vaccine take effect, really look towards many people gotten vaccine mid month.

And get restrictions slowly peeled back, really weird pull restrictions back upswing. Hopefully large upswing, I'd want remove restrictions continue compound upswing. Also depends CDC we’re talking about... one said wear masks one said schools reopen. It’s funny “listen science” crowd particular “science” follow. Bigly! Except Mexican flu (not vaccine, virus itself, therefore also vaccine) molecular structure similar structure found peoples (but peoples) human nerve cells.

Auto immune reactions possible foreign viruses Still cracks imagine fully kitted swat team raiding somewhere thinking found smoking gun fin doses. good question. now, not, vaccine supplies still limited already substantially protected. doses go unvaccinated person first.

But totally safe take multiple vaccines. interfere other. downside going side effects potentially increased benefit.

If causes bureaucratic difficulties point, always get US vaccine then. Im 31 amd got first dose today! probably not. mean 1918 flu pandemic shows deadly flu be. vaccinated covid won’t serious either shots arms fast possible absolutely key. shows clue talking about. kind clotting issue. making joke that's cool Korematsu specific dangers “espionage sabotage” time war America legitimate threat invasion. reasoning Korematsu grant states Federal Government carte blanche powers emergencies. fact, reasoning Korematsu nothing pandemics all. necessarily government enacting rent forgiveness (which absolutely happen) tenant go year without paying getting evicted, that's still year free rent even winds eviction. eviction moratorium many people pay rent taking advantage policy. Honestly, eviction moratorium ended months ago, going far long people right someone else's property willing pay it. Late year still best guess anyone has. Though possible July given fast went through. I'm expecting Moderna lead weeks already enrolled age groups tell (I think information public bother looking, enrolling already). However nobody really knows trial finish, reach herd immunity (seems unlikely) trials may never finish. However feel specific policy, definitely *is* good news state struck blatantly unconstitutional order. Separation powers matters, even results policies like. disappointing Supreme Court stalled issue less issue, least set clear precedent regarding attempted executive power grab. Things Work one entertaining series chemistry articles there. Derek Lowe : That’s terrible idea, case Bolsonaro seemingly stupid enough try it. I'd almost willing bet know someone got though. I'm almost certain thing circulating states early 12/2019. remember ""flu like bug"" right around Christmas year. Went doctor, tested negative flu (get flu shot every year that's worth) told they've seen lot cases like come that's probably ""some respiratory bug"". understand why, given I'm gonna start traveling work next couple months...bummer. CA counties open 16+ now. think things ever same. talk vaccine passport concerning going happen. always going message trying prevent next pandemic boot presses harder necks. global scale governments realized far extend power public, really expect would let go? read it, heard experts (including CDC director herself) said confident conclusions. 

Transmission requires infection. study huge actually looked asymptomatic carriers virus PCR find vaccinated group.

In order able transmit virus needs replicating high enough levels upper respiratory tract able spread aerosols droplets excrete. cannot happen virus actually there. PCR test direct test viral RNA, there's virus cannot spread. data strongly suggests antibody response generated vaccine enough stop virus takes hold replicates respiratory tract, like happens vaccines.

Also quote posted way says opposite?

You voted speaking truth, wrong  Really hope right, evidence suggest it’s short bump? made argument UK September kids went back school, went exponentially worse then. would hoped much better situation hospitalisations point, they’re also rise US. thought Pfizer track? AZ behind everyone, UK meant 30 million september still Yuge! say personally surprised decision go private... especially forewarning (from saw).

While I'm 100% favor cause caused group many others go private...I consider group critical resource pandemic era. personally feel blocking user access forewarning mistake.

If r/technology goes private bit... fine. group think serves higher purpose remain (as per rules right) apolitical.

Glad sub back thx hard work. Actually, spreading disinformation. Vaccinated people got Covid lower viral load less likely spread it, still it. several since don’t know bot won’t remove, google “California variant devil” - include word devil, scientists found loudly sounding alarm it. 

It fizzled California. chance overweight, health issues?

Nope, he's mountain climber, dude better shape could ever hope never mentioned health conditions Young people hospitalized covid, though rare, usually tied already poor health and/or overweight.

He hospitalized. bad cough week, sucked him, would classified mild COVID.

Anyway, getting *admitted hospital* extremely low bar someone 20's see ideal health outcome. really ton studies topics like ""what percentage 18-29 year olds prior health conditions test positive COVID get shitty cough deal week would preferred get shot makes feel tired day two"" justifiably researchers concerned drives severe outcomes like hospitalization death rather annoying respiratory illness symptoms people put week home, know enough people wife treated enough patients ""mild"" still pretty shitty COVID symptoms definitely want get myself. think residency requirements PA too. example, I've heard easy get shot Philly, need Philly address. harder get one suburbs surrounding Philly. don't, sorry. people calculations probably posting shortly. thought heard Pfizer Moderna were. could mistaken. Definitely good news. Can't wait see numbers start reporting later week friday/saturday, gonna HUGE numbers. question moderna vs pfizer fact different dose sizes. dad lives Philly burbs, finally got shot last Friday... Allentown.... 

For reason, Philly burbs screwed. experts said deaths would occurred Covid-19 made victims' underlying conditions worse.

This true think important recognize deaths often multicausal rather one thing. Given deaths caused one thing top chart heart disease, cancer, COVID-19, really need give serious pause extent obesity driving poor American health. I'm even knowing anyone go hospital it.

I suspect lot parents/grandparents still alive. Mine died decades ago. lot people Reddit seem think EU behind June equal US UK. dont think realise far behind much increase daily rate need meet gets harder every day.

I hope speed rapidly seems unrealistic point. auto-immune storm issue cancer vaccines trying thread needle human cells cancer cells. really much issue completely foreign protein like SARS-CoV-2 spike. absolutely! Double secret mutation I'm vaccinated would 100% go right possible. hope raise concession prices make ticket sales. amazing. Thanks sharing. realize everything listed confirmed multiple sources several times contradict official press bullshit.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Exactly. mean, legitimate cases see it. People live alone need something, sick still compelling need travel. household everyone's sick one person needs go stock chicken noodle soup refill medications.

Likewise, someone's sick *has* go work, sure, would want mask fullest degree practical order reduce chance spreading sickness. ""reduce"" key word, rather eliminate: masks foolproof, first line defense recalibrate social work culture people better positioned stay home.

Masks would last resort ideally would exceedingly rare see wild - 90%+ everyone who's sick able stay I'd love get inside heads ""I'll wear mask I'm sick"" people.

Realistically though like 20% cases like listed, 80% people pledging something rhymes Smirtue Wignalling. Love pressed people are. people nuts 😂😂😂 Yes age range mine. currently virtual school I’m dying get back next year!! can’t hold much longer. Lol. Avoid reposting information. impose mandates population *beyond intended use without justification*, abuse power. matter even bracelet, forced wear bracelet purpose justification, violation freedoms. Yeah line really bugs I've family die every circle mine coworker friend associate I've known known people contracted it. serious cases, asymptomatic. lot people touched it. hear people go big deal somehow never touched lives wonder really closed off* willfully ignorant believe stake making seem like NBD. 



*I'm practically fucking hermit boot know much closed be. job report news facts, get people interested. fact someone interested enough look candidate issues matter vote. effective

Yeah, effective reducing covid symptoms preventing serious complications vulnerable. deny that, vaccines claim make immune covid (if wrong source data). 

The comment linked argues vaccinating kids help achieve herd immunity, again, vaccines make immune. also argue kids vaccinated prevent serious complications (which admit incredibly rare). original point stands Counting hard. 10-100k annual deaths number see flu based modeling excess deaths (and thus really includes seasonal diseases), tested numbers. Covid deaths based tested numbers undercounted some, comparison based tested influenza deaths likely also undercounted. linear OP saying ""End May"", May 1st - said, deliveries going accelerate. Pfizer Moderna alone commitments deliver 180M doses end May (and far they've less hit existing commitments credibility). That's roughly 90M doses per month even including JnJ. 

I *optimistically* assume 70% adults proactive getting vaccinated. That's 175M people. We're shy 100M first doses administered today. 40M second doses delivered April vaccinated month. leaves 50M first shots Moderna Pfizer alone. So, end month - even excluding JnJ - 25M ""I want vaccine adults"" still need get vaccinated. 

The reason anyone wants get first dose first week May able CDC continues ship doses states can't use them. Plus almost high risk seniors access vaccine hospitalizations shouldn’t go like crazy even see “wave” looking angle downplay pandemic.

You're right. we've overstating pandemic 20-50 fold. recent survey showed majority people think covid coin toss going hospital. 1% go hospital (per NYT CDC links) little counter balancing way pandemic, is, dismissed political supporters loser president. Avoid reposting information. That’s wild Ah that's fair.

Good call. far know, current status mask mandates around country. issue charts like take policies national chains like Walmart McDonald's account. far know, none major chains issued statement they'll lift mask mandates, gives impression they're waiting recommendation CDC. Unfortunately, CDC talking either.

It's leadership gap. government can't tell people expect, people come rules since politicians charge response treat situation nuance understanding. leaders act shocked states make decisions federal government refused share information give realistic expectations. consider complete political failure.

I able find one statement Biden, Fauci, CDC need happen advise mask mandates end. understand even people strongly favor mask mandates could support that. inaction lead people believe federal leaders plans ever lift it- would think otherwise government talking it? state leaders blindly trust federal government open realistic conversation this? expected result ridiculous argue otherwise. teen wants safely rejoin sports possibly get summer job without endangering anyone multi-generational home.  summer job probably happen year, nice see light end tunnel. damn better world law thing people would care countrymen enough wear masks. Awful headline, unfortunately. 65+ % keeps chugging along going slower pace general population.

A personal observation - friend age group eligible months ago, signed time, got appointment mid-April. Since availability increased, could requested earlier appointment vaccinated already, guess want go trouble signing cancelling. So, perhaps vaccine hesitancy, we'll see number continue climb.

(For myself, signed soon age group eligible ended late May appointment, county opened new site, I'm getting mine today.) protests Michigan's Capitol building again? states case increases, increases last March. NE least North. seems super obvious strong seasonal increase lot efforts suppress pointless think. Something climate spring creates increase. Certain temps etc 

We cost sunk fallacy scenario - govt can’t admit wrong bc massive harm. Also I’m sure ppl making money point money makes world go round. virus continue mutate hosts has. Preventing hosts infection, even asymptomatic, step right direction toward avoiding variant evolution. See feel tomorrow. would advise feel worse like 3 10. nurse told biggest concern would illness + side effects vaccine really uncomfortable. think compliance mask mandates anything political affiliation everything individual's risk tolerance general disposition towards compliance.

Otherwise, see Democrat figureheads getting called wearing fucking mask. think Gavin Newsom falls political spectrum?

Do think every single person EU wears mask time? Because, general, EU much left anywhere US get it.

Just aware symptoms clotting disorder: symptoms usually occur four 20 days vaccination include persistent severe headaches, seizures, blurred vision, shortness breath, chest abdominal pain redness limb.

If experiences this, seek medical attention immediately; highly effective treatment.  proper lockdown. Honestly, time free minute. Seems like website consistently updates every minutes. I've rite aid appointments suddenly pop randomly middle day. CVS also adds randomly throughout day. think pharmacies tend main appointment dumps sometime midnight, Rite Aid cancellations show 15 minutes happen based experience. 


If anywhere near Lehigh Valley Health Network, appointment dumps every Tuesday around 8 am. still appointments available certain locations. covered vaccinespotter. Good. He's ridiculous shenanigans herd immunity kids vaccinated things go back normal. we've reached Israel's current situation 6 weeks, there's reason things open entirely. Feel free explain good time remove restrictions cases increasing. see simple compound effect, every restriction removed multiples number cases. think makes sense start peeling back restrictions cases trending trending seems like quickly removed restrictions actually got handle situation. 

If cases trending unfortunately means strict enough, hence say give vaccine 2 months start kicking high gear steadily dropping infection rates. Hell yeah! cake day gift! Correct look hhs cdc website Medical Workers general public. There's similar masks job N95 US Canada they're European Union FFP2/FFP3 Chinese KN95 South Korea KF94 seen Kpop idols general public. masks job United States Canada N95 China KN95 European Union FFP2/FFP3 South Korea Kf94 Australia New Zealand P2 Japanese DS2. Covid deniers freaking odd. article reads like bot wrote it, probably did. Although contains many grammatical errors bit would unlikely make. couldn’t see thread post time, I’d like say extremely upset decision go private.

Ozark: Belgian 🇧🇪 Government edition good news. Kids appear get sick immune systems amazing. 

People often forget much persons apparent illnesses things body response, directly caused virus. illnesses would much rather notice fucking up. caused heart failure? Technically, die heart stopping. Today’s stat Brazil would equivalent 5705 daily US deaths. it’s Tuesday. slope current weekly death curve almost straight upwards. downside 1 900,000 people developing blood clot still nothing compared upside expediting vaccination process. ummm rudimentary level yes?

Avoid reposts.   OP imagine takes account future increases administration (hence ""at rate""). Rather, 1,731,589 first doses per day average end May, we'll 78.6% adults least one dose end May.  Avoid reposts. Random, got j&amp;j vaccine little 3 weeks ago, cdc considers 2 weeks fully vaccinated. good go back normal? Mostly peace mind really, don’t want obsess making sure mask fits great, taking mask even drink water work lol, also want go back gym. also love high risk older people vaccinated eligible, continue wear mask, socially distance public... careful reopening resuming activities, based current projections, believe could likely see return fully open movie Broadway theaters sometime fall. guarantee.

I'm becoming little frustrated attitude reopenings masks social distancing actually ""reopenings."" Movie theaters, zoos, sporting events, big crowd circumstances like already open precautions. think point aware question things open normal way, always- *always*- dodges question.

It's hard understand many people coming impression Fauci want things return normal. avoids talking every time he's asked. get it, he's politician, he's doctor. they're going put front cameras every single day ask questions public policy, really learn talk terms keep humans mind.

Most people planning dedicating lives eradicating virus. understanding leads people ignoring public health guidelines. yet understand that, continues confused people listening him, absolutely confuses hell long time. mistake original calc. 31 cases 2.7 million shots know but, US UK managed get far quickly; it’s probably EU manufacturers blame arts already open much country already. bit touch reality. buy N95s.  exactly one key explanations. older get, Ace-2 receptors have. There's pretty good list states already there, based openings lifting mandates Boy, sounds real good 100% effective. Thats bold claim make isnt journalistic error. conspiracy theory? Huh, vaccine passports discussion many months. adorable argument fact unvaccinated people getting sick still take medical resources need try move goalposts know decent amount people got it. Nobody know even heard died it. hope stays way summer ""normal"" whether like not. worried probably fly. trying ass, that's going be. federal government cannot mandate vaccines Without children US meet herd immunity. Pfizer announced good news, I'm sure even 12+ enough get herb immunity. Time tell (unless get vaccines younger kids time tells) mean CA. direction. Source: 4 sources reputable newspapers. ICU percentage isn’t actual. Practically countries discouraging AZ younger people, Canada Finland... think political parties view masks same??? read Daily Mail, thank much.

Similar age kids know guys done virtual learning long without going insane! learning synchronous/ camera entire day parents teaching schedule? virtual days done Florida rough kids learn thing. Astra 10% vaccination coming months. AZ delivery issues taken account replaced. Lol. Solipsism nutshell Imagine thinking can't lmao classmates possibly considered contacts? Blindly listening authority figures isn’t “listening science.” science says vaccinated people safe rarely spread Coronavirus compared aren’t. everyone wants gets it, there’s good reason restrictions. Rural areas probably fine considering hard hit winter US exports vaccine ingredients banned export vaccines. 

This attempt #13003 EU chauvinists blame US failures. Im sure would even possible resemble holiday surge. Even ignoring Christmas + thanksgiving huge contributors, vaccines cases aren’t anywhere close unlikely ever reach always get mysteriously quiet ask 1 50 hundreds millions people looks like know multiple people fully vaccinated later got sick tested positive  Covid exposure provides protection vaccine B cell memory. However long vaccine immunity lasts long natural immune response last. Antibodies small part equation. Neither vaccine natural infection promise stop infection/reinfection. simply stop severe symptoms arising due high viral loads body cannot fight effectively IMO extremely problematic lot reasons...but basic level everyone smart phone access passport. seems like issue [Meanwhile, mask one posted 23 hrs ago vs Pzifer one 9 hours ago? That's lot time collect votes. mean would upvote vaccine one comparing apples apples say bad news getting upvotes. getting everyone workplace vaccinated? apparently everyone town knows multiple people died vaccine Yes. able drop masks soon waiting vaccine, plus two weeks.
The people decided want vaccine need protected. need help helpless need help clueless.

Nobody Philadelphia paying attention eligibility. lines outside convention center locations filled obviously ineligible people. thing social media know perfectly healthy posting vaccination cards. want, say go get it. Yeah it'll create lot generational resentment. Sure look israel results Germany literally lol agree. haven’t even begun process half million deaths. deaths Covid patients alone room maybe nurse tragic.

We f*ed much response least vaccinations track stop deaths. see results already fucking huge. read something article days ago Dr. Fauci saying still know could another 5 months find one studies.

ref: [Dr. Anthony Fauci says large trial asymptomatic COVID spread could yield answers 5 months - CBS needs make clear instead acting like need wear masks end time. everyone access vaccine, many people aren’t going put masks anymore. Especially 70-80% vaccinated. Absolute lunacy expert wants continue point. Depends- wife got second shot time- symptoms tired/had muscle weakness ever since. sub isn’t reliable ACCESSIBLE news aggregator, I’m going coming here.

Think way: inaccessible couple hours benefit better platform long run. worth doing, right? Probably not. vector mRNA vaccines actually infect cells get create eject spike protein. part cells recognize kill make virus. Inactivated vaccines protein vaccines step. 

Curevac late trials mRNA vaccine spike nucleocapsid proteins. It'll interesting see gets better results spike. N protein caused ADE sars-2003 could also backfire. understand completely. I've unemployed since last March covid. I've suffered lot myself. hold hope. We'll make this, world gone worse plagues before. May 1st everyone eligible, means confident supply ramp up. We're throwing ludicrous amounts money this. got 👍 Sure, buddy. Good luck next target recruit whatever trying now. Agreed it’s confusing. Also yesterday feel like said something along lines mmdw would lot normal last year. also says can’t let guard celebrate like normal? Last year pretty strict lockdown late May though, without even parks beaches open yet. that’s part concerns comparing summer. legislature never write new law stop unlawful actions governor. court proper avenue take this, especially establish legal precedent. ever hear people pushing consequence reach peak Everest K2 walking corpses fellow climbers? get blind goal. Maybe example perfect you, crazy shit think goal sight. kids already covid. I'm worried dying.

I'm worried missing 2 weeks school, long term effects covid, spreading someone could die it. nut kid can't bothered carry epi-pen elderly/at risk can't singled stay-at-home orders?

One stupid decision justification another stupid decision, least opinion. hell going France- friends across pond comment? No, hydrochloriquin made-up antidote. story made-up anecdote. Yes, count ""At Least One Dose"" ""Fully Vaccinated"". think CDC directly breaks ""Second Shots Administered"" back based manufacturers, first doses given, number fully vaccinated individuals.

As right JnJ basically noise they've delivered few.. last week like 5M doses administered. BionTech something like 95% overall primary analysis (fairly small sample size though, lotsa wiggle room). trivalent flu vaccines reach like 10% specific flu strains. Still 10% fewer infections deaths) tho thats good.


(There flu vaccines negative efficacy though. Oopsie.)  using regular mRNAs self-amplifying RNAs? They’re waiting ~25% country received least one dose because, year massive social upheaval, last thing officials want border-to-border protesting de facto creation special class people go stuff — mention people who’d simply say they’ve vaccinated opt wearing mask. we’re estimated within striking distance herd immunity vaccinations need secure last bit, guidance change. delivery dates EU public knowledge. According those, enough vaccines fully vaccinate 60% population end June, dependent manufacturers fulfilling contracts far there's sign (the reduced amount AstraZeneca already considered).

For Germany: Look, I'm arguing you. I'd much rather phase 3 SA Pfizer's 2nd generation vaccine one that's available now. neutralizing antibody titers serum AZ Pfizer decreased degree B1.351 compared original strain.

It’s exhausting. get second shot next Friday I’m beyond thankful for. past year particularly difficult damaging top dealing covid isolation. feels bit like there’s nothing feel hopeful read things like this. really fair. 6 year olds frankly could leave home weekend. 16 year olds nope. answer vaccines arms. Yeah understand still take away easing red tape would speed progress potential drugs could benefit even cure illnesses today. 

I'm saying remove restrictions cure cancer I'm questioning benifits lose stringent restrictions. see benifits everything that's happened world lately I've also started look things another angle maybe re-evaluating things could done. Nah, give bunch perks people got vaccine (no need wearing masks, quarantine needed, etc.) suddenly people getting participate like normal again. brainwashed, though technical term socialized. Half battle realizing it. exists serve majority practically can. always outliers perfectly served. mean system effective. Holy fucking shit, dude honestly think red areas setting serious problem.

We talk % population vaccinated, looking broadly. 50% nation? Sure, that's easy. guess what? large percentages conservatives anti-vax liberals pro-vax, going see concentrations thoroughly vaccinated people areas vaccinated. 

It's gotten point people advised look red parts electoral map find appointments trouble finding one city. 

Cities herd immunity, rural areas spread like wildfire. Question CDC statistics. someone gets J&amp;J dose, get counted 2 doses administered? ask two columns, ""At Least One Dose"" ""Fully Vaccinated"", person would fall categories counted percentages. Calibration told. Sometimes chip lose signal adjusting bio-metric energy sustain entire life. 

The second shot keys personal genome make sure you’re giving 4 bars 5G foreseeable future. literally data shared NPR today proving case. likelihood vaccinated person gets covid super super low, zero. media better job bc headlines conflict, even underlying research doesn't, general public become confused lose faith thought talking something private sector, state-controlled.

I dislike vaxports, different reason: People able get vaccine already disadvantaged. unfair \*increase\* disadvantage. We're creating vaccine jealousy. Seriously got second hand embarrassment reading that. Why? New Jersian here.. really don’t see possible I’d like know Murphy got numbers. 

Last year low hundreds cases summer. without vaccine lot less people without natural antibodies due infection. would think June half NJ population protected. Murphy’s data seems defy logic. Also rate transmission went week 1.09 comparison 1.11 last week. small decrease decrease nonetheless. 

It also doesn’t make sense he’s pushing pessimistic narratives simultaneously relaxing restrictions. lot mixed messaging Murphy’s part. Convergent evolution virus variants, maybe? UK restricted deliveries EU. EU halt exports, absolutely would contract says, order placed, reduce first sizes delivery EU.

From production EU established. legal claim lines paid for. British dominated Israel wonder went    trials done South Africa vaccines (Novavax J&amp;J) much better stopping mild infection previous infection was. still assume mRNA better. 

There B.1.351 outbreak Colorado prison three weeks ago appears completely ended state gave 85% population first vaccine dose within 48 hours.

We good measuring cells, vaccine phase 1 trials showed made. can’t expect people ever trust govt agency constantly proven lie, fits agenda.  brother sharing alarmingly pseudoscience-y videos stuff lockdowns bad virus bad people say masks useful etc.

I get lockdowns ""bad"" cause problems like depression, however think necessity countries people refusing wear masks. people reasonable wear damn mask public alternative policy there? 

The premise wearing masks also flawed since obviously masks help stop transmission virus. Allowing people go business usual without mask lunacy struggle see there's scientific basis behind policy.

Basically, anyone concrete case studies peer reviewed stuff use debunk pseudoscience he's throwing way? Thanks I'm sure - ever - we'll full FDA approval. Dr. Paul Offit (from FDA Vaccine Advisory Board) speculated vaccines seek full approval. got mine day (30s M, U.K.). disused shop five minutes. astonished efficient given crap everything normally here. 

I got call nurse know 4pm saying “we doses spare, get 30 minutes?”. say yes get text reference number driving there. Show text man front door, points seat, take it. Someone “do covid right now? Ever allergic reaction?” bit records answers typing laptop. Next thing know I’m instructed take jumper I’m vaccinated St John Ambulance volunteer. given wee appointment reminder card (only bit paper saw), told drive fifteen minutes, I’m done. Germans messed equivalent process don’t know. Except lockdowns proven work. emphasis really needs *why* vaccinated people need continue mask follow public social distancing guidelines, they're health might get someone sick, really people need understand now. Like doctor article saying, fully vaccinated people need continue masking public cannot tell vaccinated isn't, that's reason. Sadomasochist. HIV problem discernment. discerning 'opportunity get vaccine' ' actually able get vaccine'. 

Kaiser Northern California opened vaccine appointments teachers last week email members. Remind me, many days doses again? many days booster full efficacy?

I know communicated school board, flies face communicated Northern California's largest healthcare provider. still bad Spanish Flu Thank going private. protest really important respect appreciate y’all taking stand. &lt;3 One could dream would happen U.S. could avoided. Fully opened theaters aren’t using social distancing. That’s “fully opened” means.

Partial reopening theaters already have. Basically, [viral field there's lot content study, enjoy. lying, it’s “our good?”  That’s BS. people sit scratch head wonder citizens don’t trust govt Bodies like CDC, hope remember this. govt, politicians, lie interest so.

Without honesty, trust. Volunteering got mine Sounds like watched video: swabs made polyester rayon, materials completely biologically inert. That's worst case scenario, everyone ripped masks, doing. put much stock it. long get vaccinated it'll OK. Things get better quickly enough people vaccinated. Check Israel see went 50% vaccinated. even nightclubs open Yeah still... def pain arm. got Pfizer one 4pm 9 felt soreness. Following morning worst but.... always take sore arm Covid. Cheers m8! know Alabamians healthy fight flu. Totally cool this- put work deserve vaccine turn around place act out. ""Here money."" *turns around* ""Thank you"" Canada Norway TINY population, hardly representative world. 

Idk, ask germany. They’ve mismanaged majority vaccine rollout like I’d trust anything coming Jens Spahn’s mouth anyway. Again, U.K. given lot AZ shots far number people getting blood clots statistically negligible. Oh god's sake. Wollensky literally said today clear fully vaccinated people get sick spread. 

Full send vaccine demand peters out. summer, caution required. Enough enough. white reason milk white: small particles scatter light. milk, casein micelles. vaccine, lipid nanoparticles. really true. vaccines 90% higher efficacy range 99%. Oh yes Berlin.... almost like year solve problem nothing... far everything says vaccine works variants.

The world remember look themselves. relative mine works healthcare refusing regular testing convinced PCR lateral flow test dangerous swabs contains dangerous, cancerous chemicals. know question sound silly, evidence use show safe take tests? I'm worried relative could put lives risk lose job. think people become accustomed much bad news hard see way this. hard see light end tunnel, getting brighter vaccination I'll give reasoning wearing mask I'm sick. 1. still go work. 2. I'll wear home spread family members. Combination help reduce spread. way hell going go work sick. boss tells come anyway wear mask. suck eggs. world getting June/July timeframe MA? even somewhat reasonable position maybe hit first second week June get second dose Moderna. 

About 44% Massachusetts adult population already vaccinated first dose. Even absolute worst case, keeping trendline gets 80% end May. Even going struggle get 80% adults vaccinated without aggressive push campaigns.

95%+ chance anyone wants get vaccine able get first dose first week May (as in, able get appointment relative ease.. already published general availability April 19th). entire point wearing cloth/surgical mask stop **you** potentially infecting others. mask like n95 (worn properly) actually protect inhaling virus.  K get it, guys want pretend people racist asians. Nobody believes narrative. I'm sure media trying hard pretend real phenomenon. makes better how?

Clearly, ignorant. Probay tooal many bumps head. Never mind number excess deaths last year **suspiciously** close number reported Covid deaths. France really fucked up, mocked UK paying price. Rule Britannia! 🇬🇧 half listed became eligible last week. 


Teachers weeks behind that. 


The next phase April 5th still 50+ medical conditions, young healthy 19th. Baker made decision structure phases vulnerable, completely left people house contributing spread...which, fine. However choose that, can't breath act horrified shocked cases shoot up. 


The 20-40 crowd house, eating restaurants, interacting friends, spreading like crazy. small percentage vaccinated. plan wait able get appointment May, never going happen. holds true, critically vaccines use currently, we've basically war. enough people vaccinated globally, virus start struggle spread continue infecting people. getting sick infection great all, spreading first place even better. worldwide catastrophe, solved worldwide. Yes, could abandon South America, Canada, Israel everyone else like US would extend suffering, help virus mutate drive abandoned countries arms Russia China. world remember who's reliable partner who's not. US behaviour strengthen Russia's China's soft power. EU west's hope lose credibility. me...I fail see really much impact, time tell. See, want jump case, risk death, major concern (duh), part picture. People recovering covid (yay, die) living long-term often serious lingering effects. Saying 1% worried irresponsible misleading. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Canada ? Norway ?
And come Germany investigating 62 cases none occurred UK ? couldve spent 5 minutes searching loop drama subreddit. Whenever something unexpected happens reddit go r/outoftheloop answer. Inyo county pleading governor look current formula used calculate covid tiers. Currently almost mathematically impossible Inyo County leave purple tier. March 30, 2021 Inyo County, second largest county CA geographically, population less 20,000 6 active Covid cases COUNTY WIDE. Residents wits end. Poland really well last spring. agree thinking. there's reason clinical trials. ability anything mentioned would ""rescue economy"" even extrapolated across entire economy lol would good true? Ah, yes. number one cause death: dying. Yep. Completely unsurprising people won’t mask, won’t avoid gatherings, basically won’t change life pandemic, also won’t bother get free life-saving vaccine. 

Some people either complete denial actions dangerous, don’t care. Instant, short-term gratification alluring morons. Minor inconvenience greater good? much. Good! Pfizer one one take anyway (due health conditions.) UK keep pushing AstreZeneca vaccine, end day vaccine vaccine, always much preferred Pfizer one always felt much better safer AstraZeneca one, personally would pushed take Pfizer one anyway.

Unfortunately Pfizer one one take waiting since one seems giving :/ write totals every day come in. yet find official source details Well I'll actually check southwest flight 2 weeks. Nice first world problems again. Yes that’s point Doesn’t fact got contradict headline? get numbers low still carry it. sure I’m downvoted hell pointing out. Yes know among 3 weeks already two weeks Easter break. think problem. virus found open breeding ground got partially done Italy, France. think happening Germany. Plus Germany's numbers Poland's problem richer countries mobility.  Capitalism blessing curse. many plagues capitalism killed way higher percentage covid killed. Also, capitalism really provided incentive vaccines coming market moment.

 


I'd curious hear counterpoints. EXACTLY

We need make clear mask mandates exist benefit unvaccinated masses; unvaccinated, need stay away air unvaccinated people often possible. Public masking useful right know general population given areas unvaccinated, exactly removal mask mandates needs tied vaccination goals. mean...vaccines actually reduce infections tenfold? Still seeing sentence states person superspreader.

I see ""'Superspeader' despite vaccination **question mark**"" don’t know you’re getting downvoted, you’re right. stop disease expert start playing amateur psychologist nation 330 million people, that’s go hugely wrong. want, need, deserve pure medical information doctors personal life government. Nobody would tolerate doctor telling fudged information half truths.

I disagree more. ignore psychological aspect problem would blatantly reckless would caused countless deaths.

Take masks example: told us unshaded truth cloth masks work well, N95s work better, need N95s medical workers. know would run N95s would transmission medical settings. lying, saved lives. N95 supply issue solved, clarified guidance.

Doctors lie patients time. absolutely tolerate it. minimize problems, fail tell whole truth, resort oversimplified explanations, hide mistakes. believe best patient, like epidemiologists lie believe best country. “The question case whether governor acted wisely; whether acted lawfully.  

That statement explains quite bit. Wisdom isn’t guiding Supreme Court’s decision. Now, said, think sex offender registration laws. people don’t know, constitutional. made made safety public, rightly so, laws based wisdom protecting community importance sex offender’s constitutional rights. 

So, wisdom protecting people come play Wisconsin’s Supreme Court? protection people? sure original comment said, 12yo asthma high risk catches it. I'm counting days vaccinated. I'm worried 9yo yearly much. 

Regarding immunity, proven yet, much appears vaccine provide sterilizing immunity most. CDC relaxing guidelines fully vaccinated. joke, sorry took week half checking 5 sites multiple times day finally get one hour drive away... mess... anything really support though? Im referring people post blatant lies like still moving single direction: down. Vaccinate actually die disease move already.

Oh wait, you, anti-mask rants. 

Thanks example. Shitting bungling leaders government response shitting people dying despite responsible. got second Pfizer shot 21st felt nothing arm soreness. LOL So, theory, low demand states would turn high demand states, would incredibly good herd immunity levels. Ok, let’s *absolutely* then. Lol Given JnJ encodes literally identical spike protein Moderna Pfizer (only AZ different) - Moderna Pfizer create stronger immune response (based antibody titers) - literally zero reason believe Moderna Pfizer somehow perform worse JnJ B1.351 variant better others.

It'd great get real data course using reason justification favor JnJ two highly effective mRNA vaccines make sense. Weren’t predicting 150 million doses administered end March? Right nose!  Pre-Covid, traveled internationally \~2x per month. I'm management consulting specializing data analytics &amp; AI. Yes, I've work virtually past year, nightmare. 

Getting stakeholders single room discuss topic 4 days straight, hash details stand front whiteboard yet replaceable via zoom.

* Video conferences miss many subtle queues see person (doubt, misunderstanding, hesitancy etc). 
* People much distracted VC face face. Dogs barking, kids needing fed, internet cutouts, forgetting go mute. Person can't see screen-share etc...
* Time-zones nightmare. easier spend 4 days together one location 2 weeks takes many 2 hour zoom calls accomplish thing. 
* Goodwill capital. can't take client colleague dinner beers zoom. much harder make personal connection often required get things accelerated prioritized...much built basis relationships. 

Zoom calls (pre-covid) remain (after covid) vital tool staying sync can't drop someone 8,000 miles away... still need in-person visits. I’m sick people saying mask wearing “widespread” Asia, like NPR article. I’ve Asia, people wear motorbikes protect pollution. get bikes, take off. may choose wear sick, it’s like people walk around masks constantly normal times. really pisses off, honestly- it’s even accurate. thought, government imposes drastic lockdowns affect every segment society think perfectly reasonable test legality. And? replace population government got one figured UK production issues AZ too, meant get 30m end 2020 got 4m. one asking young teens younger even need vaccine?

I feel unnecessary risk outweighs benefit. outbreak.info gisaid data:

B.1.526	0	not detected think identified key this. would create two-tier society already vaccinated go back normal life either yet eligible still waiting appointment day come treated second-class citizens. critical mass people vaccinated, restrictions come down, earlier create fallout people openly defying rules. We're talking extra month two anyway. mean rapid test garbage anyway negative followed high PCR shows bad rapid tests finding cases. It’s unnecessary children get though. vulnerable protected well anyone else wants be, doesn’t matter cases don’t result death hospitalization going around. Variants always spread continue addressed future vaccines haven’t taken continue level immunity natural infection. point shift allocation high demand states anyways. buddy got vax residency Georgia stay Mass whole year he’d looking vax timeline June/July, I’m looking well. That's possibility. I'll ask it. Looking strictly facts article, disclaimer I'm unable fully capably translate video, *may* enhancing going on.

I think story actually says person, fact, super spreader.

It says: 1) person vaccinated; 2) asymptomatic (so tested?); 3) rapid test negative; 4) showed high viral titers PCR test; 5) infections hospital.

Nowhere say person established person responsible infections. 

*Remember*: presence viral RNA PCR test *is not* thing presence transmissible virus. Good Sounds good true. currently use vaccines west appear prevent spread quite effectively real world. prevent symptomatic asymptomatic infection people, viral loads average much lower vaccinated people test positive COVID-19, making transmission people less likely. doesn’t mean wont exceptions though, since vaccine 100% effective. small number vaccinated less effective immune response vaccination. aggregate, currently used vaccines effective preventing spread even so. Seeing business travel floats hospitality industry....... damn suck online sarcasm, woopsie that... across board, whole subreddit become anti-science anti-lockdown. change happened suddenly last week two. wear masks sick post covid. Wearing time beyond really stupid.  could eradicate Covid everyone physically able got vaccinated. vaccines effective. problem entire countries can't afford vaccines get awhile. high percentage people simply refuse get vaccine. 

So right. going around forever. Backup chip. They've increasing week now

Only 13% Texans vaccinated, that's knew would happen, happened Two Weeks^^^TM K-12 staff educators, child care workers, high risk medical conditions, transit,grocery, utility, food, sanitation, public works, health care workers.....you got pretty good chunk younger population likely contract/spread. big jump grandma 16 year olds. Exactly this. Paul might wrong messenger, message completely correct. Fauci got pulled away public speaking subject, go back briefing government officials private.

We desperately need people taking vaccines now, offering carrot - masks - restrictions foreseeable future. know 2 doctors personally chosen vaccinated exactly reason. Yes, understand. I’m speaking raw humanity standpoint. much quantitative data. It’s lot death. sucks see. make sure I’m understanding question: 

You’re impression anyone disagrees Fauci “hard right.”

Is correct? China example would used both, people usually wear masks *know* sick. wearing one prevent possibility cold/flu common practice anywhere. *worth* think people got fat due lockdowns that’s they...were hospitalized Covid? Time internal logic checks. one reasonable solutions read topic, thank you. Yeah saw Ah, interesting. wonder “major” consists carriers like Delta, American, United, Alaska, Southwest, etc. TL:DR vaccine working well expected. So, right whole year?

It quite fun! think Karens refuse wear mask go get vaccine?

I'm betting lot ""Don't coward, walk off"" crowd scared needles that's get vaccine.  three year olds made same. You’re trying that’s ask. Agreed seems like something never happen reality. 

If adults vaccinated, risk from
Children minimal. people refuse get vaccinated, that’s risk exactly evolve.

Viruses evolve order improve replication. 

Same law evolution, nucleic acids, amino acids, almost coding nucleic acids amino acids, identical similar proteins replication verification accuracy replication.

The general (but absolute) rule mammalian host nucleosomes proteosomes necessary mammalian viruses replicate, also mutate (and evolve). Necessary selection .

mRNA vector splice vaccines intervene process diverting human immune functions synthetic proteins lipoproteins, synthetic RNA DNA. that’s case even study it? think kids going encouraged take untested vaccine, regardless study data. 

Even now, people say “well don’t know long term effects COVID let’s take vaccine (that also don’t know long term effects of)” I’m talking specifically trying see pictures you, I’m talking dismissing BMI dumb article say kids need isolated? He's support school reopenings spring, definitely fall, even though kids vaccinated then.

He says wear mask socializing. That's that's article. I’d suggest it’s moot passing US fairly quickly right now. It’s political br@nch C0vidlans sub don’t like question deity. Oh thought talking dealing Covid confused UK list.

If you’re talking vaccinations don’t forget UAE, Bahrain top Israel, Chile etc  think doesn’t continue throughout childhood? absolutely skills kids need continue learn. 1/3 81 Australian people. Seems like good enough simple size make headline!  Science!! Err mean Math!!!  excellent brilliant. use ultrasound already break kidney stones? really new, remember exactly remember reading studies Europe (maybe France?) ultrasound COVID months ago. Canada’s looking another reason vaccinate population. There's, like, 3 countries million people faster US. they're much faster. Isn’t Kim Jung Un attentive people North Korea? insane isolate kids long. Poor kids. work children's hospital logged quite hours Covid unit. barely admissions, admissions get almost never sick enough require anything even approaching ICU criteria. Kids incredibly tiny risk even funny. Yes we've lost some, number we've lost less 10. Kids fine.

&amp;#x200B;

I hear saying ""oh spreading adults grandma blah blah blah blah blah."" Look, they're kids. need fucking social skills kids, we're going get entire generation socially defective adults, can't fuck that. Keep risk, unvaccinated people fucking away children let fucking play children become serial killers.

Unless course, really like idea ton socially inept Elliot Rogers running around, case cool. Isolate 'em. anyone kids, understands kids all, could think bragging kids wearing masks somehow show imply you’re something wrong, boggling me. ""The findings could explain staff working wards wear surgical masks two three times higher rates infection hospitalisation COVID-19 working intensive care units complete personal protective equipment N95/FFP3 respirator masks used,"" said.

Many health experts calling Australian hospitals upgrade masks hospital staff protective masks protect aerosol spread. mostly agree find individual bmi helpful conjunction waist circumference activity level. words, Fauci says common sense we've known months. Yes know kids like wear masks probably won't, he's simply stating recommended guidelines. knows ton kids play together without masks, he's stating shouldn't. That's it, calm down, jesus. said, kids basically parent know trouble getting 3 5 kids wear masks yes kids wear them. thread reads like right wing Facebook page. People nuts simple mask requirement. Fuck already, Fauci. Jesus Christ. enough ruined entire economy sake 0.15% population? telling kids can't play. end? finally satisfied? Idiotic regulations. foot coverings? Authoritarian, amirite? sorry, see makes much sense. lot points mentioned locality specific instances area, course important, live information age, real need separately controlled strict guidelines (or otherwise) contradictory make people's lives difficult. idea road closures, weather patterns, hospital systems healthcare locations things anyone find time nature simple search internet.

To point hand, article plainly states key WV's success small population tightly knit. case populous areas genuine plan execution needs place, millions people wanting get vaccine time, causes others thread dealing right now. states leading due inherent factors based location (mainly based factors accumulated time, said North Dakota cited NBC article well) others lag proof something working needs fixed. 

I think saying system demonstrate anything positive someone one state scrounge stress get vaccinated deadly disease, meanwhile someone else absolutely problems able ease (to point vaccine delivered home). anything, exact problem confused scarcity due lack planning unified execution makes good thing.

Your article great West Virignia North Dakota, 1.7 million, 762,000 people living states respectively. New York state 19 million, another place like Florida 21 million makes vaccine rollout local level much difficult see system start break simply many people need tended local government legislature really handle effectively without outside help. 

I understand case-by-case approach work, happy people living North Dakota West Virginia safer position now. said also lot evidence show approach working well comes handling large amounts people efficiently.

I appreciate idea, certain instances, point life know useful dealing 5 million people efficiently. Take care wonderful day :-) love mercy *Cough cough* Cuomo, *cough cough* Whitmer... Nah, bad, lots cases death hospitalization bad due vaccine younger people getting it. mistake guess type 2 diabetes. wonder made distinction. numbers statistically significant compared population, russian propaganda

They want sell sputnik Correction, vaccinated people whatever fk want whenever want. dangerous spreading anti vax information like this. Please delete. So… vaccine 90% effective isn’t 100% effective? That’s hella jump 2019 2020 blaming aging population. wonder else going 2020? Must something would cause dramatic rise? could be?  research showing evidence [12 know it’s preliminary could actually turn good thing. study says nothing aerosol transmission covid.  Serious question. Isnt flu dangerous small children Covid?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* feel like daycare controlled though. It’s kid see playground science museum never see again. daycare, let know someone kid’s family tests positive take appropriate steps hopefully nip extra spread bud.

We’ve son daycare last year (initially lost spot couldn’t find another, made work) considering preschool it’s least free all. Pfizer, Moderna AZ. vaccines like Novavax, CureVac Imperial coming soon. think consult doctor best course action instead self-medicating...the mechanism clots might different normal, aspirin might unpredictable effects. haven’t. It’s always vaccines kick drive rates negligible. Kara boga!! Moderna entered mix well used vaccinate millions people. imagine end vaccinations using AZ Pfizer (when better vaccinations like Novavax Imperial arrive) roughly number them.

Where source vaccine split way? “The researchers also noted adults younger age 65 lived children age 11 reduced risk dying COVID-19.” Genius. Look, Trump giant POS, probably vaccine availability anything. mRNA vaccines 90-95% effective. small number people exposed still contract covid, likely mildly. 90 95% reduction risk substantial, 100%.

You unlikely get covid fully vaccinated (and remains fully asymptomatic duration infection, reasonably likely given vaccination status, possible he's particularly infectious anyway) may expected headline last year, governor leadership blatantly ignored pandemic, ignored science, ignored common sense, play political games people's lives well being. 

They even fired person made official reports person reporting truth!!!

\#SHAME I’ll never forget made fun Biden wearing mask. Google search find articles stating cause death, multiple articles beginning Jan. 31 stating tests ""ruled out"" vaccine cause death. man, comment history loaded posts reveal beliefs Covid. looking angle downplay pandemic. WFH stuff unique approach tune.

Just come say that. don’t agree POV, would respect honesty. mean want show pictures that’s kind weird lol. time life weighed like 195 lbs definitely soft, cut weight stopped drinking lost nearly 20 lbs.

Also swam competitively high school college, I’m athlete compared like 90% country fyi. immune. Please wear mask even 2nd dose. need large portion people vaccinated.  People going nuts here, said ""lock kids permanently everything necessary prevent social development."" 

All said wear masks. Good grief. shitty housing stock severe housing shortage leads people live multi-generational units.

I think lack homelessness anything price tea China, I'm sure fact they're totalitarian dictatorship let people sleep streets helps. odd comment make disease less threat children flu. one talking sacrificing kids. adverse events concern apparently unusual distinctive form blood clotting combined low platelets:  award Least Surprising Development goes to..... every virus ever. Thanks this! Wish government release data Sinovac. AZ Pfizer even split. Moderna arrived recently used vaccinate millions, Novavax Imperial come soon best country chile Je suis mal mean queue. Medicine, sadly, exact science. even happen

Because vaccines aren’t 100% effective means still get infected..? Especially you’re constantly exposed virus like friend Lol, damn autocorrect. I’ll leave you, Smokey. That's good you, kids wildly different.

My 2.5 year old wears mask length grocery store visit I'm extremely grateful that, 3 4 year old wearing one, I'm blaming parent think taking covid seriously. depends jurisdiction report (count) cases. states use rule determine state reports case. example, someone Maine lives 50% year Florida (i.e., snowbird), Florida would report case. thing holds true college students. student Cali goes school New York (which equates something like 75% time spent NY), NY would report case. always black white like certain metrics, example, hospital capacity given time, less things work surveillance purposes. contradicts narrative want tell. CDC study said 90% effective two doses happen. vaccinated mean immune. sees lot positive people means interactions much higher chance becoming infected. vaccines 100% effective, someone regularly contact covid-positive people higher chance getting virus even they're vaccinated. Vaccination mean 100% immunity, extremely lower chance getting it. young preschooler young masks toddler. mask absolute pageantry preschooler. touches face 100% on, doesn’t think twice putting back falls ground, it’s difficult convince keep nose. 

I’m sorry I’m going micromanage young child’s play interactions another year. reason teachers thought masks kids school laughable idea. That’s don’t stand make shit up. two year old asks wear mask bc want get left out. understand kid different though they’ll likely fine. That's supposed ask firmly, politely, leave kids daycare since opened back June. Kids 5 aren’t wearing masks daycare center. babies haven’t Covid. 3 yo doesn’t wear mask 13 kids age. wears mask situations daycare far it’s ok, even post holiday Covid peak. couple cases COVID since started place October. It’s never spread kid brought whatever happening outside daycare. COVID either kid’s rooms, been, it’s asymptomatic. strict requirements we’ve closures waiting COVID tests I’m comfortable center handling it. Lol 4 yr old daughter chews mask. refuses wear mask see bite marks them! Like wtf! wash mask it’s clean it’s gross now. kid needs job buy mask fairly obvious say everything political politics. Thanks this. think valuable talking point trying persuade hesitant people. There's really nothing ""wait see"" point existing COVID vaccines. BMI screening tool excess fat risk metabolic syndrome. way describe isn’t really anybody interprets it. definitely useless. suggested thing,that may gotten AZ shot got Covid 2 week window building immunity.

They say happens(clots) 3-14 days shot(same amount time incubation period Covid )what got Covid 2 week immunity window clots caused Covid vaccine.

I got downvoted oblivion 

I would hope would test see positive Covid could vaccine affect results give false negative? feel hard. took MONTHS us working 2 year old, recently tolerate 30 min grocery store trip (she 2.5). 

Before ready? way wearing mask, even 5 min. Yup, 6 yo forgets take mask often put on. counting Russian Chinese vaccines? Russian Sputnik V vaccine 91% effective COVID-19 makes 4% less best vaccines Pfizer Moderna.

Canada also suspended AZ today reasons sound boo 3rd time round

Next   already see child vaccine becoming next way goalposts getting moved.

I tired depressed. Command You!!!!!!!!! here, town skews older, surely makes sense. indicate either genetic role efficacy vaccine they’re lying getting vaccinated covid mean ones undergoing fill/finish EU order fill/finish site Italy? I'd expect ready now. Oh happened flu too? Germany 'just' left Garage December, 3.5 months ago. long excuse going hold? First dose first hope made right decision... 

Narrator: didn't. happened sub? ""back normal""? Lol Providing medical records enter random building travel? nothing HIPAA? That's matter public debate, something authorities try impose misinformation. Got first dose Pfizer yesterday. (My appointment site giving Pfizer Moderna didn’t know one you’d get sat saw sign station.) arm hurts raise (just took two Tylenol initial dose yesterday) I’m pretty tired. think I’m going take day work second shot case. 

I complaints appointment site ran though. called people outside based appointment time (appointments set 10-minute intervals, like 8:10, 8;20, etc.), checked IDs temperatures walked in, told station go to. looked busy, able get link request appointment coworker someone mom knows. could delay second shot Q3 use first shots prevent deaths. Original statement correct. virus manipulated (handled) 2016 sequence data. hands lab since 2013. factual statements. least disputed.

If know else done lab please feel welcome share. assume language means mean order knock strawmen pointing linguistic inconsistencies helpful. Also generally useful assume someone shares link actually read it. J&amp;J says vector immunity isn’t important also, I’d bet wait two three months, antibodies vector drop. suggestion clotting may caused vaccine injected vein rather muscle. Drawing back check blood would eliminate this. What's point comparison though? Germany much limited number doses they're receiving, getting doses. unproven, imagine we'll find vaccines effective young people absolute relative scale.

Compared placebos, probably young people show greater efficacy robust immune response. Remember trials included people 18+, though worth noting 25% trial participants 65+. probably see higher efficacy 18-40 range slightly lower 65+ range. Then, absolute level, young people already less susceptible COVID. I'd imagine vaccines, given young people, going even effective number touted trials. Probably, prevalence community abates, COVID infections young people fully vaccinated relatively rare event. Soooo commute work risky covid vaccine? *gasp*  Doesn’t moderna Pfizer vaccine work variant? ""experts"" going conversation they're going say whatever think necessary keep people distanced, wearing masks etc. even strongly suspect vaccinated means can't transmit virus. super frustrating. are. government afraid people think they’ve enough pandemic stealing fun. Sine we’re federal republic respective heads state saying execution rules Merkel. there’s endless discussion effective disease prophylaxis. Take fucking xanax go get shot share urgency expand authorization vaccine use younger populations encouraged clinical trial data adolescents ages 12 15,"" Bourla said. Uğur Şahin, CEO Pfizer's German partner, BioNTech, said statement results ""encouraging given trends seen recent weeks regarding spread B.1.1.7"" variant coronavirus, shown transmissible. Pfizer's Phase 3 clinical trial adults found vaccine around 95 percent effective preventing symptomatic illness. Wow that’s great. I’m actually surprised ever say 100% anything protection instead 99.9% example. Great news! They're still giving people first shots early April, they're supposed apply approval 6-7 weeks later? math add up.  need vaccine first doses delay second dose third quarter, would improvement. Thanks. Hm. Covid worse...are serious? kids fine. experience NC. Fantastic organization. scheduled outside drive-thru, storms came texted us come inside site handled everyone short waiting time. banner said they'd delivered 50k vaccines one site fuck guy No, selfish piece shit. I'd rather child home safe die covid-19.  Ultimately recognize vaccine way shit. work, everyone wants one get one. Seeing people like Sunetra Gupta support vaccinations also makes support them.

But I'm still mildly skeptical vaccine. Pfizer J&amp;J history suppressing adverse effects products getting fined lots money it. government says literally can't liable vaccine side-effects, worries me. also like double-standard of, ""Any death within 30 days positive COVID result COVID death, death immediately following vaccination necessarily vaccine death.""

Rambling aside, want country drown vaccines. absolutely support vaccine passports sort vaccine mandate. mistrust pharmaceutical companies still exists. want vaccine available everyone wants it, get point, want restrictions end. them. want government mandate vaccine approved FDA. want government punish people want get vaccinated trust companies. want government drag restrictions arbitrary number people gets vaccinated. want government/corporations think need carry safety theater nonsense COVID eradicated. want everyone worried getting COVID get vaccine, that's it.  first time encountered someone know hesitant getting vaccine talking neighbors. wife said think citing lack long term knowledge especially regards desire kids future.

I respect someone choosing wait caution reasons like also said things conflicting wrong. One people need natural immunity provided vaccines sentence saying vaccines tell body spike protein looks like confusion lack use live virus vaccines. also discredited effectiveness took issue completely stopping kind like ""Well still get vaccinated bother"" mentality. 

I ended walking away loudly saying ""That bullshit!"" replied saying ""obviously I'll stay away people I'm sick"" pointing asymptomatic pre-symptomatic spread replied ""I've read things dispute virus allowing that.""

We're year people still idiots science. Good. time season starts Aug/Sep. Way past time fully reopen.  Depending are, though, they’re *not* coming social awkwardness. Lots kids getting together families play dates throughout. Hopefully gulf closes quickly. fuckin something like idk close playgrounds? Yal wants kids die got first shot FEMA site NC. Full FEMA employees national guardsmen working Okay, likely happen? There's balance - means hermit also going party 500 people every single night. way vaccines rolling out, completely changes game takes way much risk - risk death/hospitalization. Everything life risk risk almost everyone willing take vaccines even widespread lot people willing right now. Sure, it’s possible months data decide authorize it. 

To point, doctors already losing license practice therapeutics talk hcq treatment. totally wrong. shouldn’t way, it’s actually what’s happening times. 

So I’m saying “shouldn’t be” doesn’t mean won’t happen. 

“15 days slow spread” Here's thorough study 10 million people finds asymptomatic spread denying science, I'm looking facts available. I'm going dig Google search result, apparently that's time research. Stop denying science agree it. even frustrating couple months ago b117 growth seeing, push get everyone upgrade masks. Instead released disastrous ""double mask"" theory work extent, practice people breath vague exactly make work. anyone really listening thing guy saying? Excess deaths higher reported COVID cases almost every state. article even ""research"" paper seems like plain politics. “kids resilient” like keep hearing, need thousands thousands therapists help people get past bad stuff happened kids? parent believe hardest part pandemic 4 year old. recently put back part time preschool take risks mental health. basically stuck inside house year, play dates, barely even seeing family public outings. hard. want badly protect youngest virus, can’t keep stuck house another year. really wish something do, sadly isn’t. hoping doesn’t effect long run. Licking he’s 4 youngest turned 2 shouldn’t harmful, seeking therapy stuff oldest case. Life risk. I'm happy people get hurt die, reality risk near zero need live it!

I'm super pro-vaccine, lived year full quarantine, realize risk/reward kids far better ratio get kids.

Polio, small pox, ebola, etc totally understand; Covid seems near zero chance death/injury kids. Living kids may increase risk disease! kids disease... imo 2 clueless. “At start pandemic, Whitmer relied two separate state laws issue health orders. fall, Michigan Supreme Court ruled one law unconstitutional Whitmer legislative approval use other. 

However, ruling way limited authority state health department director issue similar orders.”

The Supreme Court stripped powers, republicans. she’s still issuing orders via health department. Stop. Politicizing. Public. Health. And. Safety. mask son going playground. hard he's 5. year. Enough. can’t keep going forever. Let’s go back time.

2007 would nice. I’m nj too! Fully homeschooling three kids, 7, 6, 3. parks awful crowds people adhering masks distancing. kids wear masks choice see crowded parks. even question families aren’t masked. baffles me. That’s unfortunate. Kids tested positive common outbreak daycares teachers due activities outside work. Hopefully friend vaccinated give protection! Yeah love idea well Finally fucking comments make sense robotic regurgitated rhetoric. Someone knows biostatistics. 9m doses today?  Well, Flu kill 500,000 Americans last year, it?

Please quit ""ItS FlU"" shit. did. What's timing convention measure r rate? example 100 cases transit 53 etc. within set amount days weeks? Oh wow that's awesome! im saying im waiting bit. dont really care going anyway since like huge BLAST toddler lol. 
literally easiest thing sacrifice.

AstraZeneca nothing, I'll definitely still take AstraZeneca. I'd vastly prefer one mRNA vaccines. safety concerns, AZ's efficacy B135 variant absolutely garbage - little better placebo preventing mild moderate infection (the jury still whether prevents hospitalization death B135, last heard). P1 shares lot B135's mutations, there's good chance AZ also effective either.

1. Moderna
2. NovaVax
3. Pfizer

Unfortunately us Moderna, first quarter international production small despite basically 2nd line right behind US, still got 2 million Q1.  Q2 expecting another 12 million them.

NovaVax huge order amount committed supply, ust unfortunate bit behind approval.

And countries bet big Pfizer. IDPH said die anything test positive covid labeled covid death

Apparently incorrect. Dying \*with\* covid dying \*from\* covid.  listed death certificate make primary cause death. 

Dr. Ngozi Ezike says so. I'm fine I'll keeping close eye partner another week then! hesitancy seems increase younger age groups high percentage 65+. (Wisdom age, folly youth).

I think folks 65 afraid dying, younger get less people afraid dying. 

We need figure ways encourage young folks afraid get shot, especially areas broad societal hesitancy.

Like said, long supply outstrips demand. think April fine since eligibility go wider, go May might hit wall. Fortnight common word UK, assume, Ireland. First lot complaining word ""jab"". feel stupid, used get appointment 2nd I'm excited unless missed something, can't tell vaccine I'm getting. Like end day matter assume one Moderna Pfizer since mentioned two I'm still curious though. first thing fully vaccinated run without mask legal minefield states hoping need to.

Trump also promised would 100,000,000 doses ready go Dec 31st, wise enough help companies ramp production even completed trials.

Except didn’t that. signature plan even lied that.

Pathetic. wanna rock roll night wonderful time. word official vaccine approvals? Also, anyone know deal would mandate one vaccine (like Pfizer) approved? feel like situation business could mandate specific vaccine needing provide exemptions another vaccine, effectively mandating vaccine. something like ever happened before? age verification, identification purposes confirm appointment.

That’s CVS checking, appointment. 31 cases blood clotting disorder people got vaccine.

How many cases severe COVID people similar age get vaccine? grandmother might said: lips God’s ears. simply spike protein created body react too, prompting stronger immune response greater antibody levels initially. 

The second dose forces body create antibodies (AHH SPIKE PROTEINS!) reinforces immune response.

This suggested reason spreading AZ vaccine doses 12 weeks better gives body chance 'forget' first 'infection' antibodies start dissipate forces recreate antibodies fight new 'infection' leading powerful response future.

It would bit like Batman vs Joker

Round 1: Batman might beat bit, hes new villain block caused little trouble.

Round 2: Batman comes ready batmobile best gadgets ready bunch tricks knows Joker like villain! combine production take place year world, able vaccinate huge chunk world. EU receive year enough vaccinate billion. think China India gotten vaccine production speed, getting peoples arms problem. It’s amazing difference months make. I've noticed trend social circle really skinny people arm pain. joked buddy went bone muscle shit. comes covid death tally Illinois categorized covid deaths test positive.
Again, know percentage assume low. Seems like started earlier fault 🤷 Yeah here's problem though. Germany example requires negative test enter country. however accept rapid antigen tests.

Here's study validity covid-19 tests

In people confirmed COVID‐19, antigen tests correctly identified COVID‐19 infection average 72% people symptoms, compared 58% people without symptoms.""

Basically, unless symptoms, might well flip coin. test result might negative, travel, reliable. did! got first dose pfizer yesterday. Side effects mild far I'm keeping thoughts positive. Good you. 

A lot us wearing masks others. true. Well, give antivax friend ammo may true. Moderate mild infection something afraid of. lived moderate mild infections various sources centuries.

Yes, that's true. That's reason brought article. brought article makes point yet able conclude findings translate clinical settings something seem ignoring. vaccine 85% effective severe disease cases matter infectious variant, deaths hospitalizations trial occurred among people got placebo, vaccine.

This good result still, even article tempered line: also raised question whether vaccines might lose power variant faster would SARS-2 iterations. long protection elicited existing vaccines lasts, version virus, remains open question. Essentially, researchers track vaccinated people watch immunity wanes. weaker response could start dissipate said Novavax J&amp;J results serve rallying cry global scientific community — including vaccine makers regulators — prepare, case B.1.351 variant form SARS-2 able “escape” immune protection ways trial data yet show. said people shouldn’t assume vaccines appeared guard severe disease B.1.351 trial, people carry protection long period.

Again seems still air things shake new variants, though good reason believe vaccines offer protection severe disease know extent point make think articles I've linked tend make. keen ignoring that. pretty clear data clinical trials, well real world scenarios countries like Israel support claim vaccines prevent hospitalization death current variants covid.

Data Israel probably gives us good indication vaccine protects severe disease B.1.1.7 I'm sure much tells us variants far I'm aware of. I'm reading seems B.1.1.7 dominant variant. something tells us variants link that? 

I understand can't back claim say something like, ""we pretty good idea vaccines offer us protection severe disease. newer variants, still air though promising results. seems early able tell exactly results translate larger clinical settings."" Instead taking stance ""the current variants major impact USA"". know that's case talking current variants like B.1.351. Thx work bb Nice. Friday can’t come soon enough 1st one! please ban definitely group public places? get it’s choice, don’t want take choice away anyone. also, fuck diseased asses. Yahoo! EU ordered vaccine wanted AZ stockpile big delivery right approval. Also point. AZ applied approval EU late compared UK. approval process EMA faster one MHRA. yes UK start using earlier. that's fault EU. low? 

the antivax crowd  :-/ Holy shit kid read headline hahahaha still got guaranteed purchase orders benefited hugely sped-up approval process. normal speed, FDA would still considering application - considering application conduct phase 3 trial. forgot “genetics” Lol. miss going full stadium maskless kills saves common divorce attorney recommending therapy guess. would ever emerge home 2 weeks second dose wait booster even higher efficacy!?!”

Because scientific evidence points maximum efficacy 95% 2nd dose. get higher study endpoint vaccine. None. Period.

After Dose 1, hand? Could low 29%, per one study. 46%, per another. 52% per another. Could 80%

So may happy take risk yourself, taking risk people forced around risk tolerance

Yes, exactly. comes virus transmissible easily Sars-CoV-2, personal risk tolerance affects people.

Let's say get first dose. decide I, personally, OK taking risk get sick start wearing mask. 

And maybe bet pays - ME. never feel much scratchy throat. mean infect server waiting me, also waiting get shot, though. bus driver daily commute. coworkers.

The way look this: 2 weeks post 2nd Dose, pretty much EVERY study shows least risk around you. Dose 1? Eh, science place. wait sake others, yourself? reopen Cali fully like FL Ah, old Reddit switcheroo world happened Europe? That's insane rise cases! course cases jumping state well wow Europe fire covid looks like. gross yet shocking least non-issue regards mass vaccination absolute risk damn low.

Not lying availability vaccines stockpiled, causing states hold back reserves weren’t shipped vaccines promised. That’s goooooood good shit 😤 Well, EU offered doses declined... France tried boost sanofi, eastern Europe stingy. Biontech approached german government, german company, leadership stated ""eubased solutions focus"".

Oh completely agree you. downvoted yesterday sub ridiculing claim test trace best world. government organise piss brewery I’m glad I’m getting 1st Pfizer shot Friday. really. ever allergic reaction vaccine ingredients vaccine, us recommended get vaccine bc new vaccine therefore there's higher rate allergic reaction.

and cant anymore. 
i reteach 4 year child play interact kids cuz hes stuck home wife

they need peer play MUCH stage. certain point worth it. preserving? survive socially TWO years behind everyone else age? 

so wears mask 99% time hes one
and playground super crowded try find another one

but eventually gotta gotta do. 

a year many mornings us tears searching place play...its fucking much. 
my wife full vaxxed need basic shit like letting 4 year old play peers

were gonna go crazy start going restaurants . gonna play

fuck
this
year  vaccination, can’t wait get shot - even would prefer get AZ one sure. H.W. Bush record approval ratings first gulf war, recession hit. Considering we're going pay trillion dollar packages point hold breath. problem won’t know it’s safe fully reopen fully reopen. explain incredibly low case/death rates countries (South Korea, etc.)? policies would've implemented U.S. would result fewer deaths now? Moderna Pfizer protected two weeks, symptomatic infection.

Anyways, that's said 2wks everyone chance get first dose, they're eligible. Basically walk anywhere get jab without appointment; 2 weeks that. dare get emotional (hopefully) return kind normalcy last year. nerve!  It’s dozens isn’t. think people least know possibility. Damn right! know downvoted me, saying going. could done paid sick leave let nearly 15 million people lost employer provided health insurance enroll Medicare. Like another user stated, resources restrictions. feel like direction continued blackout too, people seem want good news sub. Anyone even suggests little caution getting shut treated like asking 12 months shit, despite every time throw caution wind bit us ass. unfortunate individualist mentality continued much damage throughout pandemic never got bad counties acted community. Even restrictions lifted thing NJ continue vaccinate would still bad. Tough summer talk weird scare tactic. data have, basis reality. US 95K deaths single month? Germany total 76K deaths since beginning pandemic. soon condescending towards essential workers rely every day stopped listening thats happened 2 shots? really hoping tested single dose given scarce supplies are, added complexity inoculate kids 2nd time. Upvoting list solutions could used largely didn't.

I think lockdowns necessarily bad last March gathered information got first surge. I've become frustrated extent decided moralize throw around insinuations people responsible would pandemic instead allowing people avoid unnecessary exposure creating safe ways people get social recreational needs met instead driving people inside private gatherings. arm likely gonna hurt tomorrow read much it, seems like Brazil well. vaccination efforts? vaccinating well US? Yep. Apparently variant nore transmissable virulent. Yes be. probably announced 3 week school closue travel ban virus spread ""accelerating control""  
Weren't news Covid back? spread misinformation. **~3.25 MILLION people** Florida fully vaccinated. “Dozens” completely negligible. 

These non-stories need stop. LOL right?! 

Even always cautious Dr. Facui said vaccines seem highly protective new variant strains. leading experts said vaccinated people socialize small groups. Pretty much Germany said it, thought? since stuck it, propaganda. spread misinformation. I'm getting shots PA. highly competent governor former HS set system LOTS shots go fatties smokers coming NY, NJ, OH. infuriating. I’ve managed get appointments family I’ve keep Rite Aid website Vaxxmaxx website open side side.

Honestly like mandatory marathon opt turn around .2 miles finish walk opposite direction while, world desperately trying get past going right direction. goes ways, obviously, don’t think treating government monolith makes much sense. Different politicians going interpret CDC’s research different ways. eager reopen, prioritizing reducing death toll much can. Idk “the government” since government’s response hardly unified ONE ever said vaccines 100% effective. people really think getting vaccinated means 0% chance contracting Covid??

No pretty much know fully vaccinated even contract COVID likely going mild symptoms incredibly unlikely end hospital it.

The goal eradicate COVID. never been. like goal eradicate rhinovirus influenza. goal make sure people dying it. Ironic one first things person says “I don’t care say unless you’re dr fauci/a leading expert” 

I’m guessing person isn’t leading virologist, logic, disregard ridiculous rant plus side almost certainly getting injected nurse technician. experience likely get crappy shot experience doctor tend give relatively infrequently.

And *that* zero sum game, get appointment, someone else *not* getting appointment. 25%~ refuseniks plus 25%~ kids we’re gonna stall long way herd immunity. Still hovering around 50% plus whatever natural immunity half lot better January. seem recall something special diseases listed lost ability jump species and/or mutate made possible virtually eliminate vaccinations. gets better reception iphone I'm gonna pissed. I'm Alabama. brother-in-law super Christian, right wing, ""muh freedom!"" type. 

Anyway family got Covid fall smells gasoline 24/7. 

Yet he's still fence vaccine.

You can't help stupid. Fauci got pulled away public speaking subject, go back briefing government officials private

I understand logic though: Fauci showing bad giving advice public, makes think advice private better? difference flu vaccination isn’t large. It’s 42% lowest state 57% highest state (2019-20 CDC data), almost within 5% other. 

Minorities also least likely choose get vaccine, people red areas. South Dakota Nebraska top 6 7 flu vaccine states NJ, Hawaii, California bottom 15. much partisan issue lockdowns been. Overall least 50% people going get vaccinated pretty much everywhere around 30-40% already gotten virus immune continue level immunity reinfection wanes time anyway. country herd immunity low level spread nothing worry big picture.  FYI, shot won’t included tomorrow day after. Reporting lags day two data compiled starting 6 am. Depending country referring to, U.S. much closer 2 pieces candy 100 poisonous 15 100 cause long term problems like chronic fatigue and/or long term lung damage. 

Personally, I'd avoid eating it. isn’t 1% chance dying vaccine thats good news... virtually 0%. sure getting at? EU purchase agreement basically stopped incentives countries invest heavily vaccine manufacturing benefits shared across whole EU. EU commission slow frugal putting money towards vaccine manufacturing limited production. Oh declined offers Pfizer vaccine seen expensive huge amounts ended getting exported. it’s like... why? Vaccine eligibility vaccine availability % population vaccinated. goal based % vaccinated makes total sense.

People assholes, basically.

I'm even eligible vaccine yet, getting appointment going difficult weeks even I'm eligible.

Furthermore, get vaccine, *still* going take several weeks I'm safe (*if* I'm safe - things effective, 100%).

People babies taking basic precautions. know isn’t point, vaccines like Novavax come soon  guarantees hospitalisation thought better aspect every vaccine. efficacy also still goo enough anyway. blood clot issue proven false unrelated. side effects aren’t bad anyway. T-cell reactivity strong MRNA antibody activity across major variants concern. 

While diminished antibody front, still levels neutralization needed lab. going rate increase. good rate though. Lmao. Jesus Christ. idea cause effect are, you?

Lockdowns make numbers go down. Removing numbers make numbers go up. Wow!!!!! don’t care slice it, less 10% population vaccinated won’t anything reduce spread extremely good article. advocating ""ring vaccination"" without realizing term. Get vaccines beaches, college towns, inner cities vaccinate everyone let fast can. UK seen 4 cases particularly rare type blood clot following AZ vaccination 13.7 million doses.

Wanted ask tears joy side effect joke seem appropriate. want hear anymore ""But flu vaccine!"". ""The"" flu vaccine flu vaccine, several vaccines several strains. works great ones actually immunizes great others, surprising.

Anyhow, mRNA stuff definitely good stuff. AZ J&amp;J sell every country needs whatever get. we're like 10 20 billion yearly doses production capacity mRNA Covid obviously use those. Fantastic news!  Thank you. Came say same.  Surprising direction? assume trial US, still massive cases. kids could get anywhere, parents, school, ect. guess would shortly clinical tests completed current vaccines + booster shot efficacy versus variants, people part original trials start getting serious infections. Hey man, never know another person's situation. Take easy. Sobering. live next Alabama one point 2-3 counties close us I-85 seething cases deaths ( better GA ). local paper printing infographic every day numbers frankly, glad stopped frightening.  Imagine taking Trump talking point seriously Perfect. Belgian government spend next month sourcing n95/kn95 masks general population wear proper mask done it. Incorrect. Last Wednesday 3.1mil. sure guys, absolutely appalled took CDC long enough realize this. need get many people vaccinated possible. It’s fine CDC health experts concerned tell us keep guard keep sanity focus things currently control mainly getting vaccinated (got first moderna dose) still taking reasonable precautions hoping see Covid numbers plummet stay there. 57,600 COVID deaths. would equivalent 90,000 deaths U.S. one month, adjusting population.

January U.S. saw 95,000 COVID deaths - give idea bad things here. US kicking ass vaccine rollout. Props everyone involved, sure. plenty examples, e.g., hundreds people die swimming pools every year. vulnerable protected well anyone else wants be, doesn’t matter cases don’t result death hospitalization going around.

I mean, yes agree completely, vaccines super protective thankfully *need* suppress eliminate community spread COVID protect vulnerable people thanks that. question asked whether reach herd immunity, whether deaths hospitalizations become untied case counts vulnerable people vaccinated even COVID continues community spread. comment responded initially getting downvoted accurately answering herd immunity summer mathematically unlikely, although seems rational people swung heavily upvoted, consensus swung right always spread

Maybe! think still open question answered time. *completely* given possibility enough people get vaccinated keep tuning vaccines common variants show could eventually end finding way mostly suppress community spread COVID way viruses like mumps - think kind depends exactly quickly new vaccine-evading variants emerge (relatedly) long vaccine immunity lasts, really know answers yet. Seems pretty unlikely ever get point, know sure yet. know it’s time boosters? Like, 6 months counting.

No one knows. 13 months still need lockdown, maybe start ask questions 'lockdowns proven work"". Maybe work well destroy well livelihoods people. scheduled get vaccine almost two hours away tuesday first time anything available You’re understanding me, didn’t say lol Going school? Hanging friends? Working supplement family income? Visiting relatives? surprised teens got it, got it? don’t see quarantine requirements mainland US. others ramp up? Pfizer Moderna? know yet many months vaccines protect virus? beatings continue morale improves. Thanks posting. Yeah Spain can't go walk park alone 10pm crowd 25 people smoking without mask sight right outside building apparently concern police 🙄 lockdowns worth it? question can't really addressed scientifically. Lockdowns bad, healthcare system collapse worse. there's way run experiment lockdown see happens hospitals. really say appeared necessary.

Here's CDC study confirming masks indoor dining bans prevent disease: shore.  Great hear, since days ago reported ""no-vax"" care workers refused vaccine later infected several elders covid care home. (source: ) 100 people maybe even caught Covid right shortly second dose full protection? dont think 100 million big deal, like said. Okay bad lol I'm trying read covid news anymore I'm really date anymore. fact thinking today might time call quits subreddit. Haven’t lockdown since UK variant first showed up? Yes, however, sun emits tons UV light destroys virus (as well skin, annoyingly). get saying, feel office politics sort colors everything within pond still say. Like institution within anti-science like authoritarian country, matter time top corruption gets it. Broadway show? can’t think ideal super spreader event. You’re stacked like cordwood cheap seats way front row. 

Maybe vaccine passport system running it’d fine. letting people good faith would madness.  comments scanned job platforms create profiles, rank job applications. CA 60% cases population density Texas. Unnecessary risk bad governance. law gives 60 days emergency powers. legislature need pass new law tell governor says 'no, really, 60 days'. legislature never pass law rescind illegal orders. Excellent, unused crates fill warehouses with. Brits turn everything totalitarian nightmare, even TV. Orwellian-style TV licensing net, example.

Do think planned this, think hyenas try get share? Vaccinated people free live lives normally. suppose aware reputable sellers? see eBay, got counterfeit box N95s earlier pandemic. I'm loop know r/OutOfTheLoop IIRC factor J&amp;J? Maybe weeks ago. always should. things going around COVID. Hell no. cure worse disease point. think u/dxraemxn's situation likely far removed enough taking immunosuppressants autoimmune disorders impossible ascribe results studies his/her specific situation.

My best advice talk doctor specific situation. hard imagine sort defined condition, I'd bet idea. not, likely good idea find out. meanwhile, cautious. can't give specific medical advice (see doctor, cautious) internet, obviously. Look person's comment history. -396 sub alone.

They're troll. Anecdote? think parable. teaching story point, will. I’m celebrating right now. try stop me, yo.

(You won’t able to) Exactly this. much eloquent me. Covid isn’t real! can’t make get vaccinated! /s person flies solo lot, back plane im time - highest chance find row empty middle seat. Misunderstood. Sorry, here's upvote back  fun second Made. 

It hasn’t like decades. dawg yet commented lol Widespread vaccine availability + passing one-year anniversary lives put hold. 

It's over. We're ready either move forward past COVID, learn live it. Can't go back lockdown never left lockdown...big brain move toronto think varies state demand. high demand states, described process.

Source: I've helped lot friends family get vaccine high demand area past weeks    get though. fly super cheap Europe, US like $400 matter short flight. Even short flights tons traffic. Sounds like it’s problem lockdowns people ignoring meeting privately.

And small private gatherings problem, shows important masks public gathering restrictions are. I'm last line vaccine. I'm probably getting mRNA vaccine.

Unless there's something new J&amp;J vaccine heard yet, takes longer two weeks effective.  don’t fly coach.....they offer first class/business.

Oh ""be rich"", think that! airlines literally giving people want.

No, not. found absolute tiniest sliver ""this worth it"" ""I deal coffin hours"". offered premium legroom seat width throughout whole cabin historically always go bankrupt people buy flights based price.

Where say ""premium""? making absurd assumptions want? say every seat like first class completely lay flat. 

I said steerage. is. seats narrow. enough leg room. 5'5"", WELL average height male, get cramped. God fucking help tall person sits next literally fit legs straight forward. want change contact representatives Washington mandate minimum seat pitch width.

I have. level playing field airlines would also drive cost flights.

Oh no!!!! We'd pay 1/30th per ticket!!!

That's math works out. Remove one row give everyone full extra inch legroom. 

If airlines gave shit efficient they'd give everyone one free checked bag charge $50 per overhead carryon. They'd also board back-to-front, window-to-aisle. 

They don't. care charging every possible thing can. intentionally separate parties punish paying extra fee LUXURY choosing sit. 

If executives forced fly seats rest us shit would change overnight. Nervous excitement coupled partial disbelief. reaction. Yawn. trials said 95% effective, 100% effective. people get COVID fully vaccinated: 5% many would've gotten otherwise. Welcome 'Black Mirror'. spent lot less production stage. It’s really unfortunate feel German people.

That actually true. According news articles companies received funding germany apparently even spend money.

But also look marburg plant germany yearly output 1 billion doses BioNTech vaccine. got approved start outputting doses soon.

Germany also heavily invest production. Tennessee's handling pandemic shitshow. using us example everyone else follow. Every time get close handling thing, mandates get rescinded two weeks later cases spike again. folks sit around wondering could ever happen. People around seem understand cause effect, minimum.

Not mention, Lee worthless. Dude literally political ad Nashville Broadway without wearing mask *while city active mask mandate.* Trump opened 60+ lawsuits election? followed CDC guidelines let hospital patients go back HOMES. else supposed go? homeless shelter? get kid sized KF94s though, pretty darn close. got big box kids start going places us. one cares optimistic. We've vaccines decades yet diseases still major reservoirs developing world. fast thing mutates, think we'll fighting long term. think differences too. RNA sequence encoded different Biontech Moderna may also use different mRNA carrier technology, allows storage normal freezer temperature. What's ""!"" certain names look interesting. Fourth list? Cooties. due respect, agree disagree. someone works industry works. dosing would changed like said example. would warrant total re-do trials, point you’re looking “new” product.

I agree could gap *in theory* looks like pharmaceutical companies proactive formal submission process looking gap. Ontario go lockdown again....sigh think idea 'face scanning' fight coronavirus? started 15 days slow spread, waiting vaccines elderly, vaccines everyone, even vaccine scan face... ""When look back situation ten years now, want able say people New York everything could do. everything could do. saving lives everything saves one life, I'll happy.""

-Governor Andrew Cuomo bad, learn read. still need masks? Lately ""completely it"" usually followed caveat, that's case out. We'll learn way learn vaccines. 

When fully vaccinated people get start getting sick COVID-19 again, it'll time get booster. Could 7 months, could 7 years, could never.  Yup, fact governor popular vote winner opposed legislature, really minority trying get people killed tenuous gain. disinformation anyone know much vaccines get made weekly Pfizer? new war anti-vaxxers. Interesting point Apple v Android. Work provides iPhone literally nothing invested except time I've spent learning interface preferred software. really care whole controversy whatsoever since money it. EU approved soon enough. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* fun continuing white knight bio terrorists. 

This made laugh. Tip hat you. amount medical resources used due Covid negligible fall. support people chose vaccinate. pick fights like seem want to, thinking minds changed Reddit snob. Ironically, bet white knight bio terrorists (as put it) approach seems make dig deeper. lol. 

Again, come fall NFL stadiums, consequence you. point still stands. I’m still taking unnecessary chances till it’s way almost zero. absolutely jurisdiction. evidence vaccines work people! Go take them. perspective, *doesn't matter*.

It matters transmit virus me. It’s done. Thanks. see like flu vaccine health care workers- either get vaccine mask work  Imagine common cold virus. get exposed time. Literally every day.

You'll get first child. body raises immune response. body basically keeps refreshing immune response whole life, get common cold adult immune system sense respond it, even response slow incomplete.

If instead raised environment never exposed particular disease pathogen, exposed pathogen later life, tougher task body. EU's database, go figure... Curious one is. Posts like deleted users banned. yeah well use might federal government local law enforcement FORCE inject vaccine

""Just civil bro"" lifting mask mandate pretty cringe, I'm glad vaccines open all. Let's wait see vaccines given full approval, things change rapidly Well fucking duh?! course. It’s extremely rare young teens get first place smh. agree decision. point legislature must play role. Unilateral emergency powers need time limits! protected COVID October gotten doses vaccine (2nd dose 3 months ago)? B!den already said this.

Wh!tmer asked doses redirected Michigan given current surge going on. Wh!te House said they're going keep pro rata distribution.

High demand/low demand little different, much. like doses MS, AL AR going completely unused - they're taking longer. Let respond points:

1. personally able schedule 18 (as today) friends/family/acquaintances vaccination direct result sub. via Vaccinefinder (which shows stock appointments) rather another resource found actually finds appointments well threads Ohio. sub discovered important user contributed content, good chance 18 people helped locally (and bunch I've helped right subreddit) would valuable information perhaps till quite later. see sub critical resource quite frankly gotten better info state's useless sites.
2. meant politics ""office politics""... squabbles administration policies organization. reddit inexcusable I'd every single sub shutting protest. feel one valuable most. following Science™ sub... disappointed. understand feel differently get coming from... different reaction. I’m getting second dose couple weeks. there, giving end May. I’m done BS. don’t care say May 31st. I’m rural area already go 90% places without mask, even though still wear one.

I’m sure I’m majority. Heck, travel like crazy rising since vaccine came out. wife works travel crazy busy. personally belief virus shelf life 60 days left people demand go back normal lives. 60 days we’ll probably 70%!of adults one dose. isn’t good enough might well hide house forever inline comment yesterday. Based Bloomberg’s data, Israel hit 50% March 10th. cases dropping floor. US get 50% even end May looking similar drops late June. Summer gonna fantastic. come close passing blood drawn me. hate needles. said, vaccine needle must insanely thin barely feel it. still less likely give serious issues covid. 1% young people show chronic fatigue syndrom covid. overexitation imunesystem vanish illness heals known occur occassionally eg. flu.

CFS fucks up. According FB parents group town ""the vaccines change DNA way I'll let inject kids"" Hopefully, point, safe go L.A. Knotts Berry Farm Disneyland summer. *Screams European* Lol jump right beating people stick never even *trying* carrot. Never change Reddit.

Why government messaging like ""get vaccine ditch mask!"", Or, least ""we get it, masks served us well time let's honest, suck, let's get vaccinated get back smiling again"".

Instead selling doom gloom vaccinated unvaccinated alike. 

""We tried nothing work!"" take precautions things anyways take precautions?

what changed longer ***requiring*** date, **six states mask mandates covering general public lifted them:** Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Texas Wyoming. Arkansas set join end March, several states slated first half April. lab leak would lead much needed safety overhauls labs across globe. Like maybe don’t directly cities. come wild animals you’d see focus keeping wild animals separate humans efforts preparing viruses. Plus wild animal theory probably ment circulating awhile infectious straight away isnt common novel viruses.

I mean China hush hush it’s pushing towards lab leak and/or knew Covid way earlier letting on. would bring question allowed people travel internationally(Some kind didn’t want country hurt economically Covid?)  see, lot deaths US ton money given citizens heat economy. Places like UK given people money help recovery outlook still possitive. NJ. county in? county mega site get quickly go morning give info. end day people blow appointment call get shot. know several people got Kean way. Anyone know today's CDC update? Yeah, true all. Demand weakened vaccinated many people. opening wide open. Gonna big ass numbers coming shortly. Newsom facing recall, especially among theme park guests. state vaccination rollout increased, think safe say reopen back parks limited capacity mask mandates. touch. Yes.. you’re right Embattled EU politicians claiming something far ""common knowlegde"" still true. no, read article. 90% effective preventing infection.  hate constant reporting ""Presidential Approval Rating."" zero nuance helps drive division. much better get details, like presidential approval rating economy, environment. example, Trump got high marks things like job growth wage growth low income, got obliterated covid overall personality. 

You get much detailed issues think someone can't find single thing like individual president probably part partisan divide problem. Bush great example, course made terrible decisions, support PEPFAR program saved millions lives. Lots love despise time. Well...start talking wills, last requests, end life care etc. Tell many age group condition died, time set estate planning,

Cremation buried? Ventilator no? forth.

That might help encourage them, Exactly!

Shit, kill stuff back seriously doubt improved products going give much trouble.

The antivaxers seen one damn many zombie movies. Jeez - they've hypnotized. Oh yeah, incredible scientific medical achievement, possibly greatest time. one said Woo! Got first dose today. Arm little sore that's notice. Arguably ugliest building campus lol Well, politically charged well germany. Politicans tried improve public opinion AZ came around corner. Az likely remain available request 60. imagine restricted women 55.  That's flawed logic.  I’m hepatitis B. 4 times still luck. vaccines worked though. [Here article Mayo Clinic nice States myocarditis covid uncommon usually resolves own. [this summary shows caused wide range viruses pathogens considered rather innocuous thus typically life-threatening condition. Spontaneous myocarditis occurs independent viral infection typically dangerous. Yeah that’s happens open things loosen restrictions. isn’t news, knew getting adopted “get vaccinated get life” mentality. Thanks! 9,248 sequences identified. 

All takes ***one*** controlled vaccines. also said vaccine stop transmission 

 agree reply too. comment showed trait able know exactly target target simply possible, you’d great PR. endgame? maybe isn’t one - masks forever? probably fine I’d guess would similar vaccinating people already went covid infection. Whether improves immune systems ability fight covid interesting IgG AU/ml vaccinated people covid look promising. NBA playing right now.

NFL start 5 months.

&amp;#x200B;

by UNvaccinated section. way nose bleeds. section half full. Oh, get sick. physics. But, gotta live life past year. consistent family’s symptoms. first shot arm hurt really bad days, symptom. second one yesterday arm isn’t sore otherwise symptoms! wife however also got second shot miserable muscle pain/weakness headache. No, fact believe relatively low fatality rate reason open sooner, coming weeks actually. inoculating

I know necessarily message implying, people past, always find little funny ""just"" inoculating big deal. people like Pasteur Edward Jenner figure kind stuff given medical technology times, really incredible stuff.

It's like Copernicus determined Earth revolves around sun, Eratosthenes able calculate remarkably accurate circumference Earth 2000 years ago, consider limitations time were. Absolutely mindblowing. New York suggest then? state even allow people type 1 diabetes register vax general population. Ha! Ok. scoot along. I'm right you. I'm starting think CDC never say ""everything fine."" 2023 we'll going lives 2019-style, CDC still carrying ""be scared variants!"" next week MLB **starts** 30%

(and that's locked California)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm guessing 100% MLB end season. desperately want vaccines politicans tried comfort us germans saying AZ safe. take it, ema approves. Multiple politicans stated would received vaccine. Generally notion was, new Situation, previous halt simply precaution change position AZ safety. pretty much media outlets skimmed line general opinion people around me. family members received AZ.

Now, likely administered recommendation general practitioner priority principle partially lifted AZ. Active offers likely happen, AZ available request. assume people still demand it. “I also don’t need be. Experts don’t answers, we’ve learned hard way.”

I use kind logic hire someone mow lawn, never mind surgeon airline pilot. right. kids regularly forget take masks get home school. even notice them. we're going somewhere sometimes put masks car reason. Yeah, got mine 90s, still got scar. Exactly. Millions people received vaccine. incidence rate conditions tens people every million statistically significant difference normal. that, number lives saved vaccine outweighs number any-cause deaths illnesses vaccine *still* net benefit population. many antivaxxers thread acting like medicine good zero side effects kind. News flash: *all* medicines side effects, aspirin antibiotics vaccines dietary supplements.  important distinction many Redditors, religious Faucian fervor, forget make.

Also might anti one vax others, example, I'm anti Astra Zenaca vaccine pro Johnson Johnson.  Clip CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky yesterday (on MSNBC) sharing summary title disgusting deleted. Exactly. whole world there's propaganda hide behind.

Literally, whole world.
Must scary guilty lying, huh. [A majority fans Super Bowl 7,500 health care workers vaccinated given free tickets, league said, sell 14,500 tickets customers required get inoculated. Given amount Germanic ancestry English people have, hard imagine there's genetic disorder fairly common across Germany Scandinavia, absent Britain. risk bad Covid  believe UK data sincere. fall, better fucking done vaccinations.

WTF Biden, Walensky, Fauci, every damn public face US govt. touting vaccines amazingly effective, literal goddamn medical miracles endgame every time speak.

This focus hypothetical negatives, impending doom BS, isnt helpful all. factories ? Send mean send one country another. means AZ delivered doses UK EU. expat friend heading back states father’s funeral san fran. probably two weeks. California resident. get j&amp;j vaccine and, so, how? women 50s-60s, taking pill hormonal BC. Maybe clarify (god knows I'm educated this). vaccine's specifically target spike protein? Therefore mutation *completely mutates away spike protein* take away element virus made dangerous first place? found want post sub Reddit, CARE downvotes, sub goes trends, day might downvoted something later proves true, one must participate without affected much downvotes day, trenes... Bold work here. OP asking terrible question preparedness standpoint. responder correct pointed either people would die quickly virus would spread less due that, society would basically incubation period caused delayed onset death spread symptoms. Shit - worse day basic, remember? Like 20 vaccinations walked long hall?

Yup remember well lol. got based overseas another round shots! Records every shot kept track folks freaking vaccine passports, going decades! Note study (released yesterday) \*infections\* overall; merely severity symptoms. Getting infected free. Getting treatment may bankrupt you.  US sending AZ doses, I'm quite sure criticism. Time tell always report almost 0 vaccines sunday monday likely weekend backlog yes, whole week around 30M doses. Congratulations! remember feeling cathartic got first shot. Nobody knows, many different reasons pandemics, covid 20% deadly, would probably mean symptoms would much worse, symptoms would show much earlier, meaning could probably isolate everyone sick, big problem covid even know someone infected without test, due asymptomatic infection quite common compared viruses. Tin foil hat theory: cases ... overlooked, due high dependency AZ shots UK.  want J&amp;J vaccine.

And get mine (someday) I'm going give flying fig unvaccinated person wants hang me, risk take.

It's sad people think way. time country got around setting production, embargo countries going shipping millions day.

Look Canada, they're building vaccine factory, going anything vaccination efforts US already sending AZ doses. Maybe I’m way opinion (I usually am), truly felt scared needed go script tell Americans scared is, maybe shouldn’t CDC director. need someone who’s going give us forward guidance hope, still getting message hold bit longer. don’t need someone tell us scared something like 30% Americans received first dose vaccine, however many others natural immunity already. Scaring us looming new waves strains isn’t going anything productive, giving us hope vaccine normalcy around corner. rollout besides Biden one? Trump even plan think fucked (unless do..., JK), got mine, 29 march, but, certainly, get today...

But try remain calm effects (so far), would getting today... shit. live Russia serve normal since summer. Maybe already antibodies mostly Christian Drosten likely best virologist earth I’m sure math made decision Charité chief virologist of. Maybe educate bit ;-p really hope true. would love go Dolphins-Jets MetLife see Dolphins smash Jets lol. probably insignificant number. people donate platelets too. common they're platelet donors, solution simple. astrazeneca certain period donating. Wait... pluralize Ohioan, add apostrophe? Bizarre. I’ve given trying explain thing too.  I’ve also told report posts malicious misinformation instead engaging trolls. get - feel need confront misinformation want people go get killed. mods seem prefer delete misinformation posts people confront it. Sorry, strong vaccine passports. meant messaging really needs focus ""vaccines key returning normal life."" Vaccine passports make discrimination legal perhaps even resurrect segregation Jim Crow. Keep mind minority groups also highly skeptical vaccine. religious think pledge weird. No! “walk clinics”. We’re well past 75+. Today started 30+ early April it’s moving 16+! totally!! kids care masks, make it.

Kids forced wear face coverings daily seems like weird authoritarian stuff really think it. Lol come steal shots PA. Everyone else NJ, NY, OH seem it. Something along line pet theory, nothing back connecting dots crayon never said interesting think did.  


Do really understand basic implication is? Like holy shit dude talk arguing bad faith. Right? That's got jr data analyst position right college, got huge raise 50k year.  mean- shouldnt surprising. one ever claimed america ever given shit children. wouldnt poverty hunger rates children did. 

they dont vote make policies benefit them? 


anyway... shit year. mad sad depleted defeated. 

hopefully start healing day day Masks certainly worn receptions. wear one go? Surely people would understand want participate much you’d able. would judge wearing mask instead modifying event necessary workable pandemic?

I never said wouldn’t wear one ever, simply acknowledged you’ll wear one benefit yourself. UK bad hug grandkids, go eat, shop, get medical care, mention wild Spring cribbage parties. Plus, like kids, many live congregate settings. News flash John Horton - 20 30 year olds consistently posting highest new case numbers since almost beginning pandemic. (looking canada)

WHAT!? Uh... uh.. um...

**starts injecting intravenous maple syrup random peoples' arms* least Covid. lightbulb, made nice xray bum. Private corporations government crazy already.
""Two weeks slow spread"" ""social distance stop hospitals getting overwhelmed"" total BS, seems.

ANOTHER year kids able see peers facial expressions? Another year masks? make much sense anymore.

Immunizations happening rapid pace let's please focus positive return normalcy get close herd immunity protect vulnerable .  twist anyway possible ignore truth. 20-30% people repeatedly said they’re never going take it. they’re talking trying mandate passports. (more than) half people dont wear masks correctly, r 2meters space people, quarantine isnt done correctly either lot people working hospitals dont cautious (mother works hospital i've seen them, i've heard them) dont get started th people dont wear small children masks let touch everything outside


plz dont come summer greece vacations. wait maybe till autumn least. would still hot. u wont miss sunburns beaches.  go baseball blog year ago, multiple commenters--intelligent, rational ones--were saying likely 2021 MLB season would cancelled 2020 season would played. thanks I'll avoid since isnt even offical.

do wonder use official purposes since traveling prolly require it. Don’t scared smart vigilant. tremendously pampered ungrateful. I'm 37 I'll wait year get anything. wait 2 months get second shot free issue. dude losing mind? give reason would one vaccine? vaccines use target. replying SugarCoatedCart. Vaccine numbers wise countries almost last covid well controlled rush vaccinate, rather wait see adverse side effects countries rushing vaccinations. guess Singapore would top terms vaccinations countries. mean US, none approved yet.  agree! Vaccine passports allow vaccinated live normally, unvaccinated keep putting restrictions  understanding Moderna enrolling children young 6 months trial right it’l could like late summer. Thank god sensible comment thread. Come people. let damn thing circulate chances happening go up. problem beginning. Half-ass measures half-ass compliance drag make things worse. patience, persistence snd damn sense. Y’all worse enemy. “And you’re going need Medical Doctors (M.D.) with.”

And ohh yeah, ever say bleach? I’m still waiting. unbelievable shit us' healthcare system is

 
statement fixed. place explaining english. I'm really evaluating rights wrongs it.

Edit: Oh, misinterpreted read like didnt know this. Anyway, leave anyone wondering. Oh could give 2 shits politics all. I'm happy able get vaccine.

Democrat / Republican / Space Lizard. care party long harm others morally right. 

If allegations Cuomo true prosecuted. Spending 10$ save 1$ American tradition! Forgive me, virus, heard immunity thing? think toddler baby parents like think it’s practical ages, that’s Wow, deranged.  Great. time antivaxxers running rampant, last thing need. That’s heartbreaking, I’m sorry. Tears eyes. socially isolated hard nearly everyone, can’t imagine midst grief raising child. think might another confusing year people raising kids people argue relative risk, family hear things differently based perspective. sincerely hope brighter days future. ❤️ Well, get vaccinated keep masking social distancing encourage them. isn’t first even 3rd time I’ve heard Florida it’s governor.  scenario considered ""most likely"" absence sufficient data adequate cooperation Chinese? ""probe"" pathetic sham. heart goes you. wish could offer hope, longer any.

This really need start admitting cure become worse disease. Masks social distancing children much longer abomination. enough going enough? see mask requirements indoors (at least federal private sector level) lifted well 2022. child 3 hopefully deal fucking masks distancing children goes kindergarten 2023, getting hopes up. 


Sorry, someone say - I'm protecting vulnerable. gave year lives. wore masks, saw family, nothing. Kept child indoors 365 days. protecting us now? Certainly CDC. mental health crisis next pandemic, already becoming that.

 time government starts turning attention mental health socialization children. never will. blinders anything bottom line.    Fuck Fauciiiii ban automod bot Federal Reserve’s projection 6.5% growth rate United States 2021 compares mere 3.7% forecast European economy.

Did **you** read said article? better 20-year olds wait year vaccine. Seriously? Complaining getting vaccine 20 years old? feel wasted her. tell you’ll never worry Guys I'm looking numbers really starting panic...

It looks like another big surge coming, possibly Easter Surge well. I'm kinda freaking here... I’m happy! Though, amount people I’m talking fence virus say getting concerns tbh   suddenly tables turned, meaningful compare two?

It meaningless too. telling me? Rofl, like I'm personally responsible every shitty headline history.  comprehension issues. blamed able attend reception virus worry surrounding it. Masks cannot worn reception, therefore could go, **because** could potentially spread virus due wearing masks. Reading fundamental. 

Again, please point said won’t wear mask. literally repeated exact opposite that. Thanks! need location within 100 miles friends mother, aged 70 received vaccine UK, fit healthy prior vaccine two days later suffered blood clot brain. died couple days later. Lol, almost missed satire. Yep... ""my kid better kid"". Disgusting around. Yep. daughter months age 2. HUGE RANGE development age. I'm sure 2 year olds capable wearing masks. Mine likes play one. bought many masks her. developmentally ready yet. 

The age cut originally meant refer SAFELY wear mask young kids/babies suffocate on. meant indicate age base mask mandate policy on. feel like something got lost translation. suggestion intravenous bleach? Amazing. Absolutely groundbreaking work. oh people genuinely believe saying “could care less” something I’ll never understand. $100 says it’s 14 year old trolling. seen single kid area without one, maybe example adults see. longshot. 20 years old infection fatality rate COVID 1 10,000. I'd take 1 100,000 chance blood clots 1 10,000 chance dying day. 

Sauce IFR: little cousins go around talking “masks stupid” basically anything else parents tell covid.

I can’t blame kids obviously, don’t know better it’s fault. parents ugh 3 feet fine school distancing? MAKES SENSE Um no. thank you. AMA begun live. Please refrain answering questions guest. Thank you. seems best vax right Roaring 20's again. 30 something year old reporting duty! felt unwell day arm sore 10 days. I've also vivid dreams life since jab, odd! that, everything gravy! makes. mom, dad, grandparents 12 too... hm. Interesting. Thanks insight mRNA also new technology. We’re using new way there’s plenty evidence it’s rum hut. want rum hut (in Saskatoon pls). Thank (potentially) contributing incredible effort even though hate us! vaccine actually ***protected*** 900 people vaccine...

Headline: **102 get sick coronavirus despite getting vaccine Washington** goes say numbers expected vaccine working normally, vaccine 90% effective, means 1000 people exposed, 900 would protected 10 would contract COVID. Rather focus 100 got sick, maybe talk 900 didn't? Laurafromlouisville...

R/survivor r/wedding planning... that's needs said. ""How could problem I, protagonist reality, affected?"" cannot get vaccinated. people severe allergic reactions vaccines, thus simply **cannot** get period risking death. compromised immune systems also cannot get it, chemo patients typically no-go herd immunity protects people. 1 person country obese could make argument. 70% america obese overweight start looking structural factors, like heavily subsidized corn grain crops, active transit, sedentary culture revolving around TV. Regardless feel mask mandates, preservation democratic process extremely important times crisis. Crisis authoritarians tend rise power crisis democratic governments come harshest stress.

If Governor Evers wants keep mask mandate place, go legal process so. That's part head authority representative democracy. Checks balances. know this. Sixty days plenty time go formal legal process maintaining health measures like this- He's year.

If rest representatives want measures place, Governor Evers can't convince them, measures stay place. simply democratic process works, matter emergency matters. remember one brothers ten, feel tall tree. I, late teens time, thought surely broken something.

Nope. got laughed off. 66% Americans overweight obese. 78% covid hospitalizations overweight obese. means live healthy lifestyle you’re significantly less likely hospitalized covid, good news  Big true. Well better live 😜 

their messaging honestly laughable trying achieve Meanwhile subreddit anti mask lockdowns. Rip us. Entitleness selfishness always going downfall Im biggest fan needles, nothing compared feeling though. barely feel thing done less 3 seconds. look way time turn head back done. story checks  ""I even know anyone died"" line hear trying discredit it.

If 1 1000 people died, likely know people died. know 2 people died COVID. got mine yesterday. symptom feels like someone punched arm.

**Topic:**

It absolutely fear mongering. goal posts moving subset subreddit dedicated fear mongering ""new already warning this.

Thank you! recognize point you’re making, it’s somewhat callous attribute obesity solely “poor life choices.” Eating disorders something decide have, another contributing factor many people lack structural support properly manage health. C'mon, use ""cause die"" instead ""kill"" pretty indirect. stretching something complain about, may also suggest taking tack viruses fail qualities defines ""life"" immune systems can't ""cause die""? Yeah point news stories regarding vaccination EU point mostly negative various reasons. one mostly positive one, providing hope people, opposite bad news.

There six paragraphs article. first one mostly positive, I'd say 90%. second one neither positive negative. Third one 10% negative. Fourth one 40% positive. Fifth one 100% positive. Sixth one 90% positive. overall positive article. ^((ofc % personal accurate assessment).)

But half full half empty, see things see them. know. Pfizer American company manufacturing capacity US. imported something Europe, would think probably much. mean, aside collaborating German Biontech first place. ""just wait vaccine"" part ALWAYS MEANT vaccine inside certain number people time take affect. bothering listen important part message mean saying along.  accuracy current tests? IIRC they're ~5-10% better this. Unless pliable, like Tampa Bay legend. Figured name extrapolating future, Im using 7 day average. Monday/Tuesday 7 day average, days base number extrapolating ""lower"". balances end result days might shift around theyll shift back days.

If wasnt lazy, would set spreadsheet take Monday average add future Mondays better predict numbers come thats lot work fuck health official promoted healthy lifestyle?

The key ending pandemic stopping spread, involves masks, hand washing avoiding people. tell sunshine want, gonna much keep licking doorknobs? Wow that’s absolutely insane.... cOoL  Germany would much better acting alone interests. deferred inept EU bureaucracy Germany big supporter EU concept. paid price.

They central role early vaccine development production -- sucks benefit it. 20/20 hindsight. I'm pretty disappointed news headlines ""breakthrough"" cases. Washington state yesterday reported 102 cases 1.2M fully vaccinated people since Feb 1. rate 0.01%. According rough math, approximately 1% general population state tested positive time frame. So, fully vaccinated people 99% less likely test positive. see headlines like ""Over 100 fully vaccinated people contract COVID-19 Washington state"", provides fuel ""vaccines work"" crowd. thanks!

So US gotten Pfizer doses not? Yeah, right. think we're aggressively agreeing. Sorry that.

It's annoying New Zealand response Australia's response seen best way western nations much better response. 

New South Wales open since July last year enforced measures contain new outbreaks moment happen. must sign using state government app restaurants, pubs, hair dressers, basically anywhere going spend 15 minutes. venue fails get fined eventually shut down.

It's differences perspective. Queensland decent response minor outbreak. continuing failure state learned respond minor outbreak.. CDC Dr. Fauci admitted vaccines reduce spread virus symptoms. vaccine really necessary vulnerable virus. happens .03% population. clearer, you’re right. read headline first three paragraphs thought reporting really irresponsible. can’t draw conclusion 100% effectiveness one study, even correct say 100% success administration within study. Americans overweight obese. It’s surprising includes Americans hospitalized COVID. 

And “good news” tag? AstraZeneca happened. delivered 30 mil doses 120 mil contracted Q1. Labeling everyone wants verify long term efficacy vaccine antivax intellectually dishonest. truth az vaccine caused blood disorder. facts. People every right concerned. 15 here. Looking forward getting shot, especially since parents probably won’t let do. Yeah honestly ""I hate hearing vaccine"" posts annoy fuck me. Like good job, hate hearing people getting vaccinated. need display info place, aren’t edgy cool. ^(Not yet Peer Reviewed.) fear mongering, scientists/epidemiologists already warning this. Reddit said TX Florida gonna biggest surges.🙄 Still get it. Friday/Saturday numbers gonna replace last week's Fri/Sat numbers, matter generally high begin with. That's beauty 7 day average, average still consistent even though swings High days Low days 2x. full report actually interesting, especially page 33 onwards several hypotheses presented.

Regarding adenoviral vector, thought part really hypothesis mechanistically plausible supported fact IV administration might needed observe abnormalities. However latter nuanced due known challenges implementation “syringe-not-in-vessel” test context massive vaccination. 

This could point incorrect administration technique cause. Pre-vaccine, wouldn’t felt comfortable sporting event. Now, fully vaccinated, I’m itching get back hockey baseball game. “They knew early people, lifestyles, better outcomes. long vaccines. Yet, chose promote healthy living habits. “ Bill Maher ranting years, basically ""Be healthy get sick"" is... generally fair got first dose 5 days ago, haven’t felt much sore arm little tired next day. Hopefully stays way whole way! dog pleased. Kinky

Jokes aside, sound healthy (mentally is) 15 thrombolytic cases J&amp;J trial alone. No, certainly surprising, also helpful ending pandemic lol likely. wanted alert likely can’t walk ask flu covid one go. They’ll likely need spaced. Wtf even talking about? amish believe germs modern medicine, believe keeping life simple possible. BioNTech incredible job. BioNTech also great job selecting partner help bring product market.

From taken Germany let EU run show retrospect mistake. Additionally EU nothing like DPA direct supplies never able get deeply involved manufacturing part equation like US did. Corona related, good news nonetheless: main investors behind BioNTech putting fortune leukaemia research:

german: get entirely new variant dangerous evades vaccines. 

More blatant fear mongering.

It's going laughable r/coronavirus reduced crazies talking next ""super variant"" everyone else partying living lives. Haha gotcha. scale risk aversion different people interesting aspect throughout this.

However, it’s surprising highly motivated get vaccine remain risk averse hurry get vaccine seem unconcerned going out. UK coronavirus sub?

## Abstract

The emergence novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants stresses continued need next-generation vaccines confer broad protection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). developed evaluated adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 Spike Ferritin Nanoparticle (SpFN) vaccine nonhuman primates (NHPs). High-dose (50 *µ*g) SpFN vaccine, given twice within 28 day interval, induced Th1-biased CD4 cell helper response peak neutralizing antibody geometric mean titer 52,773 wild-type virus, activity SARS-CoV-1 minimal decrement variants concern. Vaccinated animals mounted anamnestic response upon high-dose SARS-CoV-2 respiratory challenge translated rapid elimination replicating virus upper lower airways lung parenchyma. SpFN’s potent broad immunogenicity profile resulting efficacy NHPs supports utility candidate platform SARS-like betacoronaviruses.

**One-Sentence Summary** SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein ferritin nanoparticle vaccine, co-formulated liposomal adjuvant, elicits broad neutralizing antibody responses exceed observed major vaccines rapidly protects respiratory infection disease upper lower airways lung tissue nonhuman primates.  people shouldn’t read headlines, journalism needs better. vaccine 100% effective *in study* across population received - 2200 kids. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!

Fabick board member policy advisor Heartland Institute, free-market think tank, also president multi-state Caterpillar equipment engine dealer. Baby steps! Lets keep positive momentum. Yikes. Triple yikes, actually. going almost laughable get entirely new variant dangerous evades vaccines. learn mistakes. Vaccination silver bullet, anyone believes going back normal living fantasy land. Time side virus Weak article. details. Covid literally 10x deadlier flu, checks out. Sad see every news organization posting Facebook, common reaction laughing emoji. Science dead country. They’re running two dose trial 2nd shot ~2 months first (57 days) think 6 month thing made up/speculation. I'm sure I'm qualified answer question, guess yes.

First, know variants get contagious virulent unvaccinated populations, know worst case scenario this.

Second, adults never get 100% vaccinated partial/full immunity everyone much difficult without vaccinating children toolbox.

Third, serious complications children like MIS-C rare, trial absolutely evidence complications easily preventable. Plus, even typical infection frequently pleasant. analogy chicken pox vaccine give children apt here?

On side, seem reason approve it. significant safety concerns found. Lol 100% number comes fact 2,000+ participants trial, none participants got actual vaccine (not placebo) got COVID. small trial, though, headline disingenuous saying 100% effective. true effectiveness bit lower, good sign nonetheless. It’s bad news Americans risk factor severe COVID. 

And really hate idea people have, “I healthy lifestyle, don’t need worry COVID. need go gym usual.” That’s dangerous. 

We know vaccines provide great protection severe COVID, much better protection healthy weight. Let’s focus that. makes lot sense considering BioNTech German Company, Oxford research Astra Zeneca vaccine, Moderna J&amp;J American I'm actually really happy since I'm 15 right numbers come American Health Care Association National Center Assisted Living--which represents 14,000 nursing homes long term care facilities country care 5 million people.

I’m sure could find sources. Yeah ""Says"" believe them..  100% effective? Impossible. people said doctor claiming zinc 100% effective people calling unscientific claiming 100% Fauci didn’t say anything new, masks play dates always guidance.

But still need guidance? seems excessive wait children vaccinated unmasked playdates. arguing type measures counterproductive, people already tired pandemic adding unnecessary restrictions lower morale even point people stop caring following rules. pandemic fatigue real problem point government speed vaccination means possible instead putting additional stress people. dancing nurse &amp; hospital staff videos still baffle me. positive interpretation possible. Either busy attention-wh\*ring 15 minutes fame frontline heroes I’m conflicted that. People right thing chose risk vulnerable around understand concept decent member community get nothing bribe others? don’t know great precedent.  

Let’s say future need boosters variants break current vaccine think people would wait got government bribe. unfortunate. think created? Hint: treaty. Pfizer shot 1 yesterday. Injection site bit sore nothing else far. maybe peanuts invisible, everywhere, airborne - got many people sick covid, yeah they’d probably ban them. foods get banned less i’m sure. Establishing two shot vaccine every 5 years much better yearly booster.

Getting someone come doctor's bigger deal, one time thing much easier yearly compliance.

We idea difference would 1 2 shots, I'm spitballing numbers though.  fast, least 2 died 8 hospitalized Washington fully vaccinated it’s quite Come America we're giving vaccines undocumented workers states. definitely get one. Alwayshasbeen.jpg Sounds like great kid! Especially smart kids, avoiding telling they're smart helps life: also receiving vaccines. Top 5 vaccine usage, bottom 10 distributions per Good luck. believe slowly receive it, always refuse. 

You also factor virus. Perhaps effective vaccine, offer resistance thus slow transmission. 91 year old neighbor whose daughter husband refuse get vaccine even means can’t see him.

They lots links right. Could gave Pfizer patent. Oh well. Headline bit click baity

Seems like pretty good headline IMO. Clickbaity would something like ""Pfizer vaccine found incredibly effective teen trial, find effective here!""

Almost headline gives trial size all.  going say “this laughably low fine” (which is, too), absurd many ways indeed. Yes, posing question order make person rethink statement. thank clarifying lost mother, believe many people went straight ""what else have?"" would respond people worried possible long term side effects? Certain family members tend worry low probability events... former fat person never imagine going back. love free movement much athletics do. Pfizer seems studies data. Would like see Moderna studies well. Ah, self-loathing former fatty lives high horse since able fix problem. Sorry able feel valued worthy respect heavier, ""on"" anyone change body hated yours. Hope people treat better ever regain way treating fat people now. You’re taking said applying universally. agree CDC guidelines, also says unvaccinated people aren’t suppose gather, even vaccinated. what’s happening right bulk cases. 

Again, you’re vaccinated, others vaccinated, that’s fine. I’m talking about. people vaccinated act like everything back normal, vaccines here. Right, instead let virus run rampant sub-population suddenly mutates vaccine resistant strain. start whole process again. kids, also need worry pockets anti-vaxxers.

Ever wonder there's new flu shot every year? last one work more. new variant controlled vaccine. likely governors keep restrictions 2023 effort get 0 covid pipe dream?

No - thats completely unrealistic.

Once enough people get vaccinated, restrictions end changing policies people following anymore. Well that's fucking stupid Yeah, know. also negatively affects cognitive health circulatory issues limit blood (and therefore oxygen) supply brain. better flip magical switch somewhere. Eligibility mean get vaccination want one. wife 1A weeks, we've unable get appointment. Europeans, worry: Americans NEVER laugh care enough to. looks like bad story first, showing percentages efficacy practical situations, actually good story. also asthmatic 30s. also petrified notion unvaccinated lockdown lifts asked return in-person offices. would much like query addressed full. Lol, anyone going trust nursing home story coming Albany. I'll try say quietly, believe moderators actually perpetuate culture large extent. way hell venues requiring vaccine passport. 

It probably passport introduced. would government, pass law, law.

As losing much business, think discounting effect business already lost, making industry far compliant accepting would require young people regularly invasive test.

This agree with, always thinking passport would implemented, UK anything possible, especially ill thought out.

I dismissed concerns. answered mostly accepted fact country already tracked, privacy already virtually non existent, definitely strong court order.

I said decide want refuse passport accept effect would life, dismiss concern saying anything like silly, etc.

I answered view passport discriminates young, answered counter point that.

But ignore questions. Placebo shot delivers Pfizer said 18 cases Covid-19 reported among teenagers got placebo, compared none got real vaccine.

98.4% effective! Texas isn’t Wisconsin. **WIRELESS PROVIDERS HATE HIM!**

Find save hundreds dollars, per year, turning 5G hotspot simple 2-step lifehack!!!! I’m waiting till birthday getting shot. Gonna hunt extra dose. Maybe republican county near us. article fact prove point vaccinated good go. 99.9 percent effective? hell would continue try avoid virus efficacy rates? Step 1: Move Ohio

Step 2: Get vaccinated COVID-19

Step 3: Test positive COVID-19

Step 4: ???

Step 5: Immortality achieved governors advocating ""0 covid"" reopening?  Interesting... consider table shows outcome percentage cases three weight categories. categories ""underweight"", ""healthy weight"" ""overweight"", guess which?:

  Group		Hospitalised	ICU	IMV	Died
  ------------------------------------------------------
  Group A		47.3%		23.0%	5.8%	5.4%
  Group B		49.8%		24.3%	5.5%	6.9%
  Group pretty obvious lowest risk, want 'Group A'.

Would guess 'Group A' actually ""overweight"" category, 'Group C' ""underweight"" category?

If classified overweight, much less risk dying classified underweight, lower risk classified ""healthy weight"".

That's headlines mentioned obese, even though study included classified overweight, obese. quite common studies like these... often turns people classified overweight actually turn healthier people classified ""healthy weight"" significantly healthier underweight. Well major discussion cause death - cytokine storm (or immune system attacking body) - leads death older people younger people due COVID.

I'm sure differs flu. Never seen direct comparisons I'm guessing would piece puzzle compared flu ends leading death young children.

Here abstract paper Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), emerged Wuhan, recently become worldwide pandemic. Strangely, ample evidences shown severity COVID-19 infections varies widely children (asymptomatic), adults (mild infection), well elderly adults (deadly critical). proven COVID-19 infection elderly critical adults leads cytokine storm, characterized severe systemic elevation several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Then, cytokine storm induce edematous, ARDS, pneumonia, well multiple organ failure aged patients. far clear till cytokine storm induces COVID-19 elderly patients, young patients. However, seems aging associated mild elevated levels local systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines, characterized “inflamm-aging”. highly likely “inflamm-aging” correlated increased risk cytokine storm critical elderly patients COVID-19 calm. fortunate live state governor General Assembly alignment part Covid response.

Just sad see home state can't cooperation. Yeah brazil advanced developed country, trustable politcal system Rare relative. specify. There's rare like... cystic fibrosis. there's rare like leptospirosis. think fully vaccinated people 40, COVID headed towards latter within 10 years.

It probably remain relatively common unvaccinated though. Yeah shivers insane good now! Exactly. It’s annoying I’m seeing many people know vaccinated posting new vacation/gathering/etc photos. Like... come on. smart. Fantastic news. Yeah, seems suspect. participants go school without masks/etc?

If that's case... lord 1.6% infection rate? placebo 98.4% effective? hospital docs/nurses/staff here? bad situation facility? bad peak? No. Fauci didn’t say anything new, masks play dates always guidance. actually encouraged kids attend summer camp, etc. it’s frustrating states opening refusing revert even face Dr Varma (NYC advisor) calls “bulge” Evidence growing prevents infection, reduce spread. given emergency approval large trials safety data collected analyzed found safe effective large numbers people. point, worried vaccine millions people gotten virus killed 550,000+ people U.S. alone nuts. would point vaccinated population going average older general population. eight hospitalizations two deaths representative elderly vaccinated population. Communism pho  Patriot Act then? ""Two weeks slow spread""? Personal income taxes?

You seriously going argue government voluntarily gives powers ""we"" grant it. good news people worried hospitalization. overweight, good news unlikely hospitalized. *are* overweight, good news know virus before. people literally dying

Yes. Millions dead already, millions come doubt. That's official recorded figures, real number deaths probably something like double that. there's huge economic damage top costs lives too. see, think talking two different things. talking context successful primary immune response immune system able control least partially control infection talking severe covid infection immune system failure control primary response.

I see severe primary response significant immune-mediated pathology may create situation secondary response could reactivate lead severe disease again, overcome initial sterilizing immunity antibodies. end day important response generate high serum antibody titers control infection takes hold.

There lot discussion site even antibody response fails cells going savior like think safe statement make, especially vaccine setting cell involvement may minimal know 5 deaths company. Including one executives one owners. Novavax started production Fujifilm May might bit early even approved? say love comment. Thank sharing. Ya, he's mixed bag - lot interesting takes trots nonsense like obsessively rants cancel culture that's biggest problem facing country. Isn’t 147? I’m confused. issue here. got first shot Monday. wife stood behind held hand. looked back shoulder administered shot. Barely felt it. 

In past I’ve bloodwork done pull video YouTube watch technician thing. already Covid need shots. immune fear mongering? 100 extremely small number given we’ve vaccinating since December No. type trial, called challenge trial, considered dubious ethically often run, especially children. Instead, rely exposure community subject goes regular activities. gives good enough idea vaccine would work actual use scenario less risky subject experimenter. Maybe. Repetitive condescension tends that. mantra last year. people really think helpful well received talk others like that? Daily affirmation needed? get it. Quick review history goalposts:

2 weeks flatten curve Real quick lockdown promise Lockdowns sometimes according color-coded system Lockdowns last couple months Back normal vaccines come Lockdowns end 60% population vaccinated say 60%? meant 85% Back normal vaccine passports fully vaccinated Oh no, variants scary, go back step 1

So yeah. way, hold breath vaccine passports save you. There's vaccine hypochondria, goalposts shift ""100% vaccinated"", ""Zero covid"", ""New variants unknown, restrictions remain case"" Bill Maher Really? think that's something I've ever heard come show.

He's [pretty well known know nothing vaccination here.  got Moderna, arm sore enough prevent working. Still waiting second shot. Middle school teacher here. great news!  Britain's strategy target vulnerable, cases dropped like stop, hospitalisations likewise. actually did. I’ve lot strong emotions lately. Doesn’t make Constitution suggestion? non smoker non alcoholic would good news less worry about. Hi there!

We insane amount backlash trying target nutritional education solely black woman tried lead charge America. caused lawmakers react extreme ways labeling ketchup pizza vegetables get around nutritional guidelines, well shunning promoting active lifestyles mocking fit women ""manly"". US states open 16+

That's US vaccinating according age. Protocol likely similar, emphasis safety. read actual study protocol since don’t think published publicly, haven’t taken time closely review public info available children’s protocol design, would guess similar. Placebo vs treatment group distribution might bit different considering safety would primary endpoint. dosing schedule/amount likely already confirmed earlier phase research given phase 3 kids. That’s typically done phase 1. don’t see people problems this. 

Let’s pretend something else masks. governor ability enact restrictions laws own?

If answer no, correct ruling. 

If think should, what’s point legislature courts matter? gonna drop mean accuracy? Specificity sensitivity? spread vital achieving herd immunity. Absolutely. basically give memes Garbage Pail Kid names. NJ worse off:  growing slowly. US doesn’t close everything Sundays either. people doesn’t mean take seriously. didn’t catch it, comment joke. Sure. 👌 assume agree ban nuts extremely deadly small portion population? feel that. also 21 BMI people expressed genuine co cern weight. could lose 10 lbs still within healthy weight. goes show little Americans know health. I’m tired combination trying get vaccine, I’ve eligible weeks it’s open season getting shit every customer aren’t fully open kids ever needed masks? Eh obesity suppresses immune system. It’s factor Welcome 1 year ago? known pretty early game Yes. Blood clots extremely common health issue general population, especially developed countries. Unless they’ve actually done controlled study comparing blood clots people who’ve AZ vaccine vs people haven’t, there’s reason believe aren’t finding lot blood clots vaccinated people lot blood clots everywhere.

I know europeans like think don’t dietary sedentarity issues states, reality capitalist country cheap processed food available prevalence mentally exhausting long-hours jobs don’t necessarily provide energy-intensive physical workout inevitably suffer least problems. direct cause-and-effect chains can’t broken without changing underlying systems. know people died -- mostly older &lt; 40. There's lot secrecy, either outright denial family members wanting others theorize pre-existing conditions. 5-6 weeks behind US bit behind UK currently. April better month EU UK comes supply, gap closed bit. think end June everyone 2nd dose US end July EU. UK I’m sure, assume fully vaccinate adults summer.  Why? would surprise him? seems odd response someone correcting false numbers.  Ha. Bring downvotes. fat people hate said know I'm right, like said it. Easier click downvote button make major life change, even accept fault. see MI factor 10 difference worst best counties. enough vaccines european countries necessitate setting sundays. illustrate this, Norway vaccines set wednesdays thursdays. friday, vaccines left weekly supply recieve. Europe capacity set vaccines far greater currently produced. proposed explanations killing less children flu? obvious lethality skewed age seems drastic viruses, I'd interested know why. Lmao commenter questioned vaccine created Asian company doesn’t fit world view. that, ignored world effort take order conquer challenge extend problem put us future hell hole tolerate large amount annual level death throughout world. shouldn’t allowing people horrible low standards repeat dog shit racism. wonder Americans start punching certain type people street. Fat people subhuman quicker realize healthier be. US vaccination sites closed weekends too, especially retail pharmacies like Walmart. That's daily vaccines number fluctuates much weekly basis. They're highest cases per capita within last 7 days, they're actually still low (compared rest U.S.) terms cases per capita throughout entire pandemic (around 9th lowest).

While public policy politics certainly factor rising case numbers, fact Michigan presumably higher number people without immunity (because lower number people got infected) also factor. New York #2 cases per capita within last 7 days.

Just eyeballing hotspots within past 7 days, cases seem rising northern northeastern states, suggesting cabin fever + warmer spring weather driving people houses may significant factor rise cases. 99.95% sounds like familiar number. That's pretty close 100%, I'd say 100% extremely bold claim. can't think many things general 100% effective. shot head even 100% effective killing. still wore mask probably good get tested know, fault hell lot less productive empowerment.

You're right, find problem people cannot feel empowered make change reason so. country (compared rest world) accepts fat okay. ""Big beautiful"" similar sentiments. many people (including thread) making excuse excuse.

I gladly help anyone wants lose weight. know lot went myself. know hard be. people usually need sort help least encouragement. 

But nearly impossible unless person wants themselves, far many people content keep garbage food unhealthy habits rather make changes. can't empower people... point blame situation. check ""log"" scale. green line straight, curve exponential. ""new cases"" day. MI is, sadly, growing exponentially. Hopefully collectively react soon.

In fact none curve precisely exponential. are, rather, logistic curves ( ).  early ""up"" stage logistic one say ""exponential"" middle somewhat straight section exponential model well.  BTW, logistic function ALSO works way down. Hence places ""doing well"" still cases curve asymptotically approaches zero ( hopefully turn around ). Okay. getting Pfizer vaccine country. astrazeneca Indian Chinese vaccine. told vaccine make us immune. Ooh maybe we'll get moderna, 43 👋 would get would spread grand parents came home visited. That's usually happens. guess so. seems much useful taking someone's temperature then. 200 people getting plane, dozen COVID, 2-3 get false negative, guess see helps whether 2-3 people 10 people, considering contagious is, really help? 

I'm trying poo poo tech. see helps whole lot. wish niece's parents like yours. School opening Monday they're planning sending her. Hopefully convince there's good news. Isn’t development production? US invested 18 billion operation warp speed. could one entire factor really quality control issue? Something weird definitely going though. thoughts delaying second dose Pfizer 3-4 months. efficacy second dose?
Thank do! feel like people said “2 weeks flatten curve” advocating 0 covid using Saint Anthony’s statement kids needing masks 2022 proof. likely governors keep restrictions 2023 effort get 0 covid pipe dream? interference vaccines given together. all, often fine, immune response less shots spaced out. Well, forced hate yourself, especially something cannot changed quick like body. That's quick route self destructive mental health issues likely make issues worse. However, healthy lifestyles ok promote, well, without backlash. tricky line walk. likely

Just waiting “it’s act, antivaxer wanting create scene” line

Or

“You made whole story up” 

Last 2 squares bingo card 100+ million doses end March best case estimate AZ would make 'best effort' deliver. AZ made best effort ran problems UK production rollout except extra heaping spoonful EU bureaucratic nonsense. doses part contract, precise timing delivery not. I'll give ""good news"" label tactful, ""good news"" sense people mostly hospitalized based life choices (eating habits, smoking, drinking) parameters control (race, gender). 

I think great admit problem, that's generally hardest part healing process. thought consulting? need stop shaming people seeing medical advice mental physical health issues. reddit doctors go said events crocked US Germany discredit AZ?

It’s good see information come out. think response EU Canada makes sense given circumstances. extremely important countries acted findings quickly prevent loss confidence governing bodies whole. Damaging reputation singular vaccine vastly better damaging credibility vaccines. Shhh can't say reddit, safe bubble here. dare Ah, much better it. Unsurprisingly. {sad trombone} mean vaccine higher efficacy rate necessarily provide protection? explain falling case numbers across country? hate pedant, comes stuff, think kind important:

Remember 99.9% effective symptomatic disease 99.9% effective transmitting virus.

*HOWEVER*, news front [almost really think real life studies Israel U.S. show Dose 2 + 14 days reasonable endpoint epidemic 99% population (excluding wish continue precautions behalf kids). Transmission reduced significantly, although studies magnitude effect still ongoing. Although could common causation. Overweight people likely eat restaurants? masks don’t fit face well skinny people? Florida's COVID Deaths undercounted compared expected deaths rate US whole. 

So yes no. ""Temporarily"" lol. like TSA, right? helps also extremely fearful needles. AZ jab month ago also decided get flu vaccine last year fir first time adult.

Both far easiest needles ever had. Staff centres awesome, looked way, took second barley felt - would struggled able tell jab.

My best advice sit down, answer questions tell nervous ask look away - done realise :) looking forward Nobody, glad hear awesome. Still vaxxed yet, holding little longer theaters enjoying Godzilla vs Kong evening home. good news makes want cry. vaccines scientists behind amazing ❤️ someone suicidal past year due pandemic, knowing vaccines makes see light remember someone saying could due contraceptive pill maybe women take apparently known possibly cause blood clots side effect. Good news opened hair dressers GTA!! /s
We fucked lol  agree vaxxed people (fully vaxxed mind waited appropriate amount time following injection allow immune response) likely need masks HOWEVER folks walking around public masks sends wrong message around them. gives unvaccinated folks idea well he’s wearing mask I? Keep damn thing public reach full vaccination want it. PA still able schedule. see asshole public wearing mask I’m gonna say something. don’t give shit you’ve vaxxed, don’t know state still mask mandate. Government abuse power recognized courts. Serious talk time: tie 999 headache. exactly sort thing NHS 24 for. Insults sources. Agreed, like poor life choices mutually exclusive cultural influences. looking actual solutions, saying ""Well, fat people wake try harder"" might work handful individuals helpful country reached nearly 3/4s rates. shovel sugar grocery staples pour oil cup restaurant offerings. celebrate birthdays cake, reward good grades pizza, one celebrated holidays centralized around gigantic meal 10x portion reasonable human really needs. Making better life choices means needing ""on guard"" *all time* avoid nonsense cultural norms become commonplace first place. I've never truly overweight BMI peeked much effort return ""normal healthy human levels"" seems like decks stacked watching out. happier society watching thousand things playing depressing game guess-the-calories every shop restaurant step into. Logistics production incredibly important parts process, especially case goal create enough every citizen. also easy mass produce things, simple copying make small amount. 


For example: someone asked design paper plane make 10 copies them, could probably get done fairly easily lying around. someone asked thousand paper planes tomorrow, I'd ask friends help head store buy paper. someone asked 10.000.000 paper planes end month, even quite sure start. 


The point investing R&amp;D enough. need place massive orders early and/or invest money production. wanted add although blood vessels upper arm fairly deep, vaccinator inject low arm, imo would impossible hit vein, especially less muscular arm. 
Here's diagram anyone's interested challenge trial.   CDC said continue avoiding crowded areas. telling people things may fall category... think little different, given long history use mmr vaccines. think people opposed covid vaccines traditional ""anti-vaxxer"". personally know plenty folks vaccines staunchly opposed covid vaccine. Guess wait see sound like good news hoping would peer reviewed trials company saying good product is.  Wow really sucks. hope situation improves soon. see lot people internet acting like competition bragging rights, us together. Hopefully months everyone  lot people admit even overweight, either. Denial huge there. depressing watch someone morbidly obese post body positivity memes social media know real life ton health issues explained exacerbated weight. Overweight, particularly lower end category, tricky overall health based body type limitations BMI calculated. may may unhealthy place be. doctor one make call. upper end overweight spectrum obese, however, never healthy puts ton strain body. might surprise obesity severely impacts bodies ability fight vaccine coming out? Good, maybe help covid go away burning antivax communities. think he's alluding fact AZ delivered fraction originally promised agreement. guess risk factor us mitigate lifestyle changes rather waiting medicine developed. Hope gets better ❤️ fat person, don’t believe “fat beautiful”. admit legitimate addiction unhealthy food/binge eating battle meal meal basis it’s something I’d say 90% fat people would admit having. Would labeling “good news” title “alcoholics” “smoker” instead? worked person Monday (a week testing positive), got closer 6 feet throughout day, I'm always masked, person usually masked, eats, drinks, snacks day mask lowered/taken decent amount time. would still less Inbreeding killed Given global vaccine inequity, really make sense US prioritize vaccinating 12-15 year olds prior sending doses low middle income countries? fiancé, relationship 7 years, living together 7 years, broke last month, 1 week got first vaccine shot, handle self-quarantining agreed 1 year prior...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going shit now, said sacrifices, hit specific way. Smart virus hardly effect people younger 30, Look stats CDC, maybe less 2k deaths entire US. older people vaxxed need it? Imagine start seeing side effects year road ruin whole generation something minimal damage younger people? don’t care Poland. polish parents don’t care. acknowledge severity “when it’s time, it’s time “ mentality. words persuade otherwise. second question. Many asthmatics risk due decision, especially society starts open up. Yep, sound 12. Someone telling J&amp;J vaccine booster needed 6 mos shot avoid two shot thing all. cannot find anything online adamantly insists true. guy longstanding rep spreading sketchy info FWIW. Anyone know anything this? really agree sentiment going eat indoors first time year Friday! Conversely however many NON-vaccinated going things, bad look. sort bizarro world early know whether need booster vaccines COVID-19 whether need additional vaccination new variants. Dr Ladhani Easy peasy say serious case covid need quarantine 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 I’ll take it! don’t follow news closely anymore, mom said something Biden would something speed vaccine distribution included National guard (maybe? remember correctly). already happened someone ELI5 lol? Plus young people eating butts like crazy days likely already immune sorts things. Nothing 100% certain given biological makeup. like 20 kernels won’t pop popcorn bag, going 0.1-1% kids vaccine won’t effective. Saying 100% undermines confidence telling truth 99.3 99.87% would actually bring confidence you’re including errors. Good.

It's always irresponsible report cases without context whatsoever. want whatever want right now! thousand people die America every day! /s I’m also concerned Anti-Vax people, Vaccine Lazy, many friends say want vaccine anti vax, literally getting ass making appointment, going place two doses apparently lot effort lot people.

There also segment population, anti vax, think don’t need already covid, especially case wasn’t bad. enough messaging done reach people. never reach herd immunity, fyi. Feels great right? 16 days post first dose now, cannot fathom people get shot. relief. sorry hear well. hope recovering. Please get second dose vaccine well - least 4 weeks illness. Dr Ladhani Name checks could wrong, suspect reason recommendation watch reactions, vaccines definitely contraindicated. want make sure issue, know what's causing issue. Moral story - experts know they're talking about. Listen warnings. we’re point pretty much everyone least knows someone personally gotten vaccine. hesitant see nothing bad happens they’ll become less hesitant. think that’s we’re seeing now. Add ADD ODD becomes even fun!  BioNTech developed sure, Pfizer manufactures, distributes, markets US. Natural infection antibodies last forever. know already due cases re-infection seen around world. However, there's data, yet, long antibodies vaccines last. say annual shot we'll need (like flu shot), UK say we'll need booster fall protect us winter.  know, neither Wall Street Journal. I'm sorry point out. know articles like give us hope soon. know we've reached herd immunity we've actually reached herd immunity. know get without vaccinating children also, hoping best ongoing trials done them.  There's legal ramifications all, FrEe MaRkEt.

If business refuse couple they're gay, slam dunk. least get disease 99.98% survival rate Serious question - last year honestly listen CDC all? CDC told vaccinated people ""allowed"" resume normal life obvious vaccine data completely safe so. would imagine officially say travel domestically hit ""herd immunity"" see us vaccinated need wait that. Looking you, Maryland. We’re hitting phase 3 April 27. Im pretty sure lick handrails subways contacted 12 weeks up. contacted then, please contact GP. long get second dose around 12 weeks, fine.  risk variants cropping UK squandering vaccine process. Lockdown 4 inevitable variants. thought made days difficult late. people they’re comfortable. think many likely cases drop pretty low stay there. personal choice. leave house want to. Right. believe trials symptoms actually tested. I’ve signed kids trial that’ll take them. Waiting hear back. Ah yes UK production capacity maximum 2 million per week would solve EUs problems... meant sort source scientific backing.

What's sources this.  controversial section voted? Hrmmmm? elderly/vulnerable person that's vaccinated still try take plenty precautions avoid infection coming months undergoing chemo? measures case though. legal basis. thing happened Netherlands curfew. I'd say good thing judges still take legality account, extremely important prevent countries slipping authoritarian governance. 30 days come solid legal basis. seems unlikely measures actually lifted. Actually good podcast. Thanks that. 

With said. guess I'm sure 

""They workers, opposition""

and dismissing mass-murder ""part struggle"" makes things better.  seem idiotic Ebola scary, suspected survival rate around 50%

Covid survival rate 99.97% people 80 already dying something (that's co-morbidity is). Fuck fear mongering already. Thanks reply. It’s nice hear people great knowledge :) even talking about. example totally BS context. vaccine developed 100% BionTech. 100%. ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. Pfizer vaccine, even Pfizer/Biontech vaccine, BIONTECH VACCINE. world works, stupid people media works. know Pfizer copy pasting other. 66% good outdoor events seems reasonable me. Thank important question. current UK programme aims protect risk severe COVID-19. professions, teachers increased risk age underlying conditions prioritised vaccination. UK aims vaccinate adults summer. Every 12yr old teen crazy dealt one too, grow 18 hang haha Paywalled. metric % population vaccinated?

In case, [they're middle #24. two kids, wife vaccinated, I'll get 2nd shot weeks. kind CDC guidelines recommendations expect see next 9+ months ages vaccinated? Usually needs 2-3 weeks 2nd dose Cinopharm vaccine get immunization response. disgusting? That's world works. Many automobiles designed developed many companies big OEM names. call car end OEM manufacturer assembles, markets, sells end product like Ford, Chrysler, GM, etc. many appliances, electronics, even software.

In US least, vaccine manufactured distributed Pfizer. Immune Thrombocytopenia I've seen AZ vaccine reduce platelet count. FBC done prior vaccination? (I'll get vaccine regardless, hard sell needed here)

Thank much hard work. got 1st moderna yesterday. sore arm. Friend got 2nd. slightly fatigued day swollen lymph node. Nothing bad  California still pretty good restrictions place paper. enforcement honor system, guess people going ignore got covid last wave long smart don’t abandon restrictions soon California able avoid big wave. read Macron going address France later today. I'm French know usual thing, indicator full lockdown imminent?  COVID-19 incredibly similar SARS-COVID-1 (2003). several long term studies virus. Several studies long term effects show long term effects minuscule people recover long term problems. Many long term effects found older/unhealthy/preexisting conditions populations. young healthy, long term effects statistically significant.

I much concerned vaccines. Canada countries paused AstraZeneca vaccine people 55 due serious blood clot concerns. much don’t yet know vaccines. cost-benefit analysis. Young kids need vaccine. guess Paul Offit gonna get wanted last September we’re gonna till 2025. answered it. Oh no. vaccine produces non-sterilising immunity recipe disaster: animals select immune evading mutants escape back human population. two teens trial. barely reaction vaccine all. (Both confirmed vaccinated antibody testing.) relief everyone house vaccinated now. want feeling everyone!  We’re doomed 12 days first Pfizer dose. think may consider woods. Thank fucking God Hopefully mean masks come schools. God can't imagine forced wear one eight hours day age, especially many kids wear glasses. Personally think absurd people still recommending mask usage children every eligible adult offered vaccine, that's different discussion. I'm really worried mental health kids end soon. Yes seem mask compliance etc better - yes, much to-and-fro first lockdown (apart councils guess).

I've seen today's numbers - worse last Wednesday - hope hold together vaccines fully rolled out. wonderful options things again. netflix! Blood clots incoming large numbers thrown around best case estimate relied absolutely everything going right, equipment delivered/installed quickly possible, absolutely hiccups spinning new production lines, EU's bureaucracy moving fast humanly possible. None happened. *contract* says best effort deliver many doses possible, specify required amount.

The biggest problem ridiculously late contract signed money allocated/spent. AZ faced production issues spun UK's lines, started process **3 months** EU even put ink paper. talking specifically vaccines.

Thalidomide vaccine. drug used treat morning sickness pregnant women. could also keep borders closed air land traffic 2 years. including commerical traffic. could ensure testing pre boarding airports. ""The virus hoax! live fear, rarely see mask!""

*moderates think responsible improving times* present review identified specific risk factors, age, gender previous medical history clotting disorders, rare events.

Who going tell European states making rules going import Sputnik-V soon? disaster. Yep, especially articles showing reinfections driving Brazil’s current crisis. back up, one vaccinator volunteers St. John Ambulance. Plenty people come anxiety needles etc, though process efficient mind taking extra time accommodate anyone's worries! last thing want cause someone panic attack anything like that, and, nature volunteers general, want help people best can.

It may also help know I've fairly positive feedback lack pain, others I've volunteered with, people even notice goes in! worth maybe letting someone know like sight needles entering pod, example, hide away :) Oof appreciate context! seems like would big help getting parents children vaccinated. I’m guessing get approved individually well, like, paper work x 6. 

I seen Canada countries EU suspended certain vaccines fear blood clots. 

Does paper work include data audits criteria approval? actual loads paper work? Would concerns something would addressed approval process? 

I imagine, i’d hope, concerns like would caught somewhere along line approval process. 

I want people vaccinated get back normal, it’s incredible many people already vaccinated, seems like pretty hearty block people don’t trust them, seems best interest chip away providing much credibility transparency possible. appreciate explaining things! Explain this.

Is reason Australia better countries fact accessible land? 

How many US cases attributable Canadians Mexicans crossing land border U.S.? border crossings closed significant time last year anyway? constantly monitoring new variants effect vaccines protection them. Studies underway look certain mutations could change vaccine effectiveness. However, unlikely single mutation would stop vaccine working completely. know vaccines currently used UK providing excellent protection highest risk hospitalisation death, effective dominant variants UK.

We unlikely eradicate virus, protect COVID-19 vaccination social distancing. 

It still early know whether need top ups vaccines tweaked make sure protect new variants. Dr Ladhani That's odd position hold first weeks don’t see big effect, takes time That’s New York State, population 19 million. Yes, rates still much lower don’t disagree rest post. 

Realistically, New York never well Cuomo suggested opened political pressure. example, Florida 3000 current hospitalizations slightly larger population (22 million). NY achieved low testing percentage testing extremely large amount people day, tested jobs. 

I don’t disagree it’s time open UK bit. Soon enough see cases fall cliff like Israel. guys amazing vaccinations, effective mitigation strategy disposal. 

Meanwhile Florida...

Everything open almost year now. big question it’ll safe participate society. covid got first shot Pfizer week. go restaurant week two, wait I’m fully vaccinated? least feel comfortable work now. Assuming pick choose vaccine have. think people UK choice. think doing? grandparents like blood clots? *so sort people young / healthy / 'right' job qualify receive vaccine yet. 

There. Fixed you. way hell would ever take AstraZeneca vaccine.  It’s mind blowing. 100% incredible. I’d curious many vaccines trial ever 100% efficacy age cohort. I’m sure it’s happened. 100%???? That’s insane. Absolutely insane. thoughts offering Republic Ireland vaccines??? many even testing. India Indonesia hot climates took yet. helpful examples vaccine rollout failure trying avoid missteps? countries care market people.

And hubris assured virus mutate something cannot control. It'll hurt people too, like people can't take vaccine vaccine protect (because 100% effective). 

We get transmission low levels vaccinations, something like mask use longer help speed time. No.....it's never mass testing. Many African countries even report cases all. Yeah I’m really confused. rarely see kids together masks.  isn’t autism recognised priority groups? It’s recognised either learning disorder mental illness - yet people schizophrenia bipolar get vaccinated currently? answers seem scripted like every UK official government answers. Also what's answering important questions here. Young teens covid poses practical thread anyways zero covid strategy possible everywhere. vaccines greatest “save world” moment many us ever see. never statements completely untrue. summer, every adult wants one issue getting one - fully expect pharmacies allow walk-in vaccinations July US. doses available, absolutely offering younger people. No, easier start smoking shortly booking appt. How's Larry cat days? stop. Many African countries even testing saying even exists. Several African leaders already it. easy handle pandemic well test virus. South Africa one worst git country Africa that's south Africa one mass testing. blamed blissfully unaware.

They care long continues impact way. Sorry, parent kid can't go school working home someone's entire industry falling apart idea pay bills.

Work home people also unaware high public sector jobs pay. ""bartenders"" entire industries make six figures shuddered. reddit... Sanity. Thank you. Less trial (it raise concern safety issues) efficacy data announced press release. 

“The DSMB concerned AstraZeneca chose use data already outdated potentially misleading press release. point clear board [vaccine efficacy number] . . . chose release favorable study opposed recent complete. Decisions like erode public trust scientific process.”

DSMB = data safety monitoring board auditing trial threads increasingly stupid. People love getting upset scenarios haven’t happened won’t happen. Things opening every week. medical conditions &amp; treatment remain private. need advertise vaccination status worried commentary. Agree whole-heartedly. virus operates simple rules give rat's ass people want think tired staying home. cares people do. Hope they're ok sucks, telling people go movies they’ve vaccinated isn’t going bring back. Spaghetti beer coolest ones I’ve seen. many doses administered?! I'm vaccines, definitely forcing everyone.

Personally mutated gene triggered start cancer would rather take chances covid vaccine. sister gene me, cancer doctor strongly advising us get vaccinated.   Yes. they’ve packed month two. drove movie theater couple weeks ago completely full parking lot. least, still wearing masks out. AZ 20 years old. Nothing bad far I'm hoping information comes June get second dose decided worth getting second shot not. Weird thing thinking lol Hello, effect think vaccination population? believe virus ever get eradicated learn live decades way shape form due mutative capacity? Oh. Firstly thank amazing work done far! really life savers. 

As understand it, vaccines we're using offer good protection variants discovered far, except possibly South Africa variant. result, AstraZeneca developing autumn booster. 

Do data yet suggest well current vaccines work variant? companies developing boosters? 

We warned may need additional measures next winter prevent wave. that? Mainly knowing long vaccine protection lasts, uptake be, concerns variants etc?  Brazil's problem leadership downplayed pandemic since beginning. Even vaccines sent Brazil priority, authorities who'd essentially responsible distribution.   pharmacies number told contact GP, hold pointed out, according source I've cited, 10th dropping time. Statistics tell confusing picture suppose.

 Hi! American hoping visit UK (Bristol specifically) August. fully vaccinated next week. quarantine protocol vaccinated visitors look like? get shot today :) vaccines safe? thrown together rush properly tested. takes roughly 10 years new product tested public, assume that's government took away people's right sue pharmaceutical companies second this. Short term studies shown safe, wise rolling vaccines emergency use authorisations groups exceedingly low risk Covid-19 clearly full understand benefits risks? think executed, electric chair, nice injection, go sleep baby...... probably want get ready copy paste answer. lot. Thanks link. wanted see absolute number unused vaccines combination weeks deliveries.

4.45 million unused vaccines seems high number, know nearly half delivered last days. don’t understand. Teens getting vaccinated big priority! hope denied emergency use. Kids age group, statistically, practically never required hospitalization, symptoms mild even absent, practically never die virus.

I’d concerned vaccine, side effects, long term impact. prioritize getting thing properly tested approved start administering young. Hi, turn vaccination likely come May. However, comfortable getting AstraZeneca vaccine, thats vaccine local areas areas administering. AstraZeneca controversial bad news surrounding everyday. Recently pause administering AZ vaccines 55's Canada, due blood cloth concerns. even MHRA says safe, simply faith lost trust product. get Pfizer Moderna vaccines instead? makes sense enough vaccine. Germany need get letter doctor first whole immunization campaign really slow. way would idiotic step son astma 17, got letter public health England dad back said 16 received invitation covid vaccine get touch gp receptionist told us ignore information, right public health receptionist? Curious much resistance using EUA kids be. Yes lot young fit 20 somethings care others safety. Thanks hard work first all! questions below:
Are asthmatics considered risk group? 
When expect get vaccinated, website/hotline kind information? (25y.o asthmatic, Romford - Essex area.) Fantastic! Ahh yes Threenager years one talks about. fair callout. downvote. think optimists? realists? really moving goal posts, think they're adding another level concrete goal posts set. 

Yes, there's another wave coming... like coach calling timeout star kicker make call. maybe false start 5-yard penalty makes kick little harder.

I think goal posts moving. think kick may get little tougher, vaccine intact (here US), think goal posts move back. second this. Short term studies shown safe, wise rolling vaccines emergency use authorisations groups exceedingly low risk Covid-19 clearly full understand benefits risks? BIONTECH said, vaccine, Pfizers.  IIRC, 5% get infected, infection mild very, little viral shed. 

So basically, \~90% chance getting virus get virus another \~90% chance spread it. makes likelihood vaccinated individual spreading virus super, super low.

This read data least. **Please, wrong numbers let know :)** vaccines stop transmission, eliminate symptoms (thereby slowing transmission well would assume)?  read several articles like weeks ago. understand hand-wringing. hesitation all. time life fat given advantage. going pass opportunity.

Yeah, little embarrassing admit someone would like date got shot I'm fat, secret. tell looking (and romantic interest anyway). Thank hard work.

My question J &amp; J vaccine may likely offered public one dose? British children back school nearly month now. demonstrable rise cases. indication vaccine approved children.

The virus dangerous children young. realistic threat wellbeing long term development isolation peers. Children need play children age. Online interaction substitute. total case numbers still national average, deaths barely above.

It's entirely possible COVID spreading result extreme restrictions comparison neighboring states. There's lot people going first time months right now, they're easy target virus. need get new vaccination time virus mutation show up? Indeed, watching close look forward turn. Everyone else family vaccinated, least offer protection. school big outbreak, balance ""is worth risk send school not"" challenge right now. distance learning 5 7 months far really taking toll emotional social health. sent back person Feb 3 weeks later 30 kids school covid, lol. pointed out, according source I've cited, bad originally said. lie.

It's great either, woeful. made comment yesterday topic. Throughout pandemic, pro-restrictions taken lot steps keep son getting it, far people around live state never mask mandate never fully shut down. However, allow pandemic affect son's development. take reasonable precautions, deny right kid criminal, opinion. think time check everyone's eligibility. want vaccinate many people possible quickly can. Well, considering less half Americans received dose vaccine, makes sense.

If ask June I'm willing bet answer different. know personally I'll comfortable going in-person sports two weeks last vaccine dose before. Certificate Recovery people who've recovered COVID way Vaccine Passport Jab?

Israel this.

Thank you.  trying child. Pfizer vaccine safe months initial pregnancy? studies moving forward smaller populations, especially age 5 group. It’s finding right dosage effective. 

They know vaccine works overall. daily walk sun fresh air would made world difference. Instead said lock inside. 

No, would made world difference. yes, avoiding people may infected catch virus first place. There's actually really cool items international McDonald's available States. long, think take get vaccines children 14 ?? lot talk Astrazeneca vaccine less effective mRNA vaccines, one reasons virus used shell deliver SARS-CoV-2 genetic material initial booster doses, presents obvious risk immune system developing antibodies simian virus that's adapted deliver SARS-CoV-2 material rather SARS-CoV-2 material itself, surely modified use different ""container"" initial booster shots? That’s true all. Exaggerating facts makes worse.  get idea from? 30 nyc too, got appointment April 2nd refreshing site literal hours Yeah don’t trust many european numbers either number infections happening Michigan nowhere near societal levels infections likely result significant mutation. 

This nonsense. Hi, I’m form Chile.

Vaccination initially success (high number doses fast) government decided relax lockdown measures. Keep mind summer, even allowed people travel cities vacation previously discouraged/banned. 

Then summer holidays ended classes began, government encouraging schools open (kinder high school. Universities autonomous most/all decided start semester online). government speech whole time remarking success vaccination campaign need open schools children’s mental health.

Another layer problem Chile centralized country, 50 percent country’s population residing Santiago, Capital. holidays, Santiago residents spread virus people regiones. cases surging regions, capital numbers decreasing, government always put emphasis results capital, even regions experiencing numbers cases never seen before. tell, live capital 😂 strong opinions this. give example centralization: region one Urgent care bed (?) available, counts pediatric beds converted adults’ ones one weeks ago, today minister health gave speech converting pediatric beds need so, reality hospitals regions living.

So TL;DR government started good vaccination campaign (which still good), fell victim triumphalism centralization spread virus rest country capital context relaxed lockdown measures summer holidays plus start school year. China kicked actually cooperate? Black ball them. Cut completely. states never enacted mask mandates others dropped winter surge. also report CDC claims restrictions indoor dining mask mandates combined reduced spread 1.8%. counter bunch ""studies"" amount taking pictures simulated spit high speed cameras lab claim cloth surgical masks magic. like every virus. force people get flu vaccines. Unless alternative vaccine offer people, stopping offering AZ benign choice means people die would they'd continued using it. 

Very, (very) back envelope numbers: Population 83M, daily deaths 160. AZ given 2.7M people, assume reduces deaths ratio vaccines population (about 3%) - accumulative 4 less deaths per day due AZ. let's generous say every million AZ doses save one life per day. blood disorder (not even death) showing half rate (I \*think\* AZ authorized 2 months ago). realize bit moral problem. guess point that, unless alternative, using vaccine could worse option. Yeah, hear seems like 2 isn’t ok (and maybe even unsafe), age 3-5 hear parents say it’s fine kids others say it’s not, 5 seem get (except kids special needs, obviously need accommodate kids). friend recently whose daughter excited turned 5 started wearing mask pre-K - felt like big kid. little sad normal, I’m also glad handled good cheer! availability think it’s smart plan [4-16 days first Leave. Dr. Fauci really seem taking account cases reach remarkable low numbers, would point stopping kids playing maskless kids? scenarios also need talking about, situations COVID community problem. research referring to? may right refuting sources data? kid almost 3 daycare classroom kids aren’t forced wear masks. don’t. It’s fucking impossible adhere advice unless don’t send kids school ever Also, states high vaccination numbers infuriating deal scheduling. better need need it

&amp; knows might make something even better others have

The article presented National Review says author study says misrepresented. post, it’s entirety section attributed author study article:

Like hell. 892 word article 37 words author study says. Covid 19 killed people FL official counts, don’t know exactly how/why.

This bullshit article - directed you, Bork, seriously there’s 4 percent article attributed author study, agree it’s entire premise.

I accept maybe catch infected person themself. accept possibly one two people direct contact infected person infected partner. accept statisitcally probable there's chance catch two people catch it, people contact two people also exhibited globally accepted symptoms covid infection, surely chances infected get exponentially smaller vector I've exposed to.

One person passing me, fine, logically there's chance three, four, five people get don't. chance got anstronomical.

Yeah, randomly popping pharmacies see could get leftover dose since 'group' yet. never got lucky, friends did. matter now, since appointment first shot tomorrow. needed apply EUA two months safety data hit whatever efficacy endpoint was. interim data better efficacy number, obviously looked better, literally fake news

This sub gone downhill. Calling interim data ""literally fake news""? people write Alex Jones forums, factually correct.  following quote highlights ""The NIAID statement accuse company trying deceive anyone, Fauci stresses""

Both numbers line other. Neither data release point included ""literal fake"" data. *The efficacy AZ older age people actually improved 80-85% updated figure*. statistically wild would prefer company allowed publish old data know longer true?

Yes. company bound based trial protocol based set number events. interim data nature outdated designed superseded accurate data events come in. Interim data concrete measure efficacy used gauge success, used regulators independently approve vaccine issued press release data also final data available.

They yet final data available. primary efficacy endpoint required events yet accrued interim announcement analysed. company independent statistians conduct analysis cases accrued. issue DSMB seen subset data led *them* beleive efficacy primary would significantly lower.

 turns DSMB/Fauci statements much lower efficacy 69% etc incorrect, whereas AZ statements primary announcement line interim correct. turned best much ado nothing worse fear mongering. data never going hidden. 

Releasing interim data first exactly multiple manafacturers did, events accrued number updated, happen AZ

Here better explanation occured reputable White House communication team learned DSMB note contacted Fauci. “We say: Wait minute, company already got checkered stuff going Europe, comes press release, good faith, federal government copies press release,"" says. “And DSMB writes note, absolutely going get leaked, harsh criticism. So, keep quiet let things play out, people say: covering something right. there's one thing government want ever do, cover something that's quite kosher. So, meeting late night said: We’ve got clear air.”

Basically white house encouraged NIAD turn non-public background critique public fears would get leaked would roped AZ drama occuring Europe would harm image US regulatory process transparency Jha public health experts say small downgrade reported efficacy little meaning. data come wide confidence intervals; new analysis indicates true efficacy likely lies somewhere 68% 82%.

The question however ready much produce. Likely late actually effect. two weeks  grandma fully vaccinated already. isn’t yours? wonder kids even need two shots. There's already evidence people already COVID may need shots. different types vaccines work? understanding three different types currently used UK. completely random type get pick hand? Thank you. risk (if any) fully vaccinated individual take others act virus exist? example, go crowded parties frequently play contact sports without masks. they’re 23 wouldn’t started secondary school 2008 2009 could happy hypoxia somehow never ended hospital. biggest problem vaccine rollout we're really anything put dent R Naughts selection criteria. selection criteria pretty much goes way choose people least likely spreading Covid anybody could think of. 

This thing spreading control half country unmasked, whatever want, and/or would asymptomatic long incubation period get it. 

If want stop spread tracks limited supply, continue let elderly pre-existing people quarantine, make sure get shot arms younger people still go work face customers would likely continue spread asymptomatically get it. 

Pretty much group I've agreed healthcare workers. think great thank families prioritize them, strategically need front lines fight thing. Giving elderly waste supply really nothing lower R Naughts. think sneak night unmasked superspreader parties something? great - getting approval 12-15 age group important achieving herd immunity magic number anywhere north 70% total population.

Right need ~90% 16+ adults get takes 70% total population achieve herd immunity; 12-15 approved, number 12+ age group dips 85%. trying think insult get response removed also hard core lol Surviving savings loans without able take profits out. Yes adults vaccinated. rate children hospitalized incredibly low. Use FAST test check common symptoms stroke someone else.

**F**ace: Smile see one side face droops.

**A**rms: Raise arms. one arm drop down?

**S**peech: Say short phrase check slurred strange speech.

**T**ime: answer yes, call 911 right away write time symptoms started. hell Pfizer news gets aroused! Correct. Idk, needle phobia pain. Everyone knows barely painful all.

I feel incredibly violated someone stabs object flesh! disgusting. Still gonna though. I'll tell something - divided country is, decides get act together fight common enemy results breathtaking. vaccination site Monday believe fast moving people there. Thirty-plus stations giving shots. Fifteen registration lines. Guy walking observation area signing everyone second dose... down. watching rates production vaccination rise day day, week week.... Imagine could could come together little bit routinely. Following suspensions AstraZeneca vaccine 60s Germany 55s Canada, UK considering prioritising vaccines, like Novavax, younger population?

Regarding comment incidence CVST immune thrombocytopenia following vaccination AZ UK? consider VIPIT real phenomenon, so, could possibly explain it? could explain difference rate seen UK higher incidence seen Germany Norway? Yes absolutely is. Corporate America wants Biden administration working New York already rolled out. great news around Pfizer/BioNTech, focusing time, energy money turning Belgium gigafactory. cold, make less effective? Hospitalizations rising. amount preventable deaths automobiles fucked too. least know treat people injured car wrecks.

I'm arguing new lockdowns anything like that. saying whatever economic hit took shutting things giving stimulus money bad long term economic hit millions working age people unable work would occurred even worse job handling this. investigations done UK relation rare brain blood clots shortly vaccination AZ vaccine?

Context: know someone suffered one. Wow that's crazy fast. Honestly, worth engaging posters like. 

No matter say, proof provide, agenda clear rammed - matter what; defend Trump costs. 

Be tossing reality, facts, logic, etc. Oh god really hope not. worst nightmare goal beginning avoid hospitalizations deaths. implies done it, sorry miss understood.  I’m concerned parent infant. won’t able wear mask another year half earliest! I’m supposed convince work can’t send daycare another 18 months? i’m high school. really depends person Online school fucking terrible people called us ‘crazy conspiracy theorists’ ‘science deniers’. again, correct. wait see much we’re correct like way presented, especially car bit. husband's driving Instructor due start back 12th April UK restrictions eased. students wore masks windows allowed work, reassuring show much window helps. Especially vaccinated yet probably wont till May worry! DeSantis hate boner juice huh? really careful trying tease anything meaningful excess deaths. number cumulative distinguish cause death, huge contributing factors hidden data.

The common example often referenced likely decrease automotive deaths Covid. There's side though, likely deaths preventable treatable causes people either unwilling unable get care normally would have.

We're never going reliable count true Covid deaths point. data tracked accurately beginning - there's way accurately tease data now. Cool, shots arms look Cuba's homeless rate compared US's😉 I've got news you: NJ, hospitalizations way up. Effected age group? 21 35. seniors. well maybe gave 1C chance opening all.... seems pretty obvious tactic open vaccines shrug shoulders point feds people cant get appointment get second tomorrow, stay sober it. basically daycare kids young mask? son 8 months I’ve working full time remotely caring full time. It’s exhausting treatment disorder already? mask on? How? Yet It’s still small fraction Oh yeah make difficult. drove 2.5 hours get mine, car makes far difficult prospect. **\[Sincere question\] vaccine ever resulted side effects appeared later on?**

I'm talking rare instances problems vaccine resulted long term effects, rather ever vaccine problems show months (or more) later?

BTW: clear, I'm pro-vaccine gets. always get flu shot already gotten 1st shot Moderna. I'm asking question think important point convincing others may hesitant. believe answer no, I've finding hard find credible source could ""prove negative"" exhausting known outcomes vaccines. know multiple people reinfected within year Buden done great job regarding vaccine roll covid passports freaking people out.  Digital passport freaking way.  vaccine card fema gave me.  wont taking part passport program... wouldnt understand ones risk, you. care? Also parents allowed actually make parenting decisions. know people infected twice Covid within year. seem antibodies last 6 months. say vaccines last possibly years. promise deliver. Classic 7d chess move. masking 8 hours day. It’s ridiculous. reports showing effective Pfizer Moderna - getting better news every day. hate football, excited football fans. Go freaking blast people.  year 2092, urgent press conference held.

""I'm scared,” said CDC Director Subi Wazlogoyoz, said feeling “impending doom"" 87th wave reoccurring.

The CDC reminds Americans receive 90th booster shot Pfizer vaccine, remain socially distanced masked world population vaccinated year 2998. ""Just hang little bit more,"" said Director Wazlogoyoz. link here. Data collection analysis takes time. assume shit Africa. Fact matter African countries handled pandemic much better getgo. daughter's dad Gambia one knows sick. Senegal front page news enviable handling pandemic. trust lot countries statistics.. Including first foremost US cannot wait till get kids covid vaccine. previous post gave explanation? usually see flu cold seasonal, likely reasons. would interested show many flu cases per capita Florida gets vs national average. lower too, could see environment big reason why. 5-6 NJ, they're increasing.  Watching someone eat steak well done makes blood pressure rise gives anxiety. affect others Expect big cities one part. great attraction pack bar honestly.

Would want go bar packed scrubs deny science, people vaccines?  easy choice. Hi neighbor, NJ sucking right you. cases hospitalizations way up. real world data states moving mandates optional policies.  I’ve noticed takes chains roughly 24-48 hours post announcement update restrictions See, answer like part. Fuck 'em, cage deniers together.

The problem share facilities lines rest people completely stupid. risks getting covid pregnant woman much greater side effect vaccine. Higher risk ending ICU ventilator, mention risking fetus well. data needed ongoing pregnancy studies make firm conclusion, low risk long term side effects mRNA vaccines make much less risky potentially getting covid pregnant.

My wife 13 weeks pregnant recommended OB/GYN wait second trimester wanted get vaccine. first trimester risky immune response vaccine potentially causing fever, potentially lead miscarriage first trimester (a fever general is). 

I think less hard decision recommendation based risk/reward. mean Canada failed vaccine rollout inevitably wait states hit herd immunity guys do? must reallly happy huh. /s implication regularly tested infection, original study didn’t do. you’re vaccinated don’t need isolate. per new guidelines.  
Everything else I’ll agree yeah nurses said used travel. ever gonna proof offical documentation esp. international travel? loaded question haha.

i guess interm I'll laminate card. too. yet people worried unproven, rare vaccine side effects heard Facebook. get it. Thats confirmation Bias started relaxing restrictions right away concerned. soon opened everything, changed things, make sure got vaccine. opinion makes sense open things vaccinations readily available everyone (I say aged 16+ qualifier otherwise overly pedantic people attack saying kids get year now).

Good luck. hunger games scenario. protect vulnerable first. Agreed, what’s driving mitigation tactics? First give hospitals time prepare, keep overwhelming them, protect at-risk, wait vaccine approval, let at-risk get vaccinated. next? What’s goal here? friends parents AZ one I’m panic attack incredibly optimistic given 30% country still thinks hoax.

Right we're going people want vaccine, there's lot sure.  next months we'll find stockpiles backing people taking expected.

Once happens, different calls need made based location. we're going pay trillion dollar packages point...

Says who? Since pay things? Money level made concept. like going bill coming due point creditors calling Biden demanding makes payment. agree premise kids low risk serious infection Covid. Aside -tho, stated false equivalent. eating rare steak impact anyone you. Mask mandates little vaccine hesitation. surge spots want it.  exceptions, saw type things world. America special seem think. Proving negative always least herculean task.

In case, think way could prove come lab convince majority care would definitively find source reservoir demonstrate possible likely path infecting humans.

It's equivalent old TV Matlock style criminal defense: prove innocent actually solving crime finding actual guilty party.

And succeeded got buy people care, still satisfy them. Australia killing it, feels lot better days I’m simply pointing irony- hence “lol.” Whatever “argument” you’re seeing want argue it. 

But want take it- agree completely selling medical history would absolutely fucked, even though almost definitely happens extent, proving you’ve vaccinated tested negative COVID-19 pandemic event future ONLY, don’t think that’s fucked.

So summarize, “this pass includes medical data it’s completely mandatory enter business state country,” vote no, it’s “show don’t COVID ride plane,” don’t care. No, understandable take, baseless fear. COVID extremely higher chance causing long-term symptoms vaccine. Everything vaccine far seems tell us it’s worth tiny tiny risk especially compared actually getting covid. Right, fucks get vaccine problem.

Sounds like great use vaccine pass. There's reason allow bunch deniers tightly packed area. low 1.8m? Bonus question: thinking trying get vaccine hospital 15:30 10 April. husband appointment (I'll go him) established patients I'm eligible yet. thought Sat would mean less people time 15:30 means end day maybe left vaccine.

What think? look needle going in, look opposite direction. barely feel it. truly tragic. country shortage medical professionals, loss 74 doctors significant impact lives people suffering international embargo 6 years devastating attacks SaudiArabia UAE.

And world even losening restrictions receive help equipment desperately need. Nice Keep mind medical professionals touch general population, especially nurses GPs. stopped learning new things got licenses, they're notoriously skeptical whole. particularly true rural areas. mindboggling we're supposed trust many clueless. J&amp;J hits 90-95% 6 weeks severe COVID 100% hospital death prevention 28 days. Also important point tested different time Pfizer Moderna, lot scientists seem think tested together rates would similar. definitely made tear playground yesterday watching stand know do

and too! engaged making games etc. 

so im tearing another reason lol


everyday getting closer theyre learning more. gonna really tough us. good thing past year relaxing soooooo much emotional energy available lol    /s  Yeah group killed covid, I’d rather get ill covid, take vaccine likely kill me. Waiting pfizer/moderna/j&amp;j instead tyvm one neighborhood ever kids play together masks. prevent people getting symptoms (which concern) also detect virus PCR. means even exposed virus cleared antibodies fast enough take hold therefore around spread people

but would know exposed virus RT-PCR came negative? That’s whole population vs adults (the eligible population) True comes time children well being, suggestion practical many situations. think that’s comment getting rest every mask vaccinated  I'll wait we're far enough acceptable gym without mask try get membership going I'm even going try working one hate argument much. makes zero fucking sense mRNA can’t even enter nucleus cell. Yet people youtube deny well known fact, along fact mRNA degraded transcribed, driving insane. competition, even spike numbers now. fine take counter Tylenol ibuprofen. That’s bad thing. emergency powers effectively give executive power legislate. short term power granted extreme emergencies. Absolute nonsense, Astra safe.

Ignore profit mongerers. Moderna? too. Fever first night, ok day, around 10 pm night 2, exhaustion, terrible chills fever again. Felt ok around lunchtime today... shall see night 3 goes. suspect factors play NY specifically... uses birth control likely get blood clot az vaccine think things all. certainly point keep hospitals overwhelmed, difficult thing virus lot room error.  Places open up, cases potentially go up, hospitals start see increases bad spot. act keeping hospitalizations check easy respect opening measures.  thing needs communicated.  can't policy ""hey, hospitalizations low let's open way up"" monitor situation change.  measured approach keeping hospitalizations check.

NY even exaggerating spent time waiting adverse effect checking getting shot. Even military administering said surprised efficient line they’re still getting record number people coming I’ll wear mask I’m required to. I’m outside? I’m eating places? I’m going to. 

And I’m going live life, meaning I’m going travel go see loved ones different households, wasn’t before. course, guys focused masks. many unexplained deaths California proper comparison? now? Lol Ya I’m saying fun ever wake one day realize masks biggest problem, I’ll probably grateful I’ll never complain Yeah would seem logical don’t think US that. knowing US, anyone suggests obvious thing branded hateful racist nonsense. Countries like Australia New Zealand right idea. Even smaller island countries like UK Ireland chance, kept travel going long wasted chance.

It feels like would wise pandemic control. knows countries refuse to? think *invented* freakin' internet using, child?

I mean, [Tim Berners-Lee 65, he's young upstart terms Internet guys. consolation world overrun vaccines long run different vaccines approved, processes refined, manufacturing hubs come online, etc bandwagonners demanding ethical science thrown window still defend az shot? 

Its time conduct extra studies used best effect. 

There room knee jerk emotional reaction comes scientific data. mean come hostile. Still practicing less emotional online.

US German rewarded, vaccines, there's that. broader issues mind wrote that. Cheers. factoring people already got disease. see anything discrimination. choose whether get vaccinated, get freedom choose whether u live consequences (of passport instance) act accordingly.

To discrimination like - Asian. Nothing u change ethnicity. u get picked this. that's textbook discrimination I'm sure evidence vitamin kept cases agree cases went lockdown UK opened cases low September things picked again. seasonal effect definitely played role summer. obey local regulations whatever business owner set up. People fully vaccinated give glow indicates they've fully vaccinated ripping mask theater, still going get bitched people assume been. simpler follow rules. sure, health perspective, mask really needed either. pretty makes rolling vaccine passports useless, we’re gonna back square one two year anniversary lockdowns.

I guess it’s time tell people accept masks. reason get healthier weight? isn’t zero sum game. 
We everything possible stay healthy.  Pfizer dad dicking covid. Well done. Party take Rinhovirus! Seeing friends locally done safely. Going vacation Florida different. really want see details survey.

What's really strange Poland really well early on? bunch friends Poland. Last year around time remember envious well transitioned virtual school, encouraged WFH, kind stuff. mask pandemic sane practical request

That's governor mandate 60 days emergency, court ruled. that, obviously sane practical, congress approve mandate there's issue. congress approve it, must common sense, agreed-upon thing, governor able override congress enact it? glad! think part society, especially democracy, people need able take initiative sometimes learning things impact daily lives. example. cannot always burden [insert entity here] (in case FDA) outreach educate masses. masses need care enough research ask questions - need answered. short, education needs go ways. Depends part UK live in. Source- also healthcare worker surrounded healthcare workers Scotland got pfizer. life isn’t normal yet. It’s not. bit patience wait you’re putting people’s life danger increasing crowd density/ travelling/ etc. employees chance get vaccinated yet. math mostly checks out, issue timeframe. 83 vaccinated cases start measuring point individual vaccination onwards. might early February late mid-March. (Washington 1.2MM vaccinated today, like they're discussing people fully vaccinated Feb 1). ""control"" group measures entire duration. time ""area curve"" much larger control group. 

It tricky sort kind rolling update. way really get pick point time, take everyone vaccinated point, compare control population certain period time going forward. Anyone gets vaccinated meantime get counted analysis all. think kind mixture vaccine rollout. Michigan bizarre vaccine rollout issues. 

One site 10 vaccine administrations first week despite well 200 doses available them. asked said wanted efficacy testing wanted vaccinate one person time prevent spread vaccination sites. 

There uproar following week going slowly explanation complete non answer. proceeded ramp vaccination efforts countering 'measures' place prior. Thankfully vaccinated population doesn’t really transmit virus let EU handle procurement vax, Germany would swiming Biontech juice. guess merkel wanted show solidarity less wealthy countries adopt unified approach. 

I flew back US get shot reckon Germany 3-4 months behind US i'd say much poulation vax end Q2. pretend mind could changed anything did.

If refuse accept direct source proof, would accept? peaked went lockdown, summer vitamin exposure kept immune systems working. comes winter cases go up. become palpable time goes on. Nursing homes accounted around 40% deaths. We're stage cases virtually eradicated, pretty soon we're going saying deaths. sure mean, think post Oct 2020 November well 100k level.  December January even worse. US needs deal bedrock issue obesity it’s associated illnesses. had, covid wouldn’t lethal society. no, we’re giving away free fuckin’ Krispy Kreme vaccine doses. long shot test? surprise. Delta last major US airline yet gotten rid middle seat blocking. getting couple downvotes telling truth vaccine-based herd immunity probably require children get vaccinated Reddit move. I'm one said placebo 98.5% efficacy, there's that. delete comment plan smartass later on? long got shot(s) test? first second dose? things matter lot. I’m 18 years old received Pfizer (second dose Friday). I’m curious know efficacy actual age group instead including people 50 60 years older I. Im glad news outlets pointed fact term “double mutant” bullshit 

Most variants coronavirus *more* 2 mutations. nothing special 2 mutations. mutations concerning, since one somewhat similar E484Q “double mutant” title sensationalist crap

Also, variant hasn’t detected high enough numbers responsible spike cases India, currently far B.117 India new variant Well said.

I think reality people (rightfully) traumatized COVID. lot us found ways live life makes us feel 'safe'. around people normal things felt 'unsafe' us year, take adjust. know people fully vaccinated continue shift goal posts ready go back things. sad/hard watch, think reality is, they've told people/germs deadly year, can't bounce back pre-COVID life Day 1.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Scary. peak U.S. deaths per day? Anyone remember? read mayor Paris wants close schools put stricter rules catch increasing numbers.

They meeting morning, wonder went. 

We see 8pm


The Swedish government closed borders 3 weeks. travel country except emergency stopped.  Clearly “We’ve seen shift little bit younger age group. They’re 5 years younger we’ve seen past,”

Straight click bait states restrictions well, restrictions. they're worse, high population density, course they're worse! Leaving context situation makes fearmongering, otherwise fearmongering reasons previously listed.    interested, trial's public summary list US centres participating (the different age groups may called different times, since they're looked separately). feel symptoms vaccine 'controlled' compared virus, makes sense. got rocked, never scared. got covid (i'm high risk), would scared shitless. vaccine suppose do, thus symptoms. virus *can* predictable, also turn unpredictable moment (mostly older risk people course). 

I find odd see younger people eager get vaccine yes, protect you, also protects others like vulnerable family members might seen year. don’t know people want justify hell they’ve put social distancing wanting feel control, yes. Many really downplay inevitability covid spread based weather seasonality factors talking control group study. reasonable assumption tested, regularly, regardless whether presented symptoms not.

And yes, also reasonable use 1.6% infection rate fair statistic. goal always 'flatten curve'. rate vaccinating US, seems unlikely overwhelm hospitals point.

I'm Texas got rid restrictions two weeks ago one major hospitals shut COVID unit, meaning even one major hospitals confidence flattened curve (at least now). Young teens already even affected virus. old risk people already vaccinated US, still houses? agree actually, guessed incorrectly advocating vaccine nationalism.

The way emphasized taxpayers made think thought US German taxpayers ones reaping rewards.

Sorry confusion. Oh, yeah, agree. Verified huh. I’ve investigated cleared wrong sort thing haha Well seems that’s worse flu all. make rethink statement know efficacy vaccine calculated. necessarily think end median position halfway ""Fauci"" ""normal people."" think end median position among citizens, among Fauci ONE idiosyncratic goof. makes scientific sense whatsoever.

Oh, hey, someone respects experimental clearly dangerous vaccine 

Scientific citation 99.95 survival rate get?

Boils single marker epidemic talking point.

I think known scientific sense actually means. Fortunately come true least now. [this ""In survey 77 epidemiologists, two-thirds said world likely year less virus changes much existing vaccines effective new strains.""

If happen, virus changed enough evade vaccines \~a year, evidence existing vaccines would least protect vaccinated hospitalization/death (until boosters widely available)? lol 'logical assumptions' 'known variants' example, blatant one executive branch clearly got wrong. Trump v. Hawaii another. edited He's saying since November... live PA. idea many people WA vaccinated. read headline, worried. read article realize 100 1.2 million actually BETTER expected. yes, headline fear mongering people proper context, i.e. total number vaccinations WA. headline writers knew I’m ashamed bought it. Yeah, interested thought wrong US study. Dosing mistake U.K. ridiculous. Concerning sense? quoted text states proven anything. difference is, Germany internet Neuland. agree feel like Fauci likely fight things permanent, feel like compromise agree one that’s tolerable, I’d choose masks passports. +2.67 million according Cyrus Shahpar versus +2.26 million last Wednesday. Daily average 2.83 million (new record). excludes funding directed basic research, vaccine purchases, funds directed increase manufacturing capacity, supply vaccines technology transfers.

I mean...a bit arbitrary guideline set article. wondering 2.2 billion seemed tiny. went 95 percent effective 90 adults last week, I'd take number grain salt. long term side effects? far data showing natural infection equivalent one dose vaccine (lots breakthrough cases) natural infection + 1 dose far superior two doses vaccine. change recommendations one dose already infected honestly, getting one dose natural infection *really* trick. label ""everyone wants verify long term efficacy vaccine"" anti-vax? see accusation anywhere, actual anti-vaxxers *are* running rampant, figure mean.

This actual evidence there's cause concern particular vaccines, undoubtedly make overall anti-vax problem worse. Despite cases like these, anti-vax still problem much bigger public health risk everyone running around without vaccines all. (not saying means get AZ vaccine anyway, presumably point going used anti-vaxxers evidence even safe vaccines) Part timing though. Hospitals little idea treat help people beginning pandemic, states got hit later benefit learning best practices states got hit early Meanwhile local former UFC fighter posting things like 53% effective 65-74
- 0% effective people 75
- 8% developed suspected rona
- 1 200 SEVERE side WOULD GET THIS!?!?! Ending mask mandates everyone 16 eligible sign vaccine infuriating. Nationwide haven’t really even seem significant decrease 7 day average compared 30 days ago close enough vaccines adults want we’re yet. Thanks this. knew situation, know case name.

I feel like even good example SCOTUS upholding executive powers legal standpoint, really makes want consider whether allowed precedent. REALLY shitty decision, opinion. know benefit hindsight here, defense executive power, makes want immediately limit executive power. two died 80 years old. Oh, think stupidity ally. merely adopted stupid; born it, molded it. see education already man, nothing BLINDING!

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think Germany bad? Look Canada. Particularly province Ontario. places still take forehead temperature find people fever. least weed people obviously sick.

This catch lot people that--even symptomless people. find everyone Covid, find lot them. (Plus, understanding people contagious likely get caught test).

I assume would rather get plane number people Covid detected allowed board, opposed getting plane plane you. finally able get signing Lancaster. received email last week day registering able schedule appointment week. recommend trying far drive you. get Pfizer, likely won’t even feel shot. looking away got mine didn’t (minor) side effects later may wondered actually given shot! Everyone know gotten Pfizer didn’t feel all. Idk vaccines use Canada though.   interesting question. phenomenon point certainly true: many young people suffering side effects vaccine would got virus. them, many.

But that's whole picture.

First, COVID reinfections happen, likely increase near future variants emerge. necessarily trading one COVID illness two vaccine side effect sessions. might trading two three COVIDs.

Second, risk death zero vaccine non-zero COVID, even young healthy. individual, top priority preventing death, happy trade significant side effects that, even risk death otherwise small. want spin wheel fortune ""you die suffocation"" slot all, matter big wheel is. I'm happy alternatively spin wheel fortune death slots even though half slots say ""feel worse COVID day"". Yes, know take risks every day. strictly rational, that's people you.

Third, probably importantly, impact beyond yourself. get vaccinated, means know close approximation can't give disease anyone, therefore morally responsible innocent people dying, second priority.  law written says 60 days. law followed. don’t chuck Rule Law aside even pandemic. voters want hold legislature responsible, next election cycle. period extended beyond 60 days amending statute. start dismantling Rule Law emergencies, don’t surprised leaders start declaring “emergencies”. there. Shivered that. Tomorrow opening day forecast high 42 strong winds lake. love Northsiders, that’s me. Great news.

I'm going miss days /r/coronavirus posts made /r/all. (Not really.) Looking forward another niche kind subreddit one ever visits. larger dose (100 vs 30 believe). 2nd yesterday. shot 1, soreness around injection site. mild. time, arm sore, back ache, fever 100.2 (although known check), mild headache, mild chills. feel great, I'm working home getting around ok. sister Pfizer really sore arm dose two. Also consider Germany 83M people US clearly Germany 0 deaths per 84th million people, 0 deaths per 85th million, US many deaths per million, way past 300th million.

It checks appointment availability every minutes bunch different stores pharmacies. Check rural zip codes willing drive to. CVS Selinsgrove instance dozens appointments available Saturday. Obviously know live that's example. get ideal case send 1 billion doses vaccine every country around world instantly. However, currently supply constraints. 

If country enough doses fully vaccinate everyone within borders (lets say 100 million) could choose send abroad. Ultimately though, Global pandemic 100 million doses go 100 million arms regardless arms are. 

Sharing vaccines speed progress vaccination one iota. Arguably, sending enough doses neighboring countries prioritized front-line medical staff elderly could dramatic impact death rates. There's going lot therapy needed lot people soon. interesting look people safe. tell what, sure nice clean conscience. absolutely sure spread covid contribute hundreds thousands deaths country. But. it’s double! Double trouble! First day free vaccines South Carolina got J&amp;J! Felt like flu shot. Prepared feel like crap next day hoping best! whole €5000 day, afford lmao know week week first doses? love trending title this, various websites, 100 people got sick post vaccination. Not, something along lines vaccines supposed to.
The media grossly irresponsible. makes happy finaly going able get vaccine soon. Can't wait get vaccine able enjoy life go see fav band AJR concert. 😁😂 I've seen many people math seriously think valid way run numbers find funny anymore. *should* funny, isn't.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Even within states. I'm high vaccine acceptance county, surrounded low acceptance counties. officials working like 60 year olds, counties wide open begging people come county take doses. state finally officially said fine travel another county county allows - course can't put vaccines cooler truck move them, would crazy. don’t understand question. don’t think Covid deaths determined it’s within 28 days testing positive. Oh man experience SoCal varies much. 

Many friends got via government distribution sites straight shit show. Multi-hour start end, rejected insufficient documentation even though they're clearly qualifying tiers, nightmare playing appointment lottery demand high. 

Meanwhile, go redder part town hit pharmacy, like 20 minutes start end problems getting next day appointment waitlisting couple days leftover dose. true. PA sent plenty doses Philly suburbs failed put state residency requirement place. NJ NY natives crossing border taking PA doses PA residents. see article yesterday Israel Pfizer? live get you’re 16 age group. perhaps assume 12 year old adult trail 40-50 year olds applies them. body mature 12, close enough. (Note said perhaps could, argument reasonable, one agree with)

Once get 12 things get lot complex. Bodies maturing - different rates different kids. way sure dose work - often smaller body needs smaller amounts medication. way knowing immune system react way, need safety studies. way knowing immune system even work - problem gets really bad 18 months. 

Thus separate studies younger kids. kidding, that's hard age group barely affected covid. know masks protecting others protecting yourself. guess knew Don’t take antihistamines unless they’re something normally would take regular day, avoid alcohol beforehand. Antihistamines taken specifically preventing/lessening allergic reaction may make reaction harder diagnose. Alcohol *might* speed allergic reaction. painkillers, haven’t seen anything else avoid vaccination. You’re right, think referencing Trump v. Hawaii would better, Koretmatsu sounds like unlimited power long word “national security” thrown in, reality power still bounded loose constraints. I’m glad find helpful. I'm Cleveland, Ohio area hunted around Ohio, MI, PA, KY also PR (as family there).

PA particular always see people saying hard get appt. However every time look, find appointments within 1hr drive point PA. one transportation motivated...it ain't hard. course homebound, different story.

I think big challenge PA slower expansion eligibility. idea webmd political content. Good hear. Keep good work. 100% agreed, thanks sharing this. lot folks don’t realize FDA often highly involved company planning study, involved study too. study, Covid vaccine trial. behooves company FDA review things early ensure conducting things way FDA later agreeable scientific perspective. injured leg baseball game point couldn’t walk rest day 12. Next day, couldn’t even tell hurt it. entire body hurts sit long would assume large amount ""covid deniers"" ""anti-vaxers"" would something it. really good news fans virus. got can’t come apartment visit. meet outside. Great question, probably precedent idk! Looks like vaccine Matt Gaetz something common. correct. isn’t coincidence counties New York New Jersey border struggling rest state vaccinating people pretty brisk pace. Allegheny County sizable population isn’t experiencing problems Montgomery County isn’t matter population size.  Fall chair 65+? 

That’s 911 call, ER trip, head CT. 

(Sometimes that’s patient volume) help because, well, could not? think much help overstated. joke, so… first quarter year ends...today, way. see misinformation, please report we'll remove it! Remember total supply limited, though. country outpacing others grabbing fair share. BioNTech's vaccine. surprised thin margins commercial air travel, yeah could collectively agree always block middle seats long we're okay ticket prices universally increasing least 50%. got really sleepy that’s side effects. offering booster shot Sinopharm think I’d rather take Pfizer vaccine. know bunch people Sinopharm created sufficient amounts antibodies, me. can’t get definitive conclusions Johnson Johnson really great. Sigh. know reading hard, I'll get downvoted really care going post something, least read content understand reading. 1st link say anything carrying virus, actually says quite opposite: study’s strengths design: participants self-collected nasal swabs week RT-PCR laboratory testing, regardless whether developed symptoms illness.  Researchers able look evidence SARS-CoV-2 infection irrespective symptoms. **A small number (10.7 percent) infections study asymptomatic (i.e., result symptoms). However, majority infections (58 percent) occurred among people whose infections identified testing developed symptoms knew infected.** study demonstrates two mRNA vaccines **reduce risk** SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic infections.  important **preventing asymptomatic pre-symptomatic infections among health care workers essential workers vaccination help prevent spread SARS-CoV-2** care serve. Findings study complement earlier reports two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines **reduce** asymptomatic symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. 

Reduce risk reduce number infections mean carry virus spread it. Simply means risk host (the person) reduced. Yes, help protect helps prevent 90% chance infected virus, say stops able spread it.

Look, we're ready end I've personally already gotten 1st dose, spreading misinformation either intentionally understanding something something preventing. much following Wisconsin supreme court? 

Because they're compromised legislature. would much less bothered decision Wi SCT demonstrated extreme partisanship past years. 

There's simple solution problem one two major parties democracy trying break democracy, quite frankly, I'm okay one branch government electoral legitimacy making decisions emergency, rather two branches don't. society’s collective experience running vaccine trials using vaccines throughout history, aren’t really long-term side effects. side effects worry short-term 15 minute waiting period. time highest chance something dangerous happening (most likely allergic reaction). that, chances decline sharply whatever side effects short term bearable, like muscle aches temporary fever.

And make sure know possible side effects best thing get many people trial possible monitor side effects monitor thousands people time. chances something happening *frequently enough concern* trial didn’t see inside trial astronomically low - like happened AstraZeneca blood clot issue. may happened trial, cases happening general population low can’t attributed vaccine really.

Let’s take Bells Palsy example. reports people developing Bells Palsy getting vaccine. Well, reviewing cases determined number times happened equal less number times random person walking street would suddenly develop condition. words, folks hadn’t gotten vaccine, would developed Bells Palsy anyway, speaking statistically.

There’s lot talk media whenever “new” side effects pop up, even elderly person dies vaccinated. Think way.... vaccinating population time. normal life, people medical events die. give everyone vaccine within window time, people continue medical events die. long medical events deaths aren’t occurring often getting vaccine would occurring “natural life” (ie vaccinated) concern. can't tell serious not. yes, remember reporters wearing ski masks whatnot. 😆 apparently highly effective messaging judging state world today. ignored deaths caused Sinovac reason directly jump conclusion Basically every state higher excess death rate officially reported COVID death rate. Florida unique here. Excellent point. brilliance innovation world meaningless without logistical power amplify that. pfizer deal smart behalf firms. people Poland care level mass media terror absurd reaching whole new level here. Nobody taking thing seriously anymore government screwed badly since beginning. nothing right wait out/get sick/get vaccine. I've cautious last year I'm tired this.  reply post. original comment literally pointed finding ""missing-link"" variants would constitute evidence zoonotic transfer theory.

Your correction? Pointing finding ""missing-link"" variants would constitute evidence zoonotic transfer. Congratulations. Yes. know that. Looking Apple mobility trends US seeing movement since last summer. Public transit highest rate since start pandemic. 30 million literally amount predicted months ago. bizarre PR war EU changed either way. absolutely see places trying bring back mask mandates fall flu season. even mandates lifted, businesses remove restrictions policy costs money. case places like hospitals, government buildings, airports, may never happen. Losing 33% seats drives price 50%? Sun telling days? suggesting then? situation Brazil really, really serious rest world needs paying attention scenario ripe yet another potentially dangerous mutation. US producing vaccine, grabbing anyone deutschen Wesen soll die Welt genesen, amirite?

No one denying US UK bad initial responses pandemic, Germany better response. 

That’s really relevant what’s happening now, except super defensive types want defend Germany costs. 

I’m sure trying make Germany vs. US UK...but want to, here’s people worried about:

The cumulative case rate per 100,000 (all cases):

US: 8900

GER: 3500

Case rate, last 30 days:

US: 535
GER: 437

Germany still better, difference much closer.

Case rate, last 14 days:

US: 243

GER: 263

US slightly better. Why? Probably vaccines.

Case rate, last 7 days:

US: 129

GER: 147

The gap widening more, probably almost due vaccines.

Cases Germany increased 25.4% last 7 days. 

In US, 13.1%.

In UK, decreased 6.8%. 

*This* people Germany unhappy. past performance, what’s happening right now. trust numbers? Imho much Ukraine. great news, since under-18s lowest risk group, don’t prioritise giving vaccines adults need poor countries instead? would also like take time refute rumors began spread regarding personal character former top moderator. rumors personal attacks categorically false, appreciate working us restore original mod team put r/Coronavirus back track.

Is former head mod still going mod old new account? Variants need many hosts form - enough people likely vaccinated fall reduce risk all. people changing tune getting vaccine. Given many workplaces start requiring it, I'd say people care wallets irrational Bill Gates mind control fears Wear masks, Arkansas. governor idiot. No, 10 million. Sorry, mislstake percentage, I'll update right, Pfizer running 3rd dose booster trial let’s see sources. claim much evidence yet show little? 

I’m literally one providing actual sources yet claim would one use “fake news” “anonymous sources” you’re one calling fake news evidence lacking sources. irony strong you.  Pfizer throws money

It's bad money useful research drug development! Honestly I'm going lose *too* much sleep slow JnJ deliveries. We're ultimately going limited number people get vaccinated. I'd rather 70% US population vaccinated 90-95% effective vaccines 50% 90-95% effective 20% 60-70%. We're going struggle get 70% vaccinated population is. We're going demand constrained states late April, JnJ change timetable week either direction volumes they're talking May 1st. 

I'd save JnJ vaccine hesitant refrigerator ball game offer coke hotdog (I'm slightly exaggerating). No. there's ""just because"" fancy math.

Covid hands considerably worse Flu.  Full Stop. Period. That's it. Imagine thinking mask compliance measured political leaning  set precedent says Conservatives kill letting live mildly inconveniences them.

Please share reputable source vaccine 'clearly dangerous' otherwise fuck bullshit trolling. Great resource - thanks sharing. insight when's best time day check appointments? site looks like Fox News California. problem analysis also needs look collateral damage adults well.

Edge cases always exist, according data far EXTREMELY UNLIKELY things listed occur healthy kids young adults. unlikely fact odds practically kids spread virus members community.

I seen much data show asymptomatic transmission common occurrence (if got I'd happy read them), even vaccines much help since make immune anyways. anything would make asymptomatic transmission likely since reduce covid symptoms would typically tell others stay away counties entering orange tier, obviously view pandemic over. got it.

Courts seem like extremely slow act past year, maybe chose ignore legal technicalities perceived necessity. rather beautiful. yet France criticising U.K. months delaying 2nd shots, granting emergency approval country, using AZ vaccine seniors younger adults, etc. joke. Bannaroo back Delta selling middle seats again. signs things returning normal. It’s enough governments end restrictions private companies don’t follow suit. will. you. 

I hope don’t get sick due lack precaution taken many fellow citizens.  act like teenager lot. count  reason cancel vaccine appointment COVID received antibody therapy treatment (in case, CDC recommends waiting 90 days) currently positive symptomatic (don't spread disease).

Otherwise, congrats getting vaccine appointment. entire family got aside sister's family, probably susceptible. got different sources. Probably 30 us include SO's family. fever bronchitis, diarrhea bad headache fever. brother ""24 hour cold"" called it.

Don't get wrong, I'm fortunate mild us. point bet people know get tested realize it. dad tested positive completely asymptomatic whole time. saddest part disproportionate effect school closures lower socioeconomic groups. mean well withim rights shows gaping hole misinformatiom idiocy goes thought process. try explain parents. 

I care much government efficiency. care government redundancy. efficient government would never invest dozens vaccines purchase combined amount doses much higher population needs. 

But US basically cover bases based available. Alright. Finland trying retain #1 position UN’s World Happiest Places Index. Restrictions make living unhappy. Finnish finished, doesn’t matter bc can’t take survey. 😑 don’t understand reluctance California’s counties cities wanting get kids back classroom. county Northern California, teachers school employees general given opportunity get first vaccine shots roughly 7 weeks ago. means chose to, would fully vaccinated point. said two daughters, ages 10 5, finally see inside classroom hybrid model starting April 12th. 

Here’s kicker, hybrid model used Unified District 4 hours site per week. That’s right, possible 34 hours campus, two hours day two days week that’s teachers either fully vaccinated chance gotten fully vaccinated. 

It’s outrageous power teachers unions California it’s proven don’t give rats ass students, it’s wallets. sick frankly don’t know parent. It’s amazing hearing “getting vaccine today” within general conversations. Heard twice already today. - 202.8m - 78.6%

Does ""at rate"" consider likely event administration accelerates? We're currently sitting 45,000,000 unused doses due administrative lag, hopefully going corrected long then.

I think somewhere around eighty percent adults ceiling vaccination numbers due combination apathy skepticism- fair think acceptable since people probably immunized infection anyway- think we're going reach number end May.

I think we'll see eighty percent adults initiating beginning May either, would unbelievable unrealistic, think it'll two months rate things picking up. Thank this. fear mongering headlines really pissing off. course breakthrough cases, one ever said 100% effective. chodes trying stir shit actually great news. government stands front two levers: One lever reduces spread diseases benefitting people hurting corporations. lever takes away freedoms gives power government corporations.

You already know lever pulled. could like 300 people still SS. It’s always gonna soon someone. pandemic? get mask.

no mask? stupid? Well 6 months ago passing everyone. people cannot get vaccine. dont look see Heard immunity works. Plus everyone going want get well. Kinda poetic, huh? Awesome, thank you! know handful people, including grandmother it. surprisingly, grandmother zero symptoms found she’s tested weekly nursing home. 29 year old friend caught couldn’t break fever almost 4 days. crucial US people per million people per thousand people.  No, dont like candy. Trying convince 65 year old coworker (who regularly goes eat restaurants, nearly always forgets mask, extremely lax protecting others entire time) get vaccinated (Canada probably pretty soon). response never gets flu shot every year “doesn’t like getting shots.” one does, man. I’d rather get short poke arm get Covid either a) die b) long term health problems. don’t understand hesitation. I've done times given up. wife work, can't stay late every night trying this. 'reminding' us children need masked playdates vaccinated? update guidance say community spread reaches X level, get rid masks?

Also, community spread need low? thought goal flatten curve. shifting goal posts saying community spread needs low?  really healthcare system gets fixed tbh. People put going doctor healthcare, can't afford meds. Good, means family stuck country long time spike 1

Bruh death taxes. Question here!

I get second dose vaccine 11:30am 14th. make first solo 8 hour drive first thing morning 16th. 

I'm terrified I'll hit like truck can't make drive.

advice reducing symptoms heavily drive long safely?  say never buy lottery tickets zero chance winning - Id take odds. took mean would hit daily number much higher 100k/day. go up, currently wishing days 100k. got symptoms 1st Pfizer shot sure get 2nd shot well? likely Americans hand gotten least one dose takes effect. feel like people saying soon peel back restrictions seventy even eighty percent Americans vaccinated.

The restrictions come place going away once. gonna go away early gonna go away way late. think May right time. mask reasonable safety people.

I sure agree reasonable governor **order** state level without oversight. state legislature judiciary agrees, checks balances come play we're different chat.

Obviously state's judiciary agree governor's order, least questioning it. I'm happy least due diligence.

I would much prefer mask orders come short term local mandates (city maybe county level), re-evaluated renewed needed time. less Tennessee handled it, like process better governor mandate. I’ve seen lot people mention wearing masks crowded places COVID I’m curious constitutes crowded place you’d wear one? Genuinely asking, trying attack anything lottery got blood clots would luck Fortunately neighbor get protect them. bother? move spew nonsense somewhere else. Nice narrative, happened. Bad data work part, there. Every state cycle low high reporting weekdays. Typically case reporting slows weekend catches little bit day Friday.

For reason, need compare week-over-week numbers rather day-over-day numbers. mutes degree spike states (MD, AZ) actually shows *improved* weekly trend others (IL, AL) - words, results today good news.

There still several states case numbers rising, rapidly few, states improving plateauing could still get worse. context matters.

Don't Data Goofus, Data Gallant.  Normally would be, run interesting questions:

Assume virus fixed chance kill catch it. virus spread far country chance death really low virus simply spread enough make mark group. particular relevance young people.

Now roll vaccine kill fraction people.

What going exposing danger particular subgroup population risk virus, order protect people risk.

For extreme edge cases like, say, Norway, might end killing people groups vaccines virus. problem. people otherwise healthy risk lives protect people? might argue right force this. Country extremists  will. community spread low need masks. would guess guidance changes sometime Memorial Day July 4. American dream every country covid response (only ~25% believe done first shots end Q3, ridiculous, done first shots LOT sooner)

how done sooner ? even vaccinated 80 year olds state soon going invite 79 year olds . . done , invite 78 year olds . honestly see way receive vaccine year . Eli5: rising vaccinated adult population decrease potential exposure virus trials? change lucky mRNA worked out. worked J&amp;J would first vaccine approved.

Don't forget AZ/Oxford front runner vaccine long time, sudden failed.

The strategy invest lot different vaccines types vaccines good, still got lucky early got it. lot faith people play political games rather looking safety people. still passed regulators? That’s Joe’s plan.

Today shared 90% eligible vaccine April 19th. it’s supply logistics problem. exclude distribute share among rest poorer EU states. I'd willing give TAX money away that. CU Austria lawl It’s uncomfortable hell it’s nice getting breath living normally humans meant to. extremely low quality, sub become Stowed away? Lol. 

They produced. Italy raided vaccine production facility, got excited found vaccines. *Except Philadelphia*

I hate bumbling mobbed-up mayor much. Ohio opened availability everyone 16+ Monday. schedule Monday, managed get appointments sister boyfriends Tuesday (yesterday) morning. drive hour, worth it. Appointments available, people unable unwilling travel. Yes. We've already taken harder stance brigading, concern trolling, etc., imposed stricter automod rules, particularly Daily Discussion thread. really encourage report comment includes misinformation guaranteed reviewed us removal potential ban. also welcome modmail us time concerns. take misinformation **very** seriously. getting anecdotal evidence social media - don't. honestly believe lot stories been, uh, enhanced dramatic effect. personally suffer good society, social points get, right? mean, read stories, getting shot means least day near death. one know who's gotten side effects. Check websites pharmacies book next 1-2 weeks like Midnight add next day appointments end 1-2 week period. That’s got appointment Kroger February still people using day day increases calculate spread??? considered low quality posting? Biontech Marburg factory already producing substance. sterile fill &amp; finish done elsewhere though. first vaccine batches ready around mid April.

Sanofi manufacture Biontech, afaik help fill &amp; finish.  no, thats ignoring constitution. Thats recognizing constitution imperfect like law practicality needs outweigh exact lettering times.

a mask reasonable safety people. sensitivity specificity. look tests. Accuracy good need know sensitivity specificity one tells percentage false negatives (worst one) false positives (not bad).


Think way. test cancer positive tell sensitivity test tells many times positive test actually true positive cancer maybe another test see. let’s say test negative. tell specificity tells percentage times negative times actually means it’s negative. low specificity test though may lead false negatives thus people don’t think cancer actually indeed do. 

It’s important know values evaluating test first. Accuracy many times test correct pulling people letting covid patients think good. buy t-shirt need mention vaccine. somewhat protect, yes. 12 days amount protection substantial different statistically speaking imagine pride work whether volunteer paid. probably even worse using surveillance data flu versus confirmed flu deaths.  add excess deaths get reasonable comparison surveillance flu cases. It’s 147 million shots administered. 147 million people. Since it’s two dose regimen, fully vaccinated person requires 2 shots. bit both. *response* amazing, immune system still lot learn. get sick trivial stuff lot, learns.

But learn, performs well. tf anyone trying organise bunch nerds gather large numbers global pandemic first place vast majority vaccines 99% least. AstraZeneca *really* shit. best friend high risk, I’m excited vaccinated able see soon. I’m also excited don’t want risk chance caught covid might one people ends severe case despite young, don’t want risk long covid either. would much rather get vaccine, maybe feel like shit day fine gamble health health around risk. want vaccinated peace mind. saying 100% time believe nothing 100%. keep making mistake. want compare last wednesday look rolling 7 day averages. Comparing different days apples oranges. No, 107 million is. forecast, status report. Note ""by end March"" today. 107M doses EU received far. AZ delivered agreed, we'd close 200M doses delivered, AZ supposed largest source vaccines Q1 (with others catching surpassing later on). think means getting vaccinated would cure someone already lol surprise Sinovac effective, either way see death rate going link. Well obviously I’m going let regulators decide, choice! I’m allowed question decisions. I’m allowed believe making mistake! 

I literally watched interview bbc news french woman hospital covid offered AZ refused order wait Pfizer. still maintains would rather caught covid taken AZ. result feels like campaign AZ vaccine (although perhaps wouldn’t include clotting stats this, even though decision suspend still contributes anti AZ sentiments). France verge lockdowns, hospitals close icu capacity people die this. nope. means checks balances operating intended. appears that, large percentage population would consider ""young healthy"" (ie. 40 serious health issues), side effects vaccine appear worse disease itself. time, course, often not.

If saying *the side effects vaccination average worse symptoms risks young people actually catching COVID*, think even close accurate. Like example, friend mid-twenties caught COVID coughing lung felt like shit week recovered, know *anyone* vaccine side effects worse fever malaise couple days, I'll take latter day. even count really severe tail risk even *extremely* unlikely, could absolutely get hospitalized die COVID matter age is. Like yeah small percentage young people get hospitalized COVID, number people got life-threatening vaccine side effects small handful tens millions - basically rounding error. Vaccine side effects mostly inconvenience.

On top that, benefit reducing transmission risk older people actually *are* high risk COVID bigger benefit anything young people getting vaccine themselves. idea we'll ever back square one virus nonsensical. Mutation within endemic disease hold candle emergence novel virus never identified humans before. :

- surprising. remember reading many passionate Android vs Apple people group wants justify spent hundreds dollars phone. 

If miss best friends wedding aggressively distancing mad you, makes really hard go “hmm kidding maybe seasonality much bigger impact thought” Thank adding context It’s like Yelp, people something complain would speak loudest. Majority people get mild symptoms. Good thing didn’t stop working vaccines then. epidemiologist upset time spotlight coming end. screwed suburban Philly (and eastern PA general) NY NJ residency work requirement, vs. PA one. suburbs were/are fighting south jersey folks shots CVS locations such.

If shots going allocated population, residency thing vulnerable/1A phase. Otherwise end helping neighbors (like now) thousands 70 year olds still waiting many months in. 

It's ridiculous. PA taken ride. 10 days majority people develop small level immunity. 14 days protected 80 percent. moderation team taking action address rise misinformation present sub? I'm fully prepared join anti restriction anti mask protests current administration tries argue need wait kids get vaccine. killing less kids seasonal flu, preexisting conditions otherwise, I'm seeing strong evidence there's reason fear long term side effects children kind infection.

We went ""Millions people going die"" ""There could possibly maybe kind possible consequences people point decades now."" urgency almost gone soon almost everyone that's vulnerable going protected. still people think precautions place reason gone. I'm okay it. I'm voting politician is.  combination vaccine harmless natural infection push towards herd immunity? reducing hospitalizations would definitely huge benefit, even yearly-booster situation. can't helped. GOPenises again.  might me, numbers seem nearly big enough relevant overall vaccination campaign.

I get important figure what's going scientific point view, public health standpoint, ""maybe twenty cases"" misleading way saying ""virtually zero."" adults vaccinated, cares?  That's awesome! Congratulations! Flying kids summer going be... interesting.

They make real kid-size N95s, least I've able find. Distancing possible. I'm betting enforce masks. people left hoping everybody plane vaccinated (but God Forbid require it) and/or community rates across US low there's almost way someone COVID plane. existence effective vaccines isn’t reason overweight, like unwalkable cities huge corn syrup subsidies reasons Americans overweight. I'm cohort got vaccine stop living fear getting others sick. Additionally risk long COVID-19 real higher risk I'm comfortable with. Lastly like others said want quarantine avoid it! tangled fucking web Reddit Mod Life never ceases amaze me, that's unpaid volunteers. Add ones payroll spirals made permanent solely middle seat plane like special circle hell. going improve. april nearly much Pfitzer/Biontech sheduled delivery Jan-March total, plus start J&amp;J.

Assuming big problems, amount total vaccinations double april. ups downs pretty rare daily schtick.

I guess ya dont get it, ya dont get it. Peace. aren’t vectors spread and/or mutation. mean, guess could shoot anyone gets Covid prevent transmission deaths caused directly Covid ...not sure optics strategy though. .....I probably read anyway. Since 2.5% chance, obviously can't go 100%, ""other 2.5%""? governor totally f\*d beginning like Cuomo sending infected people nursing homes. deaths much higher per 100K that. Looks like Astrazeneca take approved US, believe lot stockpiled shots expire May probably first go since they'll pretty inconsequential rollout soon anyways. Let's get done with, hopefully start getting shots developed countries parallel well need desperately Reddit said pandemic 🙄 lol 100% effective reaches placebo group also prevents getting covid

seriously get vax anyway works garbage press release totally hyped echoed media, science supposed work It’s website course say it’s safe. thought EUA ""permit?"" two months Phase III trials geat said ""permit"" required. Like permit, one able use specific situations close monitoring. phase III trial concludes 6ish months, they'll apply ""license,"" unconditional use specified groups. mean CDC published data carrying virus

 [CDC Real-World Study Confirms Protective Benefits mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines | CDC Online Newsroom | 

Or one says safe vaccinated people gather maskless

 [Interim Public Health Recommendations Fully Vaccinated People | 

The CDC following data reporting exists. Saying ""you still spread it"" always 100% wrong. saying ""we enough data say sure vaccines stop transmission behave know sure""

Then followed data showing vaccines likely block transmission saying trust nothing then? yield traffic then? Theres engineers behind stop lights control traffic. food? Pfft, throw out. genetically modified centuries people much smarter you. needs cross walk? designed way are. dont need license either, medical procedure, dental work, nothing. clothes? Throw em out. phone? dont know works, toss it. Internet goes brrrr, toss too. 

Do see idiotic sound? Theres countless people study this, procedures tests even broke simpleton terms you, would struggle comprehend, like phone works, clothes made, modern combustion engines intricate parts mesh together optimal fuel consumption, processed food made anything touch day. rely people yet scientists, likely saved life previously (hello infant mortality rate 1800's!!) ""Scary Vaccines"" spit face rub shit hard work. capability empathy, understanding honestly dont know shit, neither anyone.

Clickbait?

NO ONE ever said vaccines 100% effective. people really think getting vaccinated means 0% chance contracting Covid?? question want thank guys front line saving patients deadly virus, grandpa tested positive COVID-19 I'm worried her.  Seems pretty proven thank response! worry getting exposed coworkers potentially virus right 2 weeks post j&amp;j vaccine mark. coworkers got tested yesterday, I'll getting tested tomorrow. small team, shutdown us get negative tests go back work, Unfortunately way. spreads faster? I’m sure you’re downvoted, I’d guess it’s people who’ve diagnosed anxiety disorder. Telling someone panic attacks “get it” like telling someone depression “get it.” Sadly, there’s still major stigma society anxiety. 😞  Seek medical attention lasts 4 hours! Wear mask distance much possible.

This line op almost definitely get downvoted, I'm guessing lunch time it'll negative.

I've noticed pattern sub, post something along CDC guidelines get upvotes first 1-2 hours, day goes it'll get dumped downvotes.  Another thing consider \~20,000 people stage III clinical trials might enough get statistically significant sample rarer side effects.

I particularly concerned anaphylactic allergic reactions due medical history, news reports people anaphylaxis getting shot first days public getting EUA. concerning me. month later, however, CDC released data allergic reactions first week administering shot. showed anaphylactic reaction rate roughly 1 100 000. 20,000 people clinical trial, likely would anyone severe reaction trial participants.

1 100 000 pretty infrequent me, reasonable precautions taken ensure vaccine sites emergency medicine personnel access epinephrine training diagnose treat anaphylaxis.

The CDC later released data, incidence 1 400 000. matter actual number, reactions incredibly rare. Reduce reservoirs viral replication possible mutation. appear healthy mean carriers People seem forget number 95 equal number 100.

This completely expected. Actually wait, actually UNexpected: i.e., .01% shows vaccines working way, way *better* expected. Yes. standing offers German army run vaccination sites 24/7 7 days week. enough vaccine available right now. think even run 50% capacity. 

We inactive vaccination centers ready use, standby, active ones less half load use family doctors etc yet. basically given injections come in. Thanks much letting know. seem related vaccine technique. understand difference UK results vs rest Europe. driver's license analogy great, I'm officially borrowing it! Yeah, people definitely need empowered take control destiny make health priority. lose single pound made priority life. education sure. like certainly echoes sentiments 

And yeah, I'd reject lot shit argues obesity secretly healthy whatever. 

But know, fault hell lot less productive empowerment. addictive feeling something always felt defeated capability control. needed resources help believe (after failing many times). certainly true sometimes news stories emphasize right message. Like, even vaccines confer 100% protection infection, *do* confer 100% protection *severe* infection that's amazing.

I'm certainly going I'm vaccinated, including finally seeing family year city.

But people around vaccinated, safer I'll feel.

Thankfully wait everyone (who willing) vaccinated seems like long, least US. ""Good News"" ? Wtf? #WARPSPEED  \~200 000 adverse effects reports relating 'vaccines', including \~4500 deaths EU alone. Sure investigation ought take place ""very rare"" effects. emergency approved vaccine. reason approved kids yet, truly know side effects. source simple common sense, know many subreddit lacking department. Fall chair age 80? There's significant chance die pneumonia recovering hospital stay couple days. Clearly point risk nasty side effect high enough vaccine used, appear point AZ

lets let regulators decide spring Europe number countries currently experiencing increases Covid rates look likely lead lockdowns soon. see believe that.

last year happened April/May, would expect see now, possibly later April. concerns US may prioritize vaccinating 12-15 year olds sending doses elderly folks middle low income countries. mom says perfect angel hit 5 years old, turned back-talking sass machine wouldn’t listen anymore lol Isnt Florida misleading numbers? guess would take deeper dive - obese people overrepresented data? overall outcomes worse overweight people (i.e. likely end ICU/die) sure good news tag, trend also seen Europe, specifically Norway, case. 

That reported last April. going one wanted come say majority Americans risk. Especially last administration's backlash pre pandemic critiscism overweight. was, unfortunately, brand risk downplayed. US Mexico end 2 affected countries, like seems trending, also makes sense Mexico's obesity overweight numbers, unfortunately. 6-11 already started 2 months behind US UK absolutely good reason. good enough dick always wonder see comments, really cry reading that? hyperbole? remember similar report came North Carolina WRAL.  imagine states states case for. What's frustrating article actually positive, quotes scientist saying exactly what's expected anything results even better that. worked HPV vaccine mid 2000s. first trials young women showed 100% reduction cervical pre-cancers caused types vaccine. Amazing data. Many vaccines get close, eg pneumo, shingles etc. Oh yes. country invades European countries (Ukraine, Crimea) friend. one foots largest part bill military protection type invasions. reminds vaccines 99.9 percent effective completely safe resume normal life I'm vaccinated. guess get different take aways story. Vaccines 100% effective severe COVID. That’s way, way better shaving percentage points risk healthy weight. fear-mongering continues. Gotta get clicks! Yes would statistical anomaly weren't. DVT common trials long large number people. chances developing DVT 1 1000 per year... Without frame reference, can't tell numbers up, down, same. Numbers seem bad compared supposedly happening community. percentage kids in-person, hybrid, remote? Probably long line inbred conservatives, basically mental capacities 12 year olds therefore, thing.  got pfizer vaccine appears gone chromebook updated windows seems shot working say abandon masks know issue is. ??? Dozens Central Florida contract COVID-19 fully meetings overrunning. longer meeting overruns idiotic ideas get. I'm guessing Vaxxoerrhea decided 10 meeting 1:10 pm someone cannot shut everyone else either yelling kids sneakily eating. nope, Red regions take summer reach 50%. Conservatives libertarians want open NOW. feel vaccine availability want shot able get within weeks, that's they're willing wait.  Yes article posted contradictory one. I'm fear mongering here, pointing inconsistent reporting subject harmful misleading. want take fucking masks much anyone, much nonsense floating around making things difficult. FDA update EUAs authorize use vaccines limit spread. understanding right authorized preventing illness, hospitalization, death vaccinated individual. math:

1. 33% seats decreased, left 67% seats. **100% - 33% = 67%.**
2. see much new price is, take inverse number 67%. **1 / 67% = 150%**.
3. new price 150%, shows 50% increase. **150% - 100% = 50%**.

The entire equation: (1 / (1 - 0.33)) - 1 = 0.50 Big pharma advantage existing network global branches subsidiaries experience handling local regulatory matters. small start-up hundred employees simply global network. CureVac, example, needs run trial US sell US. run trial US needs US partner handle US regulator. Aside that, CureVac quite capable running P3 trials even without big partner. fucking idiot? me, 2nd pfizer shot hit 10 hours post. terrible though, never fever. next day...I'd best describe as...all aches, pains, fatigue flu/bad cold without upper respiratory/fever/chills symptoms. night though, roughly 30 hours post vaxx, gone, happy.

Edit: armpit adjacent got shot swelled quite large(guessing lymph nodes) super painful days. mostly gone now. pain, maybe bit swollen, take lymph nodes couple weeks sometimes return normal size puffing like that. Almost good sub? Biden Harris aren’t helping matters either...and like feel they’ve actually turned around vaccine rollout better. Biden double masked point barely hear he’s saying Harris looks like she’s always dressed funeral, right message. CDC 100% confirms likelihood spreading virus negligible vaccine need take masks show life indeed move improve post-vaccine. Earth would anyone pro lockdown? Anyone else feel like hit 100M recently? see 150M. Hard wrap head around it, US absolutely killing it.

I got second today guess results within next day two.

I need donut. closer Krispy Kreme? r61738, know someone vaccinated mega site. Hi! Good news. need hands deck.  First off, first study we've seen confirming this. suspected vaccinated transmit virus, widespread studies something assumed. Salk vaccine polio, example, prevent vaccinated people transmitting, getting infected.

Yet another reason annoying politicized saying ""wait studies done"" later paying attention results studies gets branded ""flip flopper"" idiots think need prove things acting them.

If result holds up, good news.

But no, *not* wrong telling certain relatives still needed wear masks even though they'd vaccinated. No, 2 died. 8 hospitalized.

“Of group, two people died eight people hospitalized.” Yeah, headlines contradictory. I'm advocating anything consistent messaging subject. woke morning see headline vaccinated people state testing positive, afternoon see headline CDC saying opposite. fucking confusing. Thanks assuming I'm fear mongering, though. got vaccinated here. Second shot tomorrow.  using emergency powers judges ruling arrested, legislators journalists, I'd agree you.

Since they're asking wear fucking mask, idiot sense proportion. always Florida. expected media needs responsible headlines. think he's wrong say due him. almost given things better easy political points Yeah, you’re right, bad.  removed comment said ""cause young teens already 99.8% immune"".

In 2 months, placebo group infected 8x rate claim infected exposed virus. everyone could infected 2 month period, would long time ago. vaccinated group infected 0x rate claim. That's stark difference.

18/2200 indeed .81%, placebo group group comparing against. infected 1.6%. rate would expect vaccinated group effective. Yeah 20 second test kit they? Lithuania taken position E.U. approved vaccinations recognized planned Digital Green Certificate, meant easing travel across E.U. position apparently assumed positive signaling European pharma industry.

While Russian vaccination undergoing rolling review European Medicines Agency (EMA), Lancet evidenced safety effectiveness Russian Sputnik vaccination based Phase III trials. never thought way, damn makes total sense. Everyone know Cali continued hang friends privately time. misleading headlines removed every time. “Dozens” infections among millions vaccinated people negligible. vaccinated chances getting seriously ill needing hospitalized, let alone dying, essentially zero...this would naturally include cases long COVID.

Better contact tracing better access testing. nearly impossible get test months, communication awful. Even got test, would take 1 week get results areas.

South Korea excelled both.  never happen vaccines fully FDA approved. CDC lady scared. Come man lol Keeping people hospital first foremost. Among fully vaccinated people study, three COVID-19 infections detected.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  miss flying drink service. lol. Fucking duh. Fair enough, think numbers say 35% people natural immunity 50% vaccinated adds 67.5% factoring people got virus vaccine. Plus it’ll probably higher, maybe 60% overall population vaxxed time. variant question separate issue don’t think anyone answer yet. Less spread always better places like Africa areas billions people never high vaccination rates. Thanks, seen that. know press release? I'd like look up. charge setting policy use ""goal-blindness"" advantage. policymakers set concrete goals seem achievable, general population might willing endure restrictions longer see end sight. Reduce spread, protect adults teens cannot vaccinated (cannot, choose to), reduce potential long term Covid effects, reduce cases thus disruptions schools.

If disregard public health aspect completely, reason chicken pox. Severe cases rare happen, missing two weeks school disruptive. legislature pass new law. Also large pharmaceutical industry. hate media. Sensationalized crap. Seems like Federal supreme court rulings would helped guide guys but, guess not. Gotta say, would expected dissent person likely anti-right repair part heartland institute. Good setting aside bias ruling. Odd set credentials Supreme Court time. makes much sense public health officials likely wont say Virus particles exhaled behave lot like cigarette smoke. know possible smell someone smoking even without getting close them, example standing downwind. smell smoke means particles entered nose, virus particles puts risk getting infected. Considering Pfizer Moderna say anything preventing deaths, think people, vaccines, mostly immune. vaccines never said 100% effective adults. 90 percentage high effectiveness get severe symptoms. 

This mask wearing, post vaccine, super encouraged. immunity worked well Manaus, Brazil. Maybe Fauci recognizing variants wild card originally thought. Also sub there's article children tested showing high proportion antibodies meaning silent carriers. ~ 22% US population vaccinated. pandemics dont last mere 60 days. sometimes law date realities life.

That line thinking date. information now. mRNA vaccines nearly fully effective two weeks first shot. month ago would justified thinking that. this, vaccine passports, variants approaching round civil unrest, think I've felt hopeless depressed since...oh year ago exactly. Stuff like makes think times history people make real sacrifices world today can't even wear masks pandemic. really got soft people around here. You’ll likely included tomorrow’s numbers good human rights standpoint, think lockdowns violate several components Universal Declaration Human Rights -- freedom movement, right education, right participate cultural life one's community, right one's business arbitrarily taken away. think lockdowns ""necessary"", think human rights violation.

It also clear mask compliance objectively lower USA country. all... remember they're developing country they're behind queue vials. worst they're stuck psychopathic authoritarian Trumpian leader who's covid-denier, especially since caught &amp; recovered. individual states/townships acquiring doses administering them. total sh!tshow. good fair month ago sub arguing whether ""two months"" needed start lifting restrictions. think easy see people want wait whatever unit time goal posts moved many times honestly vaccines place much better different past. paid investment let EU try drive hard bargain came procurement.

Weighing pros/cons seems extremely obvious me. safe get vaccinated. go hospital, die. act like measurable danger fully vaccinated US, California’s useless Winter lockdown didn’t slow spread likely reason didn’t national lockdown new administration took office.

Like said, measures need people following work public another lockdown isn’t there. theory nice happens allow everyone suddenly go lives normal middle pandemic?

There lot people north america following rules. Business usual work large portion populace behaving like that. Even something basic wearing mask apparently much people.

In city, strong lockdowns restrictions, struggling keep infection rates low. reversed lockdown tomorrow i'd expect infection rates skyrocket. thing though....the heavily advertised state ended restrictions, Texas, cases still going state still restrictions, Michigan, cases going up. wonder restrictions really even anything degree inevitability virus weather dependent. haven’t able find anything variant resistant vaccine induced immunity. read paper far tell hasn’t even tested. note E484K mutation think making subreddit inaccessible effect stated intent (in protest Reddit’s hiring practices)? make determination (besides evidence ""the Reddit CEO's announcement"", correlation best)? making subreddit inaccessible tool protest?

It seems cutting user's access news/information (*especially* sub) order make (argumentatively) political stance questionable.

Why feel responsibility (as moderation team) protest, instead users themselves? see users Reddit tools/fodder leverage position Reddit team?

This opinion, perhaps ignorant one: would voted keep /r/Coronavirus subbreddit open. This.

The past tense appropriate since single one succeeded developing Covid vaccine. Pfizer vaccine without Biontech. close 0,9% compared false positive rates? saw &lt;1% articles far. Three groups people, think:

1. Right-wing people disapprove anything Democrats do.

2. Left-wing people think America always bad everything.

3. People happy get one.

Notice comes states opening people, #3 starting get satisfied. Good luck #1 #2, though. That’s nice older kids maybe, impractical things like daycares. 3 year olds pretty good masks mostly playing outside half Britons vaccinated, right? That's amazing.

The latest data ... think Michigan today ... show largest increase hospitalizations among people 50s. concerned \*only\* death rates. That's I'm saying.

But even death rates mattered, Brazil sees 3x increase mortality rate people 20s. We're really race variants. Let’s tell they’re losing supply don’t actually take away.  thanks work healthcare follow regulations, please let lose job.  200 kids age group died Covid entire United States. parent paranoia surrounding healthy kids getting sick confusing.

Most sub filled people criticized US May way deflect. funny post Fauci children wearing masks upvotes post saying Pfizer vaccine 100% efficacy 12-15-year-olds. latter seems like much better news former. Right, meant. OP asked side effects Moderna worse Pfizer, would assume due larger dosage Pfizer Moderna. also spit PCR tests. Maybe easier route trying convince them. ones know spouting deadly flu especially kids get flu shot. hypocrites. rant deadly flu is, bit reduce spread shows really give hoot. guy mad inconsistent.

Guy needs get really best take. Germany one countries invested heavily vaccines beginning (I really wish numbers every country). Merkel decrying vaccine nationalism entire pandemic, they've followed that. since everyone else embraced vaccine nationalism really screwed over. Luckily 3 weeks me. likely sick brithday since shot pretty rad birthday present. like gonna shit anyways lol. surprised couldn’t log sub idea happening drama.

Sorry this. later learned message posted showed people using desktop reddit, mobile apps, people confused. reading another thread multiple people comments arguing states lift mask mandates IMMEDIATELY vaccine opened everyone 16+. 

And it’s like... why? Vaccine eligibility vaccine availability % population vaccinated. goal based % vaccinated makes total sense. chiming got vaccine day using tool 15 minutes. drive 90 minutes boonies. flu special ability recombine.

Why say expect dealing variants diseases, like polio, small pox, measles? Fauci double edged sword. everything good completely messes something important. Saying weeks masks nothing changing story coming bogus excuse changing story. he’s vaccination results. Like not, kind messaging fueling anti-science crowd rightfully honest. know it’s anecdotal know 30 people worst side effect I’ve heard 3 months later one still can’t smell. know 2 older people died older underlying conditions would worried know 15 blood clots reported type. compared 16 people received Pfizer UK. lot variance within Europe well, though; US well Spain, better Belgium, UK, Portugal (and course Czechia, charts); slightly worse France, Sweden, Poland; significantly worse Germany, NL, non-Swedish Nordic counties. Yep, one best friends told won’t anything indoors anyone there’s proof vaccines prevent disease transmission, even she’s vaccinated. doesn’t prevent transmission, hell here?

Yes, super basic vacc study works. really matters timeframe, size, composition groups. officially know less people without vaccine Chicago congratulations! predicted 110 million first doses end march: 


J&amp;J kind let month March. doses seem back loaded coming next week. (which TECHNICALLY part March production still) That's awesome... 7% sigmoid function goes vertical got REALLY lucky covid vaccine timing! Note mean debunked countries wrong. correct using data.

The cases distributed equally EU probably EMA comes different conclusion national health agencies. lot cases per vaccine shot Germany, Denmark Norway countries. 

So makes sense look affected countries restricting whole EU. system works intended nothing debunked ruled yet. lot us were. power tripping mod ever saw one. /r/cringe two days? refreshing Vybe website got appointment 70 minutes advance, longest 70 minutes life Ya vaccinate old people first strategy reasonable since they're likely die, since also unlikely spreaders virus, kind makes lot sense vaccinate younger people early fewer overall cases. They're probably better opening vaccination lines everyone lottery allowing old people get it. I'm doctor, take grain salt, doses problems (that know of). Young teens don’t need first place 😔 need vaccinate ten times people az break even corona 50 age group Tell Iron curtain countries. US left half Europe enslaved ""won"" WW2. told cremated grandma. There's really reason clinical trial every variant determine reasonable certainty protective. realize B1.351 adjustments spike protein cause concern, lab tests show antibody levels typical adult still high enough neutralizing B1.351 spike. 

Will less effective? Sure, probably relative percentage JnJ less effective versus original strain. something like 85-90% protective rather 95%. 

Again, data would great, kind pointless even discuss without theoretical cause action would discriminate otherwise identical antibodies Pfizer Moderna JnJ.

The fact JnJ still effective real world gives us even confidence Pfizer Moderna also effective strain.  U.S. becoming common sub. I'm seeing lot comments removed fit someones agenda. live Brazil biggest fear. became breeding pool variants knows might come next.

Is South African variant slightly mutated example convergent evolution among virus species? Poland heard unfortunately... EU's strategy make much sense even then. real expensive lockdowns, weeks get testing order like US states did, long time COVID nearly eliminated. eliminate it, point?

We know covid seasonal then, much surprise. fall came low level cases started growing everywhere, without population immunity summer poor strategy even B.1.1.7. sound pretty selfish prioritizing wants everyone else's. scientists CDC gonna tell policy makers CDC vaccinated people pose essentially risk therefore resume normal activities?

The issue definition normal guarantee fully vaccinated people going back normalcy private: seeing friends family, going vacations, going general. fact fully vaccinated people can't fully resume many ""normal"" activities many things right hampered fact mitigation efforts focused unvaccinated order continue preventing surges. think right. Hope best prepare emotionally bad news...The bottom line US vaccinating 16-21 million people week thanks President Biden taking virus seriously. theory, hypothetical story, madeup antidote. hope so, miss Canadian friends.   told guy. media told anal swabs accurate way diagnose Covid, would 2nd line. 😂 Possibly keep mind increases chance negative vaccine side effects US gets Pfizer doses Michigan. page 52 talking Pfizer link? husband felt symptoms 18 hours later knocked 12 hours. Glad post removed (utterly) misleading. Yes. won’t even meet outside situation keep parroting points even presented data CDC. stupid enough telegraphed intentions bunch military officials stepping administration making clear go fuck right off.

I love see Given US supply constrained months now, blows mind week's worth production would literally overwhelm another country's ability administer vaccine.

3 million doses/day (just Pfizer Moderna) likely Canada Mexico administer (at least starting off) would imagine start seeing doses go countries. CDC claims fully vaccinated people visit fully vaccinated people indoors without wearing masks physical distancing. first shot Pfizer fine. feel needle all, sore arm days.

My second shot Pfizer doozy. fever 24 hours generally felt like shit two days. article say opposite claim does? applicable people 17-19 range? actually works amazingly straight forward

There shocking amount people outright deny ""calories vs calories out"" weight loss. stunning amount excuses parrot, fat people capable defying laws thermodynamics. Anyways, lost 40 pounds COVID happened gained 38 back. 

I've lost 135 total. Covid... I've managed barely keep off. I've made zero progress year, also gained back. depressing knowing I'm trying really getting anywhere, trying keep head up.

You keep head to. done once, again. :) poor dear. Missed whole year life this. time life 14/15. Bummer. Got first Pfizer yesterday evening today it’s kind kicking ass, anyone else experience this? Even compare got it, already 10 times deadly. infects people faster, too. Bill Maher anti-vaxxer.

Going office use computer outdated idea. lot younger children refuse wear one simply children. punished that. parent's discretion whether child needs mask. suspect quietly get vaccine except much smaller hardcore group a-symptomatic? Maybe vaccine keeping reaction non-existent minimal. What? Wot? fuckin serious? astrazeneca think learned EU debacle supply chains production can't suddenly stood month. Manufacturing complicated. Manufacturing pharmaceuticals even complicated. top that, manufacturing biologics order magnitude complicated.

The Trump administration good job securing supply chains, getting production ramped up, signing contracts get first doses. UK well. EU others late game flying blind even last month. Fauci never said lock kids 2 years lol. said wear masks social gatherings. putting mask?

Seems fine past year.  yeah lil dude child too. feel bad cooped super stressed parents. 

at least house (very small- house!) now. first 6 months pandemic apartment. lord mercy- NIGHTMARE. reason fly 737 max, even thought chance dying low...

We era provaxxers.

For years, made fun anti-vaxx era trusting authorities.

Now authorities say one vaccine (out multiple vaccines) seem safe.

The provaxxers going insane. minds, vaccines must work .... Lmao 

Now seeing wave provaxxers trust authorities. Strange didn’t mention Coumo article Florida, he’s resident elected official Florida, bearing happens *FLORIDA*. wonder next years covid season number wise going butt vaccine hesitant cap next fall. Covid bad last year, really wonder range comparison flu oscillates 10-60k. shit.

I'm also assuming knows better do. He's lot fucking longer have. Fauci anti science? I'm sorry, science. He's one debunking it. ""No, that's stupid, that. course that. Please that, can, can't, this."" He's sane voice.

Everyone's tired virus, Fauci idiot? WTF? 

OF COURSE kids wear masks get vaccinated. common sense thing imagine. point majority adults vaccinated. Kids get vaccine certain age something. forgot part comments Reddit Glass people saying CDC Director Wazlogoyoz full shit know talking about.  Exactly. medical expert considering mental/developmental risks well. 2.5 year old wear mask...so I'm supposed keep away kids vaccine approved god knows when? Give break nonsense.  Unfortunately lawyer can't much at-will state.   Follow money varies state. NC gotten lot better, especially since state got organized we're less dependent crap shoot pharmacies. It’s crazy easy seems get vaccine appointment rural/red areas urban/blue areas still weeks long waiting lists Last year trying blame lot deaths pneumonia. According CDC, far year, Florida 1,762 deaths #COVID 5,185 Average pneumonia deaths Florida 2013-2018 time period Probably coincidence, yeah?

[From tweet May 27, quoted [Tampa Bay Times article Florida manipulating would wrong fudge numbers bit like 20 people thousands upon thousands. Yep. I’ve teaching person almost 20 years, besides wouldn’t let obvious reasons, rarely got sick first couple years sick lot. Maybe strep couple times (brutal) mild cold year. immune system primed. It’s frustrating, painfully obvious year now. Mask guidance updated appropriate time. could least shifted towards kf94 kn95 masks summer. N95s available since summer shelves Walmart lowes. ""Everyone keep miserable. Make sure kid's mental health suffers much next year."" make here. depend foreign supply. TBF Australia started AZ rollout last week delayed one state due torrential rain causing wide spread flooding. Also federal government crap job distributing vaccines states.

Get ready obsessive sanitation theater never go away way obsessive security theater never went away 9/11. mean - isn’t living people general make likely? That’s poorer areas dense cities way cases. Pfizer mass production thing lot longer.  Moderna getting international production line going, they've running 1 production line entire global supply (outside US) remaining 2 slated get online soon.

Remember, this, Moderna mRNA research firm (though world leading firm, likely key reason we've seen quick advancements tech) point run many trials never gotten anything approved/mass production stage. actually pretty impressive quick theyve able get production going. Fellow NBer! hope get something soon. 90%. immune. 10% still become infected spread others. Yeah, 38 seems remarkably low state lets people hug children. I'd bet least 39 40. NYT article Jan. Vanity Fair article today. whole point say undercounting/underreporting. Yeah parents know assholes can’t help it. I'd argue they're Oh god! serious? kids awkward sods. like phase they'll wear cinderella dress. go worth battle get wear something different. Yep, friend misfortune working unmasked young kids daycare. One kid tested positive week. people happy people getting theirs. bizarre.  14 percent increase hospitalization Oh cancel game. already forced one team forfeit tournament positives (VCU). mean, agree that’s be. 

But let’s real, doctors advising pregnant women take it. They’re saying it’s good babies. hasn’t tested pregnant women. isn’t even fully approved general, it’s pushed every second every day. 

But also disagree COVID basically zero effect kids, even put kids trials risk long term problems. 

Fauci saying trials kids could take 6 months. even testing it?? It’s not, they’re testing efficacy virus can’t even isolate pretending “it’s safe”, denying SAE drug lol feel like state pretty well rollout, I’d part 68% Children 1 year counting social educational regression, damage already done. Find parent elementary school aged kids believes kids actually get quality education virtually. best take ive seen unsocialized freaks time goes on. kids need see faces. Big surprise. covid rock bottom risk young people. brain never connected dots might reason halted vaccinations younger people AZ jab?  would imagine room could sanitized variable frequency sounds people enter it. Isn’t kind like saying “Humans happier eating going hungry”? 'may have' ... LMAO year even think that's limited conspiracy sites. MSM peddling doom gloom like drug, we're heavy users. Get ready bunch comments bragging child fine wrong national vaccine passport .. go ahead.. I'm reading pleasure asurprise time : let's see: mask? ok. pandemic? good. what's right thing do? blame people reporting idiotic behavior. masks pandemic? Seriously? think Fauci's words vacuum dangerous. think way say, ""Listen experts!"" actually mean, ""Ignore experts except epidemiologists,"" Fauci's words become dangerous.

In ideal world, leaders would listen Fauci, child psychologists, relevant experts think do, make weighted decision based that. practice, leaders listen Fauci ignoring everyone else.

Telling parents make kids wear masks isolate 2022 dangerous children COVID. people listen Fauci anyway, he's ""expert."" According CDC stop wearing masks vaccinated unvaccinated people small groups data suggests mRNA vaccines stop means, impossible, _highly_ unlikely could spread (hence CDC guidance masks indoors unvaccinated people).

There's reason keep wearing mask vaccinated, one, stop wearing mask, except required law get second dose waited full protection. Canada also suspended vaccine I'm parent, feel like isolating child children *horrible* mental development.  It’s going impossible people still getting sick.  Moderna recipient. First dose, arm sore next day, days. girlfriend pain bump. neighbor, Covid months prior, felt like again. 

For second dose, low grade fever overall weather, hangoverish feeling hours 12-36.  girlfriend. Neighbor felt like Covid again. Given vaccines approved emergency use, long vaccines available? I’m curious, I’m worried missing plan getting one can. Yeah read abstract confused. say anything preventing vaccinated people spreading virus. amount people upvote something blindly staggering. 
I agree poster CDC want create incentive lie releasing info, probably case someones chance spreading covid way vaccinated. article linked says. Canada then? They’ve suspended vaccine well. Ireland? dependent upon kid entirely. nothing obedient well listen. 

Can little one wear mask without hating it? That's all. 

Mine cried socks certain texture three like dreamed she'd wear mask back then. good it... Ten years later lol. 

No one anything wrong kid wear mask. whole thread stupid. ""WELL SUN SHINES BRIGHTER FAMILY'S ASSHOLES ASSHOLE SUN SHINING COMPETITION!' 

I hate shit. Parents suck. 

I one. Hope good day! :) 5 minutes? it? lol...my 2.5 year old wears 20 seconds. people scrutinize maskless kids/toddlers, kids understand. would wear mask you’re fully vaccinated? That’s silly I’ve agreed followed everything Fauci said point. understand safety aspect kids cant even get vaccine yet social development severely impacted year already lost. source this? thought Jonathan Van Tam said half vaccine doses given far AZ press conference. I'm saying bad thing (although risky move paid off), numbers directly comparable nations

But yeah I'm criticising - I'm British, second vaccine last weekend, 10 adults direct family, 8 least one vaccine Who's idiot now! worry much. UK spaced Pfizer vaccines 3 months. get first shot tomorrow. NYT Vaccine Tracker: 
EFFICACY: 80.6%
DOSE: 2 doses, 4 weeks apart 
 
What makes better rest? mean, I'm vaccines, one could end helping big chunk world I'm happy out. wonder makes better opinion? want numbers many people went Florida, got Covid came home. know personally.  way shouldn’t remain locked people willingly refuse get vaccinated. Time move on.  overwhelmingly vaccination. *Only* 7% UK infection. Yet “renowned” epidemiologist view, founded research, counter fauci people call heretic. point vaccines matter? school employees including teachers given opportunity get fully vaccinated April 12th target start date along, hesitancy 4 hours week?  told local school board unless lying parents, teachers vaccinated opportunity so. 

I understand planning logistics difficult CDC protocols isn’t like days figure out. kids school since March 20th last year 388 days March 20th 2020 April 12th 2021 figure out. done study Poland. would plenty infections placebo group. According persons involved infected many people.

It links video German cant understand.

[here’s German video mayor discussing 2 million day sounds like pretty good surge me. basis

Uhhh.... fucking pandemic?? family, friends neighbors nurses. March April last year busy summer last year closed special covid wards area (DC metro) enough serious cases. nurses know switched contract tracing fielding phone calls, indicating things far less serious. Cases never really picked back first surge. Every time tried conservatives scream mu freedoms. Honestly good start would stopping farm subsidies, corn farmers grow much #2corn literally pay grow Tax money agree you. Wisconsin barely followed mask mandate. Corporations step enforce rules. measures draconian masks certainly followed Wisconsin.  Yup. easy zero cases test all. get saying now. seemed like meant vaccinated over. Overall yes post agree we're page then, cool. Thank also willing discuss apologize saying seemed like read article correctly, bad. anecdotally, friend drank wine first dose really wicked hangover. Funny, months I’ve heard several two bit conmen GQP saying nonsense. mean people still free pretty much anything long wear mask distance people. It’s like military streets enforcing curfew. hyperbole best. assumed nurse can’t tell 100 percent said thousand times vaccines make immune. Faucci said got second Moderna shot. Didn’t notice first one, noticed actual vaccine cloudy white. Anybody else notice this? thought lmao. Every vaccine I’ve ever clear like water. Feels great though 💪🏻 SARS 1 easily spread eradicated containment. studying long term effects survivors. neither minuscule, way rare among survived. Short answer U.S.: No.

First There's LOT misinformation way COVID deaths reported calculated.For example, insurers payers automatically pay providers patients diagnosed COVID. care plan costs approved higher hospitals clinics treating patients actually deliver services order bill them, fraudulent billing continues illegal. also assure insurers every intention paying fraudulent services diagnosis programs, IA specialists nothing day sniff out. Cause death documented COVID also poses significant financial advantage hospitals insurers (with exception minor subsidies often offset increased cost care).

Second, U.S. cause death vs contribution complication largely based perception mortality risk prior diagnosed. person early congestive heart failure, great 5 year prognosis prior COVID diagnosis heart condition markedly reduced period symptomatic, died within 28 days heart attack, medically probable COVID caused death. standard causality framed terms likelihood probability based upon rational review pre-diagnosis condition post-diagnosis condition.

More Likely - notably greater likelihood 50%. legal purposes means definitively causal.

At Least Likely - equally likely. I.e. slightly greater 50%. generally treated causal.

Not Likely Due - less likely causal causal.

Not Due - definitively related.

For point comparison lets use unusually common cause death: Drowning. person epileptic seizure swimming alone, cause death? No-one going debate epilepsy cause death, ""more likely not"" circumstances would episode resulted death individual. Drowning cause death.

Let's go back early congestive heart patient. Pre-diagnosis, outlook good: metabolic testing good, blood pressure managed, started exercise program. got hit COVID bedridden ten days, worse hospitalized. convalescence started experiencing arrhythmias diminished peripheral circulation died. reasonable physician, coroner medical examiner would indicate congestive heart failure cause death case ""more likely not"" patient would continue maintain improve condition suffered disease symptoms.

Third, U.S. Flu deaths calculated reported way terms causality contribution, including period post diagnosis deaths would considered caused influenza. [Frequently Asked Questions Estimated Flu Burden | theatres us big electric lounge chairs reserved seating. near many people used be. started going back movies seats Covid hit. Give homeless? enjoy covid indication non-EEA cases are? wonder many UK.   eat donuts. subreddit turn hard right? That’s one hunnit, youths. loss traffic got Reddit’s attention.

Because sounds like someone wanting excuse go dinner.

In two months vaccine readily available, going hard fast shift overwhelming majority population. case contraceptive pills choice risk getting pregnant risk suffering side effect. risk affects individual taking pill.

In case vaccines two factors play.

1: risk *yourself* taking vaccine, vs
2: risk *other people* taking vaccine

Anyone saying obvious vaccinate people particular vaccine (the AZ vaccine specifically) regardless side effects saying completely OK sacrifice random subgroup people order save people random subgroup people. Ie trolley problem. people always come shit like this?

You say argument someone like shut down. really much higher Would random blood clot infected Covid counted death Covid (Heart attack, brain clots, …)? AZ one shitty vaccine everyone afraid off? even banned country. countries world including Israel Canada would suffer. Unlike US abandon allies leave dependent Russia China. Oh boy go means obesity way additional risk factor hospitalization, would expect make ~74% hospitalizations, since proportion population make up. thing is, around people told - are/will completely immune absolutely cannot catch spread Covid fully vaccinated ""waiting"" period. crazy. Even CDC's website confusing/vague it, people reading/understanding fully immune. 


I tried explain 100%, employer referred link/FAQ reads, "" COVID-19 vaccination protect getting sick COVID-19?"" answer ""Yes."" answer misleading, quite likely protected, 100%. employer says ""Yes"" means 100%, absolute see media seems misleading. flew Spirit 2 weeks ago nobody assigned middle seats. bot automatic translation link. It’s first comment. overlooked many times copy-pasted Google translate unnecessarily. also fda approved basically number general population. Context counts first study tracked spread vaccinated people Astrazeneca lol.  won’t anything worry you’re vaccinated nobody kids come contact anything worry person vaccinated. Nothing worry about, carry on. Avoid reposting information. people choose it. Covid common certain cultures, whether air pollution viruses sure.

I agree stretch governments require certain point though.  Sounds like net positive then?  mean exactly? it’s factor hospitalization also hospitalization? would first ask percentage Americans obese, exactly considered obese? saying can’t stand lose weight... def obesity problem. 

But I’ve seen BMI charts they’re little ridiculous. According US CDC, persons involved infected many people.

What wrote true. vaccine provide immunity prevent spread 1) right away, needs weeks 2) work everyone (a **very** small percentage immunity all), 3) might perfect (some low percentage might get infectious get mild symptoms contact, especially larger loads virus). It’s probability. cases, probable. know started 69.420% makes laugh every time. We've never moved fast virus cure before. purely extra cautious trial data continues roll in. question moderna vs pfizer dose 1 vs dose 2. got major health initiative regarding obesity. can’t look way.
I looked programs NYC research hospitals seem want push people surgery. wasn’t exhaustive means.

NYC free quitting smoking program (it might state) nothing obesity free program. Yup. It’s crazy seeing change January/February last year honestly friends medical field, unfortunately told esp early TONS sick elderly death bed cancer patients listed covid deaths, even car accident victim listed covid death. 

My argument simply dont believe numbers reported. keep track historical data? keep spreadsheet updates per day something? I’ve tried looking haven’t found online resource tracking rate distribution day. course risk factor, also, [**~74% adults overall obese You’re correct - there’s lot filings process validation work needs done commercial use. science formulation, however, set won’t change without FDA needing notified  Huge amounts vaccine scepticism, France/EU finishing vaccinations months rest developed world, Macron danger losing Le Pen result arrogance, worry. know wrong, even can't admit it. Lol thinking DM better S*n got second shot Pfizer. already super relived first shot, I'm ready party, lol. Bracing reaction tomorrow though. I'd never imagined fully vaccinated end March asked couple months ago. 

My parents got second doses moderna couple days ago father biggest reaction far. fever 101.8 headaches, seems getting worst OK. Expect cases rise two weeks, thing happened Texas lifted mask mandate prematurely 70% sure. strategy certainly drawbacks misinforming creating covid fatigue others say screw I’m done this. 

It would nice if:

1. Everyone would follow rules vaccine easily available plus weeks second doses 
2. would honest tell everyone actually going soon reasonable timeline many people getting vaccinated soon possible end it. also, 102, mild symptoms 2 folks hospitalized (who 80 years old underlying health problems). Two million. Arm sore 3 hours later. Flu like symptoms kicked 12 hours. covid previously, experience could different yours. dumbest thing dawned even year, still take months (or another year two) start coming around Illnesses fatalities important cases. 80-90% fatalities concentrated 15-20% population, 70-80% vaccinated, severe outcomes greatly decreased. words. case today lot different case year ago. 16+ starting next monday Michigan. too!! son also!

I'll Group B.

Let's also even contemplate ""new opt-in-masking normal"" unless we've got universal national sick leave U.S. Without it, exact script play gazillions times, radar white collar intelligentsia:

""Boss, can't come tonight, I'm sick.""  
""Bull! wear mask suck up!"" long ICUs hold it

Only short step 'as long mortuaries/crematoria hold it'. ICU obviously tip ice-berg illness long term effects. Furthermore, exponential spread, hard 'just enough' ICU low risk severely ill

Well sadly newer information suggests pupils may risk thought (see recent TWiVs).

As ever, correct target cases. Everything else follows metric. Pfizer: ""That's love teens. keep getting older, stay age."" know places testing variant boosters think (at least US ones) testing extra dose vaccine besides J&amp;J. said last month too. would wear mask vaccinated though?

In case clear, large study done recently showed contract transmit vaccinated (saw Rachel Maddow show Monday)

So continuing wear mask sorts nonsensical sends bad message   go again... going change anything. Meanwhile, US ""left garage"" December too, look we're doing. fuckers north supposed hold line. don’t like Michigan know I'm glad subreddit back control. think bad idea blackout subreddit due reddit drama. disagree reddit situation. However subreddit supposed aggregate Covid news seems like poor decision blackout information pandemic. case hours, time blackout know long going last.

A sticked mod message support protest would gotten point across. Florida, Texas, Wisconsin.

Are states never visit move to? set numbers? Moderna made big promisses nobody pissed them. Moderna Astra new producing vaccines Moderna seems keep promisses better. Moderna newer company, fewer employees far less stoch value. warn week deliveries start wanted could asked help EU memberstates understerd Astra tbh. exactly courts supposed do. Force government adhere laws ostensibly follow. Without that, entire system falls apart. 3 Cs? wonder it’s discrepancy ‘delivered’ means since J&amp;J said released like 11 million think. Perhaps they’re transit. literally nothing wrong comment deleted. Completely propos, completely on-topic, even fully agree comment. 

Very problematic comment removed. say moderator myself, again, someone fully agree comment. No. worse bunch anti masking conspiracists following overlords wishes. think that's appropriate characterization articles.

The NY Times saying masks help allergies, hardly seems worthy article. something intuitively understand many allergy sufferers used pandemic. N95s closet pandemic hit. guess might ring bell somebody.

The NPR article observation masking isolation symptomatic reduced illnesses, acknowledges permanent masking sustainable schools really possible health care setting, might even happen there.

Once everyone particular setting ample opportunity vaccinated, one's going mandating masks anymore. obvious example SCOTUS differing executive branch time emergency. wrong decision invalidate legal reasoning SCOTUS allowed executive branch perform would considered overreach normal times. Yeah bit. Sore throat gotten better still cough least one shot mean. FDA links handy great summary least trials, side effects especially severe side effects common Moderna vaccine.""

In case incredible vaccines side effects! got Pfizer would taken Moderna could received quicker. Y’all said 3 weeks ago watched Macron's speech.

-Next week, kids home schooled

-2 weeks following spring vacations france (where usually staggered 3 regions- Paris means week early)

-After kids 12 go back school, others stay home schooling Lol, feel bad. I’m sorry. don’t necessarily miss flying, miss arriving destination. handful worrying

Math uses numbers reason. ""A handful"" anything want be. Personally, global pandemic like one we're going now, lowest number I'd call ""a handful"" one thousand. Unfortunately, still kind national mandatory paid sick leave laws US. would thought pick better example, perhaps something actually good consequence expanded executive authority rather something that's black mark American history. gives hope honest thanks.

Regarding religious exemptions reason schools can't require it... that's bit tricky.

There's whole procedure involved. ends people actually qualify really matter grand scheme things. suspect 'rona vaccines said done. know religions truly limits vaccines, religions object tend schools/colleges draw folks what, 1% something qualify... what, outlier right? thing get covid test... forget... colds still exist ;) Ok. :) Awesome! hope little dude excels. guess depends country. Norway 65-75 lot municipalities already. April things go much faster regardless country. Norway expects give everyone second dose 1st week July - clearly situation improve three next months. always knew vaccines 100% effective, see news high prescribing pregabalin long term covid use suitable medicines medicinal cannabis, oh wait forgot pill pushers :) deliver vaccines asap reason use it. Anything speed vaccinations knew early people, lifestyles, better outcomes. long vaccines. Yet, chose promote healthy living habits. daily walk sun fresh air would made world difference. Instead said lock inside. they’re worried one million blood clotting issues ban things like birth control cause clotting much higher rates.

I get they’re due diligence unprecedented time vaccines, man. Might well throw AZ vaccines trash one going trust it. That's right, time countries (comparatively) large incidences particular side effect reported effect, vaccines given old people yet.

(Now, countries *only* give old people.) hope kids get covid shot annual flu shot come fall. happened old mods? NL too. summer months actually good infection rates, people often outside generally people's immune systems stronger due warmer weather. predicted start covid would second wave weather would get colder autum/winter, right.

Healthy fact United States top country (besides Israel) make population higher fully immune population countries technically faster uk (granted longer time period, still) Volunteering daily vote...

MI hospitalizations truly exponential now, surprise. Deaths trending upwards see signs acceleration next week delayed hospitalization conversion ratios hold. Given vaccines prevent severe illness reason think convert otherwise hospital rate would much lower.

Other states still rising sharply. Happy see initial list, still significant amount u.s. whole 20% infections 14 day.

A wave likely, though assured.

Wear mask distance much possible. get vaccine it, worry taking someone else's shot. point need vaccines arms trouble spot resolves quickly possible future growth stymied. probably vaccines press numbers immediate future. Dec 2020, 172 2 million children died due covid. (I know lot complications result death, left lasting effects) far death rate vaccine adults 2700 ish 145 million last time checked. personally know 1 person died within 24 hrs vaccine. 3 people area died within 24 hours vaccinated. people 65+. 

That said, im giving children vaccine short period risk lives, feel better chance defeating covid. said, willing risk child's life possibly protect yours. know % numbers favor vaccinated, however figure chances getting add chances dying it, hard me. take vaccine 4 2 yr old does, chance life protect them. feel risk complication vaccine complication covid. 

I usually vaccine advocate, know death toll every vaccine. chance trust vaccines yet. 

Go ahead downvote me. Moderna/BioNTech, Pfizer, AZ, JnJ there's staggering amount doses produced effective vaccines.

Throw vaccines mentioned, plus ones trials look promising (eg. Novavax) likely second half 2021 going logistics getting people countries less developed infrastructure vaccinated, anyone US/Europe/East Asia, Australia/NZ etc. wants vaccine able get one. Can’t go away already. 

It’s never going good enough guy, lot scientists. got vaccine mask follow rules wear mask. time, 2-3 months expect able live life without scientists moving goalposts doomsday.

Aren’t people say God? everything say 100% true let’s get rid religion  I'm thankful daycare still open kid. 2.5 started missed beat Fucking.....duh? don’t time refute spin, note points .

You commented 3% death rate didn’t happen even though predicted. Dude, please. worst case scenario projections would happen restrictions lockdowns. weren’t absolutes. made entirely clear. Sheeeesh.

I also appreciate trucking “it kills old sick” argument makes OK.

I sympathize 2020 hellish year personally. suffered. lockdowns kept working home limiting activities tools stopped much higher death count happening.

When look way, lockdown sacrifices helped others live. cool that. friend Covid Positive vaccine!

My friend home health physical therapist. Covid guy means sees Covid positive patients. fully vaccinated (2 doses) January.


He trip week work required take Covid test. got tested today. boys soccer practice went get dinner drinks local restaurant. got call toward end night nurse informed Covid positive. 


How even happen? 


I got first dose 2 weeks ago friend showing symptoms. odds gave Covid? would curious women birth control. One side effects hormonal birth control increased risk blood clots. mean, even anecdotally, flu sickest I’ve ever seen kids. think missing point. ethnicity instead factors like access healthcare, poverty, education, cultural, etc. Rates obesity diseases also higher populations. perfectly healthy black person risk perfectly healthy white person.

I’m sorry, Fauci wrong this. Covid simply big risk children. say mom two. kids continue go school get together socially kids.

Why? fuck anything? vaccines? start month?  article: ""They found vibrations 25 100 megahertz triggered virus’ shell spikes collapse start rupture within fraction millisecond. effect seen simulations virus air water.""

So real. vaccine made do. Brilliant news. presume it’s don’t get vaccine that’s good chance die covid. 60s higher risk dying covid. 
This isn’t zero sums game, stop delay vaccines blood clots (which statically line number people general pop get blood clots, AZ never claimed vaccine made immoral. wonder many people hit car getting AZ...?), people die covid. hopefully left cancer causing ingredient talc baby powder! know we'd expect anything less man told us masks work start this, frank. hero worship Fauci incredibly moronic. Read studies draw conclusion, people. government's handling pandemic ways worse actual disease sometimes. Same. got ass handed Moderna \#2. Call doctor feel like something really wrong, better safe sorry, fine. :) user stating choice, obviously consideration. distributed country post moot.

All I'm saying nonsensical take vaccine rock bottom risks blood clot. Goddamnit Roseville! OH here. There's much genuinely makes happy live Ohio, vaccine distribution commendable. look every vaccine issue history here: Children infected live polio got sick within weeks standard polio incubation period.

1976: swine flu vaccine caused Guillain-Barré Syndrome small number people. GBS incubation period 10-14 days vaccination.

1998: rotavirus vaccine caused bowel obstruction infants, immediate medical emergency. I'm entirely sure long took bowel obstruct, still infants did.

2009: H1N1 vaccine caused narcolepsy hundred people, happening one two months vaccination. far serious incident recent history.

That's really it. (The CDC page lists incidents actually hurt anyone.) believe answer definitively no, unless 1-2 months long enough qualify long term. studies current vaccines continue watch first people took around eight months ago, issues detected far. made photons? mean ""you guys""? playing team game here? think 100 vaccine smart move, sure hell ""ambitious goal"". smart policy promise deliver. 

Also, personally overall pleased vaccine distribution US, sure think be, casting aspersions. 

Also, reply /u/rhino369 turned slight criticism biden insinuation support trump, do. Well, woman barely muscle there, think I'm going go ham lateral raises getting vaccine case. got shot 9am yesterday side effects kicked around 10pm evening. Still feeling today, really bad solid 9-11 hours first kicked in. feel tired bit back pain. Well think worth that's absolutely right. friends family seen regularly whole time, several us got covid, nothing cataclysmic happened. Personally there's way virus like would make miss whole year social interaction. sounds like ""personal responsibility"" thing conservatives love much me. sorry, get response. dense person, something missing explanation. please elaborate find worthwhile? Woooooosh!  Stopping transmission imprecise language anyway. Vaccines significantly reduce ability get infected detectable level thus ability transmit virus. Speaking strictly data would definitely seem though leadership seriously underestimated need endgame plan. initial goal 100M vaccinations updated 100% 200M. alone tells that, least, good grasp ending quickly. I'll leave others argue blame, sick game, desperately NEED clear, comprehensive plan comes next. Well kidding. point say “don’t carry virus get sick” little misleading one hand, that’s pretty awesome. hand, stick arm lol. Yeah, don’t think antivaxxers going successful bid become protected class. Every protected class harmless aspect someone’s identity (black, woman, Jewish, gay, whatever). 

Spreading infectious airborne disease completely different thing. shut restaurants cook comes hepatitis. doesn’t get just.. spread hep. 😂 Keep mind total number doses delivered EU last 4 month.

The EU population 447 Million people. guess comes definition ""getting sick"". thinking ""testing positive"", CDC director thinking ""showing substantial symptoms infection"". definitions valid. horrifying. even anything people countries, like US, slow massacre? hard time wrapping head around recalls. Especially one like this, given side effect common medication. definitely say benefit outweighs risk.  time really two weeks lockdowns. Excitement information, authorities counting deaths straightforward way, example see UK, deaths counted as:

“Deaths reason within 28 days positive UK gov site: ""Deaths within 28 days positive January year came told everyone recalibrate PCR tests many false positives... means lot things, example, last year's numbers see, authorities say cases deaths that, like videogame score clear-cut objective, numbers bs formula behind. Garbage gargabe Depends call surge, several states look like cases ramping pretty quickly. Legitimately interested perception. 

How much worse think would date zero mitigation? love see should. extremely densely populated city, 1st wave devastating vast majority spread happening private gatherings masks probably going worn, regardless mandate not. think lockdowns genuinely effective measure, encourage look stats overdoses, depression, overall health. Lockdowns work people follow them, clear people going follow longer, even EU. Cases crazy despite lockdowns much stricter. 

Asking young healthy people wear masks inside home full year bit much. public, sure, home? That's far. Someone make choice meet outside feel comfortable without mask house. 

Also think important remember lot rules implemented thought virus 3-6% death rate basically treatments therapies. absolutely insane would justify strict rules. However, IFR shown far less rules changed. host treatments (monoclonal antibodies, remdesivir, etc), rules changed. think fair say lot response overblown. Ok makes little sense. Double vaccinated school start would mean starting vaccinations June. hope that's case. Yeah know lot folks got way really fucking tiring, particularly ones following guidelines. NL curfew state can't properly police parties. everyone stay minority.

It feels like back school one dickhead pupil makes dickhead teacher give everyone detention. Let make sure understanding here.

The CDC can't trust population listen advice ""act good faith"". CDC solves lying people still important wear masks they're vaccinated, know true. public come senses trust CDC. Yeah, look states limited (or no) mask mandates. result overcrowded hospitals, lacking ventilators, freezers overflowing corpses, needless death, mayhem everywhere.

And even cases, people still wearing masks. Imagine zero masks situation. It'd bigger nightmare.

The people masks living another reality, IMO. cold hard evidence mask mandate disastrous states countries tried approach. going send conflicting messages everyone. Sure thing choose either risk vaccine risk covid risk living hermit lifestyle. risks, body scientific evidence clearly points vaccine lowest risk choice. don’t see trying accomplish comments. think cases &lt;1k mid may get take credit 8k? want people roll eyes completely tune out?

I say right now: there’s better chance NJ cases &lt;1k per day 8k mid May. Speak yourself. Requiring basic health measures participate luxuries sounds pretty great me. I'm waiting multiple lists get kids vaccine trial. following doctor CDC's advice closely anyone know. kids get placebo, test positive. I'm single data point, ya go. would love know answer too. I'm hoping Biden strategy underpromise overdeliver. Hoetez Meet Press caught end said teens likely double vaccinated start school year - August us. maybe vaccine starting June? guarantee get mild version COVID. Vaccines aren’t going prevent 100% infections prevent hospitalization death. never said would rescue economy. Lol. 

Just pointing international business travel important still valuable zoom-enabled world. Especially seen context post fully vaccinated individuals.

I go far say allowing international business travel vaccinated beneficial economy. things true.

This data suggests vaccinated individuals carry virus, in: get it, take somewhere else, transmit others. also suggests get sick: symptoms.

But sometimes vaccinated people test positive even though infectious. even hospitalized die, distinguish people would died normally conditions? experts ***have*** started conversation, ***have*** said vaccinated people relax social distancing. sure would work you, apparently appointments southwest part MI, 90 minutes policy vaccinating people state. data speaks itself. Daily cases deaths taken nosedive U.K. since start vaccine rollout. rest europe entering 3rd wave whilst U.K. loosening restrictions. 

Today example U.K. 4k cases (and U.K. tests much European countries) 43 deaths. comparisons, Italy 23k cases 476 deaths despite smaller population. Poland 32k cases 653 deaths despite half UK’s population. Even country size Czech Republic double UK’s cases deaths, despite fact Czech population smaller Greater London’s. 

Mind you, U.K. seeing insane numbers December/January (more 1000 daily deaths 60k daily cases) vaccine rollout picked pace drop even striking. 

As said, data speaks itself.  I'm jealous post made cry. 13 year old counting seconds. would put trial, none locations even remotely close us. kind blood clot. Read post.  looking excess mortality per state Mexico one state 2 weeks deaths 5X expected, anyone know happened anywhere else world? infection mild very, little viral shed.

This seems like pretty shaky inference me. know even people asymptomatic transmit virus. vaccinated symptomatic, would expect infectious unvaccinated person who's symptomatic, maybe bit less.  


If vaccinated symptoms, stay home. Yes, imagine everything we've seen last year feeling able get vaccine relay consideration general public keep safe. can't imagine go that. got downvoted stating facts article providing likely explanation happened... literally constant targeted misinformation flying around Michigan status 'swing' state (went Trump 9k votes 2016) Whitmer's 'rising star' status Democratic Party.

Put another way-that allow exposed viruses normally exposed to, created environment less harmful viruses would normally infect us give us buffer COV2 absent. so, go expose world, COV2 predominant virus around us infected with?

I know I'm probably way base. would appreciate someone could explain why. caveat I'm defending persons viewpoint want higher % vaccination start removing restrictions, lots business can't conducted virtually.

In field example, customers basically impossible rangle virtually. They'll tell problems day physically go location. call phone video conference though ""Everythings fine, leave alone I've got shit do.""

I've witnessed first hand hundreds times. understand bit German, enough translate Mayor's video.

But story says nothing person question actually spreading infecting others. says 1) showed high viral titers PCR testing; 2) infections hospital. say one infecting.

Unless translated video says otherwise, think removed sensationalized title. got first shot today. Feeling good. AFAIK AZ shown decrease asymptomatic spread. Interested see studies topic - anyone seen any? link post math? talks ratio vaccinated covid post vaccine? came group chat would REALLY love smack someone who's brat this. dumbest thing I’ve read today. lot coming next finally voted one four orders early February put back new Evers order, could immediately struck - wanted void WI eligibility $50M / month federal funding (which apparently did, moment). sure mean changing numbers, made mistake original number zeros, said would update comment, updated it.

I get point 1 90000 risk worth somewhat agree, think trivialised OP could softened statement, guess. People fixated Florida obvious reasons, nearly bad unique people want be. objective fact.

Good! mean definition could say everything discriminatory, including getting drivers license. Come on. Oh no, poor stores. Workers definitely thankful even work deadly pandemic. gives shit people? shouldering risk, willingly! passed vibe check 1% chance could die corona vaccine. choose corona  It’s like people claimed NY hit herd immunity back May. spoke soon things got crazy again. First off, first study we've seen confirming this. suspected vaccinated transmit virus, widespread studies done.

And something assumed. Salk vaccine polio, example, prevent vaccinated people transmitting, getting infected.

There's another done college campus' right essentially exact point.

Secondly, that's dangerous message send point. Even places well we're ~30-40% vaccinated. Probably lot lower parts country. CDC says ""Vaccinated people resume normal activities unvaccinated can't"" think unvaccinated people going listen? No, they're going go dinner parties friends movies everything else.

This one reason vaccine passport stuff great idea intermediary, it'll never get ground certain party insane. are...? eu wont get another 107 million, eu recieved 107 million, ie 8 million doses ~10%.. getting really ugly oh no!! aren’t perfect!! shame bound happen"
