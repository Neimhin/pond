Maybe they’ve gotten one shot something. Plus, families little kids still wearing masks not? it’s really control everyone it’s big deal help stop spread even though I’m fully vaccinated. “Yeah ivermectin wonder drug use deworm horses works great it’s cheap!”

The vaccine free. 

“Cricket noises.”  side effect don’t mind asking? like gypsy woman said would. one sided poll history  think poster means masks help stop spreading good protecting self catching it. Masks help stop mists breathing Coughing outward two seemed think trying scare kids wearing it.

They're ones scared, kids. they're lashing it. Pathetic, really, common. Utah, AZ, NV, Idaho Vaccinated never stopped lot time gets weaker mutation, except, y'know, times doesn't. extremely fast spreading virus happens whole lot chances lied to.

By you?  distance part wish would keep up. like personal space don’t need go back people breathing neck line store.   I'm vaccinated. I'm extremely unlikely spread covid even already unlikely scenario get it. response edit, looked risk calculator. race, ""white"" race. someone like me, Indian parents.

I tried both. Got 2 different numbers. 1.3% identify white 2.5% identify Asian. .9% put ""other,"" since going skin color race apparently. identify brown man. looking completely unrelated statistic. statistic matters context pandemic economic loss pandemic itself. One States going develop Epsilon Variant. sounds terrifying, let alone whatever level bonus infectious, fatal, vaccine resistant… perks get. studies supporting statement - “transmission vaccinated unvaccinated common”? especially 2nd one vaccinated transmit vaccinated.

God forbid anyone bears smallest inconvenience save lives and/or long term medical conditions. swear country full entitled babies. could EU closing border US before. really. I'm super liberal area, high vaccination rates, ONE wears masks. Sometimes I'll see employees masks on, that's it. I’m getting vaccine later today. opted get Johnson &amp; Johnson someone lot works industry goes contact lot people (especially recent mandates lifted) hunch waiting three weeks second Pfizer dose late game probably question. figured since I’m relatively low risk group decent faith immune system (haven’t gotten flu decade despite flu shot since 2011) Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine least effective enough me. line reasoning sound right making mistake mRNA vaccine? Same, nice others breathing me. much sniffle year awesome. Also ubiquitous facial recognition LA cops hospitals walmart get enjoy privacy too. Lambda variant might factor CureVacs failure quite prevalent study ( purely speculation though published specific results different variants yet ).
But rate, we‘ll switch Chinese characters end year run Greek letters. agree think ending mandates bit premature point bit extreme people US Paywalled shit. interesting areas affected taste smell. hope get peer reviewed research brain activity post covid  Regarding effectiveness vaccines, here's recent example Australia: 30 people attend party. Delta variant also attends. 24 non-vaccinated people get infected. 6 vaccinated people get infected.  Might want read closely. 90% data combined. study Israel showed Delta like 79%. still good. problem people wearing masks. issue I, vaccinated individual, mandated mask. 

This started response made someone said felt ""rude"" wear mask. argue science. argue vaccines normalization life vaccinated.

Why would roll dice anyone love matter low numbers , lottery lasting effects hope number called CDC made announcement 30% population fully vaccinated. realize Peru highest death rate 5,700 per million, almost twice much next country, Hungary, 3,100. ...so still want wear mask we’re high risk variant spreading, stay home instead? people wearing mask stopping “getting back life”? Ok… I’ve pretty hard life. sometimes appreciate actually seeing people smile. Let’s hide half faces one ever gets sick again… that’s bit extreme. Opted announce people going maskless till though? Opted ignore science favor sociology? Easy throw stones guess alternative isn’t easy understand. Masks till next summer? happens insanely likely scenario another variant comes then? Masks till summer 2023? drove Wyoming last month saw sign gas station door said “no masks allowed” won’t surprised. wearing masks taking precautions less scary way put B: vaccine effective enough keep R &lt;1.

Delta looks 80% effective preventing serious cases COVID-19, mild? Unclear, mild cases may spread unvaxxed people thought.

But likely mix B. get base covid vaccine isnt news, number breakthrough cases significant go back lockdowns mask mandates. vaccine failed point worse situation. That's neat whatever, continuing wear mask variants still popping somewhat regularly isnt hurting choose makes already solid protections given vaccines even better. So, like, care? people stayed areas roam about. /s  I’m San Diego around 50% masks. visiting Ramona like 20%. continue wear mask take precautions case. feel like people lost sight point beginning. didn’t chance eradicate covid waited longer respond. messaging “flatten curve” keep hospitalizations manageable healthcare system doesn’t collapse. half us vaccinated particularly seniors…. vaccines still protect severe illness variant.

However, drive hour neighboring counties, almost guaranteed see single mask. Well seeing risk even Delta variant low fully vaccinated hold breath kid, OP here, wear mandated like doctors offices etc. year masking done people refuse so. understand kids cant get vaccinated yet go places many kids regardless sooo... live LA agree. people vaccinated still wearing masks indoors.  Without balls uncle would auntie. It’s also bother people act like wearing 30lb shackles neck. I’m living HK near 100% compliance masks even though case average 4 day.  always going happen. sections US *never* get vaccine. point Covid run rampant communities, much like measles Amish community Ohio 2014. rest country sit around plead change minds? [Then enjoy interview Hahahaha . yeh good luck .

To clear . wear mask ! news people loose understanding statistics. read percentages it’s probably counts low. 2 cases 4 cases 100% growth. situation US good terms cases deaths. Could get worse? Yes actually I’m going enjoy summer. Measures taken won’t help much anyways. probably butthurt Americans think COVID over. Same, employees still masked anyone 40yrs old- coin toss younger ones though. Maybe missed part vaccinated people getting sick. parents spread children now, parents live. children, die. highly contagious speading rapidly, expected dominant variant fall. went 3% US cases 20% month. midwestern states, 47% cases. 

Source: hitting children young people particularly hard, fairly resistant regular covid. 

The jury still dangerous is, still pretty new. experts say worse regular covid. say it'll worse highly contagious, find vulnerable people kill them. 

Fully vaccinated people dying it, far seems like mostly elderly, though statistics that. 

There's also another new strain called Gamma that's expected similar Delta. 

I know we're tired it, think battle ain't over, folks. I'll stay masked things calm down, big deal me. weird, went Trader Joe’s day LA literally none employees wearing masks. customers were, employees Lots still wearing Houston burbs Check again. got second appointment day became eligible, website said August longest time. everyone’s eligible, recommend check again. LA here. East side. confirm this. Whenever go seems like 90%+ still masking indoors  thing everyone alive compete fight. Trying improve time emotionally draining exhausting. believe science like you’d say, you’d know guidelines always changing science never static we’re learning new shit time. That’s almost month ago, we’re learning lot delta variant  point vaccination masks reduce reproduction rate r0 virus stop exponential spread. masks vaccination important components reducing r0.

The Delta variant highly contagious exhibits higher breakthrough infection rate normal variant. therefore higher r0 normal variant.

This means order contain spread either need higher vaccination rate effective herd immunity current vaccination rate + masks reduce r0 1. 

La county happens one highest density people whilst lower vaccination rates high density areas. 

Asking people mask up(not mandate) prudent, order reduce spread. LA overall think likely ok though since enough high risk groups vaccinated probably overflow hospitals. That's almost funny.

Technically that's already illegal, always enforced say global pandemic? pandemic global dipshit. similar situation recommended wearing two masks sudden. bad idea immunocompromised live immunocompromised cannot get shot (age/health) cannot afford risk.

For healthy adults, vaccine enough. immunocompromised average age patients 60 years old , also got MRI head probably good health begin mild case 60 mild anyway. Also look many changes , put results together came conclusion .
This study reflect random sample people therefore heavily discussed . Sure, enough justify additional doses time. Public health also simple science. It’s like crowded nightclub fire, definitively safest action individual sprint nearest exit shove anyone way get there. However, safest thing group everyone move swiftly, orderly toward exits.

Some public health dealing psychology masses get best possible outcome entire population. would immunocompromised people... Ivermectin. Yes. tried sue judge threw case out. Isn’t kind selfish? push back Irish public servers 30 younger, age groups yet vaccinated. People alarmist nothing, masks literally nothing, seen endless people literally rooting covid even CDC went “the vaccines working return mostly normal life everyone, we’ve made it!”.

Blueanons getting butthurt pandemic ending tells everything need know. never public health people. permission, telling dont care do.

I feel safe vaccine, follow science dont feel danger walking around without wearing mask. Pretty simple me, im good now. Except there's reasonable evidence conclude J&amp;J 1 shot less effective 2 shot regimen delta variant. insane me. people shamed antimaskers year want shame people listen recommendations continue wearing mask indoors. Oh saying vaccines effective? that's what's said here. issue would early tell delta variant. think that’s phrase always meant, they’re called “nice.” passive part dropped, seems. maybe cared health moment could take mask, did. fine, stop pushing insecurities onto others. people listening recommendations choose safe little longer, that's fine. need shame them. grow stop acting like pentulant child. Someone choosing wear mask take away right wear mask. Yes. father newborn baby can’t vaccinated, would still love people help protect him. There's theory CDC targeting vaccine hesitant, dangling no-need-to-wear-a-mask option bribe. 

This character ""masks work"" CDC, say one thing achieve different goal. complicating factors like blood thinner needing iron, guess doctors would recommend vaccination, infection could complicated issues. 

If helps you, totally contact doctors first. Legit doctors though, like chiropractor ""natural healing"" person.

It safe breastfeeding get vaccinated, I'm sure /u/yaolilylu answer questions that. want baby it, can't stop you. change fact wearing masks crowded areas pandemic good health policy. Throw “Thank Healthcare Heroes!” sign I’m in! things done protect kids are:

1. Wear mask work job requires regular contact (I.e teaching, child care etc.)

2. kid 12-17 years old, get vaccinated ASAP. 

3. kid 12, keep indoor businesses aren’t taking precautions, don’t let go anywhere crowded, wear mask times. school online schools don’t become crowded. Children died it. Even doesn’t happen much adults still happens. don’t take kid indoor places unless go (doctor’s visits) thing masks though work wear adults get vaccinated. people anti-mask anti-vax putting kid unnecessary risk dumbass selfishness. adults refusing get vaccine (not medical reasons) would get could finally move on. stupid fucking idiot people continue stupid. got shirt says I'm fully vaccinated, Republican. Drunk decision. I'm New England--and still sure wearing publically would get punched. gets point vaccines rent effective virus won’t even able infect humans… fear? It’s common sense. Please explain spread cancer heart disease another person get back us.  excellent. thing would disagree NP pay often par RN pay less (source APRN working outpatient still don’t get paid ICU bedside 10 years ago.)

There push make RNs NPs it’s marketing scheme. lot us unhappy. Since instituted bonuses extra shifts hospital, nurses working 5-6 nights week. ppl, nice gesture smile door held open enough brighten someone’s day… thing inefficiency human human interactions… makes sound like neck bearded basement dweller. guy named Ivan McTin. don’t cases don’t report them. I'm glad permission, disagreeing you. 

Normally get vaccine like flu know nowhere near 100%, odds catching low smart washing hands such. COVID vaccine great much transmissible almost anything else, see problem anyone would taking extra minor precautions. Haha 😂 

Yeah always love “holiday meals”!!! Lmbo It’s part reason don’t resonate “just wear mask indefinitely even vaccinated, mask doesn’t stop living life”

No, doesnt, rare times socialized last year mask reminder shouldn’t socializing stayed home. state lifting mask mandate symbolic me, felt like permission finely okay things like go restaurant, see movie, hang friends/family. mask there’s always nagging feeling “we shouldn’t here”.  got email someone week two ago said still tested antibodies. Yeah, right. 3 people ""screamed"" wearing mask. it’s manufactured India. lost eight twenty-four ICU nurses January. See, mistake leaving metro.

Scratch that, mistake exiting 20 minute area around Twin Cities. Nothing racism anti-vaxers point on. school closing thing WAY stated. 60 percent teachers teaching person fall 2020. I’m debating point, opening schools became political talking point divorced reality. Also, Denmark [has ability put doses use quickly. mild Low trust vaccines, authorities shortages.

Low trust ranges generic antivaxx, 5G loony stuff low trust general. ""World first vaccine"" stunt failed everywhere including Russia. News mentioning kinds faults western vaccines (e.g. AZ blood clots) help too. 

Very random anti-covid measures supposedly force close things like gyms yet ban religious events. ""Lockdowns"" people still work. Inconsistent actions authorities make people think kind twisted nonsense.

""None friends sick"", ""I cold week, probably Covid, I'm safe"" wishful thinking too.

There also three vaccines limited supply. Sputnik abundant always enough. EpiVacCorona (peptide vaccine) started rolling somewhere around May low stock unclear effective is. Covivac (inactivated) appeared even later least available. 

You take grain salt since subjective perception situation. Oof I'm New England, hey, can't win all. I've never actually worked hospital. spent years working EMS, shifts singles 8 hours, doubles 16, 24 hr shifts.. usually. work outpatient medical office large health network inpatient/outpatient work. I'm mostly basing dad, worked lab hospitals past 30 years, usually 3rd shift. Sometimes Thanksgiving gets side potato chips turkey sandwich. like coroonavirus people want kind doomsday virus. Hey vaccine got bad, glad real thing Well original comment removed idea even talking anyway. someone immunocompromised higher risk literally every disease well? find narrowest subgroup people worry about? 

Also I'm tired antibodies crap. Antibodies one component immune system that's anyone focuses on. B cells remember years, yes even prior infection. UK 48.6% vaccinated currently exponential growth. Again. CDC needs anthropologists team helping draft guidelines recommendations. expert human behaviors, would avoided “masks won’t keep safe” debacle early weeks pandemic. They’re usually pretty low uptake general. heard nurses looking work. Right -- said vaccines arent 100%, that's responding to. want dont care Netherlands allows negative PCR instead fully vaccinated, seems pretty reasonable time younger folks getting shot Travelers wouldn’t exist hospitals treated nurses decent! Dude, wore mask to, got vaccinated. followed rules, everything to. Time move forward life.  many cases traveling agency classifies jobs. instance rural ER’s nurses make 35 dollars hour expected handle ever walks in. ER contracts travelers get form expressly writing specific duties. 

Need nurse manage vent: that’s ICU certified nurse 
Need nurse help chest tube: that’s trauma nurse. 

So rural places end needing nurses qualified everything pay 90 dollars hour. 

Now nurses may end things. can. that’s pays. 

As ER physician handle vents, central lines, ICU etc. flex ICU, ER, inpatient clinic. depends Acute needs are. Whereas family practice physician may able clinic inpatient medicine. Imagine J&amp;J hadn’t messed batches. would meant millions would vaccinated right South Africa probably would saved thousands lives. does, still possible contract spread even vaccinated. fine, reduced load transmission still mess unvaccinated, immunocompromised person. 

But we're talking best ways protect cannot get vaccinated, vaccinating everyone would 1000x efficient already vaccinated people wear masks again. hope right. I’m waiting hear doctors say. Historically Russians don’t trust government, lots people getting info WhatsApp, telegram, etc. Also Russia tooting it’s horn well pandemic people stopped wearing masks social distancing opened everything back despite low vaccination rates.

Illinois 50% vaccinated one wears mask anymore governors mandate lifted. half adult people, additionally kids 12, wearing masks unvaccinated. Funny thing is, hardly cases zero deaths.  Yeah, totally selfish follow rules. Current rules you’re vaccinated you’re free forego mask. bunch selfish people listening science overly dramatic posters Reddit get self perceived moral high ground. maybe rural areas city, many still wears mask. Well, far happening, although confusing messaging regarding Delta variant. would really nice &lt; 12 years old could vaccinated start school year. Hopefully, schools follow CDC guidelines kids get vaccinated September October. problem told us didn’t need wear masks vaccinated, even though want wear mask, everyone longer wearing you’re looked like unvaccinated. fucked bad. made feel insecure wearing masks.

No, I’m sick people treating mask like it’s cape, treating wearing one it’s hot like it’s massive sacrifice. know there’s science backing need wear mask outside, right? that’s amplified fact you’re vaccinated. Also, fact you’re insinuating others selfish wearing mask despite vaxxed laughable. dude, you’re ass here.

At point public health narrative needs begin addressing anti-vaxxers explicitly. Leave vaccinated alone. We’re moving on.  problem people don’t trust don’t trust Russian government.

It's lame excuse some. Back Covid habit of, know, getting vaccines voluntarily. GP complained one got tetanus booster also asked something else avaliable, got three Hep B shots (Apparently got previously needed, people roughly age still one. got full course found record.) Pneumococcus vaccine. nurse vaccination office said get lot people there. wonder one took long, proven around world one best vaccines. CNN:

“About 200 cases spotted 11 countries. one death reported far, India.”

Like give break already constantly worrying everything. It’s like people rooting covid.  Go … Saudi Arabia?

Yeah, weird. WSJ updated story--it's half infected *adults* quarter total infections. asymptomatic. 

Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb talks quite bit efficacy reduced, slightly, delta variant--it never 100% still high. People two doses mRNA vaccine feel individually protected.

To brief specific: vaccine 94% effective clinical trials symptomatic disease. delta, number 88%. means roughly ten times less likely get sick would unvaccinated.  number used twenty times less likely. means even variants, still see many, many cases vaccinated people getting sick symptoms.

Next, people commonly parroted vaccines ""100% effective hospitalization death."" trials powered towards discerning information, neither ever actually true. know Pfizer vaccine 96% effective hospitalization delta variant, even effective death. means *individual risk* reduced factor 25. 5% chance hospitalization infected previously, 0.2%. Again, risk death even lower. 0.6% (the previous estimated IFR), closer 0.02%. **This line many risks accept every day.**.

It ""pretty common"" cruise ships, outbreak disease occurs, often cruise ships report outbreaks health officials (while regular family catch it). perfect breeding ground happen, given number cruises (used to) happen every year, is/was common.

What's really odd certain foods taste can't describe taste is...but like chips, fried chicken...just certain foods taste same. weirdest part fart poop, smell similar foods taste...what hell going on?    COVID numbers slowly dwindling Washington (King County), I'd like think former... definitely nervous latter. use 3D printed mask. made home, use elastic cord keep on. doesn’t touch ears anymore, touches ring contact around face. puts good space mouth/nose mask. I’ve worn 8 hrs work, comfortable. may forgiving style you. 

That said, I’ve also struggled anxiety. wife too. Idk steps you’ve taken towards managing panic, any, encourage try. pandemic gave lot people access telehealth resources, mental health addressed it. See medical provider, work, local area available. change life better.  Israel omg mask. drama.  really equivalent though. UK May didn’t nearly percentage fully vaccinated people US now. (With obvious variance based locale.)  Problem 60% Israelis fully vaccinated. much different size group unvaccinated.

That said, something minister said without showing actual data let's wait see looks like. data positive late put genie back bottle. Vaccinated people know full well they're asked mask order protect anti-vaxxers others knowingly chosen get vaxxed. That's going fly.

Like not, Delta variant going number unvaccinated. Nothing anymore. chance save chose something else instead. Lots lots selfish people there.  try Kimberly clark ""duck bill"" N95 masks, large ""pocket"" go around back head. find cooler masks I've used hurt ears. look little ducky, cares.... I’m San Diego yeah, one wears mask research shot today, looks liek JnJ vaccine effective others delta variant. Sorry, wearing masks every day back flu killed thousands people every year? coming winter United States (as comment referring to), flu much deadlier immunocompromised young people COVID-19 due vaccination herd immunity. 

It's funny (/sad, horrifying) society ignored people lost lives every single year public health became tribal politicized. Let's try humanity, folks.  know! Bolsonaro, corrupt? can't believe it. Yes, particular vaccine, insurance required completely free. entire south going mess fall. Read post rubbish. UK study posted COVID sub today looked people passing living them.

Y’all trying tell something point probably start looking like cold flu multiple variants start popping everywhere take vaccine tries catch them. Right vaccine best chance dying Covid probably future. 2 weeks 18 months, fuuuuuuuuuck shit Get vaccine, mind business 

The reason I’ve seen people complain want continued rules seems come people secretly haven’t gotten yet mandate happening vaccinated people mask-less, unvaccinated people follow?

It's either this\^: social behavioral driven directive go back masking B) announced effectiveness vaccines completely wrong vaccines nearly effective previously described.

I sure hope social/behavior thing. Whatever, raising average IQ good thing can't understand ppl stop protecting cuz CDC says Look, tried explain virus vs bacteria anti biotics dont work covid mother law LEAST 6 times gave up. I’m suprised she’s confused changing advice.

Stop. stop. talking about? even know thread responding to? also misleading. Mississippi horrible, bad. Almost every metric see precent eligible people. 30% entire population (including children 12).

I don’t really drink alcohol—I haven’t drank since early last year, alcohol shot! vitamins take b12 supplements. made sure drink lot water, try keep hydrated anyway. :D Diet-wise, I’m vegan eat whole foods, home cooked meals. didn’t really anything prepare, except normally live.

My husband diet, also hasn’t drank alcohol since last year, drank shitton water day (he’s normally well-hydrated xD) days after. much easier time did! felt chills body aches bit less day, felt tired.

I’ll also add get sick day flu vaccine, too. (Body aches, fever, exhaustion.) kind anticipating vaccine would kick ass. got appointment. Shot week. still need time decide I’m idiot smart! I’m scared teach won’t masks fall. Also I’m old dirt. way Canada still saw slow down. hey, hope I'm wrong guys make it! got first dose May 6th hopefully getting second tomorrow. held data coming UK showing robust response longer duration doses I'll wear mask, I'll get vaccine throw party I'll damned government tells can't go visit family. follow since news good. lockdowns continue rate vaccines improves. Nope. gaslighted people like thinking empathy wearing mask getting vaccinated staying home year. screw right  Realistically, severe versions disease make virus *less* fit, even though cut transmission near nothing (like something killed quickly would).

It seems like best guess average period contagiousness 10 days (looking CDC quarantine guidelines) symptoms tend appear around 4-5 days.

If new variants tend make individuals sicker, transmission second half contagiousness likely drop (given they'd mostly staying home). Variants less severe likely see people entire infectious period, giving time spread others. 

This huge effect means severe variants die immediately, order *no* impact would severe symptoms/death never occur infectious period up, think agree case. forgetting rinderpest. Kills infects cattle.

Associated Press reported nearly COVID deaths U.S. among unvaccinated. 18,000 COVID-19 deaths occurred May, around 150, 0.8% fully vaccinated people. wide availability vaccines risks posed variants, Mississippi continues rank last nation share population vaccinated. 32% Mississippians fully vaccinated despite significant gains made recent months vaccinating vulnerable making vaccine access equitable. People simply declining get shots, keeping Mississippi last good article. Thanks posting it.  personally think already problem effective current vaccines delta variant. original die out, we'll left one. Well, duh. half county vaccinated. Almost everyone shopping stores maskless. paper…


The combination observational data laboratory data suggests correlation NAbTs vaccine efficacy recent models10 continues perform well across different vaccine types SARS-CoV-2 variants (appendix p 5). highlights lower starting NAbTs AZD1222 recipients render vaccine efficacy susceptible possible individual-level variation (eg, prior infection, age, immune status, antibody durability, comorbidities). Prevention infection, however, appears require substantially higher NAbTs prevention severe COVID-19 disease death. Therefore, although reduced in-vitro neutralisation VOCs predicts reduced AZD1222 vaccine efficacy symptomatic infection VOCs, close monitoring unfolding pandemic reveal extent link severe fatal COVID-19 broken current vaccines. Thanks. post though. haven’t seen one yet. :) Right?! find reading thinking - wow, boomers think like that! vaccine prevent getting seriously ill dying. VACCINATE FUCKING COUNTRY FFS get vaccinated? extreme anxiety take meds meds help somewhat completely mask anxiety. see point getting vaccine. admit may hard headed. Best answer may make reconsider get vaccine. friend telling today doesn’t like taste cheddar cheese anymore since got Covid, can’t smell poop. regained smells tastes changed, used heavy condiment (ketchup honey mustard mostly) user pretty much cut usage hard since getting covid last July. Probably I’ve dropped much weight hah. That's argument keeping three vaccines seperate. might make hesitation go away getting them. Theoretically zero COVID would possible never let anyone country. It’s realistic. yeah, need learn live it. US, countries. AD resident here. 

There’s option dial string numbers symbols get latest test result. app required. realise attitude makes people bother masks/social distancing/getting vaccinated right? different points spectrum. discussing dude online told people get vaccinated, virus mutate less chance dangerous variants decrease. reasoning virus dies quicker vaccinated host thus replicates less mutates less. tried find source conforming couldn't. search result could find whether vaccines protect mutants, prevent mutating first place. So, right trust intuition much? Bonus points someone provide source this. TIA! Followed

I fully vaccinated MRNA vaccine almost two months now. sad infuriating. People developing countries access vaccines must totally bewildered. US widespread access vaccines world. Agreed. live STL know many people travel outside saint louis county get vaccinated people rural areas aren’t getting vaccine. I’ve vaccinated since February everyone know 12 vaccinated. need booster year not? call rose something else rose. hear would still smell sweet. would able smell it, cus ain't rose anymore, something else.....
You're welcome. Israel even going zero Covid? seem want maintain low transmission virus. live stupid state. Vaccine availability problem. rural areas got first dibs St. Louis Kansas City vaccines first approved, ended throwing unused doses away people STL KC weren’t able get vaccines unless drove hours rural parts state. can’t find article exact numbers, back February March, town population hundred people received thousands doses went waste.

At point anyone wants one go Walgreens Wal-Mart get one, there’s shortage those. get them, don’t want them. Well none us used global pandemic. people treat like it’s something that’s done personally.  It’s boomeriah. People stubborn generation. stubborn people I’ve met young.   do. go 22nd July Conservatives always think every rule like Ten Commandments change anything you’re showing ulterior motives. CDC’s naive, knew anti-vaxxers would take masks second made announcement. think it’s way saying “We freely available vaccine, you’re don’t want get sick. one’s protecting anymore” Even said generation changes story time too. mean also wish virulence virus static too, anyone actually living past year would know better. think people honestly believe COVID-19 would go away. told would go away certain influential people top advice. TOP ADVISORS. 

Ask 10 people know believe COVID-19 ENDEMIC. explain half endemic means, wait answer. mean it’s really tragic. I’m even trying Lord fact many us already realized it. It’s big disappointment many people didn’t take seriously loss suffer Also strange considering Scotland generally much better performer rest UK, yet far worst affected wave. I’ve always described people reading book. We’re Chapter 3…of 400. There’s going new information, characters, revelations, twists. can’t stop 3 chapters expect pass final. maybe also almost like one still sympathize frustration condescending ass like even read said. Eligible book able book different thing. eligible second dose, currently openings time soon. They're speculating based upon current evidence- exactly said ""might"" need boosters. Ambiguous data leads ambiguous statements responsible people speak it. needs evidence heading Cold War 2 covid 0 technically impossible one country countries covid 0? Especially country like US gets 20 million international travelers year see could possible, even community spread stopped, imported cases always risk rest world can't stomp out. live Missouri. It’s easy get vaccinated here. Many pop vaccination sites, need go online reserve time. get one Walgreens CVS. pop clinics major cities almost always full, point friends mine St. Louis drove two hours find one small town openings. ones small towns lots open slots, people aren’t interested.

And I’m you. It’s scary navigating world knowning vulnerable people around us selfish people think freedom attack piece cloth face. individualist, collective. apparent. There’s “greater good” there’s take everyone else. Nobody responsible wants lie you.

Nobody makes mind without proof business jobs.

These people simply telling know based upon current evidence. make trust far suspicious people speak certainty despite lack evidence.  Clinical trials began *last* January. point they're keeping tabs people tests seeing long immunity lasts. 

Out abundance caution, they've always mentioned boosters might needed, there's never evidence would. 

It's way scientists speak, exact opposite politicians people media speak. make actual effort full bullshit.

Get vaccinated. There's absolutely reason fear get booster year happens, chances won't. solution *might not* perfect always better solution. south refused expand Medicaid political reasons people refusing get vaccine. That’s great hear. Thanks posting. It’s hard know what’s happening anywhere besides live. hope people follow example. ""Could""

""Maybe"" That’s fuck ton leaps, holy shit.

Someone absolute, selfish cluster fuck addict abandons children absolutely become amazing parents clean.

People change. number US alone haven’t yet experienced P1 Delta variants. 

For sake around you; please under-estimate Delta variant.

Edit suggested original Delta variant 40% 60% transmissible Alpha also concern Delta variant may adept attacking lung cells. bad news lung cells well. all, unless something gone horribly wrong, lung cells attached. result, Delta variant may likely versions virus make ill. June 11 report Public Health England indicated “early data England Scotland demonstrate increased risk hospitalisation Delta compared Decriminalization often results lower usage well better education drugs- wouldn’t want something dangerous fentanyl?

If decriminalized, person could go specific clinics drugs tested… worry facing criminal charges drug comes positive fentanyl.  Thank sharing this!  haha seems like it, huh! Probably matter considering covid mutated beyond recognition we'll need boosters new variants anyway. Vaccinations 100%. It. Is. Literally. piece cloth. wear it. People get charged dealing drugs, despite personal stash, time.

Others forced selling.

Maybe she’s asshole, you’re assuming lot simultaneously ignoring fucked justice system is. one person knows everything took place lab, that's point Yes are. Get it. piece cloth, fucking basic empathy wear it. anyone else talking lab relevant experience does? I'm sorry people responding empathy. I'm vaccinated masking going forward. live gave youngest covid. can't even imagine going right now, stay strong hunker down.  Honestly, think enough data say definitively one way another. Vaccines supposed reduce rate severe illness, still get mild symptoms. reports people long-term issues contracting mild even asymptomatic covid. unclear whether there's long-term difference mild/asymptomatic covid vaccinated unvaccinated people. That's still needs studied. What? say anything professional credentials individual. They're relevant though. still one person observed necessarily indicative anyone else's experience. everyone masking (double masking indoors) going forward. huge ask could save life. This...made day!

I agree it’s controversial believe majority COVID cases Japan ordinary Japanese citizens. Even without large number people entering Japan Games, number new cases going least Tokyo already, anyway. wish awareness among Olympic Paralympic athletes fact Games inevitably take away previous medical recourses residents likely high demand spreading delta variant, heat-related illnesses prevalent Japanese summer, hope people know better misdirect frustration rising new cases foreign-looking people living encounter everyday life.  name Rand Paul? uncle fully vaccinated got covid- lost smell weeks, he’s back normal now.

I’m sure there’s still chance could lose smell longhorn, doesn’t seem common. article discussed evolutionary ""behavior"" viruses general context difficulty assigning virulence. specifically delta. antivaxxers. u/everydaytrash94 would disagree. think less delivery people receive interpret information. internet social media enable us recieve information, news, research, etc almost immediately. Sometimes, becomes soo much information coming soo quickly average person unable discern fact opinion best advice time. part, media anything help issue. mostly add confusion fear inducing/shock value headlines. pandemic rapidly evolving situation.

 scientific method empirical method acquiring knowledge characterized development science since least 17th century. involves careful observation, applying rigorous skepticism observed, given cognitive assumptions distort one interprets observation. involves formulating hypotheses, via induction, based observations; experimental measurement-based testing deductions drawn hypotheses; refinement (or elimination) hypotheses based experimental findings.

The key part 'belief' based constancy certainty world view - assumptions conclusions. place comfort, especially becomes group-think.

Science expanding boundaries ignorance - know, questions have. 

In cases, new knowledge/theories completely wipe older theories, expand them/refine them/determine limits applicability. thing is, bought vaccine every manufacturer, production. Also, ""excess"" supply delivered til end 2021 even 2022. Even now, probably excess supply donate Sept earliest.

The main benefit buying every manufacturer need ""bets"" pay off, 2-3 enough vaccine country. think that’s also saying right now, though somewhat round-about way. Perhaps, little longer (another 6 months year so) then, hopefully we’ll maintained effect want. 

When pandemic happened 100 years ago, ran good 4 years, 48 months. We’ve gone 1.5 years, 16 months far, know? don’t want people stop protecting others soon. theoretically ways go. 2nd dose &amp; Delta rage  Feels like lot people thread skimmed article read headline. Based findings, researchers suggested immunity might last years, possibly lifetime, **in people infected later vaccinated.** unclear whether vaccination alone might similarly long-lasting effect. Fuck it, mask *on* That's probably there's demand NY, little here. (jokingly) salty husband got first, supposed phase 2 according distribution schedule. Registered health dept. everything. really happened since demand vax even phase 1 low, county said ""Okay, everyone else wants one, come get it."" People cities heading rural areas because, even though supply low, demand even lower.  study actually two things important:

First, looked brain scans people happened brain scan reason time caught covid. caught covid, study invited another brain scan could compare two scans. allows ""pre-covid/post-covid"" comparison possible previous ""post-hoc"" studies looked brains infection without clue brains looked like infection.

Second, every participant covid, tried find someone took first brain scan similar time participant age (+/- 6 months) catch covid. invited person take part study participant control group. able compare brains people caught covid timespan changed, brains people catch covid changed.

The results good. found loss gray matter caught covid compared catch covid. Apparently brain, significant parts brain compared parts brain. could explain things like ""brain fog"" long covid patients guess.

And also matches symptoms, since loss gray matter significant areas need smelling / tasting things.

They found severe changes hospitalized patients, finding significant (it could random). I'd frame way rough toy model..... LA county's apparently seeing infection rate 1.1 (according covidactnow), meaning cases increasing.If quarter cases involve vaccinated, vaccinated wearing masks drop half cases, it'd drop us back infection rate less 1 cases would declining again. even vaccinated people getting dominant cause, could area potential reduction get case numbers going right direction again, every bit reduction helps towards getting thing potentially beat.

Though think also mention people wearing masks put pressure unvaccinated people less dishonest also wear masks. everyone wear masks make easier make sure unvaccinated (esp many proud they're lying saying they're vaccinated, least old neck woods) post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I'm pondering competency reporting. report many things end wrong public loses faith. UK also country extremely high vaccination uptake rate among age groups, high 95%. relevant among 50's highest chances death. US's much higher vaccine hesitancy means unvaccinated older people far common therefore may still account significant numbers deaths autumn winter, Delta rages less vaccinated covid-sceptic communities like wildfire.

You usually spot people faking able wear mask smug, rude, acting like assholes, generally biggest shit-eating-grin ever seen person proudly tell conspiracy theories deal them. 

You sound like mistaken one people happened, online otherwise, I'm sorry think fault something blame for. part getting vaccine trying take precautions (including masks) none available. long takes, I'm afraid wearing one neither be. ahh.. another Trump Kushner  Interesting, article deleted immediately posted r/worldnews. that's fine. great sample size, still pretty reassuring  wish CDC would announce Back November caught covid literal place going grocery store back home, always wearing mask. line cashier mask nose sneezed right face.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* we're going back route oh look, come layoffs again. first reason posted still anti-vax. second reason certainly less common first. think valid point know people concerned / anxious ordered wear masks forever. Practically speaking though, think number places US going required wear one vanishingly small, mean California ended requirements, going real concern. someone wants wear mask 'illogically', cares point. (And saying 'cared' not-your-business way, asked politely.)

And people still danger, well, there's reason masks thing countries Covid. might learn something them. point vaccines would need order people take precautions could become discretion. 35/40 still masked seems right live; Alexandria VA.  still wear one stores near future. Yep. there’s people never wore masks. consistent message “be patriot, wear mask.” thing would fraction been.  wear equivalent N85 86 (cloth mask layer Filti) even though fully vaccinated. I’m moving closer N95 due Delta using cloth mask two layers Filti. think 40% republicans didn’t get COVID vaccine? know liberals won’t get 😂🤣

But means, get vaccine. next vaccine comes new strain, get that. body choice 👍🏻 people 40 even first shot yet, let alone second. People aged 40-50 still fully vaccinated either, although might pubs/restaurants reopened weeks. people 40 affected well working pubs, 30 year olds, since 35 year old fully vaccinated month now, maybe first shot. 30-34 year old probably still waiting first shot time. love confident article is. US barely using massive sequencing capabilities we’re mostly flying blind.  ""evil"" lol And, albinism occurs one every 10,000 mammal births.

About odds. “Masks really infected people prevent spreading infection people infected rather protecting uninfected people acquiring infection,” wrote head National Institute Allergies Infectious Diseases (NIAID).

“The typical mask buy drug store really effective keeping virus, small enough pass material. might, however, provide slight benefit keep[ing] gross droplets someone coughs sneezes you. recommend wear mask, particularly since going low risk location.”

“The vast majority people outside China need wear mask,” read Fauci-approved response. “A mask appropriate someone infected people trying protect infection.” would really love definitive answer since can’t get 2nd due anaphylaxis first. :( yeah seem political leanings, funnily enough... hospitals, even worse, hospitals going business, small number. Managed massive regions nationally buying hammering lower budgets onto make solvent, profitable. 

Maybe hospitals treated public service instead business make money. Nope. I'm saying antivax groups exploiting minority groups gain based upon 70 year old atrocities. fail statistics class? That’s like saying seat belt protect unless doesn’t, I’m going wear it. Exactly. “infected” viruses time. don’t always get actual disease, virus replicating. Vaccines prevent lessen severity, viral load, etc. Soooo many people don’t understand that. propose what? mask indefinitely, safety, order peer pressure unvaccinated comply prevention tactic next useless point? GTFO. It’s giant health system monopolies taking hospitals. run like tightwad business. billable hours nurses, PTs…ridiculous.  CDC study prioritization showed benefits vaccinating elderly first saved lives vaccinating essential workers first. Vaccinating essential workers reduced cases bit, vaccinating oldest first saved lives. 

There course point cut-off reverses given age bias IFR, clear age stratification valuable far ends curves. 

The UK gleaming example right now. Cases surging hospitalizations barely up. Deaths lagging indicator showed little response case surge relative prior ones. 

It matter much cases high people likely die COVID mostly protected. 

If worried bartenders spreading COVID, best solution to.. bartenders serving pandemic. reason bars open bartenders able serve right *because* we've done age stratified vaccinations. Get em brother. Watch day after. sick hell protected. read article? explains doctor making recommendation. Go traveler Weird getting smoked downvotes got upvoted sharing sentiment real life anecdote. Whatever still offer adequate protection Delta future variants, would introduce newer vaccines and/or revive lockdown measures?  great example virtue signaller, seeking moral high ground due vax status. Meanwhile Netherlands: almost measures lifted, including strict mask mandate.  certain % transmission/deaths met.

I believe proposed wear masks forever.   Okay, well that's opinion, I'm sure actual sociologist would disagree. Also, literally used word ""consult"". Meaning would simply gain opinion of, would mandate determine exactly things go, kind official sociologist team. got mother close friend take really hammering pros vs cons. eventually got shut up.  Anti-vax groups nothing that. indeed government destroyed trust people authorities. fact, ""anti-vax"", rather vax-hesitancy groups originated epic fails.

People act like vaccine hesitancy baseless, groups nothing. calls authoritarianism towards worrisome. problem listening them. listen fuck different result. lot times, people irrational keep moving goal posts. prove vaccines cause cancer, suddenly goal post vaccines cause autism need provide research showing doesn't. exhausting. People want something find excuse matter much logic side counter every argument.  Indeed, like pandemic focused things greatest threats older people love: heart disease, cancer, stroke. big killers actually risk-mitigated even reasonably prevented individuals making changes within person's control. exceedingly us cared Covid, exceedingly us care now. Or, person accountable actions, get life. know pay issue states, like Alabama, nurses make far surrounding states. one main cause state's nursing shortage. I’m Georgia county 30% vaccinated nobody wears mask anywhere. It’s appalling. That's literally point vaccines bartender extremely exposed. would think 10x factor bare minimum guesstimate. like conducting cappella group full time except everyone drunk singers constantly replaced. Serious question: much need things drop? seen numbers? low long time. get vaccination try live ""normal"" again? Like vax, even political parties agreed along big companies go ahead open yet sit still wondering wait? get it. perfectly said. true applies people say that. way they’ve handled whole pandemic vaccine mess beginning. course you’re going people nervous taking vaccine. mention side effects J&amp;J heart inflammations small number people had. bad news adds fuel fire. used go camping lot Minnesota. longer pesky residents assuming 6 Eagle scouts causing issues. age 20-25 hard core camping gear: backpacks, backpacking tents, MSI whisper light stoves, key stove, hiking boots, etc... look like amateurs.

 


My troop used go previously 2017 longer local rolled asked child diddlers brandished pistol. Thankfully camping trip small turn messed kids. little brother like Minnesota outside Boundary Waters this. someone else social anxiety, there's one thing I've learned 39 years nobody gives shit social anxiety people even believe exists.

It make difference *should* put with, matters will.  imagine make Omega variant?  That's nice provide study statement, random doctor Joe Rogan? boss said third dose helpful, amid supply issue.

In China, there's clinical research mixing vaccine clinical Sinovac CanSino (adnovirus vector), pre-clinical results promising. Hong Kong similar clinical research mixing Sinovac BioNTech. course. goes top ten causes death age brackets question. unintentional accidents result death either, #1 killer ages 1-44 [per incidents still far-reaching consequences (paralysis, disability, physical mental trauma, etc). 

My point wore seatbelts, exercised, eat shitty food could live longer. easier fixate what's novel even danger relatively mild. Hmm, wonder could happened 5 years ago would trigger uncharacteristic behavior seemingly respectable people. much confused messaging world different sectors society. exact sentiment I’m feeling too. It’s like keep oscillating practical considerations like hospital capacity idea covid deaths need prevented. get longer virus circulates, mutations have, feels like punished right thing. everyone gotten vaccine we’d probably well 100 daily deaths nationwide point. Yup, silver bullet though.

I feel expect lockdowns restrictions coming up. 40% Republicans constitute majority anything. less medical staff, infectious disease, larger pockets unvaccinated many reduced distancing masking restrictions .  


I think add different factors causes concern .  


More vaccinated regions handle better states experiencing 30% vaccination imagine even 10% state populations need medical care reduced medical staff ? hell 5% entire state hospital gonna stressful. quite. clarify, Abdala 42 days full efficacy pfizer moderna 28 days full efficacy (14 days shots + 14 days waiting).

Keyword “might.” studies continue things discovered. isn’t hard concept thing town, north Boston, state there's high vaccine uptake. I'd initially thought people would keep masks even mandate lifted month ago. practice, people stopped wearing week order lifted. Even cautious state, want longer to. there's delta variant cases here, seem still pretty good handle things, high vaccination rate. Well that’s assuming people Mississippi even afford see  public health experts really think hospitals collapse many adults fully vaccinated + others natural immunity? high risk death/hospitalization vaccinated? overwhelmed like bad flu season maybe (see 2018 overflow tents used flu season), news acting like delta new pandemic despite effective vaccines. mean, even anymore? risk always exist life. know I’m one exhausted calls restrictions vaccinated. overcame needle phobia wanted life back. live healthy lives restrictions hanging heads indefinitely manageable cases? tried see sides long, come on.

We can't assume cater level self-righteous stupidity let affect decisions. lot reasons people may continue wear mask, even anything Covid.

Also, doubt people discuss vaccination status random idiots street, business making assumptions stranger's vaccination status.

I feel like wearing mask still polite thing do. Workers can't choose, worst wearing mask hurt them, might make feel comfortable respected. Georgia really? expect one havent keeping state statistics 2021 started. hard understand people thinking.. know bunch superior education still unvaccinated Efficiency good, side effects much.

The boosters used well vaccinated aka real supply problem. double vaxxed. Kids not. nervous sending back school Fall especially I'm hearing Delta. Thoughts trajectory affecting school workplaces? I'm Tennessee, 40% fully vaccinated population county (including course) nobody's wearing masks anymore. still stores outside anymore. There's usually handful people wearing masks stores now. Granted covid cases low I'm worried Delta variant. They'll argue 'god giveth, god taketh away'.

Not like god gave us fucking vaccines inject faces wear mask complain isn’t impressive considering NYS much bigger Ontario… isn’t. TIL Ontario almost 15million people. NYC seems way mentally.

It's Nebraska. new variants!! 😂 Fubar Lmao. NYC hasn’t *partially defunded* police department… even did, wouldn’t retroactively caused spike gun crime. think people compare mRNA vaccines looks inferior, AZ still fantastic vaccine choice. Vaccine uptake UK high, amount people vaccinated still depends supply, we'll still take vaccine get hands on.

Let's forget AZ still hugely effective Delta variant, huge advantage needs kept fridge temperature, rather freezing levels Pfizer needs, makes much easier logistically distribute.

In short, AZ touted inferior vaccine hugely exaggerated never going achieve herd immunity, though. unlikely wildtype almost impossible new variants.

So what's long term solution? Forever masking? personally mind wearing mask store, still do, experiences made much worse masks.

I would make two arguments here: 

First, current scenario, risk wear N95s public--they provide great protection--and avoid unvaccinated friends family. 

Second, instituting vaccine passports mandates infinitely fair less infringement rights adding new restrictions (only necessary many refused shot) Yeah sure seeing ""lots people"" masking DFW - maybe ER. I'm central Ohio went store girlfriend Saturday. like 2 100 still using masks. RIP Ohio would need say "" COVID suspected linked brain tissue loss causality yet established"" they're right. contact CDC that’s astronomically low statistical event. winter southern hemisphere. Russians apparently immune reality. It’s good enough get past bot guess. Canada used see odd person wearing mask, usually Chinese, thought bit odd hey, own. 

It new norm long time. FYI study looked data January 4 February 28, 2021, delta variant would likely different, higher numbers. LOL, indeed. Meanwhile I'm watching CNBC reports airline CEO's touting ""people move again!"".

Net net, a) vaccine makes less deadly, mean can't get covid (and want it) b) can't trust knuckleheads around you. Depends part NorCal visited. I'm Stockton, 60-70% mask use places like markets, hardware stores, etc. I've last 2 weeks...but erode cases surge. SF likely high mask usage (went May, SF beyond obsessed precautions. Sacto Metro area mixed, cities eastern corridor used rural large and/or wealthy likely 50/50 masks,. many areas NorCal (wine country, north state, north coast, developed foothills, San Jose, Oakland/Berkeley, etc. Depending many outbreaks/deaths city/area before, likely masks usage going away slowly. Forty million people, dozens areas regions different points view Covid, open not, trusting people other's Covid status public places. Glad hear SoCal careful, case numbers still there, parts LA, Orange, etc vaccinated I'm hearing Delta variant issue north. Yet. again. Someone going die directly “cures” indirectly thinking they’re fine don’t need hospitalisation. Dr. Dobbs absolutely fantastic consistent, understandable messaging whole thing. It’s real shame he’s undermined idiot governor. Cases shit metric. Cases flu common cold huge usually that's relevant. ICU hospitalizations deaths matter vaccine. they're increasing UK. I’m teaching summer school. Five 40 students (three sections) wear masks. I’m wearing mask even though I’m vaccinated kids coughing sneezing.  Fuck IOC. right truth told. Thank Switch Canada, second dose explosion. That’s exactly it. Fear change. Even doesn’t effect lives still unacceptable. conservative politicians know play fear. Trump member club master making people think needed afraid. vaccinated means ""both shots enough time""...

Shit keep coming back, like flu. mean ought revolutionize way life anymore.

Variants really unlikely pass mRNA vaccine. likely flu à la H5N1 co would arise. risk always always present. Could causation way around too! People loss brain tissue could likely get covid. likely turn away show third shot. can't describe tooth paste tastes like it...it's minty still odd flavor well. weird mildly infuriating.. fully vaccinated too. source--I'm lazy find better one.

Both numbers basically right.

They think 88% effective symptomatic disease 79% effective preventing spread (i.e. 9% gap would asymptomatic people still infect others despite getting sick themselves).

I say 88% number directly comparable 94% clinical trials, think stick *or* use qualifier make clear meant 79% efficacy. main issue continue wear mask: dealing people. continue use useful mantra head: ""Mind f\*\*\*ing business!"" helps. Cases kids going Delta. Lot kids spreading equals cases obviously kids interact people. 

It's dying, spread virus. happens, also claim even worst mutations, mRNA vaccines stay 50% balance waiting longer fact one shot less protective Delta variants previous variants. you’re area rapid spread, may want wait. government's 'not race' stance towards vaccine rollout really aged like milk. thought general consensus travel big factor behind flu decline. argument flu migrates globally year, hence different flu seasons different parts world, greatly decreased travel migration stunted Man that's pathetic. America far ahead almost everyone else there's many crazy people there. Likely depends TX? bro Dallas saying mask usage still pretty high.   This! Sure? Masks cool cute really problem wearing one go outside socks jacket pants.

To honest, year putting leaving house taking get home (and adding washing hands right get home ritual too) feel like there's reason simply keep that. protect faceholes common cold?  dont think fair CDC.  40% population literally wants nation fail cos currently Democratic President.  good faith actors society, nothing that. think better getting mRna J&amp;J. comfy ""at least effective enough."" possible get mRna, sure, J&amp;J beats nothing. That’s false. Unvaccinated people obviously risks children 12 can’t vaccinated vulnerable people vaccinated poor response. Unvaccinated people also allowing infections stay high produce variants.

Anti-vaxx people don’t care anyone else.

It’s OK get vaccinated. I’m sure make claim. never drive anywhere, never fly, never cross road, never walk outside, ...

You roll dice damn time. We're 65 percent fully vaccinated 74 percent partially vaccinated. lot faith vaccine. could definitely wear mask. missed reference, pls enlighten here. also 2 children old enough vaccinated. Pfizer disrupted menstrual cycle. I’ve never issue period 25 years, I’ve never taken birth control kind. I’ve also never sore arm vaccine (MMR, hepatitis, tetanus, flu, etc.). day took first Pfizer shot, experienced menstrual spotting two weeks period would normally begin. saw GYN. noted inflammation would need track cycle months see pattern disruption could caused lot things. bacteria test came back negative, tracked months. straightened out. 

Either trial didn’t include lot women menstruate it’s rare. Whatever case, appears harmless even though frightening completely unexpected (no one likes think cancer). 

Last month saw article Guardian this. absolutely real phenomenon needs understood better. Evidently inflammation natural part menstrual cycle, vaccine seems trigger process people. Young men experiencing heart inflammation seems vaccine simply triggers usual inflammation people. 

Whether long lasting damage yet seen, frankly. I’m still going vaccinate, think people honest vaccines. lot don’t know, finding scale. 


[The Guardian: menstrual cycle changes covid jab would short lived Netherlands really fans masks. indoor mask mandate like 6/10 wearing mask area Netherlands recently. Since couple days ago there's indoor mask mandate anymore, dropped something like 1 2 10 wearing masks.

Luckily, 2 days ago 70% adults least partially vaccinated nationally. fully vaccinated 42% 2 days ago. Agree. think lot urban dwellers imagine rest country kind ""lock down"" past 16 months, life pretty much covid (public behavior-wise mean) say May 2020. local covid deaths bother folks? - literally could care less others. Ah read wrong line. bad.

Good come conclusion then, least there’s independent verification. need focus slowing spread flattening curve hate “delta end world crap.” Statistics I’ve seen show 50% contagious UK variant. yes, that’s great, far contagious, means average spread 2 people, would spread 3. Yes, that’s more, that’s going make society fall apart. people say something like ""the vaccine 95% effective"", think mean that? think happening 5% time?

That 5% time, get COVID.

A vaccine permanent shield individual. *systemic* solution effective everyone vaccinated. Unfortunately title article aged quickly. Brisbane south east Queensland lockdown 6pm oz eastern time today well, making 4 Australia’s capital cities lockdown periods varying days two weeks initially. Yep. Teacher here. Sadly grew “answer getters” shunned got answer incorrect. 

In classroom tell students flat don’t care right. care think critically, explain thinking, change thinking, discuss others. look like 3 eyeballs. That's shots, guy. enough time 2nd build immunity, instant. 

Also, plenty breakthrough cases. And, people means variants. 

If go inside, wear mask now. easy. sucks shit keep coming back learn follow basics. NYT Covid articles behind paywall week ago, recent change. crazy thinking vaccinated people going spread higher viral load fall. Unvaccinated going serious trouble.

The fall could lot worse unvaccinated people, vaccinated population IgG/IgA titer waned 8-10x, thereby becoming asymptomatic spreaders higher viral Funny say ""too pessimistic"" masking comment article that's already pushing masking again.

Delta contagious hit unvaccinated places hard. going affect vaccinated places well lesser degree, vaccinated people lesser degree. fall comes we're concerts bars clubs everything's fully ""back normal"", widespread cases everywhere. 

Just look curve that's happening UK right now--it's steep steeper previous waves. We're going take time around, we're also going see vaccinated people getting dying (at lower rates unvaxxed, still) complicate narrative.

I really hope go lockdown, think see measures coming back--masking, greater push vaxxinate, particularly employers. Totally, problem even eligibility opened everyone, daily vaccination rates [dropped like since mid April.  definitely spreading inthe UK PHE putting weekly reports. 

The US fucked up. CDC. Someone high up. Telling people go around maskless idiotic anyone paying attention time knew it. 

Maybe hoped reverse psychology something again, anyone paying attention knows shit work select group. also one people really severe reactions getting vaccine times. second shot laid out. sicker ever entire life. 

Could get warm three days. fill three Nalgene bottles hot water slept surrounded them. 

It awful seriously would need think ever getting vaccine again. many hospitalized? strictly speaking we're doomed die whether take vaccine Fully vaccinated individuals _can_ contract COVID. CDC literally tracks ""vaccine breakthrough cases."" May, changed criteria ""breakthrough case"" include hospitalizations deaths ""improve quality data."" AKA - many infections among fully vaccinated resulting much noise data.

From January April year, 10,262 infections amongst fully vaccinated individuals. 995 people hospitalized. 160 died. is, CDC's admission, probably big undercount. Meaning real number likely way larger. relevant studies regarding vaccine induced immunity natural reasoning protein specific immunity holds merit. since fast evolving landscape, assertions made yet. Re-infections among vaccinated rare, possible. thing holds previously infected.

CC /u/joanasponas /u/thedude1179 /u/reggie2319 /u/BigBankBaller That's crazy. I'm Southwest Missouri Delta become dominant saying 90% cases here. 30% less vaccinated area.  Seems children contracting Delta variant often past strains…and biggest group unvaccinated people. I've told many times infant perfectly fine get it. Lol. disagreeing but, least North Carolina, open without restrictions like March. 

There age comorbidity limitations (rightfully so).  Ok I'm betting Nebraska low terms vaccination uptake well. seem go hand hand. Must southern thing ...okay?  like Alabama lol vaccinated, young healthy, almost nothing worry about, true before, purely selfish perspective.

If old, much less worry overall, efficacy vaccine somewhat muted entire abandonment mitigation. simply accurate say nothing worry about. Probably trying create strain--We could call Mississippi Burning volume 2 lipid shell concentrates ovaries bone marrow. translation product MRNA vaccine spike protein pathogenic. cause clotting disorders myocarditis pericarditis teens. 

We don’t know long term side effects either. point. live go cinema?  don’t understand take. would bet masks come back? part last 12 months data suggests people would wear masks states would re-implement mask mandates? Additionally, 50% country fully vaccinated, almost 70% adults, would need that? even people continued wear them, aren’t likely people covid anyways yet see proof vaccinated person caught spread anyone. source that? saying isn’t true. never seen anything showing happened. He’s like cartoon level evil.  non-COVID vaccines longer intervals doses - 2+ months several years.

COVID vaccines tested short intervals sped tests.   countries (like US) followed schedule mass vaccination avoid stepping outside narrow band tested phase 3 trials; others (notably UK Canada) followed ""first doses first"" strategy longer interval attempt reduce number completely unvaccinated people quickly possible.

Longer intervals allow immunity first dose mature longer immune system ""reminded"" 2nd dose leads better long-term durability immunity.   psychophysical testing, 43 51 patients (84.3%) objectively normosmic, including 19 27 (70.0%) self-evaluated partially recovered 

This part actually kind ... What’s word ... Telling? known long time placebo nocebo powerful effects. really starting wonder many people self-report certain symptoms long time, simply objectively wrong, subjectively experiencing think it’s there. don’t mean dismissive, certainly people suffering, that’s matters. it’s medically relevant. amazingly, much hurts admit it, US’s covid strategy currently working much better Australia‘s. Sydney region 30 new cases daily, entire province strictest lockdown 2 weeks. 3% fully vaccinated, 25% one dose. strategy make sure nobody ever exposed also nobody vaccinated doesn’t work. It’s like weapons free zone someone comes gun—he untold damage still favors hydroxicloroquine, man. says virus best kind immunization. hate him, much. I'd shocked crack much higher numbers 10k cases. one fly ointment would testing tanking. would like point New Zealand island naturally able restrict travel more. Also, due fact island South Pacific, points entry ship plane. also cohesive government unlike United States due way U.S government structured, left Covid policies individual states. 
Since governors state wildly different policies way close state borders, created issues spread (initially now). lack ability enforce cohesive national policy means U.S. response cannot compared New Zealand's response Covid. thousands miles unguarded borders U.S north south problematic well.
Also, give example part problem, state even cohesive statewide policy. Instead differed county county. problematic lot people county travel work. work county north travel even north next county (2 counties north). Additionally county lot people work across river another state. even get started put vaccine roll out...until opened every one trying figure phase eligibility like shaking magic 8 ball. Pretty much. Newsom pressure recall keeping things open. Doubt lose another lockdown/mask mandate that’s one thing would probably end him. I'm sorry baby can't wear little mask save lives.  say... home state dumb, we're **that** dumb. reason fundamentalist religions stripe do. govern life literal reading thousand year old texts, going miss benefits modernity... walks like duck quacks like duck...   True, younger people vacinated, can't even transmit older, valunerable populations. happens raise entire generation lead (known neurotoxin) additive gasoline. think caused generational brain damage “fact check” bases immunity *one* correlate protection, IgG serum levels, whole picture. Good news!

I'm really sorry anyone suffering truly hope improves quickly. Stop. Data reinfection necessarily support position.

[This paper, titled “Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Persist 13 Months Reduce Risk found 97% protection Overall, 69 SARS-CoV-2 infections developed COVID-19 negative group (incidence 12.22 per 100 person-years) versus one COVID-19 positive group (incidence 0.40 per 100 person-years), indicating relative reduction incidence SARS-CoV-2 reinfection 96.7%

[This one, titled “SARS-CoV-2 infection rates antibody-positive compared antibody-negative health-care workers England: large, multicentre, prospective cohort study found 84% protection, described minimum, due multiple caveats lowered effect:

1. two “reinfections” classified “possible”, remaining two “probable”, none “confirmed”. 84% estimate based using “possible” reinfections.
2. one third “reinfections” typical COVID symptoms
3. authors include baseline seronegative people converted seropositive COVID-19 cases
4. authors found pattern indicated seemed consistent RNA shedding, counting “reinfections”
The authors note issues **Restricting reinfections probable reinfections only, estimated June November 2020, participants positive cohort 99% lower odds probable reinfection, adjusted (aOR) 0.01 (95% CI 0.00-0.03).

And course, recent [Cleveland Clinic found 100% protective effect.

There’s study found protective effect 82%. adjusting race, age sex, HR 0.16 protective effect 84%. authors note 84% “reinfections” asymptomatic, compared 68% primary infections. However, authors believe may undercount investigation likely underestimate risk SARS-CoV-2 infection previously infected individuals seronegative group included unknown number previously infected participants significant IgG titres baseline serum sample.

However, note conditions marines study may limit it’s generalizability: high rate infection MCRDPI attributed crowded living conditions, demanding regimen, requirement personal contact basic training despite pandemic leads, known contribute increased risk respiratory epidemics.28 close quarters constant contact among recruits needed team building allow viral infection rapidly proliferate within unit. physically mentally demanding training environment might also suppress immunity. factors typically present civilian community. Therefore, study setting limits generalisability findings settings frequency intensity exposure susceptibility host might differ.

Lastly, aware [this conveniently took index positives plotted likelihood PCR positive days since index. 0 30 days, ratio 2.85. 31 60 days, 0.74, dropping 0.29 61 90 days, finally 0.10 90 days.

Thought pretty good graphic analogy ironic crowd 95% unmasked. Yes, know probably vaccinated mess around delta, especially UK. Small significant percentages fully vaccinated people, mostly old, still get covid, go hospital, die. We've seen uk, we've seen us well. Many people robust immune response. matter?

Also tend live large households lots large indoor gatherings. Yeah, even feel first one. 

Second one hit something arm though, think bone. reasons:

1) majority British (61.9%) American (57.0%) adults fully vaccinated using vaccines highly effective even respect Delta variant. Pfizer's efficacy hospitalisation death estimated 96% AstraZeneca's 92%. adults pose negligible public health risk, breakthrough rates estimated 0.01%-0.05%.

2) American British citizens face considerable obstacles - particularly regards testing quarantine requirements - even essential travel two countries irrespective vaccination status. leads waste testing resources logistically financially problematic.

3) LHR-JFK LHR-LAX two busiest important international air routes, carrying 4.7 million people annually. Travel US UK multi-billion-dollar industry supports incredibly high number livelihoods significant economic sector represents important revenue source countries well many cities (London, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco Miami, particular) countries particularly hurt pandemic shutdown international travel. Financial resources continue supporting individuals businesses affected loss travel thinning.

4) Delta already US rapidly growing. dominant strain due course irrespective opening air corridor people pose much risk anyway. would sweet accurate Far pessimistic take, opinion. Better data obviously come coming months, [this cites preliminary mRNA efficacy ~90% Delta. major difference vs. variants. concern largely Delta contagious among unvaccinated think unlikely dynamic accordingly lead US policymakers reimplementing restrictions vaccinated people. Thank much news, surge cases started couple weeks ago. Half cases last 4-5 days.

I think new ones counted here. past week 35,204 cases, reach total 111,157.

Yup. many people getting self-righteous jollies suffering people that’s wrong. lot unvaxxed straight bamboozled leAdeRs told guard freedumbs got vaccine behind closed doors.  exact arguments made UK variant. time vaccination rate n US much lower. much ado nothing then, now.  approved yet likely be. children included initial trials. believe they're ongoing currently. trained sociologist (which feel like consulted announcements like this?)

Take vaccines stay away majority USA 🇺🇸 Hundreds cases day barely anything, much better Japan shut borders thousands cases day. organize workplace outside beurocracy existing unions 74% population county vaccinated, surrounding counties it’s 70%. herd immunity. isn’t frankly don’t care. wearing mask longer. 79% symptomatic cases - that's 79% testing positive, whether symptomatic not. Pfizer vaccine 88% effective symptomatic cases. sure hope so. destruction done keeping home astronomical, almost incalculable. Thanks detailed response  That's misinterpretation 96% efficacy hospitalization means. means 4% likely unvaccinated person end hospital. **purely hypothetically** 5% unvaccinated people catch covid go hospital, 5% times 4% gives 0.2% - 1 500 - vaccinated people hospital.

edit: mean 1 500 *who catch it* though. Much protection hospitalization comes protection catching first place. could cut spread even still precautions place. 10 wouldnt exist. People weak suppressed immune systems, like cancer, pregnant, certain immunosuppressant drugs benefit vaccinated degree people optimally functioning immune systems do. simply respond adequate response. Also, children young vaccinated risk certain medical conditions. every reason young, healthy people get vaccinated. Even get covid, antibodies last forever. Vaccine induced antibodies long lasting, possibly years life. Come on, long sub? Yeah... that's point vaccines, good numbers.  Universal making quite effective reducing r0. figure 3, range 10-50x less likely infected universal masking 100x masks n95s.

Don't knock masks much, masks quite effective reducing r0. still would love know receive antibodies covid antibodies vaccinated... Safeway Bay Area morning. Everyone store masks on. Except employees.

I've seen get screwed times, hospital contract them, travel area hospital drops contract whatever reason. wasted time money go somewhere else. sign somewhere awful, dont many options getting unless pay break contract.

That's part work. prevent company hiring lower paid firing higher paid. seniority allows promotion picking jobs shifts. 
Negative mediocre workers get promoted longer love idea vaccinated-only indoor venues, everyone opportunity get one.  looks like, U.S., people chance vaccine, many refuse get it.  Canada, vaccine supply limited recently, catching quickly uptake high compared U.S.

I long wondering situation everyone wants fully vaccinated.  public private businesses able make vaccination condition employment? healthcare least, seems like brainer, expect lots lawsuits human rights complaints.

I feel like businesses least able make rules staff patrons based vaccination status, making masks mandatory people unwilling unable show proof vaccination. verifiable, globally recognized vaccination proof another challenge. 

And kids, yet fully tested approved vaccine. 

I think interesting times. fun lasted bois. last round deaths monitored, going back February, deaths hospitalizations made .13% cases. However, small number, 42% fully-vaxxed, 50 years old.

The article goes surmise it’s old people vaxxed make higher share deaths get wrong. I'm hiding inside fear. beginning worked pandemic. business closed shutdown 0 days. know gonna ever 100% effective. think MMR vaccine got like 7th grade 100% effective worry way COVID society falls line comes MMR shot. days COVID, much. information fingertips really gone long way educating experts know vaccines DaNgErOuS whatever.

So fact people walking around COVID also practicing extra personal hygiene (as COVID) tells spread probably uncontrolled height pandemic. difference people A) vaccinated B) temporarily immune already COVID. since feel health restrictions lifted everyone begrudgingly following health orders threw window went back old ways, think question believe keep defenses up. mean people refusing vaccination.

Yes, breakthrough cases single digit % number get hospitalized even lower. want one them. think means need restrictions anymore think definitely continue worry whether someone chooses wear mask. We've shown function society even everyone walking around wearing masks I'm sure problem someone continues wear one.

As side note, since nothing fucking changed we're still disgusting people whole (worldwide), we're still gonna people showing work sick. Would question someone who, case, chose wear mask would suggest stay home? mask good enough sounds like continuing restrictions.  Lol don’t care. Fully vaccinated. gonna put mask anti-vaxers getting sick. Kids? Kids people. like we've seen delta variant virus mutates. variant US mostly (that know I'm skeptical) harmless kids, variants devastating kids like one South America. Brazil think was. could come here. Unlikely considering humans reservoir influenza viruses call intermission sure. Herd immunity. going run course. normal world, wearing masks big deal. People Asia long time last heard, people dying low oxygen. reason, masks become sort boogie man. weirdest thing fight ever experienced. county also 70+% (my family friend group) still wear masks dense indoor areas. One still get covid, vaccines makes less deadly. I’d rather get all. Meanwhile PA lifted mandate 🙃 see 80 speed limit abu dhabi thats limit , see 80 dubai go 100 O\_o cause erectile dysfunction. I'm country mixing vaccines currently (although things changing daily...) wondering recommended time mixed doses countries? Thanks :)

**Dose 1**: AZ ; **Dose 2:** Pfizer/Moderna Bascially delta variants makes contact tracing hard. NSW would normally rely contact tracing. Health insurance companies denying coverage hospital stays. premium paying bills I’m one got shot avoid going hospital? 4 times population. far adequate.  That's good! 18 month old son. whole thing sucked. Hardly anyone met hes already walking. New parents got shafted. don’t think it’s medical science. wouldn’t trust sociologist make vaccine. Denmark done great job securing doses people. manage buy Pfizer doses per capita large EU country, also thinking outside box get even doses. 

This shorten vaccination time Denmark 3 weeks. could got moderea j j. Much faster tried. That's good.

Actually germany ahead pretty much time pretty much using vaccine coming instead storing second shots. Thats germany higher rates denmark countries like italy months subsequently people receiving second shots - resulting less first shots. think quite likely denmark currently starting reduce amount vaccines stored second shots therefore able temporarily reach higher percentage people one shot. take look total doses per inhabitant, denmark unsurprisingly bit slower original wedding October 2020 cancelled. already booked honeymoon trip US October 2021, remained hopeful made decision move wedding US family &amp; friends, that's even looking unlikely.

That's think requests society-wide mitigation measures likely fall deaf ears. 

Responsible people happily done right thing 15 months, including getting vaccine, effort protect everyone around us. request continue things basically protect irresponsible people refuse get vaxxed following mitigation measures themselves? thanks. dose angiotensin 2 infusions nanograms using professional pharmacy expensive professional equipment.

NYT decided use sympathy story goes back prison “she won’t boys anymore men” beyond ruined lot families never kids they’re dead. Also article:

Antibodies triggered two Chinese vaccines less effective Delta compared variants, Feng Zijian, former deputy director Chinese Center Disease Control Prevention, told state media last week.

Feng provide details including name two vaccines.  one thing that's actually getting better, decade decade, despite mass shootings etc.? Wonder they'll skip ""Xi"" variant special reasons... ya kick mah fellas??? Dirty pool mister, dirty pool. world suck hard? mean, could **not** paywall information global plague? really hard bellends five minutes? study actually say well. focus number antibodies, acknowledge many factors play allow AZ vaccine continue effective. Yep. stay other's way everything's gravy.  HATE fellow Angelenos! take freakin shot! grandma it, boomer parents too. could literally reach herd immunity like SF ppl stopped whining &amp; complaining actually thought right thing once. Instead want go &amp; live Best Life, covid damned.  way would care decided even though wanna deny seriousness virus, deny effectiveness masks/vaccines, etc., STILL wanted protect case carrying virus asymptomatic.  Utah mask free, everywhere kids, yo even covered Indian media I'm little loop this, Delta variant seen much spread US? seen real surges recently outside highly unvaccinated areas.

We want wait see much spread US. Experts already warning become dominant strain contagious is, best thing act like already is. Despite early warning signs, US response initial pandemic slow, people seem keen repeat history. Well guess it’s different part everyone area doesn’t really wear mask.. far deadly viruses vaccines for. Somehow covid one gets us apparently.

Is another virus that's killed 600k Americans year?  Dang, definitely taking precautions that.  Surprised heard it. mask mandate back on? vaccine efficacy? many people picking vaxxed? comment suggests vaccinated people spreading virus reality causing exponential decay.

I year COVID nursing SF. lived belly beast like you. sent back normal floor due lack need vaxxed. I'm sorry people dumber there, they've made decisions. True. wonder much certainty study holds CEO Pfizer said third dose would needed 12 months, new contagious Delta variant I’m suburban Chicago county one highest vaccination rates state. Almost one wears mask anymore. Maybe anti-vaxxers already COVID 🤫 lick outside mask taking off, then. Easy problem solve  someone traveled parts East Asia, there's stigma wearing masks.  People mind part much. Southeastern corner. Monroe right Mobile County SW part state.

I think rest centralish Really? I'm San Diego I'm still seeing least 50% people wearing masks. I’ve heard sept approval maybe approaching point longer take extra steps protect take steps protect themselves. I’m assuming many people are, well. Ggwp bolsy. Unfortunately, wear masks they're collecting germs unmasked outside them. reckon surely need booster shots new mRNA vaccines new variants

Ok there’s protection existing variants, coming. eligible yet yes. matter think parent choice mine. asking I'm going mask up? required, otherwise no. US. states like 32% getting much higher point. Unfortunately I’m emt SoCal.  find article saying Covid infection reduced sperm quality.  I'm seriously fucking confused this. idea believe point.  silver lining ever saw one. Hmmm.

I’m cal surprised less 25% encountered supermarkets masked. glad get back Bay Area seems like least 75% masked. keep wearing mask! reason everyone easy way police mask wearing unvaccinated. I’m , generally don’t bother masks anymore see someone one talk I’ll put one . agree 100%, unfortunately still pandemic virus evolving ravaging parts world. Correct I'm wrong but.... optometry considered medical doctor?

Either way, absolutely report whatever board certified by. It’s almost like it’s ongoing, ever changing situation modify behavior Also, least one twenty kids (or maybe much more) get COVID get “long Covid”, could mean lifelong health issues. It’s awfully cavalier okay two million kids (330 MM times 12% divided 20) catching virus gives long term health Put another way, every 5% kids 12 long COVID you’re looking 2 million plus symptoms range breathing difficulties bedridden. taking much seriously.

So you’re assuming ~40 million Americans 12, estimating ~40 million contract Covid, 1/20th (2 million) get long Covid? Seriously, 4-5 year olds going spread, catch, Covid-19 unless parents aren’t vaccinated? stopped. 

It's matter CDC saying so. matter vaccinated, peer group vaccinated, low community transmission I'm at. Objectively, low risk I'm low risk passing onto other.

If vaccine-resistant strain starts circulating, I'll re-evaluate. then, feel secure choice. 

(To clear, say judgment decided continue wearing masks) thought would welcome post fearmongering covid-19 long term consequences.
I remember study claiming 70 percent showed heart damage COVID-19 turned false , gave lot people got case COVID-19 needlessly anxiety . Shhhh understand single focused message time.

I wish joke? they're taking care kids lack responsibility fall anyone else? I'm sorry, that's choice parent's choice. 

I problem wearing mask, I'm tired people. want mask up, want socially distance, want quarantine, said overblown hoax, want get vaccine get kids vaccinated. taking seriously day one. care lives ones love I?  Finland varies city, many opened 16+ couple weeks ago added every week. Finland ahead Sweden first doses (58% vs 44% population) Finland using 12 week interval doses since January. Really?? went Trader Joe’s yesterday LA half half masks  USA, things significantly better CDC said that. right here. Got comfortable family vaccinated told kids family party - it’s okay masks.

Well, 3 symptoms chills, sore throat, runny nose, fever days party. Yeah, imagine freak out. get tested Covid. Thankfully cold.

Masks back till they’re vaccinated. Still wearing mine Dallas. trust strangers. [The gap 1+ doses \(55%\) fully vaccinated \(47%\) looks smallest since vaccination started. keep mind non-zero portion gap people waiting second shot: looks like ~11m people received first shot past 3 weeks, makes half gap. It'd work roughly 1/14 people stopping 1 dose only. Yeah 90% mask wearers supermarket  moved Oregon Denver December stopped Boise ""halfway"" spot. Remember December pretty horrifying. M'fers everywhere even pretending wear masks.

Like, society news comes says ""flu outbreak"" put masks go target. people give flying anything. Australia population: 25.36 million - Covid deaths - 910

Florida population: 21.48 million - Covid deaths - least 37,772

Doing real good Florida.

There's also lot draconian moves going Florida related making rich richer everyone else poorer among things. That’s tipping point - honestly I’m one dude masked place, that’s cool I’m one choosing it. people don’t can’t make em plus probably vaxxed guidance basically said you’re vaccinated relax. leave alone eh? would wearing whatever mask anyone’s business?  claim isn’t flu wiped out, one variant branch was.

This could potentially helpful flu vaccine development one fewer possible variant mix.

I think shows capable of, willing. Human history series missed opportunities. Sauce?
Please  kidding. swear pandemic exposed fact schools need teach logical fallacies better kind flu strain something besides covid going around? Hearing vaccinated folks bronchitis mild infection *something*


It's odd  Sacrifices? protect wearer, though Thank you. needs said more. angry scared? can't tell! Lots people still wearing DFW.  want defend title! period 1st 2nd dose? Since looking life go normal okay roam around mask one shot? Thank much detailed response, read them.

How see situation government pushing vaccination people already seropositive and/or children lowest risk covid disease? drug 100% safe including vaccines, always risk/benefit analysis consider factors like (already immune, young children etc)

Unfortunately feels everything/one become politicised turned us vs mentality. People seem willing throw individuals box limited information. Labels like conspiracy theorist antivaxer thrown without even bothering consider other.

Some people educated this, don’t know research mRNA immunity - may see hear statement way know veracity it. may scared childrens health. Throwing box harm good. 

It seems like lot people trust hear group see someone go it, happy chastise them, even though know little actual details. Dogmatism good. Open dialogue people need engage - open means genuinely curious other’s thoughts - don’t see current situation, it’s sad fuck.

I believe vaccines work safe, different vaccines, different types, different bodies, different brains… things CANNOT know, like long term issues. say know wrong.

People decided think, group says so, encounter possible difference opinion, google quotes articles group support opinion - I’m glad realise that’s evidence relying mode thinking.

Like global warming, people go crazy limited knowledge actual details. included, don’t pretend like know shit it, say “well read there’s strong consensus generally trust scientists it’s probably right don’t know, I’d go look evidence can’t understand evidence properly (like statistical significance, measuring protocols, proxies, jargon etc) I’ll try acquire knowledge. point, accept don’t know shit.

For it’s worth, announcement isn’t mandate, it’s “strong recommendation” or....just make mandatory ridiculous. Unless medical reason mandatory. dumb. wearing mask protect coronavirus. follow science. almost food safety covered FDA USDA.

I bet CDC guidelines paying taxes either, I'm judging that. letter asterisk ""id*iots"" represent? open people living specific areas, open ""all citizens 18"".

One region Sweden opened 18+ well (Norrbotten), 20 regions not. UK now. still mask mandate bet lots people still wear mandate lifted. plan still wear mine shopping/on public transit long can. wear work I’m literally teacher wearing one. I’m around old people babies lot whatever infect anyone. don’t think understand efficacy means. It’s reduction odds infection. It’s determined dividing number infections treatment group number infections control group. mean “5% time, get Covid.” 

My point is, hasn’t published case studies showing infected, vaccinated person transmitted virus others. Maybe something published that’s asked. seen yet. 

That doesn’t stop people making claim fact though.  seems like fantastic way get people get vaccinated. Horrible idea. Kids low risk gets covid always been. That's confusing text fig. 6 efficacy masks control airborne transmission demonstrated found face masks effective worn infected exposed individuals; **any person wearing mask significantly reduces risk infection.**

I'd personally get N95 double mask paper cloth, heard approaches quality N95.

Also fuck coworkers boss. truly giant among humans. I’d say that’s am. remember LA County huge, mask behavior gonna vary city city, neighborhood neighborhood. Lmao swear god, like one fucking stupid high school group projects again, people willing make least effort three times actual work quarter third everyone can't even bothered fucking show up. saying you’re upset people won’t wear mask winter precautions flu? you’re mad people won’t wear masks 6 months Covid still circulating? aren’t effed honest , lot unfortunate deaths non convinced follow Steve Edwards Cox Health Twitter consistently shares hospital census data. It’s insane hospitalizations come vaccinated. predictable way, numbers shares make wonder anyone would decline vaccination. know vaccinated relative hospital Delta right complicating health factors vaccination saved certain death IMO. lol missouri everyone got vaccine wouldn’t issue.  lol taken vaccine say 🤷🏼‍♂️ catch  IFR 

less .01% sucks mandate 

pick 1 Living following public health officials, difference May 18 June 1 enough make nervous. numbers since June 1 mean social media feed full J&amp;J recipients opting get Pfizered also maskless unvaccinated people Olympic trials week. I’m really tired mad body shitty antibody production giving cancer teen living state. seems responsible you. good parent it’s great mindful parents. can't. mean work makes will. stores make will. Otherwise not. Never fan mask wearing. say fully recognizing friend’s situation rare, mention don’t think people realize young, healthy, fully vaccinated still get Covid get sick. said she’s never sick entire life. caught Covid couple months received second Moderna shot. Again, believe rare still concerning. I'm vaccinated got tested started experiencing symptoms. stayed home experiencing symptoms even negative covid test. wear mask indoors. 

I pretty much could situation 🤷‍♀️ God hate living LA much. seriously considering leaving state. go back lockdown, that's going seal deal I'm going move NV AZ. Enjoy superiority. I've put time stopping pandemic you. I'm getting back life.  win argument claim win. Good luck life.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* don’t see I’m going able show you. Figure 6 shows scenario high risk - unmasked coworkers masked.   true. stopped week two, wearing indoors b.c Delta. Yes.  Agreed. Actually, we've talking abstracts since responded ""I believe science"" insinuated 90-95% efficacy perfectly good threshold drop mandates vaccinated people. arrogant?

[I stand words top epidemiologist top hospital. I'm arrogant. believe S.E. Wisconsin unmasked masked places. vaccination rate county 40%. still go fully masked everywhere public, even though Pfizer shots. think enough known yet Delta variant, couple kids young get vaccinated. want take chances. know that, short term trials simply long enough rule immortality Obviously masks perfect, everything gets caught outside eventually seeps would gone straight mouth/nose first time around without mask. doubt using mask becomes less effective, though. Sure, likely ""possible"" exceedingly rare. 

The rate infection vaccinated people low, let alone rates hospitalization death. getting sick dying point contagious, vaccines upwards 90% effective preventing, think vaccinated people mostly good.

Obviously people live high risk groups can't get vaccinated need take precautions, though. 600k extra people died last year because...? helps all, figure 6 good place start. wild. local Toms go Gardena telling day wear mask. asking remove since restrictions gone. kept left. That's example virus humans (whether infect us yet chance), one mutated deadly. Unless evidence virus infecting humans prior 2019? Why? interpretation someone fully vaccinated science base of? go store right get vaccine US. vaccinated, generally fault minus small subset population. risk incredibly low fully vaccinated, delta variant based every study done far. Hi there, wanted try help little advice. I'm American, living another country really vaccines yet requires everyone wear face mask face shields (those dentist things) times whether inside outside. I'm also asthmatic, abnormally small lungs, lung disease, get panic attacks, somewhat claustrophobic.

Wearing masks hard. feeling breathing hot air (the country I'm 90-100F time) feeling trapped inside it. one thing helped get remember take slow. Americans, especially living big cities, I'm used rushing around everything. rush wearing mask, breathe hot air hate more.

So can, slow down. Walk slowly (preferably shade air conditioned building). Relax best can. Take cold water bottle take sips frequently. Every little bit helps. Together get pandemic, uncomfortable. Thank wearing mask even though difficult, fellow humans appreciate it. Every cloud ...Free entry Glastonbury, toilet duty.... I'm sorry downvoted, nothing said deserves it. sympathethize position. also panic disorder sometimes triggered masks. made public spaces incredibly touch-and-go past year half. Thankfully I'm privileged able WFH it, otherwise know would've done. fact people freaking variant makes feel starting 0 think mentally take strain, masks included. sad truth. Thank you. Screw nytimes paywall vaccine maker rather country's health authority made decision large interval. thinking best use slow delivery doses -- provide double number people protection first dose, rather half number first second dose short time interval (~4 wks). thought CDC thought would create pressure get innoculated vaccinations would go up. decision makers CDC touch American life. reversal it’s year half life isn’t worth living shutter inside hid face. doubt start exporting vaccine soon every Canadian wants vaccine got one. probably wait month accumulate small stockpile exporting rest. Even US start exporting extra doses right away. Fascinating, thanks taking time reply :) There's huge difference vaccinated testing positive vs vaccinated developing symptoms. vaccine produce sterilizing immunity. potential limited replication lungs immune system responds. replication picked PCR generally harmless you, far studies shown infectious state. long vaccine last tho? I’m 6 months word get booster. Anyone know ? issue timing, think several weeks early. made call drop 3 weeks national vaccine rollout 18+ late April, week approved 12+. takes 5-6 weeks fully covered, qualify impossible fully vaxxed. waited ~6 weeks 12+ group approved, would allow big group people time get full coverage, plus let cases drop even more. know people tired them, rush end mask use early really fumbled best case trajectory. even indeterminate schedule, weird notion would incentivize people rather let anti-maskers run free without repercussions. me. 

If vaccinated\* folks want still wear mask, truly think that's great. me, feel like I've done part past year half. 

The vaccine effective every variant that's arisen far. peer group vaccinated. somebody run still unvaccinated far likely catch somebody else who's unvaccinated me.

Obviously, I'll wear mask required, give anyone grief wearing one. I'm ready move on.

(\*If vaccinated, 1) get vaccinated, 2) wear mask fully vaccinated) Search Delta+ Variant one really knows made point. prevention live life whole world going hell. *cries American🥲 Except part vaccination stop infection/transmission anyway so.. what's point again? No? making claim. offering place might find they're asking for.  

This sub pretty toxic days. Nothing? read thread issue adult vaccination came well car ride precautions example. seems ascribing bad faith arguments there. 

If advocating every adult eligible get vaccinated page.  really dear friend London love much, wish could see feel like never point oh yeah lol totally mods pricks usual edited thought 90%- 100% lethal scores around long time. said, conclusive something I've HIV. 

And yes, examples got lethal. current virus cases COVID one. kill anyone 2019. single person. also gotten deadly last year. change societal fundamental public life group almost never gets hurt one that’s already high risk every disease

God. kind world people want live in? survive trying stupid us death. never stopped I'm ugly af  one runs mower behind tractor. cloth medical/surgical. surgical ones feel better depending brand I’ve still prone panic. I’m sure it’s claustrophobia sensory overload face (non-sensitive material, hot breath blocking back me, ears tugged on, etc) causing it. work job still required wear masks enforce mask wearing everybody building. life got whole lot harder CDC made announcement lot people argumentative masks.

Edit: clarify, anecdotally speaking, antivaxxers masking minimal complaint. there’s lots complaining people. Sorry downvoted burying head sand. even UK, hospitalizations remained stable. public health directors said vaccines broken chain COVID severe disease. wave different waves we’ve experienced since first “wave” least 50% (much higher areas) fully vaccinated. recent Public Health England study1 found people one vaccine dose 75% less likely hospitalized, compared unvaccinated individuals, fully protected 94% less likely hospitalized.

Thanks article illuminating. think 2 3 shifted some. individually protected also likely spread masking vaccinated people always about. I’m gonna hospitalized give unvaccinated toddler someone else. masked necessarily unvaccinated. got first shot January masked long work lets don’t want catch shit y’all passing around, also doctor wants nasty immunosuppressants starting soon insurance company pulls head ass (to fair, expensive nasty immunosuppressants), masks lesser two evils here. “Probably there”

So evidence want people look stuff might exist type masks wear? uncomfortable cloth one fit correctly really annoying. surgical ones lighter breath better use now. live area mild temperatures tho sure it'd like hot humid climate.  2 weeks… lot people cannot get vaccine various reasons. nobody 12 US vaccinated Delta higher transmission.  

I mean, fucking sucks wearing mask inside still right call. Yeah still lot mask use west side never took off. know it’s 100% costs little yet could save someone’s life (I’m vaccinated even get it’s extremely improbable die)  Society needs move hell ask vaccinated ass mask fall again, I’ll join bumpkins protested last fall diarrhea 2-3 solid days

not sure days *solid* then... 😳 UAE like USA sense emirate rules regulations. non-covid examples differences: don’t need permit buy alcohol Abu Dhabi, Dubai emirate Sharja dry. Emirates speed buffer listed max speed indication you’re triggered fine, Abu Dhabi doesn’t; buffer added top max limit you’re dinged you’re caught going even 1km/hr more. one think could possibly case #3 incorrect. seen evidence effect move society point. Dear god it’s year half people   yes, got covid tested immediately reading new delta variant got paranoid % protected Pfizer.

I also learned lesson everyone around (including people caught cold) convinced ""allergies""... made realize people ruling delta variant spreading God knows what. I’m going completely honest, cannot handle wearing mask. It’s humiliating can’t wear one without panic attack public can’t openly express wearing mask gives legitimate anxiety without people thinking I’m sort anti-vaxx, anti-mask asshole. I’m not. There’s something masks sets off. I’ve barely survived little year wearing mask public several panic attacks near panic attacks anytime would about. got vaccine soon could. CDC said didn’t wear mask anymore, elated I’ve recently started panic public anymore. hate idea go back wearing one. legitimately don’t know I’ll handle it. It’s hard. I’ll put back safety everyone but…this sucks. Sir, Wendy’s Don’t fall base rate fallacy. 100 percent people vaccinated, 100 percent covid cases would fully vaccinated sure ""cold""?  Minneapolis, county quite vaccinated, LOT people stopped wearing inside wasn’t required. assume least vaccinated least. vaccinated, listen them, right.

So, plenty vax time everyone get vaccinated. people think we're going wear masks 5 years continue try convince morons get vaccinated drop dead.
When would end?

The real problems unvaccinated besides unvaccinated. vaccinated far, far less likely infect them. find evidence, let know! go again.  wear masks forever. I'll wear em - airport plane, when's end? going away evidence vaccinated people get covid, that's 5% represents. However i'm aware evidence one way whether vaccinated people get covid spread it.  real, thanks.  We'll see.

Take close look England. They're vaxxed rate are, cases currently increasing exponentially. Johnson vowed open July 19th, we'll see bad gets there. One thing come realization microbiology precise accurate, science public health awareness education severely lacking. fun waiting. Must fun living fear what's front door. That's precisely why. India. Much less natural immunity. young mostly unvaccinated, immunity there.  Sir, tolerate racist behaviour plane.  Long story short antibodies found bone marrow  actually stopped ""cdc said"" I'm vaccinated. I'm starting kept seeing articles. Lol J&amp;J fucking at? JFC, like information use unicorns. make interesting point. frail unheard beings Earth? tells site came Google get around paywall. sites allow clicks directly Google skip paywall Google remove search results reduces number people find website. extension tells site ""hey Google Reddit"" allow skipping paywall. Policy implemented ""common sense"". data-driven.  oh poor thing. im sorry hear that. one live nebraska. caught cold family member. Learned lesson I'm happy throw mask again. I'm also vaxxed.   USA #1!!! made bestest deadliest covid strain, beat delta!!! scariest thing dinguses vote. Reliably. Meanwhile Texas…… lol Exact same! thought one! Recently I’ve able smell bad things like trash, garbage disposal, burning etc. took forever still way right.  Failed metric? whole much safer economically prosperous world.

Just look many countries leading edge vaccination bring restrictions counter delta. Herd immunity vaccination 80% region right? Even government fucked vaccine rollout would best interest maintain covid zero lockdown border closures. Honest question, last week going narrative ""If vaccinated heavily vaccinated area, fine. Unvaccinated people high risk"". 

From I've asserted thanks many fine people sub:

1) California, LA, relatively heavily vaccinated comparison areas

2) Vaccinated people highly protected (yes, 100%) variant

3) Vaccinated people, general, spread high viral loads variant coronavirus.

Are assertions longer correct? mandate happening vaccinated people mask-less, unvaccinated people follow? Jesus pathetic ignores actual science California showing…

Here South really two shifts day night 12 hours 

And don’t worry doctors actually start real work; pay increase come. least that’s I’m hoping for….    like flu would get grade school!  lost 5 days hourly-wage work! COVID's still living head rent-free struggle pay rent! Same. brief man rough two days. one first work get fully vaccinated went warned everyone take time got theirs. 

Out 20 people, ONE person rough time it. 18 side effects beyond sore arm. annoying.    Give man Bells!  Cooks?  Vaccinate people front line workers regardless old are. forty year old office worker works home less risk 22 year old bartender. understand vaccinating elderly people risk it’s unfair let people twenties bars thirty year olds can. Let’s hope don’t get Omega  people. trust government vaccine. lot gossips vaccine kill harm future childs. They'd better buy fake certificate getting vaccine actually get free available one.  I’ll get booster it’s recommended, I’m worrying it. One trip pharmacy per year small price pay getting Covid. absurd sub became antimask overnight cdc changed guidance. mean.. optional messaging followed beginning. 100%, want go way put mine test yet. numbers get precautions still taken, delta variant still gaining foothold. lol  I’m fully vaccinated, part problem? concerned kids I'd recommend keeping indoor crowds wear masks. Also children large risk, studied proven again. one forgot them. agree this, part part stayed home/always masked first year thing. I'm Denver 70% vaxxed worn mask public several weeks. *want* go back wearing mask, also feel super confused point whether really necessary not. We're really getting concrete advice experts. lot people thread saying important still mask up; can't tell they're overly careful point (because lot agoraphobics/overly concerned people height pandemic imo). really something still doing, also feel like what's even point anymore?? 90% people gone back ""normal"" I'm sure little old wearing mask even makes difference. We're kind past point mitigation we?  I’ve worn mask, I’ve supported use, state 200 day vs 4000 March, I’m wearing mask random chance contact antivaxxer immuno comped person. knew risks eat anything else, again, may sound callous, is.

The question third booster would help. check county’s daily case rate every while, it’s like 5/100,000 don’t take precautions, even around strangers. Higher would careful around strangers, would still take precautions around people know vaccinated, chances one us giving another extremely low. answer first question, St. Cloud. wouldn’t surprise anyone Twin Cities area learn happened St. Cloud.

Thanks! Helps put risk context makes feel less worried personally delta variant.

I’ve twice nothing happened. I’ve cough exist two days it. 18 months. Vaxxed finally feeling good wear mask. see LA worried many places reinstitute mandates vaccinated people. that’s case, say theoretically 100% population except immunocompromised vaccinated, still wear masks?
I don’t really understand line thinking here. You’re making vaccinated protecting personally flair indicates you’re fully vaccinated. sure hope so. Redondo. Went Vons last week; maybe 3 25ish people mask on. Nobody bevmo one except me. Current estimates say 80k-150k Brazilian deaths due Bolsonaro mishandling pandemic, hard estimate level certainty Yeah rent like $1400 single, small room... Wearing mask sick reasonable. Always wearing mask there's chance pass immunocompromised person not. Seriousness aside - stays hot right now, don’t want go outside summer. Hell  There*

You sound little callous, especially mask almost hindrance. agree need move on. wearing mask big deal make big deal,you come self centered. Even intention. coalesce fact vaccine hesitancy much higher minorities, pro form discrimination?

Are racist, care? real difference information readily available.

Discoverys change happen constantly. Americans really? ""if willing wear mask, take outside begin with"" truly wonder age group 0.8% (fully vaccinated deaths) in.  LA even surge warrant clearly thought EvilBob. meant options Ireland considering. know opening everything isn’t going happen. Forget protecting unvaxxed (at least willfully unvaxxed; people can’t medical age reasons protected). Delta’s shown infect kill fully vaxxed people I’m wearing mask protect idiots. 

Yes, risk far less since got shots it’s nothing huge number anti-vaxxers anti-maskers area means far many times I’ll talking risk. Might well continue tip odds favor. Cuz life isn’t computer? 2 secs ain’t gonna make much difference, life random rhyme reason, polite isn’t inefficiency never said that. said sad. certain specific numbers I'm certain actual rate hospitalization baseline, key takeaway yes fully vaccinated well protected bad outcomes. fair, Missouri never encouraged masking. I'd like turn around, mind? think advantage unreadable daily thread, (currently 29 A4-pages long) info separated single threads neat headings?

I think Corona virus kind important topic, obviously warrant single sub people talk it. Florida, Texas, Georgia main states stopped giving crap June 2020. nuts waiting go anyone random thing. nothing wrong.

Years ago grocery store trying grab one last item cooler arms instead going back basket (dumb, always get basket). guy decides hold cooler door open me, said thank you, came kind squeak. Guy proceeds start screaming bloody murder ungrateful - gtfo fast possible avoided store afterwards. happened COVID came along, viral infections.  herd immunity part problem solution. go you. frankly care. see ""we know who's lying y'all honest keep this."" guess difference opinion then.

Edit: spelling No, they're slightly average terms getting vaccine. Springfield, MO, lower hospitalizations rate peak pandemic February higher ICU rates. Death rates lag TBD.  people (VERY vocal here) never wanted masks taken off. Possibly ever interactions i've them.  suppose unclear, bad. Though never used word permanent. saying now, indoors mask use still good call. permanent basis I'm talking masking days sick. left something list though. Vaccines quite good preventing spreading Covid others. Much better masks. kids can’t get vaccinated, wouldn’t safest thing stay outside? kids going crowded indoor places  shut international flights . understand report Israel right, seems like vaccines effective keeping people getting particular variant (although apparently still help keep getting seriously ill), maybe not.  Yeah, But..!!  buy sell guns anywhere anytime, take yer guns anyplace want. Hell could shoot anyone COVID help stop spread…. Welcome Misery. This. Is. A. DISASTA!

Is true? report comparing age groups COVID strains? Really? There's single comment page ""panicking"" - everyone saying story blown proportion. one quoted article panicking, extreme reaction ""We play safe case.""

I've read related threads - worst I've seen ""I'm still wearing mask"" They're really trying hard kill economics. remember run go remote places, even consider it. wild Americans worked masks openly agitate amounts biological warfare part society. First largely right leaning partisan *COVID deniers* left leaning partisan *science believers* seem want get back them. Wearing mask hard, really big deal. feels like manifestation highly divided society *wants* tear apart. Pfizer Moderna given LOT people J&amp;J Got Astrazeneca one month ago.Kinda hoping mRNA one.My luck! much, much less. unlucky get breakthrough infection even doubly unlucky still spread despite much lower viral load vaccination without. We're talking exceptions exceptions think that's much reason concern. wrong, honestly point though think anyone willing get vaccinated did. think CNN chance convincing anyone, informing people actually believe them. good luck anti-vaxxers FFP3 European equivalent N99 (filters least 99% particles 0.3 microns diameter larger). hospital upgraded surgical masks.


I'm curious would seen results FFP2/N95/KN95, jumped straight FFP3. seems like main conclusion fitted respirator necessary hospital setting, instead loosely fitting surgical mask that's really designed protect wearer. Dropping mask mandate encourage people wasn’t probably good idea. policy flip flop really come cost trust. told info took kid test. “We daycare doesn’t mean anything unless they’ve symptoms three days still sick need come back get tested again.” Probably best waste doses cause probably enough later I'm guessing they'll vaccinate people covid second shot  Kids spread adults. big goal extinguishing virus combination vaccines good behavior.

I agree OP's ""roll dice"" silly, right extrapolate consider cost protective measures.

I wear seatbelt every single time drive, despite never serious accident. Wearing mask similar level inconvenience -- nearly zero. It'd silly argue saving lives hospitalizations effectively zero cost wearer.

The cost never driving significant area. wear seatbelt dramatically reduce risk death. also avoid drinking driving, even though yet another mild inconvenience.

It's size dice, also many times going roll it. drive 4 times day, multiply out. potentially exposed Delta 4 times day, multiply out. 

Unless eliminate it, kid going exposed again, continue mutate well. Almost every single stock crashed March 2020. nothing name beer. 100% effective preventing anything mild symptoms... fully vaccinated get headache... (Unless immunocompromised). Please stop spreading false information Sure, that’s fair. think articles need emphasize importance getting vaccine try avoid another lockdown. strong overlap people wore mask consistently people got vaccinated. people complaining believe either circles. New England lot people wearing matter course public spaces.  Ya st cloud kinda scraping bottom barrel though Good low Australia caseload

I think underestimating rapidly change. delta variant, people really need two doses, takes 5 weeks minimum. things change (not guaranteed! also unlikely), Australia bad spot. extroverts throwing absolute fits past year society exactly way want year PANDEMIC.

Popular coffee bars stores Encinitas Carlsbad including grocery places stopped masking end rule . Masking popular here. Please please please give blood anyway, desperate right now. cancel scheduled surgeries state literally enough blood - keep minimum amount hand emergencies, surgeries require much supply currently available.

Typically buried article “oh way, vaccines still effective variant.” breakthrough infections mild. guess makes

Just 50% US fully vaccinated. understand people time we're herd immunity levels yet Delta raised ceiling. 

I try fear monger also pretend covid gone. Everyone dismissive I'm remind everyone stay safe. think likely courts side employers require vaccines data comes efficacy vaccines variants.

I wish Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J formal FDA approval school started, thing preventing colleges requirement they're still technically EUA only.  Don’t vaccinate kids RSV days? don’t know Nebraska, travel lot Mississippi work, masks rare entire pandemic, today, Mississippi dead last vax rates. also one worst education systems country. Probably coincidence, though. Wait people vaccinated. rush things global pandemic still raging throughout world. It'll end, yet. Patience.

Your perception people still concerned covid feasible plan logical fallacy possibly expect get covid? everywhere year.

Vaccinated not, everybody exposed covid.

I understand scared one thing(covid), yet willing participant drug trial unknown outcomes. talking about?

The vaccines effective Delta, second shot. know long effective for.

The government ordered boosters months ago, long Delta variant. Whether *need* unknown vaccines new. know long would take immunity wear off? Nobody data yet take time think suspicious authorities mention new variant numbers vaccinated rise? Possibly avoid talking breakthrough cases?

No. believe entire global medical community planet's well educated epidemiologists conniving dastardly scheme vaccinate us spurious reasons. didn’t happen. Sources? breath always fog glasses doc file give flu shot annual without even asking me, know I'll take without hesitation. Last year got flu shot waiting doc nurse filled paperwork - even realize she'd already done put band aid.

(Arm always hurts like dickens day that, know localized immune reaction.) US like rich drunk uncle, great, fun hang lots great toys latest gadgets, cross crazy comes out. Russian government ridiculous. “COVID real. don’t get vaccinated, fired” one largest festivals country…. wonder people want vaccinate. don’t trust government. Get Pfizer/AZ/JJ/Moderna Russia lines people wanting take it. difference wanting vaccinated wanting vaccinated Sputnik calculations eliminate animal pathogen completely different eliminate one affecting humans. Culling available public health policy.  Thank you. Probably relevant countries lack supply, giving one dose many people better giving two doses fewer. One dose AstraZeneca seems around [33% symptomatic disease delta variant, likely higher severe disease/death.

Two doses efficacy 60% according study (probably 12 weeks gap doses data UK).

So, one dose may enough ""go back normal"", warrant relaxation imo.  CNN published cause news. You’ll notice quote simply quoting LA Public Health Director added note evidence shows effective. times deserved get ragged stuff published pandemic? Sure. ain’t it. sub panicking FWIW, breakthrough cases, vaccinated population is, higher percentage population gets vaccinated.

IE 100% population vaccinated get 10 new cases delta variant, 100% cases vaccinated people. basically means yes, possible vaccinated people get delta variant covid-19. tell many people vaccinated would gotten weren't. Welp, increase cases Mexico people freaking out, yet people lazy see hospitalizations still even lower number april 2020, meaning vaccines really fucking work. suspect intersection well funded, open public health system resist pressure Russia country large supply Sputnik may lacking. Everything we'll hear still come straight Russian state time yet. seems less likely impossible. think studied enough know... impossible know sure whether particular asymptomatic person infectious. likely infectious, knows infectious are. office building dropped building wide requirement past couple weeks, people work lobby still wearing them, mash-up people work offices still require (like mine government offices building) hanging elevator (they recently took goofy little stickers elevator floor telling wear stand) allow four people elevator time. thanks Sorry think holding doors people stupid. Guess can't enjoy spending time reddit dislike inefficiencies elsewhere life. got covid december day 50% smell back. need drink coffee black taste it. also cant eat chinese food anymore take leave pizza two favorite things. Doesn’t hurt get test. Ask doctor though. Yea same, live Denton I'll see maybe 2-3 people store wear mask go out. Went square weekend, see single mask. Friday night lights powerful magic rural parts country subreddit lol That's foolish you! orange county. mask free since April 2020 mean we’ve said small immunocompromised subset human population long time regarding disease. you’re risk person you’re small minority, rest world isn’t changing you, you’ve gotta take precautions yourself. 

Not saying personally think that’s best solution, don’t expect status quo change. It’s - talk. Boosters recommended point. likely need one point like many vaccines, whether that’s years months decade don’t know yet. recent data include neutralization assays additional variant strains. additional analysis showed minimal impact neutralizing titers Alpha A.23.1 variants relative ancestral strain (D614G). analysis also showed modest reduction neutralizing titers Delta (2.1-fold), Gamma (P.1, 3.2-fold), Kappa (3.3-3.4-fold), Eta (4.2-fold) variants relative ancestral strain. Consistent previous results, 7.3 8.4-fold reduction neutralizing titers observed additional versions Beta variant relative ancestral strain. Additionally, 8.0-fold reduction neutralizing titers relative ancestral strain observed A.VOI.V2, variant first identified Angola, currently designated Variant Concern Interest. 

So reading right, Moderna Vaccine isnt quite effective Beta A.VOI.V2 strain still enough cause concern? Vax life naked face life Many public health organizations - making educated bets science really complete. 

It's really important products studied individually, though. They're new. lipid nano particles(LNP) encapsulating mRNA product slightly different really important part vaccines. 

They're wrapper enhance efficacy impact safety. sure yet differences might matter might matter.  Sad. hospitals reap sow. treat front-line like garbage CEOs make obscene salaries. Okay need objective numbers tho, “explode” see it? Give specific date specific number cases think see date otherwise say, oh, went 5%, technically that’s exploding right! Look guy needs every precious second day optimized. much time spend reddit today bub? Least vaccinated state. Shocking got vaxxed past Sunday 27th. 2nd dose, felt side effects outside sore arm. wondering it’s ok start swimming 🏊‍♂️ 1 week second dose… i’m prepping competition im bit rush. so, it’s true Fully agree this. campaign unite way 9/11, everyone would've board. Near zero absolute zero, don’t enough data Delta variant regards vaccinated people. know appears infective amongst unvaccinated people dangerous children largely unvaccinated still iirc incredibly stumped ended plague rare infection time  many factors this. Tough find good information aspects look at. immunocompromised high risk *before* pandemic? remember right lockdown, seeing sick people everywhere. flu killing 60k plus people year. 

if consider vaccinated people, people *can't* vaccinated, seeing far less covid deaths normal flu season even we're mask free?

not sure understand draw line we'll immunocompromised.

fwiw, still wear mask vaccinated. wondering calculation is. Nebraska gang!!!! yes wife usually masked people go out. fully vaccinated, still know lot people lying around here, vaccinated, jack asses. didn’t sign prevent vaccinated people getting slight chance getting mild cough indefinitely, trying protect people refuse get vaccinated themselves.

Exactly. Also, sign live way INDEFINITELY. year two... ok. I'm vaccinated.. rest foreseeable future? No. COVID going away... want keep living life way I've lived since March 2020. I've done everything asked COVID vaccinated. take chances. lack sensory input cause brain atrophy areas associated senses. seems possible loss brain tissue may due virus could side effect lack smell taste. comment supports position. CDC know 40%+ population anti-vaxxers lie unmask public places CDC's new guidance. near herd immunity. still smack dab middle pandemic see infection rate rise again. fact rise slower immaterial. happens shoulders CDC. Agree That's left old company. CEO, created original product, still wanted say almost changes. 

Nevermind hired people him. focus needed future. Water wet Live Minneapolis, go shopping St Louis Park mostly. basically noticed trend office building place regularly go requires (and communal spaces), they’re lifting restrictions July 1 (and FINALLY opening gym understanding). I’ll probably still make sure one leave apartment case store requires it, definitely bus metro, since they’re still required there.  Really depends good fit mask is. Doom self righteousness. types symptoms people getting? keep seeing tons tons reports people ""testing positive"" COVID one saying ""got sick COVID"". lot asymptomatic infections?  immunocompromised persons aren’t privileged enough able fully isolate. already protected vaccine? think it’s theres enough evidence yet say vaccines giving effective variant, even though confident effective. much cannot wait get back normal, also equally cannot wait charts graphs comparing fourth fifth waves/spikes shit among unvaccinated areas “oops, maybe get vaccine all” waves remorse. Yes has. vaccines less effective Delta variant, it’s dangerous kids. much would also like return normal, won’t normal keep breeding variants. speaking person I’m California school system particularly strong. wish well well Nebraska contributing poor quality subreddit 2 reasons:

1. Saying ""everyone wear masks"" kind like saying ""unvaccinated people wear masks,"" we've seen say ""only unvaccinated people wear masks,"" means one wears masks

2. Even vaccinated, could catch covid. admittedly small likelihood, wearing mask reduces risk somewhat. Since we've year this, probably mask, may well wear Mississippi’s adult vaccination rate like 40% isn’t surprising. Still seeing high mask usage SF. 🥳 That’s exactly I’m asking. disagree limiting factors different outcome same...it's impossible make informed policy decisions bad data underlying decisions. Wait see teeming hordes ant-vax cattle. took one air-headed celebrity cow get TV claim vaccines caused calf get mad cow disease they're like, ""No shots calves! GMO corn feed, please!""  date article shared April - meant going narrative “If you’re vaccinated heavily vaccinated area, you’re fine. Unvaccinated people high risk”

That still generally true.

The Delta variant contagious deadlier. It’s also rising cases US elsewhere. article points out, lot people LA dose vaccine minority completed full course, meaning majority still vulnerable. Add unvaccinated running around maskless (let’s face it, Honor System sucks), increasing threat. That’s masks resume now.  bad. I’ll speculate want then. hear thought whole point getting vaccinated return normal life style. I’ve that. that?

I’m trying difficult, need know added delta variant actually changed risk not. ""Experts"" tended cautious people. example, saw NY Times survey showed like 80-90% epidemiologists would still mask socially distance even getting vaccinated...way people average. So, getting vaccinated still good enough least half year. chance asymptomatically spreading virus vaccinated near 0. question inviting people speculate answer proceed speculate think may mean. Yes, speculating. think limiting factor also slightly different - developed countries money/manpower it, lack political so. 

Developing countries otoh - even wanted to, simply resources so. say Sam sincerety. Think children Vaccination rates match amount people wearing masks anymore live. People putting others danger negligence. yeah, fuck people can't get shot would ignore watch TickTock videos learn social “behaviors” 

I work career function school ton trying teach people 18 years old fundamental social etiquette. Even covid exist, immunocompromised people would still need careful public places. one gives shit. Try come better scare tactic. vaccinated what’s point? think next one dubbed either “Triad” “Omega”

Of course, “Delta Plus, Plus” still table solution vaccinate children that's it, there's nothing else really done that.  Fully vaccinated - still gotta wear masks? people sick tired shit IL. one pocket check every establishment going see specific guidelines. needed one like 1/20 places. think too. proportion people may actually exhaling virus catch body kills quickly. must people mild asymptomatic infection, even know slight infection body kills - people ever exhale virus? so, exhaled small amounts, short time, tests miss it?  surise St Cloud. never understand wearing mask wearing mask became part peoples personality. Don’t worry, anti vax idiots aren’t wearing either Yes. president Argentina got ill ""vaccination"" Yes, antibody tests. immunocompromised, they're pretty sure they're still unprotected virus. 

Thank sentiment. hope friends family. better analog would probably tuberculosis. crops infrequently enough afterthought virtually every single American, likely ever go zero daily cases. I’d rather keep variants minimum Covid less threat kids common cold flu. I’m Go Ireland! 🇮🇪 lies last best hope Yeah got much hatred going around. one side wanted educate layman side, yelling, calling names, blanket statements going open anyone new ways thinking. Exactly, article headlines deliberately misleading clickbaits people don’t read article. live Otsego/Wright County, Minnesota approximately 30 miles Minneapolis/Hennepin County. vaccination rate much lower (55%) inner city Minneapolis (80%.) 
Wright County Republican suburb area many anti-vax Trumpians. bet lot certain indoctrinated group that, identify it, comment might removed. Lambda too.

Gotta catch all! (TM) Cases deaths. It’s media largely stopped reporting deaths — it’s low rate won’t spread panic fear. course it’s low chance it’s you, I’m saying that’s potential reasoning behind vaccinated person wearing mask. vaccine 100% effective.  Soon enough we’ll variants names sounding like fraternities sororities *employee exploitation Unions hit problems democracies encounter. Allowing demagogues populists run rampant kill system, whole make sure things happen. Either ballot force. Fuck, that’s good  still mask mandate? Coming LA next week Friday want make sure following rules. Fully vaccinated well. mild fever one day, overweight guy 60's, vaccine worked intended matter people take precautions still casualties.



So mandate seatbelts pre-flight checks, then? matter still casualties, flip side, accept life inherently carries risks try mitigate best can, understand can't save every life.


Wearing masks distancing active pandemic great way mitigate risk, though save everyone.  saying 40% population spreading variant around amount damage original virus 100% population? 

Or evidence vaccinated people spreading variant too? funeral. possible long term health issues. worn masks en masse first time shit popped up. 

If we’d done gotten enough population vaccinated, we’d likely hundred thousand less dead people concerned delta variant. Whehe data back Maryland 74 percent adults vaccinated st least 1 shot masks less less day Thank you. OP, listen guy. actually knows he's talking read tweet Dr. Osterholm. county 70% vaccinated 50-100% unmasked everywhere I've gone last month so. Again, according Cuban claims reorganize let shit leaders this. Democracy workplace guarantee better job, give us avenue change things. Similar thing happened union local meat packing plant covid. Union bosses ignored majority workers allowed meatpacking managers forgo PPE. 

I say I'm sorry happened sucks did, point union benefit workers whole small part them. posted 9 days ago still active reddit. Even vaccinations, looks like I’m back wearing masks indoors again. 

Not gonna risk shit. nice massless bit though, post-vaccine, there’s enough goddamned considerate adults around wanted wear masks first time went shit. Lancaster Douglas counties, Lincoln Omaha located, little 50% fully vaccinated far know. We're working it! Mass, majority vaxxed masks optional people seem bother much. believing Cuban propaganda without question Right fact metrics aforementioned decreased 90% last 3-4 months is…cause concern? people likely get covid again, still advised get vaccinated extra protection. Thank this. would recommend anyone go nursing nowadays. often abusive environment. Yes, that's trend expect see increase almost EU countries. Almost adults invited first dose gotten already. Meanwhile, 65 getting second doses increasing number coming weeks. That's based data Cuban government good independent sources Every vaccine that’s ever produced every disease human history never 100% totally effective….and human race still lives on. It’s life I’m telling live it, you’re way overly cautious. prefer basement forever. union basically corporation workers. still going mostly ones top benefitting everyone fighting ones bottom lot people got one AZN shot. Pretty much same, fully vaccinated mid April early May I'd caught cold. problem time constantly new variants. Right it’s endless cycle masks/no masks restrictions/no restrictions. goal post moved constantly

Two weeks slow spread became weeks, months, get vaccine, places even vaccinated people still told wear mask.... constantly shifting messaging extremely confusing  Friends benefits aka fuck buddy hilarious hear ranting somehow extremely difficult wear fucking bit cloth mouth shop five minutes.

Or, y'know, 8+ hours job can't WFH. Must nice you. Lots essential workers need wear day long. travel, major reduction social interactions, huge increases cleaning/sanitizing/hand washing, distancing masking public likely played roles. Also wondering this. major claim make un-cited, searching science behind question. sources claim enough data state highly unlikely happen. Like People seem think good, ironically people serving vaccinated population unvaccinated people 30+ offered vaccine Ireland. population quite angry absolutely famously world class. reddit gobble Cuban propaganda easily cause gov't want take responsibility. imagine, leaders country want govern society recover pandemic faster. Virtually every country world government playing active role - US political divide party backing misinformation downplaying damage done. helped vote union in. Turns union benefits seniority. &lt;5 years experience time. didn’t end joining. I’m paying money fuck over. Yes, tolerable, circumvention equitable distribution vaccines, rich buying vaccines poor. know what? No. I'm sorry, I'm done County's wishy-washy bs. mandate it, it. I'll wear mask. not, simply (being fully vaccinated course). Make mind. fucking embarassment represent Barbara, department's abysmal messaging. seems beginning frustrating vaccine rollout, goal confuse anger public daily basis. *We* sick too. Everyone deserved better. could done much better, powers limp-ass leadership. It’s 94% symptomatic diseases. metric asymptomatic people sick tested (weekly otherwise). 

It’s possible people would tested postive pcr teast without showing symptoms, sure, can’t comment conjecture data tracking it. 

That said believe healthcare workers Israel track 2 doses 90%+ efficacy infection period verified weekly Covid pcr tests. are, least family York. Thanks polite helpful reply. middle editing original reply came in. Even given (and my) additional data, think stand statement really don’t know. (Though rightly point “no idea all” hyperbole, intended such.) reduced? Almost certainly. reduced get R0 1 without non pharmaceutical intervention? Singapore’s experience pointing “no”. Note much Singapore gotten Pfizer vaccine.  they’re obsessively masked. Bluntly put, really don’t know. (One public health advocate recently said they’re starting think Delta’s R0 may high 8.  Mostly household transmission - original strain would often skip household members. delta.) Neither world doesn't. That's Cuban propaganda absolutely idea talking about.  Yeah no. u  people still know virus legitimately thought came beer

I colleagues studying COVID brains they're pretty skeptical idea virus specifically causing atrophy/infection smell system. think likely brain regions happen particularly ""delicate"" vulnerable damage things like inflammation blood vessel disease. Yeah agree that. Personal development great, personal life move whether stand still run it!

I assumed career cos that's previous commenter mentioned, nm!

I doubt assholes improve much, nature. That's factually incorrect, take advice stop spreading misinformation.

[Adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) COVID-19-associated hospitalization among adults aged ≥65 years estimated 94% full Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 96% effective hospitalisation 2 100%. People hung masks don’t get since time don’t wear long. doesn’t bother wearing mask

People saying keep forgetting people jobs can't home wear 8+ hours day. lol. Unless take Cuban propaganda face value. Kids can't get vaccinated yet, please empathy them. start telling everyone regardless vaccination status wear mask - La suggests today - going get even vaccine hesitant people. protect unvaccinated? That’s choice end day shouldn’t go panic mode every time cases  Watch get 痢. Sometimes get luxury electing vaccine simply take ones available afford. say anything career development, actually referring entirely ""personal life"" in, (not ""you"" personally Paul, royal ""you"") asshole, people keep telling that, perhaps time look internally work yourself. Jobs way make absolutely fucking hate mentality. **People apply personal lives** Fire admin, use salary pay nurses, EZ PZ It’s oxygen loss/ it’s flu body damage due lack oxygen. Covid attacks blood vessels, causes clots everywhere, attacks nervous system, etc. That’s mild case end brain heart damage.  Following up: 79% infection, 88% symptomatic disease. Anyone journals credible info covid clinical progression? Like long incubation periode, whats next phase etc Imagine levels immunity people recovers from
A Covid infection? Antibody levels much lower fully dosed people based testing seen delta significant mutation original wuhan type. 

People thinking natural immunity may surprise.  one. Uptake higher logistic possibly faster (the average time dose delivered arm 5 days read). never much stock, unlike countries looking general doses delivered vs administered. Cos everyone thinks career development end all. Sometimes wanna go work, job, get paycheck work life. care job, means end, care enough decent job, want career.

Edit: annoying people come along change process every month, push jump bunch hoops, add extra processes in, name improvement. job complicated continuously switched on.

P.S. make think. Man, almost like thing called ""context.""

Where context was: What's impact Delta vaccine efficacy ""answer"" provided study, I'm saying I'm interested studies regarding vaccinated people spreading it.

Sure, know hard contextualize things people reddit wanting jump prove someone wrong, obvious anyone read full context realize single study I'm referring really interested broader question. think good points sides. one hand, go restaurant many places without mask cruise ship planes? hand, see would look bad cruise industry much one person Covid ship

That’s think hope pandemic ends sooner rather later - it’s frustrating sure Pake DoH aje bro biar kaga repot nyalain vpn wonder post title intentionally misleading OP’s name “pessimist.” He's special breed... still thinks Covid hoax probably get vaccinated ""it clearly work anyway"". ya 🤷‍♀️ wait til Delta Plus gets speed!  Austin matter people take precautions still casualties. 

If we're going restrict activity could maybe end someone killed, can't anything anymore. flip side, accept life inherently carries risks try mitigate best can, understand can't save every life. hate boner Modi amusing anymore, try something new. sucks. hopefully fades soon 2nd Moderna destroyed me. 18 hours hell. 2-3 hours like super hell. Almost like acid trip “peak” crazy intense rest awful manageable. sudden 18 hours you’re fine. insane amount immigrants would love fill positions. end goal used keeping amount hospitalized manageable we’ve reached goal goal different literally end? Fellow Nebraskan here! got vaccine December still wear masks everywhere, too... definitely minority. That's lot words say ""I read good"".

May remind actual, still unanswered question 60% considered herd immunity? reason news reports push good news excessively scary news, actually difficult find news report mentioning 88% number.

A mentioned 90% protection hospitalization (96%, [as mentioned UK government click [actual analysis linked find efficacy symptomatic infection Delta variant - 88% Pfizer (reported 0.12 odds ratio symptomatic disease compared unvaccinated). Cases still lower they've whole pandemic places  possible would want vaccinated already got covid US, recovered lasting immunity, already died. places like Canada fewer people ever gotten covid, still many likely symptomatic unvaccinated groups.  feel low level J&amp;J employee and/or investor? That’s true - exceptions everything. also observable patterns. likely. didn’t quote whole article. Changing opinion fine also acceptable shut really sure (especially comes opinions affecting health safety billions people). feel like CDC Fauci failed due latter people's distrust perfect acceptable. incentive need. love eat. does, fact, offer protection. stating could YEARS. weren’t saying could offer protection. said could years… anti-vaxxers really showing virus colors run...except hospital highly preventable disease. university required testing almost everyone tested positive asymptomatic Coming dude erase comments can't stand anything says spine? I'll survive. Near zero.

really happy hear doubting all, would able share link cite ? share people well. Antibodies good, antibodies better? comparison, New York 346 hospitalizations today. heard last week immunity covid drops really quickly would need booster. Link? comment raises many questions sub would believe we're doomed die even taking vaccine lol Pfizer gang literally then, multiple new variants emerged mutations make virus transmissible, lethal able evade immune hope coronavirus attenuate time guarantee will. already know coronaviruses become much lethal I’m buy concert tickets October. point plan cancellations, closures, masks fall? article could also remain serious threat perhaps even evolve become lethal. outcome depends complex sometimes subtle interplay ecological evolutionary forces shape viruses hosts respond one thing learn evolution never generalize,” says Edward Holmes, evolutionary virologist University Sydney, Australia, author article evolution emerging viruses Annual Review Ecology, Evolution, Systematics. “It depends entirely biological nuance situation.”

It's literally then, multiple new variants emerged mutations make virus transmissible, lethal able evade immune defenses... hope coronavirus attenuate time guarantee will. already know coronaviruses become much lethal bet delta variant. won’t wear mask cases likely catch Covid. Win Win books. 

If want less individualized POV, won’t part problem pandemic won’t worry spreading covid people unknowingly. Yay! screwed here. leaves children adults can’t get vaccine. It’s irresponsible it’s free, takes couple minutes, prevent getting sick dying. What’s point *not* getting vaccine? got vaccinated week ago AZ said get second shot 3 months now.

Why duration different vaccine need 28 waiting days 2nd shot? Thanks people chose get vaccinated!!! Interesting, thanks. YouTube bane existence. many people convinced they're right everything ask sources respond fucking two hour video YouTube filled crackpot bullshit. travel US(Miami) get vaccinated(J&amp;J), since vaccine rollout country insanely slow. believe easy get vaccinated(At least Florida), aot people USA want get vaccinated.  Keep good work everyone! Here's something I'm wondering: Could exposure/infection *after* vaccination increase immunity, similar people get infected vaccinated? think too, see stupid pseudo-scientific stuff group falls well. lot people far away legitimate sources life think would even know start tried to. Essential oils fixing everything. Crystals. Astrology. that's even bringing politics it. 

Youtube facebook videos quick easy. probably dead laziness think it. Becoming deadlier makes human responses severe. acts catalyst keeping virus spreading. internal biological responses. big part virology research involves global health (which includes social response) individual health.  hear deep, simple truth way entire culture people behaves, chances true. life not, people *certainly* simple. problem true. apies certain situations, one situations. 

Again, great pressure less deadly, even possible becoming contagious become harmful (for instance becomes better replication infecting cells. 

The person regurgitating common misconception. currently 4%. get 70%, response different recently wondering thing. covid back January briefly lost smell - days. there's constant smell, like, everything else, pleasant. necessarily describe like feces, close. work young kids would constantly check diapers, convinced someone needed change. I've worried me, bathe wash clothes. hope goes away. Aussies (except Melbourne) lived life almost restrictions past year. Travelling overseas one least concerns Aussies living otherwise normal life. closed borders probably popular aspect government's response tbh Yes jobkeeper increase jobseeker last year No, makes absolute complete sense. Evolution requires survival ability kill. Virus' aim kill anything aim replicate tend evolve make easier. enough time transmit makes replication impossible.

Go following article read section titled ""Getting nicer — believe viruses tend become less pathogenic,” says Burtram Fielding, coronavirologist University Western Cape, South Africa. “The ultimate aim pathogen reproduce, make itself. pathogen kills host fast give enough time reproduce.” SARS-CoV-2 spread faster killing severely harming fewer people infects, might expect time, become less harmful — or, virologists term it, less virulent.

This extremely evident current flu strains one time lethal today. get healthier sanitize evolved able exist thoroughly society.

\- Source knowledge: geneticist direct family member specializing virology immunology (we can't get shut dinner) Thats media outlets take studys far serious, hear one thing, hear another. study piece bigger puzzle. reason people need restrictions cannot depicted accurately using car accidents example. Keep mind time someone infected small chance mutation may occur, every makes threatening strain one Europe trouble (correct wrong there). trying prevent infection next COVID-19 whole. would prefer guidelines loosened doesn’t mean tell everyone keep mind reason United States got one man preferred stay open follow guidelines look many people died that. size stadiums populations irrelevant. per person.

So every 1,000 people, greater number Scottish people going football games people nation Europe.

It nothing % stadiums filled, totally misunderstood. Mostly approach. sure live trusted voices public health Ontario started disagreeing guidelines feel justified educated noncompliance. Everyone basically group refusal follow rules. think lot depends whether political leadership inspires confidence. FWIW one local universities news today say it’s likely fare better AZ yall keeping covid thing huh. Cant get enough “Old school” tech that’s still never used scale event. It’s older tech still it’s first rodeo. truth costs money uncover. Conspiracies free create. trying say, better words. Evolution compounding effects small differences. Aww Today got Sinopharm :( vaccines made 90% 104 million doses archipelago nation received late June.

Yeah, people shitting use Chinese vaccines could suggest manufacturers could produced delivered 94 million doses Indonesia end late June, that'd great. Yup. Really alternatives would say absolutely nothing years sure stick things even they've proven incorrect. Boomer here. singular emphasis EVERYTHING education beating Soviets communism general. still viscerally think way today. Thanks CDC! weeks kept smelling feces, even though knew feces around. think happened vaccinated. smells would come go, like article describes cases. I've vaccinated since, noticed smells recently. bizarre symptoms virus causes, varying degrees...  legitimate resources easy access...

(Not academic journals, sure, that's really good place begin familiarizing foreign concept)

I think mostly intellectual laziness coupled overwhelming desire affirm one's preexisting views. I’ve wondered would happen masks would become badge honor anti-vax crew. weird world difference one two shot hospitalization tiny, though, 94% vs 96% protection Delta Pfizer. true, I'm staying positive saying cases going slowly rise bit fall pipe dream, I'm saying anyone says pipe dream I'm saying look polls projections everyday stuff. know things eventually get better.

I know vaccines go cases eventually dip again, natural immunity also take place. hate COVID stuff much everyone else does. :(

Relatively speaking, constantly know bit everything studies etc. 
Anti vaxxers aren’t really gaining ammunition, requires knowledge. Sorry, definitely down-under version Canada. know lot Canadians like claim that.  Predictable. They’re smaller nation playing football stadiums typically small. it’s understandable Scotland terms per capita reading correct sources.

Eh, don’t know. live area restaurants recently able start allowing indoor dining. basically completely shut March 2020.

We high mask usage since April. 99% people followed mandate. high vaccination rates. 

Now things open again, things booming. people spent last year bit locked away small apartments, following protocol, can’t wait get out.

I’m sure it’s different elsewhere, least places hitting capacity (which isn’t quite full close.)  never said would happen virus, never said anything stronger language “can be.” isn’t disinformation, general explanation virus mutation.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* yes, cases go week weekly reporting day (I think around 1000). kind expected 1) low vaccine rates 2) hot people heading indoors (opposite north summer). sucks. vaccinated 18 month old not. Putting daycare August suck.

I teach state university Florida. Check campus see fall guidelines yet. university went back fall 2019 operating procedures today truth told heard little place terms students thinking enrolled online classes, idea mask protocols, arguments already masks vaccines (we require them) ect.
I think Florida campuses follow Desantis rules due funding connections honestly doubt lockdowns going happen.

I also suggest talking academic advisor one considering transferring state university year due enrollment impacts due Covid. can't argue doses went waste, hope think doses went town town's use. Way podunk, doses go county seat, county health department be.  County seats tend incredibly small towns they're historically placed smack center county (so travel day two horse vote) nothing else going them. find courthouse, fire department, sheriff's office library, gas station even stoplight. doses would entire county, would thousands people. (Who wasted vax.)

The town vaxxed population less 200. Meh  cuz 'MricA Sydney problem child now. Interstate borders closed hopefully mitigate spread restore things status quo!

And let's get perspective right, point we're nowhere near 16,000 cases US dealing now! nice - i'm looking ! thank sharing ! don’t censor citizens. Mississippi Delta Variant Belgium, everyone systematically invited according age (from old young). vaccinations still going full speed slowed slightly due under-deliveries J&amp;J coming weeks. Vaccination willingness especially high Flanders: vaccination already 80% among adults reach 90-95% among adults end vaccination campaign.

source: I’m fully vaccinated awhile now. wonder come COVID last days can’t smell taste anything. It’s strange thing experience. don’t symptoms whatsoever, cough, runny nose anything. makes want get tested see.   paper, hundreds mild/moderate non-hospitalized Covid-19 patients average significant grey matter loss, merited attention mainstream media.

Douaud et al, 2021. [Brain imaging COVID-19 UK used structural functional brain scans infection, compare longitudinal brain changes 394 COVID19 patients 388 controls matched age, sex, ethnicity interval scans. identified significant effects COVID-19 brain loss grey matter left parahippocampal gyrus, left lateral orbitofrontal cortex left insula. looking entire cortical surface, results extended anterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus temporal pole. **We compared COVID-19 patients hospitalised (n=15) (n=379)**, results significant, **we found comparatively similar findings COVID-19 vs control group comparison**, with, addition, greater loss grey matter cingulate cortex, central nucleus amygdala hippocampal cornu ammonis (all Imagine dying couldn’t bothered vaccinate could. dumb way die. Wisconsin. suppose nothing worry about, fact we’re already seeing backpedaling worrying me. Common sense took restrictions something could best ability, broke rules occasionally full awareness risks. figured general public wore masks time, stayed home could, watched symptoms, best could do. 

It's like typical versus perfect condom use. better use condoms perfectly, even wearing condoms better nothing. 

So worked home, see friends ~8 months (it often cold social distance outside), went errands/groceries, saw family. grandfather isolated taking care grandmother (who dementia), mainly make sure mental health ok. live? U.S surely good go. highly doubt governor willing declare business closures implement capacity limits again... know like think shit stank Theres constant battle organizations *dont* make guidelines, people make own, *do*, know, rational people should, making guidelines prematurely. 

If dont loosen guidelines people starting become protected, people businesses stop altogether own, can't get away airing side caution case new variant arises. did, change landscape. might. also can't hide reality vaccines may short term recurring, least data say otherwise. public pretty well conditioned possibility now.

I really know institutional freakouts youre preparing for. Things closed hard pandemic killing people rapidly tens thousands gstting infected daily, means have, vaccine rollout started, theyve loosening dramatically, rate faster pretty much anybody expected. arent sort herd immunity children unvaccinated basically 'dont wear mask, trust you'. feels like theyve pretty loose chill overall. daily cases something like 20x lower peak, real reason 'institutions' would freak number starts grow dramatically (or way indicates early exponentual growth anyways), hospitals begin fill, deaths skyrocket variant beating vaccines *that* contiguous. happens, hell yeah, put mask back get it. doesn't, really isnt much reason think theyd overreact. response thus far, benefit hindsight, pretty appropriate. plenty pandemic threats past one weve dramatic response recent history one correctly required it. say 'Im afraid variant, government would line close things enforce unnecessary quarantine, think need mask anymore' pretty much parroting antimaskers year ago. mean they’re still pretty damn well. problem vaccine rollout.  sure convoluted article read. Took near end title question answered. think TL;DR metrics like hospitalizations deaths tricky higher death rate India compared UK may due circumstances (e.g. lack medical supplies, hospital capacities, etc.) rather true reflection higher lethality. would therefore make difficult compare alpha variant delta variant they've spread parts world. That’s great. hope people get vaccinated. can't imagine pushing lockdowns halfway year. Absolutely nuts, total failed policy taste smokey things, rotten food, etc? Tell countries like NZ VN. sure hell don’t want things getting control like western countries. advantage borders closed “envy” world look them, running like idiots buying food/tp like it’s 2020 again. Government shambles. really try resist urge care people put completely avoidable risk due stupidity.  mean... duh Good point It’s funny (/sad, horrifying) people speak casually human brethren pre-existing conditions, like disposable expendable. “Don’t worry, immunocompromised unlucky young healthy people (better lol!)” 

I’m ragging specifically, ease sentiment seems spread very, unsettling me. 

Did know 4% population considered immunocompromised/immunosuppressed? people family, friends, loved ones? could next bat? 

Ugh. Let’s try humanity, folks. virus benign young people. recent study Bergen, Norway found healthy people age 16-30 mild infections, 52% still significant symptoms 6 months later, prevalent loss taste smell, fatigue, memory problems cognitive impairment. I'm worried hospitalised, I'm worried this. 

In NZ getting vaccinated August December year, 100% Pfizer, we've wait long. Unlike Australia public happy govt's approach. I'm American too, still happy live NZ. People, please. solution getting things people dont want forced throats. Make large corporation stands gain lot money young people getting vaccine time new legislation force so. really simple! can't fix stupid. Indian government trying look good eyes Indian public.

In terms percentage population vaccinated, India way behind Western countries. US done gave everyone decent amount money, lotteries ton money small chance winning **Jun. 29, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* boss daily. Manages engineering department. fair though that's pretty on-brand him. already knows everything always idea someone changing advice based new information fact foreign concept him. Fedex, actually.

(yes, know joke) want say thank part trials. truly means lot me. Thank you. better vaccines pipeline?  India's confirmed cases wayyy under-counted. Serological studies India showed real number infections somewhere 10-20 times higher official figures.

In US, real number infections may 3 times higher confirmed cases. Disclaimer: I'm doctor scientist. 

I'm answering USA similar 1st world nation. 

You accurate polio vaccine. may know 2 kinds: oral injectable. oral superior injectable safer. USA switched injectable around 2000 risk encountering wild polio USA low decades dedicated vaccination. Children get 3 shots (or 5 combination vaccines.) traveling outside USA, may - indeed - need booster. fact, USA military service members polio vaccine child, get boosters. 

So, fundamental understanding vaccines taking account many require boosters. 

Our bodies different responses different diseases also vaccines diseases. 

For example, mumps measles vaccines things, bodies generate big response. estimated, we'd still half antibodies 200 yrs; therefore, lifelong immunity. 

With chickenpox, hand, lost half antibodies 50 years. Since human lifespan decades longer, half left still carry us through. (If routinely start living bit longer, plausible might need booster.) 

Then there's tetanus. We've lost half antibodies 11 years. That's why, tetanus boosters recommended every 10 years. 

As noted, diseases change genomes rapidly. case flu colds viruses. So, flu shot vaccine, get another one virus changes. 

Also, reason, bodies sort blind spot comes upper-respiratory infections tend see threats. Sometimes, antibody response weak. 

This may people seem catch coronavirus once. first infection may mainly limited upper respiratory, body make many antibodies. 

Studies determined protective vaccine schedule vaccine protect us midst pandemic. example, 2 Pfizer/Moderna, 1 J&amp;J. may need booster may not. 

Covid 19 contagious deadly polio. (Far. More. Deadly.) People USA much greater risk contracting Covid 19 polio. Yet, almost one turns polio vaccine, even though whole series required booster needed traveling place risk exposure. 

Thanks distancing wearing mask decide! :)  30 years research behind mRNA vaccines 10 years clinical trials. 1 year produce test covid-19 vaccine seems reasonable. 12 - 16 year olds eligible Belgium yet?

No, eligible means 18+. adult population vaccinated, 16- 17-year-olds invited. currently plans vaccinate people younger 16. Natural selection rocking on! It’s brilliant idea! Get young opportunistic morons vaccinated boost parts economy suffered pandemic. Australia made strong bet AZ vaccine manufactured locally, caught wrong-footed blood clots issue limited first 50+ only, 60+. created supply issues Pfizer vaccines (the available option) increased hesitancy (especially low-perceived-risk setting). actually worked somewhat well new variant showed up.

And think government trying climb hole. Last night announced AZ vaccine would made available anyone wants - think interesting see many take offer (the increase perceived risk may affect demand, expect). First ""we need booster shots every 6 months"" ""protection years""   Yes I’m sure didn’t catch on. Pretty sure lack feeling cell death turn black possibly gangrenous say automatically become less dangerous - said that, time, tends reasons outlined above. 

You're talking mutations short term. short term, yes, things like happen. second virus mutates way lowers lethality *without impacting transmission*, variant going outcompete time. 

Evolutionary forces difficult observe short term, make less powerful. us. good number Americans vaccinated. It’s concentrated areas vaccines trouble. insurance connected walgreens guess that's checked gave insurance got J&amp;J shot. sure global database vaccines, especially since state got J&amp;J different current state. GL, PM questions  COVID new disease. Everything guess get data, advice revised. cousin mild case covid (like mild flu week) still sense smell 6 weeks later. argument essentially argument authority - logical fallacy. retort argument strawman, also logical fallacy. 'extra magic' involved waiting 5 years. point certain period time elapsed results vaccine observed one arrive conclusions effectiveness safety period time.

The vaccines market ~6 months. Therefore, period time relevant conclusions made 6 months. Arguing vaccines past shown side effects years line arguing inductive knowledge. akin saying never seen black swan, know black swans exist. Especially given dealing new technology mRNA vaccines, arguments hold weight. 

I avoid trying belittle you, tried me, simply ask question basis beliefs. fear? trust authority? Whatever is, highly doubt reason, given points made above. reason, would suggest employ reason rather emotion fallacy decision-making process regarding vaccination advice explicitly implicitly try give others. wish various countries tried strategies. Rapid lick stick tests less accuracy distributed mass quantities would interesting see society. tests accurate contagious.  Maybe allow kids take mask? anti-everything. :) wrote above, colleague's parents tested positive 45 total wedding last week. 45 vaccinated somehow, elderly symptomatic. 

Still insane, good proof vaccines work hospitalizations even elderly. don’t understand countries like Australia Japan didn’t see potential virus increased transmission. least Japan bought doses incompetent getting freezer people’s arms last couple months.

My understanding Australia used AstroZeneca vaccines haven’t purchased enough doses Pfizer. 

The good news Australia’s population small. don’t need acquire many doses. Probably like 90%. seems comment contains 1 links hard tap mobile users.

[Here link number 1 - Previous text ^PM ^[\/u\/eganwall](http://reddit.com/user/eganwall) ^with ^issues ^or ^feedback! ^| ^|  Well, saying unvacinated people still wear masks. Spoilers, won't. bad it’s Federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy straight democracy colleague's parents wedding Jeff City week ago. Wedding 45 confirmed cases, delta variant.

No hospitalizations though apparently somehow vaccinated segment. parents 80+ definitely symptomatic immunotherapy. lost taste smell recovered 4 days Australia also called Pfizer. country wastes extra 2 syllables? Sorry, chance respond you.

Unless medical degree scientist area vaccine virus research, really giving advice opinions vaccines medicine relates COVID. Neither I.

In way, regardless personal opinions developed building things types wood, etc. (heck - maybe spent summer building gazeebo backyard, know thing two!) - would irresponsible provide someone advice building 3rd-floor patio deck, unless I'm professional carpentry related trade. 

You provide advice qualified experts, linking articles / research papers / CDC guidance, etc. 

Unfortunately, anecdotal evidence form basis advice. simply qualified give personal opinions COVID vaccine. irresponsible. simple that.

It's great friends got vaccinated, original comment may well steer people away getting vaccinated, combined advice &amp; consensus medical &amp; scientific community.  tax dollars also go towards paying science deniers. thanks Engage booster shots, we're going moon! Ivermectin tried that. Even multiple meta-analyses people still dismiss lacking evidence. Knowing wrong acknowledging *automatically* makes idiot. Unless choose double wrong. double idiot. first messenger RNA vaccines produced tested large-scale phase 3 human trials. length study phase 3 clinical trials usually 1 4 years. Proud state! Yeah, people Taiwan also got super complacent previous success, April even find enough people willing vaccinated AZ shots had. outbreak, less lockdown people vaccinated. mean, ""you people?"" answer question *at all*. question was: fraction asymptomatic infections result long haul covid? necessarily disagree point trying make, attitude. Mil waiting four months shot number 2. he’s liar very, true. Much like alcohol real life. lot contradictions circulating. Delta/+ variants making vaccinated people sick. highly doubt vaccine current state provide years protection virus continues evolve. heard Dr. Gottleib interview. listening media reports popular opinion, science. science really changed much. problem scientists almost always avoid talking certain terms (see there?), media really shit job conveying probabilities. Instead news prefers hype single study findings hypotheses conclusive. like read article new study says eating chocolate good month later read another one another study says amount chocolate bad you. There's actual change scientific opinion never one despite news made seem. Single studies actually worth reporting on, always taken grain salt. hard write headline ""a consensus emerging that..."" single studies usually gets reported.

It help public health thing individual health. public health perspective, utmost precaution taken rolled back very, carefully. means public health guidance get from, say, CDC meant make life easier better, meant keep entire population safe emphasis risk avoidance. ""vaccinated people wear masks"" never meant ""vaccines protect you"" meant ""we amount data need conclude vaccines prevent disease spread, everyone keep wearing masks safe even though data thus far says they're unnecessary vaccinated individuals"". Delta plus likely created co-infection delta beta (the lineage k417n, highly prevalent Bangladesh time delta wave started). Delta pro max would scarier k417t gamma, much less likely arise Asia Europe (no gamma) somewhat less likely South America (little delta, though could change). It'll North America, likely American south lot lineages, create magic combination. 

I know you, I'm ready pre-order soon available COVID web site. Hahaha yeah... thought :-p take care! Weird. friend mine got appendicitis long 2nd shot. wonder Pfizer… 🤔 GF's Mom lives Dhaka assure numbers vastly underreported. used work ASME pressure vessels. people sit board section code years, decades even, suggest something changed, even rephrased, whoever wrote particular sentence 23 years ago fight tooth nail keep same, wrote (even though passage isn’t directly attributed them). found real mistake code took 5 years change it. stopped pointing shit out. optimistic us getting grips impacts climate change. US culture economy material growth basic assumption get-go, even longer logical like brushing limits finite world. Even company well viewed failure always growing. cant possibly know since years havent passed Nope. Done masking. Vaxxed poor journalism

*Free* journalism. get pay for.

(Ads pay enough hire anyone professional intern/blogger). Vaccine months, even make claim like sound like complete bullshit? Holy smokes, truly diffent experience everyone. really suck lost senses even vaccine m8. Glad know recovered. Stay positive covid. No. mRNA vaccine, transport mechanism. CDC role aware development vaccine. “access” control.

mRNA vaccines development many years, although hadn’t yet developed one designed large scale population use, extremely fortunate outbreak came ready able so. knew exactly target particular virus necessary background research already done vaccine closely related SARS virus, turned necessary. 

BioNTec designed mRNA record time - days/weeks. small startup without production capacity needed, partnered Pfizer, global heavyweight does. (Such partnerships small nimble biotech big pharma standard industry.) Moderna developed similar mRNA independently similar timescale. It’s rocket science know doing, companies do.

The US went head line way usually does: $. bought ton vaccine clinical trials done. Haha funny gay! Canadian here. could theoretically start sending Astra-Zeneca starting phase out. could use AZ vaccinate senior citizens. Vaccination exit strategy. Australia NZ open borders herd immunity via vaccination achieved. NZ preparing open borders gradually 2022, Australia looking towards late 2022 2023. Lol Bernie Snowden haha  Yeeep, San Diego fully open, last couple weeks positivity increased 0.8% 1.5%. Thats thing brand new science. Though think CDC fucked failing recommend masks early on. grandparents cabin there. Lovely place! Here's deal, stop thinking nebulous thing. virus, mutates, vaccine. get vaccine, much better position get vaccine. get vaccine continue wear mask, even protected normally would be. Also, helps community, selfish. Spoiler alert, wear mask significantly less likely infected airborne pathogens like flu.

As long virus mutate much, past evidence pointed fact moderately protected years, public health experts KNOW low balled it.

The delta variant twice infectious variants virus. going rip populations low vaccination rates.

In short, get vaccine, wear mask public going hurt anyone help, know health officials change directives get new information virus **has never seen before**. difference black white thinking, thinking grey. went four months without positive case community. outbreak community since August 2020 one shut back zero 3 weeks. Zero Covid successful pre-vaccine strategy. 

There never plan elimination permanent strategy, always fully vaccinate, sometime 2022. govt always said move elimination suppression, keeping numbers low zero. great analogy... can't wait use fruitless attempt explain scientific method person content remain ignorant. Well that's fair either... reasons Wow! Measles outbreaks number orthodox Jewish communities around NYC. Also smaller outbreaks west coast. death preferable alternative accepting reality. live far geograpically missouri. I'm fairly sure ample access chose to. Yes vaccinated measles. I’m 36 receive MMR vaccine, received three individual vaccines per records. They’re still effective per titer test needed grad school. virus pretty fine line walk mutate evade antibodies spike protein, since gives entry cells ACE2 receptor. Specificity protein gives virus lot virulence. Mutate shape spike much virus risks losing specificity receptor. Feel free criticise government politicians, almost makes honorary Aussie. point articles need move weekly thread r/darwinawards r/iamverysmart folk's full brilliance celebrated. J&amp;J tho :) 🙃  cherry picking, simply recent year number for. 

thanks complete data. would consider half ""daily"" case point. mean measles around thousands years. cherry pick, many cases last 50 years since vaccine around? Real talk, likely safe (i.e., dying getting hospitalize) j&amp;j vaccine.

However, lot **speculation** j&amp;j effective 2 dose vaccines face Delta variant struggle give robust protection compared mRNAs (preventing getting sick all, i.e., symptomatic)

Speculation includes:

1. Lower starting efficacy.
2. one dose schedule generally weaker stimulating immune response, 
3. delta variant shaving efficacy Pfizer AZ reason believe J&amp;J.

This leads experts wonder well J&amp;J actually works.

Sadly, evidence really say one way another, would say listen *your* doctor. NZ cases community case reported NZ 4 months. cases day border quarantine hotels. tolerate even single case community. viral infection cause myocarditis. Especially ill person rigorous exercise whilst ill. doctors recommend rest days illnesses, skip intense exercise. Also advisable abstain exercise days vaccine dose. government India comes numbers order make things look good keep everyone happy. looking numbers per population instead comparison countries. Yep. Don’t approach armadillos wild, kids. There’s plenty vaccine availability. Well yeah it’s country hundreds millions people seems pretty unlikely 
Honest question: matter much right now? mean, whether bat living laboratory living cave, change we've dealing today?

Super easy, barely inconvenience. Damn wtf happened 2 years ago make sure Covid 19 puts myocarditis warning label too. Influenza well. confuse vaccines require two separate vaccinations spaced weeks apart person acquire ""full immunity"" vaccines require one single vaccination person acquire ""full immunity"".  

Some vaccines require two separate vaccinations spaced weeks apart person acquire ""full immunity"". vaccines, one shot provides partial immunity, second shot injected weeks later provides ""full immunity"". second shot booster shot. second shot required recipient acquire ""full immunity"".  
       
For vaccines require two separate vaccinations spaced weeks apart, booster shot would come second vaccination. 
       
For vaccines require one injection person acquire ""full immunity"", booster shot would come single initial vaccination. mean.. that's literally science works 2-3 doubling periods away January high. Thats less month present rate. sorry US’s vast imperialistic networks supported great military police repression leading countless deaths within country around world (both directly toppling divergent governments global south replacing authoritarian ones) funny? article say anything number actually mean?

The article crap, trust Sweden pretty average 55% first dose 18+ rate 0.5% group per day, 30 days 70% 18+ there.

[Looking Sweden seems behind quite bit, currently many first doses per capita Germany around 3-4 weeks ago. yeah, Sweden might 70% 18+ end July, Germany 70% total.  find way travel booze &amp; drugs even go church. can't get vaccine site? Look word ""can"" sentence. use reason. I'm guessing reason use it.  I'm Brit wanting visit Portugal next month, sounds entirely sensible fair covid-19 patients died also flu.

Put way, smallpox virus still quite deadly (kill rate 30%) recorded since Antiquity. Despite lethality, enough selective pressure evolve something less lethal, clearly humans going let outbreak run wild nowadays stay endemic it'll become less deadly. could take millennia, it'd ever happen.

Another object lesson likely ancestor HIV. SIV originally deadly certain primates ruined immune systems HIV humans. However couple dozen millennia natural infection (and dying it), primates evolved problem virus quite happily function even quite high viral load stuff.

It might take dozen millennia endemic widespread infection HIV humans something similar might happen.

We’re 72% red Texas, we’re still wearing masks. We’re playing here. people family-oriented like party, there’s still plenty maskless gatherings. masks stores. Reminds argument wondering care much online privacy.

*If nothing hide, even care?*

Quite slippery slope... Scotland tenth highest rate cases world past week. Also highest Europe.. almost twice high countries second/third (Cyprus/England). 

I think mix low immunity due low case rates previous waves, course football. things back normal first time since pandemic began. Pubs open seeing friends homes allowed, restrictions remaining. 

Throw together, new super spreading variant, get mess. Thankfully hospitalizations / deaths rising fast cases are, we're still situation right I'm guessing around 2% entire country self-isolation right now. many businesses schools close. crazy, ya'll thrive expo weeks ago videos single person mask on. saw slowdown canada started second vaccinations, like Belgium EU, also slowed comes first vaccinations while. 

for example past weeks Germany mostly gave second shots fewer first shots. done slowly starting give first shots wave needs second shot etc. Virginia people anymore either, granted lot area fully vaccinated.  Also got curious wrote like that. looks like attempt censor word forgot hide letter. NHS vaccine certificate specifically refers Comirnaty vaccine product. Presumably Canada's certificates refer Covishield vaccine product instance. would pretty easy border officers spot ineligible vaccines.

That said, UK issued SII doses too. I'd intrigued know effectively treated AZ stock, Covishield approved here. Covid-25 hunger 
Covid-26 proprioception agree main point above. I'm curious though - know 'didnt make antibodies'? get tested antibodies? 

I ask lot people think feel shitty vaccine order protected. advice I've read subject say correlation vaccine causing symptoms strength protection conferred.

Hope everyone know stays safe.  Get second one tomorrow vaccinated. going local post office day coast North Atlantic ocean. Wearing mask sign says (until 2 days now, point I'll use judgement). 


I approach glass door there's elderly man inside, back motion come outside, motions door, notice hands full open hold door him. started screaming bloody fucking murder 6 feet, vaccinations age mostly live I'm vaccinated too, mention we're wearing masks.  


He gets face screaming corona 6ft fair, literally trying hold door open outside old man strong wind.  


For reference I'm 6'2 30 ish 220lbs fit, 5'5, 80 ish 120lbs prime. 

The problem I'm still holding door 70 km/h wind let go gonna knock feet. Meanwhile guy 6 inches face screaming social distancing, threatens fight even though he's triyng hold mail hands. Even though trying hold door open wind elderly man. 


After everyone started watching us raise voice tell either get fuck way hold door (even wind getting heavy) eventually went car, luckily needed check PO box actually talk anyone super embarrassed. came post office parked behind jeep writing plate paper. drove across lawn around him/ 


There point story, kind other.  pandemic effect everyone's mental health, 80 year old man would never fight somebody holding door 2 years ago, neither would considered socking mouth dick. We'll soon back normal gonna take time people relax again. 


Be excellent eachother Ah yes lets visit magical vaccine fairy get vaccines vaccine tree...

As countries outside US problem **SUPPLY** , plenty AZ vaccine recommended 60's due blood clots Pfizer supplying &lt;= 300k week till July ticks 600k per week. got vaccines soon possible help get numbers up. elderly protected. Hospitals safe overwhelmed. risk severe illness death extremely minimal. reasons stuff first place. last year half we've lived lives based ""what if?"" getting point costs outweigh benefits. 
I'm also tired called selfish wanting society whole begin carry safe enough so. (Note said ""safe enough"". know might hard comprehend, maybe even uncomfortable, safety all-or-nothing. okay 100% safe.) 90% vs hospitalization, article implies, that's considerably worse initially thought. 

Two doses MRNA vaccine ~80٪ symptomatic disease, means suppressing spread without vaccinating entire (all ages) population, absence NPIs. Again, saying it’s “reasonably common” stating that. Also, majority asymptomatic (as relates we’re discussing), making point…not point .  True suspect still treated 'AZ' stock issued UK. AZ approved MHRA right? (putting aside Moderna/Pfizer etc). I'm aware NHS documentation issued individuals referring SII/Covishield. Barely anyone UK's heard Covishield. 

If people told went get dose 'ah actually, official AZ vaccine, given alternative, non-AZ recognised vaccine', would run mile.

Have seen NHS vaccine certificates app referring Covishield? could completely wrong tbf, keen know anyone has. suspect huuuge uproar millions Brits find they're effectively locked EU. Um, pretty obvious vaccinated person gets breakthrough infection become contagious pass easily unvaccinated person vaccinated person.  “Reduce testing” isn’t former guy’s solution high infection rates?  back January smell still fully recovered. Took month taste smell start come back since able pick subtle scents. Moab here, it’s spring break stupid entire pandemic…lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations pseudoscience superstition, especially kind celebration ignorance… autoimmune disease, I'm vaccinated wear mask public indoor spaces. No. walk get vaccine almost anywhere kind thing. 

These people dug think kind righteous campaign. evil sunk in. People die this, unfortunately. helps. Unfortunately studies focus 'how many mask-wearers 1000 get covid?' 'What happens mask wearer sits room day facing unmasked covid person'?

We know helps sure, otherwise 'masked' would catch covid rate 'unmasked'. not.

Six cases Lambda identified across UK date, linked overseas travel.  Lambda variant first originally discovered Peru World Health Organization (WHO) classified ""Variant Interest"" June 14.  said Lambda variant multiple mutations spike protein could impact transmissibility studies needed fully understand mutations.  need know Lambda variant:  Lambda variant C.37 variant already reported highly prevalent Peru.  Lambda variant lies within B.1.1.1 lineage.  per WHO, Lambda variant related 81% cases detected since April Peru.  Lambda variant identified many 29 countries, including North South Am, Europe, Oceania.  India:  far, India detected Delta Delta Plus variants India. However, experts believe opening international air travel might bring cocktail new variants, including Lambda India. I’m exhausted haven’t made vaccines mandatory wiped thing already. It’s absolutely shameful. Coincidentally homes market. facts care feelings.

If write sure whether believe, probably also get decent reply. know that, reacted saw. ""A Study"" one red flags see clickbait articles time. like ""This weird trick"" ""number 3 shock you"". reportedly talks several countries either purchase vaccines, take exchange vaccines set receive later, instead go Israel. report name countries.

How generous… put plane send country Africa Asia. Similar Colorado Springs. It’s basically generic AZ vaccine covid die automobile accident counted covid death. reason asymptomatic vaccinated individuals would feel need go get tested, think theory correct here.

I live UK that's reality ground.

The government sends free rapid tests anyone free. literally _encouraged_ test even vaccinated symptoms. Lots people goto work education.

My friends (incl double dosed) still fairly regularly case interact elderly people etc. Yea, it’s late misread post commenting to. Anyway, read stated, I’m denying compliance higher blue areas vs red…so sure mention that. Also, expect people wear mask time (this wear misread comment - don’t agree them). I’m wearing one week personal reasons, usually rock mask I’m vaxed. 

My apologies you’re confused. I’m way past bedtime couldn’t sleep. I’m deleting posts. St. cloud history fucking bigoted backwards idiots I'm really surprised I'm UK, first booked vaccines 12 week gap first second, Delta variant local GP asked book second jab sooner, have. Would good also keep original second (now third) vaccine booking? 4 weeks new second jab. 

Is value keeping it?  
Is wholly unethical try? I'm guessing potential vaccine something could used poorer country storage issues. 
Would vaccine go waste used daily schedule?

Would run risk body going bit OTT trying fight 3 jabs (plus covid New Years). research done subject? 


Thanks Shhhh...don't give ideas! roll dice every day. Outliers exist disease model. 70% adult population 1 dose (or whatever) sufficient suppress variant herd immunity threshold doses MRNA vax 80-85% effective symptomatic disease Delta immune competent adults. One dose ~33٪.

Vaxxed individuals strongly protected severe disease/death, symptomatic individuals still spread.

Vax alone enough suppress community spread population, including kids, vaxxed. simple. Masks marginally effective, risk reduction additive.

Mask reduce risk business school closures fall. Get vaxxed can, get 12+ kids vaxxed, younger kids soon trials complete. Yeah never really understood big problem wearing mask, literally effect whatsoever.

Actually pretty sad think sooner last time caught flu go ER pneumonia asthma. Even covid completely gone really point wearing mask, maybe social stigma. Currently higher Deep South northern Rockies, 19 entities (we're 88.92 jabs/100) many jabs still fairly recent. We’re incredibly high vaccination percentage, following CDC guidelines, would expect? massive difference compliance blue red areas, can’t deny *now* Chicago mostly vaccinated unmasked vs rural parts country mostly unvaccinated *and* unmasked.  people interact children follow guidance modify behavior. dependent overall risk profile. don’t interact children I’m vaccinated need shut life again? fine spreading unchecked, we’re point large majority willing adult population inoculated safely interact other. I’m getting vaccine couple hours I’ll PCR test tomorrow flight. vaccine affect result make positive? he? careless Adria Tour last year  Also parent young kids. approach:

* Still masking indoors even tho I'm vaxxed
* indoor dining yet

Maybe I'll end relaxing kids vaccinated and/or cases drop even more. reducing Malaria cases 176 million per year deaths 315-409 thousand per year?

That would big yikes. 

Oxford University really go back focusing important stuff, like rowing something.

P.S. crack wrote comment or..?  Kinda sucks giving vaccines people visit visa. stuck family ( residency) cannot go malls cannot get vaccinated. That’s weird, London several popup centres near specifically Pfizer everyone 18 welcome. checked council ones (and NHS GP) Peru amazing Ceviche think France better anyone imagined. already way past uptake estimates. First doses slowing down, France far behind Western European countries end. Someone saying feel rude wearing mask even remotely mandated wear one vaccinated. 

It's also explanation berate someone continuing mask cautious vaccine 95% effective (which less many variants). 

It still highly effective variants, even catch it, makes exceedingly likely severe, someone wants take extra precautions continuing wear mask, warrant told go fear wearing mask precaution remotely thing scared anything.

You're arguing science, stop self righteous science champion thing. science vaccines extremely effective. science also still global pandemic circumstances constantly changing.  Never would’ve thought surgeon’s mask would make many people lose minds.

I’ll wearing mask herd immunity hit area, sake herd. Pretty simple. It’s high demand end next week first doses given. ton first dose slots available suddenly J&amp;J coming in, least supply issue solved. 

I guess 80% adult population first dose, grow sloooowly 85-90% 

But also means mid-August least 80% Dutch adult population fully vaccinated, actually earlier previous estimate. pandemic among unvaccinated  “If don’t wear mask might kill anti-vaxxers.”

To say: don’t threaten good time.  live society. UK smells like feces opportunistic bacterial infection sinuses. Anyone suffering covid symptoms use neti pot daily clear prevent anything developing that's worse virus itself. Pretty consistent .1% day while. think 3 things move needle would Pfizer/Moderna getting full approval, kids 12 getting emergency approval, Novovax getting emergency approval. US options outstanding move daily rate up?  Doctor Eric Twitter reputable information?

And cases currently low, delta variant reaching LA significant numbers known significantly virulent. ounce prevention likely worth pound cure month two. Combine reopenings, generally support, level distancing + mask use could end making enormous difference. And, again, neglible cost people act like babies asked take mild safety precautions.

I used HR (on dev/tech side) large medical center Seattle traveling nursers earn regular staff -- regular staff resented really understand often travelers get stuck shifts others want. Sorry, world going bonkers day... people whining masks always anti-maskers. vaccine gives even justification scream people's faces wearing one. some, cross threshold quiet anti-maskers loud ones proven false time time again. Ugh.. live wrong state! forced go mall

This article first hospital country require staff get vaccine, **first hospital Michigan** require it. Almost nurses hospital unionized, though. Nurses outside hospitals generally not. Step 1: Get rid unemployment benefits

Step 2: Require employees every job vaccinated.

There's guaranteed way force stubborn people make things better everybody get shot. use '...' skip 'compare to' part.  They're alternative called ""terrain theory"". love claim Pasteur renounced germ theory death bed - would invalidate experimental results others came him. Money always issue

This 100% true. used earn $100/hr software developer Seattle hated work much (mainly management different companies worked at) eventually quit, sold house, moved away. Nah, someone severe social anxiety, able handle it.

They put wearing mask using ""personal freedom"" they'd like put it. put want live life. Herd immunity. Get universities demand students vaccinated hospitals can't staff? Like them...? Please... Soon? quite easily available Missouri while. petty, idiot governor sent vaccines tiny towns hours away population centers. sent vaccines small towns town's total population. thought would good idea distribute vaccines evenly number without adjusting population, see.

Most people knew got vaccine first couple months drive 4 hours doses. seemed like shit show, waited could get pharmacy across street me. could wear mask Pfizer/Biontech* Great analogy, super clear. Thanks! nurses either, I'm xray tech short staffed well, people burnt out. entire hospital short almost every department. Granted, small rural hospital always going lose bigger places far compensation goes, never bad before. supply issues. Things improving many us still waiting. province *have* wait seven weeks doses, there’s way get second dose earlier, younger people couldn’t start getting first doses late May/June. returning large indoor outdoor gatherings/events tomorrow also dropping mask requirements, us able get second doses matter badly we’ve wanted them. sucks.

But none anything fact 20% anything “most,” that’s narrow-mindedness, it’s math lol protect selfish assholes lazy get vaccinated. I’m proud city stepping smashing record! new strain hopped ocean took foothold new continent, somewhat vaccinated population. threat totally get that. don’t think there’s medical professional would say “Don’t wear mask all”. fact alone younger unvaccinated children ample reason wear masks indoors crowds. protected vaccine, there’s still chance spreading it. big one, it’s unreasonable exercise caution. 

I won’t fault anyone doesn’t wear mask point, we’ve enough think vaccinated ‘deserve’ choice wear mask this. I’ll never look anyone wants keep wearing abundance caution. Especially since there’s still large age group unapproved vaccine. got vaccine good go enforce this! don’t specify, means expert based article there’s reason doubt wouldn’t also help. seems weird didn’t touch Around 200,000 people received first dose Covid-19 vaccine every day France last week, half many month ago post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Vaccinated people wearing masks GOOD thing consider everything else life covid.

It's return seeing stranger smile hold door open, return kids learning speak reading lips bring able easily recognize emotions, return young people kissing bar, etc etc..

I'm completely pro mask, still wear indoors even places required apartment buildings common areas, even though I'm fully vaccinated. 

But, come on, able live huge morale general human condition, let's celebrate that. also might better much unvaccinated population catch COVID possible summer schools closed seasonal health high.

At point anything else going start convincing people they're wrong? might need rural suburban areas get ravaged order convince arrogant older people ignorant young people get vaccine. totally unrelated red blue map show you. 

But seriously; I’ve seen examples almost anywhere, especially last months vaccines ramped up. Rural urban; there’s shortage selfish assholes consider nobody else. No, it’s Greek alphabet. Yup, wearing mask get final vaccine. Period. story happen Actually, F490S mutation seems better reducing mAb potency L452R mutation. Fortunately doesn’t seem impactful E484 mutations.

Still agree VOC, 70-80% vaccine efficiency feels they’re uncomfortable unnatural. it’s worst thing I’ve ever done, I’m also vaccinated would wear mask legit put chemicals body specifically I’d protected? people want keep wearing go it, judgement me. trying mandate vaccinated people wearing again? chance hell. Implement new classes? Southern states trying take away ones already have! Eh getting vaccine tomorrow fully, ain’t ever wearing again. one thing year half ago, I’m gonna live fear though majority people vaccine risk dying. PA masks largely ditched. kind skeptical cdc/society moved little soon saying necessary, opinion changed yet seems. continue wear one public foreseeable future.

I’d also like see paper. No. It’s something mentioned met. They’ve made “task force.” unlikely done time soon. Delta variant discovered October 2020 India (8-9 month ago)

There abundance information month… 

Dropping indoor mask mandate like closing umbrella it’s still raining claiming following science staying dry. No, “hospitalizations” stats aren’t tracking admissions they’re tracking available capacity. currently 800 patients hospitalized covid state Missouri. That’s high Missouri, it’s 800 admissions day high. numbers important, even studies numbers often quite lacking methodology. Unless see randomized, adjusted / matched control group double-blinding least, there’s nothing look at. Reporting 20% people tested positive COVID report depression 2 months later isn’t meaningful without context control group purity double-blinding. I've heard least play around anti-vax rhetoric - vaccinated shedding vax particles, need mask protect &amp; on.

I think interesting takeaway people still think sole reason mask protect others. recovery really great news countries struggling supply!! Im really hopefull end soon. Here’s archive link[archive Mathematician here. bulk Long COVID studies straight trash terms methodology. Many lack control groups altogether, don’t, tend even employ matching across groups. rarely ever blinded, there’s placebo. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Good luck getting across people.. know 45 cases delta variant? thought required advanced sequencing beyond normal covid tests? Please tell understand different situation immunocompromised pre-pandemic? Covid-19 patients average significant grey matter loss

Careful misuse statistical terms. “Significant” context paper means p-value less 0.05. mean medically significant, mean “large”, mean “significant” way word typically colloquially used.

You also left part paper mention parts brain COVID victims statistically significantly smaller even getting diagnosis, raising question part effect causative versus correlative.

Lastly, gray matter loss known occur smoking, sleep apnea, things - typically recovers within matter months.

I’m quite sure “merited attention mainstream media” given authors know means yet, idea whether recover, provide (that saw) measures heteroskedasticity, undergone peer review. OoooOOOOoooooh, look Mr. Fancy Pants here, science logic stuff! Bullshit, literally positions evangelical coworker spoke today. brought multiple times past months.  Today literally discussing stuff brought 21% excess deaths county like talking circles. I'm red part NJ, nobody wearing masks vaccinated not. sure think pro-ivermectin video YouTube blocked. Where’s source people accepting endemic? Aren’t countries fighting infection vaccines, lockdowns measures?  it’s scam covid global warming, think I'm abt done. care abt absolute idiots. Like virus didn’t come lab suddenly come lab? every doses give away countries accept antivaxers well. fair news 24 hours day. Vermont 39% urban vaccinated state country.

So disproves rural folks can't get vaccinated, else could reason? Hmm. 

Orange red may something bet. OP - edit title? dad doctor small town, suggested people let kids play ball height pandemic. He’s threatened, car vandalized, clinic robbed, dead animals left porch family members. It’s still happening, actually. pissed much barely stand drive hometown. don’t live anymore, constantly worried parents last grandparent don’t know culprits are, local cops useless. trust one anymore. doubt it. live NJ even gov Murphy dropping mask requirements fall schools. People going back masks. That’s complete bullshit…but believe want people change titles good articles? gets removed. don’t even click know isn’t real headline. You’re nice person.... US politician risking career placing mask mandate back again. Covid basically lower flu levels death hospitalization vaccinated people then? Vaccines available. I’ve mine, I’ve done protect others. It’s fair restrict lives people done everything right since March 2020 anti-vaxxers (who ones ultimately killing immunocompromised people).

It sucks people truly can’t get vaccine, they’ll protect going forward. like pandemic. I’ve vaccinated months, I’ve done part. could learn everything right away mistakes.  You’re sub called coronavirus. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Good news, surge cases started couple weeks ago. Half cases last 4-5 days. Hospitalizations usually lag week deaths another 1-2 weeks. 

So like 92,000 clear. figure years testing? wonder many years heart inflammation causes? possible? Guess not.

According 7-day rolling average cases Missouri sits 563; yesterday, 560. Exactly one month ago, state rolling average 286.

And getting 800 *new* hospitalizations per day? last time Missouri 7 day average *new* cases Feb 14th June 25, Missouri reporting 853 COVID hospitalizations rolling 7-day average last reported 800 hospitalizations May 11, 2021. last time Missouri recorded four consecutive days 800 hospitalizations March 16-19. Sounds promising. Go hospital ""admission"", hospitalization means many people currently treated hospital, whether regular inpatient ICU.

For instance, article stated following: ""The 7-day rolling average hospitalizations 1,000 Sept. 16, 2020, March 5, 2021. 2,000 Nov. 9, 2020, Jan. 27, 2021.""

Just looking period Nov 9 Jan 27, that's 80 days. 2,000 NEW people going hospital every day 80 days, means 160,000 people hospitalized November thru January. Missouri reported 600,000 cases entire pandemic, there's way quarter got hospitalized. means height 2nd wave late last year, every single day 80 days 2000 people hospital Missouri. Funny enough states going rise, also ending ended unemployment benefits early. unvaccinated people would actually need protection, getting it. People going back work force also going increase cases, thus causing issues, even vaccinated. Vaccinated people probably fine terms getting sick, deal unvaccinated co-workers able work crowding hospitals. 

This unvaccinated people yes, let's excuse terrible leadership states have. news people became ill pandemic. news number supposedly responsible adults caring people's children take reasonable well known easy precautions public health guidance pandemic, resulting many people harmed. That's willful negligence child endangerment.

Crimes children always newsworthy. whatever reason tend anti-vax. I’m Jewish idea they’re like that. don’t get vaccine statistically improbable won’t get covid.  

If get vaccine statistically improbable get covid. I’m betting big overlap Venn diagram unvaccinated unmasked new guidance even announced. doubt changed much group. somehow accidentally leaked lab would hope labs world could learn accident. agree would hope could investigated rational scientific way. Cake...day I’d choose go heaven  What's crazy even flu would expected result 1.8 deaths per 100,000 people aged 18-49. thing may literally less dangerous flu get vaccinated.

And that's assuming even catch first place, probably (About 79-80% efficacy delta Pfizer/Moderna).  experts simultaneously believe 1) Delta carries increased risk infection and/or adverse health outcomes vaccinated people vs. prior strains, yet 2) Delta warrants cautious behavior vaccinated people vs. pre-Delta era. needs stop. longer makes sense force people make sacrifices people susceptible disease ability protect via vaccination months point. Get tested sure. Thats specific symptom. Glad one tho! scary hits *fully vaccinated* person like that? would done vaccinated? Vaccines. already formidable defense. combine vaccination simple wearing masks/ extra protections vulnerable, well.

Just need get world vaccinated. small task impossible either. surplus August. They're saying every Canadian wants vaccinated doses end July.

I guess we'll know soon. Pretty sure it’s effective, one two specific flu strains capitalism working well. think forgot mention people Can't get shot: compromised immune systems children 12. F people, right? 🥰 Fucking ScoMo, something spin marketing boi. take Pfizer instead AstraZenca two timing prick real world study broad comparison everyone forms contact. specifically hammer environment individuals led percent snuck by. Viral load matters, combination person that's currently infected, proximity them, length time, air circulation, etc etc. reason early China lots otherwise healthy young healthcare workers dying frequently early on, viral load matters. 

So yes, science say you, vaccinated, closed environment someone who's currently highly contagious, span hours, likely nasty episode. point hospitalization though.

But shook person's hand, said high, walked away right passing indoor mall something, probably issues. 

Viral loads matter. vaccinated, follow clear science safe Certain milk products like brie still taste like latex 15 months.   numbers lie yet provide back BS story.


Funny story requires ignoring pertinent numbers. Even account factors mentioned above, apply equally flu COVID-19 btw, still *one* vs much larger number.

Also mask wearing. covid hotspot city here, wore n-95, followed surgical mask times, even inside house people covid. car, would wear face shield know friend triple masking caught covid due car ac hospitalized oxygen therapy. Anyone afford n-95 double masks here. maybe try that.  Yeah, I’m “essential” food service still required one 8 hours day. literally killing me? No, one hot kitchen physically exerting highly unpleasant definitely days run back rip cause feel like I’m pass out. pisses knowing since I’m fully vaccinated mask basically pure theatre. still wear mask want? Uncomfortable, maybe worth thinking about? Yeah is. work kitchen tops ears permanent scars wearing mask 6 days weak heat pressure sear deeper sweat. big deal.

“Masks aren’t big deal aren’t allowed dislike them” think I've COVID, knows sure? thx, need see. make heads tail article lol   Uh....

Only parts it. places. US basically back normal everywhere today lot places months.

My point think 2018-2019 flu season (or worse seasons) risky anything except tell people wash hands get shot. know school even requires flu shot unlike diseases. Yet freaking covid far less deadly kids pretty much every prior flu season, even though circulating much Yeah, flu bad COVID, bad stopped in-person schooling stop kids getting it. 

I'd argue reason stopped person schooling protect teachers, actually risk. vaccinated back business. numbers lie yet provide back BS story. Massachusetts one wearing masks part stores. boyfriend continuing wear masks stores treated bunch dirty looks past weekend Home Depot. 
I honestly would liked taken mask breathed surprise! boyfriend strep throat. I'm going continue wear mask public probably rest life whenever flu outbreaks sick. honestly love wearing mask store. person already decided shouldn’t right bodily autonomy, doubt anything wouldn’t strip given chance. grocery store valley like 50/50. Hopefully Newsom implement mandatory masking soon. Yes think finally relaxed kids vaccinated. Also, I’d like know majority people countries opportunity vaccinated. Wearing mask low effort solution me. know I’m Mississippi, seems like didn’t read post thoroughly. 

As I’m sure know, would ethically perilous edit original statement. etiquette dictates original text remain, edits made reflect necessary changes. 

It would slanderous I’d doubled down, admitted mistake edited post reflect. 

As Mississippian , I’m cognizant status bottom statistical barrel..pointing fact general simply state fact, even quoted statistic incorrect. overall number cases children increasing, percentage new cases children increasing. percentage new cases children logically increase sects population become vaccinated. It’s important distinction. certain milk products smell taste like latex.. Personally, think bad idea. think this, would destroy confidence vaccines. Especially vaccinated, articles like would make people think vaccines don’t work increase vaccine hesitancy

The way look point live lives accept people aren’t going vaccinated. can’t constantly switch masks masks. vaccines extremely effective yet many health officials officials acting like it’s doomsday 

I’ve vaccinated Pfizer wore mask year. gone far two weeks slow spread focusing hospitalizations. apparently anytime rise cases, widespread panic based largely alone 

Like many you, want pandemic over. whole family around live vaccinated get feeling end?  interact infant chemo patient, definitely would consider wearing mask. However, interactions healthy, vaccinated people. risk getting sick low, risk theoretically contagious low, risk vaccinated person getting covid-19 also low.

In places could immune compromised people, grocery store, probably wear mask cautious. Viral vector vaccines: AstraZeneca, Janssen

Subscriber article agree, parents refused vaccine, thx bloody facebook groups friends  would get vaccine FYI, Vermont roughly 7 times smaller Nebraska geographically.

From article: study revealed many bat species (n = 32 n = 28 46 species) support efficient binding SARS-CoV-RBD SARS-CoV-2-RBD, respectively (Fig. 2c,d). 

Just many bat species bind well, mean bat species bind well. data says 14/46 bat species efficiently bind SARS-COV1 ACE2 RBD 18/46 bat species efficiently bind SARS-COV-2 ACE2 RBD.

They also found 2 bat ACE2 supported infection similar what's seen human conducted SARS-CoV SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry assays two bat cell lines transiently transfected various bat ACE2 (Bat2, 3, 31, 32, 33, 34, 38, 40) mutants (mutant Bat33, 34, 38 40m). results consistent derived human cells, confirming ACE2 main receptor species-specific entry SARS-CoV SARS-CoV-2 bat cells (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g). state. don’t work Thursday planned first shot line days scheduled second shot. heard rough get man flu figured I’d dead days lol UK, choice (for government) brands use variants like regular evolution - random error copying virus replicates usually impact serious/infectious is, makes worse, occasionally makes virulent.

I heard virus mutates, becomes contagious yet less dangerous.
 

Overall though, amount cases combine variants, compare amount cases month ago. larger amount cases now? can't claim covid dying number cases different 'variant' increases.  Right?!? people think wearing mask sacrifice, I've got wonder think selfish asshole looks like. I’m southeast city highly vaccinated population state that’s way behind vaccines. past 2-3 weeks I’ve finally adopted mentality I’m done wearing mask protect unvaccinated unless particular business requests it, I’m fine it. Delta talk nervous That’s part complaints mask wearing don’t get. It’s easy. effortless. Saying wearing mask exhausting like saying wearing shirt exhausting. Literally one ever said wearing shirt exhausting. Wait Delta variant cause hearing loss? new variants emerge concerned. Professionals field pretty much agreement live COVID. endemic. like flu, one shot next shot. Every year different cocktail sometimes guess wrong strains prevalent. discover new strains virus may come find evolved beyond current tech.

I'm paranoid doomsday like lot posts still see I'm sure there's harm cautious. February 2020 caught something wicked. COVID want ever again. COVID definitely want COVID understand COVID worse would described symptoms as. I'm still best keep goal. Nothing....Infact us getting AZ vaccine whole country dominated Delta... Good news. study peer reviewed? can’t see article. I'm gonna go latter there, chief.  freedom fine. lol mRNA vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer) may lead lifetime immunity least decades-long immunity least decades-long resistance.  sucks various ways. Bad vaccine overall awful them. immune systems bad, shouldn’t equally afraid getting disease? Phenomena, etc? won’t people disorder worn masks prior (and after) pandemic anyway? sound insensitive, what’s wearing mask going them? fully vaccinated vaccination almost effective mask. I’m going stop buying snicker bars peanuts people deathly allergic them. washing hands eating one ensure don’t accidentally touch someone strong allergy peanuts? onus safe, safe them. haha oof… sure wish could understand even little bit this. chance eli-5? good questions. think health authorities sort like train engineer speeding freight train. train takes long time stop receive word *might be* problem bridge ahead three choices: 1) keep throttle down, since know problem, 2) jam brakes, since maybe bridge down, 3) let throttle get information.

It sort COVID, since wait variant really break get data, even wait five six weeks data gets good, since takes time adverse events caught measured. June 11 report covering England delta variant: page 13, notes they've identified 33,000 delta cases, 28,000 less four weeks old, point people likely die. result, really know deal risk Delta. signs encouraging, others so.

For example, pure numbers basis, page 13 again, appears Delta patients much less likely hospitalized die. data super young, hard tell artifact data set.

Indeed, look page 50, controlled ""age, sex, 
ethnicity, area residence, index multiple deprivation, week specimen date, 
vaccination status international travel within 14 days prior specimen date"", Delta substantially severe, although provide sensitivity analysis explain controls driving difference.

Also troubling that, purely raw number basis, number double dosed vaccinated deaths Delta spiked single dosed deaths. nothing draw much conclusion about, since relative numbers tiny (only 42 deaths 33,000, 7 single dosers, 12 double dosers), little experience variant. (Page 15).

However, consistent nightmare hypothesis that, example, vaccines help prevent delta (80% 2nd dose, page 51), vaccines stop delta much deadly. not, simply early make sound conclusions.

So slam breaks, ease throttle give us time get data assess risk. ... that? anyone hear something? Anyway need get people back working! fun benefits like pizza fridays? whole snickers bar per person per week! Okay, okay, let's break big guns, personally walk around floor per month look everyone eye, shake hand, say ""thank service. valued."" What? everyone going?! 



That problem with^your ^generation!!.. ^none ^of ^^you ^^want ^^to ^^work ^^anymore! ^^^Come ^^^back ^^^here...  got vaccinated protect them.  saddest part story embarrassed. wanna put gold star forehead; winning life. Stay excellent. actually agree that, particularly flu season.

My problem comes everyone automatically supposed wear them, worse, avoid ""identified republican"", quite Twitter psychos quoted. *ahem*  That’s correct. vaccinations order magnitude impact. Vaccination, infection immunity, social distancing, masks, hygiene habits - order pieces Swiss cheese make epidemic response playbook. first two orders magnitude important masks. right. talking hitting fire two tanker trucks 12 man fire crew (vaccines) vs. water hose (masks). helps, vaccinations backstop matters .  delta, sigma , kappa idgaf!

I don’t know there’s count people allergic vaccine components.  wish people would read understand saying. 

I care people ""over"" masking unvaccinated. Delta proves virus adaptable could easily evolve something vaccine can't stop. Follow guidelines. Mask indoors. I’ve got Moderna developed nasty sore throat last couple days. COVID? Probably not. great time catch cold. take time day go get tested confirm it’s COVID. meantime I’m distracted wasting mental energy wondering is.

Not mention I’m planning finally go vacation I’m vaccinated. show negative test go abroad. mild infection even asymptomatic one yield positive test, would disqualify travel even it’s nothing worry health perspective.

So yeah, I’m going back masking Delta variant passes.  Yeah who’ve already it. go Huzzah! agree would preferable donate vaccines countries short supplies, Romania well enough afford recoup costs. moral standpoint, case assessed individual circumstances. always shades gray. right stay locked forever. Dude time get back life.

Let ask different question - campaigning lower speed limits? known quantity many people live every mph drop speed limit. fuck people? name companies? *cue tinfoil head*  Texas outside fair weather spring always benefited that. Nothing changed Abbott's flashy reopening. Blue areas changing little nothing mask wearing Biden admin said OK take red areas never wearing begin with.

The key thing watch unvaccinated counties late summer. Unvaccinated people back inside Texas air conditioning, bad spike last summer. think extremely strong evidence, One assume children relatively safe virus. We’ve several mutations children still fine. Ah yes I’m gonna listen someone fuckin word pessimist username “Up 100%” meaningless. point enough vaccinated open? One possible logical answer would herd immunity takes (70-85% pop vaccinated/immune, probably higher side Delta). country reached this, even Israel, poster child vaccination campaigns. you’re advocating seems bit unrealistic countries politically.

Whether think governments personal choice, one way reduce spread create artificial pockets high immunity risky situations (e.g. eating inside, etc.). great way encourage people vaccinate without requiring it. Nurses make pretty good money state (CA). RNs average $120k NPs $150k. I’m sure it’s difficult pandemic get better. hang there.

Aside that, fondest wish every last anti-vaxxer gets heaping helping COVID. wore N95 masks 9 hours day worst outbreak ordeal end day. Masks longer required I’m vaccinated, wear surgical mask, less tiring. would hate go back N95, much less N99. haven’t mass produced powered respirators now? urban areas quite well. rural areas absolutely awful vaccine uptake. That's quite misrepresentation, massive unmet demand vaccines - hence still age caps even ask one - still massive latent demand vaccines, govt even started advertising campaigns - *don't* vaccines.

Because Feds cheap, Aus bottom triage list negotiating need. hosp/death numbers become decoupled, we’ve done job via vaccines

Pure ignorance, you. Wow smarts It’s respiratory illness that’s highly contagious. I’m sure people think raw numbers ever going near 0. hosp/death numbers become decoupled, we’ve done job via vaccines Honestly it’s disappointing. got J&amp;J vaccine month half ago still don’t know shit lol long takes what? zero cases? zero deaths? arbitrary number cases deaths hospitalizations? don’t take antibiotics long takes. take set period time based science cynical trials. I’ll follow CDC recommendations like rational person should. Making medical science reality feels far close anti vax people do. think short version is

Unfortunately PM thumb arse. can't stand anymore. get vaccinated still can't reunited loved ones. Also, knew people going get political vaccines Unfortunately, answer. quite literally uncertain times. virus still new fully understand it. information changes, guidance.

This science always worked. Hypothesis, study/experiment, repeat. always lot maybes. first time people noticed it, they're realizing scientific research quite messy, often illuminating one would hope.

Nobody going offer definite guidance science definitively prove it. then, we're going keep hearing news report maybes almosts. Make vaccination requirement front door emergency room. Otherwise, come in. believed science you’d mandated said scientists accordingly. Tbf, SARS ""just go away"", MERS less. last comment think slightly,no majorly, care someone's life unvaxinated. One example give unvaxinated people unable get vaccinated due medical problems. others simply kids anti vaxers puts upper bound 0.375% IFR uk gov using covid then. real value likely even less vaccines much better preventing death infection. incredibly dangerous due strong comparison opiates. way easy overdose. IDK. media could wait experts agree reporting correct? Spamming populace every half cocked theory going make stop listening experts start listening snake oil salesmen.

Look many antivaxxers are. people likely listen facebook scammers, scammers least somewhat consistent. People scared going listen people waffle around seem story straight. Well intentioned incompetence killing people's faith media. We've pretty light run virus Perth, there's fair concern world developed far contagious variants whilst Australian govt - whatever reason - resting laurels, letting vaccines trickle due, purportedly unbelievably, [nickel diming Pfizer whilst outbreak (3 cases far) beaten - wonder rest winter+spring bring. even *dose* something strong?

According doses carfentanyl 100x stronger somehow dose 500 *nano*gram increments most. seriously doubt could reliably unless using professional lab equipment worth tens thousands dollars *and* formal training use correctly.

I mean manufacture 1 gram stuff dilute *two kilograms* inert material want final dose 1mg. even fraction weighting raw carfentanyl dilute could absolutely massive variations actual concentration final product.

It's wonder people dying left right shit.  pharmaceutical area truly amazing Northern LA also really board masks don’t understand hype surrounding delta. demonstrably least severe strain seen date. look data public health England actually track stuff. 8, table 2. 'full mathematical gambit', also known greek alphabet... think so, spent year listening kids whining masks, adults can't handle something might help others whining.

Kids seem better wearing masks adults, biased sample going places.   Same. went Ralphs Koreatown without mask, worried looking like asshole put back on. Even blue parts state? felt nothing sore arm. go second Wednesday looking forward done with. Yeah, even though vaccination rate pretty darn good (close 75% eligible adults) case rates low, I'm still wearing mask indoors unless I'm group know everyone vaccinated. paranoia, justify no-cost extra precaution take keep mom safe I'm around weekends helping out. knows immune system robust enough age decent antibody protection. wife still dining places outdoor seating too.

I'll add ever reason spend time indoors presence wife, would wear mask reason make comfortable. N95 mask fitted properly, going wear mask wear extremely effective one. …who appears invaded Florida vacation vaccinated.

""In vaccinated""? *Please* stop. It’s like South Park everything Stan thinks everything shit Perhaps either fear death welcome it. I'm fully vaccinated still wear mask public people can't get vaccine shot due legitimate medical condition. Yeah, imagine especially crappy vaccination rates US, masks good idea still, especially areas folks using them...  Appreciate understanding. think totally valid different people different risk tolerances. risk tolerance prefer keep wearing them, totally great! 

One thing I'd point -- 96% Pfizer efficacy rate Delta mean 4% vaccinated people catch Delta end hospitalized. Rather, efficacy rate calculated relative rate unvaccinated people. [So 96% efficacy vaccinated person 96% less likely end hospitalized unvaccinated person.

That said, might still level feel safer wearing mask. -- well, absolutely issue that! come back eventually. I'll still continue wearing mask whenever leave house even declare coronavirus eradicated. Canada awesome! wish Germans would learn vaccinate Sundays too... Thanks info! polymerase chain reaction. it’s actually standard covid test much reliable 15-minute test. usually takes day two get results back. believe urgent care places possibly hospital clinics offer walk-in basis usually free (?), check online providers area details. would good idea get one also self-isolate get results, case.  
 
Feel better soon!! Americans still understand mask never meant protect wearer, whole point mask protect around you. type thinking got us this

What type thinking imagining right now? specific, fact-check brutally. option #2 (less supply AZ Sinovac) sounds plausible.  Wow. rational headline… serious? 100F today Seattle. people feel claustrophobic them, sensory processing issues, case someone know reminds sensation wearing mask desert war. link people could potentially still become infected spread virus others.  wear constantly like did, make sure put time I'm near someone wearing theirs. I'm vaccinated, wear respect anyone yet feel comfortable walking around it, well anybody legit medical condition prevents safely getting vaccinated. thing comes government. inner city still hold outs masking. get outer rim suburbs, won’t see Literally, getting lethal. trying frame discussion exclude examples virus talking already mutated lethal. Honestly, CDC mucked big time. 


There's putting cork back bottle. \*really\* opted announce people vaccine go mask-off people yet vaccinated shouldn't, implies country is, level, worthy trusted ""honor system"". absolute bizarre choice trained sociologist (which feel like consulted announcements like this?) could spot mile away. 


Just embarrassing display naivety. It’s actually 18k, 4K added yesterday’s count.    Live northern California, see lot people still wearing masks stores, crowded places, restaurants (where take off). percentages definitely shifting 2 weeks since gov took Covid mandatory restrictions off, would expect --- short definite uptick outbreak cases locally --- fewer people mask become confident. Many local stores require masks and/or require staff mask still (serving public, knows people sick with). 
I still mask I'm one 10- 15 million immuno-suppressed Americans. antibody test good took third shot meds, waiting new test results. 
LA/SoCal still showing steady levels new cases, glad many people cautious. Places like Disneyland, Magic Mtn, etc. open state tourists, telling low-vaxxing states could exporting SoCal. republican states. I'm currently Midwest seems like folks, even blue voters, want ditch mask even though unvaccinated kids. Number 3 less correct Delta. Transmissions vaccinated people unvaccinated reasonably common, even transmissions vaccinated people happen.

[Singapore's transmission visualization good place see this. Basically everything Delta lot people fully vaccinated. Yet many breakthroughs vaccinated people, small percentage total transmissions vaccinated.

The WHO's statement vaccinated people wear masks completely point world: less 25% population gotten first dose, really important buy time vaccinations slowing spread. US makes less since, time going much except bring higher-risk period fall. Still, mask wearing public situations really low cost so...maybe worth it. also might better much unvaccinated population catch COVID possible summer schools closed seasonal health high. got shots first opportunity could ❄ Same. Masks optional. partitions. social distancing. Classes 100% capacity. Online funding eliminated. 

*Sigh* 

We homeschooling another year. Same. quit wearing one. I'm going start again. 

This vaccinated people wanted others get vaccinated, too. non-vaccinated people making spreading variants! St Cloud month ago got full-on screamed 3 different random people wearing mask. One person seemed think wearing mask means refuse vaccinated refused hear otherwise, two seemed think trying scare kids wearing it.

I could count total number masks saw 3 days one hand. best err side safety indeed.  There's saying ""If everywhere go smells like dog shit, check shoe""  I'm pro vaxxer shit gotta stop. stop. added indoor masking again. big restriction. USA add restrictions Covid unless super strain evades vaccines completely spreads rate measles. Shots available risk adults. get shot good. best luck. screaming point year now. good.

Outdoor masking highly visible reassures anxious people. completely agree makes said people misevaluate risk go home work catch COVID. think visibility makes easy governments look like taking action.

With recent highly suspect “scarily fleeting” transmission supposedly caught CCTV Australia, doubt outdoor masking going away places anytime soon. 45 weeks?!? got second AZ shot 6 weeks :| im wearing mask unless mandated

That's news. We've seen millions people behaving like since last year. experience. LA right moment (having come NY), would say 60% indoors–restaurants, clothing stores, shops, CVS–unmasked. lifted mask mandate less 2 weeks ago jfc  I’m even friends someone J&amp;J purpose surveillance, vaccine breakthrough infection defined detection SARS-CoV-2 RNA antigen respiratory specimen collected person ≥14 days completed recommended doses U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized COVID-19 vaccine.

Yes, agree people vaccine **get** covid-19. **spread** it? believe things tipping things back wearing mask are:

1) 12 year olds can't vaccinated yet

2) Delta variant apparently impacts children much original variant does. 

So vaccinated people mask effort protect children.  Seriously.  thanks  Texas people stopped wearing masks. 10/10 pple won’t wear. going barrels fun climate crisis really kicks off. Nice much information literally finger tips

I think that's part problem. lot information wildly varying truth quality. One central problems modern society nobody understand everything. rely experts explanations, anybody claim ""expert"", multiple people claim expertise disagree?

I fortunate enough stumbled across good experts pandemic -- knew Derek Lowe great writing [medicinal paid close attention said back spring 2020, somebody sub pointed Vincent Racaniello's [This Week summer. tolerance reading listening things quite understand everything they're saying (so I'll slog even though remember thing freshman chemistry) lot people don't. would natural selection reduced odds breeding. utmost respect honest self-assessment learned it. Thank you. Sorry said correct. think needs read up. never said *reduce* transmission (which, sure, does), *STOP* it? Especially confined enclosed space.   4 years 0-11 year olds small subset population. Guesstimating based [persons 5 6% least 12% population can’t vaccinated, ignoring immunocompromised. That’s like saying don’t care every left-handed person gets sick (lefties actually slightly smaller group, roughly 11% last checked).

Also, least [one twenty (or [maybe much get COVID get “[long could mean lifelong health issues. It’s awfully cavalier okay two million kids (330 MM times 12% divided 20) catching virus gives long term health complications. 

Put another way, every 5% kids 12 long COVID you’re looking 2 million plus symptoms range breathing difficulties bedridden. taking much seriously. connection Scotland vs. England match? die covid would personally love make fun funeral family would inevitably waste money on. going happen know you’re invited I’m also Missouri. Vaccinated day one. Still wearing mask. wear mainly encourage everyone keep socially acceptable so. plan take kids get vaccinated.

Also, we’re 41% blue here. Nah mate. lucky country evidence delta variant likely kill variant, contagious.  Wearing mask indoors grocery store sacrifice, mean feel like wearing mask forever knowing literally stopped flu spreading almost entirely, could care less wearing mask mundane environment going get groceries get I'm socialize try look good... wearing mask difficult really know hard life people world refuse.  talked boss told drove across country multiple states never wore mask freeing. good Lord's time take home that's there's nothing it. yeah I've got obstacles. Lockdowns, lockdowns…. gonna work long without better vaccine rollouts know keep detecting coronavirus sewage? wonder we're supposed put masks assholes, fact one's reason keeps spreading Kids 18 IFR less .1% LOT spread Evangelical Churches USA. lot people already it, so, immunity even though Christian right general refusing vaccines... even though Trump got his... crazy situation. get common cold, may run mill colds. N95 mask protect really tell wear masks.  I'm Oklahoma. Hardly anyone wearing mask anymore. think that's going gets mask think sit hours seep eventually. bad don’t vaccine arrogance. taught year mask exiting front door got home, say wore it, less bothered me. would encourage wearing around house increasing periods time help feel comfortable. Dropping jaw breathing mouth also help.

Good luck you! I’m going complete pragmatist here. I’d rather go school year much immunity general population possible. Ideally would vaccines dropping mask recommendation speeds getting antibodies artisanal way. Don’t think everyone’s immune systems kind shot year social distancing mask wearing? Colds bound happen especially kids start socializing like “normal” again. Unless new normal really living sterilized bubble…. Idk doesn’t seem like good thing me. Imagine state health officer Mississippi. Nobody state gives shit health Current vaccines may good… now. variants coming vaccines go along it. one knows, think so. Time tell… majority people killed covid already serious illness.

The hell mean? Suppose serious illness died, DIED COVID. pushed edge it. alive getting health issues, got covid, died.  That's covid even scenario.

You're right accurate number, highly likely real number much much higher. uniformly 50-60%. East West LA 70-80% balanced 30-50% North South LA. latter group also really wear masks. vaccine 95% effective, always chance vaccinated person could spread it. Nothing 100% effective. mom sister boat since covid studies cite demonstrating masks protect wearer? Sad.   Full blown severe infections including death. would shed point? Long term affects could potential way worse initial deaths, disease affects cardio vascular system, means affect every vital organ body. could potentially reduce life span dramatically, worse type virus lays dormant pops back every often like hiv hpv Many countries don’t access vaccines. ultra-specific mRNA response telling sars-cov-2 “mutate protein you’ll able bypass vaccinated people”

I think natural immunity traditional vaccines going fair better long haul. one knows, plenty pretend to. opinion. Fuck, wonder keep getting sick (/s) got covid tested immediately reading new delta variant got paranoid % protected Pfizer.

You realize take time, got tested immediately might false soon exposure test positive take almost week exposure COVID-19 register positive test contact tracing found Stupid Anti-vaxxers tend cluster together. basically public health officials play nanny lazy get shots, they're going maskless public indoor areas anyway. 

All vaccinated pay price carelessness. What's happening vaccinated still protected unvaxed infecting large clusters particular neighborhoods. Cali ""red"" we'd say oh well, bad, sad let Darwinism finish off. LA bends backward give second chances even derelict.   Maybe Trump actually took COVID-19 seriously instead making light since start, people would consider motives. hey it’s flu, go away April.

The difference countries actually deal pandemic along flight bans, mask on, quarantine, health checks air ports. Funny mention Trump.   much?  I'm work indoors wear mask one else wears one.  good that?  10 15 mouth breathers office breathing germs air. germs float settling mask, clothes, eyes. point people vaccinated testing positive explain increase cause mortality last year? Mine? peoples'? saw coming would difficult make people wear mask stopped using it. early remove mask rule.   disagree. working well people scared willing let others take risk lesson own. would fall blanket ""in case risk bad outcome covid less flu even without vaccine"" premise fundamentally wrong.

I guess is. They're .2% risk, better mask whole city protect kids anti-vaxxer parents. trying dick willing wear rest life people? Even herd immunity achieved people still danger. vaccines like traditional vaccines, it’s completely different technology. mRNA vaccines generate immune response single protein. Traditional vaccines generate multi-antigenic response. virus mutates protein, escape response. don’t know it’s possible. Natural immunity traditional vaccines could better case. 

mRNA vaccines granted emergency use authorisation easily mass produced. would great whole world took time made virus go extinct - there’s lot people different countries don’t vaccine, virus still large evolving - don’t see mRNA vaccines working long… maybe current variants it’s evolving way.

There new variants new vaccines go along it. 

Just opinion, time tell, reconvene Also less people vaccinated would think, like 50-60% LA county see restaurant different people either eating mentally eating mindset. vaccinated people wanted others get vaccinated, too. non-vaccinated people making spreading variants!

This basically inevitable CDC issued guidance vaccinated Americans need masks.  

They perhaps could follow through.  way tell vaccinated conspiracy theorist want part wear mask.  

In era rampant misinformation conspiracy theories, can't rely everyone right thing. family runs liquor store near get sick last 18 months, masks came California stopped well, went today without mask lady wishing family well suddenly got sick. vaccinated. ""99% sUrViVaL RaTe!!!"" NY/NJ relaxing masks. places still strict, others (bars) make selling point take mask getting ID’d. I’d give 7/10 masks. folks still wear em outdoors.

But least guys aren’t right top like big city east coast. short stay Austin last December, plenty easy distance, non covidiots take seriously vaccine moment prevents infection. fully vaxxed wearing one indoor spaces catch mild case spread family members (one waiting second shot one 2 shots old). Also, feel costs nothing wear mask, bother all... lot unvaxxed non mask wearing people live, although 50% people stores still masked. think vaccinated people still wearing masks people masks much likely anti vaxxers anti maskers, can't prove course. tell you, almost anyone see wearing mask US, vaccine. (I actually wear two masks, one surgical one cloth fit stop air leaks protecting air inhale virus.) 18,000 COVID-19 deaths occurred May, around 150, 0.8% fully vaccinated people. 

That's amazing. seen actual number like before. hospital staff saying almost always unvaccinated people. numbers. 95, RI 20, NH 16, 27, VT 6, CT 41 well we’re 200!
And almost 15m people swear God whole thing like Dr. Seuss's star-bellied sneetches.  felt slightly crummy hours. pure hell earth, rivaled experiences first world war. get vaccinated, odds dying covid less odds dying flu. odds spreading covid also drastically, drastically lowered.

If get vaccinated, either choosing to, thus deserve whatever comes covid, 12, case risk bad outcome covid less flu even without vaccine.

The group left immunocompromised people can't get vaccinated, expected keep wearing masks forever this? see that's viable solution - delta variant us forever. said effective hospitalization, getting Covid. two different things. Pfizer 96% effective stopping hospitalization 2 doses. Hospitalization different symptomatic infection study found one dose, AstraZeneca 71 per cent effective, Pfizer 94 per cent effective Delta two doses, AstraZeneca 92 per cent effective, Pfizer 96 per cent effective.

You 33% protection symptoms Indian variant, protection severe disease hospitalization goes way even one dose. Vaccines also allocated rural areas first state direction governor. know people driving 100+ miles main cities get vaccine areas. 

We also July 4th coming huge Lake Ozarks. Luckily, mostly outdoor oriented, would expect numbers go up. draws people state. 

The saddest thing people need treatment get shipped receive treatment separated families probably trying times lives maybe pass. Nobody deserves that, even worst anti vax toxic person world. suffers, everyone know. Popular kids club /s ... didnt know this? year study risk COVID-19 children. “Some say” problem me, tell many study comes instead peddling worst case scenarios masses like it’s norm click article. particular vaccine, totally free right? Anyone physically US walk pharmacy stock say insurance &amp; still able get vaccine. shit like saying one dies AIDS. 

Shits whack. Thanks link, hopefully correction safeties sake avoid swell!    fall comes we're concerts bars clubs everything's fully ""back normal"", widespread cases everywhere.

Maybe.

But honestly -- anyone age 12+ get vaccine, highest mortality group (seniors) mostly vaccinated, evidence comes suggesting Delta (or another variant) significant vaccine evasion -- say that's tradeoff worth taking Which, weird way, I'm worried long term symptoms COVID, aside fact I'm vaccinated. know there's portion people long haul COVID legitimately effect medically measurable issue. I'd willing bet money majority long haulers (or sizable portion affected symptoms get defined that) people complain fibro: likely 30 something women, histories medical anxiety, depression, lower tolerance pain women men.  mask tho It’s probably both—these vaccines offer protection years, different variants may reduce efficacy boosters needed restore high level protection new mutations COVID March 2020 idea (was symptomatic, know covid lol.) Thought weird smell all, things would taste very...chemicall-y? get smell back beginning September 2020 taste thing cleared around also. remember excited smell nature booster shot needed year, it’s great! kind ethos fighting make life better marginalized people. They’re wrong. One shot Pfizer 33% effective Delta variant, two doses 88% effective. 

Source: Moderna used dosage knew really really high order give trials best possible chance success. currently trialing much smaller doses, theoretically provoke less intense response. time booster thing, probably okay. eh....

It’s unpopular Reddit, honestly think CDC made right call.

Just really hard justify blunt interventions everyone indeterminate amount time 1) vaccine available basically anyone age 12+; 2) current infection rate \~4/100,000; 3) underlying disease mortality rate &lt;1% (yes, know mortality isn’t outcome interest, hospitalizations important ones)

At point, we’ve given people free way turn disease something much less risky flu. don’t take it… well that’s choice Correct, never ordered (In time/amount needed). Thus failed policy Vaccinated people aren’t serious symptoms Delta, appears may still able catch spread symptomatic.

Isn't case COVID previous variants though? I'm probably wrong thought known vaccinated people could spread COVID others right? comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

My work considered essential national defense offered vaccine February early March. third coworkers got shot third people come covid. fully vaccinated people forego masks still see half people still wearing masks (unvaccinated).

Also governor moron. suffer problem Kentucky perpetually electing worst possible leaders. Remember Josh Hawley? behalf 35% Missourians: I'm sorry. don’t vaccines (and definitely should) still get it. Take look online released delayed second doses coming UK Canada. delays arose necessity research preliminary actually quite promising. Way edit comment. respond initial comment (the automod removed sourced version, happy share links via dm):

Smallpox, yes:

""Still, subsequent smallpox outbreaks America shown low lethality, virus caused epidemics given name variola minor alastrim. spread American continent, evolution West African subtype variola virus led reduction case fatality rate smallpox 12% less 1%.""

I can't find evidence polio one way other, note polio seems tight constraints evolution, may mean capable mutating much less severe.

HIV spreads differently viruses mention discovered 40 years ago. I'm sure draw conclusions that.

Do examples viruses tend towards higher severity time? solution double-blinded studies, they’re ethically technically almost impossible situation. You’d COVID-positive subjects *not know* COVID... almost impossible number reasons. CDC knew delta variant, plus fully vaccinated rate 33% population.

Their ""no need masks vaccinated, recommend following honor system"" extremely idiotic. That's probably New England combined right now. Fucking. Vaccinate. deaths kids? Yeah like people waiting cdc. 😂 worldwide vaccine inequality whats going keep covid going potentially decades. (rich) vaccinated countries offer serious help rest world never truly end.

Hell self interest terms business, travel tourism surges stronger mutated variants. know caring humans much hard sell. Check UK's PHE reports. probably there.   Alright champ Whoa, back Jan 37,000 people hospital due covid! That's insane. 

You're right though per day. 1500 ain't bad guess 15k cases per day (And cases get tested). vaccinated ones. mainly due increased transmission. Delta Plus + increased transmission *less* efficacy vaccines still protect reduce severity. 

But Delta Delta+ show massive PITA variants be. *possible* serious variants emerge, particularly Delta / AY.1 lineage.  likely wearing masks social distancing annihilated flu. Funny enough, it’ll come right back winter practices ease flu normal nobody gives fuck wear mask help others. Sorry live Idaho I’m really cynical it. It’s absolutely ignore guidance gave TEN DAYS earlier

Fauci said reversal hoped May 2022 would look normal. 

The entire reversal dripped economic panic financial markets within Biden admin saying speed unmasking I'm actually wondering part road time passes. really social protocol yet asking vaccines, usually thing people disclose say 1st date/meeting. Even vaccine passports things like companies/universities/large events, really nothing besides plain old trust one another right thing &amp; got vaccine(s). Better safe sorry course, still bound awkward ask, pandemic year everyone's going probably move assume everyone got theirs. Yup. I’m part one. really sucks. Virus money new blood money Yeah, cause ones went real shit. You, however, know shit. Wrong chart, one using daily admissions.

Try one: shows like bit 1500 hospital 24 June.

In case, numbers UK pretty awesome, I'm USA would love see numbers like that.

Cheers! What? many use cases right. Sadly offset one downvote. issue one tell future actually holds. educated guesses. I’ll keeping eyes CDC local public health official guidance. meantime enjoying vaccinated status going mask free. feel kids individuals can’t get vaccinated hopefully kids safely vaccinated sooner rather later. Scientists best can, thank that.  problem countries access it, aren’t fully taking advantage it. USA example plateaued 50% fully vax’d. expected point, pretty sad number. People stopped wearing masks going start again. Fall ways off. Lot change then, hopefully not. 

You can't ever go officials say now. Saying masks Fall stupid. idea Fall bring terms seasonal severity nrw variants may be. 

It's like everytime say variant VUI VOC, every article point quote official saying it. 

But mean jack shit reality. could see Delta tearing UK. Everybody could. obviously going VOC five minutes denial. 

You gotta pay attention. freak horrible VOC going around, wait permission wear mask that's spreads far keep getting new variants.

They still fine though Reducing argument one based solely authority rather strawman, not? one thing say someone simply relying upon ""false authority,"" authority figure holds (false) power, another say relying upon advice recommendations numerous scientists. assumed would agree scientists reliable, disagree this, must assume argument relies appeal false authority, false authority represents numerous scientists researchers. unless willing state outright believe vaccine researchers scientists false authorities, cannot claim argument suffers appeal false authority.

It true make conclusions 6 months based real world evidence. seems like poor decision also rely upon decades vaccine research theorizes vaccines safe long future. research prior vaccines given us evidence new covid vaccines cause long-term harm. evidence true, perhaps different type evidence willing accept. find decision *not accept* evidence poor decision, ultimately everyone decide. Nevertheless, essentially making argument relies proving negative, requires inordinate burden proof. point [one articles says clearly following mRNA COVID-19 mRNA vaccines new, type vaccine studied people before.** mRNA vaccines HIV, rabies, Zika flu tested phase 1 phase 2 trials people. technology also used clinical trials way treat cancers. Even though products licensed use people, efforts provided important information mRNA technology safety.

In words, mRNA vaccines completely new claim. Moreover, developed decades. research used develop vaccines include fundamental applied research. [As article explains (the path mRNA covid fundamental research focuses understanding underlying mechanisms biology, cellular molecular factors, forth. Fundamental research led better understanding vaccines work, better understanding long term safety. words, scientists claiming safe prior knowledge past vaccines, also understand mechanisms function. 

I think made argument strawman. argument gives impression scientists clue mRNA vaccines work, way find happen future wait. approaches—science doubt requires hypotheses tests, informed theory equally important. Anyway, wanted *real* strawman: claims many ways equivalent looking water saying, ""I know water wet tested particular water."" course, lacks lot nuance, fact remains science made claim new vaccines safe effective, signs pointing safe long term well. 

The basis belief informed research. want know vaccines work, read up. Same. best run months night. Every single time strengthens view recommendations made whim people care less science. Good riddance, asshole. realistic? It’s literally happening right US. Look window sometime. N95 masks fit kids? I’ve seen adult N95 masks easy find local hardware store, least adults, can’t get vaccinated want safety, could wear N95, might different kids So, anyone eli5 delta variant deal? thought two shots would good...now hear people saying put mask again? What's up? Fl matters all. IIRC, extra interest word Corona, fact talked much, resulted increase Corona beer sales We’re never eliminating covid-19, it’s never happening. feel immunocompromised, really do.. know world going go back way was. can’t won’t keep living like it’s July 2020. world open back up, communities take necessary precautions pandemic. ask “the responsible” people want, won’t make difference. friend mild covid says Pepsi still tastes like garlic. Finland, cut postal service wages, postal union went strike, wages cut, politician charge move cut wages resigned. Worth whatever downside unions type power.  definitely think hit it. thought beginning would last weeks couple months most. Don’t think people saw year. got vaccines people say that’s still enough. gets tiring sure 

There’s lot talk bringing back mask mandates even vaccinated people... frustrating say happened Well caused spiral much lower risk severe illness, hospitalization death means spread family, co-workers, friends, church/faith group members. true. look dropping comments last 6 months. We've gone 6-8k comments day 2k since December/January. ignoring data shows two doses mRNA vaccines substantially reduce transmission, sometimes 90%. per CDC studies well. Stuff like upvoted it’s true, unlike misinformation spreading.

Please provide actual, substantial data Singapore comments. ever presented evidence online tracking tool dubious relevance. official data, peer reviewed data. Unless already recovered COVID. I'm done County's wishy-washy bs.

LA County forced admit court data supporting ban outdoor dining. Despite this, went ahead banned outdoor televisions turned months holidays. county joke emergency powers permanently stripped it. I’m following news Israel. like 80% vaccinated Pfizer bunch break throughs variant. sacrifice able see friends family last year half? Would consider sacrifice? think might stats throwing people off. elderly fully vaccinated (thankfully), delta variant hitting non-vacc'd hard, charts show young people getting sick higher proportion total numbers, time last year. Virus dangerous young children according every statistic use determine severity  mild way know got covid loss smell hasnt experience, county past 70% masks common anymore. high vaccine uptake low case numbers fringe cases people see need anymore  Taking vaccine also great way mitigate risk. AZ first, Moderna 2nd, laid day 2 2nd shot 9pm night. Pfizer round one moderna yesterday. still able come work today I'm definitely feeling kinda shitty can't wait get here. Feel better! keep spamming legitimate data support it. It’s based online tracking tool you’ve linked to. data substantive, controlled, peer reviewed. glasses fogging up, mask fitted wrong: means air going around mask instead it. Make sure properly adjusted nose piece; sources recommend putting glasses top mask's nose section keep place better. Ehhh that’s kinda really overtly black white way thinking. huge Covid spike hospitals aren’t handling well leadership looks like overwhelmed, voted either general primary elections donors pretty relevant, no? mean, pretty silly idea equality freedom. one seems realize restrictions anything already, society. Sure, go around naked property one give shit, second run government building butt naked likely arrested. 😂 can’t kind thing freely, able essentially something *more* harmful still get away privately owned property? People telling Pfizer ineffective Delta variant... anyone know that's true? hope get nothing. Even Chinese officials admit Sinovac effective enough... states... Exactly. spent last year taking college courses remotely even though terrible. barely learn anything online courses like in-person. Didn’t get see friends really didn’t get go movie theater. part - wore mask year even though really wants wear it? people don’t clean knows stuff sticks mention they’re pain someone sneeze... plus, don’t get see people’s faces see smile big part human. Like said, it’d take something big make people go back torture last year seemingly people think go back every time variant concern

I got vaccinated everyone wanted got it. I’m giving normal life someone chose get vaccine. Certainly, bet aren’t giving either. It’s choice end day. would hope would want convince get there’s much Ireland means rain warm. Stay home. go anywhere.  everything delivered. paranoid virus deadly baby common cold never leave house again, even pandemic over. That's choice.  finally got rid mask mandate 2 weeks ago work. I've worked 18 months seen coworker's faces like 3 lol. reading right? chance hospitalized 30 year old male get infected around 2.7%? assume vaccine knocks 96% go efficacy data released England? would likely 0.135% chance hospitalization I’m vaccinated get infected? misreading Economist’s chart attributing extra effect vaccine they’ve already accounted it? exactly surprise me, always sort thought way. Lol think hit point yet? least south hit probably 9 months ago I've done lot grocery shopping Asian stores since started. Everyone masked, one gives grief wearing mask. mean California reinstated mask mandate five days less 100 people “ dealta” variant want vaccines. government supply. issue people wanting vaccine uptake Ireland extremely high offered vaccine. wooow, something expecting all.   Scream right back tell mind damned business. seniority issue probably largest problem unions, overall bringing power balance employee employer relationship overall positive. Hey guy, missed absolutely critical gifts, frankly expect every hospital admin. poor quality travel mugs towels. 1st 2nd shift, they'll gone time 3rd shift comes in. wonder fail even though vaccine really early. something manufacture sputnik government given enough effort vaccinate people? lies problem. vaccine rates USA aren’t high enough. It’s easy say “fuck unvaccinated people” unfortunately mayors congressmen can’t that. need think unvaccinated.

Political leaders give fuck unvaccinated. vaccinated. anyone else matter. care doners doners need things open make money. doners making money, they're gonna donating money. Zuck undid imo speaks entire world. Many counties vaccination levels equal US countries. Worldwide, may make sense. I'd interested country's CDC says rather WHO. Especially country average vaccination levels. studies people 12 first.  No, means that, like things, burden falls responsible people. Getting R&lt;1 numbers game, since irresponsible people taking away easiest path reproduction rate, additional measures asked responsible people Good luck that.

I’m actually amazed many people personally know didn’t get particularly sick Covid lost sense taste still haven’t regained it. actually would really suck. I’d get vaccinated reason alone. You, /u/klyrish /u/ravroid good, caring, considerate, helpful, conscious people.

They'll give weird looks etc forget good people need told every day good human beings, thank you! 💛🧡💗  fully vaccinated. would trust science, like before. CDC says safe. hospitalisations rather deaths? Upton Sinclair reddit? root covid cause infinite lockdowns paranoid recluse.

I don’t straw man BS. go somewhere else that.

If you’re talking [this it’s referring Delta Plus variant, Delta variant article posted here. Maybe think that’s splitting hairs, Delta variant 80 countries something like 90% cases India. Delta Plus variant, stated article you’re referring to, Indian government's Covid-19 genome sequencing body, Delta Plus variant exhibits several worrying traits increased transmissibility, stronger binding receptors lung cells, potential reduction antibody coronavirus vaccines designed train body recognize spike protein, parts -- place Delta Plus' extra mutation enough evidence determine anything conclusively yet experts expressed caution.”

So, again, cherry picked information article make look like they’re making big deal nothing. actually Delta variant proven much transmissible majority strain many areas world. Delta plus variant still fairly new looked at, concerning.

“Strongly urging” people wear masks information confirmed alarmist slightest. It’s learning harsh lesson learned last year. swear point genuinely feels like people fantasizing dislike disagree dying en masse. know death rate virus. We've known long time yet time time keep reading going black plague &lt;insert undesirables . Mass deaths pending Texans mask mandate lifted. Florida going wipe entire elderly population. anti-vaxxers left anywhere Delta tears them! There's opinion CDC told people stop wearing masks fully vaccinated, strategy make vaccine appealing vaccine-hesitant. studied clinical trials age. People different ages different responses, studied population approved population.  Man reading sub would swear way people would stop worried eradicate covid even according top scientists never happen. vaccinated statistically better chance dying flu car crash. levels risk accept society don’t see majority vaccinated people willingly going back lockdown mandatory mask wearing unless data comes saying vaccine longer effective variants. opposite. deal elderly lady deliberately going wrong way aisle could ram (empty) cart people scream wearing mask standing governor. (Not proudest moment threatening old lady beating second pass, patience lot them.) Arm pain problem. Everybody gets tetanus shots live... nobody refuses tetanus shot arm pain, they? (Maybe tough guys big pickup trucks...)

I’d interested 3 days fever missing work laying bed like last time 😂 getting vaccinated refusing mitigate spread way, thus sticking coworkers quarantine rational. 

What gross comment. Go away. clinical trial data indicating safety vaccine. reports myocarditis individuals Pfizer, number small enough positive impact vaccine outweighs potential harm. seen real surges recently outside highly unvaccinated areas.

People cautious looking charts like [this showing Delta (purple) clearly increasing quickly filter rest COVID cases... hard tell sure much adding cases happened opposed replacing cases would different variant Delta around. looking early indicators like that, we're trying take action *before* there's surge. , getting hospitalized elderly sick . would sub accomplish daily discussion provide? I'm legitimately asking. mean like start text thread saying ""I question xyz...""? allow text threads like entire sub would become this, generally repetitive. would suggest maybe checking local subs, allow text posts.

Or ask question here. J&amp;J 100% effective hospitalization death? **Highlights** 
____ 
____ 
• 30% mild COVID-19 patients reduced taste smell 90 days. 
• 5% mild COVID-19 patients dyspnoea 30 days. 
• Cough, sore throat, headache, muscle pain, fever increased 30 days. 
• Women older persons susceptible COVID-19 symptoms. 
 
____ 
____ 
**Objective** 
Our study aimed compare symptoms day day non-hospitalized individuals testing positive negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
 
**Methods** 
In total, 210 positive-test 630 negative-test healthcare workers Central Denmark Region followed 90 days testing, April June, 2020. daily reported COVID-19-related symptoms compared graphically logistic regression. 
 
**Results**
Thirty per cent positive-test close 0% negative-test participants reported reduced sense taste smell 90 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 86.07, 95% CI 22.86–323). Dyspnea reported initial 20% positive-test participants, declining 5% 30 days, without ever reaching level negative-test participants (aOR 6.88, 95% CI 2.41–19.63). Cough, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, fever temporarily prevalent among positive-test participants; 30 days, increases seen. Women older participants susceptible long-lasting COVID-19 symptoms. 
 
**Conclusion**
The prevalence long-lasting reduced sense taste smell highly increased mild COVID-19 patients. pattern also seen dyspnea low level, cough, sore throat, headache, muscle pain, fever. mother law got JJ. want go back get Pfizer Moderna. anyone know safe do? society gives early nothing effective. course giver uppers talk  Early data side effects nasal sprays induce lower side effects (certainly arm pain) however comprehensively evaluated covid vaccine candidates large trials. 

They're likely targeted first children. Sputnik shot evaluated way younger people, data whether suitable booster planned come out, although may take many months-- think strategy countries would like aim for

Other nasal vaccines also tablets works early Tris.

Fingers crossed see good results certainly one way increasing uptake, plus logistically need trained professionals administer, needle recycling, smaller amount vaccine required used etc. data showing delta variant gives kids severe symptoms original virus? Delta variant apparently impacts children much original variant does.

This misunderstanding statistics. 

Children make higher percentage people affected Delta variant least vaccinated group time Delta variant became widespread. variant contagious say 4th July going mass spreader.  people chance. instead taking it, risk health (oh well, cares?), importantly, cannot vaccinated whatever reason (immuno-compromised, young). 
 
People knowingly risk well-being vulnerable people sympathy - fuck 'em, world better without them. also experience reaction first shot?  Lol. right answer. agree completely points, think could done taken seriously start. still taking seriously people still getting sick dying every day.  I’m obese haven’t gotten sick years since eat healthily exercise don’t need experimental gene serum Except there’s data suggesting vaccinated people spread variant significant rate. It’s mainly unvaccinated community. Wearing mask vaccinated doesn’t make whole lot sense. Mandatory vaccinations people refuse get would far effective. thats helps sleep night. sooner die better tbh dont care much. 1 year time chose get vaccine require treatment denied coverage said treatment maybe bankruptcy good enough incentive. Doubt though testing wasn’t done age groups once. tested adults first, problems they’d know test kids. tested older kids, tests went well started tests younger kids. Therefore, trials finished different times, we’re pretty sure vaccine safe small children, FDA isn’t going approve vaccine based “pretty sure.” actually wait trials finished sent approval process. couple months ago got downvoting oblivion, called horrible names, sent death threats said vaccination passports certain activities good idea.

And now, surprise surprise, it’s basically coming serious restrictions everyone. 

yeah... no, not. Even UK Delta variant spreads, hospitals overwhelmed longer danger early 2020, least US

A pro ""show papers"" guy gonna get angry reactions, expect obviously problem wound care. keep increasing pt staff ratios causing people leave, makes situation worse people leave. endless cycle. when? virus isn’t getting eradicated name next one Loki   option close everything? 

Open everything let people choose level risk acceptable. Masking couple days sick different permanent indoor masking like talking about. Thank you!  It’s four strains. good given year depends accurate epidemiologists predicting strains prevalent year.  know well vaccinated spread really, could easily causing too. small inefficiencies ignored? Ahh that’s I’m saying, implication plain stupid. coworker wishes mask cold it, I’m going wear mask since I’m vaccinated covid chance may randomly come contact someone immuno compromised, knew risks went out. one cared Swine Flu occurred, one cared general till pandemic. yeah going fend comes public. See myocarditis incredibly rare. Also clears easily treatment.

You probably know virus causes myocarditis well many symptoms. 

So, no, aren’t worried easily treatable incredibly rare event. worried infecting vulnerable patients. large number infections patients infected hospital reasons. Reddit maybe 1 year away done-zo.

Within year bots going ones allowed post. 

I got hit ""inciting violence"" saying ""we let religion die out""

just shitty website, run dicks sold china second chance. sub's rule change title article? original title ""Russia's Sputnik V shot around 90% effective Delta variant, developers say"" Thanks clarifying. lot mixed messages there. Thank replying! I'm glad hear already feeling better! I'm still waiting second shot I'm bit scared side effects tbh. first shot sore arm felt bit tired two days. may still hope! back September getting smells back past month. could smell cat's litterbox clover blooms daughter plucked me(light pleasant smells giving end grief). got cold lasted 2.5 weeks heavy coughing year getting sick. Turned negative Covid. Got Moderna too. many Minnesota family members, I've always assumed Minnesota Nice sarcastic phrase side family passive aggressive judgmental af. would talk doctors! I’ve heard discussed, studies even say it’s helpful longer term protection. studies preliminary. I’d certainly consult doctors trying add different vaccines. Whatever happened J &amp; J's 2 dose trial? Thank posting , I’m trying understand well ! mask can’t spread someone unvaccinated care others wear masks? bother YOU? ...you still catch covid, vaccinated people spread vaccinated people. Open everything everyone let people choose what's safe enough. Yet another misleading article mixes *proportional increase* Delta variant vs. increasing case rate (for clickbait). Mississippi even top 10 states population-adjusted Covid cases per day. case numbers flattened June still 5/100K/day. could better vaccinations unvaccinated people may serious problem fall/winter seasonal effect comes play. moment, ""rapid"" spreading.  2019, sitting hospital Schenectady, NY getting one series rabies shots, nurse casually tried sell going school nurse. like “We’re short need more!”. Vaccinated still spread get sick it. effectiveness awesome (above 90) it’s 100% means fully vaccinated people still get sick spread virus. 10 people get sick two die one vaccinated one would look like half deaths vaccinated. complicated numbers show. you’re vaccinated , can’t pass someone isn’t , ? scientific evidence ? Vaccinated people getting infected plays differently unvaccinated people getting infected. even case, immune system well prepared fight infection.

From die need hospitalization, nearly unvaccinated. Maybe, maybe not, knows. 25% country done first shot, averaging 5.2 million shots day, it’s getting ramped hopefully end year everybody least 1 dose 2. Idk tried looking pressure reliever goes behind head choose masking whatever reasons future. luck, mask mandates avoided injuries recover soon. bit funny guys still throw term around incorrectly. hospital CEOs admin staff gets paid better nurses frontline workers even bring hospital?

It's like traditional bussiness CEO make sales deals investment deals etc. 

Question is... non-frontline staff bring revenue hospital comperable pay getting? open everyone let people choose selves what's acceptable level risk. going absurd cdc ends backtrack call masks indoors everyone. never changed guidance. thought getting vaccinated greatly reduces viral load transmission, assumed part guidance ?  I'm vaccinated. I'm done wearing masks.. Sure test this.  

Try sitting inside unmasked covid patients 10 hours see goes mask eventually.  Let know.   like skunkish savory makes sense whole new smell unlike anything ive ever smelled before. Ouffff cuz 2 secs holding door open really drains time… mask wearing gotten confusing (MA). I’m fully vaccinated awhile find getting really confused wear mask. stores places still ask to, do. Others never removed “wear mask” sign death glare come store mask guess assume must unvaccinated. I’m point I’ve given trying figure wear mask everywhere again. need mask says “vaccinated confused” something similar.   It’s impossible separate worked vs didn’t without control groups (i.e., one group distanced didn’t make one masked didn’t distance. 

Covid also 2-5 times contagious flu. something effective might eliminate flu slow covid. 

There reasons doubt masks effective pre-symptotic spread flu. First, it’s possible spread flu without symptoms, it’s less likely pre-symptotic covid spread. 

Second, flu mostly transmits surface contact. Masks don’t help that. year half, we’re vaccinated getting mixed messages, needs line sand specific catastrophe. think bit silly well harm? They'll get sick less spread less often?  initially Pfizer shots available first phase shots less Moderna. low Pfizer shipments delayed (and left mainly given minors) received shipments Moderna. people decide take second shot Moderna, wait Pfizer shots. This! COVID Im vaxxed. stopped wearing mask 2 weeks 2nd shot wear one again!   Union Covid nurse. Thankfully back pulm nurse now. USA absolute shitshow next several years. hospital decimated staff, COVID travelers whole sucked (if traveled worked hard thank you. didn’t work. Could’ve agency, knows, I’m dissin ya experience), morale time low. Nurses 30+ years experience taking pension cuts get early can. Newer nurses year leave icu outpatient NP school. seems like patients view hospital stay hotel stay. cannot even tell stories vile human behavior they’re borderline traumatic. 

I’ve assaulted 2021 (god forbid try place oxygen hypoxic COVID!). new grads next couple years going need way time learn skills missed COVID (not fault), they’re going taught “been stretched thin many years nurses leftover everyone logical enough leaves.

I’m actually staying can’t help want watch unfold, nursing do, it’s am. clock barely recall place.  bodies must piling Texas Florida! ER work boat minus forced work critical staffing days. I’ve nurse year don’t know much longer deal low staffing especially gets night shift evenings. Extremely dangerous ratios, taking hallway patients nowhere else put them. doesn’t help census almost doubled pre-Covid vaccines coming people more. either need expand ER hire staff neither things done currently There's universal flu vaccine tested developed.

I think researcher leading Moderna COVID-19 vaccine also behind first universal flu vaccine candidate. felt hung AZ Pfizer day after, felt fine day two. immune system old worn out, though...  sitting vaccines since government structure severely outdated still heavily reliant local governments paper system. antivaxxers dont know science works expect every answer day one never going happen. everything supposed to. wore mask, stayed home, didn’t see friends loved ones, got vaccinated. I’m it. part half rest country went around like big deal. Im fucking sick it, I’m going wear mask, I’m going stay inside summer, I’m going give time friends family. part.  spike India lasted couple months cases suddenly collapsed early May. country 1.4 billion hardly achieved herd immunity fast? possible think likely. brain regions really specialized processing taste/smell (like piriform cortex) really show atrophy. regions atrophied lot ones handle complex cognitive functions like memory reward processing.

This interesting, thank you. Especially considering [the symptoms reported ongoing ONS “long COVID” (covering 1 million UK respondents self-reported symptoms lasting 4 weeks infection).

Some common symptoms (ballparking percentages graph, since download link broken) include:

* “Difficulty concentrating” (~28% respondents symptom weeks infection, ~25% weeks)
* “Memory loss confusion” (~23% weeks, ~19% weeks)
* “Low mood / enjoying anything” (~22% weeks, ~18% weeks)

If areas brain responsible memory, reward processing complex functions atrophying could explain symptoms. Good luck 12 unable take vaccine! went Broad Street Oyster Co couple weeks ago (everyone go, amazing). wait line outside basically walk window order, I'm vaccinated, bring mask. Everyone put mask ordering felt like dick! one first times going business since early 2020, realize everyone would still wearing masks, felt like turd. lucky person got *all* side effects *both* doses. Woot! 🥴 chances dying reinfection still going quite low person young healthy . 🤷🏿‍♂️ Agreed, idk wtf redditors think, it’s like think it’s kind game mask covid become eradicated like Plague Inc, won’t, covid isn’t going away us vaccinated, well it’s time get back lives. I’m masking anymore chance may come contact immunocomped person, knows risks come contact sick ppl covid. send less shareholders. didn’t. LA County recommended indoor masks, it’s mandate. 

That’s one county one state extremely overly cautious even it’s mandate. 

CA state still following CDC guidance masks still spreads summer, much less so. southern hemisphere flipped seasons....  conclusion two data points obviously must Mississippians know nothing politics? need potentially diseased trash inside responsible among us. Eggs certain fried foods smell like gasoline taste way gasoline smells like pumping gas. Certain fruits taste rancid everyone else says tastes fine. sense smell works days days all. hypothetical calculation 96% number protection hospitalization comes (and 88% protection symptomatic disease comes from):

Say huge group unvaccinated people (let's say we're looking million people), 10,000 symptomatic cases covid 500 hospitalizations.

88% protection symptomatic infections means matched population million vaccinated people expect see 10,000 times 0.12 equals 1200 symptomatic cases covid.

96% protection hospitalization means expect see 500 times 0.04 = 20 hospitalizations.

In hypothetical, 5% symptomatic unvaccinated people went hospital, 1.67% symptomatic vaccinated people went hospital. many fewer cases among vaccinated people, 96% reduction total number hospitalizations. sure that?

The flu may primarily large droplet spread, evidence ALSO spread via airborne small/tiny droplet/particle/raw virus... 

Just like SARS-CoV-2, solving larger droplets solve problem. Still good news people work feces cleaning services I'm trouble finding numbers saw day. Reuters report study says [96% effective preventing delta varrient. Exactly. Guess you’re spreading to, aren’t vaccinated. evolves point, won’t even able infect humans begin with, mRNA vaccines target whole spike protein, manages mutate entire protein won’t even able infect humans effectively. nuanced, people without immunity COVID risk. they're unvaccinated, previously infected.

There's reason believe previously infected, unvaccinated, greater risk fully vaccinated cities seem sensible, part, live rural Texas time mask-wearing tipped 50% January cases deaths control. I’m lone masker wherever go. I’m looking forward inevitable Delta wave we’ll get next months. Considering original headline **“Russia's Sputnik V shot around 90% effective Delta variant, developers say”** feeling might right. 60 percent Look bright side, business going booming doctors treating long covid conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome neurological issues.

I mind much # cases especially 60% adults vaccined. capacity hospitals normal capacity?

You think suspicious authorities mention new variant numbers vaccinated rise? Possibly avoid talking breakthrough cases?  things LA highly vaccinated compared rest US, still level needed herd immunity, especially transmissible Delta is. bad take.

If vaccinated, (a) effectively taken potential load healthcare system (b) protected everyone around you--the vaccine cuts transmission ~80%. 

Yes, wearing mask could cut ability transmit unvaccinated people even further. However, obvious/basic math see problem vaccinated people. people refusing vaccine. Vaccinations way this. Focus efforts convincing people get shot, prescribing vaccinated people live (mostly) protect refusing protect themselves.  personally feel like Delta variant exponential growth amongst unvaccinated populations US, think we're going seeing bars resturaunts cracking vaccination status places might end completley barring unvaccinated people entry. extremely low chance catch it. would catch it?

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm (somewhat) immunocompromised. answer is... complicated. dug latest research review latest research 2 months ago. time, studies fairly small, biggest ones really made claims much lower seroconversion rates single vaccine dose (and may limited organ transplants, remember). appears significant difference depending kind treatment getting. really understand what's going on, want look IgG IgA levels determining seroconversion data itself. Since specifically focused vaccine efficacy IBD patients immunocompromised, much focused specifically IBD/Remicade.

&amp;#x200B;

1) scroll way end, see figure 1 samples relative positive sample thresholds IgG IBD patients HCW controls.  look closely, number samples first vaccine dose appear cross positive test threshold, subjects received 2 doses did.

2) important/positive result Anti-Sars-CoV2-IgG.  Even though patients CID lower BAU/ml level vs control group 1A, higher cut-off researchers said non-responders.

3) many 2 dose samples vs 1 dose samples (I'm hoping giving overall size study following data).  samples show significant improvement 2 dose though geometric mean switching 15 u/ml seroconversion threshold 1 dose it.

These fairly small studies, general trend seems folks taking remicade (and perhaps biologics) autoimmune diseases show lower antibody response likely much lower seroconversion rates single vaccine dose, especially mRNA vaccines still show relatively high seroconversion rates 2 properly spaced doses, even rates still general population. may necessarily true people significant immune system blockers organ transplants though, possible new research since articles published. Look graph link provided. timeline several months. delta variant showed UK late March. hit 50% cases early May. almost July. Deaths continued downward trend. everyone obsessed obsessed. variant story old one. majority UK vaccinated, give long-hauler story. stick making baby lotions Let’s real. mask mandate lifted adults aren’t adults blah blah “civil liberties”. No. Efficacy shown 88%. Please correct this. still catch pass people get vaccine, people mask up. (I live rural MO)   Source 60% considered herd still restrictions then?

Let’s keep flying world Sounds like one likes living corona times, bud.  argue you, checking numbers 70% highly unlikely end July - talking full vaccinations. made rough estimates looks like heading 50-60% total population fully vaccinated end July.

It seems rather unclear talking first doses full vaccinated, though. talking first doses seems possible. Currently around 50% total population received least one dose. propose do? Keep restrictions forever?

All ever hear people ""But variants!"" without feasible plan get back normal. mean, kind agree you... I've also Saint Cloud know possible. populations Omaha Lincoln make 40% state. Wouldn’t India also qualify sibling since Britain also colonized them? disgusting anyone wear mask risk unvaccinated People different ancestral variants?

Based seeing last weeks, truth likely order maintain R0 low enough end pandemic, people might need get vaccinated wear masks. even possible gatherings might still need limits, etc, critical mass vaccinated. Thank driving (very good) point father home, lol.   substantial evidence high quality shows delta worse children. is, please provide it. actual, peer reviewed data. not, said misinformation.  olympics great start! studies show this. show contrary.

It causes hesitancy, short gagging media making compulsory know change - medical body assessing risk recommend AZ majority population, due risk covid low here.

Turns out, occasional 3-5 day lockdown preferred.

Hell, federal crime wear planes people STILL assaulting flight attendants it, spreading mucous everywhere get restrained.

How virtuous vaccinated people still want wear masks ""do part"", literally makes difference grand scheme things. Parents masking kids twelve limiting interaction public immunocompromised same.

And since none articles actually giving details mask recommendations coming out, I'll continue believe vaccination effective recs protect anti-mask/vax crowd, willfully cast protection reap sewn. prediction correct though. 80% adults received one jab 60% adults recieving two jabs. numbers came former health secretary Matt Hancock btw.

I’ll never understand this… work small kitchen employees, vaccinated including me. know one sniveling republican 16 year old isn't, wear mask potentially unvaccinated customers? stopped wearing one week ago vaccinated since early April, Delta variant scaring me. still wear one public even though much. I've eaten couple restaurants, went couple museums, I'm willing go Target etc. return seeing stranger smile hold door open

Can return? Holding open doors people wastes everyone's time. Ah, two different samples: 24-person unvaxxed sample 6-person vaxxed sample. unvaxxed one might trust, 6-person vaxxed one tells us much.

I could sit math wanted to. Even sample size one tells us something (not much). Nope. wearing one. Vaccinated Oh, I'm talking deep north. Redding. Though persisted stops along way, also.

I'm somewhere less half COVID case rate LA county whole has, there's smaller variation well. Government bad mentality strikes again. apocalyptic 4th wave incoming love sub gotten bonkers one gets downvoted simply reporting happening locally around them. totally disagree.

The CDC guidance safe, trying manipulate people. *is* safe vaccinated people everything unmasked. right CDC say this.

If going mandate vaccines, wrong force vaccinated people modify behavior protect unvaccinated. got bad GPs going JCVI. Mine mates' GPs fine, obviously advised us risks keep eye for, that, hassle all. Firewall   depends basically size crowd.

I wear walking empty coffee shop pick mobile order. I'll wear packed Costco there's thousand people shoulder shoulder. mean, specify comment still wear required, agree.

But also agree nice wear time.

It's possible recognize facts without much one end debate other. hardly knew you? could hear hum ""open up"" 5 people protests. Delta variant apparently impacts children much original variant does.

Citation please? I've seen thing. Masks, distancing self-isolation “stop-gap” measures extent Americans lacked social solidarity around issue required measures effective effective contact tracing enforced, example. Vaccines *never* effective pandemic response Covid-19. new development. Seeing almost behavioral change indoor mask mandate ended vaccinated people L.A. county, think much behavioral change either. happened Ireland. Previously AZ J&amp;J restricted 50s, since unfortunately risk vaccination outweighed risk Covid younger cohorts. Delta balance changed, safer option. I'm anti-mask, understand work used. past year, scenarios people could masked indoors, (restaurants) lower capacity limits. 

Now, people crowding places masks cannot used (due eating drinking). seems make mask mandates pretty ineffective - small number infections avoided wearing masks grocery store would overwhelmed infections crowded bar, instance. 

I'd love hear others perspectives, really see mentioned - either masks ever again, wear mask everywhere foreseeable future. kids, data really clear COVID poses little risk them.  ZERO, close wear mask whenever they're indoors - best do. need vaccinated folks wearing masks pretend protect kids. Purchased, donated lent. 2.5 million doses mentioned lent donated US (AZ lent repaid later get AZ supply, Pfizer donated). persons idiot, ignore them. People would rather make stuff sell fear. Delta, hospitalizations increasing proportion cases. There’s evidence far Delta dangerous variants date. Actually really. 51.36 state 67% county. Maybe don’t assume Would rather see dog like once, four times? experience parent, seeing look betrayal kid's face get needle they're young understand worst part. I'd like protect son many diseases possible smallest number injections necessary. feel 100 percent. got vaccinated March 27th still wear mask protect others face lol time multiple states begin reopening.Next month, rumoured colleges/schools also going reopened, going loop it? artisanal way

Craft, small batch antibodies produced local growers... cool. That's I've reading well.

There's caveat household, though, 3.

Children 12 cannot vaxxed yet. Delta variant like, extra mega contagious (I read R0 6, crazy), we'd prefer mask. I'd also heard checked proper sources something like 25% covid positive tests nowadays children. said, verified one yet, grain salt. 

So mask indoor public spaces, us (we try limit well, gosh loves grocery store). 

*An aside: there's adults cannot vaxxed, unfortunately produce little immune response. know several, continue mask well. Responsibly wear mask? that? I’m curious people forgot portion population that’s even eligible vaccine. I’m vaccinated continue mask up, 3, 12 years age, children. think real numbers, nice fancy bridge would like sell you. literally data support recommendation. yet another case officials spouting recommendations based feelings instead data. cities around 60-65%. rural areas are, IIRC, 30-40% range (probably hot spots cool spots). true (not confirmed) huge Denmark. currently dont use AZ J&amp;J, also estimates calulated based curavax.

Good luck.

You're artificially limiting common sense covers based opinion, globally majority people affected areas following additional precautions, making quantitatively common sense. vaccinated get infected, still loose smell taste, right? “Minnesota Nice” losing “N”? Yea don’t worry 🥲 state's vaccination rate high enough may rough time then. I'm telling though, sharing thoughts.

I'm looking people wear masks, sharing positive things come wearing masks. said, still wear one certain situations.

If feel seeing lower half face street invasion privacy, going lot problems deal related covid. - feels like jumping shadows. don’t think good strategy.

I remember people saying March 2020... sick, sure, normalizing staying hell home contagious virus. Wearing mask flu every single year kind ridiculous, especially get flu shot ever year. mention last times (before regularly got shot) middle summer. Thanks sharing in-depth response, hope don’t effects second dose! Variant isn’t strong enough affect 99.9% people vaccinated. Please stop spreading misinformation  Okay, can't isolate behavior affect ones care about.  scientist believe larger concern volume unvaccinated people remains high. variants continue evolve, possibly point vaccines ineffective.

From seen US strong uptake early seems stagnated around 50-55% population vaccinated. offshoot whole herd immunity concept folks. No, reason I’m afraid vaccine make turn purple explode. There’s zero reason, none, believe that. Grow get boosters if/when they’re needed. 

Do believe getting flu shot five years ago “doing part” prevent getting flu now? aged 80 fully vaccinated essentially takes risk unvaccinated person around 50.

Interesting way explain risks age.  vaccinated still get Delta variant, It’s way less likely hospital/life threatening event. Wearing masks prevents people may spreading it. even vaccinated folks wearing masks makes sense, protecting others themselves. parents doses already got covid gave brother Johnson Johnson already..wake up.. Ya ok bud, proven who? companies selling them? need trial data that's independently verified otherwise like listening Marlboro tell everything's fine cigarettes cause cancer good effective. completely agree. I'm seeing anything stating 94% symptomatic cases only.  it’s likely someone China eats another bat  literally almost posted exact sentiment morning. Even Gottlieb recently proclaimed goal zero cases realistic “surge” winter likely 20% previous winter surge. 11k cases per day (down -4.4% last week) hospitalization death continue drop due vaccination. Yet people can’t move away lamenting. And? I'm one made comparison though scale remotely similar. Take guy. aren’t high risk severe illness due covid.

We know long term effects terms possible lung damage, heart, 75% new cases Santa Clara county people received vaccines. dont say many hospitalized though. Delta variant seem give much fuck. Time tell much protection get it. evidence covid worse children number communicable diseases going around? seems less risky chickenpox children Sorry, different said? Sorry hear that. would absolutely campaign rights others wear masks means don’t wear one vaccinated. Freaky. source share? TIA think never thought it, never came up. Sadly covid never going away. small percentage people fall group covid isn’t going get something else will. It’s truth public health scale. It’s sad It’s wiped out. flu go summer? chills animals. hops back. don’t think - think avoid people sick, don’t cough right people, healthier eating exercise, wash hands

I don’t think wear mask every flu season. Getting sick normal shows immune system working. Overrun hospitals tons deaths not. people healthier, imagine many flu cases could prevent alone? would be... plus side. outlier then. portal opened 30-34 I'm assuming called GP asked one. Reinstating mask mandate political decision, science one. Levy politician, scientist. Yes encourage terrorists terrorist attacks capitol. Correct Ok death rate lower flu. risk population vaccinated delta rest population point move say risk acceptable. 

Moreover delta circulating uk since may showing 28 day follow up. One would look vaccination rates time readout (mid June) less month. doubt uk vaccinated time. would good see data. risk negligible 12 year old. Like flu. I'm tired masking up. year half we've vaccine available entire public months now. people want get vaccinated exclusively problem, mine. There’s million reasons put two weeks current job, huge one nearly one team vaccinated, they’ve gone maskless anyway. We’ve two major COVID scares workspace past two months, one landed positive test (it turned false positive, weird situation) put quarantine week. 

It’s infuriating little people care others. Unvaccinated, maskless, bar hopping, exposing everyone work, fucks couldn’t care less. happy leave hopefully work considerate people next job.

Even I’m protected there’s little chance get sick, would prefer people cough covid don’t care. wish US's supply! reading it’s deadlier? Everything I’ve seen far seems say they’re sure yet Unfortunelty covid never going away risk kids negligible. flu. sub coronavirus... else would be? never get attitude. many people instead looking something desiring actually learn go ""I understand x, therefore x bullshit."" fine. Living like hermit benefits 😀. 36 per Million total deaths due Covid 19 since start pandemic... failure, especially compared US (1839 per million), (UK 1922 per Million) even (Canada 699 per Million)? definitely kicked ass, know take couple days recover still wear mask inside, that's feel weird rather scientific reason. I'll grow it. I'm sure we've heard reports recommending mask use even vaccinated people combat Delta variant. I'm trying see qualifiers amongst completely vaccinated people. 


If public, mask-wearing makes sense. 
If group at-risk non-vaccinated individuals, mask-wearing makes sense. 
But group everyone confirmed vaccinated? start wearing masks again, safe less chance spreading variant people?

9-11 minutes

After 18 years nurse, much emergency department, Jeremy Lail considered battle-tested veteran.

But last week, asked bosses Providence Portland Medical Center could go leave. Lail said he’s overwhelmed horde patients seeking treatment ER unnerved erratic, angry nature many patients.

“I dreaded going work,” said. “I found thinking, day someone going pull gun shoot me? We’re seeing society devolve right now. I’ve dealing lot anxiety depression.”

For months, hospital workers wanted nothing pandemic end life return semblance normalcy. much-deserved respite yet begin. Instead, combination understaffing tidal wave seriously ill patients deferred health care months made life ER bad worse height pandemic.

It’s recipe disaster unfolding hospitals across country: Blend emotionally exhausted caregivers emotionally disturbed patients, throw wave street violence departure experienced workers wards due fatigue burnout, voila, America latest health care crisis.

Many employees argue another key ingredient added hospitals makes end result particularly toxic: penny-pinching mentality allows understaffing develop first place.

Meanwhile, dangers health care workers confront changed. year ago, hospital front-line staffers faced deadly threat infection. Now, emergency department staffers worry assault patients come impaired, angry and, sometimes, armed.

OHSU Hospital’s ER installing metal detector next month patients visitors go entry. Twice recent months, staffers found patients visitors ER carrying weapons.

“I’ve eight years I’ve never seen many acutely ill patients coming door,” said Dr. Mary Tanski, interim chair OHSU Emergency Department. “When see sicker patients, that’s stress. Nurses already tired. They’ve front lines year. It’s point seen nursing colleagues leave profession.”

TRAFFIC JAM

When COVID-19 arrived Oregon, many hospitals experienced immediate drop business. first months pandemic, OHSU’s emergency department saw patient volume fall half.

Some hospitals figured could afford cut staff, save money lessen financial pounding taking result pandemic.

But ER traffic hard predict. law, don’t luxury turning people away.

Sure enough, ER demand surged spring level caught everyone surprise.

After studiously avoiding hospitals doctors’ offices year due COVID-19, many patients sick treated released. led another problem: hospitals don’t enough staffed beds elsewhere hospital house influx.

That leads “boarding,” practice holding patients ER, hospital bed destination found. practice controversial keeps patients limbo blocks normal flow sick patients hospital. Behavioral health patients particularly prone boarding chronic shortage beds dedicated needs.

The backlog boarded patients means delays new ER patients, wait hours see nurse. Understandably angry patients families times lash hospital staff.

Karlee Hoffart four-year veteran ER Kaiser Permanente Sunnyside Medical Center Clackamas. “I love emergency department,” said. “I’m bit adrenaline junky. like valued member small team.”

But things changed recent months.

“We cannot move patients,” said. “There days start shift, half beds taken folks needing hospital bed. Sometimes, wait 24 hours.”

In interim, Hoffart colleagues must treat them.

“We longer ER nurses,” said. “We mental health counselors, hospital nurses, asked all, extra help.”

NOWHERE ‘DIVERT’

But problem shortage skilled workers staffed hospital beds.

Emergency responders delivering patient loads much hospital emergency rooms handle. surge calls began several months ago worsened last two months.

Emergency calls always spike summer people roads. Multnomah County, number would typically increase 300 day. month, county running average 390 day.

When Portland-area hospital ERs jammed, go “divert” status, meaning ambulances would normally go diverted another hospital. It’s never unusual one two metro-area hospitals get overwhelmed busy night.

But recent months it’s become almost daily occurrence every hospital area go divert.

OHSU, example, spent 150 hours per month divert status April May 2020. year later, Tanski confirmed, OHSU’s emergency department full off-limits 450 500 hours per month.

As OHSU one region’s key trauma hospitals takes serious cases.

“When we’re divert presents challenge,” Tanski said. “It leads spiral effect.”

That sea change local county officials run sort air-traffic control system coordinating ambulances hospitals. May last year, local hospitals went total divert status maybe twice, said Shane Ryan, spokesman Metro West Ambulance, serves Washington County. May, hospitals diverted 54% time.

Ambulances made unusual trips response. Tualatin Valley Fire &amp; Rescue transport patient hospital Corvallis Portland-area hospitals turned away, said Cassandra Ulven, spokeswoman department.

The deluge shootings street violence contributed surge.

“Our trauma volume huge,” said Jon Jui, medical director Multnomah County Emergency Medical Services. “We’ve never seen people getting shot rate, often random. I’ve EMS three decades, I’ve never seen problems sustained, prolonged. significant strain emergency system.”

SLOW STAFF UP

Kaiser Providence nurses argue solution problem simple: Hospitals need hire staff, need retain talent have.

Hospital officials said trying exactly that.

“No one would dispute challenging time across state, region country comes caregiver staffing, going divert wait times emergency departments,” Providence spokesman Gary Walker said. “Providence actively managing needs, including spending hundreds hours recruiting additional caregivers. excited group 54 new nurses joining us ED residency couple weeks.”

Legacy Health Systems said hired 250 nurses 2021 soon accept 50 additional nurses residency program.

Providence, Kaiser Legacy declined provide information nurse attrition turnover.

Kaiser said hiring so-called “travelling nurses” employment agencies fill gaps payroll, it’s offering sign-on bonuses registered nurses work nights ER.

“The nursing shortage affecting whole nation impacting Northwest region well,” said Kaiser spokeswoman Debbie Karman. “We’re actively working recruit hire nursing staff.”

Hoffart, Kaiser nurse, suggested Kaiser concentrate retaining trained veterans. Attrition enormous. “She colleagues estimate half nurses worked Kaiser Sunnyside ER last year left department.”.

Hoffart steward nurse’s union, Oregon Federation Nurses Health Professionals, started negotiating new contract early month. Staffing central issue.

Kim Stewart, another ER nurse Kaiser Sunnyside, said there’s bigger priority.

“Kaiser great patient care model,” Stewart said. “But without people right, doesn’t work. don’t even want money benefits. want staff.”

Lail, Providence Portland nurse recently went leave, echoes sentiments. steward union, Oregon Nurses Association, recently filed grievance Providence staffing issues signed 75% nursing staff.

Lail doesn’t know future store. “I don’t want quit, don’t want leave. it’s getting really hard,” said. “The money really important me. want support right co-workers job.”

Citation needed. time dataset says 324 pediatric COVID-19 fatalities, one flu.

Bad comparison, I'm talking flu season nearly everyone hiding home wearing masks public.

[For 2018-2019 flu season 477 deaths age 2018-2019 flu season 21 324 covid deaths Jan 2020 June 2021, let's say 75 weeks conservative. ""under 18 demographic"", covid killed 324 people 75 weeks. 2018-2019 flu season, flu killed 477 21 weeks. 

I recall anyone saying needed lockdown wear masks save children ravaged disease 2018-2019 flu season. Still waiting data covid sooo much deadlier young people flu.  Wow, never knew wearing mask emotionally, physically difficult reading comments here. hell expect ppl make sacrifices tackle climate change? last two weeks pretty great second doses. July going make look like warmup. I’m trying dismissive. Maybe need protect person? don’t see can’t normal things. protecting person? I’m already vaccinated. It’s extremely unlikely get covid. Im fully prepared watch anti-vaxxers take dumb fuck. Im prepared hand deaths number persons. I’ll wear mask it’s good neighbor would do. Jim may dumb piece shit, don’t want reason dies. authority. Lots people thread seem believe people choose get vaccine expect vaccinated wear mask them. come idea? anyone actually come across non vaccinated person demanded wear mask sake? I'm pretty certain care do. sure, wanted point vaccine less efficient delta variant.  Considering nations supposed recieving equal share bad thing? lost out... Cool thanks link! fully supported mask mandates/wearing masks point vaccine became universally available we’ve effectively reached herd immunity. Now, fucking nonsense. literally could care less anti-vax moron dies Covid. It’s natural selection point. Bot must Mississippi.

Sincerely,    
Richard Nixon think ironic flippant answer gigantic question epidemiologists there.

Typically where? Give one county US cases QUADRUPLED last two weeks. Every county I've looked lately shows cases dropping basically nothing last month. 

Give one source actual scientist worried delta variant causing wave anything like last year. One source making click bait title twisted sound byte. 

Do think know better CDC? Unless virus mutates form particularly severe younger people, happened Spanish flu Texas you? DFW mask usage, reduced somewhat, still thing.  company responded entire pandemic “We’re open regular hours!” largest competitor started closing early? right way, ~20% (or 1 5 nurses) belong union. exactly enough demanding industry wide changes. you’re referring NEJM article linked below, done England Jan/Feb year delta variant factor. vaccinated reduce spread vaccinated spread study would likely higher delta variant. Natural Selection 🤷‍♂️ see. Thanks info! Can’t read article: Behind Pay-Wall. 

Hope good story though  agreed Got first dose, nothing second. covid 7 months ago, maybe why. fuck get J&amp;J vax. Son a! equating competing fighting self improvement? love god people get vaccinated; absolutely zero excuses, vaccine free widely available. Massachusetts high vaccination rates, single digit daily deaths, less 100 new daily infections 40 new infections (on 13,000 tests); life pretty much back normal people aren’t needlessly dying. expect state lowest education? Lol, anti-vaxxers going mask anyway. protect me, refuse protect themselves, obligation protect them. bad part workplace dropping mask mandate see co-workers hideous faces people overwhelmingly likely catching spreading covid - unvaccinated - masking.

The chips going fall fall. People want protected protected greatest degree possible (yes, someone's going ""what children"" me, risk children low levels things we've always dealt never taken society wide interventions against). Mass vaccination, concentrated among likely get ill, likely prevent hospital overflows. 15 months pandemic mode long enough. even allow unvaccinated houses, dangerous public health threat. difficult make someone understand thing salary depends understanding it. ofc still vaccines effective prevent deaths problem also +70% still good. Maybe variant bad south african variant know pfizer 75% it. opinion see Alpha Beta situation.Alpha can't escape vaccines dominated SA spread probably Delta-Lambda lambda transsible think would talk delta argument basically is: fuck children people eligible vaccine want stick antivaxers? give get sick asap? Nope! Fighting live necessary, means keeping mask rules place (no shirt shoes used controversial, culture adapted adapt masks, too), need mask rules forever won’t roll go fight left fight. 100% happening. shifting guidance allows anti Vaxxers say “see! don’t know they’re doing!!” Now, rational people realize expected happen we’re unpredictable unprecedented times. interest expediency, sale one nation may best option. doses nearing expiration date, likely are, becomes kind necessary. Shocked pikachu Meanwhile pandemic Utah. one wearing masks, I'm trying go relieved I'm vaccinated there's way entire costco full vaccinated people way.   Sorry coronavirus care agreed finish. Also, unlike lot control measures, wearing mask big deal. Deputy PM said choice either restrict indoor dining even longer. preferable decision all, businesses need something. still requiring masks workplace eventually switch optional. afaik one person planning go mask free. fewer / less intense colds winter hopefully Anyone wants vaccine able get one weeks months. reason vaccinated worry health willingly refusing get vaccinated especially since often also people anti mask. ...that's virtually god sent 3 ways rescue someone flood declined three. they'll still question died. Yes, I'm aware example. trying rip whole comment apart based one thing, so, no, ""being pedantic,"" saying X come back like it. Yes hospitalizations MAY rise (the may much question, expectation), much? Certainly rate past waves since every study (and real world data) show vaccines offer robust protection severe disease. That’s whole point vaccines, past wave occurred high number public fully vaccinated. Pretty much northern Michigan well. saw 1-2 employees still wearing them.

Our governor dropped restrictions week ago. mask signs entrance doors, either. It’s like normal times again! get sick?  would fine everyone chance get vaccinated, alternative (free) testing available. saying ""fuck young people, ride back bus"" something I'd accept sacrificing year social life old people.

As vaxxed person I’m concerned health, worried things finally look forward - travel July August, concerts September October, seeing entire family next Christmas - get rekt outbreaks among unvaccinated bad enough country shuts again. 

I’ve mostly reading headlines skimming articles though. fears unfounded gonna get real bad US? worked customer service person didn’t get raised 5 years quitting “made tips”.

I'm fully vaccinated wearing mask stores. realize viral vector vaccines dna gets transcribed ... mrna body, point it’s damn thing. mrna vaccines lipid layer shortcut end result. also benefit body immunity initial vector avoid potential transcription errors. vector transcription it’s damn thing mrna vaccine.

It’s like arguing whether it’s better wrap sandwich parchment paper tin foil. Either way it’s sandwich inside. Jesus H. Christ Batman! gnarly! glad he’s ok. Yep, [it Expect see new wave [less vaccinated fueled Delta - notice states currently experiencing uptick new cases below-average vaccination rates. Let's hope hospital systems affected time around.  Severity POSITIVELY correlated transmission. fact, seen multiple variants. 

The changes make easily infect cells increase viral loads also increase severity. Again, we've seen happen already.

I get - sub basically wants pretend go away soon. pushback someone says automat8cally become less dangerous part that. literally we've seeing, based idea necessarily apply multiple reasons. Indian here, vaccine take 2nd shot 3 months too. us, seems gap decided taking look studies UK showed 8-12 week gap give better protection virus, also there's shortage vaccines. want vaccinate many people possible first dose, 3 months give pretty good buffer so, simultaneously ramp vaccine supply. Well duh CDC gave power. Americans still masking number situations. tough JnJr.....very little info efficacy newer variants. I've seen try compare single dose AZ seem comparable. Hoping release numbers soon! upvoting this?

It completely made census data. fact, 84.5% Mississippians age 25 high school diploma equivalent. 

That's still great number, facts matter truth matters. Stop making things stop believing everything read. break vaccinated among ill commenting know ? think Australia chose strategy chose worked them. Vaccine hesitancy risk strategy -- people feel rush, basically sold idea exposure virus avoided -- they'll likely get lot fewer deaths lot days semi-normalcy most.

But people think country could Zero COVID virtuous Australia (if met them, congratulations) look understand almost one tried it: even Australia's geographic advantages, ability seal borders tight, etc., takes increase transmissibility things longer enough. apply countries, see... pretty much saw: lock realize they're never getting zero, open back again. sense, countries Zero COVID countries; never got past first step. key takeaway AZ vaccine offers kind protection versus shot all, could better. Another takeaway directly compare Pfizer vaccine find much effective Delta compared AZ. Yes, we've seen examples virus mutated transmissible deadly, point seems saying severity *no impact* fitness here. That's I'm saying accurate.

Put another way, two variants identical severity, variant that's less severe almost certainly outcompete severe variant time. still applies here, even though force strong would viruses without pre/asymptomatic spread. time, still trend less lethal/more transmissible, even evolutionary force weaker slower here. *You died dysentery.*   first dose share *total* population. Germany first big wave second doses complete, first doses picking again. 70% total population around 20th July easily since current first doses 18+ 50-60%

As today Germany 53.6% first dose *total* population, 18+. Flu vaccines typically less year old created every year based projected strains present flue season. However, process make vaccines well established. 

The covid vaccine development long time several trials covid-19 arrived. like flu vaccines, lot established science behind it, necessarily strain created for. it’s going slowly, disease currently killing .00003% Australia ill last 16 months, initial post point infuriated mandated lockdown stands.  read, recovering covid-19 even half battle. practically damaging running Chernobyl naked viciously attack body, blood vessels brain itself.

Catching like playing Russian Roulette. Sometimes, get sick recover lasting effects. Sometimes, lose sense taste. Sometimes, wrecks like fifty car pileup involved two full fuel tankers truck loaded illegal fireworks. New York Slimes  I'm NC USA. Yeah think fully thought also written one word, throw hat /r/iamverysmart ring. spot indoor environment info? interesting. Brazil setting interval doses Pfizer 3 months.
Is maximum time those? Someone said interval 21 42 days, information accurate? someone (other me) mentioned adults getting vaccinated slow spread? might missed - thought argument things / protect children (aka don’t think shouldn’t anything all)

Also anyone (other you) said car example supposed example accepting risk nothing? might missed too

Unless point quotes 2 things I’ll stop since (unless missed comments) sounds like making things discussing self think I’m going give weeks month … there’s still updates I’ll get it. prove you’re fully vaccinated? I’m wales written slip jab info surely anyone could forge.  figured would hard get good sized sample, since breakthroughs rare begin with. don’t think 28 day lingering symptoms OP concerned about, “Long Hauler” syndromes. Which, don’t bad acute symptoms, intuitively, wouldn’t think you’d get worse months years, I’m open shown otherwise study done, course. Dr of? original post said vaccines provide robust/strong response (depending amount intact mRNA vary depending old product is, temperature storage etc). 

My main point ultra-specificity response - it’s single protein unlike traditional vaccines include many foreign antigens.

It seems like it’s easier job sars-cov-2 get around ultra-specific immunity versus immunity natural traditional vaccines. seems like specific selection pressure vaccine evolve bypass. think it’s already happening.

It needs mutate protein potentially bypass mRNA vaccine immune response, isn’t case traditional vaccine natural immunity. mean everyday 800ish admitted? KNOW THAT! There's stat many 2.92 billion first second doses. Since dont know whether fully half vaxed. Even ENTIRE population ONE shot, world would better place 10 fold lol! 

Since article say, im going hypothetical course. shits giggles  thinks spent much time playing phone pandemic game.

r/iamverysmart

Seriously though, let's civil. Argentina also agreements buy manufacture vaccine people fucking listen aren’t. Unfortunately there’s lot selfish entitled fucks there. Okay, experience followed strict decontamination procedures know anyone got sick. sway one way regarding lab leak theory. Total non-story. forgot certain golf course dweller statement wouldn’t end trouble it’s worth, I’d let boss HR know problem Clear hired do. Wow, pharma company's stock rising? Shocking! ""It like flu."" -ignorant person describing Covid-19 Norwas opened everyone 18 areas (mostly Oslo). 
The vaccination schedule actually moved weeks back, counting 90% got offered vaccine accepting, real numbers got much higher (some age groups even 97%). adults getting vaccinated slow spread car example example accepting risk nothing mitigate risk. Yes I've fully vaccinated since April. father tested positive well (also fully vaccinated) loss smell taste. guess different person. swear read exact opposite yesterday subreddit.

Natural immunity protects specific variant had, whereas vaccines protect fairly equally spike protein discussion adults getting vaccinated help children, qnd car example stupid lots things regarding cars mitigate injury. 

You keepntrying cha ge subject want rant lickd9wns. Stop it. make appointment drugstore last month get 1st shot got 2nd shot, also appointment place, last Friday plus give health insurance card. then, get vaccine despite valid medical condition supply limited &amp; appointments hard come - That's NY, imagine Missouri heathcare system sucks worse NY &amp; CA. drink bleach lick doorknobs they're dumb legendary rare real fact right mean mean ""you people?"" Well would hope fucking ""vaccine"" cry harder

Go read fucking book, regurgitating shit see online embarrassing discussion adults getting vaccinated, helps children. 

What FUCK issue that? commend forgiveness, people deserve benefit doubt. live tiny town 800 people. largest town county double that. want drive half hour Walmart (which nearly everyone already, small towns grocery stores), county health clinic offering walk-in jabs month now. could arsed make appointment, could gotten jab starting April. that's general public. husband got work early April. one two people dept 50 take advantage offer.

I really hoping quasi normal summer kiddo, happening. hoping they'll little kids approved time school.  downside living 3rd world country one offers vaccine Well there's somewhere full quarantine uninfected kids zero restrictions. overwhelming amount evidence Covid dangerous disease young children, policy pretty liberal toward allowing normal childhood activities. discussion public policies protecting kids covid. I’m saying I’m favor policies others even favor policies may mentioned ignore everything else mean (very small) risk children testing conducted random, big push people undertake lateral flow testing twice week every week pick cases either asymptomatic symptoms could mistaken cold hay-fever.

So theory crazy may think anyone heard one way another double vaxxed people less likely get anosmia?

Or anecdotally anyone vaxxed, get covid, lose smell? Lying science now, lol ok buddy. kinds stuff preventable except excuses unnecessarily alarmist article clickbait title even misrepresents data sites (vaccine efficacy England 79% includes AZ Pfizer, efficacy Pfizer notably higher AZ, figure relevant New York given AZ used). concludes everyone saying; get vaccinated alright, ton useless alarmism. dont remember reading studies JnJ. Honestly, deficiency vaccine pretty sure would heard now. stick basics suppose - stay masked indoor areas poor ventilation avoid crowded area much can. Thank much That’s thing either don’t understand pretending don’t - I’m saying “hey risk shouldn’t inconvenience anybody”. I’m saying “hey risk thing’s I’m willing mitigate things I’m - even would help greatly inconveniences people” 🙄

You guys complain anything jfc perfect killing machine. Moderna Squad rise up! Holy crap - I'm getting trolled now, right?

Me: talking lockdowns. discussion lockdowns nobody mentioned lockdowns

You: rants lockdowns.  Highered Clear deal guess Clear (the app/company it) overwhelmed won’t respond emails calls person answered earlier said couldn’t anything Yes even needed evidence available sometimes still make decision based whatever evidence have.

Then later get more, better evidence modify decision. Alternating safety glasses shield. Fitted goggles would probably better depending variant does, I'm ruling out. safety glasses least awkward. we've demonstrated public. average human educated rational enough actually understand wtf going on, fear panic ensues. realized replied nearly identical comment answer someone else. Since I’m mobile I’m gonna copy paste sounds like people also misinterpreting thinking defending lockdown/mandated quarantine. Sounds like way said things implied that. I’m sorry that’s meant. one ever said shouldn’t protect children - limit much willing mitigate already small risk. Sounds like agree shouldn’t lockdowns even though would protect kids catching covid that’s whole point trying make - point accept risk employer can’t assist you? Wtf?!? would absolutely plan getting vaccinated already going person. Good luck!  That's great hear! point still infect others. otherwise israel outbreak virus going restrictions right now?  much burden wear mask practice social distancing much possible? even bring doesn’t apply virus time?! spread misinformation. Also island helps lot. grandma good sense. Fauci caught many occasions intentionally misleading public serve ends. That’s science, it’s sleazy politics Ok new information comes changes again? preexisting conditions, unfortunately located south. I've two doses Moderna vaccine previously sure holds delta variant. 

Honestly, top voted response really patronizing think helps anyone. Thanks giving level headed response. Exactly! Ty comment. I’m tired people able apply *this* virus, long period contagiousness symptoms appear, even appear. Becoming deadlier isn’t going cause virus die unless somehow kills person transmitted…and far, that’s works. pointed apply. 
Instead backing down, doubled misinformation. Using ""can"" mean keep misleading people regarding specific virus. Sorry, no. vaccine everywhere 70% Missouri lives urban areas easy access local CVS, Walmart, Walgreens.

Vermont 39% urban vaccinated state country. Sorry polite enough someone spreading disinformation doubling instead backing pointed them. people don’t understand science. people think country could Zero COVID virtuous Australia... look understand almost one tried it...

But neglects absolutely crucial point: countries virtuous Australia - even like ten times cases (eg. advantages Australia had), **the virus would practically eradicated WORLDWIDE** now, would ""Delta variant"". 4 million people would still alive. I’m guessing reasoning get Johnson &amp; Johnson, you’ll considered “fully vaccinated” 14 days first (and only) dose whereas Pfizer you’re considered fully vaccinated 14 days second dose (so 35 days first dose).

But actually look trial data, Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine didn’t really achieve “full” protection 55 days vaccination (and even then, efficacy lower Pfizer). hand, Pfizer’s trial actually showed full efficacy 7 days second dose, 28 days first dose. (It also looked really good starting around 10 days first dose).

So actually go trial data, Pfizer 28 days J&amp;J ~55 days.

On top that, J&amp;J appears taken hit terms efficacy Delta variant whereas Pfizer holding well.

So mind, would 100% recommend getting Pfizer. I’ve even seen doctors lately mentions that, face Delta, perhaps people vaccinated J&amp;J get boosted single dose Pfizer Moderna. Oh wow. surprise. could seen coming. It’s almost lifting restrictions we’re 100% done bad idea so? harming anyone would people want injected vaccine still study phase? Legit question here, antivax bs.  difference dutch vaccination levels much higher... country atm 50-150 cases daily even u vaccinated u wear respirator inside public transport even make sense beta dying out? mean lol Technically less 5% get covid it’s 5% could get covid theoretically exposed Chicago like, 95% compliant mask mandate still effect. night day difference Chicago downstate IN. life... finds way... Exactly, would prefer stay side caution enough. I’m vaccinated, still really appreciate people stay masked protect others. Doesn’t hurt way whatsoever Corsicana... It’s former really. Come flu season, people mask up. don’t think talking policy, kist general act wearing masks 3 wouldve convinced confed mask.... Yeah I’m North Idaho, it’s way whole time. Even places masking mandated entry, it’s time pass door man. Hi Louisiana. feel you. degree happens matters. probably worse Delta variant before.  Aaand course Spokane maybe 10% wearing masks couple weeks ago past weekend like 2%. I'm one week 2nd shot likely continue wearing mask 2 weeks up. really think maintaining numbers required fully reopening. Unfortunately people probably missed reference choice three vaccinations. flip coin two, what? Texas; 5 100 wearing masks Walmart Food thought: many season's normal flu deaths survive Covid infection last year?

You can't die flu already die causes flu get you.

We probably need new acronym: YODO - die once. Or, Denmarks case, slowed us similar speed Germany. 

Besides going available extra orders possible mRNA seems Denmark particulary effective getting doses vials. 114% BionTech 105% Moderna.

It's bit plus excess caution. Delta truly exhibits higher breakthrough rates people get infected (but necessarily sick) chance virus adapt new immunological landscape, virus (our immune system) environment variants might appear increasingly smaller susceptibility vaccine induced immunity. 

How likely scenario? think anybody knows, might driving fear experts turn consequences policy making. might long hear stories like this:

Science always changing learning, that’s point

Antivaxxers use anything “ammo” it’s made propaganda Man scream “YOU INFRINGING PERSONAL FREEDOMS” walk away. Honestly fuck people.  No. getting vaccinated *is* also selfish do? got vaccinated entirely best interest self preservation; protecting people never factor decision making. care “greater community” greater community care me.

I got vaccinated loved ones. It’s great I’m also protecting others that’s purely side effect. Eh, sometimes wear it, sometimes don't. Depends employees / fellow patrons place. Yeah; went Home Depot day; employees masks. figured - them, I'll put mine too. 

Went bakery right cashier mask, store sign front saying mask (?), put anyway. 

Went another store, mask sign, mask clerk, put on. choice, would get mRNA vaccine, continue mask practice safety measures. doesn’t really matter good immune system is, infected still spread, maybe get sick severely ill, could still potentially face long term post covid shit. fully vaccinated person, it’s death afraid of, it’s long term covid related chronic problems could lower quality life scare me.

This big one me; I'm keeping mask wherever workers are. Gotta show solidarity, they've enough worry whether I'm spreading germs vicinity. Speak yourself. wore one problem putting one again. stopped wearing mask based reading started wearing one again. Safeway yesterday first time 16 months saw people without masks. 80-90% people wearing them, definitely going see fewer fewer. Really bothers see parents small kids nobody wearing mask. 

Really keeping fingers crossed stay clear allowing kids 6+ get approved vaccination vaccinated. stay home learning 2 elementary school kids another year, I’m going lose mind. Yeah, live border LA/Ventura county I'd say still 80/20 masks wherever go indoors. people I've talked said ""want give little time"" see variants/cases play out.

However, demonstrably least severe strain seen date.""

If anything data shows delta causes greater numbers hospitalisations Alpha, comparing unvaccinated patient outcomes unvaccinated patient outcomes, vaccinated patient outcomes vaccinated patient outcomes. data set pointed mixes vaccinated unvaccinated patient outcomes, proper way show severity variant. free market works works well. problem going get worse birth rate declines people work home.

I know couple want kids husband works remote wife makes 10,000 month traveling nurse. live RV driving US. stereotypical reddit couple.

Nurses going back median wages way health system going pay 10,000 month every nurse know able pass costs insurers prevent people dying streets going start outsourcing.

The problem approach like companies outsourced pure dog shit work see congress pass something absolve health systems liability. Look infusion centers such. nurse friend switched hospital looooved think, really way worked? children aren’t able get vaccinated? okay protecting them?  Agree it’s money. hospital thing, average nurse makes 48/hr bonus shifts high 70/hr top normal rate plus time half OT it’s insane. Still hard get people sign up.

Even purely selfish level probably since know young low risk death COVID, long term organ damage real well characterized. endothelial disease, there's lot ways fuck people without killing them.

Gonna need see citations one. feel it’s protect people can’t get vaccine aren’t allowed yet, like me. Please wear mask  we're allowed force people vaccinate deport idiots it.

Edit: I'm talking adults here, kids obviously. We'd get herd immunity without kids getting vaccinated anyways. Yes :( It’s north hill, guess people would consider main part city, LA county, huge, it’s central. map shows vaccination status area LA. Let see find you. guess Burbank pretty high percentage people vaccinated.

Edit: it’s 70% vaccinated [is nice map](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/vaccine/vaccine-dashboard.htm) showing it’s location vaccinated %. Scientists found natural immunities covid. never really asked anything here, come already decided discussion forum right questions? objective data showing kids getting sicker delta?  hear this? area reinstated mask mandate. lot people probably disagree based anecdotal evidence, still worth shot talk people. go? Similar Maine. cashier throw shade wearing mask day. told I'm Canadian go back home little town lots elderly neighbors... brushed off. hospital nice across board $10/hr temporary pay raise, worked extra shift, get another $10 per hour plus time half. base pay $35. could make close $78 per hour night shift dofferential $930 single 12 hour shift

Lately shift goes $58 hour dealing fool particular variety use approach. 

let talk bit ask time is. 
let talk several minutes ask time now.
continue conversation longer ask time is.

then confused look ask answers lying told time was?

i asked time gave three different answers.

why lying? I'd say things. excess deaths found report differs quite bit others, can't extrapolated numbers largely associated first wave waves Canada (just like USA) tested higher percentage cases caught.

The Economist excess death project Canada 16k early January, 1k difference Covid death count.  

There almost certainly missed deaths though wrongly get attributed something else, basically every country. know Wawa ran hospitals sub going fucking hate pregnant second child H1N1 pandemic, family doctor obstetrician told them, “Basically, would crazy get [H1N1] vaccine,” according DesRosiers. discussions made feel “almost personal level like there’s something wrong even question it.” Feeling couldn’t discuss doctors, DesRosiers turned Google came across anti-vaccine info “seemed science-based.” on, DesRosiers stopped vaccinating children.

[So literally I've found talking antivaxers feel would nice numbers scientific consensus regarding safety covid vaccines; not, would nice pointed right direction find good enough number papers support safety vaccines 
 
Thanks point, people get scared enough go back non-pharmaceutical interventions (masks, distancing). basically waves beaten vaccination. Note government mandates things: unless state willing weld shut doors people's houses, still need get people voluntarily go along masks/distancing, fear virus, particularly traumatic wave, goes long way that.

Note NPIs still take weeks work, lag time cases manifest. really awful comment feel bad always, better not, also much better. 


Due vaccination really, really effective, masking top give little - playing around 1-2% chance getting contagious most, even hamster ball full-scale NBC protection inside change much.     remove masks reach herd immunity. much longer people get vaccinated, people see unvaccinated friends get Delta fare. Yeah fact, got AZ vaccine, followed Pfizer actually outperforms taking Pfizer based studies we're seeing. response high take Pfizer first. words, AZ later get Pfizer booster probably best protection what's available moment.

I got 2 doses Pfizer since that's available time choice, me, would opt AZ least first dose, especially knowing know now.   Yes, masks cost pennies. 

It's hard weigh low certain costs (i.e.: mild inconvenience still wearing mask) highly unlikely disastrous consequences (i.e. getting someone seriously ill even though double vaxxed). spend day arguing it, seems I'd rather wear mask insist I'm right take one thousand chance (or whatever) getting kid immunocompromised adult sick. I'm still trying figure get Delta variant vaccinated. vaccinated, risk contracting coronavirus much lower. vaccinated contract coronavirus, risk serious complication much much lower, risk spreading significant viral load someone else also much lower. mom too, felt like hell half week. didn’t feel much anything I’m relatively young, might why. need worry friend

People dying game chance you?

I really engaging type comment am. Measles perfect example see understanding concept herd immunity. immunocompromised, elderly, young otherwise vulnerable people go around measles exists? measles circulating certain number people vaccinated it. People asking people wear masks indefinitely, enough people vaccinated infected reach herd immunity. also drastically cut number mutations. Better results vaccine-lazy vaccine-disorganized. Mississippi no. 1 again. Lol Yeah person talking ass. mRNA vaccines work inserted protein ""looks"" like current COVID-19 variants (but harmless) mRNA trick immune systems mobilizing things ""look"" like protein, ie current variants COVID-19. reason believe can't mutate anoth variant ""looks"" different enough protein render vaccines ineffective (or mutates able infect humans). person's argument basically nonsensical. kind misinfo circulating blows mind. disagree. rarely see anything above, maaaybe, 5% wearing anymore across multiple places: gym, restaurants, grocery stores, post office, etc. Frankly, 5% generous. grocery stores seem last hold far higher mask wearing fading away fast. place see masks worn going medical appointment. paywalls New York Times articles. Go read actual articles instead someone regurgitating information you. wife worked large children’s hospital lost $200MM early part pandemic alone. take job across country hospitals froze hiring. It’s rough time indeed. dont feel cuts though. dont want exclude unvaccinated people society, I'm open minded certainly harsh penalties choice honest dont think getting drink outside pub quite there. sure agree recent travel experience unionized nursing staff. course I’m sorry lot depends facility well. particular instance, nurses much power didn’t really function nurses. refusal much nursing entails mind blowing. again, think institutional culture part problem. sure came first. Protection via death still great protection tbf. systems profit know. Fuck tһat, finally got stop wearing mine work... takebacks Ofcourse, literally wait lifetime confirm. infamous sure. Also misinterprets data widely reviled experts. Take literally anything says grain salt. bad. sucks us flexibility lives. Half single childless coworkers dropped everything took FEMA contracts $10k per week made tons money.

Certainly seen lot people die last year normally Though. takes toll.

I wish got something it. Maybe staffing requirement keep us unsafe staffing. Maybe $10 /hr pay raise. Maybe loan forgiveness medical workers woo Tri Lambs! They’re effective perfect. Since they’re perfect, high levels full vaccination community needed slow spread. everyone mosh pit fully vaccinated? so, let’s goooo. not… hm, less appealing Well must recent advisory said vaccinated people fine discard masks indoors.  Take deleted comment? you’re kid go back lockdown, it’s morons choosing get vaccinated, vaccinated people aren’t wearing mask.

And nothing, work grocery store remember early days pandemic public told “stay home, don’t go hang essential places left open”. know everybody did? came counter bought lottery tickets state wouldn’t let us close. public never gave damn us, entire departments caught Covid right vaccines customers cared service slower crowded store *with mask*. difference actually give damn hope kid doesn’t catch Covid, that’s got vaccinated, also know good it’s going get, it’s seasonal virus winter likely worse numbers June. yeah, waiting “a months” makes total sense, perfect sense wait winter spike *then* drop mask. Guidance continually changing medicine nearly everything. exact science. anti vax apologist don’t take kid indoor places unless go

Don't wanna rude think kids mental health, know old he's 11 y/o means entire life without behaving like kid, something actually risk him. unlikely reach critical levels like again, think want cautious. Second wave India due delta. states imposed lockdown began drop. states dropping restrictions. guess there’ll third wave vaccination sufficient. Wage compression salary inversion finally making front pages. Good. analysis also showed modest reduction neutralizing titers Delta (2.1-fold), Gamma (P.1, 3.2-fold), Kappa (3.3-3.4-fold), Eta (4.2-fold) variants relative ancestral strain.

What 2.1-fold, etc mean practical terms? incorrect. virus absolutely mutate beyond vaccines protect against. idea getting info correct all. Everything probably fine you’re vaccinated, including Eyes Wide Shut situations.

I think masks A) hedge, B) it’s easier suggest/mandate masks everybody don’t know people vaccinated everyday settings. don’t really care one way wearing mask - I’ve strong feelings many things pandemic - I’ll continue hedge wearing mask indoors public situations numbers go bit more. point major concern variant developing evades vaccine defense, masks might help due lower transmission rate. though, hedge based ideas stuff might work.

Disclaimer - epidemiologist probably idea I’m talking about, like everyone else here. Half-Life 3 confirmed. Uhhhhhh…. Don’t get pen logo it? know, one pens ordered bulk 2004? Oh little plastic cup match? pharm swag viagra? Include goodies I’ll definitely mind staying late, working weekends, covering low staffing coming meetings middle sleep schedule day off. least everyone needs vaccine access. time 1) kids danger 2) cannot possibly achieve herd immunity levels prevent community spread. Fauci says 70-80% needed herd immunity, that's ""of adults adolescents vaccinated."" population even anyi-vax folks never vaccinate still can't really get numbers everyone access vaccine. 

Peds vaccines available September. long wait. Masks big deal. weird rest they're able subject able get better information. Strange works. laughing matter made chuckle lol Damn, thats like 4x rate UK UK cases exploding right now. Vaccines work. labor market works, pleb. shortage, remaining need pick slack.

* Employees self attest vaccine status go maskless 
 
* Everybody wears mask regardless vaccination status brand type know hard. There’s comradarie nurses EMS it’s like that. hesitancy handing sick patient someone sure off. Plus guys running many sick calls seems like traumas going okay. Stay well.

&amp;#x200B;

 109 117 Delta variant deaths UK [among older Although demographic breakdowns deaths, see vaccination rate 50 UK 80 90%. Additionally, 60% vaccines UK Astrazeneca, seems offer 92% reduction, instead 96%. half cases coming unvaccinated people make 10 20% elderly population (as low 6% 80+), prevalence slightly less effective vaccine, numbers seem contradict anything. chance hell I'd pay NYT think replied wrong reply. one sympathetic, starting ""I feel you.""

The one jerky. No, vaccine uptake something like 95% eligible people far binary response questions, provides context. 92k infections, 20k individuals partially vaccinated 7k found fully vaccinated individuals. [CNBC mandate happening vaccinated people mask-less, unvaccinated people follow?

It's hard say. California's Covid policies regularly gone absurd since pandemic began, tough say what's scientifically driven vs not. Get job. Same, still wear mine courteous minimize remaining chance spreading anything. wonder many people *actually* vaccinated despite wearing mask. Hah! 'majority' cute...

Also, clearly care offended attitude. hit bit close home anti-vaxx label? Wow I'm glad hear this, I'm sat jabbed 1 Astra Zeneca 2nd jab sight... rural area option. hospital workers wear masks they're clean rooms? I'm genuinely sure. tiny amount. mask &lt; vaccine &lt; vaccine + mask, mask &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; vaccine &lt; vaccine + mask. Wearing mask day burden me, especially social situations prevents communication joy, small benefit fully vaccinated, think worth it. 

Most though, I'm sick talking this. Covid going away. always amount risk. things worry life Covid.

I part, got vaccinated, reduced risk getting Covid spreading others massive amount. I'd like move on. Access facilities different question vaccine prioritization. talking vaccine prioritization. tends change people's minds fast thoroughly learn they've lied swindled. means finding people originate promote ideas. live retirement community vaccination numbers high? That’s great.

Or country vaccinating 0-12 year olds vaccinating 12-17 year olds blindingly fast? unaware any. city 0% 0-12 year olds, 10% partially vaccinated 12-17 year olds since approved last month. skills days worked inpatient psych COVID patients- time management, conflict resolution, customer service, project management, flexibility, willingness learn, team player, keeping calm crisis. Agree. I'm California work sent Massachusetts weeks. Barely saw anyone mask here. embarrassingly asked cashier first coffee shop visited ""situation"" was. 
Meanwhile, desk receptionist hotel firmly insisted need wear one... care. threat assessment. Started vaccinating April officially available. could**n't** care less people think now. one give social pressure begin with. Warm generous, drinks weekend everyone shivering cold sun went talking steps we've previously normalized mitigate risk disease. accounts population-level risk young children contracting flu pre-COVID higher risk COVID young children now. suggesting things like — sneeze elbow, vampire cough, wash hands touching doorknobs, etc. — sure absolutely agree, terms universal masking distancing even low rates community spread really see logic for. national ones. 

All flights! I'm never wearing mask  Well lot us vaccinated yeah also true people racist, sexist, etc. assuming reason way ignorance, they're hateful.

Yes, people hateful they're lost cause. Oh well, move on. Hope die, hatred dies them.

But simply given proper perspective there's hope. one thing definitely work calling dumb getting mad them. that, interpret irrational, sensitive, aggressive, anything intelligent.

You need get bottom think way think, work way pointing missing logic areas mis understanding in. 

If friendly them, they're continue retreat back echo chamber. treat respect, chance changing mind.

This goes ways political, economical, social views. Based lived much life-changing technology development - VCRs, CDs, DVDs, laptops, internet, high speed internet, smart phones, etc, witnessed rise inclusion many out-groups (who unfortunately still fighting today).

We also raised boomers parents working often tended let us thing. Many us raised TV, often latchkey kids who's parents way keep direct tabs us like today's connected world.

Our parents generally completely touch technology well wild west internet zero oversight supervision. easier wear mask point vaccinated, lot stores shit never dropped mask requirement store policy, even vaccinated. understand would be. good, one missed. paywall It’s definitely hit miss. came back LA one night life spots wearing masks. I’m talking 0 people, staff included. malls stores 50/50. Dangerous game.  sure intentionally subconsciously, there's big difference going back July 2020 lockdowns putting mask indoors. There's lot people think putting mask big deal. mean want go back lockdowns. means I'm willing simple thing causes slight discomfort. 40 year old 10X risk death COVID infection 20 year old. agree bartenders higher risk exposure risk literally 10X higher example. Given rate transmission within households, unlikely bartender's risk 10X at-home worker unless entire family completely isolate engage normal activities.

In terms reduction death risk, age-stratified vaccination soundest policy. saves lives. understand degree ""jump"" - e.g., co-morbidity, jump add 5 age terms sit line, front line worker, add another 5 - 20 year old bar tender gets time 30 year old works home health issues. really many defensible scenarios 25 year old getting vaccinated 45 year old supply constrained environment. I'm sure responded seemed like I'm trying make contest? I'm not, promise. science says vaccines effective Delta variant? [hospitalizations UK children Hmm ok fair point. still based reporting different news outlets still seems spreading mostly due unvaccinated people since vaccines still pretty effective. fact minorities vaccine hesitant. saying mostly anti-vax groups, troublesome past minorities government? dumb lol greater chance come contact COVID. increases risk 1 20 vaccinated still end getting infected.

I always understood efficacy numbers (with covid vaccines specifically) mean (essentially) 1 20 people immune response vaccination that's adequate prevent mild greater illness. like every time exposed infected individual throwing 20-sided die get sick roll 1, fact average healthy person's chances contracting covid (including variants) vaccination [are much efficacy numbers would seem imply. anyone else weird brand vaccine got? Like team sport? Like ""Whoo! Moderna's approved India! Go team!""  spent day second Moderna shot pure agony. I'm prone migraines, immune system response trigger sometimes (real fun I'm actually sick). second dose set migraine would. not. quit. Nothing drove away tears one point. little worn next day, otherwise fine. 

Small price pay though. nice see friends family again. Going bar working office (seriously) fun too. Source?  top this, fully vaccinated population UK pretty high risk **if** catch disease.

It's 40+ medical conditions fully vaccinated.

Prior vaccination, look deaths respective populations something like 90 40+ every 1 40s.

Now 1 1. Incredible! know joking, case, here's PDF explaining [wearing gloves everywhere often  administered 14 days intervals, rather 28, like Pfizer Moderna, full vaccination takes long. something primarily affects one group mean *exclusively* concern, mean areas concern predominant. First part simply true - 66% received 1 dose, 47% partially vaccinated, 20% fully vaccinated. 

Second part ignores actual data. What's people ignoring data fit little narrow view? maybe cared health

Actually, getting vaccinated far away best way protect others well yourself. better job following science. least reasonable problem. why? come? know, least problem seems solvable ;-) work delta variant, incorrect. could get shot worry it. course spreading places vaccination rates low. One piece evidence shows vaccines work. they’re one higher ranked US airlines customer satisfaction… needs serious discussion vaccine stimulus. What’s minimum amount that, offered everyone has, willing get vaccine, quickly get us 70 percent nationwide. offered qualify 70 percent county vaccinated? I’d say least get Mississippi you’re there. fascinating construct, article describes part quite well. starts feeling uncertain it, doc (or whoever) says something gives impression question dumb people ask. 

So course think they're dumb, one does. occurs seek ""community"" somewhere agrees incorrect thing, feel dumb. 

It's completely self-reinforcing, response ""other side"" ""what stupid thing believe"" ""how actually teach you?"" ...I know think ""that person's idiot"" almost every time hear anti-vaccine stuff. makes angry, even, way someone cutting dangerously traffic -- ""stupid"" thing potentially dangerous *to me.* 

Lots visceral reactions. going difficult knot us untangle, must. need protect other. large problem anti-vaxxers. Vaccinated individuals poor transmitters little stem outbreaks areas low vaccine administration. problem science illiteracy people done duty issue.

That said could become everyone’s problem unvaccinated become incubator new strains render current vaccines ineffective solution get fuckin vaccinated. mask advice primarily protect unvaccinated portions population pointless attempt change anyone's minds. Even apparent success moment, go back poisoned wells misinformation moment turn back. Better wish mild covid way.  We’re never eliminating covid-19, it’s never happening.

We likely eliminate COVID-19, SARS-CoV2 virus itself. Yup. going back nonsense last year half Three billion doses administered. Injecting many vaccines would mean many people dead seriously sick unsafe. come back “there x years”. ask future lottery numbers, since know much.

Seriously though, wasting time. know thing wrestling pig mud? people listen quack Internet troll listening science.

Edit: senior relatives, go devices block/unfollow people sites feed crap. foolish consistency hobgoblin little minds. Yeah, real. Gen X wants left fuck alone run (usually quite successful) independent businesses. We’re scared change - us thank tech developed last 20 years. I’m Canada us (including myself) yet opportunity fully vaccinated. 

In regions Delta outcompeted strains, one shot enough mosh pit, tbh full vaccination rates many areas US currently would sufficient gleefully jump (and really miss live shows). I’m hopeful given current uptake region live music soon menu; can’t say regions. Yeah Target bad, even cart wipes easily available, someone wipe ask cart wipes theyre cleaning station. got 3rrld degree cart guy asked wearing mask target. vaccine 90% effective Delta variant. new cases, hospitalizations, deaths lowest point since March 2020 pandemic broke out. fully vaccinated likely die car accident way store dying catching COVID inside store. nurses traveling making honest. Buddy's wife contract Phoenix summer 12,000 month living expenses paid for. point, know works doesn’t. really upset somebody naturally selecting themselves? true also think dream NP’s corrupted. goal take seasoned nurse specific field supplement education could decision making capacity. diploma mills everyone gets degree, online sometimes, don’t clinical skills. 

The entire profession drug diploma mills unprepared new grads. Tell healthcare workers lol grew MN left early 30s. Minnesota nice bullshit. Passive aggressive judgemental right. nice face immediately talk shit moment earshot. 100% vaccination rate incoming. nurses. Lots HCPs going nope tf different career. way things going, would stay abuse less pay? 20 years, maybe we’ll see big problem. maybe ople die patient ratio normalize anyway. went Trader Joes today, one mask walking in. felt bad since workers masks also, put mine on. 

Same me! mind, though. non vaxxed people don’t cooperate is. virus spread long large susceptible pool people. faster everyone gets vaccine, quickly confer immunity immune compromised move lives. vaxxed people masking little.  Johnson Johnson Don’t know infectious fully vaxxed people I’d imagine Delta really hard detect easy dismiss since lot people mistake allergies. symptoms headache, runny nose, congestion, etc.

Which *not good* people like get runny noses fine dust. See response similar question above, tldr it’s fairly close irrelevant. people really petty bent shape mask? inconvenience (it never one begin with), year habit forming even register more. Oh yes, sounds like American medical system. Nothing like overpriced hospitals artificially trying keep labor cost hospital passes stupid sized bills patients. 2nd shot Moderna definitely left rough shape next day. said, people talking side effects basically like mild, short lived cold/flu. would put maybe 5/10 terms sick crappy feelings. generally lasts day two. Keep hanging ! Thank sharing story !! Employees wear masks, patrons can't.. confusing? know flu works right? wear mask. keep distance. wash hands. that's worked hundred years. figured spanish flu Yes, immunity derived natural infections likely less protective infection, particularly different strains. Denmark showed \~80% protection reinfection first second waves, occurred prior widespread distribution newer variants Denmark.

That's say people prior infection still enormous risk severe outcomes, greater risk symptomatic infection someone fully vaccinated (or prior infection + 1 dose vax). Somewhat relatedly, meme - Sweden counts differently. 
As PISA tests, many aspects. PHE sees 29 hospitalisations 1-dose AZ vs 100 unvax. Pfizer? 6. Nearly 5x better.

This sentence grossly misleading, therefore much part problem.

PHE calculate Pfizer 96% effective hospitalisation AstraZeneca 92% effective.

""But dosing gap""

Well, handful countries infinite supplies Pfizer, that's important thing. vast majority countries infinite supply vaccine, choice ""twelve week gap"" vs. ""three week gap"", ""vaccine two months"" vs. ""vaccine six months"".

Based rational policy roll-out based availability blood-clotting risk made.

In Australia's case far late though, they'll waiting end year probably achieve high levels vaccinations even there's surplus whatever brand choose. really hard put mask. it. Jesus  doubt full approval moves needle much. Maybe terms places like colleges military able require doubt much outside that. Anyone says ""Im waiting full approval"" move goal posts done. 


Obviously 12 crowd getting give little boost we'll wait see many parents willing let get it. Im little disappointed 12-17 numbers think % parents letting 12-17 year olds get would higher 0-11.

I dont know anything Novovax help boost people willing take it. Well protected dog big diseases, one shot one weekend time. like limp spaghetti afterwards. doesn’t way everyone get vaccinated gets vaccine running time population 5.8 million that's actually quite lot addiotional doses.  care immunocompromised people, people allergies vaccines can't take even wanted to, elderly vaccinated people still extremely vulnerable etc?

If continue part, risk hurting them. We’re gonna stuck endless mutation cycle anyway. either stay like forever go lives. long think you’re going for? judging, I’d circumstance all. [Staffing chances getting mild infection extremely low, chances even lower becoming sick enough end hospital. minuscule amount vaccinated people ended hospital. Something like 9,000 117 million study done couple months back. vaccines unbelievably effective.  can't give example another disease, then? Come back got something deadlier long term, couple months. wonder many people died making products use

Hope enjoy life  Maybe I’m reading article correctly. give efficacy rate? equivalent rate compare Pfizer? comments America. Resistance vaccination almost entirely due political beliefs getting vaccinated makes democrat/liberal. Ignoring foolish. difference EU countries [isn't even Bullshit. issue Argentina Pfizer vaccines law. selling one nation

Based [earlier Romania's Prime Minister, first country publicly acknowledged, there'll countries. Quote:

""Prime Minister Florin Citu said Monday Romania sells anti-COVID-19 vaccine several countries, Denmark receive one million doses.

He asked doses anti-COVID-19 vaccine expire.

We sell Denmark. sell countries. think million doses Denmark."" Yeah, might bit un-updated. majority regions opened 18+ far know, including two populous regions (Stockholm Västra Götaland). still far ""all citizens 18 years"". Oh sure. can't wrap head around people complaining masks work home. really care others wear go lake day couple one pedal powered boats middle lake masks on. Maybe judged little lol Judging votes, subreddit still thinks know doctors. subreddit actually super dangerous pretty mentally impaired. Glad left early. Unfortunately still keeps showing every  mean outside pandemic? mean, lot tech developed boomers - lived lot change - even bring change media politics - fall berlin wall/ussr, birth things like 24 hour news source, loss network television model, death cable model, rise streaming, change standalone television episodic, serial tv, straight binge-tv streaming, rise event-movies, rise on-demand everything opposed buy rent media (or wait appear TV radio). 

Lots generations lived this, prime demographic longest aged technology adopted majority came out. wonder many people going die hope enjoy free face Get man Cookie! Mf deserves it! 🍪🍪🍪 Oh thought sarcastic something lol reality medical situation isn’t political. 

Americans , like person commented made keep political . It’s place world right using different dosage, keep mind mRNA different: UTR optimized BioNTech's vaccine, poly(A) tail well: even though dose lower, *might* make body produce (or similar amount of) spike protein 100ug Moderna's mRNA!  I'll wear mask flu season that's prevent getting flu/cold. dumb idiots refusing get vaccinated *for free* contagious variant rips society go fucking die. care anymore. Ammunition for...what? wanna go get vaxxed go get vaxxed. not, don't. hurting people got vaxxed.  true Pfizer Moderna vaccines; you’re taking Astra vaccine. Pfizer vaccine 85-90% effective Delta variant first dose 90-95% effective second. True story: luxury waiting get vaccinations watch initial ones played getting mine basically work stay home time time first year Coronavirus. realize recently youngest daughter 22 waited get vaccinations me. told never something like again. needs best interest mom capable go world. I'm glad see lot teenagers younger people fighting back parents finding ways get vaccinations! People get credit digging heels defending falsehood changing one's opinion new information comes light. Irrelevant Ireland different country. Oh it’s China? Nope knew better. Nurses begged us stay fuck home? Yep I’m staying ass home. Vaccines rolls country opening back up? Awesome! I’ll stay put see goes. Fully vaccinated people don’t need masks! Yea let’s wait see goes. Oh mutated strain coming out? shit Sherlock. Also one poorest states least educated. Like comment, conflating Alpha Delta. Please see June 18 technical report PHE\_UK, page 44. Last 3 Tuesdays 7 day rolling avg (last week first):

442k, 420k, 463k


But 7 day rolling avg last 6 days stayed 300-350k, seem stabilizing. 


I think 12-17 year olds done school might help - dont need worry getting sick missing last days schools example. Although dont track age groups Im sure. fooled words ""non profit"". one biggest money makers industry. Especially churches, also hospitals. tax free money accrues individuals institutions, instead going Good point Good time buy hydrolyzers. hydrolyzer company extracts hydrogen oxygen solar/saltwater setup.. Yeah unvaccinated people children 12 worry about. Newborns protection mom got vaccinated. shit downvoted oblivion, but...

The U.S. already almost highest paying country world comes nurses' doctors' pay. Go Canada, UK, France, etc, make considerably less.

So low pay issue. conflating Alpha Delta. Please see June 18 [technical PHE\_UK, page 44. One thing find concerning Reddit, especially within comments subreddit, hating unvaccinated people.

Medical decisions always made individual, crowd social media, matter scared bored are. 

I know get downvoted, it’s **crazy seeing people wish death unvaccinated**. maybe it’s new normal... got shots btw, friends decided it. It’s decision finally getting raise. nurses getting 4%, salaried headcharge nurses get any, us advanced maintain RN3 get 2%. Hell yeah. Vegas March, phenomenal time. certainly bring CA politics me. I'd help preserve great state. Hmmm knew solution problem Go ahead get politics mandate changes see fit, continue follow rules. Yup, everyone else hospital gas ratios. Admin doesn’t even count holds part Ed census staffing. Yeah, I'm playing safe masking indoors. I'm taking chances things confirmed A-Okay. takes minimal effort wear mask inside places business. want risk nieces, nephews little God son. bit interesting...

Dr. Ellebedy’s team found 15 weeks first dose vaccine, germinal center still highly active 14 participants, number memory cells recognized coronavirus declined.

“The fact reactions continued almost four months vaccination — that’s very, good sign,” Dr. Ellebedy said. Germinal centers typically peak one two weeks immunization, wane.

“Usually four six weeks, there’s much left,” said Deepta Bhattacharya, immunologist University Arizona. germinal centers stimulated mRNA vaccines “still going, months it, lot decline people.”

Dr. Bhattacharya noted scientists know persistence germinal centers based animal research. new study first show happens people vaccination.

\*\*\*

Okay...that seems noteworthy. 1 2 weeks vs. almost 16?! mRNA vaccines create continual immune response? intended? Seems like could bad good points. Yes became NP rather MD made sense thought I’d time patients/care less complicated. Real world caring patients half pay half training. 

MBAs figured could use us make money instead using us designed. getting new clients keep going business. Millions doses ordered used.
Ironically even vaccinated get pass virus, even scientific reason behind discriminatory measures. friend mine got walloped second Moderna dose. Slight fever, fatigue, etc… lasted day. mother law. second Pfizer dose made arm sore feeling slightly run day of, nothing next day. So, 3 person clinical trial indicates Moderna shot produces side effects Pfizer (/s case anyone didn’t pick it) They’re different young people, collectively.  told followed rules. continue follow rules. want change public policy, go ahead try get politics make change. follow rules. Masks mandated, vaccinated, wear mask. Feel free live life please, I. You’re right, would crazy show identification order certain things! Good thing there’s need show papers driving car purchasing alcohol traveling starting new job. would ridiculous. totally allow anyone whatever fuck want times. Yeah. Guidelines. Please make sure are...FIRE anyone take vaccine. Find work another field work close people.  No, that's adults, fair. kids vaccinated. admit, I'm terribly worried family vaccinated. concerned immunocompromised folks. would make sense vaccination rates among young people weren’t low. looks like lot young people never really cared much first place. seem remember political candidates advocating certain kinds stimulus... went busy store yesterday saw literally single couple without mask probably 100+ people saw. NE section US, Maryland Maine, country, would one top nations getting population fully vaccinated. Case rates death rates also low section country too. important listen one stated reason something well beyond ability address. can't convince someone get vaccince view actually deadly refuse spite government mandate advisement. explained mRNA works even got ""Well want studies"", mind anti-regulation sorts bemoan government holds medicine back regulations. always something. could get rid money work matters automate get rid rest. Post scarcity possible try. thinking, lol. I'm confused big news. Weird. Fully vaccinated individuals extremely low threat spreading COVID-19 others, including children. 

Getting vaccine best thing anyone protect others, so, no, comment valid. Try again. Based I’ve read far, sneaking suspicion we’re eventually going learn J&amp;J isn’t nearly effective Moderna / Pfizer, effective initial data implied. folks J&amp;J vaccinations going eventually asked take mRNA vaccine boosters get par everyone else.

Still, J&amp;J and/or Astra much better nothing. single viral particle gets right receptor one individual cell body, gets inside, that's technically infection. Apparently German words better job distinguishing described ""an infection"" virus spreading body.

The vaccines can't prevent 100% former, incredible job preventing latter. Lol know vaccine hesitant people. actually pretty smart. However lot seem taking stance based politics rather best around them. Others fed bad information. newborn can’t wear mask. wearing one you’re protecting anti-vax people, you’re protecting people can’t vaccinated. Aren’t discriminating stupid easily manipulated media hellbent so? This! wife able create schedule ED many nurses left she’s one strongest nurses. hospital refuses hire new grads uses travelers it’s shit show. works 4 12 hr shifts 10 days off. Also nurses living southern Oregon could commute NorCal make twice much. Nurses aren’t paid well OR. love decide label “bad people” making “good people” act like bad people. tribalism us vs. display here. It’s “bad people” fault.

Welcome bad people group. don’t sources cuff provide, lot there. r/COVID19 good place factual, science based info sub.

A perfect decent analogy think though would something like this:

You need 20 gallons fill gas tank (neutralize virus).

The gas station holds 20,000 gallons (your neutralizing antibodies vaccine).

On given visit gas station might 19,000 gallons gas (about 1-fold reduction) 10,000 (2-fold reduction), don’t care long 20 there. cars might need 30, might need 50 100 it’s big truck, would take whole heck lot get low point can’t handle cars coming in. mean, based data we're even close another lockdown. let go right one ear other.  feel like bad taste way talk kids 12 know I'm exactly at, I've done everything right entire time. business requires mask, I'll wear it, I'm pissed thought wear everywhere go protect people selfish get vaccine. problem American healthcare system giant cancerous cists: Insurance companies private hospitals. People still defend institutions get yet. Emergency healthcare coverage area private sector help, wants find much money absorb service intended vulnerable moments lives. American taxpayer spends healthcare going profiteers employees. go again. Ya problem we've telling ""hang there"" long time since pandemic. blame nurses wanting even worse already shit conditions work in. really much tell. Oh let's schedule meeting talk email. Gimme break, work. Tired talking nicely explaining. want sick… fine. Stay away mine children immune covid. know reading nyt article constitutes research? think one thing important tell people that, get dirty research figure facts development, risk assessment, viruses vaccines interact, proper risk assessment come favor vaccine every time. 

For example, tell absolutely conduct risk analysis virus vs. vaccine, provide facts both. someone nervous defects vaccine, show statistically they're likely run something like covid (like, degree .002% vax vs. 25-30% long-covid risks). never get case someone care who, far tell, needlessly putting health life risk. Crank crank out! makes zero sense. CDCs data shows decline cases continued decline forecast Nope, not. 88% efficacy Delta variant. PHE report data includes Pfizer vaccine AZ vaccine efficacy data lumped together. Since AZ’s efficacy considerably lower Pfizers efficacy overall value high.

Please verify information attempting correct someone. also familiar recent PHE report June 25th. $12k month less. It’s equivalent $65 per hour assuming full time.   Nope, not. 88% efficacy Delta variant. PHE report data includes Pfizer vaccine AZ vaccine efficacy data lumped together. Since AZ’s efficacy considerably lower Pfizers efficacy overall value high.

Please verify information attempting correct someone.  even then. mom’s cousin still firmly anti-vaxx bullsh*t, even losing 2 family members COVID.   That's exactly did.  give damn anyone says I'm indoors stuffy full people masking up. I'm sick getting sick. people want show work social events sick others pay price. widely confirmed. that's one link there's lot dig in. secret really lol add two spaces end line want single-line break.

Then two line breaks double spacing. SF too. one like 3 people entire Costco masked nothing new, literally least million people believe Polio nearly bad made-up side effects Polio vaccine. Yep, Greeks forced get rid 4th letter alphabet. tragedy (or _tragey_ them). I'm moving clear across country go USC. senior year completely ruined COVID, can't take losing either. capacity. fair put everything hold people refuse help themselves.

Sorry. needed rant bit unvaccinated refuse wear masks unless everyone to.  fucking research stop entitled. yelled loudly aggressively, commonly referred ""screaming"" someone. aggrevating *more* valuable people getting paid *less* treated poorly. great way lose everyone end desperate end. real wisdom caring makes nurses employee kind valuable easy measure, therefor many workplaces completely overlook scratch heads things go wrong road. realize? ""We need pay enough retain best talent"" ever applies executives political office. I’m torn. I’m vaccinated always praise science behind it. Sometimes think wear mask, somehow indicating don’t trust science makes hypocrite. make sense you? kids aren’t old enough get vaccinated yet wear everywhere indoors outdoors crowded places. Think that’s prevailing sentiment Gov Newsome said state won’t re-enact anymore bans (assuming vaccines keep working various variants, guess, really think they’ll stay effective bit tweaking). 

Also surrounding counties (Orange, Riverside) effectively neutered public health officials. restrictions Los Angeles county send money *surrounding* businesses. Think LA county municipalities trying form *independent* public health offices like Pasadena has. get voted completely rational. People masked flu gets driven exponentially. People experiencing severe allergies. Anything respiratory gets contained rather spread around.

Random schmuck sneezing coughing place? Yeah miss all.

Masking political. health safety measure. Yeah, it’s funny, became law wear mask, people started wearing masks, became law need wear masks, still wear masks. LA people want different. Even gov democrat want something else I'm guessing weeks 4th July weekend we'll find serious states? That’s mask you’re seeing I've got vaccines get 4 bars signal everywhere standard vaccines become 101% zero side effects?

Absolutely batshit insane standard people placing medication that’s given 2B times. would argue it’s delivery think. dad’s big-time “they don’t know they’re talking about, flip flopped masks blah blah blah”. messaging get go accounted driven home fact “we don’t know, pretty well educated guesses. change gather information.” think lot fewer people would lost disinformation. 

Of course knowing average Joe, would probably hear “we don’t know” decide listen anything. matter much right now? 

So happen again. Come on. sound like anti-vaccine people know that. Half US apparently errant 2 year olds sometimes can't tell.  Kinda cringe Gee, could seen coming? way could known would happen. don’t get city “urge everyone” one thing, law says literally opposite? people wonder people want leave “LA”  last presumption correct. People hesitant get vaccine highly overlap resist mask wearing. there’s requirement prove vaccination people pretend vaccinated go maskless. 
Mandating masks easier mandating vaccine all, case everyone wear mask mask vax hesitant people likely wear one. Thanks! additional resources fold-reduction context? idea means.  trust government, take vaccine shots  anti vaccine. Never been. respect people’s space. don’t go around telling people lives, bodies, etc. try treat people (18 over) like adults, errant 2 years olds. appreciate people to… get kinda pissy others treat like errant 2 year old. Immunocompromised people risk contracting COVID vaccinated people. unvaccinated might pass them, people never going get vaccinated. what’s endgame here? mask forever protect small portion US population? It’s like immunocompromised stops getting vaccine. grandmother 70, HIV breast cancer survived COVID she’s well good today. It’s end world. COVID cases low nationally. Oxygen, next bitcoin. airport security wild there. I'm surprised mess incredibly well organised passed understand. still laughed though lmao. Availability mean people - everyone chance wants US, mean took Dude, u/WeirdAlYankADick, get it. trouble backfires ways:
 
1. another fully vaxxed acquires breakthrough infection. 
2. mutation arises vaccine resistant. 

Le sigh. good family friend ours, knew since time Philly, decided take wife move back Northeast. asked why, since comfortable job Oregon physician told forest fires sent back. man moved state promise said fuck moved back east.

Climate change real. states losing talent revenue nature. Send message governors. Know myocarditis though? spending 8 days ICU covid.  fact Romania can't even crack 25% first doses pretty pathetic. Serious education problem there.  efficacy rate, 2.1-fold neutralization reduction minimal amount. reference, reduction alpha 1.5 isn’t far off, know neutralizes alpha essentially rate “original” virus. reduction beta found anywhere 4 11 fold I’ve seen (this study found 7-8) know causes significant massive reduction efficacy (a Qatar study found Pfizer 75% efficacious moderna Pfizer similar use guide). say, reported 2.1 fold reduction good news. can, sorts roadblocks thrown way make difficult -- legal Masks dont protect covid, prevent spreading covid.  gotta wait see vaccine efficacy. I’m gonna stress yet given well they’ve worked previous variants. Unless virus eliminated entirely (unlikely anytime soon) will. People can’t get vaccinated, won’t get vaccinated, breakthrough cases. Yeah Ralph's yesterday literally 1 employee saw wearing mask, everyone else, customers included, wearing one. Well that's dystopian headline I've ever read one. Okay, go live life then. one joined thread talk followed rules. Hopefully get bump kids returning school/college. South fucked percentages. It’s like enjoy last desirable metric.  Puts Delta Airlines sure, also tell children can't get vaccinated yet risk variant previous ones...  saying republican politicians making 'bad people' saying part what's driving people violence. shit job market, evictions, massive natural disasters, local violence form mass-shootings, terroristic attacks, racially motivated killings, random attacks innocent people walking street looking 'asian', screaming retail workers enforcing company policy choice matter themselves, sometimes LITERALLY KILLING THEM, violent authoritarian crackdowns multiple states, outright lies governors elected officials severity disease killed half million people year, corruption, greed, unnacountable murders police, whole host things.

YOU got hung 'republican' part, bias. said environmental, societal, econmic issues causing it, people like posters wanna tell I'm partisan calling spade spade... Vaccines aren’t method developing COVID immunity. Millions LA County residents infected COVID, reckon vast majority people still level immunity since infections occurred last 9 months. millions unvaccinated people aren’t “free thinkers”, children.  TBH, say “Thank concern. take it”. get hint respect wishes matter drop subject. constantly getting case it. think going on… constant, people see harassment, causing people tune get vaccinated. Ya, vaccines scientific miracle many people refuse get them, crazy.... basically getting brainwashed crazy propaganda. Death damage covid do. He's acting like ""huge cost,"" wearing mask point. Also evidence Delta virulent (unless meant transmissable). Also evidence asymptomatic vaccinated people spreading public.

There exit strategy here. virus going evolve become less transmissable. demanding immune people wear masks, even admit based actual metrics, hypothetical outcome may may happen.

L.A. county's adult population *85%* seroprevalence. means population-level risk negligible. longer disease overwhelm hospitals cause mass death. endemic virus circulate low levels result severe outcomes rarely. high risk continue take precautions long deem necessary, one obligated accommodate fears.  Remember it’s death.

Young people usually don’t die, get lifelong ailments we’re still trying understand. soon Pricketts got rid people dropped em like flies idea people saying unvaccinated put masks on. doesn’t make sense tell everyone put back on. Delta variant supposedly 60% contagious past variants. vaccines still extremely effective based everything know right now

The CDC still says vaccinated people don’t wear mask

LA County strongly asking everyone put masks back call abundance caution. Don’t know rest country react people want mask mandates come back Sooo saying mask permanently immuno comped ppl? That’s dumb, I’m sorry, sucks them, know risks state health, I’m masking chance may come contact random immunocompromied person shouldn’t outside begin with… Closing schools, essentially international travel, large scale events, work home, etc, etc. lot factors contributing flu, really maintainable. Asian countries worn masks flu season long time still always noticeable flu seasons before. don’t think anti vaxxers many anymore, French people warming vaccine believe surveys. Summer holiday (july/aug) sacred France though! lot people want get vaccinated come back September.

I live Paris used struggle find slot, checked book one tomorrow want to.I feeling they’re gonna angry see it’s lot harder find slot september live new restrictions delta pro max + kicking asses. *sigh* I'm LA, stopped wearing mask, regretting - got sick. covid (I test), still lot feeling crappy, congested, etc. I'm wishing wearing mask, everyone else too. really nice getting sick whole year isolating home. Within couple weeks masks optional, bam, catch something. responsibly wear mask indoors.

WHO disagrees you. advise people vaccinated still wear mask. was… measles R0 10… I’m wearing mask anymore random joe shmo immuno compromised, I’m sorry sucks but, nope. immuno compromised really shouldn’t outside begin are, that’s risk choosing take. breakthrough case numbers shockingly low. [4,100 150 million vaccinated. vaccines appear work far better I'd hoped for. Interesting, period time post Covid essentially blind process information. i.e - could see something, know was. 

That went away weeks own. Depends. US, mRNA vaccines negligible dropoff effectiveness nothing worry about.  still catch spread covid vaccinated.  Looks like vaccinated person [in must super lucky. unvaccinated enough viral load hospitalized died vaccinated person department fine, symptoms. Guy buy lottery ticket, guess. different technology, mRNA platform. different targeting strategies, like including multiple spike shapes, perhaps even mutations might predict might happen.


Also, idea get spread control, mutating slowly enough might able get new mRNA target specific variant push doses hotspots, broader needed.

The best case mRNA platform becomes trusted spit new ""flavor"" quickly flu vaccine. thought two shots would good

You are, idiots fearmongering unfortunately. live South Carolina, confirm.  like living population Foghorn Leghorns. They're PROUD ignorance. think getting defensive point, 'one party worse' parties hate eachother, work together, discuss good faith, ect. I'm American, know there's one party kicked off, honestly started Obama, Dems usually tried. two kids flinging food eachother, interest anything making side look bad.  actual policies, polarization radicalization lot parties. There's middle ground now, 'my way id iot'.

Wow, bot super sensitive now. likelihood stay forever change reality people whose job try continue efforts feasible anymore. Yes, attest that. 

Also, attest cut friends would shut preaching others getting vaccinated (fully vaccinated, btw..just ""friends' "" business) Mostly, board harassing people getting COVID vaccine. enough stress life.  expand last bit edited? seems *is* 500 people catch it. is, efficacy measured getting 500 vaccinated infected people comparing 500 unvaccinated infected people. math looks like: (1 - 1 / 25) x 100 96% efficacy. 

And using personal risk youngish male 2.4% cohort hospitalized infection, risk becomes 0.135% small I’m trouble wrapping head around risk have.  don’t fear delta, wouldn’t go mosh pit anytime soon, unless numbers go further.  even profoundly efficient letting government control mind /s. 

My neighbor still spews garbage. Dude, arrogant bad enough right arrogant wrong embarrassing. Look effectiveness metrics calculated. compare group unvaccinated people group vaccinated people, found vaccinated people 96% less likely hospitalized unvaccinated people. **not thing**, even close, ""4% chance hospitalized."" weird; first shot, arm pain day really weird, non-painful neck lumps. second shot, got HUGE welt size fist around injection site I've queasy really able eat. said, things already improving; red welt already significantly less painful able eat plain noodles. Also first shot, barley felt second shot noticeably painful, though still bad. Thanks posting this... feel better finally scheduling vax appointment Friday. high level healthy anxiety, KNOW stupid afraid vax, still reason. still wear mask everywhere stay home much possible, young children protect, want everything protect well. iron crazy low (I'm breastfeeding 6 mo), 5 doses IV iron infusions. I've first two, third morning day get first vaccine... affect anything (interactions, effectiveness, etc.) right? I'm also blood thinner... There's many factors, even docs given differing opinions whether get vax not. I'm trying brave! high anti-Vax population Ireland? Ireland full bunch conspiracy theorists conservative (muh liberty) types like US?  That’s correct individuals high risk categories consider getting vaccinated.  sorry no, NEVER 20% infections led hospitalizations.  spewing misinformation cool. would lie something demonstrably untrue? 10 million Americans hospitalized covid. % efficacy need R0 go 3 1? (Without masks, social distancing, hand washing never expect anything anyone...) Minnesota going passive aggressive full aggressive aggressive, eh? again, change natural immunity wanes variants evade natural immunity more. worries though, im vaccinated variants shown bypass immunity. Natural immunity however, well, better hope delta isnt bad say regard. Reinfections often worse initial infections. chances dying second third fourth time. can't claim covid dying number cases different 'variant' increases.

Take look first chart tick ""stacked"" checkbox show variants stacked top rather separate lines.

You'll see Alpha variant, previously dominant variant declining since beginning March. Total cases also declining.

The Delta variant appears April starts increasing. small volume cases though, offset declining Alpha variant cases means total cases continue decline mid-May Delta variant becomes dominant total cases begin rise.  linked data sources? Figured Anecdotally, people know symptoms second shot. None know contracted Covid that. Surprisingly Nebraska (Omaha) best med centers world lot things. first Ebola patient US sent (that’s know it) amazing facilities. Even best science/medicine/care lead horse water, it’s horse survive heat. immunocompromised person risk since diagnosis, covid not. never change, people going wear masks forever, usual immunocompromised take care themselves.

I say someone autoimmune disease. Can't donate doses convert millions dollars stronger international relations nations? Wait till omega variant. almost like think people get angry it. Like know something wrong wearing one. Great bumper sticker. ""*COVID-19 Rapture!""* may wish refrain posting scary stats like ""25% covid positive tests nowadays children"" without sources cite back you.

I'm sure intent contributes misinformation problem social. utterly shameful slanderous misinformation remains post 190 people upvoted it. Shameful. Delete damn post shred self respect. Yeah wish state well Vermont. population county 1.5x larger Vermont's total.  Lol mod bot ended discussion. Feel free DM you’d like continue.  There's still outdoor seating summer. 2 dollars week? tipping delivery people? source that?  sub mixed opinions evidence. I’m vaccinated problem wearing mask. gathered wearing mask vaxed person mostly prevent non vaxed catching it? small chance getting passing on. Wouldn’t negligible didn’t along since people unlikely wear mask probably aren’t taking safety measures ways. 

Also, people saying still wear masks (btw still do) point seems you’re taking stance wearing masks standard. see evidence side people reject seriousness covid take seriously. essentially restrict save them, sake. thst uncommon thing given specific situation, little sympathy people takes chunk get sick… call asshole… I’m really concerned that, like I’m concerned someone’s hygiene Walmart carries potential illness spread. mean that’s life. people gross counter act way, also (before covid) don’t carry hand sanitizer pocket everywhere go (Prior covid would car), try clean hygienic person general. 

Idk anyone want chime make clear ? % deaths contraction actually enforced? asking true 100% vaccines, that's perfectly fair. take issue hyperbolic statements living basement forever kind nonsense. approaching discussion honestly that's way characterize people different position yourself. 

Me, choose keep eye things adjust needed. Right we're averaging 30 cases/day area. I'm vaccinated, 50% community is. go try use common sense: crowded indoors, mask. Crowded outdoors, mask. Dining, prefer patios masks. delta variant really sweeps proves big deal, maybe I'll relax further. think take pretty typical, far less worthy scorn idiots talking mask, vaccine, big deal. Yeah, Texas Found slave owner :) yeah stay room lol waiting for?
everyone wants vaccine able get one months now, going improve time leave behind way. I've kept addicts thoughts whole pandemic. hope really acknowledge celebrate hard work past year, emotionally trying. Congratulations  mean, pretty sure amount vaccination US enough prevent Delta - contagious baseline - spreading. leaves open question information. lot people sub, lot people obsess covid (and clearly I'm posting, pretty well obsess it) think outbreaks covid unacceptable require interventions. that's consensus among general population, even among us here. always viewed vaccination endpoint interventions, assumed since March last year covid new endemic disease never goes away. us vaccinated massively reduced risk, level us completely willing accept. choose protect themselves? I'm willing either endure impose restriction behalf - especially they're ones least likely abide restrictions likely spread it. go get vaccinated, I'm sure good buy interventions. delaying inevitable. People going exposed it, people going catch it. We're protected enough I'm pretty sure hospital overruns likely. So... I'm pretty much done it, living like 2019. intend continue so.  face vax campaign extra careful strike balance informing new development staying trustworthy continuous.

Maybe time/energy follow everything covid many older people, lack time desire watch...for seems confusing, random gives breeding ground desinformation.

Hell time track what's happening couple months ago health minister country kept changing information, resigned, 2 new people came place and..I felt like knew much me. Namely nothing. grew indifferent vary wildly within counties (though live one ten largest counties America, smaller counties may less variation). broken zip code, ranges 0.2% one dose 99.9%. around 50%-80% though, county total around 70% least one dose mean, you’re wrong. Even vaccinated person direct contact extended period time covid positive person, still unlikely develop symptoms. [A real world Israel shows Pfizer vaccine 94% effective symptomatic cases (not hospitalization). know picked movie back late 2019/early 2020, vote person never allowed pick movie ever again. 30.1% Mississippians 25 older High School diploma equivalent.

Passed COVID long road trip. Stopped McDonalds stretch grab bite eat  complicated, confusing process I've ever seen entire life. befuddlement, confusion, lengthy process prepare Big Mac large soda world....difficult people. yes, really asleep wrote reply lol. thank 痢

Dysentery? reached herd immunity. thing ""effective"" herd immunity. That's nonsense. Likely country reach herd immunity variants.

So masking still protects others whether anti-vax, unable vaccinate health, age whatever reason... issue? care less walked store mask on. US country huge issue politics rather humanity. What’s end game? We’ve 18 months, vaccines available (at least ones US) extremely effective preventing severe illness death. initial push socially distance/lockdown prevent medical infrastructure issues. vaccines available, vast majority hospitalizations preventable hospitalizations continue drop despite slight upticks case count. vaccines aren’t good enough, measures need continue long continues mutate, may wearing masks closing businesses indefinitely. 1918 flu still circulating (the common H1N1) continues mutate slightly flu season, yet don’t fear know death rate extremely low recognize NPI measures holistic based risk. personally care little vaccinated people test positive Covid virtually symptoms extremely mild illness. fall category really bother either. Great news since get 2nd Moderna dose Saturday Well, ideally, yes. However still analysis could done data have, (it much). Kawhi sitting box makes lot sense I'd like know metrics rate success. Superspreading. Even minimal time shared room passing hallway 5min later enough get it. contact trace contact? 

Story time: got using hallway neighbor April 2020 never contact whatsoever. time everyone including fought tooth nail aerosols thing. homes we’d never known picked up. predicted flying cars several years ago yet we're still driving roads.

The thing predictions is, they're always correct. spin evil government plot. good vaccine.
 low Australia caseload blood clots risk worth it. Vaccines broken link. I’m sure everyone panicking One frustrating things store work recording play every hour “our top priority safety well-being customers associates”. 

Yeah stopped requiring masks soon possibly could. care much ceased protection whatsoever quick could. First, deaths lagging indicator, often several weeks. UK's case spike recent.

Second, [death reason want avoid wonder regret spreading vaccine misinformation now... You’ve exemplified exact thinking question post. wore mask grocery store yesterday first time weeks, I’m really convinced it’s necessary. scroll graph sub-heading ""percentage vaccinated area deprivation"" see 80+ group vaccination rate 94-98%, 70-79 group 97-93%, I'm little trouble finding straightforward source info. long til double secret megatron variant 😱 Interesting.... never known origin phrase, guess one really either. False. spreading Literally place I’ve experienced wear one past month+ post office it’s federal building. Nowhere else. one place.  “Experts said evidence points vaccines like Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech providing high amounts protection variant, LA Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said clear future variant becomes prevalent.”

Why kind garbage this? Every bit evidence indicates high vaccines efficacy. CNN publishing stuff... hope n95. That's really thing protect you. time, anyway... Remember, guys initially told Aussie's masks work necessary. thing that’s going calm people getting vaccinated 75% adults… apparently people like living corona times aren’t it… UK approaching end 1st doses many groups regions, still supply limited. Honestly think whole zero covid strategy sustainable one vaccinated slowly. People don’t revolt yet never ending snap lockdowns? hope pray time hits us US, already high enough vaccination rate chance spread much. places still require everyone? still places required (schools, healthcare settings, public transit, smaller businesses smaller grocery stores, still require them, etc). make sure always one case.  hell? ignorant thing say.  40s UK.  Masks don’t protect person wearing them, that’s why. Wearing mask make others feel better?! 😂 crazy talk - TSA?

If everyone isn’t masked particular area, next NOTHING individual person. 

Check CDC site lot info masks work. Random question. I'm coming LA first time couple weeks training stuff, Burbank considered north? seems next North Hollywood. figured studio area it'd bit vaccine friendly. Yodo-lay-hee-hoo... don’t think anyone wants keep getting vaccinated every 6 months rest lives. someone immunocompromised myself, wanted say thank considerate kind. FWIW, everything surgery settles down, might want read vaccine efficacy immunocompromised patients. Depending surgery taking, vaccines may less effective (mRNA ones seem best though). able get vaccine seemingly reaction it, I'm better situation (taking biologic autoimmune diseases) lot folks going organ transplants whatever. think people wearing mask consistently need look past year ask often past year they’ve gotten sick. 

My haven’t sick since last March restrictions started. big part due part wearing masks sanitizing often. I’ll likely keep wearing masks go out, even don’t need to; especially I’m feeling good. don’t think they’re altogether bad certainly done good job keeping healthy past year. that’s takeaway that’s you. I’m sorry caused worry hope find something calm fears know guys, Australia sales corona went way 2020. think hilarious original point implying people selfish masking, even *if* vaccinated (like guy original reply was), plain dumb. Obviously I’m aware everyone without mask vaccinated we’re point people make risk assessments based close contacts. wanna wear mask perpetuity, scenarios don’t need to? Fine, go ahead. don’t chastise don’t need to. Meanwhile Tennessee, Opioid Barbie (Marsha Blackburn) still ranting covid get back normal. People stupid though listen podcasts walking dog mask lets smile whenever hosts funny without worrying look. I’m keeping it. You’re special aren’t you. Romania Bulgaria far lowest vaccination rates EU, yeah going spreading much last year lot people vaccinated. It'll mainly spread it, children even chances fine catching roof. There's nothing worry risk protected.  explained fucking stars falling stars family gathering laws several people thought bullshitting them.

OK, gotta ask. think were? you’re unvaccinated delta problem. you’re vaccinated it’s really not. “cases” Israel among mRNA vaccinated individuals news wet dreams symptomatic due mass testing people regardless symptoms. Oh it’s populous county country? huge deal… Coming soon shop home channel near work target Oklahoma people still wear masks. I'm Maryland, manage retail store 2 kids 12. I've vigilant wearing mask since April 2020. I'm well past 2nd dose Pfizer employer, federal government, state government local government tell I, fully vaccinated customers, safe longer wear mask.

But common belief comments also many people see day continue wear mask. 

At point 12 want vaccine walk right CVS/Walmart ect one. like months. I'm really growing tired making accomodations people could get vaccinated chosen too. 

Maryland 37 cases reported yesterday. Positivity rate .57% caseload less 1/100000. 74% residents least one shot. 

So seriously....what goal post, target metric fully vaccinated people feel comfortable safe without mask? never zero cases 100% vaccinated, point problem among unnvaccinated children seem affected serious illness. I'm truly conflicted.  Kids can’t get vaccinated, they’re getting sicker delta, wearing masks increase community spread. It’s probably better wear mask. Oh sure vaccines won’t ever 100% useless, virus still needs recognised ACE2 receptor, worst case antibody would need mimic ACE2 receptor get degree neutralisation. polls showing France hesitant country Western Europe. Luckily already better many early polls predicted, many people slowly coming around. bet don’t. Kids also getting sicker Delta injection kind prevent happening… think hitting herd immunity mean restrictions lifted. UK, predicted reached herd immunity several weeks ago yet we're still restrictions. brain cells isn’t confusing. Keep mask till COVID goes mostly away. It’s mask, it’s big deal I’m confused. I’ve fully vaccinated two months. would wear mask? Liberty Prime variant  true. We're probably missing many mild cases. It’s individual act, it’s broader issue actually finish. originally told we’re keeping societal efforts got effective vaccines (and wore mask religiously entire time), got vaccines, still effective ones current variants, everyone willing gotten them, people want move goal posts unspecified end line. Where’s end? virus isn’t going go away time near future, it’s contagious enough always around, everywhere.

I think plenty people signed collective effort prevent getting severely ill dying, didn’t sign prevent vaccinated people getting slight chance getting mild cough indefinitely, trying protect people refuse get vaccinated themselves.

If individuals want keep wearing mask prevent personal illnesses that’s great, it’s unrealistic unfair try force society wear they’ve vaccinated, unless we’re nearing catastrophic case loads hospitalizations again. also interesting going bar restaurant kids vaccinated.

I kids vaccination age still gone dine restaurant. I've gotten used eating home peace quiet. take occasionally burning desire eat restaurant. started giving second doses first doses easier get ever (same day appointments). demand still dropped everyone eager get vaccinated already it. Probably Funniest part people lashing mad people DEFINITELY aren’t covid sub lmao. Maybe start yelling people public instead Two masks time write word many subs, get tagged auto-mods hateful language. nearly got banned r/aliens using term “useful idiot” quotes like that. science folks thoughts 2.1 fold reduction Delta? Seems like significant consistent high circa-90% efficacy numbers hearing? Palm Springs 115F+, uncomfortable still doable.

Plus, says masks indoors around people. going temperature indoors people mandated don’t want wear mask. Nothing stopping wearing one. really. vaccinated person indoors close proximity couple hours someone Covid, I'd wager almost certain get it. science points direction. 

The astronomically low statistical event would vaccinated end hospital due symptoms Covid event. That's what's nearly unheard of. Get Pfizer. Shudders, imagine antivaxxers partying outside White House Rage Machine (which danced unironically) closes credits. Nah.  proper scientific experiment, would need least roughly number vaccinated unvaccinated participants, equal number. efficacy people already covid? thoughts booster shot? Particularly would work could get people get it. extremely difficult get half country vaccinated first time. boosters required fall, don’t see you’d able stay ahead variant pops up?

By work, mean would make difference whole rest world that’s going take forever get original vaccine? Due that, feel like booster shots targeted people higher risk vaccinating everyone honestly bewildered disagree reasons? find single point might empathetic about? Seems sensible! thought get lot push back along - oh discriminates unvaccinated. that's kind point - drink outside. allowed blow peanut dust everyone walk wanted AZ mostly stick Macron, yes understand petty know care.  Good, seems lot people unwilling wear mask crowded public indoor space whatever reason, despite mild inconvenience. evidence allergy hypothesis show much stronger link allergy rates childhood antibiotic use exposure microbes “the outdoors”.

Children less sick requiring less antibiotics much larger benefit detriment caused exposed less harmless microbes. find looking happened UK Israel. true, I’m 30 got pzifer today. underlying conditions. possible think likely. brain regions really specialized processing taste/smell (like piriform cortex) really show atrophy. regions atrophied lot ones handle complex cognitive functions like memory reward processing.

It would interesting look changes correlate symptoms like post covid fatigue data seems. Lol. It’s funny say specifically since I’m home surgery Fallopian tubes removed don’t kids. Yeah question is, aren’t hospitals okay? LA county 250 new cases total yesterday, three deaths. find hard believe medical infrastructure danger way was, say, six months ago, start pandemic. vaccination rates 50%, doubt really going see explosive case growth either. 10% Japan's population fully vaccinated. fucking huge swath population can't vaccinated yet: kids. close able vaccinate; estimates say probably mid-September. meantime, summer northern hemisphere, assuming that's are, feel normal want outside. inside, fucking wear mask. big deal goddamned tired people pretending ten year old person worth protecting. Wearing mask fucking big deal. not. quoting from?

1 death India sounds like cherry picked data. what? June 5 5:15 pm 5:45?

Be specific. So, ok. live LA county? 

Last week, LA county daily new case average 260. That's little 10M people. That's 2.6 per 100,000. 

If concerns you, many things concern much much more. we’re going go back forth this? end? seat belts save lives? Absolutely.

Can seat belt protect every type crash? No.

Even seat belts air bags know car crashes people survive.

So like saying ""even though seat belt airbags, drive 100 mph around other"" Maybe homes lot businesses still AC... That's really great excuse (source, live here) good news masks mandated outside pandemics Asia. personal choice. stigma people wear masks.

I think everyone wear mask go sick. Personally, might wear mask flu season, especially since can't figure keep scarf face. I'm definitely okay wearing mask, issues there. getting tested? also symtpoms? too. can't grasp mentality people think locking wearing masks forever good thing. want move enjoy life without feeling guilt pandemic still rest world. Probably signal stop reading news. Lol come FL 5-40 people wear masks . Immunocompromised people ""compromised"" since pandemic. Nothing changes far know... care. wear N95s roll around giant hamster balls. outlaw peanuts public cause kid allergic. Well, means dumb dumbs getting ""hoax"" ”as vaccination rates pick up” Holy shit. immature you? Aside people really can’t vaccinated kids, really don’t care giving unvaccinated people. chance get shots, that’s 🤷‍♂️ Yeah, absolutely way putting mask back on. 

If Gavin issues another mask order see actually getting recalled.   also ask, many survivors vaccinated? understand correctly, delta variant, seemed vaccinated people weren’t transmitting virus. fast new variant spreading, uncertain vaccinated people fact spread now. area might unvaccinated people, would wise mask again. among vaccinated people, risk low breakthrough infection, bad catching flu. base here? think problem single dose people study said Phiser 30ish% effective delta first dose. glued phone. fuck kidding. even look kids. “Not big deal wear indoors”

Found nonessential worker. national trend. I've heard story colleagues across US. ICU full capacity, severe nursing shortages, months.

Several months ago, Admin tried cut nursing staffing, one ICU nurse director fought back insist maintaining staffing, much penalty. ICU nurses thing keeping ones afloat.

They telling us getting traveling nurses months now. travelers basically dictate terms, since high demand. ones slated come longer want work nights, demanding fewer shifts. additionally, good start know local culture, medical record charting, even simple stuff, like things located--meaning require bit training/orientation. nurses sucking past 15 months seeing travelers come get paid easier job. 

We've nurses leave become travelers--one ended accidentally getting scheduled back ICU, admin realized bad would nurses see working days, getting paid substantially more. moved another hospital system.  putting others risk collectively. virus continue circulate longer decision. People die choices. No, real reason wear masks protect children 12. Stop acting like spot anyone wants vaccinate can. 

Also, every single case chance mutate, one day going mutate beyond vaccines protect against. going mask vulnerable can't vax, mask future self going feel like asshole come winter stuck inside theta variant. Dude. want anti masters either. Nope :( possible fifth wave Tokyo reported 317 infections Monday ninth week-on-week virus rebounding emerged days government lifted state emergency Tokyo nine regions, despite evidence failed dramatically reduce capital subject relaxed “quasi” emergency measures, bars restaurants asked stop serving alcohol 7 pm close hour avoided catastrophic Covid-19 outbreak, initially slow vaccine rollout, coupled restrictions government’s ability enforce business closures, led repeated rebounds emergency measures lifted country reported almost 800,000 cases since start pandemic 14,700 deaths – one highest tolls region. Yeah going back home becoming painful. I’m going back weeks I’m already mentally prepping bullshit. Hospitals short ""business""?

So market correction. went prevent hospitals overrun large numbers deaths focusing almost entirely number cases. Proof vaccines work also proof can’t isolate panic every single time new cases new variant Um described 90% sub. ""\_\_\_ school requires vaccinations."" ""unvaccinated ppl dying."" ""x% infected people unvaccinated."" Top comments threads: ""get vaccinated people!!!"" people unvaccinated Covid find hard think occurrence there, might take years gather steam again...and probably variants covid know yet...keep masks close by.  Yeah - honestly feels like never ending cycle. Restrictions end put back place suggested weeks later. don’t get tell people months vaccines get us back normal effective tell everyone wear mask again. seems contradictory

If get booster shot point, don’t see you’re gonna get amount people vaccinated you’re also telling still wear mask. It’s constant rule changes annoying part pandemic said, hospitalizations bad would expected earlier strains. make Delta dangerous? everyone immune basically become common cold. ""x% infected unvaccinated"" figure actually makes sense (for once) Delta came around lot people got vaccinated. Vs times used time frame late 2020-present obviously loaded stat hardly anyone vaccinated spring. No. real reason wear mask protect people like son, isn’t allowed get vaccine yet could another 8 9 decades life ahead shouldn’t spent coping sequelae virus. Delta strain spreading 'rapidly' Mississippi

What actions taking contain outbreak? Better going waste, shit. 

I afraid eastern europe going big trouble delta gets particularly summer going last forever. vaccination profiles Bulgaria Romania incredibly sad compared western Europe. EU fair, vaccines distributed member states strictly per capita, none pull much ahead (though fall got 24.3% people least one dose little less fully vaccinated meaning almost everybody wanted vaccinated likely already.

The Eu average 49.5% one dose, 31.4% fully vaccinated. ""old"" EU countries 50-60% least one dose.  masks part culture war allowed define identities. grew hour outside St. Cloud call ""city"". Appreciate coming back sources! Thanks need make well known. travelled month itchy throat day two lot sneezing days. Would gotten tested turned anything else, sneezing main symptom cough, fever aches, get tested. ""still"" prohibited? ""Year half""?

I'm sure referring - really noticeable day day life first 4 months here.

I mean yes, there's days year we've told stay home wear masks, we're literally discussing pub month. country impact much less? people drive, generally wear seatbelts. Look ways crossing street.

Nearly 1.5million people die year due road accidents. sounds like everyone vaccinated, idea family member covid first? Curious kinds spreads happen among vaccinated group. hope you’re ok/asymptomatic. cloth mask probably better nothing, yes. might people can't vaccinated, always case disease wear masks those

I do, know it. 
I've shared office people who've organ transplants. know they're immune suppressed. wore masks colds despite unfashionable US. Killing coworkers generally frowned upon. 


Same deal nursing homes hospitals - see truly frail, wear mask.

Now know larger segment population usual risk. get see nieces nephews soon, half young vaccinated. I'm pretty sure masks order day, particularly indoors. Yes, everybody get vaccinated it’s available them. Protect yourself, rest society economy time. article says “this pandemic unvaccinated” Fuck anti-vaxxers. vaccine still highly effective Delta. vaccine stupid reasons, tough shit. ain't wearing mask obsession perfect protection bad obsession *just* death rate.

Cloth masks *help*. reduce initial infection load. Yes, N95 KN95 effective (and they're much easier get now, probably they're important). *still* lot better nothing. St. Cloud Minnesota's asshole surprising all. Same. Keep on, brother (or sister). need make getting vaccinated covid requirement like 500 shots get kid. Would stop antivaxxers? bet lot would get shot inconvenient. required entered government buildings get plane instance. Yes, did, regardless people upvoting lie fits prejudices. made mistake I’m hating you, people upvoting lie upvoting want hear - backwards, southern state low educational attainment rate. One could argue there’s racist element kind thinking given Mississippi highest proportion African Americans US state. today Mississippi's vaccination percentage ranks [dead states.  “How dare choose spread disease catch disease!” “loonies” mean “epidemiologists”? Orange County exact opposite lol There's like 7 people vaccinated Australia lol, vaccines work need least 50% population vaccinated see meaningful impact. anyone else terrified going go back mass lockdowns restrictions fall? Maybe I'm letting media get me. nice returning relatively normal pre-pandemic life US, pandemic obviously still raging parts world. teamed vaccine hesitancy US lack accessible vaccines poorer countries makes feel like we're never going make fully. get started countries vying hard zero covid keeping borders closed indefinitely... miss days COVID always mind capacity another. high level vaccination it’s slowed supply. vaccine uptake highest Europe it’s bad, still mid 30s age group. They’ve announced AZ J&amp;J used 18s shorter gap hopefully speeds things up. thanks separation families plain wrong admitting business people. Business done virtually part. It’s all? Sorry gets upset. Thanks getting vaccinated. someone dealing ongoing health issues since COVID able get proper care due providers arguing cause, thank you. Thank rational human understands people needlessly suffering. condom thing completely unrelated. cold/flu strain dangerous covid-19, yes. people can't vaccinated, spread among unvaxxed may lead new variant resistant current vaccines. 


Like not, vaccine mean COVID problem anymore - smaller problem. Something like that. Delta sending 4% vaccinated people hospital (I'm even sure sending 4% total)  Yes farce. option close everything? takeout outdoor seating?

I thought headline implied high level vaccination Ireland. Wrong assumption part. video June 10th meeting. listened whole thing live maybe misinterpreted something agree increasing number participants required trials length time data collected. part near end. Also throughout meeting 0 mention long covid/PASC many times members agreed low risk kids 12 EUA warranted. 

There quite bit time spent discussing since covid low risk kids would irresponsible give EUA vaccine limit spread general public health benefits. take would right vaccinate kids covid ""just"" limit spread potential virus evolve really immediate direct health risk kids. heard saying think. personally think risk kids directly high enough even true potential become risky kids would concern well. course, need data evaluate safety effectiveness vaccine age groups. far, data looks good. 

I hoping change mind see things getting worse kids (i.e., cases due changing social behaviors, troublesome variants etc) hope people within FDA taking potential long term effects Covid consideration moreso committee. two parties, aren't. two exist disagree pretty major issues.

Should women right choose? LGBTQ people rights all? climate change real? people get vaccinated Covid? It’s pandemic, though. Nobody signed this. Nobody wants it. It’s unfair expect vaccinated people wear mask like it’s unfair people die others get sniffles.

There nothing fair fun this. Honestly, people realistic start, would never believed virus would packed within year. wouldn’t disappointment thinking century event would change lives handful months.

It sucks everyone, asking people wear masks really life altering watching people die. Even they’re self inflicted, someone still mourning. wonder due buses situation Russia really dire hayfever wearing mask makes much worse me. pollen get stuck mask sneeze cough like covid patient never did.

I'm glad leave home box. biggest concern get point country whole doesn’t listen anymore. Pandemic fatigue real think everyone certain extent. There’s almost like feeling never going end even though day will

There’s lot said reacting virus overreacting harmful misleading. Especially want people get vaccinated tell spread it? exactly think happens vaccinated infected thing vaccinated against? system shorter period time window spreading narrower got around people they'll get it. studying whether Delta Plus — slight variant highly contagious Delta variant first detected India accounts 90% Moscow’s new cases — dangerous vaccine-resistant original Covid-19 global experts fear additional mutation Delta Plus variant coronavirus could make resistant antibodies.

Take like.  Oahu, Hawaii 99% people stores office still wear masks. Outdoors, drops 50-80% depending area (and 15-20% touristy, local areas). I've fully vaccinated months I'm wearing one anymore. Sorry piece cloth critical identity. Sorry original 30% purely based memory accurate (I’ve updated comment) - I’ve found range anywhere 15-80, obviously incredibly dependent going body. I’ve got couple papers below… hope helps!

Solid tumor cancer cancer here’s big summary paper I’ve Third bottle right literally says A.S.S LOL April 2020 everything describe mirrors experience pretty much exactly. Nearly savoury foods, meat, eggs etc weird smell/taste. poop also changed smell, hard describe like really, similar anything I've experienced before, describe bad smell/taste certainly weird. Toothpaste also weird flavor also.

It took almost entire year clear up. lasted long starting wonder would way forever, eventually return normal saying Delta variant isn’t dangerous anyone vaccinated - specifically underlying conditions - man media doomsday mode anytime there’s hint bad potentially bad news LA County California first place US throwing around idea bringing back indoor masks. That’s mutations immune response isn’t successful with, especially older people.

Not fades. could prevent mutations would hold.

Covid isn’t mutating way. True. I’ve Target Walmart recently probably one without mask. weird Obviously, new infective variants lot unvaccinated people fact nothing ever going absolute zero shouldn’t used guide public health policy right imo would also help people essentially forced go work sick, missing couple days means can't pay bills.

When worked restaurants considered ""normal"". ""Yeah I'm sick gotta make money!"". 3 4 people get sick next week. God forbid pay people enough afford couple days rather get co workers customers sick. don’t really think going normal lives plus piece cloth ever going silver bullet. Seems like lot people didn’t understand guidance *don’t go avoid it,* wear mask can’t avoid going out. never magic shield let still everything always did. Mask schools prevent constant outbreaks kids catching home still forcing cohorts shut I'm affraid.  Low*er* risk groups, absolute level risk kids COVID, especially delta variant, many things take precautions - even moreso account long term non-fatal effects COVID infection. many people look nothing death rate compared age groups come conclusion incomplete data. 
Really confusing say least. know extra cautious there’s nothing wrong surface level. However, going confuse ton people. vaccines extremely effective virus strains know like Delta 

I don’t get message officials vaccine protects others mask anyway even though told long ago don’t wear one good chuckle convo XD realize people working every day week sitting home? rather short cited privileged take matter wear mask. Pfizer’s press release. 

From page (emphasis added) Data study, including longer term safety, comprehensive information duration protection, **efficacy asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection**, safety immunogenicity adolescents 12 15 years age gathered months ahead. Additional studies planned evaluate BNT162b2 pregnant women, children younger 12 years, special risk groups, immunocompromised.

So study look this, couldn’t: didn’t routine testing trial participants—only people got sick tested. Therefore, would way get information asymptomatic infections. happens run Greek letters? know matter time (months) we're announcing Omega variant. roll ""Alpha Prime""? ""Alpha Alpha""?  
 
Ugh. worst timeline. Someone needs reset damn matrix. Ok enough enough? kids vaccinated? always variants. I’m seriously asking - Los Angeles residents, public health figures anyone else US agree done go back living lives without mandate urgent recommendation masks possible every couple weeks months? It’s exhausting. vaccinated masks year, US pretty much lifted mandate, honestly annoying LA culture suggestions public health officials always conservative overly cautious opinion. yeah totally COVID much worse flu. I'm talking moving forward. 

just everyone wants vaccine, get one. antivaxxers going prevent us reaching herd immunity, would rather die COVID long-term health complications. take COVID stay, new reality. 

before vaccinated, see *anyone* people interacted needed 6 feet away wearing mask. vaccinated, they're effective, I'm struggling understand endgame considering plummeting vaccination rates delta variant. lived years, I'm aware large. location, rural folks travel lot get groceries such. attracts certain crowd I'm glad left. seem like need ~~not~~ worry 

I think meant say. following COVID all? ICU hospitalizations deaths increase three weeks following infections. infections currently increasing exponentially, hospitalizations deaths follow. Moderna Pfizer way similar CureVac fully vaccinated pro-vaccine, “100% effective.”  95% effective.  Fully vaccinated people hospitalized died COVID.  vaccine greatly reduces chances developing severe COVID, 100% effective.  false information . Awesome. Thank you! probably exactly looks like; cold. Colds minor respiratory viruses made comeback last months. Get test makes feel better, it’s likely cold. *Here dragons* 🐉 people drive, generally wear seatbelts. Look ways crossing street. Flying far safer think, still pre-flight checks. 


You're arguing activities take uncontroversial safety precautions every day justify *abandoning* common sense safety precautions situation. non-sequitor. always rolling dice pot. headline little dismissive really strongest brain findings date scanned people covid. makes lot stronger typical correlational study Cause Australian government useless order enough Pfizer till early 2021.

Basically sucky situation Australian people, federal government shown give shit. wonder last year half impact allergies children. Maybe jt lead allergies long run? think that's fact bodies immune system got weaker due long period time masking social distancing. going without mask around people I'm sure cause something. never effective pandemic response Covid-19

Sure have. Putting aside H1N1 pandemic, else think Smallpox eradicated Polio nearing eradication? Seriously lol. leave house forced interact strangers. Learn countries. Strangers talk smile other. suspicious. dad lived country decided retire Omaha, NE freaking places. really likes exception lack beaches. don’t get though. even thinking getting Pfizer later get now, least that's think. lot us vaccinated folks young kids still worry Delta affecting them. ads attached xbox ps4 trailers would hit broader audiance It’s funny script flipped wearing mask makes people think Covid anti vaxxer. vax stop catching it, (or passing on) hopefully stop hospitalised dying it. 

To clear, actually varying degree depending vaccine individual, right *completely* prevent infection transmission. That's he's min-interpreted data come incorrect conclusion. look Kaplan Meier curves, Pfizer trial, cases vaccine group start diverging placebo group around day 11. J&amp;J, it’s around day 15. Australia even lmao Yes protecting health people disgusting /s Isn’t like 4% Australia vaccinated? I’m pretty sure reason they’re lock low number almost immunity, either vaccines prior infection. point it’s probably safe assume Moderna Pfizer yield nearly results. mRNA learned CureVac. least know others name.

Beta variant become pretty irrelevant now. way less contagious Alpha Delta variants. Even South Africa Delta variant completely sweeping Beta. Interesting, hope everyone healthy! anyone symptoms? news, people never stop breathing. Same. idea happened him? vaccine effective delta variant, wearing masks already what's point this? majority UK vaccinated, give long-hauler story. 

So, we'll ignore inconvenient facts, like 1 5 working-aged people 30 could lives ruined disability. great trajectory folks. mis-reading data. chart control vaccination rate. Alpha two peaks low-vaccination times, delta become dominant strain *after* almost every UK person 50 jabs. course it'll lower death rate, everyone vulnerable UK vaccinated. This.

I got downvoted towns subreddit saying this.

I took pandemic seriously whole time. can't force stupid people want vaccine get it, I'm done trying convince protect them. I'm fully vaxxed covid stay forever. I'm letting ruin another year life. understand logic behind stopping mutations possibly breed unvaccinated idiots, half like ""oh unvaccinated people affected?"" I'm sad them....

Obviously people can't feel that's unlike many things life portion left fend themselves. Right wrong that's life was, appears accurate, mean interest nothing Delta variant. example: 


- Unvaccinated people still people. Taking steps save value, especially remember people *can't* vaccinated. 


- people COVID-19 infects, greater chance mutate way makes resistant current vaccines. 


- Death consequence COVID-19. still somewhat unclear likely vaccinated person develop ""long-covid"" symptoms like lung damage. take risk wearing mask cheap effective? Sorry source 94% symptomatic only? great news got second Moderna yesterday oh boy… weren’t lying said “You might experience reaction second time around.” stop telling so. want see face. need see mine. Stop invading privacy making loom face.  got Pfizer am/was happy that. like get second dose three weeks first (instead four Moderna), seems fewer/milder side effects Moderna, effective enough would feel comfortable (for example) sitting inside restaurant. last point important me—I wanted take vaccine would make feel good “returning normal,” I’m sure J+J ever would done me.

That said, would also happy Moderna, since first two points really quite unimportant scheme things. There’s two different things discussed - severity transmissibility. 
Generally, people vaccinated develop disease likely mild symptoms. 
This changed variants. 
The delta variant, however, way way transmissible. original covid 60% people vaccine (or antibodies infection) would herd immunity covid cases would general go down. delta variant, 83% required cases steadily go down. don’t go down, go up. severity stays vaccinated people chances unvaccinated catching steadily increasing cases go see many kids / immune compromised/ unvaccinated get sick it. 
That’s warnings trying avoid. didn’t actually read thread you? ""Safe"" seems ever moving goal. *is* level death that's going inevitable endemic disease, there's really moral way put number there. protecting every single person forever simply realistic. spent 2020 isolated, got vaccine second available me. According people website I'm bad rabid anti-mask/anti-vaxxers dragged things whole pandemic suggest maybe time go back normal. 16% behind Vermont. Unlike lot people, appreciate haha! option get J&amp;J tommorow would probably wait 1-3 weeks first dose Pfizer.

Should get J&amp;J potentialy Pfizer shot somewhere line wait Pfizer since seems like better vaccine? No, asked objective numbers People never stopped wearing masks Asian countries dealt swine flu. Masking norm please spread variants create new ones please please please! refuse go office wfh pandemic never ends can't make us :). cool. Well, technically sucessful offer excceeded demand sample size actually 6?

Moreover, I'm far interested happens vaccinated person testing positive/experiencing systems Delta goes party. 12 year old child chance protect him/herself.

I also understand people binary masks. Masks mean can't patronize shops. means patronize shops little piece cloth face. little piece cloth exceptionally good preventing droplets flying breathed in. many mechanisms prevent droplets spreading, masks best compromise ""life normal"" public safety.

Having vaccine means relatively well protected, invincible. catch COVID post-vaccine (and happen), overwhelmingly positive chance serious complications. Nobody answer authoritatively long-term effects catching COVID post-vaccine are, ""long term"" phase yet. able start trials 10 years ago see 10 year effect is.

It could 10 years now, humans little scar immune system, like trees wildfire. could that's left COVID. could people caught actual virus extremely susceptible otherwise mundane illnesses later. could people got vaccine get acute liver failure decade now. bill more?

According Googles, Wales highest 51.9% currently. would I? Yeah, make eat kitchen kind anti making subtle disguise. know many wearing N95s, parroting that, think legitimizing non-masking beliefs.

 


There many types masks, genuine KN95, Kf94, CN95 masks, long seal tight, filter nearly well N95s. need safety studies..... Especially since anti-vaxers never wore masks first place. problem science works. It’s never 100% certain anything long vaccine lasts position atom, everything probabilistic. “sure” want data need. additional data change conclusion sometimes significantly. willing roll punches use best science availible right now, even may change. unfair people right thing got vaccinated.

""It's complex problem **\[ bonus cost savings might risk\]""**  Freedom isn’t limited comfortable Yep me, thought could handle work take day off. I've never fever like far I’m aware, isn’t effective. getting flu shot masking every single flu season seems bit extreme. Especially considering flu circulates year round. I’m conflating covid flu, logic people using getting awfully close “we wear masks time flu too.” political party's politicians pushing violent rhetoric campaign ads last decade (at least, remember Palin's infamous ad?)? One side stood far regard increasing illogical rabid base. Fact. yeah, monsters, traitors, fake fucking patriots, pick label. incorrect. best fact continue getting vaccinated wearing masks reduce r0. simple effective measure.  See huge comment above, got exactly right.

Also, boosters would likely smaller dose. 24% people US children, what's scary can’t confirm number I’m going try. clearly confusion throughout thread. literally stated number incorrect. insist I’m making massive error judgment, would argue proving point fellow Mississippians foolish hucklefucks absolutely deserve derision invite upon ourselves. Thanks coming Ted talk. This. obvious caveats referenced study high contact settings primarily one dose (meaning two doses likely increase protection), 

But extrapolate one dose findings imply two doses near 100% protective doubtful given risk symptomatic infection vs 1 vs 2 doses mRNA example, generate extreme infection differentials, dominance systemic, AB's projected 'enough' catch virus early local mucosal sites prevent infection entirely beginning 

The caveat, reverse -- mention timing study predating Delta dominance.  Delta demonstrably transmissable associated lower cycle count-- preliminary evidence shows infected spread bigger clusters effectively. words, despite vaccinated persons indeed lower risk spreading virus, (lower viral loads, faster clearance) etc. 

This misinformation vaccinated people 'cannot spread' virus- (which see come least day here, often heavily upvoted) needs stop sake public health. 'spreading doom' wanting people mask forever, vaccines main way - let's deny data. 

We see great data Singapore extremely competent contact tracing demonstrates notion vaccinated people 'cannot' catch, spread (as CDC director claimed recently, CDC walk back) simply false. short, vaccines tremendous help 100% silver bullet. Particularly certain emerging variants like Delta. Personally I'm really interested seeing results intranasal vaccines coming months-- available indications preclinical data effectively stop virus upper respiratory tract-- least younger populations ie bring us closer 'sterilizing immunity' thereby stronger effect neutering transmission vs current intramuscular candidates ears scars 6 days sweating kitchen oven, shit dug skin 2 dollars week membership fee Hyvee plus.

There. showed data. show data says flu FAR less risky covid 12. - vaccines protect extremely well, almost downside
- masks protect sorta ok, especially everyone around masked, almost downside
- variant coronavirus spreading spreads faster may dangerous original

I'm pretty sure agree that, right? Seems hurt masked vaccinated right now. bit outrageous selling one nation, rather redistributed proportionally among member states, selling might mean motivation increase vaccination numbers.

OOOO CLEVER hope stepdad okay. Apologies insensitive question, planning getting vaccine? already vaccinated?

I'm trying judge, I'm really interested learning kind thing. Delta variant slightly higher chance ""breakthrough"" infect vaccinated person, compared older variants. may get symptoms slightly contagious does. vaccine still highly effective almost eliminating chance severe symptoms hospitalization. Great question. know. easy wear mask indoors see reason stop now. Especially know simple act literally save lives. LA County also closed outdoor dining winter despite evidence limited outdoor transmission is. 

I think they’re ridiculously cautious point questionable judgement anything else. No, people really want return life without masks, speculate vaccination prevent transmission, thereby allowing engage risky behavior. guys J&amp;J one? Mistake Delta dangerous 2 kids can't get vax. every new infection potentially resistant variant. think handle mask 5 minutes day. gonna happen. 

I’m youngish. I’m vaccinated. others concerned, continue mask avoid crowds. 

I’m bs again. neither folks. went ok wearing mask within week wear one again. nice all. disconnect vocal people believe mask = end world. really big deal wear mask indoors going life usual.

Moderna also, I'm still going mask Delta cases plateau US. going spread quick amongst unvaccinated, get antibodies stop spreading air there'll less risk ""breakthrough"" case. ~90% efficiency 1 vaccinated person still get infected every 20 unvaccinated. obviously know many, spending much time judging people :) can't make math add up, like 50% county fully vaccinated, 50% wear masks local grocery store, know way people got vaccine ones wearing masks :) I've already told number came from. Feel free go back read.  vaccines weren’t effective, would agree you. irritant absolute decrease efficiency causes line work, absolutely stand called necessity them. become minor efficacy real world terms vaccinated individuals entertaining idea significantly accomplishing anything. Yea, N95s awhile face looked beat usual. Scientific Method 

The scientific process typically starts COVID far widespread infectious diseases mentioned, pushes risk up. 

And STILL less risky are, think still vaccinating kids diseases? risk profile covid ages 18, one would know covid exists one would bother make vaccine it. US would 2-3k covid deaths told everyone dying rate 18 are. get 50k deaths average flu data I've seen support claim, even close

Link bro Maybe many. It’s much hassle easily forged. Many restaurants bars hard time finding workers. Adding another annoying job duty checking vaccine status won’t help Greek speakers seeing alphabet order hurts brain. got tested unvaccinated step-dad tested positive symptoms really flared up. cold-like symptoms headaches also tested positive. far symptoms pretty mild can't smell anything super weird. when, exactly? Herd immunity going happen what's goalpost? There's always adoption? ER dangerously understaffed techs, paramedics, nurses. see 300 patients day. Everyone leaving due unsafe patient ratios, PTO denial even months advance, low morale, etc. They've even started forcing work Spring/Summer Fall/Winter *critical staffing day* top regular holiday rotation. critical staffing days paid time half. really awful. quality care diminishing greatly understand it’s end world. even endgame anymore? trying say idfuckiots. I'm kinda you, sure going back normal yet right. We're ~50% vaccinated US. people vaccinated COVID also immune antibodies...for now. vaccinated people, know long going last opinion continue slowly ease restrictions full blown ""if vaccinated safe"". Unfortunately lot places fully lifted health orders restrictions so, least area, we've already reached ""inevitable amounts death"" acceptance moving along life.

Going stores I'm probably ~10% people still masking up. Given that, fact vaccines 100% I'm really looking one breakout cases. I'm ready accept normal think others willing accept higher level hygiene. First step-dad got back work trip Cali. He's unvaccinated got super ill. sister started cold-like symptoms headaches tested positive even though vaccinated, got tested also positive. sister negative, brother also negative. Super strange. far vaccinated folks fine, save sinus pressure headaches. also can't smell anything right super weird. already high population currently exists. Imagine numbers would like *more* people. They're wild type. They're GMOs me, wearing good mask like kf94 mask grocery store help protect me. People hung masks don’t get since time don’t wear long. doesn’t bother wearing mask  Areas heavily vaccinated significantly lower ceiling high case numbers get, mostly unvaccinated areas still big surges cases Sure, new cases within last couple months still two population centers.  SF/SJ areas Bay Area. It’s harder find someone unmasked public space (not including clubs/bars). Even though majority eligible people fully vaccinated, still give fuck. wear N95 work. absolutely irritant me. Still gotten used it. Lends new meaning ""Mississippi Delta."" So... tell people wear masks, people wear masks people take seriously people vaccinated. unvaccinated hanging together ignoring masking well. Vaccinated people mask ""just case"" show we're taking seriously, we're much good. people primarily intended protect protected it. system work focusses running 2.5 - 3% profit margin COVID kicked us nuts last year $50 million loss. I'm sure healthcare systems ""penny pinchers"", I'm lucky job pays well (even though I've raise 3 years). Hell, reinstated 401k matching - things getting pretty rough around here. Yeah that’s thought UK deaths data. Clearly hidden factor affecting mortality rates vaccinated unvaccinated deaths, expected age. Pretty much yes. explains slight drop efficiency fully vaccinated also explains two doses necessary. Yeah I’m sorry situation. Hope family get shots soon! people roughly age still one

Strange. knowledge, hepatitis B vaccine administered within 24 hours birth (unless contraindications), maybe recent rule though. Yep, appears degree trade-off contagiousness immune evasion. still effects Probably coincidence, though.

It coincidence. NM even worse educational system people remain masked. politics education. We'll see young idiots die natural immunity wanes become reinfected. true, vaccinations would expect see weakening link (i.e. high cases would correspond lower number hospitalizations deaths). means could potentially tolerate higher number cases without overwhelming health systems. responded posting [this reading post. shows vaccine notably reduces risk household transmission 40-50% compared unvaccinated individuals. Vaccine hesitancy opened doors mass vaccination, meant urban youth, probably main drivers pandemic, got jabs early stages. probably low case numbers (less 100 daily, population 17-18 mil). Urban centers, including Bucharest, 60%+ entire population vaccinated. city, basically 100% people know imune, either disease vaccine. success. young children… never remove masks ever? Infectious diseases going nowhere, neither viral diseases. Meanwhile, people likely wear masks vaccinated people. think shows capable of, willing.

So, we're going ignore horrific educational, social, psychological, economic costs 2 weeks turned 18 months? breakthrough infection occurs, theoretically spread infected. said, [recent research shows vaccine notably reduces risk household transmission 40-50% compared unvaccinated individuals. would surprised see CDC guidance says cannot confirm everyone's vaccination status, masks recommended, would surprised moved wearing mask everyone vaccinated. risk low situation. necessarily. 
Not everyone covid loses sense taste smell. keep expanding areas life? Next thing know they're gonna make get bunch MMR TB vaccines go school. wont there, nanny state probably require safety shit drive car. Ain't nuttin goes body except 3 B's. Bud, Budweiser, Butter see situation government pushing vaccination people already seropositive and/or children lowest risk covid disease? drug 100% safe including vaccines, always risk/benefit analysis consider factors like (already immune, young children etc)


That question policy science, many factors go it’s hard really evaluate simple way. First foremost, may red tape/bureaucracy way making recommendations based serostatus, since FDA strict guidelines trials run mean (this also proposed potential reason why, despite evidence suggesting unnecessary, second dose still recommended even infected individuals). Second, testing everyone antibody status expensive time-consuming, policy makers may want incentivize people getting shot quickly possible, there’s strong evidence vaccination saves lives, delay, whether measured days weeks, would caused people getting antibody tested first, would almost certainly result lost lives. Third, consider propensity people misinterpret advice, becomes stronger complex advice - someone says “get vaccinated”, it’s simple advice, hard misinterpret. say “get vaccinated, haven’t xyz”, starts muddy water. explain “hey mean confirmed previous infection antibodies measurable level”, people may miss ignore part decide “I felt sick March last year I’m good”.

Now people paying lots attention scientific articles starts come across dishonest sometimes, honestly think that’s present almost policy, policymakers try decide makes sense advise people, account human psychology top facts situation.

I think general, policymakers regulators clearly decided vaccine *safe enough* given people previously infected, advising *everyone* get vaccinated acceptable strategy. Now, future, evidence starts come rare cases ITP, myocarditis, whatever are, happen strongly related previous infection... advice vaccinate everyone may come scrutiny, still weighed lives saved delaying vaccination.

It’s complicated. live San Diego, Shasta County mask mandate lifted, Shasta County never really abided mask mandate, really change there, could see driving 5, got south Sacramento gas stations started people wear masks. 

Now, San Diego conservative LA general, would say generally pretty strong mask game whole thing, people happy able shed masks well. 

I'd say depends store, workers still generally wear masks, lots people don't. I'd say like 60% don't, general, said stores differ. BUT, would say people generally see wearing masks look like people probably vaccinated. 

I've vaccinated while, I'm glad shed mask lot situations. I'm PhD microbiology feel like setting bad example know several problems terms continuous potential transmission, also found problems people would wear masks outside way did, saw unnecessary, though never said anything people close me, want people understand viruses think PhD saying masks work, outside open direct sunlight decent UV index particles going deactivated completely inert, even low possibility reaching someone's ACE2 physiochemistry outside. Now, walking downtown crowded sidewalk little different, walking trail people, going run trail, beach, etc, make sense me. I've worked similar viruses (non-human pathogens, similar physiology) took like 2 months figure dying UV window lab, exposed minute.   It’s really clear yet anyone definitely need booster. We’re starting get back 12 month trial data, immunity still strong, far it’s looking like variant escape going big problem, may moot point. Yikes wearing KN95 daily since march 2020 8 hours interacting clients. bugged ears awhile anymore. definitely find good quality masks dont fog glasses. run mill supermarket masks shit look beyond find masks dont cause much problem Aaaand kept wearing Mask, even getting Vaccine. Safe sex include unprotected sex monogamous people tested. Nebraska currently around 35 avg cases per day right now, California around 1000 avg cases. 

So makes sense would see less people wearing masks area significantly less population density. mask recommendation indoors around people, end world group different vaccines? have, thanks Wondering same. I've seen articles state J&amp;J shot effective variants info much harder come since J&amp;J less common. 

Canada recommending one mRNA ""top up"" shot booster J&amp;J adenovirus vaccines. I'll probably hold give official recommendation.  doses administered still roughly probably second doses rising. Texas. anyone breakdown types vaccines administered UK? (Pfizer vs AZ, ,etc). serve good data point high mRNA vaccines country US predict spike Delta. Welcome treating everything like team sport thing matters color shirt wear. outrageous large companies forcing workers back office now, Delta variants ripping thru United States children vaccinated another six months so.  choice risk brain damage child's life job. liability associated ignoring science pretending well. dunno, expected delta stock going around now, month hill Remember *World* Health Organization. recommendations take account countries predominant vaccines ~60% effective, smaller segment population immune (via infection vaccination,) on. 

If US, CDC guidance specific circumstances. you’re another developed country government health agency, guidance specific you. Follow health authorities determined wisest course action are. empathetic seatbelt uncomfortable someone whatever reason. end day change reality situation. 

I find reasons petty comparison huge consequences face struggle see valid reasons. 

Having health reasons causes difficulty breathing good one respiratory virus so.... Get dis mahn shield! actually saying, too. Vaccination campaign success, wanted one, got one. Comedians.  what

I'm saying that:

""In Sydney, Australia, several people infected “fleeting” non-physical contact cafe shopping mall. CCTV footage revealed two people walking past mall transmitting virus.

Queensland’s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young decided close state’s borders people Sydney hotspots, telling Guardian, “with Delta variant, we’re seeing fleeting contact leading transmission.""

is absolutely science works. Rebrand vaccine bleach injection crisis Friendlier “own kind”

New Zealand one worst countries world accepting Maori still face systemic racism discrimination hard say whether vaccine hesitancy poor organisation lack effort gov side reach people information. Probably mixture above.

Eg UK get text letter every days vaccination remainder, info book vaccine information vaccine is. I'm saying perfect, good effort sure. quite vaccination centres reasonable distance, vaccine easy accessible. CDC also still recommends regularly disinfecting surfaces despite minor spread vector even relax distancing mask mandates effectively gone. track record COVID far ideal, solid argument guidelines vaccinated people overly permissive medical perspective attempt entice people getting vaccinated. 


Guidelines countries tend less permissive vaccinated people usually still advise mask use and/or distancing. Common sense limited US government says. case count typically doubles every week variant numbers low false sense security. Look, hope you’re right. people much smarter I, spent lot time college studying stuff lot years working field, worried it. think know better people guess that’s belief like said hope you’re right.

But we’ve didn’t turn well. what? Masks fashionable? Masks helping avoid common cold go grocery store full kids cough directly strangers' faces? like cold. I’m really science folk, I’ve following stuff closely since November you’re right, 2.1-fold reduction pretty close irrelevant. press release doesn’t say exactly, believe fold reduction seen alpha 1.5-ish. So, based info, moderna neutralize delta almost clip alpha, great clip.

I’d also point out/remind even 7-8 fold reduction beta also particularly concerning. studies pointed moderna Pfizer neutralizing beta high clip well (a Qatar study found Pfizer 75% it, fwiw). fold stuff get kind confusing, it’s important remember that, example, 2-fold reduction neutralization mean 2x less effective. Per first U.S. multisite test-negative design vaccine effectiveness study among HCP found single dose Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna COVID-19 vaccines **82% effective symptomatic COVID-19 2 doses 94% effective.**

(Emphasis added.) Yes hospitalizations deaths lower they’ve months people like spend time got vaccinated. continue plan lives around getting sick covid done everything power get sick covid including getting vaccinations? Nope never wearing mask I'm Maryland I'm used analyzing data maybe shed light.

On one hand, someone completely locked down, go first restaurant year half point think masks needed right now.

On hand, subreddit's idea vaccinated ignore everything completely wrong. Think vaccine protection two halves: personal protection herd immunity. personal protection great almost certainly keep going hospital dying. However, herd immunity real goal, non zero number one stay low. Think way - mRNA vaccines providing 95% personal protection. Herd immunity brought cases Maryland 1500 34 - 98% protection. Right vaccinated Maryland pretty much halves good go, even can't get vaccinated herd immunity half still protecting pretty well.

The problem Delta. Normally, waves caused relaxing attitudes rules much. relax wave (like Maryland last couple months), good sign. However, switch strain dominant. weak point understanding need pay attention to. cases explode, need ready restrictions. vaccines, highly doubt we'll return full blown quarantines. things start trending exponentially return masks past wave try get back herd immunity would beneficial everyone - vaccinated non vaccinated alike. happens though, worry masks. browse daily reports Ministry Health one 2nd detailed reports details like age, vaccine status, symptoms. vaccines mostly Pfizer Moderna. assume live either US UK asking this.

The put guidance job provide guidance whole world, countries don’t vaccination rates two countries listed above, keeping global guidance “do mitigation measures full force” makes sense. 

I’d say US, it’s safe visit vaccinated people still wear masks public precautionary measure. Avoiding crowded places unnecessary large gatherings would still good idea state low vaccination rate like Missouri Mississippi well.

If live UK, gonna lie, current case numbers, you’d better wearing outside times Delta variant control country. does, it! Well half LA county vaccinated responsibly wear mask indoors

I mean according LA County, cannot responsibly wear mask indoors anymore... ?? Exactly. think probably early say eradicated.  Sorry hear family. anecdotal experience trump millions data points though. Btw, clinical trial data reviewed independent boards. Poor quality? That's speculation. wear eight masks safe No. I’m fully vaccinated know I’m really putting people meaningful risk.

I can’t control people do. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Crazy. Canada vaccinated people rate infection low. still require masks. Masks like public health measure make people mad. know Americans think masks optional point. Long hauler beginning 2020 here. lose sense smell. everyone does. 
But suddenly lose sense smell, probably got covid. talking sides ass. complaining slow roll-out questioning AZ backflip. masks forever? That's great, thanks! That's it, I'm making t-shirt says, ""Vaccinated shedding, keep six feet back. Wear mask."" Anything that. God protect money. nations supposed receive equal share. Vaccines offered equal share, countries went in, meaning certain countries got more. Malta Denmark example getting lot Pfizer doses Austria. 

In high uptake countries, still enough supply, many EU countries, supply larger demand. It’s entirely political. been? Gotta spin narrative keep fear alive masses control

Everyone brain see bullshit probably doomsayers think need 3 masks get mail want start mixing doses vaccines without scientific basis. Ask question, I'll answer it. Yeah, value well-being mourning idiot whose death 100% caused dumb decisions, sorry. I’m hour 5 trying admit r/o ACS. beds available. recent refusal distance transfer. Ugh. frustrating applied several times part PTO clinical trials, kept getting denied. Choosing get vaccine bar ACTUAL medical conditions actually way selfish wearing mask.

Not getting vaccinated whatever stupid ass conspiracies watched YouTube makes stupid, obscenely selfish dangerous everyone. 

Your comment invalid I’ll consider word it. I’ve done part. many others. done. Come Nevada! blast. seem type bring CA politics you. forgetting children still unable get vaccines. saying go? “Think children!” all, seductive logic goes, evolutionary perspective makes sense pathogen harm host depends survival. According reasoning, virulence little temporary evolutionary imbalance.  comfortable chain reasoning rudely broken announcement “a realistic possibility” new highly transmissible B117 variant “is associated increased risk death”.  evidence still accruing, early estimates Nervtag, UK’s New Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, suggest B117 may around 30% Covid-19 circulate hope herd immunity 'could make lethal'  deeply entrenched idea, newly emerged agents disease inevitably evolve become benign time, scientifically unfounded, according new research.  can, fact, become virulent depending conditions, easier virus spread, likely so....**  pathogen meets resistance transmission – form recovered immune vaccinated host, social distancing – highly virulent forms perform less well die host, natural selection favours less virulent forms.  resistance, pathogen kill existing host evolutionary cost remains highly virulent** totally wear masks. I'm wearing one office right now. study lot issues. Voluntary tests. plaque assays. samples (e.g., Delhi) unrepresentative. Also Mumbai supposedly 60% seroprevalence recent wave hit.

And still leaves unsolved paradox missing excess deaths. civil, far off. Hmm might correct think closer study needed but, damn... summed perfectly. could make argument Gen X changed world much Woodstock generation, cool make show it. music also pretty fly. think sure delta spreads vaccinated individuals. vaccines seem prevent serious illness, still spread. scientists open it. know. science works. Trying find work works working solution Broken country. point vaccinated, could give less shit people getting infected. That's get sense vaccinations picking little bit?  people getting idea vaccines offer protection COVID-19 protect severe symptoms? I’m confused I’m seeing people say everywhere data says unless there’s new studies I’m aware new paper already gives answer: Delta much longer contagious (up 20 days!) shows much higher risk ratios hospitalization, pneumonia asking legit question, surely good faith. list transmissions Singapore quite obviously evidence (given months could converted study), there's chance ""studies"" disease existed outside India weeks.

The best data comes UK's [technical Read order get pretty good idea evolution knowledge Delta. One party tried that. party laughed called weak low energy got whipped violent frenzy lost last election.

And mean members did, enough stormed capitol.

Ignoring like saying water wet.  see vast conspiracy inject nanobots blood makes magnetic Bill Gates turns lib 5G towers...something something.

TBF neither many us chosen get vaccinated time. said, I'm simple man living half insane country apparently.

I relate. everyone wishes play *Star-Bellied Sneetches Sneetches Without*. Wear masks sick, nowhere common wear masks inside sick. 

Wearing masks indoors always prudent. Given logic, always wearing masks, sick not.  friend killed morning announcement hope California health department happy. 3 dose vaccine third dose 28th day first dose. Efficacy also measured 14 days final dose. longer vaccination timeline huge challenge

Don't Pfizer Moderna also take 28 days fully administer? Mississippian, poli-what now? seriousness, idiots elected Tater Tot Reeves governor. No, gave awhile ago. do, someone care dies year :) Oh ok, thank info Thats works. possible simultaneously possible new branches created C19? people seeing positive everyone needs take heed 1918 flu pandemic. large part reason younger people hit hard exposed strain all. Either vaccine works doesn't, irrelevant vaccine. Heard immunity affects never got LA. Nebraska. See difference? Might well different planet. literally wearing mask like trump hat it’s political probably safe people 12. need clinical trial data sure it. Clinical trails testing every drug, vaccines must pass normal 3 phases trials different age groups. typically bit red tape kids, process longer 18/16, longer still 12s. swear y’all love wearing masks got downvoted, you’re right. Covid can’t simultaneously ageist virus gets exponentially severe older get also “almost bad” kids sub tries imply. Cool, guess kid go back lockdown selfish continue wear mask everyone vaccinated. cares kid's quality life, take mask grocery store quality life good, guess that's matters. 

Lots folks ""protect others, mask up"" ""turns I'm safe I'm selfish asshole"" camp right now. Yes, someone immunocompromised higher risk literally every disease, case highly communicable diseases covid, vaccines. everyone around immunocompromised person vaccinated, protects person. Vaccinating infectious disease group effort takes us, even young healthy, protect vulnerable. recommend going replies. lots good information. area everyone took masks long time ago cause fully vaccinated... week 2 cases... whole week... Vaccines work. live texas literally 95% people dont, even store requires it. Employees dont even bother asking people put one trouble worth. Personally, whether store requires it, im going keep wearing mine get green light covid over. Damn dude. Never ran people ever thankfully. Sorry hear morons this. :( fate Israel’s COVID-19 crisis rests happens Ben-Gurion Airport, coronavirus testing take two hours results may never arrive. checked; wow. That’s actually astonishing. deaths still way, way down. completely understand urge prevent new variants, point toothless mask mandates suffice. We’ve either got acknowledge virus endemic now, start actually making consequences unvaccinated  makes sound like neck bearded basement dweller.

And guy lecturing someone polite issue giving insults complete strangers. every day new topics people want discuss. make harder find answers questions others before, best format we've got. can't let sub overrun text posts. would make sub unreadable imo. personally really see daily discussion unreadable. functioned well last 18 months. option allow text posts again, that's something we're willing previously mentioned reasons. Sorry that's something really want. talk want here. like format, plenty region specific subs discuss things well, local issues discussed might otherwise buried worldwide sub, admittedly US centric. Rural Missouri low vaccination rate surge delta expected somewhat (as much possible). well spread .. I'm pretty sure wrote immunocompromised people fully protected. list I'm guessing. know list. EDs country fire Delta COVID started hit. We’re holding psychs admits, trying care ED patients. top PCPs sending people ED absolute BS, using covid excuse. 

Many us losing love emergency medicine. Docs nurses alike.  Let go move across country real quick… sure hell am! first time decade I've got health insurance thanks government subsidies available right now. 2021... hoooooo boy stuff skyrocket means. I'm paying $61/mo platinum HMO right now. I'm really excited getting tests make sure dying 10 years, January, health insurance marketplace says I'll pay $250/mo cheapest bronze level package *terrible* premiums, drug costs, deductibles! Like... FIRST WORLD COUNTRY?!?! First decision solely science. thought would increase vaccinations, hasnt. Second, 90% 95% 88 90% going go delta variant spreads vaccinations stay flat. wondering else counted list. Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands, Washington DC. Hospitals need lot companies doing, cut middle managers. todays technology, sre useless. Maybe parents need groceries childcare? adults would mask indoors would safe kids also spaces. 

Also, everyone else get go back normal without masks kids can't even go places masked adults selfish fuck can't wait take masks indoors everyone needs vaccination access? kids traumatic year+ would also like feel fucking normal able go places. But, adults like woohoo can't fucked wear masks, kids go back full lockdown like beginning pandemic? Cool. 

Like seriously? fucking compassion.  Genuinely wondering how? HSE sign portal open people aged 35 over? manners healthcare system, particular lack access good mental health care.

My mom severe form mental illness things always manifest obvious way. Sometimes could come bring unreasonably surly someone deserve it. 

When Americans think healthcare system imagine homeless people schizophrenia. lack creates lead people less severe illness wreaking havoc.

And sort behavior becomes normalized, like see Florida. R 6+ virus floating around read study. It’s linked page shared.

Data study, including longer term safety, comprehensive information duration protection, efficacy asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, safety immunogenicity adolescents 12 15 years age gathered months ahead. Additional studies planned evaluate BNT162b2 pregnant women, children younger 12 years, special risk groups, immunocompromised.

How think looked asymptomatic infections without surveillance testing? (They couldn’t!)

Read quote gave context: none things studied. 12-15 year olds? Another trial. Immunocompromised? Excluded trial. Duration protection? studied. on. absolutely look asymptomatic infection.

It exhausting work you. look done yourself. Dude, you’d read thread you’d see lie, rather mistake publicly acknowledged, also fall within southern stereotype group concerned about. currently can't vaccinate kids COVID-19. Obviously risk calculus change can. diseases LOT dangerous unvaccinated kids covid.


Risk start contract disease, includes probability getting infected first place. COVID far widespread infectious diseases mentioned, pushes risk up. 12. 


What basing on? data I've seen support claim, even close. I've never felt need wear masks flu season.


We vaccine flu children take. Again, different calculus. got J&amp;J vaccine March bc available quickest area, really paid attention developments since. I'm seeing stuff Delta variant transmissible J&amp;J less efficacious it. 

I travel country fall. get one mRNA vaccines top vax already have? overkill news sensationalizing things?  probably table people interested in.

99% mRNA recipients antibody positive 1 dose. 65% CoronaVac recipients antibody positive 1 dose.

At 2 doses, mRNA 100% CoronaVac 99%.

Antibody levels (U/mL) one dose: CoronaVac 9.6, mRNA 104.2

Antibody levels (U/mL) two doses: CoronaVac 141.7, mRNA 244.1 Reading article, become traveling nurse? Seems like better option. dont think annual flu shot protection covid vaccines tho, right?  50% effective? Interesting saw study stating spread, possible, reduced 50%+ households. Ill find it. Dude. Don’t believe everything read internet. Lol. Everything g sensationalized dramatized. kind society live take Redditors word it? Come bro, open up. [Here’s current list named That's science works. Good lord, got kidding... Interestingly, opinion also opinion CDC. Now, I'm telling anyone wear mask (if vaccinated ; not, wear fucking mask!). wear mask inside. However, 100% understand vaccinated people wearing mask.  thing happen Mom (retired RN)! called h cocky know-it-all keeps changing story. believe it. leave room.  experience, alright. 94% symptomatic asymptomatic cases much like 79% Delta variant. well 5 takes. know, LA enough jerks ruin everyone. Get vaccinated folks. i’m tired paraded around like know long term effects are. yeah fatality rate low children. fucking what. didn’t know link pandemrix narcolepsy back day either guess what, use vaccine. i’m concerned kids dying covid. i’m concerned 40 oh shit, got vaccinated child shit happening.

See works? Things cost, let children childhood jesus christ. flu isn’t airborne. Masks don’t work nearly well flu. That’s scientists assumed initially weren’t effective covid. 

Closing offices, limiting social contact, staying home sick etc. bigger reasons really reduced flu year. Yes, actual target death rate would made lot sense.

Also, CDC recommends masks due delta variant? gonna ignore convenient? STILL less risky are, think still vaccinating kids diseases? risk profile covid ages 18, one would know covid exists one would bother make vaccine it.


This makes sense. choose bother making COVID vaccine children - *actively testing* whether existing vaccines safe children *can* give them. bro


No u. 


You made initial claim, already asked data provided it, looking like someone worth taking time find studies me. Sounds rational responsibly adult. Sigh. I’m still wearing mask indoors unless I’m eating restaurant. probably negates mask measures take iono. No, didn't. Feel free go back read. 

Don't bother, though, already made clear think smarter experts. point arguing you. agree w/ you, w/ greater spread there's greater chance come contact COVID. increases risk 1 20 vaccinated still end getting infected. 
 
There's pre-print today, discussed science sub /r/COVID19, shows Delta produces greater titres ultimately leads infected people, particularly unvaccinated people, shedding virus air. explosion talk already well underway! Honest question: many people insist shopping person pandemic? Grocery delivery 2 dollars week. Pickup free. feel like people idea clubs bars dangerous grocery stores okay because.... reasons. Makes sense. I’ll continue wear mask long please. I’d rather get dirty looks anti-maskers believe I’m one them. live Ohio, it’s pretty politically divided “red”. ones given shit wearing mask yet, got back grocery store hour ago - wearing mask indoors. Bullies everywhere. tend single pick people aren’t 6’5” angry-looking 🤷‍♂️. got first dose, knows I'll get second... Seriously. unvaccinated people point. problem anymore. think that, good point. reading comments last two days thinking man general opinion changes black white really quickly. Well we’re fucked Az. one grocery store mask yesterday. Corona Virus over. Get vax move on… Right. really good point whenever people mention ""Delta Plus"" something worse horizon. Likely not. ""Plus"" mutations help evade neutralization more, they're similar Beta variant seems spread well. think Pfizer vaccine got different times. husband healthcare workers got back December. far he's perfectly fine symptoms mild. positive sister got second dose March, mom got second dose April. step-dad unvaccinated worst symptoms. Everything said absolutely right. keep mind kids 12 cannot vaccinated, delta variant spreads quickly 100% sure much reduction effectiveness vaccines toward variant.

So caution warranted. Wearing mask crowded store mild inconvenience, hard see makes sense least children ability get vaccinated. areas high vaccination rates also areas likely still wearing masks mind wearing mask comes recommendations, think that's part picture. think sub mass pro-vaccine anti-mask people. People voted elite touch donkeys surprised bend rules suit agendas. hope people wake next time general election, although doubt based May local elections. Yeah fuck noise. wanna live they’ll go get free shot. die, fuck em. chance. high risk 30 unable get Pfizer. benefits way outweighed risks. I’m saying covid isn’t responsible Dr Bronners smelling like burnt rubber someone used soap 7 years, attest gets exposed swings temperature starts smell like rubber. exclusively use baby unscented reason lavender others I’ve tried start smell weird sitting shower awhile. winter especially get cold next window warm hot shower. good news least person miserable sack scan items every day rest life actual skills usefulness. least go bed rest easy knowing life full depressive monotony can't even fathom.   We'll see. Cases currently increasing exponentially. Even 50% people vaccinated, would expect see hospitalizations deaths rise next weeks, even among vaccinated (there still small minority breakthrough infections, since life going ""back normal"" small percentage still fairly large number current rate increase. pretty simple: cities always much higher bar ""safety"" anywhere else people, average people traveling far away, higher population density contribute fast spread disease. great paper came Nature Urban Sustainability: 

So much people complain red rural counties low vaccination rates, vaccination rates might actually enough keep reproduction rate zero places, cities much higher burden prevent spread. Well don’t see people outside masks. I’ll agree that. really necessary outside? think not. Getting first vaccine smart. excellent vaccine shown UK data. pretty much feel. really care wearing mask places required seems like things getting fucked live I'll wear one protect others I'm done staying inside me, family, friends fully vaccinated. Weird. see people masks time.  I’m vaccinated don’t wear mask unless business mandates it. Frustrating it’s assumed “anti-masker” literally everything required me. There's massive gap doomsday awareness. People want COVID even vaccines protect them. CDC dropped mask mandate right period breakouts. audacity. Lower risk groups, absolute level risk kids COVID, especially delta variant, many things take precautions for

Can quantify that? I'm seeing it. 1. might people can't vaccinated, always case disease wear masks those
2. case virus wear masks them
3. return normal state point can't expect everyone wear masks Yeah. Read article. propaganda. take total number cases since beginning pandemic, VACCINE, use number base percentage on. deceptive thing I've ever seen life.

In article admits CDC longer counting breakthrough cases.

In England, places, actually counting data, seeing 50/50. think point encourage vaccinations. think CDC knew unvaccinated idiots would take advantage situation fundamentally really hurt also vaccinated. Oh yeah, clear I’m using 0.4% 4% baseline cohort based Cleveland Clinic’s risk assessment tool may even err high side. 

It’s somewhat sobering good way realize risk hospitalization vaccine near 0.04% least closer 0.4% way far removed 4%. 1. Masks *do* protect COVID. cloth mask perfect protection, *does* reduce viral load. also protects *others* well, reduces air pressure viral cloud. cloth mask that's 40% effective, that's 40% less viral load. several studies shown size initial viral load effects severe infection is.

2. N95 KN95 masks easy get now. ordered pack 10 $5. Overkill vaccinated (which am), fully accept I'm paranoid. paranoid like easily protect COVID. yes, that's following science, tested NIOSH 98%+ effective. Good thing heat kills it. It'll gone Easter Exactly. like article pointing ""COVID may indirectly cause loss brain tissue"" people responding ""Ha! See? COVID *directly* causing it. Enough fear mongering, please!"" No, protect immunocompromised unable get vaccinated. I’m hoping community transmission low enough stopped. Australia difficult strategy maintain transmissibility increases people get tired measures. Thank this. go store constantly see kids 12 unmasked. supposed able take mask vaccinated, younger kids obviously not. lot parents care though. Anytime go public chance encountering immunocompromised people. claim completely unverifiable. Right now. continual contact vaccinated increase risk strain mutating weaken effectiveness vaccine? Read article -- probably think. Case 0 fully Pfizer-vax'd woman also untreated HIV. spite vax, became massive variant incubator Pfizer held check condition. Scary actually. type shots good giving out... actually several articles recently antivax groups targeting minorities message. know many antivax posts I've seen relating covid vaccine Tuskegee experiment. seems vaxx even work new strain. I'm going mask stay f away people post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Ah, yes... /r/badeconomics rich enough.

Acquire exemptions rules. Problem is, admins paid keep people's salaries low can. don’t supply. vaccinating oldest youngest 30-39yo minute. Vaccine uptake really high here.  Eh, choice. wonder they'll react one day businesses stop allowing masks altogether. people likely get infected delta least likely masking  Sounds like punch line whose line anyway. Delta Shmelta. inferior measures possibly superior. Whatever differences, real use data shows widely used vaccines UK equally effective preventing disease. λ - discover variant black mesa research facility?  Wish could US. everyone damn entitled. I’m perfect, damn people really suck. Feels like “real world data” trial cdc continues figure much asymptomatic, fully-vaxxed spreading it.

From updated CDC site morning:

“A growing body evidence indicates people fully vaccinated mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna) less likely asymptomatic infection transmit SARS-CoV-2 others. Studies underway learn benefits Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen vaccine. However, risk SARS-CoV-2 infection fully vaccinated people cannot completely eliminated long continued community transmission virus.”

With known potential maskless vaxxed spread it, seems like confusion inevitable. 

I think lot public wanting told do, consider.

Rhetorical Q’s:

Did know lot unvaccinated going maskless privacy laws?

Did know CDC still studying asymptomatic spread amongst maskless fully-vaxxed?

Studies last summer even suggest masks alone efficacious vaccines alone. (But best, cases fell sharpest vaccine rollout mask mandate tact) surges tied reopening businesses, protests

It seems the, “get shot &amp; ditch protocols” strategy reckless, dishonest continue understand transmission Finally! Pfizer moderna 5-10% less effective delta overall still really good protecting severe illness death. long otherwise healthy you’re almost certainly fine. multiple trials different age groups different start end dates. Also, trial end date trial data ready interim full analysis. words, trial may list end date spring '22 trial data begin analyzed months earlier. I’m sorry. really laugh comment! 😂. sounds like something would got ticked enough someone yelling ITT: Everyone dog providing anecdotal observations many people masking (or not) live. surprise surprise, turns mask usage percentage board 0% 100% depending going. 
 
That said, I'm going masking default indoors (and taking precautions) going forward, while.  
 
Like people here, vaccinated Spring. took vacation end May, visiting various sites along Oregon Trail Missouri Wyoming (mostly outdoor sites). Mask usage nearly every place visited eleven days next-to-zero, wearing mask, either.  
 
I worried COVID. instead, managed catch pretty bad cold process. Classic head cold symptoms, first time I've ill year, luck.  
 
Betchya wearing mask (and taking related precautions, like diligent hand-washing distancing) caught cold :) 
 
So, least, I'll wearing mask, COVID, also protect nasty bugs could well. Getting sick *any* reason sucks. gotten used getting various minor colds throughout life fact life, spent last year-plus without getting sniffles cough someone work kinda put new perspective. I'd rather remain healthy default (COVID otherwise), masking is. long behavior lasts remains determined (hard imagine permanent change), knows? symptoms, vaccine not, contagious. COVID germs you’re spewing might severely weakened crippled, doesn’t take much infect infant chemo patient. Everyone around you, maybe? Omg way! I’m *so* shocked!! Hard pause think dead. realize wearing mask protecting too, right?
It certainly iron defense, lower chances catching COVID. vaccines amazing, gurantee get sick.

And Delta Variant spreading rapidly US, wearing mask foreseeable future even though I've vaccinated since March. Cool story Correct I’m wrong, Pfizer vaccine protect variants COVID since protects spike protein (which have), right? comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  ridiculous comparison make. Australia sitting paltry 5% pop fully vaccinated, they've also taken different strategy lockdowns vs. countries entire pandemic, i.e., aiming zero cases vs overloading healthcare systems. pretty successful stemming spread early on. mean, number really small. 150,000,000 people fully vaccinated right now. That’s 0.0027% chance getting hospitalized dying. really slim none.

I say, however, count Delta. it’s hard say number accurate Delta variant. Snark aside, most, masks become seasonal and/or when-sick situation, never become all-the-time accessory. human beings enjoy sense emotional attachment engagement social settings, also lot businesses eventually want security reasons. main point vaccine reduce lethality virus. Herd immunity great byproduct helps reach goal.  There’s phase 3 underway GSK, RSV super famous vaccine flameouts.

Damn near destroyed NovaVax. Nanoflu COVID vaccine didn’t succeed, NovaVax almost certain fold still transmit

We can't. viral load get get virus small pass anyone else basically getting vaccines amount virus system... passing GOOD THING... old vaccines 10+ years ago made dead viruses small amounts viruses that's basically spreading unvaccinated people spread people. Asymptomatic carrier

So? Asymptomatic means symptoms cares? Yeah us probably carry virus said matter cause can't transmit it... virus catch makes immune system even better... keeping mask makes easier mutation actually hurt you... virus system right full vaccination fought immune system strengthening even whatever comes way later... wearing mask help Healthcare community upset

There's lot healthcare community get vaccine... ones upset... ones actually believe virus scary

You fully vaccinated would scared? problem news scaring people taking vaccine cause even vaccinated people wear masks again. don't. Unless immunocompromised need scared version virus.  I'm one ever see mask Texas I'm fully vaccinated pregnant. absolutely fucking hate living Texas. Dang. Seems like (too much) mayonnaise harmful one’s body one’s face - getting hit verbally abused elderly people   modeling I'm referring to. smarter people give good reasons optimism pesimismo thread. tend towards latter I'm well educated hard know. seeing bad case rates feeling demoralized. 40% Nebraska adults living rural areas fully vaccinated, compared 60% living state’s metro What? Uh no.

The *advisory committee* never said recommend EUA, even take unofficial vote it, even scenario split it, mean FDA disagree case proceed granting EUA given age group. trials done reason. Anyone rushing judgment prior seeing trial data understand even basic principles risk/benefit analysis.

Mind you, still fully understood pathology disease, lest think reasonable subject kids highly contagious variant could potentially result damage brain tissue. benefit avoiding vs risk vaccine related complications needs weighed. Delta begin rising several states, quite premature assuming EUA dead water now, trials completed fall still months away. Thank you. waiting variant like determine vaccine get. vaccine would get? form restrictions vaccinated? us."
