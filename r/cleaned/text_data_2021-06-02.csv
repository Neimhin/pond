0,2021-06-02," Doesnt seem like people underestimate easy thing spreads. kind comparison useless. area hit badly U.K. was, maybe haven’t seen first hand effects Covid, aren’t aware worried Covid death. 

As someone living London, it’s estimated 1/4 population Covid total, know quite people age 20-40 hospitalised and/or suffered long term side effects. Stuff like constant brain fog, hair falling out, inability exercise, months end.

The risks associated vaccine statistically far, far lower risks associated Covid. adult age group. That’s facts. New COVID-19 variants highly transmissible, Dr Bloomfield reporting index case Victoria's current outbreak caught virus window 18 seconds.

What?? Damn. UK vaccines per capita Canada. took strategy Canada would people first doses. Instead chose give people second doses. can't figure vaccination rates stated CDC tally what's reported respective state's Covid dashboards. State reported figures seem lower across board. Anyone clue that's case? GIVE MINE ALREADY! 

I'm 18, have, like, 2 months get first jab? People downvoting know situation India is, denial. plenty time prepared, August 2020, Modi announced 'Vaccine Rollout plan ready'

&amp;#x200B;

Vaccines available adults India *in theory*. practically, able book slot vaccination next impossible. vaccine drive slowly ramping now, doubt could achieved far higher rate vaccination prepared Although agree tone changed, article light science instead repeating oft incorrect trope ""just wait two weeks"".

It became almost rallying cry people trying justify restrictions, regardless science saying. easier live alone. :( *starts looking mountains hike downtown Toronto*

Anything else change life make pleasing you, oh Internet stranger? Briefs boxers? ""Mom"" bicep barbed wire tattoo around arm? name firstborn? Teach me, oh wise one, game life. I'd vaccination since Tetanus booster 1991 (according NHS app data), amazed barely felt anything all. cats claws jumping lap. Ok. Explains CO still highest 7-day case rate per 100k *shocked Pikachu face* Buzzfeed news FOIA'd bunch Fauci's private emails Jan-June 2020 one sub discussing real substance emails? Mainly scientists, conspiracy theorists, telling virus could engineered? everything political. 

I don’t care Fauci, overall think great job, I’m pretty pissed incompetence China likely letting virus leak, governments institutions around world lying us hardly possibility engineered.

This straw break camels back real global sanctions China. money talks nothing probably happen. Flu transmits differently coronavirus. Best protection flu hand washing/avoiding surfaces others touched. believe it’s called ‘formites.’  Coronavirus transits primarily aerosols, contact surfaces. Kinda like smoke. ventilation key corona, hand washing flu. True. issue one dose much Indian variant (the variant that's currently causing rise cases there) people protected. Got - nobody live WW2 complain anything ever again. Thanks clarifying! I..I see there.... Not. Everyone. Is. So. Introverted.

Are seriously incapable understanding there's one type personality? (Which means terrible empathy therefore fully human, based definitions.) trolling me? bother replying - post another ""holier thou"" thing, I'll block without reading it. US globally?

I live New England we're essentially back normal. stores still recommending masks, % people still wearing already dropped lot since state updated policy. September going thing past. tell conservatives that. explain Canadian think Cuomo's really like? remember NY covid surge, least giving serious daily briefings pandemic, breath fresh air compared Trump. Also getting flu shot reduces severity flu get it. People also mistake cold flu. it’s over… remember.. it’ll late. Elections run state won’t fair free anymore. work started long time ago. you’re aware suggest inform yourself. Wait till UK Canada open eligibility 18-30 age group. see countries ultimately reaching 80-90% population, eligibility questionnaire says I’m “not current phase”. 

And it’s opaque confusing. bet lot people assuming they’re eligible someone tell if/when are. realising actually book appointment go. 11% (15 million+) visitors EU US. Mostly (6 million) Italy, France Germany. many informal system. thinks flu kills 600k people US every year? still boggles mind people would play Russian roulette life/health like that.  tell that’s cuz less people seeing need get tested - probably vaccinated , virus spread slower (positivity rate low ). good point, guess we'll find next week fluke *cries Australian* Wondering see little rebound since holiday weekend. Lots people traveling want get shot around time shows vaccines potential completely shut virus practical purposes enough people get vaccinated. plenty politicians pushing alternative medicine too.

There difference politicians pushing government officially supporting name culture heritage. mean efficacy 97%? yea thats kinda bonus massive economy, diversified even tho hospitality tourism got smashed, everything else largely fine. that, due taxes, california ended $76 billion budget surplus, states lost billions tax revenue explain this. British voted Prime Minister wanted inject Covid live TV people dying prove hoax voted Brexit. Italy made mistakes hit hard early new virus world still trying make sense it.

The reality Britain currently reaping sowed. here.

Coasted couple decades without major colds flu.

Got flu one year bad remind bad could be. 
Been getting flu shot ever since. Sorry hear that! PATHETIC! Step number one nation! 12 50 good enough Yes bring bag :) Yay! free gas instead post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Pretty sure multiple companies paid lot try that. sort doubt get done time still matters though... guess based things normally go How’s France doing? I’m moving school September wondering restrictions (if any) then? absolutely expensive understand agree upset expense, want see expensive look quarantine hotels Red list countries cost. Vaccine hesitancy India high. 2/3rds doctors vaccinated far spite exclusive vaccinations 1 month. vaccine hesitancy amongst doctors delayed vaccine uptake new orders govt wondered needed spend 10 billion dollars given poor India is.

At start vaccination program 40% doctors offered shots took it. really didn't. Anyone paying attention knew Cuomo piece shit mishandled pandemic start.

The fact people actually fooled fucking depressing.

And say total idiot. known long time, asymptomatic spread fake? That's news me. source posted said 59% transmission comes asymptomatic presymptomatic COVID patients, dated Jan 2021.

Maybe ""boost"" wrong choice words, really meant one way another, immune system fights virus, vaccinated not. understand vaccine make vaccinated asymptomatic individuals less likely spread unvaccinated asymptomatic individuals, apparently asymptomatic spread happen all.  everyone feel travel? We're booked flights Paris late September I'm kind anxious mostly feeling okay. home (NYC) things almost completely back normal us. feel bad Hawaii.I assume culture Polynesian? Maybe 2029-2035 best goal could end long aids currently is. heard someone talking experience finding cure similar aids. Currently anyone 18.  would go cruise willingly without vaccinated and/or knowing others board havent vaccinated...couldnt Weird... reactions people allergic peanuts?

Either way least one dose get significant immunity. surprised got first dose 2 weeks ago nurse said 92% effective 2 weeks. figure even that's using different measure 95% figures see thrown about, that's pretty great. question, fully vaccinated donate blood. antibodies potentially pass donation recipient? mean anything friend fine indoors without masks period time want. per cdc. got vaccine, get sick anyway. Maybe go 2030 cure found (similar AIDS) “To report suspicious activity involving fake vaccination record cards, please contact appropriate government agency state jurisdiction, call HHS-OIG 1-800-HHS-TIPS visit Internet Crime Complaint Center online www.ic3.gov.” younger (27) co-worker basically said won’t get vaccine “there’s much conflicting information” since beginning. fully vaccinated still wear mask - something loves “call out” literally every time around other. 

We forced small conference room together several minutes couple weeks ago. next day, out. week that. Mid way next week, still wasn’t back asked was, since wasn’t showing requested vacation, etc. 

Turns out, covid time room together. symptomatic, work, really hit day room together. 100% exposed never showed symptoms - attribute fully vaccinated still ardently wearing mask around non-vaccinated people. 

He mild case, according him, also made clear doesn’t plan vax “it wasn’t bad”. I’ve simply even stopped trying people. Vaccination shots specifically, bird shot... ""...but saying since beggin-""

""I SAID NOTHING COULD IT""  Oh, that's awesome. I'm new Canada, looks like I'll binge TPB now. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. waa looking state's health department website, super unclear. There's info filing complaints sorts things specific situation. Minnesota two things going it: summer-like weather one higher vaccination rates country. surprising. elaborate that, Missouri 42.12% population partially vaccinated, 34.30% fully vaccinated less 10,000 vaccines administered last 2 days.

This unfortunate sad, especially look statistics cases deaths changed since beginning March.

Meanwhile states 50% vaccine rates, cases plummeted lowest ages 0 deaths areas.

Missouri (42.12% partial,34.30% fully): York ( 56.05% partial vax, 47.23% fully vaxxed):  shout Germany! country BioNtech developed first m-rna vaccine. Pfizer perfect partner. Thank both! Go live woods then. We've got Philly Pittsburgh 300 miles barbarian lands holds 10% population picks 60% reps.  safe hang friend us unmasked indoors? fully vaccinated hung indoors twice far nothing happened masked.

My apologies asking current situation seems volatile like things could get back horrible day due lack people taking shots. want pay less taxes  I've couple reactions it. one case, think must sensed coming something, getting flu shot came mind. completely harmless, correct first shot carries biggest risk.

The risk UK AstraZeneca vaccine blood clot observed 1:118k, specifically 1:90k first dose, 1:120k second dose. Bankrupt medical bills. Stupidity isn’t cheap would argue emotional type dangerous susceptible act violently things go way (ex : January 6th)... King County, 75% residents 16 years age older received one dose, 63% fully vaccinated.

Assuming unvaccinated includes also got one shot, point efficacy \~98%. Probably herd effects play though. Again, got number exact conversion euros dollars, bad, figure time pay hotel ten day quarantine, food, transport, $1000. tourist, find intimidating hunt cheaper test options, knowing find places would staying, go general. joke. ""Okay heart, keep beating! it!"" really understand anyone could die flu; it, easy imagine would happened it'd frailer. Wtf love sours. specifically, lambic style, sort subset type. guess understand know infected vaccinated people spread disease unvaccinated people. know people work medical facilities around who've told employees patients going required wear masks regardless vaccination status least rest year, I've also heard Pfizer requiring employees facility same. exactly inspire confidence, especially CDC's statements whether vaccine stop transmission kind tepid, i.e., heard anyone flat say ""yes confident vaccinated people spread COVID"". can't derive efficacy, two populations self selecting. comparing vaccinated vs unvaccinated. comparing people CHOSE vaccinated vs people chose be. confounding variables like risk tolerance behavior likely different. % population vaccinated? easy estimate efficacy What’s like able see sounds?

Yup, housemate works disability took client (down syndrome) get vaccinated. Client it, freaked needle relax etc. Housemate got vaccine though eligible carer. (Australia) *Oh no...* 
*Anyway!* would love able around vaccinated people. Unfortunately, everyone opportunity. also decent sized Hispanic population work farms meat packing plants, terribly trusting government. know that's thing generally, conditions make people unable get covid vaccine? They're even attenuated virus poor enough immune system could get sick. Allergies might restrict ones available basically vaccine everybody? Lol case me. got covid even vaccine. I’m unlucky person :( advice is, look needle all. go in, answer questions, make conversation person administering shot like guy can't shut distract true kind imply people develop symptoms spreading disease?

This known long vaccine boosts immune system point fight virus better different people whose immune systems strong enough fight vaccine?

[No, boost. training, priming, preparing.

I'd rather walk field 80% safe, 20% clearly labeled danger zones, field 95% safe held completely unlabeled land mines. everyone? Doubt typo hear lot living Ontario, believe trailer park boys started way back whem Sucks want vaccine, can't get medical reasons... I'd bet real world breakthrough infections common clinical trials suggest.

You consider even people took virus seriously start resuming normal life getting fully vaccinated. Even people know isolated year started hanging friends, going restaurants vaccinated. 

Real life like clinical trials blind 50-50 chance getting placebo therefore can't really start living differently. post r/MapsWithoutHawaii . Get Extra Strength Tylenol case get fever day Covid vaccine shot.  know fully approved. 

Honestly, I'd love see insurance companies cover covid hospitalizations people vaccine (unless medical condition something). I'm sat watching US pissed hell. I'm 29, I'm actually allowed get vaccine yet. Whereas twatbags USA available every adult turning turning up? Fekk people. clearly want badly. Hannibal Lecter. much longer. may updated week, per time stamp: ""Posted: June 2, 2021 8:16 PM ET"" effective give 1 dose 60% people give two doses 30% Shhh, shh... *they* get *their* free beer, free donut entry lottery. ***/s***  ill allow nearly 2 Billion worldwide!

If accurate, would used ""variant"".   state state worldometers right? I've gotten arguments bunch idiots maybe around December this. tried tell said something first mean that's keep doing....as got new information he'd tell us better things do. NO, contradict whatever says trump tucker asshats told it'll mean they're tough oppose ""weak"" libs....and thus got 500,000 dead. Dumb AF. extremely suggestive aerosols play important role flu transmission. 

You probably still want wash hands mindful good ventilation probably better flu prevention.  don’t think rich people volunteer get vaccine lol  never know, I'm mindset said ""Hey everyone, really using better masks"" ton people would go ""see, masks worthless"" wear nothing. people ""love"" CDC probably independent research buying KN95 is. Agree disagree public reaction guess. So...is speculation, everyone wondering things like that?

I saw snippets emails, sounded like responses disgruntled employee who's constantly stepped allowed job properly. could also see face he'd trump administration tv vs biden's. Beaten vs. active hopeful. correct though can’t say you’ve never contact covid. absolutely cannot make assumption unless live bunker haven’t met anyone 2 ish years. option choose door. reality go one them. argument covid isn’t issue still selfish. don’t get vaccine you, it’s fir everyone else well since get covid without symptoms, never know it, still pass someone else. Dude’s conservative troll. Ignore him. Lol next time admit you’re irrationally afraid covid even taking amazingly effective vaccine. falling allergy excuse Probably involves ""underage women"" a/k/a girls. using AstraZeneca various vaccines? I've tried ""Schadenfreude"" ""Bazillion"" reading Trump rally I'm sure. authoritarianism bit we?   certain part population, yes, people love CDC would follow whatever said. think messed saying cloth masks ""good enough"" regular people need anything that. could least recommended people wear better masks protection choose so. 

I mean pretty much Fauci back January said people could wear two masks protection. would gone straight recommending N95s/KN95s instead idea wearing two masks kind silly dumb, opinion. Absolutely. Great plan. place people firearms.
 
I think fantastic idea.

King County basically solely responsible Democrat gets elected, left leaning policy gets passed. Incredible! many words work for? Sure is.

Throwing caution There’s reason walking around mask. 

Downplaying mask you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.” refuse?

Do lack ability read analyze scientific papers? lack critical thinking skills?

I'm honestly asking; understand.  Something similar happened New Zealand before: going limb here, B1617 appears transmissible; several clusters newest wave infections Singapore linked Delta variant (B16172), like Changi Airport cluster (108 cases) Tan Tock Seng Hospital cluster (48 cases). Cases one more, JEM/Westgate shopping centre cluster (50 cases) tested preliminarily positive B1617. 

It's bit concerning several possible index cases fully vaccinated; additionally, case JEM/Westgate cluster, possible index case visited one shopping centres - Westgate - single day (May 6) testing positive following day subsequently sent hospital. accurate truthful downplaying it. vaccines wonderful. truthful. 

They incredible. lie great. Practically almost. I'm vaccinated.  vaccine basically work people immunosuppressive drugs organ transplants. buddy donor kidney got Pfizer 1&amp;2, antibody test came back negative. docs want try additional doses maybe J&amp;J basically guarantees. know getting downvoted, like exist.

HOLY CRAP. Guess I'll try calling number Lol joke *on many turned vaccine could 3 weeks ago

Some people cant get it, Im still people's team. lived Houston Dec. 2019 week ago jive anecdotal experience. start, nightlife full swing entire time Houston - clubs/bars reopened officially early fall packed, almost pre-pandemic level partying ongoing Winter 2020. Masking limited venues. We're talking dozens upon dozens super spreader events occurring every individual Wednesday, Thursday, friday, Saturday Sunday (and Tuesdays - thanks Industry nights!) months end heart 3rd wave.

Masking businesses always relatively higher, varied, governor's mandate dropped March variation grew. Anti-mask sentiment Texas strong anti-maskers quite numerous, green light many. 

I even get many private parties/pregames/post-games. 

All social gatherings far less frequent places like NY MA.

I living Downtown Houston, going mostly normal spots Houstonian would go to. know Austin significantly shut 2020 Houston (although roared back life governor dropped state mandate March).

TL;DR: Texas largely controlled pandemic, anecdotal experience would indicate success linked high compliance CDC guidelines re: masking mitigation measures. Indeed, Texans moving quite opposite direction entire time. They've done bare minimum (masking Walmart Costco time), pretty much nothing else (many social gatherings indoors maskless, less distancing, etc). think Dr Cox?  17 play fire taste flame... says they're looking removing mask mandate June 11th downward curve sustains 

Which bit late, least plan remove there.   mean...yeah?

This in, water appears wet. 11. interesting:

*""Israel “punished” children vectors infection, situation country today proves never were, said Calderon-Margalit.* 
*There hardly reported COVID-19 cases among kids now, even though vaccination under-16s hasn’t yet begun, even though classrooms perfect environment viruses spread""* sounds like bit strange solution. really impossible give doses Canada administer Windsor area? Large swaths country already back pre-covid normal save people choosing wear masks they're either unvaccinated feel like it. I'm fully vaccinated worn mask thought physical distancing since 17th, last shift worked company told vaccinated employees could remove them.

If get 80% fully vaccinated herd immunity outbreaks among unvaccinated small spread far, would tolerate that. annual covid season 500 dead (our normal annual flu death rate), nearly antivaxxers, would even acceptable. even keeping low requires get large majority vaccinated. Im curious know sick covid catching doses. say bad coughing fit 2 weeks I've bad colds I've cough weeks hard guage. Would consider illness mild? important people understand still catch covid (rarely) even receiving shots. going much milder case keep hospitalized.  killing somewhere 20 50 million people. feel stealing? Vaccinated got it, I'm 14 days still struggling. day 5 thought deathbed. breathe swimming sweat. ""everyone vaccinated"" it? Make mind up. girl college went deep saw today posting videos random doctor tiktok. kid born severely premature multiple complications born couple years ago. He's largest risk getting actively spreading propaganda dont give shit unvaccinated people choosing put risk

Is tragic? course, mean sarifice freedom others make bad choices? No.

McDonalds unhealthy shit, ban McDonalds many people make health risk- reward decision eat there? seen expert claim everyone vaccinated way.

There however seem disagreement ideal percentage.  Would government really let people hold everybody else hostage? that's good thing.

But, still miserable verge dialing 9-1-1 several times breathe. tested positive 24th I'm still coughing every 3-5 minutes.  great know!

It's rocket appliances 

Two birds stoned once

You correct intentional people dumb hell answer problem! Fuck  guess Germans allow fairly long timespan first second shot, fully vaccinated 18% population. 

This interesting strategy. wonder allow Germany reach herd immunity faster neighboring states. live vaccinated county US (we're like 87%), hit yellow tier week small pocket people take vaccine keep sneezing other's mouths apparently, every day get 6 new cases, much according state's framework.

we also incredibly vax-friendly county (which **not** case years ago). know what? county releases infection vaccine rate zip code, know it, tiny, tiny area faintest not-vax-friendly hint responsible holding us back since end March, per data. Well unvaccinated either chose get vaccinated, kids young get vaccinated. 70% adults (at least partially) vaccinated, 57% total population (at least partially) vaccinated.

""They"" may confused two statistics.

Sources:
[cdc better (select: state &amp; california lower left menu) that, talking globally? New Zealand they've elimated virus many times before, vaccine able open countries like usa, Israel, countries low covid rates happened posted today's WA dashboard update:

and would make Fox News anything american 80 years old coworker? I'm sure polls accurate, vaccine hesitancy lot countries decreased they've known people who've vaccinated.

Right now, looks like ""get vaccinated, open borders"" lots people care that. However, transmissible strain inside country and/or real perceived risk opening borders, people become scared virus, less scared vaccine, currently are.

Especially if, time vaccination widespread NZ, open over-12s, would expect 80% population coverage easily achievable, although probably quite enough herd immunity. Also, general, people likely get tested people likely get vaccinated asap.

So even surge mild-moderate cases, we're less likely hear it. I’ve 7 cruises never got sick. definitely me. desire ever go another cruise, even someone treated me. It’s great people like them, everyone Drive thru best  dunno man, believe would was. fuck talking   high proportion two subs would expect people like from. r/CoronavirusUK, mods found proof brigading things happening. Yeah sorry boring now, fucking get grip, go get jabbed that's it, move life guarantee vaccine time need needle whole life put life risking anesthetic everytime need single needle, I'd get used that. actually understand put body? would seriously look risks asking take avoid awake tiny tiny needle arm. Anesthesia kill you. That's doctors put under, risks outweigh benefits. c-section still kept awake cut baby stomach risks anesthesia needed compared kept awake, think entitled put sleep 1 second jab? Honestly that's crazy get it.  Runny noses definitely Covid symptom. We've known year point. would admit it’s irrelevant current problem? mean... you’re right nobody discussing 10 years ago shows low case numbers important even vaccination. Prices might changed since last time traveled, smarty pants. That’s paid, nearly went broke able fly close am. Unbelievable stuff People don’t know enough phobias work likely because

A) don’t one

Or

B) capable getting around it, something people capable doing

I find annoying going get downvoted oblivion ignorant people like guy, whatever, don’t really care enough Irish government considering removing September, definetly case. cautious reopening world, even considering that, others too.  they‘ll help breeding mutations vaccines won’t effective anymore. people danger mankind. I've gotten six people vaccinated talking vaccine giving good information. even link saved clinic finder send them. antivaxxer 5g nuts see woo woo Crystal hippies old hippie farmers.  
But id say 80% hick construction workers vaccinated here.  Except cannot 

So sorry condition meet list requirements 

If way get vaccinated.....oh wait don’t feel like it, nvm First point: 33% Britain voted lot charge, voted prior covid. proportional representation.


Second point: Yes granted, countries like Spain France offered sympathy exactly shite? France especially seeing anti Vax mentality prevalent. 

Third point: tens thousands people reaped sowed due government incompetence, fault? would offered condolences sympathy due government comparable countries were? were. Italy incompetent many times later pandemic Britain got shit together more.


There's also fact mindset prevailed well second third wave. waves happened time mass testing, one highest world, local lockdowns etc. purely incompetence new, little understood variant. comparable? variant UK found, amongst others, pretty much western country bothered sequence them. today Britain still gets punished still sequence Europe, besides Denmark, still doesn't, we're ones get cut off. Yet 3/4 adult population least partially vaccinated. 

Your comment lacks sort empathy, fact said due government, bet felt sorry Brazilians Indians, pure hypocrisy. part!!     Really is. trying make somehow Gibraltar fucked practically whole population vaccinated, compared US lucky get 70% adults done. stupid.   Different countries different tolerances cases. European countries US' case numbers, would freaking maybe going back lockdown. NZ Australia ones, would even so. populations expect zero cases community transmission. 

There point reopening border vast, vast majority people vaccinated. economy, apart international travel, 100% open measures place health system deal Covid. Opening borders means businesses close, they'll reduced capacity suddenly deal tons Covid patients.  1 3,000 sounds like high risk, certainly much higher risk blood clots Astra Zenica vaccine, resulted suspension vaccine many countries. think putting anti vax performance using excuse intentionally harm doctors 

Ignorant people right?

Talk unreasonable insensitive peoples problems  stop reporting cases, hospitalization, death unvaccinated people. Yeah guy get vaccinated protect able to, WON'T. worlds smallest needle even second actual piercing skin, right say he'll assault staff?? Fucking joke, people like prolonging shit. yeah good luck Gibraltar never ending, lifelong immunity 🙄 I'm quite sure. believe ""immunocompromised"" still makes sense. briefings media-friendly mever found serious factual.

Definitely anywhere near good California governor Gavin Newsom. don’t mind it, millions livelihood dependent tourism much mind   fake good would true Pfizer vaccines sent part help - case.

So, optics aside, sent effectively problematic vaccines. Seriously, don’t get this. kid can’t come you? ten mins? always can't get vaccinated. That's need to. happening second wave too... post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Geneticists infectious disease specialists uncovered potentially dangerous coronavirus mutations 36-year-old woman uncontrolled HIV unable shake SARS-CoV-2 virus close eight months. driving force behind patient’s rapid accumulation genetic changes probably impaired immune response due unsuccessfully treated HIV, researchers said.
The case highlights difficult truth: affluent nations racing vaccinate populations remain vulnerable long coronavirus spreading mutating low- middle-income countries, lack vaccine kept COVID-19 immunization rates low. That’s especially true countries like South Africa, HIV infections common often undetected.

“This underscores advantage virus put brakes it, put brakes globally,” said Dr. Bruce Walker, founding director Ragon Institute, immunology research center Boston.


While South African patient diagnosed HIV back 2006, doctors unable control viral load standard antiretroviral therapy, immune system’s population CD4+ cells — may play role clearing coronavirus infection — low.
For 216 days, woman continued test positive SARS-CoV-2 virus. hospitalized moderate illness nine days September soon contracted coronavirus, never became severely ill COVID-19.
Still, coronavirus lingered body underwent 13 genetic changes related crucial spike protein, along least 19 genetic shifts elsewhere could change behavior virus.

The new findings raise specter HIV/AIDS — 40-year-old scourge killed 32 million worldwide — could complicate efforts eradicate COVID-19 pandemic killed 3.5 million less year half.
Until South African patient, little evidence suggest HIV-infected people could complicate pandemic’s trajectory. HIV-positive people known likely become infected coronavirus. research suggested they did suffer worse medical consequences of COVID-19.
But case turns typical, picture could change: HIV patients whose infections controlled medication could “become factory variants whole world,” said Tulio de Oliveira, geneticist University KwaZulu-Natal Durban, led new research.

Worldwide, roughly 8 million people are thought infected HIV unaware status. additional 1.7 million antiretroviral medications aren’t working well.
The prospect close 10 million patients’ uncontrolled HIV could spawn new coronavirus variants wide-ranging implications.
“This syndemic,” said Dr. Jonathan Li, using term describes confluence two epidemics potential IHME says cases surge Fall! Alert! Alert! ...and they're also protect pharma IP human lives, god knows many people get infected die poorer countries. US could, right now, less unilaterally lift IP restrictions vaccines, help ramp manufacturing vaccinate world, instead we're still hashing far TRIPS waiver go protect pharma industry profits.

This vaccine equivalent billionaires give pittances charitable initiatives launder images, using massive wealth distort politics, economy, generally make everyone worse off. deplorable! ""Joe Biden shares needles leaders around globe.""

Kind missed opportunity headline. WA. Wendy's allowed go inside starting like March 2021, purpose ordering leaving. think may tables open many. McDonald's still drive thru only. finally got second Moderna shot yesterday (!!!), woke next day, moderate headache. took two Naproxens, went away... read NSAIDs like Naproxen avoided getting shot. shoot foot? become immune this? repatriated 100's citizens got caught overseas. never closed borders citizens US citizen get vaccine pretty much drugstore US. that's true either, 4th buy Pfizer, 1st buy Moderna. Yet still see people complaining ""we're back line!!!"" even though debunked months. Corporations don’t WANT give away technologies, like don’t WANT pay workers higher wages. That’s point government, compel things terrible human race. That’s vaccine waiver legitimate issue thrust front Biden administration, power enforce it. obviously likely far I’m aware. WTF?  Get vaccine, get lottery ticket? now? VF article worth read. like end world gets new date every often, previous end passes without incident. 1/8 way guess. also, suspicion we've vaccinated people worldwide gotten sick, great. Vaccinated people don’t need test known covid exposure symptoms. Says guidance fully vaccinated people page 🤔 Honestly, filth theaters big reason go 
 
Also, wipes antiseptic, destroy microbes chemical means. Either oxidation (it pretty difficult evolve resistance electrons forcibly removed molecules) denaturing proteins. That's poor way describe it.

Taiwan ability buy vaccines denied due dumb political reasons letter words ""our country"". China never interfered Taiwan would've gotten vaccines already. 

So describe really happened like

I'm Canadian, eligible second dose early July. Many others boat.

I get sort lashing everyone attention, tiring point. sit tight weeks things get better. pandemic definitely helped realize arrogant selfish majority people are. really sad, buy eye opening. Havent got vaccinated yet, plan soon. side effects? Hows working vaccinated?  many people know died much cleaning. Oh. wait, no, died covid.  it? Although rare, [you getting COVID naturally. I'm pretty sure that's referring to. good news source (one favorites, actually).

The person replied edited her/his post mention discrepancy reporting window.  studies indicate 90% natural COVID infection can’t get reinfected. think Israel’s study showed around 94% get reinfected COVID. makes sense since either vaccine natural infection provokes immune response body. results shouldn’t night day different. vaccine designed consistent response slightly different spike protein hopes block variants. long people like Biden Fauci continue say things seem indicate support Lab Leak Hypothesis(tm), I'm afraid we're going keep getting dragged deeper deeper conspiracy mindset. Dr. Vincent would say, bad. get misconception from? sources information trusts, not... Well, scientists? stay inside home talking penny used napkin, us want live life vaccine.

(If fellow 3rd worlder, things change. Take me. take longer get anglos at.) won't. Hospitilisations already already rise Scotland cases rose earlier England, deaths levelled may rising. Vaccination certainly mitigate fast hospitilisations deaths rise. let cases absolutely skyrocket, trending Scotland again, could issues. Personally think close adults getting first dose keep cases control bit longer. Cases rising rapidly unvaccinated people, vaccinated even partly vaccinated. Another month two could passed point ever seeing cases rise again.  good title who?

But please read original comment replied comment carefully, carefully keeping mind that

1. I'm troll said.
2. I'm fully vaccinated 
3. Sub in.  part comment advocated lockdown rest lives? farmers would gone “shitty leftist policies” like AG subsidies farm preservation. Quite farmer neighbors went business thanks recent trade war disrupting dairy sales. logic entire world would live constant lockdown rest eternity

No, high enough vaccination rates current variants would able spread population transmission rate would low. probably reach point around 80% population fully vaccinated. forever lockdowns necessary. 

As evolution even transmissable variants, probably means need keep decent border control quaratine conditions vaccination rate high worldwide. Low birth rates key characteristic developed countries according Demographic Transition Model. need import many immigrants try support ageing population. cousin currently... well, I'm sure disabled right word, lugging around oxygen tank years compromised immune system.

Why? despite vaccinated, caught breakthrough infection unvaccinated student hers. pre-COVID, pertussis, point everything right still health ruined anti-vaxxer.

And extra vulnerable COVID point left apartment anything walk outdoors year.

I really blame her, seems extra sad time I'm starting live life normally (fully vaccinated, area cases low).

Gallant gets vaccinated protect others. Goofus thinks (and even good job that), people suffer result.  fair much greater protection via seasonality population density ok. Comment 1: Cases less rise hospitilisations,and may happen


comment 2: that's true, hospitilisations rising 

You: That's expected.

Do read whole thread commenting? necessarily red counties. People color getting vaccinated quickly either various reasons. (Ie skepticism government’s intentions, comfortable taking time work it/recover due service/manual labor jobs, afraid show ID, dealing immigration issues, etc etc) Lol Canadian. leave vaccinations equation? 18 years old: Guess i'll die No, vaccine decreases odds infection serious disease.

Last checked South Korea Japan among bottom 4 countries worst vaccination percentage. least remember handle virus lot better countries acted quickly traced contacts really worked efficiently.

From I've read Japan main problem vaccination basically drowning bureaucracy point stagnates. Nope fully vaccinated got second dose two months prior. still sick rn. got exposed family member lunch with. around Max three hours. like 75% people 40+ well

The best guess cargo cult reasoning. They've heard phrase ""shedding virus"" decided use something grammatically similar without really bothering understand either phrase means.

I'd actually say changed well (with HPV vaccine), started getting much popular conservatives. then, course, there's going back Wakefield stuff, probably fringe. Get mine Saturday, cannot wait! Exactly, FDA rubber stamp approval else national disaster would occur.  think reasons

1. There's weird ideological alignment conservatives rejecting covid measures including vaccines. UK thing, dedicated anti-vaxxers anti-lockdowners, small movement


2. think offering vaccines age group tightly helped uptake. Scotland people got sent letters appointment people probably wanted get chance, whereas open systempeoole might delay booking.

3. People travel internationally UK US think thought may need fully vaccinated travel good incentive. takes 15 weeks first dose fully vaccinated here, late get vaccinated last minute decide want go holiday.

4. Lockdowns harder UK many US states. went 3 month complete lockdown 2020 four month complete lockdown 2021 partial lockdowns between. comparison things seemed pretty free states like Florida. one wants go back that. Sure. get vaccinated, protected,

I get level protection vaccine get gives. None vaccines protects everybody gets vaccinated. Pfizer may give 90% protection - AstraZeneca reduction disease transmission may low 67%.

Certainly need attain herd immunity - know many people become immune previous undetected infections, cannot know many people need vaccinate order achieve magic number immune people give us herd immunity.

Certainly better vaccinated, guarantee become infected, pass infection others. Possibly others unable get vaccinated previous medical may leery mRNA technology

Everyone 'leery' technology, everyone knows risk get vaccinated. excuse refusing vaccination. form cowardice - demonstrated selfish behavior, people think get free pass, rest take risk vaccinated. selfish people putting everybody else risk!

If enough people get vaccinated, coronavirus going go away! anti-USA sentiment?

Throughout pandemic taken every precaution defend position almost daily constant peer pressure “be normal” “not let covid fear rule life”. 

At one point, tested every week verified exposures first vaccine shot antibody test done. evidence have, never got covid (and neither family). Which, twisted way, people use “evidence” covid isn’t easy get media hyped - ignoring many people died long term effects it. still handful people office vaccinated (to knowledge) also refuse get vaccine. 

My co-worker walking around proud got point. talks lost smell/taste “a little stuffy” still lifting 400+lbs gym (he also went gym sick). keeps talking “wasn’t big deal” “doesn’t understand fuss” about.

He even made comment wearing mask yesterday, telling didn’t wear mask around anymore since immune (taking opportunity tell me, yet again, he’s isn’t bad “they” say). response “look, know you’re young pup lucky. But, frankly, it’s people like keeping mask. Since nice enough come work sick expose me, that’s proof enough keep taking precautions selfish people state regard human life even ounce decency fellow man. I’ll wear mask I’m damn good ready to.” little tit tat, basically made position clear. Irish like shots/s

Secondly, look elswhere, original post UNITED STATES. understand difficult comprehend. post return normal USA....

Again....have vaccinated? continue dodge question. Yup. Looks like that's back menu. 😉 consider US government rightfully focused vaccinating country first. obligation solely constituents voted in, world. limited Biden US, even countries charitable others.

Moving along, supply ramped initially match insane demand. eventually, fundamental belief wall reached within country dropped demand cliff, supply stayed consistent weeks unknowingly stockpiling. become clear reached point recently, they're opening unused supply countries actually utilize it.

It absolutely does. can’t unanimously say masks uncomfortable expect people take objective truth. Especially subjective opinions experience. one doesn’t convince anyone disagrees you, two asking disprove subjective opinion impossible telling someone subjective opinion wrong.

The difference actually empathize someone doesn’t experince. probably lot easier individuals maybe wear mask less hour week, compared people like me. Nah, easy karma grab. medical situation changes, overall situation changed...sometimes rapidly.

Mask chin. Like that's gonna fix it. Looked plenty idiotic. can't, kids 11 under. Still point stress parents disruptive happens False info. We've open now, final restrictions place. Also cases started going recently, probably good thing things still limits (such nightclubs) Ok, 99.9%, really issue. Insurance companies stop covering people refused get vaccinated. Heading Cancun 4th. We're already normal. I'm fully vaccinated ready party. anyone say it....

\* Ted Cruz left chat \* *\*laughs Peru\** 

*/sarcasm* second, thought /r/NoShitSherlock Yeah, we're locked down. There's basically nothing that's completely limits, fairly loose restrictions still exist all. Sometimes makes sense go slower go faster. dont live Germany immediate family struggles directly affected us. know want past us, least light end tunnel now! Guess works....has worked lots years diseases cares vaccinated? Seriously can’t trust fauci knows science

Uhh Fauci repeatedly said people need get vaccine, given numerous reasons it.

Of course people care vaccinated. Quick look submitted articles: Fauci’s emails, Florida coronavirus misinformation, Russia didn’t help Trump win 2016. Yeah, I’m good listening anymore you. 100% car crashes people crash cars jab since BCG back late 80's. needle phobia due meds take blood drawn tested twice year, expecting something like that. amazed feel thing side effect sore arm jab number 2. Survival fittest mean physical strength.  yet arguing personal choice somehow wrong. Almost exclusively among unvaccinated individuals health experts acknowledged extremely unlikely come anywhere near previous waves infection due high rates vaccination. fair, whats ratio vaccinated vs unvaccinated people King County?  See whole cleaning theater BS idiotic now, ever hurt keep high frequency handwashing. map terrible. Minnesota Wisconsin lumped PA New England, North Texas/Dallas area even remotely culturally similar Appalachia. Crazy talk. even go places? makes sense ignorant idiots like bother trying understand science. Hell, think incapable understanding logic science. point even trying you. care less cases un-vaccinated people - I'm much interested 3% vaccinated symptoms were, hospitalized, severe. wonder vaccinated getting tested first place.  Here’s data cases (not hospitalisation) NW region (area effected variant) May 25th. see cases stagnant 60+ (mostly vaccinated) surging younger age groups (less vaccinated all).

I presume doesn’t count actual source OP, compared completely anecdotal evidence posted Europeans allowed again, gladly take shot (along barbecue course). received Pfizer vaccine April 28th. tested positive May 24th. daughter play school two weeks nightly rehearsals performances. wear masks. started symptoms May 15th, tested positive May 17th immediately rest family started isolation different rooms house. outbreak 30+ kids performance. 

I gone anywhere since 17th, dealt mask issue. girls' 10 days quarantine testing negative wearing masks everywhere go, despite school longer requiring them.  **Update Swedish vaccination numbers.**

46.5% adults (18+) received least one shot, 19.5% adults fully vaccinated. terms full population (Sweden 10.38m inhabitants), percentages approx. 36.7% first shots 15.4% full vaccinations. total 5 400 436 doses administered, i.e. 52 per 100 pop.

Currently (new) vaccinations made either Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna. AstraZeneca reserved 65+ age group pretty much finished vaccinations save second doses. J&amp;J paused indefinitely likely never used. Excess doses AFAIK donated COVAX.

Most Sweden's 21 regions currently vaccinating 50+ around age, together 18+ comorbities medical staff. nationwide age distribution currently

Age | First dose coverage | Full vaccination
---|---|----
18-29 | 9.88% | 3.87%
30-39 | 12.56% | 5.06%
40-49 | 22.67% | 6.4%
50-59 | 57.33% | 8.69%
60-69 | 85.19% | 18.95%
70-79 | 91.94% | 51.64%
80-89 | 93.08% | 84.66%
90+ | 90.55% | 83.84%

The national goal adults offered first dose Sep 5. past 7 days total 489 629 doses administered, average 69 947 per day. Adjusted US population corresponds 2.2m doses/day.

Around 650k doses Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna delivered week. bit 16m doses required fully vaccinate adults, i.e. around 11m additional doses needed that.

Sources: fawn Sinovac either.

Who's giving false sense confidence population really borderline effective two doses (50% protection symptoms, 70% protection hospitalization death) useless one (literally, Coronovac estimated 3% effective one efficacy numbers considering vaccine evasion strains may push even further.

[This new Brasil - one worst variants widespread - shows ""reduction 80% symptomatic cases 95% deaths second vaccination last group city"". clearly work well enough, long enough people get fully vaccinated.

Yes, clearly modern vaccines better. simply enough world everyone. context, constant automatic downgrading Chinese vaccines whenever mentioned tiresome, privileged arguably contributes vaccine hesitancy places needed. Nothing 100% effective. don’t want take risk, lock house forever.

I one happy take mask situation it’s allowed I’m fully vaccinated. You’d surprised. nurses signing Jennifer Bridges’ petition. Maybe EU stops banning Americans. There’s nothing wrong logic. It’s common fuckin sense. 

Also, germaphobia ruining immune systems killing people. Ever thought one? Me? wouldn’t lock all. It’s unacceptable violation civil liberties.

Your turn. It’s one main campus think 6 community hospitals multiple clinics. argument its.... less(?) manipulative give larger prizes? stupidity virus still killing people. Yeah Internet Former Guy said he's reinstated August.

Do actually believe it? understand guys averaging like dozen confirmed cases day deaths. Meanwhile finally got 10k cases per day (which general metric removing mask/social distancing mandates) still hundreds deaths per day . Aussie numbers US would expect end summer vaccination effort basically done. guys fine vaccination effort open borders (which obviously important life death). Thanks 👍 could ask same. don’t believe natural immunity? think we're gonna hit anytime soon (NY) feel like issue going tear families apart even politics already do.

Look happened families 2016 say locked down, last weeks I've holiday Portugal long weekend, spent nice evenings UK pub gardens going cinema next week. proven worst international agency world. head Dr.Tedros continues tout incompetence absolutely nothing since start pandemic. begets believe still continue paid hundreds dollars till today people continue die. Thanks thoughtful response! travel factor great incentive thought of. told appointment...I heard NPR discuss study said believe actually big impact try protect perceive ""ours"" - in, opportunity given need take it, lest someone else get deserve. Super interesting.

And right. live border two states. state gradual lifting restrictions, still quite open UK standards, right border wild wild west 6 months. Disney animated version maybe sixty years ago. mere lad back then. said feeling stuffy couple days “a little tired” dismissed it. woke morning didn’t come work, lost taste/smell prompted go dr. 

So, showing symptoms couple days prior going dr, means shedding virus work week didn’t know infected - point made covid dangerous populace. They’re people said chances getting/suffering COVID low even though chances getting vaccine tiny fraction percentage chance. Natural immunity prevented loads hospitalisation

Congratulations, one dumbest sentences ever constructed.  can't afford see article. summarize it? Yeah link literally worthless. people health reasons, e.g cancer known serious allergy

Who cant get it, maybe ever agree, asinine. anatomy scan twins February last year right this. grateful got husband come anymore. idea one really scary me, honest. 

It's silly. thank you. air along. Better arranged ventilation. Hand hygiene still probably good idea though. true inactivated virus provides alternative surfaces beyond spike protein, actually negative relates potential variants, positive. spike protein resistant mutation surface proteins complex many parts cannot change still actually work. 

In words, true inactivated virus vaccines may better *some* variants, would rare, aggregate worse variants mRNA viral vector vaccines target mutation-resistant spike protein exclusively. top fact mRNA viral vector vaccines produce far immune cells allow resilient response long run inactivated virus vaccines. 

PS: article linked provide data support hypothesis all. Okay. 

The government (UK) claiming vaccine doesn’t stop catching virus. asymptomatic spreading actually exists must’ve virus many times, felt ill. Therefore don’t need vaccine a) naturally immunity b) doesn’t affect me.

Kiwis thus never worn masks govt says culturally they'd never acceptable. 

Similarly Bloomfield said would introduce social distancing vaccinated everyone (we currently social distancing). PM denied saying Bloomfield misunderstood, repeated another interview. makes clear govt never take advice him, masking social distancing. US actually fully vaccinated people UK (52% adults 49% UK) 63% adults 1-shot, we're far off. Maybe I’ll win laptop battery! Seems like getting cities 70%+ far important though getting rural counties even 50%. problem asymptomatic.

Do fucking same.


Masks bad idea public health even without covid. flu season? varies state.  Nearly 300 million doses given out, give incredibly stupid, incredibly lost cause. needs tested least 20 30 billion people I'll trust Ughhh hope not.  evidence there’s issue them? Lol. “Don’t let college liberalize you” headed Western.... got many times. used pretty moderate anyways past 6 years pushed far away that. think made point year wasted thereby completely “lost”. 

But think minority this. Also, looking previous generations events WWII, Vietnam Cold war era people could claim lost 4,2,2 years respectively. value time.

I think view total loss bit privileged view (just 2 cents) every generation restrictions put upon one way other. recovered flu. wore mask stay home. sense possibly making someone unnecessarily ill. mean goes bloomfield said day okay sure got voted I'm guessing understand tone.

Efficacy wise seems better 2 doses AZ par 2 doses Pfizer would actually make sense always mix vaccines maximize efficacy within population enough Pfizer Moderna everyone. got mostly pfizer, higher % efficacity (tho AZ still good, dont know % contagion) matter cases go hospitalisations deaths stay low. yeah rumors says Quebec announce shorten second dose 2 months able change date already have.

The good: spent shit ton time outside exercising enjoying life. Dozens mountain bike rides hikes; 50 trips mountains snowboard. managed land better-paying job employer saw huge increase business pandemic.

- CNN That's low risk... 24 million children age 12-17 US. vaccinated, almost 100k would experience SERIOUS side effects. what? Protecting unvaccinated adults? Serious MIS-C rare even worth mentioning context. Furthermore, vaccines even shown anything regards MIS.

It everyone's mutual benefit. ones benefiting unvaccinated adults. Statistically, children seem real benefit it.

The Alpha strain around since November, dominant strain Europe since. 

Personally, think vaccine mandatory adults. Leave children it, benefit them. people freaking Indian variant not, interesting note rise cases India widely covered media nobody talking fact cases India 30% peak.(400k May 8th, 130k yesterday).

And yes India underreporting would true May 8th like today landed moon (69) time realized segregation bad (65). Humans simultaneously smartest dumbest living things planet.

What exact restrictions country? 45 years might lifetime parent’s, calling privileged view. example holds true though, done progressively better limiting loss life due war, famine disease, yup absolutely. events happen, even North America. It’s choice (and other’s) either make best year completely write off. Like said think latter privileged view. Yeah, pretty complicated. strong state governments (Mostly Labour.) really saved us federal government’s mishandling covid. liberal government PR arm (The Murdoch Media) absolutely went apeshit trying undermine them.

The Federal government responsible vaccine rollout absolutely botched vaccine rollout.

Zimbabwe Brazil amongst countries vaccinated greater percentage population Scott Morrison managed. Considering rich nation amazing infrastructure relatively low population absolutely shameful. Basically going emails Fauci said things like Masks working can’t spread asymptomatic people. don’t point emails sent January February last year close nothing really known virus. Basically classic republican truth bending flew back States volunteer political campaign fell love it. No, far perfect, also amazing.

I get someone wants hate America need process brainwashing got kids. Hopefully eventually come back around loving amazing, incredibly imperfect, place. (AMZN.O) testing front-line staff Britain coronavirus variants feeding data public health officials, including hotspots strain first found India spreading fast. Aided rapid vaccine rollout, Britain verge reopening economy months lockdowns Delta variant first found India spread, including areas Amazon lab fulfilment centres. Luke Meredith, director Amazon Diagnostic Laboratory Britain, said company open offering service United States, rule making testing programme available UK public future. compare everything Black Plague, then:
""Did 33% city die? No? stop complaining!""

Nowhere say anything remotely close ""it's bad war!""

This is, however, worst disaster least 45 years North America. Peru worse off. looks like Uruguay getting soon. Get numbers right friend... one test “fit-for-fly” test cost £169 outgoing £210 book gov website. Interesting times alive live Europe lol. Vaccinations guarantee normality Europe. be, much pretty clear statements I've read - talk ""normal summer"" (implying beyond summer normal) ""some sort normal"" actual, restrictions normal. pretty much seems like pipe dream point, way we'll ever get permission actually live life fully again. Hell, ""experts"" already started warning 4th wave fall, least country.


Plus, whole vaccine passport thing despicable repulsive me, bald-faced lie would used make travel easier. clear, I've already signed get vaccinated want second-class citizen want basic right going shops/restaurants without brain poked every 3 days ""privilege"". Raking tourist bucks patch wrecked economy =/= return anything resembling pre-March 2020 normality. Europe gone deep end restrictions, zero chance we'll seeing restriction-free life regardless vaccine uptake. There's difference virus yielding immune response - normal - strong enough protect year later variant immunity evasion.

Cities rural areas hesitant ones would think would go way since vaccinated people likely people take virus seriously.  Color surprised Michigan would much higher city Detroit would get higher 34%. Even rest county outside city limits 60s. recent poll shows 10% ""never"" jab. apathetic hesitant another 20-30%.  Flu season shorthand kinds respiratory crud peaks around time - influenza, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, RSV, endemic coronaviruses, name peaks. see preprint? study peer reviewed submitted medical journal already? I’d love read it. true, one many reasons statistics complicated would initially think. going argue that. running vaccine campaigns...the intention vaccine campaign protect individual, it’s reach enough people vaccine actually takes steam pandemic community. definition vaccine campaign incentives used drive meant reduce mortality caused disease. 

With said, don’t care anybody’s motivation is, got shot you’re part solution. \-- Alarmist Name News walk get vaccine places Missouri. unfortunate people getting sick, themselves. Ctrl+c state's excel sheet national one? Vaccines given age state. state got equal amount vaccines per capita. Vermont vaccines longer. posted another sub I’ll cut paste here:

I feel like really non-story. 

They already know exactly many people got AZ first shot, last date AZ first dose given out. 12 weeks date (plus weeks wiggle room), point necessary doses spoken either via second dose, appointment one. 

Unopened vials AZ shelf life least six months. expiry long know need them, words. 

Whatever left, whatever else we’ve purchased, donate countries need. It’s rocket science. That's elitist. wonder many rural people think people cities assholes want tell live. goddamn PRESIDENT pushing alternative medicine entire Republican party. That's ""a politicians"". Try racism somewhere else, k thanx. Yup. aunt like this... somehow nurse. surprise? It’s made abundantly clear nobody charge cares kids. paper they’re alive, that’s schools still marred restrictions next year, they’re open all. double digit percentage gen Z kills within next 20 years almost medication mental problems, nobody care. fact life.  would literally take act Congress.

The group people charged tobacco users. 

Because using tobacco thing people choose increases chances needing medical care. flu shot’s around since 1940s… like mess drag years. Goodbye.

Antivaxxer? Excuse me? miss part said get vaccine? exactly say people get vaccine? 

Just capable understanding risks 30's take AZ (unlike you) mean anti-vax. logic entire UK government anti-vax absolute fucking moron. 30 wants safe take alternative vaccine AZ. think that's anti-vax even dumber thought.  wonder fact things getting good US (aka decrease cases) part reason people rush get vaccinated. Compared countries like UK/Canada is/was recent wave scariant fear. India stopped prioritizing bullshit religious treks actually fighting Covid would much better. hand, CDC fomites first idea damn near everything, *and* know droplets still major source COVID exposure (See: early Korean air conditioned restaurant study: 100% gravity effect COVID transmission suggests droplets primary form transmission) say aerosols form occurs, droplets seem far dangerous. like Fomites occur, it’s extremely uncommon. wait see going looking case counts get summer. much case counts tied seasons (I.e. US massive spikes holidays individual states spiked people likely outside). 

If get summer waves I’m going feel way comfortable dropping mandates rules. I'm sure evidence Curevac, Valneva, Novavax &amp; GSK/ Sanofil better, offer effective, scalable production? 

So we'd chucking eggs Pfizer basket hoping get supplies ordered decent time.  Haven’t suffered enough? saving lives thing obviously big thing, ""others"" never majority folks concern.

I would wager majority people got vaccine themselves, probably various reasons, ranging wanting get sick, wanting get back lives, simply wear mask anymore probably reason cannot think of. 

I sense preventing death others high many folks list reasons, might say nice side benefit, see main driver folks getting vaccinated.

Personally speaking, got vaccine desire get sick, protecting others really part thinking, though nice side benefit

Nobody claiming it’s 100% effective. best studies 95%. infected post-vaccination seeing drastically lower incidence severe symptoms complications. 

Coronavirus influenzas literally entirely different families viruses. symptoms mirror viruses infect lungs. 

Of course anyone outcomes. 

The coronavirus vaccine efforts began long time ago original SARS MERS. research already done. minor tweak make COVID it’s really significantly different. That’s also it’s important vaccinate now, people vaccinated, fewer people get infected. Fewer infectable hosts means less spread, less spread means lower chance mutation, lower chance mutation means don’t whole dance another 5 years.

It’s actually stated CDC enough data vaccine affect people certain autoimmune disorders. Hence blanket warning.

Having said that, really happy situations similar mine gotten vaccine suffered adverse effects yet. means hope! Humans complicated, giant ball emotions hook various things due life experiences. People family give ""rational reasons"" get vaccine, real reason emotion buried underneath ""logic"". Ofcourse one reveal emotion requires vulnurability emotional intelligence. probably fear, exactly know.

Thats humans are, use rationalize decisions based emotion, claim logical. believe life jackets fault drowned. right putting exact number efficacy...I think strong pattern favour vaccines appeared. Many un-vaccinated bought story mildness virus long time ago. idea we're longer dealing first variant. Sad truth need natural immunity vaccinated, whichever comes first.  believe gravity fair died falling. Ohhhh, okay, makes sense. Yeah, currently infusions thing keeping functional that’s probably it. lot sick days is. they've got science denying antivax doctors running cancer treatments Oh no. Anyways getting there, much longer now. Thanks clarification! one third world country? backwards parts full tribalism, ignorance, superstition extreme religious beliefs it’s unbelievable.

There's plenty so-called First World last year two especially anything go by. folks done math exactly think. least Darwinism start hit dumbest fucks hardest instead everyone. Boosters keep mutations control vaxxed folks rest fucking idiots choose believe hoax thin ranks instead rest herd now. consequences stupidity stupidity least blow back people deserve instead old folks vulnerable population. talking fact vaccination rate peaked 11th May increased last 3 weeks (and even slight spell labor ""labour"" Australia ""Labor Party"", Labour Party (that's case UK).

Just roll along fact Liberal Party Australia designated conservative party (and liberal).

(Not really actually conservative either that's yet another whole story.) South Africa checking make guys feel better! [“Ask, ye shall trust government? No.

Do trust specific bits government, like NHS, specific competencies? Yes. Righto! Thanks correction  Lol. It’s late, they’ve quite awhile now. It’s recently they’ve begun reciprocating courting low info candidates.  much Southwest/West cases spiked summer heat/wildfire smoke made people likely inside. Well, duh.... Ha! Perfect. Old.reddit.com  looked -- right measles outbreak Clark County, WA (near Portland, OR) 2019.     3% vaccinated people? still get even vaccinated? I'm confused regions (EU, India, etc.) able increase pace last weeks.

EU literally went 2.6 3.6 mln daily doses May record 5mln doses day administered days ago. talking about? Thank this! preventable 600,000.... counting American deaths ever... Aside New Zealand, democratic countries, South Korea done best job containing pandemic. Contact tracing digitalization instead hard lockdowns, sadly pretty much noone else followed strategy. report released week, CDC researchers acknowledge tally 10,262 breakthrough infections **likely “substantial undercount.”** Many people became infected despite getting vaccinated probably experienced mild illness worst didn’t seek testing confirm states reporting deaths certified patients infected coronavirus — died result COVID-19. cases, it’s **possible another ailment responsible death**. honest, California really ither option. many businesses people refusing adhere even restrictions place often local leadership law enforcement backed this. really enforcement mechanism use.

The winter surge also seen within overall context that, point, CA done extraordinarily well terms cases deaths compared rest country. Even surge, state still performed well overall, despite unique combination challenging circumstances.

There also, frankly, little evidence stricter lockdown would made huge difference, given majority transmission occurring private gatherings among families friends.  Woooo ty! they'll get antibodies eventually anyway imagine breakthrough cases least partially individuals immunocompromised unable develop antibodies. Exactly, comparing states recommend CDC numbers different consistently measured.  Thank telling this. really similar AIDS all. new drugs massively reduce viral load, HIV never goes away, can't ""recover"" it.

With Covid, cases body clears virus within days months.

A better comparison would influenza measles endemic infectious diseases try keep lid via vaccination learned live occasionally die with. Virtually them. kind experiment exist AZ much better treat Americans adults

what last two years supports hypothesis? best first aid kits, humvees bomb river away. No, ""the index case"" refers initial source infections. makes sense person already infected contagious. Absolutely, point far common people mild illness say flu flu typically exhibits far worse mild symptoms. can't count many times I've co-workers sick near claim ""Oh Flu"" I'm like ""how functional?!"" Second shots related hesitancy VS willingness, though. definition second doses vaccinating already willing. measure complete protection, fully vaxxed gold standard, percentage proportion willing roll sleeves, first doses count. also much greater risk. chile became pro China big deal Taiwan falls major situation. Gambling Taiwan risky especially considering small population doses would pay off. No, need it. Otherwise people get vaccinated, fourth wave emerges October. vaccine get? country? thought EU countries fully open vaccinations now?

In Poland moved encouraging people vaccinate, everyone wanted either already vaccine, date upcoming weeks. (Which sucks way, \~50% population signed far) dressing room Fox proved morons actually understand darwinism evolution. Hah, think early results showed something like 98.9% Pfizer, variants (which around trials) believe gone down. Crazy... get cards well Poland, personal use. confirmation form digitally signed QR-code everyone gets patient portal/app.

And app app store anyone get scans verifies confirmations.

With EU-wide certificate everyone got another QR code EU-standard that's it. Probably took hour implement ;)

&amp;#x200B;

I guess first 7 EU countries implemented standard similar system. wonder ones... Certainly California people able get vaccinated point healthcare workers 75s. Especially delta variant requires second dose really good immunity. strategy getting many first doses possible worked brilliantly us, game changed got Delta stats. Well vaccine work 5% people, get anywhere. cruise ship matter much.

That's nonsensical logic. Cruise ships breeding grounds infections. there's outbreak ship, spread far rapidly general population infected people going places over, infecting people going places over. That's comparable land. following spread pandemic early months? cruise ship vaccinated cruisers clearly far safer cruise ship without them. making sense. people want play Russian roulette. That's wait. Liberal, libertarian?  Stop weak ban people smh  also said studies pre-variant, jury's still them, evidence pretty solid vaccine prevents death original strain. read 33 year anti-covid/vaxxer cop died COVID-19. Jesus Christ. people lost narrative. sad. kid without father. want anyone die, even d-bag graduate Q University. die COVID June 2021 flat moronic. people need get together. oh damn idk thought 99.9% something lol I'm dumb Vaccine snobbishness real, it’s best moment still don’t know enough covid use range vaccines populations incase it’s found one two don’t perform well new variant example strange mostly non-vaccinated people getting covid now? almost like altered virus we've resisted attempt control us! /S efficacy mrna vaccines (moderna pfizer) around 90%, higher lot people thought would achieve. cases vaccinated person catches virus, also supposed much less deadly time less likely spread others. It’s possible research 70% figure. Maybe talking ober 18 year olds, 16 year olds, vaccines recently opened 12 up, makes sense number would bit lower. maybe see false information, idk. Yeah, we've lucky island strict border control. We've overall incredibly cases.

The side complacency govt population, resulting pathetic vaccine roll put us well behind rest world reopening long run  Always been. ship.  people get vaccinated, none vaccines 100% effective. plague-carrying superspreader could make bunch people sick: ships average 250 crew 3000 passengers. vaccine 95% efficacy rate, that's 162 people could get ill.

Well vaccine work 5% people, get anywhere. cruise ship matter much. know herd immunity is, since Fauci's emails proven people exposed covid without vaccinated also immunity, probably already hit number add number vaccinated number natural antibodies. 


 definition mentioned something old people young people risk getting it, case old people kids getting vaccinated aren't, vaccine safe? According CDC, [roughly breakthrough cases result death. Obviously vaccine preventing lot people getting disease first place, among become infected getting vaccine, mortality rate comparable unvaccinated. much extended family way. think people ‘living fear’ virus, refuse vaccinations, wear masks forced-never around one another still regularly went social events theme parks open past year. don’t wish anyone ill, honestly, fact none gotten sick reinforcing beliefs making insufferable.   Yep sure am. STEM degree, STEM career 5G covid shots. Don’t come close. immeasurably frustrating people refusing take largely themselves...vaccinated. mumps rubella tetanus polio them, refuse, even proven efficacy one. Grrrrr! It’s looking like even complete vaccination campaign, we’re going keep border measures place, potentially number years. 
Personally I’m absolutely rush let tourists back don’t mind Going much quicker cuckstralia. eventually anyway... corona deniers treated hospitals rather sent churches good chance right. feel bad people unable get vaccine lack availability health reasons I'm playing world's smallest violin people chance get vaccinated, refuse, end getting covid. whole People believe coronavirus manufactured lab haven’t allowed say Facebook since February — Wednesday, is, Facebook announced lifting Presumably something wavering elite consensus lab leaks. consensus never monolithic proponents claimed, stifling opponents aver. produce Facebook ban lot journalism dismissing hypothesis well-debunked conspiracy theory racist roots.

short 'n sweet lack ability read analyze scientific papers?

That population, irrespective political beliefs stances covid. people default one way, others different way, pretty condescending stupid statement.

Do understand appropriately use semi-colons? I'm honestly asking. /r/iamverysmart Yep Everyone waiting room super impressed brave google it.... already say that.... Japan (they don’t sick days) great news, (1) vaccines effective want (2) shows getting vaccinated eventually develop [potentially life-long infection (if already). Anyone else click news long enough find state in? discount Oh no! Anyway... myself! got covid 11th 12th day 2nd dose bad coughing fits 2 weeks. I've clear week point symptoms I'm still coughing bit unfortunately. even know got it, barely public saw vaccinated people :( vaccine One dose still pass people
Rare. cases. Canada passed UK first doses given (per capita) today, appear slowing all. Next up: Israel. immunocompromised, would efficacy level though? Yup. parents looking forward summer going back normal, bringing kids places, socializing them, etc. — rapid adoption new CDC guidance completely dashed kids 12.  realize gets vaccinated, basically ""over"" him? longer worry.

Being fully vaccinated made pandemic feel ""over"" me. stopped afraid people. liberating.

I get people realize this. Nobody said anything human rights?? 

Point it’s embarrassing developed country lower vaccination rate developing countries. People taking immunosuppressants used Crohn's disease need able stop infusions certain amount time before/after vaccination. ensure patient make enough antibodies vaccine. guess person Remicade, *does* cause issues antibody creation, sick Crohn's right delay infusion. 


source: patient autoimmune disease immunosuppressants needed adjusted got vaccinated. Could get link see email? Thanks! Pride bois Pretty much. We’re gerrymandered fuck. would username be? referenced kids (too young), two friends MS (one massive health concerns) mom terminal cancer. unlikely true?

The majority friends almost colleagues vaccinated. Everyone immediate family eligible vaccinated.

Yes, people lie Reddit. I'll concede issue statement - ""lots"" - chosen better word. I'm concerned many people treating though people can't get vaxxed mythical unicorns. instead, narrative people get vaxxed protect vulnerable can't (like kids, mom, friend).  would percent efficacy vaccines given number? unsure mods allow it. COVID-19 cases King County among unvaccinated people

**Translation:** *""The vaccine works.""* Oh. Word? don’t believe law, therefor don’t follow them? Fauci email admitted masks nothing. man citing data knew work however went mask line forced politics. sad even people can't see that. also strange, people Crohns told, specifically, take COVID vaccine available them. 

Folks auto-immune disorders immune suppressed high risk COVID, important get vaccinated. suspect cases, either miscommunication (their doctor told told you) someone chain truthful. 

I challenge stuff Social Proof vital aspect Influence, people running around saying ""my friend's cousins's doctor said vaccines bad"" validation chose get vaccinated. Fauci email admitted masks nothing. man citing data knew work however went mask line forced politics. sad even people can't see that. counts one? Thats catching it. supposed 99.9% effective preventing hospitalization/death. even j&amp;j  someone Lyme, yes please! let ""perfect"" enemy ""better"". Also anecdotal.

Mine started like 19 hours resolved 8 hours.

My mom took nap fine.

My brother sick week. Disclaimer: I've skimmed part page looks like looking 19 May 2021, MHRA received Yellow Card reports 332 cases major thromboembolic events (blood clots) concurrent thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) UK following vaccination COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. events occurred 180 women 151 men aged 18 93 years overall case fatality rate 17% 58 deaths. 17 cases reported second dose.

TLDR: Looks like 58, May 19th 2 weeks... heard one copy paste format titles like “X happening, Z” annoying It’s necessarily nefarious intentions. coworker Crohns who, according her, told doctor take it. Something infusions. Thing is, bring example, people ask details, fuck know. I’m doctor, didn’t ask details it’s none business. That’s risk take. claims wanted get vaccine she’s following doctor’s advice.

I’m antivaxxer. I’m fully vaxxed. personally think get second opinion since everything I’ve heard suggests get it. it’s also like know what’s going ailment. 

Just Reddit though, think something’s fishy, lot questions lot choices, since woman wipes every surface religiously she’s immunocompromised, yet *only wears flimsy face shield*. |: color skeptical. Statistics Canada said compared LEB 2019 82.10 years, decrease 0.41 years would “reduce LEB six years earlier 2013” 81.68 years. either telling truth (sorry, Reddit people lie) serious selection bias going on, regard circle associates. certainly true statement, lots things preclude people getting vaccinated. mean guy already proven point. moved Poland stays even though dislikes it, why? opportunity EU. People people, dumb smart ones. majority thankfully intelligent dumb western world. Hopefully figure way talk people persuade them, yeah, sad frustrating. one says is.  leak one thing. information request. Big 300m get free mcchicken Diet Coke US eliminated measles couple times already- brought back outside. many instances vaccination teams killed Pakistan, Afghanistan Africa - don’t take advice. third world super enlightened beacon human rights. Good example self-resolving problem  remember CNN reported actual news. trusted Lyn Vaughn Tom Brokaw Peter Jennings. Sad what’s happened them. Lock low take-up might actually allows everyone offered vaccine. offered everyone UK vaccine time, there'd mad rush cope, whereas maybe US, since take-up lower, cope opening floodgates? vaccinated need wear mask anywhere. still want businesses may still require it. think probably fine.

I know state France September. massive anti-vax problem they've several lockdowns.

They might open September life back normal also surprised continue cycle they've on. Anyone actually France want chime in?  Yeah, situation kind similar mine ways. honestly huge problem US kid. Social justice, minority rights police brutality affected view extreme. ended hating US 16. Literally hated much refused stand participate sort anthems anything spoke dislike whenever chance. literally disgusted American. Then, grew experienced life more. travelled around world. Worked many different jobs met many different people states country. Now, early 30s look back cringe. Ya, US problems, ""American Dream"" still alive well. 

I grew poor, never able attend school, never went college worked way one shit job next jobs got better I'm making 6 figures without college debt. reason many immigrants come rising caste social situation much harder anywhere else. America many problems, everywhere else. hope come together fix problems make US much better live.  So, 95% efficacy symptomatic COVID means id 20 unvaccinated people would gotten it, instead 1 vaccinated person would gotten it.

For variants thenJ&amp;J, like 4 1.

Again, really good. 100%. replied someone sub thought must ravaged lack international tourism zero COVID policy. pointed nearly 70% tourism economy domestic, natural resource export way huger anyway - tourism driven economy. Guess proves it. still maintain stance wish US last shitfuck year - care meant got vaccine months earlier. sources I'm volunteer helping rollout majority I've administered AstraZeneca. It'll likely shift towards Pfizer soon though, start immunising 30s advised AZ, favour Pfizer. I've yet see Moderna, though apparently rolling steadily well. pretty similar (if worse) Australia. Granted, 2% population fully vaccinated. sources come people told get vaxxed conditions. good friend mom. responded comments above. would LOVE could get vaccinated current status apparently precludes that. One care Barnes St. Louis. trust oncologist give advice needs. whole slew doctors team, treating multiple issues flat told good idea her.   may case, brilliant scientists around globe (ones specialize crating vaccines), calling believe isn’t credible C-19 came anywhere else lab now, yet claims shut months belittled conspiracy theorists/fake news.

I believe serious problem large portion world community shut voices credible people. also believe someone top CDC, explore avenue well bit negligence least.

As someone specializes chemistry (granted I’m virologist geneticist), much read virus likely engineered current form makes sense. least points put actual virologists. going point here? presented preventative methods, accept it. I’m 3rd world country eliminated measles 2019, year US 1.3k cases. Shouldn’t way around? 1420 people positive.
With 97% unvaccinated, must mean around 43 people positive even vaccine. Try booking website anyway! say try, I've administered plenty people 30 last weeks, though I'm privy eligibility; could vulnerability thing, maybe area bit ahead national average.  Imagine living place need tap greed luck lotteries order get somebody get vaccine save lives. It’s unimaginable canadian. Um everything economics politics India.

Britain reporting people coming Bangladesh Pakistan also showing high rates infection virus. IIRC, returnees one two countries actually higher rates infection returnees India.  person I've conversation Reddit. Responded earlier comment. definitely anti-vaxxer. Fully vaxxed kids too, soon eligible. racist

DONE! Full disclosure - I'm vaccinated kids soon eligible. Pretty much opposite anti-vaxxer here.

I responded another comment, friend MS mom (aggressive recurring cancer clinical trial treatment) instructed get vaccine due current situations.

As recent surgery comment, friend bowel resection asked vaccine given timeline wait. wanted heal introducing vaccine. seemed like plausible medical advice me.

I'm sure people skeptical. would love everyone get vaccine get vaccinated people can't (they exist) live semblance normal life. want punish everyone reaching milestone? think another reason could cos also kinda started anti-vax movement, Andrew Wakefield complete shambles career. started it, thus first really get board it, subsequently also got well. 

That's perception events. child 90s, Wakefield nonsense happened, feel free show I'm wrong! door door, lot longer 15 minutes - like 90. Half hour get there, 20 mins waiting called, 15 mins observation, 30 mins home. vaccine given tiny office wheelchair stroller friendly; could barely get compact stroller without bumping pharmacist's desk.

I'd absolutely again, 90 minute slog kid hated every minute strapped something. bring multiple kids would've challenging could enough prevent people going. super motivated get shot make work, probably already dragged kids appointments like target policy.  Wales (where live) actually fair bit along Israel. can’t think stronger force natural selection. people wanna suffer guess guess makes okay folks developed countries ignore science? You’ve got world palm, people still stupid. hey long bunch 3rd world dumbasses dumb shit, means lmao What’s going Fauci emails? think important trivialize peoples problems. ""First world problems"" might meme still holds truth. Uruguay very, long way Peru: far, Uruguay 1,261 deaths per million people Peru 5,538. higher deaths per million past weeks, much.

Uruguay wealthier too, better healthcare system better access vaccines, outbreak almost certainly tail within next couple months. submission linking google.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Yep! grandmother (80+) recently rebooked 2nd dose appointment 6 weeks earlier originally planned. here. fully open 2 months cases plummeting. I'm reasonably certain sarcastic, Australian perspective state governments handled day-to-day issues quarantines, lock downs, mask mandates, etc reasonably well, federal government mostly deal income support (which good time, since dried even though we're still outbreaks/lock downs) vaccinations (which dragging on). control virus good (up last week happily back pubs, restaurants etc even without vaccines), vaccine rollout slow &amp; poorly managed. one remembers John Oliver saying something wanting go back hating Cuomo instead thankful actually something covid. January February last year close nothing really known virus.

Bingo. still see people snap back comments CDC changed mask recommendations last year big conspiracy somehow. never anything say point recommendation changed. problem analogy either guarantee door 2, chance opening door 1, see people might hesitant open second door might never see what's behind first.

That said, everyone still open door number 2. Sounds like medical background.

I know friend MS specifically told good candidate current vaccines current status. mom (middle cancer treatment, clinical trial aggressive is) also given advice. explicitly told get vaccine - maybe trial less immune system? too. Comments exactly you’d expect well. count them. article says don’t investigate mild cases. stop making excuses actual direct quotes

it's okay fauci hasnt perfect face brand new pandemic god look replies you

people really, really bend backwards pretend fauci's words ""america ready truth"" arent meant

what mean then? really? decide interpret fauci's words however want now? facetious Sorry hear that. available? 3% cases vaccinated people!?

That's would've guessed. sucks society bear cost, agree. privilege country vaccine available free anyone wants it. zero sympathy people don’t get vaccinated. see want people get vaccine same, don’t wanna go back school 🤷‍♂️ using tobacco thing people choose increases chances needing medical care.

I think sarcastic. describe me? lol... questioning nurses even asked , left right arm lol... 'm questioning . suggested get vaccinated non primary arm education mean smart though, particularly comes critical thinking. I've definitely heard least US education system, good job teaching actual critical thinking, instead focusing rote memorization facts such. likely learn methods higher education, assuming actually take right classes. Yes. Next question. Longshoremen linesmen legendary workers comp rates. don’t know they’re eligible discriminated health insurance. Okay, thanks! think anti vaccine sentiment divisive politics even remotely uniquely american, 8 bridges sell Go subreddit’s main page click dots top right corner choose “user flair” Wait 3% vaccinated?? seems high breakthrough cases way higher expected. vaccine still extremely effective. 

In Illinois hundreds expected dozens. Still, it’s small minority Hey I’m fully vaccinated, get little subtitle name? Yeah , older age groups. younger groups maybe not.. booked last week doses 10.5weeks apart. I'm 30s Calm comrade. 
There plenty vaccines go around, no-one really wants Chinese ones  
And anyway China really miss piddly little island like Taiwan, want want everything else within thousand mile radius. serious debriefings sent covid positive people nursing homes was/is proven purposly hid covid deaths political points

just wasnt trump attacked trump doesnt mean wasnt seriously scumbag

""serious talk"" classic big man talk loud manly stuff Natural selection work. vaccines 90+% effective. They’re fantastic super effective don’t expect 100% effectiveness vaccine that’s given millions people. It’s feasible.  anyone even looked wikipedia would know full shit whole time

it's whataboutism here

cuomo published book beating covid NYS time highest deaths per capita miles live King County, definitely are.

If look King County maps (go click Geography Time) COVID rates, look maps vaccinations click Geography), they're almost perfect inverse.

North King County amazing vaccination rates (like 80-90% people 12!), 2-week COVID rates 25 per 100k. Meanwhile, southeast King County much lower vaccination rates, also COVID rates 300 per 100k. 

Basically, playing exactly like UK Israel did. keep community spread get 55-60% vaccination, craters. quite amusing see Chinese complaining Japan offering vaccines Taiwan.  idiot coworker is.  Thankfully took precautions fine. kind mask wear, KN95 one normal ones? Exactly. We’re invested world recovering. Even selfishly, global trade variants, it’s important world vaccinated are, acknowledge it’s even close perfect globally. Different vaccines get around different allergies understand. Hur dur stupid anti vaxers! What’s breakdown people one vs two dose, unable receive vaccination due preexisting conditions, qualify get vaccinated? [You're pretty good People frequently confuse stupidity bravery. Yep. longer use sub inform virus longer reflects big picture. good news NA kinda good news grab.

I'm saying people eager return normality. think completely ignoring rest world kind mean.

&amp;#x200B;

And someone asks , I'm Latam. things ""happy"" here.  Well that’s surprise. Totally agree this. I'm sorry experienced comment above, extremely insensitive situation, sounds difficult. People great making excuses. mRNA trials showed efficacy, that's line numbers. Essentially means &lt; 5% test positive coronavirus, says nothing outcome.

The trials also showed 100% efficacy hospitalization death, holds well, 43 people recover comfortably home (if they're even symptomatic). got vaccine Feb 5th. brought interval 8 weeks people vulnerable groups, although significant amount population. 32 million people included vulnerable groups, 22 million 2nd doses given far.  emotional types also much easy manipulate, **many** them.

The propaganda machines, used Brexit Trump, seemed prove fearmonger masses win elections/referendums. non masker expect.
 choice get vaccinated &amp; risk getting covid. hoax . Right?!? Weird seeing king county mentioned front page without Seattle mentioned title Cuz one guy YouTube wearing white lab coat said there's way truly know safe, he's also guy told covid definitely safe.

Although NC give $25 getting vaccinated four counties even Colorado's current plan would improvement now.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Yes, surprise you. Vaccinated people get covid. likelihood symptomatic much reduced, likelihood getting severe covid much reduced likelihood dying much reduced. 

Vaccinated mean bulletproof. means body antibodies ready go come contact it.

Also older people people weakened immune systems get protection others due immune defficiency. I'm opposite situation. entire family mom's side (her, four siblings, spouses cousins) one cousin refuses vaccinated. Everyone else fully vaccinated. cousin told grandmother mom lives allowed see grandma unless vaccinated. parents considering letting come see either fully support gramma mom's decision. refuses change mind still. 

My aunt uncle incredible mad trying figure went wrong (their two kids got asap) literally made gramma cry feels love enough care sees (she 93). crazy, moved away Pittsburgh, got surrounded conservative group raised liberal household, longer believes vaccines. Even conservative aunt uncle can't get (they surgeon biochemist believe science). 

I feel like issue going tear families apart even politics already do. dad's side he's informed parents coming holidays unless unvaccinated crazy Trump supporting conspiracy believing uncle there, probably means holidays ever again. That’s awesome dude, good you. happen see AMC going moon yesterday. piece shit. also great replacing word typing. double click word type. old man mild stroke finally getting CPAP treat sleep apnea take care better still believes vaccine globalist psy-op. thought wanted encourage vaccination?  congrats UK! *can* happen. exposed? two weeks full series 1 2 doses? two previous people commented clearly didn’t read article lol We're fortunate platforms like internet certain types ""news"" sources exist polio vaccine smallpox vaccine created.    
  We'd still dealing both.    
    
So many people easily swayed believe conspiracy immune compromised covid least worries takes experts say that? Absolutely. Could return normal today. Malaysian, fully deserved. still see infantile adults flaunting rules even midst 'full lockdown'. Renaming variants totally falls apart headline tags ""origin country"" next it. F'kn journalists COunty, people fully vaccinated told need test, need Quarantine. show symptoms, need Isolate themselves, but... drastically lowers number vaccinated positive people.   Agreed. Efficacy asymptomatic infections may also lower, vaccinated people might feel sick enough get tested  SARS: *it's free real-estate* That's true. Absolutely. case rate death rate vaccinated vs non vaccinated. Even symptoms and/or testing positive one day insanely fast. Yes. make sense current case rates compared past surges, risk level unvaccinated people, really looking case rate per 100k unvaccinated people. Goop liberals alt-right conspiracy theorists make majority anti-vaxx coalition. Yeah post chock full misinformation. welcome! constantly. Middle article idea word means find without losing train thought within article. wish better retention. mean hospitalized one day contracting virus? That's insanely fast.

Nah, pretty sure precautionary measure, case condition deteriorated further. someone googles definitions least times day seriously know feature existed. Thank you, random internet stranger. google friend

- Restaurants can't keep demand hire enough staff
- Rental cars sold out
- Lots tourists complaining this, also complaining continued indoor mask mandates
- Locals want tourism slow down. went 0 50% 2019 numbers quickly island ready it
- tourism reopened Kauai, largest spike covid cases whole pandemic. Jokcci That's always problem one party wants build country best deconstruct it, it... Scholarships given prizes time. Scholarships given random stuff like good hockey playing trombone. think scholarships vaccines going make things worse. law require vaccinated get tested exposure. unvaccinated still return work getting tested easy often. Unfortunately reality days dealing idiotic family members don’t believe science.  Can't wait til reaches age bracket. long wait it'll worth good news banned getting pencil store store.

What turns them? part like I'd curious know what. interesting many people America violently opposed vaccine. understand hesitant, like dont ever research talk medical professionals it. 

Many people know republican supported Trump. soon vaccine rolled out, praising Trump responsible providing vaccine. wasnt true all, yet refuse take vaccine ignorantly praised providing. Thats confusing.  ever loving fuck comment. exactly? 


He denied Wuhan research funded NIH gain function congress questioning, youtube. 


Now learned knew gain function, lied congress, US funding creation superviruses China... 


The thing could conspiracy theory Covid 19 originated Wuhan lab. rest facts. Yes, well way quash and, least Alberta, second doses starting now. Give Mexico sure!  demand flatlining, makes sense. It’s time share Pfizer Moderna doses.  Love it! Insurance pay hospitalization  government shows time time trustworthy. continue trusting it, can't fail tech future immunology. going give patents, neither country part it.

It would nice healthcare free widely available, that's world live in.

Because clean energy patents made available. Etc etc. people arguing wearing masks ones arguing shouldn’t wearing masks. never said good things happening. never said good things horizon. said, truthfully, can't compare first dose percentages second doses. 

It says Canada yet far along UK Israel. negative? not. Unless saying difference doses skipped?

I can't believe comment thread. place used science, we're sToP NeGaTiVe MaKeS sAd swear, new Greek alphabet variant naming SUCKS. never remember which. they're choosing unvaccinated, denied health care covid. Yea typical ad hom nothings. I've got shots conduct effect 60% Americans also least 1 shot. simple think. counties plans make vaccines mean actually it.

India example licensed produce AZ vaccine can't produce enough.  Shit, really? buddy finished last chemo round rare lymphoma, really hope vaccine worked. Well, two things. Israel like top, far. 

Secondly talk fully vaxxed countries: % first dose extremely signficiant dictates absolute ceiling % fully vaccinated population. First dose % tells us high get, second dose doesn't. October one knew timeline vaccine , trump said would ready equivalent broken clock correct twice day. case haven’t seen data/polls suggesting October republicans open vaccinated.  Isnt be? news?  trapezius also tight sore day first dose, mild side effect annoying realise this, right?! plus side, think helps develop empathy connection others (not sick people!) 3% vaccinated people Yeah worst seems over, still lacking oxygen oxygen production capacity.

The US could send oxygen producing machines personnel set up. Also doctors vaccines would help. overheard neighbor talking California mask mandate ending heard another neighbor ask vaccinated, said no...

Like actual hell, got vaccinated, stop worrying damn mandate. wear mine stores now, understand concept lost them. also mean can't take safely, team cautious. wash hands public restrooms amount public restrooms crap sinks drizzle tiny bit water paper towels (air dry only) ""pull"" door blows mind. door handle probably one dirtiest things touch.. right washed hands. least paper towels use shield freshly washed hands door. 

I keep hand sanitizer use regularly. made huge difference terms often crud running system. Religious use hand sanitizer getting enough sleep enough avoid common colds / ""the crud"" 99% time me. first question, yes. irrefutable evidence intentional misleading comments views change. Unfortunately 30% people change views regardless evidence. followed story avidly! There’s problem people wearing face mask. really interesting read social anxiety general, absolutely reopening anxiety. Reading people worrying boring nothing say kind reassuring I've experience much life usually felt like one. much isolation, I'm eager get meet people anxiety really factor. I'm trying make light anyone else's anxiety, seeing tables turned case makes feel like I'm actually pretty normal all. Good stuff. one thing many people understand COVID case would probably categorized ""mild"" definitions disease ""mild, moderate, severe.""

But i'm sure think ""mildly ill"" throughout course illness! feeling unwell wanted call 911, really spectrum ""i'm sitting couch eating doritos instead going gym"" mildly ill  Agreed! Pace amazing. 2nd doses really ramping up. Three family got second jab week another booked weeks sooner. younger kids (2 18) get first jab next week. Bravo involved. Yes that’s right, currently Pfizer Moderna used. recently allowed private medical organizations import approved vaccine, won’t given national level, private (paid) basis. wonder viewership falling now, since case numbers falling English speaking countries. really want know people live. know them. I've never met them. Every human know fucking happy pandemic (in US) coming end. They're making dinner reservations vacation plans. They're thrilled fucking death kids school next year.
 
I'm saying exist, really, exist numbers statistically matter? many people afraid take 30% effective mask replace 99.997% effective vaccine?  Busch goto cheap beer college.  Last time spell one like perfume can't believe used drink it. Let’s get heart matter. 300 kids died. That’s shutdowns, masking, etc. drop precautions including masking, many kids die start vaccinating around sept? 100-200? thousands hospitalized? worth wearing mask fall?

And that’s ignoring thousands deaths among adults, everyone paying hospitalizations raised insurance premiums taxes, risking variants could evade vaccines. it’s ignoring unknown long term effects. 

Is really worth it? thought lab leak portion never completely dismissed, **man-made/engineered** part theory was? Pfizer shorted us like 4 weeks made changes increase production. got vaccines beause increased production.

Those four weeks gave people plenty time complain Trudeau fucked us. vaccine reduces hospitilaztion mortality. ideal, think still good idea doll first doses.  Americas all. nice easy Monroe doctrine US also take responsibility.

lol Imagine pushing back educating yourself? 3 things ton restrictions?  I’m happy this. I'm playing world's smallest violin people chance get vaccinated, refuse, end getting covid

Hell, I'll take step outright celebrate actively removed gene pool. Peru quite ok moment, highest death rate world due past months... Aka ""stupid"" people (for 12 older.) That's way would drink Bud Bud Lite. crazy restricted still are. Watching sports, stadiums full capacity Canada allowing like 2500 healthcare workers. Here’s novel idea; get vaccinated scared neighbors aren’t.  Blood cancer patients (no shock) survivors (big shock) lowered responses well.

I Hodgkins joined LLS study. I'm 21 years now, antibodies maxed test, universal (thankfully). Reddit Random option sent subreddit pictures people drinking beer shower.  remember name weird fetish exists. parents exactly I’ve already covid anyway. German Chancellor Angela Merkel weighed U.S. proposal waive patent protections Covid-19 vaccines, casting doubt whether idea enough international support become U.S. plan would create “severe complications” production vaccines, German government spokeswoman said Thursday ""What current issue? really intellectual property. give intellectual property laboratories know produce produce tomorrow?"" (Macron) told reporters arrival European Union summit Portuguese city main issue solidarity distribution doses.”  You’re getting downvoted aren’t allowed criticize leftism ~~tolerant~~ Reddit person know vaccinated also believes weird ass moon theories first hand knowledge lol. Yep, this. waited full 2 weeks second shot, despite coworkers ditching masks day second shot. Unless it’s unvaccinated people reason able get doses, highly unlikely, okay headline. Exactly, hope information shared becomes available. meantime wish vulnerable people csn heard supported work issues mean us - especially come top existing trauma. wish anyway! Disproving fear long-term effects: time people feared installing electrical services homes might cause burn down.  mobile/cellphone mast located near residence might cause develop cancer. got supply issues. one reliable supply Pfizer. 70% vaccines adminster Pfizer. 

If curious Pfizer would screwed. October, saying wanted take vaccine would’ve convinced 50% people wanted listen Trump, wanted ingest disinfectant.

We getting flurry articles op-eds time saying get comfortable staying home much possible years care public health.  Immeasurable high anguish immeasurably low anguish? friends listen Joe Rogan might explain things I'm understanding comment correctly. conspiracies promote?   CFA app curbside? always use app kind things get order quickly Honestly, even turns true, it’s looking likely, would come it? It’s like go war them. rely much it’s like could put major sanctions them. killed millions people get slap wrist it. Amazing keep up. know take little bit time whole world done covid great step forward! news linked actual news articles relating coronavirus. read listen anything. It’s quack YouTube channel saying anything want oversight. said something similar day got downvoted hell.

Look people, part, angry whatever, requirement rude people. Yes, keep taking high road. lonely sometimes? Sure. guarantee calling someone ""worthless, idiotic piece shit"" going convince vaccinated. waste breath. move on, say something positively convincing. say nothing. jerk help. 

There people legit still fence waiting bit longer. like motivations, give shit them. want convince get vaccinated, kind quiet. want push fence-sitters away, dick. still prefer quiet nothing nice say. Right now, country world health authority considering someone fully vaccinated past history COVID one dose 2 dose vaccine. therefore plan complete vaccine series thought non-Americans even allowed travel US atm Yes can, called 'law'. got COVID 19 vaccine. feel Id gladly ""just get darn test"", last time got tested, took 3 days get answer though  Yup, real misstep steps involved complicated target consumers. struggle get guys even sign email address work. would much effective handed beer way door getting shot. Everyone conspiracy theorist comes covid 19 even joe biden reviving wuhan lab theory. consences subject matter all. 

If ask 10 people covid 19 sub would get 10 different answers. science flawed still remember fauci said masks unnessary feb 2020 last year. 

Science tell us ought event merely best representation material world. also changes time nothing worshipped. think better understand predictiment people would pick choose facts got here. far concerened whole thing complete collapse common decision making. bad. That's amazing work Ehhhhh was. grew PNW yeah anti-vax people tended earthy leftist types. Especially Oregon. people cities chill. Redditors cities. People 18 older eligible one five $1 million prizes. lot conservative/conspiracy rabbit holes also drop lot money advertising. Crowder, shapiro, tim pool, see youtube ads constantly every time I'm computer work browsing history. coworkers older 85. lived work. Said they’d get bored home, would miss socializing. social life do. Covid bad enough crater global economy horrify humanity well year, seemingly bad enough businesses (or states) invest effective air filtration units enclosed public buildings. IE onus staying safe always people, zero control indoor air quality places must go time time.

I don’t blame anyone “hygiene theater” activities it’s one things individuals control (along mask-wearing generally staying home). foreigners. Presumably that's US citizens. news article Alaska giving regardless nationality attract international travel. America literally worst handling virus world. What's point? self centred average yank? impression Canada really hard time getting things going, changed? remember reading dead bodies spreading morgues huge problem actually. Anywhere world within visa waiver scheme lucky enough US visa. Well, well, well. Thank you! think give many free articles month something. checked yesterday Anchorage none. else seen rental car shortages? They're fixing getting TMSC build factories US. No, would basic materials masks hand reserve.  Tucker would shoulder-checked cheap seats get shot. 

Very glad got early! No, got second dose 5/5. Fully vaccinated 5/19. one Denver? refused vaccine they're claiming ""line duty death"" family gets taxpayer money. Love refusing vaccine ""personal choice"" except everyone else pay it. curious study concludes, this: not.

Or, specifically, if/when do, September see case levels 21% higher January, peak pandemic US. 

Interestingly, conclusion operates assumption unvaccinated individuals currently engaging pre-pandemic behavior, ""switch"" pulled July 4. If, say, unvaccinated people already there, surge likely substantially ""baked in"" already. Weird, get paywalled, basically saying pandemic continuing strong ever among unvaccinated people vaccinated ones wearing mask washing hands. people often times socialize around similar like-minded people. You’re going pandemic continue clusters read article, would be? don’t get make decisions people’s civil liberties.  would’ve thought 🤔 Here’s thing: youngest epilepsy. first started March 2020 literally begging people social media platforms wear masks. needed go drugstore grocery shop would devastated gave her. Every single Conservative antimasker Covid denier told stay home couldn’t care less kid many like her. suppose take high road somehow it’s fault mean them?!?! Please.  think .01%. anyone small child, difficult take out. Anything makes slightly easier people get vaccinated good thing. concerns people long term effects several years see whey would change anything. illegal leave house except certain, enumerated list reasons, like going buy groceries, seeking medical attention, exercising, etc. Illegal visit house. Illegal even visit someone else outdoors. Illegal operate bar pub restaurant. Illegal leave country. 

It’s far prison.  I'm still hoping Ireland wins that. far know, Canada many supply issues do. Ditto. AstraZeneca 65.

Especially weird claim continued pause J&amp;J motivated ""good supply vaccines"" vaccination goal postponed months due lack vaccine supply. People also plan quitting sneezing elbow bizarrely.  favorite phase bashing people promoting exercise Vitamin ways reduce risk conspiracy theorists brainwashed Joe Rogan. Forget housework! Lets paint, read books drink good wine! news: Water wet! 

Seriously though, two sisters hesitant getting vaccines normally ample amount common sense. Reason: trust government time low handled crisis year ago. Yes, go lockdown months dropped ball hard, actually get shit together eventually. well, least concerning covid, country (the Netherlands) still ton crises work through. happens arrive Taiwan anniversary date Tiananmen Square massacre may completely incidental... Remember anything covid maybe manmade ""fact checked"" deleted? holds up. Good Halloween movie. like lot  It’s more-so eating inside it’s want take out. 

I usually spent time driving Chick Fil actually spent restaurant takes 5 mins drive Chick Fil A. 

Also gives people options drive thru isn’t always insane. Study finds nearly 100% child births come females didnt abort pregnancy would that?  privileged take imagine painful witness people flaunting rules.... Spare us false equivalence aspersions *all* treating people like shit that's nearly universally true.

My mom vaccinated thought she'd lose access grandkids. feel shame letting convince case, even though probably never was.

People react pain. take fear worry. coddle fear reinforce it.

My mother much happier (and safer!) vaccinated. 

Showing people pain getting vaccinated actually great motivator. Use carrot much possible, make aware stick, get believe stick; never wield stick unless must protect dependents.

This classic persuasive argument, nothing new special circumstance. limitations, probably hope for. You’re bit turned around meaning 5%. wasn’t 5% vaccine recipients trials got covid, it’s people get covid, 5% vaccine group 95% placebo group. percentage vaccine recipients got covid even tinier. wonder though helped reducing flu colds... Singapore detailed contact tracing map: sort different things including vaccination status. correct understanding Singapore using mostly pfizer moderna? compound efficacy reduced transmission rates

This basically though. People tend overestimate direct protection gives (though wonderful job still), underestimate indirect protection gives reducing community spread rate. awesome! statistic meaningless without knowing percentage Kings County people vaccinated.  Shooting moon person riding operating public transportation them. even time, large ass window vehicle gets pulled sanitation, ever sanitized all.

Dumbfucks like anti-vaxxers anti-maskers big reasons gotta sanitize everything. I'm curious Las Vegas part Far West El Norte. 90% people hospitalized current Covid-19 wave, worst country faced, hadn’t vaccinated, said.

From Bahrain Ministry [Our data shows unvaccinated accounted 95% total number deaths Kingdom Bahrain due complications virus, confirms important role vaccination raising levels immunity actual thing reading comments asking. Cheers   think it’s combination fact vaccine politicized home stretch election last year mainstream’s media preference airing bad news point can’t trusted objective/factual. Wait, what's point vaccine? Like see drops chances 3% still get work? serious. Who's paying vaccines? Mine free!!! people this? honestly think reading various news sources posted internet strangers commenting different fed crazier crazier conspiracy videos YouTube clicks thanks perfected algorithms? actually think content same? mean, find funny make typical reddit ""you say bad thing social media using social media lel"" comment post *academic report* discussing dangers *conspiracy theories* spread easily wide via YouTube.

The shit people consume YouTube 100% news informative way. crazy ramblings grifters looking profit people's stupidity. Certain forms social media far damaging others always blows mind people choose ignorant decide treat every single social media platform same.  outbreak Covid Taiwan recently? seems Taiwan can't get vaccine US, even Japan/South Korea wait get Pfizer/Moderna Vaccines. Taiwan refuses vaccine China, since government people think trustable. last option would BioNTech(BNT) germany. However, company China call Fosun invested BNT pandemic becomes representative supplier China/Taiwan/Hongkong/Macau, Taiwan also called Chinese vaccine refuses BNT vaccine well.

Now Taiwan developing vaccine now, think vaccine available soon. guess Taiwanese realize dangerous situation could turn out, decide fly China take vaccine shot. China, hand, stop flight Taiwan opinion. treat Taiwanese differently unique policy them. Maybe cut flights everywhere else world, they'll still keep flights China Taiwan open, show kindness Taiwanese people. from? hoping relief finds community soon. I'm coming experience. Went 140+ days lockdown relative normality side. things return bounce back Like Australia right? 🤦 expecting to. complete publicity stunt try get win EU. basically thing, though. ways removing remediating potential negative consequences sex.  
If parents think removing potential negative consequence something exact thing ""giving permission"", they're admitting way getting kids follow *moral* request make fear *physical punishment* otherwise. 
Your car insurance example apt counterpoint. I'm upset global crisis countries gotten together funded covax rather bilateral deals manufacturers get ahead line. I'm upset vaccines could provided places needed rather wealthier countries. beneficial everyone long run. Also India manufacturers lot world's vaccines currently falling apart partially bi lateral deals. Shit husband too?!?! bring wife’s husband US gave Canada AZ doses still act like spoiled child. Makes sense. personal medicine people seem reach silver bullets number issues - E.g. Vitamin D, Vitamin C, “no vac - use immunneeessystems!”, elk meat, fat loss pills. reality is, bodies complex pieces machinery. need bit everything balance perform optimally. notion includes symphony notes immune system response. yes, people need adequate Vitamin levels. lot people don’t. getting 10, 20, 30x Vitamin pill doesn’t make super man. doesn’t make immune Covid. makes body balance amount Vitamin needed. go sun bit, take supplements. don’t overdo - doesn’t help - It’s balance, exertion. Hey questions recent things happening apologies isn’t place.

Not steep drop past days still steady downtrend. Hopefully plateau soon 15-20k first dose shots another couple months. afternoon I'm there's 200 comments. crazy knowing like beginning year Pfizer approved age group US basically vaccine. fine. I'm businessman, understand one company located another country dictate another country's right purchase anything. 

But would interested see official international laws allows this.

Also even whole right distribution true, proving way described true. Probably Ireland’s vaccination campaign going okay countries need Glancing profile somehow doubt vaccinated answered. CDC says need. symptoms test. Reddit: Fuck US exporting vaccines 

Also Reddit: Fuck US exporting vaccines! resident lives maryland miles away baltimore, shit went around REAL fast. someone who's fully vaccinated left entire life back NZ employment training jazz, yes..I mind.

This comment unbelievably selfish short sighted actually pisses off, I'm going ignore move day.

Have good day! kind do, U.S. medical innovation subsidizes world's universal health care systems. people obsess brands.... weirdest part me. Leave Reddit get angry US exporting vacciens. Tell Gibraltar (116% first dosed). Yes.  Eventually 2 billion people die, vaccinated not. Eventually.  Yeah guess friends take solace fact even though might lose everything, people done “very, well.” 

“Shit” happened government made happen. idea avoiding fever reducers speculation. Phase 3 trials people avoiding OTC painkillers/fever reducers, fine.  UK said they'd offering Ireland doses. Still gotten anything. Get 404 PC.
The url backslash too, thing dunno. makes sense. thought meant get vaccinated could Canada confused. 

I'm incredibly relieved vaccines become political people seem willing excited get them. distinction without difference, welcome disagree. wrong, mind still counts anti-vaxx. lmao. believe science would keep maybe dying, believe science gets time work. see employer gives people day work deal ""vaccine side effects"", tell it. Yes, case numbers give better indication like two weeks time. look ICU numbers, may get late try prevent rising further. Yeah, great US cases dropping nicely, let's weirdly cheer India variant outbreak UK CDC study showed 80% effective asymptomatic infection (vs 90% symptomatic), relatively small sample size. Yes, understanding they've bought ton doses they'd need vaccinate entire population. 


EDIT: Yep, looked up. US bought enough vaccines vaccinate entire population, three times over.  NI Wales already vaccinating 18s. Totally agree. 

Started following advise back what, February 20'! question still stands, think vaccinated people require less testing Social distancing actually correct term, literally meant stop gathering indoors co-workers, friends, people church etc, WAY covid spread.

Yet everybody started implement awkward 2m magical rule, like staying 1 centimeter closer, deathly danger. No, can’t. Laws basic human rights immoral.  also ship anti-vaxxers?  Nice Africa still waiting. We’re anxiously looking got 80 thousand AZ vaccines initially 100k Sinopharm since approved early May. 

Knowing million people vaccinate, need know deployed first dose way time second dose. 

Or distribute smaller pool, keeping half supply used second dose. 

We don’t luxury choosing vaccine want. 

Our population 1.4 million lives matter too. we’re experiencing one highest per capita death rates globally right now. 

We need vaccines. 
I’m hoping get decent allotment 6million meant region. 

VP Harris met Prime Minister morning news huge relief - Altho don’t think anyone fully relax it’s landed. 
It's pretty amazing feeling fully vaccinated. love it! [Source data couple weeks old, around 36% Pfizer, 10% Moderna 6% AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD.  brought wifes boyfriend. CDC says besides small number people fit exceptions. large majority falls test needed. don’t know that’s hard understand. it’s cases, disproportionate number favor test necessary. Yes, think UK first that. impossible discussion anywhere without crazy people showing forcing many rational people abandon rationality thinking they're countering them. would rather sneeze mask time being. wish statistic come expense UK cases rising. don’t care nice not. many conservatives platform you?

Mass censorship moved political parties farther farther away platforms. 

Why care posting Reddit kid? get banned political opinion lot main subreddits. What? odd fellow thats sure... Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

Who cares? Let ever want. Youre vaccinated. Headaches like usually dehydration. Water electrolytes answer. China gets away ignoring IP laws get Iran-style sanctions. reason India either.

Worked well. let’s forget daily average lower March 2020 positivity rate much lower too.  Covid still new lot less tests. lot people getting tested. Call uneducated IHME?

Batch EW3134 representing. How'd go? Stop dramatic, nobody's buying it.  Stop using vaccinated leverage aren’t following science. aren’t political prop, refuse part it. likely? talking donations. EU *already* exported hundreds millions doses.  Come Besiktas going right now. family moved Christmas July 4 covid 3 20 us vaccinated. others plans be. Luckily 2 year old young remember care. “we don’t know enough vaccine” “in exactly two years, 2 weeks, 5 hours, 32 minutes, 55.6 seconds” everyone got vaccine die. Corrupt utterly disgusting money grabbing IOC. Señor, esto es un México. EU “shared” vaccines made within borders, supply received part contracts manufacturers.

There difference allowing manufacturers export giving away doses sent EU.

Also, US allowing export completed vaccines vaccine components now, don’t federal export review like EU tallies number doses departing territory. comparing lockdowns slavery offensive absurd, hence removal. Okay, must part estimation. Yeah, Fauci guessing late November now. Can't *freaking* wait. wish ***before*** next school year. Signed trials could find, word yet. Ok understand. 

Canada included list vaccine donations I’m assuming intention help people yourself. 

I also notice vaccines sent Americans Korea believe. 

There’s much could done vaccine exports prior April since export ban expired able benefit now. totally get points, agree you’re saying. think we’re “done” wrong (not saying said this). mean stay home? No. mean don’t go you’re vaccinated? No. mean wear mask you’re vaccinated? No. mean pandemic over? Literally no. 

Acknowledging things isn’t fear mongering. Telling people we’re going die is. There’s difference. 16% New Jerseyans say unwilling get COVID-19 vaccine, considerable drop last fall vaccine hesitancy much higher, according Rutgers-Eagleton poll released Thursday.

Introverted person means recharge home: they're anti-social. example introverted (I recharge home, alone) extremely social.  

What talking anti-social people anyways....which seems celebrated personality trait around here. Proved capable? PCR test made community college US. It’s magical test.

That’s magnitudes away building, staffing, running lab make mRNA vaccines.

So talking years years build facilities, think that, even patent released lab wouldn’t build years, well pandemic over.

If wanted help, they’d make precursors, largely free patent short supply (proving patents alone hinder development, people cant make anything drop hat).

Could done better? rolled two effective vaccines calendar year safer effective anything else developed anywhere.

Yes delays scale, supposed 100m doses end 2020, took much longer get there.

If guys living breathing mRNA vaccines decade issues getting plants designed full capacity US government using DPA source rare supplies, really think scientist country notable native vaccine production could possibly get production cutting edge vaccine done reasonable amount time patent information vaccine itself.

Just think that.

A highly complex biotechnology think completely inexperienced scientists aren’t native English speakers could effectively develop way make vaccine it’s lipid delivery system there’s global shortage materials. upstart could bring vaccine market meaningful time frame?

It’s like Moderna Pfizer spare bodies lying around send advisor build plant complete well pandemic over. mean that’s complete waste manpower need maximize production end virus now, 2-4 years plant gets running. argument? people complaining US dumb bad giving vaccines away sooner European Canadian know better way get multiple vaccines one virus begin mass production/distribution within year?

I know saying system bad needs overhaul mean burden making proposal this.  Head ache, low grade fever, feeling exhausted, etc. felt feverish Pfizer shots, bit chance.  First sub never supportive, people given shit happened someone long wasny covid related. 

Secondly, expect? We've done year we're seeing results vaccination, cases deaths freefall. vaccine works.

Let's call is: fear mongering. Caution making sure vaccinated people may still get covid stay home get test, constantly pretending there's monster side hill fear. Theres difference. 

These getting downvoted ignore reality situation. Natural infection creates antibodies parts virus, including spike.

I vaguely remember reading there’s type antibody test tell one(s) have. me. 

It's entirely fault western governments. fault international health institutions. start prepared.

Younger age groups aren’t eligible vaccine yet it’s spreading fast groups bcos obviously age groups mostly mix whole argument minor inconvenience exchange courtesy. think minor inconvenience wearing uncomfortable, says much care fellow human. never worn mask long enough got used it? like complaining wear shirt restaurant, would think someone like mentally weak can't suck put shirt situation? Calling shirt uncomfortable subjective, like subjectivity makes argument weaker. part developing vaccine.

If call so, call vaccine Fosun-Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. 

The whole pharmaceutical system needs total overhaul. clearly working. vaccines. Money never decide gets live not. ethical axiom. I'm sure. recall, mRNA creates spike protein, antibodies natural covid infection created targeting spike protein would same. there's surge 2 weeks memorial day, it'll wait see 4th July next.

Why hard people admit vaccine working... suspect still place want reward people traveling US get vaccine.

Probably nonsensical reason could think of. vaccine passport, implemented see changes. 😂 Dude that's funny. Idk what's people holding high value political views anyway.

Safe tough understand reopening anxiety. worst year ever. you’re asking US get Canada - sovereign nation - change border rules? That’s going happen. 

Repatriation one thing. I’ve witnessed that. 

But you’re describing, embassy saying? Kent variant UK ""Alpha"" variant. People outside UK necessarily know Kent is.

Now, unless read report wrong, case fatality Delta variant low, would good news. I’m pretty sure differentiate since vaccine gives antibodies spike infection gives others also. watch utube 100% distrust government, especially way conducted throughout I'm hesitant, vaccine &amp; anyone starts racking I'm anti vax 🙄 That's COVAX existed. Moderna approved 16 year olds US since 1st approval. There's significant side effects age group different adults. 

There cases heart inflammation cited potentially associated younger ages mRNA. still investigation extremely small percentage vs number vaccines given. even assumed vaccine driven, still seems decently higher risk heart inflammation covid among young adults vs vaccine. may vaccine driven. UK 51 cases per million. Portugal 54.

Is UK UK list safe countries? world news? agree isn’t high priority, think it’s going happen either way. helping reduce impact would good

Also, Japan needs help anyway. don’t like articles like always imply people anxious returning normal social anxiety. I’m really dreading full return normal would rather spend time home family getting sucked back commuting work, going work social functions work trips return social obligations like seeing family often going parties hosted friends acquaintances. don’t social anxiety, prefer spending time wife kids people (especially work socializing). know people excited return office don’t get it.

The reason get frustrated CONTINUE fail grasp this. idea variables are...

Ok, vaccinated? think current climate fear conspiracies many people little bit edge, whether rational not. unfortunate truth enough understand world way know 100% sure nothing happen 20 years wait 20 years.

What however compare vaccine similar treatments past, knowledge human body, conclude things know safe, probably well. know negative effects tend fade time, amplify, know decent amount immune system works, seeing red flags year+ data have.

At end day, fear logic we're using applies anything. technically possible latest flavor Pop-Tart uses combination sweeteners preservatives kill us exactly 19 years now. unlikely worth talking it. Humans managed go millions years changing environments circumstances without something wiping us out, we'll probably make one too.  Ok little incentive country able produce vaccines much faster covax funded. US knew would able manufacture huge dose count quickly took gamble knowing mutation would make vaccines useless unlikely timeframe. reason didn’t explicitly include J&amp;J? first time I’ve heard someone outside US talk positively US Reddit. Nice. many lives would lock for, then? make tradeoff? CA massive state far monolithic. tons Republicans there.   must capturing positive cases 10 plus people dying every day. Vietnam also reporting low hundred cases per day might 1 death day only.

Really need increase testing capacity get better idea many cases actually are. fawn Sinovac either. proving insufficient drive cases multiple countries. Chile almost entirely Coronavac struggling contain surge ever since began reopen. giving false sense confidence population really borderline effective two doses (50% protection symptoms, 70% protection hospitalization death) useless one (literally, Coronovac estimated 3% effective one dose). 

And efficacy numbers considering vaccine evasion strains may push even further. numbers illustrative only, SA variant drops Pfizer ~95% 85-90%, drop likely put fully vaccinated coronavac individual something like 30% - good enough. 

This nothing ""China bad!"" somehow implying making ""bad"" product. vaccines definitely better nothing, clearly old school inactivated viruses showing weakness relative modern miracles mRNA vaccines (and viral vector matter). immune response intracellular protein production clearly much stronger dead virus particles floating bloodstream (and improved use stabilized spike protein). mild case, according him, also made clear doesn’t plan vax “it wasn’t bad”. I’ve simply even stopped trying people.

I'm glad I'm one thinks strange anti vax coming now. 100 million seems fast gets us 5 billion end year.

Most vaccines require two shots may correct vulnerable vaccinated, half population still lives fear end year. reference adnan case?? Love waiting playing it. different weapon. vaccine BB gun. virus shotgun. Went away Friday came back easter.  Cool whirlwind combating misinformation learning go.

Very true.

However, majority misinformation targeted, aim causing deaths. I'll ignore anything coming layperson implies people get vaccinated soon possible. recently, I'd also ignore anything arguing safety measures unnecessary.

So that's part it, part propaganda, effective, usually entirely subtle. Propaganda victims often use call ""cargo cult arguments,"" parrot phrases they've heard contexts without really understanding they're saying.

For example, week two ago, see people coming woodwork saying ""trust science"" effort get people stop wearing masks. meets conditions. seems oddly aggressive common safety measure, uses particular set phrase turned bit shibboleth.

I guess that's third thing. People sudden repeating message, even something quite make sense. favorite recent example people saying wearing mask cases drop somehow implies lack belief vaccines work. bit two-fer allows propaganda victim attack masks also managing sneak negative comment vaccines. ever past Poughkeepsie?   100 percent catch polio unvaccinated too

Weird statistics work mean, get parents inherently cautious kids getting sick, flu literally deadly COVID young children. backed science statistics.

Internet disinformation makes sad. We’re stupid species. see path 62.8% 70% next 31 days. daily increment averaging 0.1 0.2 percentage points declining. remained constant, we'd end 65.9% 69.0% July 4.

This exactly *everyone* get it. Vaccines work population level.

I'm particularly worried catching COVID right now, that's I'm vaccinated *and* area almost new cases. latter reason came people vaccinated. Denial really first step Apparently scientists learn new stuff unfolding scientific situation. OBs office seem little stricter some. I've heard still allow spouses 12 20 week allow all. Mine allows none.

Also, pretty sure wife's exception, rule, research I've done. moving Florida next month I'm researching OBs, even allowing spouses. think love Spam (the canned meat thing) join Hawaii culture. Yes lots people skeptical CDCs recommendations 18 months neverending mistakes lies. Especially came new mask recommendations clearly attempt get unvaccinated people take shot based reality pandemic. still wearing n95 absolutely go somewhere vaccinated. studies showing vaccine efficacy six months old point CDC said longer tracking breakthrough cases unless someone ends hospital. flying blind reasonable take precautions get hit virus continues evolve possibly escapes vaccine immunity. Unless you’re fully vaccinated course, lick away :) Well half right. Vaccinated people don’t need testing they’ve around covid positive person showing symptoms. different unvaccinated since recommend get tested circumstance. 
The article makes sense testing 2 groups compare?

Children also susceptible catching schools spreading vulnerable children adults. 75% entire population done, *then* reaching herd immunity. is, quite there.

The good news vaccines used work Indian variant, need push many people possible given least first vaccine. Someone else posted link said 75% vaccinated.

So 97% cases occur 25% population 3% occurs 75% population, that's 99% efficacy preventing COVID first place. deep web. new cases dropped like 40%+ last two weeks  Henceforth idiots acquire covid. already shipped AZ doses Canada Mexico AZ passed review Mexico Canada. would foreign countries waiting FDA?  point made covid dangerous populace.

sadly people like give single solitary shit anyone else. much look consider evidence supports narrative. Sloppy/incompetent, yes. Lack caring, no. don’t understand, didn’t people say “but gave immune system” Twitter Facebook? happened? think confused ultraviolet sterilization robot. recent uptick probably caused imported cases India. UK permitted hundreds flights India country huge number cases. distribution infections supports view. Thats behind paywall see study cited. lead paragraph

The experimental drug TEMPOL may promising oral antiviral treatment COVID-19, suggests study cell cultures researchers National Institutes Health. TEMPOL limit SARS-CoV-2 infection impairing activity viral enzyme called RNA replicase. work led researchers NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute Child Health Human Development (NICHD). study appears Science. short answer virus nationality regardless is. Although variants, seem imported/exported easily without restrictions. 

A longer answer although situation much much better right US elsewhere world, due covid weaker flu. due relatively widespread vaccines and, importantly, due many sacrifices healthcare workers parents made far.

The risk calculation differs family family. still many parents US want take risks unvaccinated children. untrue ""children risk covid"" ""the flu literally deadly covid young children"" 

There also article Lancet saying ""Our results demonstrate relaxing social distancing measures vaccinated individuals would minimal impact incidence, extending guidelines individuals adequate vaccination children could fuel rapid rise COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations,  source number vaccine administered manufacturer Canada? I.E. # Pfizer doses, Moderna, etc?  That's great article, thanks! Seeing Georgia Virginia's stats general vaccination rates kinda explains see partisan states strong correlation political affiliation vaccination rate. I've primarily lived states. Three days two weeks since second dose.

I'm almost home free! mean get point US almost 3x many deaths per million people Canada did. We've always careful wanted avoid that.

This seems something people (including Canadians complaining) somehow forgotten about. data somewhere contains countries used much specific vaccine? 

I'm attempting create graphic shows much vaccines country used countries' outbreaks going. useful place find data?

Reuters good place shows country vaccines approved, really useful without knowing much vaccine used: example Hungary largely suppressed outbreaks essentially approved big American, British, Russian, Chinese vaccines, highly doubtful using large amount Chinese vaccines given successful vaccines' spotty record elsewhere. actual content emails quoted total nothingburger. Claiming Fauci respondents said virus ""can't develop naturally"" completely disingenuous. Exports also could happen prior April. legislation enacted stop vaccine exports expired then. cost money though. Can't afford 2 times per week. free readily available like Denmark would great!  much punishment. I'm sure many would love people punished it, withholding vaccine would punish child cancer. I'm sure vile enough want that, wouldn't.

Instead, viewing permission. eyes, giving vaccine like telling kid OK go sex. sort odd, I'm sure view getting kids car insurance permission go drive tree. alas, that's seems about. thing sex education contraception. Teaching protecting seen permission, better keep uninformed hope they're scared sex (lol...good luck that). I’ve wondering anyone legit insight I’m interested understanding. 

Not antagonistic way, I’m curious understand process hold (if any) is. long remains socially acceptable want touched public, fine. want go back world considered rude refuse handshake hug. aMeRiCa aMaRiTe!! yeah, that's good data. anecdotal, assuming opposite information have. 100% effective, believe one unlucky ones catches it, since antibodies vaccine help, likely less severe version likelihood hospitalization death lower unvaccinated. Why? probably fully vaccinated two doses states you? promised, shipping won’t happen FDA clears. 

We anxiously awaiting. That's great graphic. love whole article's layout.  know blip holiday. general, cases lagging indicator least 2 weeks. average takes week show symptoms, possibly days get sick enough get test, day two test result reported. sure getting downvoted. EU, Canada would big trouble right now. respect EU increase much distain US has.

India going shit bring reported states like Mississippi turn away vaccines posted Facebook ""we send vaccines people Mississippi want India"" people furious. whole point need advertise this. number one selling point get someone get vaccinated.

Vaccines work. 69% least 1 shot. amazing news town least. American, 100% donating vaccines countries. Get vaxxed buddy! Smart decision :) hard one, smart. vaccines require two doses though apart Janssen. way? never late share Countries high vaccine rates probably looking ICU intake rather cases. got first AZ shot supply probably would gone States FDA approved. Got bootleg antibodies sorry hear that. this? Since anti-vaxxers care *evidence*? Truly fascinating results lol.. Well, that, getting vaccinated form solidarity mutual aid. 35M/day pretty remarkable. almost hard imagine that. That's 400 jabs per second every second day. parallel, means 50 vials vaccine produced every second. 

Modern manufacturing supply chains remarkable. dare imply utilize critical thinking pursuit knowledge. someone actually experience norovirus, think cleaning stay tbh. one traumatic experiences life, still pretty seriously obsessive anxiety sanitation it, largely compounded flippant ignorance many people food safety. extremely small, fractions hundredth little hesitant cheer Sweden aproach - seems many infections for... nothing? Economy took worse hit peers, measures place. last months I've (whether rightfully not, know) looked situation US disgust, seeing americans get choose get vaccinated, cases even choosing vaccine get. 

So I'm thankful this, even though comes late feels like scraps bit. know simple, know bit unfair think like that, seeing difference situations cannot help feel way.  enough keep lingering demand satisfied still sending doses abroad. probably. actually pretty sick idea washing hands cleaning surfaces make immune system weaker. excuse lazy, gross people use lazy gross.

The first thing Covidiots said elderly died COVID would died anyways, that's excess deaths become important metric. Figures hospitalised vaccinated hospitalised vaccinated. “Essentially pointless” lol thats assumption without knowing:

A : percentage hospitalisations occurred vaccinated people? usual percentage vaccines (pretty sure 90%+ people risk hospitalisation vaccinated 90% 51%)

B: many doses people had? 1 two dose? long vaccination get sick/hospitalised (usually takes two weeks get protection dose Pfizer, longer AZ)

Unfortunately, that’s working TN. Employers, mine included, care employees. fact, one office consistently worn mask (and continue so) - even TN epicenter new infections. 

TN political “leadership” made clear it’s “right” wear mask get vaccine. Last time looked, near bottom country vaccinations. 

My point is, employers interested protecting employees. zero consequences coming work sick. fact, one even told positive almost two weeks, even though knew exposed. TN passed law (practically) can’t sue employer get covid. So, again, consequences anyone allowing spread. I'd like see that, but:

1. One dose still *vaccinated*, they're tiny number overall cases;
2. qualify medically exempt perhaps 20% population - blame attaches them, still need included calculation effectiveness. They're ones need benefit herd immunity;
3. remaining 25-30% population apathetic anti-vax - far chosen remain unvaccinated. likely represent bulk symptomatic cases. think wapo article says hospitalization rate better indicator bc rate doesn’t rely testing etc. Average length pandemic 2-3 years. HIV pandemic going since 1980's.

Apart extreme media hype social media misinformation flow, much different.  probably end strict lockdown get pick culture... Cause picking one. Yup, need actual enforcement can't call lockdown. enough people US got arrested breaking restrictions past year. bet people would've stayed home seeing neighbors handcuffs. set 'received 1 dose' flair? find anything online. Fully vaxed? get Last shot? preexisting conditions? Meanwhile me, European Canadas closed borders anti-usa sentiment. Shocker. many still never find harmful situations. fault allowed edit title misleading.

*""Pregnancy* lasts nine months post-conception"" true, nine months (or close number) mother, rather pregnant.

Immunity, hand, go away nine months. talking legally-presumed duration immunity healthcare, vaccination, testing purposes; nothing end immunity headline applies. understand political situation. first time state locked since federal government stopped wage business handouts. state government trying force federal government resume handouts locked down. 

The federal government wants states stop locking tiny number cases handle way New South Wales has. states want they've always handled lockdowns trusting contact tracers.

Basically Victoria bigging virus justify locking dozen cases. I've trying find data prevalence blood clots Janssen/J&amp;J lately data could find CDC (USA) - early May, suggests somewhat lower incidence AstraZeneca (especially men).

Yes, figures updated [here safety update report based detailed analysis data 26 May 2021. date, estimated 14.0 million first doses Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine 24.3 million first doses COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca administered, around 10.6 million 13.4 million second doses Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca respectively. approximate 0.4 million first doses COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna also 26 May 2021, UK, 64,450 Yellow Cards reported Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 188,589 reported COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, 2,469 COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna 716 reported brand vaccine specified.


tldr: 

* 24.6m doses Pfizer/BioNTech
* 37.7m doses AZ
* 0.4m doses Moderna You’re absolutely right! definitely need stop dependent them. Idk man… can’t trusted fear it’s going get worse. hope I’m wrong. see, thx. means still need wait one two months see result? need 2nd dose another 14 days full immunized. mean already get 2nd dose? Depends watch. Frankly I’ve watched YouTube types pull actual laws read go things spun sides aisle. certainly helps screen full context. influenced look laws waste time watching news sources actual legwork.

It pretty scary many journalists don’t actual leg work rely circulating articles Twitter. minute got mixed-up fragile collective identity, US immunity timeline done Yes, exactly saying. rate severe symptoms per infected child may still relatively low, i.e. lower seen adults. However, absolute number severe child cases significant without protective measures appropriate care. definitely alarming seen flu.

Here another article: normal response time? PCR should/could 24h rapid test 15 min That’s current hospital cases unvaccinated, right? unvaccinated wearing masks infecting other? ( sarcastic question - everything read it’s virtually unvaccinated cases hospital haven’t found solid data many hospitalizations unvaccinated compared vaccinated. knew reports elderly nursing home patients testing positive vaccination hospitalized.) Individual events cause spikes states it’s prolonged consistent movement people around seasons I’m feeling worried about. 

I SF last year fires bad blotted sun like week left air completely trashed weeks. 

SF downward trend cases weather fires worst here. 

Fires causing people go indoors doesn’t really track cases. Especially peaks SF LA happened largely time went time. fires incidental. link cited sources. Conspiracy vids YT not. viewer suss-out difference. I’m Washington Post subscriber can’t easily get paywall comments like this. Irritating! need worry. Case numbers (at least States) pretty low. got unlucky. might want get rapid give peace mind. assumed insanely bad allergies almost travelled see family got rapid test safe. positive case town (25k+ population) last days. anti-vac colleagues using 3% number suggest vaccines safe.

smh. start refusing treatment unless patient agrees vaccinated discharged hospital (or sign legally binding document saying vaccinated within 3 months, provide proof county, incur increasing fines daily miss deadline.) deny covid treatment unvaccinated people don’t legit medical exemption- period. Give 1 months notice allow people plenty time least get 1st shot. you’re going get severe covid. least, insurance companies deny coverage covid-related treatment people refuse vaccination don’t medical exemption. folks need clear consequences order change behavior - right thing doesn’t matter them. ￼ many vested interests US (and countries well) would make sure health insurance companies positively never allowed charge obese higher premiums. one, would devastate packaged foods soft drinks industries. lots lobbyists disposal.  going planned.. muhahaha 😈   Well check low trust government watch lot YouTube. 

I believe conspiracy theories, like them, like see far go get unsustainable. make entertaining stories. 

I get vaccine soon available me. Yup totally get that, problem stupid people though, they’re stupid lot stubborn too. lol like 21st century CNN would ever employ real journalist understanding reasonable people sincerely interested determining virus made humans currently see either jump animals unintentional leak lab two likely scenarios without strong evidence yet either.

What serious person yet suggesting either intentionally released lab unintentionally leaked lab bioengineering work weaponize virus. scenarios still remain firmly realm disinfo conspiracy theory. know takes show symptoms. say could infected Late September early October? mean sort makes sense. Oversimplifying kind issue.

This aggregate site, link leads article cited sources.

The YT videos Facebook posts flat earth incoming planet xenu government lizards... lead articles cited sources. post plausibility lab leak; whether animal origin lab leak mutually exclusive scenarios.   Wow, definitely different UK doing. Australia continuing use expand AZ use. thought Covax supply going AZ. likelihood ""Diminish need frequent boosters"" case really means ""Eliminate need boosters"" except maybe elderly immunocompromised suppressed responses vaccines. NJ here. Ain't nothin open inside dining fast food front. significance. pro-COVID, anti lockdown/mask/vaccine crowd contort much search way make feel “right.” literally anti mask people mad Fauci saying wear mask February. . . Thank reply. 

In US there's strong message fully vaccinated people concerned transmitting virus others, much CDC recommend vaccinated people get tested covid quarantine know contact positive covid case. Singapore seems much transparent vaccinated people infecting others times. kind messages government give this? people openly acknowledge vaccinated people infecting others public health risk precautions quarantine used? Herd immunity magic number. areas country covid remain endemic disease, others won't. think misunderstanding public policy think ""wait herd immunity drop mandates"" remotely effective realistic US. thought it’s animal human transfer happened lab wild. would people trust government? access generic U.K. gov website could found. you’re trying get read?

Please explain day day life currently impacted practical way restrictions. Pretty sure bubonic plague spreads bodies too. Cases incredibly low ton people vaccinated there, yet still vaccinated people wearing masks outside lmao. guys keep taking chin, incredible.  I’m confused believe now.. thoughts exactly. Japan playing games China passive aggressive possible. could also attempt get nurses Taiwan come Japan refusing help Olympics...but feel like giving China finger kind. Even special exception... one family fully vaccinated, can't another person fully vaccinated house coffee right now. thought supposed say Delta now. SMH Where’s Vietnam’s home grown vaccine then?

Oh, it’s complicated test?

Surely would made twice could.

But don’t infrastructure, tech, means.

And beyond there’s still shortage precursor, vials, syringes current US based production.

Saying here’s make mRNA DOESNT fix anything, infact countries blunder trying start restrict supply year finally add production.

Remember, Pfizer Moderna making vaccine bulk testing it, took long time get production point. I'm 13 days dose #2 (Moderna) woke swimming sweat last night.  I""ve bad throat stuffy last days.

I'm putting together could side effect. number deleted removed posts thread indicates topic able discussed reasonably years come. Chile  Oh feel bad them. Not. even then, wont change narrative, China held accountable Leak theory true. Hopefully suffer side effects   likely time ""smoke show"" ""Hillary"" used sentence. Good point. inspiring never support single payer country people can't behave 10% adults one shot Brazil could use sure That's fine, EU whole banned travel US since early pandemic. people would argue ""*both sides*"" people create obstacles progress people actively trying create obstacles. already immunized, almost one day, like week ago. 148,000 that's whole population, vaccinated adults. elders already received another vaccine study (from normal vaccination program)  get it. Boohoo people first world countries trouble adjusting back regular life meanwhile hundreds thousands dying everyday countries already suffering lot. remember quite bit conservative anit-vaxxers opposed HPV vaccine.  wait herd immunity drop mandates. Also worth noting matter true origin story, still criticize governments taking reasonable measures mitigate pandemic. guess UK pretty good indicator well vaccines protect us variants.  looking county's numbers: Pop 775,000, 81.5% people 12 &amp; fully vaccinated. Feels pretty safe.  No, reason give taxpayer funded vaccines tax payers vaccinated.

Now supply met demand it’s proper time give supply rest world.

And make it, truckload world, that’s perfect. Introverts free continue introverts. *reopening anxiety*, normal.  link underlying survey used measure conspiracy theories? little hard take sorts claims seriously turns one main ""conspiracy theories"" suddenly gains widespread interest. It'd interesting know one ""conspiracy theories"" survey COVID escaped lab. american, totally fine that. vast majority us chance, makes sense offer chance countries.  problem media literacy, much medium used. many people know reliable sources unreliable ones.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  actually said 2030 think O'Toole said 2023. 

They've kind got egg faces we'll likely done September. exactly prime minister saying since last year bothered listen. Charles Darwin entered chat. people claim pro-life. Yeah, think may gotten wrong idea gate Johnson seemed heading covid skeptic direction like Trump. got changed tune, nuanced understanding politics influence (probably obviously) broader sense. Nice hear polarized hellscape here. ever get point life turn free beer ""not good enough"", I've made wrong turn somewhere. Flu symptoms vary widely, like covid.

I've diagnosed flu pre-op blood pull nothing runny nose, verified second test. Interesting large percentage cruisers hold view probably skews democrat, enjoying hobby detrimental environment going cruises. want picture showering? Stop defending anti vaccine people literally killing people putting others danger. There’s excuse it. Conservatives conditioned expect emails always salacious, matter contents are. Depends age group, gender, etc. Normally would say yes since personally know someone stroke seven days after, get woman 30s. trying scaremonge friend would probably think twice even knowing miniscule odds are. I’m talking coronavirus itself. Lol. Sure. get vaccinated, protected, everyone around protected you. 

People may reasons getting vaccinated. may vaccine injuries past (they're rare, common people think). may already virus recovered, natural acquired immunity. may leery mRNA technology (Pfizer, Moderna), never deployed scale has, best, 20 year track record human trials. may concerned blood clot issue AstraZeneca, especially vascular condition. know people, specific health issues, either vaccinated, get vaccinated helped it.

As someone who's infected recovered, think pressured getting unnecessary shot. frankly, vaccines still short supply, I'm going take one away someone needs not. 

And also need consider many people infected recovered without knowing asymptomatic mild symptoms. also immune. 

Herd immunity many people vaccinated. many people immune. myself, husband 3 kids, one tested, we've it. nephew lost sense taste smell 3 weeks early last spring lockdowns. mother (who doctor) 99% sure COVID, severe respiratory symptoms health worker, qualify test time.

This means people tested positive it.

It's entirely possible herd immunity achieved 50% vaccination rate. extended family alone, 5 people who've COVID never tested, one positive test.

If 34 million people US tested positive, based family's experience, could many 170 million people who've immune. suspect lot people getting vaccinated already never knew it. duplicate positive tests, well.

But herd immunity achieved 75% population immunity, we're well way 50% vaccination rates.  exactly ever asked Europe help with?   Trump Boris really alike. I'm Boris fan politics mostly closer democrats really Reddit twitter say otherwise. 

I think momentum huge, even people early may saying I'm sure I'll get want person it. 

Also hard long lockdowns although things alot better want go back want see restrictions lifted asap. know sure yet, right? impression could still develop mild case even vaccinated, thing vaccine trials tested prevents serious case would require hospitalization.

And true kind imply people develop symptoms spreading disease? vaccine boosts immune system point fight virus better different people whose immune systems strong enough fight vaccine?

Here's source claiming COVID spreads people without symptoms. Thank you! Interesting perspective. wondered impact NHS too. lot people US can't routinely access healthcare many trust - imagine impact.  looked fit fly multiple providers, highest found £89. Get numbers right. attitude difference UK US. Everyone know desperate get vaccine soon can. refuse read anything even slightly challenges worldview. bet you’ll say it’s everyone else willfully ignorant, right?

I’ll keep short sweet distill question one sentence: **if willing demand vaccine hesitant assume risk taking vaccine, won’t demand pharmaceutical companies?

If vaccine safe carries risk, certainly pharma companies developed vaccines would feel totally comfortable shedding legal immunity protects accountable possible ill effects may result taking vaccines, right? Lots rural red areas. progressive and/or educated others. Ugh, lot national pride around lot wrong things. Yes, militiamen chopping arms vaccinated children clearly aren’t ignorant. Lmfao part states they’re coming exchange rate wrong. people amount would ideally want pay. This

As someone extremely bad Trypanophobia panic attacks around them, get violent (have done past unfortunately) 

have gone centre past left without due issues, even Xanax 

Many people like want thing get lives, simply unable to, sure, outside perspective it’s easy judge claim issues easy get around, it’s not

Why could I’m asleep house? get side effects thing point it’s needed means don’t vaccine 

For now, gotta hold onto hope non needle version Literally nothing changed, meaningless label. You’re even allowed purchase clothing. I’m sure measures extended. different? whole goal vaccines confer benefits post-infection immunity coding one specific protein instead fight entire replicating virus. hope creates memory cell response infection. shopping correctly figures come with.

I agree testing UK ridiculous there's need exaggerate costs.  What’s wrong? Three digit average IQ. Everyone doesn’t want free beer please feel free send theirs. I’ll happily drink it. make villain virus suddenly like matter, even though viruses quit, surrender, feelings. Spelling something like surefire way get people take seriously. 3% sounds high, say many 3% partially vaccinated.

If ran around day got first dose, right thing. live small town Saskatchewan we've started walk-ins. run fairly quickly (last one 30-something doses appointments done able open couple hours) nice see supply finally starting catch demand. cool story bro luck, upgradable 6G upcoming booster shots. /s needs go different pharmacy feels wrong me. million dollar prize fine - it’s fantasy prize, whatever. college something sort need you’re teenager. isn’t something dangle front someone induce undergo medical procedure. It’s like offering lottery free meal homeless kids vaccinated. Since there's reason believe large number people get 1st 2nd, we're track end thing one vaccinated countries world. feel like we're going completely normal end summer. could catch since getting keep getting  Red counties. already math 3 months ago.

Red counties infection/hospital percentage of, cases, 30%, LA big blowup, still 10% population. may guess, higher percentage county voted red, also higher infection rate. Oof. :( explains sub weird compared others. already though? sure guys getting info. number expiring tickets credits things Paris aborted honeymoon. September far could push everything without incurring huge losses. Depends bad commute is. :P Toronto, job anywhere outside subway network, pretty much spend least 30-40 minutes driving. way. work hour-drive away, that'd 2 hours day I'd stressing traffic, wasting gas, getting paid that. 

When managers decided get pushy getting back physical office (even though WFH performance better ever), simply quit. Things much less stressful since then. :) need actual vaccines roll out. think vaccines. It’s side funhouse mirror Right they’re reportedly opening tourists restrictions summer. hoping September it’ll fine. also going Disneyland Paris, fully opened July. it? Mild? Severe? would make sense! society would crumble constant emotional duress isolation. Taiwan could accept Chinese Taipei participate international sports, sure accept Chinese Taipei get vaccines. 
Why didnt they? close nothing really known virus.

Dope, never wrong opinions moving target.

This pathetic cop out. conduct groundbreaking research last 18 months effectiveness surgical masks. We've known since latest, summer 2020 asymptomatic transmission virtually non-existent.

Fauci political actor happens medical degree. He's admitted lying, constantly flip flopping, consistently wrong. either credibility trusted.

Claiming ""new evidence"" defense mechanism avoid confronting fact duped. mention we're magically safe *most* US clear. still mutation hotspots world, people dying. concerned humanitarian, concerned World economy trade logistics still screwed. scientist. come family scientists. recommend ask expert! Immunomodulator ms drugs require timing vaccine infusion. one take every 6 months, need wait least 12 weeks get infusion least month get next. friend might drug waiting window. feel like there's lot crossover Left Coast. 

There's STRONG Hawaii contingent Left Coast universities.  wonder they’ll go like chapter names college GLOs, move onto alpha beta, alpha gamma, etc original letters there’s nuts it, numerous friends would die ate nuts gotten vaccinated fine. Also others various allergies, story. Might worth friend getting second opinion, sayin. kinds people already hanging getting sick months earlier. Sorry hear that. coworker 80 traveled India caught Covid there? someone else? Yes, comes across similar kind emotive language govt - drive support vaccines, vs lockdown.

I support both, fwiw, feel he's bit hypocritical here. Plot twist: Vaccine make infection worse they’re unvaccinated still caught now.........they’re lucky. mean, TBF, listened people trying prepare us ""the next flu,"" bad. Well west unlikely force vaccination, something places like China problem doing. early parts pandemic repressive states quite well - west doesn’t work way. Lower vaccination rates west also mitigated generally excellent healthcare systems get something like measles, risk calculation much different third world.

I definitely feel strict forcing vaccines- hope good education enough. seems comment contains 1 links hard tap mobile users.

“They say” it’s 70% population vaccinated?

I call bullshit that, it’s like 57%, California: mask mandate stops June 15th......

I’m happy also weary time. It’s really conflicting. :/ prob got vaccine Totally agree point going hospital unvaxxed bad idea. thank explaining seemed like plausible advice actually not. 

Are US? whirlwind combating misinformation learning go.

Edited auto-mod removed naming color state. sound bit cynical. year world dealing this. think it’s going go away overnight? it’ll fade news landscape? think it’s going take wind down…it take entire world process this. remaining unvaccinated choice too.   Ichabod: headless horseman.

(faints) Cringe. mean body armor 100% effective still hell lot swim trunks flip-flops. worry, get months next plane crash. say like it’s bad thing server lower age group 

True remeber lower age groups already low risk. Makes sense. CDC stop counting COVID cases among vaccinated people? Federal health officials month decided limit monitor vaccinated people infected Covid-19, drawing concern scientists say may mean missing needed data showing mean, spring break surge. paled compared 2020. saw surges NJ every time dropped another restriction, let settle kept dropping folks got shots. friday restrictions drop, everything pretty stable. What's best way get vaccine now? co worker finally coming around. two big vaccination sites closed.

CVS?

Edit: San Diego viral safety wouldnt worried vaccinated. would worried whether France would still restrictions(would actually fun travel?)

I would suggest Iceland alternate destination(High vaccination, low restrictions) Bypass: airspeed velocity swallow?  Sister coworker died fully vaccinated.  80 went India hospital beds available time though. 

Of social circle, he's one hard even gotten covid (at least symptomatically) vaccination. seemed like plausible medical advice me.

No, actually terrible. anesthesiologists, particular, wanted people get vaccinated within 48 hours surgery concerned masking symptoms. rapidly shifted ensuring people fully vaccinated elective surgery risks involved.

None anything waiting heal getting vaccinated. Stepping hospital without fully vaccinated point time, really poor idea. admit fact surges holidays. vaccines guarantee get pretty much guarantee go hospital get it. shocked. could predicted this? Kids needles, problem, like since dawn vaccines, tiny scratch half second invasive procedure. love nurses like David Blaine using sleight hand they've done know Step 1. fat.

Step 2. old

Step 3. serious illness.

Then pretty good position. Nothing like Russian Roulette. us young kids.  Right it’s damage letting young kids vaccine vs possible damage kids vaccine millions people taken without serious issues. Windsor mayor unlikely influence US Government. He's somewhat likely influence (albeit still pretty unlikely) Canadian government. Believe me, friend circle pro-vax whole thing shocked us all. men, including partner, still gotten AZ generally urged us women age group get there's another option, sensible. interesting?

Obviously unvaccinated people ones getting Covid. fact number 100% odd lol. Feel pretty confident we’ll damned doesn’t matter, it’s way measure it. Would lock entirety society save single life? No, course wouldn’t. really seem like terrible advice. Ideally patient vaccinated whole series 2 weeks surgery instead day prior That’s scary. hope feel better soon. headline local news station used OP copied over. Antivax real cringe. you’re right. third Easter perhaps?  case 40yo man died Canada clots post AstraZeneca. yes still chance extremely small, may happen vaccine chances sequel corona much higher... time rational go! lol

My wife hand thrombosis last year absolutely forbidden doctor use AZ. Although reason considered priority group appointment Pfizer-Biontech :D Hasn’t Australia kept case counts masks, distancing whole rigmarole?  vaccines available? Hope things change far vaccinations go. far know, absolute contraindications getting covid vaccine besides allergies ingredients vaccine. people listed able get it, though cases concern produce effective immune response. Taiwan DPP vehemently anti-china... US analysts would know zero chance Taiwan switch...

So even made threat, US call bluff. Mostly fine, like rest Europe. Case counts (7 day moving average) dropped 35K start April around 9K still going further. case count lowest since September. Numbers hospitalizations deaths decline way.

A phased reopening businesses activities underway, next phase happening next week. end June, everything except nightclubs open again.

I expect September, much left terms restrictions. Perhaps handgel dispensers store entrances so.   science denier. Half family autoimmune diseases take medication chance making vaccines less effective covid severe (like dad multiple autoimmune diseases including one affects lungs). increase risk vaccinated.

And yes, vaccines 100% effective serious breakthrough cases immunocompromised elderly people see issue wanting maximum protection possible family (i.e. everyone vaccinated one side). Everyone else visiting Gramma issues since fully vaxxed.  mild shock   Something similar happened New Zealand before: know solved trash ""mystery"" (I assumed aerosols). heard transmitting aerosols Covid aerosols linger air 20 minutes hours. realize could float door air another door within 18 seconds. would think viral concentration air would insanely low distance door open seconds, guess I'm going limb here, B1617 appears transmissible; several clusters newest wave infections Singapore linked Delta variant (B16172), like Changi Airport cluster (108 cases) Tan Tock Seng Hospital cluster (48 cases). Cases one more, JEM/Westgate shopping centre cluster (50 cases) tested preliminarily positive B1617.

Damn. heard airport relatively large number fully vaccinated people got infected, know outbreaks/superspreader events associated virus bit concerning several possible index cases fully vaccinated;

Yeah, kidding. understanding MRNAs around [75% effective variant, CEO Pfizer data outbreaks seems support possible index case visited one shopping centres - Westgate - single day (May 6) testing positive following day subsequently sent hospital.

Wait, mean hospitalized one day contracting virus? That's insanely fast. US, since demand currently decline, think it’s fair game get vaccinated right now, regardless antibodies. Mine done 36 hours second shot. not. fringe looney people may way, nothing party. population Canada 3% India alone.

There developing countries much smaller India. Peru example population 32.5 million. They've hit really hard could use vaccines sooner rather later. Pointing India terrible argument. reality Canada make big impact right now. Far domestically. Two Easters ago  Nature take course.  wish Canada. embarrassing burst crying due needle phobia getting vaccinated. least I'm breaking like 15 minute wait seems go seconds lol Absolutely! I’d like see side-by-side comparison. Would useful discussing anti vaxxers. fuckin point vaccine? Yep. live shithead side Wa State. Macrobreweries want one thing, disgusting they're going lengths get photo showering     dad electrical engineer works Hewlett Packard mom high school diploma. siblings also engineers. 

Yeah pastor told mark beast vaxxed people die vax two years. also falling q anon rabbit hole. 

It's making feel depressed. I'm purple sheep family moved far away long time ago. want get vaxxed see stop worrying them. 64 prime targets covid love going mega church full unmasked antivaxxers. tests 100% accurate  true. friends thought crazy never going inside even shop groceries. Everything delivered. taking chances covid. virus already fucked ear big time. need covid another number me. I've stores again. I'm afraid. still wear mask respect others. mean seemed obvious wouldn’t happen lawsuit ongoing anyways. least insisted due quality strictly delivery issues. Wait, knew Covid least symptoms came work? fired that. shows care people (or serious issues), boss would redflag employer. peru worse Mexico, Colombia &amp; Argentina falling cliff moment compound efficacy reduced transmission rates, reduced hospitalization rate, basically 100%. 99.995% technically 100% basically is. point people going getting severely sick people would died flu common cold.  cases, 11 fully vaccinated:

(Life insurance another matter - they're allowed consider pretty much whatever want far health history.) turn corner - horizontal vertical, straight up. even get plaster! I'm person wrote that, know two people MS work doctors find right window vaccinate based medications. One finally got first dose week another waiting till certain window. So, point, unvaccinated still running errands her. ask personal medical information beyond offered. said know eager get it. seems similar people getting advice oncologists works treatment Unless they're trumps emails coworker close friend advised get figure autoimmune thing she’s got going on. hopes get it, don’t want yet could cause sort flair up. Unfortunately nowhere near control whatever happening body flared last week.  vaccines paid federal money can’t exported states. Makes sense, otherwise, US states could accept kinds things federal government resell them.  something reliable recent?

Fauci ""If deficient vitamin D, impact susceptibility infection,” said Dr. Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases. “I would mind recommending, myself, taking vitamin supplements.”

Which good *general* advice says nothing specifically COVID-19. I've tested, Vitamin deficiency like lot people 50, I've supplementing years. Vitamin pushed specifically miracle preventative COVID-19 based poor evidence. Many, many people sub still arguing masking spite updated CDC guidance. shit Sherlock believe second vaccinated, caught it, is. thought would, sort fake 'til make scenario. vaccinated now, would highly recommend taking small steps reintroduce things enjoyed before. things ramp back up, less chance get back normal pace. recent preprint finding recovery covid followed 1 dose Pfizer produces higher persistent antibody levels 2 doses Pfizer someone never COVID.

See [Influence past infection SARS-CoV-2 response BioTech/ Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine health care workers: kinetics durability humoral compared antibody responses two doses BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine HCWs laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection vaccination (experienced HCWs) HCWs previously infected (naive HCWs). Results: Seven days first vaccine dose HCWs previous infection experienced 126 fold increase antibody levels (GMC 26955 AU; 95% CI 18785-35125). However, HCW naive group response much lower 5 showed positive antibody levels AU). HCWs previous infection significantly increased antibody levels second dose significant increase naive HCW group (16 fold; GMC 20227 AU; 95% CI: 15179-25275). Approximately two months completing vaccination, level antibodies much lower naive HCWs (GMC 6595 AU vs. 25003 AU; p&lt;0.001)

Chances good true vaccines.  

As boosters, right nobody knows happen.  Vaccine makers testing various formulations dosages multiple options available turn necessary. Testing random sample population irrespective symptoms. would tell true incidence infection. Comedian 👍 Enough suspicion though Fauci Biden openly support investigation. chose vaccinate first dose instead give people protection rather 0. 

It excellent decision backed science results amazing. youth vaccination rates good well eventhough started

We also higher risk groups like healthcare workers get fully vaccinated sooner. wife fully vacinated since February since nurse, got first dose near end April appointment second dose currently end July , probably sooner vaccines have

Feds done amazing job !  I'll fun giving shit fellow human rather putting others risk selfish convenience. Might sent soon. Ten minutes later, US announced send vaccines Taiwan. Japan also sending vaccines. Correct one greatest conspiracy theories, ""lab leak"" hypothesis supported even Fauci Biden administration. understand concerns benefit outweighs risk, eyes. don’t know effects virus body we’re seeing pretty significant adverse effects already. proof coworker proudly four completely unvaccinated children yet accepted COVID vaccine herself. I'm glad got vaccinated, enigma. ...what? First doses basically done across country already, 2-3 million new doses delivered every week; second doses moved many weeks. Quebec cut interval half, Alberta already started rescheduling appointments. saying true since early April. ""The CDC tends change things though day day. issue need make messaging consistent.""

Followed by: 

""I take word it""

Goodness. Covid main concern thought process like that. That's MLK - seemed work him.  


/s media tried *very* hard paint picture federal government totally failed procuring vaccines, true. got slightly slower start countries domestic production capacity, rapidly surpassing countries vaccinations anyway. 
“After single dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, people prior COVID-19 infection antibody levels similar people without prior infection two vaccine doses.
The results, need confirmed large, diverse populations, may point strategy stretch currently limited supply vaccines COVID-19.” probably take comfort knowing you’ve got substantial immunity covid receiving one dose; however, receive second dose. fully vaccinated point, isn’t enough data determine long effective immunity would receive one dose series. Firstly can. Americas all. nice easy Monroe doctrine US also take responsibility.

Secondly control spread virus often leads new variant. Sooner later variant might pop existing vaccines work.

Then new variant eventually spread US causing mayhem death again. And? Cases, hospitalizations death plummeting like rock thrown pond, strategy getting many first doses possible clearly worked. Plus provinces start shifting focus second doses week, we're gonna see fully vaccinated number start shoot almost vertically graphs. stand higher percentage fully vaccinated people US end summer. liked movie. watch every October. Christina Ricci witch trying protect Ichabod. Upper Crust town ones actually summoning Horseman (who played Christopher Walken. Heat shock proteins, bruh!  Nailed it.

Also: ""masks work."" Personally lol'd fine piece advice CDC. Wonder many died it. sides stupid people.  entire mentioning ""US citizens regardless nationality"" meaningless

I say ""US citizens regardless nationality"". used terms two different sentences contexts. read article, I'm relaying NPR June 1, anyone age 12 older anywhere around world get vaccine Alaska.

If inaccurate misleading information, take NPR. reason thought newsworthy. continue good show. Lower numbers, less alarming  I've wrong several times. recognized wrong changed opinion. people ever done that?

Most conspiracy nuts going get vaccinated. argument, appeals reason, coddling, bribery work. go around them. Might well mock make feel like shit much possible. know discussing vaccine virus, quote provided discussing bacteria right?

Also source: ""Natural immunity coronavirus fortunately quite strong. vast majority people infected produce least antibodies immune cells fight infection. evidence far suggests protection persist years, preventing serious illness, reinfection.""

I time read entire article, find source actual study coms conclusion title article suggests. think it’s simply American people lost confidence American neighbors…

People simply can’t trust others right thing, pushback mask, restrictions, vaccines. US vaccination rates dropped point pulling bribes. mean, yeah, bigger point ""scientific reasoning"" technique, American public school abysmally terrible teaching (or much anything else beyond basic literacy). always response people's reports crap facebook be. site issue, people know use it. Looks good plan covering everything everywhere, lol  Quebec hit target 5.3 million first 500K second doses June 24th, *today*. rapidly catching everyone else, people still showing get jab. dosing interval officially lowered 8 weeks Quebec, may well see totally normal August province. Absolutely outstanding work everyone! Okay thanks. What’s surveillance testing though? available buy... Everyone wrong Covid several points last year half. exception rule.

I feel this. thought sure masks would totally ineffective stopping transmission back Feb/March 2020. I'm glad wrong. often people I'm referring telling watch? ""do research"" folks... meant fly Portugal Sunday that’s drain guess, gutted :( Eyy country list partner recipients. Thanks USA, need help get actually destroy Covid floating around air entering room. Use power good. Here's CA. Huh! grew Bellevue TIL Island County thing, also apparently liberal. think island(s) went San Juan Skagit counties.

Where one find affordable house West half state¿¿¿¿¿ say so. fun face masks lmao  many people trust experts, especially constant shifting expert opinions various topics throughout crisis.

For record I'm fully vaccinated choice.  RIP Dr. Fauci then. takes way recommended dosage. Yeah dont know put second phrase lol. think hard time disagreeing people know need change that. Damn. Thanks. fun hundreds deaths According Bloomberg we've hit 2 Billion worldwide doses!

1.6-1.8B: 7 days (May 28th)

1.8-2B: 6 days (June 3rd)

7 day worldwide average around 35M/day, great stuff. Getting enough vitamins help, mega-doses particularly fat soluble vitamins quite harmful.  Rogan promote panacea, said people supplement reduce risk. now, vaccines made Moderna, Pfizer Johnson &amp; Johnson distributed, official told likely exposed fully immunized. daughter would exposed 2-14 days symptoms. would likely around environment getting exposed (as parent taking care young child would likely be).

Without NPIs that's true all. making shit wait. EU finishes, COVAX drowning vaccines. keep science places opening back many people one dose.. quick search.. there.

We're ahead issue time compared last time. Reading title made happy last three words... That's reassuring study, thank you! think would ever claim 100% right everything  lot people hard time it. compassion. relatively large country current vaccine production Canada really nailed vaccine purchasing.

Any lawyer worth salt would happy Yeah agree you.

But regarding Seychelles, wrote post before. hard conclude 57% Sinopharm 43% AZ. really think testing capacity/limitation plays huge role here. Basically test hundred, hundred new positive also like monitoring Serbia's data. see graph still test \~10K people day daily new cases dropped less 300. positivity rate way down. need look 2 stats together draw conclusion. I'm really interested country's positive rate data anyone link. Oh, 2 billion people suddenly died, HMMM. lol... fr though raw meat human waste/body fluids worry sanitizing after. That's ignorant. Many people conditions prevent taking vaccine due anaphylactic risk. MCAS, autoimmune disease, previous vaccine injury, etc. little respect people medically unable stop harming ostracizing them. they’re looking removing indoor mask mandate next week. It’s over. Get rid mask mandates domestically. Extremely frustrating decided completely scrap J&amp;J, can't let people choose want not? would gladly take used herbs cow.   Let Taiwan bypass Biontech Chinese influence 

No. Taiwan want make Biontech vaccines political. BioNTech Fosun deal exclusive distribution rights greater China totally commercial contract. Taiwanese politicians make huge fuss . 

To honest , time, feels terribly suspicious Taiwan top officials this.

Well first excuse valid long second one pathetic. third one give people one logical reasons, even reason get it. Admitting wrong changing opinions new evidence comes foreign concept people attacking Dr. Fauci e-mails. Or, new data came showing asymptomatic spread significant factor everyone realized masks useful disease all. immune system reacted vaccine way, think virus without vaccine would done.

Also could backfire always blew mind watch people use public restroom walk without washing What's joke this? angry they're removing restrictions? seems like good time remove restrictions. Verking......it's verking..... Yeah, no, complete tossup. northern rural counties way past 70% threshold 18+, counties right next 43%. difference political affiliation number deeply rural communities. cities varied, (Kings County vs Queens County, example). Im sure prevents serious illness. peaks averaging 3-4 deaths per day. Right averaging 20 deaths per day.  Covax use money buy vaccines though.  99.6% chance survival, low longterm complications rate. like odds. I'm never around elderly people...I hang around lot people, general, I've already covid, already long term, durable immunity. Since severe autoimmunity MCAS, recorded adverse event TDaP small... vaccine presents significant risk me. Several immunologists said this, want try refute one. I'll wait long term data, *if* ever get it.

Seems like risk analysis little neurotic. think people Yale know anyone sub I’ll leave here.  Hopefully move 28-29 year old imminent, grandparents calling every day asking I've offered yet got wound worried it. You’re coming conclusions agenda push. Yeah always going to. nothing morons turning free, potentially life-saving vaccine. pathetic is. Medical debt shouldn’t punishment even moronic level behavior. stop articles? already getting boring Thin herd. Yes 100% guy watched pandemic first hit  It’s abundantly clear culture unfit real hardship like total war. though? Oh blame anti vaxers certain political groups websites etc pump lies covid masking etc. murdered BiL far I'm concerned.

The defence people past masks social distance enough save family member sadly. clearly superior protection vaccines.

The anti vaxxers think restrictions going away 4th July pretty much. fear anymore. innocent people before. Kinda like poetic justice I'd say. 

I feel bad medical people deal though. get used it. Usually pretty quickly believe it! /S 1) one hand, US really care couple hundred taiwanese dying. amateur numbers comparing USA's anyways. 

2) hand, Taiwan easily fix vaccine problems. tens millions BionTech vaccines get , chose technically shanghai-based reseller , Taiwan politicians want seen ""bowing evil Mainlanders"". Imagine wanting eat inside fast food places. Every company follow sure: [Amazon Starts Testing UK Staff COVID must one people believe vaccinated infecting non vaccinated sterilization death. Yes, like still get flu getting flu shot. symptoms (in cases) much, much mild.  Also around 75% adults least 1 dose. fuck talking about? COVID -19 vaccines go animal trials human trials time. Neither resulted death(J J side effects less likely getting struck lightning nobody taking one now). saying true, we'd seeing everyone dying right half damn country one dose. Quit living fantasy world use critical thinking skills instead relying anecdotal evidence. far, Canada vaccinated 58 per cent total population least one dose, putting country behind Israel, plateaued around 63 per cent population, roughly neck-and-neck U.K. 


Go go Canada! I'm confused effectiveness protection thing seems like playing semantic games. event going mess,smh: [First Olympic National Team Arrives Japan Despite COVID lot University lectures science documentaries reputable channels 90 minutes long... California here. In-N-Out Chipotle half capacity least that's seemed like. Obviously wrong way count cases severely undercounting testing capacity enough. government show correct current day number make correct decisions. countries log daily cases counting date test result comes day sample collected.

I'm sure whole reasoning, window dressing. 7 day average covid cases Israel 16 lol things still place social distancing masks shops. Again, fact think year covid restrictions even remotely like sort prison sentence problem. Gritty say matter? rest fucking idiots choose believe hoax thin ranks

So poor regulations + false information caused terrible mistake. strategy one shot? fully vaccinated rate 5% so? They've previously said would exported approved. likely approval includes validating factory already manufactured batches important make sure give away bad juice.

That could change though. say 1/8, I'd inclined 1/5th, maybe even 1/4th China bunch CanSino 1 dose, arent gonna vaccinate 100% world population, even closely gonna happen. 60% world would ideal (around 9-10 Billion doses) Shit happens, man. Plenty people also done very, well past year. Sorry friend GP stuck still 40s 45s reason. booked attend vaccination centre went super quick well organised. 
A friend mine got jab booked pharmacy nearby go smaller places choose want go online. wait GP may waiting long time. panic.

There weak data supporting link OTC painkillers reduced vaccine response; recommendation abundance caution.

survey article here:  little thread made first time 5 years somewhat happy American vaccinated Moderna, let's say come contact someone Covid get sick (since vaccine 95%), could still test positive covid PCR test? Locking veering topic/politics.  produce vaccines invent any. That's bigger problem one administration. choice plan following 2 Moderna shots inactivated virus version ... booster needed. approved ones though. Tell anti-vaxxers we're explicitly giving **their** shots away people outside US, maybe get running vaccines.

Also, nice touch would tell recipients vaccine donated so-and-so anti-vaxxer. help others? helping 1/3 population access vaccine. ""top economy"" supposedly home ""best healthcare world?""

Considering vaccine rollout completely fumbled here, point millions unable schedule appointments months, months time goes excess vaccines going unused, tells went wrong way.  anyone explain right win talking point Fauci’s usage “gain function”?

I see time comments idea saying Typing camal case mock people bitchiest thing internet. Preach.

We center *universe*, Canada! Well yeah. last two days went couple populated events, like 10-20k people. Nobody wearing masks, great fun, concert baseball game. 30 percent morons either event vaccinated going taking virus home families. 

""Hurrdurr vaccination personal choice.""

Yes, is. choice 1. Get vaccinated. 2. Wear mask. 3. Kill loved ones. Less effective terms allowing particles in, masks still block some. meant airborne transmission reduces efficacy social distancing measures, masking key could infected someone much farther away expect, space previously occupied infected person. importance increased people mixing more.

That's CDC said children 5 wear masks, even pandemic's peak. cost development worth then, now.

You even know cost benefit means terms actual numbers. leave experts. horrible this, can't think critically. horsebell! seen many neighbors choose what's convenient what's right. makes hard trust general assuming far much countries. Considering Vietnam developed faster covid testing kit half time estimated WHO, definitely places technology ability make vaccines forced develop US UK companies lift monopoly vaccine production  might channels called? definitely want report every single one bullshit conspiracy videos, definitely plan /s. late bought them, many.

EDIT: Doug Ford saying thing. conservative premiers attacking Liberal government ridiculous attempt deflect blame epic failures handling pandemic. Nobody actually buying saying. money  thought we'd see increase cases week holiday weekend. spread holiday - people might put getting test testing stations reporting data holiday, would get data dumps mid week.

That doesnt seem case - awesome case counts last days extremely low given us first doses, reports say longer delay doses producing better results too!  no, false last year. ""plausible."" 13th day 2nd dose I've weather since Tuesday (cold symptoms bad throat).

Nevertheless, risks covid risks associated children overlooked neglected:

1. Long term effects still unknown.
2. Occurrence serious symptoms may similar flu. vaccines available flu covid virus yet.
3. importantly, covid virus spreads lot faster flu. rate serious pediatric covid cases per infected child may similar flu. However, number serious child cases much higher without safety measures.

This isn’t making meth RV.

It would take well year infrastructure know waiting build lines, don’t. you’d need technical know produce vaccine, don’t either.

So 2-3 years you’d production up, meanwhile pandemic lines useless. went away day election, remember? Misunderstood post. I'm assuming meant fucked year ear haha afraid neighbors, then? far right trying say Dr. Fauci partisan, siding China early stages pandemic. Instead unbiased driven ""science"" claim manipulated, naive trust global health experts. They're pointing dismissal lab leak theory, well &amp; WHO's recommendation masking early weeks pandemic. Right ultimately trying say Dr. Fauci's guidance infallible trust judgment, especially head towards endgame vaccination campaign. Vaccinate people first!!

Until reach 70% least. discussion lab leak theory banned sub? Today we’ve seen extremely well researched exhaustive Vanity Fair article top get black holed. one many submissions disappeared sub.

For example, B117 linage B first case Washington State linage A.

Linage found one wet market Linage B found famous Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.

So order lab leak theory work, one researcher get infected, go one wet market spread linage couple days, go another wet market spread linage B. Somehow two three days, covid-19 evolved within researcher Linage Linage B.

More likely scenario group animals sold infected along way. transport different wet markets. Mmmm, don’t forget there’s shortage precursors even weren’t case would take months stand new production lines, especially cutting edge tech like mRNA vaccines. far know anarchists know got vaccinated. true IQ test vaccinated antivaxxer - 80 million end June

- Plans announced first 25 million

- 6 25 million toward strategic allies including Canada, Mexico, Korea, India (who also get COVAX portion donation) smaller countries.

I'd guess best case scenario we're looking extra 2M June, unless something radically different unplanned 55M.  Well COVAX-destined doses likely donations low-income countries. Canada likely involve allowing US companies fulfill orders, likely case high-income nations.

Regardless, world vaccinated everyone's best interest let doses go waste. economic impact pandemic alone makes clear even USA freely donating doses, would still economically best interest. would maybe think it’s combination infected workers lab animals went wet markets. Hell know infected person could infected animals wet market. assumes 'opening up' binary thing unvaccinated people currently interacting normally. are. Plus options buy doses need them.

And world needs better prepared. started Trump. absolute cancer Republican party. might remember ran platform vaccines causing autism back 2016 even got debate Ben Carson (a freaking pediatric surgeon) called bs. None candidates vaccines-cause-autism bandwagon.

Then Trump suddenly Republicans started changing minds everything. Suddenly Russia cool, always hating them. Suddenly free trade bad tariffs good. Suddenly vaccines bad (which still weird Trump's admin funded getting mass produced testing ongoing (operation warp speed) Trump got vaccinated early on). someone right-leaning moderate conservative, extremely frustrating watching Trump completely destroy Republican party.

Taiwan model control pandemic, recent spike domestic infections increased need inoculate people faster.

During video call international media Japan, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu repeated complaints China, claims island territory, hampered efforts secure vaccines, kept Taiwan excluded World Health Organisation.

So far, Taiwan received Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) vaccines. Wu said government ""negotiating individual companies like Pfizer"" J&amp;J, expressing confidence domestic vaccine rollout.

""When vaccines rolled toward end July, think become important supply vaccine demand Taiwan,"" Wu said.

Responding Reuters request comment, Pfizer said: ""As Taiwan outside scope Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine collaboration agreement BioNTech, refer BioNTech questions matter.""

BioNTech immediately respond request comment.

And deaths aren’t part it. kids hospitalized Covid flu. Don’t come IE, *definitely* meet some. people still hospitalized even dying getting vaccine?

I laughed hard loud answer I've absolutely never conservative, even teenager living there.  stat also doesnt break whether remaining 3 percent fully vaccinated. Theres good chance lions share people exposed prior 2nd vaccine, even possibly first one. That's true, they're looking [a 16% reinfection Still pretty low, insignificant, considering people died reinfected.

I understand something super alarmed about, take seriously people may die via reinfection pretty damn serious.

Everyone get vaccinated safe. watch lot YouTube, Dr. John Campbell's videos. Highly recommended. Finland's population density much drastically lower UK's situation can't really compared.  grandparents lived Hawaii 12 years 80s/90s. Man absolutely loved visiting summer. much fun everyone SUPER chill time. Pleeeeassse give attentioooon!!! dude, read article. vaccinations sure help, research pointing towards body continuing create antibodies virus year, even without vaccination. reinfection cases incredibly rare it’s even worth discussing, people want run around act like sky falling understand can’t let guard down, it’s annoying many countries won’t let vaccinated people travel, even getting tested contact tracing. UK requires ten day quarantine $1000 testing pocket. needs clearer messaging

This study shows children bear risk society opening without vaccination. Lifelong Oregonian here. parents still live rural hometown shitshow. Thankfully parents vaxxed. live much-more populated West side state county *almost* 70%. shit Yeah, logically makes sense. results demonstrate relaxing social distancing measures vaccinated individuals would minimal impact incidence, extending guidelines individuals adequate vaccination children could fuel rapid rise COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations, deaths.4 Furthermore, mounting incidence makes emergence additional variants concern likely, potentially compromising efficacy vaccines.5 findings important policy implications control pandemic. Given children might vaccinated 2022, unlikely coverage fully vaccinated individuals aged 12 years older would confer sufficient herd immunity July 4. bank benefits vaccination, avert additional pandemic waves, facilitate sustainable resumption social economic activities, urge cautious approach updating COVID-19 guidelines coming months, especially given emergence highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants.6 study underscores risks prematurely lifting measures, borne disproportionately individuals yet vaccinated. airline never flying mainland china lol 

what costly mistake Biden Fauci using lab leak hypothesis political gain advantage China. It’s based science. wish reasonable answer give regards travel ban, don't. news US lifting time soon, bizarre given countries still allow direct travel whilst banning countries vaccinating en masse.

Lastly, nothing inyour post changes K sakd regarding Fauci. say things. cool thank you! wanted thank everyone answering questions relaying experiences vaccine. got first jab yesterday feel fine (kinda sore arm tho lol). yeah I’m reading stats correctly there’s like less 1% chance reinfection happening… even worth talking point. 1 20 seek help means 1 60000 problem (in specific group) even pretty easily resolved. antivaxxers galore AZ problems.  thing though, cleaning really make difference whether got Covid not. mother spinal surgery right second vaccine scheduled, doc didnt huge reasons wait comfort, waited extra week got second shots together. schools, public private, require students vaccinated prior starting classes. students medical complications cannot would exempt, it. free passes caring others, want spaces 20+ people. I'm sorry happened cousin. 

Disability term used often refer drastic conditions - blindness, deafness, paralysis - also apply condition difference someone may ""the norm"" puts place where, without adequate accommodations, could carry complete tasks others able unassisted. cover rather broad spectrum things, including pregnancy, neurodivergence (autism, ADHD, DID), ALS, tons more. often forgotten community. Again, that's downplaying mask effectiveness. downplaying mask protectiveness. really accurately describing protectiveness. You: hospitalisations rising

Me: that's completely normal

You: feeling personally attacked someone added comment. Yeah otherwise antimaskers could lie vaccinated Well, AZ first case potentially deadly outcome, unlikely may be, casually connected vaccine. 
Also AZ missteps early stages (you'll remember half dose blunder Brazil, also apparently reluctant producing data regulatory authorities) resulting vaccine approved FDA US. One actually practical. really stems Americans liking people tell do. wearing mask huge inconvenience. courtesy fellow humans instead treated symbol oppression.   Wow! risk contamination, painful easily distributed. easily solve many issues current process develops further. OP better King County? Headless Horseman apparently Christopher Walken! Why? Children aren’t risk covid. illness activities (swimming m) way dangerous. mean know kids personally bad case covid died it? Noting changed since cruise ship events early 2020. illness affects old people. Kids typically coronavirus it’s normal part childhood. trust safer. Going back normal masks gatherings though. Hungary lowered waiting 4-6 weeks. got first jab May 7th get second June 18th. still understand many countries started reject AZ... I've heard plenty rumors Pfizer too... news came Israel cause hearth inflammation sources I've heard make young women infertile. still restrictions Pfizer badly really need attention? Honest question. clearly want people pay some



Also literally nobody cares dont want vaccinated sick dying kids Texas Florida?  states open months. sound like conspiracy theorist. Huh.... weird focused protection plan? hope sensible, worry ending like US vaccination numbers crashed they're every gimmick think desperately get people vaccinated. that's place lost half million people, NZ we've lost 26 nearly elderly people dementia two nursing homes. 

Our hesitant population Maori population they're also far risk outbreak. TV ads vaccination right almost exclusively target Maori result, telling successful they'll be. 

I hearing lot anecdotal stories middle class professional people typical anti-vaxxers saying ever get vaccine though. Life normal easy totally forget there's pandemic going beyond borders. breeds huge complacency I'd rather outbreak change that. Yeah, way police enforcement. expect people stay home enforced? cops roaming street ready ticket people outside homes. Anything less true lockdown. end well concern right now. Everyone house vaccinated except 2 year old. 

If catches virus, expect die it. worries stories people still experiencing smell /taste / neurological issues months recovering. long term side effects something ignore. one acting like eradicated virus adults already come realization eradication possible. people acknowledge likely good gets. (In US) Vaccines widely available walk practically anywhere get one. There's point worrying preemptively variants. far, vaccines shown effective every one them. might come day that's longer true true today I'm living life pretty much pre covid. course alternative keep living unvaccinated keep waiting variant current vaccines protect against. focused protection plan? 1 3 experienced quarantine isolation? will. TPB Letterkenny. ask. Oregon Washington? life sucked last year lockdowns prevented going graduate school, need reassess priorities too? nerve comments.... Maybe read paper would understand important Oh no! …. Anyways…. ... ... argue seatbelts speed limits, you, people die crashes 5mph. hate food safety regulations safe food weakens immune system.

But terms providing herd immunity whole country - seems effective Yeah, got 2nd shot 19th, fully vaccinated yet. work instantly, know- body builds response. likely caught days prior 31st.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* might well believe seat belts human decency. Starting become apparent many places testing varients all. Makes wonder part reason positivity rates declining simply varients testing becoming dominant. FDA told us January old tests give false negatives varients, June many regions still updated testing. thought Sinopharm's real world data shows works see data country like Serbia 70% used Sinopharm. people questioning Sinovac Chile's numbers. question hosptials full say FDA approved seem ""know"" someone died shortly shot. Also already Co-Vid say antibodies. Two weeks away two weeks away That's untrue. minister also said keep offering Janssen (J&amp;J) vaccine difficult-to-reach populations like homeless people, people working ships, etc. imagine countries offering 2nd dose vaccines would extremely difficult expensive. Suriname extremely remote villages thing would come play. Also, minister made decision ICU maximum capacity scenario. Suriname currently turn patients hospital, would welcome basically vaccine right now. logic aplied variant efficacy work like that. pfizer sinovac made way, sinovac vaccine uses inactivated virus, efficient variants. brazil tests made clear. chile problem that, said, 2 doses sinovac vaccine effective, people chile already going it. don’t really intend make travels public, say prices ranging beginning Jan - end March

It £169 get €20 + £169 come back. 

That’s lot money average Joe like education system making antidote?

I public school education ability think critically gained it. society failing large swaths people come 12 years school nothing show it?  Well there’s highly upvoted comments referring “rural shitheads” aren’t getting vaccinated, perhaps similar grace may shown inner city residents aren’t getting vaccinated? Right lowest vaccinated groups black Hispanic. really depends. areas *very* strict allocation. wealthiest people know got shots way. 

Thats say Tucker Carlson specifically volunteer rich people did, definitely did. kind like rich guys go play cop year ""law enforcement"" allowed carry guns virtually anywhere everywhere. find one little podunk area opening, able get there, possibly make political donation whoever charge. volunteer time isnt obvious. 

There instances officials selling slots places around country. got caught. didnt want get caught, would created plausible deniability. Hi, I'm Anheuser Busch. send pic Haha yeah, study medicine, know VFU part. Luckily us site hospital. 

I feel you’re saying. fall last semester VFU starts. It’s unfortunate cause lot on-site practical skills sessions canceled, feel way less prepared going VFU should. Yeah, fuck guy who's trying actually talk people instead listening overarching generalities media, amirite? also paper published recently: [People believe COVID-19 conspiracy theories tend struggle scientific reasoning, study Link something behind paywall? believe seat belts? motorcycle helmets car safety seats kids or.....etc. See? one confused. Americans (and countries) told wear cloth masks prevent spreading coronavirus around them. wearing mask protect you, protects around you. everyone wearing one, protected. negative? Things go back normal end, might take time will. Covid always stay, like viruses. long vaccinated won’t huge problem now. even begin this. 

There equally evidence supporting natural event.

I trust word... Air-transport safety depends transparancy, yet plane crashes everyone lies teeth.

It would better scientists conflicts interest would stop swaying public opinion, matter direction is. Nobody positive COVID test could fly domestically mainland China. Good thing lasting year testing virus widely available first several months. Nothing worry all. wake coma? Well kinda understandable bc say need 21 days second dose develop full antibodies/max protection, right?  Even all, 160 fully vaccinated people breakthrough infection died study period. That’s 2% breakthrough infections, 0.0001% U.S. residents fully vaccinated April 30. 160 people ages 71 89. bunch coworkers say want bother too. store walk right get shot time day. know what's wrong people. handful us vaxxed. holdouts happy pigs mud wear masks anymore. can't changed subreddit get deleted.

All needed without aggressive bits :) bill gates turns control chip, Reddit picks turns automatically. would hope since taking vaccine allow get it. Lol true!! thats great right? sounds like good job preventing vaccinated. skurd, get vaccine. leave dont want alone, called loved ones sound safe, ya?  pretty depressing see much we've digressed species... mean, eradicated small pox US 1948. Nearly 75 years ago.

I guess successfully eradicate viruses using vaccines long enough, people forget like live unvaccinated world take granted?  stop wearing them. issue 65 year old coworker believes he's immune he's traveled 12 states since July 2020 gotten covid knowledge. yet wants fully vaccinated coworker wear masks much possible still. read stories medical folks saying dying covid patients demanding know really covid hoax. 

I mean millions people unreachable even deathbed. two people family like this. dread day hear infected. 

They never get vaccinated though. Never. one hand, practicing good hygiene, public private leads healthier world us. hand, obsessive cleaning, I.e dressing hazmat suite bathing entire buildings UV light scanners seems tad excessive. wouldn’t gotten Covid you’d worn mask either. Sounds like don’t trust vaccine, either.  talk flu cases I'm using 2019 flu season, 2020 season. Even taking account hospilizations, stats show common flu deadlier makes kids sicker. taking guess. think deprioritized vaccination? never know. “ Nearly causes death – heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes – **correlate** unhealthy microbiomes. So, get signal health officials resume normal life let us mingle – nothing lose masks.”

Probably better understand difference correlation causation going write scientific topics use either term. Except herd leaves county county let’s herds in.  impression subreddit still considers origin discussion limits/conspiracy. 

Has ban lifted?  Right?, chicken juice spilled like three weeks ago bacteria culture thats evolving fast they’re almost spaceflight. Remember...the original Anti-Vax doctor (who longer doctor cause booted bad activity) anti-vax, anti MMR, financial interest stand alone vaccines...he PRO Single vaccines...

yet are. really understand get brainwashed like education access internet.

The former antidote, latter poison.

Head /r/QAnonCasualties. Plenty people degrees ruined lives chasing internet rabbit holes. Oh well guess perfectly safe go life one dose, I'm sure wilfull ignorance protect you. Id listen doctors. else do? Believe freak highschool degree recording podcasts?
The effects corona obvious, Id rather trust German doctors say. First day reddit? Gee maybe China able incorporate authoritarian level forced lockdowns much fewer cases proportionally freed tons vaccines? literally matter US does, entire world hates us already. Barring pure genocide government fluctuations hatred going statistical noise. No, I'm curious see impressions widely available verifiable information decision petulant children, yeah. UK government really need get grip travel advice appears transmissible, don’t know why. air, surfaces, both? don’t know. it’s air, one person said might make contagious measles (fantastic...).

Does someone link article explaining Australia miserably low vaccination rate? well containing virus, surely didn’t think could stop ever evolving virus without mass vaccination. must sensible reason. Huzzah people say every one posts? Besides easy karma grab? fully vaccinated week earlier Pfizer recommended dosing three weeks four (as administered US). Moderna vaccine higher dose, many believe might lead worse side effects, think clear. US, Pfizer EUA 12+, Moderna 18+. said, terrific.  Canada country like other. idea somehow superior mistaken. fact many Canadians understand Canada's racist legacy racist present sign inadequate nation's education system is. US long way go, also beginning acknowledge past. That's say Canada... distinctly remember people sub saying ""just stay home! literally hard, get used it"" last year. People compassion then, comes hesitancy go back normal compassion? 

Going back normal choice, what's happening. say partake world waiting... [The latest guidance U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention says don’t need tested quarantine you’re fully vaccinated, even you’ve exposed someone sick. exception develop COVID-19 symptoms fever, cough  solution stupid easy, least pandemic truly over: Always wear least surgical mask out. effective preventing accidentally touching face. get back home, first thing must do, even letting mask down, wash hands. That's it. gotta realize matter happened vaccines, matter perfect, even covid cases went 0 instantly back january something insane like would still Conservative line ""Justin Trudeau failed country"" something.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* conspiracy. Interestingly enough, exactly type person gobbles everything served (as long something wish true), time claim others spoon-fed media.  upset? exchanging information, trying get better understanding impacts covid young children.

You asked scientific studies comparing covid vs flu children . CDC advices children 2 years age older wear masks: elder people higher need vaccine. mean children need vaccines.  like 2 3 weeks bad news shipment delays months ago seems entrenched people's minds Canada vaccine disaster. Like go around subreddit right still see ""sending thoughts poor Canadian friends"" dumbness.  fiance setting similar. doctor covid patient died, older late 60s obese etc. family demanded know REALLY died of. Infection prevented, moderate severe disease. 

But that's false. MRNA vaccines prevent 90%+ infections, reduce viral load 75%+++ remainder, presumably shorten period contagiousness. Protective immunity ""important"" sterilizing, sterilizing immunity always goal. sick enough hospitalized. wonder insurance.  Nightclubs? Nightclubs still closed fucks’ sake. I’d rioting. Naming country origin imparts context, sense time place, Greek numbers not. Lay people especially want sense time place. 

Journalists erring side communication. Low ability swim belief water dangerous predicts drowning.  Go nightclub? Invite 6 closest friends? Enjoy music festival? Again, I'm giving example country proved capable. rest world cautioned would take years develop another testing kit Vietnam fraction time? fail see making testing kit would easy ""country clean water"" yet making vaccine already done impossible task. 

I know companies working way, I've trying keep informed, information always changes. 

I still dont understand everyone thinks I'm off-base saying US could done better? know screwed domestically, dont consider also screwed abroad well? hate government still got vaccine Yes, reason deleted, already submitted let submit again.

I mentioned mods said resubmit slightly tweaked URL, did. fiance doctor, many covid patients hospitalized get vaccine. common response ""yea guess gotten it""  getting vaccinated something rigorously tested shown highly effective preventing serious disease death incredibly safe - hundreds millions doses delivered. surprised one early reasons given Japan's low infection rates due vaccinating TB. randomly tested things like sports travel. picking lot asymptomatic infections. posted yesterday cannot find posts. wonder deleted it.  way early tell. also depends vaccinated become naturally immune much ""surge"" matters. 80% elderly vaccinated naturally immune, going much problem since others around vaccinated. understand completely agree. fully vaccinated small chance brain sometimes goes...”but adverse impact years road entire world got shot?” Like don’t actively point apprehensions people scare want everyone vaccinated man like .01% chance magnified many people getting shots. like intrusive thought can’t get rid of.  - appetite either. Definitely.   feel like 12 authorization real game-changer reopening society. I'm optimistic future everyone 12 wants one access.  Weaponizing biological viruses seems like could despicable too. That's literal wording used Conservatives one many ""Trudeau Bad"" campaigns. county dropped average 2 cases 100,000, hospitalization 55 percent two week span, text positivity 7 2 percent last month. Covid absolute shambles. high risk (red) extreme high risk (purple) year entire state NJ high risk (Orange) one county moderate risk (yellow). seems soon entire state NJ modedate risk first time year plus. interesting see quickly people drop masks. tell shopping trips I’ve taken far I’ve seen probably 4 5 people wearing masks. Doesn’t really bother much find interesting. Good details age
Vaccination rates still increasing 65+ 75+ good  I'm amazed fast going. Hopefully, means everyone wants shot vaccinated end next year.  high likelihood protected studies indicating mothers pass antibodies unborn children. think set aside fear vaccination. father molecular biologist medical school guess I’m vaccine fan! USA, we've done discovered bodies buried. tragic every time happens, attrocities vulnerable part every country's history.

It's important talk it, Canada good country saves refugees world. really wanna help countries hard hit know what's situation India, Brazil South American countries... Australia zero covid policy they're allowing anyone in, plus soon production. Could anyone possibly point official guidelines New York indoor gatherings? 

My indoor wedding venue telling we’re allowed seat 10 table instead 12 per NYS guidelines also mandatorily prove negative tests vaccinations even we’re 250. can’t find anything online saying either these. Thanks!! :) reason choose pfizer moderna vice versa? Geographic distribution contracts simple. BioNTech owns vaccine. Pfizer Fosun investors BioNTech, paying hundreds millions billions BioNTech. 

In exchange Pfizer contract manufacturer distributor US EU Fosun contract manufacturer (though running yet) distributor China, HK Taiwan. keep portion money sales.

Fosun paid money contract. Taiwan wants take away compensation.

There one way Taiwan gets vaccines. Taiwan work something BioNTech ships vaccines directly pay Fosun full price along contract violation fee.

Anything else would theft Fosun. 2021-06-03 Vaccination demographics update

As vaccines approved regulators, side effects, think benefits still highly likely outweigh risks.

Israel good place look vaccine trends effects one highest rates vaccination far. Thank part...I think US American manufacturers prioritizing country first makes sense, fail see issue vaccines available kids. vaccines 100% effective either. would pretty stupid. sending pretty obvious vaccines political influence, throwing away would look way bad it. would start wave anti-americanism would make middle-east look like US-fanatics.

China already uses vaccines buy influence way successful prioritized full local vaccination program. sure point care guess tomorrow is? Trinidad Tobago.

Vox pretty okay segment that's official statement, I'm asking know reasoning behind I'm sorry happening. Texas barred schools requiring masks. Since 12 set can't get vaccinated, understand thinking. differences. see someone would prefer get one vaccine able unmask travel. also see someone would prefer mRNA vaccine greater effectiveness. know something AZ debacle honestly Australia lagging behind vaccines bit we’re seeing previously unaffected nations like Taiwan Vietnam huge infection spikes getting extra vaccines U.K. won’t bad. vaccine roll made happy American. states proceeded quite smoothly. playing field leveled. We've year become really weird awkward; chase strange dreams slowing down, learning dance, finding ourselves. maybe send That’s pretty much happened every heavily vaccinated country, yes? Happened Israel brief spike US  Israel struggle get much higher. large population ultra-orthodox Jews quite vaccine hesitant. least see even 63% vaccination case rates plummeted open back up, less. enough Chilean regulators. never count virus out, we're seeing positive seasonal effects combined fact 12+ population minimum 75% seropositive (first doses + infections assuming 4X undercount). There's lot hosts left virus go. 

The factor vaccination rates low, testing also low. 5 7 least vaccinated states - Mississippi, Alabama, Wyoming, Idaho, Arkansas - positivity rates 5% (not terrible, certainly great). Idaho Alabama 10% (flashing red positivity rates). Higher positivity rates mean significantly greater case undercounts. states appear pretty good recent per capita cases testing. CDC.gov  trusting anyone else anything? Grey tough concept days. Thanks. Sounds like lottery one. Sorry hear still unwell. Best advice heard talk doctor it. may things going on.

Even better: it’s pretty much established truth point. Everyone studied it, NHS universities, finds vaccination reduces transmission. (This CDC fine fully vaccinated wearing masks.) Yes, It'll interesting see yesterday's numbers come CDC site, expecting 7-day average bump bit numbers caught up. happened numbers keep dropping drop seems accelerating. It’s almost like people hard time even people worse? mom's always anti-vaxx. 

For her, one part ""crunchy granola hippy"" beliefs. paranoid doctors (nearly disowned sister marrying one) afraid severe mental health problems permanent record, (and also want us snitching child abuse, getting CPS called her.). She'd rather cure sprained ankle raw vegan diet, healing crystals, gaslighting.

Darwin handle that... Super happy get change flair today! jump animals unintentional leak lab

You mean either jump animals outside lab jump animals via lab, right? Thats politics America. Objectively incorrect. mRNA vaccines touch semblance DNA. Genes DNA. DNA genes. mRNA doesn’t enter cell nucleus. gene therapy stretch objective truth. fair, donating couple thousand week let’s thousands healthcare professionals get vaccinated. Even extremely small amount help save lives elsewhere. I've stabbed I'm ok. last seconds I've lost blood   AutoModerator weird sometimes, especially filters updated, I'm currently ignoring removals. lot removals AutoModerator, worrying many still unautomated modteam, _doesn't_ filter issues. guess probably one things know _don't_ know sure, current theories polarized point constructive discussion open forum like possible, _especially_ face abundant misinformation pushed certain groups want chaos. Sure. That’s quote piece.

More context, King county, Seattle, full quote is:

“At time, outbreak felt primarily unvaccinated,” Duchin said. “Approximately half million people 12 years age older remain unvaccinated, 97% current cases among unvaccinated people. means you’re unvaccinated, risk COVID-19 actually higher right last Memorial Day.”

The Washington Post says sort thing. pictures don’t show. Scroll text explanation. chance strain virus vaccine work anymore. charity self-preservation. isn’t quite true. COVAX said multiple times struggling procure vaccines. India stopped giving major, major blow even that, couldn’t get them. Donating vaccines COVAX big deal Ontario rescheduling too! think getting enough vaccines 10% eligible population every week pretty damn good. lots supply hand too, like we're running low point. Ontario enough doses hand least 10 days current pace we're getting really next week, sure many people think getting well. [Same thing happened I'm sure happened elsewhere too. feel like normal. fuck trusts government? people fall Nigerian scams right? Ok. it’s shown leak I’ll accept it. it’s shown be, you? people work till can't. evidence may even better two doses vaccine.

On hand, take minor risks vaccines rather one. weird anxiety masks. think it’s uncertainty expectations general anxiety. first dose strategy reason less 1,000 total died since March 23rd.

It's easy lose perspective cases increasing, weekly covid deaths 49, January 9000. I'm sure they're talking background. France Germany willing play ball things start moving.  short term far That's said. Per 97runner, said stay home doctor (and likely workplace) told stay home two weeks. think quite different analogy. like server history awful aggressive behavior, afraid might put food.  know all. 3% looks like. patients disclose unable confirm vaccinated status, patients lied.

My friend local hospital says fairly common standard belief within medical industry majority vaccinated persons getting sick lying status. Hospitals taking people word possible practical confirm. Well could invent time machine go back 1981. Yes, ways. wonder abortion made illegal tomorrow, people would get vaccine next day. doubt it. think people afraid unknown, unknown reasons, even themselves. people best people around them, matter cost. many Military? took WA example, compared data WA dashboard (last updated 5/31) vs CDC's historic data (5/31)

WA Dashboard: 7,071,595  
source: 

CDC Data: 7,653,428   
source: 

Difference = 581,833 , assume two dose vaccines, 290,916 people, WA.

That seems lot military personnel WA?    Well positive thing risk populations really high vaccinations. Deaths hospitalizations remain declining. 

The actually said us vaccinate less risk focus getting countries risk populations. So... works out? No. want get crazy conspiracy people side larger base.  point vaccines keep people hospital. wouldn’t want rely immunity Covid before, recommendations line thinking.

So saying unvaccinated people irresponsible earlier pandemic got infected , probably already immunity, cases won’t increase? thinking? Better Israel 5% better rate first doses, 20% better rate second doses.

So might take another 1-2 months UK catch israel.

Also, Israel used 100% mRNA UK used lots AZ well. mRNA might better reducing transmission, thing counts reducing number cases. Herr Trump must Villian? Absolutely seething. Could well sooner end summer pass states percentage fully vaccinated. hesitancy rate way less north border  hope simply KNOW yet

Except sorta know, given safety tests Moderna vaccine subjects young 6 months old started months ago reported side effects greater already reported. good reason  Weaponizing uncertainty life saving product despicable. evidence far overwhelmingly shows benefits far outweigh downsides. EU agreed donate 100 million doses **the end year**. 

The US agreed donate 80 million doses **the end June**, immediate rollout plan 25 million doses.

It's likely US donate EU year end, given stockpile demand. said, ultimately **global** pandemic. pick fights country / region best ""savior"" absurd unproductive. live Northern California, nearly cases people 18-30 vaccinated. possible variant generators. Yeah that’s strange.

Can go back time 2000? 2 2.9% remaining 3% simply people disclose whether vaccinated human/administration errors tracking.

I friend hospital says patient can't confirm dates manufacturer vaccination enter system vaccinated cofrimed. He'll fine. Fun fact, guy ex-Atheist Evangelical Christian. Much appreciated went watch Champions League final Midtown, bar packed. felt normal. months ago? still going on? would go back ask mom's pulmonologist, made go new lung scans even considering her. sounds like actually problem, Catholics making noise something push anti-choice agenda.

Regardless, least church's stance moral get vaccinated sake protecting others, won't, become hermit. get behind part it, even disagree premise going church decide morality.  lose taste smell? least two articles Asian papers year ago research lab employees, instead euthanizing animals part research process, would surreptitiously take fact local markets sell extra cash. 

That could get away suggested worker(s) question likely politically connected easily disciplined local level. It’s time. don’t know US hoarding these. what? Delaying vaccination rest world delays everyone going back normal need many people vaccinated possible even outside US. Thirty+ book online dude. Go get done! much one dose strategy, simple fact enough supply meet massive demand vaccine, move age groups slowly. 2 dose strategy like US would even away vaccinating young people, biggest spreaders.  haven’t received already, hope get soon fair, (effectively) hospital cases course pandemic unvaccinated individuals. One could assume someone remain unvaccinated summer risky behaviors past year, people immediate contacts probably already got covid capacity. 

That true nearly everyone, like every single unvaccinated person right immunity; good chunk probably past infection. Here's another sad truth anti vaxxers. ""mild"" OG covid-19 put healthy 62 year old BiL ground.

But yeah new variants even infectious. 

As masks come stores restaurants barriers social events large groups people go away, anti vaxxers going shaking hands Darwin lot. [vaccine across political groups. I've seen people know current vaccine skepticism primarily partisan issue, high among distrust institutions. 

I found success letting know I'm vaccinated answering questions have. Two stated got vaccinated seeing fine. job push getting vaccine, I'll advocate second see chance.

Better getting better. 🥳 🥳 🥳 why, IMO, one dose strategy effective. guess supply main rationale one dose strategy No, named Tokyo Japan. Shame big thing there, everyone reminded whose boneheaded decisions allowed plague spread. mean, that's supposed vaccine efficacy, les, no? Let’s go back time guess

Good time go back 2002 1 dose vs 2 dose, believe. Hard tell since states don’t track recoveries. currently 24k hospitalized Covid patients US, guess way math number get rough estimate current active cases. can't effectively counter China's influence alone. need depend coalition regional allies pressure good global citizen. includes countries like India, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Vietnam, etc... think China necessarily enemy, bully let them. hope simply KNOW yet Almost like things change new information obtained 🤯 Truth: raw chicken one worst things clean after. Always gnarly feeling Somehow, people do. It’s mind boggling. US many developed countries made bilateral deals vacine manufacturers, got first line, bought vaccines made early they're sharing rest world they're done them... believe explain? He'll fine. zombie herd now?!?!?!? Given limited data available time scientific community told us best. data came stance changed. 

That's makes science work. evolves changes instead digging entrenching. 

It's feature, bug. need see actual source horseshit.

Not cherry picked spin conspiracy theory sites fox news trying stir trouble Anyone link isn’t Insider? No, true. They're grown adults. But, opportunities short term longer may limited long stay unvaccinated. Malmo Copenhagen, Flensburg Padborg, Haparanda Tornio, etc, etc, borders moment KNOW fully open personal experience, can't even find places map claim international commuting hassle free moment. Yet cases going again. What's going on?  Laughs vaccine   almost 2/3rds population, especially winter.

Edit: Europe NA, anyway People act like government control vaccine acrually medical professionals. government approve distribute mainly   think witch stole Christopher Walken's head using get revenge people like. Edward Scissor Hands rides horse moves Boston. least that's remember it. Cases definitely going again.

What government's explanation? Israel similar rates vaccination, increase far. biggest take away stop touching face. touch lot pathogens touch face they're probably getting in. Weird, I'm getting 404. I'm mobile, maybe that's it? Yep, I’m Oregon. Back napkin math puts us 70% end July, assuming first dose rate stays it’s now, slowed crawl.

Washington said they’re reopening June 30th whether hit 70% not, open earlier get 70%. hope that’s Brown’s plan hasn’t said yet, there’s really way hit 70% anytime soon, all. still claims we’ll reopen end month, leads believe she’ll scrap 70% requirement eventually. feels like there’s end this. got vaccinated first day eligible, life hasn’t really changed since. We’re held back segment population cannot convinced get vaccinated idk solution is. Yep going back right, people die vaccine. like people got vaccinated 1890. dead now.  Pfizer distribution rights BioNTech vaccine Taiwan. Fosun does.  issue kids 12 get screwed. low death rate longterm effects catching Covid. think either Fauci Biden want start war China that's getting at.  Ahh, glorious Imperial College modelling predicted 100k deaths Sweden. 

Meanwhile, real life, less 100 people age died Sweden. country 10 million people. Makes wonder. like saying Black Panther says 'Wakanda Forever!' 'LockDown Forever!' Many people seem believe unvaccinated going spawn variant overcomes vaccine basically never safe unmask everyone vaccinated. think true likely domestic political considerations involved. 

What best option always efficient. Believe scientific community. 

Questions need asked immediate answers. going take time get bottom this. Many possibilities need explored. 

Don't let scientifically illiterate politicians propagandists spin one way other. China held accountable even true coverup hampered global effort. really... vaccinated people mild symptoms asymptomatic, aren’t likely tested. means can’t really know effective vaccine preventing infection. know effective preventing severe enough symptoms person seeks treatment and/or testing. 

This discrepancy matters vaccinated people spreading covid without knowing it, still encouraging variants ultimately beat vaccines. Additionally, communities remain unsafe cannot reap benefits vaccination. 

So need aware limitations efficacy stats push hard mandatory vaccination legitimate medical exemption. Religious &amp; philosophical exemptions aren’t appropriate matters public health. past, made smallpox vaccination mandatory must covid. Really, measles, many us falsely believed personal freedom trumps else despite Supreme Court upheld public safety important. first symptom sweating too! giving virtual presentation work go video looked like got pool. tested negative rapid test doc NAAT PCR took days result came back positive.   Ultimately, important tool government credibility. time public official anything undermine credibility public health emergency, treated nothing less criminal malpractice. used live King County Washington checked probably others. - Believing ""the government"" singular entity trap

- theory providing shortcut disproportionately informed vs general public also almost certainly trap

- YouTube strong vector traps

I trust local budget people, cops, mayoral staff, etc. - can't say Senators NSA.

Conspiracies happen, I'll hold-out professional proof putting eggs baskets.

I watch ridiculous amounts YouTube - dangerous place impressionable brain, little media literacy, much better TV ever was. many active cases US? Thank you, I'll quarantine Oregon? so, share frustrations. It’s disheartening hearing everyone talk returning normal still feels like nothing substantially changed here. It’s obvious we’re hitting wall people rushing get vaccinated, rest state shouldn’t held hostage behalf either don’t want vaccine haven’t found time yet. I’m hoping Biden’s July 4th goal signals nation-wide end everyday restrictions, Kate Brown also governor initially resisted Biden’s push vaccines available everybody April 19, there’s long history digging heels in..."
