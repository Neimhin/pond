0,2020-06-26," stating protest seems like perfect breeding ground creating America's Patient 31 go exactly health advice pretty much offical world currently purely political?

Good Job useless line code. Lately I'd happy 95% Americans knowing word 'forecast' means. No.. people get use excuse.  TON correct evidence information there. one moron White House contradicting every doctor, scientist, local official. 

The phrase, ""I following orders,"" seems apply here. Yeah... No... knew risk choosing, went way find one person said WANTED hear even though knew heart lie. true. I‚Äôm hoping staff hospital come media tell whenever hospital overrun.

I mean, *has* happen right? one earth would keep going happened

Only prediction though, obviously don‚Äôt know agree sentiment, us still receiving unemployment. Going 4 months now. We've got better department. turns out, based real life! [Southern states **reopened early restrictions** already seeing double-digit increases May protests even begin 27th.

If protests significant contributing factor, we'd seeing huge spikes cities biggest protests.

But, don't. see huge spikes Southern states reopened early restrictions.

What fucking coincidence. prioritized business wouldn‚Äôt shutdown bars started limiting patronage restaurants again. never lol 46000 day today without real effort social distance means much bigger number weeks, suppose also depends good testing is. stage testing become bottleneck. they're think rest world does? Play along screw Trump? 
Funnily enough lot countries leading parties benefitted greatly popularity far, dealed well decisive corona. governments like US UK lost popularity due fucking response. best part is, people mocked taking seriously lockdown people still half million dead. Sad part getting worse gets better. doesnt take dedocating life epidemiology seen coming. Anyone half brain known coming soon wuhan locked down. China would never taken hit economy reputation unless 1. extremely serious 2. late contain. containment window, long vaccines take develop interconnected world is, solution herd immunity initial lockdown make sure healthcare sevices werent overwhelmed initial wave.

Herd immunity isnt even guarantee, doesnt really matter viable solution. doesnt work, we're fucked. like part handed megaphone back person wearing mask group. Everyone going local VA bar support America. Give break. Sure mountains money, major corporations do. make much willingly giving mountains money. 

In Disney's case lot revenue dried once, matter big corporation can't indefinitely last without revenue. theme parks movies taking huge hits covid shutdowns probably lose even corporations closures. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs crazy whole thing: initial time played March/April, case considered mild shortness breath severe enough couldn‚Äôt finish sentence, oxygen level (thankfully!) stayed normal. would qualified hospital admission. cases admitted usually moderate severe: people whose oxygen levels consistently low, severe shortness breath, fluid lungs, whose organs shutting down.

I technically functional enough whole 45 days acute illness able walk laundry room (albeit breath), stand kitchen cook something quick, etc. days, would need lay shower much.

When family friends spoke FaceTime, looked sounded functional enough. couldn‚Äôt see speaking made run air sometimes. lungs tight, vice-like feeling around made hard take deep breath almost 2 months. 

This illness like nothing I‚Äôve ever experienced. like cold flu I‚Äôve ever had. ‚Äúenergy‚Äù also terrible fatigue. light household chores, days brain couldn‚Äôt focus anything watching TV. confusing experience it, symptoms body changed week week day day. lot anxiety constant recoveries relapses.

I realize it‚Äôs hard understand means haven‚Äôt experienced COVID effects body, sincerely hope never do. hope sheds little light. wide range virus affected everyone‚Äôs bodies. I‚Äôm much better, though still lung inflammation, I‚Äôll still run breath occasionally, haven‚Äôt gone run since March. sure I‚Äôll able to. moderate severe cases much worse: they‚Äôre oxygen, lung scarring, failed kidneys, etc. Thank you! Wow good point friend. Don‚Äôt care, still voting Trump. Where's evidence smart guy? unfortunately made mistake. Went clients birthday party. Total 6 people. following day Father‚Äôs Day I‚Äôm pretty sure got everyone family sick. anymore. online school settle virtual mass murder. time passes, there's going medical research topic. got see Dexamethasone potential reduce number deaths third. biomedical research company interviewing put everything hold mid-Feb.

The person told senior scientist company, exact words ""yea, gonna thing. We're locking down""

and kinda haunts no-one taking seriously yet, were, like could see future. quite good news appears surface, here's [Twitter immigration lawyer explaining it, basically:

For children ICE held 20 days, July 17th (which month now), ICE following options:

* Release sponsor guardians/parents consents.

* Release parents/guardians, however tracking device may placed parents/guardians.

* File specific explanation releasing child and/or parents/guardians.

Immigrant rights lawyers afraid (and I, experience ICE operates), ICE force family make choice releasing child sponsor, i.e. separated, stay together detention (ICE paperwork). **This actually much different status quo.**

Here's [another expecting go back litigation.

This get dragged courts months. know, pandemic plenty damage way less time that. Mine supposed past April, we‚Äôre hoping April 2021 ü§û wasn‚Äôt re-opening protests. Millions projected die preventative measures taken. Luckily preventative measures taken.

This dumb shit like doctor saying die unless take antibiotic, take antibiotic, go doctor complain die even though said would. Sorry, meant US. I'd like one example law would prevent contact tracing. afaik, one. See comment above. government already data there's nothing preventing getting it. Nope. protests greatly horrifically contributing spike, get deny fact.

Your politics trump science. fought Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins passed mask ordinance Dallas County. People would‚Äôve subject fines wearing masks. Greg Abbott said NOPE can‚Äôt that. 3 weeks later Abbott says, well never said couldn‚Äôt force BUSINESSES require masks. that‚Äôs Dallas Tarrant County now. cities said enforcing County Judge‚Äôs ordinances. Careful cut edginess. damned college kids

Doing drugs, going crowded bars, wearing masks, 
Protesting social distancing. 

Sad see yeah Florida Texas Arizona riots. real answer opened early. man function hindsight, get rid oxymoron Yeeeeehaaaaaawwww Seems like 5% Americans wear mask public. Good job America. Amazing. Keep up. Pump numbers up. It‚Äôs like people living goddamn planet.  Wait till tomorrow new record. Also, social security demographic apocalypse averted. Welfare state collapse postponed. terrifying me, especially since family seem care anymore. dad basically said, ""all protests happened two weeks ago major spike."" He's refusing acknowledge news planning deep sea fishing trip Carolinas. worst part? little sister Type 1 Diabetic also terrified dad's ignorance may cost form. fired DOH refusing manipulate COVID data 

BS. fraud. I‚Äôm blue collar worker think shut down. Lives important keeping job apparently don‚Äôt value human life same. Don‚Äôt use blue collar careers way attack people want deaths possible. wholesale retail giant‚Äôs half-sheet cakes beloved freshness affordable prices, making event staple birthdays graduations even weddings.

Fasttracking vaccine means point timeline, still dont know works lol... ""Cheers luv, cavalry's 'ere!""

*giggles &amp; teleports* fool.

[Southern states **reopened early restrictions** seeing double-digit increases May protests even begin 27th. K. Let's compare Japan then.

Almost half population US. One densely populated metro areas world. 18000 cases... Total, per day. american, please come country. want infectious people here. go back feb suggest residents get cloth face coverings ahead March 1st mandate fir wearing  inside among strangers? published this? know this, thanks sharing. job hard enough is, don‚Äôt need crap top it. 

I wish answer you, I‚Äôm LA (Hollywood area) people taking pretty seriously. feel unsafe, would leave - it‚Äôs worth risking life thankless owners. know that‚Äôs always easy. Good luck keep updating! can't speak case speaking data practitioner, current Florida charts nothing wrong them, especially compare hers. unless legitimately trying hide numbers there's got case. 5G lunatics spring mind.

It's also always go argument anti vaxxers.

Wait, arm broken, going doctor said trust vaccines? cases largely coming areas rushed reopening phases poor containment measures. spikes occurring across entire US. seems safe say protests blame we'd see huge spikes every major US city. We're not. right dont belive since smoggy place doesnt care health people gdp seven day period, that's 331,275 per week. current mortality rate 5.14%, that's 17,000 future dead people. 9/11 took 2,996 lives, comparison USA currently almost six 9/11s every week probable future deaths. could much worse health care infrastructure gets overloaded. 

Here's [Trump subject yesterday: deaths way down. Mortality rate one lowest World. Economy roaring back shut down. ‚ÄúEmbers‚Äù flare ups put out, necessary! Lol true. blows mind idiotic continuously prove won‚Äôt. friends bright idea go beach last week jam packed old people parents kids sign social distancing. We‚Äôre doomed. Tell owners workers bars Texas Florida forced close today. kind financial support getting help survive forced closure? Reopening stores &amp; restaurants lil different thousands upon thousands standing streets hours side side. don‚Äôt care arguing cause stoopid parrot media lies you. know nothing reallyyyyy, stay inside rest year bud pandy coming ya hilarious people blaming protests huge spikes we're seeing.

[Southern states *reopened early restrictions* seeing double-digit increases May protests even begin 27th. Thank you! doctor treating every case end intubation mild case curious countries reacting wearing masks... check video walk series Youtube.

Quick search turned video posted 3 hrs ago Tokyo, filmed 2 days ago according description: surprise, almost every single person street wearing mask, complaints. thanks that, life goes pretty much like normal.

(P.S. video walks chill watch highly recommend lol, like watching exercising) haven‚Äôt drink three years. Today debated order alcohol.. didn‚Äôt feels like getting drunk right would best course action. call winning It‚Äôs trumpette- even need ask question... could run far away They'll surely test disinfectant injections anal light tubes now.  parents AZ they‚Äôre old and... guess I‚Äôll call ‚Äúill informed.‚Äù

It terrifies every day. Pretty sure largest protest Minnesota DC.....largest spikes Texas Arizona Florida...hmmmmm don‚Äôt see correlation  Unless I'm missing something, disparity due state counting positive regular tests whereas approach bundles regular tests antibodies tests. data scientist seems like could resolved annotating totals mention exclude antibodies tests. data science perspective official site inaccurate misleading, especially labels everything correctly.

I thought going like Georgia case data legitimately mislabeled unordered resulted inaccurate misleading chart. case lot harder argue state's approach wrong.  lack tourism going crush US heavily service industry. Everyone going banned even alarming going learn better cheaper alternatives. Really? That's still happening? heard riot weeks. shut yet TX FL? shut bars already. is, Trump ordering testing slowed down. Regardless, time tell, unfortunately. think important question isn‚Äôt answered still stands.

Why media cultural leaders encouraging protests potentially fuck participating. Considering lot people participating lower social economic scale, African descent people tend higher risk vitamin deficiency, c19 may relationship vitamin d, strongly earned distrust authority.  seems lot like recipe disaster. Sweet, thanks! horrible position take. think many victims older, somehow ok? Like ‚Äúfair game‚Äù loss life biggie? 

That‚Äôs even ‚Äúdeath rate‚Äù. That‚Äôs spouting complete nonsense callous ‚Äúsources‚Äù consider life disposable, too. 

The sooner realize folks side care you, life family, sooner takes steps protect love. Infections expected continue rising steadily India. Experts advising federal government say authorities prioritise reducing mortality containing spread virus. 

India forced ""herd immunity"" Indians follow lockdown rules contain virus. lot people going sicken die. 

America Brazil far behind this, similar reasons. three countries, longer question least one sees 1 Million deaths. Based media‚Äôs coverage COVID-19 week, state think reported coronavirus deaths today - Florida, Texas New York? Note: New York smallest population.

Answer: New York (45) - compared Florida (37) Texas (31). find unbelievable POTUS could stand saying, ""We need open schools kids get sick virus.""  short sited possibly believe guy clue manage crisis. gonna come shock you, California largest population country...no shit would cases per capita. normally lot empathy compassion people anxiety disorders psych issues. lost almost ""wearing mask makes panic attack"" crowd. point even give fuck actually anxiety disorder. Take Xanax wear mask, stay home keep using Instacart, seeing walk towards grocery store making panic attack one us plague-vectoring other. read questions especially males whether might sterility issues develop. early know.

This. example, Chinese known months recirculating non-ventilated air huge problem. America? Crickets. Testing affect hospitalizations. peaked literally months ago consistently dropped. wondering thing. come possibly one large church buildings could easily maintain safe distance 100 people. Even sound practical though. subtract people needed logistics, sound worth it. general timeline protests? think reopening economy worst, curious Huh? 

So mad Dems campaign here, mad Dems campaigning here? 

WTF want exactly? order that, leadership. time crisis, leaders rally everyone together toward common goal. 

None US atm. lined eagerly carry device GPS tracker, phones ... 5% death rate still would equal 2K deaths people start dying.

Am missing something thought process? get back 2K deaths day, fuck going then? NC that's explanation needed..... Sweden's RETAIL mobility baseline. going stores more.  happens people listen first time. Maybe they'll listen second time. graphs good representation. sigmoidal growth looks like S, plateaus eventually, exponential growth looks like J keeps growing It‚Äôs sneaky little bastard. we're talking, know promoter pretty well known area too. Rock USA &amp; Country USA two biggest events state year know I've heard people say know owner... Yeah, everyone, hyperbolic. dad AG pilot hear talk greatness Trump quite often. Except dad, doesn‚Äôt care politics politicians general. non-American, many issues guys seem link way poor education. thought school-less generation kinda scary  library-goer, know better put book freaking microwave?! reason.  use keep family someone said yesterday, see tomorrow new high! Overall yes. Nobody wants get shot police help stay home. Stay home = covid. Yes. know it‚Äôs safe. It‚Äôs effectiveness testing live NY. watched every single Cuomo's speeches. feel like whole lot besides give good speeches set bunch testing sites. Trump set emergency hospital sent us extra ventillators. Still horrible reopening plan plan reopen schools. know I'd say handled well hoax? spend hours Facebook looking profiles anyone anti-social distancing/covid non-believer, you‚Äôll easily see tens thousands don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs scary sad. cares liar says?? also said masks effective. Fauci rot putting lives much greater risk. friends someone went Cowboys Red River Dallas couple Saturdays ago. danced night. got call one dance partners following Tuesday saying tested positive. proceeded tell registered nurse. realizing could infected self-quarantining, played soccer bunch coworkers around DFW, went work. doomed. Weird. Baltimore county see anyone wearing masks. wife sent message amazon today person delivered package wearing mask social distancing talking wife either. Every time talk parents frederick always complaining mask regulations media making bigger deal etc etc

From observations I'm sure numbers still low. states around us much higher, expect last honestly. Relax..Pencedemic said flattened curve...


I can't even joke --- BELIEVE FUCKING IGNORANCE SHEER GAUL MAN TODAY GET SAY SHIT... part problem. Making excuses grown adults can't right thing. Honestly pathetic, clearly trying talk waste time. already stage 3 mid fall release date expected too, I'm stuck Texas. serve catfish call ""fish chips"". love anyone dying obviously, love irony country put reopening lives $$$ rich going end losing way money countries patient enforced proper lockdowns, PPE, patient reopening. lost insane amount lives need to, top that. Agreed. It‚Äôs unfortunate time even morons deny it. Family members die. longer political we‚Äôll feel sorry coddle them. welcome kindly reality. Yeah, me, fuck them. anyone ever denied made political hope personally suffer confronted facts! specifically airline employees. airlines precipice drop literally overnight. didn‚Äôt know long going last - costs TONS money furlough, retrain, requalify, rehire, etc airlines wanted time figure long term strategies deal new word. Airline personnel actually considered essential service workers airline infrastructure considered critical US government. pandemic going 2-3 months airlines wanted ramp flying staff right ready airline infrastructure economic lifeline driver America. Airlines seeing furloughs mass layoffs needed flying isn‚Äôt coming back years. bailout lifeline help see pandemic going use time throw every single long term plan create new ones without worrying stay afloat federal government suppose develop strategic plan would follow. It‚Äôs complete shitshow federal plan exists What‚Äôs amazing view far left far right friends agree upon.

If you‚Äôre going lockdown, fucking hard lockdown. may suck while, everyone agrees they‚Äôd rather hard way kill fucker soft lockdown takes forever actually something. Give us days prep hard lockdown, nothing grocery stores open extent, theres tests done. Deaths early May. likely increase virus cases trend upwards. actually money. People charge stupid heartless, stupid people keep voting them.  Wow say. sounds like Karen thing heard entire pandemic. believe countries people care others Apparently one enforced capacity limits anyway. said 25% initially, places full capacity immediately. one taking shit seriously. ridiculous infuriating. See, that's difference left-wing protesters right-wing protesters.. Masks us who've 12 year old boys know wangs often thing, reasons. get 200 upvotes?  Quite people refused cooperate contact tracing folks. idiots! Copy pasted yesterday next data point. Rate increase still increasing scarily. 


This 7-day rolling average US new cases. Right column daily difference. Typically stops increasing half way peak bottom. really looking scary, know high peaks, going go time, minimum rolling average would \~51000 day increase starts dropping today keeps following predictable pattern.

If American government would replace Governors Texas Florida incompetence, would different. 11%? Try 13! wealthy small business owners

Almost oxymoron... planning give away free iirc. Tl;dr people stop stupid please Himself. lol makes think big cities close masks? Lol. learned Virus doesn‚Äôt give damn politics. It‚Äôs purpose infect kill many hosts possibly can. subside environment needed spread longer available. sensibilities own. *in Mr Krabs voice* ""MONEY!"" Lol. GOP politicized outbreak safety measures everyone taking it‚Äôs going pretty damn hard admit wrong face without looking weak supporters. can‚Äôt vocally masks sudden go ‚ÄúYou know stuff said masks working? Yeah, we‚Äôre going need wear mask now. it‚Äôs mandatory.‚Äù Serious questions... FL....

If FL getting hit, affecting, currently, retiree communities?

Does FL large retiree population? commenters already said parts FL lots retirees. worry health?

Or many people generally give darn wearing mask practice social distancing?

Thanks! We're done killing face masks 5g yet. really nice knowing America. criteria refugees? Yeah it‚Äôs cherry-picked 40 year olds see r/publicfreakout spreading disease, apathetic asymptomatic youth crowding around bars, beaches, clubs, protests, rallies. must bullshitting that‚Äôs Fauci said today. time realize it, late üòÇ I‚Äôm related several dingbat deniers think it‚Äôs bad let tell you, batshit stupid! literally stack mile high list scientific papers shove face still deny say you‚Äôre overreacting. Stupid can‚Äôt cured. saw nearby Imperial County got ordered lock due high Covid spike. Things climbing areas. getting downvoted? comment vague, though. really can't tell disagreeing with, specifically. give data evidence? Ok, know doesn‚Äôt apply restaurants Chipotle currently working enforced ‚Äútop hour‚Äù handwashing sani bucket changes (which since reduced 30 minutes) since started working 2 years ago. unusual fast food typically, grateful cooperation team :) thought trap Ghostbusters? lot people can't handle credit use credit cards avoid ruining lives. already barred using credit. Debit card forces hard limit spend. North Dakota still mostly downward trend whole state pretty much opened running normal. Minimal mask wearing people using better hygiene. Restaurants full capacity, that's change I'm about. 
 Right that's different argument mad company, airline. Everyone coming airlines thread honestly flying recently incredible way better pre covid. like alaska completely understand lack options last minute shit well every changing quarantine rules. sleep tent two weeks able fish bullshit What‚Äôs alternative? Pretend virus doesn‚Äôt exist go back business usual? random chance death severe illness? How‚Äôs working states like Texas?

Btw case I‚Äôm clear. I‚Äôm saying alternative hide home vaccine found. That‚Äôs unsustainable. taking precautionary measures (like masks distancing) completely sustainable still functioning economy. There‚Äôs already examples playing out, parts world slowly opening again. I'd say thing might save shit-show vaccine..

.. think America might capable screwing even vaccine.. Like protests aren‚Äôt massive piece spike please. lot objects play. re-open Disney Liar Even going ‚Äúfix it.‚Äù  to, collectively, find way exist virus.  Unfortunately, people heeding advice.  currently beach....I one week.  used mask everytime leave room, made point distance even beach, sat bar ‚Äúsocial‚Äù activity.  short, distanced myself, used advice given, cross fingers going home COVID.  However, especially tonight (Friday) see people around behaving virus never issue...large groups hanging together boardwalk, beaches, bars, various treat stands, laughing hacking one another everyone else.  going mass resurgence no, Florida.  sucks done, people cannot bothered. Tbf, first wave yet. might get second wave one big long wave. 47,341 Politicians, health care workers, uber rich, celebrities first get it. America lot issues find extremely hyperbolic Redditor say living America hell earth. Living Syria hell earth. Living country running water lot war lords trying rape kill you. That‚Äôs hell earth. America lot issues yes, it‚Äôs hell live here. I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre also banned. I'm skeptical works fine 20 yr olds suddenly 10 years old virus transmit. defies logic way viruses work. think need studies. I'm wrong admit it. heavily are. Overall percent positive starting trend up. places 10% now, terrifying given people much access testing.

Not sure getting downvoted, important point. also see JH page much testing increased. Comparing numerator two fractions different denominators pretty meaningless. high enjoy show I'm cool, comment ridiculous. Interesting. rate growth same, one going way quickly one going down?

Can link numbers? Thanks advance.

Also, reason yo cite ""landmass"", rather ""population""? would lot stem rise Covid due July 4 madness. hope rest Florida follows suit. Final count June 26th: 47, 341 would Biden need BLM funding? He's center-left DNC-backed neoliberal politician. He's going plenty corporate super PAC funding. insane moron. Normally would take time debunk stupid shit said, time. I'll tell straight up: pathetically brainwashed right-wing media bullshit. Bruh 2.5 million ppl infected population 375M..so dont stats around nah? US lockdown never designed stop virus, instead designed delay it, give medical community time get ready. never real shutdown reality probably unrealistic US culture expecting freedom want. demonstrations /riots started stay home pretty much Well, one throughout thread multiple deleted comments, said deaths would keep declining. said recent rise cases concerning positive rate increasing increase cases coming increase testing. testing doubled cases also doubled, made bet. made cases doubling despite change number tests run, really weak restrictions throughout state Florida low mask compliance, thought foreshadowed upcoming rise cases deaths line. dont need tell avg deaths going July already know anchor point. last week comparison. thought deaths would keep declining, said wouldn't, literally next week deaths increasing already, cases ballooned 5-8x higher major implications 2-3 weeks now. reality waaaaaaaaay higher though. US must underreporting least 100%. I've always said it. US decided either go full Sweden full lockdown, nothing between. Instead went worthless stay-at-home order many people companies could ignore without consequences limited impact numbers, caused insane damage economy nontheless. actually locked everything start US would done virus right now. Like actually done, heads. Love tried point Australia virus thriving heat people northern hemisphere (mostly US) like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry won‚Äôt cope heat‚Äù Wait minute. month ago people saying doctors putting Covid cause death (in hospitals) death certificates even wasn‚Äôt really cause reimbursement rate insurance higher. would falsely increase numbers. people going believe deaths going hidden downplayed government? Ya‚Äôll, pick conspiracy stick it. Good news old news? like nothing stupidity primarily weird, non functional healthcare system used people dying hospitals instead dying home flu. hardwork BLM coming Really morbid look...

At 200k/day would take 39,000 days infect whole population. (DRASTIC oversimplification) That's 108 years change. 

That's works, exponential growth vs human efforts fight all. there's certain amount un-realness numbers large. always interesting play them. 41k day? know America big place number seems huge. Australia well managed get top dealing massive bushfire disaster, government endured number scandals criticism regarding management that, focused exposing criticism mishandling second catastrophe. 

Plus robust social safety net, doubled early allowing people stay home, medical safety net great also, anyone felt sick reason go get tested. Topic aside, want anyone take seriously, use instead u. Would someone mild symptoms issues lining? really informative, thank link Good Lord. Also viable leave behind everyone want get sick whether immuno compromised live are. People shut nobody shopping anyways covered we're technically ""reopen"" blame part trump whole disaster mostly caused immense stupidity Americans. Even new president can‚Äôt fix that. Wow. problem one gives shit societal responsibility - Na shows single result trusted blindly lot things go wrong tests. test result outlier opposes vast majority evidence gathered via multiple approached, probable something amiss single sample. Besides, even test 99.9% accurate, thousands samples tested false results expected.  I'm Central California. Sometimes forget grab face mask leave car return get half people wearing them. Honestly, better liquor. Arguably so. June 18th never attacked person, ridiculed statements. even small percentage people get mail actually wear worth it. Discounting previously confirmed cases, that's approximately one every 6,900 Americans. Find them. Shame them. Ridicule them. Expose them. China might suppressing data.. already confirmed actions suppress data rightwing Florida &amp; AZ, way top Trump halting funding testing. get thinking. Restaurants open 75% capacity... even restriction? mean rarely see restaurants operating 75% capacity peak hours, even pandemic. ahh wondering automod that. cant even see removed comments w pushshift Full tard unity - reps anti mask dems ""mass protests increase cases"" GG Wp.

You touching mask leaving house returning. point mask catch molecules might carrying virus reaching nose/mouth. take mask whenever get car probably touching outside mask point, risk subconsciously touching nose/mouth fingers.

A drop soap opposite risk comparison. 2 drops, since multiple pairs. use tip works fine (for sunglasses too). Climate change absolutely counts existential threat entirety species.

Being realistic would recognizing acknowledging could potentially well way human extinction. funny thing West this, allow anyone talk it, Draconian penalty law.

The fact China Korea open actually better secret systems America.  8/10 trolling grow lining back,once damaged even small hole allow bacteria through.at point defense. Bacteria run rampant take easily. unemployment run out? going tell gdp US can't afford pay unemployment months. want blame trump millions go protesting? far ICUs even though rankings bad Iran even make graph healthcare workers. Fuck public schools cafe owner, wish knew. majority friends see difference.  rant, educate, drink. Malaysia pretty bad example. virus pretty much contained single digit new cases past week everything opening. Ah yes. American Dream. lacks sort leadership going offering us type help. think covid may one mutation away becoming ele humanity

You realize there's places America, right? Yes, premature assume low death rate going continue like this, especially spike cases we're seeing right now. Hospitals reaching capacity Arizona, Texas, states. logical think portion covid hospitalizations lead deaths. 

Will bad worst? younger patients improved treatments, hope not. increase cases, increase hospitalizations, increase deaths make sense. Efficiency hugely important pandemic numbers carers patients critical.

Anyway, we'll see. numbers new cases climbing astronomical think healthcare system world stop huge spike deaths coming months. Masks falling time? know Florida make good decisions, state elected him. Problem seem understand either Okay. Canada 1/10 size states 172 cases yesterday. WOOOOOOOO WAVE TWO BABYYYYYYYY I'm cafe owner dining room seats 49 one door &amp; customers.  Since knew, guys masks. moment could, closed several weeks. cleaned two solid weeks making crew get used wearing masks hours time. set curbside tables outside sidewalk.  customer inside cafe since April 7th. 

We everything possible avoid non mask wearing asshole tiny AC system. can't get 100% customers participating masks curbside.  everyone wears mask curbside, one going inside. 

Honestly, restaurants bars need subsidized like farms moment time. Everywhere else, except dental work, done wearing mask. Eating can't.  Stop eating risk damn high. Takeout risk 1. Dine without bar risk 6/7 depending size. Dine bar risk 9. 

We eat home via takeout even cook home.

I love cafe miss customers.  I'd rather lose cafe responsible killing someone. Anyone enters hospital reason CA tested, anyone wants voluntarily get one fairly easy access it.  Can‚Äôt say states though. Except people aren‚Äôt dying they‚Äôre realizing they‚Äôd rather sick 2 weeks locked 2 weeks anyway. Voluntary Extinction Human Existence Means Earth‚Äôs Natural Transformation  Well quite obvious one upper class admit. George Zimmerman Well played, USA Taking vaccine get autism, think so! /s Yeah, weird. South Australia, we're pretty much back normal. detected case community transmission almost 2 months. US makes 5% world population Knee jerk reactions American government best.that shit going help point..They'll need another lockdown least half year..But there's way..This country that..It's okay.. American....We suffer together...fml.. upvotes also 41k shot non-white though, less social points earn I'm even epidemiologist I've known since mid-January would terrible. seemed like logical conclusion anyone looked slightest bit data. whoa 35? shit, thought pushing late 40s Seriously. live Scotland, lost gran pandemic. *infuriates* many Americans think came US politics push agenda. world give flying fuck government! vile effectiveness masks absolutely clear people top decided mask policy - lied you. part reason ‚Äúchange thinking‚Äù mislead believing wrong way looking masks could preserve them. 

Medical professionals wearing face coverings surgeries since forever. It‚Äôs protect patient infection medical staff, way around. They‚Äôve always known masks help reduce transmission pathogens. lied.  Interesting. That‚Äôs bit shady side article antibody defenses quickly fade, becoming reason suspect, herd immunity never going happen. young remain better able deal disease catch (possibly time time again). Although even so, also becoming suspected permanent serious physical damage may often done even young people go disease without ever developing symptoms. So...

But one 'other' conclusion besides herd immunity people certain mindset seem unable comprehend exists, is, could serious containing eliminating Covid-19 chance. many countries successfully done. unfortunately seems, stupid something become institutionalized US. generally recommended avoid touching mask put on. Nobody's suggesting air inside car get sick -- touching mask good habit cultivate. Funny, that's similar legal weed works US states it. technically still illegal, states enforce law.

Lucky state legalized earlier year. I'm gonna lie, last 4 months I've really needed smoke Hey friend. I‚Äôm Houston. üçª matter, truth truth matter says it. deflection assures know I've said true, blinded ideology view virus objectivity. Criticize protesters, fine, condemn deniers. I‚Äôm telling need start tar feathering people again. Get juices flowing I'm glad he's admitting it, jesus, like emperor's new clothes, EVERYONE knew bad idea soon reopen I'm Atascadero seems like people North County wearing masks gathering like everything normal. place feel comfortable grocery shopping trader joes they're actually strict mask wearing distancing. full shit. Tell fellow Canadians stop coming city, getting shit face wasted, sexually harassing waitresses, generally disgusting. protesting stories old news back Covid again! need giant superhurricane happen next months focus short while, etc. Ok wants go work ? Fuck shit mr garrison? appreciate fact took time look. honestly know myself, think safer bet assume worst hope best now.

We probably know really well least year two studied. never got tested, match almost symptoms, strongest one whole loss taste smell period feeling effects well 2 months.

I'm prone breathing problems (life long asthmatic). Since got sick went using inhaler maybe month normally 4 times daily. get re-infected damage time... well lot people truly screwed. isn‚Äôt even that. It‚Äôs society engages people, gives amplified voice. forces everyone one side another.
Keep reinforcing division it‚Äôll get worse. Keep identifying political brands calling group nazis. Watch happens.

This age ‚Äòsides‚Äô equally fault damage done flawed thinking.  Literally 100% claims. Every single one. Sorry sources debunk claims. happens know talking about. lol, oddly ones refusing wear masks, insist killing grandma fairly large number people traveling place dirtbike/mountainbike/ATV event weekend. Fucking stellar. anti vaxxer I‚Äôll take chances virus vaccine Trump pressuring FDA clear, strain viruses historically difficult vaccinate against. It‚Äôs something Legal idea certain documents order hold sort confirmation end party received document.

A fax machine immediately knows document successfully received end. 

Of course, ways, architecting brand new way harder think. 

You also get companies world agree it. No, we're recovering. Europe hit US, us pretty bad time (Italy Spain especially), two coutnries - Sweden UK - majorly dropped ball.

The rest us re-opening society degrees, small steps, see ""get away with"" without resurgence cases. am, schools opened two months ago now, little resulting problems. also advisory goes ""if keep working home, please keep working home, can't, please drive ride bike work, maintain social distance work."" public transporation running 1/3 capacity, i.e. they're taking 33% normal amount passengers, ensure proper physical distance board.

So far, working. there's sense breathlessness intense caution, we're ready shut instantly need be. people still very, careful, new case numbers sinking still. lol comment downvoted? literally true also forgot people may problems getting hospital treatment something totally unrelated, like auto accident, gunshot wound, heart attack, injuries.

And fear, hospitals fill up, hotbeds infection.

'Eh, little chest pain! Better corona virus!'

They die too. Bot spammer. overlooked far often. case spike comes death spike. People sick days weeks. I‚Äôm little worried fast we‚Äôve opened stage two, couldn‚Äôt happier government's response. It‚Äôs really comforting watching daily press conferences, feeling like they‚Äôve got best interests heart. We‚Äôre fortunate live here. US whole no, localized Holy crap. made realize something. get claustrophobic airplanes lorazepam take flights. Well past two weeks I‚Äôve taken twice getting anxiety get claustrophobic. didn‚Äôt know why, comment made realize - it‚Äôs news, Trump. absolute madness that‚Äôs happening causing this. be. 

The election cannot come soon enough. find odd NY coronavirus trackers specifically told ask extremely relevant question ‚Äî attended large mass gathering (aka protest)? Let guess... North Carolina? Yes. means lot people going die. planet fine. Humans, much. Might suck complex life knock right dominoes. bacteria keep right truckin' Ya think?! asthma. Lmao seen 101? kid commercial. brain, brain drugs. brain egg, brain drugs egg hot skillet crackling. still remember day. think time go back face ads scare shit people. Show someone gasping oxygen, getting ventilated. Shock awe hope now. People need see carnage. Invisible job.

Hot enough fry egg? Hot enough fry dog's brain. Another commerical still remember puts fear God people. saying hospitals empty can't provide us proof got info. Gotcha. Maybe Florida luck hurricane hit! Well could survive C die cardiac arrest, viral pneumonia kidney failure. That's top head. structure wearing masks social distancing taking serious? Fuck you, Greg. $43k good two caramel frappes Michael Bubl√© CD. Alas, realpolitik sometimes concerns outweigh concerns constituents. Like winning re-election depressing voter turn-out (Covid scary, stay home vote. mail-in ballots either). selling stocks situation hits news. I'm actually sure DeSantis actually educated rich enough buy ivy league degree Probably came China.

If came Australia something, politicians wouldn‚Äôt lost minds. right, downvoting person? California large populace upticks mainly areas lean red refused put mask mandates place.

I see California best demonstration would happened Clinton election POTUS. Leadership top would saying right things, party controlled state would push federalism liberty. want see hospitalization numbers confirmed cases numbers, testing much higher therefore numbers cases know going rise increased testing. (Not Trumper pushing talking point) confirmed cases indeed show far taken seriously. high risk health problems pretty scary. bad sign? talking drinks hammered? gotta admit drink least couple drinks night days even outside covid. lets even talk weed..... I'm close uncle, calls time get reassurance he's weird wearing mask. None age group except mom maybe one cousins. agree yes Deff sucks Totally agree you. one I‚Äôm praying too. get worried 20 cases Australia  in, we're updating threat level BLACKWATCH PLAID. Yeah think government population cautious disciplined last time saw upward spike, it'll probably work fine. states like Texas allow people self-report 2 5 symptoms, bound drive numbers artificially. 

You temperature cough self-report need stay home, excused work even qualify benefits. 

This mean it. means presumed number get added total positives state. one: It‚Äôs almost like something happened 2-3 weeks ago media encouraging people go massive gatherings stand shoulder shoulder support something.

I get it‚Äôs important stand #blacklivesmatter fuck sure seems like media cultural leaders encouraging black people support go risk.

Almost like don‚Äôt care black lives..... knew beginning one could make past six weeks. general populace can't even go say without spending $6 Starbucks let alone stay home two months.

My goal entire time separate absolute last people exposed. Sad say I'm proven right.

All control actions point everyone else's stupidity. kicked out. guess may choice hospital capacity, think they'll put half measures place slow spread still keep things open. don‚Äôt agree them, gladly wear mask, right protest blm protestors. would they? There's point hide hundreds cases still small number compared whole population, would late hide thousands cases soon become tens thousands overwhelm health care system. like motivation fudge number reopen they've already open 2 months. plateau shelter place again. odds governments push shutdowns again?

Maybe states, counties. rest, they've played hand. They're willing take deaths. ""misc"" box tick?

Write ""human""

Yes exactly, wish would stop linking persons attendance something got fact. deaths record. Misleading headline Weaken state. even know real numbers years. thought swine flu killed 4,000 Americans. like 12,000. thought SARS 2% fatality rate. Turns like 10%. üôÇüî´ Good question centrist. rejected Bernie Sanders wail Trump. learned nothing spanish flu Oops. also forgot people may problems getting hospital treatment something totally unrelated, like auto accident, gunshot wound, heart attack, injuries. We've also gotten better treating new cases younger demographic. billionaire owned media racebaiting clueless people pointless BLM riots according agenda. guess 450$ billion transfer wealth last corona crash wasn‚Äôt enough them.

Did test idea looking facts? What's city Minneapolis COVID cases? Pretty much steady.

Maybe listen people deny racism call demands justice ""race baiting"". seems attractive secret truth need special. you. Several vaccine candidates concurrently manufactured proceed clinical trials. Fortunately major counties mandating themselves. Yes. safe friend
Worldometer.com Hopefully catalyzes better social safety net childcare. Currently, direct path economic depression can't afford take care kids. society basically failed fundamental purpose society. numbers used literally come directly chart. Go specific chart. Scroll slightly see number totals.

Again, may true, match known covid hospitalizations, week, week represented bar graph (or real life). knew half think know, would obvious posted chart thought dropped surge cases subsequent surge hospitalizations Texas driven younger individuals...

Absolutely nothing point regarding infections age trying cite data back point. seems like time around largely younger people infected. makes much better story plot point lasts one episode. vote either murder hornets tigers. *is* Florida, all. yeah never stopping spread, slowing it. handled first peak pretty well second peak, ever happens, coming soon october Well they're charge go underling avoided prosecution far many things, plus think usa law applies soviet. bars opened again?  surprising considering BLM protests would like get mr bones wild ride. Okay keep going feelings instead actual studies then, probably better! existence second wave would require first wave ever fucking end. idiot getting plane days? Round two... FIGHT! worries kind vague Man guy must've cool Im sad see it.  Agree, excessive deaths golden metric...we data UK, publishes US? Would love see it, get behind scaremongering headlines no, don‚Äôt sources. Soon I'll need license use toaster. Wow! Black lives better still matter huh stupid average Redditor is. sides agree, ""overwhelmingly"". statement food food packaging alone, anything else added statement would change statement modes transmission. wasn‚Äôt goal. Yes, said ‚Äúno evidence new coronavirus spreads foodstuff packaging.‚Äù means absence evidence. proof. cannot conclude. say evidence new coronavirus spreads foodstuff packaging. point, would evidence conclude food packaging safe.

Are talking CDC statement released, misinterpreted public, CDC make clarifying statements website? See: media reports appeared suggested change CDC‚Äôs view transmissibility, became clear edits confusing. Therefore, edited page provide clarity.

The primary important mode transmission COVID-19 close contact person-to-person. Based data lab studies COVID-19 know similar respiratory diseases, may possible person get COVID-19 touching surface object virus touching mouth, nose, possibly eyes, isn‚Äôt thought main way virus spreads.‚Äù

Therefore, surfaces definitely still viable means transmission, primary.  protests positive result symptomatic case. symptomatic case death sentence. Get ready. 250million ceiling. Thank you, really appreciate it. hope too. still many people's family members risk, work, work open need pay bills. want anyone go kind uncertainty, can't even go sit hold hand fight fucking lives.  Yeah, guess ""concentrated"" camps? normal person? devastating! someone like him? Indifferent would fitting think... Bruh.are robot? actual science mongoloid *In voice Lady Gaga*

‚ÄúRecord number cases, ‚Äònother record, ‚Äònother record, ‚Äònother record, ‚Äònother record...‚Äù

We behind fucked almost found nervous giggle laugh people things become fucking ridiculous it‚Äôs ALMOST hilarious. No, not. magnificent bastard. news report considered propaganda. BBC state owned, propaganda? 

You afraid address simple facts pointing want face them. could get doctor's note too. disclose specifics. Let peasants go you, right? seems count vaccine January 20. comes first? governor caved well. easy confuse kansas city, kansas withMissouri. Trump lol, thought chiefs played kansas LOL Ouch! true Scotsmen? tell dont worry........ bout thing. right West. world definitely white, Western nations ignored need socially responsible. third world limiting explosion despite resources health departments etc. Alexa, play Bananarama I'm glad they're announcing this.

Welcome aboard br√∂th√™r. was, like strong recommendation ... He's used making problems ""go away"" moving new ones. presidency, failed business career, he's bored 'rona wants go back hosting big superspreader events.

Like look bummed Tulsa rally, dude sad fuck, thought ""glide path"" re-election six months ago (ironically 5 points polls meant like coin toss glide path). US healthcare system ... Survival fittest. weird outside looking in. Like giving burger flippers sick leave good anybody? ...  120k dead definitely tragedy. However catastrophe implies something like another civil war. parking lots empty cause don‚Äôt allow visitors... ""Nobody still afraid come back office.""

The CEO company zoom call sat front $80,000 Steinway Piano massive spikes, take month see death total cases past weeks. virus long lag hard even follow data. Preferably. course, chances infected significantly lower open area people, covid aerosols known hang air hours someone passes by.

Always better stay safe side. die. Take pick. Don‚Äôt forget‚Äîback school month so!! powerful man China, landlord. really sucks. hoping going go plateaued long time increasing! stop satisfied calling 500 new cases day well. America accounts 1/5 world's economy rest world bullied treat US dollar gold. spoiled brats print money keep living beyond means.

It eventually end idea when. Hopefully ASAP. world needs get rid massive bully strangling death. Lol guys. üòí Anyone else tired winning? Yeah supposed welcome aholes fold open arms realize error ways. Fuck that. years? US reach herd immunity absolutely nothing done. vaccine likely would allow people vaccinated travel. stupid thing neither county city actually enforcing it. go downtown Campbell, literally nobody wearing mask socialdistancing. smh yeah understand appear low numbers, things going them: 
1. Media attention
2. People (not part group) thinks right
3. People (like us) think (better know)they nuts powerless stop them.
4. Law enforcement let proceed ramble.
and obviously add list, lt. gov wants sue cooper mask order, various nuts wh simply wont obey mask order. around pos, dude doing? Las Vegas, governor mandated masks public areas include private public space like grocery stores, started Friday. saw 50% people walking street wearing masks. strong portions, sure. seems like said nations well, pictures folks Europe heading back beaches lock downs too. think victory declared prematurely almost everywhere, USA ahead pack, perhaps due bad leadership, 'second wave', many nations unfortunately get there. France, Spain Germany 60% US population, 4% number new cases. Canadian - husband discussed multiple times recent past going back America reason Americans get shit together. starting look like might never come back. unfortunately, we've visited US average twice year past, unsafe (on several different levels) even consider it. can't reason people positions reason into.  Peak crisis? That‚Äôs like 2 weeks us. mean good number people masks didn't. know protests significant meaning purpose chose attend one. link that? want make well think Seattle would beg differ. got Indiana University ... *of Pennsylvania*, got West Virginia liked idea naming town ""Charles"" much Charleston Charles Town, etc ... I'm American living Hong Kong - I've asked number times (generally mystified) HK locals exactly US. recently stopped asking - think realize become one questions that's embarrassing painful answer best left unasked. anybody looking # testing % positive also sheer hospitalization death number? saying daily new cases doesnt really tell whole picture. look count everything back peak. People bad math. Instant karma reopeners. getting good job america Trump rally completely unnecessary could delayed canceled. Standing rights worth risk. understand that, know else help you. makers Sharknado Sharknado 2 workers sit register person person comes by, hope take measures.  Yes, leadership general Pandemic exceptionally poor. can‚Äôt serious. agree it‚Äôs propaganda want debate content. That‚Äôs absurd. still get this. People make masks.

America First. muh f. R. E. E. D. O. M. S. Thoughts prayers work better scientists lot tests. need more, could said almost every nation.   tested less, anyone floated idea? Don‚Äôt worry everyone, Covid 19 blown proportion also hoax like Moon landing.

Trust uncle works White House. \*Dead\* ""IT KILLS DEAD PEOPLE"" Given Trump camps, almost wet dream, too. ""You see, killbots preset kill limit. Knowing weakness, sent wave wave men reached limit shut down.‚Äù dude thinks uses bigger words right lol That‚Äôs one positive man, loose 6 pounds I‚Äôll clinically underweight. blame extremely physical job kinda poor, can‚Äôt buy enough food gain weight. American? Ramdev American? Bots go keywords usually auto flag remove death tolls rising linear fashion? Hopefully cases proving lethal, maybe vulnerable already hit, maybe treatments becoming effective. caught point making here, conservative Christian friends *least* guilty general public concerned rights protecting neighbors. think presume praying. mean Canada Germany Australia France UK bla bla bla bla huge protests seeing spikes.

It's protests. indoor activities causing this, quite clearly. Go off, sis. put blame solely protests don‚Äôt agree also pretty asinine. Especially since also many bootlicking protests well. I‚Äôm saying BLM protests didn‚Äôt play part accelerating spread. start coming woodwork placing blame ‚Äútrusted leadership‚Äù handled like shit jump disingenuous best this! I've decided wear black 4th July. Partly it'll piss Trumper father-in-law mostly find little proud right now. come Walmarts open can‚Äôt go rest-au-rant? 

They act like they‚Äôre smart thought process too. Obviously would end everyone believing tries say inverse prophety. curse all. What's point? BLM, protesting, large groups people something something?!?!? Never mind countries high mask usage dramatically cut rates even higher population densities... ü§î Imagine someone smoking cigarette exhale. wear mask still smell cig smoke, that‚Äôs fine smoke particles getting masks sides mask, 100% protective seal filter mask. 

Your mask block smoke, hopefully, all. smoker, hopefully mask blocks smoke escaping collects mask escapes surrounding environment infect people.

Think breath looks cold December night exhale. think come winter gets cold enough see breath cold air, people start realize far mouth valors travel, much mask prevents vapor traveling. USA basically screwed. facts. test results based individuals 1.) Sick enough seek medical assistance. 2.) afford medical assistance. 3.) part 20% individuals getting false negative result. 4.) Willing wait line 5 hours get tested.

Providing free COVID-19 testing treat virus provide herd immunity rest population, detecting virus. mechanic telling car's brake lines severed make car safe drive. actually fix brake lines. virus continue spread NOTHING done stop this. 815 US cases today! good day :) CONSTITUTIONAL Korea better Oh right!! can‚Äôt believe forgot said that. It‚Äôs horrifying SHIT  worked operating room many years, going clinic.....and seen people's masks get wet mucus.....I personally wear masks.....I providing word OP trying describe.....I opinion masks feel PERSONAL decision...period. 
I seen ""that much"" moisture masks....mostly people colds....and protect surgeons....if worn mask OR, know masks worn protect PATIENT YOU. concern mask wear fact LOT people wear touch faces constantly trying rearrange them, move down.....and simply wearing improperly..... translates 4,000 deaths. greater 9/11 EVERY DAY CONTINUES. ""Reemerge"" - rock living under? never went away. I‚Äôm Seattle people get UPPITY don‚Äôt mask, thank god. majority live masked early May. Keep drinking coolaid ... grant awarded Inovio DoD, believe gates foundation nothing that? think Microsoft bid amazon fairly? Even though Amazon overwhelmingly qualified? believe Gates stepped Microsoft could see bigger money sign side. all, naturally want more. Holy fuck Show us evidence shut fuck up. plenty substantive issues position, inability coherently use punctuation betrays lack intellectual depth underlying beliefs.  fucking crisis right moron president tried open soon. number people bars, restaurants, stores, etc. across country ""eats BLM protest breakfast"".

Are Florida Texas Arizona places BLM protests? Minnesota's numbers going protests? countries protests too?

Maybe opened fucking soon, looking scapegoat. Oh shit, go again... Another forecast also says 95% Americans complete twats. 

So we're fucked. hope family stays well. trees need cutting splitting. It‚Äôs great workout. pay 50 bucks month come use property. Embarrassing gentle word. Disgraceful would accurate. point dude makes pcs becomes doctor gets talk shit? cause he‚Äôs rich mean he‚Äôs dumb NY, Illinois, Minnesota countries world big protests start June fine.

It ain't protests. We're talking handwashing context pandemic, course wash hands using bathroom handle food. mad :) Australia NZ diverse US lol Well, post got removed talking someone morning askreddit calling mask studies ‚Äúschmiberal‚Äù propaganda. 


Don‚Äôt know even talk dangerous disinformation reddit gets automodded sub know...it's like we've free-flowing immigration southern border. we're talking American counties, think immediately obvious blame Mexican policy. We're bungling fine own.

But no, blaming Mexicans easier. least definitely racist /s Bill Gates billionaire, yes donates insufficiently Oh wow wonder many actually are. know *an infectious disease* is? One person gets protest spreads untold numbers people. 

So yes - fuck protesters. fuck idiots Tulsa Trump rally last week too, we're it. Well, thinking it‚Äôs meant ‚Äúa definitive answer‚Äù part problem this. enough unknowns give people wedge pry. Yeah dead bodies piling left right Malaysia. streets morgues full capacity!!! numbers recorded health ministry obviously forged look better. absolutely unbelievable developing country like Malaysia well pandemic. /s obvious. stop sign color party looking way cut social security Medicare. Don‚Äôt get twisted. live Florida. It‚Äôs 108 heat index don‚Äôt want leave house. wear mask. 2 year old 3 month old single mom. babysitter tested positive Covid exposed pediatricians office, staff tested positive. sister also works retail store employees tested positive told tell anyone didn‚Äôt want close store. I‚Äôm irate responsible take precautions, irresponsible people ruin it. Well done America, BLM protests Trump Rally, fucking stupid country people clue statistics work? 

It's almost test 600k people/day (which insane number), instead 150k back April, going find carriers virus. I'm shock, really. BeLiEVe tHAt? Umm yeah, I'm idiot. WeLL, KnOw AnYONe. to. wife nurse, watching roll in. Wait minute... telling situation complex Reddit would lead believe?! man Hopefully natural selection run course. country needs lot less stupid. That's perfectly fine. let hate mongers try tell protests caused spikes even LESS evidence provided. I‚Äôve heard many say ‚Äúgive liberty give death.‚Äù Congratulations, go. you‚Äôre taking bunch rest us didn‚Äôt feel strongly - ok lockdown masks such. don‚Äôt get - it‚Äôs them.  yup. one unlucky chance things get due random combination factors.

i got Guillain-Barre teenager, suffered paralysis back legs. sucked, got thin legs mis shaped foot. heard people getting total paralysis it.

it's really rare, shout anyone else :) country 3 year old kid, would agree you. Unfortunately, dealing adult knows danger drink drive yet hits road. It‚Äôs going spread worldwide regardless. You‚Äôre going stop prevent spreading. Best slow cases hospitals aren‚Äôt overwhelmed. hospitals empty, there‚Äôs much worry about.

I live county ~100,000 people. Hospitals sitting mostly empty 0 deaths.

Yes get worse, acting like world coming end helpful constantly talking cases increasing (when 300 positive cases) fear mongering. grew Eastern Europe, time lot people inferiority complex always told ""more like Western countries."" Considering well native country dealt (Canada, home, done badly either), low number fatalities, compared shitshow US UK, I'm glad we're ""more like them"" regard.  


America dangerous health. months see mean 4 years nothing say attacking someone spelling lol Yes lot workers shared living situations. unreasonable expect wear mask home. see IL state requirement, anecdotally central Illinois last week maybe 10% wearing masks... accurate map would Chicago orange wild west below. People seem assume criticism Gates comes maga perspective totally correct. Everybody knows go accountant needing plumbing electrical advice. would go scientist knows talking about? Gender stereotypes promoted unless convenient agenda, right? . agree, blm protests clearly bad idea trump rallies. world's sensible people watch horror both.

And month+ now, well that's debatable. people clearly others haven't, hence state things right now. Many things could done months ago contain this, unfortunately people willing go perceived freedoms.

You clearly can't stay half arsed lockdown forever going open back fully, try following things worked countries. Real track trace, pretending wear masks, seriously understand problem it, really much big deal. admitted partially wrong, sit well me. feels like person ran across road blindfolded got hit car saying ""I changed speed. Maybe gone little slower,"" completely missing point running across road blindfolded first place. Username checks let spread, cases deaths - including kids. seems like let kill end. way, die make serious, make great harm organs even without symptoms

 mom came visit Seattle South Carolina I‚Äôm surprised didn‚Äôt get it. fair doesn‚Äôt give shit people think put shower curtain around flight üòÇ Yes, one political rally last week Tulsa dumb fuck, maybe next week we'll see spike too. 

But spike clearly lines protests, along average age infected half was. Im disagreement. simply pointing possible. I'm NH, numbers stayed low million precautions place salons opened June 1st. RemindMe! 4 months Embarrassed American. Damn really behind ball. Hope get procedure done soon safely! Merica people worship Donald Trump. trash country know still paid contract right? regardless season ended got paid they‚Äôre full salary year, season would‚Äôve ended 2 weeks shut down, pretty much everyone paid then. another thing nba instituted finance classes players could invest correctly go debt don‚Äôt think so. think people better surgical masks since they‚Äôre much easier breathe through. Restrict breathing people pull time. actually believe shit trolling? Oh, interesting - sense, like [marble weighing definitely know much situation Brazil KAKAKAKAAK makes sense people you‚Äôre testing really low chance positive, example New York. party example probably good chance positive, it‚Äôs ideal there. Surgeons health professionals using masks long time. definitely proven work. kidding. There‚Äôs strong belief amongst many US country systems best world clearly exposed unfortunately... NEVER happen 2021 Hey, dude. I‚Äôm proud you. truly bad number number new deaths? looks number new cases outgrowing substantially. number recovered? different graph yearly flu? graph tell us enough? goal government dealing pandemic? trying flatten curve kill curve? curve trying flatten? new cases result death seen good thing, indicates headed towards herd immunity? COVID-19 look like go anywhere. herd immunity ultimate goal? I'm punishing someone learnings lesson. 

Covid handle karma. 7 day average deaths lowest level since March 31st. Focusing cases sensationalism. Everyone knows case amount previously dramatically undercounted less so.

But believe will, look numbers brain logic, tin foil hat partisan blinders. New Zealand also.  [my mental Thanks math! Well, good news everyone NL close limit. 

I think great Finland strict measures. remarkable countries Europe excluded spite strict measures! many success stories. üôÑ couple hundred years ago Oh I‚Äôm ruling protests all, questioning immediately go blaming family NY mostly returning somewhat normal lives even massive protests. live Texas, knew opening early mistake. saw people flock bars soon opened. People don‚Äôt fuckin wear masks, it‚Äôs fuckin shit-show. Lie Detector test arent supposed make laws wait let people die system decides fix itself

You straight part problem judge speaking of. trust Florida's reported death rate. suspect DeSantis still corrupt ever. article next day another said hospitals hit capacity Yeah isnt much 'typical' florida LOL start gofundme 100% necessary grief trauma counseling? fact homebody nature, probally prevented getting infected. fine hotel. clean visitors likely vast majority spread mouth breathing, surfaces stupid assholes making political getting mad wearing mask Evangelicals conservatives. I'm waiting start blaming climate scientists causing global warming. know, job security something. experimental 222 nm wavelength *supposed* burn human skin compared full UV-C. Yes, NBA going state 30k new cases 4 days smart! BEST SMART! It‚Äôs pretty clear said, don‚Äôt snippy. Marietta also want bring suburbs. live here. Bought box 8511 eBay perfection, find lot them. History shown time nature attacks species winners rich, young strong default adaptable. Thank kind words. Really goes long way. Florida oldest population US? embarrassing, legit criminally negligent. everything revolves around United States. justice sweet gave type 2 diabetes One daily update yesterday's results Wear masks, stay 2 meters apart, avoid inside crowded building. Unfortunately Anti-masker movement continue run strong president signals followers wear mask. then, way control infections. mind manners treat people nicely, merrier Hey thanks. didn‚Äôt think anyone would read comment. needed say words head. tend put head power things hasn‚Äôt easy this.. would imply people care spreading virus first place. I‚Äôll bet lipstick makers really hating masks. Like said someone else... time meaning anymore. 8 weeks time estimate top head. Something used good at. Yup, it‚Äôs half assed attempt save face. None collapsing far could tell walked one work yesterday. wasn‚Äôt walking past bodies streets hallways. They‚Äôve pretty transparent numbers plans surge capacity whatnot (I can‚Äôt speak hospitals, mine) don‚Äôt feel like we‚Äôre danger collapse even danger bad spot time soon... lot depends actions community.

If people want believe hospitals collapsing numbers delayed misunderstood, need get behavior alignment belief stay fuck home. Frankly said Elementary rudimentary simplistic statement I've heard subject days, sound like teenager found Extinction That's going happen. sucks stop getting worse right now. Oh shit... Nuff said can't use one blanket statement cover entirety US. virus shown spread differently depending region, absolutely spreads differently based cities handling virus situation. NY better handle virus most, surprising see NY spiking much. researched Boston handling virus, wont even try speculate spiking, fit specific agenda mean correct *any legit data* backing claim.. Wearing mask 1 safety precaution several - *only* wearing mask akin driving 110mph freeway, seatbelt on, relying deployment airbags keep safe something happen. multiple safety standards comes driving vehicle, like multiple safety standards comes preventing spread virus - Mask, *social distancing*, *staying home*, *wash hands*. combination helps prevent spread, mask.

Also convenient see virus 10-25 day lag time lot regions, far biggest protests? Oh.. perfectly window. Crazy. Heck, going go scuba gear, mask oxgen tank keeps up. Surgical masks limited amount protection large gaps around mask. 20% air inhale comes gaps. means one every 5 breaths, risk getting virus. another way looking standing around five times longer person without mask, catch better job respirators protecting around them, rather protecting wearer. That's doctors wear surgery you. stop doctor infecting YOU.

I believe homemade masks tested formally, I'd imagine there's reason they're recommending surgical masks, would expect would something far superior seal. That‚Äôs alarming anything. /s Well, guess really like teenager scared angry inactivity nation? Welp ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø mean, that‚Äôs true US well. Thank actually think might sick, certainly want participate pool test, exactly reasons mention. Pool testing good clinical tool. population monitoring tool best.

Its value found monitoring spread throughout population, provide informed advice politicians. politicians divided take scientists seriously, chosen political reasons ignore science.

I see reason people believe scientists leave houses risk health participate pool testing program political leaders going ignore resulting advice. I‚Äôm literally asking facts. show data infection rate participated protests? officially back again, runny nose, yes ""stuffy nose"" covid Found someone worships tyrants freedom. Ny testing much less though, Florida catch soon dont know single person age group (early mid 30s) taking seriously making appropriate precautions. havent spent time anyone immediate family three months. fact, think Millenials pretty concerned fundamental level. employment, mental health, prospect ever meeting someone new raise kids negatively impacted situation. go get groceries (as rarely possible) always older people wearing masks complaining social distancing etc. going say arent millenial dipshits experience vast majority dipshits think kind hoax boomers. yeah, keep hating millenials, expect generation drove country ground created greatest generational economic disparity world history. Thanks sharing story. days better others. It‚Äôs easy feel discouraged lot people said pretty nice things go long way me. Knowing I‚Äôm alone way I‚Äôm feeling really helps. idiots getting people killed really stupid, wish could sit explain hard us depressed it. anyone statistics far relative healthiness New Yorkers vs People Florida amd states blowing right now? I'm morbidly curious there's going difference fatality rate NY versus states. Cheers. Hopefully turn downvotes around move info bit. facility infected inmates transferred 16 deaths. need start beefing Hadrian's wall. Yea thats point. wont make profit it, wont care it. Certain people blame you. secure jobs tend brag. see tons people lately zero empathy. gfy better kys. often enough replied open, science based manner know change crazy. Hope smoke Crack excuse.  What's bad hospitals Miami already diverting patients facilities. excuses. That's negligence and/or lack due dilligence. know Living ppl filed taxes still received stimulus. you, good chap overlook testing step?? hard realization come friends. 

Turns out, I'm fair bit forgettable. Hurts eh. Better chasing em like sad puppy toxic app. This..

 sign symptoms two different things. Vietnam well containing outbreak? I've seen Vietnamese tv stations covering reopen protests. 

I wonder Vietnamese Americans think containment I'm sure meant say ""themselves"" like idea trying justify actions invisible elves. Funny, know day people telling me, ‚ÄúAll lives matter...‚Äù going millions dead ends. Cover yourself, tbe ones love let Darwin Darwin May one coworkers went graduation party people exhibited symptoms office close staggered shifts. week went remote coworker went another graduation party couple days later party goers tested positive. 

‚ÄúSorry mom Susie office won‚Äôt stop going parties keep quarantine.‚Äù thing is, vaccine based MERS vaccine, already know safe. Americans care that's why. reason they're anti socialism anti-universal healthcare, they're selfish culture obligation anyone, 

Found sociopath. 57%, majority, not. aren‚Äôt even halfway day. count half day actually yesterday? sites block? They‚Äôll react it‚Äôs late Florda almost 10 thousand new cases today. Deaths Per Million

NY: 1,615

FL: 158 personally disagree NBA resuming, comment pure bullshit know announcing willful ignorance everyone else. 

The NBA invested significant time, money, effort adopting plan safety measures includes things like mandatory masks, tests, quarantines. Etc etc etc....

If think ""basically pro-trump"" none thoughts opinions value anyone self-congratulatory purposes. long take people start wearing seat belts? don‚Äôt think ever wore one made law 20‚Äôs. parents never even told put one on. feel mask thing almost same. protesters site morality would protect them? Millennials 23-39 year unaccounted data thing informal economy like India. probably 100s thousands unaccounted cases it‚Äôs really difficult get tested CDC measuring higher social interaction score NY FL. equally, absence spike NY can't attributed stronger lockdown policies keeping people home. 

Why NY spiking, then? Probably saturated virus April/May hit herd immunity. herd immunity threshold 20-30% consistent 80-20 (80% infected 20%) transmission dynamics observed far. superspreader pop NY already immune. 

My guess protests spread covid, effect observed states yet saturated virus. 

FL's TX's social interaction scores trending rate two months associated rise hospitalizations. rate change recent reopenings. 2-3 wks protests, there's sudden rise hospitalizations. Ruling protests premature dangerous. Yeah. *That's* problem. look like growth cases going turned around anytime soon. Hospitals tested coming weeks. afraid Texas Arizona numbers going bring. Yeah? Feel free watch Palm Beach county mask hearing, go ahead count ""young"" people. 

Or try North Carolina one, reopen protests. exactly sure you‚Äôre trying say. confirmed cases symptomatic, unconfirmed cases asymptomatic bad, i'm much tolerant society lot luxuries! Devices really make scary experience bit better. saw car yesterday, right trump voter sticker. No, issue Arizona. stopped expecting big surge, happen got back logged, started filled ICU beds COVID surge came Could tell us? McPottyPython hope things get better there! Keep mind steps mentioned *at least* two-weeks gap, sometimes 3. places friends still cannot gather play five vs five soccer instance Gf sent post earlier. One best I've ever laughed loud protests serve social function outcry conservative protests spreading virus month two ago? reasonable person trust narratives change every passing day? playground/splash pad across street packed. We've gone smaller one behind school crowded time being. daycare opens late July trying stay distant then. Similar US kept getting number positives long, smaller scale. I'm sure many cities capacity ones growing fastest don't. labs run fast think grossly unfair imply someone troubled relationship food whatever reason they're fat also sociopathically uninterested welfare others. That's bullshit. bad way predict outcome... California, state said would announce theme park guidelines July 1. Disney said leave enough time logistics reopening postponed plans. planning July 11 Florida likely training extra maintenance cleaning already underway Cringe, everything money. NBA exists money too. Anyone disrespectful care fellow man dirt now. work Urgent Care. NE representative country. places people wearing masks outside Given A. wear one outside outside I‚Äôm around people don‚Äôt know stationary (I‚Äôm wearing mask walking car exercising). Pictures protests Midwest, maybe 50% wore masks. 

Given experience masks outdoors, would assume warmer weather, less people wore masks. Outside 90 degree weather sun, lasted 15 minutes mask completely soaked. tried. farmers market decently crowded, breathing challenge, especially double layered fabric mask got wet. can‚Äôt imagine someplace like Houston feel like can‚Äôt take deep breath anyway, Phoenix best metal mask. 

Picture worst summer day average good day Houston time year. read carefully see used phrase ""tend to"" rights dead. Like 126,000+ country. support move, encouraging public wear masks important, actually make difference you‚Äôre packed like sardines airtight metal tube hours?  lesson complete total failure national leadership. believe November 9 2016 Sadly, lot people aren‚Äôt brave enough say ‚ÄúEarly Data Show Uptick Covid-19 Transmission people I‚Äôve seen talked go full blown conspiracy it. They‚Äôre like ‚Äúif allow face masks, it‚Äôs mandatory vaccinations, mandatory bio trackers...‚Äù

It‚Äôs safe say none beliefs rooted facts science. That's good argument. government tell can't do, like can't tell fire unless actually fire, cannot directly compel something (speaking, wearing masks, etc.). One restriction, compulsion. definitely think it‚Äôs bars fault too. doubt saw much spread haircuts open Actually that‚Äôs funny say that, recently saw article, (I wish could remember read now!) said actually Melania tried warn husband hey! Something really bad coming, maybe take second look this, could really bad! apparently blew basically told shut up. yeah totally get saying warning signs there. advisors even wife, speaks kind man is... uhhh, no. outdoors vs indoors, masks vs masks, makes enormous difference. dumb asses going bars restaurants partying without masks. Holy shit already almost 20 years ago. feel like  We've million times. believe 0.5-1% IFR rate point there's nothing tell you. Either believe science don't. personally problem demanding test entering country. It‚Äôs two governments, seem talk. need fill paper signed stamped doctor. Good luck getting doctors appointment without test 72 hours. Maybe could‚Äôve set Swedish government oblige Danes don‚Äôt really think asked. Maybe could enough showing test digital journal phone sign to. No, it‚Äôs paper. easy forge quite tricky comply with. 

The funny thing Danes always called Sweden land restrictions think Sweden little restrictions. \*nods Czech/Slovak\* goes taking shoes airport security.

Yeah, let's blame He's judge Texas noticing issue now? assumptions simply highlight whiteness, patriotism. far made points me. Truly tragic. wear seatbelts? Kinda thinking- government telling save lives. spot on. mixed messaging top. Older 40 50-somethings felt safe enough protest outdoors en masse would dangerous hold much smaller family gatherings less 20 ppl? Add continued re-opening despite rising case numbers public got lulled sense complacency. 

State officials hot zone states issues specific warnings month ago saying certain hospitalization numbers hit we'd close again. fact even progressive Los Angeles county officials said going back lock-down option. difficult leaders say straight face we're going normalize business operations, go patronize places they're risky. far east Asia, people weirded wearing mask nowadays. personally seen anyone streets without mask. Even 80 year olds going walk. Wow , comments article, too. needs time capsule.  sensationalised bullshit get clicks, keeps getting reported Korea China seem daily impending doom second wave isolated clusters keep popping up. Oh god, hit nail head. really physical discomfort rights that's excuse admitting we're/are wrong twisted minds thinking dems taking over. And?? predictive modeling hospitalization rates cases know about?  Samething Yah scientific research shows work lol? Nah, agree you, interstate system pretty decent. course takes longer, cars much viable option essential travel. fair, aren‚Äôt masks normalized Asian cultures anyway? comment replying referring government leaders refusing enact mask mandates. Yeah, like wearing one, know what? like lot things, I'm fucking adult realize actions effect others, bothered put piece cloth mouth leave house, like big ask. writes / speaks tremendous grace class

He uses clear pointed examples

He bothers good science (accepting prevailing medical option may change future! That's good understanding science) evidence based reasoning

He even quotes Bible, shows empathy context opponents claim follow (but actually read)

He position authority using well

These kinds people leaders need time like this. example still hope humanity hope good leadership. hahaha yep what‚Äôs microchip scenario? Wrong again. Sad! you‚Äôre saying they‚Äôve hit testing capacity? Even case, wouldn‚Äôt % positive still increasing? evidence countries dealt virus promptly, go Americans saying spread protests.
Even Melbourne Australia spread protest(again, tiny comparison US protest) pushing back lock down. 

If can‚Äôt help see error scientist information. can‚Äôt help see reason done conversation. Focusing individual vs health society Remember Alamo headline, different day. Expect headline next week sadly. seem socially well-adjusted real world. deliberately misinterpretting me? stupid people exist. That's there's government rules laws. also country invented kamikaze pilot. hope teachers preparing *anything* unless they're getting paid. summer. Idk Denver, get paid summer am, true teachers (or do, pay that's withheld year they're actually contracted work). people want teachers figuring 18 different plans crisis, need get pay time. many teachers already going thrown disease name childcare economy. 

Parents unhappy Distance Learning understand teachers given proper time places, still given proper time. That's entirely creation politics systems little time planning anyway. Distance Learning could improved proper planning, yet fixed much emergency fall closings either. Why? one gave teachers time so, we're always given much stuff do. 

And get wrong, many places *will* close fully open community spread already low. may think close 48 hours cleaning, enough teachers sick reason, schools can't run. enough subs many places, especially outbreaks. schools enough precautions (which means can't full capacity social distancing perhaps important precaution) community spread also significantly halted / low area, might possible. However, many places community spread, full reopen almost guarantees going get weeks school, maybe month, systems see strain can't work properly. never heard hunch, sorry meet standards evidence. dont go fuck yourself. gambling would bet vaccines wont work. expect every country accepting everyone immigrants still think better. Every country pretending melting pot obligation welcoming non xenophobic long killing making concentration camps China. California, Utah, Nevada - Arizona &amp; New Mexico consider South best state probably getting 33% active infections testing. Florida probably missing approx 5-10 times cases. started quietly decades ago took from. We‚Äôre left situation people claim civil rights trampled scream rooftops. worry things lands backyards. read far enough post lot hate filled comments local Facebook page posted on. local level misinformation response astonishing. level hatred receiving locally post mask order preceded sickening me. Great answer!!! I've wondering farts well! Can't count can't test They're old fat, Americans give shit. I'm still going Applebees tonight.  soon give rights never get back. dumbfucks argue mask like wearing hijab.  People think stupid 102 years ago Spanish Flu. * SNOWFLAKE ALERT * carelessly neutral. Protests bit important restaurants, there's nothing suggest they're anywhere near responsible spreading disease. yet. Lol could prevented, got everywhere. happened, that‚Äôs it. Waiting southwest this. employees aren‚Äôt even required wear masks Florida already went lockdown this. states shouldnt entered lockdown NY rather waiting could implement time like this. Gotta love media trying tie people getting infected single event, like went bubble graduation. correlated restaurant spending, protests. Restaurants bars still closed north big fuckin protests.

But think anyone mad protests really wants hear that. 

They want say ""what protests"" even though spikes happening places closed bars restaurants. PROTESTS GUYS AMIRITE look New York! Philadelphia! Chicago! Spiiikes oh wait places decreasing. 

Must Houston protests! Phoenix protests! Florida protests! Carolina protests! reason places closed bars. Confusing! mention, usual Reddit format mentioning another user would u/fred16245. went vacation Hawaii 10+ years ago, lot people Japan. wearing long sleeves sun hats. Many even masks. 

I feel like Japan's culture welcomes even commends overly cautious behavior. Whereas tough ole USA, mocked chicken scared try protect others really dangerous everyday threats. Ah yes, cliche redneck trumper trope. Idiots like got suckered service think superior. see little use brain, bc can't name single thing Trump done make country better - like Trump bc hates 'damn libs'.


I hope family catch covid, weak pathetic triggered Texan snowflake. Sad! many hospitalizations deaths? ""Grab guns first, due process.""

~ Obama requires sequencing virus samples people infected. Coronavirus built-in proof-reading enzyme ensures mutations relatively rare. look mutations different samples build phylogenetic tree shows history infections relate other. example this: fairly expensive sequence genome, costing somewhere around $1k per sample. data gain invaluable. 

Source: work biotech company called Illumina 80-90% world's genetic sequencing. vast majority COVID sequencing data comes instruments. recently released specifically this. concerned safety? forbidding around going maskless? one ""behind bars"" . places fencing 72 hour processing centers order protect younger migrants older ones, due rampant sexual abuse.  can't even imagine fragile can't put piece cloth front face. um,I'm Japanese too.I think got lucky time... clearly chip ass protests.

All evidence far suggests general openings worse protests spread.

Look Seattle NYC, two areas hit hard early, cases increased slightly, gone insane. protests reason South fucked. claim made 7,000 troops died since Iraq war compared 125,000 5 months COVID? read posts reported, would see DONT want kill grandmas...

How many dead grandmas think acceptable number richest nation world have? 1,000? 10,000? 100,000? *""If ‚Äòwe stopped testing right now,‚Äô we‚Äôd COVID-19 cases""*

Flawed antibody tests accomplishes much result. cc: /u/seunoswea

Just FYI, seem like surgical masks much better. There's great 538 article mask It‚Äôs working China &amp; japan bc middle exponential growth like Florida is. Disney even ‚Äúmask off‚Äù ‚Äúrelaxation‚Äù areas park. addition people wear masks eating walking around eating drinking, cast wearing break rooms eating. 100% contribute spread. like restaurant employees testing positive left right Orlando, Disney workers US young country. It'll grow eventually, form anyways That's like tweet saying Covid -19 transmissible human human whataboutism silly one that. due differences number tests would expect drastically decreasing positive test rate, happening. That's everyone needs take virus seriously. still exactly know impact health. 

It's case of: either die fully recover. virus permanent impact functioning body. Hey, can't afford insurance football team civics lessons. ‚ÄúDonald Trump said would maintain protections people pre-existing conditions, said would replace existing rules ACA invalidated.‚Äù

Headline seems bit sensationalist... nba fans abubble testing constantly. focus real news please get coming from, sure, hosts waiters restaurants visiting? restaurant staff typically wear masks customers‚Äô protection, customers aren‚Äôt wearing masks they‚Äôre eating drinking. Therefore, exposing staff perhaps even customers. could argue customers know risk they‚Äôre taking. could even try argue servers hosts restaurant employees ‚Äúfind another job.‚Äù It‚Äôs simple. People get paid. families support. need food table. one other? Banning guns cure coronavirus, federal government going pass economic stimulus. Vote local elections too. Yes people risking health fight cops stop fucking murdering people people thing go bar same. I'm smart. I'd say possible virus around since November - December Minneapolis doing? hear gatherings Protests week behind early reopeners. I‚Äôm sure effects next week two seen evidence protests contributing significantly. evidence pointing indoor gatherings. American problem global people acting like completely selfish assholes?  wonder administration could made difference topic... think actually second time ever Since founding country answer question. Especially since 20th century individual lauded collective America. (Largely private power, especially multinational businesses, want way)  dodged bullet open. requires everyone country wear mask, social distance, quarantine symptoms. 

We aren‚Äôt here. makes heart attack. 4% people 30 hospitalized - question (which unanswerable right now) many sick might long-term issues? It'll corrected eventually. soon, inevitable eventually United States ban private ownership guns.  empirically correct people want hear it. Massive amounts wishful thinking coping going around. People seem understand exactly like said vaccine phase 3, later stage trails even full production means absolutely nothing comes sheer efficacy. That's simple observable truth. nothing new all. Matter fact vaccine funding, time people thrown human history period still exist 36 years fast tracked 18 months 2 years max timeline promised multiple promising starts had. We've before. Disney given reopening? could sworn I've seen headline somewhere sub. key difference Justin bunker boy what?

(DeSantis) x -1 United States wealthiest civilization history humanity one problems could seriously helped essentially throwing money issue short term. People need mostly stay inside next months least. one going pay rent expenses people (or businesses) possible. sense. notion chicago china, wuhan, started raised huge red flag.

Why? ventilation mean it‚Äôs ideal least people sick hopefully able get tested aside want know don‚Äôt put UV lights ventilation systems. 

This always issue well Corona, got Strep plane once. correlation mean causality... still screen shot tge yt live stream reached 100k. increase, total, world wide, wirh China around 75k....

How many add past 24h? I‚Äôll take neither 100 Alex. Yep, 26 here. I've home since 6 month old born week Christmas. First young vaccination coronavirus. remember, yet 20 years ago, collectively agreed give freedoms promise keeping eachother little safe. 

Maybe current events reaction finding government took advantage that, maybe isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm stricken difference punlic unity behind idea keeping safe. literally hate group people based political party alone. That's pretty bigoted. whatever want. hassle people allow inside businesses wearing mask. one expects anything you. endanger others, big ask. Ah, classic conservative wish murder people objects.

Nutjob friend lives Canada, Vancouver exact, says pretty much everyone around wears masks. go much, things needs. think plays big role. think number deaths increase NYC levels? Death Panels exist. Interesting scroll far enough twitter thread (linked article), looks like looking go places get kicked cause scene Well old people sitting around packed bars ‚Äúrestaurants‚Äù day every day Florida. it‚Äôs going blood bath. guess I‚Äôll take word - clue gun law referring to.

It doesn‚Äôt PhD defense actually make reference factual occurrence. suppose I‚Äôll accept it‚Äôs happening everywhere available quick google search. didn‚Äôt happen right? Dumbass underlying study actually conclude that. fact, explicitly say data completely enough make conclusion.

They believe that's best explaination, also say things mask use among protestors may part reason results. big part conclusive.

[The actual study good conclusion section clear straightforward. Starts page 26 PDF. protests I‚Äôve seen Barry anyone wearing masks. Sorry mt friends family hunkering seems like one 30 is, theyre partying, going bars, hanging friends lots times maskless. Puke many different mayors work, animal adoptions appointment only. One family came theirs, even young kids masks. kids crying complaining masks trying remove them. went business. 3 4 year old wear mask without bitching, grown ass adults certainly it. Exactly. tough government force something, matter is. That's big debate here. doubt right infringed upon, however seems justified case. 

But think people fear rights taken away think crisis many laws passed greater good, later exploited freedoms permanently taken away. There's real debate this, again, would hope everyone would choose wear mask given information have. someone‚Äôs calculation risk way means they‚Äôre taking seriously enough this. Thirty minute bus ride windows rolled AC turned protests little this. Besides, occurred elsewhere exploding states.  bulk progress ~~U.S.~~ history world carried minority people drag rest people kicking screaming.  Same, can‚Äôt even wear messing drywall. finally stayed away remodel finished drywall portion. 

I‚Äôm vulnerable population, although I‚Äôm 50 coronary artery disease, kidney disease, 1 full lung &amp; I‚Äôm immunosuppressant treat MS. entire family using masks RARELY go public since end March. son quit job wasn‚Äôt chancing bringing virus home &amp; husband (former EMT) working (IT) home. son started new job &amp; wears face covering work proper social distancing restaurant. leave house contact grocery pickup &amp; doctors appointments. Currently county highest transmission state, I‚Äôm even careful beginning pandemic.

The people don‚Äôt wear masks lot blood hands over, still won‚Äôt give crap. people back ‚Äúpresident‚Äù wanted go CHURCH, yet don‚Äôt empathy &amp; compassion church always tries grill them. PRO LIFE, yet killing people won‚Äôt wear masks rally prevent abortion, hypocrites opinion.

 Suck buttercups, wear damn mask, aware fellow humans social distancing &amp; wash hands! Yeah, I‚Äôm bit angry this. US deserves travel list countries done right thing people.

Yeah, that‚Äôs rant. Sorry, sorta. Schadenfreude feel good, doesn't. im full time student always waitressing side that. get stipend school livable. barely livable, livable! tips nice decided wasnt worth constantly berated customers living mercy unpredictable hours. Try closing churches. live Ontario, Canada, population 3/4 Florida. last 4 days, probably around 800 new cases. think says enough. agree 100%. headline bit focused keeping people safe, order also unfortunately created difficult situation many businesses, large small,‚Äù Ivey said. ‚ÄúIn trying reduce number people interacting others one first Stay Home orders set essential non-essential mistake,‚Äù Ivey mistake,‚Äù Ivey said. ‚ÄúI never wanted create belief administration viewed certain businesses important others. jobs businesses essential important businesses could adequately needed -- distancing face masks -- operating, Ivey said. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, lost discussions people wanted pit businesses called non-essential,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúThat name unfortunate, never viewed function non-essential.‚Äù Wait two weeks

Contact traced anyone protests. tell liberal agenda conservative one somehow touch reality comparison.

I‚Äôd love hear progressives plan pay sweeping things they‚Äôre suggesting. also stay long hours work leave boss.

They're perfect society. OK. There's literally single probability anywhere explanation, though. 400 years ago would wager kind gathering good idea right now. Many big states breaking records cases 24 hours. safe! recalled? Right, opened almost 2 months ago.  ‚Äúit‚Äôs dead world all‚Äù helps done streets. open air probably helped Seems like reason stop driving? Doesn‚Äôt seem safe drive can‚Äôt control outcomes. Maybe places like Texas Florida, Northeast people give shit complain mandatory masks. That's we're recovering well. Americans bitching something fucking minor wearing face mask, sincerely hope get Coronavirus suffer it. never teach people unless make uncomfortable. little lessen satisfaction. USA USA USA USA best country ever death cult point. Use dish soap. Super easy super Oh think know went wrong Yeah still eat out. facility told positive immune.. I'm never going get covid 19 okay... ‚ÄúWrong. Setting kids back years educationally protect people disease kills 0.5% population trade normal people willing make.

This idea lock people indefinitely disrupt lives protect work real life.‚Äù




That‚Äôs saying Here's question people saying protests caused spike whatsoever:

If replaced BLM protestors MAGA heads, everything else exactly (tens thousands people, outdoors, percentage mask usage) would still singing tune? highly fucking doubt it. gonna do, sue state? Send army break blockade? getting source from? exactly figure that? seem dedicated making others vote someone responsible large amount death suffering. Trump responsible needless death suffering could minimized supporting wearing masks. insistance holding large rallies covid hotspots lead death. totally irresponsible.

Biden leading example. wearing mask. supporting recommendations doctors scientists. 

Your insistance comparing exposes either troll stupid. People see bullshit need better leadership trump. 

Later troll. people bare responsibility well. Many people wearing masks refuse so. see somebody sick, directly related close me, order become like reality,‚Äù said Joshua Kwiatkowski, strolling week open-air shopping center Tempe, Ariz. ‚ÄúSo hasn‚Äôt really, guess, sank in.‚Äù Kwiatkowski said inclined wear mask unless required ‚Äî unless, put it, ‚Äúan Uber driver feeling type way store makes wear it.‚Äù

This guy basically saying, needs put finger socket feel shock, else believe electrity exists. people attitudes like this, going take longer get Corvid-19 control. wife reservations campground 4th (reserved beginning year) told family canceled due spike cases. 

And we're immediately outcasts. supposedly 'living fear' now. complete lack understanding astounding really creating tension within family, sadly. hermits freaking whatever fuck need INFECT OTHERS. includes quarantine fine. That's things work. Go NEED cancel unnecessary trips. 2 million counting ridiculously huge, sad part likely need it, more. It‚Äôs funny. Except Dump says (and means wonder many us covid back working public. still complications truly customers screw comment hoax. concerned 4th July comes closer. Fireworks going night droves tourists. masks bubbly be.... oh ignorant. reason someone position reason into- think blm protests causing additional covid spread insane delusional. think flu .2% death rate I've started getting symptoms gotta go get tested. I've still go office half week people wearing masks. office kept chairs doorway one could get past it. wore N95 anytime left office. one got within 6 ft me, yet still got sick. I'm pretty fucking pissed scared symptoms gonna get worse. That's sad. even disconcerting probably much larger number people actually die.

If 10% infected recovering show long term complications, time over, could looking 23 million Americans living chronic aftereffects. know right looking blood clots, kidney damage, neuropathy, lung damage, forms chronic fatigue. 

I get coming though. Sadly mindset refused believe serious go lockdown lockdown working, stopped believing serious lockdown working. Even definitely hospitals struggling, hospitals around seem fine might able pick slack still good(especially I'm sure insurance networks would work)

See source:

- UF health rehab hospital, Alachua county, reporting 4% beds free

- Encompass health rehabilitation hospital Panama, bay county, reporting 1.79% beds free

- Devereux Florida, Brevard county, reporting beds free

- Broward health north, Broward county, reporting 0.43% beds free(a single bed)

- South Florida state hospital, Broward county, reporting beds free

There reporting low beds list them, hopefully patients taken hospitals issues distance. still failure someone needs travel far get medical treatment, especially could die time. definitely shows pressure least hospitals though. It‚Äôs ‚ÄúReddit‚Äù it, it‚Äôs data showing. People protesting social injustice likely adhered CDC stay home recommendations then, no. Ohhh, similar event started Michigan surge. totally agree would devastating! Well, long people keep activities outside wear masks venture indoors, numbers go down. worn mask outdoors going crowded environment, think mask needed people outdoors family near anyone else around. employed durning whole thing make 780 every 2 weeks know people getting unemployment still working working getting unemployment Michigan making money normal sit home drink drugs play video games That‚Äôs right finally ruled illegal? thought bakers recently. going on. possible, it‚Äôs like people taking crazy pills. Like don‚Äôt value people‚Äôs lives!? Anyone calculator figure nationally around 5%  Stop saying shit. Yes people recovered plenty people fucking DIED still. lives literally FINISHED morons fat selfish wear fucking mask stay indoors couple months.

Fuck ‚Äúbut everyone died‚Äù ideology 500,000 people still LOT ask us sacrifice barely lifting finger help us weather storm. single check $1200.00 (which many people received yet, btw) like tipping waiter $1.00 - almost insulting tipping nothing. ""beautiful"" tests Trump promised - better able least diagnose gets disease?

Leaders ""fail control virus"" - willingly threw American working class bus try force economy stabilize barely offering dime return high-risk labor. countries truly stabilized started contain virus, seeing diagnoses deaths ever - making pathetic effort waste time resources, putting ever American lives risk. Hey, Genius. [Minnesota still declining  lot symptomless people it. That's reason spreads fast. think research show lot people first thought. ‚ÄúVegeta, scouter say power level?‚Äù need see cases spike TX Fl understand irresponsible kinds large indoor gatherings.

Football, quarter capacity masks maybe doubt would want that. Thank saying this! See guys tomorrow headline surprising. feel like nothing enforced anywhere, sure even unless business honest. Jersey Shore summer usual, noone seems know there's highly infectious virus causing pandemic based packed [these are. technically open capacities right now, let alone claiming ""outdoors"" insides clearly packed like summer night. Worldometer's COVID-19 numbers always bit higher Hopkins'? Girlfriend ain‚Äôt happen night. Thanks, that's easiest graph (that could find) see visualized. sigmoidal growth continue go &amp; down? considered hit high area once, depend case case basis? 

I forgot site source &amp; can't find right now, seems point area talking specific, &amp; I'm assuming, countries without resources would exponential growth, think see saying reach high can't go higher everyone can/will infected, actually signoidal. Maybe difficult explain it, think I've heard sigmoidal growth, maybe I'm overwhelmed information. 

In case, thanks visual graph easy understand. Google failed me. That‚Äôs true, whataboutism. joe Rogan stop people fat wearing mask? individuals stop fat instantly putting mask? Aren‚Äôt already many organizations try combat obesity? 

he wants economy come back. thinks obese people, high blood pressure, elderly, etc, seal protect themselves, healthy people able live regular lives. country 42% obese... exactly joe rogan think going half Americans house arrest? 

The easiest quickest way get wants wear masks. wants cake eat too; doesn‚Äôt anything stop spread also doesn‚Äôt inconvenienced people dying. Don‚Äôt tell sub!

You‚Äôll tarred feathered questioning omnipresent God himself. history mooching orange clown‚Äôs whistle Guns kill 40,000 people year. suicides. 

Since recklessly discharging firearm populated area could deadly, 2nd Amendment protect idiots caught shooting guns 4th July.

If someone points gun someone know unloaded, even fake, gun wielder shot dead.

The Supreme Court upheld local government laws regarding public nudity, morality.


Over 125,000 Americans died less 6 months.


No one, including knows spewing Covid19, could responsible spreading killing people. fucking duh (We need actually) know would interesting somewhat feasible lawsuit sue trump administration lost wages governmental mismanagement virus. current covid death numbers likely lot higher official counts, time period, US started counting COVID 4 months ago.  Yeah don‚Äôt see dentists surgeons complain imaginary health complications PPE they‚Äôve using decades 21+% potential immunity help spread keep bad first time. I'd say crowded bars definitely worse restaurants. See also gyms churches. Ngl ronald Reagan kinda ruined everything Thanks proving point.

Most 2A people strictly one issue voters that's reason shitty Conservative party. matter else want long protect guns. bar Exactly, 99.8% survive flu 99.6% survive Covid (per medical experts told never ignore) Masks thing Japan handles better US. Take account general health Japan. prime example obesity rate. third Americans obese... meanwhile Japan obesity rate 10x LESS US.

If simple wearing mask versus not; sadly preexisting conditions play large role lethality COVID. Americans: death toll 1000 something write home about. many countries, expected. Australia, whole shut thing last long enough cripple economy actually it. new Zealand even better. ""second wave"" now, around 40 new cases day country wide. total cases less 8,000. huge. that? said schools included study. different hvac systems places? probably archaic lot cases. Go white knight elsewhere. live Boston husband physician. Trust me, I'm well aware issues hospitals facing, we've living since March.

My point educating children, particularly young special needs children cannot learn remotely, maybe prioritized over, say, opening restaurants bars. Damn.

Basically people catch virus recover bubble get bigger bigger risk level Thanks proving point.

Most 2A people strictly one issue voters that's reason shitty Conservative party. matter else want long protect guns. get Apple design sell $40 piece say it‚Äôs newest ‚Äúthing‚Äù you‚Äôll everyone board! Outline link: They‚Äôve tested protestors number preexisting conditions? biggest Seattle, LA others Californians idiots. Also friends LA tell people don‚Äôt wear masks unless taking IG photo. many olympic swimming pools that?  Surge. Spike. Surge. Spike. Spurge. Sike. Spurge. Spike.

Back days, people would eaten could enjoy cave peace. boat you. file 2018, filed 2019 early April, website says still processing. Meanwhile savings almost used up, people talking second stimulus still seen first tax return. increase chance people avoid getting tested fear able work? sounds like terrible idea comment wrong... shoulda made clear talking NY state specifically. understand point. understand mine? almost 53 medical concerns. college degree teach done nothing else, career wise 30 years. close (not quite eligible) retire. go back job choice. think reasonable expect employer ultimate care-taker thousands children, require masks least, supply us cleaning products. likely neither, pissed! disaster...kids adults likely die governor saving back $ school vouchers state Supreme Court already declared state Constitution. educator, understand political crap involved teaching. want damn clorox wipes hand sanitizer. want least attempt make 8 year olds wear masks (a joke). think dedicating life job, much ask! sure still issues, NYC 22,441 covid deaths reported. Population roughly 8.4 million. 

22441/8400000 x 100 = 0.267% Yet Oh yeah leaders failed horribly, huge portion population. American Execeptionalism, individual selfishness, root cause continued spread. Im ny commute long island nyc work. last 2 weeks traffic almost back normal seems. give time well start going again. know people downvoting

Perhaps comparing apples oranges. specifically MMR, BCG.

(BTW, agree BCG useful cat's piss) news, water wet. guys aware numbers fake right? Coronavirus hoax entire world playing along keep lord savior Donald Trump winning 2020 election. Also 5G...something something face masks killing us...something something...Bill Gates...something something... sacrificing babies Satan. extremely disturbing. noticed there's group pushing narrative gaining positive facts. ppl keep popping up. US? Don‚Äôt show trump. dump Hopefully brains tell friends family coworkers tested positive. social distance, mask up, stay home whenever possible, watch symptoms etc. cut spread general population.

That‚Äôs happened someone know. tested positive bunch friends family locked houses 2 weeks level outside contact except grocery delivery. essential workers work weren‚Äôt able work remotely, everything could minimize contact people. friends mostly science education fields...

It also lets proactively watch treat nastier side effects pop people think they‚Äôre recovering - blood clots, strokes, hidden desaturated oxygen levels. know I‚Äôd asking prophylactic blood thinners soon got positive test, plus checking O2 tomes day. decent chunk people get really sick long term permanent health problems this. can‚Äôt count deaths cost includes long term disability. Damn. experience exactly ? said big spikes CITIES biggest protests. see ur username First all, thank wearing mask. understand need freak overstate danger. But, cases hospitalizations continue increase. I'm wondering evidence convince really dangerous situation. add ""creeping young girls"" list, thanks recent Senate election Alabama. definition sociopath. Turning blue depends mail ballot situation pans out. won‚Äôt 1k day much longer. Oh know lot China thanks, would anyone defend it? thinking earlier today.

We decided that, good country, would stay home months make things better. people decided pandemic ""fake news"" went days normal, huge slap face sacrifices everybody else made. anybody got bored lockdown gave up, well, threw away.

It's real bummer see lockdowns *probably* nothing. even fun way promised, ""If goes well, going seem like nothing"" everything ended fine end, ""Well, everybody died anyway"" kind way. Super.

What shows guys gonna watch Lockdown #2? U.S. excells giving thoughts &amp; prayers though Yes. Third World Countries Yea FUCK THAT. 

That's attitude we're rolling right? inconvenience me. liberties stuff. Right? least poke giant nose out. 

/S .../S death feel invincible innocence taken us. 

I thought one million happened. start realize one million situation, someone going one. 

Be safe. Imagine stupid blame huge spike COVID cases Southern states (who reopened early restrictions) BLM protests üòÇ know right? incredibly risky activity banned even *criticized* risky masks mentioned keep **6 feet** others. cloth face cover **not substitute** social distancing. Donny playing Schrodinger's Virus ! I'm still waiting able funeral 1st week April non covid-19 death. way going people whose skulls twice dense osmium feel like I'll lucky safely year late. Pretty sure grandpa antifa insider. False flag. virus dem hoax. really hope right, reality number new infections per day increasing. Even percentage deaths lower, number deaths could still potentially (and likely will) increase there's infections. really find interesting, tell comment quite happy staying ignorant bubble China. Yeah person IDEA they're talking about. Every school university region reopening fall. could tell without mask. look people missing teeth. Brazil: hold beer aren‚Äôt anywhere near half way mark deaths US over. leave state. 

For price get nice place far away home. Gaslighting sides media.

These numbers meaningless without testing context, yet clear many hear puppets read headlines. Imagine stupid blame huge spike COVID cases Southern states (who reopened early restrictions) BLM protests üòÇ Wish Texans best y'all kinda coming. sighed deeply fact based reality. There's typo either.

Yeah, riffing point. fucking absurd. remember early May thinking, ""man. still really prepared anything stop getting like Early april""

Then early June, thought thing. Now, I'm numb all. Administration didnt press conference meet task force since deaths 50k. 

I fucking tons loved ones/friends work hospitals April gave anxiety attack literally every fucking day. right back started. Yes! USMC masks on. ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù possible, smaller company sizes. sure shit ton cases running thru ranks...
And Capt. Crozier taking hit future whistleblowers, won‚Äôt hearing much it. Exactly. Much could avoided people worn masks. Look Japan. Now, KNOW numbers bullshit (everyone knows that), still bad places, almost entirely due fact 95% mask compliance. one force us either, we're adults empathy actually give two shits society fellow humans. interest value find knowing day-by day data like this? reassuring. Especially last sentence. Hoping best trials.. True, ICU COVID only.

If cram full COVID patients, put people heart attacks, respiratory arrest, need medical services ICU provide? Air Force base big enough hospital though? guess least fast planes take people hospitals capacity, good fuckin luck goin houston...

Also Really??? posted idea sub February.

Everyone told crazy. wonder going protesting may part that.

[Here's bullshit 1987 Oh fuck cunt many tests performed many tests performed largest day prior today? like cell cell transmission? Imagine ascribing malice simple human error.

You perfect something? comment aimed entirely system teachers, totally agree you. Education incredibly old system really changed much time contexts, cant see country overhauling anytime soon. I'm sure someone could probably prove wrong though... Poor kids barely damn thing either way. cases states reopened early restrictions, so... Reddit often America! America! doin rite guise? It‚Äôs sad spike preventable, everyone saw happened NYC much less time prepare. takes another level incompetence take seriously seeing bad get. 

Just hadn‚Äôt hit sunbelt hard yet didn‚Äôt mean invulnerable, yet leadership downplayed risk, opened quickly cases actively fought preventive measures like face masks social distancing. people stupid selfish take something seriously directly impacts them, they‚Äôre paying unfortunately.

Using California example justify actions Hotels resorts empty now. get great deals near you. Cases since Feb... Testing low... Otherwise cases kept rising.

By testing low responding slowly..the kept feb, mar, Apr count.

It's still low. deaths still swabbed Back february predicted friends would million infected 250k dead end year. orders magnitude seems. continues it'll what, million dead 15-20 million infected? total number deaths year compared last year numbers totally clear.
Country‚Äôs world reporting deaths different ways.

We're ok, nothing bad gonna happen! Pinky swear! 

/s follow conspiracy subs know thinking it‚Äôs mind boggling Yup, I'm hearing, panic buying might starting parts. still shit show states. Whenever read human deaths large numbers like always reminds Holocaust. 500K worldwide huge number. Holocaust 6M...just unfathomable. Super proud Colorado, loved response Yea like 3-4 times testing. percent positive April nationwide never got 12% around 20% awhile. It‚Äôs 6%. 

I wish people comprehensive comparison April. Local results vary, nationwide posting far better numbers April. wouldn‚Äôt changed thing. NYC here, confirmed working home til 2021, see future little evidence suggesting did.  Depends white enough get arrested killed it. one goddamn tweet orange clown. Seriously, many lives could dumbass save telling flock wear masks finally. trust dude two first names. fool.

[Southern states we're seeing double-digit increased end work restaurant cannot believe many people going (and wearing mask) making money every hour pandemic started. completely insane. guarantee shit again.

Auckland 1.5 million people - largest city - higher population density covering 1086km2. roughly 3 times denser Broward. New Zealand 5 million total. 1172 cases/22 deaths total. Broward county 13'000+ cases, 381 deaths alone.... time I'd plot graph start point. Knowing friends/colleagues states.. US vs NZ societal behaviour very, different. feel hope starts trending soon. We've already seen decisions. got spike. Wonder many people die virus spread riots problem people like parents work family within 100 miles. can't leave 1st grader unattended day tell kid computer assignments themselves. say keep pumping Barista‚Äôs donations even honestly.

Oh, wait, giving suggestions people money, gotcha. read fucking room

The morgue? even bad, bad yet.

CARES act runs July 25th president, Kudlow McConnell says going extension, stimulus, go back work.

Texas Florida month away getting everything control lockdown mandate masks public right now. won't. They'll wait least 4th July money.

First week August going political, economic health care massacre Thank you! Ocho, obviously. count it. Bars already closed, ""locked down"" ever got places. ~5% death rate. Florida man like. ""If get Corona, get Corona... I'm never gonna stop partying!"" 1) states testing others

2) Contact tracers [explicitly ignoring push narrative

3) Reopening started ~8 weeks ago, significant rise cases weeks after.

5) states *did* reopen poor containment measures, resulting lack ""significant rise.""

6) current surge cases coincide perfectly start protesting, time takes get tested results back.

7) protesters/rioters/looters care wearing masks social distancing. killed whatever false hope American had. :c  worlds testing behind ours. yes ton cases, suspicious many nations testing.

[Are sure Sort ""Tested / Million People"" want see testing rates. US 18th. 

But US larger population!

* Italy ~60M US' ~328M, that's 18.3%. Yet yesterday 296 new cases US' 47K+. That's 0.62%.

Repeat exercise comparables testing per million: UK, Spain, Israel, Australia, Canada, etc. kind double edged sword total deaths, ironically. Higher IFR, people cautious, governments can't brush off, try limit infections. Lower IFR, get complacent people become infected, lower percent die, 5x amount infections due thinking nasty flu, may still get many total deaths possibly more. Oh, no. gave RES toolbag long time ago. check /r/all related posts. going guarantee something little evidence supporting it?  Let eat cake Pretty sure canada looking keep united states border closed there's significantly less red map.  According friend mine teaches WA state public schools told make work - shifts students, alternating days, whatever, back buildings least part time next term starts. Contact tracing ...just wait till July 4th travel 

Unpossible country. don‚Äôt governmental structure

Eh men. could fact Florida made effort quarantine nursing home residents instead keeping nursing home get everyone else sick. 

Just guess part, might explain death numbers. There's also fact overloaded hospitals end killing lot people ones aren't, fact learned lot virus last couple months therefore better treatment protocols survivability. First line article:

""Experts said finding probably either contaminated sample separate coronavirus outbreak""

Also note exists several Corona viruses acts like can't anything now. know really late game starting better starting August.

We changed. Surprise!!!!!??!? Checkovs gun. see USA: Give liberty, give death!
Coronavirus: Ok cool, go.
USA : *pikachu face*  read question ‚Äúwhy surge cases matter death rate dropped point two forces sort cancel out?‚Äù phrasing wasn‚Äôt best, agree there. isn‚Äôt valid question ask, minds many people? tbf, also said people like cause this, whereas it‚Äôs actually people going bars, wearing masks, spineless politicians spreading misinformation. u/micahhorner copied pasted comment upwards 15 times thread alone. Why? 

What‚Äôs point..we plenty room hospitals 
Just like Houston, beds non COVID tune like 65-35 %


It‚Äôs problem live. 

One size fits solution they're wearing mask, give nice dirty look big fuck you. Idiots. hate every one ignored science selfish reasons. That's do!!! already feed alligators meth. sober alligator boring alligator. Agree points. also read drastically reduce spread, quarantine mandatory, driving allowed (I think everyone designated person delivered groceries goods), extreme cases, people blocked homes CHINA! Wearing mask isnt sheep shit. Protecting flock shepherd shit. Foder* (: trying kill constituents? can't enforce Orange County, rest state law, recently came strongly encouraged everyone wear mask. rather bizarre. People move country deal people. carry guns ""just case"" balk bristle suggestion wearing mask. think purely tribal/political thing Trump's fault --it need like this. similar news 2 3 months ago. back, literally. readily apparent hospitals decided CEOs. saying true. Lol, JFC. Tennessee won‚Äôt another lock down. way it‚Äôll happen COVID incapacitated succession line someone functioning brain highest list.  Fauci matter fact even says absolutely must something else comes like doctor telling curb cheeseburger intake. It'll wake call lot folks right totally brainwashed largely uninformed. They'll realize they've lied resent that. I‚Äôm happy read comments like this. feel yet people seem come contact 0 common sense. agree, don‚Äôt need cops involved all. Like often do, make situation volatile.

Collective public community shaming good first start. way people begin even begrudgingly accept wearing mask make feel icy sting constant public humiliation. 

Ever see videos people N.Y. supermarket yelling woman without mask? I‚Äôm saying people necessarily get verbally confrontational, majority people area start wearing masks, definitely unavoidable psychological pressure arrogant nimrods like /u/funwheeldrive. 

I already instinctively adjust body language gaze I‚Äôm around people without masks public, notice others, too. 

Second businesses need grow fucking stones mandate them, actively enforce door. two things start happening, people quickly start feeling social isolation ought feeling. It‚Äôs posted twenty million times already. Yeah IMHO Germany, particular, bit pickle. Yes nice cash cushion, outbreak meat packing plant along people already unemployed, drain quickly. Also feel going push production, outside Germany East Europe Asia. 
It's powder keg multiple countries. ever see episode spongebob leave mr. krabs‚Äôs dying body outside push hill.

Cheers ur happy cake day. entire American response COVID-19 quite poorly managed...

*‚ÄùIf you‚Äôre going something, right.‚Äù*

That‚Äôs best expression think ordeal. mention, Trump‚Äôs attempt politicize mask-wearing completely backfired him. Unlike *most people earth*, refuses view virus enemy, lack empathy ultimately downfall. would require Greg Abbott base decisions things like history, science facts. Huge protests Seattle last month extraordinarily high mask use. Close 100 percent. rare see someone wearing mask. went mainly watch. Washington seen increase cases workplace related. Also, it‚Äôs becoming clear major key transmission people working gathering indoors without fresh air circulation staying location extended periods. Crowded offices, buses, trains, plants, bars, parties good examples. That‚Äôs upswing happening mainly warmer places air conditioning common. forgot stop testing too... problem would've gone away. see damage done kid mentally academically hard want working plan send school. kids handling well. Bingo, don‚Äôt deal all. It‚Äôs way free it, otherwise you‚Äôre wasting time convincing matter hard try, degrees, actual hard data. believe you. Prime example...that Mad Mike Hughes guy, smart enough build rocket, flat earther. finally got high enough see earth round, parachute malfunctioned, plummeted back earth, died. bet found earth round day...not admit it. tests sometimes triggered coronaviruses. Different cultures root it. Americans obsessed freedom privacy naturally dont trust government. China lot government control makes mandates listened along military led lockdowns. Add masks already part culture ability effectively contact trace. missed umlaut yes h√∂gmod (pride, arrogance) plays large role crisis Sweden, unfortunately. [good rather entertaining overview unfamiliar peculiar manifestation pride People seem denial aloof facts. instituted mask requirement people taking seriously. before, opened back up, shut again. clear never left first wave Exactly. I'm seeking much information sides possible topic. may see comments I've posted contradictory articles well, also assumptions imperfections. China real contact tracing. South Korea well. China also provided troves information 8k cases assist contact traced studies outbreaks.

It's worth noting U.S., offices many places China S. Korea well countries considered likely source outbreaks never closed. Even today, U.S. scientists nightly news programs saying exactly activities dangerous infection safer, creating continuum makes easier decide activities youll engage forgo long possible. 

In U.S., California keeps throwing hands contact tracers saying family party caused outbreak. would work China, person people source outbreak unnecessarily family party gets attention.

In well known contact traced studies (you know, cause U.S. enough cases new studies), already acknowledged ny South Korean officials entities China nearly 70% spread likely happens home - there's California family parties infections spreading among people household social circle. However, South Korea care people got together family. listed offices, public transport, funeral parlors, restaurants, networking events, church, similar environments riskiest told people were.

The U.S. media reacts non mask wearing insanity, appropriate since politicizing masks save lives height absurdity. would also lot better stop showing photos people beaches, hiking trails, parks every time story reopening quickly. likely source new outbreaks. Wake show poorly ventilated office building windows open called people back working home reason get back looking shoulders. Cause that's likely source new outbreaks.

None developing science airborne transmission best steps stay COVID free getting eyes ears American news audiences. dig gold nuggets information countries took obvious signs mitigation measures be.

Also, since restaurants big problem, bail separate others. Instead they're forced reopen stay afloat getting blame things may share fault office work unnecessary informative last 10 days media gymnastics. Hey now! shoes soles made skin endangered animals, ramps tricky. sounds great without noise, hate jetskis lakes It‚Äôs treason, then. people realize fucking nuts sound Maybe together? Conspiracy ticking. hot ass mess. federal guidance. states, one thing going on. Apparently 300 million doses produced right US Doctors nurses flown cities help save people dying New York... urgent medicine, masks ventilators also transported cargo holds passenger planes. durr Yes? Doesn‚Äôt change fact comparing 26 months Spanish Flu deaths 4 months COVID deaths.

You‚Äôre looking timeline 6.5 times longer.

HUH risk. 

Nope equally get it. bright. 


I'm Mensa That's essentially Trump states. He's washed hands it, speak. We're Graccii Saga right now. Haha, update. Found one friend ones attending virtually. Agreed. 

If look information lockdown Bay Area (the first major area lockdown nation March 16th), consumer spending already started crater. 

If look articles weeks prior that, restaurants dire straights whether need bail airline industry, example. northeast got worst far. we‚Äôre trending due containment methods mask wearing, rest country watched us didn‚Äôt learn single thing. Ah updated wonder many asymptomatic respect craft patience. Cant imagine dealing non believers height right now. cant dumb fucks accept theyll save money drinking home shutdown.. that, many healthy young people take long time fully recover. I‚Äôm young anymore, I‚Äôm healthy shape want part COVID. mean map maker fuck people? Deaths delayed compared testing numbers. see 2-4 weeks. Hopefully it‚Äôs definitely trending right direction told we'd get vaccine early summer. happened.

Not single developer said we'd get vaccine early summer. earliest ever publicly stated September Oxford. September show results, distribution October. Moderna believe also said Fall. Even Chinese vaccines said Summer. later dates mentioned, point anything earlier ever said Isn‚Äôt kind like saying it‚Äôs bullet killed someone...it fact body‚Äôs response unstoppable bleeding? No, see that's Exponential growth works. epidemiologist tell you, R number goes 1.00 infection spreads Exponentially, creating new wave new curve happen point existing curve, even slope. can't declare curve flattened disease eradicated. I‚Äôm 85 wear mask I‚Äôll take chances lmao issue rural counties NY state. Put jail cooperates contact tracing efforts, then. need stop giving idiots enough rope hang us. can't decently courteous member society, remove said society. ""Urges"" stay home , like Abbott ""encourages"" Texans wear mask. Like freedom loving people going say. SMH.  

If Abbott let county/city leaders require residents wear mask, Texas sick people flooding hospitals. guess somewhere dozen twenty.

Some changes happening now, people starting take notice (too late).

So guess curve eventually peak.

Though suspect US discipline Europe waiting numbers drop sufficiently low contact trace every cluster find.

So we'll rinse repeat entire thing 8 10 weeks now. Tests mean much take right actions results. [The US actually top testing per capita atm handling crisis still tests fix failures, obviously still nice have. ded wanted apologize stupid state yes Florida here. Honestly us idiots. us actually care. walked grocery store today, one mask on. assume Monday maybe lock again? God help us üá∫üá∏ mean since January, goalposts haven‚Äôt changed. End 2020 front runners, 2021 roll out, September Oxford, fall roll out.

Things haven‚Äôt really changed...which good sign. Orlando one within next years well. Also Super Mario *park*, themed area. Imperial county worst rn $30k tips?? ...my workplace potentially exposed told us go normal. 

&amp;#x200B;

so. yeah. scary. Masks annoying. Seatbelts annoying. wait pay uber I'm drunk annoying. None things make ""pissed off"" get make names people enacted enforce rules. people refuse wear masks pissed energy back up, counter-productive IMO. Even masks 10% effective would huge everyone wear get country back feet.  exception rule think r/actualconspiracies, response shithole main conspiracy sub Bars open many parts New York State. dine restaurants bars here. wear mask til get seat. posts usually get taken title changed, FYI. post probably wont gain traction lol Depends age child.

If child minor, living home, little choice had. make best crappy situation.

If child legal age, Contact huge possiblity, one could save adult child life confusion, torment, mental problems. theory good contact tracing lock enough 100 keep things flat. virus binds ACE2 infects sorts organs. destined fucked up. process level ignorance people sort mental condition. schizophrenic???

Otherwise could possibly compel stupid. like there's mask industry lobbying wearing masks. Simply incomprehensible. Covid trying do. sons father left, left TX family, belongings money. worked 80 100 hours able afford child care. never given child support, two years son diagnosed deemed disabled. continued work full time, well going multiple specialist appointments every week. Teachers poorly paid treated like garbage. make less degree. ask risk lives bc can't figure make work epitome entitlement. would downplay risks, advise risky behaviour discredit science. People literally identify consumers bars... Lol know werent catching many cases month ago now. statistics still support downward trend infections yet, even taking consideration. deferring educated scientists studying current pandemic. point articles scientists national/international disease control agencies saying ""infection rates lower point past""? texans discipline presence mind isolate wear masks? /doubt ends 5 weeks. Oh Texas recently reinstated work requirement unemployment. Fyre Festval 2020 incredibly invested making sweden seem like end world movie? made like 60 posts corona Sweden. 5k deaths, almost every single one old people. panicked?

Look active guy r/collapse Covid. exciting him, wants society collapse. Philly delaying green phase mandating masks. God I‚Äôm happy never actually ended moving south. We‚Äôre Europe is. actually going safely open feel comfortable leadership. I‚Äôm sorry states tho. Also Florida hospital, 5-6 ICU holds ED given point last night still right now. coded one like 3 hours. sure we‚Äôve diverted yet, sounds like don‚Äôt really anywhere divert PCU med/surg floors. I‚Äôm truly terrified next week look like. think demonizing going cause change? Lol. cases still increase. The
testing tells us many actually virus. looking people make disappear months lol also amputate flesh necrotic save whole body. Cut keep family healthy. let fester get usual American family. Deaths still lowering. cases young people protesting. Epicentercot Yep, let motherfuckers weed out, stay safe. sympathy someone died refused take proper, recommended safety precautions name ""muh freedumb"". Fuck them. needless death bad thing...? Yes, yes is.

For every idiot thinks they're protecting ""freedom"" whatever wearing mask bringing themselves, there's innocent bystander everything could stay safe still got exposed choice former. Ya, saw couple days ago 16K. I'm curious big get. saying, would nice another senile old man leader. He's going fumble words world stage. He's going laughing stock like Trump. Dudes also pervert. Better Trump, next 4 years still going waste. Nothing get done. war science continues, death toll keep rising. 

truly dystopian

i really fear happen affects global warming go effect Pretty much this; I‚Äôm sorry deal that. work microbiology research lab everyone around understands science behind virus. Personally I‚Äôve dealing anxiety knowing I‚Äôve exposed. Conspiracy community lost almost credibility due recent events. used enjoy it, like watching Fox Friends. hate fell many things. Wow - time start student teaching! Best luck you...maybe coming make years later seem like cake walk! Agree. I‚Äôm Phoenix, first ‚Äústay home stay safe stay health‚Äù half assed, lot stuff still open like business usual that's everyone keeps ignoring. Young people may survive (and do) get really sick taking hospital space someone much likely die illness need. Good him. Service industry workers don‚Äôt get paid enough deal people like China fudging numbers again. Hundreds thousands deaths Donald Trump's tiny little hands. Reopen foreign bots ignorant comment. honestly believe nobody knows what's happening China? Cases going tons, deaths remained since peak, least US whole Washington live. me, indicates actually seeing many cases previously been, finally adequate testing identify them. also could see lot deaths next week two, since obviously lag behind cases, i've seeing reports tons cases week really would expected see increase deaths already Hahaha... know, right? buy dozen shuck whole giant bowl lobster meat everyone pick at. Well I‚Äôm curious would keep numbers low state gets $$s reported case? Stop making much sense! taking bets daily numbers Vegas yet? Hate rallies hand... yet see. sound right. Something like 1/500 people living NYC died. saying 99% NYC 45? basically like super Florida? agree, metaphor maybe victim hemophiliac. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs tragic preventable. put mask take garbage out! Everybody stay inside, normalized fear-mongering, usually evening news shit that‚Äôs highly sensationalized would sound different less scary heard virologist, newspaper journalists, exist sensationalize. completely justified, isn‚Äôt. Yes. people comply? sympathy him. 

It's everyone potentially infected others infected people like him...  also drink heavily best times? shit God punishing America good interesting comparison. ideas it‚Äôs way whole country ain't houston I'm supposed *IN* friend's wedding already rescheduled mid-August. Less two months South. way gets rescheduled again.

This cry help. Zhmudenko stays healthy, sky limit him, Ukranians. man up, trust me. know thinking, ""a right handed attacker shake hand grip already reached ceiling success league."" may right, put Zhmudenko corner. Good Jesus Christ. shit brains window lickers ALWAYS victims unseen sinister force. Intersting happens none ever seem leave country..just fanciful fairytale bullshit every years. Wake Obama puts FEMA camp..im still waiting one. 47k May 30th. 

We set replacement date yet. Yup projects bullshit. like rest school. like planned-demic. nothing antibody tests. open unsettled cases.  


And basing IFR anitbody tests, must account margin error test (from 16% 70% - also either test deceased bodies time ensure miss any, must account undercount fatalities well. 


Antibody tests designed test people may virus never tested it, since know people exist. also undercount deceased never tested disease.  


If antibody test designed makeup undercount tests living, equal accomodation must paid undercount deceased never tested. Goof work! would say protests selfish? twitter post guy upset got served rum coke asking drink bartender. post ended ""read fucking room."" Someone knew replied (retweeted?) mocking ""what bar tender supposed get Dave Busters?"" hilarious. Long story short, I've never heard person, whenever read expression makes think writer pompous ass hole like guy was. I'm sure cool dude, can't get funny tweet was. watched happen. China. Italy. fucking New York City. almost fucking nothing. read media sources world. happened read one post it. want another source, please look source below:


Governor Inslee announces statewide mask mean behind wheel test! Yup. almost entirely BLM's fault. Both. WNY, it‚Äôs allegedly going hybrid online. that‚Äôs heard school (going student teaching spring) wife‚Äôs school (full time art teacher). going stagger students either half day full day. Teachers need raise BLM protests related covid-19 cases increases, masks. fact likely spread disease among protest high. 

The real reason protest cause overall increase cases overall social distance cities counties protest decreasead, majority non-protesters reamained inside.

source Yeah... big ‚ÄúOne-Day Increase‚Äù DEATHS?....  USA! USA! USA! world number 1! 9000 hours ago on:

Monday 
June 17, 2019 Protests began month businesses started reopen. fair 2 million lot zeros it! Unfortunately problem located places humor idiots.... would seen coming? property owners still paying property taxes. portion taxes go schools. Funding decrease property values
Plummet like recession.  TX fine. Everywhere far despite fear leading it. Ha ha ha Trump sucking self serving Governor Abbott killed us Texas. He's got choice follow scientific protocol. Monies said inside rally 6 hours Saturday BOK Center wore mask mostly practiced social distancing, except went concourse get snack. said never close president.‚Äù

Think that- assuming it‚Äôs true, anyone failed wear mask social distance even stand chance? People site deluded thinking protests nothing 30 person conservative protests absolutely contributing labeled domestic terrorism. remember left full shit opinion generally doesn‚Äôt matter regarding virus. don‚Äôt understand he‚Äôs governor fucking destroy mayor disagreeing you. Promise commerce board major contracts every city borders ceased tax exemptions. Watch people eat alive put someone say. Governor-township one way power dynamic.  Watch media give Newsom pass. dont think anyone disagree you. Even conspiracy nut texas recognizes right football.  right. not. Houston largest medical complex world. rest country doesn't. wedding supposed October. venue won‚Äôt let us postpone yet way HELL risk loved ones‚Äô lives. wedding people wear masks can‚Äôt hug future husband sounds absolutely miserable anyway. hidden yet. predict 3k deaths day June

And March April everyone shitting pants gonna many dead would bodies street, remember?

tl;dr take betting advice reddit.  insane think pandemic (literally described effecting entire world) US election year?  21 cases call UPTICK. 

They one outbreak ran 2+MIL tests contain it. 

Meanwhile: 

Whatever fuck US doing. acquaintances passing around ""Plandemic"" video like gospel. That's much anti-mask conspiracy nonsense coming from. people understand thay've gaslit, wear masks. Hopefully numbers remain small enough undo good everyone else doing.

Honestly, whole thing societal rot. starts top.

Edited escape bot always deletes uncivil! NJ released guidelines today. gone thoroughly, seems like lot atm. quick impression. know definitely depend school district implement all. understanding staggering schedules well. interesting. Yep, Okies. He's part pro-life party. think Queen power issue anything like rule law -- say wants, course, many people England even Great Britain whole might respect thinks, possibly follow lead -- ""monarchy"" executive power quite while. Erm. Country started reopening precausions ~8 weeks ago. result BLM havoc. heck isn‚Äôt US recovering like world? Canada goof work, Europe, Asia...seems like US getting worse worse. two coronavirus type breed together make new strains? ""It's person's responsibility rob banks..."" Yes, entire fucking world subjected mind controls US election. We're election year Canada, coronavirus infects us mind control power believe Trudeau's hair looks nice.

FFS, people cannot think outside ""USA, USA!!!"" Sadly case. people know insane range 55-75. Yeah millions dead much better intelligent. said virus originated wet market, vast majority scientists agreed that. say epidemic started there. seems like revising previous statements, fine. I'm arguing those. care revision. fuck idiots there?

If ever want border opened again, get shit together.

-sincerely Canada grading curve? March 6th US 365 cases. tragic. Well charge feel sad you.
Certainly conceivable country think of. 450 years praying me.  Completely incorrect. Thank detailed explanation. likely think another national quarantine happening? planning go Spain later year I'm sure whether it'll safe. People thought couple months soft lockdowns virus would get bored spreading killing people would magically go away. go many places America right absolutely idea there's pandemic happening. social security payment covers blue collar jobs duration lock down?

the USA richest country earth. afford it. I‚Äôm sure comment relates said comment referring people willing wear masks selfish contributing prolonged life whatever. I‚Äôve worse shit life laid job living unemployment right now. I‚Äôve lost family death homeless kid horrid childhood. Touch early adult years successful. compassionate also different outlook horrible shit. It‚Äôs want fight this. control situation outlook. Yep, referring HI result spread virus. like Churchill used say- ""Redditors always right thing... exhausting options.""  Well, America currently great yet. maybe want make great soon. depends live badly it‚Äôs hit...and also live okay...hang friends. Probably don‚Äôt go huge rave, judge risk friends chill it, go it.

Humans weren‚Äôt meant live apart, someone lives alone/was emotional state pandemic, living alone hard. Amazing passes good news days. Nobody could predicted voting science denying morons care corporations.

Nobody could predicted playing Russian roulette end dead. Damn fucked US. It‚Äôll expensive us. someone unsure life direction, sure pompous arrogant rude fuck? Everyone knew. People warning bars restaurants ffs. ""You tracing, find cases. I'm gonna ask people slow tracing."" Thankfully testing lot accessible &amp; they're always hard work best treat people come thing. guess NY got hard decent number infections arrived really radar, combined late testing. thanks! step down, judgement fucked death toll WW1 US already ""only"" 50,000 death combats/accidents 50,000 death disease (mostly Spanish Flu). way things looking I'd push it. Especially lose money changing dates out.  till find another story get eyes. media getting people watch station make money. thats it. rich people paying rich people tell middle class people blame poor people. nothing. Imagine country would right nobody locked down. Everybody stayed home socially isolated bit prevent infections deaths. 

The biggest threat always overloading ICUs reaching point healthcare services resources treat critical cases. Spreading infections months still saves lives.

The US response absolute clusterfuck, though. failure test, resistance lockdown, failures distribution medical supplies, favouring certain states others political reasons, huge contracts given unqualified people, enrichment private companies without oversight, pathetic 'stimulus' package individuals, enormous bills people receiving treatment, hyroxychloroquinine debacle, state leaders refusing implement isolation measures, president advocating people inject bleach... backdrop nationwide protests systematic racial injustice police abuse power. struggle think single thing that's gone well. Sorry came bit hostile too, haven‚Äôt best everything shutting down. workin musician, really thrown wrench personal life business. yeah I‚Äôve basically accepted I‚Äôm gonna get die it, die it, like stop that. hope I‚Äôll okay. think best thing transparent activities people associate clear idea risks you‚Äôve taken decision whether take risk associating rather you. friends seen person know precautions (or lack of, people‚Äôs eyes) know they‚Äôve doing. family discuss everything we‚Äôre gonna chance speak member family disagrees something someone else doing. feel like keeping balance best way handle it. Yes risk taking affects people, best thing make sure we‚Äôre page live together, keep people see outside family well informed make decision whether would like take level risk, whatever gauge be. immunity such, don‚Äôt think answers I‚Äôm willing admit course I‚Äôm taking potentially best option opportunity backfire me. I‚Äôve seeing many conflicting things like things mentioned immunity fades quickly reports saying immunity, it‚Äôs pretty solid. hope it‚Äôs best case scenario really make decisions based info now, lot. I‚Äôve also seen tons reports saying COVID much widespread thought, could mean it‚Äôs much less deadly thought. 120k dead example say 20% Americans already it‚Äôs extremely widespread, statistically speaking that‚Äôs pretty low risk (I pulled 20% ass, example). point can‚Äôt really know sure long term effects virus there‚Äôs huge potential bad, could terrible. know keeping lockdown strict social distancing result poor outcome personally, whether career mental health. I‚Äôm willing risk COVID outcome guaranteed bad me, rather option guaranteed hard put lot strain effect health. said course I‚Äôm gonna stupid it, see friends, large gatherings, go public necessary, always wear mask contact others. hope long rambling explained position bit Yes. Last Thursday. Boring numbers. Try 5 million cases day call pandemic See, thing even first vaccine production completely 100% safe still public caution *is* warranted. 6 months talk vaccines take long trials need take long safety reasons isn‚Äôt going great come time public releases vaccine produced record time. good chunk US won‚Äôt wear masks believe shit isn‚Äôt concrete factual basis whatsoever, good luck injecting people rushed vaccine kind. closely packs masses people rallies (especially there's plenty seats spread out, note). Note young/uneducated easily manipulated: **RED MEAT** belong list. let deluded individual manipulate thinking eating red meat way detrimental ‚Äî particular comparison *actual* detrimental things like alcohol/smoking Where's Falcor need him? one dumbest things read today. Gee, wonder way related people deciding protest streets millions. Nah would racist. Actually, cases spiking since 12th. headlines worldometer link. expected week bad bad yesterday today deaths am, too. beginning mess... CA Governor hailed well handling all. among first lock down. change?  Thanks! , really hole thing blows I‚Äôve lost many loved ones last years I‚Äôm prepared lose anyone else. Please show love people care about, life short.  Where‚Äôs Michael Jackson pops eating .gif @ entire USA SURPRISE GOT U CORONAVIRUSSSSSSSS people done supposed to, would‚Äôve needed one month. 

The problem got $1200. problem country filled complete fucking idiots. That's teeth-discrimination! fairly certain responders person  don‚Äôt make connection protests increase covid cases? Ok reddit stay blind You‚Äôre 22 life far ruined. age problem creating multiple successes time 40. got laid bringing decent money 22 yr old. upset see literally big Ass bump get over. hankering hands ""Stay fuck home"" Weren‚Äôt start protests 2 weeks ago? always morons exact talking points, I'm hearing dumb b******* Virginia RemindMe exactly exactly twice age currently am? Commencing early-life crisis get - people realize numbers much worse know.

I saw 500k deaths world wide,125k usa. numbers without question lower true number dead.

And fatality rate uncertain (fortunately) 5%, lower... also means actual number infections much larger... means spread more....

We half way tragedy, numbers still rising. shocked loose 300k US end year. Let die. feel frustrated, I‚Äôm looking objective opinions. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm cautious, family optimistic it‚Äôs somewhere middle. (29, overweight, asthma) live parents mixture pacemaker, obesity high blood pressure. mom thought process can‚Äôt stay inside forever it‚Äôs time start venturing out. longer sanitizes groceries takeout dishes. Still wears mask keeps distance, allowed brother lazily quarantining come over, spend hours house mask. She‚Äôs letting 19 year old step brother go see friend next week promises distance stay outside. Meanwhile, we‚Äôre going moving middle fuckin pandemic cause landlords decided they‚Äôd like live again. struggle anxiety normal day, see could overreacting feel like people around overreacting. live Central Valley California, hospitals city filling quick. 321 new cases today. 

I guess hope best, gonna they‚Äôre gonna do. seem think regardless actual reality numbers it‚Äôs time ‚Äústart get back normal precautions‚Äù. get but....idk man. It‚Äôs scary. true all. Dollars follow kid. Empty seats = less money school. Less population reported census = less Federal funding. Tax dollars never distributed equitably without malice. original, early forecast death toll US predicted one million dead. far protests caused significant increase cases NY continue dropping new cases. believe they're 1% less NYC positive tests. I'm sure elsewhere people NYC distancing wearing masks properly. Thanks Gov keeping us straight.  country, anti-vaxx took multiple western countries, western mindset. need culture shift care communities. real irony western governments seem support citizens eastern ones, yet cultures line up. Close noon? Think scum bag idiots Texas bar 11am wearing masks talking great trump is. swear thought onion. think bad thing Texas though state tax, state depends people spending.

That's reasoning behind whole fucking mess anyway. 

And, governor lt. governor made repeatedly clear.

They've admitted ""There's important things living"" vaccines loaded microchips connect 5G terminals suck brain energies fuel Bill Gates' 6-brained electrolizard monster flies UFO together Elvis Presley flat earth. Perhaps aware area talking about, likely boost chances YES! CORE EVERY SENTENCE Well would job political leadership, translate scientist says actionables. Oh wait... projections wrong time! haven‚Äôt worn mask I‚Äôm going u know types people youll also know wouldnt admit proven wrong 1 thing is. American, want ex-pat that, nobody let us in.  Hfs lunatics

No kidding! Facebook 5-7 years rejoined months ago. Wow. Shitshow! better knowing friends lunatics, too. I‚Äôm going need source claim, big dog. mean Thailand banned US travel? ROAD TRIP, BABY! Hand sanitizer alternative, many used it. remember people school would eat food unwashed bare hands touching germ infested money, door handles, desks, backpacks, water fountains, etc. Bring back King!  What's death count.... real number tracked? kids local daycare CA, someone tested positive. tests ass local pharmacy...it's ending time soon.. Yes, really good news we're figuring beast out. 1k deaths since June 9th. Cases started spiking 12th. expected week bad yesterday today deaths 650. Finger's crossed. next 2 4 weeks telling. 3. first US cases certain areas putting intense strain healthcare. spread US load health care also spread. say one dies anything preventable, ever. 

Do stay night mourning millions people prematurely died heart disease, road accidents, etc. Go outside developed world number deaths related poverty must constantly thing think about. 

I bet things rarely rate single fuck unless know someone affected. Go sell computer reading Reddit donate money starving family. 

Roughly half million people died h1n1, affected much young people one gave fuck comparison covid. world went on. joke, surprised Trumps grasps straw well followers eat up.

""School shootings down. Look Obama. school shootings time. Weak. stopped shootings. one 6 months."" They‚Äôre much better! Currently living St Louis. Things ok here. hope mask mandate keep way. Leading infertility? idiots hoping herd immunity could pushing us extinction so. would neat sneak peek 2025. sure released earlier October.Because flu season. anyone started petition impeach idiot? Begs question though, inherently wrong police refuse enforce laws believe in? punishable higher level?

Instinct says yes, law discriminatory, puts people risk? still enforce it? Shit always complicated legal illegal. great man said:

""don't know ain't devil thats god he's drunk "" comment made days ago:

I understand people utilize KN95 masks often United States. Share information friends family, especially vulnerable (media seem know care):

It's really prohibitively expensive obtain proper KN95 masks, companies (Amazon, Costco, anyone really) could *easily* afford protect employees *effective* face coverings (especially bulk pricing, especially times 'hazard pay') daily basis. 

It's relatively easy find devices (besides 3M) approved non-NIOSH alternative respirators FDA's [emergency use I'll give example; quite possible approved devices available cheaper, can't bothered cross-check EUA list online retailers. Also beware counterfeits non-approved devices (some provide little protection).

Anyway masks passed CDC's [International Assessment Results ‚Äì NIOSH-approved test flying colors. 10 pack $25 directly (purported) eBay store. I'll link it, r/hailcorporate, read far still can't find proper place, I'm sorry (will dm extra lazy).

At price, *this* long pandemic, almost irresponsible immediate access respirator. use devices high risk environments situations (or, daily) would certainly advantageous U.S public. must worn properly effectively 'work' healthcare environment, wearing one better none environment (probably even [Ron *still* made face coverings mandatory). 

If demand created 'approved' respirators, price would hopefully fall. Also, better legitimate brands there, I'd happy know. $25/10pc shipped sounded reasonable me. That's 10 times interact public feel reasonably safe!

**Tl;dr:** less price coffee ($2.50/piece), every U.S. citizen could protect new, legitimate, KN95 face mask *daily.* country would probably (have) crush(ed) coronavirus transmission rates KN95 use commonplace, East Asia. 

Small price pay, considering $2T taxpayer money done little quash actual pandemic.

**Edit: know little manufacturing capabilities Chinese global factories; almost certainly ramped since February 6, [this BBC claimed 600,000 daily production China. written many factories retrofitted produce PPE global market, especially countries failed curb pandemic.** deaths tho. deaths at. thats care  Cact-ass situation America global Karen get together peeps Future kids United States Europe read plague way American kids today read Irish potato famine. We‚Äôre already manufacturing America. y‚Äôall always speak things don‚Äôt know anything about? almost forgot toilet paper hoarding... mean Hitler? Sidious used Dictator Playbook Vat tweest! politician make decisions either kill people not. Go bed thinking once. Honesty facts lose panicky anger shit president here, everything politicized. I‚Äôd love someone capture worst doomsday takes subreddit historical purposes. similar post made beginning June referencing curve, equally dismissed ‚Äúwait two weeks‚Äù meme came along predictions 250k deaths end summer. Still decreasing. Boy brilliant society ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è could wrong wouldnt people serious complications? Would 19 year old bad mild cough fever longterm effects? Every time turn TV see death tolls displayed, wish could take footage, save it, forward everyone 2016 saying ""Come on, give Trump chance. What's worst could happen?"" People hold opinions will, I'm people expressing ideas even facts skewed.. 


But dear friend hospital, already risk dying, virus top condition.. Seeing entire community scoff simply wearing mask disgusts me. I'mma say it. Fuck done this. Fuck even THOUGHT this. killing innocent people pride soulless, selfish, negligent monsters. Everyone around northern Idaho STILL thinks overblown fear mongering. really can't understand it. unintentionally pursue ruinous herd immunity strategy?

its unintentional 

honestly people keep electing shit republicans? 0 leadership all. time problem arises throw hands deem hard anything about. 

global warming? cant anything! 

corona virus? cant anything! 

get dumb fucks office... americas chickens finally coming home roost. anti intellectuals fucking us raw ass Sounds like GPS data. sacry 'smart' big data. 4th July weekend coming. expect Florida start showing cases going down. 3 day weekend get tourists economy! did. links posted give sources context poster saying. Oregon; one county (Lincoln). also people color exempt, persons disabilities, medical issues, etc. also posted directly county website others could see complete directive. Um, everyone unfortunately wear masks Canada.

White people looking you!! #STOP TESTING WON‚ÄôT BAD

/s want give impression agree you, totally do.

But think missing intended correct:

There never one person per capita, like saying ""more people per person"". would never make vaccine level effectiveness distribute it.

If vaccine actually harmful, 20% effective, decreases transmission considerably, sort like wearing masks. could help stop epidemic. fantastic governor Europe ""enlightenment"" culture Ya, probably situations, truthful. put number feel also it‚Äôs real number don‚Äôt look terrible. made rookie mistake approaching football samba way world champ.  Build wall!!

And u gringos shall pay it!! .0006% beat curve, guys. Idk me, continuously posting updates case totals US throughout day missing mark. states report cases til end day, reporting 20,000 cases afternoon may give people wrong impression, mislead thinking cases dropped previous day. something added post's title clarify incomplete data. importantly people still pretend protests cause spike cases know fact masks 100% effective stopping spread virus? Going without cause fucking world wild catastrophe going cause protesting civil justice. Idiot [really now?](http://www.censusscope.org/us/map_nhblack.html) economy started tanking ago lmao corona cause accelerator Dates little fuzzy, China tested 2.3 million people Beijing days ago. They're testing around 250,000 people day! comprehensive universal test, far it. 

Also, use tracking data really different Korea does. geolocation tracing automated alert. fair numbers, LA county populated county US. next 2 biggest counties even close, even combine 2, LA still more. *Looks map*

... uh-huh. Actually looked it, spikes caused protests. fact contract tracing showed caused often things like AZ checking in, fucking clue governor past months... 

trump done *worse* nothing, actively helped virus spread like battle royal corona theme partyüéâ Incredible manage escape mind control end sane ones around. Deaths though least there‚Äôs way treating now
A better way What‚Äôs from? It‚Äôs genius Sheriffs certain counties told Newsom wouldn‚Äôt enforce order we‚Äôre basically screwed - health supervisor San Diego doxed people hate masks groups online encouraging people attack house. happened already Orange County health supervisor resigned threats family made. It‚Äôs like mob rule places here. Brazil way ahead you, bud. Mayor Rio declared reopening hair salons even tho city 100 deaths today. Yea, like flu it. Thanks random unrelated fact. Come man, think fucks sake.

Storks obviously can‚Äôt carry babies masks on. one, matter could certainly argue crime humanity. flu vaccines... Try reading mad pay much health insurance.   new cases, everyone's back panic-buying. Actually looked it, spikes caused protests. fact contract tracing showed caused often things like parties

&amp;#x200B;

 high ww1 deathtoll barely troops ww1 begin with. covid death numbers totally normal. even 0,01% US population now. Die flu season hear that. ain‚Äôt Etch Sketch. start business. pay $500,000 per year. Consequently cash left end year. Wheeee... non profit.  Look, trying start fight idea businesses house doctors... highest paid people states, nonprofit absurd.  

Average hospital CEO income $3mil, 95% 10 years 2015. ortho surgeon pay went 25%. Many health ceos make $15mil.  know ""non profit"" sector dramatic increases? 

Health insurance SOARING result. Sumone pay income right? 

I went high school guy oncologist Dublin Ireland. makes nothing compared US oncologists he's happy lives lovely life. grew England.  Doctors comfortable, Uber rich like American doctors. US medical pay obscene.

I ran non profit 5 years. volunteered. one took salary. know real non profit works. please, assume know. 

Hospitals nonprofit. (excepting, maybe, rural hospitals).

Mic dropped. state increasing cases. I'm college. Campus still reopening month. think getting covid helps party involved. wish potentially deadly disease anybody, bad taste even poetically ironic. Haha..Good luck that...Americans following rules..?!..My county stated bullshit dine restaurants reopening. Basically saying..Our county (in Cali)needs revenue... Good luck..It's die.. That's roughly one every 8000 people. 

In one day. don‚Äôt understand comment situation gets vote, reddit *insert* eye roll US serves example world avoid Yeah sounds believable, imma need source agree here, implications German think found OP referring to. Chinese German scientists independently saw decline antibodies previously infected patients. (Up 80% antibody reduction 8 weeks infected people didn‚Äôt show symptoms)

But possible effects still unknown (How many antibodies needed prevent reinfection example) Here‚Äôs good decision, mask. That's fucking stupid quarantine go hospital child 2 days ago.

They delivery service? Philando Castile white. toss honestly. someone friends family Canada like comment. Stay safe American friends. Happy cake day dweebs alive fucking disease mainly kills boomers. 90% population dangerous all. One day time It‚Äôs nuts, right? Barely gets decent TV, sound system? putting name doxxing reasons, today's top post sub 'lockdown scepticists'. bailed protest hairdresser April made drop charges her.

And cites reason ""not able"" enforce masking blames Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins preventing so. 

Despite going jail defying executive order Abbott made tearing restraining order preventing going business. 

He's lying fucking whole time, blatant every time he's news. yet people already thinking everything back normal. fuck them. watched inside edition clip braindeas family hosted party 18 got covid dad's life support. much people fucking stupid ignorant. big portion recent rise worldwide cases attribute increased testing, compared say April May? Yes. I'm 100% going echo chamber right now. tell 1 person think irl bc even hint around bad friends get really uncomfortable. hate it. know really soon going keep mask also remain secretly optimistic. read comment chain shitcunt. THAT'S call pointlessly contrary internet say names order prevent doxxing. Put scepticism lockdown reddit search function. willing give health lives money. problem preexisting covid exposes broken US societal values. Easter ever think there‚Äôd first lock ? Treatment protocols. Doctors hospitals getting much better getting ahead disease. still dangerous, significantly less March. Part flattening curve giving medical professionals time learn help patients fight virus effectively. Good bot! It‚Äôs already much areas California - hospitals nearing capacity counties already. I‚Äôm supposed teach 200 middle school kid‚Äôs 6 weeks. F L Ha, funny confident this. 8 weeks declining stable rates, think next two weeks gonna completely different, huh?

As elderly vulnerable taking precautions? hospitals nursing homes prepared? 

You tell avg death rate gonna mid July.  someone told happen! worse. Yup, certain places still lockdown, black lives matter, part, idiocracy wearing masks rampant....so old shit, different day. Sure, think best way explain analogy:

So basically, imagine super tiny island vs. super big island number people - let's say total 10 people lived both. island think would greater chance citizens catching COVID-19? Probably smaller island, right? Since opportunities people bump respiratory droplets shorter distance travel order reach individuals smaller island. say small island small population density since less densely ""full people"" super big island.

This basically seeing COVID-19 cases populated cities US: New York, LA, etc.

So, point is, lot countries much densely populated USA, meaning worse pandemic; densely populated countries, South Korea, higher chance people crowded one area USA. However, even this, densely populated countries light years better us outperformed us every way possible.

That's whole shitshow embarrassing major failure. appears Chinese publisher, they're wrong US leadership placing elite business interests lives everyone else America. Probably thing UK week's time.

China imposed rules ONE designated person per household allowed go every days food medicine. would typically youngest adult, therefore least susceptible getting sick. person would required file notice plan government. 

Then, went required wear masks.

Where went, often checked fever, many places implemented 'contactless' pickup, avoiding face-to-face contact.

If someone became infected, Chinese government tested person, entire household, contacts - standard case management.

China removed infected people isolation quarantine prevent infection family members - brought Reff 0.3 so, China eradicated COVID-19 domestically. Chinese actually pretty happy this, greatly reduced risk one person might infect rest family. It‚Äôs starts. spreads vulnerable too.

Around anyway. Americans still get enjoy sweet freedom getting haircuts drinking IPAs think highly likely 2nd wave might deadlier first, already somewhat plausible mechanism pending results research.

A days ago, study came suggested patients mild asymptomatic may carry immunity 2-3 months. Then, week two study done similar cohort showed 1/3 patients significant lung damage months infection, even mild symptoms.

If findings replicated, imply thousands people infected first wave, may even known infected, may reinfected fall, since longer required antibodies. since lungs damaged, people would high-risk group virus, without aware it. since people would 20-40 age group, previously believed relatively unsusceptible severe infection, steepest rise fatality rate would likely occur among individuals. result, overall fatality rate would much higher 2nd wave, would also far likely affect young previously healthy individuals.

I think similar thing may happened 1918, although since antibody tests detection asymptomatic patients available time, speculate. leg work, researching sides anything own, way. Take u want believe it. That's you. ones gonna hold ur hand  thought got 9000 yesterday. migrated Australia family became citizen 10.

## Waking 'blur'

When Stephen Cameron first ventilated early April, million cases coronavirus around world. doctors woke up, 12 June, excess seven million. Vietnam avoided worst virus. recorded case community transmission since 16 April.

""I never thought would take long 10 weeks wake up. remember roused, remember getting tracheotomy, remember wheeled hospital corridors - next days blur.""

From recovery bed private room Cho Ray Hospital side Ho Chi Minh City, transferred taken ventilator testing negative virus, Cameron feeling fallout several months motionless severely ill.

He's lost 20kg (3.1 stone) muscles wasted effort swing leg even inches. He's also suffered severe fatigue depressive lows since waking up, addition nagging fear post-traumatic stress could around corner.

""I've lot mentally. Right now, want return home. lack noise heat miss most. There's buzz scooters' horns monsoon season. Fifteen degrees back home nice.""

## 'I need get back Scotland'

In past weeks, he's visited bedside procession doctors nurses, also high-ranking diplomats, government officials politicians. recently, hospital room played host British consul general chairman Ho Chi Minh City's People's Committee.

He recalls mayor promising he'll ""be back England soon"", swiftly corrected.

""I told him, get dumped England, happy,"" jokes. ""I need get home Scotland, 400 miles away.""

There's also practical side Cameron's desire return home soon possible. twice-daily rehab sessions receives made difficult language barrier medical staff speak good English. Rehabilitation severely ill patients ICU always delicate dance. Progress pitfalls faced equal measure, dragged several years.

The hospital, Cameron patient, dates back Vietnam's French colonial era - one country's leading medical facilities

""I feel like I'm taking bed somebody really ill could take.""

## Beating odds

But care come free. Ecmo machine costs $5,000-10,000 (¬£4,000 - ¬£8,000) day operate reliant one eight-and-a-half weeks.

The ongoing wrangling cover costs causing stress diverting attention away recovery. first, Hospital Tropical Diseases paid pocket treatment. Then, seemed British embassy would intervene. work insurance eventually covered cost. funds stay Cho Ray Hospital still air.

""It's become really, really frustrating. beginning, I'd send insurance company email would say: 'Yeh, we'll sort that'. Now, response 'We'll deal shortly' nothing seems happen.""

There's place Cameron Vietnam Airlines flight back UK 12 July. Meanwhile, planes continue shuttle Vietnamese nationals back Europe, declared fit fly week ago, Cameron confused can't return home sooner.

""As I'm well-known public figure now, everything case controlled government.""

The politics return reminder miraculous recovery Patient 91 story Scottish pilot beat Covid-19 beat odds. story developing south Asian country turbulent recent history beat odds too. ‚ÄúWe send bill‚Äù Hey dont forget Chinese trolls either, equal rights shaming **""If I'd almost anywhere else planet, I'd dead. would flicked switch 30 days,"" says Stephen Cameron hospital bed.**

The 43-year-old Scottish pilot spent 68 days ventilator, thought longer stretch time patient UK. hospital hometown Motherwell, Vietnam's sprawling hectic Ho Chi Minh City, close friends family thousands miles.

Cameron, last Covid-19 patient intensive care unit Vietnam, sickest doctors deal outbreak.

The country, home 95 million people, seen hundred confirmed cases, single-digit ICU admissions single recorded death. rare case Cameron's severity Vietnam, every minute detail recovery reported national newspapers TV news bulletins.

He's known nationwide Patient 91, moniker given public health officials fell ill March.

""I'm humbled I've taken hearts Vietnamese people,"" says Cameron. ""And I'm grateful bloody-mindedness doctors wanting die watch.""

## '10% chance survival'

Dozens Vietnam's intensive care specialists held regular conference calls discuss Cameron's condition.

""The small number critical care patients meant anyone severely ill got attention country's top-level clinicians,"" explains Dr Kidong Park, World Health Organization (WHO) representative Vietnam.

For much Cameron's two-and-a-half months medically induced coma, depended Ecmo machine, form life support used extreme cases, survive. machines extract blood patient's body infuse oxygen, pumping back in.

""I'm lucky lasting effect seems legs yet strong enough hold me, I'm physiotherapy twice day,"" says Cameron. ""At one point, friend Craig told Foreign Office 10% chance survival, planned worst - gave apartment started things somebody would coming home box.""

Since regained consciousness, describes several tearful phone conversations friends back home, ""didn't think \[he'd\] ever come back"".

Doctors contend multiple complications Cameron coma. blood became extremely sticky leading clots. kidneys failed meaning required dialysis lung capacity plummeted 10%.

""When came press needed lung transplant, apparently loads people offered lungs, including 70-year-old Vietnam war veteran,"" smiles. ""But would double lung transplant ended well him.""

Despite outpouring support Vietnamese people hundreds thousands dollars spent Stephen Cameron's care, reaction first tested positive virus less welcoming.

## Buddha bar cluster

Cameron became ill weeks arriving Vietnam early February. Like many Western pilots, he'd headed Asia ply trade higher pay booming regional air travel industry. Two nights due pilot first flight Vietnam Airlines, night bars clubs set shut Ho Chi Minh City contain virus, headed meet friend expat bar upmarket district city.

At time, Vietnam fewer 50 confirmed cases but, according Prof Guy Thwaites, director Oxford University Clinical Research Unit based Ho Chi Minh City government advisor infectious diseases, population ""already healthy amount respect fear virus"".

It weekend St Patrick's Day, Buddha Bar Grill packed revellers wearing Irish fancy dress Cameron arrived 22:00. ""I drink, largely kept corner, played rounds pool went home around 3.15am,"" recalls.

However, developed fever, day maiden flight, 12 others bar tested positive days following, sympathy among locals short supply. Buddha bar cluster, became known local press, single biggest outbreak coronavirus south Vietnam, infecting nearly 20 people indirectly directly.

And social media, Cameron, criss-crossed city taking sights, blame.

Despite proof source outbreak, one prominent businessman, Luong Hoai Nam, labelled Patient 91 ""time bomb"". called foreigners breaking rules deported, earning plaudits followers social media

""There seemed desire pin coming abroad, visa run Bangkok week earlier,"" says Cameron, who's convinced infected Buddha bar, source outbreak.

""I first person put hands say: 'Look feel well'. inevitable would blamed.""

## Rapid decline

On 18 March, Cameron admitted hospital testing positive virus, authorities moved swiftly shut bar quarantine everyone apartment building. total, 4,000 people linked Buddha bar outbreak tested.

""Patient 91's condition got worse quickly,"" recalls Prof Luong Ngoc Khue, serves Vietnamese health ministry's Covid-19 taskforce advised Cameron's treatment. ""There worrying decrease function lungs, kidneys, liver blood flow.""

With condition deteriorating, Cameron remembers taking bold decision asking ventilated. ""I exhausted sleep thought: 'Oh, put get sorted',"" says. comatose weeks weeks end, doctors agonised treatment. Meanwhile, small number ICU patients Vietnam recovered went home.

All while, case gained prominence, top politicians promising put every effort keeping alive, hospital temporarily footed bill spiralling costs care.

""There's lot political kudos Vietnam take recovery,"" observes, ""and keeps record, pretty phenomenal Covid, very, low.""

Prof Khue insists Cameron get preferential treatment, however. ""We focused treating sick people highest level, terms facilities human resources, regardless whether Vietnamese abroad,"" says.

But gleefully reports ""49 50 foreign patients recovered discharged hospital"".

Hey guy us acting retarded buddy, us wear masks wash hands friend. We're surprised?  see nutcases Florida freaking city council mandating mask wearing?

Good luck making freaks wear ""the devils mask"" FREEDUMB! Finally, good news today. first heard Rohingya genocide article called, ‚Äú[They Threw Baby title couldn‚Äôt forget even wanted to. situation Myanmar bleak barbaric, makes lose hope humanity. I‚Äôm thankful Indonesians stepped help even hundred Rohingyas need. due protests expect places like Minneapolis, DC, NYC Portland etc source spike cases. Instead seems places reopened quickly fewer people wearing masks, practicing social distancing disease seriously day day lives. 

There's also moral difference protesting police murdering people streets Karen wants haircut, stuff face restaurant go couple bars party. agree much posts.

This obvious everyone. Even opening early impact consumer sentiment risk-averse folks. top that, resulting shitshow, people lock again. I'm really afraid US become next months.

As you, best luck mate. seem right one. collapse already started 19th century. would forsee us collapsing coming decennia. Im neither Chinese american wouldnt care either way. point merely demonstrate isolation never good idea state body choice many people wont anywhere stay inside dont go work USA! USA! USA! Surface transmission deemed spread well thought. Penn State study CDC estimate cases actually 9 million 20 million assume cases MN. knows. saying 3k cases day early June May 4th. There's rhythm reason lot this. better way compare, top comments fearmongering instead giving valuable information, helpful imo. U.S recorded deaths yesterday, bringing 7-day average 604 - lowest number since March. 

However, even though US testing since previous peak, worrying recent increase daily new cases positivity rate increasing significantly since last week. shows signs increasing spread population, meaning US way toward second wave.

P.S. find best way analyze impact COVID-19 country look excess deaths Rona poppin science always telling worldview wrong, they‚Äôre biased findings. 

This strong statement. sub-out word science even. emotional reaction wrong pride stubbornness provokes.


Science still new kid block got might side Religious leaders learn adapt well maintain power. Three months later Texas predictable disaster. Glad see ""two weeks"" nonsense given clearing though. Outside high density pop &amp; international travel locations, spread obviously complex that. name Amber Gilles. fuck's sake, stop bullying people name, shit sets bad example children. normal feel like we're fucked instance, fucked instance. best do, hold onto sanity let gaslit us. wear masks vaccine ready. can't stay home then, unless wealthy. üòÇ America biggest, best, good aaahhaahahahaha.........AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.... oh wait live here. FUCK starting remind Spanish flu, except back much less medical knowledge technology people certainly immediate access information spread disease, prevention treatment sitting magic device right pocket. 

But apparently none matters bc lot us lost ability basic common sense. feel bad people going get sick die lose loved ones this. doctors workers clean mess put constant danger due actions idiots. heartbreaking. insane.

I checked numbers make sense. understand models publicize. six days ago houston released model saying hospitalizations would peak mid july. week positive cases spiking texas, f--- think peak 3 weeks? Remember early models? ""US deaths could hit 100,000 October"" hahahahaah hit May!  get that, maybe become less political mask seen like accessory, say pair sunglasses, like medical equipment.  math: 100k per 20m infected (estimated 6% population .5% death rate) remaining 94% would mean 1.65 million dead, rate now. God helps help themselves. Bible state anywhere whatever hell want God set things right. That's idiotic wishful thinking. I'm talking Reddit experts. Hell New Yorks deaths vs average deaths ends dropping (it looks like far - still early say) UK report could right large chunk people dying actually terminal going die next couple months anyway. saying that's good thing, far media Reddit experts assessing whole thing. Yes actually last 600 payment week ending july 25th states except ny maybe couple others. see difference China arrests imprisons anyone speaking official story countries free speech, nothing discuss. You‚Äôre blind abuses.

Your analogies don‚Äôt take basic human rights violations surveillance citizens China 24/7. Two weeks protesting without masks.... right Chinese propaganda. I'm subscribing shitstain sub anymore. /r/China_Flu way better anyway. visit folks. reported cases high notice aren‚Äôt releasing number recent deaths. low. think opened early another example news getting people worked up. Had\* sure noticed economy toilet right now. rest world needs isolate Americas. No, not. ...where history isn‚Äôt taught, revised. ramp mask production, also banned mask exports every citizen could get needed. Taiwan also already mask-wearing culture; visited two years ago common see someone wearing mask sick, allergies, etc. social norm expected didnt get others infected. point, Taiwan well they're giving countries hundreds thousands masks supplies. 

Quarrantined individuals also paid stay inside, speak local health official least day. course, hurt healthcare universal-- visit doctor even specialist happen day, little cost. healthcare system strong even uninsured pay USD seen. Damn, new cases New Zealand people flying they‚Äôre mandatory isolation. 
We‚Äôre living life. thought libs said would take 6 7 weeks see spike, already trying backpedal saying would already seen spike protests. make shit go along.

Umm. condition restricts respiratory capacity much, additional respiratory strain put upon would cause untolerable problems. Of, course, that's problem, would able leave bed then...

Any severe skin disease mask area aggravated pressure rubbing ‚Äì infected fresh wounds, impetigo, severe akne, ulcers, (sun) burns, sever facial mykosis.

Any painful condition mask area ‚Äì tooth abscesses, parotitis, trigeminal neuralgia.

Posttraumatic disorders triggered mask wearing.

Debatable panik disorders (should self-terminating forced wear mask, without accompanying psychotherapy that's probably traumatizing). data matter anyone else that's claiming due protesting. Yet stop people blaming protests. responsibilities rights.

Quote month right here. people need understand this, lines basic manners taught 1st grade. really know people panicking cases. Yes virus everywhere protect weak ones. live Holland situation control, number cases increase massive testing. protect elderly, responsible go places lot people inside. outside, virus proves contagious. I'm saying mosh pit whatever, stop panicking please. responsible, rational citizen everything allright folks! are, sure. 200k likely tip iceberg, testing almost everywhere needs be, course daily case totals seems growing quickly global level. America baddies since long time ago Trump. country founded genocide slavery. starting colonisation Philippines became major global bully spreading death manipulating countries (including supposed ""allies"").

Good thing Trump makes clear everyone selfish cruel United States is. sickening think Trump USA goes back pretending respectable member international community bombs keep dropping, regimes succumb American demands get changed Americans keep living like spoiled brats rest world forced treat US dollar gold. hit peak? March 2019 Barcelona sounds improbable number reasons. got kidding me. Wearing mask definitely prevents germs spreading easily would people wearing masks. 

And course, wearing mask. also social distance stay home much possible. runaway pandemic damages economy. People go spend much $ feel safe. protests? still ok? true. Increasingly Scotland moving towards progressive Scandinavian model (I mean spesifically Covid response). measures thoughtful country.

Here: incorrect. way worded many people falsely took saying surface transmission viable actually said, ‚ÄúThe primary important mode transmission COVID-19 close contact person-to-person. Based data lab studies COVID-19 know similar respiratory diseases, may possible person get COVID-19 touching surface object virus touching mouth, nose, possibly eyes, isn‚Äôt thought main way virus spreads.‚Äù

When mainstream media released article, clarify advocated surfaces safe. They‚Äôre not. definitely viable means transmission, primary means infection. actual fuck?!  Fucking fuck, entire crowd. Vote. 

All you, everyone, everywhere, VOTE.

This shit gone far. least chase office memorialize tragic failures leadership, warning successors demand competent representation.

Sarah Palin. Yes Brazil (and many nations) probably reporting deaths. going happen. soon vaccine comes US back major player international politics. US still lots lots exports lots lots imports. world superpower 330,000,000 people become bit player world politics pandemic lasting less year killing small percentage people. There‚Äôs plenty countries fine without authoritarian governments.

America *that* stupid. know wear masks? community spread. Yay. Australia. That's thought. really park much large closed business area people use exercise. sometimes go jogging parking lots morning, lots trails buildings others use, keep distance really well. think goal. Many nations exceptionally tiny, case couple, really trustworthy reporting. Overall, United States performed far tests, total, nation. percentage population yes test more, absolutely, tested anyone else. Way go everybody proud everyone helping us break records everyday  wanted use critical thinking asking person citing article pertains single state talking country-wide spikes.

Oh wait, fit narrative. Phase 3 trials generally take long time wait enough people placebo group contracted whatever vaccinating demonstrate statistically significant prevention effect treatment group.

If working something people rarely come contact virus, takes long time achieve endpoint. working vaccine disease active pandemic, happen much quickly. One mentioned happened- I‚Äôm thinking correctly crossroads. mom still lives there, every time drive place flip off. advice look meaning /s Oh mean thousands people standing together day affected rates all? Now..if happened Iceland would quarantine everyone there... love movies. miss movies. Doubt I‚Äôll see one theater there‚Äôs vaccine.  always thought diagnosed cancer would everything hadn‚Äôt done far.

People slipping Vancouver tho - I‚Äôm seeing 30% masks indoors, lots gatherings lax social distancing. see busfulls people one wearing masks bars starting pack despite capacity limits.

I really don‚Äôt want go back stringent lockdown, people act like there‚Äôs still vaccine, fully effective treatment, easily one worst hit countries immediately south us Americans taking advantage Alaska loophole come vacation Canada.

Not NYC are. week investigation, found state reports follow-up positive tests new case. 

So employer fedex UPS required 2 negative tests continue test positive 5-6 weeks, good chance positive tests reported new case. 

I know one specific case counted 5 total new cases ‚Äúsickness.‚Äù 

July 3-4 interesting see active cases are. I‚Äôm curious Florida‚Äôs 14 days. part testing handled states now, tiny percentage going CDC, state handled testing answers Governors, him, think Governors willing ignore him. Dead Texans: ‚Äúif could go back, would try die COVID 19‚Äù AFAIK US used one. wbush obama worked it. impotus came along decided grift money. 41,407 *confirmed* cases single day. could confirmed cases country entire pandemic single day blaming government placing preventive measures country US whole another level.. False negatives exist well. That‚Äôs really annoying! don‚Äôt Bring grandmothers wheels chairs help skip lines!!! agree. PrOTesTs GoOd!! Yeah would good literal fucking pandemic going on. Mask up! Amazing telegraph get auto warning post like independent articles total garbage. Yeah needs much better Coronavirus sub doesnt censor aspects pandemic know....slow testing down... problem solved! What's avoided aerosol/droplet spread due powerful yelling. Also ""die-ins"" shout circles increase infection rates groups people once. 

So weakening force. people start drop/get sick, slower movement become. spreading deadly virus close contact people, also mixing bodies flora others sweat contact increasing tax body. 

Also, protesting quarantine fixes itself. people protesting get sick, pull make enemy people agree. la China v Hong Kong. 

Not mention POC higher infection risk due certain factors. compile that, get clusterfuck. Ones who's meaning completely overshadowed gigantic surge infections deaths. 

If gathered forces online, made plan, full force protested curve done, men women affected systemic issue, power would 100x forceful. like COVID, people chill fuck out, think rationally minutes, weigh consequences. 

Now end this. Tons people getting sick, forward progress anything, fully taxed brim systems hurting people protesting/trying protect. 

Plague means fight together, THEN, go back fighting other. People learn one way another times places things. consequences thinking logically hurt innocent people over, already has. 

So stupid, people think protesting right smart idea, (spoilers, isn't) might kilter brain chunk comes logic reasoning. 

The police bullshit going anywhere. could waited. Also, really think people everyone's protesting getting huge kick stupidity enjoying chaos? Spoilers again, are. (Get enemies circles, play along gain trust. find people truly think, without someone else's/the media's filter see true grime.)

I go on, think get picture, can't make understand. watch fallout safe distance Radiation suit. Seriously sure boomers would make life, without someone telling think. hell happened coddled generation make dependent? Yes, making huge mistake, though millions citizens also choosing ignore pandemic. I've got essential oils sell cure those!!!! wish could argument deny this. i've already lost several friends thought smart. no, im one making things sound worse actually since know, less 1% america infected. need wear mask ect ect. 


the real argument - much i'll look like doomsday prepper, little lost lung capacity worse, i'll look back wish more. wonder lmao FLApocolypse instead cherry picking stats justify mass gathering pandemic, mass gather? 888 new cases tied fifth one day since start pandemic. state seen high numbers last four days - four top five highest daily new case count.

Well, sucks Bow Grim Reaper then, rednecks Zero deaths....soo faaar Nope nope nope. 100% asymptomatic people mean mild. fairly serious case. anything, stubborn enough get affected maybe die - like natural selection. may actually better everyone keep reminding everyone : there‚Äôs anti-mask sentiment top American government. long Trump doesn‚Äôt least recommend it, half population US wont willingly Ummm casinos? Restaurants? Bars? hard figure out. I'm measuring response relative states. 

The US never going well this. China force measures populace, South Korea HK SARS people willing comply strict mandates.

Personally, think things like contact tracing brainers. technology done much better here. personal freedoms ingrained people's heads, right wrong. get contact tracing. Hell, probably even get herd immunity due vaccines one eventually comes anti vaxx crowd refuses it. Sounds simple! 

...Even novel platforms, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development poses challenges. First, although virus‚Äôs spike protein promising immunogen protection, optimizing antigen design critical ensure optimal immune response. Debate continues best approach ‚Äî example, targeting full-length protein receptor-binding domain.

Second, preclinical experience vaccine candidates SARS Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) raised concerns exacerbating lung disease, either directly result antibody-dependent enhancement. adverse effect may associated type 2 helper T-cell (Th2) response. Hence, testing suitable animal model rigorous safety monitoring clinical trials critical. (It still early define good animal models; rhesus macaques appear quite promising, hamsters ferrets Aren‚Äôt seeing massive spreading places protests. young adults. Sure masks work. everyone wearing mask. know saw eyes. cruise ship, population skewed.

Well good news coronavirus less effective weekends, stay home orders make sense! people go weekend! next day coronavirus goes down!

This everything needs open up! stayed locked months happened? Coronavirus record levels !

Use weekend strategy fight coronavirus. party weekends, coronavirus numbers go down!

/s Yes I‚Äôm arguing bad reporting Danish Swedish press. It‚Äôs like want spread blame it‚Äôs favorite government making mistake. confirm. IVO (Health Social Care Inspectorate) looked found systemic abuse. 

Total lies misinformation. question priorities however major talking point crisis, Sweden's Healthcare Inspectorate currently investigating affected patients' access intensive care Stockholm region, reports many coronavirus patients rejected.

Like nightclubs. (Ok dont stamp forehead normally.) Facebook? Pull funding, better yet, refuse medical treatment anyone refuses take even rudimentary precautions. That's get functioning economy. Lol hasnt trump bump stock 3d printing bans effectively done curb gun ownership well? Well take restaurant example. try find many customers possible, going media ask contact authorities focus trying find potential contacts.
If let's say 10 cases 5 source put emphasis outbreak.

Now got 300 persons showing daily lombardy weeks ago. do? many people. cannot say outbreak. cannot close 30 restaurants go find every customer every restaurant 300 eating last days. call diffuse spread, virus circulating trace isolate closest contacts (family members, coworkers). No? Another dumbass already spikes. going really difficult NY another spike probably 30% population already (20% antibody studies like 2 months ago now) send link percentage? insane...  conveniently leave massive protests started 2 weeks ago. Even theyve wearing masks cant deny share bla.e want shirt! insane, people refuse wear masks flat earthers? I'm doctor, understanding thought issue lungs becoming inefficient generating oxygen levels, would mean intubation makes sense. bigger issue inflammation causing damage lungs, intubation actually exacerbates.

They want following:

1. safe skin/eyes.
2. Kill covid19 viruses/bacteria air/surfaces.
3. cause ozone.

Its already possible air handler thing, want something light bulb costly HVAC system retrofit. know. bet people saying exactly soon. Instead taking known working pandemic mitigation measures watch people know go down, spewing stories herd immunity. what‚Äôs cause? Near Dayton, Ohio. think bigger concern many people die coronavirus, there‚Äôs hospital capacity it‚Äôs overloaded coronavirus care

Car accident brain injury? Sorry pal ventilators available keep alive post surgery

Flu? Sorry bro icu bed care you

Catch heart attack symptoms early enough? Sorry buddy docs nurses overworked COVID-19 wing

Some hyperbole get mean point every mass gathering result superspreader event, superspreader events occur places saturated. mandate mask wearing responsible limitations allow open safely. Texas opened seemingly complete disregard first public safety. It‚Äôs regulatory cultural problem government nothing stop either. 

Here CO initially hit fairly hard we‚Äôve pretty open fine, people wear masks keep places reasonable capacities. ""our rights"" - right endanger lives people, take fucking fly anyway wonder would happened let people stockpile masks shame killing people?  really good Nations need start implementing economic distress plans even await near-mythical vaccine developed warp speed. next coronavirus wave hits, little doubt will, economic havoc follow. Consumers shun newly-opened stores. Office workers quickly return working home, crushing economic activity central business US undeniable recession
. Unemployment remains stubbornly high. Many sustained minimal federal aid going lose benefits soon struggle make ends meet. They‚Äôre going buying new TVs, cars appliances ‚Äì bread butter many lessons ill-conceived recovery efforts, one stands out. Instead channelling taxpayer money corporate welfare schemes

Yes. get this. one tell guys look data opening mouths? first week since April 19th weekly death toll US higher previous week. earth choose week one start saying ""deaths reducing""? knew Wednesday week going higher last.

It's like want choose statements already proved wrong. Even smoking daily going waste anything, know construction workers smoke morning night still accomplish daily bases people. fair mask wearing already part culture. It‚Äôs expected wear mask cold flu. think that‚Äôs great idea.

The culture also rewards conformity. earlier phases put people back work Things think viable people, invested viable"", tell us might viable. common cold coronavirus long joked person could find cure common cold would richest person world. long term effects? genetic consequences? entire generations crippled health wise considered couple options handful egoistic assholes who've ignored human lives decades? matter. major country covid19 problem means do. huge number protestors wear masks outdoors risk infection far lower.

There data shows significant spikes cities biggest protests. protests caused spike, data would readily available.

Instead, data shows spikes Southern states reopened early. Fuck outta that, work outside day Florida, July. problem. Yeah, proven lot cultural political influence lot people see ""common sense"" definitely predictable start this. contrary, though, areas like San Francisco, locked early still plethora restrictions, seem almost invulnerable this. 

Hopefully, learn lot memory loss comes again. lied. People died. probably cholesterol levels key, minority people won‚Äôt tell you, stop trying drag others. collect data covid cases vaxxers vs anti vaxxers. may lead us breakthrough severely impacted disinformation report right? Yup, glad admit screwed mentality is.  definitely large protests Texas Funny anti protest people mention makes sense cases would come millions workers returning thousands protesters  minimizing fact virus could prevented killing thousands thousands people ""most would dead end year."" Except even healthy people catch recover possibly suffer kidney lung damage life. 

By logic everyone dies give shit anything?

Bad faith argument alert. Highly disingenuous. says girl believes god, lmao comment part problem. Telling someone think they're dumb helped understand anything. actually hurtful. care think true. stop listening anything (or someone else) saying right there. also created barrier anyone wants conversation help understand.

This help change. actually continues bring division. Practice understanding.  response. 

The virus naturally select idiots, actually :) 95%?

Fuck oppressors. never even gave thought family. always worried someone far intelligent competent riding high level gov't position wake presidency. Someone who's smart enough use Trump's complete erosion government fullest advantage. That's worries me. We're still lucky he's stupid things he's lot smarter all. 6th grade science projects lot use humans take flown Southwest years. check online get boarding position 24 hours scheduled departure. arrive early physically maintain spot line probably decade now. get enough flights points get preferred flier program get assigned first boarding group automatically. Lol. think understand deep corportism runs veins. gladly sacrifice CEO overlords. Medical patient different state. card year,but I""m glad able get bunch prescription schedule 2 4 drugs would required in-person doctor visit in-person refill pick-up every month. actually feel necessary shared. vaccine comes start hearing causes GBS establishing virus independently causes GBS important well. Maybe didn‚Äôt get rally ""Anti-vaxxer morons"" official title. I'm fortunate enough work home. Even they'll shit Individual efforts good insufficient.

To get levels low enough strategies effective, lockdown ensuring basic needs thing do. However, economic system requires instead make continuous blood sacrifices. think read already creating millions doses waiting approval. Also, several production facilities one Italy recall. white factory workers....... point is? be. embarrassing citizens struggling pay rent pay food country nothing help. idea helping put everyone back work pandemic still going on. Sacrifice worker bees billionaires continue making billions. Embarrassing putting lightly. percent population killed world war 1 way higher percent population killed covid (and likely stay way) 

And also look outside American bubble, WW1 gets rep millions millions non Americans died.

I'm guy replied consider catastrophe. think catastrophe reserved affecting large percentage population, rather thinking numbers. way think though Bar manager here. Georgia 35% occupancy limit, employees must wear masks enforce congregation around bar area. Must enforce 6ft social distancing among groups 6. 3 weeks since reopening shocking see much people aren‚Äôt taking seriously. I‚Äôve dealt people country vacation. Nobody wearing protective facial covering. Lines door waiting come every night. Florida shut everyone hoping shutdown 4th July know pretty much getting Florida invaded. let assholes die too? Correlation causation. TMC bunch different specialized hospitals got childrens , cancer center, women's Pavillion, etc etc like u could pick whichever one want go altho childrens admitting adults time believe ""Do part offset moron"" could campaign slogan. September 2021 we‚Äôre lucky Swedes summer Mediterranean vacation year... Probably. yet USA highest amount Corona deaths world. everyone knows ya'll counting properly.

That's right - we're WAY counting deaths.  
Colorado adjusted deaths 23% said could adjustments Australia Texas population. Australia abit 100 deaths cause went proper lockdown early (southern states stuffed abit tho). Texas bit 2300 dead people, serious lockdown.

No confusing correlation causation. 
The lockdown keep death numbers low compared Texas. 
Texas's numbers artificially HIGH they're allowing people self report numbers go positive cases. fever headache, self report covid19 positive - track presumptive positive. go positive.

So numbers WAY overstated Texas. bad Northeast, specifically New York New Jersey, hit dense here. load metal boxes breathe others' air get anywhere. Public transit main mode getting around. We're also national international hub. Early on, anyone could even get tested, spread silently exponentially. One cough subway train several people infected there's way test, let alone contact trade, etc.

What gets lived actual lessons everyone. Wear damn mask. crowd indoor spaces. smart. spreading like wildfire areas crazy favorable conditions virus have. like nobody learned anything us. He's wrong though. Let honest, might, news cover one know. realize important US dollars Americans tourists Europe

I've read read, really hard statistic buy... corresponds well facts, there's nuance I'm missing, clearly cannot multiply positive cases .0001 come hospitalization numbers. Regardless, need redo calculus... want end result, Houston publishes hospitalizations well active cases, it. 6/24, hospitalizations (1343) 10% active cases (13953). Since April, ratio 7% 20% (the brief 20% April, testing pervasive today, probably longer realistic). active cases go 100,000 pretty clear around 10,000 hospitalized, however getting around ~10 100,000 dilemma guys. 

Houston 27,303 positive cases 6/25, ~10 per 100,000 would 3 hospitalizations, they've announced 1,343, so... guess I'm really sure people quote statistic without explanation face value words clearly rebutted total hospitalizations factor hundreds. ""tecknikully korrect""... well, ok, long turn around use face value. still need use come estimate thousands bed needs reflect reality. That‚Äôs strong counter argument, Johnny Projection.

I agree two fronts.

First, predates ""social media"" decade more, widespread social internet platforms started gaining foothold internet, like AOL Prodigy Compuserve.

Second, least mid-90s, largely ""intellectual space"". much space nerds perverts pirates.

Maybe ""information"" ""intellectualism"" *you* used internet assure universal experience. It‚Äôs culture shift. actually care others vs yourself. Japan wearing masks years years. nothing new them.

Wish true virus. New York extremely far achieving herd immunity. According Johns Hopkins, achieving herd immunity virus would require 70-90% population covid-19 antibodies (Source: [Johns 


On June 16th, Governor Cuomo shared results state-wide random sample antibody test 12,000 New York residents. huge sample size. antibody test done compare results six weeks prior (Comparing 5/1 6/13). antibody test showed approximately 13.4% statewide population Covid-19 antibodies (approximately 1% higher six weeks prior). Obviously, massive variance numbers region region. New York City, highest density Covid cases, showed 21.6% antibody rate. 


The overall fatality rate Covid-19 New York state 7.9%. 8.4 million people living New York state. 70-90% state's population Covid (asymptomatic not), death toll would astronomical, healthcare systems would completely decimated this. safe way achieve herd immunity virus without vaccine. Even then, know yet long immunity would last virus mutates longer protects previously exposed. Yeah, compare. 

Just framers constitution made mistake including ownership particular object right mean incomparable. Anybody wears glasses accustomed fogging sometimes.

Happens wear safety goggles too, walk warm building winter, sometimes exercise. major inconvenience common occurrence, excuse.  Fox News, President, Meal Team Six, Branch Dildonians, Religious ""Leaders"", Anti Vax, Americans use critical thinking live echo chamber. pneumonias hospitalized several days. Nasty shit. likely high risk it. -America leaves chat- herd Gradual increase. way, we've bent curve successfully...  still hit peak seems. 

Which makes sense. We're county 10 million. stop making politics! didn‚Äôt respond little pussy boy? sir, need long, deserved wake call:

Fact: 11 Coroners &amp; Medical Examiners Arizona, serving population 6,809,946 people area 113,563 square miles. 1 Coroner &amp; Medical Examiner per 619,086 people, 1 Coroner &amp; Medical Examiner per 10,323 square miles.The state Arizona ranked 45th Coroners &amp; Medical Examiners per capita, 48th Coroners &amp; Medical Examiners per square mile. 

Fact: AZ uses cdc guidelines, means AZ reports certified death certificate received AZDHS staying person died COVID. facts hat Unfortunately US macho mentality. think told controlled government something. That's many people still thinking disease fake. reminds truth ""viral load"". Back months ago known. amount virus get changes severity response it. Yet, one said anything. think asymptomatic permanent physical damage ever going brought up. government media sort collusion saying ""masks protect wearer"".

People never know acting quarantine right now. non-essential outings, masks required outings. quarantine whether know not. feel everyone realize playing russian roulette lives.

Every person media, including people like Chris Cuomo, got covid b/c take seriously enough. preventable yet see Sanjay Gupta stupidlly showing people bring ""go bag"" masks cross-country road trip keep safe. idiots! road trips. Sorry that's truth. lockdown even one admit it. playing life. **Act lockdown**.

When over, end maybe year mostly, hell pay years come. implore people listen crowd, top experts, Fauci noble lies. top experts saying thing months. lockdown wearing mask go outside. Period. Anything else pure madness. covid preventable. That's fair. one new case Korea went bars (with temperature sore throat, champion) numbers around 50 new infections per day. come MN, state protests originated saw longest sustained amount protests weeks, saw increase cases? Look states opened early states protests. states opened early seeing spikes, states protests seeing spikes. mean protests impact spread COVID? No, mean protests main driving factor spread COVID. driving spread spikes people meeting indoors, either restaurants, bars, clubs, other's homes.

Look nyc! Biggest city country massive protests well. Protests days. Look pictures - huge crowds people, outside, marching masks. many weeks ago. still spike. Every state suffering right one thing common: opened quickly. used go libaries time, used enjoy getting books. going inside one, treatment vaccine, many vectors like fountians, doorknobs, books kid sneezing might touched, libary safe anymore. May want check Amazon Fresh option area concerned. legitimately gone grocery store since February Fresh. yesterd....oh wait Well time government telling do, lost ability yourself. believe everyone wear mask, especially looking numbers right now. think many recent protests hurt spikes, well gathering, including rallies. 

 u/sobiebird attempted answer original question. would add act forcing people wear masks correct, however course take away freedom choose yourself. yes, freedom taken away, arguably right reason. get concerned rights? think scary time people realize America little different many say European countries, want preserve makes us unique. That's logic. 

The question is, government force wear mask risk penalty? mean think people would wear one. However people also trust government longer, believe say something makes sense. tough, people think right individual freedom outweighs thing. would hope everyone chooses wear mask even forced. That's real debate. say anything progressive idiots? didnt. 

But arent hypocrites views least consistent. EU finalizes plans restrict foreign travelers, heard travel EU US? know sounds crazy, know someone vacation plans States wonder Italy even let go (or come back does). So, saying is, Constitution bit outdated, updated reflect modern times. Also, sort gun permits talking about? Heller pretty focused keeping arms home. familiar needing permit keep firearms house. I've predicting seven figure death toll along. average American far stupid anything less. then? 

I understand mean positives however. need abandon idea returning ‚Äúnormal‚Äù instead focus adapting evolving present. mean, stupidity cures itself. require three masks standard one? *$&amp;^ time... Lol yeah, friends saying Japanese government awful. Completely focused economy lying numbers. wanna talk countries right, South Korea Taiwan winners.  far tell millennials means ‚Äúthe people blame problems represent composite different things find scary different‚Äù say sir made day. Best comment ive seen sub lol never even got first one... basis? nation second-highest number coronavirus cases deaths, reached deal U.K. produce Covid-19 vaccine that‚Äôs developed Oxford University [AstraZeneca  spend $287 million buy vaccine doses ingredients many 100 million shots able produce locally technology transfer, [Health Executive Secretary Elcio Franco said press conference Brasilia today.  first order, regardless final results vaccine clinical trials, cost Brazil $127 million, Franco said. include 30.4 million doses delivered December January, well technology transfer. It‚Äôs also pretty normal thing COVID helped ton. shouldn‚Äôt underplay that. Sane Texans voting minority. Yeah, pretty low, I've seen 50-70% make ventilator. 

Depends age, underlying conditions, etc. Hang there. Everyone different.

Sending thoughts &amp; prayers. let us hit damn iceberg already, I‚Äôm it. wildly permanent symptom reports I've seen. shit, Sherlock.

Indoors people = death. lot control virus exposure car accident Earlier pandemic study completed using antibodies wide range people Santa Clara County, CA. Using representative sampling range potentially positive cases, death rate close low end range listed. nearly three months later death rate mirrors range listed. 

With people tested positive cases death rate continue declining. Every death tragic, minimizing single death. people isolating months, years. history repeats probably see lot deaths US next weeks.

Restaurants 50% capacity. 
Counties allowed require businesses require masks customers, requirement state stories much outliers. virus 99.5% survival rate. Humanity better chimpanzees probably mean becoming antisocial self-centered, though. think means need build cohesive, global ""tribe"", maximally optimize cooperation. Everyone, even/especially leaders, HAPPY sacrifice greater good tribe. think Trump moved convention Jacksonville.  imagine optics Florida locked Trump holds huge convention mask social distancing, despite local regulations? Living south Florida seeing numbers, know anyone has/had anyone know know anyone has/had it.. numbers high should.. Honestly.. Hey, thanks downvotes!

The media political agenda. money agenda. honestly believe news media day age anything Howard Stern formula smattering facts paying attention.

This argument is: saying protesting murdered people paid protect important covid, covid important people bored. oh, side note, blm protests primary cause upswing currently seeing, small part evidence support position.

Then taking small piece argument, paraphrasing poorly, arguing made said branching knows where.

Good luck fellowship. Sending positive vibes hoping redeployment you. Early re-opening.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* long hospitalizations remain manageable, ""spikes coronavirus"" good thing. problem, I've thinking clip lot lately. Masks pussies - Joe Rogan time. sick entitled mask deniers. Whining ""personal freedoms."" Shut wear mask! Stop self-centered child, something fellow human. We've become entitled survival, sad see. Common sense doesn‚Äôt fit agreed upon narrative push though. understand even politicised. Wearing mask shopping minor inconvenience, save lives Slovenia here, back obligatory masks public places following rising numbers cases last 2 weeks. Things didnt go bad, still lower March seems government wants prevent buildup momentum time around. fully precautions, fuck rona. burning cop cars looting stores? already difficult enough finding Lysol/Clorox/disinfectants take away conversation:

‚ÄúYour views may incongruent cultural expectations‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck you. don‚Äôt listen you!‚Äù Good point. comparison, annually America, 38,000 die car accidents, least past years looked up. places protests occurred see spikes, places contact tracing finding large indoor gatherings problem, protests.

[Parties ‚Äî Protests ‚Äî Causing Spikes one event spread 29 people 31 related employers,"" Lautenbach says.

""And secondary source infection workplace settings. 31 related employers associated one party number people brought workplace. us, community size, that's pretty massive spread.""


[COVID-19 surged cities big protests, states reopened early. possible Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, cities across country have¬†not¬†seen sharp, sustained spikes expected hundreds thousands people gathered protests police brutality. Daily demonstrations, capped riots, began week George Floyd killed Minneapolis police May 25. maximum incubation period COVID-19 ‚Äî time getting infected showing symptoms ‚Äî believed two weeks, fallout clear now. serving Corona. know mean. There's two sides coin. Even leaders step up, people obey &amp; know damn well that's easy here, i.e. Michigan morons protesting Governor Whitmer.  Many European Asian countries reopened without massive surges. Mask, social distancing, testing, tracing. gets deleted, upvote Gods image huh ? Well that‚Äôs case. give shitty eyes lol I'm this. People deserve suffer natural consequences actions.

It's teach toddler, America teach him. Well Minnesota made testing stations specifically protesters barely found cases.

""As late last week, 4,487 tests conducted across four testing sites specifically protesters resulted 62 positive cases COVID-19, positivity rate 1.4%, department said.""

""Another health system Minnesota, HealthPartners, tested 8,500 protesters several clinics positivity rate 0.99%, Doug Schultz, public information officer Minnesota Department Health, told MedPage Today last 

It's proven fact protests causing surges. example, talking New York, even increase daily cases protests.

In fact, compare two weeks ago, slight drop.

26th June: 933 new cases.

12th June: 1050 meh, cant anywise. charged OWI never convicted. Banned entering pay Canada money apply criminal rehabilitation status. pissed anything. Thanks laugh. know I‚Äôll get pilloried, two studies backing wearing homemade masks are: 1) based analysis droplet dispersal, growing evidence COVID spread aerosol droplets. Flu measles also aerosol spread. Droplets much larger easily blocked. 2) second study based surgical masks said apply aerosol droplet spread. 

There evidence homemade masks, people told use, anything. Wear n95 mask really want accomplish something. told to. It‚Äôs way virus spreads droplets. exhale, fill air small droplets. air, liquid quickly evaporates droplets become much smaller tiny particles - thus able float longer penetrate finer woven barriers.

Even homemade cloth mask filters bit - creates humid environment around nose mouth. keeps droplets larger longer lets mask catch them.

No mask - people exhale grapes turn poppy seeds go mask. mask catches all. wear mask - grapes exhale stay grapes longer mask catches turn poppy seeds get mask infect people. huge protests literally everywhere Agree points except shit pay, middle class professional pay actually outstanding, outweigh lot negatives (for now). I‚Äôve multiple opportunities move abroad they‚Äôve always come around 40% pay cut least. Unless get expensive illness, actually net gain US even paying ass medical insurance/care Well, least admitted wrong. Something people trouble doing. reason Kushner told good idea, beyond brain capable thinking. could want make easy money thousands people wearing obnoxious MAGA masks? virus care people want. irrelevant. Humans control. virus mean, could well fear mongering, but, honestly? think country can't get right time. Well help Trump saying stuff matter fact, scientists live work uncertainty. People like uncertain like knowing. Trump saying something explicit, matter dumb, feels easier people. I‚Äôm sitting looks like you‚Äôre troll one produce stayed hasn‚Äôt produced anything meaningless words Internet forum hum looks credible Previous peak dominated one state - New York. one looks dominated Florida. deaths wont though. flu season. far, contact tracing pointed large social gatherings people wearing masks (parties, bar hopping) spreading events. finding many cases associated protests, point masks contributing factor. course, lag associated finding/tracing new cases, results line research mask use. abundance observational data pointing efficacy mask usage preventing spread SARS-CoV-2, NPR put article topic specifically:
 many asymptomatic? also seeing reports milder cases less hospitalization needed, actual Doctors. maybe it‚Äôs following normal path viral pandemic weakening herd immunity grows latter, course. ‚ÄúIf could go back... would xyz different.‚Äù Yeah, guess lives weren‚Äôt stake regardless. Fuck Trump, never gotten far Hold desi movie Idiocracy explains phenomenon perfectly! Thank go self righteous jerkoffs ‚ÄúMe‚Äù generation.  even bothered reply directly?

That's fine. I'll put effort reply directlt Country‚Äôs world reporting deaths different don‚Äôt think country going able avoid outbreaks.

Just two sentences tell actually read anything all.

The link provided includes detailed information deaths.

No one said outbreaks (do even know total number positive cases are? certainly number indicates were/are outbreaks), neither anyone says absolutely another either. actually properly read comprehend replies posts?

We *are* still cautious; we're also *still* getting daily SMS reminding us cautious (today's specifically reminding us proper way wear mask); *are* technically still 'lockdown', much relaxed one aim recovery proper SoP applied, is, way, detailed one links post's title (which claimed read).

The fact stats listed title current status CoViD-19 reported here.

And can't answer fellow Malaysians, personally, consider attack country, us citizens frontliners. said 'questioning' numbers, *actually* throwing accusations.

'Questioning' would requesting data sources readings available know, actually reading provided.

'Questioning' would requesting opinions us *citizens actually living here*. *""Are numbers reliable?"" ""Does hold all* (that'd us) *see daily life?""* Unless think we're liars? perhaps, uneducated make accurate judgement current situation country?

'Questioning' would discussion us. nope, try, shut us change subject, bringing unrelated matters like also questioning numbers countries elsewhere (Sure? We're discussing current situation Malaysia's CoViD-19 here.) nope, provide sound rebuttal, even reply directly us.

'Questioning' **NOT** coming posts running narratives making baseless accusation like, it? low number daily new cases us 'saving face'???

P.S.: total number deaths first quarter 2020 out, that'd (specifically end March throughout April) hit hard pandemic. guns 'Operator' cos players... Victoria Australia, 33 new cases night state reintroduced tighter public restrictions again. one complains, people extra cautious again. I'm thinking, wow that's lot new cases, I'm worried go out. read report cannot even fathom numbers U.S. insane. people government want open like nothing's going on. Death resurrection literally relieve blood body Jesus Christ shared meal.

Not sure anyone‚Äôs arguing point. It‚Äôs literally obvious. Yes wait two weeks. age group. hits nursing homes retirement communities younger people interact see happens. Plus couple weeks ICU die. Go nice couple week ICU vacation let us know fun is. fuck talking blaming entire country stupid sensationalist headlines? don‚Äôt step back computer bit. People seem think Gates unbiased genius look engaged in: vaccines certified implants, NPR, mosquitos, de-population earth. tainted, politicized perspective. Whenever new virus pops he's going pink sweater telling us cease livelihoods get vaccines NPR taking grants tell us whatever asks. Sorry Bill, can't founder Microsoft. us need jobs. Unemployment insurance fills gap. really make sense Im still working Id rather government take loan give money. understanding unemployment system became bit clusterfuck. dashboard (this type)?
 aware dashboard cars. get fucking deserve. ones voted Abbott TV/Radio guy Danny Goeb idiots walking around mask, drinking bars eating crowded restaurants hours. Anyone know didn‚Äôt vote hunkered down, taking risks possible. Really, I'm hoping us get second time- but, knowing country, they'll get right 1,000,000,026th time. Anybody else originally read 'Sinister testicles' ? ""In hindsight, stupid motherfucker"" fact people need convinced big group gatherings cause surge infection rate one main reasons country fucking failed. 

Idiots mean, yes, really important, even people dying, even asymptomatic, seems least chance long-term negative effects throughout body, really increase cases means there's people deal damage sickness long time, possibly rest lives. That's still good either. Many people nursing homes still died even though stayed home. sayin'. Also, last checked, people still needed groceries. Don‚Äôt schools open early September? College thing starts August? Still months away. would say 4th July celebrations exacerbate issue weeks afterwards states hammered right now. Truly sad. Hey, married one those! husband proclaims going away right election, made h**x #3#0cr#ts. Seriously. live with. Honestly think says often knows pisses off...but still.

Original post removed douchebag autobot...reposting post political...am merely stating husband's misguided views. think one thing learned people bars don‚Äôt always follow corona guidelines Please wash hands esp using bathroom home. still introduce harmful bacteria yourself, like eyes... get pink eye. ones vaccine case sniffles whereas ones without full blown covid, IIRC. it, things finally calm down, super huge first anniversary bash! I've noticed things, others. 

But basically buy perishable type items might why. Yes, much saved retirement payments? Finland -1 death one day types corrections. Happens reasonably frequently. 

Most commonly tied changing direct reporting excess deaths really dont want hear shit left anymore 

They decided take month worrying covid packed streets every decent sized city. travelled fuxking feel warm fuzzy protesting

We couldnt work, couldnt shit like go beach sudden decided 10,000 person groups fine.

What joke 3000 dead vs 2000 dead day still 2/3rds 9/11 every day. still grizzly bear even 8 feet tall 9. Woof woof, bottom graph. first thing shows one Googles ""Corona virus deaths per day United makes think need wait till Christmas? saw morning. found coworker wedding w/ 100 people work day want get together like one loud ass kid ruins early recess time everyone shenanigans... But, muh constitooshuns!  books can't cooked easily.

You would cook books deaths either changing numbers earlier years (which already published) report completely false number total deaths year. Given work is... difficult, without getting caught. also recorded many levels single ethical voice would muck up.

The numbers specific COVID deaths cooked directions - hospitals might translate everything COVID, places pneumonia spikes randomly. Excess deaths real number be. know many people expect die confidence level. 

As deaths low now. Well, lag super hard. Rhode Island tons deaths recently whole relatively infections. spike deaths seems 3-4 week lag. Also genuinely positive news, seem gotten better keeping people severe cases alive. People like reason COVID come back bigger before. ashamed yourself. No, selfish moron, lot people stay home. repeat it. completely control again, already. That's happens wait long take half measures instead full measures.  half America: nah we're good, breath kills problem, tell stop overrating others suffering, cares

the thing course always sociopaths like that, thanks years top lack leadership endless demonstration okay whatever want without repercussions, became mainstream attitude we're essentially doomed, almost impossible undo price massive Apparently lives matter comes stupid.  Don‚Äôt stupid. easily throw together 3-4 reasonable assumptions leads outdoor masks wearing causing excess deaths. They‚Äôll vote somebody worse. Lots dumb evangelicals live here. I'm sure they're thing. want remove apparatus government - red tape, regulation, bureaucracy, taxes. they're afraid global ""conspiracy"" destroy WASP cultural hegemony Sure US already prepaid 300M doses. Remember people thought coronavirus government could replace batteries birds? Oh simple days. Hey, automoderator. political here. stating ridiculous stance husband takes, happened mention political affiliation. make masks fabric. medical PPE still goes doctors nurses. fucking simple. deaths lockdown causing outpacing covid deaths.

source? Guys come here. AC dont put ice water.  Go look up, they‚Äôre seeing lot reinfection, they‚Äôre shut lot recently reopened. They‚Äôre restricting travel even within China again, doesn‚Äôt make sense travel whole country protesters wore masks practiced social distancing. 

Keep spreading lie 1000 pictures disproving social distancing. still surge capacity. get auto.wreck.etc. plus saying beds covid means everything great? everything mostly lone things happen way would.it anywhere near 100% covid. Think hospital beds 35-65% full auto wrecks? DATA!!!

It RIGHT FRONT YOU!!!

You chose ignore it.

Not responsible deaths lot people, responsible wrecked lives (lungs, organs, etc.) thousands people...you're godd\*mn fool, village idiot corner.

But George Carlin said, maybe politicians suck...maybe something else. Brazil south hemisphere, winter there. virus seems loose power heat, yet US problems California, Texas Florida...  politician‚Äôs job tell us want hear. scientist‚Äôs job tell us don‚Äôt necessarily want hear. better question really hell politicians? anti vax part alone, anti vax PLUS threat sue piece money. feels like much. I‚Äôve taking note expiry dates products Ive getting via grocery pickups (comparing brand/flavor/size store). I‚Äôve noticed items got 6 weeks ago longer expiration date item got days ago. 

This makes wonder panic-buys overall increased demand past 3-4 months essentially done ‚Äúspring clean‚Äù among distribution warehouses, they‚Äôre sending anything they‚Äôve got companies struggle keep restock. Statistically nothing bro. people cry every time American heart attack? Let's ban sugar force people died tople obesity epidemic America facing. Would also help rona would've guessed, fat kinda damages immune system makes die diseases mild healthy people. care much feelings? 

I dont care feelings, thats asked source.
But glad see admit feelings rooted credible data seen videos people protesting rioting BLM? 

I have. I've seen many people wearing masks, outside, open air. happened social distancing?

Ask many states reopened people packed enclosed spaces masks. think part play massive spike? undeniable, problem showing proof. need tell cells social distance. Wow really need stop blaming car accident deaths covid! accessible testing course case numbers rise quicker people agreeing science long this. avoid WMT, historic reasons, WMT shoppers collectively higher risk.

I also finish grocery run within 15min. Thats max exposure time willing allow places. simply could asked europe, apres ski bar alps major afterburner march spreading corona Italy Austria rest europe. Bars extremely toxic people close longer period times, air ventilation spreads drops hosting virus normally people sing, increases drops air significantly. Awe! Thanks proud me! kinda wanna, ya know, survive... lols Yeah. remember listening news hearing seemed similar Spanish Flu. Also, seeing hard China cracked down, seemed insane people take seriously. I'm fairly certain US last get hold this. appropriate punishment stupidity. see graphs new positive tests (1st graph), hospitalizations (2nd graph), deaths (3rd graph) deaths sex age (4th graph).

&amp;nbsp;

For first three graphs deselect 'tot en met gisteren' see new data person tested positive/ hospitalized/ died.

&amp;nbsp;

As today 54 (-4) (updated 27-06 13:59) patients ICU. patients confirmed suspected Covid-19. total 2926 Covid-19 patients ICU since pandemic began. [Source lastly, Covid-19 dashboard published state collects important data one place. [find Yes, needs met. medical needs supersede child‚Äôs need education. So, perform job others yes, might need step away it. like anyone else unable perform primary work function.

Also, I‚Äôm teacher, work education. Specifically, distance education. know done well, also know isn‚Äôt even remotely appropriate elementary-aged children. son won‚Äôt engage via zoom anymore neither classmates. It‚Äôs solution.

I get it‚Äôs preferred solution, thankfully leaders state recognize vital importance children returning classroom fall actively working toward making happen safely. even try huge disservice kids.

We‚Äôre obviously going agree, wish best.

Wow lol Np  protests defiantly led spike cases states, 5 states getting record high case numbers like Florida Georgia, reopening little quickly. pack 50,000 people beach pandemic, people gonna catch corona. believe should‚Äôve started reopening, fast. Yep. I‚Äôm bartender seeing alcohol makes people act sad. People sit judge staying Friday night off.

If government required close also onus provide financial relief regardless previously lobbied healthy balance sheet. It‚Äôs pay taxes first place... protection peril. choosing willfully stupid fact finding own. victims. Thanks republican congressmen Trump told everyone take freedom back one make wear mask Hard find ignition source fire shit burning around tshirts everyone ""Rural density linked lower coronavirus infection rates"" fact different story

Also find metropolitan population one significant predictors infection rates; larger metropolitan areas higher infection higher mortality rates.

So density factor total population know worst-case scenario reports long would dealing virus?

It's though significant portion population read reports said ""Wow, seems really bad scary.  make happen?""  get thought behind lowering capacity, again, make much difference 100 vs 150 people plane? Reopening soon large group people anti science R wearing masks. supposed whatever notion ""decreasing severity"" might semantics, case.

And still think point focus number cases. think incredibly poorly worded piece. Ultimately, what's he's *seems* trying point comparing first 100,000 positives NY first 100,000 positives TX fair first looked hospitalized positives, latter take everyone consideration. gives rationale we'd deliberately choose work less complete data set. order understand normal limits illness, need close census sick possible. really strange. 

And, yeah, pointing big thing: numbers rise vacuum. need hospitalized surge TX *just sick* getting hospitalized surge NY. bizarro he'd write that? God fuckwit Florida man here, treasure coast, it‚Äôs incredible things unfolding really. mid March middle May, anywhere public would see soul wearing mask. typical pandemic, everywhere ghost town, major retailers open stores almost totally empty.

Now life usual, EVERYWHERE packed brim, people still wear masks given strange looks got whole thing took off, everyone seems completely forgotten virus exists. 

I think likely media moved ‚Äúbetter stories cover‚Äù people religiously follow news figured low popularity covering virus, must mean virus isn‚Äôt important anymore. don‚Äôt mean get political, chosen write virus unimportant quite literally ‚ÄúNo Lives Matter‚Äù movement, really worried right now. Antifa labeled terrorist organization now, millions WILLINGLY spreading plague?

People chosen decide either virus isn‚Äôt real, isn‚Äôt worth putting lives hold anymore. government failed us, refusing continue force people stay home. Dark times ahead think. history books tell absent minded many people this. USA country. Europe continent countries working together. States negotiating countries international stage. done country behalf states. social, economic, even basic infrastructure-based reasons this. elections every four years I‚Äôm sure could attribute nearest one fit delusions. That‚Äôs terrific comment someone using burner account (4 days old). correct. helps protect significantly statistically better wearing mask.

Keep mind eyes also vector. Wear goggles enclosed space. Protesting pandemic go wrong? Sorry situation. hope stay safe. Give credit states too, proactively. States like Queensland instance extremely proactive early on. Also remember government calling pandemic did.

From person, within 4 months, spread 140 countries, every corner planet, become number one cause death almost countries. lot people know want get tested wait time. Several places incentives come work everyday, low paying factory workers want extra money. would want wait several days miss bonus? 

It's rough situation. Increasing testing also means making people admit real. lot new cases younger people. young people get death rate decrease. It‚Äôs still killing old people massively higher rate Mm hmm. people packed churches Easter Mother's Day despite shutdown orders? people packed public pools beaches Memorial Day? house parties birthday parties graduation parties bachelorette parties despite shutdown orders? know country living in, huge swaths people US thumbed noses shutdowns, masks, social distancing Day One.  lying partisan reasons. Protests definitely made worse. That's serious people even know it. Damn im 3rd fathers feel like barely missed good opportunity different life regards pandemic, imagine feel, condolences. El Dorado great shape right now, let's keep way. aunt dick she‚Äôd uncle, doesn‚Äôt, doesn‚Äôt matter. Fuck ‚Äúif‚Äôs‚Äù, governor. That‚Äôs said. panic bought like 2 ounces. think I‚Äôm currently sitting 4.5 ounces since March 11th. top bong eroding cause hit much. I‚Äôm really trying brag much weed smoke. it‚Äôs really cool see accomplish nothing smoke weed. one job cares, masks, visitors coming in, hanging socializing, throwing parties. doctor going happy weight loss, he‚Äôs big live healthy, don‚Äôt want pills kind guy. yeah don‚Äôt need 6 lbs. highest increases coming places like Florida, South Carolina, Texas Georgia. Looks like hate might help spread virus. I'm *World War Z* flashbacks. People cherry pick stats reasons. accident. Yeah. know. That‚Äôs weren‚Äôt bars you. attitude!

But seriously, comes out, needs unprecedented PSA effort literally everywhere society try persuade everyone get damn vaccination. Unfortunately, strongest levers power held idiots, probably happen. Assuming great efficacy, wonder percentage people would need vaccine stop spread? Really? Seems like would make lungs stronger, way training altitude does. Six! Six! Six! Number Beast! Yes old people stay home scared. cant cite small number cases kids died covid claim overall statistics somehow wrong. outliers. odd see ppl refuse learn mistakes others. cant go back, leave office endorse someone competent enough idk... listen doctors scientists want children become. Somehow dont think happen. Dont even think they're remorseful. want stand ground pick fight? strange hill literally die Lol every developed nation plant managed get thing control, deserve shat right comes history rewrite. Haha, nope.

We're worried heat wave now. won‚Äôt believe one weird trick States use stockpile Coronavirus! Doctors *hate* it!‚Äù Except actually, Yknow, read, you‚Äôd see study came showing difference infection rate densely populated urban areas rural areas.

The difference barely anyone travels rural areas - virus spreads, carry around breath people.

Now cases, positive rates, hospitalizations going rural areas - say rural areas meaning lower population cities. Next smaller towns that, again, barely anyone travels (not comparison big tourist drawing areas). takes time virus gain foothold people blindly grasp slow start ‚Äúit‚Äôll fine‚Äù....exactly like Trump said like 15 cases it‚Äôs going 0 soon. number people can‚Äôt understand exponential growth....

There evidence show won‚Äôt continue spread exactly literally worldwide. Fuck right off. think lot. Like main problems cause problems road right front us. Declining education, declining social support services, rising income inequality, rising education costs, rising healthcare costs, lower environmental standards, etc. Would expect system like trajectory better future? people can't take jork. cult leader told necessary.

Let's clear here. main reason ""conservative"" resistance wearing masks president United States. Sure, certain existing respiratory conditions, obstruction contribute hypoxia hypoxemia . people don‚Äôt anything severe. husband wears mask, required hospital, 10 hours day. I‚Äôve worn surgical mask six hours surgery. Anti-mask people act like masks general hazard. majority people, including pre-existing conditions like asthma (with exceptions). fragile respiratory systems take *extra* precautions pandemic since much higher risk complications get covid. can‚Äôt wear mask get coffee weak pulmonary functions, shouldn‚Äôt getting coffee (speaking Karens there). Anti-mask people taking rare exception extrapolating onto general population. Oh come man! say that! said save lives something everyone's going exact opposite.

I already see headline ""Florida couple throws sneezing party entire neighborhood told could save lives"" US .. sure. typically waste 1/3 food, Americans, including me, eat. eat fun, survive.

So lot slack buffers food system. earlier shortage supply chain issues. Farmers actually slaughter chickens what-not cannot sell them. 

So sure .. point people may complain items may getting expensive. enough food feed America? highly doubt happen anytime soon.

Africa .. totally different story. necessarily true. Bombs precise drop lot What? There's DNA Covid-19.  people sub... get certain states popping right frustrating. NY crazy first early on, turned around. states weren‚Äôt bad NY early on, eased little faster. isn‚Äôt crazy see things spiked based that, people got comfortable tried get back normal. awful people right? nerve. Nobody lived something like before.  never expected America would handle perfectly. Let‚Äôs hope states spiking turn around soon, not, freak outs hype up. Everyone getting pissy doesn‚Äôt help think. Texas Florida responding, shutting bars, let‚Äôs see happens. Haha unless super skinny pounds won‚Äôt missed. ‚Äúoffice‚Äù 30 minutes day mandatory mask rule literally one following including safety manager made rule first place. Major facepalm. Yeah, that's I'm at. read /u/IvaGrey saying, ""I can't imagine scary must fore everyone US right now"". first thought was, ""Not scary?"".

And I'm Florida. Miami, still. news extra precautions place, know anything happening. know anyone that's gotten sick. one know knows anyone gotten sick. wear mask social distance, hard feel much fear seen effects directly. Stop spreading lies, cant find single news source confirm bs money business,

Pretty obvious ok. point average salary nba 7.7 million. They‚Äôll okay lol

The houses live valued high millions multi million. cars drive close million (multiples) clothes wear (pricey) chefs pay maids pay Gardner pay. 

Just stop working mean bills stop coming pimp remember that.  sarcoidosis? granulomas! I'm proud Maryland Governor Hogan far.

I also confirm area MD, Trump country BTW, I've seen 100% indoor mask compliance since mess began None Trump's fault? I'd say he's killed lot people letting infection spread making people ""get back work.""

Not mention moron gatherings. protests. Nobody mentions those. I'm wondering make 35 job amount brain power.

I feel like someone supporting her. Otherwise would crawling around gutter somewhere making rat circus something. Trump: ‚ÄúSo let 33,000 people die, re-elected November. Ok, cool.‚Äù Lol think protests main catalyst resurgence cases yeehaws rushing back bars dining areas reopen refusing wear masks even acknowledge existence virus you‚Äôre insane. can‚Äôt downplay virus act like matters fits narrative. really couple paragraphs long, even enough space go great detail. response comment, went ahead read whole thing, disagree saying. give actual rationale. difference patient appearance due already addressed.

Also, fun fact, there's option secondary intubation many patients. getting intubated, almost across board methods getting high enough oxygen saturation. totally put southern secession back table. Stupid people elect stupid people. nearly cities protests, seeing increases. course cause, post alluded to. apparently matter. Like said, deserve this. Definitely needs ""Good News"" flair. Oh boy wait conspiracy theorists data better science point view, sure lot people asymptomatic.. 100% spread someone may weather disease well.

The federal response fucked US, turning back now. need real data scientists doctors know exactly dealing with, optics damned.. it‚Äôs right thing do. think already started shaming making people care masks dig further. get anger frustration mask crowd think time move on. Human psychology hard wiring unfortunately support whole shaming tactic. Cuomo's preso zip codes large swaths Brooklyn Bronx 40-50%. NYC watched Cuomo every single freaking day. Please stop lying, basically saying Cuomo lying I'm repeating daily presentations showed. Wait mean rioting thousands people pandemic bad idea. Cool? Good going.

Stay safe. Death counts COVID lag 4 6 weeks. 

A physician sign death certificate. work 12+ hour days weeks strait, signing top priority.

Then cases adjudicated gov officials included counts. Specific training annual requirements cannot done remotely must done specific places. Additionally, must travel air work site. left life 200% better bruh, drop shit goooooo

It's poison.  think large percentage people wearing masks, group Reddit likes point (and rightfully so) lots thinking harmful. 

But least also large percentage younger people don‚Äôt wear them. think largest increase cases construction workers here, whenever seen construction sites, mask usage questionable best. think need better leadership coronavirus measures check. I'm going complain free money though. Atlanta area

Hence comment Decatur. need google, staying hotel rooms multiple cities weeks, thanks. seen www.despair-dot-com? Good laugh! uncle vacation rentals phone ringing nonstop. Well without individualism wouldn‚Äôt country right now.

I didn‚Äôt say individualism always beneficial. pluses minuses. People wearing masks minus. saw virus January, realized fucked US going be. wouldn‚Äôt able things necessary immediately curb population wouldn‚Äôt allow it.

Some states getting hit hardest right even publish covid hospitalization data (like Florida). I'm confused people years claiming ""pro-life"" saying human life sacred preserved costs. fine government force woman give birth order protect human life wearing mask months order protect human life ""bowing government""? work??? Oof! Florida continues see record-high spikes new COVID-19 cases state, Saturday health department reported another 9,585 newly-confirmed cases.¬†

That number highest single-day jump new coronavirus cases Florida since tracking began March, breaking Friday's previous record 8,942 new cases, according data Department Health.

For context, **record-breaking 78,345 tests** also done within last day. state says **12.82 percent tests positive**. One thing, NYC many cases testing March 21 10,000. Florida testing 50,000.

Therefore could estimate NYC may 17,500 cases point time. Florida half way there. They‚Äôve also banned use umbrellas lime wedges non-alcoholic drinks. messing around time. hope phone rings tell virus, think something better say ""I fucking told would happen""

Why? sounds perfect.

You're going able tell they're dead. tell they're alive conscious. mostly see Boomers Zoomers without masked, see X'er Millennials without them... is, picking choosing idiots, talking about? old people dying because, well, they‚Äôre old time almost anyways, virus killing vapers, smokers fat fucks chose ignore bodies health vitality long. instead people wearing stupid masks focus everyone‚Äôs overall health well true, coronavirus also attacks every part body, including brain, minor issues loss smell headaches indicative another, smaller, subset patients may experiencing extreme issues.

True. like Ebola, people drop dead one two days, takes longer kill, sometimes weeks, sometimes even months. Several things.

1) outside.
2) vast majority wearing masks

3) article exactly say protests spread virus, net outcome showed increase due people avoiding areas protests staying home instead. unclear protestors increased spread not.

In case, know several things:

1) Inside bad. There's actually correlation places really hot high infection rates because, theoretically, people staying inside, home stores, air conditioning.

2) Wearing mask dramatically reduced spread.

3) social distancing works.

The abide three rules less chance spreading virus. Protesting obviously safe activity observing 3, seem caused spike. Hopefully qualify one time. I'd like free money too...... real gripe Scrubs.

Spent two months Japan teaching kindergarten online March April. pretty weird. believe Newsom CA said increase likely attributed part. There‚Äôs way rule out. NC? rebutted argument. Australia says hi too! Wow, way show ignorance. nutshell US fucked.  know said deaths may still start rising. However many places cases rise last month, deaths still declining. Texas counts confirmed positives months ago. leaders failed us. Really shows far US fallen.  US based. 45k America...45 fucking K. much better this, stop downplaying ignoring thing. means horrid things hospitality mortality rates road, weren‚Äôt already bad enough. 

I‚Äôm sick this...I‚Äôm sick mean, reason blatantly obvious: **USA using effective enough strategies fight virus.** really simple.

It even matter can't won't. ready-made, proven concepts countries used squash virus. USA could incorporate strategies wanted.

So remaining question is, USA want fight virus properly first place. current actions show answer ""no"". However, dangerous game play. road taken far, might lead kind actual big catastrophe. Uhhhhhhh, ya think? still take flu vaccine every year. Especially years ago, one get vaccine family got flu bed bound nearly week point almost going hospital. got mild flu one well enough take care everyone. 

So I'd happily take even partially effective covid vaccine. also 2500 deaths, close highest ever day (and significantly worse day March, although feel like maybe months confused really mean April). gov app authenticates them. example get code know confirm code them. Agreed. Agree consistent include people crowding together streets protests. Especially virus disproportionately affects people protesting.

Given fragile healthcare system India, become tough governments (central +state) contain damage cases contained quickly.

Unfortunately, going cost lives permanent harm lot people get there. cause increase, would seen states protests registering increases states increase right states turned backs containment measures like Florida Texas Arizona. I'm saying protests cause spread virus, increase result that, maybe 3-4 weaks states like NY starts see increase, definitely say protests. count use them.

It pretty funny though, American, watch idiots puppeteered oppressors' bidding. Wait today! Also, US deaths 1k 17 days. Yesterday today around 650 2 weeks cases started increasing. data found totally agree this. March continue wear mask despite fact I‚Äôm likely immune, want normalize mask wearing. think responsibility immunosuppressed make stand crowd wear masks horrible thought covid. said that? said adding thousand couple thousand daily death toll plenty reason concern big number gaming, it'll help less one work week, they‚Äôve added almost half many cases Michigan (my home state) total cases.  That's question asked. people see state-by-state numbers assume happening major population centers happening everywhere.

Take Texas, example. yesterday confirmed cases county 344. 172 pending. 14 deaths. largest city county 100k, that's live. Everyone seemingly took stay home order seriously, people wear masks public still, testing free available, cases increasing marginally. 

What happening Houston, Beaumont, Dallas, SA, Austin happening everywhere. subjected regulations population centers?

We'd lot clearer picture going looked numbers county county basis rather state state. Texas massive state lot people lot space. happening densely populated areas representative happening throughout state, people live see serious taken think is. Party american exceptionalism-""Being mediocre good enough"" agree two parts many issues. 

There‚Äôs always mix individual governmental responsibility. Even government perfectly run gives perfect instruction, individuals still choose disregard large numbers. Yo, shut up, billionaires want pay taxes, get EAT, got it?! Fucking scum poor people.

/s Well they‚Äôre dumbasses probably get mask like protesters invited criticism stating value greater others based wages. can‚Äôt handle thought committed typing said pay taxes contribute nation's economy infrastructure. got check.

It‚Äôs like live alternate reality. There‚Äôs good chance everyone end getting anyways

You guys one believe it. really believe matter. Hong Kong, especially impressive considering population density. one complaint masks. go sleep su night, reap covers around mouth, similar mask. wear mask (which always public) get little sleepy.

Oh, also fog glasses. think implication fear possibly overblown, course OP at-risk demographics (over 75, morbidly obese, etc).

For vast majority young‚Äôish people, would seem covid worse seasonal flu, understanding measures prevent spread slow it. say, it‚Äôs question you‚Äôll infected, when.

Is incorrect assessment? Applications made PM. it‚Äôs state‚Äôs job protect rights, create obligations. good enough people good things without threat government violence don‚Äôt. aren‚Äôt, we‚Äôll that‚Äôs bad. It‚Äôs government‚Äôs job make us better people. 

That‚Äôs people upset. someone wears mask every time walk outside opposes government forcing people to, resonates me. CAN'T üò≠ Yea people kind searching group, come shapes sizes. friends incredibly liberal like HOAX. 

And like fuck? timetable works regions managed flatten curve. growth continues, number hospitalized people higher infrastructure handle way vaccine found...and maybe even suitable medication procedure handling critical status patients place. Arguing: ‚Äòmurican way.

Don‚Äôt let envy country distract facts current situation. Let‚Äôs hope aren‚Äôt part 50% unemployed next year. Yeah took quite bit time reopening time back bite us ass. blows mind everyone quick dismiss protests. feel like cotton masks needed wouldn‚Äôt seen many countries end draconian lockdowns. really discomfort, fact someone else told it, following order sign weakness them, even ""orders"" expert advice. significant number Americans feel depressing. Neither I. Well also believe climate change conspiracy control tactic elite, makes perfect sense. Yeah that's thought. Ignore anything doesnt confirm bias lol nobel prize economics man everyone protesting wearing masks. Yes, look power structure.

People idiots we've done wonderful job creating misinformation.

That's suggest individual solutions systemic issues. politicians know. make sure also blame them. Yup. saw weeks ago curfews aren‚Äôt actually enforced. Move on! we‚Äôre country selfish, stupid, racist assholes.

We stopped giving fuck ‚Äúour fellow man‚Äù long time ago. 

If doubt I‚Äôm saying, saw armed protest middle pandemic right get haircuts tattoos. I'm wondering well. people starting line hours testing centers got mild symptoms?  starting get scared fevers passing days forced get tested.

Americans already generally dismissive virus good sick-work policies. Alot people grandparents. . ? reduced infections point testing tracing effective. Essential hairstylist, lmfao government

Pick one government start taking rights. person. Mask wearing also accepted part Japanese culture, stemming back SARS 1.0 fact kind fashion accessory. Lots idols groups wear them, even pre-Rona people USA really really want #1 


On worldwide Covid19 death toll list Everyone thinks won‚Äôt happen does. People lack imagination empathy. Stay fuck home wear mask. know don‚Äôt need tell people subreddit incredibly frustrating see much preventable death. True yes. Also needs known infections occurred majority still newer deaths may still continue going deaths lag confirmed cases. Considering Michigan single towns counties cases entire state Ohio, take pretentious shove right ass. truly believe Trump good job responding Coronavirus

Don‚Äôt get wrong Coronas terrible climate change going us next 100yrs hell lot worse.  lung damage result harm virus done body No, post protest vast majority going back distanced stores masks, continue spread rate would continued protest. measures shown contain growth, would likely snuff became surge. Also, might wrong here, say right keep bear face?‚Äô I'm sure read wrote. basically presumes total failure approaches. narrow, entirely hypothetical case. 4 Coronaviruses known cause 15% common cold symptoms worldwide: HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63?
I feel like time stop calling ""Coronavirus"" call CoVID-19.

(If anyone find significant data showing maximum amount cases 4 cause, please let know.) Exactly. sitting FL *livid* 

I friends want organize gov recall truly believe Trump good job responding Coronavirus China 100% blame?

Please convince me. really.

It‚Äôs tragic. üòÇ ride bike around mask it‚Äôs barely noticeable. nice get home take off, end day, hour two day big deal all. 1776 honor. would actually lot public things spend money places people wore masks here. Barely anyone going many places. Costco try social pressure masks go Costco still gets lot money lol. several millions protestors country violating social distancing wearing masks impact spike cases? Keep blabbering southern states btw, never disagreed moron Mine August (scheduled year ago) venue wants charge $5,000 push next year. right we‚Äôre forced host year. Sucks. lol‚Äôd @ ‚Äúgreat philosopher Phil McGraw‚Äù along scared thought crowds big. everyone presented enough evidence convince protest didnt cause spike covid cases. That's like reddit. full lots information. apologies people. Southern states reopening restrictions well protests started.

Those states hardest hit.

One hell coincidence. Let's definitely blame protests, though üôÑ damn 5G towers wear masks suffer? Also Arkansas, 731 previous high 453 May. Governor stepping go back August 10th, TX. POTUS 44.

Better, Bot? likely though active coronavirus infection apparently mild like 14 weeks progressed? 

I‚Äôd imagine dry cough since March something else. Southern states reopening restrictions well protests started.

One hell coincidence. Let's definitely blame protests, though üôÑ fuck things own, thanks offering scapegoat, really, selfish arseholes ‚ÄúNobody!‚Äù ‚Äî Donald Trump live near San Marcos TX 
For weeks seeing almost one wearing masks. scared core. knew witnessing end humanity. difficult wear mask run target, heb petsmart? opening bars etc exacerbated huge problem already brewing here! Yep tends happen exponentially tests one United States biggest protests. Yet somehow people celebrate(d) Elon Musk Messiah himself. didn‚Äôt say blame moron. That‚Äôs problem kids, everything either or.

You‚Äôre telling thousands people shoulder shoulder, wearing masks inevitably took drink effect spreading virus?

You‚Äôre delusional Millions people saddled 100k medical debt next years. Modern day slavery masses. I‚Äôm tired right. damn BLM protestors. We'd spot South Korea them. Facebook post 99% people praising decision talking perfect sheriff. There‚Äôs reason NC, SC, GA TN topping charts far new cases go. said might worse Spanish Flu (worldwide).

I said think US end 2+ million deaths.

I got laughed at.

But counted exactly stupidity full display now. Refusal listen science, political tribalism, pure idiocy. perfect shitstorm. Oh Washington huh? Yeah, fucked. coincidence. lot things cause virus spread. 

Unless reopened well protests began. irrelevant, cases started going exactly two weeks riots started. would suggest Texas Gov time travels, also tell let cities pass mask wearing ordinances. sLoW tEstInG dOwN, pLeaSe. feeling mutual. math wrong, encourage actually go find primary sources spread misinformation. 
 
Avg time first symptoms 5-6 days per WHO, although take two weeks show symptoms. Average time death much shorter 5 weeks (14-19 days per studies seen).  
  
 
The reason lag people still going around spreading incubation period. vehemence direct result tribalism. pole every nuance belief claimed one side other. Instead glorious spheres every axes choice balancing naturally finding sweet sound, resonance life boiled 1 fundamental insane deafening amplitude. cancel culture mass shunning accelerated conversation sides effectively ended reinforced cascade unquestioned ‚Äúproofs‚Äù. many motivations. hatred blame division stoked thousands years. wasn‚Äôt resonant global digital team propaganda bubble war now... might benefit end perceived Christian / Western / White / Male / economic military hegemony well desiring destabilisation China Muslim culture (as would seem common theme)? Would demographic power create demon itself, would talk strongly discouraged blame shifted?  I'm saying ""at all,"" I'm saying community spread occur (which likely) still significant enough cause spikes places.

The obvious common denominator states experiencing major surges opened earlier enact forceful enough containment measures compared states. time post plainly obvious. things change next week we'll talk then. you‚Äôre one...uh...lmfao-ing yet people state won‚Äôt wear mask think bad cold Amsterdam also see increase big protest.

Evangelicals: Cowards. Morons. them. Pretty much. People bored, they‚Äôre rationalizing going out. 

And wonderful government isn‚Äôt willing lead listen public health officials anything help anyone makes less $10 million year. It‚Äôs bollocks.

But yeah, wearing mask save fellow Americans way difficult sacrifice make. You‚Äôre idiot. We‚Äôre done here. doubt gonna make difference ultimately. Schools going open 6 weeks, what? 

We're gonna keep bars beaches closed political points guess Southern states reopening restrictions well protests started.

One hell coincidence. Let's definitely blame protests, though üôÑ dumb. course numbers going go people testing.

If wanna lower numbers, gotta slow testing.

Yall nincompoops pledge allegiance Western Pact States! Yea comes solution? Clearly economy can‚Äôt withstand 24 month lockdown/pause. Perhaps government taking let everyone get infected route. Average hospitalization rate US 10%.

Still bad though. Actually terms worldwide population, 500,000 nothing. that's insensitive say :( still first wave.

If you‚Äôre Florida don‚Äôt like this... might consider leaving state behind. Since bill fucking gates become leading pandemic virology vaccine expert?
Seriously...how majority ppl questioning fuck computer tycoon advising public national pandemic! Fuck. obviously going get much worse. ~3% infected far. Basic math tells us get knockout punch late summer offense spreading misinformation glancing headlines. Severe/permanent organ damage happening extreme cases far common occurrence. people post anti-science shit *the internet*. electricity, hardware, networks, servers, relative comfort allows shitpost first place, countless things.... made possible science. Agree. lot unpack right now, lot worst case scenario. getting effective treating testing. stupid path, it‚Äôs early forecast apocalypse. Thank much!! &lt;3 can‚Äôt unimagine lmao FL. WA rural areas current hotspots.

Yakima (hops cherry farms) 28x infections Seattle. almost crazy believing risk protests spreading infection good cause keep **6 feet** others. cloth face cover **not substitute** social distancing.

That never happened protest. people concerned COVID-19 condemn Thank you. Stay safe ever too. looking good US. like believe people still good. Well enough supply N95 masks work simple life can‚Äôt pay disposable masks whole world.

Good luck.

I personally wear mask work don‚Äôt go I‚Äôm well aware majority world well educated can‚Äôt afford lifestyle. Sorry assumption. hard tell made cases go up. states started opening around time protests started.

However believe cases rose protests states started opening up. mean, there‚Äôs something therapeutic seeing dumbfucks get comeuppance thought covid cancelled? Imagine stupid blame huge spike cases Southern states (who reopened early restrictions) BLM protests üòÇ  see point agree balance one seemingly tipped way one side time protest street hope goes without saying

&amp;#x200B;

thats say people shouldnt allowed voice unique time, ways show support george family dont involve spreading covid much CCP pay write that? Yeah, everything else better. Hopefully stay dorm time. Pretty sure I'll one dining room, even leave want. 

Also excuse move LOL, I've avoiding getting apartment I'm really banking moving there. mean could better treatment antiviral vaccine Shit man imagined years catholic school getting line getting handed piece bread swig wine. Bro look world meter expecting Florida, California Texas 6k Florida barely hits 9k. Holy shit vaccine comes september wait 2021 Learn read numbers axis chart. Come back. apologize me. bunch Southern states reopened early restrictions. know much expect let dream:

Let people mad you. That's small price pay prevent least tens thousands deaths. First 'we'll vaccine october' within 12/18 months.

This vaccine big fugazi much winning! Who's paying push narrative? Big covid? Sorry guys can't top doctors going news saying perfectly fine gather large groups long right political side.

Do links actually happening? us? ND extremely low population density impacts R value tremendously. essentially de facto social distancing. They've also little 3k confirmed cases, total. Saw Snapchat story friend vacationing shore right now, looks different packed summer weekend pre-2020. Fucking shame. Keep deluding yourself. Yah they're totally honest right lol. know find interesting, chinese tear emperor shit heritage replace emperor type person give powers, point lol. Hilarious required every 3 months, distancing masks stay indefinitely. forever. üçª Sorry misread right. basically also said, people saying ""not bad flu"" minds. definitely bad flu, worse right vaccine yet. think understand fucked they'd flubbed this. Reputation everything comes medical research development... fuck they're looking years years consequences. wants study medical research university fucked killed thousands Americans - and, even worse, profit? inherently devalues degree.

Academia definitely bought, talking literal lifeblood department. genuinely think would worth anyone risk damage something fix even billions dollars. Hot weather esp. sunbelt states bring people indoors they're close, prolonged contact. increased testing. Doesn‚Äôt mattttterrrr. test positive death rate gets even lower. Americans fucking Apple‚Äôs business doesn‚Äôt rely retail stores much. Disney, hand, needs parks resorts open make money feel like 90% American's general stupidity levels. 

and like maybe 10% BLM protests. quick test, I'm going type OP title comment:

Reporter Trump's Tulsa rally tests positive COVID-19. Bro, no. good look. know protesters team, no. So, think one taken vaccine yet? time vaccine approved, would large sample space see adverse side effects appear. Fuck. bad would injury want go hospital Houston right now. can't imagine scarier place. company trying get go back I'm like nah.... value life haha riots nothing mask wearing Yeah, someone says im American, person would run side world catching it. That's bad :( Wow...this whole thing going tits up. shut mid-July deaths start racking again. Stay safe US. What? Good let old people die couple days gonna hear 
""So guys it..."" Swine flu's CFR 3.4% believe. Imagine stupid blame huge spike cases Southern states (who reopened early restrictions) BLM protests üòÇ Gettin buckets. Settin records, son. !remindme July 7, 2020 100 degrees lovely melting ice everywhere Ooooh yeah. city opened water park splash pads, also going ahead plans 4th parade firework show complete food truck rally. We're one counties highest cases state already. gonna awful. Lumping michigan red/blue group pretty fucking stupid. densely populated areas Michigan spiking cases also blue. rest state barely cases majority red. probably get informed better making shitty, irrelevant political comments Jfc, that‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôm teacher never signed put life health line. That‚Äôs ridiculous. union say it?  someone please adopt son there? absolutely true follow typical logic 33% vaccines pass phase one go approved. There's plenty now. champion exists, needs identified via proper testing. *Due shutdowns*

FTFY Unfortunately, idea yet actually true, so, percentage people. It‚Äôs way soon. Maybe become vulnerable illnesses, asthma, stroke, autoimmune diseases.  


We still early stages knowledge gathering onCOVID 19 yet people continue gamble future. Pretty sobering.  shoving things faces

It even *sounds* far unsafe put way TLDR; ""put masks fucking peasants"" honestly don‚Äôt think care. Hell, think might enjoy it. Lol wonks won‚Äôt stop following me. 200k cases daily... we'll million total new cases week... fuck... Ya Applebee‚Äôs people never ate groups. 

42% reported today likely herd immunity. New health care procedures reduced death rate minimum 30%. think 42% still high herd immunity. Hide protect old. 60 need change lot.

Do things get death rate .1% let‚Äôs round 35% herd 320 million people. would another 100k deaths get herd properly protect highest risks. Something like 1.7% population account half deaths. done smart would much lower. full racist brutal cops Good thing half population went protest makes feel better, due under-reporting countries accounting excess mortality, we've already hit 500k deaths! :D Wouldn‚Äôt fair expect deaths trail rise cases couple weeks? Nah, everyone disagrees think oppression good thing live Fucking morons. Couldn‚Äôt find diploma award ya go. agreed Like voted ass, don‚Äôt make great decisions!!! remember trump saying 15 cases virus would disappear weeks. mentioned also, kind society created life threatening pandemic secondary race religion certain degree human rights

&amp;#x200B;

personally think human rights trumps everything since encompasses many issues free speech right live safety security Eating restaurant ‚Äúcore Christianity‚Äù, lmao.

And fuck ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù pandemic?

Your rant doesn‚Äôt make sense. Go r/Trump you‚Äôll see quickly much harder needs be. cases like arguably bigger drivers:  Imagine stupid blame huge spike cases Southern states (who reopened early restrictions) BLM protests üòÇ Downward trend? Even yesterday‚Äôs spike caused backlog deaths, earlier week low hundreds deaths. How‚Äôs going 600+ deaths downward trend? see death rate higest beginning first wave know we're dealing with. despite daily new cases doubling per day, deaths per day six times tests done versus then. amount testing done along, death rates would always lower. apparently net stay-at-home behavior significantly contributing COVID-19 Event-study analyses provide strong evidence **net stay-at-home behavior increased following protest onset, consistent hypothesis nonprotesters‚Äô behavior substantially affected urban protests.** effect fully explained imposition city curfews. Estimated effects generally larger persistent protests accompanied media reports violence. **Furthermore, find evidence urban protests reignited COVID-19 case growth three weeks following protest onset.** conclude predictions broad negative public health consequences Black Lives Matter protests far narrowly conceived. Yes yes welcome back earth fore men puff sire real putzes among us. good Phil. How's working you? still believe virus mild flu?

Also, much ask, would kindly please get fuck tv screen? country people fucking stupid. hate US. hate American. I'm fucking embarrassed ashamed. fucking Orange Baby Monkey running fucking country potential replacement old senile fuckwad. fucking fuck. people saying dont wear masks reason dont wear underwear. fucking serious? white supremacy 2020. Fucking forreal? charities prevent white cops killing innocent black citizens? even real anymore? 

Fuck US. fucking deserve every stupid thing happening us. earned it. Good job fucking assholes. going non-essential reasons, think dickhead.

I agree 100%.

However, cops casually murdering people local DA dragging feet pressing charges, blame people protesting, seeing that's proven effective way change achieve sense justice.

Stopping police murdering people impunity seems pretty damn ""essential"" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

In addition, data showing protests even close significant contributing factor spikes we're seeing now. were, Minneapolis would shit show right now. But, not.

So, think protests needed happen, also clear outdoors large portion protestors wear masks pretty damn safe. This. IMHE estimated infections still falling. Confirmed cases meaningless number. I'm Tri-Cities right Fred Meyer shit people wearing masks!!! article US....lol fucking dumb? Honest question, would it? testing accessible now? know treat least little better before? Hamberders covfefe states experiencing spikes ones reopened early poor containment measures? protests we'd seeing spikes every major city nationwide. We're not. common denominator pretty fucking obvious. We're boned. Cases /day steadily increasing Brazil weeks somehow number deaths stagnated 1000 - 1300.

 Something right, number deaths per day 30k new cases/day several weeks ago, wish number correct clearly isn't.

And still health minister lmao Could start small thread listing common covid19 media lies? start:

‚ùå 2+ million US dead

‚ùå 3.4% fatality rate

‚ùå Cloth masks effective

‚ùå Vaccine take 12-18 months

‚ùå Protesting cause severe outbreak

Edit: Downvotes, replies. guys afraid lies, afraid admit media likes lie you?  dry cough three weeks, nobody local would test meet symptom criteria time. Ended ER unable breath due much pain inhaling/exhaling. full pneumonia one lung, admitted following pulmonary doctor six weeks see long term damage. 

I hardly breath all, horrible.

They still refuse antibody test - even family offered pay pocket me. Doctor order never tested positive... test begin with. KY trying keep numbers artificially. surprised all. People taken seriously all. selfish stay inside weekend. I'm gonna like Lux Luthor take cakes lasts forever, COVID-19 eventually mutate weaker strand eventually easier spread unvaccinated, rendering even docile. vaccine means return business usual, even need booster week matter.

Or stronger!

&amp;#x200B;

Any outbreak mean several years isolation, mention virus remain persistent animal reservoirs. Unless make 7 billion syringes every 4 months, we'll forever. government provide facilities wishing opt destroyed. American, never offended something strongly agree with. thought protesting medically safe? came posted whatever reason can't submit post.

Also, reading around poker sites such, hearing several employees testing positive Las Vegas California casinos. 3 million people ‚Äì 15 per cent Chinese capital‚Äôs population ‚Äì tested disease since first cases new outbreak emerged June 11, according municipal government. eight days first infection identified, Beijing declared transmission controlled

I also ear glasses quite hassle glasses fog especially driving. 'Murica! lovely.  Im almost entirely sure tax hike repay that.. 

No real source that, gut feeling. actually check yesterday record day making comment? rioting every night large groups.

We‚Äôll see you‚Äôre right ~15 days‚Äô. it‚Äôs ‚Äòhow would know corona conditions‚Äô. 

I‚Äôm baffled. someone willfully ignorant. spewing doubt? would anyone even doubt something literally threaten thier family‚Äôs life? SUNY system NY yet close. they're planning now, I've heard people work various schools, large lecture classes online, smaller classes socially distanced. sure plan deal dorms housing guaranteed people last year. still semblance social distancing. things cafeterias. They're planning various cuationary measures really seem like enough. Hispanics dont. one don‚Äôt go. Stupiderest! Fuck Yeah! Recently Ive begun wonder china might already vaccine.. Virus warfare? ""By wearing masks, kill least 33,000 people Oct 1st"" - FTFY Well goes favorite past time. Buying someone else's custom sheet cake Costco.

Might recommend nice indica strain weed? Perhaps 9 Pound Hammer help knock out? Takes anxiety paranoia away. Sounds like tightness chest slight cough studies I've seen say antibodies possibly fade 3 months, cells make them. they're reinfection really back kind ""memory"" make covid antibodies. That's thing math. can't debate it. Math math. 

The rise cases occurred ~2 weeks protesting began, ~8 weeks states started opening up. 

Covid19 takes days show symptoms often week get results back. guess went knee jerk reaction seeing many people close together quite people even wearing masks elicited reaction ( wrongly so) .

You certainly wrong unhappy way people ignored lockdown protested without masks (many protesters observe proper social distancing, I'd even suggest majority did, see well-behaved crowds news). yeah, problem impact numbers (you go look Johns Hopkins data clear evidence that.

It's primary factor resurgence, clear fact trend stared mid-to-late May, protests happen end may, reported infections requiring time people exposed get sick 1-2 weeks later. means nothing, matters hospitalizations many states rising. real statistic rely scale virus. 

Confirmed cases literally matter. Like seriously, we've *known* matter months yet still hyper focus despite undercounting cases magnitudes. increase testing capacity, many states weekly, see spikes cases. testing capacity hospitalizations. 

I mean downplay anything, issue rising infections still bad, please, *please* stop focusing confirmed cases major relevant statistic. mean like following directions President giving? world getting little populated. architect like carbon emissions many people designed purge. bad humans good end organic lifeforms earth. balance necessary continue healthy happy experiment!  really took ""live free die"" heart time. Can't wait coronavirus ravage Tulsa next month. Fewer Trump voters never bad thing ""If could go back redo anything, would issued lockdown sooner"" - month two future shit really hits fan governor forced issue full lockdown could know long term effects? Oh sure. fragile freedoms wearing mask protect others pandemic considered un American? Imagine urging people get vaccine? Idk you‚Äôre America we‚Äôre children. children hate taking medicine.  ""I wear mask reason wear underwear, things gotta breathe."" 


I'll leave I'm still trying figure one out. American way. See tomorrow new record wear face mask mean safe participate BLM protests guess... understand said. I'm saying US NZ cannot compared. cities populous dense NYC. Anywhere NZ. dont even many people whole country. opposite, actually. Can't tell liberal scheme? Think it. Coronavirus spreads wipes elder populations, primarily conservative. youthful population remaining vote liberal election election, instituting True Liberal Era US History. Ergo, state strengthened. Texas/Florida Kathys &amp; Kevins: see coming crazy bbqs parties etc. warn us?




Denizens r/coronavirus: did! motherfucking saw coming.  guys need take directly governor. Scare shit him. Demand job. definition insanity dping thing again, expecting different results. DeSantis blood hands. Lol. Good try woman nut. feel sorry three children. Hope ya stay inside forever cause stupid don‚Äôt deserve freedom Got ITT Tech time?

Sounds like speak personal call Governor.

The governor pushing policies loud, obnoxious minority ask them. Haha, yeah pretty big country. I'm sitting 30th floor balcony looking beautiful blue sky. hour I'll pop see band playing local bar, bad Saturday afternoon. 

I'm sure believe though fit impression want China.  I've done similar comparisons, one thing population tell concentration cases within population. example, New York City almost overloaded hospitals, state New York outside city relatively fine. Thus, compared outbreak New York another similarly sized state, able tell significance total cases since populations state, well new cases, going distributed evenly. 

This true Italy well. north, Lombardy epicenter, hit extremely hard, rest country minor outbreaks comparison. So, trying make comparisons based population alone pretty much useless reason even begin get age distribution, comorbidities, healthcare systems place. apples oranges, unfortunately. I'm curious see cities like Minneapolis work, giant indoor skywalk connected bunch buildings such. possible get vaccinated question marks believe known medical field ‚Äúflattening curve vertically‚Äù would replicate uncontrollably cause denial-of-service attack.  Freedumb Statistically US, virus takes break weekend, I‚Äôd expect number Monday Tuesday instead. Uh LA Newsom? It‚Äôs bad now, likely worse back 4 months ago. Remember didn‚Äôt amped available testing now, I‚Äôm willing bet numbers back would even horrific were. States hit hard learn act accordingly, curb thing take serious actions future damage start reversed Europeans things completely differently Americans do. REAL AMERICANS five generations country genetically predisposed independent bigger risk takers Europeans. head in, bit, conspiracy theorists point quote. 

My personal take many people low ‚Äúworking memory‚Äù (RAM) argue them, debunking one crazy idea another, can‚Äôt remember all. I‚Äôve yet try drawing whiteboard something, illustrate overwhelming evidence once. hold one argument head once. 

Or, I‚Äôm space lizard trying trick you, ...something. even though travel dimensions can‚Äôt control small, vastly inferior population like, say, ancient romans did. experience far huge amount teens test positive feeling symptoms. older family members, though? sure do. Bars closed restaurants back 50% capacity. 12 pm, article, deadline bars shutdown. Yeah, need cut hope stuff. Doom gloom gtfo map makers fucking us they? worst I've seen probably city California Washington County state Pennsylvania. least defense, city founded year state admitted Union Washington County came way state Washington, although name rather ubiquitous reason... It‚Äôs possible we‚Äôre able measure externalities accurately. 

See carbon tax policy played capitalistic environment. Sometimes wonder sorts people even made adulthood. Umm people gotta work.. privileged much?? barely saw anyone outside masks Santa Monica Venice starting May, least outside businesses. time bars could operate, people abandoned completely. seen loads pictures people Venice bars restaurants without masks. Biggest concentration mask wearers protests, people walked larger group they'd take off. B b b daddy trump said it‚Äôs ok! stupid since nov. 2016. paying it. Interesting! seen before. (What county, way? San Mateo County mask requirements fines punishing individuals mask requirements fines given businesses whose customers aren‚Äôt wearing masks? recently Adler finally guessed magic combination Abbott would allow, fining businesses rather individual customers. accused us self centered New Yorkers self centered are. wrong 

source: tomorrow Yup. Opentable posted data Dallas reservations restaurants recovered week June 8th almost normal levels end last week/beginning week, tanked 50%. People scared already taking less risk saw number cases sky rocket week half earlier mandate. 

Idk bar/restaurant going survive back-to-back shutdown. Bars open like 3-4 weeks fully shutdown again. purchased alcohol, got people back payroll, probably spent money masks/hand sanitizer/menus/food money tossed away can't spent surviving next 1-2 months. paid sub WSJ, say? mean one platforms killing ACA obviously he'd see win although potential backfire like irresponsible handling coronavirus did. Yeah I‚Äôm sure fuck-it kids go home quarantine spread anywhere....

This America can‚Äôt nice things. many fucking idiots. dismayed number people say ""well obeying rules"" waiting government make good choices. Wisconsin. Walker made sure government able make good choices anymore. biggest failure US history. struggle think anything worse.

The state NY saw 6 times increase hospitalizations 3 weeks **after imposing lockdown**. Currently states even locked yet. 

NY locking 4k daily cases (210.2 / million capita) peaking ~11k cases. Florida, 9k cases, 415 / million capita. even locked yet!

Half measures measures virus. devastating impact. sure it. teacher keeping this, 0% chance half schools cyber.

Now planning send us Florida September. morons get it. We're contractors military, even military shaking heads companies brazen stupidity. didnt know internet always right.

Yet seems like taking vacation high risk place worth problems result. mental health get worse prolongs lock down? going Florida means going anywhere one sick family sick?

I'm genuinely curious, fully understand belief help improving mental health overall beyond temporary.

It sounds like maybe mindset personally staying safe, patience really want go FL. feel frustrated really want go, perhaps vacation take may extend limitations life rest us sacrificing types things. professional mushroom tester, would life expectancy?

Wow. wait, since last time looking Sweden, remember announced increasing testing (just gradually though) yet positivity rate still remained same!??!

Also hiatus Sweden, also recall pretty big outbreak occur outside Stockholm district, updates regarding play positivty rate remaining roughly past week 2?!?!

And lastly though really related post, Tegnell still talking precious antibody levels across Sweden since I've away?!?! haha :P  guess. know, right? almost like researching virus... Completely agree businesses like gyms, bars, theme parks, churches, etc need close immediately. However, people can't live without income.  easy answer.

Our inept government killing people. leadership, plan, denial excuses white house. desperately need strong leader times stand give guidance. president would make HUGE difference would tell base wear mask.

It supposed empowef DIY stuff like making computer game. everybody would create stuff. got megacorations instead. read happened Italy? That's going happen parts country. People need start making decisions gets needs gets sent home die. 70? treatment. patients come people 60 get treatment, 50, see going now?

This many us working hard flatten curve.

Italy got point pulling ventilators older people could intubate younger people R0 1 since end April.

Because people motivated money lack money, entire rant kind proves.

As Texas Florida well.. even worst leader ship think financial capability California. superpower size his, ehrm, state. That‚Äôs experts seem think. Cold weather apparently better transmission, similar influenza. 

We never really saw first wave Florida paying it. thought done hadn‚Äôt even started yet.  can‚Äôt cure stupid. weeks ago, would said thing. original concepts SAP co. questionable, among things central data storage planned. fact data privacy friendly solution found mainly thanks data privacy NGOs CCC. provided design criterias app opposing initial approach.

He's right, chipping nearly enough people vaccines YET! I'm going downvote scary really want to. 56%....... Vitamin School starts August Texas. announced opening like nothing wrong. Interesting take, thanks giving terms Google! I've thinking deal people like while...  California consistently cases, you‚Äôd expect state double population. people talking significant daily increase Florida cases last days. Florida almost 9k cases confirmed today, California day ignored coming.

At time saying doesn‚Äôt transmit humans easily cause concern. Lol

But even isn‚Äôt saying end quarantine social distancing. quotes lifted context proven remote worst case scenario reporter baited director. 

You ain‚Äôt got legs stand on, black knight argument entire time I‚Äôm generally pro-economy side types issues. consumers aren‚Äôt confident feel safe, they‚Äôre going go spend money. 

My area PA finally went ‚Äúgreen‚Äù phase today allows inside dining restaurants 50% capacity, opens salons, etc. people know still going out.

One lockdown bad economy. one much, much worse. I‚Äôd take one longer lockdown multiple short ones. Texas learning lesson now. Coronaviruses include Rhinovirus cause human cold. drop antibodies reinfected. Perhaps always around, eventually mutated cause worse symptoms. that's case long run screwed even worse Let's forget numbers we're seeing today state virus two weeks ago Yeah, here. bullshit 3 months knowing COVID-19 ""magic market"" still ramped production PPE. else fails, go ""whoops"" approach.

This evil looks like usually wields bible really. try find shade middle day, air conditioning isn‚Äôt necessary (usually).  funny, never heard keeps talking highlighting it. almost like kept mouth shut she'd never eye public scrutiny. BUILD WALL.

I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm Canadian right now. work full time? Sure, can.

But think investors somehow satiated getting money... that's works. always want more. level return investment profits somehow become less appealing. think Brian Kemp, GA Governor. That's thing. *Most*. even that's true photos I've seen. Thanks encouraging words. Means lot. sort paralyzed fear, especially young baby special circumstances, haven‚Äôt gone anywhere since mid March. It‚Äôs exhausting. 

I, along millions others, really keeping eye vaccine, that‚Äôs thing matters mind. virus less contagious, treatable. basically available hospital capacity handle letting blow (hopefully). depressed that. 

Similarly, trying organize thousands thousands amateur iPhone photos years. got lost that, would keep occupied. 

Best luck yours. Stay well. Sadly think right. Sure, it‚Äôs insightful answer. Anyone could come idea ‚Äúadvanced computers figure out‚Äù half new cases reported southern states seeing spikes. point, whole separate section Worldometers. North recovering beautifully. Matt ""I sleep adopted Cuban son prove I'm racist"" Gaetz? Him?

Yeah, fuck him. commendable see least ONE politician putting health followers political aims. 

Great Job Mrs Sturgeon. literally bring ‚Äúthe wrath god‚Äù yourself, family community, wonder it‚Äôs happening you. almost feel bad born dumb. Yeah, anything welding doors shut massive apartment complexes... think hear saying poor deserve poor. 

Poor people significantly likely understand hard work thing keeping alive. entitled people think run country inflating fiat currency infinity work hard hour many rural communities fine,

$15 hour many rural communities value labor started much later post protests predictions There‚Äôs lot story that. knew full well coming back December. apparent disaster making US January unless took massive action then.

All proof 100% true. ChinaFlu sub, sub, reports internal gov folks memos conversations December.

Politics. merely pawns much larger game. management restaurant work doubly ignorant. COVID-19 food-borne illness. Cleaning kitchen make difference. WTF even talking about. STFU answer one question....HOW MANY PEOPLE DIED (hint: cause know hard use there) 120,000 deaths first 4 months global pandemic. hey right? fuck right? Oh know president closed border China saved us all. Thank Mr president. ;/ pretty much dumbest comment I've ever seen need educated. vaccine like yearly flu shot recommended everyone protect young protect elderly. young people protected passing virus elderly fact protect large portion elderly population rest risk population. It‚Äôs like masks, don‚Äôt wear masks protect wear masks protect highest risk population.  ""And president! even guy? people see Idiocracy movie think good idea?"" thats world wide tho spread 6 billion people. I'm standing work right restaurant I'm literally watching servers walk around noses masks, almost one believes virus real Yes! Limiting trips grocery store eating lots beans rice. Also, yoga daily since there's much outside house, except hiking also great! Spain treats tourists really badly. Customer service def lacking. Everywhere went taxi, Uber, airport, hotel reception, restaurants, etc met terrible attitudes people pissed reason. 

Do know act miserable? Kraken virus There's source report article ""tentacle discovery"" virus ""artificial nature"". Also, site looks kinda sketchy. Where‚Äôs data leaves long term problems high percentage people? really really hate :( 5%? sub wishes. No, can‚Äôt that. 5G microchipped pedophile sex ring Hmmmm I'll go GO say ""My immune system hurts"" primary cause problem would widespread, including countries, knowledge, seeing level resurgence virus. Also hospitalizations lag behind new cases too, meaning spread started earlier. 

Also, everything know virus says far safer outside crowd mask usage inside restaurant bar can't use mask. latter basically ideal environment spread. But, shall see, time good studies done post mortem really way know sure. live one worst countries world yet another metric. state one 4 currently listed ‚Äúon track contain covid‚Äù... tbf got hit hard early people taken seriously plateau happen time. South Asia seeing exponential rise cases recently. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia etc. huge population yet reach peek. July 4th, number cases come countries combined Americas. comment wrong many ways. idea behind towards end year, enough people received vaccine get exposed virus, solid data safety efficacy. see nothing bad, take bit risk release vaccine. potential likely safety issue arise 6 months testing far less significant disease already killed half million left millions long-term issues. actually...read court rulings link? timing &amp; geographic locations would suggest protests weren‚Äôt main factor spread, although probably didn‚Äôt help Simple. won‚Äôt. Benevolent dictators fantastic transition power.


What actually need strong AI governing us one country. South Bay Area, CA here. Instacart daily think situation pretty good actually, everyone wears one. AA like Pier One industry. They've trying go business unsuccessfully like 40 years, keep bringing back. Why?! like bad horror movie bring guy back he's begging let die. last day seen 1k deaths 9th. gone since then, yesterday today 650. Cases started spiking 12th. guess we'll see two weeks. Stay home. must go wear mask, wash/sanitize hands often maintain social distancing. introverted ass left house weeks besides hitting essentials, biking, hiking, kayaking. I'm loving (the isolation, pandemic). extroverted girlfriend pretty much climbing wall though. I'm sure she'd murdered room get space lol Yea duh Actually people vote large scale would good start. Shame rigged anyway Apparently due improved treatments chances bad outcome lowering I'm Northern CA, \~95% people wearing masks. unhinged people streets wear 'em. Though I've seen them...strapped around chins.

I heard family Southern CA unmasked men yelling emasculating things street men wearing masks, mind-boggling.  would interesting. always thought US unusual. Imagine continental America countries that's borders actually followed geography(?) It‚Äôs fucking frustrating. wife diligent fuck... Sofia distancing, wearing masks, going out, getting groceries delivered. We‚Äôre going fucking nuts able see friends family, especially she‚Äôs pregnant first. financial situation stable, I‚Äôm eaten alive stress whole thing causing. going stretch well next year rate, that‚Äôs fucking horrifying. potential death numbers, here? 500k? million? worthless fucking dipshit president evil, greedy conspirators couldn‚Äôt one fucking thing right whole mess? Why? It‚Äôs infuriating! pandemic political issue, yet fucks want pander dumbest people country gets votes. orange idiot would said ‚Äúwear masks stay away other‚Äù fucking garbage could avoided. Instead ‚Äúinject bleach‚Äù words wisdom? 




America sinking, disease-ridden ship wish could get of. Seeing headline makes want many tears joy living Korea end February left return Texas, Korea peaking. 

It around 8k cases returned fear. Masks social distancing full effect, flight everyone wearing masks.

I antibody test know get one, able get COVID test literally done within six hours without leaving house. saw doc nurse. good optimistic, keep mind still data humans taken vaccine also exposed covid19. This, this, give definitive evidence efficacy safety. 

Neither safety efficacy vaccine known yet. Yes, animal data monkeys, keep mind quite different humans tested 6 monkeys. 6.

Antibody-dependent enhancement skewed immune responses major safety concerns thus far data them. I'm laying $100K hot tip. Bring home Zhmudenko! They're 9k minutes ago. Might 20k next week. fuckit, 100k. not.  way moderate cases generally distinguished mild cases development pneumonia. patient develops pneumonia (even recuperate home), pushes moderate category. That‚Äôs considered secondary complication. That‚Äôs clinical guidance I‚Äôve seen indicates. (ARDS severe organ disfunction obviously severe.)

I never developed pneumonia, despite bizarre lung symptoms. look guidance around disease, you‚Äôre mild present range flulike symptoms, despite severe may become. develop pneumonia, you‚Äôre moderate.

Are medical field? I‚Äôm curious it‚Äôs defined differently hospital setting. NC split two extremes right now; urban areas people took seriously first, began get lax Phase 2 reopen, rural areas, one took seriously all.

The rural areas marginally valid point - people areas spread cases low stayed fairly low, that's changing since travel state WAY up, rural areas along major highways seeing cases either state state visitors.

Combine general weariness urban areas originally took seriously, finally hitting restaurants enclosed spaces previously closed... major shitstorm.

Cases going up, people care. rural-ites care never did, urban-ites care they've spent 3 months penned inside, absolutely go out. research uncovering evidence COVID-19 related star spawn Cthulhu. Hard decide that‚Äôs maddeningly terrifying kind darkly awesome. wish could live Canada. haven‚Äôt seen parents months, good luck grandpa. OK. Obligatory: USA! USA! USA!

And realize we‚Äôve gone world police world pariah one sad faced presidency. Yeah nothing definitive situation still fluid. case Rockwood. hybrid approach would alternating days well. DeSantis next week: ‚ÄúI made HUGE mistake.‚Äù Imagine learning fucked denial science directly responsible much death. think feels like? Michigan? sad multiple options fit criteria.

I'm far conservative, that's irrelevant. reality situation. I've tried figure think walk around mask mysteriously build immune system; therefore catch virus. agree much hurts. West Texas throwing fit ‚ÄúMuh Riaghts‚Äù worst saw far compliance gas stations, constantly busy involve interactions people going directions. 

It‚Äôs really really bad. instagram search shits n gigs gotta say, doesn‚Äôt exactly look like think active, healthy person looks like. Anyone sort weight issue needs super careful. daily deaths at? Cause new cases really mean much testing capacity keeps going (thus reported cases), deaths remain similar. Joe Biden? you? Dicks Corona?!?!

I've got weird boner right now... tired this. far today heard ""The second put lungs fire!"" even better former employer REFUSED enforce state,CDC, guidelines:
""One employees hospital respiratory disease""

Really? cloth mask?? Cereal, Lee Honestly Yellowstone, national park, probably safest option vacation right now. You‚Äôll outdoors away people majority time. Wear mask you‚Äôre worried, you‚Äôll fine. You‚Äôre right. nothing

Nobody allowed change behavior. Jesus, disaster... Scary. Sadly, likely type people probably believe universal mask wearing big part east Asian countries got handled well comparison. True, per capita 6 times higher Italy, also bad place March/April.

But still 90% decrease peak beginning April. Well know problem Utah. Everyone know science denier. highest? CDC data says 43,438 cases 04/06/2020. Public transportation place masks required.

I think mask req policy need apply everywhere. 1 place. Well shit, joke works lot worse ""Phil Murphy, probably"" Admirable, naive. one person put position fault millions people, enabled pundit class. rate, several multiples death rate flu. honest know make that. world ending, still massive amount people would outstrip single cause premature death.

(2) President Trump testing available every single person comes gates White House. means? People around always tested.

Distancing easy enough store see much foot traffic. bit harder stores popular hours like payday afternoons/evenings (tip: avoid shopping hours). Optional venues like tattoo parlours, bars &amp; clubs, fine indoor dining, indoor entertainment/recreation remain closed down. $100 richer madden simulations!! Hes enabled morons, even new York still cautious got hit hard I'm sad rest country laughed us instead learning preparing themselves.

Before anyone goes one country, 50 states run independent governments needs federal help create unity.

The feds failed, states left leaders seeing effect individual responses.

I hate Cuomo topics I'm glad worked others jumped March apparent getting help White House. hiding deaths pheumonia can't spell unsafe without USA! USA! USA!  China every reason deflate numbers. Totally agree. dont see indication deflated *who* got sick etc. NYC examples etc. BLM pointless. Gotcha. seem well informed. last 3 years feels like we‚Äôre living part textbook read can‚Äôt believe happened. lot go back time Abbott, still power TODAY actually mandate masks public yet wanna talk time traveling instead.

Holy hell feel like I‚Äôve taking crazy pills 2020. people Texas deserve much better ‚Äúleadership‚Äù this. bet puts seatbelt on. What‚Äôs difference?

Here‚Äôs thing, don‚Äôt think see enough actual death ICUs. I‚Äôm seeing it. need cameras show people dying without families. stomachs ventilators breathing them.

We‚Äôve seen car crashes people wear seatbelts they‚Äôve seen means wear one crash. government putting PSAs, fucking moron White House can‚Äôt get message. idiot won‚Äôt wear mask himself. sucks man office America needs actual leader. can‚Äôt protest heaven, buddy. shocked busy everything was- like free all! Shoulder shoulder people, masks, distancing... yikes!!!! using oregon sports betting app chance? cuz that's lost money ukrainian table tennis lol Man someone competent enough right things listen experts advice handle situation. Im looking forward daughter's highschool get *interview parent 2020*

I got 10 years impeach Governor? fly ointment dangerous wear mask, dangerous around them. incur risk... Two weeks large scale protests began across country. I‚Äôm surprised. I'm scared... hate this. scared virus mutates something worse. confirm. People Utah refuse wear call ""masks oppression"" made note today calling July 6, Monday 4th , texas roll back 25% capacity, mandatory masks ducking give up. FML Oh, she‚Äôll probably find first hand. Yeah, people dying *all world* election year USA. Americans self-centered, embarrassing. Buckle up. gonna get way way worse. things dont improve see 200k people America dead end year. mean luckily 15 age typically affects dramatically. Please help us Georgia signing petition make masks mandatory. cases increased like crazy people wearing masks social distancing. [link Jacksonville here. apparently hosting convention! mishandling pandemic part protests big shut door face shout, ‚ÄúBegone Satan!‚Äù? Buttery Males* Holy shit indeed. I'm NJ town 84,000 2,000 cases. people street far know, nobody died. people displayed good decisions point? Disneyland pushed back reopening date yesterday. FL well passed LA levels pandemic growth. take much Walt Disney World follow. CA government that's pretty much keeping Disney opening here. FL DeSantis... OK screwed. Eat this, guidance almost entirely cooking choices smart recipes. messaging drifted years, core, navigating food select restaurants takeaway places. 

You make whatever want home call muffin. buying muffin outside home, muffin shockingly high number calories, portion size often shit like ""1/3 muffin"" unless explicitly marketed diet food (and even tend shitty portion sizes unrealistically smaller ""one muffin"")

I'm saying fuck muffins, fuck pretty much every muffin could buy bakery, grocery store, coffee shop, restaurant.

And please, gasp. hold in, that's healthy hold onto. Masks, fricking Turkey, masks!!! ton population dump ass Leaders Although increase attributed testing. go 100k tests 400k tests positivity infections also show quadrupling.  problem April New York ar like 30% positivity si missing lot cases. south believe day April...?

Not sure April, though...  Kminder 6 months! Want muffins without muffin top?

Eat This! it. makes sense. 50,000 cases yesterday we've single day, 41,000 cases today also single day? ‚Ä¶ worked well thus far bdsm

that new me. tell more.  idea talking about. People like spewing shitty data making sub joke. weird mentality portion population got triggered wearing mask make political. Possible second wave!? almost 200k cases yesterday. that's wave I'm going Mars Elon Musk ASAP. [1470 total Rural patients get routed nearest city, cared people deride ""leftist"" caring pandemic. people work time clean rooms wearing mask never heard anyone dying Yeah idk fuck lied without doubt taught kick infection, antibodies remember allow back. 

While guess entirely wrong, turns possible get reinfected strain? sources posted seem mention one two things could happen. Either antibodies leave time, virus mutates unrecognizable form. also may possible strain reinfect someone even presence right antibodies?

This feels like taught blue blood red blood elementary school.  mask mandate state exception mentally ill disabled. well deaf. would beat virus meddling kids!! /s short tests point though? Asking friend.. I‚Äôve thinking lot Cassandra lately. curse really *curse*. Fucked up. deaths trail behind confirmed cases. average hospital stay corona recovery 22 days, average stay corona death 19 days (don't know that's still current, accurate long ago).

Deaths trending cases trend mean shit yet. might. might turn right, yet, act like it. one puts Zhmudenko corner. Mass graves heading. Indoors means malls restaurants. People dont hang outside, chill indoor public spaces argument? masks filter virus well mask dirty washed every usage/changed often? sure, know actually abided March April May. fairness folks good phase 1 reopen. Prior ‚Äúessential services‚Äù open. main different sounds like essential services could take restaurants delivery, preferred reduces contact point delivery person. Folks grocery stores city almost masked too. stores went also disinfected carts shields registers installed within week stay home orders. 

My observations folks Memorial Day actual social media feeds posts people grew went college with. Instagram stories showed beach bars running much different people here.

Edit: reference grew outside city went school New England too. Family still region saw lot close second hand. I‚Äôm digitally high-fiving bro üñê

Be strong üí™ *nervously hums star-spangled banner* English propaganda best. Everytime posted candid questions subreddits would get banned. finally people real research, course Americans mentally block facts, matter though. example:

1. Wuhan origin, earth SEA nations (including Indonesia little precautions) much better west despite SEA hottest travel spot China winter.

2. 'mysterious vaping pulmonary disease deaths' reported USA since Aug 2019, despite many victims vape all. Timeline would fit virus Americans brought virus Wuhan October military games. Also, France found early case mid Nov 2019 according doctor.

If stating facts would result ban bubbles, that's problem mine. Test center Poway. appointment required. Netherlands, schools already open back normal(ish). say fine, stopped reporting numbers 2nd day it, we're kind coping, comparable... anecdotal information worth shit... Sorry brother internet stranger UK gonna find exactly different contact tracing Italy Spain would insanely expensive who's going want waste entire day train could 4-5 hours plane?

I'm proponent high speed rail make sense longer distances 500 miles so.

There's regret, ready sacrifices months ago. lame excuse. drove past old Town Monrovia month ago mandatory face mask ban see everyone dining like pre pandemic. saw maybe like 10 masks per 100 ppl pretty bad.

HOLY MOLY FUCKAMOLE people consider donuts, typical pancakes (Costco awesome lazy pancake mix pretty good nutritionally), cinnamon rolls, insanely sugary drinks super sugary cereals actually healthy?! How?

Never said that. said consider ""breakfast"" (because they're culturally considered breakfast foods US). Even eat pancakes night, that's still called ""breakfast dinner"".

Problem lots people really consider whether stuff healthy, long culturally normalized eat. Many many people consider health unless there's problem it, eat whatever sounds good. Sugar sounds good.

It's balance. ancestors found honey wild, probably ate TON honey. work get get often.

There's something said cinnamon rolls christmas morning, time special treat commanded. yeah, folks constantly eating way, that's....intense. done research. says we're right. imagine sheep would say usual yammering course sure districts around country one kids go North Texas giving everyone option attend campus, remote learn combo coming school year. scenario see US locking down?

They live alternate reality get make up, people telling reality come *bothers them*. idea can't control reality might actually listen someone else bothers them. simultaneously saying extremely high density areas people safe distance fine, states operate. it‚Äôs terrible sin, it‚Äôs one places currently spiking.

Don‚Äôt strawman me, said. made argument you‚Äôre making.

I knew /r/politics users weren‚Äôt smartest take cake.

/s Hijacking ask.. NYT updating florida 9k 5k? want highest daily increase US? shit like it... I'm skeptical seems counterintuitive would see exponentially infections/mortality several months experience testing treating disease.

With said, Texas resident shit looks bleak af state immediate future.

Yes, US much larger Brazil, what, exactly, want consider? 

Consider US vs India (4x larger). US cases deaths, India kept growth rate lower, avoided big initial spike. mean India can't / cases &amp; deaths later. school Christian Conservative. They‚Äôll say thoughts prayers reopen. didn‚Äôt give shit got hospitalized catching there. Move another country. I‚Äôm Aus people freak 1 new case Sydney yesterday üòÇ taking way way personally   really wish people could space mental energy empathize respect people wearing stupid mask staying hell +6ft away.

Why. Is. It. So. Hard. To. Just. Try. Gotta hitem *Hitchslap!* sucks :( Glad hear recovering Correction.. learn. [this school Montreal already practicing hand-washing, distancing, reduced class sizes yet 9 12 kids one class tested positive along teachers. time article published still trying figure outbreak began one theories started teacher spread students.

There similar case mid-May South Korea [one teacher](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200514000921) infected nine students, went infect another five people including family friends. 

My daughter misses classmates teachers really wants return in-person classes Fall. understand statistically even catches Covid-19 school she‚Äôll *probably* ok - however underlying health condition I‚Äôm terrified she‚Äôll pass disease I‚Äôll potentially fare much worse. could possibly vaccine six months, think survive another semester online school fine, I‚Äôd much rather return distance learning fall keep family safe first priority. agree less people wearing masks. going home work last Sunday, hot day, people saw wearing masks. think it‚Äôs worth noting outdoor restaurants.

This Manhattan;TriBeCa  Please elaborate, doctor. mean yeah that. Cause knew people dumb AF. mean... Americans can‚Äôt even wear damn mask without throwing tantrum ffs. Hit selfish fuckers something harder time get it. reply compassionate logical arguments, respond force It‚Äôs god damn 5% death rate. first thought pool testing good idea. People staking much potential false positive false negative. tests far valuable statistically. *thought* pool testing meant testing population whole, watch trends.

What they're talking dumb. increase false negatives, increase wait-time positive. clearly panicking. wonder young people 2-14 days ago cause this?  knew benefit, want get drawn reddit argument internet stranger little nice (probably right word). poor comment park. still read article though incase (when) see FB friend talk work. Cuomo Murphy oversaw responses ten times death rate Newsom‚Äôs. people need food. agree grocery one high risk areas though would great Dude, reopening plan like 100+ pages insanely specific type business phase they're getting flack detailed complex. valid criticism. dont seem understand percentages mio Americans visited Europe 2016 (haven't found recent total 713 mio tourists 

The Visited European Nations

Here list visited European countries 2017.

So come conclusion: get along pretty well without 12 mio get expect God judge completely ass fellow human possibly killing someone something preventable. God tests says kind fellow human run around infecting people. Im sure heaven resume thats going look pretty bad. Wait what? That's weird me. got two weeks ago go back September 8th.  Bolsonaro Trump competing cause bigger disaster. actual hell going there. It‚Äôs like almost half China‚Äôs total cases single day. 
I‚Äôm Aus scary hell numbers. everyone given up? always used look US world leader things didn‚Äôt think would this. arguing conspiracy theorists.

Hey now, throw conspiracy theorists bus here. sub-culture, one size fits all. conspiracy theorist, abhor willful ignorance.

The 'conspiracy theorists' speak speak conspiracy theorists.

Call bullshit see it, please associate morons.  Turns there's thing ""reality"" all, narratives vast majority people 80-90% wearing masks here. nobody even aware virus Holy shit. read comments places America, realize, never want leave MD. work retail literally exact opposite. Everyone wear masks, including customers, everything's wiped down, use sanitizer, etc. Crowds also even though cases low reopened. Fuck me. I'm coming realize place less state life raft. response level headed. bothered 5 minutes Google searching could find enough info show masks worth wearing. would people ever go route. get grace period, get rewards points, get quarters extra rewards, get protection like chargeback. Wait, what? Like, mask covering ""rapist"" birthmarks pedos' chins? mean, knew scientist studies diseases spread would know would happen states opened early??? Color shocked! main growth inland rural California. growth urban centers. Staten Island.. many wear masks number people wearing growing think option C translatable /s [New York 16: 950 total cases, 7 total deaths, shut schools

Mar 20: 7102 total cases, 46 total deaths, shut non-essential businesses.

New York hit new daily cases Mar 23 come close 9k new daily cases Apr 2.

I see DeSantis anything shut anything right now. Bro. ‚ÄúSeriously‚Äù get out. Option D) it‚Äôs hoax orchestrated Bill Gates California list? record day Things seemed like heading right direction despite blatant ignorance social distancing guidelines, cases started surging nowhere. 

The northeast needs remain alert continue they‚Äôre keep transmission low. Transition exponential growth seems happen spontaneously. Could? already has. 3 tons 6000 pounds. average adult US weighs 180 pounds. 'tons people' would 33 third people, average. also hope gets re-elected, little faith American voters ü§û Weddings over-rated. like hike idea, like parents, please invite them. im 14 Yup, Texas epicenter protests bars weren‚Äôt open 7 days week well everything else. *facepalm* That‚Äôs biggest no-no Why? there‚Äôs place catch virus it‚Äôs store hundreds people thousands everyday feel ya. year Well great. Happy new year 2016 indeed.  Central Valley people dumb.

Given way many v ote, surprising. According Worldometers, final count 47,341!! destroyed yesterday‚Äôs record 40K! Unreal. saying projection like one did, would use IFR, CFR. 2.5 months ago. today way worse. 

In 3 weeks numbers 5x-10x numbers unless get heads asses. really depends district decide do.

*If* hospitalizations peaking looks really bad, surprised see school delay start push full distance learning. Tuesday deaths gonna start rolling en masse. Florida Texas can't keep ""only 40 people die everyday"" lie up.  stooge get elected? LDS Church would neeeeever that. !Remindme 1 month  Yeah, builds healthy immune system *gags little* worth 1 minute time rough quick &amp; dirty answer.

If saying 'herd immunity' scenario would drive radically different rate, Reddit public platform, go ahead math. live Houston 100% agree need full lockdown. Closing bars good, still movie theaters, amusement parks, gyms, hair salons, places opened don‚Äôt need be. Restaurants 50% 50% still quite lot people. 

We need go back April everything closed except essential businesses, restaurants take out/delivery only, mask order everyone. 

Are going get that? Probably not. we‚Äôd listened redditors!  think weird Netherlands literally one wears masks people pretend mandatory public transit. disaster. pretty skeptical mask thing think perpetuates thought covid scary. theres thing called constitution united states explicitly says restrict free movement citizens. would go bad city/govt whole. head sand approach disease control never correct option. Meanwhile, Texas Medical Center ICUs full capacity. noooo...it's media. loser. Corona scared Pop good news me. matter vaccine comes first, either way humanity wins.

The better. we're seeing recording cases BLM protest seeded community transmission? in, protesters themselves, also people protestors infected. shortage protests there. That's fair point. guess trust companies ever right thing. Bruh shut dumbassery, ‚ÄúLOL sTiLl tHiNk gOd‚Äù. this, apocalyptic anime something? It‚Äôs bad yeah, it‚Äôs point saying stuff like this. Fuck around find out. feel like reason deaths high right now, new cases spread around country. NYC majority cases deaths before. hospitals near capacity. stay pace, deatjs catch we'll multiple NYC's around US. econimical power prevent that... issue shit hole government needs done. I'm sure would not. I'm pretty sure party recover that. evidence that? Protests 2-3 weeks ago. Looks like incubation period plus days get test results back me. Protests reason, likely contributing factor. Yes, worst states ones opened early now, US whole seeing record numbers. 

If gonna tell protests help cause increase guess go outdoor MLB games wearing masks next month, yet reason they're going even allow fans games kidding me? live miami? Bars packed. masks anyone. sell stupid microwaved appetizer get around rules.

I drove downtown coral gables friday night 
Wynwood open design district packed. Even it‚Äôs ready October it‚Äôs made Britain won‚Äôt getting October maybe January lucky. That‚Äôs trump doesn‚Äôt burn bridge first  western Canada silently building walls keep out. 8 days later. Cases peak 9000. partial lockdown implemented. 

POLITICO: DeSantis pivots Covid-19 surge, says testing account happened people state acted like did.

But fake news right? Fair know people protesting Canada right? Yeah I‚Äôm ecstatic Boston especially I‚Äôm currently shit show whatever fuck Florida headline misleading regards subreddit whole. People work, they'll send kids since there's options. Yeah! town 16,000~ went 32 51 2 days. Anytime go grocery store see ton people wearing masks. Like hard people, part bear over. It‚Äôs coming. Disneyland denied permission open Imperial county ordered shut start getting people used idea. thought reach level responsibility governor similar, qualifications consist mostly making mistakes.
I know hindsite, half county federal government knew would happen. can't let ""everyone makes mistakes"". college rape case, leader state letting tens thousands people die. stock market. followers think reason stock market performed great last years. fair, stellar stock market performance direct result incredibly irresponsible tax cut passed first year office. Now, Fed pumping trillions dollars keep stock market all-time highs. 

All Trump manage response somewhat decent way, would've golden. unite country give us inspiration leadership, instead chose thing knows do-- create conflict. 

I'm expecting stock market finally start fall response undeniably bumbled way, knows. Federal Reserve pumped trillions liquidity far, hard think they'll stop now, point rest America likely see is. happens, there's guarantee Fed able pump enough liquidity stop coming crash. Time tell. two days row record numbers mixing different reports thing?  course falling. coming closer election. America stopped reporting deaths 2 weeks ago protesting began everyone streets,its time high record infection rate America supposed death drop? Lol. Bit convenient Welcome r/SanDiego r/SanDiegan story Back 17 Beijing? That's good. Charles Darwin said it‚Äôs OK don‚Äôt wear masks don‚Äôt practice social distancing. deaths rising? US deaths 1k 18 days cases started spiking 12th. Today 650. seeing spike deaths right now? California, Newsom said would open state based science &amp; data, Trumps fault recent surge cases? absolutely fucking insane Americans used face masks political debate.


You guys literally destroyed economy nothing can't wear fucking mask. guys nerve critique every asian country specifically China hardcore lockdown look, control.


There social distancing here, courteous others wearing mask. virus highly like spread close someone people touching shit touching face mouth.


This facemasks god damn important.


All fucking hurt reason America. Truly clown entire world right now. Well isnt obvious?  good thing lower deathrates Someone hand man certificate reading comprehension.  


Make sure level 1 though still working word ""we"". worry champ get there. Oh it‚Äôs 126k dead people. Wtf wrong you. could raise ethical values clearly don‚Äôt conversation pointless. 
Let know it‚Äôs still ‚Äúnot big deal‚Äù get someone gives shit gets it.  Right? Completely tried put words mouth. Correct. 51,000? thought reported 47,000. accounts difference? really. America fucking stupid. Half people want wear mask constitution half, berated people wanting re-open ""only wanted hair did"" suddenly ready abandon social distancing risk want protest death someone murdered, murderer charged. Bravo! disagree. Mainly due fact personally, I‚Äôm willing accept risk getting COVID possibly transmitting it. risk low, low amount cases, quite frankly I‚Äôm willing %100 put life hold. don‚Äôt know long we‚Äôre expected social distance for, I‚Äôm seeing sources say 2022. People similar argument back early March said wouldn‚Äôt year, it‚Äôd months. willing that. Simply put, recognize strictly following social distancing would benefit society whole, look myself. mental health took nosedive started I‚Äôm process getting diagnosed either anxiety, depression, I‚Äôve already diagnosed pretty bad ADHD. Even seeing couple friends, mental health gotten much better last couple weeks. need put first needs others second. I‚Äôm contributing problem seeing couple friends mostly social distancing isolating. thing doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs ending anytime soon, agree everybody locked we‚Äôd able end that‚Äôs simply reality. need learn live next year two everybody needs gauge amount risk acceptable people live with. many many people saying since january feel like thing happened Houston Lina Hidalgo. I'm expert, believe injection flu vaccine dead vaccine impossible get sick it, except allergic reactions (my niece allergic eggs use eggs incubate flu virus can't get injection). believe nasal mist vaccine attenuated people weak (seriously immunocompromised) would able get sick it. 

The likely thing got different strains flu. think year pick 4-5 stains predicted common create vaccine those. problem predictions occasionally wrong new unexpected strain pops up. Even last year missed predictions effective (I knew even got mine). However, exposure antibodies flu strains tends help body get head start fighting it, least partially effective antibodies symptoms usually severe dont last would otherwise. We've grown flu vaccines kinda take granted pretty pretty good handle treating think dangerous, forget 1918 pandemic flu. Even flu still kills tens thousands every year. 

The good thing hundred stains coronavirus like flu eliminate guess work involved yield effective vaccine, least that's way seems me. Either way, even told could still get sick, would greatly reduce symptoms especially severe ones would happily call win. may perfect solution we've hoping for, could reduce hospitalizations deaths 70-80% would still major victory. testing monkeys showed prevented virus growth lungs(so lung damage), think monkeys may still gotten little sick. However also dosed monkeys equivalent essentially entire covid19 ward coughing eyes,noses,and mouths try best get sick. produces strong response humans (which seems like does) random person coughing 20ft away grocery store problem might even show fever. think real question worried weather produce strong antibody response, long antibodies last. last years probably wipe covid easily enough least pair seasonal flu vaccines, last months much harder. Holy fuck, no.

Re-read first sentence reply you. friend lives Houston hosting big party next weekend celebrate Fourth, wedding anniversary, MIL's birthday. updated FB party still matter what. can't talk ""liberal"" ""afraid shadow"". wearing masks church, work anywhere else. thinks since caught means get it. also completely dismisses idea asymptomatic transmission.

Perhaps weeks read news outbreak originated party. maybe letting people pack like sardines streets wasnt great idea?

maybe letting people burn businesses loot wasnt great idea? Living dream buddy. think thinks would lot better sorely mistaken underestimate poor public's reaction wholem. playbook. put much credence media's preporting Obama's magnificent playbook. Tolkienesque says one reviewer, best read 2015 says another. see media manipulative mistress. doubt Obama plan. acknowledged one. Trump's team despite claims. truth Corona spreading US far earlier thought telling west keep travel trade open help. telling us month late proof virus spread person person. political speak scientific definitive use commonly misunderstood medical terms confused public lockdown exhaustion brought end. Everyone wanted McDs. Everyone wanted goto beach tan butts. media much responsible mess anyone inflamitory broadcasting baiting public.. erroniously report Asymptomatic people can't spread corona said so. Meanwhile Asymptomatic Presymptomatic thing. average Joe know this. 

As falling international bodies.The really drop ball pandering China. Keep planes coming out. Whats worst could happen? Ofc reactionary president going stop paying saves US money puts blame squarely eggheads misunderstood truth telling criticized propaganda they're helping.. good terms stop public staying home wearing masks. countries talked leadership manage economics country nobody right mind look answers. Yes many countries mandate must wear mask. Many shut businesses large crowds. even locked people buildings. think would fly USA? country god given right eat chicken flipping bucket washing gallon half sugar water.  concern him, all. Fucking psycho.  People make mistakes, look president example wish could upvote more, governors need realize choice public health economy. don‚Äôt control virus going get devastated.

The coming weeks very, painful reminder Utah removed ""it's working"" keep safe motto recently, fucking Mormons man much resistance small inconvenience. condoms invited today, maybe they‚Äôll wage civil war right wear condom. expert got caught manipulating numbers? experts states caught. nightmare people like exist, cover ears deny reality PEOPLE POLITICALLY AGREE CAN'T SPREAD VIRUS!

Stop fucking that. evil. okay even slightly. Fucking cut bullshit right now.

Right.

Fucking.

People like cannot exist. holding society back denying science supporting politics reality. Mess economy one 2 lives.. know many people die economy goes shit??? absolute break even point hit economy longer sustainable deaths Covid overshadowed despair depression cause. don‚Äôt know point find soon. Testing much harder toc ome back though. defending actions New York likely significantly harder hit shut numbers showed. Within country club contact tracing across members. Nobody wants guy causes outbreak

This entire thread thought idiot. Now? Douchebag.  Send link friend, I‚Äôll happily send donation cause fucked thing money would ended corporations anyway spent. It‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt end right away. That‚Äôs good enough though, guess. protests going three weeks now, states cities started opening since last week. spike numbers attributed people participated protests ignored stay home orders. Good, good. way said Americans wear masks Dr Fauci said Americans need them, uncle might right.   Good point. Defund immediately. hire new people literal thugs. Half wants scream 'Don't say warn you' half wants scream Donald Trump. Everyone knows. every news outlet. can't happy Boston? thought ""keep America great"" everyone Tulsa holding make Americans great signs confused. downsize business significantly already. 5 years building gone. 
I got $1200 plus another $1800 unemployment back pay. received week went back work (essential hair stylist). got 3 letters day. One saying qualified $100 /wk, second denial, third letter said owed $600 overpayment. 
Now barely clients one wants come really space clean like mad woman between. 
I‚Äôm completely fucked. appreciate willing admit wrong, that's lot people Might attend wedding soon afraid catching virus. wish small wedding heard around 50 guests. go definitely wear mask social distance, honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs great idea even go. Anyone else weddings since coronavirus started? Idiot. Ok, removed part moron.

Your suggestion ""this fault black lives matter"" kind pissed :) ""HEALTH NEWSMAY 26, 2020 / 6:21 / MONTH AGO""

Thanks fucking retard, one month old post LMAO Probably best time go backwards. Lmao People going back work crowd around large groups literally thousands, screaming top lungs. families young children would want risk everyone getting sick.

Eh sure. Pretty sure Universal hit 50% capacity limit numerous occasions. Boggles mind still so-called nati onal l eader said stuff TV. mention fatality rate new reported cases much less original CFR since early on, virus mostly hitting older vulnerable people.

The recent climb cases partly due people getting comfortable routine doctor appointments getting tested, well many locales drive-up (and free people) testing. young people CFR multiple times less older population.

I surprised wave young people drives known CFR quite bit current CDC projection .26%. Well done Flat-earthers same, UFO obsessives, list goes on. Day late dollar short dipshit. least part kids safe death complication. USA #1 USA #1 wtf, nukes targeted civilians Boston... continue rise states. Right also reopened. know supposed kind gotcha doesn‚Äôt help guys don‚Äôt even take seriously first place it‚Äôs obvious you‚Äôre doing. No, number people recycling air even significant masks. spikes come pretty consistently 2 3 weeks event. you‚Äôre wishing for? Wow likely. No. Please reopen schools. Safety priority. Rest follow Well, well, well...would look that. actions consequences. would thought? Yes disaster. Maybe protesters worm masks (many not) kept six feet distance 

Or better yet: Stay home protest virtually (facebook, twitter, instagram, letters Governors/ mayors). Right also reopened. know supposed kind gotcha doesn‚Äôt help guys don‚Äôt even take seriously eh first place it‚Äôs obvious you‚Äôre doing. would reasonable explanation. However current operating procedure Florida currently? know initially US policy test sparingly. However, understanding least anyone exhibits initial symptoms encouraged get tested right away rather waiting dyspnea.

I find hard believe majority current tests done people well disease suffering dyspnea would make average daily positive rate baffling would imply 90% people tested severely ill something else would surely know widespread causing symptoms similar severe cases coronavirus.  1% unmasked infectious people lot damage everyone around normal masks protect getting infected, help prevent infecting others. people complaint protesting ... cares time get show going ppl recover ppl well üôèüèΩ Thank Fair enough, said ""some workplaces."" I've seen amongst many people know, thinking skewed toward common. Right? dipshit would complain something ending pandemic. Ridiculous  Gotcha True

Some want see justice others care less long got their's. rIGhT BrEatHe

Okay, enjoy never breathing caught COVID another idiot avoided masks. unquestionably risky deploy vaccine millions people 3-4 months testing. scientists developing would probably agree, would never suggest normal circumstances. simply can't know safe without long-term testing. also enormous pressure approve limited information. FDA buckled Trump's pressure approve hydroxychloroquine, let's pretend politics factor. I‚Äôm scared testing catching less severe symptoms deaths matching cases right now. hospital capacity increasing even though cases risen hospitalization does. match severity median age way down. tell full two week lad 14 days extreme cases lagging far, hospitals would need severe surge capacity, happening right now. Everything political China, reports coronavirus death tolls public officials ‚Äúspeculating‚Äù virus originating Italy America. it‚Äôs big deal Trump likes make it, Chinese officials delayed initial reports virus political implications.  agree. child always questioned authority. know better believe  don‚Äôt understand previous comment NPR good article NYC daycare low rates covid infection. gives hope elementary schools, maybe middle. 
The problem teachers might want exposed. developing thing. 
Personally, I'm thinking labor day schools. ignore idiots, go away.

We knew that, fed trolls anyways. people jobs? then? Plenty us deleted years ago. Life better without it. agree, second wave coming, it‚Äôs going get really bad please shut up. Leftist people Reddit usually talk incessantly privilege etc. giving someone platform spew every half baked opinion person rich money seen Brits Europe yet take it.

The US... unless person lives one hardest hit states early on, forget testing.

Now, came back bit hard, waking lots people CoV infection spread.

It way.

In New England, basically widespread testing. Forget states like NH. Unless literally showed signs infection, doctor give referral CoV testing health insurance carrier cover either. What?

That's huge (and great!) thing. 

Also:

""Six animals received investigational vaccine 28 days infected SARS-CoV-2 compared three control animals receive vaccine. vaccinated animals showed signs virus replication lungs, significantly lower levels respiratory disease lung damage compared control animals.""

All monkeys vaccinated received *ridiculous* levels COVID exposure fine.

America one places leader actively caters low-education types even misinformation. mystifying. see word ""Cincinnati"" map?  that's Cincinnati is...roughly 20 miles away placing it. Downtown Cinti maybe fifteen minutes away airport. went downtown Miamitown (which claiming downtown Cincinnati drawing), Indiana, airport, would take maybe extra hour top that.

Here's actual fun fact though, swath land west side downtown expressway, fastest way airport boat. Cincinnati still functioning riverboat ferry shuttle cars across river get airport.

Be kind. calm. safe. protests didnt help either chinese/japanese documentary coronavirus situation wuhan, english subtitles. Please elaborate reason removal think need take deep breath, man. Good job, Malaysia! Meanwhile Philippines... I‚Äôll raise you, 13th July number. say (news heads several times places last months) 9-10 days either make it, plummet. 4th July like Stand Stephen King. lab juices getting first split like hell over. within days 99%+ world pop died. Anyway, point is, plug Stand. Longer better Bible. also, 9 days July 4th 13th. and, frankly, I‚Äôm spit ballin think big problem we‚Äôre seeing scientific method played real time public setting, guess one paid attention works. makes uncertainty changes look like kind conspiracy average person doesn‚Äôt seem understand scientific consensus works. 
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fault teachers, though. society whole become pretty shallow design. things locked down, kept thinking, bars nightclubs ever open again? Packed people drinking much less chance care safety. truth places can't open safely vaccine. sure open, going keep spread going. Imagine sports, bars fall. Could reality wonder would make sense give people much smaller fines ($20-$50), hand consistently, give mask person gets fine. LOL might best quotes I've heard yet. Utterly insane. Yeah could be. I've once, bit like that. little fishing town, different.  Hey wanted get peoples opinion. carry mask around case go stores can‚Äôt properly social distance. 

If I‚Äôm park don‚Äôt wear mask maintain distance people. riding bike work don‚Äôt wear mask either.

Thanks recognition. I'm BC Cancouver Island. first confirmed case 6 weeks. well. stayed family mainland 6 weeks, felt like things taken pretty seriously too.

Be kind. calm. safe. Premature? It‚Äôs two months downward sloping curve. week ago less deaths we‚Äôve since March. It‚Äôs common fact that‚Äôs discussed CDC, Fauci Stanford past two weeks. Ah, cases. Gotcha. around July 8th makes sense. God hope not. Mask on, cautious damn, try optimistic. would rather risk covid take vaccine rushed properly tested Speculative fearmongering. Antibodies may fade 2-3 months infection even know inmune memory? study didn‚Äôt even say antibodies disappear 2-3 months, fade individuals. 
Your body create new antibodies case new contact virus thanks inmune memory. 

And btw you‚Äôre saying totally happened 1918. Influenza viruses mutate higher rate coronaviruses. Marginally better access.

""In 2016,¬†Bloomberg News¬†ranked Iran 30th efficient healthcare system ahead United States Brazil."" Georgian here, work general public wear mask work customers come tell don‚Äôt believe them. one yesterday tell big joke. idiots real here.  agree low chance dying. don‚Äôt age data USA whole, assume new cases young people, don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see huge spike deaths like April. think protests needless? Ok bud Taiwan new domestic case about, 2 months, it‚Äôs like looking different dimension reading news. Read article. Outside mentioning lower death rate, it‚Äôs doomeresque. surprised protesting tbh Wake October ends mean it‚Äôs going cause unintentional social distancing since one want fly them. India suffering due head sand policies people per capita

Hmm...  Americans reeeeeally fucking really concerned, /r/stopdrinking great tips  Well damn pathetic POS like idiot gov Texas. 11.5% extremely low credit card Dude, Brazil shit ton reporting. second populous state, example, multiplied number deaths respiratory complications. count COVID. trying argue person good. bother?

And best could argument ""You dont spend every waking second helping others, therefore hypocrite somehow."" Oh please. Correlation causation. mean eating restaurant causes Covid-19. example, imagine people places eating less careful general, places course restaurant eating prevalent. places locked-down nobody eating out. directly mean ""going restaurant causes Covid-19."" doesn‚Äôt actully mean people getting infected-even though are. means access testing. said sounds like I‚Äôm rooting biggest number? 

Can link this? Herd immunity needs 60-70% population immunity order work, would equal 215 million Americans. infect 1.5 million people per week immunity permanent, would take *3 years* reach herd immunity USA. Assuming 1% mortality rate, also comes 2.15 million deaths.

Herd immunity viable strategy unless driven large-scale, global delivery effective vaccine. let wealthy business owner president panic country reopening wrong way. FTFY read article? paint new outbreaks good light. ""We live society"" - comment section  Thank god clear documentation protests people can't pretend responsible spike Every state protests. FL/AZ/TX big problems right now.

Seems like reopening rather anything else. agree are. responding specific question. 

Are flying doctors help NY? would think would logical seen anything news. Trump playing roulette everyone's granny. Since infection related probability, measures reduce spread degree.
Ofcourse measures strict enough, effect also high.
Bit suggested, low impact measured, fire go out. use iOS Android device, privacy's already compromised.
I trust CCC authority area. say app untraceale believe them.


Think another way: 
Imagine going shopping local supermarket person coronavirus also shopping supermarket. imagine person wearing masks properly infect you.

With working contact tracing app could aware possible infection symptoms begin manifest self-quarantine.

Without app, probably develop symptoms point there'll period time infectious know could unknowingly infect kill friends, parents, grandparents, friendly neighbour stranger supermarket.



The choice course opinion benefits possibility saving lifes outweighs potential lingering concerns huge margin. expect? USA open? Lockdown?
I saw people protesting? happening US? sorry, US new case rate hit bottom June 9 started increasing. US follows 2nd spike pattern similar Iran delay rise new cases new deaths could month. Though many examples happens second spike. Estonia started opening month ago infections risen time, applies countries region took seriously. enemies USA laughing Ass of. distort American society posting memes Facebook. single bullet fired. time American economy weak hostile take many american companies way easier. Also, iirc doesn‚Äôt take 2 weeks incubate? person probably contracted corona rally. hope ‚Äúgoggles‚Äù isn‚Äôt slang testicles. Didn‚Äôt actually happen Michigan last month, TWO dams. Ugh. Melbourne area, R number 2.5 moment. Usa
Brazil

Top 4 countries.


China virus originated lower.  nursing classes fall impossible, testing online actually easier. 

I'm kinda that. listening computer developer advise us epidemic?
Just rename CDC bill fucking gates top that, look death new case ratio beginning May/end April first peak see something changed. Pure numbers, panic politics. Something changed...who affected, deadliness virus, better treatment. Could make coherent argument instead personal insult?

The fact right. 

If infections increasing won‚Äôt know get admitted hospital two weeks time. Meanwhile we‚Äôd think it‚Äôs increased testing. Personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs increasing, can‚Äôt say sure right now. 

What say sure infection rate incredibly high compared neighbors European countries. 

Sweden finds 40 times infected per test (12% tests) Denmark (0,3% tests). viruses bacteria live surfaces, long don‚Äôt touch face wash hands handling packages it‚Äôs fine. Wiping packets spraying unlikely even effective it‚Äôs cleaning long enough even kill virus Majority Americans dumb Good you! America never learns lmao read somewhere vitamins useful balanced meal Putting lightly. It‚Äôs bad people told do. able figure news. months now, reported places follow guidelines decrease cases. like 10th time..wtf trying prove? saying protest effect? necessary btw. Get facts straight bud act like Trump speak single word another language. Hello peak covid cases, old friend still buy alcohol restaurants, even go places still, lots emphasis please fucking leave eat home appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* would constantly question work epidemiologists, virologists, medical experts.

[Like Sometimes worry Trump dictator making. Sieze power, rally troops, ready self point amateur armies. Maybe issue face masks individual enough. something like like countless sellers Etsy make, might good idea so-called medical-political science going since early year. Protect coronavirus fellow redditors. Looks like usa needs stupid riots! Don‚Äôt mind me. want username history books someday. Late, can't wait antivaxxers use justify position. Like, they're going use indoctrinate people movement. I'm sorry. Let reword argument. 

My point United States really bad matter metric look at. Pointing lower deaths per capita compared UK Italy distracts important issue. Yes, US absolute worst certain metrics. what? They're still badly. ""but they're really bad"". No, United States awful, everyone country needs cautious.

 I'm sorry I'm sounding alarmist, family doctors Arizona stretched thin worried what'll hospitals surge capacity couple weeks. They're getting sick people using current lower death rate way prove virus bad scientists doctors making be. 

I know trying hopeful optimistic, personally see optimism good thing going come bite us end. Looking lower death rate right seems premature. one government (fed, state local) knows wtf doing...I'm government health field...Trust me.. We're fucked...Unless actually get help advice eastern world parts Europe. intelligence high confidence

Next time want cite evidence, remember least learn read

Ciao wait long?  County must kept content now. get coming from, difference countries we're using comparison. people country (but all) better people developing countries. think comparing countries. We're global superpower huge GDP amazing resources disposal, comparing developed countries similar resources power. we're compared countries, fall woefully short. one * slow cap * actually don‚Äôt mean [this best discussion I've seen apparently 1918 1919 Federal government took authority, opposed courts, though [Anti-Mask care!!!!!! Sure, hour ago sent robocalls telling employees need return work considered resigned. Well least getting conversation started.   Besides fact people talk it, say?

Look Table 3 take scenario match workplace contact ""close contacts"" multiply percentage risk ""Household Secondary Attack Rate"". shy 50,000 cases day. Amazing. starting feel like computer virus set loose end Wreck-It Ralph 2. You‚Äôre also forgetting MANY people without health issues still die coronavirus despite hospitalized. It‚Äôs less likely health issues. Even then, healthy people EQUALLY LIKELY contract virus spread it, even won‚Äôt die it. viewpoint shortsighted. like idea compromise: everyone gets right 1 vote baseline, earn additional votes certain exceptional achievements (i.e. getting master's degree earns one extra, doctors PhDs get three extra, major humanitarian contributions similar could net 5 so). way nobody completely disenfranchised, time, people whose opinions *genuinely* carry weight simply drowned out. I‚Äôm asking question lol. Everyone sub defensive.. Idgaf means soon sure getting voted. can't really rush medical testing. Honestly still scam unnaceptable but........

......i hard time feeling sympathy anyone bought tickets.... Beautifully said. get decision paralysis confronted onslaught information, default ""What feels right,"" usually confirms personal biases. whats going funny final straw turn state red. watch fast libs 180 abolishing electoral college. Um sure? I'm pretty sure bar street open.. Lol poor baby doesn‚Äôt wanna say cuz kills argument.

Have good night loser going eat. need haircuts. need nails done. need able go binge drink bars stumble drunkenly Wal-mart without constraints mask. freedoms owe anything society live in. /s beginning real collapse starting seen- optimism printing money kept wheels while. 

The fact this- 20 million people unemployed now, lost extra stimulus next wave lockdowns going shut economy August September. service entertainment economy dead. going full speed massive recession plan government run ostriches cowards. never minute life thought supporting Trump, saw very, right-wing politician similar weirdo leaders around world (like Italy's Silvio Berlusconi South Africa's Jacob Zuma).

But man, I've realized year Trump far worse them, Trump sucks everything. fucking clue he's doing, think there's single thing good at. can't even make dumb punchlines anymore.  pisses even loyal political allies. Sean Hannity looked like wanted shoot last night Trump stumbling softball interview questions. guess doomed lol.  virus back April. come try positive virus yeah suppose math wrong.  I'm fine, wife fine. likely fine well get it. I'm argue. trying put forth better numbers wrong.  Take care got $88 ticket day forgetting move car weekly street sweeping. 

So yes, expect enforce law protect people deadly virus global pandemic someone wear piece cloth. Brothers stupid arms friend Even Satan wanted help Maryland taking deserving ass underworld early. positivity trend going weeks ago, didn‚Äôt briefing then? wait outbreak got hand? task force joke. involved reputations thrown gutter said done. I‚Äôm serious. includes Fauci Birx. failed jobs even intentions right. what? virus spreads that. three week lockdown going anything. We‚Äôd place 3 weeks that. Let healthy people get infected protect vulnerable population bad tomorrow be? Tuesday? guys need chill. Bad adverse affects rare age group. going stay inside rest life? didnt I... want this.   get idea kids transmit virus others? recent source supports assertion?

I mean, kids people. get virus. get sick virus, even die virus. seems logical reason assume magical shed corona viruses like shed viruses. I'd really interested assertions proven wrong. Look numbers. Bars open cases aren‚Äôt going New York people still taking precautions. That‚Äôs truth. US needs consider ""flooding system testing,"" Fauci says 

Or, exact opposite President tells us do... What? 20 million people covid 175k died covid means death rate .8%. 

Currently reported death rate would around 5%. think people suffering mental health feel like absolutely need go vacation Florida so, also take extra precautions social distancing obedient wearing masks indoors beach.

I think really bad take. understand anxiety depression - mine sucks pandemic, easily 10x worse now. going vacation COVID hotspot asinine... enough people giving shit wearing masks social distancing even beach think joining ranks way okay?

If people need take 'vacation', go trusted friend's house - someone know left house, either. take drive country nature preserve take sunshine. 

Anything heading Florida virus 100% uncontained. Like, happens hurt vacation here? go? ER, full sick highly contagious individuals? beds quickly dwindling? staff treating highly contagious individuals day? 

No, ""go vacation"" right now. they're lucky enough state even somewhat control, stay find better way. options take care mental health without going beach vacation... like, rest us plebs figure every day lol. moved FL last year - nowhere near beach 30 years that. We're 27th education...so, makes sense idiots wear masks. Florida U.S. ""hold beer"" ‚Äúused like pawns‚Äù. BLM protesters wearing masks. there‚Äôs proof new cases linked protests, would reported, haven‚Äôt seen conclusive evidence yet.

In fact, fact hasn‚Äôt spike cases northeast, still locked many protests, suggests protests might reason spike. honestly think reddit wants continue excuse nothing day still feel good it.

They want things return ""normal"" all. 1.5 Nagasakis, 30 9/11s one Nagasaki    Everyday there's national lockdown, two weeks that. would tell you?

You proven incapable basic reading comprehension. Perhaps review grade school english math material least **pretend** know discussing. answer. thing funds pushing wait vaccine narrative quite time. saying bigger threat nukes quite time. insanely undemocratic unchosen technocratic businessman fueling organization handles crisis detrimental civil liberties. wield immense potential influence people's livelyhoods happiness. crisis governments subservient says people like choice really want live life social recluse virus deadly advertised. Bill Gates vocal country's rescind people's freedom take great threat. kind laying low guess Zweden crucified adhering divine recommendations right it.

Until turned really deadly economic devastation, lonelyness detrimental way living lot people measures taken virus, deemed detrimental initial threat virus.

&amp;#x200B;

People ask government please act like democracy stop catering international organization judicial democratic oversight. could please decide effort taken fight coronavirus proportional threat.

&amp;#x200B;

Bill Gates continuously praising acting like Trump great evil staying silent China issue basically showed everyone really care civil liberties, choice, democracy.

To feels like Bill Gates mainly wants name marked history. really care people much condemned lockdowns third world countries lead massive famine.

I vote man, want functioning democracy proportional consideration human rights. prefer faceless technocratic organization oversight intrudes liberties without considerations want, happiness derive normal way living.

The thing seemed measure whether die virus, statistic them. somebody enjoys life denounces absolute risk minimization means enjoy life anymore. Everybody dies. everybody lives. 

The threat covid live. Saving lives mean make half population miserable show kept handful people alive 5 years.

I care Bill Gates likes stay inside day read newspapers, I'd like say deem proportional normal. ""Listen experts"" devolved ""shut pie hole know best you"".

But don't. Even grandmother bigger risk tolerance Bill Gates apparently.

He feels needs charge choice people lives back international organization.

Many people feel unnecessarily praised China lies, believe correct. Texas. states common? eastern half refers areas coast; generally conservative populous areas, generally along coastline. There‚Äôs groin speculation whether COVID-19 coronavirus affect testicles. That‚Äôs¬†your¬†testicles them, and¬†those¬†testicles referring someone else‚Äôs. However, study peer reviewed.  that's true, apply enforce endangering others freaking global pandemic? Playing devils advocate here.


All countries still significant restrictions. mona lisa Eiffel tower mentioned open, bunch things like masks, limited number capacity, temperature checks, slow things down.


If get everybody infected quickly possible, reopen without masks without limited capacity. become economic powerhouse compared rest world fully open without restrictions.


Also, virus targets people drain economy (retired folks). people consume without providing value add. imagine huge influx retirement savings (of dead people) taken savings moved spending home purchases.


We may come healthier financially wealthy nation.





Of course millions died.

Chill fuck out, we'll fine, virus scary. Stop shitting pants nothing, embarrassing point California like 3 states one tho.. would suggest least one gun start stocking canned food now.

This surprise you? couldn‚Äôt Fair enough. agree you. Though TN translucent. likely accounting error. saw newspaper refused publish many details TN open. guess right. Though still ridiculous government. can, would better, I'm still skeptical virus communicable kudos 10 under.

The best model would probably something like schools remote learning, schools monitored classrooms open kids cannot stay home, teacher still lessons online classes monitored staff clerks volunteer emphasis young recovered patients monitors.

You could feasibley even make online classes larger use teachers without online class monitor assist students cannot stay home. also allow social distancing within physical classroom since kids home. Number 1 Country political, wearing mask simple wearing hat, glasses even uniform. It‚Äôs big deal people make one think elections rigged. Elections rigged. like pandemic artificial. Yeah literally hundreds thousands people start dying daily difficult state government keep covering up. Fudging numbers longer makes look better, 1200 1400 deaths Bad News. coming. sounds illegal lol think good time point fonder ReOpen Maryland (a 53 year old diabetic history ""mini-strokes"") recently tested positive.

And part might get tired winning. We're gonna win deaths. We're America... We're number one... we're gonna get tired winning try go quarantine itll late... We'll already won.

Tl;Dr I'm drunk rambleings... 93 days! Holy shit, Marco‚Äôs pandemic Canadian here, saw too. 380 greater 7 day mean, isnt it? Shit.  think it‚Äôs better look individual state data.

New York State peaked April 550 cases/1m people. Arizona 400 cases/1m people track double roughly every week current pace continues. 

In April, New York testing rate 800/1m per day. Today Arizona testing rate 1600/1m per day. 2x much New York‚Äôs peak.

So naively you‚Äôd assume NY testing 2x rate back April, would peaked around 1100 cases/1m per day. means AZ similar case rate less two weeks continued growth. It‚Äôs little reassuring.

I took figures 91-divoc.com. could done everything 100% right books get go, would sitting posting mad actions

Do think everything 100% right?

If not, percentage ok criticize him? fruit protests. Lol.

Kinda ironic think hundreds thousands dead inaction despite abundance action. Grim reaper background yelling ""Requires forced testing"" anywhere description technology.

You technology many ways. use congregate facilities mentioned. ideal get 100% compliance? Yes. necessary helpful? No. 

Batch testing 10, 20, 50 people require forcibly testing anyone. creative species, figure paths work us nothing. There's often several paths.

You‚Äôll pull through, country gotten worse times rolling eyes many people Yeah don‚Äôt see anything article hadn‚Äôt already announced week ago. Dept Labor still predicting 25% unemployment end year, Economics studies show 40,000 deaths per 1% unemployment, that‚Äôs estimated

1,000,000 deaths caused joblessness (due shutdowns). That's true, watch inbox comment alter repost Auto-Mod involved.

I know mods, got really strange warning weeks ago - lol. slow fire spreads becomes raging fire storm like.  Vote Biden 2020 Idiots hometown want wear masks. think virus fake. really sucks. would try wear mask much possible. Don‚Äôt make big deal it. Family (dad) probably make fun etc. keep on. Tell feel safer wear appropriate. Agreed, certainly logical piece puzzle, deaths decreasing long released wild back late May demographics skewed much older now. Every model predicted deaths even protests/release it‚Äôs happening reason. have. last comment removed calling idiot shitcunt fine guess Thank educating me, fixed edit above. Jesus fucking christ point probably cheaper come test Mexico lol Blaze Nope. Yup. There's saying statistics ""All models wrong, useful"" (like making policy decision).

So policy maker reading study model, see included factors methods section reasonably accurate, focus much exact numbers (because almost definitely wrong), consider change variable (masks/no masks) made see masks make inarguable effective improvement little risk negative effects. decide masks high value, net positive solution implemented immediately. 


Even everyone wore shitty masks, would cut transmission ~65%: 
""Considering fixed transmission rate, 80% adoption 20%, 50%, 80% effective masks reduces cumulative relative (absolute) mortality 65% (22,262), 91% (31,157), 95% (32,529)."" surgical masks homemade surgical equivalent (polypropylene non-woven), we're closer 90%: 
""The authors found N95 respirators filtered 97% test aerosol surgical masks almost well, filtering 95% aerosol."" opinion, narrative always masks protect YOU, that's true, even selfish people might jumped board. vary significantly based upon stage infection person underlying health condition is. many things link, basic premise early days, doctors shooting blindly barrel - refined protocols treat virus early calm immune response later stages. beginning infection, drugs bolster immune system anti-virals slow infection. infection progresses, different drugs prevent cytokine storm.  horror  That‚Äôs good reason. know Norwegian people. Norway must exist! Ya deleted indiscriminantly gave specifics worked, erased specifics...and rewrote specifics deleted follow post like dick.


But anyway,this even bet, toldyaso. better care management vulnerable, along low chance death, see big jump new deaths

Are going tell think avg gonna be, no? government really going sit people go homeless hungry pandemic? failed leadership?

Yes. Utter morons, stay inside another couple months... tp...I still question till today. watch video, mentions ‚Äúthe mark beast‚Äù says forced vaccinations, makes sound even nutty. Nobody learn anything. people everywhere world stupid, that's leaders take decisions us. civilized world law made force that's exactly happened masks social distancing. 

The people refuse wear masks protect others stupid always stupid. give big ass fines lock force. 

But see leaders democratic country chosen people people uneducated dumb, course leadership dumb well. That's America needs proper education everywhere country selective elite go Harvard similar places. Texas..... California Nevada suddenly wokeup &amp; mandated masks (too late). end humanity. Spanish Flu 1918 killed way people life continued. However, knowledge now, shameful using save many lives can. mean England. Leave Scotland this. new cases per day single figures. heard anything them.. mention it, that's WEIRD. Maybe they're sitting back enjoying show.

""Poor us"" think it‚Äôs obvious increase cases facial coverings separation parameters insufficient measures. Downvote want CDC needs realize cases going increase lack proper measures taken. Hazmat suits complete protection virus. So, disagree end, point proven. think it‚Äôs impossible contain shit. may end living it. Actually nobody wears damned mask know. think saved 2 things. 

1. MN active cases never 6,000
2. Coronavirus apparently really lousy spreading outdoors.

I think spreads public transportation doorknobs, neither issue riots. nice sino-boner UK 67 million people

US 330 million people

USA five times many people UK

USA 43 times many new cases UK

The deaths USA lot deaths EU We'rE TesTinG!! large number people getting sick bad economy. need money tackle virus need tackle virus continue making money. get choose two.  people voted Bush WMDs trump voters. Also Florida reporting accurate numbers. alleged decreasing numbers one ex employee true? taken seriously, still understand every top executive fired yet. literally saw someone Texas post FB need refer masks correct names ‚Äúface diapers‚Äù lol Fair. forget sometimes. Hopefully migration old fuckers dying turn state blue soon. right early can't tell every effect may long term permanent. might early enough data, especially thoroughly collected far... 

But things clearly permanent. causes scarring kind, know already irreversible.

Would love know centralized place trying collect kind data begin draw approximations incidence effects. thread starting unravel, people waking protesters factor this? sub coronavirus deniers. either believe virus easy people spread don't. Trying solve via handout first mistake. should‚Äôve supported salaries businesses affected. Ie take payments. unemployment, lower overall cost (presumably) businesses didn‚Äôt compete PPP - stipulations middlemen - large corporations. stayed closed longer. honestly support use nat'l guard keep people inside, unfortunately constitutional right morons care anyone else's safety, theirs. Replied wrong person! vote deranged glow stick first time! think people like him/Trump narcissistic actually delude culpability. I‚Äôm sure tell elves something like:

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt fault. right things made right decision using information time. Anybody else situation would done same. fact, people would probably made worse decisions. Nobody could prevented this, it‚Äôs people Texas ones exercising proper precautions recommended. told careful, chose be.‚Äù Worst part cant even say without accused cause. 

It's plainly obvious. collection people altogether -whether cops huddled together protesters walking close together- gonna look good covid numbers.

Do current numbers indicate recent spikes fault protests mostly hasty re-openings? No. need wait data catch up. see effects later though. 

Now time get political public health. Nobody bashing importance awareness crucial need reform US. makes skin crawl anyone even mentioning ""maybe collecting together large numbers isnt best thing right rethink safely accomplish goal"" results labeled many hurtful names. mean first state get hit really hard surprise people cautious keep thinking. Decline empire used possible seems inexplicably impossible. us. us sane people voted prick caught crossfire. America: 33? people die flu. expect taken13 seconds put one small piece cloth leave house?

What happened? when? seems sudden. ri4  santorini last year. meet single American difference 6% 7% change sentiment said?  mean people paid attention virus knew coming. many doctors said stop reopening quickly. 

People ignored, look are. Bill Teds 3 soon... ink source figures? makes believe millions people protesting past couple weeks ‚Äúleftists‚Äù? tell statement objectively untrue, don‚Äôt least see strange tribalism one side vs thinking? It‚Äôs making everything worse America exist absurd me. fight island crock shit. Dana's big fat liar, always. There's something going on. sub hysteria driven politically charged.

Got alert today people gathering live contracted it. left house handful times, one wearing damn mask. huge joke everyone. Governor scoots rag tag team legs, convinced everyone big liberal conspiracy something worry about. Corona 2, flu boogaloo hitting, everyone asking ""oh could happened?!"" 

The people much fault is. Specifically, people purposefully breaking quarantine sign ""freedom"". 

If make alive, I'm leaving state. experience, people give single fuck anyone themselves. get hit, sudden world needs stop needs. 

Also, protesting right fucking stupid. cause right, RIGHT NOW, dumb going hurt LOT people.

This place great standard do. may solid economy, price that. Human resource grinder. ~~masks~~ empathy believe that's whataboutism, wumao's that. dense. cases go result deaths going up. Logic 101.

Thats right. keep touching mask, basically wearing one see it. :) See guys tomorrow headline See next week. least number lower weekends. isn‚Äôt issue.

Therefore textbooks dinosaurs standing next humans.‚Äù We‚Äôve dealing time, it‚Äôs usually ridiculous symbolic issues rather mortal threat.

Because science always telling worldview wrong, they‚Äôre biased findings. we‚Äôve learned virus spreads, guidelines necessarily changed things like mask-wearing, surface transmission, etc. people inside closed loop, means scientists can‚Äôt get story straight shouldn‚Äôt trusted. It‚Äôs also helping indoor church services really dangerous, feel like government make anything stifle religious freedom, church leaders want collection plate revenue, so...

Science teachers didn‚Äôt fail. Religious leaders did. possibly say record number new cases? Like seriously, aware death case numbers? I‚Äôm genuinely curious That's thinking aswell. Pull list base stations around market, access log base station list people needs testing ageing population. virus ‚Äúdone rounds‚Äù vulnerable, there‚Äôs finite amount people infected serious risk dying.

I've seen fear mongering reddit before, pretty extreme well 100F AZ day, yet keep breaking records cases reported every day. remember first started summer better heat... yeaaahhhh... Yeah that‚Äôs biggest spikes DC New York. Oh wait... cities largest protests declining case counts.

Coronavirus spread effectively indoor spaces people wearing masks. problem lack mask wearing overcrowded indoor spaces due mismanaged reopening. 107 heat index part FL yesterday. sat yard dogs.. lasted 2 min. aren‚Äôt going outside much days. Good! Well shit, I'm wondering call missed (my phone mute) random number another spam phone call something useful  still appears incredibly unlikely lab origin COVID-19. Also peer-reviewed study, probably wait legitimate peer reviewed study approved major journal references possibility lab origin. right now, anything close that. legitimate evidence peer reviewed, stop trying push narrative, creates hysteria environment conducive racism nationalism, something definitely want deal pandemic (more already case certain countries). I'd worry going restaurant still say polarization lack critical thinking prevalent without Fox GOP. would still anti-vaxxers conspiracy theorists, different. president United States basically saying masks precautions unnecessary. media side ran that, still really know why, started snowball effect. also many lives could saved everyone wore masks beginning.

The CDC lied us saying masks ineffective. needed time secure supplies wanted avoid panic buying frenzy masses. purposeful lack prepared screwed us over. believe they're 1%

Uhhh isnt lot?

We told deathrate Covid 1% shut entire country. 1% lot youre dealing millions people. Study shows 45 per cent decrease mortality rate took Statins, used treat novel coronavirus, associated lower death rate lower rate medical ventilation, according study published Cell Statins, used primarily lower cholesterol, known slow progression lung injury animals, improve immune response reduce inflammation. three symptoms common Covid-19 patients suffer acute problems, often resulting fatal organ study, conducted Hubei province, China, examined use statins sample size 13,981 patients. revealed 45 per cent decrease mortality rate assigned medication. Fuck ya merica probaby contact tracing leading protest spreading bars restaurants causing it. That's one yeah :) take agreeing me? study also also based droplet transmission flu. proven flu transmitted aerosol NIH Guinea Pig Study saying homemade masks barely effective droplets means zero effectiveness aerosol commonly 4 microns pass daily cotton. something transmitted via aerosol likelihood droplet transmission massively less requires droplet projected nose mouth.

Naming generations needs stop. productive. guess generation one name itself? Greatest Generation. that. Ok will. keeps distance gets tested regulary. Im assuming secret service catch does..... Combine fact want someone told to. individualistic rights denied authority figure that's WRONG.

Social distancing ya moron received email today kids' daycare, teacher child tested positive earlier week. excerpt pasted below, said Florida Dept Health discourages testing, test show results testee sympotmatic yet. true? FL DOH trying deflate numbers? would think want test everybody prevent testing, stated get children tested unless symptoms, would start day 6-8 last day exposure. symptoms day 10 (July 3rd) want see positive asymptomatic, go get tested. get tested now, could false negative virus hasn‚Äôt adapted enough show test. There's *single* method Vietnam used contain it. extensive contact tracing (up fifth layer contacts) strict, mostly localized, quarantining. constant communication public inform situation. rapid innovation realms locally-made fast-result testing kits. plus part coordinated effort stop virus. Canada right Less testing!

LESS TESTING, Florida!

/s did?

They shutdown banquet Wuhan though. mucous membranes lining entire esophagus. test virus back nose, assume area subject infection. watch Idiocracy morning too? really, ""There clear cases COVID-19 fomite transmission found literature. "" go describe possible cases nothing surface definitely culprit. Now, surface lead transmission really hard track, reasonably common seen least one confirmed case now. one possible case woman Wuhan thought might gotten infected delivered groceries since lived three people also possible one infected asymptomatically. Masks dont even save lives ""Florida"" ""Good decisions""...Nope. That‚Äôs good know! know reading hard, glad got money. mean know wtf taking about.

But carry spreading bullshit misinformation. actually makes complete sense qualify check governor piece shit guts city authority so. 
 
Looking you, Abbott. 90's counties started putting smoking policies restaurants, Abbot would say ""actually legal cities say so"" libs. joking aside- developing 1991? HTTP even officially released August 1991 HTML standardized 1993. early pages text links pages. think 1 4 people antivaxxers? That‚Äôs way high. I‚Äôm doubting true there‚Äôs whole lot thought. substantial evidence herd immunity. Italian lockdown prevented spread \*rest\* country, re-opening slow. elements referring to. Italy lockdown could leave village, US could fly Orlando Spokane. end result virus \*never reached\* area outside Lombardy. Again, herd immunity effect except maybe areas Lombardy. timing reopening also point, lasted like three months. Florida, Texas never really closed. Anybody bunker outside Wilseyville? better place NYC 30 percent positive ratio peak. Difference proactive measures reactive measures means mortality rate 10 times lower virus burns faster 

Not really. Deaths also lag case count likely reported deaths complications COVID causes unusually high compared previous years. already knew people walk around without symptoms, still spreading virus new reports say still get lung damage despite asymptomatic. wont know true number deaths quite sometime seems like much higher reported messaging 14 days [**2020-07-11 16:20:16 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-07-11%2016:20:16%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide Christians constantly threatened church leaders go hell good. yeah. Jail threats sounds right. Thanks response. honest question, don‚Äôt know downvoted. virus mutated form common cold. /s either save country simple mild inconvenience destroy country selfishness. Let's real - Parties Protests caused this. like coronavirus going spare based Beliefs. saw pictures videos protest - zero Social Distancing, wearing masks, others not. takes one person spread like wildfire situation like this. Yeah happens go bankrupt? it? simple easy simple answer, people latch time stress?

Another ""obvious"" conclusion could make NYC, large cities hit initial covid19 swells, intense lock downs residents took seriously. amount diseases spread protests low, leading spike.

Latching ""obvious"" conclusion without making effort critically think conclusions exactly need. Grow up. Silly question, keeping numbers low lately lockdown ended? lockdown hard enough (unlike, example, UK) much community transmission anymore? people freaked enough went social distancing masks mostly still happening? I'm there. confirm. Safe fuck. Yeah, guess what, right swing fist ends face. right free speech ends screaming 'Fire' crowded theater. right shoot gun ends start injuring killing people. freedom expression ends threaten harass others. question. 

Back early February came sub described seems like family COVID. told ridiculous. wrong. confirmed antibody tests.

My question is, may may know. Gay people MSMs banned donating blood. still apply even COVID? I‚Äôve tested HIV negative still doesn‚Äôt allow donate blood normal circumstances. homophobia still held well-being others even virus FDA? words, asshole, mean SHOULD. I've considering buying bunch masks passing local shopping center. I'm wealthy anything, high risk area one minority wear masks. DeWine Husted set testing location there. wear case glasses whole time. Problem solved. !remindme 2 weeks positivity rate tested NYC 3,500?

I think testing capacity increased since may bad initially seems. still bad exponential growth, UK peak 50% testing positive.

Do think Disney reopen? Idk cases rising much. Stay save Florida. Hopefully closing bars slow spread bit. Almost cultural shifts don‚Äôt happen night sometimes society needs time adjust forced something weren‚Äôt before. one surprised this, took nearly 5 years seatbelt laws enacted get wide spread participation expect masks become normal 3 months? It‚Äôs hard wear mask, that‚Äôs true, also isn‚Äôt hard put seatbelt still took time creatures habit don‚Äôt change easily. mentioned another thread people know epitome idiots causing spread say even individual people arguing put economy human lives... really appalling. think contact tracing bad thing? ignorance know bounds? Fucking babies US Supreme Court long since ruled police never obligation help enforce law. entirely discretion. kind big part whole defund police thing. don‚Äôt care people prisons cynical take. Incompetence may better reason. good idea glasses special coating. Like transition lenses UV filtering. Soap actually erase that.

That's alright idea glass reading glasses safety glasses coating Yep. problems. 

Have seen documentary, mean movie, Idiocracy? 1. don‚Äôt know. Florida, Texas Arizona, would expect deaths rise next weeks, three states greater proportion sick young, might infect parents, push several weeks. rest states mostly hanging there, bumping around 5% positive tests. 

2. don‚Äôt know. state decisions. Trump already said interest taking responsibility this. 50 states make decisions own. pop some, pass restrictions, calm down. they‚Äôll open up, virus come back, ad infinitum could triage people refuse wear masks, stay home social distance- honestly that, bet we‚Äôd get lot compliant people. it‚Äôs unheard (or unethical) medicine scarce resources - don‚Äôt give liver transplants people won‚Äôt stop boozing... decision making applied here. Biggest failures ass, natural selection always around, matter weather, new disease, can't stop things 6 billion people world. country god, dumb people like seem think perfection reality. want vaccine, one. put energy making America better rather finding fault president blaming could done things different. Wake tf up. remove anything literal bar stools. bars tables around it, every bar claiming sell food exempt closure. real nothingburger closure. ""Someone particular"". avoid auto-censor? getting rediculous. Yea, exact opposite happened. dig good stuff =/ 4x many deaths Texas per capita yesterday. forecast many random forecasts get next week? family members told deaths unfortunate outcome can't close economy. They're willing friends family get sick die economy. ""love"" get outbreaks. Meaning see patients coming in, contact trace discover oubreak. give ability take appropriate actions.

Before random people showing up, many speak ""outbreaks"", diffuse community spread. Brazil also planning opening schools students feel looking comparison, Italy might offer one here: 

 3 times population Florida, peak 6500 cases one day. http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1

As see peak deaths occured one month later peak cases. Yeah, pull glasses quarter half inch nose carry on. Geez, inconvenient! Yup! know unhealthy today help thinking people might come need. four hour run. buy guilt taking N95 away medical professional, R95s literally painting. Wearing masks protect others cold illness always thing Japan. imposition they've always done it. Good luck, man. bars Broadway packed people sandwiched like sardines, mask sight. I‚Äôve seen several Instagram Snapchat stories it‚Äôs scary. Interestingly, seems protests caused much spread. Places still social restrictions least partially lockdowns surging much, even protests happening. 

It's probably combination factors; many/most protestors wear masks, social distancing happening seems, outdoor environment limits transmission, especially day. 

The primary source seems people going inside buildings again. Restaurants, bars, etc.. Generally, virus spreads way faster efficiently recycled, shared air spaces. Even Denmark problem limit. They‚Äôve around 8-10. Boggles mind freezing rents unemployment high  ‚ÄúPositivity rates dropped .11% past 24 hours. Suckit news media. apology? Screw it, victory lap time!‚Äù

Amazing. putting people solitary good behavior? significant portion population immune (some claim Northern Italy could near 50%) Stupid protestors rioters. sensationalist? see ""first official case"" outbreak that's going months, feel reassured rare event maybe interesting study. Disney, Universal Studios, Legoland Busch Gardens wants reopen issue Annual Pass refunds. 

De$antis paid sacrifice constituents lives Theme Park money.

That's top usual pressure governor membership based organizations like churches, gyms etc.  Definitely low-hanging fruit foreign psyops. Vaccines cause autism ok... hit 50k next week, sooner. doubt! live scandinavia masks almost worn social distancing still observed despite lockdown anymore. 

Its far important. people also sense society. would suggest going back grow pair balls functional frontal lobe. guy gets I‚Äôm Michigan. lockdown stayed inside. reopened people acted like everything back normal. Plus lots cars state plates started showing vacation areas state. numbers headed again. I‚Äôm mad this. 

Fuck people. Although I'm midwest, might describing area, job. hit badly yet, will. people idiots. Stay safe. many levels  really is, seems like may figured better treat it, fewer people dying, seems like many survivors going long term complications even fairly mild cases. something anyone want, spreading like wildfire. Butbutbut involves giving stuff free poor people. /cynism Back March thing starting get traction Australia (new case numbers doubling every days) day high anxiety felt tsunami coming trying tell people felt like wasn‚Äôt taken seriously.

It‚Äôs heartbreaking see what‚Äôs happening USA right now. Please stay safe everyone. Good thing didn‚Äôt go Christmas earlier year... mention live age 24/7 surviellance, wearing mask, hiding identity help government? dumbest shit ever read. evidence ""masks really protect user catching virus someone else"". Common sense says would protect user well IMO. non-polarizing conspiracy, Jeffrey Epstein didn‚Äôt commit suicide. current mortality rate herd immunity would mean 10 million deaths US I'm interested really, honestly believe one working government posting here. seriously naiive believe that. think governments earth use propaganda???? Lol get check multil billion dollar business America making state thing really problem lacking national leadership.

By mean dipshit Trump worst fucking president. Taiwan people got worried ONE case two months new local cases. article   think like Chernobyl all. local party leaders asshats ignored science front them, Gorbachev made aware situation basically told ever felt necessary prevent disaster getting worse gave ever resources needed, ever cost, prevent worse case scenario. Even better, we‚Äôll recover wave, they‚Äôll AGAIN. viruses well. America yeahhhhh USA USA USA keep winning friends üëç countries there's possibility stupid ones made follow rules anyway. New York adult leadership. think fine truthful everyone respecting distance. doubt would start wearing mask outside park cuz see wearing one. Keeping good idea though. wear mask open park someone came close started talking I'd def put mask on... might give clue. talking BLM protests, happened 50 states. 50 seeing spikes infections. protesters wore masks practiced social distancing. 

The common denominator states seeing spikes rushed reopen economies safe so. that, must protests! thought ones give Walgreens free?  Stupid people deserve shouted down, danger society.

You die aged 50 complications mild flu 20 years ago absolutely right general benefits. point big impact personal reality.

I'm living alone, seeing friends, visiting family, talking neighbors. case bit complex. 

I Rome whole shit began felt well.

I northern Italy week completely locked area felt well.

I plead local health authorities test supposed travel 4 weeks asia (business) afraid spread whole shit world. Luckily Asian customers postpone business visit also locked down. choose self quarantine week, incl long discussion CEO I'm here. handle whole pressure anymore, knowing it.
I finally got test 2 3 weeks returning Italy testing availability high enough time.

I everything humanly possible avoid contact people. leave house 12 days straight work.

That's narcissists operate. actual problem solving he's fired competent people worshipping enough. Even funnier - first one‚Äôs pandemic summer, supposed hit lowest point.

Buckle seatbelts ladies gents. 1/3rd country still thinks overhyped political scam. We‚Äôre get one extreme reality checks century. why?

A) gluttons punishment.

B) Quarantine boring. diseases ended urgencies vaccines entered phase 3. enough sick people transmission test it. keep hold. No, i'd like actual medical care. Without pay third party cares profit. SpaceX? Could guys please stop shit already? like entire global economy dependent you...oh wait don‚Äôt solution even mild remedy either, I‚Äôve thinking months now. issue large enough chunk decides go way hypothetical herd immunity threshold increases. Trust I‚Äôm trying shit choice, respect it, might go way myself. obviously single person isn‚Äôt going huge effect. single instances add up, that‚Äôs part worries me. light end tunnel could away realize. Flu vaccinations 2018: 33.9%‚Äì56.3% among adults that‚Äôs without half year media conditioning telling risky rushed vaccine could be, side effects rushed vaccines past, etc etc.

I problem people concerned health. Zero. problem increasingly embarrassing rhetoric US regarding things like masks. can‚Äôt get people cover faces hours day expect people openly accept quickly produced vaccine type virus never needed one before? feel like lot people going take chin get covid. brings host issues, vulnerable people exposed months. Outbreaks due overwhelmingly fresh population lower immunity. course increased hospitalizations ultimately deaths. would fine always issues anti-vaxxers. putting aside whether one safe given it‚Äôs rushed state, it‚Äôs refuse risk. undoubtedly percentage population can‚Äôt take rely herd immunity won‚Äôt achieve many people unvaccinated. USA! Number 1! Can't die already dead... difficult, entirly impossible enter Europe US. least Germany, whole reopening discussion mainly tourists / non -neccecary travel.

If secure job Germany, employer provide papers tourist entering Germany. However, securing job might tricky. lot employees ""Kurzarbeit"" (reduced hours, government helps paying wages) many companies stopped recruiting. Chances might better outside corporate like Au-Pair. 

If prove residency Germany (you could quit job entering), less restrictions traveling Europe. good news pharmaceutical companies want make billions billions billions billions dollars. order that, they'll everything power make billions billions doses.

Why that? people get elect nutjobs public office, people get re-elected next election disastrous handling outbreak hope likely lost. Yes. think detecting lot cases though.

Your ideology burrowed way amygdala. bombs get ratings.

Boy, they. CNN exist today willingness PR wing U.S. military Gulf Iraq wars Urban areas growing rural areas get empty sad. Urban areas skew blue heavily.

So big issue medium term undoing disproportionate electoral power rural areas. founders US good idea time never imagined population density differences live today. 

The electoral college makes sense don‚Äôt communication system allows (essentially) instantaneous information transfer anywhere world. makes sense send information horse. It‚Äôs outdated fuck it‚Äôs got go. Lucky. come over? Remember mayor Vegas literally said that?

She fully prepared let virus spread unmitigated sake casino tax revenue. Yeah - Even that! 

Hell, even subject ‚Äústrict scrutiny‚Äù (the rigorous level review), would STILL PASS, narrowly tailored, minimally restrictive, fulfills one already-specified compelling government interests: preserving lives large group people! 

People forget rights, though sacred, unlimited. guns specifically right. wearing mask not. two compare. Disposable seems wasteful, appreciate tip might need buy need glasses.

My friend, saying, deaths births follow trend. year 200k deaths last year, year year before. possible explanation deaths COVID?

Think it. intension fight argue reasonably. Rest you. Stay safe. point testing us contact tracing? People infect others know sick.  Even reports true 10x number people infected, would still years reach herd immunity. Maybe devastated urban centers could hit 2021. again, NONSTOP WORSE - herd immunity plan, sign people completely ignorant selfish given up. F reddit. Freedom safety. I‚Äôll die free man kneel fucking fake ass disease. Eat dick admit link cuomo says better yet link department health does? So, number crunching people lying whatever reasons, saying number suspect. Got it.

If can't use numbers, neither you.

That change fact virus real, highly contagious, cause painful death, leave survivors debilitating long term issues, poorly handled US, infection rates highest states opened prematurely non-compliant populations. 

Asian countries went SARS infection back recognized COVID-19 highly-compliant population wore damned mask. per-capita infections rates much lower US.

The US highly-entitled population wants believe individual rights supersede public health safety measures.

It *is* pandemic, *did* go thing 1918, mask-wearing social distancing exactly got rid it. overnight, time. It‚Äôs culture. selfish, like see West blatantly arguing bad faith. Done thread. major communications failure Danish ministry justice Or, put another way, 57% COVID deaths linked nursing home. New York testing less. ‚ÄúSociety move quickly slowest member‚Äù - Jim Jefferies Lol. optimism guess. ever seen beach? Lol cmon comment could last year so.... Don‚Äôt privatize health care industry people. 

THIS result. I'm disagreeing all. virus spread protests spread outdoor events? hard, lockdown supposed beef hospital capacity, increase testing availability institute good contact tracing program. Testing available lot testing centers reaching capacity noon every day. surge capacity hospitals that's last resort. contact tracing programs know mask requirements. basically 3 months flattening curve we're diving right back spike could followed lead nations kept numbers still come lockdown. So. No. sources. Nice job. husband dad type 2 diabetic statins. Thought pretty common tbh. seriously trying quibble exact procedures state implemented re-open?

The point clearly *wasn't* protests caused spike we're seeing today.BStop trying derail conversation. Stay focused.

Obviously, whatever restrictions place either ignored (because ""muh dreedumbz), completely ineffective preventing spike cases.

Regardless, stop blaming protests unless provide data shows significant spikes cities biggest protests.

Do research first discuss. allowed likes Fox News infiltrate people‚Äôs brains 25 years tell nothing important complete civil liberties. Many don‚Äôt realize AZ follows CDC guidelines also reporting mortality. reflected AZ Dept Health receives official death certificate naming COVID cause death.  Caller ID spoofed. think virus cares. 

If find way reason help understand need freedom, regardless consequence around you, please let us know. follow Presidents guidance, wear masks. mean like New York City? weird reading americans ridicule people wear masks Swedish subs rather ridicule people want people wear them. 
Trying find excuses wear them, apparently 100% safe need, completely useless. Deep South rough shape. positive rate Alabama consistently exceeded 10 percent last week. afraid March. Just, many stopped caring. will, yes. Rights important feels.... 

If don‚Äôt want get sick don‚Äôt leave house ü§∑ Good, throw plane refuse.  People can't trusted act best interests requires something normal routine life. mandate consequences disobeying. DC NOVA huge initial spikes locked hard white collar workers worked home. also massive protests without additional spike far yeah elect creepy senile old man president, fix coronavirus sure They're 3-4 hour drive Phoenix SoCal? mean im 6‚Äô 1‚Äù 27 bmi considered overweight good shape. ridiculous measurement completely ignores muscle mass. people saying masks muzzles silence crowd. cure stupid Beach Answer: internet changed society fundamentally, unfortunately probably forever. didn‚Äôt maybe others did. remember one paper couple months ago one ""look smart am, say things daring way different experts"" dudes lot good credentials necessarily good source.

But one thing said may prescient would mistake lock entire world simultaneously, instead wait virus reached certain tipping point region. feasible sustain lockdowns forever, want lockdown time maximum effect. early, waste them. chart saw early on, knew we‚Äôd facing ‚Äúsee overreacted‚Äù phase short term thinking 
  recommendations work. real consequences obey authorities' recommendations travel Sweden unless necessary. Denmark solved level employer wherein many Danish employers reserve right terminate employee found travel Sweden, recommendations Danish authorities. seen happening Finland yet, start can't put place legal measures like Norway (fines violate teh quarantine upon return Sweden). 

There always people obey recommendations. That's speed limits laws, recommendations. comes public health safety, sometimes consequences need place. Add least another 0 end fine. 

Illegal dumping fines $10,000 NY, potentially killing citizens much higher fine imo lol shit.

Masks work. herd immunity guaranteed way end this

I'm still extremely concerned two things:

-- adverse health effects among cases (yet) ""severe""... Maybe people think end lung vascular problems life... really even sure yet *fatality* rate people covid19 one year, never mind five ten-- important numbers. got increasingly dangerous relapses we're start bumping into.

-- Immunity vs. re-infection. Maybe single wave kills 5 thousand people various corners world incubating infections places get it, possibly mutations could send new strain round world 0.5% happens year year year...

I'd really prefer try harder suppress stop damn thing keep trying gather data.

Per-Willy Amundsen believes contagion situation Northern Sweden critical wants defense assistance borders Northern Norway.

Storting [parliament] representative Per-Willy Amundsen said interview iTroms√∏ Wednesday sent questions Minister Justice prevent spread contamination Swedish reindeer husbandry practitioners. concerned situation, iTroms√∏ wrote Hans-Olav Eriksen, municipal superintendent, concerned infection reindeer husbandry four northern Swedish siidaer, currently way Balsfjord Storfjord large reindeer herds.


Amundsen worried situation wants Minister Justice, Minister Health, take far clearer measures avoid infection Northern Norway.

- situation serious Northern Sweden, Norwegian borders reality controlled 24 hours day. night free passage indications people pass night. desired situation, must avoid getting infection northern Sweden, says Amundsen.

About 1 percent Norway's population antibodies new coronavirus. picture, samples tested SARS-CoV-2 laboratory laboratory medicine Oslo University Hospital, Ullev√•l. 

#Have act

Amundsen sent written question Justice Minister Monica M√¶land limit spread infection northern Sweden. Minister Justice response time one week, Amundsen believes wait long clearer measures.

- act, can't wait week. situation Northern Norway special, see dangerous development Northern Sweden, says Amundsen.

On Friday, 20 people proven coronavirus admitted hospital Norway. Nurses Iris Jensen Marthe Hansen, work emergency room B√¶rum Hospital, take infection control equipment. 

- get boost Northern Norway, far worse conditions elsewhere country. terms distance, access health resources municipalities.

#A police job

Amundsen wants borders northern Sweden controlled around clock, today.

- Initially police task, see difficult long boundaries Northern Sweden Northern Norway. police use defense resource, mean might situation now.


- want defense borders Northern Sweden?

- question militarizing borders, using defense resource. nothing extraordinary it, often done. saw recently Gardermoen recently, says Amundsen, aiming Home Guard helped Gardermoen take care infection control earlier year.




Police allowed use resources elsewhere community, defense, crises situations may require additional assistance. Amundsen believes police resources Northern Norway access to, connecting defense right solution.


""It fact, take inward, Northern Norway police resources elsewhere country, much Norwegian defense here,"" says, adding:


- police ask assistance, nothing special.   Unemployment ran individual states little regulation federal level. state kind thing. Since states balance budgets, revenues significantly, interests pay claims possible. 

The federal government used state systems (which woefully underfunded understaffed) manage distribution extra $600/week provided via legislation. required underfunded programs adapt new eligibility rules, also massive influx people claiming benefits matter weeks. That's states significant delays processing claims/payouts. US ruled example think biggest issue there. really set bar low. good news! Good job protestors! guys got us Covid back! hey, worth statues got eh? ahahah good job guys! Worst bot ever. According conservatives conversation that‚Äôs tyranny tho bad thing Nope. Military hates him. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* twice, we're going shut much longer harder. 

We Ro 0.9 first shut down. would take us 5 months get typical vancant beds hospitals full half full. country could use reset. There's much extra social media etc people distracted. people know focused work/family well, know crazy people making all. wear mask right thing hard. many people's thinking goals convoluted can't figure they're trying do. anyone (any state?) considered 2.5 week Hard Shutdown? hard shutdown mean, 

Day1-7 Pre Shutdown 

\[no restrictions, except masks\], Postoffice/FedEx/UPS/Amazon deliver 3 weeks military style rations every body; prescriptions need filled time; 1.5x capacity rations hospitals since people may moved 2.5 Weeks 

Day 8-25 -- 2.5 Week Hard Shutdown 

\[almost complete lockdown, utilities (water/sewer/electrician/gas) minimum medical/police/fire\], stores closed, Restaurants/Bars, Grocery/Convenience Stores, shipping stopped, lock everything

Day 26-35 -- post Shutdown 

\[no restrictions, except masks\] Quarentine sick, contact tracing

 

This would get (well ?99%?) cases either known resolved; thus making quarantine sick needed after; hopefully minimal enough remaining cases able successfully contact trace.

Having known starting point, Known ending point would make much easier people comply/enforce. Yes Obviously. people Russia targets dumbest unoriginal among us. don‚Äôt come lies conspiracy theories themselves, Russian agents working around clock alongside Chinese Saudis manufacture dumbed conspiracy memes average hillbilly interpret get mad about. It‚Äôs much longer process one leader. That's literally Mayor Las Vegas offered Yeah, see opening early, forcing business restock expenses preparing open, waste shutting back good idea. infected person breathes droplets fall floor, virus live floor transfer onto clothing someone sits lies floor cause contamination way? big risk that? still fearfull one... go say major city xD beg xD plsssss

Or put REAL adress beaverbrave xD upsets *some* regions sacrificed lot, followed protocols, managed well.

Then others decided say screw it, I‚Äôm out.

Now back square one.

However also know worldwide isn‚Äôt going away vaccine. world overpopulated. know, Black Death. Won‚Äôt civilization ending event. Humanity far worse cold common varying symptoms think economic fall going scary this. keep discussion, people like ""oh people out! traffic."" OK, going? Visiting family walking circles economic activity. Theaters, expensive restaurants retail outlets, high end hotels, places people dump money keep economic machine lubricated - closed.

I making prediction months ago r/nyc subreddit. Even countries handled pandemic well seeing massive economic losses. 

There easy way now. Facepalm. Please, Sweden, *get together*. Please? pathetic.

‚Ä¶Well, alright: better nothing and, ever, happy whatever tottering baby steps get comes Sweden‚Äôs COVID response. least they‚Äôre trying instead talking endlessly. Gold star effort measurable progress, definitely *can* [clearly seen graph tests performed]( even though slope steep children‚Äôs rollercoaster amusement park. How's that? #Translation

More people tested covid-19 Sweden, still minority regions around country offer free virus testing everyone. Antibody tests show corona available two regions far.

- regions need adapt testing spread infection locally, need adapt situation region. large spread infection, may need prioritize capacity parts population testing needed most, says Emma Spak, responsible Health Medical SKR, Sweden's Municipalities Regions.

#Increased testing - everywhere

In Sweden, testing hot debated issue, often pointed worked countries. Testing operations grown sharply country, latest statistics continue show Sweden far behind nearest neighbor countries terms much population far tested covid-19.

In survey SVT News made basis information given public 1177.se, **you see regions offer virus testing free everyone. regions, told test done doctor health center approves it, others clear certain groups, example socially important work, given priority.**

The government made agreement regions ambition everyone perceived symptoms allowed virus test, regions yet arrived.

#Stockholm first

The agreement also states stated ambition public offered free antibody tests, opportunity charge fee SEK 200.
Today, Stockholm region Uppsala region offer antibody tests. Stockholm free, Uppsala pay 200 SEK.


- antibody testing aimed finding infection passed through, regions prioritize part test gives best effect reduce spread infection. extended virus testing finds ongoing infection effective. used basis infection detection also find others covid-19, says Emma Spak. highly possible - organic tissue survived, cases, hundreds hundreds years whilst buried perfect conditions. Anything could happen :P it‚Äôs private. Daycares open live finally closed weeks girls worked contracted families daycare. makes sense!? Sigh .. win.

Even bars opened, read business down, many probably survive anyway.

But keep open, people going die.

I suppose pick .. TX picks life business. want minimize business owners losing have, employees jobs may face financial hardships, even homelessness certainly mental issues.

But matter do, choosing two. lose-lose situation. add on, It‚Äôs unfortunate many religious people think science invalidates beliefs. Science cannot invalidate beliefs testable. certain things religious texts say true (like world wasn‚Äôt created 6000 years ago, humans created instead evolved) things lead conclusion god. hey, it‚Äôs okay got things wrong religious texts; minor errors don‚Äôt invalidate whole thing. written long time ago, endlessly translated, interpreted differently, used political purposes throughout time. certainly many good things learned texts. excellent basis morality. scientists atheists either. Many scientists religious. one learns amazingly complex universe is, one seeks comfort spirituality lot never explained. 

And you‚Äôre right, failure religious leaders trying use fear protect power. However, scientist, also blame outspoken politically active; trying engage communities discussions instead writing imbeciles. sit offices labs, publish papers, spectate events unfold. Never go full R`0` I'll happy attorney draft legally binding one. answer goddamned question. 

#WILL SIGN IT?! money ""or something"" something quite obviously liberal plot make Trump look bad.

Biiiiig /s Search facebook, there's locals posting it. I've personally changed running routes roads pedestrians ever on. Seldom driven aswell. see cyclist side road cross street. far 100 days I've seen 1 runner 1 cyclist.

However still got honked scolded day...when middle freakin buttf*** nowhere understand people freaked but. come on. No, many countries indeed following happening America. able see track outcomes different actions since much variance across states. countries much using American examples inform policies, often terms do. ‚ÄúNews‚Äù lol make article removed breaking rules. really must extremely hard certain individuals follow rule simple EDIT TITLES. otherwise can't explain it. consider World War 1 catastrophe? virus officially killed Americans World War. catastrophe.  also surge hospitalizations ""elective"" stuff wait get treated Saw another thread Houston backtracked hospitals full. truth that? One factor making covid cases rise, people believe mask wearing goverment trying take away freedoms. good chunk people still think covid hoax.
I one love science thanks time college. Ignoring professionals studied 8+ years worked whole like disease control, seems ludicrous me. Maybe vegan talking, think everyone wear mask. Proud sheep, bible calls anyways. play emotions. Try find common ground views work slowly comment right way admin handled get go massive dumpster fire, you‚Äôd hope people would quick feet think themselves. Enough wit buy TP, masks devil.. go figure. You‚Äôre assumption people left look back this. That‚Äôs wishful thinking way it‚Äôs going now. Covid-19 inside job bro. Right, let's give virus shorten time even weakened immune system. dumbass, going make feel bad decision And/or

c) care keeping young kids isolated prolonged periods time damaging mental health  Lol, that‚Äôs ridiculous. worse access, worse care. walk McDonald shoes shirt, call police refuse serve me. happens resist don‚Äôt comply? happen refuse wear mask refuse follow police orders. ""helpful"" - insulting patronizing. 

I've wearing mask since February, [back WaPo helping muddy waters pretending one knew masks would Ha! Never thought I'd true NJ pride instead kinda, sorta pretending to! 95 percent yea right like would happen Real men love ""real men"" concept. /s whole thing botched, yes.

Why would even think would ok ignore safety standards then? It‚Äôs botched worse situation entire planet think it‚Äôs ok?

So take believed Trump said one day, like magic, it‚Äôs going go away. Frightened death stuck heads sand 6 weeks ago pretended everything would fine. Trump isnt telling scientific groups doing, doesnt mean scientific groups sitting thumbs.

There LOT work going this, much concern scientific community stress levels pretty high. Lol wow Believing hair brained conspiracy easier accepting decisions. way accountability actions. Didnt canada restrict incoming states anyways? think economic fall going scary this. keep discussion, people like ""oh people out! traffic."" OK, going? Visiting family walking circles economic activity. Theaters, expensive restaurants retail outlets, high end hotels, places people dump money keep economic machine lubricated - closed. sucks. 

That said still time buy gold stocks. child also learning disability. Online learning disaster her, IEP calls interaction teachers, less. Online option us anymore. 
 
Our school talking sending kids back building like 2 days week. online 2 days week person, gauranteed fall behind.

If going fall behind anyway might bother school first half year. worth health risks. I'd rather held back we'll 4th grade 2021-22 quite quiet moment, starts look like hospital capability can't handle much longer, not. Hopefully happen. ... if..

That's word use right start making shit up? assassination attempt dear leader! Well hope right better, enough bad going on. Small business owners usually pretty well themselves. Thats basically premise every virus iirc Yeeaah like corruption breaking law matters anymore gop idea that's supposed mean. Bloody Victoria said earlier thread related protestors, think it‚Äôs worth putting again. 

If people don‚Äôt understand badly COVID going fuck America. Let tell you.

Continue protest ignore social distancing go crowded places without mask within year, half America without job. currently 60 million unemployed.

Millions going infected. die hospitals overloaded.

There million dead virus alone. including people die able get treated regular medical needs.

Those survive heavily debt, work without help unemployment ran months ago government doesn‚Äôt give send help. You‚Äôll see massive spike suicides.

Ask sounds important respecting Social distancing wearing masks. Yes! Without reading article guess with... 1. Better understanding care patients. 2. Overal lower cortisol levels patients. 3. Less exposure due distancing. 4. Maybe virus strains mutated less deadly. 5. patients might already somewhat exposed developed levels immunity already... come back reading now.. let's see Yes even 125,000 dead counting. Still people checking numbers ignoring capabilities country‚Äôs science community quite thick. Like dude doesnt matter anymore anyways keeps people inside home watching games, I'm it. Lol, biggest nugget knowledge failed US response stop testing problem goes away. next election real eye opener sure. really respect man, blind spot. never poor life, idea job ears debt feels like. possible hoax? another governor said something similar knowing virus could spread quickly. like 3.5 months mind you.  

This tactic wash hands blood. hope constituents let him.  in, Head Florida Man continues Florida man.  feel like anglosphere going flooded American refugees COVID. (Please help me) doctor smart enough know fucked up. We're ""feeling"", we're looking numbers following advice people medical degrees.

COVID care feelings. people wearing masks packing bars restaurants throwing parties. Yeah saw local news night. Bunch crazies. driving last night near city‚Äôs downtown saw every restaurant packed streets flooded. don‚Äôt think people care. disheartening. when? people would wear unless forced . Armchair medical experts know would loudly proclaim guy right likely get sick die.

Some common reasons: he's gonna touch mask, he's gonna touch hood around face, immune system getting weaker second living bubble like /s He's donated 45 BILLION idiot. C U Next Tuesday. Quantum antibodies USA's saving grace. Let's keep working guys.  really wanted give secret shit people, put water supply? easiest way? 

I hope turn conspiracy video YouTube next week. Try weed don‚Äôt overdo get dumb. Makes productive people opposite like nuclear Ghandi. go 100% end negative values. Let's see happens here. Referring positive Covid tests. Nope. Still wave one. I‚Äôm pretty much living life April, except visit sister. still act like everything closed. I‚Äôm South FL obnoxious thing I‚Äôve ever seen self centered petty people are.

I keep getting texts mom so's birthday, memorial day, father's day, used able family get together. really difficult constantly say no, good idea whole family get together every two weeks! family members want wear masks gloves bring plates sit outside hot. gonna use bathroom choice there? Mom going go wash dishes uncle's house that's normally sure can't change .

People need realize fOrEvEr miss 6 months worth birthday parties. literally dumbest way die. many times hear *whole family* getting sick losing couple people wanted graduation party quincinera whatever. barbecue year! next year? Sorry no, family. afflicted toxic individualism. opinion:

This symptom country that‚Äôs totally fucked up.

All countries people wanting wear masks that‚Äôs inevitable, nothing like USA Don‚Äôt pandemics typically last 1.5yrs? look back history. Hospitalization usage Lee County scary think numbers lag catches up.

My med school last month White Coat BLM outside masks social distancing. safe? safe one groups people around. also work buildings sick people expose covid daily. There‚Äôs risk inherent job protest people consider worthy risk abiding Hippocratic Oath. I‚Äôve thought since died 8 days ago sub needs start moderating banning users push disinformation ""ineffectiveness"" masks. need Bill Gates tell embarrassing. 

I mortified American, international friends making much fun me. showing genuine concern health. 

United States third world country, failed state, regrettable live in. case wondering, Iowa, Montana, Wisconsin, South Dakota states mask requirement. really presuming. limit test people sure positive, get high percentage. relax tests, obviously it'll go down.

I mean, take fish net high concentration fish, get lot fish one net. use 5 nets include pools lower concentration get less fish per net. B.S appropriate name. Hey there. I'm west Houston myself. described experience exactly. Hit miss. total shit circus. absolutely real leadership state level, wait, state leaders undermining local leaders, well.... think American deaths go millions. like 900,000.

That enough change minds think personal freedom impacted think probability dying low, worth worrying about.  die, die... Yep, mom got it, similar story. could barely talk month too. Says billionare could've stepped lol. I'm sure affect rates reason US poorly. mostly response right-wing politicians, think? won‚Äôt though.

Ironic #AllLivesMatter types also high likelihood anti-mask types. Great,what Sweden He's saying get mandatory vaccines, he's saying fucked countries fucking truth. he's rich make evil too. wear pants? Go Miami. Don‚Äôt worry, Federal Reserve make trillions dollars thin air keep feeding machine. don‚Äôt need last line. line them. They‚Äôve chosen TMC one last hospitals id expect 'collapse'. Even height infection NYC cases fell radar, heard major hospitals ""collapsing"". ""These people care people's lives. hope die!""

Don't see logical inconsistency statement? literally says repeatedly higher density areas lower death rates (death, infection).

And come conclusion rural safer again? let literally 1500 years conservative ideology consistently coming wrong side every historical issue public debate convince sides dumbass. phrase 2020. tongue cheek phrase reference idiots grasping concept years. Protesters large virus believers wearing masks. Protests outside. 

Parties largely virus deniers, wearing masks, indoors. Plus drugs alcohol lower inhibitions increase risk taking. 

But sure, said. don‚Äôt. leadership wanted. voted for. Fuck em. won‚Äôt laughed at, taught briefly like Great Depression Spanish Flu, 100 years Demofrat Republiclub parties battling repeat people learn nothing saying particles lung causes cancer probably nothing long clot blood give kidney stones fuck would that? shortsighted game. Anybody ever uses evil. nuke doesnt discriminate combat non combat particapants even state war dont kill civilians especially unarmed women children Anyone wanna marry get outta stupid country gets killed. ;p Get different job. course choice. long till US refugees start streaming across? Build ice wall! Never forget Everything typed could easily argument antivaxxer. makes sense, entire world politicizing masks ""keep people afraid"" that, know, political party one country extremely dismissive science fit political entire rest world.

Ticketing somebody lack mask new - infrastructure place widespread ticketing. 

An even better example would ticketing people bus subway ticket, since deals people person, see happen fairly regularly too. clusters started busy nightclubs, strict social distancing? Damn, dick, people dying work short time. oh yeah definitely enforced needs something simple. Write ticket $10-$25 fine paid spot. vote trust me. That‚Äôs get Red Ohio every city navy blue states gerrymandered hell back. We're bath salt kind Probably amount people cramming bars, restaurants parties. I've heard people Brazil. putting everything corona, die shotgun wound, corona, die car accident, corona. Whereas us know numbers counting covid deaths, somehow think numbers higher reality. That's awhile. Coffee side whiskey?! 

But yeah. Gotta give liver time recoup. hard though. look news comments anything covid related I'm like ""... need fucking drink"" That‚Äôs awesome man. live Mexico. We‚Äôre still rising number cases, Hopefully follow example!!

Give enough lead time since may several days delay given huge crush new testing past week. Sick, dude cant make social species unable socialize people. Mental health taking massive hit. Even Europe none lockdowns last beyond 10 weeks. need better plan locking humans home 3+ months cannot possibly it. think fact claim ""masks prevent spread..."" better stated ""masks drastically reduce odds transmitting..."". former easily shown false, giving a**holes easy out. Bars clubs Miami never officially reopened. restaurants allowed reopen 50% capacity May 18. Since bars reopened ""restaurants"" adding food, Miami-Dade Broward counties always one reopening phase behind rest state.  second that. R/covidpositive peer reviewed. empirical data confirm assertions made. can't use reddit source medical information 'I'm wrong think hard I'm right' I‚Äôm saying items important.

Also data apparently wrong:

Analyst Arizona 12%. Texas looks like 10% haven‚Äôt verified source work. ‚ÄúWalters also said going public without mask months, insisted ‚Äônot changed one iota‚Äò despite testing positive, although said stayed home past week.‚Äù Oh look people critical thinking skills. can‚Äôt tell real joke. terrifying words English language are: I'm government I'm help.

I'm arguing I'm victim? even sure talking would give shit I‚Äôm gonna wear mask either way. living stupidest times. 

It absolutely mind blowing people ducking stupid ignorant can‚Äôt bothered wear fucking mask! 

America stupid people problem.  Looking situation Florida comes surprise. answer pretty simple yes.

Does make things safer degree? Yes.

Does make things dangerous degree? No.

Then reason anything mask. Self centered obsession one's comfort lives safety everyone else cruel evil. Exactly, starts saying like governor Trump would number one pick. Followed closely pence mitch. Yeah, super-duper, platinum-diamond-gold-elite level flyer refuses? person banned? Doubt it. It‚Äôs obvious contradiction point trying make. said..explicitly...even miracle vaccine end year, still deal mass production. vaccine end year, already mass produced.

This absolutely *still* case last phase, may discover inhalant less effective injection patch.

Then go converting it.

And getting 7 billion vaccines end year. not. Mass production still huge risk. distribution.

And god forbid requires refrigeration would pretty big fucking obstacle, too. KARMA B!T{H don‚Äôt understand feels people able understand putting things mouth appears pretty contagious respiratory pandemic terrible idea. defense Trump failing lead example encourage Americans so, saving lives process, illegal so? seems pretty weak. Lmao okay bro. 40 deaths per day 21% increase deaths, despite improved treatment, time preparation, nursing homes better prepared, public knowing too. Seems pretty significant me. yeah, keep trying move goalposts doctor. even worth time responding longer. I'll back middle July tell told wrong. Fair enough. Let take ModeRNA vaccine US. would ramping enough doses trial 30000 people phase III data efficacy?
Or Oxford one started clinical trials phase III three countries (UK, Brazil South Africa). would risk reputations didn‚Äôt background data go on. I‚Äôve read paper preliminary data Oxford one think it‚Äôs fairly optimistic. vaccine seems induce immune responses required successfully fight infection. can't stand Biden either. issue Trumpet friends acted like coming here. would minimal effect. early March railing Obama failed 12k deaths H1N1. kept telling them, let's see totals six months. sucks is, anywhere near people rush get mall shopping hair cuts. 

I know country could've withstood either Italy had. Aging population, loads Chinese factory workers back New Years celebrations. Honestly, think they've done fantastic job. Hoping them, sticks. r/covidpositive see Oh yeah. I'd forgotten that. think fact well Florida proves that's true. ""party personal responsibility"" became thing. ridiculously easy prove, using simple pulse oximeter, oxygen level blood decrease putting Wow 4 weeks! Thanks excellent comparison! anything take/do temporarily alleviate headaches?  That's pretty factually correct. vote count confirms it. Yeah gig delivery, sure many restaurants good job separation. order get in/out, need travel close proximity people going opposite direction, people leaving often door restaurant masked. Tables cleaned)santatized differently (pre outbreak) host/hostess wearing masks nose.
I see surprised see numbers inflate much higher present. NY (outside city, far it) area many restaurants either outdoor dining offering on-premises dining (takeout delivery only). They've allowed since past Tuesday realized risk local appetite opening indoor dining rooms point time make sense. Cause Trump fuels retardation also disproportionately affects Black Hispanic individuals choice work. 2:1 ratio POC white iirc. fly Delta! guy gotta pay attention schools treated way, demographic makeup. affects white people, affects Americans rights, everyone else count. 

Don't believe me? Take hard look anti Vietnam war movement. take look drug war. notice anti war sentiment picks right around time draft deferments college students stop allowed, legalize movement really picks right around time white kids start ODing painkillers high enough rate. 

Gotta know audience. Even simpler again. object told do. correct. got away first time, feels law. happen? Maybe right start - Boston Tea Party essentially looting. Honestly, seems thing right sadly. Triple Pneumonia euphimism undiagnoised COVID 19?  Oh hey agree again. think well done Ministry Justice. formulated better plan clear several things. Esp. something Swedish doctor, print form. 

But think let even tests anyway. Well, matter tbh since one regions get tested right symptomatic default ban, softer bit diplomatic ""gimme"" (or might messed badly). 

I wonder team already holiday something?

And yeah, Sweden land rules, rules, rules. yet another part became fascinated COVID response sine OPPPOSITE Swedes usually do: carefully regulate hell every tiny detail life. [amusingly snarky piece bizarre contrast thing is, I'm saying places open fast, many people want everything catastrophic confirm existing notions. act like places deserve lot people die disagreeing preferred strategy. Cool. still see it. reposted it. Again, need know someone attended protest. numbers positive infected jumped area, could make connection. can‚Äôt even currently higher infection rate following protests. Again, also free go look Massachusetts. specifically tested people attended protests (over 17,000). infection rate change. states higher infection rates aren‚Äôt even states large-scale protests. They‚Äôre states lax social distancing rules, mask requirements, quicker reopening window. 

The big ‚Äúoof‚Äù moment respinning comments bringing nothing new table. It‚Äôs clear never productive conversation. choose accept information may challenge beliefs. 

It‚Äôs odd, seem intent scientific, peer-reviewed proof, cannot produce proof substantiates claim protests contributed rise cases. 

I spent time looking and, know, couldn‚Äôt find any. So, I‚Äôm sure grounds argument stands besides opinion. mean no, that‚Äôs blatantly incorrect. US could use rocks currency would still largest economy. 

The Euro stronger dollar ages America still larger GDP entire euro zone combined. American made headlines last week [after becoming first airline start banning passengers wearing face state California isn‚Äôt letting open yet. 

Disney doesn‚Äôt want cancel opening, doesn‚Äôt want get blamed large outbreak. They‚Äôre hoping Florida tells open. Florida doesn‚Äôt responsible governor, wants Disney voluntarily open. It‚Äôs game chicken.  every man USA Well, reopened slowly cases decreased lot. first started people allowed go walks runs. people allowed go visit family. shops restaurants opened distancing. cinemas, gyms... open course precautions. started slowly cases increased would able track it. never increased basically everything want precautions mask on. go dinner, go shopping, go gym, beach... thankfully able open time summer.  one made wrong assumptions ill-informed I'm stupid one? Ok 

Here go incorrect assumptions ""that's getting promoted"". That's actually opposite said. said well dream job comfortable lifestyle. stop trying bring others level sort inferiority complex. Good day you, sir  made 2018 little relation situation today Right wing Texas snowflakes might stupid Alabama right wing snowflakes. love U.S. totally fucked chance controlling anytime soon, instead saying ok, let's fix it, thread full laymen claiming think safe whatever want comfortable them.

Yes, legitimate reasons - doubt someone legitimate reason wear mask would react like that.

Thinking makes wonder get Doctor's note saying can't wear pants. quarantine working home taught one thing, ""putting pants sucks"". access Arizona public health department data beyond fairly useless dashboard, best eyeball it. know going run hospital space start triage even halted spread now. context can't afford human interaction making money (since obviously care lives point) extra infection going cost collapsing medical system. kids sports make money.

But unless kid interacts grandparents, extremely unlikely either child parents die result hastening rate spread. extremely likely child parents going catch coronavirus anyway, unlikely need medical care - did, young people, would get older person know instead turned away.

For OP, /u/ThickSarcasm, I'd go ask /r/CoronavirusAZ. guys bring good data day I'm sure conversations lot better information give here. don‚Äôt like trump shouldn‚Äôt flying AA? I'm work tourist town TN right now. Thousands people rubbing other. http://imgur.com/a/TeQDB8f Dublin's center today. fsck seen many couples woman wearing mask‚ÄΩ many films hero saves damsel? Countless! many hero infects potentially kills her? Faaaaaar less! 

So: guys: wear mask, save damsel! People countries treat like human beings slaves sad thing happening election year Trump possibly blessing-in-disguise.

Imagine happened 2021 Trump 2nd term? give flying shit workers. joke? Unemployment nothing else, keep mind virus needs host survive, thrive spread. take opportunity discriminate. choice, people wont wear masks. Sometimes way communicate conservatives.  wealth didn‚Äôt come nowhere. United States founded exploitation. rich bastards wouldn‚Äôt money slavery, Native genocide abuse working people. Americans trained see greed virtue selfishness freedom. False choice Obviously telling people wear masks isnt working, requiring masks businesses isnt working. live far Disneyland California restrictions proposing (i.e. masks times, reservations required, vastly limited capacity, parades fireworks might draw dense crowds) sound like woudl actually fun go. sure revenues would even cover overhead skeleton crew staff. LOL saw arriving last week. Socialized healthcare job protections bigger causes though. spread done work people can't afford health care *or* missing work. issues nearly serious first world nations. agree likely way cases reported way slice it. Interesting got Donald stuff  sure anyone posted yet, fold toilet paper square wear mask. Yeah. happens me, give loaded glock private room, put heavy duty noise-cancelling headphones. 

Cuz fuck life. forget us Georgia! We've hit new highs 3 4 times week! first one ""We flattened curve."" Eventually they're going realize worse business long term open right now. damage severe outbreak causing death coach staff member NBA, large number Disney World staff would far worse financial gains short term imo They‚Äôre still wearing masks. continue spread conspiracy theories tons fake facts fit narrative. wish hospitals looked social media using resources treat them. lol literally sound like insane person. I've always wondered Texas. long time thought helliest place earth. Never heard positively. Guns handled patriotic racists..and this. Well. must nice people Texas. Really worried them. Thanks. sucks civil conversations met downvotes do. point feel like pathetic society world. Put damn mask, shut hell move road stopping this. I've cancel plans attend niece's graduation. sucks since milestone young person. Thankfully mom (my sister) understanding lack family. tell disappointed, guilted us it. Good need that.  I'm glaring anyone gets near inside building without mask. wearing masks makes less manly? How? surgical cloth masks protect wearer, protect people around. caring people around makes less man? makes sense. somehow managed contain global pandemic without getting government involved. @_@ That's absolute nonsense. US still democratic system semi-functional check balances. US terrible Trump administration, nothing like CCP. US citizens free criticize president openly. US million people concentration camps. US occupying countries / territories will.

The entire world exposed covid-19 China silenced medical community failed act late. Trump deserves blame mishandling virus since got here, CCP deserves blame got first place. true pretty much every day numbers reported. Even spread added totals, still 9,000 people tested positive recently. called ""double stupid"" reply attempt deflect damage supporters. supporters use hefty dose cognitive dissonance pretend nothing wrong sort conspiracy liberal media something similar go day. Hope employees full Diving suit protection. full day work clots face cover enough. see scenario open indoor bar nightclub time being.

Switzerland cases per day, opened nightclubs again....... superspreader event Zurich announced, one's surprise I'm waiting Tulsa rally covid numbers come on. Practically buzzing many libs owned

DO HEAR LIBS, SOUND LUNGS THEY'RE CRUNCHY I'M DYING ALSO GOT YOU. CAN'T MAKE ANYTHING lot things. could increased testing, number identified cases goes up, testing increase number people hospitalized / fatalities.

It could also delay effect increased numbers. take week two people hospitalized Covid, time fatal.

But I'm also looking local county numbers. four deaths first month Covid here, zero since. clearly vulnerable individuals, little done protect them. Since then, measures place protect vulnerable (or least give people chance avoid getting infected, wish take precautions end). ""We gave LOT people needed, much refusing look work. people saved money, look towards government give more""

- Senator Probably Kids way likely get severely hurt/killed anything covid. Embarrassing cut it. pissed pants, squeezed glass drank like fucking lemonade hot summer's day. Sadly, probably right. I'm AZ school districts seem giving people options (in person, online, hybrid). governor seem considering another shutdown, even though numbers roof hospitals using surge capacity. Schools likely open (some late July, others early August) probably going disaster.  Someone runs online marketing business. Sorry that's wanted hear. answer emails, sort issues, I'm done day. saying show off, way is. clients monthly retainers require little ongoing management. One actually spoken 2 yrs. say wearing mask 9 hours day work definitely different, still done. that‚Äôs I‚Äôve seen worst people ignoring mask rules - office settings. There's probably like 20% America believe Captain America real, good fucking luck that. do. data says reopening worse protests spreading Covid. say protests spread it. died 24 days respirator.

I think sentence means think means. 
It‚Äôs almost five weeks, fyi. 

And four full weeks since big nationwide protests Saturday after. Okay. Solve please. 

And forget account macro micro economic challenges. Citation needed, please. 

Here‚Äôs Minnesota‚Äôs Department Health asserting protests impact Covid case late last week, 4,487 tests conducted across four testing sites specifically protesters resulted 62 positive cases COVID-19, positivity rate 1.4%, department health system Minnesota, HealthPartners, tested 8,500 protesters several clinics positivity rate 0.99%, Doug Schultz, public information officer Minnesota Department Health, told MedPage Today last overall positivity rate Minnesota currently 3.6% 3.7%, according health official. forget y'aliban anyone else see CDC's published fatality rate 0.4% 0.26% considering asymptomatic. 

Thoughts? high, low, right?

 Me? ... know reading comprehension important? understand said i'm complicit simply he's president? can't blame BLM movement Trump consistent COVIDS can, nothing wrong that.

Oh, shit. Yeah, technically ""can"", mean, really helpful. Like, can't blame blister getting bigger, blame source alone lockdown lockdowns still mass gatherings, hth

... well rule notion mass gatherings literally lockdown. Like, different levels lockdown. Fuck, got comment, dissapointed got you. Lol way get theae people wear mask insurance company screw people get virus defies order wear mask. know going lose lives put family poverty maybe perspective mask wearing affordable healthcare change. get emergency benefit Canada hours reduced well. It‚Äôs lost jobs. point given forethought malice perceived self-aggrandizement, many fronts, Trump response covid mass-murder. take medical resources people aren‚Äôt reckless? Hospitals turn away shouldn‚Äôt even let kid play. found article boy died getting hit playing t-ball. Prayers stepdad family. solved gouging eyes out. Yeah, fuck people wear masks!  spent DECADES isolated others small prison cells, hardly human contact. 

Was good them? do? fuck--thank sharing haha. ive still getting takeout tip somehow hadnt even occurred increased risk staff exposure :/ govt owns part Aa United since bailout iirc last month Washington State, Hispanics 55% cases 13% population. can‚Äôt roll shit either.

I twist ear loop putting ears. Helps get tighter fit, also means glasses won‚Äôt fog up! we‚Äôre real, Minnesota‚Äôs Department Health asserting protests impact Covid case late last week, 4,487 tests conducted across four testing sites specifically protesters resulted 62 positive cases COVID-19, positivity rate 1.4%, department health system Minnesota, HealthPartners, tested 8,500 protesters several clinics positivity rate 0.99%, Doug Schultz, public information officer Minnesota Department Health, told MedPage Today last overall positivity rate Minnesota currently 3.6% 3.7%, according health official.

Does change mind? not, not? Inb4 ""muh herd immunity"". Seriously. sick head say ""optimistic sign"" younger people contracting virus?

Cases surging, hospitals filling. room optimism right now. doubt it. Q anon folks think masks psy ops gauge willingness bend authoritarian government. frustrates endlessly... hypocrisy lack self awareness critical thinking astounding. Can't. Manhattan here. same. Weeks hearing ambulances 24 hours. Nothing else going city, spookily quiet, sirens time. horrifying. first time ambulance pull right next building hits really hard. 

The people working ambulances working hospitals, didn‚Äôt make it, heroes. Massive physical mental toll. couple high profile cases health care workers couldn‚Äôt cope amount death saw day day took lives.

As much sucked trapped indoors, ones easy. experience city, Raleigh NC, 90% people wear masks protests 5-6 times went. DC, Saturday BLM Plaza painted, 75% masked observations. Much less social distancing though made sure get test done 4-5 days (for symptoms possibly develop) self-quarantined around 10cdays even though test positive. Haven‚Äôt back protests can‚Äôt see city going back maskless, especially since governor signed order make mask mandatory. That's heard NH doctor saying. step father already visiting hospital Michigan.
She liver failure trying get healthy enough transplant.
Before month allowed visit ICU restricted anyone state. put general population restricted visits matter what.
But within last couple weeks opened visits even general population state vistors. rules one person could visit day.  Yeah actually lot bad head trauma I‚Äôve concluded maybe this. seem spikes cases due protests like expected

Look data. line protests based incubation period, average infected mysteriously cut half. Totally unrelated young idiots protesting though I'm sure. Stay outside! I'm saying Italy 50%. I'm saying significant decreasing spread. Weve seen thing Northeast USA. yours! Glad us see same. time reopen Disney World Never said did. I‚Äôm talking rules put place pandemic. obviously never Miami beach. Clearly masks good idea.

A friend mine working mass testing solution. Collect saliva sample using syringe. People would draw sample mouth inject collection tube. would test tube would 20 samples it. idea get cost $2 $3 per person could daily testing.

The important thing postives people negative. test ‚Äúcatch‚Äù 80 percent cases postive, testing could replace nasty restrictions mask wearing. testing frequently made possible low cost, could quickly cost effectively get things back normal exception quick sample. upside could also test theory flu cold. really wants someone coming work either going infect them?

I sure would employees would protest rights violated problem go work somewhere else... sure, I‚Äôm also pretty certain anyone serious enough case wind hospital going long term issues.

If asymptomatic cases silently issues....ugh Yeah, see could possibly lead spread: Youngest millennials turning 24 year, reference. ""Coming July"" headline misleading. Maybe start debate July, pass bill August, money starts rolling Sept/Oct protestors crowded, use transport, eat, drink, use washrooms? Ironically may case. Natural selection work polio vaccine 1955. china curbing cases fast. cure false reporting Check, check.
I go local children's hospital blood work day. hospital person stationed check temp ask questions get in....

Her first question ""have country"" like, well that's silly question. people gonna get corona virus United states. rational.

What's actually happening people expressing lack care others self absorption. ""me"" generation children.  use freedom, rights, conspiracy theories, discomfort, unscientific complaints masks already wanted - maintain illusion control lives illusion importance.

It's expression psychology, masks would stay home measures something else. take guns, also bought billion bullets. Schrodinger's gun grabber. America's defense, dramatically dense population centers regard freedom highly imo. yes, fortunate people making calls advising. CDC waffled back forth beginning effectiveness masks. Fauci recently said told people wasn‚Äôt necessary wear masks afraid hospitals wouldn‚Äôt enough.   Big companies dropping facial recognition software development. Well, do. Anyone looks Ron Desantis, Trump basically ""leadership"" says ""these guys really value transparency, science making best decisions good society"" is, best, moron.  Meanwhile, actual epidemiologists basically refuting bullshit months, point quite obviously shunted aside. Many experts quit treatment government(s).  


In short, politicians telling YOLO types small-governement ""help I'm oppressed wear mask types"" exactly want hear say ""open""--and complete fool believe one word mouths, every scientist sun saying: wear mask avoid indoor crowded places much possible. Disneyworld may fine open. depends it. assume badly, could well.

In Seattle zoo open. reservation only, limited number people, one way traffic, stay limited time. Also outdoor areas open. Zoos large could hundreds people without groups close together.

Disneyworld could something similar. huge. masks outdoor areas open could thousands people park safely.

Again - probably that. need reopen slowly safe smart ways. Total lockdown makes people go crazy cheat. Smart reopening allows business leisure activities much sustainable.

This almost certainly last another 12 months vaccine. get herd immunity - saw numbers posted yesterday:

That herd immunity happens minimum 60% population. So, say 328M US (based 2019 numbers) herd immunity 196M then. That‚Äôs 1.26M new cases week, every week, three years. 180k new cases day, every day, three years. that‚Äôs STILL 60%. Herd immunity won‚Äôt happen Literally - that‚Äôs WHOLE problem America. School fit people‚Äôs work schedules is. already pay 800 month per kid school care home daycare would charge full day. multiple kids could get nanny. feel problem schools reopen well. schools able kids eat classrooms due lack staff cover lunch breaks states employees entitled lunch break. government start giving fines wearing masks, morons understand anything normal way. gentleman correct - I'm happy he's still us. Thank beautiful nation Vietnam showing us care one-another. Yes! People crying Disneyland movie theaters open it‚Äôs assholes won‚Äôt wear masks. wore goddamn masks resume life quicker. That's insane looking see state MA, ~8k new cases JUNE. I've found ones metal strip work really well stop glasses fogging since form face. Wrong - they‚Äôre skewed every death recorded Wuhan Virus ##we‚Äôre fucked imagine there‚Äôs ton overlap people vigorously exercise people think wearing masks make retain bunch CO2. Overheard someone complaining would wear mask getting nails done. proud found way get wearing mask, eating drinking whole time... Perhaps 1) everything open restrictions, 2) people fucking selfish assholes care themselves. Think so? Yeah, thought so. Pretty much this. Plus people actually social distancing can. often lately see plenty space sidewalks people could move sides distance don't... Entirely avoidable people lazy care agree. point many people already died, people back crowding bars restaurants like covid never happened. given link less says described: weekend's headlines truly terrifying know what's coming now. Cases going up. Positivity rate still high think case increases due increasing testing numbers (Trump's favorite lie). States locking down; people seem care. July 4th may worst possible holiday increase community spread. 10-14 days hospitalizations grow geometrically. Florida, Texas, Arizona, California mid summer point. Deaths skyrocket. San Luis Obispo county sadly needs extra enforcement. went high school single person I‚Äôm still contact regard pandemic. go golfing, parties, go drinking downtown, it‚Äôs fucking joke. Bay well. Every freaking place go one family masks space. You‚Äôve misinformed, sorry! Masks effective reducing transmission disease thus reducing viral load others exposed to. 80% reduction better 0% reduction. Evidence suggest exposure virus may = severe case (among factors).

Masks primarily keep nasty spit snot (nothing personal, mine nasty too) much possible. people aren‚Äôt willing comply protect others. hear doesn‚Äôt protect say fuck it. selfish country. We've 17 straight 1k deaths Texas hospitalizations surging 22 days. Arizona 17 Wearing masks sick cultural norm lot asian countries. see time korea japan even pandemic. honestly great question. sure anybody studied this, give think.

My typical travel speed around 15 mph. riding bike area winds almost never less 10 mph. reasoning condition, air flow around turbulent, believe virus droplets exhale almost immediately disperse air concentrations dangerous. moron, would like think heavy burden soul, highly doubt it.  

After America really needs look mirror worried scenarios thst risky fixed economy.

Take example restaurants. places separation dinner together live together. places enforced. separate groups inside group matter live together not. also true bars seat. reduced capacity according rules, distance tables space per person on.

My hope reducing capacity separating different groups menus anymore allowing extra outdoor space spread limited enough people know other. easier contact trace given conditions.

In end math. Since cannot eradicate find medium sustain close zero spread occasional outbreaks control. monitor enforce small red zones needed.

I see alternative. would really helped leadership didn‚Äôt deny airborne virus. screaming diamond princess days downvoted mute every time. Check history don‚Äôt believe me. Please. Less social distancing standing closer arms length 4 people (min)? Probably 8-10 within 6ft. right wing media. sensible suggestions non right met l‚ÄùIT‚ÄôS cONSTITUTION! Hnnnng!‚Äù ""Over here""? Damn.. Nevada next hot spot?
Or place keeps virus circulating throughout states honor sharing story. ancestors live us. Carry wishes. sure would want spread story everywhere. even one person changes behavior result saved, suffering find meaning. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre marking kinds deaths Covid19 get funds!‚Äù JC read stupid conspiracy theory again. guess can‚Äôt die Covid already didn‚Äôt kill first. creepy site.

But, seems like present evidence didn‚Äôt contribute did. 

You don‚Äôt need ask protest attendance know protests contributed higher infection rate. 

But, even so. explore state Massachusetts, set testing sites specifically people attended protests. infection rate same. 
 
Again, can‚Äôt help want remain ignorant what‚Äôs going here. I‚Äôm regular meetings state‚Äôs Department Public Health. I‚Äôm member task force made respond pandemic office meets regularly board epidemiologists.

Everytime someone bitches wear mask grocery store want tell think people working warehouses (like me) continuously wearing masks 8-10 hours manual labor, medical staff, even grocery store employees. don‚Äôt like either it‚Äôs keep others safe I'm sure US government *increased* astroturfing point would noticable though, that's pretty steady awhile, anything feel like we've fallen behind drowned since 2016. wrong, feel free ignore move on. I'm interested ""Well, technically..."" conversation. confirm, hospital right (not COVID). visitors allowed :(. governor telling wear mask, basic fucking human decency is. masks political thing. wear mask you‚Äôre true conservative. towns US people saw wearing mask you‚Äôd shamed. This! Edibles way go. also last hours hours give good hard sleep (although supposedly THC suppresses REM sleep I‚Äôm narcoleptic actually need REM suppressed YMMV one) Maybe appeal individualism instead complaining they‚Äôre collectivist enough.

Like, wear mask go out, it‚Äôs ‚Äúcivic duty‚Äù. know well community doesn‚Äôt give fuck would screw without hesitation. protect myself, know can‚Äôt trust community protect me. I‚Äôm really terrified impacts economy next years. doesn‚Äôt seem good. staying everything opened valid option I‚Äôve never seen many jobless once, it‚Äôs really freaky know japan low population density everyone spread never contact other... wait. great message, little much jesus CDC fixed test results yet combining antibody tests regular ones? data still good enough. Texan, fuck Abbott. happen. Phase III trials begin summer. ramp production fall everything goes right (which never happened) available January/February. even it‚Äôs going deployable 350,000,000 Americans once. long way yet go. secure job, blaming for? saying still job isn‚Äôt bragging, I‚Äôm helping family members lost jobs stay afloat, don‚Äôt mind, it‚Äôs bullshit even situation.

I tried repeatedly tell worst yet come listening coworkers me. he‚Äôs beginning realize right.

I don‚Äôt rub face though. gently remind take mask, wear goes anywhere, make sure hand sanitizer truck. 

He knows know right it‚Äôs hard admit don‚Äôt care gloat. knowing he‚Äôs finally taking seriously good enough me. Yea, I‚Äôll say federal government much worse. Thanks advice :) Everybody clapped, 100 dollar bills rained sky.

Obama there. Spend time Swedish coronasubs forums then. still lying Chinese wet market Bat Meat jerky Wu Han Flu many sheeple would Praising Trump stripping Americans freedom travel outside country, putting people travel business work, destroying travel businesses, etc...


But virus n U.S. evolved Faux News Flu according sheeple. travel work restrictions sheeple unwarranted Pople want either mention protests rationalize somehow effect COVID spread.

Basically take people's opinions seriously. zero integrity practice preach.  set aside rights, taken away never recovered. government wants take away rights, never give back. obligations fellow man second rights. Yes, people weak brained think shaming society wearing masks shutting everything make sense already know spread symptomatic carriers. idiots killed Covid patients ventilators put covid patients nursing homes. 

And brain get mad say ""that's true! spread people PREsymptomatic!"" Yes, 55 hours showing symptoms. Yes, that's symptomatic carrier.

How many kids developed symptoms? What's point putting kids masks?


Now brain gets really angry logical, emotional. trained get angry people questioning masks.

So go ""stop selfish put mask might kill someone."" Triggered. comment applies GOP general. Don‚Äôt think comment bit premature? spike deaths yet. Maybe everybody else chill fuck wait couple weeks see big apocalypse you‚Äôre hoping for. 3% fatality that's 1000 dead Floridians cases alone. hard simply stop going restaurant awhile rest 2020? haven‚Äôt I‚Äôm enjoying home cooked meals. know unfortunately right people got together burned mail-in ballots demonstrate... something. ...but still allow people take masks eat provided snacks give everyone. So, flew couple weeks ago amounted everyone around flying whole time mask nursed water. worry time.

America - I'm sorry say, news many, joke. Look last 4 years. Embarrassing. according lot people know area, think missed economic opportunity lol  That's one hell price tag.  offering free laboratory software pool testing several months, see great results improving capacity laboratories. many countries authorized pool testing yet, labs ask us certify program, pool testing process whatever else certified allow use it. **Blame television education raised generation parents trusting Twitter tweets, comedy talk shows, impassioned speeches YouTube critical thinking process checking sources own, trusting ThisNews extreme opposite Breitbart, leads echo chambers drive dumbest decisions.**  never said allowed business even government building without mask, that's pointless strawman.

If business makes masks mandatory, power em, shop plenty online options finger tips.

I'm talking people demanding government step force people wear masks make business's enforce authoritarian bullshit. hard see happening current governor Florida though Same. Still received mine, though filed April bit later you. 2018 return alone qualify, 2019 return shows do. looks it, I'll file next year collect stimulus way despite full-time student zero income üòë idea updated info used...the IRS antiquated system. Anyone wearing mask NYC protests offered masks others many people passing supplies, masks, hand sanitizer etc. sound like haven‚Äôt actually Except Ticino going rogue.

Most badass thing Ticino since Sonderbund. haven‚Äôt gone much, plan share thinking. gone restaurants gatherings family friends worn mask cases. chances someone age group people would go low. I‚Äôm likely die getting hit car. grocery store public, especially around around older people wear mask. stayed home alone 2 months saw anyone. know pandemic serious. also know might never go away vaccine, vaccine many months away. whole time people keep saying ‚Äúwait things get better, delay reopening‚Äù. keeps getting pushed. 

At point appropriate go back life? entitled don‚Äôt like idea locking away home like (best case scenario) February possibly never? necessary imprison indefinitely might get infected could conceivably pass someone could die? 

What happens restaurants bars theaters it‚Äôs decided nobody go them? happens people lose jobs result? happens economy? 

I see point waiters, honestly younger 65 taking small safety measures probably ok. absolutely need protect older workers workers underlying conditions, can‚Äôt happen businesses don‚Äôt exist. 

I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs selfish prioritize personal happiness information coming suggests older populations really ones significantly risk. protect them, mean lock indefinitely deal costs indefinitely result. 

If vaccine coming August would different, it‚Äôs not. end sight. long expect people wait? long feasible wait? It‚Äôs 3 months. I‚Äôm sorry, without end date site I‚Äôve enough. Ok show proof. Show noone got riots got bars.


This virus going avoid infecting good intentions. ‚ÄòMurica ... forget zeros?  averages daily cases still falling though community spread vs known cases better awhile ago. 10 okay people distanced. 

It blows mind Country two days ago 380 new cases states 40k. 8.5x population 105x new cases. (Can't look yesterdays numbers Quebec deciding report, tuesday likely worse). think joke edgy I‚Äôm I‚Äôm serious. wouldn‚Äôt want live anymore lost one senses. people might able put it, definitely fucking me. Especially lose smell taste. won‚Äôt want eat anymore. Agreed. think it‚Äôs also silly say bars/hair salons causing cases protests. protests thousands people country gathering everyday, throughout day night, staying close together yelling/being proximity. protests went long time. supposed believe effects protests negligible apparent ? timeline symptoms hospitalizations line protests. spikes expected protests. Blame reopening? states open month protests saw surge. protests clearly spread going fact dismissing ‚Äòparties‚Äô worrisome, protests literally represent you‚Äôre supposed pandemic - ignore social distance. 

So send message people protests don‚Äôt cause spread bar dangerous, it‚Äôs message hang mass crowds worry. 

But sides argument funnel one solution - wear mask, keep distance. can‚Äôt keep distance protest bar. peace, hmu read Hard pass. Fix country trying ruin ours. Well yes, one argue taken account. Probably try make rules simple objective possible. There's definitely risk spread starting see interesting data transmission protests. 

It appears outside wearing mask (both together one) large group social distanced could still see rather low transmission rates. Massachusetts released findings day decent sample size 17,000 tests 450 returning positive, however claim translate data locations, Massachusetts rather high mask uptake. See statistics protective mask needs order slow spread rates interesting subject well. Realistically mask needs capable enough drive transmission rate level virus can't pass effectively enough people increase carrier numbers population. [Dr. Atul gave interesting interview NPR subject see expected happen,‚Äù Bethune said, acknowledging first time inevitable increase.

So deaths hands make lunatics go even insane. 

‚ÄúSee government telling us forcing us wear masks! It‚Äôs trying control us‚Äù sounds right. I‚Äôve guessing 0.3-0.6%. dollars lives kind Governor. virus loves politicians like this, especially state called ""God's Waiting Room"". county adamant indoor dining......

Great job protesting everyone, fucking idiots. responsible can‚Äôt tell difference sub /r/wallstreetbets sometimes love true. surged Austin Houston. sites looting, protests. embarrassing CRIMINAL. missed major reasons:

4-The CDC crystal clear social distancing [still keep **6 feet** others. cloth face cover **not substitute** social distancing.
And yet people ""callous cold, wanted children act belligerent"" get way instead trying safer forms advocacy, held massive shoulder-to-shoulder protests 50 states anyway, caring hurting others actions angry, largest major cities dangerous, weeks reopening businesses (which multiplied risk factor really **worst** thing pandemic standpoint, people coming disparate areas, crowding together, screaming,"" transmit virus easily, said Dr. John Swartzberg, clinical professor emeritus infectious diseases vaccinology University California Berkeley School Public Health. *""And they're going back communities.""*

5-This flagrant violation social distancing covered daily, almost universally *praised* even people stressing dangerous mass gatherings were. concerns dismissed, defense ""they wore masks"" (not even true), ""only 3% infected"" (despite national average &lt;1%), outrageous claim ""systemic racism"" *more* dangerous pandemic already killed **25,000** black reason protest unless want facilitate people dying cause, lot **more** people trying save. FACT opinion.

6-Because praise mass gatherings, political defense ""wearing mask matters"", obviously people ever going conclude social distancing important anymore. Count number times see social distancing even mentioned even sub, compared mentions masks. whenever mentioned, condemn businesses *never* protests largest violation all. tells people concern political partisanship causes people forgive crimes people ""on team"" politicizing issue accuse of. beyond asinine masks social distancing become partisan points contention need **both** chance succeed. really think insulting people wearing mask going convince them? harden resolve? think defending protesters ignoring social distancing going help take need seriously? Obviously not, anybody actually cares pandemic must quit blame game advocate civil discussion, arguments. Wow. would suggest mayor goes frolics tourists beach. way dumb ones get sick together. Yes that's definitely malice.

Houston huge protest Plus, precautions taking, killed twice bad flu season already accurately sums everything wrong America.  Pretty sure mask would cheaper. prove doctors treated well

Doctors treated well, see many people still go quack doctors really care/uneducated science. honestly think Indians religious, superstitious, doctor india whole neighborhood

You confusing prestige science. nothing people respecting science cmon kidding there's reason every parent india forcing kid doctor, engr, mba.

Lawyers too. care science. jobs easily make money. hate you‚Äôre right. :-( Come take it. people claiming massive nationwide BLM protests effect might full sh\*t. One big drawback reporting process know tests administered. lab backlog could given week ago results finally reported. case probably even worse looks. scenario work, need basically lifelong. Otherwise catch repeatedly get higher mortality bands.

And yeah, basically presumes inability develop vaccine effective global suppression (eg, remains recalcitrant endemic state). masks? respect, sounds like argument printing money.

Agreed non recognized revenue compelling feature, however there's argument - valid belive - simply actualizing future debt.

Spicy tacos well came ask Utah big enough many cases without significant worry. Thanks stats! greatly appreciate :) DeSantis' cell mate. guys comfort cute fairy tales. 

You understand FL probably going surpass NY's highest daily rise cases tomorrow, NY already locked point, right? Keep blaming minorities though, that's DeSantis does. How's working him? Yes, may take really doesn‚Äôt look like loss smell comes permanent structural damage Deaths lagging indicator. It‚Äôll take another week two catch up. No, that's next step. filed taxes later usual, would've expected something now. really okay go people area cry counting conspiracy time. Someone personally know says every death counted Covid-19 death. Also say people test positive test drive numbers. person know Osha says masks work. governor leaving individual counties, although urges require masks, mandate it. Pilate move governor. He's washing hand saying blood hands mine. speaking whole year total versus partial year covid? also said ‚Äúnot two weeks‚Äù. armed freedom fund protestors invaded state buildings tx fl keep governmnt locking again? gentleman know hospital 22 days NYC. completely thought hospital 3 days total. Locked getting political. Appreciate hard thread like get political everything useful that's going said removing rest comments overwhelmed likely benefit keeping open. Bullshit ‚Äúpeople tested‚Äù 

On like third graph

Come bro...stop gaslighting I‚Äôm afraid thing happening Texas AZ happening CA too, we‚Äôre week behind tests hospitalizations sky rocket. San Diego looks like exponential growth phase may starting take off. Percent positives something percent hospitalizations triggering warnings. 

But San Diego we‚Äôre surrounded sides counties/countries outbreaks. Orange, Imperial, Mexico neighbors.

We‚Äôve mask requirement since beginning. spike NYC many places huge protests. stop eating dicks. Possible we've yet see comprehensive study asymptomatic impacts body. right now, papers surrounding topic reused dataset Diamond Princess. I'd like see data draw conclusions that. seems mostly obvious.

The protesters tend actually smart wear masks.

The bar flies party animals taking covid seriously. fact probably acting like taking safety precautions.

That's need shutdowns cases, awkward might economically, socially. terrible take. like asking work? 7-11 sell slurpees? seem going correctly though, player safety top priority. Remember, nba play, no-one gets paid.. handful athletes live pay-check pay-check well.. Yes, stated another way.

Taken brilliant statistician chair risk based comms Cambridge. [http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/\~david/](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~david/) He's bad, bad man.  good dude.üòÅ 7 months get 500k deaths, math next 6months, 1million covid deaths December. US culture brainwashes people birth see successes failures, pains joys, lens choices, never question capitalist system fundamentally broken skewed toward tiny ruling class.

The relevance being, culture precisely want us thinking terms community obligation solidarity. kind thing dangerous capitalism imperialistic expansion. individual rights thing critical part capitalist propaganda. individual rights community rights individual choices.

If peoples' individual rights way infringed upon, even good community cause, capitalist narrative starts break. Suddenly peoples' choices entirely own, selfish goals. Suddenly people part community, working together toward common goal. look around start realizing need capitalist illusion individual choice products cope universe fine solidarity other.

That's happened. spoiler film? Cause havent watched yet point need federal government order masks mandatory across nation. US doesn't, situation spin control already is.

If one person stubborn. No, Arkansas. Hardest hit/most populous area. Nobody give shit Texas starts giving shit itself. follow whatever Texas does. didnt die COVID dont count. Lots people die way hospital. dont list death stuck traffic. someone hospice dies infected coronavirus, eason died reason already going die. coronavirus still would died. distinction dying dying from. many people saying isnt. Like grandma? She'll constantly repost shit like, back 2011 monument defaced event happened 're shared' spun current events.. crap like ""We take country back! Time put gloves!!!'

 frail 60-70 year old women shares like gonna go punch people. instantly believes crap reads Facebook like instantly true misinformation farmer said everyone locked houses would burnt weeks. I'm trying mean looking comments think talk someone. ppl get ill ill die. Great prediction. Turns month correct. never going finish first wave, it‚Äôs going one big ongoing wave. replies good also hospitals gotten better treating it. Patients 4x less likely die [according People realize bars restaurants operate razor thin margins. 

Most restaurants shutdown within 5 years opening competitive enough.

You simply cant operate 50% capacity. well could considering pneumonias take months recover people recover fully eventually. Main thing take slow recovery immediately go back usual activity. Well, guess they're talking spike first derivative, makes sense you. mayor can‚Äôt that, Texas. Recent events suggest line thinking plain wrong. appears completely sane conclusion, reality proven otherwise. beach packed, bars restaurants too. town ain't big enough two us (covid health) New name Trump- *Bubble Boy*. Oh no, politically inconvenient facts again. celiac disease allergy  Look places use masks right way.. lot less cases deaths live Conway. sucks filling hotels packing restaurants important us locals.

Imagine safer travel vacations again..less Karens vacation destination banned covid! Every fucking time go produce dairy room Costco!!! stand glasses like 5 minutes lenses warm back don‚Äôt fog bad put back on...but still wear damn mask. Yeah probably.

Deaths undercounted many places well. road trip right now, I‚Äôd pack shewee. If, sanity prevails, seeing fans stands summer 2021. guess people protest shelter home order, right? also help there's incompetent president charge. Experts experts everywhere sides. beautiful watch unfold. wear mask, respect friend lost family, also say blindly follow actual experts parrot shit bad ppl ignoring science. Masks, via experts, answer beginning. are. us common sense knew whole time masks would help. might stop tiny ass particles, they'll surely stop some, they'll keep touching stupid overrunning mouths. Wash hands, wear mask, stay home advanced risk, stay away risk. figure keep economy dying wait vaccine. dont stop living. sides points, middle ground. many surgeries lead someone ICU period time, also frees manpower supplies course confirmed cases increased testing did, missing before. ICU cases deaths continue dropping, things improving. 1.4 billion went dead recipients. much went corporate America?

The money going people goes corpse (heh) anyway, we'll spend it. to. Oh fuck think argument actually pushed 'No Mask' side.


Government officials business telling need rights. IDGAF circumstances are, let foxes get say chickencoop security. threatened murder people took object away said thought human lives worth less said object.

You allowed butterknife, let alone firearm.

People like ideology espousing US rapid decline. Even ICUs fairly profitable, pandemic like one come around often (fortunately enough), building excess capacity may sit unused generations. equipment costs money maintain replace staff cheap either.

Preparing pandemic simply profitable thing do. Seriously though. don‚Äôt know many new cities becoming hotspots finally convince Americans fact real one immune  mistake. thought least protocols made, plans worst case. view northern germany often surprised, thinking that's troll post, must troll post, nobody stupid, shit troll post. I'm sorry. Well, idiocy America continues. Mask wearing law Palm Beach County, FL, Walgreens employees told management deny service ignoring law. visited store West Palm Beach minutes ago informed management people coming door without masks despite law. Employees told management specifically told deny service. corporations equally culpable spreading virus Florida. Stock market well gauge well everything else going. wouldn‚Äôt expect to. don‚Äôt strike sort works self assessment. They'll protest streets 'meh freedoms,' spread more. There's lot Congress help states need do.

But states extra shitty. need perfection. Absolutely none. efficacy. right wing friends it‚Äôs conspiracy. never waste crisis. feel somehow way take control remove peoples rights. One kept saying exactly playbook it. Good movie mistake. thought least protocols made, plans worst case. view northern germany often surprised, thinking that's troll post, must troll post, nobody stupid, shit troll post. I'm sorry. ones two probably stole masks ones wearing them. logical explanation. Except logic doesn‚Äôt seem prevalent days idfk Stop wining get another job. Backslash s. Bold move. US. Ah, rounding large numbers asymptomatic individuals COVID-19 testing. Certainly nothing go wrong approach. Trump Fauci geniuses.  remember days like 30,000 back March. really shot quickly We‚Äôve known people way likely create cluster others, study doesn‚Äôt change anything frank Natural selection. countries won‚Äôt even let Americans visit right now, much less move there. case wondering people fell priorities list, we're statues. fucking dumb.  long term follow ups done? thought BASE vaccine studied, modified COVID version it‚Äôs true. San Diego protests started. Yes people wearing face coverings. Definitely social distancing though. I‚Äôm even sure understand people think face coverings effective you‚Äôre yelling screaming. you‚Äôre wearing N95 mask virus still get through. people forgotten videos two months ago showing various different masks subsequent spray? Yes face covering better none. acting like it‚Äôs bulletproof vest nonsense. People want badly protests vector. it‚Äôs reality. news, wAtEr WeT first large gathering advocating activities cause infections. 

Easy. Encouraging others kill TOS. What‚Äôs plan again? First force wear masks , inject them
With tracking vaccine , take guns bibles. Finally turn kids gay.

That‚Äôs plan right? /s Exactly. One looks things like 'Tegnell says go back work mild symptoms even tested positive COVID' mind boggles someone could *stupid* remember: he's stupid, he's calculating least perhaps recently *still* obstinately trying work towards herd immunity. Getting people mild symptoms go back work probably still somewhat contagious makes perfect sense herd immunity context. wants keep line flat. sure, relatively high run right limits Swedish health care handle. also add downplaying number infected people reassuring people ""safe""....

Absolutely. also Swedish discussion one places left world ""DoN'T SpReAD PAnIC"" narrative still dominant theme. can't people staying *too* much herd immunity strategy go planned. it'd go planned anyway since thought it'd spread like flu doesn't. assume trying stop spread virus, failed. assume trying reach herd immunity quickly possible, failed, thousands people paid price.

Exactly. Frankly even assume (as have) wanted practice modern day √Ñttestupa save pensions they'd *still* fail since whatever save pensions they'd lose several times cohort previously healthy young people long term disabilities require assistance result. 

So dunno, maybe *are* bit ""stupid"" way really smart tecnocrats get seize solution looks good paper work real world. seem schizophrenically cling turns lurching towards brand new experiment well TTI work high caseload others. 

Whatever case is, massively failed Sweden. saw [this pic today hope kind thing becomes common charge face consequences. probably big ask though hey never know. feel bad gym owners employees. else do? Anyone super spreader fill room virus, especially cardio. people going wear masks running treadmill, masks perfect. Especially people nose out! unrealistic. except life next several years forever? take precautions want, government won‚Äôt anything people don‚Äôt give shit, nothing going get better. So....? supposed here. south super unhealthy overall Florida hundreds thousands millions old people moved north. want anyone get sick, Karma balance one gatherings complain. Covid total deaths would quadruple end year. Doesn‚Äôt seem likely seeing far we‚Äôve come learning kills treat it.  data would spikes cases cities biggest protests.

atlanta daily cases doubled, google southern state reopened early üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

you can't make shit General rule: possibly care less think. contracted virus yet? party personal responsibility... mainstream media outlets try tell protests spread virus contribute current surge all, call bullshit.

There agenda play everything politicized. remember ""Coronavirus"" bunch viruses normally cause nothing cold. one variant. really, really bad variant, course. like something completely novel like Ebola. beginning, thought China would cases, literally jailed anyone even acknowledged existence, plus knew little virus. 

How America top even though know **how virus spreads** **how stop spreading**? That's good. really works that's implemented everywhere. wish someone could quantify risk. 10% patients lingering complications? 50% Good idea. Let's share small confined workspace toilets other... see graphite, there. Um, Los Angeles didn‚Äôt big protests? cases country. That's telling statistic. Can't argue increase testing. guest! guest!

I would probably wipe everything soap water worry much. Soap kills virus quite effectively.
Leave stuff dont immediately need 3 days want sure.
Maybe wash hands bit often first days. Conclusion using words might I've noticed health departments (local) post detailed information dates deaths lag lot.

The city Houston posted number deaths week dated back first week May. That's good question.

Waves virus rebounding but, instead, returning population via travel. unusual second waves slightly different genetically, too. everyone handed $2k/month, price everything goes accordingly $2k/month becomes worthless. pure fantasy think UBI magic solution. Yeah learned Spanish Flu kept degree ever since. Masks daily wear there. seem like good idea causes larger outbreak! Especially persons commute public transit. Coincidence? think so! I‚Äôd rather hoisting bodies high rise windows. Head first. satisfying sound must make. planning working I‚Äôd free ever need volunteer.  Spear like marshmallows whip edge.  Toss belongings dumpster burn. like never existed except briefly skid mark street. that‚Äôs take comfort happiness in. Knowing truly worthless many peoples lives are. plenty video photographic evidence able make informed inferences, though. 

How Phoenix regarding mask wearing? Phoenix didn‚Äôt mask mandate June 20th, could possible number people wearing masks protests wasn‚Äôt high cities already mandates place. don‚Äôt live Phoenix, really don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs going mask wearing social distancing, I‚Äôm curious know you‚Äôve seeing. lots doomers acting like catching virus immediate sentence permanent debilitating lung tissue damage. Like.. come now. true wouldnt many people getting without noticing Note 50% diagnosed patients != 50% infected Ouch! Abbott fucking moron. Press X dpobt Yeah trump's idiot.. level paranoia reached insane levels President enables actively feeds it. would excellent. Schools get shut pay teachers. Perfect plan. school district appreciates sacrifice. Less better, know enough virus quantify like that. Exactly. hope that‚Äôs case, looking around many aren‚Äôt. place near called put n bay packed like sardines people partying cares world. large portion population elderly like Italy I'm mistaken. even impressive. less dumb nose-out mask wearers. Thanks reporting back! Glad people generally good agree great situation anyway. starvation wage. Government needs step extend it. virus contained people still struggling get old job back find new one. Oh makes sense. Either way agree people screaming medical condition able wear mask quite frankly full crap r/FloridaMan I'm angry people wearing masks Michigan even though mandated grocery stores venues. wear can't risk target (Cystic Fibrosis), I'd love imagine John Cena, Terry Crews, Dave Bautista wearing around. think obligated educate compassion understanding. Goddamn, hardest thing world. hear nothing PTSD suicides former military. I'm shocked one funny true. consider glasses fog up. good indicator mask poor fit. slide small piece copper wire top mask, allow create seal top. breathing mask, around edges. wear reading glasses sunglasses too. Even find virus enter eyes, good reminder rub eyes. watched tons videos livestreams protests, looting and, rioting majority looters didn‚Äôt masks around necks, chins etc. still knew Karen‚Äôs society defended would try tell everybody masks social distanced. millions Americans watched videos saw didn‚Äôt.

Less great still equal death matter spin resident president. think revolution funded wealthy fought poor? surprised many alcoholics go cheap bars noon uh, realize often delay testing, right? need look total number tests reported day, total number tests completed day. way get consistent amount, includes backfill previous days. Well one big pile shit. U used work somewhere imported bunch developers.  Since 90% sucked, ones still India must really bad. place quantity quality programmers/testers cogs could swapped out.  best testers know can't program worth damn vice versa. Holy shit sub roller coaster. Yikers man lips... mean. virus certainly less deadly still need see bad situation get case spikes southern states. early tell fewer cases require hospitalization.

As saw several hard hit areas, hospitalizations lagging time behind cases. still get ugly. Must us NY NJ know people got seriously sick died. Makes lot harder believe hoax. times like these, need authoritarian leadership, that's going happen suffer. believe Trump loses election, new admin likely 180 terms managing pandemic. there's glimmer hope. Mask wearing political FINALLY, study evaluates use ""test-and-treat"" strategy positive results.

Other studies demonstrated HCQ significant toxicity **severe** disease though.. pertinent conclusions studies though drugs contraindicated organ failure given organs failing. 

It really rocket science. Last yrs flu shot missed nasty type B flu. Started Oct. put many people risk Last yr wearing mask. Like said, wear one rest life unless feel 50k deaths acceptable. covid assume 100k minimum per yr flu/covid thru next 5 yrs. Maybe get hazmat suits. suit rest life quite likely spread type deadly pathogen suit hazmat? Selfish? jailed folks refused acknowledge significance kept telling public ""the risk remains low"" almost two months. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 30 youngers dont parents, grandparents older relatives? exist own? Bullshit.

Its spiking every city protest ..philly hundreds cases.


The narrative falls apart realize thousands protesters outside open air....actually go Inside eat, piss shit get infected.

Anybody denies fact moron willfully ignoring facts. Keep protesting idiots whole countries fault, certain states. Mainly south. simple. Someone unleash murder hornets good, long keep case load hospitalizations seem reflecting that. talking crazy wanted hear....

die covid

or live rest life million dollar hospital bill cant pay top get regular treatment damage caused.....that job/insurance get better.....


this bears introspection part excuse Major Texas metro areas checking in. little lower rest said mask compliance protests I've attended anywhere else I've (that require them). Probably around 80%. include user deleted mod removed both?

""&amp;gt;Instagram users mostly toxic reddit users much nicer. least that's observed.""

If mods only, mean, fuck guy, right? grocery store delivery available costly.

Have NG doorstep grocery delivery staples. one get exactly want, suck up. Italy doctors reporting well. UMPC also states something similar.  forget WWE, somehow stayed open essential business, disallowing fans attendance wearing masks, telling employees testing positive COVID-19 tell anyone. Bold assume anti-facemaskers read same.  Common sense would tell safe way go life right  tracing Phoenix outbreaks bars Scottsdale, protests

'An entire week' long. statewide curfew well. states longer sustained protests spiking.

Anyone intellectually honest trends notice something: spikes happening places hot. hot people went inside socialize. number progress positively. Flew Delta last week. confirm, everyone wearing masks. Indeed, almost untraceable scenario, impossible find solid proof. That's also need use common sense. post still news even though fit narrative sub. wear mask part fact ppl sub completely ignore deaths 1k 17 days straight, Texas hospitals surging headlines 22 days now. CDC Penn State estimate 10 20 million us infected. wilfully continue see negative ignore everything else. good day, wear mask. sucks people protest global pandemic, nothing changing communities. Everyone know went protests wore masks. None gotten sick. now...my local grocery stores toilet paper again. 

Abbott moron wheels.  It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs 100% chance get COVID go outdoor bar. I‚Äôd self isolate don‚Äôt think assume you‚Äôll get it. That‚Äôs Martha Mcsally . üòÖ Yea fb feed got lighter.

Nah saw Bill Gates knew quick sort controversial would yield interesting comments funny trolls Contract tracers specifically told ask people attended protest. didn‚Äôt happen? go snopes technicality travesty isn‚Äôt true. pay business stay closed. Lol. pathetic reach. 

I specific request now:

I want form coherent argument, supported facts, self-refuting.

Good fucking luck also like, one asking cement thing face. Wear store hour, take parking lot. Going restaurant, wear surrounded people waiting areas (even better dont eat I‚Äôm talking people dont want wear one all) driving car alone? Don‚Äôt need it. Need wear one work? It‚Äôs going kill step outside take breather. honestly, wear hour kind forget it‚Äôs there. work outside 95+ degree heat don‚Äôt even notice jog (which occasionally) jog, I‚Äôm next anybody take catch breath. It‚Äôs non issue cant understand it. even get cdc telling people didn‚Äôt work first hard know what‚Äôs true, bigger risk? wearing one. guess we'll see. I'm neither data analyst pandemic expert. 

As continues maybe we'll find out. Scepticism good thing stop questioning whatever alternative explanations coming with. weight loss truly terrifies me. cannot afford get sick *any* capacity, pre-existing condition, can't risk dropping 70 pounds 5'6 girl. right-wing Tory mouthpiece. Never say wear mask public. assumed don't. also ignoring anything. fine fine regardless outcome. No. Houston, Texas. wear mask, admit defeat. Union, that's good one ""Time Lag

Deaths ultimate lagging indicator, especially Covid-19. takes several weeks diagnosis patient die. takes time, sometimes weeks, doctors fill death certificates health officials adjudicate deaths. finally added official state tally.

Wait next week! Wow sad. parts world statistics going situation stabilizing. What‚Äôs wrong US? :( guess stupid dead great analogy. We're getting failing grades it. Fauci explained early advice masks saying: ""The public-health community ‚Äî many people saying ‚Äî concerned time personal protective equipment, including N95 masks surgical masks, short supply.""

That's honor. Something short supply America. People really dumb and, apparently, full shit. Churches still open Death rate falling leveling starts increase. 

Death been, always will, lag behind.

When get confirmed test result, don‚Äôt fall dead. get worse, go hospital, suffer ventilator 2-3 weeks, die.

It takes time, doesn‚Äôt happen instantly schedule. yeah imagine opening places people getting drunk spewing saliva place drunkenly yelling laughing friends small crowded areas. That's going spread disease thats spread exact way all. single handily best quick description/analysis I've read American psychology. I've lived 20 years never understood fox news people. brother, house without mask on, alone room - family indoors room him, move interactions outdoors would much safer. stuff think reasonably safe, also stopped disinfecting groceries believe surfaces low risk, found evidence review article really helpful: ""There clear cases COVID-19 fomite transmission found literature. "" go describe possible cases nothing surface definitely culprit. Now, surface lead transmittion really hard track, reasonably common seen least one confirmed case now. also couple hospital researches swabbed surface around positive patients, found viral material, failed grow viable virus lab. hope helps anxiety moving. means vast majority infections directly person-to-person, long people careful masking distancing everyone ok, outdoors 19 times safer indoors according Japanese research. Indoor conversations especially dangerous speaking emit almost much droplets coughing. Take care. like want live see graduate anything. I'm totally okay dying young. 


Wear fucking masks god damn it. Yeah everything set exponential growth time around I'm nova scotia opening Atlantic provinces. new cases since June 9. rough point people dumb kept going threat larger. One grocery store got shut 3 times week infected person showed up. well known people province people shamed.

I'm actually quite thankful population general dumb thought able suppress outbreak area. concern atlantic provinces open Quebec provinces. part province 3 months get go lives semi normal fashion Add Tennessee, North Carolina, Alabama list places riot things common AZ. People state areas hit hard still think flu cold. get man up. get rather hospitals run case need them. mask social distance are. many , many possible exposed ICU. hey great vote xyz November. hardly anyone know even one cases exist them. would love see exaggerated Facebook post made later day saw another thread one count included 'suspected' cases one doesn't. evidence back Oh come it. answer every question reddit ""it evangelicals.""

Bars, restaurants, birthday parties, graduation parties, visiting family.

We see time time again. often drink water asleep night? 93% Americans started using brains ..........I guess wouldn‚Äôt USA anymore. like reporting COVID19 cause death like Iran SaudiArabia doing? kids slightly higher grades approach school same. teachers online like hour day otherwise kids list activities like said.

""Make dance routine 1 minute""
""List ten different kinds animals ocean""
""Do 5 math problems"" reading comment thinking ""please let Tennessee one these.."".

Damnit. poor state handling poorly. Otherwise known symptom Flatten, ignore safety protocols overwhelm hospitals like literally happening. worth noting even production starts there's going complicated politics going gets number doses when. country prioritize citizens becomes complicated start dealing scenario production country vaccinated healthcare workers started vulnerable people key workers yet. give doses country yet vaccinate healthcare workers? doses get delivered country worst case numbers, makes logical sense leadership's fault high case numbers.

Then there's question cost. countries single payer healthcare brainer, course free person, government pay it. becomes complicated countries without that. companies could produce free someone needs cover cost, there's way UK could justify essentially paying Americans vaccinated(or way around) they'd need America pay per dose. US decide whether cost covered government individual, history shows they'll go covered individual. question much. something tells 4th july day celebration... is, one last next weeks/months. 

ready americans/brasilians. stock non-perishable food (beans, rice, lentils, pasta, etc), buy medicine (paracetamol, etc), get vitamins already them. buy masks, avoid leaving house much possible ordering takeaway. use cannabis regularly, better stock too. youre gonna need money muster. next months absolutely crushing trend continues everything points increase...

ready yourselves. 41k cases nothing compared exponential growth lead would relative state live area state. surrounding 4 zipcodes around gym 20 cases Coronavirus since pandemic started think ok. 

Just wear mask go. can't cardio lift weights surgical mask probably middle pandemic. dad same. thinks nobody died worldwide hoax. Luckily I'm minor cant tell do. sucks bad kid figure adults real answers they're reaching blindly are. days, people seem extra stupid. People work telling exaggerating many deaths happened means get reimbursement $ China. Idk earth anyone believes that. boss went vacation Florida (we PA, cases jumped back up...yet) I'm disgusted resentful people community trump flags refusing wear mask. beyond embarrassing, scary, absolutely imagine like teenager right this. keep hands clean try best get close others. Good luck dude! Good know... country willing little uncomfortable awhile uncomfortable months ahead. Hope worth Hospitalizations going roof multiple states reporting 100% ICU use it‚Äôs getting worse.

Death rate falling leveling starts increase. 

Death been, always will, lag behind.

When get confirmed test result, don‚Äôt fall dead. get worse, go hospital, suffer ventilator 2-3 weeks, die. trump didn‚Äôt cancel production emergency machines supposed able produce 1M n95 masks per day context bro, dude talking lockdown still communicate other, Anne Frank lived 2 families hidden part house 3 years communication outside general except hearing news people hiding them, context lockdown, want reply shit said strawman, go right ahead, mean. gonna anyway. Death rate falling leveling starts increase. 

Death been, always will, lag behind.

When get confirmed test result, don‚Äôt fall dead. get worse, go hospital, suffer ventilator 2-3 weeks, die. considering condemnation doctors, experts others 400 people protesting lansing, think they'd also agree blm protests far impactful orders magnitude cycled past 5 fitness centres yesterday, te Netherlands, moved stuff outside, lots room, space, seems like good enough solution me. leaving quite salient details, importantly numbers put together proves testing sorely lacking roughly nine hundred thousand Americans die this.

You might want find better group numbers put together know I‚Äôm tempted get tested. lady tested positive found called wife apologize it. mean nothing wrong. don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going able talk mother law while. millions people protesting streets couple weeks ago. Many without masks. surprised  !putmeincryostasis√óinfinity Yea idiots protesting. need self sufficient everything Th point. rely countries (especially US China) anything since 4 years ago. Self reliant Canada safe Canada. Keep border closed!!! blame him, corona spreading large gatherings thing really came left field. could anyone foreseen happening beyond me. Agree - think outside six feet apart, it‚Äôs safe. problem people don‚Äôt follow rules, especially runners. Runners love cut things close, extra two feet shaving seconds mile time. Ugh, I've seen many 'Living best life' comments past months, often people reckless behavior regarding pandemic.

Can find way poison phrase used constantly anymore? adults co-opt phrase make less cool get kids pick catchphrase life? remember that. People sub like ""oh that's China spinning bullshit trying cover bad prevention efforts."" many smoke breaks take shift? Please tell guys children. USA! USA! country fools. Gravity theory, man. *could* dangerous hell. article says left-wing protesters wore masks doesn‚Äôt mean actually wore them. 

The majority videos BLM protests I‚Äôve seen showed less 50% protestors wearing masks.

Also, current ongoing anti-lockdown protest minuscule size comparison BLM protests past weeks. funny, but, also sometimes known ""Happy hypoxia"".

Where patient low O2 saturation breathless, comfortable nothing wrong. Imagine thinking Elon Musk ever invented anything born billionaire.

How someone learns read, write, work computer, still stupid always baffled me. Fucking lol though. Like, funny, expecting happen exactly?  

Quarantine rules loosened tons people went back behaving like everything's fine. got fuckers wearing masks kind political statement. Give break man. Lmao 5% mortality. people make shit up? muerica, stupid get planet. Looting funds what's happening. Downplay virus people dont question money went. basically social engineered foreign government nucleus taking orders them. reality people denial point. Lack education big factor, old people can't google anything cant think past what's infront internet regards. I'd say 30-45% country falls category. Thanks blm protestors Hey, married one those! husband proclaims going away right election, made hoax democrats. Seriously. live with. Honestly think says often knows pisses off...but still.  Schools county going open 2 days week fall New Zealand worried second week January. talking guys effect would tourism. I've seen, BLM protesters liberal cities overwhelmingly wearing masks, like Boston New York. know Boston least, 2.5% tested protesters diagnosed virus.

It's almost like people saying execute people street self awareness avoid killing eachother plague. brush teeth they're worried bacteria. Lol run along now. cut, kiddo. I‚Äôm proud don‚Äôt even know you. Hospitals filling right schedule. It‚Äôs like haven‚Äôt before. wish would start ‚Äúmaking good decisions ‚Äú Honestly pretty fair card. aspect chance (losing 1 person pretty touch go, even more, would still extraordinarily accomplishment given virus world) arbitrary extra symbolic heft given nature narrative, mean response virus Vietnam significant political accomplishment, well healthcare one workers social one people. 

This absolve Vietnamese government political failures. is. particular thorny job, well done. good. soon testing levels get cut, numbers way down. hugest down.  Hell, even fucking China better US. thing people say they're faking numbers. wait. holes mask large stop virus spreading? small allow air flow. Somebody help me, brain hurts Keep up. Wish people like you! Yeah, aren‚Äôt distancing all. within three feet other. can't get people use turn signals help others road, simple flick finger. think people wear masks save others? Slow testing down, fix numbers... Well Cali, Florida, Texas etc. might! 100% Yea know, unfortunately. 60% US adults chronic disease. 40% 2 chronic diseases time. Healthy adults minority objective fact CDC, yet somehow everyone claims healthy low risk. Obviously wont die, hundred million people impacted disease one way another coming months, it‚Äôs depressing time it‚Äôs like 5-7 months literal constant warning. 

To put perspective CDC estimated 20m total infections day. Let‚Äôs say hypothetically 40% heard immunity completely stops virus dead tracks it‚Äôs reached virus disappear (some say magically... right). would fantastic know that‚Äôs wishful thinking, yet still means we‚Äôre ~15% way there. forget ""the mark beast"". actually says shit without hesitating think maybe spouting ridiculous nonsense. testers collect residence, it‚Äôs likely MD. One MD‚Äôs first cases lady mostly lived Montana MD got hospitalized tested. MD ended classifying infection Montana, shown early covid maps asterisk protests good spread virus, correct. However, many believed important.

Additionally, states experiencing largest growth right states large protests (Cali exception), states typically fought usage masks restrictions pretended everything normal. Many European cities large protests well, spike?

So no, protests blm help, saying ""blm two weeks ago gave us Corona virus now"" demonstrably false.

Now point, blm protests okay anti Covid shutdown protests not? one protest murdered another protest little bit boredom following common sense guidelines.

Equality boredom equal values, equating something can't say post get removed incivility. 300,000,000 doses apparently.
 Well let's report US gone longest time without school shooting! Turns prayer missing school danger schools themselves. /s Lol, used LOVE read. I'm 13 unless birth documents forged lmao Never thought r/Masks4All would needed month, two tops. yeah. Well course wait reopen. They've got stay true motto: Everything's bigger Texas. includes pandemic. still wash hands even though leave house?

Yes, even pandemic, clean hands bad thing. know going happen. many lives saved 20% Americans wear masks public? Everyone said knew cases would go opened things (and testing continues increase). 

How ICU beds? deaths going up? directly facility tested me.  state Australia outbreak. trying test 50% people suburbs cases. People door knocking. Ambulances vans parking end streets tests. developed saliva test rolled make testing attractive. think 50% chance containing it. suspect going back lock future rollback restrictions. got 50 ish active cases. It‚Äôs 200. virus hard contain drastic consistent action required long period time plus containment borders. got called answered facts, plz respond. pretty pathetic position government owned media China criticize us, VALID arguments. often times pass groups four people don‚Äôt appear household

So socially distancing other, real worry here, need really try keep distance, far important masks. die. time Darwin take over. It's..cough..cough...just the...cough..cough..cough..flu bro..cough That's get population value FB opinions science. overrun dumbasses? see trying say, could also testing, people coming get getting tested, argument goes circles. 

The death measure less open debate. government failed country, many citizens well. future probably ruined shit. Sounds awful lot like 2016. They'll come damn timeline since beginning, get head ass. sheer inability Americans understand basic math staggering. 

We fucked lol read answer based think? Yeah, screw teachers want get sick bring home families. There's way new distance learning curriculum created summer months (rather fly) could better sending everyone back school inevitably infect students' families school workers. influence operation hit fever pitch vote manipulation obvious 1-3 month old accounts coming woodwork reddit phd takes.

Mask wearing common areas masks common, less common areas.

There new blooms cities taking seriously despite mass protests (think NYC Boston), implies protests least *have* cause lot cases. 

I surprised least, data sure Trump's rallies - dumb - cause major spikes. think really depends high ceiling much noise crowd makes.

From everything seems something like karaoke bar ultimate superspreader site. Bars opening (and people actually going said bars) showing next proxy huge number cases. 

Summer seem kill disease degree. air conditioned bar 11pm summer far virus tell. Reddit, probably. hard say. 

There's plenty people know real world still downplaying. Otherwise right now. someone please think foggy glasses? /S guy smart all, put 2 things together draws completely outlandish conclusion scientist back up. 

The stuff asymptomatic people lung damage rooted fact. classic doomerism best, downvote want. California careful reopening seeing major spike. Florida less reckless Texas Arizona (let cities enforce mask requirements, slower lifting business restrictions) trajectory. 

Clearly misguided focus economic activity major contributor, factors work health administrations need figure get us place living godawful virus. agree used April benchmark horrible.

However UK said yesterday hospitalization fatality rate April 6%, it‚Äôs 1.5%

The number almost equal across globe. reasons reduction hasn‚Äôt stated, would surmise, new treatment options, potentially also virus become infectious less deadly, course possible, highly likely eventually. That‚Äôs cute. 95% Japanese people aren‚Äôt wearing masks. 95% Americans? going happen. depends. R0, lower 1, things well, regardless whether wearing masks, protesting, etc. There's lot factors, wearing masks one. turned need Netherlands, except public transport. lower compliance rating, could argue people complying compensate extra measures. used $1,200 pay father's $1,400 cremation. Welcome America. could least give elderly front-line workers... TELL them.. Looks slightly likely help... still careful. Thanks info. thank do. surge cases across many age cohorts know vulnerable, know eventually result deaths. may fewer deaths saw April due better treatment, deaths unfortunately.

The fact deaths still declining explained fact it‚Äôs trailing indicator. Unfortunately. don‚Äôt think simple yes answer question. Riding bike outside paved surface, yourself, going 15mph, believe virus dispersed quickly risk infection extremely low. 

Going hiking narrow trails larger group stays together hours can‚Äôt won‚Äôt stay far apart, would recommend mask. from? determined accept covid-19 thing. Freaks. ""If headline asks question, answer no."" apply here, nothingburgers? wallmart made people mask everyone one one family got line people flip fuck dumb ass care. in: Bull Gates points obvious. could developing vaccine years coronavirus emerged less year ago? honestly believe alot downplaying people bots. constant delusional optimism moving goal posts. Wear masks people many people protesting haircuts yelling politicians steps respective Capitol/statehouse? *maybe* ten thousand? Total? literally millions one space time BLM. also went BLM protest nowhere close 100% masked.

Reasoning aside, people congregate en masse global pandemic  R0

You‚Äôre confusing cause effect. 

If people wear masks distance, r0 falls. don‚Äôt r0 rises.  


My state US r0&lt;1.  yet active cases US time high. would completely irresponsible wear mask time, despite local falling r0. wondering. It'll Gates 200%. way learn. losing people close them. Father way, except live northeast (NH) hit hard. much believes ""government ploy"" number cases deaths inflated. Classic case ""didn't happen happening anywhere"" actually can‚Äôt imagine frustrating would you.. would explode. I‚Äôm grateful divide uneducated spastics people common sense greater Australia. 

All best there. Beautiful Russian asbestos moments like blaming politicians voted refusing give even basic social safety net, instead put tinfoil hat perform mental gymnastics believe kind conspiracy.

Brilliant. Shambles human being. I've doubt many well informed people told brain dead plan would turn out. [a pointed first impedes right smoke store. also makes wear clothes. someone Florida I‚Äôm disappointed expect CCP here

I can‚Äôt even imagine bad covid hurricane passing one 2 lives.. 

Actually 120,000 American lives far, [most funny getting ""one two lives"" line way small city worth people died horribly.

How many Americans going die nothing? guess - another 200,000. president one told tens thousands wokester idiots go streets protesting ignoring social distancing. 

Why think new spike lines perfectly incubation period average age infected cut half?

But that's Trump's fault too? Take fucking responsibility. wanted protest thousands die. ‚ÄúToxic individualism‚Äù ü§Æ

Cue Oprah ... get Covid !  get Covid !  Everybody gets Covid!!! It‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt riots means üôÑ Key takeaway people blood group likely risk infection severe disease. blood group lesser risk infection severe disease.

It‚Äôs hard look spikes identify versus protest. also don‚Äôt need know hasn‚Äôt protest see it‚Äôs contributing higher infection rate. 

But, go look Massachusetts too. sites specifically set people attended protests. infection rate remained same. flew american charlotte week ago. pilots, wearing masks, invited two groups kids check cockpit. Later, one pilot, mask around neck, helped old lady seat. Right closed flight takeoff, family ran board (they almost missed flight). panting masks mouths. flight attendant say word. full flight - middle seats all. Ah, ok. know keys quite well wondered heard it.

It's 50 years since took science class, taught this, I'm glad; history science something taught school. either unrelated coronavirus somewhat distant less severe ancestor. wish stupid. Honestly go lives normal. clear neverending protests people going matter lost battle contain virus. let spread bit slowly taking precautions RIP bandaid get faster. matter what, gning get eventually. Sweden 40% deaths come nursing homes.
(Source: FHM weekly report, week 23).

It difficult protect elderly asymptomatic presymptomatic transmissions.

But improved Sweden last week even started recommend face masks care home personnel. Hey look everyone, loon.

I guess half million people died coronavirus pretending, world‚Äôs epidemiologists conspiring personally make virus. Yep, sounds like likely scenario.

Jesus fucking Christ I‚Äôm embarrassed breathe air you. Good thing America already stopped supporting revelation. win yet? argument mass gathering impact transmission coronavirus. objectively false.

You people sick deranged. Spamming post damage control political ideology science tells us virus putting peoples lives risk. Shameful, twisted people. Mask issue, opening soon, protests. It‚Äôs like perfect storm really giving option virtual classroom understand would show test fairly quickly. start presenting symptoms asymptomatic around two week mark. testing it‚Äôs enuff. U need trace, isolate, quarantine potential carriers. Already can‚Äôt detect many symptomatic carriers, least try keep symptoms bay Freedumb Fighter right here, folks. Step right up, $1 gaggle giggle man doesn‚Äôt know basic science! person probably talking ones taking money don‚Äôt deserve exploit workers scream help going gets tough. ones threatening employees regarding infection protocol fire them. Don‚Äôt literal. It‚Äôs ones want pay shit cry go thing workers face daily. Siesta Key Sarasota (more central/west FL) Florida Keys. lot protests northeast see spikes now. Oh wait, spiking look like protests big impact cases. 

I sure COVID-19 spread protests, based numbers, seems driver behind new cases easing restrictions (bars restaurants opening), protests. hear you. main thing protests outdoors, know greatly decreases risk transmission. Couple fact protestors wear masks, actually fairly safe environment.  saying protests contributed cases, think much bigger concern States opened way quickly carelesly allowed people gather indoors without masks distancing.  policy induced crisis, logical thing keep effects real economy strict minimum never even taken US. Canada, businesses forced close recieved paycheck relief funds, emergency cash loans float immediate irreductible expenses like leases, employees could collect emergency unemployment checks without let go - meaning businesses effectively paychecks issued federal government. 

As we're opening again, businesses strict policies attendance numbers, distancing, hand sanitizing. masks part kinda place, restaurants mandatory staff (over Qu√©bec). numbers mostly kept going reopening, might avoid second stay home order things go well.

So all, jobs lost, lot less expecting US steps taken prevent that. know I‚Äôm playing results here, seems obvious me. Restaurants one thing people dining tables. Bars, hand, people close quarters, falling people, spitting talk, hugging, kissing, bouncers grab people kick out.....that‚Äôs happens used go bars anyway. GOP plan gut Social Security Medicare.  enough people care around impact elections cut funding.  &lt;- sure say sarcasm not. Shhhh.

Huh? Nooooooooooooo shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit president know run country left who'd rather go protest/loot instead abiding rules, fuck expect. feel sad moderate americans stuck two sides utter ignorance hypocrisy. think numbers fake too. can't make kind dumb up.

My friend nurse. worked Covid patients. got caught it. 14 miserable days recovering. husband caught her. died 24 days respirator.

Fuck people won‚Äôt even bother wearing mask Dipshit ""rocket surgery""

Stupidest phrase 2020 surprise (not all). agree need people keep mind $600/check unemployment assistance. substantial big reason completely cratered yet, IMO. Unfortunately, expires soon along eviction protections buckle Armageddon soon. next week, Covid-19 eats way arsehole Yeah, acting like moron research? It‚Äôs job teach help stop willfully ignorant. unknowns side effects vaccine year passed. game stack immunity. 


fine dandy get 20% chance catch covid, suddenly everyones kidneys fail **(speculation fact)** 6 months cause largely untested (cause takes time) vaccine?  


I'm anti vaxxer, im anti-rushedvaccine vaxxer, that's thing im getting whatever vaccine get, tbh really want test subject either, want safe, healthy like right rushed vaccine could cause damage good - imagine freaking ammo antivaxxers would outcome damaged someway 6 months something. 


all answers situation suck.  Right. Theres enough real stuff worry without sensationalism. DeSantis called Gods waiting room reason!! also thank Trump One reason I‚Äôll never visit. part problem one answering phones contact tracing calls: 

i know me, rarely answer phone number/name know going see article every day save it? least weed usually consumed crowded bars. share bong though American exceptionalism = Amber Lynn Gilles I‚Äôm trying funny, running alcohol hide pain going eventually amplify pain. Learn cope can‚Äôt control healthy way else you‚Äôll always miserable. Time reopen everything /s We've seen divergence case numbers death numbers testing expanded Lol. Let‚Äôs see link that. Yep, power shut shut thing(even thinks does). Look governors that, instituted lifted lock downs previously. afraid tell soon we'll 1 million cases daily weeks come go increase deaths told wait weeks show. came out, relax. It‚Äôs data anyone else. But. Serious question. people like suddenly care peer review seems like you‚Äôre willing ignore general consensus scientific community? I‚Äôd venture people afraid information challenges beliefs. 

It‚Äôs hard look data see spikes compared protests are. want ignore facts, can‚Äôt help you. Well, keeps might looking death every family. Qualifies book. looks like overblown me. seeing cases time less less deaths. Looks like worst over. Can't let thing stop lives. Jepp... swedish government totally stubborn course currently complains one wants open borders them. follow trump rule many tests hence numbers high, totally forget countries rigorous testing recently, caught up. covid deaths. happened get blood clot killed sick covid. Total coincidence. survey 420 individuals, results, put bluntly, show marijuana use time high. complex issue. lot people dont money babysitters school option states know that. U cant get work force back dont open schools. issues kids bring virus back home. Well Dude, know. late. Anybody got weird feeling matter anybody never going away worldwide protests worth it.

""Stop killing us!"" 
vs 
""I want haircut!""

See difference. FWIW, went BLM protests, damn near 100% masked anyway. elected retard pay price it. tried jogging mask on

Yep. 3 times week. use neck gaiter like article suggests. It‚Äôs comfortable eat elastic me.  keep pulled anyone eyeshot. 

 It‚Äôs big deal. Sure it‚Äôs damp end run. I. Across California, Latinos disproportionately affected COVID-19 ‚Äî 42,000 Latinos diagnosed coronavirus since mid-May, according state Department Public Health. Latinos make majority Californians, ages 18-64, died virus.

57% cases CA Hispanics/Latinos, make 39% help there's cases due protests? What??

BLM cause protests important bars closing, agree. whole point large gathering people still large gathering, matter cause. Leaders telling people stay home large gatherings. BLM ok then. huge music festivals back seeing articles criticizing too, even required people wear masks. MLB going allow fans even though could limit occupancy people could socially distance wear masks. couple examples clear gathering fit political agenda media you. Virus spread well outside BLM protests cause increase cases Illinois 2 people boat time even though live house family 4. people set trust details taken care ahead time. Trusts wealthy. people side reopening despite risk denied treatment risk doctors nurses. floor made floor never was. always puts first.

If goals America's goals lined up, it, never primary concern. Thailand able contain COVID much better Europe US despite poor, populous, direct neighbor China? hopefully February see DeSantis cuffs? First use loans pay bonuses. use parachutes. bad thing even Trump turn dictator making, actions dissolve trust people democracy system. also pave way another dictator. I'm even thinking family... number death frightened rising! need shutdown flatten curve frightened virus. Also remember Victoria mass testing, something like 25k tests per day. Doesn‚Äôt sound much, place population Victoria it‚Äôs lot. say got COVID attend

Indoor parties one dangerous place be. That‚Äôs fanatic! Everyone would something say something least one categories. 

You‚Äôre right politics religion. last family reunion went well different kinds people set aside whole categories conversation. talked older country folks quilting, television programs. Haha Great! pulled 80% ass hearing might need 60% good news. look r/Covid19positive see completely correct. 90 days testing positive, lot people can't even walk around block without feeling exhausted.

These young people teens early adulthood too, old. anyone information vaccine made quantity? One reason Influenza vaccines able made amounts really easy develop inside eggs, I've read anything one. many lives would saved 95% Americans observed social distancing? Leave country then. Go China live Arizona US sentiment here. Foolish governmental decisions, pathetic leadership moronic people wear masks. Nope looked I'm spewing un peer reviewed crap thread like job. I'll wait till studies hard backing come   Alright Bill, already understood want promote yourself. Yah! Wisconsin finally national news, ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è RemindMe! Twenty years Remember seeing called experts saying well normal GPs like ‚Äòoh yeah seems likely‚Äô - kinda blizzard Luckily CDC estimates ACTUAL death rate try like 108 deaths day month town cops aren‚Äôt even masked nothing enforce anything. Literally every business open. handful close little early something. small town gonna rude awakening. Things get better federal funding testing ends days... said big fail corporations spends millions upon millions lobbying put government policy makers pockets? Tell make wills prepay burial expenses...... Little - Covid. even try say cover too. Yeah! non-mainstream media (I.e. extreme fringe media YouTube) telling truth! Wake sheeple! Canada here... they're States.. stooopid people wearing masks to. Idiocy knows borders. Yeah, go back office past Monday. shut door keep double masks day. eating lunch first couple days hard, it‚Äôs fine. lost 6 lbs week. Lol. Yeah, chins.....  manhood Ok then, better carry on, possibility 300,000 day could die. Better absolutely nothing possibility. isn‚Äôt like big deal end happening right? ignoring things aren‚Äôt absolutely certain happen future, encourage worry getting Covid-19. all, isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwill get it‚Äù, it‚Äôs ‚Äúcould get it‚Äù. July 4th UK basically becomes fully open well, yes. I‚Äôve gone cautious staying indoors whenever possible, like beginning lockdown. Fucking hate it. mention, hate liberal New Yorkers. I'm curious, what's overall health? protesters caused Rednecks? wife looking leave. amazing hard get another country. Seems fitting seeing make next impossible everyone else come America. 

Now think it, immigration system like placing bouncer outside golden Corral. hell trying hard get here? even wanna here. Finally admitted huh?

But ok let‚Äôs prove wrong UN too. Got source? lol Florida, positivity rate nearly dooubled. education system working perfectly intended. everyone well educated would right get elected? would churches survive? Hijacking bodies? Humans 0 virus 10 curiosity, what's general health like? could predicted this. rock would rock brain cells governors old people dying cause concern too?

  ""All lives matter. Unless I'm inconvenienced."" teacher also knowledge wisdom yet teacher spoon feed correct? 

Do assignment return finished essay. Thank you. shame say follow science. there‚Äôs rare case dying it. friend‚Äôs cousin - 30s medical issues. got Covid died. need wake realize affect us somehow, young not. takes time die. see immediate correlation increased cases deaths. though people time educate things work still idiotic posts like this. absolutely ‚Äúcentrist.‚Äù Joe Biden full coronavirus debriefing night CNN showing instead? Checking Trump‚Äôs rally, course. Trump outrage sells. Yea, early headlines saw permanent lung damage moment decided going see another human without wearing mask shit I've taken vaccine. right, that‚Äôs good idea. It‚Äôs shame still work work outdoors 4 person crew it‚Äôs significantly safer workplaces. first kid year. Paternity leave end job switched WFH. We‚Äôve basically isolating since February. 

It‚Äôs crazy time kid; say first child pandemic really made experience fatherhood (as well wife‚Äôs experience new mom) different people. 

If gone back work commute gym would dad home 2-3 hours workday go sleep. plan moved closer. 

I can‚Äôt imagine although world scary much needs done feel blessed experience fatherhood like this. post literally US, supposed comment about?.. Whatever money business, don‚Äôt care people spend money point average salary nba 7.7 million. They‚Äôll okay lol think difference that, 9/11, blame foreigners act like victim, this, since US knows fix (because Europe, China, NZ, Australia, many south American countries keeping check way) doesn't, victims, perpetrators, want responsibility comes shooting foot shotgun anyone blame yourself. get me? Yes brown people likely jobs housing forced contact people much higher risk. rude, say ""Hey, so, love catching you, mean offense, there's pandemic happening, I'd appreciate kept distance please.""

If laugh say nothing, worry they're sick, say ""Good, I'm still following advice doctors scientists."" pure nonsense brought great tshirt idea. Image face wearing mask, red X across face. -- freeDUMB 10-12 days estimation point? look numbers have, hospitalizations trail outbreaks weeks, deaths trail hospitalizations weeks. present informs future pretty reliably surge starts.

You'd think couple months ago. mostly quoting general idea Lt gov TX said. basically told grandparents willing die economy. insane. 

Lots people aren‚Äôt grandparents get sick &amp; die this. :( don‚Äôt think understand race is. Perhaps understanding terminology use.

Oh [masks help stop spread wouldn‚Äôt they?! crime. could killing people weren‚Äôt aware he‚Äôs contact with. scientists depite christian, it.

Most countries majority religion children indoctrinated it. 

We need whole lot teaching think instead think. shouldnt acording guys.

Who knows bro changes day. put phone quart sized ziplock, everything still work Could release NOW.. mean.. People suffering..!

The longer wait -- longer suffering.

Mass producing thinking release later time rather now? again, people suffering, better waiting, constantly send whats mass produced. Fat chance that. 95% people work cover mouths, wear chin, wear properly whille they're walking people pull get face face conversation. Trumps end game deaths dropping though? USA USA USA! Hey dumbass, forget ""scientific evidence"" pathetic brain can't even process shit anyway. 


Just look countries wearing masks vs counties period. ‚ÄúBut freedom‚Äù strictly unemployed reduced hours everyone threshhold? Great idea. Though I‚Äôll take cell phone emergencies, never know what‚Äôs gonna happen don‚Äôt use out, it‚Äôs car breaks something. long haired dude Didn‚Äôt even think hairband I‚Äôll start that. never safe.  see way spend money. Bball players least. 

I forgot stat think might 1/3 NBA financially stable NBA resume. 2/3ds not. means densely populated areas city centers high risk spikes, rest country doesn‚Äôt enjoy living top one another likely different reality.

And fear mongering bad it‚Äôs going get happen lower population areas people resent drastic measure taken many cases aren‚Äôt necessary big cities. think everyone refuses comply safety measures last line medical treatment. I'm keeping list score card. usually go government power bunch ignorant yokels want put family risk I'm starting get radical.  ü§î stupid. China biggest economic powerhouse World. dwarfs US almost everything. Trump pulled funding logical China replaced US position. Duh. Also fact produce 90% worlds medical PPE hurt either. No, really, states opened form early-mid May. Incubation 2-14 days, absolutely combination protests opened up. honestly don‚Äôt care anymore COVID 19 Something askew here...

How stupid enough anti-mask anti-vax yet still make far enough life 3 kids job find another retard love enough 3 children you?

This willfully dumb.

I wish could make second earth people like go live on. 5 years they'd dead could 2 Earths. elected (I vote him). stupid election system got elected. worship Constitution, document written white slave owners hundreds years ago. allow propaganda like Fox News Facebook. Therefore, take responsibility Trump's stupidity. Half country thinks genius ffs. No. Sad read. America likely extinguished. dont understand this. right WHAT? O.o definition ‚Äúraging pandemic‚Äù extreme now.  Remember, Taiwan. 7 deaths. like ‚Äúhey, long hospitals handle it, let bodies stack up‚Äù.  idiots used shamed. told opinion stupid stupid. stopped shaming stupidity instead give everybody platform voice dumb ideas. idiots realized there's enough justify whatever dumb belief lazily arrived at. 

It's like obesity. takes work effort stay shape. also takes work effort learn skills knowledge order tackle life. many obese people today's society vs healthy people? virus could pick choose idiots.

If suddenly pivoted went ~~rich old~~ white men, see government public opinion change masks real quick obligation anyone, especially tyrants try use force make live way want. better comparison would South Korea Taiwan particular argument. Japan shut downs, also little covid testing numbers aren‚Äôt especially reliable, least time being. point. country wide level, hospitalization rate death rates way APril/May. know situation specific states. biggest fear...were lockdowns lifted prematurely. even states locked FASTER. :/ im illinois back normal. people listening. think over. slowly creeping back :( 

we're fucked Bet. expected first generation spike rushed back - younger people seeing. problem people don‚Äôt live vacuum - infection nodes means opportunity community spread, might nearly kind it‚Äôs selection criteria. Higher reported numbers New York. New York millions actual cases, seen 30k deaths. 

As Florida test ascent curve, case numbers dramatically larger. knew.

They claim taking precautions.

Looking photo saw pressed together, doubt definition precautions.

But article said staggered arrival times one woman cancer sat porch sick grandma stopped long enough drop present.

Course, I'll bet lot hugging. indoors. host one sick infected house. Yes, symptoms cancel wear mask figured allergies.

Clearly social distance. wear masks. indoors. stayed hours 10 minutes considered sufficient contact time.

Of course got sick. BBQ picnic outdoors everyone spread apart touching. fucking shit. protestors think would happen. Bro really care, I'm living country misgendering someone deemed hate crime COVID number one. due time see effect big ass protests. Mar Largo probally hot zone right now. wish nuts profit it. Blm ppl everyone else except anti mask crowd  think Trump talking patients nose kept lighting glowing red Dr Faucci Dr Brix used Baron Trump's board game Operation explain things President. dad used smart, he‚Äôs gotten crap makes Fox News look tame, sure is. He‚Äôs goes Bill Gates working China create virus microchip everyone. It‚Äôs crazy seeing media done country. I‚Äôll agree part that. people genuinely know better sincerely asking case it'd better community educate them. 

How able tell apart who‚Äôs sincerely asking CO2 levels mask usage won‚Äôt kill debilitate vs. someone who‚Äôs concern trolling? Shit, like almost thousand yesterday! least death rate still low, although way virus works, deaths happen right away. people go out, protest wreck streets, go party. Yup. straight old man shit internet better barrier entry higher. actually able figure access navigate internet.

Now every dipshit extra hundred bucks cell phone participate fucking awful. Really wasnt bad got point social media became popular among boomers. didnt grow age process much information quickly straight cannot fall prey kinds whackjobs dumb ideas. Yeah sounds right. Americans really good finding 'enemy' put blame on, that's exactly happened 9/11. right people blame ourselves. lot Americans blame China covid, argument *some* merit, possible blame China shitty response US pandemic. blame government Americans enabled current administration voting trump.

I'm genuinely unhappy American right now. Testing basically means cases caught earlier well lag grown. Yeah understand honestly it‚Äôs still relieving even hear someone partially take responsibility politics. situation real shit sandwich matter decide take bite someone going call idiot. said, pretty fucking obvious opening bars midst pandemic bad idea. Pressure business owners politicians probably overwhelming. would hate position. say though, I‚Äôve really let people. really thought things opened people would cautious avoid groups. wife right, again. know might remove stain??? 

Bleach. 


But also probably ruin clothing unless stark white begin with. meh...no big deal!! keep running people northern illinois keep saying FLLUUUUU. ask ""when going take seriously? 150,000 dead? 200,000? 300,000 fall?"" go ""maybe million""

im like ""fucking listen yourself......"" felt thing reading yours. mean... make happen want. It'd take concerted SEO campaign pull together...

Also, anyone registered name .com yet? That's classic people going bars partying pandemic like complete idiots. understand need social interaction God sakes please wear mask, outside group people close use mask. windy one direction use advantage can't stand masks. Keep distance, wear masks, wash sanitize often. Honestly dumb average person?  Yeah, agree. I'm ""always plan worst"" kinda guy. see concern trolling, political agenda. I'm ""really angry,"" angry all, never made derogatory claim.

If interested researching matter further, suggest so, I've already given enough go don‚Äôt show contradicts fact, reason, scientific method, veracity. give two examples they‚Äôre alternate interpretations physical evidence.

If know settled science concept binary biological sex humans objective truth held vast majority scientific community, either ignorant science, anti-science. course can't conversation reason impossible conversation ""anti sex"" people, political agenda mind concerned scientific truth, facts, logic, data. wanted present valid argument biological sex *not* objective truth, I'd willing discuss you, course valid argument bullshit, like people I'm pointing out, dancing around claim trying accuse bigoted instead. exactly talking said left anti-science bias, too. Right. there's great percentage positive become symptomatic. Ok makes sense.

I think necessary keep number positive cases posted serves reminder damaging virus is. analysis point view, curious many positive cases would turn symptomatic. specifically said happening DOWNTOWN Atlanta City Atlanta. I‚Äôm exaggerating. easily google proof. calculations showing tipping point? 25%? 50%? virus gets Villages, catastrophe. put reviews. Karen shit. stimulus checks garbage. 

Am gonna complain government giving $1,200 dollars? Hell no...

But reality need help rent, need help bills..this pandemic caused significant fall far behind reduced hours reduced salaries additional $1,200 bandaid much larger issue. Holy shit. Hey bro I‚Äôm gonna argue you, good day. Wear mask mom that??? spent portion life Spain surrounded them, always that.

YAY USA!!


Please send help!!! It‚Äôs going happen. It‚Äôs fairy tale bullshit right now. looked close yet today, expecting least 42k states reported typical numbers last days. crazy. I‚Äôve literally arguments several people who‚Äôve said masks trap virus making breathe it. idiot Dr made statement FB circulated keeps getting shared around. That‚Äôs right idiot DR made video explaining loose immunities quarantining constantly sick go back world. Imagine thinking funny clever real upside point hammer idiots claim quarantine waste time. 

It bought us absolutely invaluable months research study time find treatments work best. Yea, fucked up, still make world difference get hospitalized going forward. Yeah, too. would admit everyone know it? üòÇ waste breath people lacking critical thinking skills. Even Fauci--the god online COVID experts--more less said idiotic.

Honestly, people. Remember two months ago anyone protested lockdown totally gonna spread COVID? somehow thousands times people closer proximity somehow immune wearing masks. *Okay*. making assumption police law connected. heard stops spread /s Another maybe could article.

So, I'm betting it'll tough sell, best, even though desperately needed, like yesterday!   Wait President Trump's voter base relatively older? heard this? Maybe help.

So actually made progress department. That's scary. hospitals? worrying Brazil catching us. way. how!! USA!! USA!! opened soon didn‚Äôt go full lockdown lots places. Also think virus stopped feelings opinions. I‚Äôm wearing masks also masks legally mandatory public place state. work moving company (thank god got hired elsewhere) wear mask basically working day. legit felt like gonna pass one point. mask got super gross, felt like water boarding sweat. I‚Äôll still moving company part time wear mask tomorrow I‚Äôm quitting. need seriously tweak law. beaches! Alabama.

[""The opening bar, recall correctly, around Memorial Day time period. hindsight, should‚Äôve delayed. Especially, knowing rapidly coronavirus could spread bar - Greg Abbott

lol wut? one knew? Literally one doctor scientist met *any idea* possible? Give fucking break. Bruh moment, atm legit don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre trolling not.

You said You‚Äôre simultaneously saying extremely high density areas people safe distance fine, states operate.‚Äù

When said different states different numbers normal states operate differently, know huge amount factors take place result spread virus.

NEVER say high density areas people safe distance fine. fuck strawmans.

And I‚Äôll say again, delusional people actually believe huge amounts people together safe distance won‚Äôt cause virus spread massively. One bright leader said would stop getting new cases stopped testing lol Scary? dunno. mean sure I'm sure scarier before.

The positives reported today result 600,000+ new tests. somewhere around 7.5% positive rate.

Two months ago days 30,000 new positives 175,000 tests consistently hitting 15-20% positive rates.

So sure bad getting worse raw numbers bit misleading. knows many daily positives per day might seen prior months 600k+ daily tests. ""but hvac systems""

/s Shouldn‚Äôt BLM rally toppling confederate statue? It‚Äôs Friday night I‚Äôm sure friends believe Norway national archive order get patent software needs uploaded national archive preservation. they‚Äôve (likely) never been. freedom exposed Covid people decided ‚Äúneeded‚Äù get nails done asthma.

Oh wow thank much continued work quanatiative side this. helpful since tbh although *can* stuff set mind it, like ""but *wanna* eat vegetables mom* haha. great well! talk ""plateau"", knew damned well happening?

Oh know one! he's lying propagandist wants mislead people true intentions are: herd immunity. recent [very powerful editorial critical Swedes authorities need stop lying come clean Swedish great news, wonder much due doctors knowing much treat COVID-19 April...

Considering reduced [likelihood death around 4x new treatments](http://archive.vn/DY9uo), certainly part it. fanatastic news get sick going forward, yet another reason Sweden front loading deaths hope ""get rich quick"" scheme (aka herd immunity April! May! June! end summer!) unethical cruel. can't people. B.C resident here.....less 3,000 cases since thing started. 10 cases recorded yesterday. moved NY three years ago; best decision ever. places US (not even sure though) low covid death rates 5-10 times normal pneumonia flu ascribed deaths months year, impact one area covid percent another Honestly, man tarred feathered. even said TV knew would cause rise cases. care. Ah, amount parties held also mysteriously spiked massively exactly two three weeks ago? Gotcha. Bars closed worries. good. legend Dad? Yes, defending china flu every Patriot could part. easy reelection would saver safe. Well, southern part CA getting hit, lol International news. Healthcare theatre, unless wearing fit tested respirator, safe. Parties, restaurants, bars, casinos, gyms.. pretty easy figure out. Yet governor's gonna still take pointless steps make people think something big. worry, smart posters like /u/udntcwatic say extremely normal part plan Prioritizing making money well players, btw brings money. bleacher report list announced additional 16 players got covid19. find awfully suspicious letting us know is. feeling it, somebody list made public would shutdown league right now. Since still another 2-3 weeks players need report training camp hoping problem goes away then. course opinion matter shows bad gonna get. Trust though, league get shutdown. way they'll able contain virus expect business usual  elderly. staff, too. pretty surprised looking ICU bed numbers. seems Beaumont really city ICU beds. easy people big cities ignore smaller areas. Yeah aggregate number cases look bad resources equally unimpressive. He's right even he's targeted many conspiracy theories since covid-19 yet he's probably done American private citizen combat disease's around world. new research, was¬†published¬†by National Bureau Economic Research, found evidence coronavirus cases jumped 315 cities weeks following first protests.

Now we've established BLM protests correlate COVID spike, protesting against? Pretty sure happen, control virus is. course say flu maybe ignore feel bad people going die due incompetent leaders. nyc lived affected neighborhoods. Saw paramedics taking away dying neighbors stayed home 95% time. hope Cuomo wasn‚Äôt idiot knew doing. Florida dumb ass politicians people refuse wear masks. you‚Äôre Florida wish luck. Corona? right thing would've go stock liquor cabinet, buy playstation watch copious amounts porn good amount society. 

So basically Reddit lifestyle. Ah, perfect r/coronavirus daily meal. Government incompetence Nah, go ahead try it. problem using Imgur otherwise. nothing else works PM them. always check browser history trouble finding them. I'm looking groups I'm seeing single picture crowded beaches. data lie lol. Cmon, you‚Äôre smarter that. forget obligation.....how come general hygiene matter consideration anymore? Well I'm glad criminal justice system, screwed is, nuanced approach moral culpability do.

My dad got DUI 19 laws operated logic would serving life sentence first degree murder. emotionally distancing more. people work? Don‚Äôt forget it‚Äôs sign ‚Äúbravery‚Äù wear mask. People idiots. Thanks heads up! Well wouldn‚Äôt weekly call, would it? We're number one! We're number one!

/s moving goal posts. never saving lives. /S 25 percent world prisoners last time checked, I'd imagine America's ahead counts. situation Houston, many ICU beds available. South Florida hospitals substantiable surge capacity?

Otherwise going get ugly really quickly... Perhaps not. restaurants bars close, Refuse treatment seeks it. waived right aid decided personal crusade mattered lives others. would recommend anyone get it.

Even asymptomatic cases strokes, heart attacks, lung damage. Death always happens end someone's life. Well current rate things couldn‚Äôt afford either .

It doesn‚Äôt help system taxation shambles started yearly deficits trillion dollars . 

As stands looking dramatic rises taxation across economic groups (rich ,middle class,poor, corporations etc ) able keep current levels debt check . Well sane aren‚Äôt .

We probably sit back nothing racking much debt one day everything implodes. almost like leader country is: (fill blank) Highest cholesterol Im totally sure since indian culture really mine ive heard Indians lot respect science. meant back everyone quarenteening. Well defunding police getting back core duties supporting social programs like drug treatment domestic violence mental health called social workers guns. right police enforcing actual laws fair balanced manner, shit-stirring argument really apply. 2019, 113.2 million visitors spent $13.7 billion Wisconsin. data say otherwise. worked great stopping mass shootings. Threatens? Little behind guys..l that's going impossible need get work order survive. They'll exposed frequently sociopathic idiots stay home option.

We're boned reimplement lockdowns everywhere, say we're boned vaccine found. pointing true cause here, economic system (which fuels culture warriors). This. fit agenda. see weeks reiterations ""It's BLM protests"" everybody hellbent even remotely risk called racist.

The whole thing villainized saying anything negative BLM protests beyond point reason, result massive deaths.

But sure, coincidence roughly 2 3 weeks mass-BLM protests gone streets without social distancing USA massive second wave hands.

The overzealous correctness gonna make thing end massive drama US. Thanks. It‚Äôs funny. read minutes ago news. Overall per day? going happen unfortunately reading mad pay much health insurance.  understand waste healthcare system, I'm nurse. also really understand healthcare expensive. also know nurses doctors I've met support number different forms universal healthcare cost-reduction measures, including socialized medicine. like current for-profit healthcare/insurance system, advocate changing it.

None changes fact many hospitals referring non-profits, organizations designed extract profit you, operate provide care research. many employees well-paid mean organizations goal get money. ask thinks so? I‚Äôm pro mask get aren‚Äôt close people you‚Äôre sweating a** top building working lawn, logically shouldn‚Äôt wear mask. hope strike. They've done far much far long far little pay. yeah 'parents' dangerous restaurants  pandemic demonstrates Christianity failed; even enthusiastic followers follow Jesus' teachings. thing masks definitely true own. There's plenty proof, scientific real-life, social distancing + washing hands + awareness get far. Np, almost shut sub down, crisis averted. following hospitals reporting shortage ICU beds:

* Broward Health North
* Broward Health Medical Center
* Holy Cross Hospital
* Westside Regional Hospital
* Florida Medical Center
* Memorial Hospital West
* Plantation General Hospital
* West Kendall Baptist Hospital
* Baptist Hospital Miami
* Jackson Health North
* Homestead Hospital

Health officials concerned residents follow guidelines place, number COVID-19 cases continue rise deaths increase well. liquor sales account 51% revenue close Death rates product circumstance.

If hospital pulmnologists better outcomes don't.

If hospital consistently operating capacity, likely going see high fatality rates everything COVID 19.

Care teams experience better outcomes hospitals care teams train teams also better odds.

My A-Teams say less almost never case medicine. medicine, want continuously tweak improve lab values.

With COVID-19 patients, goal keep alive, accept alarming lab values.

There also meds studies shown help situations CDC providing adequate medicinal therapy data hospitals largely terms governing guidance.

So access medicines varied. calls judge?!? I‚Äôm assuming high school. Keep working analysis. 1960 so.  sell data lives? next step I‚Äôm starting think American‚Äôs want people die, judging overwhelming amount evidence supports wearing masks &amp; socially distancing protective measures ignored people think ‚Äúthis COVID thing blown way proportion‚Äù parents fmily members already here.  nice beaches well. Mountains too.
We'll survive. Sticking head sand usually works well though  legit way prevent unwanted pregnancies according US A. Thoughts prayers thing offer now. course sports money - wasn‚Äôt disputing that. like likely going forever?

I'm qualified answer question, think either. intolerable barbecues one summer?

Because there's guarantee ""one summer"". There's guarantee lockdowns get stricter. next year looks like forever, then... barbecues again? Creative problem solving, really hard.

That assumes lockdowns get stricter next year. 

Look, scary times, no, fearmongering. scary times uncertainty. I'm condoning behavior: agree people properly social distancing. I'm telling that, based words, seem understand people it. 

There's difference understanding, condoning. speak us. point I'd crawl naked broken glass rubbing alcohol get shot vaccine put nightmare behind me. show work Yes, 160 cases last report 33492 tests. thats around 0.5% positive rate, seems pretty good. Thats assuming means many people tested, could one sample per person sometimes. Either way though lot tests much fewer cases. huge lesson everyone, stop cutting everything bone become resilient. Yes cost money, pay taxes for. beaches much parties... single case shut school down. likely.

Just going digital would lot less disruptive go school one day, gets shut couple days next, go back, shut next week, repeating entire year. I‚Äôm trying express isn‚Äôt working, that‚Äôs it. need consistent messaging financial support make extended lockdowns work. Without even waste breathe? You‚Äôre right. Death rate also lagging indicator, people take long 8 weeks die this. Rural USA graduate high school declare smarter people formal medical degrees. Land free home idiots Americans scared what? understand. people either balls brain rock. Lol no. I‚Äôm saying 27 people age 45 underlying conditions died COVID NYC. That‚Äôs 0.17% NYC COVID deaths. 15,500 COVID deaths occurred represent 1.4% mortality rate among cases. 

So basically you‚Äôre taking 1.4% mortality rate overall, saying within that, 0.17% 1.4% people 45 underlying conditions.

And comes 1/50,000 chance death, according calculations, get Covid fall demographic. gaslighting ineffective, kid. Nope. Everyone saying governor probably push Disney opening next week numbers double. guy honestly still hoping virus start burning out? Ot waiting numbers get high enough won‚Äôt look like bad guy shutting Disney? then? Woah, slow down. Masks later. asked September 2020 would differently, retort, ‚ÄúWish made em wear masks.‚Äù meant breaking wave, smartass SoCal okay. ppl opting masks majority still wear especially indoors. Wow, really greased slippery slope. really, deaths dropped dramatically.

A big part people getting sick mostly people age 65 cases absolutely skyrocketed, deaths low NEJM, Lancet, etc. Wrong. conspiracy nuts safe hold hand start signature, non-fact intros:

""What if...""

""I think maybe what's really going on...""

""What they're really trying do...""

""Don't find funny that...""

**I'm gonna stop right there!**

I want belittle people, want ever begin discussion nonsense terms. also mistakenly directing valuable attention away corruption white-collar crime.

So yes, course world groups coordinated political ends criminal intention. need rationally addressed. Sometimes even lowercase c conspiracy. 

But rarely, ever, X-Files conspiracy. 

But, small groups criminals orders magnitude serious (and likely real) tough beat imaginary groups people/forces supposedly conspiring perfect lockstep. 

Everyone sort power often fierce competition global players. rarely friends. trouble even temporary political allies. Went walmart today half employees masks even cover upperlips nose...

This minnesota mind you. Ball life. Coming country even vaster majority people fine, think guys could better. I‚Äôve saying long time. proper quarantine month two. suck deal it. this, continue economy fairly well. won‚Äôt pretty it‚Äôs million times better letting virus freely roam forcibly taking economy. Yeah first develop cases exposed last days lockup. takes 10-14 days + variable testing lag time. get cases people infected, takes another 5-7 days. testing backlog days (as likely peak surge), looking 30 days easily. issue minimum wage, people can't get emergency benefit quit, many grocery stores recently stopped extra pay. CEOs ""summoned"" appear government explain though, I'm hoping plan fix this. least live people seem taking seriously store, worry healthcare thing. really hope get better system America. honestly understand anyone view privatized health care better. Pray USA agree man, can't wait sports come back. paperwork. we're actually essential want business CA need go us. plus businesses need apply stimulus relief also need paperwork us. successfully working home every day, higher-ups decided last week. word going back wfh sometime next week. Covid clinic San Diego 20 minute turnaround test appointment necessary Data says otherwise. Doesn‚Äôt affect freedom say things. Well wait fairly young people give older family member please send nukes. They're preferable figure headline reported. think point trying make (and making poorly, mind you) 41,407 ***reported cases*** day suggests (given prior data) ~2k deaths. course, far mortality rate COVID-19, much lower ratio reported cases deaths. sorry, sacrifice tears sake laughter Well, fair lemmings, really throw cliffs, Disney faked fit preconceived belief wait, maybe that's still like lemmings people think. Sure, think stupid talk terms death rate, 5% cases reported resulting deaths expect continue less.

Yet deaths keep falling it‚Äôs younger people getting tested positive. cases here, spiking Victoria (Northern Melbourne specifically). 'Australia' fear exaggeration.

Same schoolchildren. One week online learning, one week school, social distancing measures. Singapore also 0.01% size United States, apt comparison. Also, according United States 7,713 cases per million Singapore 7,343 cases per million. literally right us.

Granted, still think US handling terribly. also think gets lot complicated talking huge nation states right's govern taken pretty seriously. federal mandate every state quarantine would likely go well. whoa chill science words buddy care politics America

I booked trip Europe two weeks paid hotels flights already around late January (as graduation trip). moment things started going really south China, bit bullet cancelled it. 

You know why? worth potentially carrying Covid killing fellow Americans kids, parents, loved ones.

Apparently, thinking ""my family fine ... we'll careful"". hell everyone else huh? everyone masked whole flight?

I'd agree ""the best hope for"" _must_ fly. actually somehow noticed today looking state MO dashboard, noticed insanely disproportionate death rates Kansas City St. Louis? KC 30 something Covid deaths St Louis 600+. deal that? means 75% MO's Covid deaths St. Louis. There's many people wearing masks police enforcing that. People get belligerent too‚Äîthey're already entitled pissy mood pandemic they're choosing wear mask. Even cops arrested people stuck jail cell together, point they'd indoors tight space wearing mask, would exarcerbate spread virus, put police risk. 

People en masse compliant. say, ""Don't drugs,"" that's enough stop people. need cut source drugs happen. case, makes sense shut businesses people less reason go outside. 

My local Costco mandates masks enter, people go inside, pull mask past nose, chin, defeats purpose. Young children (the ultimate germ factories) masks all. impossible keep eye everyone every second. Everyone keeps leaving California yet come near plateau since started largest population biggest economy. exponential growth yet, starts going long till levels back out. WE'RE #1

w/lyrics - www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RQI7-nIbSI u think Cali trajectory Texas &amp; Arizona ICU capacity?? Thanks details I'm Italy try explain you. European countries thinking reopening 'cause virus ""under control"". (You say gone vaccine)
That means sick monitored, traced isolated, spread virus least number people, maintaining ""contagious factor"" &lt;1. 
That means sick people spread virus another 1 person. 
When control Italy ""contagious factor"" 3. every sick person next days would another 3 people Covid.
0 infection mean tracing, monitoring isolation done perfectly (it's almost impossible big country).
Place reopening, returning normal. new laws protect people near us must respect. even happens sick person can't get Covid
Hope useful you. questions, ask.

Edit: sorry lame comment, upvote didn‚Äôt seem like enough(: big issue people really grasped effect COVID unchecked. people really understand percent population dying really looks like. easy make proclamations worst case scenario looks like 'another flu'. There's Mythbusters episode watch contact one person exposed agree stay home cousin deliver groceries two weeks whatever, helped stymy whole new branch cases. second best user name I‚Äôve ever seen reddit seriously, might crazy uneducated delusional they're showing community meetings talking directly people local government issues matter them. us complete nutters can't same, surprised voices heard views represented. totally right incubation period. 

But say 5-7 mean, means 1/2 bit more, 1/2 bit less. 

I think factor possibility false negatives, % cases incubation longer side (thus may infected show test), % large definitively say one infected within 2 weeks. 

It's possible one infected, there's also sizeable % chance someone infected got false negative virus still incubating. small sample size short period meaningful takeaway IMO. Yep time everybody already year's supply TP it'll something else impossible find. guy idiot.. irony... stayed made masks that

* material lab tested almost N95
* design lab tested pass respirator fit test

Then decided make super-masks probably N99.

(So go kitchen, make sure come kitchen, ideally even within hour leave it). avoiding close direct contact (or breathe air breathe) drastically reduce risk contagion. rest (sanitizing, wearing mask, etc.) help, less important that. somewhat until....2025??!?!!?!?! mom dropped university, extremely well read, yet believes conspiracies running amok world feels world miserable place coping mechanism.

I would recommend keeping interactions parents outdoors much possible first two weeks, Japanese study reported infections 19 times likely indoors outdoors - hang them, stay outdoors keep distance, possibly wear mask well. need indoors together room, keep brief possible, keep windows open possible, try keep maximal distance you. must conversation indoors, absolutely wear mask, indoors high risk speaking produce almost much droplets coughing according studies.

600 expect downward trend. said deaths lag positive tests hospitalizations. expect death toll start really climbing around mid July. gonna lot worse. C'mon, USA; let brazillians take #1 spot! /s Oof. Blew outta water ago. Fuck Yeah dates wrong. Spanish FLU? 1918. election year. SARS? 2003. election year. H1n1? 2009, also election year. I've seen meme years changed line US election cycle.

It's stupid frustrating people think US country world matters rest world tries fuck us lie deadly illness. fucking dumb. Remindme! 2 weeks Good job Alaska! increasing flood still helping spread lies hate.

just like before. Incivility ok always been. deadly choking African dust storm! CDC didn‚Äôt warn us Saharan death dust! MAGA fund pretty much disinformation campaign divides Americans. easy honestly. He's pure evil hard respect well Putin played game thus far. Various EU countries reopened schools without seeing spikes. 

The netherlands completely opening high schools fall North Carolina?

This sheriff look heart ask, ""What would Sheriff Andy Taylor Mayberry County?""

""Well, shucks, know virus business, know smartest men women know what's right democratically elected officials made law oughtta protect community. I'd hate Aunt Bee got sick left Opie without motherly figure household. Mr. Bass, I'm going give citation. Think little good day."" Literally take money going Wall Street give people. Every dollar give working people dollar goes back economy 80 cents every dollar give corporations goes stock buy backs, executive bonuses, shore accounts. people say Chinese brain washed. embarrassing stupid people country are. Wear f$&amp;$ mask. leadership failing us. support wearing mask help country. 

People thinking mask wearing political needs critical thinking skills. turn tv see countries wearing masks testing much better us. 

At point become criminal? ‚ÄúThe tests came back positive gene called RdRp. One tests, gene called N, known sensitive.‚Äù understand support keep businesses open downtime quite there, get mean getting back work. sticker Ralph saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm essential‚Äù Jeep. Look. fan. Lol traitor burner account? think made mistake one sportsballgame. That's actually true though. Testing increased 4x since late March/April. reason looks like less people dying it, majority infections March/April testing less, virus raging tri-state area. infection rate decreased (even testing goes up), deaths come down.

Now, cases going back up, deaths surely follow. reason people think less less people die ratio cases deaths increased. reason ratio increased testing increased large number. Yep, $1200. add $600 per week unemployment. ending soon too. 

America dump July everyone‚Äôs rent due, taxes, unemployment benefits end. Brace Canada. point might well live gun die gun  said last time.... Plenty people still problems getting tested. Based graph aggregate confirmed count doubled month.

With six months left year, let's assume aggregate confirmed count doubles five times. 

Right now, count around ten million ‚Äî 10,000,000

After five doublings, count three hundred twenty million ‚Äî 320,000,000 posting multiple times within minute, often times using exact text used previous posts. Taking again, since mods removed it. actively helping spread misinformation hate Compared Sweden press ask officials softball questions actually became minor scandal ""crazy German"" was, GASP, asking questions aggressive manner since Done. 

Your tin foil dumb always. 

The German asked questions Swedish media simply true Swedes conformist lot.

This makes sense ever, anti-swedish feelings taking over. extreme conformity really evident media, esp. one compares Danish press conferences Swedish press conferences. Q&amp;A Danish pressers often downright uncomfortable sometimes since press hammers officials hardball questions. 

Again, clearly never watched swedish press conference, maybe even danish one. pure fantasy time start crack, party leader debate COVID June 7th 2/3 Nordics already opposition parties successfully get investigations launched ruling government. 

Utter lie. swedish opposition going course person research, actively encourage everyone read sides topic new them. I've provided start

Every time see comment, false information. Something made up, link something unrelated put spin on. Tuesday? Imagine stupid blame huge spike cases Southern states (who reopened early restrictions) BLM protests üòÇ act eating restaurant one human human experiences.

Are fucking kidding dude, restaurants around last 300 years literally core Christianity. 12 people sitting breaking bread. Sharing food other.

Jesus wept applebee's closed due immunity best guess pursue reasonable manner would costs 400k lives total. 

For smart finance man bad math, 0.5% IFR plus 70% population infected gives 1.1 million deaths. since 1 20 cases needs hospital care, looking 11.55 million hospitalizations. Close 500000 deaths far (globally) spread seems accelerating. Yes, always exceptions, like dual citizenship economic essentials. Also Americans travel say going Alaska. Lol country fucking dogshit Oh no.. I'm bar right realize actual situation in. Americans irritatingly moronic? downvote you. Dude asking question. It‚Äôs ok ask question. info whether he‚Äôs fucking everything up. You‚Äôre making ANGRY, Phil! Ohio. Warren Ohio 15 miles Pennsylvania, Warren County clear across state south west. get Missouri St. Louis city St. Louis county suburbs St. Louis county, surrounds include St. Louis. Fella got paid 43k job, nice. 

The average number deaths second week April appx 55000, year appx 77,000 40% first 8 weeks CDC chart show expected deaths average. CDC also period incomplete lag time death occurred death certificate completed, submitted NCHS processed reporting purposes. delay range 1 week 8 weeks more, depending jurisdiction cause death.


So pretty clear started number deaths U.S. spiked 10-40% week.


Even labeled every single death Covid19, dosent explain 10-40% deaths every week. People lived heart disease, cancer, lung problems, years before. Imagine stupid blame huge spike cases Southern states (who reopened early restrictions) BLM protests üòÇ  Whose business sacrifice? choose?

To point though, health people economy. Sick dead people don‚Äôt produce. Imagine stupid blame huge spike cases Southern states (who reopened early restrictions) BLM protests üòÇ dumb survive forgot pizzagate lol likely community actions taken transmission rate (R0) fall time, continue double unabated.

People dumb, we've seen even governments say anything, people take upon plant asses move feel safe.

And point rate slow community immunity effects. Reason number one million one I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm American. Free shots free insurance. anyone remember Feb March forecasted would 500 million cases worldwide April 21, 2020?

March 31 top government scientists battling coronavirus estimated Tuesday deadly pathogen could kill 100,000 240,000 Americans, spite social distancing measures closed schools, banned large gatherings, limited travel forced people stay homes.

Note current death toll within range, we're even summer, yet. 20% NYC found antibodies. read worked backwards NYC maybe 700,000 cases end march, way tested. im sorry know read that. problem US. People conflating artificially inflated treatment costs money makes much sense thinking people US pay $500K copy video game Two Point Hospital Steam because... ""hospital"" ""money"". anything works.  true. test anyone, zero death certificates covid19 it.

There weird number pneumonia deaths, probably fluke something. see now.  Red mask ""MAGA"" silk-screened outside. printed label says blocks Bill Gates 5G Mind Control Nano Technology.  (There might little bit copper red dye, somewhere.)  (Made China, town named Usa.)

Beautiful Masks. Perfect Masks. beautiful TV special offer, 30-minute format sales show. Hurry buy run out.  $19.95 each, 2 $34.95, plus $5 shipping. portion profits go (some fake charity ""police"" name). 

You watch -- someone that. full numbers, much even plateau. Ny plateau literally paralyzed. Everything closed, everyone boarded quarantining people live even. 

These new states aren‚Äôt that. open.

By time nyc hospitals started get stressed already closed month more. Houston hand 4 months prepare, system stressed shut bars now. haven‚Äôt seen anything like we‚Äôre see New York‚Äôs numbers trends indicative southern states poor handling politicization virus. different population densities public transport systems too. may time react, may spread bad quick. cant possibly know play yet. guess don‚Äôt act swift much worse scenario NY did. Florida may quite wild ride too. Correct, time country needs united agree everyone needs done. NZ Aus well there‚Äôs really sense unity times. US blaming individual states, blaming politicians etc, far united get despite name Well, fair, large percentage people either NY PA. feels couple weeks ago. last January. Nothing penetrates guys. get that, want issue.. yeah... working bar thats notoriously packed taking zero precautions.. around here. Makes sad. No, no. guys totally misunderstanding. 

The sex traffickers pedophiles anti-maskers. care people. would easy tell cares others enough wear mask, sex abuser. 

/s North Dakota like 50 people living there. USA! USA! Oh wait... beliefs based emotions psychology, intellect much government lead way (or not), public response biggest factor. enough cops force everyone wear mask stay home. high compliance, gets easier cite punish bad actors. 

Many Southern Cal wanted hit beach restaurants. inland wanted pretend COVID-19 city-folk problem. go well.    Let‚Äôs admit it, fucking stupid.
Those care continue wear masks social distances. Protect ya neck since nobody else will. could possibly seen coming? still debated? Brilliant took New York City nearly month hard lockdown cases/hospitalizations/deaths started going peaking need shut down. entire month. Truly shut DOWN. Businesses area shut doors temporarily infections. voluntary, right thing. happening anyway, needed stop every opportunity exposure. understand big deal people, end life people. need step agree one needs die. People telling picked bad source. keep reposting response, done find better source, delete post, post one instead. 

So, predictably, post removed. could listened advice everyone comments gave you, instead stubbornly kept pasting thing over. world almost reported 200K first time. missed it. Still record. India Russia Brazil USA turmoil, Iran reporting second wave. Africa ‚Äúdecent‚Äù amount testing. god knows many people infected continent. 

South America finally good testing it‚Äôs becoming clear new epicentre virus earth. 

Middle East finally decent testing it‚Äôs showing also crisis. Someone tell competition went hiking last weekend kept mask chin time pulled coming close/passing people. Keeps ""normalcy"" wearing mask around others without much hassle. second one perhaps moment time didn‚Äôt? can‚Äôt remember bad China sowed SARS MERS bad variants flu blown over. Perhaps meant don‚Äôt worry yet? neighbor came suspect covid. fight test CVS told today results could take 3 weeks more.. cost son $2300 becuase Medicare would pay They‚Äôll protected herd immunity. would at...90 percent? click links article. B, followed A. Proven. course think protest hugging covid19 patients Bruh moment, 
 
I mean, guess to...
 atm legit don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre trolling not.
 said You‚Äôre simultaneously saying extremely high density areas people safe distance fine, states operate.‚Äù
  said different states different numbers normal states operate differently
 
No no. That‚Äôs said. provided exact quote said. said operate differently, didn‚Äôt matter.
 NEVER say high density areas people safe distance fine. fuck strawmans.
 
Such potty mouth.
 
I guess nitpick, you‚Äôre right. never said fine. said didn‚Äôt matter.
 
Mea culpa.
 I‚Äôll say again, delusional people actually believe huge amounts people together safe distance won‚Äôt cause virus spread massively. average /r/politics user believe non sense
 
I guess try ignore questions asked previous comments conveniently bypassed...
 
If protests - AKA ‚Äúhuge amounts people together safe distance‚Äù - cause virus spread massively - aren‚Äôt states protests spiking? 
 
And you‚Äôre going say it‚Äôs different states operate, doesn‚Äôt matter - would mind going little detail that? You‚Äôre free go get COVID. understand logic; governor's think gaslight manipulate pandemic away? Lol states reopen first  need talk this, welcome message me. I've dealt understand, there's need destroy health. Funny don‚Äôt care anymore, even though it‚Äôs worse ever, either boredom shit going both. funny mean makes wanna blow brains Nope, far away. Well... actually want issued fines caring society. admittedly I'm bit extremist comes \#WearAFuckingMask. shit getting borderline Orwellian. shit (selfishness, greed, insular mentality, tribalism) society breaks down.

Libertarianism symptom this.

People understand society is. responsibilities rights. God save India haven‚Äôt watching news lately well it‚Äôs terrible. everyday hear USA another record day, daily thing? Like day beats last, getting old news? ‚ÄòGone‚Äô? Maybe 4 years ago Trump elected? Mississippi much much much lower population spiked 1,000 new cases yesterday. really needed lot words explain away double standard, huh? testing? leaned January trying convince family impending pandemic. good feeling. Peace love. effort must taken type left hand heavy breathing.  surely is. It‚Äôs proven spread via AC. Quick google search pull lot research/studies, including new one week.

Concern #762 winter everyone using heat staying indoors, especially cold climates. Hopefully handle then, everyone wearing masks, testing like never before, proper contact tracing teams place. Ummm. Yeah. Wishful thinking US especially elections? Probably. :^/ Yawn That's think backpedal shutdown statement. He's gonna get cornered wall option.  Anyone surprised? No? obvious we‚Äôre dumbfounded nobody anything? happens 30 million aren‚Äôt part 300 million? Unless 10% people wearing masks live within 5 miles me, lie. never asserted anyone media. seems pointless without single set nationwide rules wait pray Covid 19 spread India I'm tired frustrated South taking seriously good chunk Southern population risk. Obesity, elderly, chronic illness make covid worse, seems like people fighting hardest wear masks. 

I'm disappointed America whole, South always wanted prove better North, yet again, fail right thing make look stupid. Sigh. don‚Äôt trust numbers. Yeah bit higher usual yesterday, Tuesday usually highest day. Ontario lowest number today since March though. can't tell numbers today Canada Quebec report used yesterdays numbers. I‚Äôm sorry, sounds like really rough situation, travel home, quarantine get there? way, virus. ‚Ä¶ looks like April, know theory, gets little warmer, miraculously goes away ‚Äî hope that‚Äôs true. we‚Äôre great country. China, spoke President Xi, they‚Äôre working very, hard. think it‚Äôs going work fine. Rough stuff, tell you, rough, rough stuff. think it‚Äôs going work good. 11 cases, they‚Äôre getting better.

- Impeached Fucking Moron Donald J. Trump, Feb 10 2020 IF. Immunity isn‚Äôt known yet. Goddammit That's necessarily true mild infection asymptomatic. Though severe infection definitely going long term ramifications even survive initial infection. 80k cases per day soon Today? It‚Äôs American governments job protect individually. It‚Äôs theirs. goal wasn‚Äôt stop - slow it. laboratory confirmed hospitalizations reported CDC.

That match known-data, bar graph associated with. hard decode, little know heck lot do, kid. gets boring educating people like you.

You're proving false every post, please, keep going. Case yeah. real life example unfolding everybody's eyes happens versus speculation driven by...what? gut feeling? biases?

You even understand simple statistics work. Again, want make claim 'great portion' young people end hospitalized, throw bs numbers, bs numbers need context total infections. Otherwise, mean absolutely nothing. 

I idea going regarding gut feelings 'real life examples'. We're talking data, kid, something better learning instead quoting. Source? remembered someone posting ""see title tomorrow"" yesterday said yesterday highest total. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday... already tripped plug. RemindME! 1 week What's going happen Texas coming weeks? mask mandate? Another lockdown? Simply shutting businesses limiting number people gather? every right wear mask. Feel free wear mask want home, woods, alone. second enter public space, agreeing social contract, longer right wear mask. 

It's baffling people understand important piece information. Seems problematic country built 1% country mind. country built, design, keep majority ignorant, stupid, complacent.

Ripe destruction/implosion. school opening late July?O.o.  
  
Universities/colleges/CCs summer classes online US, no? feel like we've really ramped testing. 
Damn I've covid parties air bnb across street since Febuary. insane.
During AZ shutdown least 30 staying place. Pool parites corona beer covid FTW No, won't.

If realize now, stupid walk earth. whole point science doubting idea much want come back 4 months say ""I told so!"" Roughly 15% get hospitalized 2-5% die. citizen cross border long isolate. place stay might actually worth it. People generally seem careful re-opening guidelines businesses strict good. issue national strategy, Testing 20 million mean jack shit testing strategically, targeted, aggregate data importantly act quickly positive tests. pos, test absolute useless get tested get results back 4 days later. already spread least 1 person means RT = 1. Hey patrick I? lets wait actually happen. talking today's numbers. projection speculative. lots variables (age, better treatment, mutated version virus, severity).

When NYC/NJ testing, testing sickest [‚ÄúNo person asked proactively attended protest,‚Äù Avery Cohen, spokesperson de Blasio, wrote emailed response questions always plays multiple angles topic. way he‚Äôs always right Fox, Sinclair etc pick narrative makes look good appears paraphrasing Yeats line.

The Second Coming 
BY WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS

Turning turning widening gyre  
The falcon cannot hear falconer;
Things fall apart; centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy loosed upon world,
The blood-dimmed tide loosed, everywhere  
The ceremony innocence drowned;
The best lack conviction, worst  
Are full passionate intensity.

Surely revelation hand;
Surely Second Coming hand.  
The Second Coming! Hardly words  
When vast image Spiritus Mundi
Troubles sight: somewhere sands desert  
A shape lion body head man,  
A gaze blank pitiless sun,  
Is moving slow thighs,  
Reel shadows indignant desert birds.  
The darkness drops again; know  
That twenty centuries stony sleep
Were vexed nightmare rocking cradle,  
And rough beast, hour come round last,  
Slouches towards Bethlehem born? Lol spoken like child

They may want be, us privacy laws place stronger think are. It‚Äôs blatantly clear zero exposure subject absolutely clue you‚Äôre talking about. 

They‚Äôre easily googleable, something you‚Äôve decided whatever dumb reason. Regardless erroneously think, hinder full contact tracing. fact, interest discussing opinions. I‚Äôve yet try drawing whiteboard something, illustrate overwhelming evidence once.

[like deaths follow spikes, concurrent. insinuating USA worst response overall virus, thus far? Surely that's *all* would do, sir? Right ? getting clear get admitted hospital maybe ICU, effects often severe. thing wrecks peoples health long term. false Christians work. mindset present many aspects life. Like make minor mistake forget something work day always ""Look made do""

And ever try show proof anything like say, refuse hear ""I time listen you. Get past it!"" right they've accused something show proof it.

I truly believe mental condition simply unable take responsibility actions. Except time, reality, one two boats slapping big red button repeatedly like angry chimpanzee blowing fuck boat everyone else.

Lol picture Joker beginning explain situation, even get one boat starts jamming button like bunch fucking morons. Texas won‚Äôt completely shut down. absolutely right call. lot misrepresentation data that‚Äôs put mainstream media inciting fear compliance. Yes part prevent spread misleading public isn‚Äôt way get people pull weight. think massively overestimate number Americans afford stay home kids indefinitely. hmm idk imagine trump made decisions without checks balances yes MR. WTF guess. must big smart business owner amazing life. lmao nah bro it‚Äôs username. don‚Äôt smoke. i‚Äôm working full time put school. don‚Äôt ask shit government like pathetic ass want get Mr. Bone's wild ride. Even assume R &lt; 1 we'll eventually reach containment, decrease R means containment comes sooner fewer total people get sick. (Also: less time people get bored masks bring R back 2, 4, more...)

It's realistic test everyone every day everywhere, pooled testing (discussed article) weekly basis focused areas worst outbreaks would feasible useful. mean protests led huge upticks NY areas. They've following it. lot people protests NY handing masks, antibacterial gel recommending maintaining distance. videos saw friends protests vast majority masks people kept space themselves. plus outside gonna decrease lot potential spread. believe nyc already 1% positive tests. world leaders politics make VR sandbox obliterate, refuse accept able hang gf person least next months simply there's people stupid high power... yeah right SOURCE handy contagious virus actually spread protests   10 million likely unbelievable underestimate well. Consider USA likely closer 25~ million cases (CDC estimates), testing far, far better than, say, Nigeria India Indonesia. well hundreds millions guess. 

The big problem third world, counting cases deaths becomes folly. slum could lose thousands people would barely register data reports. already mostly impossibly hard first world. NYC highest testing rates world still missed 20 cases per 1 'confirmed case' antibody results came back. Houston here...our largest hospitals full cops city well. sent alert via text today saying virus spreading alarming rates stay home Bc it‚Äôs control right now. Many people spoke quick reopening warned would outcome. played EXACTLY like told would scientific community. still hear people today saying real..it‚Äôs political. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Good point Wild Kratts mostly agree this. 


I think initially would like everyone else believed virus overblown, doubt would quickly listen scientists public health advisors implement **federal** mandates models predicted worst. 


Right now, would saying, ""Man, really need shut COVID thing?""

How wish could naive. corona *and* sun? kind place. ü§£ Remindme! 12 days feel like ""Trump Lung"" better ring it. Definitely sounds like something want avoid getting. thread US cases... stop testing yet? thought would go away know many infected. provided people stay home unless needed, practice good hygiene Keeping distance.

All things Southern states diligent at, I'm sure üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Can provide data shows significant spikes cities largest protests prove theory true?

If not, fuck off. data Oxford's monkey trial. monkeys test trial vaccinated PUMPED full Corona virus, literally eyes, throat , lungs. contracted COVID (aka tested positive) however none contracted pneumonia. That's huge (and great!) thing.

Also:

""Six animals received investigational vaccine 28 days infected SARS-CoV-2 compared three control animals receive vaccine. vaccinated animals showed signs virus replication lungs, significantly lower levels respiratory disease lung damage compared control animals.""

All monkeys vaccinated received ridiculous levels COVID exposure fine.

There's reason many world governments invested hundreds millions Oxford's vaccine seeing data. Yes, able go take care say goodbye. Especially dad whose alone now. keep telling him, take chance he's diligent I'm risking come take care him. get video shared today cousin Uncle, one wearing masks.

The stuff deal sucks would wait. sibling step up. Lol read articles fully? say may big spike expected people protesting tended stay indoors away protestors. also mention since many protestors young, may show symptoms least enough warrant testing hospitalization there's way know true extent spread COVID protests. 

You can't gather hundreds cases thousands people together close quarters expect people wore face masks outdoors COVID spread. people denouncing lockdown protests saying dangerous people's behavior was. large gatherings bad spread disease. Got anything leer reviewed? that's pretty ridiculous claim. uncle got degree vocational college, yet somehow claims know Dr. Fauci  Sir, hospital.  Crazy think we're living worst country world. America, 2020, read us ways handle pandemic hundred years now. think SARS SARS-CoV-2 stands for? Fuck Costco gas at. r/Masks4All 3 months old now, since created it, people told silly. pretty damn unanimous point help. shut chances high another stimulus check? Take seat naughty step. Pence office time vaccine approved. Cool. That's still argument. Lol yeah right people also blame. Even protests going incredibly reckless going monumentally devastating consequences. Guys slow testing. numbers high. America release excess deaths figures? Obviously reasons. UK 20% higher what's reported. UK fairly honest too. Yep Trump responsible countries now. Hey wolves intelligent caring animals modified non replicating chimpanzee virus, asbestos injection. worst, give fever day two. Well need less tests there's less positives right? :S Paywaaaaaalll say cool story, bro, without sarcastic? Um...Well done. image responsibility US world long gone. really ongoing episode Idiocracy now. Let guess Mr 420. currently unemployed depending state federal assistance. Since smoke unable find decent job pays well blame society failures endured. Ya outbreak quite large March actually figured out, probably 3 months would brought levels see countries. Unfortunately states, even president, got super anxious couple weeks. know would happened leaders open upfront said ""buckle 3 months everyone""...instead 14 days slow spread. Yeah carry pocket spray bottle alcohol whenever I'm house. Fuck I'm gonna trust people clean. Wtf? type reasoning left faith humanity shattered. bet would change even 1 1.6 million someone loved. Southwest Ohio - lots people still thinking somehow plot make Trump look bad election year. plot, he's making look bad election year.  Americuhh FUCK YEAH literally talking covid19 existed üíØ

To specific, nation state. You‚Äôre presenting false equivalency here; opening state doesn‚Äôt cause COVID-19 provided people stay home unless needed, practice good hygiene Keeping distance.

IE everything protest isn‚Äôt. reporters also suggest maybe thousands people protest around world might good idea? healthcare professionals said worth risk protest social justice? Everyone‚Äôs fucking hypocrite deserve this. side thinks masks hard wear, morons think isn‚Äôt real, plain dumb idiots decided protest multiple days assholes rioting/looting, health care ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù didn‚Äôt immediately condemn protests massive fucking risk finally leadership haven‚Äôt able lead entire country right path (even entire media frothing mount contradict everything says). entire situation total goat fuck country deserves failures everyone blame besides people stayed fuck home. Aren‚Äôt diverting Riverside San Bernardino counties? San Diego county reason permitted propaganda (including acceptance anti-science narrative) go unopposed unpunished. 

The next question spurred encouraged narrative?

The answer would people interested destabilizing democratically enabled west. likley (IMHO) collaboration between:

1) ""Americans"" interested destroying liberal democracy replacing kleptocracy. (Yes religious nutters too, organize box, money gray matter coming smart people, stupid.)

2) Countries happy historical American/Western dominance. IE (the usual actors Russia, China, etc) know president could encouraged people wear masks day one...

I wonder part mask backlash content discussion ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù back April, frankly got little ridiculous. idea would longer hugs, everyone lives six feet apart, dines little bubbles. wonder anti-maskers masks got mixed nonsense.

If leaders clear goals: wear masks virus gets certain level certain amount time, done, anti-mask thing wouldn‚Äôt gotten inflamed.

But it‚Äôs late now. proof? 600,000 day. 94,726 per 1/m. I'm took immunology college they're really saying said said they're fucking idiots. need MD taken immunology college. word random MD knowing slightest. went school lot stupid kids certain ways. doctors. wear shirt shoes goes businesses want wear mask for? Imagine tiny appendage keep copying pasting attention People losing minds masks ‚Äúlimit freedoms‚Äù keep electing leaders literally monitor whole lives insane privacy violations He‚Äôs idiot. Lt Gov would think would given point. every store every state nowadays selling form mask near tills? feels like live. Online one buy packages surgical masks pretty cheaply, too.

They entirely wrong. fact basically one wearing mask knows use without contaminating anyway defeats purpose. Unless disposing mask every time remove gloves chances contaminated yourself. id also like add eye protection worn conjunction masks defeats point easily catch viruses like mouth nose frequently touched. best possible solution keep distance really wanted stop test everyone similar Wuhan identifies sick quarantine that's effective way ""end"" this. point masks useless majority better solutions bring end. Yeah it‚Äôs dropping good neww economy LOL still think god? Join r/Masks4All ! guarantee vaccine, Pence exact thing PPE. Distribution handled least capable people, given friends, wealthy donors, etc. us regular citizens see real trickle looks like. Really? Plenty TP Western Australia. yes sentient African toilet bowls part plan world domination. we're lucky astromind like expose evils world.

inb4 welcomed point significant spikes cities largest protests prove theory true? time home mostly meant give us time catch beds PPE. Trump fed crap. 

If encouraged people wear masks stressed important were, 35% would gladly it. Take penny double weekly.      
By week 26 know fucked are.   
We soon enter week 26 2020. ""Damn, tested otherwise gotten sick"" - Trump RIP 33,000. LOL September 29 December 28, 2019, influenza B viruses accounted 59.2% influenza-positive results reported nationwide

Tip o' cap. wife recently lost parents ... Facebook Faux News. taken dad decade brainwashing, mother-in-law succumbed much quicker conspiracies absolute batshittery. previously intelligent decent people hear racist bullshit coming mouths horrifies us. point significant spikes cities largest protests prove theory true?

No. base beliefs facts. course *want* to. really mean shit right now. continues get worse, season aint happening. sucks, I'd eat left shoe NBA season actually started. way case rate. dont care bubble, happening. amount time going take quarantine clear every infected person alone delay start. CPR study found formal qualifications predictor quality, medical knowledge informal providers Tamil Nadu Karnataka higher trained doctors Bihar Uttar Pradesh, study found.

Not exactly confidence inspiring. Yup. Worldometer dropped 1% cases listed serious dropped percent outcome death.

Positive news. Ppl freaking cases rising studies shown us infected thought (Penn State, CDC.) Hopefully numbers mortality updated next couple months. Conspiracies fun! 663 today seven day moving average still going down, good. US average 30,000 cases day wouldn‚Äôt surprise see going again. Sucks Pence hope prayers YOU. Southern states reopening restrictions well protests started.

Those states hardest hit.

One hell coincidence. Let's definitely blame protests, though üôÑ I'm glad took time away racist online reply me! research, led U.K.-based Institute Strategic Dialogue (ISD) think-tank, identified 6,600 online channels ‚Äî pages, accounts groups ‚Äî Canadians involved spreading white supremacist, mysogynistic radical views. Asshat protesters. whole exponential concept hard grasp ‚Äúcurve‚Äù goes vertical. ancestors meant said ""The South Shall Rise!"" Southern states reopening restrictions well protests started.

Those states hardest hit.

One hell coincidence. Let's definitely blame protests, though üôÑ looked Minneapolis data real way planned retirement. I‚Äôm gonna find religion, pray lose everything ... see y‚Äôall Valhalla Right last election: haha Russian collusion leftists stupid 
The Right election: WORLD COLLUDING ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre first, you‚Äôre last!‚Äô -Florida man false Christians like attitude well pass virus someone else suffers dies ""God's will""

If follow logic maybe murderers prosecuted, deed god's will. Matter fact everything happens gods will.

These fucking evangelical FALSE CHRISTIANS. never known one way vindictive fucked up. going pick choose parts scripture use justify selfish needs discard rest. Hypocrites. Low life pieces shit (no offense actual pieces shit) 500k *confirmed* deaths. We'll know next year we've sorted data roughly many *actual* deaths were. Southern states reopening restrictions well protests started.

Those states hardest hit.

One hell coincidence. Let's definitely blame protests, though üôÑ ‚ÄúBlaim?‚Äù Murica!!!!!! Figure skipping lot small children, prior infected people outright refusing get vaccinated. Kids generally asymptomatic. possible spread without symptoms much less likely lot children people tested positive viral load low contagious short duration infection. 10 probably magic number curve gets unlikely transmitted. Southern states reopening restrictions well protests started.

Those states hardest hit.

One hell coincidence. Let's definitely blame protests, though üôÑ takes government competent. one won‚Äôt even pull head sand. 

Because lack testing contact tracing (they 4 months get things going) can‚Äôt feel safe anywhere. everyone could get tested every couple days, could feel safer crowd.

 Now, months wasted. 

We find bad really is. fair, regards New Zealand...they island population Louisiana. big state us.

I'm saying US fucked up, have. cannot compare island small population. sounds like rooting possible cases btw. Meaning want America look bad possible. Which, we‚Äôre probably slipping back N95 suggested wear there‚Äôs enough supply hospitals important areas like Nursing Homes. Actually ending lockdown CDC recommendations met wearing masks Southern states reopening restrictions well protests started.

Those states hardest hit.

One hell coincidence. Let's definitely blame protests, though üôÑ  Right? potentially it, symptoms severe enough feel need go hospital possibly spread it. fever hit higher 103 one point, ended pretty dehydrated. miserable kept thinking people get severely sick was. Imagine cranial genius think stupid protesters didn‚Äôt cause spike Southern states reopening restrictions well protests started.

One thing, it‚Äôs southern states, LA County spiking much southern states. Maybe stop testing everyone mom hell it? death rate dropped halve.

Either doctors better treating this, maybe virus become less lethal? Whatever reason, I'll take it. *its  bad actors you‚Äôre saying protests didn‚Äôt add cases all, right ? Fuck strong enough word.

I said mixed together. Yep - first day required Oregon week went get shoes since toes literally ones have. one obnoxious things needing try on, otherwise I'd buy online. nice seeing store clerk patrons wearing masks. Fucking hell. 2k one time correction. countries including China, France, Belgium, Spain point done thing.

Death number rise next 2 3 weeks. seem lower 3 months ago, probably doctors actually gotten better treating Covid-19.

Still, nobody wants get hospitalized disease. may live, seriously impact health rest life What's about? name makes think doxxing anti-mask people, doxxing Reddit TOS (unless mainstream news first)? people need haircuts don‚Äôt want live fear! Fuck every single one whiny motherfuckers. right thing whole time it‚Äôs nothing fucking assholes decide wearing mask weak say death sentence? said hospital bed. People still filling hospitals. Thankfully, there‚Äôs good chance they‚Äôll make through, treatments could get people worst days sooner started. thing still knock people pretty hard, since they‚Äôre still needing go hospital. 

I keep seeing stories people listed ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù month past recovering, still barely breathing rough battle pneumonia, still looking many months recovery.

I'm trying get place road boyfriend grandfather much safer. hear right two intransigent camps, certain destroying world. trying make everyone focus bars get ignore fact larger risk young people FORCED WORK JOBS

Constantly blaming bars partying makes people look away larger picture reopening put people risk. want blame you, Much like Memorial Day gatherings? Much like continue see people crowded bars/restaurants said hard hit areas? Much like crowded beaches, 0 PPE sight people protests actually high number mask utilization? 

Nah right, let‚Äôs ignore shit pin entirely protests. like righteous cause people wanting party get hair cut end this....whenever may be...i surprised India ends gold medal. Good thing im going back office job 100 percent telecommute friendly threw back 21, minor back pain since. exercise kind stretching miserable. Standing comfortable position. Anybody else feel like we‚Äôre really fucked many levels? forget prayers. going get pretty damn scary. pretty highly centralized before, penetrating diffusing across country seems many red states deny masks.

This like bad version Hunger Games. sacrifice enough already. thought parents learning last months. bit messed up. legal state. State police can't give shit follow state laws. Federal police could still fuck shit though. Important remember government estimates 13 million action users would sufficient good view spread nationwide. 13 mil downloads already, also good usage rate, far goal. need testing everyone gauge full scale epidemic. enough test representative random sample.

Tests also full proof. test negative today, still positive tomorrow. We're pretty much back normal West Australia. We're island within island. lucky Federal Quarantine adminstration since 1908, people already aware importance isolation disease outbreaks. 

We also lucky surrounded oceans. way via ports. neighbours also strict Quarantine regulations.

Yes young people partly blame, young people partying also far right/trump base become anti mask also taught importance breaking bread other. course whole act occurred last supper.

One hell coincidence. Let's definitely blame BLM protests though. He's gonna show face task force meetings soon almost certain. Corona hit news he's ratings. USA! USA! USA! isnt working all.

:( Keep dreaming! 233 cases Massachusetts. governor strict mask policies open anything statistically made sense to. know, things scientists said Wait. US schools open July? Deaths collapsed. People common sense saw coming. I've sounding alarm saying going last atleast year, way back april people thought would month. Look now. shit getting started baby Damn protestors thought learned watching NYC mitigation efforts takes 14-30 days begin bending curve people start changing behaviors significantly. believe next 14 days new cases already infected haven‚Äôt enough symptoms complications cause get tested yet. believe time lag catching virus, showing symptoms (if any), possibly needing treatment ultimately recovering succumbing, much people comprehend unless truly want spend minutes understand potential implications. 
I fear what‚Äôs store us southern US. believe going ugly two weeks. hope I‚Äôm wrong least ultimately causes people and/or leadership look science solutions.

Why gaslighting everyone? bring alcohol spray bottle need go out. Whats current record single day deaths? Yes cover hands disinfectant quickly.. Soap lubricates bacteria you. disinfectant kill ir contact usually. Sounds lot like Russia... shut people wore mask washed hands. nah, seems general public can't that. Sorry job affected, herd immunity mask answer. virus real thing killing many. Sooooo much winning. hear ya. county spread out. It‚Äôs like Bay Area drive Oakland San Jose SF hit 4 counties would thought... anyone testing even half US is?

Perhaps REQUIRE testing allowing near kids again?!? reminds me, get TB test renewed. 24 hours long Ass drive don‚Äôt mind Amen that. really hope see changes soon. It‚Äôs enough really make question many people think like made far life all.  Jesus christ americans still havent moved fear mongering virus death sentence?

The average death rate average life expectancy. 

The chances actually needing hospital care extremely low. That‚Äôs actually great analogy. works person person basis, section bricks different states, demographics, political affiliation you‚Äôll find sections wall much weaker others enough pressure section fail leading complete collapse wall.. it‚Äôs exactly we‚Äôre seeing Maybe need national coverage people tragically dying alone disease. sad humans easily driven emotion reason, look happened video Floyd. **one** death immediately became salient 100,000 faceless statistics (at time) perished COVID-19, causing people think pandemic somehow *lesser* problem. let's *show* faces, heartfelt obituary many victims COVID-19 families allow shown news soul-crushing truth tragedy REAL everybody. one wearing masks here. I'd say less 1/4 people wearing masks I've seen. We're screwed. NYC suburb living Texas now. shut time all. NYC north 3k daily cases time; 100. followed shelter place guidelines nearly two months. daily case count phase 1 started currently you‚Äôre starting phases reopen. 

To stay state comment, find ironic personally know least people fled manhattan beach rentals Florida back April. They‚Äôre still working remotely likely planning heading back end month. typical?

A tidal wave, were.  insecure must wearing mask makes feel ""weak""? studied harder school, especially science class.  it‚Äôs still numbers! LA San Diego haven‚Äôt checked yet, one.

How exciting. |:  girlfriend actually immunocompromised. friend mine best health currently tested. I've going necessary, washing hands, sanitizing, good shit. People life could die people like person we're talking to.

Additionally, healthy people died coronavirus scarred lungs, neurological issues, etc.

And hospital month fucking sucks, medical bills.

Meanwhile, lot us go work order survive. work public, people wear masks. bring something home, there's good chance girlfriend die people like person aloof.  So...are they...just waiting vaccine? need drastically reduce air travel save would. say let go help planet. know shocker trump appointees trying downplay virus, but.... are. tests 16%-70% false positive rate. 

The prevalence Covid-19 estimated around 5% US, low level risk false positives becomes major problem. serological test 90% specificity, positive predictive value 32.1% ‚Äì meaning nearly 70% positive results likely false. disease prevalence, test 95% specificity lead 50% chance positive result wrong. 99% specificity false positive rate become anywhere near acceptable, even chances 16% positive results would wrong.¬† Strong leadership starting top could made difference.

You're better carrying secondary mask situation like possible changing properly particularly juicy sneeze.

I'm reading, death almost sounds better liquefied lungs aftereffects battling virus We're stubborn good. mother dementia husband, father, understands social social life outweighs needs home contract Coronavirus. They're constantly running around stuff without mask ask course can't remember it. Talk wanting pull hair out! Hindsight 20/20. Given knew time, using ventilators made sense. Avoidable using knowledge future meaningful.

The nursing home decision legitimately bad, though - given knew time, clearly terrible idea. caved quickly, Garcetti Newsom shown words powerless. Garcetti swore he'd shut everything mere semblance outbreak, now? love California, people power zero backbone. anyone really believe China isnt #1 One never ended states, first wave getting worse. imagine awful second wave really would CFR &amp; IFR calculated closed cases. 


An open case survivor, fatality, open case.  


You calculate CFR IFR including open cases, assuming survive, wrong. Everyone currently infected right now, may survive.  


Thus include closed cases calculating CFR IFR. 


It's one many oft-repeated mistakes. don‚Äôt think get üôÑ It‚Äôs required statewide now, idiot counties aren‚Äôt enforcing it. San Diego required masks bit Newsom made statewide, know Orange County Riverside weren‚Äôt requiring masks still fighting back it.

): shitton absolute morons here. San Diego pretty liberal conservative depending go. town live basically Deep South county. Tons idiots. Yeah, makes sense. I'll probably order extra supply TP/paper towels soon. well, keep numbers low, cases low. Florida, respectable. First spike hard contain. let's much less time see works. Note 27K cases Yeah, might willing roll dice take thought workers food service industry could take time sick without risking losing job able pay rent/bills. Since even ones *know* feeling well free stay home I'm take chances *and* asymptomatic ones. tell wear home-made IED loose pressure-sensitive trigger, ‚Äúlive fear‚Äù rolling hill.

Just funsies. almost like US needs Winnie pooh charge Florida right higher daily infections  I‚Äôm Georgia letting teachers parents decide want online teachers students go school teachers students. 50% capacity so. teachers want get back classroom students prioritize getting sick. thanks! Proof? could say that, sit, people getting haircuts wear masks, stop people questioning driver outbreaks. Idk I'm still issues finding lysol wipes/spray. N95's pretty much extinct non-healthcare people. archive [http://archive.is/NP99b](http://archive.is/NP99b) every country undveloped US.

Let's take Germany example, far handled crisis rather employer may also obliged relieve infected employee (or employee suspected infected) work order minimize risk infection employees. cases, employer still obliged continue pay wages.
It also possible authority may quarantine employee accordance Infection Protection Act. case, too, employee (usually) prevented working. German companies also obliged continue pay wages cases, entitled reimbursement competent working care child suffering coronavirus. principle, German employers must also continue pay wages cases period depending specific dismissal due coronavirus based general principles therefore likely ineffective cases, unless special circumstances justify dismissal. consider special termination operational reasons, checked advance labor law.

So see, country's employee's actually seen humans numbers, yes, state much able ensure financial phisical health citizens.

I sorry fellow Americans, country able so. can't deny thst feel fortunate live country whoms government uses science base decisions actually cares wellbeeing. Again, playground domination techniques. care it.

The attitudes towards handling pandemic varied, even proven links. agree notion every Swede automaton. might well call every Norwegian automaton let schools close, consider every Belarusian part hive-mind president think virus exists.

I gamble country's strategy turns better long run. think ''Swedish mentality'' opinion, entitled it. feel least bit guilty since privilege able stay home, done without failure, well critical skepticism justified, platforms access to. 

Every country's opinion corridor narrow. Sweden's happens well. 46,831 post. Unbelievable Said idiot doesn‚Äôt know covid affects lungs heart.

LOL love it. Watch raise even money ‚Äúshamed‚Äù barista lady gets nothing. She‚Äôs making way worse shit like chance episode name number? Still wearing mask; looking forward Trump losing November.

That said, I'm wondering there's idea much reported increase due widespread testing. people aren‚Äôt developing antibodies short time, could get infected right? Even mild every time could spread vulnerable people. virus strange, can‚Äôt depend immunity infection going rough time. Hopefully attenuated vaccine give longer term immunity. Abbott added ""bar setting, reality, work pandemic,"" noting people ""go bars get close drink socialize, that's kind thing stokes spread coronavirus.""

See South Korea one Gay Bar breeded like dozens cases surprising terrible.... Utah? Must people packing Zion Bryce

And course Florida would take cake landslide. furthers irony insane people arguing masks city council meeting. ""Gov.¬†Greg Abbott¬†on Friday expressed regret first known time reopening process spearheaded coronavirus pandemic, saying allowed bars open quickly.
""If could go back redo anything, probably would slow opening bars, seeing aftermath quickly coronavirus spread bar setting,"" Abbott said evening interview KVIA El Paso.""

I appreciate humility. sub, called actions reckless reopening... doubt that. However, expecting level humility, pleasantly surprised Believe whatever makes feel better. Meanwhile life China back normal economy V shaped recovery US seeing uncontrollable spread economy damaged years. fair places I've really scrupulous masks social distancing. Like lunch everyone wearing masks maintaining distance line drank patio 10 feet anyone else. order specifically targeting bars nightclubs basically ignoring masses bodies slammed together partying. realizes lost fraction pulmonary capacity. always say quiet part loud? ""I think music gatherings spreading this. know what's causing it, I'm scientist doctor anything like that, think people hanging bars beers socially causing spike cases,"" Nash said.

But... We.... We‚Äôve seen... *throws hands frustration* way. PA incredible governor Philly incredible Mayor. Don‚Äôt overlook also announced delay opening trend continues upwards. also enforcing masks social distancing. NE incredible don‚Äôt expect things get bad again. Feel sorry y‚Äôall south tho. Couldn‚Äôt me. truth beat coronavirus mask.It dit work Netherlands long keep distance good hygiene. still cases getting lesser. I'm glad he's listening.

I'm sure quite qualifies listening wait country reached new record daily infection rate rolling things back. knew it! gone, space freak! trump says cases going US beat virus........... /S think three states spiking protests states like NY Minnesota massive protests it‚Äôs deceasing don‚Äôt matter? Think moment. WNYer here, went phase 3 last Tuesday - 10 days ago. 

Last days seen upward tick cases. 

No one really talking yet days doubt many people follow numbers like do, tick seems directly line time takes get symptoms + test results back vs time started phase 3.

I fear uptick opening indoor seating restaurants bars - real big thing phase 3 brought. hoax virus goes straight mask ease CO2 molecules cannot escape mask doomed hypoxia wear one! /s We‚Äôve started reopening city governors criteria, don‚Äôt remember are. think percentage positive cases dropping number hospitalizations dropped 1000 cases.
Edit
I found this:

Hospitalization death rates

A 14-day decline coronavirus hospitalizations deaths virus three-day rolling average.

Covid, condition requiring ICU. Imagine hit drunk driver, airlifted nearest hospital, don‚Äôt capacity help early critical hours. would've guessed, right? Bartender! 2 shots bleach, please. absolute dumbass, thinks speaking publicly like somehow bring sympathy I'm concerned many people think guy saying open bars noon everyday. I've gotten used masks. Tourette's tics make wearing mask uncomfortable kinda learned juggle face using cheeks nose fall face. still wear mask, though. discomfort feel wearing mask going anywhere near discomfort infected person experience. I'm going go limb say it'll higher tomorrow. Great title! pay terrible price. point Darwinism.  rice shortage near me. Matter fact recall bulk rice (30lb) seeming fully stocked shelf grocery store would've thought pretty high barrier controlling Covid-19. 

Testing nice numbers low track trace positive cases. high numbers cases functions statistic. bit unreliable, Trump pointed days ago, test less going find fewer cases. reliable indicator number hospitalizations patients show covid suggest state &amp; federal governments now?

Close country again. complete lockdown like italians spanish medium one like one netherlands did. Lockdown best way fight surge cases. doesn‚Äôt like mask REALLY won‚Äôt like ventilator Pence says need pray really, honest, seen anything published would applicable beyond general advice I've already mentioned. Perhaps try wash hands frequently hotel necessarily touching things exposed others day. Besides that, follow general guidelines avoid areas people strictly necessary. Remember living people, air breathe (especially without mask) things touch directly touch biggest risks. infection takes place via contact droplets others breathe out. droplets either inhaled you, land eyes floating air, brought eyes/nose hands touching something. Barriers droplets masks glasses huge benefit. Rooms alone hours significantly less problematic interpersonal contact. Could? boot licker like Redfield. Sold soul devil. rot hell.  last straw sure. We'd 2 million dead without Trump's leadership

Yes, actually think decline ICU usage good thing. Canada welcomes not-so-important-but-still-relevant club bit lazy whoever wrote old press release.

They correctly stated spread virus increasing min countries concern.

The problem listed top countries purely went amount new cases without accounting countries increased number mainly increased testing. works virtually virus. immunity developed antibodies fight first time. That's literally works. Yes, new, walks like duck quacks like duck... also noted many people getting Bill's ICU stays.

Conversely 1000/100 2000/300 3000/600 means fucked keep finding proportionally cases see spike cases states like NY due protests everything know virus wrong. 

It would extremely grave implications. reason opposition devoid intelligent thought leftists good murder then.

And saga continues clarification yes, Sweden **is** still list risk countries despite earlier softer tone.

**ETA:** thought would illuminating copy paste [this excellent u/KiwiBattlerNZ gives bit depth clarity discussion pointed increased testing affecting numbers, agreed, also important note proportion positive results among tested remains stable, 12‚Äì13%,‚Äù important rate infection dropping (or even remained same), increase number people tested, would expect percentage positive tests drop - especially reason testing people changed criteria include people seriously ill thus less likely way positive rate remain stable testing increased initial infection rate much higher (but hidden lack testing) infection rate increasing way, means Swedes much risk people nations whose infection rates initially lower dropping.

Also say get ticket discourage people go out. anything say fuck nothing else lose. $10,000 fine wearing mask public. Thats way get fuckheads. look right underneath map shows California hit worse could coronavirus that's around mutated worse, could studies show lose antibodies 2-3 months.

That's ignoring testimony thousands foreigners living China; hundreds foreign journalists; fact Chinese easily access Western internet despite firewall; secondary data like China's low number export cases.

You could say Vietnam utter failure can't compare countries response Vietnam conflict participate like US. others wanted lead war know would done better worse.

In Europe, masks mandatory, gel mandatory entrance every shop, bars reduce capacity law...

That helps curve remain flat (or going like Europe)

What US? safety measures set government end pandemic? upon people choose put public health danger want? country right-wing authoritarian leader mask issues- United States, Russia, Brazil, India...

Because US thought world best country can't screw up. let pandemic brew ""oh shit"" point ICU bed close capacity. US could contain maybe 100K cases. definitely 2.5 millions. overspending tax cut, government money shut economy give people free paycheck.

That moment shit pants keep walking ahead. School starts August Florida (at least South Florida.) disclosing data openly. hiding data.

I really even want argue, anti-intellectualism prevalent .....12 18 months research first started January. That's always timeline since start pandemic fuck telling people face masks devil? lady Palm Beach, FL city council meeting said thing. meaaaaan, watching couple thousand people packed together like sardines totalllllyyyyy couldnt effect right?

i guess virus discriminates based political affiliation! California ample hospital capacity. Flattening curve isn‚Äôt reducing case volume 0. It‚Äôs exceeding hospital capacity. 

There‚Äôs 3 ways pandemic. 
1. Everyone gets it. ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù avoid hospitals run. also want everyone get reasonable timeframe 
2. wait till vaccine might never come. could take many years
3. somehow stop disease globally. technically looking reported numbers, did. wrong UP? article could find reported coronavirus deaths Boston? people US put shit? mean seriously stupid fo find system fine pretty good? ""No One Saw Coming"" /s Twitter, lot people blaming Bill Gates, ""from Bill Gates becomes doctor?"" point conspiracy Bill Gates produced virus. ridiculous, heck United States people hate Bill Gates much, Chinese respect great computer scientist, great entrepreneur, great charitarian spending money fight diseases around world? Chinese respecting make guys distrusting him? Wow lighten dude Jesus Omg. nuts. lie Boston's deaths dropping now? Brah. I'm blocking you. Take break internet.  They're spoiled growing up. wanna spoil virus children. I've deal much drama(that even business people made business) lock take yesterday work day drink away.

Think that. 

If number new confirmed cases continues accelerated rate , end next week might getting getting something like  70,000 - 80,000 new cases day. 

People need step back realize it‚Äôs over. lost. *not* able get control situation. opportunity there, blew it, opportunity gone forever. 



So it‚Äôs *likely* headed toward horrific catastrophe, it‚Äôs absolutely inevitable. 

This going one devastating tragedies ever happen country frankly doubts whether country survive it. current form, least. U.S. finally comes this, it‚Äôs going much different country today. ...how get close getting point veer away like that? Gee, wonder way related people deciding protest streets millions. Nah would racist. sure past 2 weeks we've hitting 5k often around 3-4k. Also month half averaging around 3-5k dropped comparison April kinda plateau. said deaths lagging behind increase case numbers chances we'll see death spike July. RES BWCA? Look nothing else do. Shit pause years. Go take many precautions can. It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs personal responsibility point asses individual risks. Maybe get tested go. Judging many pics/vids see internet...

If protests cause spread, entire country would spiking. world would spiking, protests occurred globally.
 
But that‚Äôs happening. people like problem/reason still going on. Self centered, selfish narcissistic. Yea. 'freedumb'... 40,000 twice big population town grew in. lot people.  someone warned him! literally don‚Äôt care wanna read post report back wrote makes absolutely zero sense?

I think that's part invincibility type thinking comes reporting bad effects elderly downplaying effects younger people help. I'm surprised younger people feel invincible death rate low, die mean fuck up. I‚Äôm sorry brother hope family makes ok. 

When kid saw video gas masks gave nightmares long time. 

Now kids going go school masks. least isn‚Äôt nuke fallout attacks. good school parents make normal them. 

It‚Äôs eerie close many fictional dystopian representations society. Honestly wondering mean comment? outbreak originated at. I've trying say repeatedly. Sorry pedant still focused comment already acknowledged poorly worded. read responses see that's I've saying entire time.

Not mention I've asked LEAVE ALONE multiple times well, I? Fucking creep. bet way women idea scared you.

Leave. Me. Alone. dont care. Think right, think whatever, go away. U A! U A! no, probably inconsequential considering people actually partook. fake news media always exaggerates everything, right? USA! USA! USA! USA! fed print much money. strategy used save economy would worked great also dealt virus once. Unfortunately gonna keep going vaccine market bound collapse point. Donny everything make sure doesn‚Äôt happen November But, bad decisions got us here... part indoor phenomenon, 100k protest I'd probably wear one, I'm gonna wear one walking around block may see one person total get within 10 ft them. makes sense real problem lack staff. ICU patients constant observation one nurse generally handle two patients time. raise ratio short period time (maybe week two) people start get exhausted. convert many hospital beds ICU wards want, exceed capacity actually staff wards properly either need find trained nurses quick it‚Äôs triage time. DeSantis trump mini me, proving trump wrong less tests doesn‚Äôt equal less cases major spread pandemic. Kindergarten laptop? even mean???

I‚Äôm also St. Louis. girlfriend‚Äôs older kids attend school county talking splitting school B groups alternating days kids came school could social distancing classroom. don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve announced decisions yet though. Imagine getting paid minimum wage, able stay home job open can't collect unemployment, surrounded people taking seriously, knowing catching covid could destroy body even could leave saddled debt pay lifetime. That's reality lot Americans Florida reporting COVID control, reporting something like 1000% increase pneumonia related hospitalizations? People making statement without reading contributions others ????  remember, world shut it.  Ahhh makes sense. everyone finally dead. cat spent solid 6 minutes licking butt I‚Äôm fairly certain higher IQ DeSantis. deaths current spike probably going significantly lower percentage wise, due lower average age? Silver lining guess. Wow, want go away... Takes 20 seconds wash hands properly. You‚Äôre telling thought gunna happen happening?? Nooooooo!!! agree you, think confusion resting originally including pneumonia mild symptom. Seriously, pneumonia. there's strange scale due that, people think, ""Severe means respirator, moderate means hospitalized they're considering respirator, mild literally everything else."" Also SC, even people vote (R), people insist mask around fucking chin enough totally disregard distancing. Like holy fuck, fuck PSA manage keep better standards distance masks Lowes? Softshell season favorite... Nah, crappy analogy. taking way personally. need go outside. ""Florida man make good decisions""

-No one, ever Biden never spoken complete sentences. Age given hesitant manner, content (in)coherent always been. Hey least guy read, actually listens briefings. Sorry could answer question. I‚Äôm firm believer ‚Äúthinking machines.‚Äù

They trillions times smarter us humans time. small group researchers sold one.

Have good day. :-) What's [not] funny way Florida goosing numbers overcounting negatives - count every negative test new patient overall infection rate appears lower percentage actually is. tell husband right this. would say, ‚Äúmy friends think I‚Äôm crazy want hang out,‚Äù calmly said thing isn‚Äôt over. hate right. Sure would nice qualified Secretary Education.   wonder everyday dad. issue theres massive lag deaths long covid takes kill people, people testing positive today start dying 2-3 weeks. Oregon getting control turned political issue instead something everyone agreed science.

That‚Äôs good know! think Dr. Amy Acton back March stating US would likely one ‚Äúlittle Italy‚Äù Wuhan one briefings. mad right stupid dangerous administration is. never right. question is, masks effective, yes. covering feet. hypocrite wear mask cover toes. lot diseases spread public feet. It‚Äôs lack leadership. Nothing going change November that‚Äôs Biden wins. not, we‚Äôre fucking screwed. averaged 15 lies day April 2020.

Like said, week two ago saw max maybe 300-400 comments daily thread. Pence didn‚Äôt mention thing briefing administration address grave national tragedy. I'll sure share recipes things get worse good idea ate.

Source? know ""good decision"" circumstances? course... I‚Äôm even surprised... That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm saying virus controlled human action. China experiencing outbreaks spite rigor. Germany New Zealand Australia. 

I guess way would explain countries let monitoring control virus come back quickly. It‚Äôs caught early it‚Äôs spread massive testing programs. Look it‚Äôs taken China control even small outbreaks.

Pull back muffins portion. fantastic delicious super healthy muffins make. almost gasped portion! Yea kind statistician work actual numbers years now.

I think it‚Äôs issue shouldn‚Äôt political become. all, we‚Äôre stuck dealing disaster mess. postpone anniversary smh head mouth watering. long old pal Flexing like 30 days infection average someone die?

This seems way like bullshit mental illness imo. partial truths mushed together bullshit.

Edit- deliberate, bullshit nonetheless. makes think maybe warnings reopening uh....right listened NPR story said may also partially explained testing issues - enough results taking long two week mean? keep wondering whether psychologically, √† certain amount aversion people mask wearing could tied Islamophobia.

/u/gaijIncompetent two counterpoints. 

1st: seasonal illness kills 1.2% victims stacks quickly. Especially 5-10% victims left disabled afterwards. it‚Äôs permanent, that‚Äôs even worse death rate. 

2nd: there‚Äôs selective pressure reduction mortality rate. It‚Äôs already low *enough.* 1.2% isn‚Äôt enough limit spread. Especially people mild cases. (And even still show lung scarring. it‚Äôs pulmonary fibrosis, progressive disease, amount initially means you‚Äôre doomed deteriorate.) Combine stupidly unfair, long incubation window still contagious, virus good go. Even could spread incubation period, would still spread like wildfire. 

We lucky mortality rate low. incubation window basically insured there‚Äôs need low mortality rate. also means virus, evolutionarily speaking, doesn‚Äôt need evolve mild. would right around 1776 I‚Äôll tell started seeing disparate separation. arrived doorstep Reagan‚Äôs trickle economy. term implies good guys money top poor people wait around underneath tips, service jobs fix BMWs. image brain hearing term makes picture wealthy people like Sec.

Thanks rational ‚Äúparticipation‚Äù Id rather fair accurate views based reality needs working class people, views CONServatist glorify defend. pesky rights always getting way. Praise Darwin. Italy peaked 6,500 cases daily. Florida hit 9,500 cases. Things going get bleak soon. Herd immunity aka letting people die.
You see essential medical workers talking herd immunity. ... 2 weeks? average lag time?

Meanwhile I'm north math get multiple customers every single day buying shorts / swimsuits telling going Florida week.

Figure 1 week there, another week come back show symptoms, another 2 weeks spread closest people, closest people, another week people start showing symptoms get tested - state's going start surging 4 5 weeks - time back school. i'm f&amp;b. owners need collectively lobby gov't assistance/subsidy. there's middle ground saving restaurants spreading COVID + destroying restaurants preventing COVID. middle ground (takeout+outdoor dining) come without gov't assistance. 

don't blame people want eat out. cool edgy.

Yes, forced go somewhere fear life everyday go starve ABSOLUTELY torture horrendously psychologically damaging. .08 confirmed cases though, it‚Äôs probably much lower no?

Grow up. say think does. COVID CAUSES LYMPOPENIA, thus weaning immune system - possibly permanently, like AIDS. 

Its funny exactly AIDS virus think say sure COVID infections resolve 4 weeks. initial claim - evidence otherwise January 30th listened podcast, Macrovoices Eric Towsend, Dr. Chris Martenson another guest show. went worstcase senario virus. said biggest problem virus countries handle it. Asian cultures quick follow orders, Japan, Singapore, China etc, they'lldo fine. Western societies, said, ""I proud American,"" one tell us exactly tough time controling spreads, likely will, US. I'm quoting memory June give listen, bold statement, working worse expected. Meh.. sure I‚Äôd personally wear mask outside boat. risk outdoor transmission seems low ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôll take rushed vaccine means get roll dice superpowers Whoosh problem schooling teach evaluate risk. lot people reasonably fathom would take drastic measures little risk minimization. conspiracy theories pop up.

""These people smart scared tiny risk, smoke like chimney, scared death"".

""Some scientists exceptionally low risk tolerance, address utility non social distance society.""

See mean? people smart people, academics. need evade risk insignificant? make insane sacrifices, business, college year, mild threat?

If continously holify experts people understand smart people make particular risk benefit decision. deem disproportional something else must going on.

Basically every single person know conspiracy prone right mind believe scientist would make sacrifices threat level.

We horrifying car accidents year, heart disease, cancer, lung disease.

But Covid19 threat justifies society people dread never want live in. Forbidding cigarettes question people, threat comes along everything justified. isolate elderly homes, pauze large part economy scare everyone ""new normal"" virus 0.6% IFR?

How feel reasonable?

Yes get it, third party risk. Cigarettes personal risk.

But car accidents work way. people conspiracy prone.

I deem governments incompetent conspiracies even clueless proportional. Conclusion something else informed about. risk evaluation decision beyond rational comprehension lot people.

I think overexaggerate covid19 narrative ""both young old"" risk. instead ""the old risk groups"" danger young people really much fear.

Our media still pretends sometimes young people real danger. 

2 days ago national news programme zero corona fatalities cases gave person airtime cried overestimate virus.

They honest. whenever show people numbers turn conspiracy prone earth explained. Remind me! 31 October 2020 fuckin 5 clock shadow. man are, Joe. We‚Äôre headed wrong direction. could predicted this? üòÄ long exponential spread pick up

What mean here? spread factor anything time infection reported

I agree hospitalizations deaths take long, makes sense exhibit symptoms deteriorate point critical condition/death, takes extra time. That's different however.

Assuming takes people 5 days average exhibit symptoms decide get tested, another 3-5 days get results back (average currently) means cases currently see infected around 10 days back. Unless Florida massive delay processing tests?  really think Biden savior? lol Dude senile can't form complete sentence half time.  never happen here. Ever. can't even get people use mask.  That's crazy keeping Disneyland closed. would think good idea open larger park? someone living SoCal love everything comment. yet need drivers license, else I‚Äôm driving license!!!!! Actually, no.

The Chinese people lot trust government right thing them, willing cooperate basis. talking about?! tsunami absolutely wave... jesus america. guys perhaps mixture things?

no social distancing. people living cramped conditions many people sleeping place probably lead quite large initial viral load. know relationship asymptomatic cases lack large viral load initial exposure, however. 

lack exposure outside world could leave people worse immune systems

the jury still whether virus affects certain ethnic groups severely others

these groups being, potentially, unhealthy less able deal virus bodies producing responses we've seen

this, along kind placebo, munchausen type syndrome, people produce symptoms upon seeing others around (the mind powerful thing) could contribute.

Americans? much. much lower cohesiveness, demonstrated people refusing wear masks, governments reopening much soon. propaganda Nazi Germany. Err mean great US A! human race mature enough fast traveling information. undoing.

I've felt way while. firmly believe people 20th century ready atomic bomb, ready internet.

The small percentage humans power damn us all. 

We must damn first.  HAHAHA!!!! think AZ's numbers would higher capacity process tests. There's growing backlog now. Another machine arrives July 6. I‚Äôm getting 0.17% total NYC deaths people 18-44 underlying conditions according words Yes is. forget Americans even $400 emergency money. Well. Thanks lot, mice. people protesting wearing masks, big issue. big issue fact every state decided reopen, people getting tired inside well-being. people know H2O water, let know approx 20% air oxygen lose tiny minds Shut up, snowflake. wants angry. Received ""bad"" news returned home work today.

Including engines check systems. come long way 40 years. California spiking may prove theory it‚Äôs going it‚Äôs going every area go spike. Wow, right thing. 5% high. Almost entirely Sun Belt too, goddamn. two weeks behind data though. still spike Memorial Day after. wait see multiplicative effect infected people socializing past two weeks. going much worse 4 mo ago, virus took foothold spread even more. get it. rationale deleting FB? family cares much text give call. Sorry, subs 100% gone? Cuz pay worth risk? Hillary wasn‚Äôt planning major healthcare reform either. really think people underestimate much required fix this. 

We‚Äôre facing economic devastation Great Depression levels. don‚Äôt think anyone would argue 2008 crises handled well.

The people helm. results likely same: great. It‚Äôs better continuing spiral Trump, think faith misplaced. always wonder type upbringing Karens had. chose wear mask going grocery store Starbucks, mom would give lecture also proceed beat ass. Wearing mask protecting OTHERS well. mean, something went wrong growing up, something made narcissistic entitled. kids never like this...I hope... American humanity, much different everywhere else world. three hours. get update cactus-ass situation? MERICA last day March 25k cases. Death day peak 3 weeks later April 18.

So need see 3 weeks today deaths peak. Also things totally lockdown peak could take much much longer reach 3 weeks. Came see top comment something along lines Good job fucking taxes next year vote that! Bonus- could get married way earlier! Imagine first reaction lockdown mind control worldwide leftist organization.

If anyone good subtly controlling world's governments there'd need stay hidden, already flawlessly. Remind Trump going fire him. severely underestimating many people see school free daycare Karen Whale's Vagina Gyms open Orange County. It‚Äôs crazy me. hospital workers get infected too. Difficult operate maximum capacity workforce getting sick infectious. really does. It‚Äôs got sort vibe watching horrified fascination disbelief numbers tallied... live NYC see hear people around me. People leaving this. Working remotely this. going Manhattan want wear mask hours weather. discourage people stuff. Wrap hot/humid weather spend money, stay home/move somewhere else? 

 boogeyman? Come on, grow up. Outside internet people need freaking breath going go daily life wrapped mask. means spending money. NYC needs $$$$ survive. already $8BN, 9% budget shortfall half-way done. thing missing post ending ""yeee hhaawww"" take while. Many new cases younger age group, think take get older age groups. Also Texas Florida whatever reason, low death rates. also better treatments. We'll find month sure. older people party much younger people going protests much. I'm sure older people c ok ntribute tok sounds like data younger people noticeably contributing more. Well antibodies last least 3 months. Wife sick March tested positive antibodies week. actually got results back. I‚Äôll go without mask anything it‚Äôs nice finally idea wrong back then. Let's close Disneyland! I‚Äôm sure statement lost regime. guys fuked. could believe *and* also believe elections rigged? co-ordinate massive deception gaslighting would even bother actual elections. Darwinism.  that's wondering.... understand nude beach... :) ignore virus go away like miracle heard BAC 0.08 kills virus dead tracks. opening many bars possible encouraging much drinking possible. guy fucking deserves covid-19. Seems like he‚Äôs worked really hard get it. Meanwhile Canada, reported 172 cases today. really miss monthly trips US, keep border closed. warned us early post explaining hit/r/bestof day... Basically called Loyalty Test something, happens everywhere. Yakuza, get full body tattoo, cut pinky. marks life, proves loyalty. cultures groups similar sorts things. Fraternities severe hazing another.

It's usually dangerous, makes visible group member of, proves loyalty. wearing mask one. right face visible, dangerous, taking extra risk real gain except people see ""side on"", proves loyalty. That's fight hard. became symbolic gesture loyalty test. stupid treated early sure. think speak fact say it‚Äôs late folk. Don‚Äôt ‚Äúsnowbirds‚Äù go south winter? that. low working memory despise conspiracy theories. I've also met intelligent people (supposedly physicist example) believed conspiracy theories. 

I'd also like make argument beliefs many religious people could considered akin conspiracy theories. plagued deficiency working memory. Careful, Texas' tail. fair working. point unemployment keep people afloat look new job forcing take jobs significantly past job. Add interviews job search done online, reason look. Trump‚Äôs pandemic going CVS...it pretty much option. ):

How get tested Scripps? Buy toilet paper dump stocks- panic time. Wow, awful! 

Having server various points life, always pretty clear owners managers rarely gave full shit staff, threatening livelihood ok working setting pandemic high risk child home whole nother level... Houstonian litterally untrue. Almost non essential buisnesses closed mid late March begining May. opened soon, waaay fast. File under: actual nightmare. want officially say I've protesting....but yeah, people wearing masks protesting. 

And fairly well virus, despite San Francisco second-most dense city entire country. ludicrous conspiracy. know 5G even work yet??? kills everyone would wear mask, would lot easier open back economy... [CO2 lake killed this, obviously. Wear mask. Mah Freedumb! OK. think people would say ""inland"" mention specific area. resumed Sunday church? think business' expected more. Subway bit ago customer wearing mask. sign door wear mask employees said absolutely nothing jerks breaking Washington state law wearing mask. But, sake workers think needs bit measured. business' employees think make choice aggressive be. 

Age limits cigs alcohol around forever accepted, really punk kids employees worry about. people oppose mask different breed. 

For record, mother problem enforcing rules store works, I'm concerned may come across unhinged info wars psycho. Presidents given up. probably doesn‚Äôt even want president anymore compatible NEW XBOX. Neither, get grip. Grandparents adults. hospitalized doesn‚Äôt mean organs won‚Äôt damaged.

You experience symptoms still sustain permanent damage lungs. Awww, man. great comment too. really catch eventually. Plenty countries lowered daily cases 0 near see opening fully safely now. We're stuck super high case rates going kill economy lot longer we're failing contain virus.  They‚Äôre variations single political perspective.  Y'all realize cynical comment, right? Bill Burr would say 

""OH LOOK IM FUCKING TOUGH OPEN NOSE THROAT."" friend works Waffle House, called freaking guy came there, ordered food, chit chatted, told course conversation told girlfriend positive, okay little hacking headache -unlike poor girlfriend, hospitalized.

He wearing mask ""ain't sick"".
She made order go, told he'd leave, got super offended, screaming ""I shouldn'a even told y'all!"" way out.

Guaranteed guy still there, spreading virus around, feeling completely justified WH made leave. situation describe would never want see child again. really restraint, I'm stuck home like go people meaningful way I've honestly run emotional energy arguing social media. 

Honestly, point I'm almost numb. Like alright, y'all whatever fuck want. I'm going best make sure family close friends stay safe. Hookers, Klan meetings, dog fights, cock fights. Right. understand that, intentionally misunderstand it. 100% true, much much testing now. percent positive tests starting go interesting (and bad) sign. Ughhh feel bad everyone Lompoc. lot people live SM work Lompoc vice versa feel like it‚Äôs connected. SM getting bad. might depend sterilization protocols test. I'm testing people may test hot..yeah I'm taking made serious taking time insure dont accidentally pass every person line test. That's guess. I'd take either point. However, think cool new type vaccine market. I'm hoping they're successful CDC put guidelines reopening notes reopening southern states didn‚Äôt meet *any* them, let alone them.  
Then again, President nation saying CDC dumb nobody follow them. course states reopen official scientific justification ‚Äúwe feel like it‚Äù.  Lol shit poll God wanted every single one 124,000 people die, happened percentage coronavirus positive people donating plasma? r u real tho 47341 called protestors symptoms starting show. People act like happen northeast phase in. There's got sort fine take. Glad make decision even passed longer, many people livelihoods going oermanently affected can't afford basic items. That's said.

Burials. Everybody needs buried one day, speeds process. may actually make things cheaper mass deaths usually accompanied cheaper alternatives like cremations virus spreading keeps funerals smaller/cheaper engagements.


Cost treatment. enough people get sick, cost treatment. hospitals full, people increasingly die home resulting lower cost. Also, week ventilator today cheaper months chemo years.

We're going stay safe let idiots play one out. üò© Dont go San Diego county free testing. Go Scripps something.

It took two weeks test get processed. think challenging legality behind order. NC required wear masks @5 today. Gotta give points going sports theme. would loud that, admire restraint.

Ashley Smith, cofounder ReopenNC, said group would hand-deliver petition 6,000 signatures House Speaker Tim Moore, asking lawmakers block mask requirement investigate Gov. Roy Cooper‚Äôs executive order. Florida‚Äòs kinda sort well known point underreport cases. So...yeah. Eh CDC totally blew one. Mask bad, mask good m‚Äôkay. people naturally don‚Äôt believe cdc anymore want. ‚ÄúScience‚Äù isn‚Äôt exact I‚Äôm firm believer mask + social distance cuts viral load Half measures like closing bars enough point. month much Texas like NYC was. many schools opening middle that. Early stage? ain't early stage, dead smack middle outbreak. It‚Äôs natural believe leaders say tho US hot mess I‚Äôm embarrassed. 'dumb' Elon Musk?

Wow. set bar high.

Pray tell us self-made billions world-changing inventions.  People die causes hospitals overwhelmed It‚Äôs almost like likes attention Probably mid-late February telling people they‚Äôre crazy think COVID gonna big deal. 

They talking worldwide pandemic, lockdowns every country, supply chain disruptions, economic collapse. fucking way, right?

Welp... thought immunity conferred animal models according early study data released weeks ago? Good potential therapeutic, vaccine? live heart San Diego seems like city whole pretty good job masks April May. protesting looting came went seemed like focus shifted COVID issues, people stopped listening news updates virus. No, that's possibly work. nothing definitive it.

Unless believe possible ever cold flu once? American, things aside, can‚Äôt name one individual participated ‚Äústudies‚Äù keep saying thing different percentages. 

This in, New poll finds 99% post making numbers. lmao. except I'm not.

also, enjoy success concerned others, called empathy, likely psychopathic, understand that. Could show statistics show higher percentage? whole thing made lose hope left humanity good post disagreement much executive authority president could theoretically wield pandemic. federal government could easily find legal justification nationwide stay home order mask order. There's enough fucking executive authority delegated things like NDA patriot act President basically whatever wants face genuine national emergency i.e. global pandemic.

Trump's deliberate refusal invoke executive power fight coronavirus Presidency ending scandal past President Trump shrug. didnt even utilize national defense act speed PPE production obvious going shortages.

He also authority order things like temperature checks, antigen testing, quarantine, etc international borders. Literally nothing done jan/feb knew cases going start coming US abroad .

Basically contention Presidency actually provide range tools broad powers national emergency Trump could've used ease blow COVID19 didnt. wish There's large effort silence biologists assert, correctly, strong correlation sex gender, biological sex exists, trans activists. Also, google ""shut STEM"" learn one, recently gained lot traction amongst mostly legitimate BLM protests. scientists expect get approval fall. Even one fails, ones far along. block travelers high case states well. Including small states like Arkansas virus spiking God embarrassing. Embarrassing Floridian conservative. guys making us look like bunch uneducated doofuses. Chief Florida Man right folks I'm Dallas raging well park around corner house jammed packed picnics sports people generally living up, breathing other. noped heck instead walking dog there.

Plenty people stay home anymore forced still somewhat less that. Seems like might worth reaching local AG DA, sayin' difference US new case rise happening twice fast. Iran took 4 weeks go inflection first peak height. US took two weeks. acceleration deaths probably occur faster. Happy hour starts 6am! Things pretty good NY NJ. things control here. 90%? I‚Äôm seeing it. people lie polls like this? antivax folks believe anyways. They're scared injecting stuff body, fine, see bit logic even though believe it. what's piece cloth gonna them? least specific locations (and Newsom stopping them). San Francisco delayed next stage reopening, example. Try 47,231. mean, think going happen? Yeah unfortunately lot ignorance here. know means nothing us dumb, enough like Trump Jr. What's going say bodies pile up? Thanks Einstein. months? Yes, let's look literal source pandemic, well generator second outbreak, guidance situation. ""But random testing"" retired week. Thank you, Taker! live Monroe, driving town way home tonight. packed families people shopping. masks.

He parent everyone do, intrude liberties wants ""the big philantropist"". obsessed PR coming across einstein generation funding laughably biased documentary Netflix.

He actually helps innovation rather contribute police society every single issue less important relatively small risk dying virus.

Did Bill Gates save us virus? not. thing thank Bill Gates massive increase digital surveillance distrutst civil liberties virus killrate 0.6% something cower for. man put seal approval society unpleasant relatives prefer risk virus without IC fall back on.

My parents made continued usual prone hysteria. Neither grandmother, people used fight worldwars freedom. everyone pretends great threat. absolutely people suffered real threats: exactly kind life easily ban virus.

And get started economic devastation. Corona like war drugs, marginal benefit insane wastefulness. 

But opinion feel free disagree me. Yessir step right I'm isolating, I'm Wendy's

Omg not.

Edit: lol downvotes. ok, way. life permanently ruined. whole ass mood. I‚Äôm gonna assume haven‚Äôt paid much attention news last month so... Yep, finally started back work restaurant two weeks ago, serving staff put masks go dining room back. single cook (except me) wearing mask. see extra hand washing. one washing hands soon enter building. started discuss new numbers anything associated COVID another employee usually surprised idea rise numbers... also people say crap cold.. 47,230 new cases Trending hashtags mean next nothing. Actual poll numbers combined hospital data likely real engine behind change policy. always punchable faces? smugness comes through? injustice whether people get margaritas. 

Protesting rioting same. right lump together  Karma Latte served cold. Bad bot! Fuckin hate randomly removes comments conversations So... ummm... guys looking investor? Like said, make agreement friends socially distant 2 weeks go safely socialize problem solved. Europe worked well. Write mask ordinance summon Karens. Aka can‚Äôt enforce it. Fines won‚Äôt shit, paying fine can‚Äôt result jail time since can‚Äôt enforce arrests jail time. took away power enforce rules, knew Herd immunity measures safely dropped safely go back normal. measures kept (social distancing, working home, extended sick leave etc) significantly lower amount needs immunity order control spread.

Also, 60-70% often stated required herd immunity homogenous population immunity randomly distributed. reality (heterogenous population), people contact people others. people likely contract virus spread it. Therefore, likely among first gaining immunity well. means lower percentage immunity needed immunity gained natural spread disease.

I've seen estimates suggesting around 50% immunity required using heterogenous models, obviously models much complex uncertain - especially considering little know corona spreads. 

With mind seem weird drop 20% immunity. guess can't really say anything sure, speculation.

(Disclaimer: I'm advocating herd immunity obvious reasons, think interesting immunity spread works) Sort copying post another thread. launched Florida Covid-19 dashboard....

Rebekah Jones, scientist, fired asked manipulate Florida's dashboard COVID-19 data. launched [her Covid dashboard ""official"" Florida 

Compare. check out, thank you!  like climate change California same. well letting people high case States (including small ones like Arkansas etc. see big spike coming up.) Don‚Äôt dense. There‚Äôs plenty people going stores aren‚Äôt protesting practicing social distancing wearing masks. party zero proceeding this. little pre-Memorial Day speech refusing close beaches anywhere. He's real sonovabitch. Fingers crossed! America‚Äôs huge. packed. Easing lockdown, strict mask rules, stupid people, densely packed population, etc. It‚Äôs bound hop rates cases hoping wouldn‚Äôt happen. Hospitalization rate 15% March/April. around 5% now, possibly lower, per Fauci today's news conference. Albeit seems highly unlikely protests would done alone, can't say protests factor all, way objectively know yet, make claim. Well done! remember march hit milestone 100k *infected* worldwide. felt big. risk. Again, understand risk. fairly common people limited intelligence like understand basic concepts like risk. media hype job.

The media hype job far-right wing media reopen thinking going consequences. Sorry fell it. But, again, smart parrot. live small Northern California city lucky wife essential workers haven‚Äôt lost income this. virus really hasn‚Äôt effected family‚Äôs lives like others grateful.

With said, walked CVS today pick prescription root canal today. consciously wear mask anywhere I‚Äôm inside even though don‚Äôt like it, protect others. shocked amount people visited CVS wearing masks. 20 minutes waiting prescription saw 9 people without masks. It‚Äôs job say anything went business eventually left store.

I right wing anyone can‚Äôt figure it‚Äôs hard put mask minutes inside public place lose leave get car. want normalcy come back. I'm glad that. I'm watching whole meeting. absolutely insane.

http://discover.pbcgov.org/countycommissioners/Pages/bcc-meeting-videos.aspx?videoid=BCC/2020/20200623-bcc-workshop-mtg What's this? Yes. Europe. story Korean woman wore mask UK, people would look crossly her. put muslim head cover (and mask underneath guess), smiled her.

People look oddly Denmark too. supposed mostly rare sight. yet reddit panicking everyday. Strange. feel like read headline every fucking day. already airlines already got bailed out. money go already.... DeSantis smug little ass demanding apology critics opening soon. How‚Äôd work us? That's lot words say Thanos nothing wrong. I'd lot concerned safety efficacy Moderna's American vaccine one oldest respected universities world, foreign country reason care wins November. honestly people places, OC, know better entitled POV way going listen first place. starts affecting personally. hope kid gets enough money deal Karen's shitty job anymore. 47k according World Meters. Still little bit time update count. podcast made drop joe‚Äôs listen stuff on. fun one bert. I'd like see baseball, 60 games ""season"" anyway, exposition games? could team play division once. could play wherever felt safe, whenever felt safe. Put game TV I'd probably watch whole league. Well California large populace upticks mainly areas lean red refused put mask mandates place.    scary hours maybe spread around bit?

(shhh, Karens everywhere) Interventions, aisle 8 stupid much longer  stupid people everywhere, particularly stupid people never learn properly validate sources facts/data people never want believe challenged. types people believe anything long vaguely fits world view, never hold honest debate you.

The problem America, significant amount people. significant, got moron chief elected several morons states. leader telling wear mask, need to.

As mask usage general, think really necessary average flue season. personal opinion though. Hope true. also heard gave pigs second dose, antibody counts rose lot one dose. Oxford vaccine far dead. Sounds like got fucked family bro. I'm sorry. feel you. Governor's early response pandemic exceptional. havent seeing rate increase neighbors are, i'm certain that's going change. Karen's philosophy NUMBER ONE!!! NUMBER ONE!!! Go average hospital. new outbreak, though- still one. Ya back March almost testing done. like said must 100k+ day reality. honestly know whether laugh cry. Get busy living get busy dying. least 40 people allowed die Texas Florida! knew deaths cap 40. relief. Good point, drive work months. Can't die car accident drive! Ventura county full red necks flaunt it. Absolutely ridiculous. can't believe fucking stupid country times. think people would come together hard times, think elderly others risk, put mask, stay away deal it. Nope! People selfish. moment stopped big news protests hot, new thing, people stopped caring much. can't focus anything long. People get bored decided make political issue. many people died. Families wiped become nothing statistic instead person. Remember Jason Hargrove, bus driver, died coronavirus made video talking woman coughed bus without mask? People angry used example wear masks. I'll bet people saw forgot remember reading this.

I go grocery store month mandatory people wear masks. May people covered up. saw two families wear masks. people lined front stores. June saw majority wearing masks elderly employees. others wearing masks, weren't. lines front stores. People gathered outside eat. understand can't eat mask on, even separated. wonder July like. hospitals still empty than? Well deserved  does.that help quarterly earnings?

(Sad can't /s this) Yes, look number hydroxychloriquine prescriptions written healthy people year see well distributing treatment need it- unproven treatment massive negative side effwcts.

 complete chaos Fed try get profiteering take 2 weeks symptoms start

Well rarely 2 weeks, usually 5 days. hope good recovery. Stay safe fellow Texans. hope political quarantine snow birds. Georgia colleges seem pushing person classes fall well Yes, question deaths per cases deaths per estimated infections Many us States suffer severe case ethnocentrism No, inoculate Children telling expect explaining wrong. works better contact. There's psychological research behind it. Well considering fucked USA covid19, doubt countries would want risk getting another outbreak tourism money. expect 3x amount daily new cases, even still, cdc est death rate .026% + better understanding covid doubt avg deaths per day goes past 40/day mid July. Mid 30's per day probably - stable new death rates rather declining. 

It's interesting people say FL governor faking death rates, narrative met. work would pay taxes Flew recently United disappointing say least. excited good PR blocking middle seats requiring masks. Well apparently suggestion. first leg, mask wearing ubiquitous, row lady row next mine took mask eat never put back dirty looks finally caught attention figured out. 

On second leg terrible. entire flight packed, bunch stolen valor wannabe military guys walked bandanas loosely mouths immediately ripped soon boarded. flight attendants would wear mask walking aisle soon got back little kitchen area would take masks chat. One flight attendants would come ask wanted water pull mask talk basically spitting face.

Luckily N95 face shield whole flight quarantined got tested didn‚Äôt get sick thankfully, would absolutely give another cent airline right they‚Äôre acting recklessly. felt like active war zone entire 8 hour flight. People want belive conspiracy, cannot. usually stupid, perfer believe victims life losers. Mirroring context basically emulating someone else's body language make feel ease. People feel better others around seem feeling them, even feeling negative. person crosses arms, cross yours. smile, smile. appear concerned, appear concerned. gets empathize subconscious level makes receptive say.

Again context, unconditional positive regard basically means force treat person rational, competent adult even words actions indicate otherwise. let get emotionally involved discussion instead politely listen person's words, treating whole conversation normal. make feel validated respected person, necessarily agreeing them. necessary tell anything they're saying makes sense, important continually assert right think think, generally give benefit doubt assuming good reason beliefs. This, much like mirroring, serves purpose getting person relax, receptive, see person well. practice UPR people subconsciously you, give opening change mind get question themselves.

I'm person responded I've using techniques like everyday life long time generally good results. try stuff like feel important leverage position valid purpose like expressing safety concern work without pissing anyone off, get someone who's aggravated pissed become reasonable again. sort thing time people eventually notice realize fake. BLM protests separate issue coronavirus. Also NYer, Cuomo damn good job containing coronavirus. proud hell him. Yeah, posts like one cumulative deaths per million silly, honestly. seems entire segment population realize takes time die getting infected. Absolutely good news.

We keep seeing ‚Äú+8 deaths‚Äù marked ‚Äúgood news‚Äù. get it. It‚Äôs better +300 deaths, it‚Äôs still 8 lives. 8 worlds. 

So yeah, maybe treat sickest prevent deaths win! Come on, covid. people would willing commit mass acts kindness without media attention. wait deaths skyrocket. honestly think Tuesday 4th July break record deaths. is. sucks. im confident ok. borrow money family willing banks. think we'll ok im also sure govt gonna provide nothing Right?!?!? keep reading articles see eventually bring back. Nothing far Back 90s, stoners burnouts. Now, society. fair, people respect cashiers, co-workers, immune-compromised family members. 

Those people assholes. Sorry deal thank helping people die. liberal media spreading virus /s Undeleteparent bit undeletes deleted comment someone commented person deleted it, it‚Äôs banned sub apparently  No, virus acting like Spanish Flu. still first wave infections decline summer evidenced outbreak tropical climate like Brazil. 

Only way control mandate everyone wear masks, addition testing well contact tracing shown East Asian countries.

Wear masks folks! Damn, thought February implemented March SAYS THEY'RE GATHERINGS. Sometimes want family sized cake... me. ahh. oh. bad then, guess. need right anyway. Except family members nieces live tested positive... preventable deaths, overall non-COVID-19 mortally somewhat reduced due lower pollution, fewer motor vehicle accidents, forth. Subway surprisingly empty. Enough room people sit ends seat, away other. wtf nearly half 2 countries.  Eh think best option give grocery stores couple days prep let us go get need, assign us days go halfway Even street street use intelligent probabilistic model. requires organization certain extent forced testing various populations. U think likely US? RemindME! EOY ‚Äúlows March ?...‚Äù Summer heat gets rid disease, cancer know hit it.  Thank you! thanks check later lunch time go eat spagetti Certainly missed then, eh? there's one thing nobody said said, happened chinese new year, people go back hometown week week earlier Jan25, possibility emigration epicenter low.    
    
Also, went back home, already packed ton hongbao (red packet $$$), also yearly bonuses company, normal food stored stay family, also lot places closed CNY(that's normal 1/2 weeks)  Unfortunately Quebec report today likely that, think numbers still looking good. lowest number new cases Ontario since March I'm optimistic things keep improving long people continue careful follow rules. estimate us. Ok? still likely actually worse back March right now. Right ***now***. agree there‚Äôs coming think we‚Äôre danger real ugly numbers next weeks due said backlog, bad particular moment actually think March worst comparison. We‚Äôll likely make March look like child‚Äôs play since seem insistent ignoring time around back then, got bad went lock downs. drive testing location La Jolla. need call ahead schedule. Insurance covers it. Sounds like good play. need same. anything helps drink home ""good time"". Uh yeah, open mindedness. I'm saying cut ties family agree them. said applies situations family members may capable respectful discussion and/or already determined two parties agree. agreeing fine, people different worldviews, one feel forced either a) participate conversation want participate in, especially tends turn ugly b) sit insulted ridiculed beliefs. There's nothing wrong establishing boundaries comes politics family, can't healthy, respectful discussion encourage it. I'm pretty sure none above, unless there's secret option mention? 21,000 Aug 15 calling shot. Optimism free money hide structural problems short time.  I‚Äôm Aus freaking state (Victoria) 19 cases day popping up. Sydney concerned 1 new case community transmission. 

Do vast majority US care anymore? Well really case, /r/PublicFreakout got big videos rarely actually contain public freakouts like originally. new sub made, yeah comments pretty right wing there. original sub kind like (I stick around funny videos) Nothing like life death experiment citizens state. need bill tell this? Wtf wrong you? Fuck. source? even know taxes work?? one knows anything. guess come decision end July. I‚Äôm curious others know see happening. Teachers usually last find district. That's sold. Honestly, white cake phenomenal! Two layer cheesecake ganache between. Yum! 

... hope bring back vaccine Pence right - flattened curve. people use disinfectant, wear masks, follow normal cautionary procedures, believe least heavily reduced. point masks lower spread COVID-19, airborne disease. Take grain salt, though, people show things without masks, even show places testing positive COVID-19. believe less compared large busy states reopening bars restaurants. Even US perfectly executing there's always threats like Brazil even give crap virus. We'd get reinfected anyways point future. Unless world unites effort life going forward, damn shame. government ashamed itself, especially vigilant fighting protestors. energy directed coronavirus may made real difference. late already gained weight il already physically ready get fucked virus..... Defund fucking police. choose live somewhere, get majority wants. don‚Äôt like move. Oh there's gonna another peak infections sure. considering many celebrations (but fuck celebrate, anything hang flag upside down...) outdoors. might help keep things down. protests see huge increase. mostly indoor settings.

I'm predicting Tuesday cause there's always weekend backlog tests death reporting. since holiday, many testing sites closed coroners gonna reporting next week. reports previous holiday weekend come in... ohhhhh boooy. That's thing self proclaimed ""geniuses"" miss, want people follow rules make stupid rules. Outdoors masks better superstition cases. Treat people like kids they'll act like em. year's flu season started influenza B. rare flu season start B almost flu seasons less B deaths A. second half season dominated slightly mutated form 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza.

A grand total 0 claims true. country selling diseased animals people. think Billy Bob eating diseased squirrel Missouri people start getting sick would warrant notice world wrong. Btw forget government reacted Snowden releasing information. Ahhhhh sorry get that. thanks downvoting ignorance. I'm sure referring to.  Wow. New England/northeastern US must really bit bubble. see weird mask inside public establishment nowadays. People may wear correctly, &amp; wear them. I'm nervous day signs come people explicitly allowed stores without mask on. itt: doomers part problem is. one understands (or willing accept) much thing sucks get themselves. say feels worse flu, lying. know everyone seems think eventually happen them, they'll probably asymptomatic get it. one way knowing happen get sick. I'm saying die even end hospital; I'm saying think worth wearing mask every day thing means go again. take risk to? make good decision TELL DO. good decision TOLD DO. 

If don‚Äôt tell ‚Äúbad‚Äù decision - it‚Äôs personal choice based opinion masks good bad. Unfortunately, US thinks wearing mask infringes rights think form bdsm shit. Fucking dumbasses man god. work Dwight Schrute. said world needs new plague season three, episode fifteen. got wish KNOWN cases president vice president attendance. Suddenly puts Secret Service agents perspective.  understand problem people believing science. r/Masks4All ! aren‚Äôt saying people die quarantine - again, chopping directors words without context baiting question disingenuous know it. Lmao go detail, specifically comes using digital technology trace steps. Problem track people/friends/relatives phones track warn others stay away specific area.

Privacy laws US prevents without consent warrant. makes sense. notion chicago china, wuhan, started raised huge red flag. wuhan clearly virus took strong foothold propagated rest world.

it's likely prior year virus started one less populate areas world.

what's clear many countries testing samples far enough past. bet many checking samples year. leads problem regarding testing people contact people china. kind limited testing prevents finding true origin virus.

somebody clearly knows virus came clearly government little possible figure virus's true origin.

the best way test virus via blood banks throughout world. need test far back 2 years. Here‚Äôs comparative numbers. reports people recovered heart problems? E.U. recovering quite well I've heard. Theve closed borders United States get sorted out, frankly dont blame poorly we've handled situation. Damn he's dumb! r/Masks4All Murica yep kids end going foster schools shit cuz parents died much attributed reopening protests? Tell players I'm stoned. European pros know Boll, Waldner, Ovtcharov. Lol  trip continued party, would joined ranks ‚Äúpeople can‚Äôt stay home?‚Äù

This seems bit hypocritical. Laws mean anything they're enforced jumped plane without parachute. far good. theory lol. what's there.
Videos prove it, one way another.
I dont believe disbelieve, suspicious nonetheless

Instead quick judge, relax bit Wearing mask political opinion certain states decided needed bars open month ago. curve never really flattened. Lmao fucking joking Pretty much wait see. Money pwease!!!!!! New record! USA USA USA. 

Seriously though, wholesale failure response COVID. Absolute disaster. That‚Äôs makings multi-superspreader event warns? already happening!!!! Pence imagining God looking approving free speech Fauci surely need professional counseling colossal failure halt spread disease USA.

More testing? anyone really believe Fauci thinks testing save USA? understand professional expert opinion means nothing dumbass president? September time lockdown again. ""leaders"" still think put time limit virus move certain date. can't take anymore. think Newsom's brain got taken virus around Memorial Day. must virus zombie now, abiding commands virus head. DNRTFA pretty sure reason-after end detention center *breakin tha law ‚öñ.* What's next gonna straight set juvie kids convicts free? 

Sorry judge nutter use Corona scapegoat this. virus nullify crime. Ok I've seen times, never find solid stats it. Oh shit. feel bro, maybe I'm British Columbia I'm surrounded idiots overall, depression milder Don‚Äôt forget ‚Äúmasks breeding grounds virus !!! shouldn‚Äôt wear you‚Äôll die‚Äù crowd Hopefully bunch bitchy Karen‚Äôs get refused service future former friend (I cut contact message) lives wrote awhile back, posting ill covid &amp; asking people wear masks:

""I share experience hope helps eliminate fear! 
We already live woods naturally isolated. business never stopped always subcontractors coming out; partner‚Äôs kids still come visit us along friends; neighbors hang us time; go store it‚Äôs business usual, 15% people wear masks one gives anyone eye wearing (we don‚Äôt wear never have); people aren‚Äôt separated 6 feet everywhere.

""The doctors said healthy people cannot spread people. get ‚Äòcleared‚Äô healthy immune system."" [AND AGAIN- PRETTY SURE KNOW FORMERLY PERFECTLY HEALTHY PEOPLE DEAD DEBILITATED PROBABLY SOMETHING SAY THAT]

Different states operate differently. doesn‚Äôt matter slightest.

The real question possibly believe extremely high density areas people safe distances didn‚Äôt contribute extremely spread virus.

How delusional be? Illinois here! would mandate masks enforce would dramatically curb spread. Hopefully least much. Oh, pandemic's guys!

We'll wait see happens, groan every time read research casts doubt likelihood effective vaccine developed. Even mitigating drug treatments found, shudder think life would like live disease forever. Especially keep [catching one selfish see people dying thousands think campaign favorite politician. stupidity statements horrendous. however basically refused dying breath.

It's number one risk transmission outside home. Boston got slammed too, lots international travel Europe It‚Äôs scary. Reddit fucking hub people freaking out. testing article March 2nd.  remember alamo......


no im kidding remember make people scared finally listen.

pbskids.org understand it, many locales money follows child, parent puts private/parochial/charter school tax money allocated instead public school. deVos among others keen charter system, funnel public funds for-profit schools. mantra. Three simple things!! Good thing testing stopping 21st century began, human evolution turning point. Natural selection, process strongest, smartest, fastest, reproduced greater numbers rest, process favored noblest traits man, began favor different traits. science fiction day predicted future civilized intelligent. time went on, things seemed heading opposite direction. dumbing down. happen? Evolution necessarily reward intelligence. natural predators thin herd, began simply reward reproduced most, left intelligent become endangered species. Yes, though many places, including USA am, opening back :/ thing common super uncomfortable outside Florida, Arizona Texas right now. everyone congregating indoors AC.

The winter test northern states. hate people whole. Tiny groups individuals tolerable. face masks ya slobs go walmart today. 40 minutes closed. Place packed harder ever seen.

Just wait movie theaters open end july... exactly haven‚Äôt eaten restaurant/takeout since whole thing started. Maybe go back born. seriously? Im surprised this, like theres bunch people gathering together streets wait, never mind, guess im surprised.

You could test ideas seeing Minneapolis large rise cases. see happening. I'm surprised that. always nice replace assumptions facts. Biggest amount cases, deaths going down.

To starting indicate saturation. Jokes supposed funny. well realm crimes humanity GOP Trump admin. maybe 40% population cheering on. flu vaccine every year - 20% better 0% ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

Not saying flu vaccine always 20% effective every year, get point. Kindergarten laptop? even mean???

My spouse teaches kindergarten kid kindergarten past years... seeing two teacher's approach whole eLearning things depressing. can't believe little kid's teacher established class. know would go like starting eLearning Day 1 kindergarten.

It like... YouTube video letter J. Go take photos things home square. Call day History remember kindly stop testing death rate dropped people learned fight it. 

But people stupid - mask wearing, states opening way soon, people refusing quarantine exposed etc. result - people infected everything shut down. infections, hospitalizations, likely deaths. It‚Äôs absolutely insane. need full quarantine sweep tests immediately. freedom something, fuck knows. age group listening anything anyone else says critical thought process? parents like this. get it. ""boomers"" era grew in, boomers verging elderly age now? would never make vaccine level effectiveness distribute it.

But wouldn‚Äôt put past current administration rush placebo election call done Yes, even though lead world testing think need lot more. spouting unsubstantiated fearmongering, then? Yep! COVID + flu + reduce emissions &amp; traffic! :) Given minor variants see think get 21st century vaccine i.e. clear decade. I'm shocked better anti-virals now. think come soon. brings IFR allows higher infection rate. might enough get USA herd immunity ""all clear"". 19th century vaccine strategy would likely work fine think going need time till admit getting 21st century vaccine 2021.  Plus, there's new releases anyway. TENET 1st big title end July. ignore since even bad flu Funny people talked reaching peak march 20.000 people infected.

The deadly virus nearly 100 years, discovered 2019, pres know 19 name meant.

If still voting hate you. Probably selection bias birthday going suuck. i've already accepted it. buying balloons, flowers, card small cake myself. wanna go low cal, use dogs bday cake toy. Thats unfortunate possibility, though seem like doctors getting lot better treating it. imagine proud poverty lack education

\-this post brought WESTERN COASTAL ELITE GANG Man, see Black Mirror season 6 ad bus stop? ~~absolute worst~~ absolute best season yet! didn‚Äôt lot testing beginning stages? Tht, too. /r/conservative, /r/prolife, /r/tucker_carlson

Wow I'm surprised. Nvm, saw 300 million US ordered October AstraZeneca  48 people [less each, cakes remarkably cheap without compromising taste.

48 people one place damn near illegal days.. there's market.. (for now). Lol hush. You‚Äôre done feel like weeks ago post would atleast 60k. I'm math magician something's Hopefully sheriffs assigned body burning duties dead bodies start piling up. set bar fucking low law enforcement it‚Äôs overrun sociopaths low IQ imbeciles keep engaging person. worth time. Alcohol drug use/abuse lost people (not suggesting anything situation--it's place). helpful subreddits concerned. think /r/stopdrinking active. Lmao half cases WWE really. Likely bad test. Scary. family thinks BS. Still. 2 billion number total production throughout 2021, including orders UK, US, Indian manufacturer (Serum Institute).
A European alliance also secured vaccine recently.
How much produced 2020 announced yet AFAIK. True, super uncomfortable outside Florida, Arizona Texas right now. everyone congregating indoors AC.

Super nice outside northern states right now.

Wait winter, sucks outside northern states. get big audience guys bro crushes him? self defeating close beach.

It makes good Jaws memes, beaches open closed weird hill die on. Sorry kids, getting Canada. Fuck shit. weird South Dakota. I'd say 80-90% people see wearing masks; social distance, sort of.. let's say store: meat potatoes store people dont social distance, comes checkout lines everyone keeps space(even 6ft markings gone/worn away floor) 

So like dont believe it, time dont understand care follow fully. Part wonders good number people would like wear masks dont social stigma ""buying lib media hoax"" &amp; ""muh rights"" total disaster. Get ready lockdown #2 lockdown #1 half-assed Yeah feels really insane. wonder effective be. 20% effectiveness example, still make distribute all? good estimates many cases go unreported? Like bad enough I‚Äôm curious unreported cases make far worse bit worse. lot friends going bars think joke... get rigged election Donnie lost popular vote

They forgot rig election way become president America's political system rotting while. got current president, example. Thia really highlights it, though. news hospitalization rate young folks? gas station near sliding window like drive window installed boarded doors. It‚Äôs kinda great know keeps family safer. It‚Äôs little family run place. universe 1.6m deaths border ""unacceptable costs""? categorically without room debate unacceptable costs possible measures avoid minimise taken. Maybe. lot world could probably really step testing. probably need USA too. know, time make sense anymore. worries, stay ignorant. time alive. Especially rigged elections happen time world. knowledge one ever faked pandemic.. 41,000? one day? Holy fuck make masks rubber airtight well mean, school also means free daycare means one parent able work. probably bigger deal

Not advocate shit - grade school age kid throwing income blender I'll safe. EVERYONE IGNORING protesters cities?  It‚Äôs think protesters immune, course they‚Äôre not.

Many wearing masks &amp; none keeping 6 feet themselves

. said U.S. ‚Äúnot tough‚Äù contact tracing, enforcing quarantine, wearing masks compared countries Asia Europe.  behavior contact tracing working well,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúWe continue large case spread. embarrassing versus Europe countries.‚Äù  claims U.S. cases country testing, allegations testing giving false sense spread virus, Gates called ‚Äúcompletely false.‚Äù  fair say find cases testing,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúBut U.S. experiencing rebound even factor increased testing.‚Äù

No doubt USA absolute embarrassment whole shitshow, leadership bigot citizens valuing freedom wearing fucking mask. healthcare system third-world country help, either. USA screwed. forget eye protection. medical professional breathing protection , still got infected flight. believes must infected eyes regrets wearing eye protection. hugest straw man play I‚Äôve seen entire life man niceee people get it, less people get it. I'm aware, white person criticism Mexico's policies practices immediately translated racist, instead I'm required ask obvious questions hope others draw conclusions. Idaho going point out. least county, almost 25% new cases come 25-34 bracket.

Though, worry younger people getting it, might mean result spreading more? 45 deaths Arizona little 7 millions people? James Kirk: Let die september amount time away think would Resign Greg Abbott Agreed, people Florida (and states, matter) first need see things get FUBAR hospitals actually start complying begin physical distancing wear mask.

Or drastic measures taken governors, however feel like late. Speaking West Texas- best friend came back positive today. . . months, ""If could go back again, I'd let somebody else job."" add $600 per week unemployment. ending soon too

Worth noting lots states literally pay UI lots people might it. wonder wished gone Methy McHoebag... Ooo devious, like it. Beaches problem bars jam packed shoulder shoulder masks. 

The beaches probably safe long stay away people. kids birthdays? 

No one besides meme era household would together anyway still need cake lol. 

Easy solution bake one cakes gatherings Lmao stupid ya bud. Stay inside forever Removing mask second eat drink gonna make difference. considerate don‚Äôt breathe people. protesters spreading virus? people refuse wear masks, social distance what's creating surge cases, honestly need states take hard line stance start imposing 500.00 fine wearing mask unable social distance never happen. Chill bro. Read book get /r/tumblrinaction, rotting brain. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* theme song stuck head Yeah agree. admit bit mindset ‚Äúfuck that, don‚Äôt care, accept risk myself‚Äù still feel way occasionally even though know that‚Äôs wrong. Tbh think separated mask issue things social distancing, we‚Äôd much success. I‚Äôm willing wear mask social distance public, see friends hang small group people? I‚Äôve started recently. Soon mouse spread disease like bubonic plague. ""I said people, slow testing down"" told everyone opposite visions showed controlled Ancient Greece reverse psychology? university still moving ahead full plans back campus August. want practice social distancing, biggest school almost 100 miles. way keep students apart. Classes freshmen level regularly 25-30+ regular classrooms, that's say nothing lecture halls. Faculty fighting back hard, there's sinking feeling they'll close people start get sick die campus. I'm thankful every day graduated May, there's way I'd go back, even meant getting degree. 8?? barely left house 13 already ‚Äúpneumonia deaths‚Äù. believe already huge spike year. 34,203 April looks like two three times testing done, compared around April Whoever said mild case might meant mild/moderate (they often grouped together 'non-hospitalized' people). 

Once hospitalized require real hospital treatment, officially moved onto severe case category. moderate case point. terms virus categorized nyc hospitals, I'm pretty sure everywhere. Moderate cases lung scarring failed kidneys. Moderate cases would had, really awful symptoms, shortness breath etc, serious enough hospital admission. possible actually severe case, underestimated symptoms. 

A mild case means that, mild. would classified mild, would probably put classification mild/moderate registry case classifications, mild. 

The reason saying absolutely *massive* gap mild moderate. reason combined strain hospital beds. studies virus, mild cases barely even recognized symptoms. entire family got slight symptoms, known testing. Moderate cases very, obviously sick. 

Most studies show small fraction, likely less 25%, anything worse mild case. people say ""I deathly sick labeled mild!"" almost definitely actually putting mild, mild/moderate, conglomeration meaning ""not hospitalized"". ‚ÄòKaren‚Äô Turn what? - Lil Jon agree certain extent. put restrictions back place, people counties follow anyways, lead protesting. think counties able manage this, course they're failing miserably. think take control. Orange County, people would abide stay home orders wont wear mask. ridiculous. Trump people thinking wearing mask necessary following message. 

Even Newsom intervenes people listen abide rules even Sheriffs refusing cite people believe personally. Yup mask giggle step door stays get back home decontaminate. Death America ""keep america great"" one. People comment i'm like ""yeah keep great wearing mask voting November"". 


Sometimes trolling Knoxville fun. one know died drunk driving. give go ahead open wine drive home work? Even contact tracers asking patients attended protests cases would still rising regardless. also hilarious fucker think states like Texas, *still not* issued statewide mask order, adequate containment measures place. current surge happening states reopened early. last statement wrong.

You either delusional or, given tenacity thread, paid spread propaganda here. Everything saying dismissed hand. Yeah. live here. pretty much hermit mid March past Monday return office. I‚Äôm getting large grocery delivery morning hunkering best can. It‚Äôll straight work straight home. haven‚Äôt seen family since February, it‚Äôs lonely, I‚Äôd rather come side health family intact. San Diego *piece shit rate* 6%? That's pretty good going. Remember stuff going Michigan well... don‚Äôt need mask, don‚Äôt leave house. mass protests fucking morons wanting wear masks pretty predictable. forced pressure cases. truly cared would issued stay home order. numbers worse NE initial outbreak. Yes think businesses stay open. one vehemently believe something true evidence scientific backing 

it's easier. requires big changes one's lifestyle gonna happen. Hell even many colleagues work refuse wear public. even get started girls nursing homes. thought ""all lives mattered"" guys, apparently Ummm Texas. Fort Worth would say it‚Äôs closer 30% compliance, that. remember hit 200,000 total started scary. 

This utterly insane. First time I‚Äôve like... escape plan  much WINNING *Donald Trump* single day?!? anything allow local restrictions. state still allow local governments require individuals wear masks. county judge realized loophole (wherein localities could require businesses require masks establishments) large counties/cities followed suit.  New record bitches!

In seriousness. God damnit America. stop going places? many bailouts many bailouts? Insurance companies learned properties flood zones aren‚Äôt worth insuring payout 1x 2x rebuild that‚Äôs it. wish could upvote more, exactly happening right now. lack wide national testing net contact tracing made several states virus spread unchecked reopening. totally preventable actually followed data.

I guess see take now... sure, doubts that. believe word meant use ‚Äúblame‚Äù - downvote correcting spelling? tomorrow it‚Äôs gonna 10 million. That‚Äôs hundred times 100k. china. new cases schools reclosed Well said lockdown stay home order. closure bars. That‚Äôs one industry. industry coincides food assume take option. employees: unemployment. neither Florida Texas providing bailout?  evidence right front you.

What kind sick fucking monster defends people spreading coronavirus politics? bad person believe virus spread Karens MAGAs white supremacist spread BLM protesters, factually, unarguably is? need change. can't exist like this. horrible. vile, disgusting, evil.

Fucking stop it. Stop horrifically political person. Thanks. I'll check out. take leave absence, necessary. convinced money kids go back safely Oh ye forgot bout 4th July. That‚Äôll fun eh? That‚Äôs acceptable terrorists pedophiles freedom loving Muricans nothing hide... right constitution let‚Äôs forget law order.

If pandemic made one thing clear it‚Äôs people idea rights form cogent argument defend doesn‚Äôt make absolute hypocrites. Texas typically starts late august 2 months away, though think may start week early year around week August 15th like 1 month &amp; 3 weeks away even Wal-Mart run? Delivery exists. Meanwhile neighbors hosted 20+ person party house last night. I've lost hope. really care twice many Americans died virus four months 8 years Vietnam war?? twice many deaths four months first six years AIDS epidemic? concern you!? take every precaution? another lockdown inevitable? Soon? I‚Äôm asking seriousness watching numbers, listening daily updates feel unsafe. I‚Äôm always wearing face mask gloves, washing hands, 6ft+ physical distance etc. :/
I‚Äôve anxious nervous going work (I work SoCal wine country) it‚Äôs slowly turning fear. wineries (mine included) really safe following strict protocols others literally acting like virus gone. Huge crowds, physical distancing etc. suddenly employees getting positive tests, shutting day two reopening like it‚Äôs big deal. 
This havoc mental health. 

I wish someone would roll back reopening lock us something!

I‚Äôm sorry. really worried. It‚Äôs like time standing still flying time virus getting worse. ""safe vaccines""....""in trial right now"".

Does compute. sure getting 6% number from. Nationwide positive rate 7.3% today. Last time 6% Monday. intentionally spreading misinformation try pretend like bad really is? could give false hope 80% people taking it. pick least dangerous one could.

How least dangerous? order even **pretend** returnees uninfectious. send one back, get 50-incoming 10 die.

Put motels, tents, dedicated nursing home. least *pretend* care infection danger.. really fail see even superficial logic. Opening bars early isn‚Äôt sole reason are. Irresponsible behavior is. Tbh can‚Äôt even place blame solely governor. president doesn‚Äôt take virus seriously means supporters don‚Äôt either. literally one half country working other. I‚Äôm Houston going anywhere crapshoot. go grocery store today everyone wearing mask, yet go place tomorrow one. conspiracy theorists think virus isn‚Äôt real don‚Äôt give damn social distancing. guess get sick week literally nowhere go hospitals capacity ones pay price. 
What shit show. Kept told covid multiple strains reinfection happening. Even total incompetence going Florida would unlikely gets bad New York City was. Florida population density, even big cities like Miami Jacksonville, public transit major factor spread NYC basically nonexistent. saying get bad, NYC lot factors working really exist rest US. Maybe there's silver lining cloud morons die greater rate smart people. America's average intelligence might go notch three. Admin assistants get couple month... Get facts outta [The best 5 Also Texas, yeah last week August first week September schools usually start.  Internet recipes museum probably going dead grandparents actual food. definitely spread respiratory system. Stop replication lungs can't spread. I'm guessing WA well. many sheriffs recently vocal following various orders. I""m pretty sure Texas going well. Testing generally free, anecdotally know people get tested something else, due feeling symptoms. new southern strategy I'm astonished number people flatly denying science expertise.

Evolution work. last many millennia stupidest human beings died could reproduce children grown old enough fend themselves. America's response covid-19 exactly going achieve thing many die already grandchildren, still evolution works.

I find wondering significant proportion people emigrated Old World US last four centuries may mixture stubbornest least intelligent people countries left. would explain lot. think much greater damage lie give false advice (almost surely known Fauci and/or Redfield false). look confusion society masks. 180 degree turn work. Plus could ramped production much earlier public. critical -- masks reduce probability infection 5X. viruses sure can, sure coronaviruses. Even there's risk getting bird-swing-flu virus would make current pandemic feel like lazy rehearsal. like siva Ya going need source that. long term effects? looking like India completely failed containment.

Do Indians understand keeps up, they're going see something like 1 Billion infected, Millions deaths? stay inside. I‚Äôm trying dick seriously. need stay inside. soft genocide perceived old weak. sure else define purposeful incompetence point. really circle back Trump.

1. Lack masks entirely doing. imagine Trump wore MAGA mask every press conference rather nothing. political issue then. Rather, seen unamerican traitor wearing mask. Plus he'd make killing campaign. 

2. mafia style ""leadership"" encourages governors good side costs, things mitigate virus puts bad side. know hard hit states, Georgia, Texas, Florida, mayors definitely wanted stricter lockdowns hands tied emergency measures. Kemp's shelter place order particular basically impossible interpret anything forcing Atlanta et al ease lockdown.

Culture general explains South Korea, Europe enlightenment culture nearly poorly. virus death sentence * most* weaken kill thousands. line moral thinking alright say ""I'll probably fine, care others die?""

That's (a local news outlet) made distinction. Hey least many old people Quality. know girl thinks people die either way least economy restart.

She listen thinks smarter (she not) went college job, lmao. mix report China kind frustrating. said 80% cases mild, actual details report said mild moderate cases, mild.

I live hard hit part Bronx know easily 15 people either got tested got antibody test positive. think 2 people anything remotely close guy describing, older, knew one person died like 85. Regardless, almost deadass mild symptoms. Like rly cough days. wish people aware cause keep saying ohhh gonna worst flu ever, people even realize spreading get ACTUAL mild symptoms ignore it. Refuse work equals unemployment way pay bills. Unfortunately one people forced put life families life risk 40 hours week. Crazy leftist politicians around world basically stopped spread Corona. outbreak worse UK states, outbreak basically stopped.

\[ \] link contains evidence people sub anything

\[x\] everyone photo masked argument protests increase chances COVID spreading, nobody refute that. Obviously human contact spreads COVID19 non human contact.

What irritates focus protests. story protests needs over. real story people wearing masks. Japan close country. They're reliant public transit dense cities yet 19k cases. 144 cases per million residents. Hong Kong, another sense city, 1.2k cases 160 cases per million residents.

USA 2.6m 7.8k cases per million residents.

Wear mask. wearing masks killing Americans, protests. remember TPC explosion, work industry. aunt called said want leave right line mandatory evacuation.

I told leave. got shit afterwards, I'll shoulder burden family members upset me, mind right call.

Honestly think Branick decent job. He's favorite, he's really rock hard place. overarching majority county surrounding areas believe orders necessary constitutional, elected official.

I can't wait area, even means taking paycut. Noice live Florida. Gillum didn‚Äôt get anywhere near 50% primary. several viable candidates, one dropped out.

Our national bird might well ostrich point. Thank god that! People need live pretend everything OK propaganda / morale reasons. else feel way, go fun Disneyworld?!?! Aw wanted called honey Selfishness child cookie doesn‚Äôt want share it.

Toxic individualism people cling people around dying still feel self righteous ‚Äúrights‚Äù. gives crowd far much credit. It‚Äôs added benefit ignorance. San Marcos joined chat sneaky feel dude. comment light-hearted course. know much current president entered race, initial thought was, ""Great, successful businessman running country"" However, quickly realised wrong was. point wondered might actually assassinated inauguration. 

I dog fight really, ANYONE, whatever policies, MUST better. Simply behaving like president, leading, bringing people together instead causing division, tweeting like stroppy toddler 2 MUST better, surely? Man, you‚Äôre calling triggered typed whole essay this? Listen, end world? Contrary popular belief, it‚Äôs not. there‚Äôs need saying dumb stuff like that. 
And god, I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôve got plan. all, they‚Äôre like, 200 times complex me. wouldn‚Äôt able understand they‚Äôre doing.

And why‚Äôd gotta make sarcastic remarks dude who‚Äôs saying ‚Äúgod help us all‚Äù? beliefs, yours. Assholes like cause half arguments world. scale 2009 Flu Epidemic around 491,382 confirmed Cases thinks eventually infected around 11-20% world. That's like 3 days Corona. 18,449 deaths confirmed. thinks figure probs 10 50 times that. There's really three separate issues work. 


First, February/March, health officials simply wrong virus transmitting. widely thought transmitted breathing contact infected surfaces, turned wrong. understandable mistake brand-new virus trying figure real time. 


Second, health officials frequently misrepresented information confidence conclusions order try influence behaviors certain ways. bad policy long-term negative effects public confidence officials. ""Don't wear mask"" save health-care workers one example. 


Both could overcome, though, without third largest problem: actively antagonistic, anti-science movement dominates large chunks America exists countries well, trying make things worse sheer contrarianism I‚Äôm literally data scientist profession lmao

I‚Äôm thick booty though, thanks asking.  Freedumb movement time high. Compared gen z boomers millennials better Yeah, heard guy screaming rights California. Wow. That's really long term solution think know want admit it.

The ""ruling class"" real skin game. Either pay government does- guess pays government? Everyone.  USA richest country earth. 

LOL earth live on? smart stay Floriduh, shit getting real It‚Äôs already standard procedure wear masks feeling well Japan. according friend Japan also really don‚Äôt feel like makeup talking people. dont know statistics dont qualify statements words like tested confirmed since even numbers close useless. 
The real numbers order magnitude higher Meanwhile Canada we've consistently getting 2 grand month last 4 months. difference much America cares people jarring. irrelevant solution require ""expressions individuality"". requires collective community effort. Something Japan, many countries, proven US proven capable that. Buddy, wish! Hey everyone, found thing contagious! need stay away other!  Huh? I'm talking issue knowing exactly many people got covid? data collecting problem Congress investigating FDA review tests allowed distributed widely throughout U.S.

Oh. OK.

I guess important literally everything else. Pretty sure Biden together enough listen experts. He's least smart enough wear mask. clear would effective leader situation. Trump even give fuck. Evidence posted multiple times thread different sources affirming claims. yet post single contradictory source. Might want slap ‚Äúun-‚Äù ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù think said opposite intended. Pretty much exactly ShaolinShade said, plus high student loans since misfortune orphaned child scholarships sort thing school. wish kidding. comment spreads virus more. commented risk spreading virus. case, 1% risk outdoors would less risky, even people infected 99% people get sick, whereas 85% people bar get sick. take mask mid flight? Never let opportunity insert politics pandemic go waste. 

First right wing, left. Back forth. Forget science. we're joke global stage. True, again, majority expose ilk. offense taken, hate it. I‚Äôve looking new job this. part, sending people war behalf ""inconvenience"" feel. response virus actually requires people make change habits, selfishness people really shows absolute piece shit. reason don‚Äôt use chain link fence mosquito net. winter time 100 Fahrenheit hotter Spain?  Good article, thank sharing. I've asking question. strayed far away decent human beings, many people claim Christians. I'm religious two things kinda go hand hand not? Protests outdoors. Nice try. Fox News effective, they're fear mongers constantly play scares people. Migrant Caravans must goldmine ratings. this, irresponsibly ramp testing. want end lockdown effectively handle virus. Americans want lockdown continue rather reopen *known* cases even naive think vast majority people would accept told leave houses anything grocery shopping vaccine comes. Lol stupid. understand top-level comments comment direct rebuttal ignoramus. sub fix stupid bot stop stifling discourse. agree. Many anti maskers anti-vaxxers covid. lot isn‚Äôt capable assessing risk unless it‚Äôs tangible. utterly ignore well documented scientific medical histories establishing risks associated preventable disease yet firmly believe disproven myths vaccines cause harm, autism. amount third party evidence change mind. either scientific blather can‚Äôt understand simply lies told fantastically absurd agenda. Add support sociopathic president willing foment paranoia bolster fragile ego there‚Äôs zero chance swayed statistical evidence now, especially it‚Äôs presented ‚Äúliberal media.‚Äù  

It‚Äôs ... stupid. 

I think tide turn eventually, probably core number know someone serious case disease. course they‚Äôll claim skepticism well founded based past duplicity press democrats‚Äô prior efforts manipulate crises purposes, bullshit like that. naturally they‚Äôll praise Trump‚Äôs courage keeping fight face deadly illness. Fuck all. Perfect temperature fight fever in! See, environment equal healthy internal temperature human body, like, convince body go temperature.

It science, folks, fight science. /s Outdoors. NYC huge protests, cases dropping. people demanding government something support industries, say okay guess get sick/get others sick ruling class nothing. lose popular vote people supposed do? violent antisocial types time lives cops, correction officers, ICE, DEA, FBI, Federal Marshalls, bureau prison enforcement shit learned about. non-violent social types wearing mask, sueing government reopen, writing laws, general douche bags. never win they're violent we're care don't. Floriduh checking almost 10,000 new cases today, hold üç∫, think beat tomorrow. perfect world may true. However, large scale would virtually impossible. making high quality masks available everyone country would great feasible first step. There's central authority keeps tally global (or even per-country) coronavirus cases. Depending data sources, website cross 10 million number different times. thought worth clarifying title. Probably not. time many hospitalized cause taking vaccines anyone go hospital virus given something fix quick hopefully. IDK vaccines work already virus I'm guessing don't. Judges given emergency management powers theory, emergency need single leader able decisive, making decisions quickly based situation. 

Texas government set intentionally bureaucratic Civil War locals trust democratic governance would prevent former slaves able vote control. Almost everything requires vote least council meeting. Going bureaucratic process emergency would slow. Speaking someone missed protests purely personal issue, still involved communication, saw.

Most fought good safety precautions openly mentioned inherent danger protests states failed properly address outbreak. Lessons learned:

- Don‚Äôt moron
- Don‚Äôt elect morons

There, solved Coronavirus (and 90% rest problems too). outright embarrassing. comparison needed. [Texas 5k new cases past 4 days mean, basic argument hasn‚Äôt worked anti-vaxxers (‚Äúthere people can‚Äôt get vaccinated help save lives getting vaccinated‚Äù), doubt it, sadly. No, indoor vs outdoor huge thing.

NYC huge protests, cases continue decline. Get proper mask happen Yeah California forced hand discussing guidances, Disney choice matter. what, give might hard let bunch people die? Thank you! yeah. That‚Äôs bad. Well would woke second came pants. Reverse triage. old article. yesterday US 2436+ deaths Everyone spending time indoors closed windows even wearing mask. That‚Äôs huge part it. supposed feel sorry them? don‚Äôt. faster accept reality less impact. Woah, that‚Äôs .07% world‚Äôs population.

Over one million people die malaria year. Chilling huh? Thanks 'harmless' rhetoric Trump! Midwesterner here: too. then, keep border closed. It‚Äôs going complete shitshow it‚Äôs over. Conspiracy? CDC part it? Lol. They‚Äôve gone back forward masks. Maybe that‚Äôs people skeptical? n95 doesn‚Äôt micron stopping power COVID, it‚Äôs small it‚Äôs mask boxes come disclaimer protect vs COVID. shut Los Angeles. 

It fucking insane LA County breaking limit allowable infections reopening without scaled back. limits placed *by fucking governor's office*, yet standing idly letting LA County ignore guidelines remain open one worst counties country infections. 

Our rate positive infection increasing, rate hospitalization increasing, ICU capacity already floating 35%. fucking idea switch toggled Newsom's brain make go handling competently spring handling badly possible summer, are. 7,000 infections day week he's allowing counties decide reopen shit like nail salons. Bars open packed, distancing. Restaurant outdoor seating packed, often seating areas expanded pedestrian lanes causing pedestrians come within 6 feet unmasked diners. 

Get fucking shit together, Gavin. mean, fuck you

Sincerely, 
Pretty Much Everybody Midwesterner here: too. then, keep border closed. It‚Äôs going complete shitshow it‚Äôs over. Reading 8 hours later like checkin US voting results. win? depend couple hundred votes again? recounts? enough push republicans throne?

But no, Covid republicans win, again, sit side pond can't anything worry guys. 1/3 1/2 colleges fail market cycle. reality crushing administrators can‚Äôt deal it. average endowment something like 7.5M. can‚Äôt deal costs go fully online, let alone deferred lost revenues lack campus activities. Higher education crash.

I hope I‚Äôm wrong, I‚Äôve seen college budgets last 2 months, know I‚Äôm probably not. total bullshit opinion data back up, buuuuut bet we'd save even lives 33k mentioned here. 

Wear fucking mask. works. easy. I'm really conflicted that. like idea what's theory, raised like $200k (said upgrade hard drive) I've seen stories make question motives background. (Her background geography, data analysis epidemiology.)

Iran closest curves US, interesting compare dates expect things lowest new cases 2nd spike came May 2. Deaths stopped falling May 17 pretty flat May 31st rise started again.

The US bottomed June 9. continues similar Iran, expect flat deaths June 24‚ÄîJuly 8 accelerating increase. southern states opening restrictions? I'm texas phased reopening restrictions. Also think bit premature assume protests wont affect virus spread. Surely people got infected. agree mod one. like Daniel Andrews - incompetent! I'm Virginia spent eight hours work restaurant watching bosses let servers walk around noses masks.

:( asshole spreaders!  Canadian I'm thrilled travel Europe without deal loud, entitled Americans every airport. Also, politely respond ""Sorry, I'm actually Canadian"".

As individuals, American folks generally lovely, group they're absolute worst travelers I've ever encountered. Sorry. repost real title. Remindme! Two hours You‚Äôre right. didn‚Äôt even mention fact businesses won‚Äôt function people stop coming work. Good call. know right?

Their care teams recommend moved. mean, probably OK covid stable otherwise moved. We'd probably waited weekend. feel like way around. r/nyc well truly brigaded point. aren‚Äôt testing numbers irrelevant Dammit.  Somebody crapped sewage bucket. heart right place downvote you, vaccine work good elderly young. vaccines past, present, future. Vaccines work stimulating immune system. older are, less immune system reacts. thinks Rocky movie comment says lot you. Wow downvoted asking see evidence! wow! lot dumb people perceived freedoms makes act even dumber. going Florida ever fun, tbh Absolutely nothing man ever satisfy you. Admit it. could done everything 100% right books get go, would sitting posting mad actions. ""well COULD banned travel abroad anyone knew virus!"" friends won‚Äôt wear like flu.

I another friend said would get Trump 2020 masks ‚Äúsuddenly‚Äù would go away since it‚Äôs Dem ploy. holy shit dont better start mansplaining, son. cite Alexis De Tocqueville I'm scientist doctor anything like that

I'm 100% certain considers witch doctors faith healers part group. like less choice. Love story man, I'm glad completely covered (I mean COBRA would covered fuck going pocket felt good stick man.

Absolutely dude. little feels better fucking people fucking over, even balance fucked haha.

I left first finance job (at giant investment bank; left smaller, elite boutique IB firm) lied joined (promised one practice, put another). knew 3 weeks advance quitting, 5 day training 300 people IB class (who trained London) Connecticut, time period took every single project had, literally every single thing. even took regulatory stuff done, law, required lot runway get done (""Know Client"" shit) onboarding client.

I none work 2 weeks leading Connecticut. made excuses, kicked road. Got Connecticut, shit started hit fan work voluntarily taken on, stopped answering calls. Got back Friday Connecticut, ignored emails phone calls weekend, showed 8AM staffer got quit spot. Told new job leaving, walked out.

My buddies still team would send text updates fucking disaster left wake (they loved even though impacted - everyone likes stick man even vicariously). super satisfying hear headaches causing.

Glad could reminisce fucking shitty firm haha.  Estimated 0.006% death rate far.. maths customers die - threat sick work weeks even months, worse yet, threat six seven figure medical bills plenty people thinking twice spending money to. Yeah people functional brains, would agree. unfortunately brains powered $$$ means collecting unemployment prove actively looking work elsewhere. goes countries too. highly successful ones East/Southeast Asia high rates mask wearing 

edit - plus robust contract-tracing programs, another important factor deeply lack US Oh yeah gotta pump stock get bonus fuck everyone else NJ still getting pounded.

Their deaths per 1m gone 150 per 1m last two weeks. Fla much whole pandemic one talking New Jersey Name them. dont really care many cases country has, could cherry pick stats too. 5k deaths country apparently done everything wrong let virus thrive says lot me, peaked. 

Stop pretending give shit people. Yes sad 75 year old dies young person die. would agreed pre-corona gone full blown hysteria now. watched today. Pence dumbass. defended recent rally wouldn‚Äôt even say word mask. Instead recommending masks said people local government says. Pathetic. mean hard look airlines right now. I'm sure could call customer service ask. Alaska airlines HEPA filters aircraft disinfect using hospital grade disinfectant. also sell middle seats. say website pre flight briefing passengers. also hand masks board.

If flying right (which times) whole new experience yeah ask filters they'll know Couldn‚Äôt agree more. best reason good credit card handy. take billionaire genius tell think lot pent frustration idiots refusing wear masks point.

If/when deaths shoot follows case rate see getting real ugly people. They‚Äôve gone back haunting posts people dying say stuff like ‚ÄúSee sure died _from_ Covid _with_ Covid? Cause death might totally unrelated‚Äù ‚ÄúI wonder preexisting conditions had.‚Äù stupid use search engine? Wow, shocking. Better late never bit worried logic people follow basic steps eliminate virus. really selfish people care person standing next them.   lmao. would except can't unsee tentacles. maybe blood clots
Maybe renal damage
Maybe testicular damage
Maybe COVID type dementia minor strokes
Maybe little lung damge
or retinal damage.

Just cold, tho Currently 47,093. OMG. pray catch it. someone nuke us, already? I'm embarrassed death daily. it‚Äôs posted every positive covid case world seen since January actually think, visionary see as, first one break news Reddit? parents hilariously viewed secret weapon sense. held tongues certain things relatives, brash kid would always voice opinion. parents actually thanked speaking one time different kid says since still maintain cordial relations. Haha. Short-grain rice still sparse Los Angeles-area grocery stores since tend stock much normally. Asian grocery stores seem lot stock. I'm still finding pasta shelves completely empty (except couple boxes whole-wheat pasta‚ÄîNO ONE like stuff!). Im cautiously optimistic.  Coronavirus stay like not. going like anything else population get go on. going bad first it'll slack more, eventually it'll like flu cold. Tom nook annoys fuck me. gonna lie, teared bit saw today's numbers. following US news week getting really nervous. I'm still bit apprehensive see re-opening bring, fall bring. we're fairly smart re-opening strict social distancing measures place business (not stupid shit like re-opening inside bars/restaurants movie theaters), we're ramping testing (0.37% positivity rate!!), we've got pretty good contact tracing place. Yep great economic crash, Covid turned big deal compared boring ordinary economic carnage fuels chaos. many polls need order understand US reopening quickly. swear 10th +poll said thing... MLB season. exactly I've saying. reason people think bad high percentage could it.. actually good reflect higher amount current death rate. 

20 million cases 174k deaths 0.0063% death rate.  insanely low.  People obviously can't math ya know?  think Texas sort super power would protected ?

Yes stop bs'ing admit knew hell wanted people back work asap. He's dumb play dumb either. 47k  Northeast small uptick fell right line projected number upticks came yellow phase opening. another small uptick considering delaying green phase result. paying attention numbers scientists responding accordingly. Masks mandated well social distancing sooo no, I‚Äôm seeing failings speak off. Midwest trending upward along openings still nothing catastrophic besides Arizona California. Michigan looking good #biggretchenergy Feels like OP bit touch lol  generally agree this. 

only sticking point innovation. truth start boxing innovation ‚Äúshould‚Äù come based historic events miss innovative opportunities going forward. 

Flipping this, don‚Äôt see publicly owned companies cannot innovative. see airline industry ripe opportunity innovate. someone could please draw mask LITERALLY killing people. Surely small business owners realize they‚Äôre fix either way? customers die go business. pandemic forces shut potentially go business. fed asleep goddam wheel many us fighting amongst wearing masks. countries, please block Americans traveling country. Sincerely, concerned American. I've take break drinking heavily since March. 

I laid like day meh. kidding ? LA reason California spiking. guys ignorant anti maskers. bay area actually practicing social distancing wearing masks everywhere. Next time MIL needs haircut tell get one plumber trained hairstylists can't trusted. toilet backs up, tell hire barber fix it. Inflammatory shitposts posing stupid person plausible deniability Finding hospitilisation data Florida isnt straight forward. Right know cities near maxed icu capacity Wonder mass protests anything spike?? get victim mentality nothing ever better always one else's fault. fucking hard, cried sleep many nights bc missed milestones body hurt bad move it. Again, expecting others risk lives bc can't figure acceptable, part reason many teachers leaving teaching. Oh yeah? What‚Äôs case fatality rate Spanish Flu? Nope internet warriors desperate vilify group consider different

Ah yes, makes sense. poor people refuse wear masks take pandemic seriously. They‚Äôre real victims. thing works people DEMONETIZATION, Demonization. get change. Nope equally

Somebody understand concept Mensa

You misspelled ""remedial education."" common mistake think claiming Mensa somehow makes seem intelligent. Yeah good luck that, Mr.Fauci. well know orange asshat White House never allow that. Literally one. Maybe he's thinking therapeutic, earliest remember seeing non-vaccine intervention late August.  keep assuming I'm pleased US's response... I'm saying pandemic benefits Chinese most. US one tumbling twice far analogy tumbling hard precisely inept leadership. NH reopened hope fuck us

I'm Massachusetts border tons mass people ""trying get away virus"" coming restaurants bars like 16 cases county single death.

So far, I'm okay. usually people perpetuating lie also believe mask impede virus.

To them, CO2 (three molecules) big pass, virus (hundreds molecules) pass through.

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è scientists expect second wave. can't figure context paragraph own, fear ability care without gov assistance enforce laws defund law enforcement???? american friends, say love americans. kind people. seeing news like daily basis, I'm sure americans nothing else barbaric, self-centered people. sad see sh\*t feed everyday, especially deaths easily preventable.

The whole country freakshow. kinda sounds like someone hates sports, quarantine others not. 

Do also call everyone plays sports ‚Äújocks?‚Äù Video help Daniel Shaver sadly I'm sure. BuzzFeed, first said, available data may capture true number infected protesters, large crowds present significant risks viral spread, BuzzFeed noted. think Iran US level treatment care/access medicine face spikes? stupid look country two countries make half number cases world per day. Absolutely insane fuck people forget ""flatten curve"" actually meant? So, virus goes exponentially exponential? That's kinda point, issa meme

It's like rip peace, smh head. there's video evidence time around. dude gonna burn, Eeeh, say lots groups. would say Europe, Brits worst reputation. South East Asia, Australians. general actually find American tourists quite alright. Maybe bit ignorant, intentionally rude way. like ""is safe drink water France"" type way. 

I've visited 50 countries, lived 3, backpacked total years quite comfortably say absolute worst scum ever met happened Canadian. Two pricks upon losing beer pong unlocked super racism mode. $2000 per month Australia too. mean get political, officially want leave country.
Our president done damn thing, though problem....

FOR WORLD someone 32 years old paying $14,000 property taxes New York....I'd gladly pay live Florida. LOL Ontario. worst day 600 new cases. we're 150 cases day less 10 deaths day.

And started stage 2 weeks ago. Bars still closed restaurants serve patios.

Doug Ford usually shit. everyone agrees he's point this. He's taken seriously listened experts every step way. approval rating went 29% 76%. *in Elaine Benes' voice, singing cake itself* ""Get well, get well soon; wish get well!"" üé∂ üéÇ think majority people know someone know someone lost loved one person's life completely damaged hurt covid. harder deny hard CT got hit. people NYC trying escape well help. deaths flat since June 9th... flat deaths June 9th 8th Iran May 17th 31st? nah testing much /s  Brazil isn‚Äôt really surprising numbers US certainly is. I‚Äôm American kinda stopped checking US numbers regularly shocked new cases. remember US around 20k per day. Wtf happened?? don‚Äôt think country seen new spike cases like this. It‚Äôs massive increase. Freedom behave like idiots overrated think. geez. closing late opening early. Can‚Äôt put cotton pads straps don‚Äôt dig skin much. think end making less year get 2020 taxes. helps though. People either laugh, cry, shake heads say *Damn. hell thinking??* Gotta go high get max use parachute! hand protests going massive scale, important thousands lives it? mean there's thing rational middle pandemic protest. That's bad nevertheless. give details people demographics amongst things. Maybe not. 

Thesituation likely control simple reason cannot hide deaths. Sion Hospital incident politicised brought level sanity people pathetic situation Mumbai Delhi. absolutely reports UP, likely control. 

No state transparent this. MH says high testing capacity test indiscriminately positive rates near 30 percent. e.g. Mumbai, test 5k people consistently, pathetic. Even transparent ones, Karnataka TN, seem provide us details properly. still find stunning apparently never rule remain vicinity home. Like Ireland. Went Trump school hindsight Connecticut confirming. 95% people wearing masks. Major head turning people not. 1-2 people willfully complying might see grocery store. keep extra distance away people still dumb shit. Lots noses poking masks dumb. got many fatalities? could agree more. U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!

No one beat us, we're number 1 baby!!!

*Terrified crying inside* Lol. NJ added almost 2k deaths back log probable deaths tested. We're actually 15 days 1k also 8 weeks long summer break, know happen schools Europe late August/September. Everybody knows political violent act sale hope oh I‚Äôve always stays well critical thinker. Take care UK paid 90% salary 3000 dollars month. 80% limit ending fairly soon really important level support. Yep. Opening week two too. Damn it, wanted see Tenet theater, too. guess I‚Äôll waiting shows Redbox. kind symptoms experiencing mind asking? Depends are. Could fooled Long Island...the market absolutely insane right now. People entering contract listings even hit internet. dont need leader tell stay fuck home. apparently half country does. That‚Äôs almost 50,000 people potentially infected hundreds thousands more. Buckle America. 

Sad. :( California fucking up. Massive protests, refusal wear masks, opening non-essential shops etc. Many people talking asbestos, asbestos folks. Many people, looked injecting it? say can, say...I feel, good feeling it, folks. Beautiful asbestos. Oh, far Karen involved stated, too.

My patient satisfaction comments past 3 weeks hilariously Karen. I've bounced around dozen different countries. Literally, every one better experience America. Throw dart world map (exception Middle East). guess I'm saying terms minimizing overhead costs, see bad idea branch government cover things. processes underfunded underprepared, that's responsibility given department education. 

Why add funding develop dep. education robust system? can't responsible? Boris Johnson: Hold tea Could fooled Long Island...the market absolutely insane right now. People entering contract listings even hit internet. Maybe remind people it‚Äôs called COVID-19 COVID-20. Thanks info! know next 2/3 weeks going crucial see goes. Fingers crossed.

I ‚Äúattitude‚Äù people complete dickheads make assumptions based tired old stereotypes.

Have nice day! We're mostly conservative. went red election since like.. Regan shit. 
The DNC lost shit WI always bent knee them, key Orangeman winning, suddenly give shit us (Hillary NEVER stopped here), suddenly they're like HEY WI WE'RE GONNA DNC CONVENTION STATE GREAT LOVE US MUCH?  
Seriously fuck DNC.  mandated masks part phase one, wouldn‚Äôt position would going phase 3 issues safe stupid?

Like protesting/rioting pandemic? money...that‚Äôs exactly run it. You‚Äôre kidding think bubble Orlando Florida, places, smart thing NBA doing. 

I agree bubbles good thing expect sports year, Jesus...not Florida. NHL Canadien cities, looks like choose Vegas one bubbles though I‚Äôve lost lot hope either league resuming late July proven happen less unarmed white people getting shot cops. that's none business Happy cake day!!! üç∞ did. literally said like March cities set rules. Austin‚Äôs mayor immediately shut city, part, followed closely Houston San Antonio. many people complained couldn‚Äôt go (see old, white people protests April) got major support across country Ted Cruz (who broke quarantine get fucking haircut) forced cities stop enforcing safety rules place. literally told cities themselves, turned around said weren‚Äôt allowed to. I'm nurse pandemic taught we're expendable employers, regardless career work. hope son make okay. That's thinking lol shit hit fan Shouldn‚Äôt Disney decide one. right thing close it. Unless name Dwayne Johnson, get sunglasses? anti mask people countries?

I cannot imagine old Korean woman says masks part deep state conspiracy. That‚Äôs calculate death rate... hell would base entire population? Interesting - wonder anybody good. [They definitely remove everything website initially wouldn't/still responding anybody, even news Wow! sick ""winning"" yet? I'm sure would never compromise safety testing ensure Trump good election campaign, even though previous record vaccine development around four years consequences failed vaccine would arise Trump safely reelected give shit. Nope, never. guess depends states well. better mask wearing social distancing? gotten lucky far likely eventually blow like many states doing? We're fucked. got actually surprisingly decent job keeping every major city becoming massive hotspot; half us patted back making summer without plague-level death rates exploding every community half disgusted would ever risked economy livelihoods something *OBVIOUSLY* dangerous *they* said would be, groups getting complacent. First got (unknown sometimes unexpected) natural hotspots, getting young people, next take far, far anyone ever consciously willing give. Yup. cities coming right saying going enforce order: Surfaces low risk ""There clear cases COVID-19 fomite transmission found literature.

Really, nothing changed last week. 
 
Except state record new cases day, changed nearly every single day last week. tool. Good quote many symptoms? ICU beds! last weeks New Jersey spiked 1,400 deaths per 1m almost 1,700 deaths per 1m

An increase almost 300 dead per 1m

No one talking them, Al focus Florida lost half amount entire pandemic (157 per 1m) Texas (80 per 1m)

Also California Florida numbers similar across board yet focus FL Well go trump get fired.so guess listen trump.to preach inject disinfectant put uv light butt.but apparently joke all. would negotiating power part entail scrapping entirely? mandate negotiating? fact shows interested solving problem much scrapping extension govt involvement healthcare. never grateful work biomedical research institution. least know employer looking safety providing scientifically accurate information virus, federal government not. not? get ticket jaywalking, sure hell get ticket moving car street sweeping...but endangering others admits global pandemic, think ticket goes far? also need ten times amount testing according Sanjay Gupta. not? 52.0 minute delay fetching comments.

That's interesting, perhaps tell there's different factions CCP then? EXACTLY! far large gatherings go, one ok definitely cause spike cases.

Keep moving goalposts changing subjects. working real well I'll tell hwuat hard time believing Fauci influence big Rump way aside ""he said X! So...

One way, back mid April US actually far cases known (this always true, may larger gap April). treatment evolved less people dying due better care. deaths caught spike yet. probably combination 3. Throw county lock weekend. 90% population would freaking hours, let alone days.

Longest ever got stuck jail 21 days county jail, prison. Fuck ever again. Right Arizona. Ugh. Based GA‚Äôs ramp might able beat Florida Americans going suck quit dumb. need strict lockdown least Month. Nothing open. restaurants,no fast food restaurants nothing anywhere.

There‚Äôs also issue getting vaccines country, including remote places. Another concerning issue growing population anti-vaxxers reject vaccination well fight (think protests, petitions, Facebook science going brazy). 

I also worry population folks anti-mask + anti-lockdown also reject getting vaccine, increasing risk immunocompromised + unable vaccinated (their exact fears flu season comes + citizens reject seasonal flu shot) contract COVID-19. yeah, may actually see eradication virus years doesn‚Äôt die due reasons above. They'll probably blame protests. say oh well fine then. He's real. he? Well depends ask... competent American New York it‚Äôs local governments behest idiot president

Also Texas lot funding tied attendance governor state education agency mandated we'll back person fall. we're tasked either online keep community safe lose much funding function go person, get lot people sick killed, horrible attendance...and also still lose lot funding maybe much.

We. Are. Fucked. Seriously See original post.

So yeah, Florida's covid-19 data getting manipulated make look bad. putting people's lives families risk. raw negligence wrt public health reckless endangerment? smh.

Edit; factual correction Holy smokes, may craziest two minute attack *Facebook-brain* fever-ranting I've ever seen. 

Wear masks people, freedumb spreads COVID realise - studies correct, many - sitter likely pass Covid kid kids would he/ childcare setting kids? - currently working, also likely source transmission?

Really wrap head around that. disclosing data openly. 

So ready believe numbers government reports? lack detailed details problem? Tamil Nadu also caught recently revealing deaths timely manner. numbers too. Like maybe 500 600. every state limitations reporting testing like 1200 people per million. There's lot translucency case.

Tests per million make sense state. Even TN, hotspot Chennai hardly 10k tests 30k odd do. 

Tests per million also assumes uniform spread (Because divide entire population). long testing done good places known hotspots, good enough. 

See, TN reporting around 1500 2k cases Chennai implying high Positive percentage. see thing UP. 

You also seem discounting important factor works favour UP, Kerala, Rajasthan, Chattisgarh, etc. major metropolitan hub helps spread corona faster. Noida, Ghaziabad, Lucknow, Kanpur Delhi Mumbai Chennai.

All all, see lack trust anything government reporting, anything else.  Arrowhead KCMO guess settles that. Although KCK right across river much smaller city. needs health poster gets shared Facebook. hope US-citizens listen thes wise words Mr. Gates.

Medicare requires copious amounts strict documentation they'll pay again, trying convince **government agency** REALLY want pay you, pay you. need prove test x instead cheaper test y, chose medication instead medication b that's $3 cheaper....and on. 
So yeah, better two positive Covid-19 tests (and document performed tests begin with) bill code. grudgingly pay extra Covid-19 treatment genuinely costs more, need hospitals treat patients.  

Another issue ""but get paid Covid"" rumor describes Medicare fraud. guilty, pay patient, they'll yank Medicare reimbursements entire hospital period time (eg five years) bankrupt hospital/laboratory/physician group own. hospital/doctor would also charged criminally fraud ordered pay fines tens millions dollars (and depending level fraud, billions). take risk ""extra"" $13,000 absurd. barely covers costs. 
 
AND one going help ""cover up"" fraud order encourage whistleblowers, False Claims Act makes anyone successfully reports Medicare fraud actually gets keep 25% tens millions talked earlier. kind rampant Medicare fraud taking place, every doctor, nurse, custodian, receptionist, security guard, coder, biller, deliveryman, etc would crawling first one turn hospital since would equivalent winning lottery. still testing rigorously, released likely safe. Polio shot different story different era. Bad things still happen bad luck, one compare risks end. mask, right-wing propaganda machine keeps people angry time, whether Obama's Dijon mystical Caravan immigrants coming south rape daughter, librul elites Imposing masks ""to take freedoms"". fuck even sciences we‚Äôre going put findings highest priority consideration?

Reeeeeee something could kill person, might possibly kill harm person, discriminatory mention, would problem understanding people moral qualms following orders.

But honestly see wearing face mask could those. Uncomfortable, yes. Violating rights? see how, I'm law expert. seems like stubbornness unwillingness following guidelines reduce risk spreading disease might kill infected person, high risk killing severely damaging lungs slightly elderly people (like parents grandparents) people certain known unknown pre-existing conditions.

And following guidelines blatantly ignoring them, keep spreading virus prolong need lockdowns quarantines travel bans countries whatnot.

Sitting inside day isolation also unhealthy.

And want stay home that's great nobody forcing sit beside me. always stay inside scared wear mask helps feel safe. might even inclined wear one honestly feel safer politely ask.

I mean sensible corona policy like. making bigger threat something really is.

Before get downvoted oblivion, dont like know state Dr. Fauci lying American public weeks end, telling masks anything? minute huge crowds people started gathering streets political protests cum violent riots, normal everyday people decided what's good goose good gander gave faith may government/public health pleas stay home.

Sorry guys can't top doctors going news saying perfectly fine gather large groups long right political side. want maintain credibility. flipping protests .   need take drastic measures stop getting worse:
-Back lockdowns
-Mandatory masks public, punishable harshly DUI non-compliance, easy loopholes exemptions
-Another couple rounds stimulus checks. USA going win! going tired winning. Yes Even true, doubt. There's still 7 grades filled classrooms kids 10 Tomorrow Saturday unlikely record.

Actually death rate going around world doctors knowledgeable disease see death rate higest beginning first wave know we're dealing with. despite daily new cases doubling per day, deaths per day lower. so? like 4500 deaths day, makes 0.8 million deaths half year. Considering already close 0.5 million deaths, one million deaths 2021 seem far-fetched. Even 1.5 million deaths 2021 seems quite possible. I‚Äôd like see interestingly cdc staying potential 10x cases diagnosed Texas GOP cant afford piss people off, act like COVID big deal.

It's confounding think hill choose literally die upon. governors open early realise path quicker reopening could massive testings. 50% Florida infected hospitals overwhelmed, vindicated.

There‚Äôs 500k death right little less, we‚Äôll say 500k end June aka halfway year.

Let‚Äôs little optimistic sub  virus obviously fine transmitting Floridians right now. However, study show inactivated sunlight.   southern states big anti lockdown protests long small anti racism protests... Maybe that's cause ills right now, spikes coming later? everyone surprised (and getting hysteric) about? knew society opened infections would increase. Add nationwide protests seeing easily predicted. 

The median age infections way approximately 65 30. Also, know covid much lower IFR first thought. 

I live California. Nearly everyone see I‚Äôm wearing mask. Yet, increases infection. tomorrow... America's defining cultural trait point time: Infantilism. country constant state tantrum. seriously, it‚Äôs funny fucking morons saying April haven‚Äôt brought lately. fucking long shot too, holy hell. Remember worried 30k cases day? recent Florida town hall mask use hilarious watch. welcome!

yes, data thats pointing virus spreading increase percentage daily positive cases daily tests preformed, neccessarily amount tests preformed. I'm going Google that. probably would better food handlers, especially folks wear masks nose even mouth Covid morons won‚Äôt get till get covid. face, act like didn‚Äôt say things, learn nothing, something like happens again. 

I don‚Äôt wish die, sure hell won‚Äôt sad. problem probably take bunch others them. current trajectory US, Brazil India exponential growth curves. Doubling 1 Million Deaths very, possible.  child/your spouse anything like mother?

Heaven help kids are.... virus hitting everyone equally circumstances. would imagine also lot low income families parents work part time. Makes lot easier kids home. Yes. can‚Äôt really run multiple tests one sample. It‚Äôs going contaminated. false positive first place, second test may better anyway. mean, least admitted it?

Take one day time, month time. fuck wrong people? long self isolate 14 days upon entry! EDC still taking payments hopefully going lot less shady (too big fest Pasquale cool guy) offer refunds free transfer next year I'm wrong. thing ploitically motivated. actually likely already higher due countless misreported cases (pneumonia, etc.) nobody even aware virus

I'm sure really becomes real lot people see lives. date Utah 166 people die virus...106 1 county (Salt Lake). 26% age 85. still know single person tested positive (I know several tested). know connection died. I'm saying people cautious...I try stay wear mask occasional times go state affected like places country world. Exactly right, here's innovative proposal: So, know airplanes get overbooked, they'll ask volunteers bumped? hospital that? Ask volunteers bumped...off. Innovation! Worldstar! However, scientists cautioned over-interpreting results, appeared one-off, could linked contamination samples.

It's single day isolation 2019. Seems likely kind weird anomaly. we‚Äôre nice immigrants can‚Äôt see Canada wouldn‚Äôt freely accept us cultured Americans.

Never heard country. people vaccines claim cause health problems, never heard ""mind control"" stuff. thing tho comments manually removed actual mods usually see original comment/thread was. 

automod usually removes way fast pushshift archive it, cant even see someone tryna say

i dont really agree either considering linked sub :/ many people looking us binoculars overseas? There‚Äôs another science called ‚Äúeconomics‚Äù verified unemployment also causes deaths (40,000 deaths per 1%).

Dept Labor still predicting 25% end year, that‚Äôs estimated 

1,000,000 deaths caused joblessness. There's much younger skew catching virus now. yes, fewer deaths, eventually come contact older population.

I doubt age population getting virus skewing direction, testing probably improved point many people either less symptomatic asymptomatic starting get tested.  Maybe 30% people waring masks Columbus, Ohio. really hope polls upcoming election accurate. Must wear mask üò∑ entering restaurant seated it‚Äôs good take off. Makes sense...... y'all panic buying toilet paper, locking five plugs. Priorities. also helps people follow advice first place (e.g. South Korea/Japan) like 3rd 4th senior citizen 90 yrs old conquered virus. Tough people. get bullied coming in. high risk. asinine expect come now. Yes, sucks source income. No, know needs specifically, bluntly, stay home.

I would send letter boss CC whoever HR (if applicable). professional, stand ground. Refer guidelines say due medical condition (or however want rephrase it), returning site. 

Don't ask. Tell working home.

It sound like care terribly health. put neck line someone else make money. They‚Äôd rather force people back work state pay unemployment monthly stipend stay home. America refuses help citizens still push ‚ÄúUnited‚Äù propaganda. talking leaders BLM? Valuing equality nobody afford it. What? bleeding since throat slit?

Can interest band-aid? problem calculation parents know risk, cannot quantify benefits. There's possible way human brains make calculation accurately. So, what's leading to? Obviously president dumbshit incompetent old asshole idea run country. large part country stupid. So, cases going continue. 

So, what's next? heading another lockdown? administration focusing next election states reopening along rallies ongoing, already huge shitshow fraction population truly concerned virus. Climactic agricultural failure possible US might think. Groundwater reserves falling steadily across southern states rivers don‚Äôt reach sea more. Dust Bowl still living memory: parts US go valuable cropland desert rapidly. What? disagree broader point, ""People per capita"" literally means ""people per head"". number always going really, really close 1.

What talking ""people per square mile"" &lt;insert unit point soon entities individual liability morbidity &amp; mortality cause. Attractive nuisance. Avoid people Europe, US Brazil especially; wear mask, make 2022. idiots dead then. Imagine knew way minimise it... yet DEATHS trending downward. obsession media cases trending mortality? Perhaps goes biased narrative üßê parents making go, said they'd pull cases started popping up, gotta hope I'm one themüôÉ certainly hope right, deaths lag cases two weeks. literally article find death rate... India. plugged many different things Google. gotta cope somehow especially fucked kindergarten kids age develop fundamental social skills going school. find data yearly avg deaths things like pneumonia? tried looking find that. Googlefu weak apparently. get is, people OK killing someone else. Mistake, accident not, possibly can't justify that. I‚Äôm sure get answer here, recently got tested since opened testing asymptomatic people employer suggested get done. work Pennsylvania able get tested there, live Maryland. anyone know results would count towards Maryland‚Äôs count PA‚Äôs? I‚Äôm blast reporting political posts (rule: ‚Äúavoid politics‚Äù). Especially since people constantly report posts. could say ""hey everyone, need conserve N95 masks healthcare workers homemade masks, done right, effective virtually situations. Coronavirus large carried droplets blocked homemade masks. need t-shirt rubber-bands, supplies plenty Americans already shortages."" 

Its crazy people still carrying water guy insane me. probably single damaging entity reaction mile. Every mistake made federal government would cut 1/10th size mass mask use completely shutting spread. Right, think he's asking anybody knows specific treatments are. Thank USA making us (UK) look less bad Science twisted conspiracy elite. Science is, definition, 'trying stuff seeing happens'! US Brazil account pretty much half global total, despite 6% global population combined. Tells everything need know Donald Jair. full-blown exponential growth. means hit vastly higher numbers. Add digit. 

Even complete full lockdown right stop growth three weeks. ample evidence countries. !remindme 20 years good deaths drop still extremely unfortunate hundreds die everyday virus. Someone mentioned Brazil? cuz fighting US nr 1 spot perchance mention cuz they're far worse situation US? 45% positive test rate? New Zealand, never case town probably zero whole country. disbelief there's still pandemic going everywhere else.

All literally nothing month. spend month watching TV everything's fine. Looks like 33,000 people gonna die Original post misleading Floridian, take lead, nation's best!

/s Well. practical it: keep 1,5m use masks possible. flatten curve substantially. Panthers that... Funny thing is,thousands people attend protests,and extremly high possibility spreading covid,but cover trump rally ?? people selfishly consider risk making decision, comment makes sense.

However, people may pre-existing conditions high risk age group death. Personally would prefer inconvenience loss income cause harm someone else. maybe that's upbringing, small sacrifice common good. want brought think making decisions. Easy POTUS solution: need test less! think still look worse already does?

*Stop rooting look even worse* /s majority North South Anerica many %? Everyday new record. logic, failing then. ICUs select states near max capacity due Covid alone.

There room patients underlying problems. October fest celebrated home sure though imagine lot going wild disregarding quarantine protective measures it. Dine-in dead concept, pandemic over. Protesters don‚Äôt spread coronavirus. It‚Äôs okay. hospitilisations reducing ifr? Okay sure bud. won‚Äôt wonder. They‚Äôll blame Democratic Party perfect everyone else wrong. Australia come 2 months home schooling, children (kindergarten, year 2 year 4) home wife. bit hard manageable well set public school system. Sites used lot bug club reading cool maths games maths. Good luck. brainpower takes think grownups accept meaningful difference. Ancient US thing probably get covid deniers become serious handling pandemic war, invisible enemy threatening US citizens requires everyone cooperate fight enemy. guns, weapons war masks, social distancing hand sanitizers. natural selection end product deliberately undereducated population. How? IFR 0.4 1.4% countries. high 30 - 45? country IFR 30 - 45 group less 0.1%. . worried, mind clearly worth controlling. know feelin‚Äô Ah, that's true. thought that.

But wife stayed least 6 feet apart baby, right? MAGA Fake News........j/k stay safe afraid go. believed stories mosquitoes carrying away small children, smarter friends told (was?) beautiful. words, wrong. people old. Real Americans never die. China. First still havent answered initial question defining ""hospital runs"" keep using.

Second talk IFR without talking absolute numbers. matter IFR 0.1 10x infectious. IFR depends context, context R0, number Pts infected, number hospital beds support them. IFR 0.01 10 hospital beds 200k infected still screwed. 3 comments ago asked define hospital run, important conversation here. would define hospital reaching 100% surge capacity, specifically happened yet happened ICU patients.

Then go back point last comment still answered. Ill simplify it, actual mechanism behind saying Sweden perfectly? saying lockdowns impact rate infection? exactly swedish strategy better ours. 

Because first posts sounds like talking swedes lower rate infection pretty preposterous statement feel I've covered last comments. 

Also come ventilator thing basic survivorship bias. Yes first quick intubate patients would fine alternatives. recommended us hospitals China Italy first experimented treatments. However generally corrected attempt correlate ventilators mortality missing fact need ventilator last step death. die quicker frequently worst patients deteriorated rapidly. According Pence Luckily cases people 35. So, nothing worry apparently. Try avoid deface names political ideologies.

Auto-Mod dumb one without agenda easily evaded.

I cannot fathom 41 thousand. actual fuck going US?  fellow Floridians;

At point thing protect yourself. Wear mask. Minimize contact others. Wash hands. Stay safe.

As anyone else that? Protect protect them. Australia here. shut schools weeks here, kids daycare never shut locked anyways. School shutdown differentiator.

Wave 2 baby FYI Brazil testing low. overall total test positive rate close 40%, meaning almost half people tested Brazil positive. testing nearly enough. sure actual numbers Brazil lot higher. SOMETHING, Liberty, pursuit happiness. 

I cant remember first one. State owned media China control news. Dont deny propaganda.

Let‚Äôs start obvious propaganda country free press. forgotten journalists imprisoned speaking truth? Maybe read them. One days ago. could say there's high demand. little troll lol. Byyyeeeee  sure, contributing factor.

But I'm gonna go limb assume that, factoring majority wearing masks, come close ad infinitum small church, bbq, bars ""fuck wear mask rally"" type gatherings cover large number unseen people, wearing masks, actively trying fuck control measures. numbers those, south, Florida etc would staggering compared protests. yep get one? important ppl know. positive news lol? Go away. Europe seeing massive increase new cases too, country's daily number went back numbers 'height' pandemic. Yes. anybody proper brain that. GIS analyst, I. scientist.

Hello, went school marine biology took GIS upper major elective also attended USC LA Geospatial Summit beginning year. impression guys would considered scientists, guess know exact qualifications particular job.  mind going mean specifically? distinction interesting. true didnt display temperature yet symptomatic oxygen machines less ventilations Sure, Trump come nowhere, end product cultural divide always present, exaggerated since Reagan almost insane levels us them, driven anger alienation hollowed middle working class losing cultural dominance. Please tell you‚Äôre voting again.  Please tell clearly see negligence handling pandemic cost 10‚Äôs thousands American lives alone reason enough vote again.. Yeah irony approach destroying economy degrees, creating spasmodic decline.

If that's approach, level people get recovery. I‚Äôd still take living US. doctors financially, hospitals. lost ton money lockdown. needs transparency. far looks like coronavirus maxing FL TX. I'd curious know seeing mostly coronavirus patients sake knowing virus full ICUs never good thing. I'm kinda surprised we're hearing hospitals overflowing yet. There's going otherwise healthy thing people dying homes turned away hospitals there's flattening curve USA. Today birthday :) shaping one better ones considering. Actually goto restaurants, forcing people stay separated (six feet tables). bars didn‚Äôt that, since people standing close other. That's nearly many ppl died covid UK date, nice work yanks, stay country signed world. US ramping testing straight increase?

Football matters people dying. coaches dropping like flies. chunk kids barely breathe two weeks. grandparents start dying. 

All happen span 4 weeks. 

You idea wild, blind fear panic virus like. big talkers look dick fear fake virus! Herd immunity! Dumbasses too. 

The vast majority shut fuck dead people show fbook, Fbook live fills local known pillars oxygen masks choking ""take...this...seriously...guys"" gargly rasp suddenly blind fear pours in.  Yes countries free press citizen journalists. China none actively destroys independent reporting. Wisconsin opened, actually see much change participation. stayed home first. cases going again. almost like something common ... imagine everything going on, goes home every night scream paper bag.  Oof. Yeah. double edged sword. Ppl need hospitals. know TX said pop ups field hospitals Houston Dallas. 

I really hope healthcare workers get break. absolutely insane expect work like this. Everything sucks...grrr, trying stay positive creeps in. get mad position in, could prevented hope best option besides part. Anything make daddy trump happy guess That's political shit happen US. sub global pandemic. flood US shit. sub that. bright side, also two open democracies strong state independence relatively independent media making sure cases/deaths counted. charts likes Russia, Egypt even India suppressing counting. want extreme example, look Nicaragua. dictator simply pretended even exist. Thanks! Since we‚Äôve home March, I‚Äôve trying keep routine as:

wake - feee time
8am - breakfast education show
8:30 - dad takes break workbooks 
9am - free time 
10am - engineering toys (knex, legos, etc) 
11am - lunch board games 
12pm - quite time 
2pm - science (he loves nature it‚Äôs made videos)
3pm - dad doesn‚Äôt math (15 min)
4pm - learning clocks money 

Hopefully online kindergarten course doable well. Yeah wrong that, he's right 99.9% everything else. Trumpy wants less tests. US: lets make 100k!!!!! It‚Äôs attacking mainly black people Obviously people referring said ""we"". Nobody gets Mr COVID'S wild ride Hi 2269 students, covid eradicated yet? area opened gyms. Decided go early hopes around others. others masks required... point even move American even rich. Part reopening roadmap. protests reason rising cases, New York Washington, DC would seeing largest rise. aren‚Äôt. fact cases going protest centers. 

Reopening indoor venues without mandatory masks reason spike. Texas, Arizona, Florida getting hit hardest. USA, USA, USA know really want corona win out

Yet they‚Äôre one generalizing people? Nice projection. brother apart statistic. He's ICU med coma ventilator. cannot stop crying. Please stay home, wear mask, wash hands. wedding scheduled past March San Francisco. Cancelled wedding celebration got hitched officiant legal witness outdoors. regrets

Sociologists say common young countries. pioneers often settled uncivilized places government/ societal backup, became strongly independent (helping oneself survive). trait common throughout New World countries Australia. rally dumbest thing possible, quite literally

which course exactly trump wanted fear mongers site keep recycling BS every day. really gotten old... multiple statins though? Im saying ICU full covid patients. I'm saying, world expect Houston dial back hospital patients even pared back positive cases spiking? NY NJ 20 day lag complete shutdown positive cases peaking. Texas even shut yet, close bars yesterday. This. Administrative competency political ideology two different things. Related, different.  Democracy least worst form political organization, doesn‚Äôt guarantee competency others. Yup. Telling everyone useless wear masks unless trained medical professional definitely cost lives.

People blinded hatred Trump. Trump supported everyone would accept handling crisis downright dangerous. Herd immunity time !!!! hope people know what's enough balance ignorance.. I'm really sorry America, really fucking hope border stays closed fixed. Quite possibly 2022 things continue.

Just imagine fucked Canada borders open. meantime continental europe back almost normality. get fucked autumn imbecile overseas governments...fml even us *have* go stupid. take much, though. tried Hydroxy-Chloroquine? Good job Americans.

Best Luck future... So, pretty well, especially country dozens millions people. *Bu dum tss* think trust news Australia Chinese source. Trump took shit seriously beginning would told cult stay home follow mask orders, would done that. Instead got riled videos Karen's pulling phones Costco let without mask. find weird China way rn. problem US, still US much distance place 1. Don‚Äôt worry - president promised numbers go testing stops... Luckily old. Good thing contained country  done Europe done, would much better position

Like healthcare. labor laws. provided child care. educatonal systems. proportional representation instead first past post voting.

Feels like we're fallen third world nation. worry everyone! beat it! Thanks Mr. President destroying invisible enemy! We're safe!!!!!! 

/s Yeah, right. Part reason surge capacity unsustainable hospitals lose money. point, relatives' primary concern surge lasting long. can't stay surge capacity couple weeks. want full lockdown Arizona RIGHT leave surge capacity. know lockdowns can't go indefinitely, level they're hospitals can't go indefinitely either. autoimmune disease isn‚Äôt exactly weak immune system. It‚Äôs misguided immune system. case, it‚Äôs effectively already high alter time, little things like inflammatory foods heavy exercise excite much. gets excited starts rapidly attacking healthy tissue (my joints). 

So, start come illness, cold (another type coronavirus), body starts mounting massive attack fast. know dry tickling throat usually comes couple days congestion cold? get 5 hours goes away, leaves crippling joint pain takes 4 days prescription grade NSAIDs calm down. haven‚Äôt cold behind dry tickling throat since diagnosed. It‚Äôs years. New Zealand went apeshit two cases couple weeks ago many people Florida actually go shelters hurricanes. That's really necessary people live areas get storm surge mostly rich people beach front property probably somewhere else go. would worried everyone outside homes preparing hurricane hunkering down. I‚Äôm confident number come control Donny slows testing. Don‚Äôt worry folks. hand Confirmed case apt today (just outside Dallas) certainly going get bad. Could? Nice work Mr. President Ah wait, found -

God sent corona virus fury
God locked islands 
God canceled concerts 
God scared away sodomite idol

It appears they‚Äôre tour atm, catch next show live Kansas City, Missouri July 8th. guess that‚Äôs Elton John supposed there. depressing things are, entirely agree you, least ""it's over"" part. Medical professionals around world learning every day. see one article recently UK saying coronavirus hospital patients 4 times less likely die onset outbreak. 

Every action people take individually reduce spread, delay new cases ect gives time better treatment (and fingers crossed, vaccine) developed, save lives future. course. world works always has. think rich going let poor take first? Well partly him. can't bothered get ass lead thing, we're going ourselves. lot work, sure, freeloading carcass getting paid Twitter day. done, lives country. i‚Äôm server, supposed going back work next week. think i‚Äôm going quit instead. 

i love job seems damn risky i‚Äôm willing risk health people can‚Äôt fucking order carry out. i‚Äôm it. Luxembourg didnt death month.

At time tests ever before. (Luxembourg tests entire pop 1 month, nurses etc every 2 weeks)

So maybe good news jailed. BBC owned Britain, CBC owned Canada, Washington Post owned Jeff Bezos. Sinclair Media [pushes identical right wing talking across dozens stations. Rupert Murdoch owns Australia‚Äôs media. New York Times faithfully lied WMDs.

Compared that, CGTN *really* worse? end dude. still cases occurring Italy, Spain, China etc. Erm. Can't federal government finance response?

It government finance end day: choice anarchy slightly authoritarian methods everyone pick second  misread thanks Nah, Massachusetts great. go like wear masks indoors. states rise, would avoid indoor stuff altogether except groceries ‚ÄúWhether politics redder red bluer blue, coronavirus coming you‚Äù -me, definitely get messege across, sure messege be. Lol think we‚Äôre currently doing? vaccine designed already human trials performed exact reason. far two new outbreaks seem largely control. Let's hope numbers stay positive like this. 

We also hit less 100 patients left ICU today 8 deaths lowest number since March 1st! laughing fact America generated one day half many new cases virus China TOTAL!!!!!! 10% 10,000 cases still lot 50% 500 cases. Absolute number cases still matters, like elderly risk won‚Äôt touch young people infected. 65+ know tens thousands people infected outside somewhere (versus small amount people), would risk life going out? me.

That‚Äôs think stating younger population ones infected way sugar coat. also generally just...crappy. Last time visited, multiple front page posts people talking really vague symptoms sure COVID-19 3+ months, doctors kept telling something else. They‚Äôve trained whole life way. Thing is, mask could totally worked too. takes enough viral particles hands wipe nose eyes voila - infected. see many people gloves masks use gloved hands pull mask wipe noses gloved fingers. sit shaking head wondering... even understand basic science? course, answer clear not. county judge Texas like ""president"" county.


Hell, I'm even sure county judge actually hears cases. way know fucking died week, day last month level people go to. still going estates go economy fashion. talking stubborn, irrational based individualism. creative facts based individual beliefs, opinions controversies. water wet? that‚Äôs science tells us. 

America: No, it‚Äôs Jesus money. doctor even understand basic statistics? said looking cases spiking. said everything contributes equally. dumbest fucking doctor I've met considering what's happening Florida right time would better spent job (or better yet back med school brush basic science) arguing me.

And yeah, one action making things worse 10x another making worse 2x immediate issue needs solving ismthe 10x one. fucking learn medical school either? gaping wound leg small cut finger one detrimental health need urgent treatment fucking genius?

God damnit reply this. Go back work help save life. Let‚Äôs real, spikes aren‚Äôt happening protest cities. Unfortunately herd immunity guaranteed way end this, course high life costs. 
I find European solution risky, since started cases, blew up. stops happening again? way close borders forever realistic. betting money vaccines. fair, Japanese likely much better oral hygiene Americans, therefore wearing mask mean endure stinky breath. It‚Äôs like saying throw hard punch 100 year old guy saying died old age hard punch. healthy 20 year old would handled punch bleeding bruises old fragile die. No, we‚Äôll fight year, next year‚Äôs parties missing grandparents, aunts, uncles..... Fascinating honestly. think disneyworld goes excited reopening blows mind Months blamed China, Europe WHO, finally realized one fault B+ don‚Äôt mention one story TP shortage Wuhan played role inciting initial panic spread whether people understood not. bright side, they're going case study rest world. Insane, hospitals overrun, nothing it. lessen impact inevitably have. That‚Äôs amazing.

Getting close NYS peak numbers now, nothing see folks, keep party moving. loved ones pass away, wont care. point, crying spilt milk. Yeah know right testing. know Florida's testing procedures/numbers know UK really testing hospitalised cases lockdown Florida testing everyone could definitely make sense. Yes fuck them, throw jail, fine them. sentencing death constitution acting judge jury executioner. Yeah well, let guard down. takes one start party going. country you, country.

No-maskers: Sounds like liberal bullshit me! I've got freedom Super Spreader. Y'all lost freedom dying Covid. wear mask diligently I'm also staying indoors another 2 3 months. Staying home seeing one contact good mental health. Well, actually, article back sometime March man went around bars deliberately infect people, certainly outlier. batshit insane people every culture, sadly. Ah, didn‚Äôt think that. I‚Äôve spent much time morning thinking forgot divide calculator lol ""What kind world live in...? town needs enema."" - Jack Nicholson Joker many us do, think good friends! Sure, people never travel counties... Lol cause wouldn‚Äôt compare worthy forms life. untrue. getting information? PA department education meeting weekly see possible way get person learning, also realistic preparing virtual learning. Likely hospital reporting error. Haha, yes! Protest masks! Though, might actually work... Nope ICU occupancy 100. peak 4000+.

A new outbreak found today Lazio. Two restaurants owned person closed everyone eating last 5 days must contact HC system perform drive swab.
That 10th local outbreak discovered far.
Some older outbreaks (like one hospital Rome) seem control, others required limited quarantine area, couple nursing homes. Bulgarian workers Campania shipping company BRT Bologna stand 47 64 positives discovered far. Like restaurants early say control. number new confirmed cases continues accelerated rate , end next week might getting getting something like 70,000 - 80,000 new cases day.

It may stop enough tests find many people. 

In 2 -3 weeks guys could around 3000 deaths per day. lost. able get control situation. 

You still could proper leadership. would require locking everything back public viewing political. 2 months away could unlocking things, requiring masks fining shit people comply. Leaders like sheriffs complying? Lock up. could largely this. 

I see seem given though. chances happening current ""leadership""? pretty much zero. goal get money fast. 
We didn‚Äôt need people hurting administrators checked dead people. Also, dead people don‚Äôt spend money. 

Maybe use energy complain trillions went wealthy corporations. Lol. good morning obvious influence operation California (for example) actually take loan unemployment funds literally gone. Keeping testing 30000 day essential. Getting significantly higher crucial September, even classes schools open day two week. two reasons. Reason number one conspiracy theorists antivaxxers. Venn diagram refuse wear mask get vaccine nearly circle. working retail, noticed ratio one four.

Second, nationalized healthcare, every reason believe vaccine might expensive here. many able afford it, lot people talk like good thing.

In short, vaccine fix problems United States making COVID-19 bad here. say miraculously stop virus? That's strawman I've ever seen one. testing help, fact. want play refuse. That‚Äôll keep things afloat, product might good. Fewer stars. Lots rust soccer shown us anything far. Playoff format changes complained teams shouldn‚Äôt invited involved. it‚Äôs money, big market teams.

And spot on, players terrible managing money lifestyle requires millions dollars. They‚Äôre eager get back work, play games give purpose. Athletes without sports old, depressed, retired guys corner car dealerships whatnot. That's said initially, though. It‚Äôs beautiful. One favorite weekend trips. (Not right though) sound like learning disability makes hard distinguish comic section editorials. also protest law wear clothes public? 

If would mind explaining difference rights impacted wear mask vs shirt pants? Please, stop violating Hippos. 



Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA) can't second wave first one never ends! you‚Äôre top. US 7,700 daily deaths even without corona. ‚ÄúWay worse‚Äù 200k already seen less month normal people living normal lives. ‚Äúat risk‚Äù groups classified way are, 200k would dead end year anyway. Night clubs seems one worst places right now. Antibody tests Spain report 35% people true asymptomatics, I.e. never developed symptoms entire infection. hospitalization rate 5% overall. Yea, unless actually qualify state side. Even reduced hours alot people qualify still make much money. 
""I diagnosed yesterday ER COVID-19 months wearing mask rallies, churches funny capricious thing is,"" 

Which wear mask moron. immunity levels at? thought areas near 50% .....for now. hospitals get saturated probably longer true : Yesterday's data shift error! COVID Hospitalizations 5% two days ago (another time high). ICU beds COVID patients absolutely skyrocketed 7.5% two days ago. (Overall ICU bed usage dropped 87%). Ventilators use COVID 4% 2 days ago (all time high).

lmao ADHS cooking books usual UK here... us Boris Johnson complete tool advisors silence scientists SAGE. like stargazing, actually looking star, looking light emmited long time ago. took like around 4 days, minor symptoms sore throat experiencing slight fatigue mean? people right now, 3 months ago. Vaccines 100% effective people receive them. may 90% herd immunity kicks in. vaccinated person still get sick idiots refuse vaccinate. Yeah feel you! lot states love, honestly I‚Äôm worried happen everyone here, since many already uneducated, unsupported, poor. corona underlying problems exasperated, don‚Äôt know anywhere truly ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. say part doesn‚Äôt want leave, wants part solution, may take that! Luckily, section within US opposed vaccines/masks, still sensible people here, people education functioning brains. US Augustus Gloop something thought I'd thinking today Rural Americans worst Americans Florida 100% given virus response. Literally joke Basic human empathy left 2020 üòÇ Absolutely. good hear others experience trying quell virus feel like there's general lack information statistics. like want post positive rates death rates address infection rates, asymptomatic carriers dangerous symptomatic ones, pointed pre-symptomatic people...

More information better public understand living with. stop listening ""certain people"" want test makes numbers look bad. something like works harm people all, might see places like bars, airports, airplanes, meatpacking plants, more.

I'm still skeptical found magic subset UV-C fries viruses can't go thru skin eyeballs, hopefully there's testing this. Exactly.

I feel like conversation daily. watched pandemic response live china back january, later thailand. something countries did:

Temperature checks EVERYWHERE. Im talking mcdonalds, grocery store, pharmacy, train, even driving different city wait 2 hour queue passengers get checked. 

Everything essentials closed.

Check every establishment app (for contact tracing)

Masks required everywhere

Hand sanitizer applied enter new location

Despite everything control, bars still closed

China recent outbreak largely got things control. Thailand hasnt case local transmission since may. 

Learn asian countries handled properly, though may late US. Don‚Äôt need mandatory mask order majority wear masks. crazy. don‚Äôt even know local officials bother anything since governor doesn‚Äôt seem care. Luckily never stopped prepping get feeling lockdown it‚Äôs gonna long time. Lol would stem let call someone virgin? may try, mean anyone listen. Hey, described dad!

""So much earn part time losing UI benefits?¬†Using CA example, current maximum UI benefit $450, could earn per week $600 ($400/0.75) losing UI benefits. Anyone earning $600 p/week $32,000 per year would eligible regular state unemployment hence eligible additional¬†[$600 Exactly this. people catch it, less people transmit therefore spreads slower. completely shut down? Doubt it. using silly math.

First - .004 number conditions applicable - read CDC article linked restrictions contained therein: 
1) must covid19 positive 
2) must showing signs illness (symptomatic) 
3) must 65

NOW - math assumes everyone USA get Covid19, hence start 370 million number. That's accurate all. Many exposed exposed catch virus.

Here's video scientist who's studying data he's almost ready publish findings he's saying data showing 80% people susceptible Covid 19. assuming he's correct reduce 350 million number 70 mil - that's many people MIGHT get disease still exposed contract it. everyone who's exposed catches it. 

So look many patients become symptomatic - numbers place. I've seen estimating 80% positives asymptomatic like 17%. Let's pick something like say 40% damned sure 100% 80% seems way high 17% seems way low. means 60% people test positive develop symptoms. (70 mil * 60% = 42 mil). 

NOW number - figure many 65. Since elderly susceptible probably say higher percentage positive patients develop symptoms let's say 60% 65 leaves 40%. (42 mil * 40% = 16,800,000) 

NOW number .004 expected die disease gives us 67,200.

AND easy say ""Wait that's WAY lower current death rate""....so ask is. start see issue numbers reported.

The numbers reported manipulated. states like Colorado adjusting death numbers 23% expected, issues. that, Fed Govt reimbursing (meaning paying money to) states, cities, hospitals, sorts organizations treatments Covid19 patients institutions anything drive numbers. Even lie. 

Yes lie happening. Here's video nurse details many manipulations occurring. video Illinois public officials clearly stating ANYONE dies whatever cause, test positive, listed Covid19 death!! That's mentality many places driving numbers up. may think that's one state dismiss it. Nope - here's Fed leaders saying exact thing. financial incentives manipulate data, one state already lowered death numbers video proof shenanigans, one can't help conclude data manipulated. 

When data still manipulated degree - must thrown out.   
You cannot continue use reported numbers draw conclusions them. Absolutely someone much bad reaction masks folks probably shouldn‚Äôt first place pandemic. believe grocery stores work folks actually issues like bringing car don‚Äôt go store. even matter can't won't.

I'd argue 100% won't. else would be? hope take time read facts medical experts take look something else besides Fox News. America one last countries suffering every form.  1776? Haha Denmark people even say anything shopkeep wait politely ask help needed get news from? get checked often nursing homes. made priority started get thoes nursing homes care givers anyone working thoes fields priority hasnt changed...  I'll drive thru I'm wearing mask, since fast food workers around wear masks clock. far I've okay. thing stop going stir crazy. drive around aimlessly.. this, fantasy, not. people Florida declare emergency session

This demonstrates exactly mask wearing catching america. many people make excuses instead cooperating. 

the majority world problem putting mask need look constant guidance politicians issue. much cultural problem among americans much political problem. Yes, anytime I'm downvoted obviously worldwide botnet conspiracy me. sake FL actually reported 9,636 new cases, it‚Äôs 51 more, matters. ummmmm.....gun rights, religious freedom, name it...it's years, reasonable limitations become RIGHT DESCRIMINATE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS!!! RIGHT MILITARY GUN!!!. doesnt make sense all. fraction percent stimulus, calm junior imposed safer home. thing.

Today went mall (in Modena) buy birthday gift father 36 degrees outside still inside mall, every shop, bars... AC. Everyone sweating like crazy heat plus mask think really helps lowering spread. don't, point governors take action. First step admitting problem Trudeau said best lol 

 Typical American conservative reaction. seems happening almost exclusively right. thought spread much outdoors? This.

NY NJ almost certainly highest deaths US far.  Damn that‚Äôs scary think people saying lockdowns localized entire state. Also one expected BS reopening we‚Äôve seen. herd immunity reached people immunity much slower spreads. cant spread half people normally would therefore spreads much slower. rights suspended infringe rights others. reason can't yell ""Fire"" crowded movie house -- unclear yelling ""Movie"" crowded firehouse also restricted. wear mask protect nearly much everyone else wearing one protect you. Life, liberty, pursuit happiness -- basic fundamental human rights upon base everything. Denying rights someone else seceded crown first place. begin producing latex masks ...

I‚Äôve working 9 days straight lol. 

And ya. Clearly don‚Äôt understand exponential growth parabolic growth think mitigating one source important. Ro virus. infectivity. transmission works. analogy might worst thing i‚Äôve ever heard. 

Let make something clear. 


Stopping. Every. Point. Of. Transmission. Is. Vital. 


have good day. know. see people talking people claiming ‚Äúown libtards‚Äù people actually claiming ‚Äúown libtards‚Äù still lot younger 28. Fox News deserves disbanded. Well person individually caused much damage worldwide they'd tried Hague, that's much expect corpo. I'd happy disbanding. please stay Canada too. Americans stay home! vaccine last resort solution 

lmao, going  tell virus go away? solution. Maybe allergic chemtrail spread, 5g activated mind control! said terrorism, terrorism side, side. Ground zero jobs ranged literally accosting oppressing people (farmers, trades people etc) removing land resources consolidate oil land opiate industry international American companies. enter 2006 big pharmaceuticals paying doctors push drugs American people (big bonuses doctors pushing pills big pharma) opiates epidemic begins '06 America. 

I joined military early 2000 thinking honor fighting country, never expected feel like piece shit finding fighting innocent people gain giant corporate conglomerates. people firing guns us?!? Becuase terrorists?! came country fucking oppressed fired guns them. media spins like bad guys?!

What fuck would country's soldiers came America started bully oppress you? get guns fight back reckon! oh wait, invading country's mainsteam media painting picture around world bad guy defending life land. Geezer almost makes feel like strapping bomb hopelessly trying take many possible longer home, family dead nothing left...

Same thing happening Israel many country's story every fucking time!!

But feel free go back check news headlines mid 2000s fighting terrorism... NO, sad truth creating feeding it, American citizens needlessly hurt killed corporate gains. injured physically mentally, best friend actually killed IED. friends acquaintances hurt killed well long standing trauma knowing wrong thing still anyways job objective. Well come back home, many us continue suffer hold onto guilt, try deal substances, us find end gun all. 

All corperations gain billion trillion more?! fucking bullshit. bullshit. wish Americans would wake fuck realize country run fucking dirt cost actual american lives! 


On daily basis feel helplessly alone time, angers ends. Sometimes think people cannot see truth deserve suffer die. care anymore anything all?! one man, honestly one gives shit world going burn. 

You psychopathic criminals running show, dumb ass citizen fucks propagating psychopathic corperate narratives, greed lies every turn helpless small bunch people really feeling end wits struggling find real solutions fix problem.

I apologize offends anyone upset happening. part solution infact part problem.

I know even anymore, vent frustration reddit guess hopes may actually clue seeing light situation world. Meanwhile heap oblivious disbelievers downvote hell back Daddy America would never steer wrong media lie us...

XCurlyXO thanks taking time respond hear say. lost faith people too, every there's someone like willing seek truth. kind gives hope purpose still here, thank &lt;3 tend Republicans always ""me first""- idea anything might benefit fellow man antithetical identity.

They also tend religious- know, Jesus said ""To hell thy neighbor!"" country doesn‚Äôt shut 4 th July celebrations close spots people congregate fucked. Remember china shit chinese new year, huge holiday. knew right thing do. Yes generally accepted least Texan city Texas. That's great example. internet locked up, freedom speech thing concentration camps minorities.

It takes everything snap ignorance around me.. like yeah, underlying health conditions sure. even people COPD oxygen tanks recommended wear masks doctors. I'd say probably around Reagan, first movie/tv star president people looked economic advice reason. Whenever GOP started think party rugged individualism got taken corporations wait, would mass violence obligate US population wear mask order save lives? Here‚Äôs might able get fucked country don‚Äôt take seriously. 

Let know around 60 million people become unemployed within last 4 months nothing changes, half country unemployed year. parents? want able find work support themselves? remind unemployment runs out. 

Ask parents relatives become sick, able afford insane medical bills come hospitalized? die, debt passed parents onto children.

Ask kind future want would possible 150,000,000 million people looking get work. 

The future saved everyone respects wearing mask social distancing. Something ""operation lightspeed"" mesh human trials. kind central guiding organization, every state could access medical scientific expertise needed respond rationally crisis. Right. it‚Äôs hateful ignore science put vulnerable lives risk don‚Äôt inconvenienced. Fuck off. comments stories Italy beyond weird. People saying, ‚ÄúItaly example world....if USA followed Italy‚Äôs lead....etc‚Äù

It burned killed vulnerable, they‚Äôve reached closest example herd immunity. That‚Äôs first get hit, special sauce. 

The line argument seen NYC. Cuomo didn‚Äôt anything special....it burned passed first wave. There‚Äôs masterful crisis management here. never irony people, spiteful hypocrisy.

they're terrible irony. take glee contradicting ""to fuck people."" Ohio doesn‚Äôt require masks? thought did. People also share drinks, grab round hand out, touching bottle, etc. may share cigarettes drinking too. know weed better alcohol

Depends view it.

I consider alcohol, presuming taken moderately interfere everyday life less bad someone smokes weed wastes life away wanting nothing. Anecdotal observation recent trips grocery store; 10% people wear masks. vast majority also overweight. wife commented something effect ""Why surprised that? care themselves, would expect care everyone else?"" That's good point, suppose. Maybe getting half hearted ""okay maybe little wrong"" better nothing. guess little frustrated ""person ignores coronavirus precautions, person gets coronavirus, person urges others careful"" stories keep popping up, worse statewide level.

The problem individual people deciding cautious two fold:

1. want to, level , trust government keep safe. people protesting reopening saying ""Well, reopened safe,"" taking precautions mandated law.
2. Even want careful, coordinated rules safe not. I'm pretty cautious city responses different. people refuse order take cooking food home, others ordering take out, trust raw ingredients supermarket. people wearing masks everywhere, including outside, others believe outside 6 ft away strangers, need wear mask. Still others believe that, outside, safe long lick person's face. people even washing food bleach eating (which, case know, really REALLY do). Without strong, consistent rule set leaders, people making rules based gut feeling, friends doing, random stuff find internet.

 **tl;dr: People bad keeping safe. need sort coordinated group effort get everyone page.** protesting. mainstream media report that, I'm confident effect especially since Philly Allegheny Counties driving minor upticks PA. agree first half comment, think refusing wear mask political ideology. American I'm exhausted obsession individualism. totally understand appreciate benefits, look around see negatives can't help feel we've allowed go far unchecked. I'm even saying laws need put place, culturally lack something would help us hold accountable.

Everything expression individualism now, everyone wants believe beginnings underdog story odds they're going change world.

Earth round? Nah fam I'm pretty sure flat. dare tell I'm wrong though.

You want get vaccine? FUCK trying give autism. looked google know truth!

I appreciate need teach scientific theory school feel like we're teaching wrong theory. really need mix little creationism thats I'm told believe.

What mean hold trash get home? I'm gonna toss street, can't bothered carry me.

MY taxes used pay PUBLIC transportation? bother? drive mother fucking HUMMER bro, get level.

And icing cake: ""Why help pay someone else's health care? Fuck get sick, smart enough get job reward health insurance. Fuck anyone winning like me.""

Seriously, unchecked individualism cancer. Moreover, reopen memorial parties started one month ago. Breakout among protesters likely traced back couple weeks.  Department Labor (DOL) guidance pretty clear to¬†qualify partial nominal amount UI compensation qualify entire $600 weekly unemployment stimulus payment.¬†Or stated DOL guidance, even individual eligible receive least one dollar ($1) underlying benefits claimed week, claimant receive full $600 FPUC.""

Ok, Maybe someone clear confusion. right, governor Cuomo worldometers. According states numbers less 20 deaths day worldometeres 40-60. who's right? bet seeing similar title tomorrow. point, surprising. Smear drop soap lenses wipe dry cloth. Leaves transparent film behind stops fogging. ""Tyrants""

If obligations towards others, others obligations towards you. idea ""tyrant"" incoherent obligations exist.

It's obvious everyone real basis adult tantrum idea someone could *tyrannical* order wear mask *so fucking kill others sociopathic dimwitted selfishness *. 

You arguments sound reasons huffing puffing like spoiled child mean ol judge telling wear fucking mask. Give inner child cookie go take nap imbecilic lickspittle. Let also remind Japan surrounded water humid making outside infection much less likely, air conditioning popular compared USA making inside infection less likely air conditioning lowers humidity. think it, testing Americans cost less 10 billion. Yeah clearly know anything Gotland. assumption... simple mathematical reality.

Either people infected greater rate now, infected greater rate before.

There way increased testing result rate positives. Amazon Prime delivery folks always wear masks. happens popular people get elected. Let nerds run things please. Negative. BLM protestor number eats anti-mask protest breakfast. Also many people wear masks BLM protest. mention people screaming other‚Äôs faces. wonder fucking crisis foday Good Place, highly recommend watching seen Wow country 10 cases today, America truly f*cked badly works non-narcissists charge. failure thus unacceptable.  Thats russian tactic basically.... far ICUs

That's good since really much treatment matters less healthcare issues. long ICU beds ventilators available save lives postpone deaths others moving numbers US.

I think alone. imagine huge number countries MUCH worse reporting, Pandemic, Globally, much worse currently detecting.

Brazil need lot testing, however test lot many nations, USA. enough? No. better many nations. gym gym. article contain science based infection rate location gym, gyms high spreading areas.

Science shown social distancing prevented spread. appropriate social distancing need mask unless area high population density. black white 'no mask = spread'

A mask going anything 2 people opposite sides aircraft hanger. supermarket might true, part article incorrect? Never underestimate stupidity America. Wow I‚Äôm surprised Arizona isn‚Äôt list. know many people tested positive. ü•∫ church burning books discrediting science centuries. one hundred percent false, possibly stupidest thing ever heard anyone ever say site. effectively blaming cancer patients disease. feel like first SARS-CoV-2 particle bound lung cells? start quarantining right second? inform around infected caused infection? Anything else would immoral.

Your inflated ego blinded ignorance. respect science reason, part problem country. Yeah hard  rught, happened countries cities first.. maybe could seen happened

If people study disease living... maybe could asked help plan

if local towns defying immense stupidity... could changed mind...

poor Abbott, right? kiwi: pfft guys still getting cases. 
Our cases border fumbled government tightened right up. opening quarantine centers country returning kiwis feel like mean wanting let run around covid already lockdown Dude like 10 people country pretend like actually pinpoint exact moment location pick one contagious viruses we‚Äôve ever come contact with? Libraries exactly happening places. Whoa whoa whoa.. two sides every arguement entitled opinion as.... Checks notes... career epidemiologist Fake. Protests large part surge new patients. 

Hypocritical say it‚Äôs okay large protests Olympic, parade, concerts, etc... Don‚Äôt fooled politically motivated news articles. started return work. wife even couple meals favorite restaurants. talked realtor selling house it‚Äôs time downsize. stayed home, sanitized, always wore masks thanks selfish assholes ignorant think know doctors we‚Äôre back shit. 

Thanks fuckers! Thanks lot. absolutely difference state still haven‚Äôt opened bars recipe disaster. knew right? üôÑ  Spanish Flu came 4 waves first wave considered mild we‚Äôre even first wave yet? Also, first wave Spanish Flu killed less Americans COVID... might want take victory lap first wave flu lasted spring-summer 1918 relatively mild.[31] Mortality rates appreciably normal;[32] United States ~75,000 flu-related deaths reported first six months 1918, compared ~63,000 deaths time period 1915.[33] likely many daily infections detected tests. like 80th story old fuck person dying. 


We get it, sometimes old people die.  nice starting point. think cheese factor may bit high though. Oh yeah breathing fucking tube weeks totally OK then. Soooo much fun bedridden hospital could enjoying life absolute mongo. Yeah everything going especially state (Florida) fudges numbers well russia little quiet outbreak first makes suspicious numbers point.   Yes there‚Äôs testing % positive going (in past week) anyone really surprised? say lot leaders, course, also says lot personal social responsibility, lack of, lot citizens. Yes, leaders acting way acting, yes response leaders pretty much sucks. However, time people nations need also act responsible fashion. Yeah lost respect stance virus masks. Total year 3,091.

I doubt high may June? peak winter? Depends definition horrific catastrophe. would say 120k dead already qualifies. Others much. Best wishes brother, virtual hugs moral support family. really hope get lock again, people careful enough there. He's probably full shit based what? fact Americans treated disease innately rational matter? Beacuse haven't. won't. ideology tells never wrong. ""You really keep words self loathing yourself."" Brazil needs LOT testing, sure. USA. 

My point need testing, do, point that, true, many nations much worse testing, thats appear issues Brazil America. people point keep (and try) keep families safe.

After that, dice throw unfortunately.

Stay safe can. California Orange County resident absolutely horrified next month. Literally almost everybody stopped caring: everybody going bars restaurants big parties steps security. hope government takes right steps shut things it‚Äôs late massive outbreak, even though stuck beach towns protest claiming masks unhealthy spread virus. worry. Climate change running full steam ahead debate rights cough other. Collapse inevitable. Sick winning, might say That‚Äôs hard one wouldn‚Äôt anywhere else world right (although NZ would okay well). knows future holds feels like living different world watching playing overseas. 

There mandatory 14 day quarantine hotel arrival (paid govt unless that‚Äôs changed recently). best downvotes come there. I‚Äôm actually trying figure they‚Äôre anti-mask COVID-denying, haven‚Äôt seen good rational explanation yet. Gang I‚Äôd like take, ‚ÄúThings didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd thinking GoT finale bad time last year‚Äù $1000, Alex. Isn‚Äôt city California called Ontario? abbreviates Ontario, CA? thats *awful* hahaha Telling americans move, _right now_, pretty bad.

Just stay Stratholme politicians put in. dumping people hospitals weren‚Äôt sick enough get admitted hospitals refusing take back. hospital Philly too. bullshit nursing homes part I‚Äôm saying there‚Äôs real difference stuff CGTN mainstream sites western bloc.

The existence (or absence) ‚Äòcitizen media‚Äô irrelevant comparison.  500+ memory list Russian healt care workers.  
Although know represantive is, e.g. Dagestan's official numbers bit quistionable.  
Moscow undercounted well .

Good question, doubt never know real answer. prediction. That's said lucky. I'm looking data behavior society, government's businesses. think it'll even worse that. would waste though awesome soul. Thank ton. keeps night. (kinda like right lol)

I grew severe Asthma. go hospital regularly kid get nebulizer could breathe. would nebs ventilator hours hours struggling breathe. worst nightmare come true, think people grasp like struggling breathe hours end, passing lack oxygen woken chest compressions screaming family. 

I honestly believe footage people dying played news much political, smokescreen bullshit, think people would take seriously. 

As now, I'm going stay safe can. Here's another fun fact add this. sister, best friend, partner essential. live sister best friend. out, day, everyday, exposed this. take precautions, even people done everything right dying. stress anxiety caused state putting money family friends lives absolutely maddening. fortunate enough highly skilled tech, work home. variable place, could die moment this. 

I talked bit another thread, but, group people live 3 doors us got COVID. used laugh me, heckle balcony, stand groups outside ""defiance"". Well, group gathering anymore. 1 hospitalized others lockdown. asking us pool money together ""tragic act God."" my, quickly people seem need others help trust things go awry, fuck us otherwise.

We feel like trapped, going die work rate. memeing edgy, really hope last reddit post, certainly hope family okay. Scoots standees give fuck us. one does. second heard bastards thank people ""sacrifice"", longstanding fears double confirmed. Money Lives. Full stop. 

I'll stop here... thank you. Seriously thank you. know may seem like much, genuinely helped stranger. Thanks this, hope make this. 

The one time, modern history unified enemy, can't come together care even little. terrifying. 

Guess cant say ""avoid like plague."" anymore... amazing often folk like reply sort meaningless shite, rather ever learn listen. link posted dude. least BLM people wearing masks part. Don‚Äôt worry, go away warm weather gets here.... Also, understand collectively decided snack public good idea. Take great, can't spread food touched people sick? Seems like main transmission happens people touch faces. Never mind bot use leaves p*litics specific topics randomly instantly nukes post even mention either party Tr*mp. mods also refuse review bot even it‚Äôs relevant topic hand. remember known new cases. add dont know they've infected, arent reported, etc. wayyyyy worse People die every day... Like 8000 day. Unless know, decided hard Brexit... always think much would've different Italy:

- closed one week earlier

- isolated elder care 

- closed industry plants 3 weeks earlier

- forced public mask wearing 2 months earlier (it basically took foot may).

We would looking chinese-south korean like numbers right would've got back normal life much earlier.

On side, also think would've looked like used ""don't touch freedom and, bu-bu-but economy"" approach killed much people economy.

The US went beacon liberty justice, country really want like last 4 decades looking like getting better all. Reddit 1 months ago: ""anybody want complete total home quarantine lockdown ignorant danger society... pack streets full thousands people shoulder shoulder shouting unison good wear mask teehee""

Reddit now: huge coronavirus spikes especially NY CA? *surprised Pikachu face* love internet archives.

However even struggles, many deadlinks pages. Also remember struggled pages shockwave flash elements. tried get band‚Äôs website 90s, page archived shockwave intro, couldn‚Äôt get past navigate site. Stupid stupid does. Surgeon General shown make stork harness t-shirt agree prognosis conclusion? makes sense. means we're headed another lockdown, give us chance get right time, hopefully? cost tens thousands lives overwhelming strain health care system‚Äîdevastating, obviously. seems like way us learn lesson? get control willing make sacrifice stay home (and government pay us so).

Are things objectively worse first lockdown? Probably, true testing lot testing March/April woefully insufficient. think there's still chance could get control ""second pass"" finally everybody understands done why. core Christianity Jesus death resurrection. last supper told would happen. Empires come end point, guess Covid-19 Trump US. That's country total Trump, held accountable? from, wanna visit planet. Funny riots this. Causality? see people acting like fear mongers actual fear mongers. shit getting old stale fooling anybody. Go wear mask!  ""they burned books despite Christian, it"" works too. far know, contact tracing US generally sucks. Maybe look Table 3 international case studies, useful set illustrations (tldr: Basically indoors/enclosed space = high risk) get misunderstanding purpose ""civility"". decades society aversion conflict actively encourage confront one-another behavior stemmed belligerent willful ignorance. ignore them.""

or stoop level.""

The behavior mindset people carry *threat* us all, ignoring threat makes complicit consequences follows.

""An eye eye makes world go blind"" fucking work guy still stabbing people eye nobody wants one confront them! happens almost daily. catch singing shower sometimes meant sense vetted/reviewed looks like pre-print hasn‚Äôt really scrutinized. many people yelling might even need goggles proper mask truly stay safe. is, retract statement, however many articles speak total hospitalizations idea originated. medical expert realize NZ 0 cases now? new 7 cases came renationalizing citizens still contact trace program set, unlike America. right. hard get sense happening there. Yea think confusing us gen Z cuz use still mid 20s. People lose jobs virus, lost businesses forced shut lost months income.

*BEEEEEP* political history era written 30 years, refer ""strongman"" era, they'll lump US together Russia, Brazil, UK. They'll say, ""These strongmen characterized opposition science evidence-based policy decisions. result, Coronavirus pandemic particularly devastating countries. Comparing death rates countries like South Korea Austria, surmised 500,000 [?] people died needlessly due poor policy decisions."" develop both? would intentionally turn one away know works effective favor one may may work safe/effective? We're caught vaccine people forgetting never safe, effective coronavirus (not SARS, MERS, etc.) vaccine human use. I'm 100% pro mask use. want say first people throat thinking anti-mask post.

But literally idea reasons Japan (and many asian countries) low death toll. Masks could well play role, even large role. many facts play. post really seems imply mask use playing primary role way knowing that, many things could be.

Here interesting article examining various factors play death tolls include differences strains various parts world, differences obesity levels, differences weather, differences genes immune systems asian populations european counterparts others.

But referring entire country here. Bars restaurants reopened month half ago, free movement allowed since june 3rd people travel foreign countries including UK Sweden need quarantine.

The point lockdown hard people behaved well saved regions.
That first important thing. Regions need lockdown still behaved well emergency


Then lockdown lot stuff done.

Increased ICU capacity got extra ventilators organized covid areas.
Setup areas quarantine people chance spend quarantine home.
Made masks mandatory closed areas, regions also made mandatory open air.
Also regions distributed free masks (i got far 37 masks free!). Masks prices set 50 cents nationwide widely available.
Some companies able switch production masks hand sanitizers.
Smart working heavily suggested beaurocratic hurdles removed.
Increased testing capacity 10x.
Invested money blood tests, performing massive screenings medical workers nursing homes. region also extended people worked contact customers lockdown, general population.
Now ongoing nationwide statistic study blood tests.
Setup drive-through testing.
Allowed everyone wants access blood tests (igm igg ones) reasonable price 25 50 euro.
Developed released contact tracing app (not getting lot downloads far TBH) actually respects privacy also able interoperate similar apps developed EU countries (those use Google/Apple APIs).
Plus many procedures, rules, monitoring systems also local level.

So taken example tragedy happened lombardy nyc. ""Stupidity Causes Cancer""

What think reasoning? 

- Yes, human think so, probably less all. help, keep going. previously thought endurance would difficult us. hard this, not, price high form several sick human lives. 

Anna Starbrink also says seems young people difficulty adhering recommendations. thinks younger ones see disease threat themselves.

- young healthy think dangerous me. maybe is, respect, empathy solidarity many others, elderly isolated many months now. think many young people well, sake others this.

Unlike congestion outdoor dining, frequently discussed spring, region legal tools stop crowding parks beaches. ban crowds 50 people apply parks. Anna Starbrink says ""very frustrated"" lack opportunities prevent congestion. 

- would like government address issue see opportunity reduce congestion beaches quays. imagine looks around Sweden, popular tourist resorts nice places. would good could take national grip this, says.


The Public Health Authority made forecasts epidemic may develop recent months, relation Swedes' behavior changing. authority expects scenario increased contact people result increased center distribution regions. Stockholm, however, possible new wave believed smaller in, example, Sk√•ne less spread infection Stockholm.


On Friday, Johan Bratt, chief physician Stockholm region, said situation health care strained control. care sites staffed Stockholm's emergency hospital year location last year, said statement. 


Anna Starbrink concerned health care region exhausted get tough spread infection increases again. 


- Healthcare shown outstanding ability cope this, really taps forces worried endurance staff worked extremely hard spring, says.


As parent children summer's Stockholm, also responsibility ensure follow recommendations, says Anna Starbrink. 


- parent teenagers myself, responsibility talk children say important keep distance remind important. using global possibility diminish impact actual deaths one country.

So really 50 governments themselves. handles pandemic pretty well (see NY, CT). Others obviously not. Much due leadership top, vary state state.

But unlike countries, US built federal government mandate welfare states. COULD done dire situations, I'm us agree certainly one, happen without friction. like countries federal leadership mandates everyone falls line.

Federal versus states rights adversarial US since country founded. agree better leadership federal level could done more, never going smooth process.

That sucks pandemic. beneficial many scenarios. gonna look reports early on. guy always slimy piece shit. disaster shed light it. ... yeah... numbers also agreement.. People freaking garage sales.

The death rate artificially propped ridiculous 10% beginning huge chunk cases severe ones, mostly elderly, testing capacity widespread today. People mild symptoms encouraged tested would waste time. statistics became negatively skewed. never said stop fighting it, I‚Äôm saying opportunity get ahead gone.

This many people fail understand.

If tens thousands cases every day hospitals become run covid patients dying, everyone need urgent medical attention. Ro's I'm referencing hospitalization-based, two weeks old. Sure slow now, we're already fucked uprising citizens would immediately crushed US military blame people? told remained surfaces 17 days, airborne hours, wear mask (Fauci), etc...

Then 200 Doctors came signed document stating support millions people streets pandemic acted like NBD.

Now protests quelled back draconian rules regulations. people talking everyone people ignoring risk weeks recently. 

Nobody knows believe anymore. Many sides blame act like distrust unfounded makes question perception basic logic. disgusting. teensy tiny bit good news Florida. wonder [these feel it.

Yeah, unfortunately going work all. lot advice given. Stay home, wash hands frequently, go out, social distance wear mask. nothing else do! wear mask seems like right thing do. rest, idk man. cant trust anything coming whitehouse (even Fauci admits Trump censoring him); no1 else taking mantle leadership. dont blame people knowing do.

Australia Texas population. Australia abit 100 deaths cause went proper lockdown early (southern states stuffed abit tho). Texas bit 2300 dead people, serious lockdown.

Even die, lungs get eaten inside damaged, possibly see, vote, thats supposed sway electoral college, corp come say hey mr guy, heres million dollars, vote guy also say anythin. 


then takes money votes unpopular way oust next election... 


So like popular vote matters elected representative whoever pays most. think pointed US history got scolded it. Surely Politicians hold higher regard swayed bribe. Sounds like better plan GOP strategy [flooding zone Drumcree parade 1997 sharing drinks smokes? Mind blowing. mentioned spikes, outbreaks? Fauci disagrees. said effective methods, including hospitalization rate hear dismayed decision reopen prematurely. 

However, elected officials ultimate final deciders things like this. That‚Äôs elect them. (hopefully) take information many sources perspectives make decision (hopefully) firm set guiding principles ethics make decision. 

Not scientists public health officials room saying ‚Äòdon‚Äôt open people get sick/die, I‚Äôm sure state budget analysts, political advisors, etc saying ‚Äòthe economy fucked budget deep red‚Äô ‚Äòhere‚Äôs polls saying‚Äô.

The accountability decision lie single person system. case, Abbot made totally wrong decision defend told decisions led people dying. 

Is perfect? all. it‚Äôs system have. people elect core skill sets making speeches raising money. Elected statewide officials federally elected officials seem biased towards ‚Äòthe economy‚Äô ‚Äòpolitics‚Äô less people‚Äô ‚Äòpublic health‚Äô. creatures system lost touch people serve. 

That‚Äôs belief anyways. Remember though peak detecting 1 10 infections. catching higher percentage now, don‚Äôt know is. It‚Äôs also rich careless people don‚Äôt care inconvenienced. I‚Äôm sure factor many cases traced restaurants, bars parties. Well, yeah, pandemic shutdowns tend discriminate behaviors, events, business types tend spread disease question. mean unjust discrimination though. agree steps want take, plus course lockdowns working home, absolutely disagree decent diminish impact 126 thousand Americans already died unnecessarily things. bunch parades apparently 1997 actually responded armored vehicles crushing people starting riots. 20s apcs soccer games.

Yes, great government, government actually enforce laws cause financial hardship form immediate fines. Turns idiots listen pocketbook quickly, general. god shuffled feet like Monte Python animated character,, pulled ‚Äúsend straight Hell‚Äù lever NYC compliance high. 90% more. People believe virus NY. Lol ok boomer üòπ Awww look republitard snowflake. He's melting he's angry! Poor babe! Japan ALWAYS super big masks, people wear flu season, uncommon point really.

This also meant struggle supplying either.

I've thought large chunk Americans conditioned empathy go crazy ""their rights"" certain political elements push agenda. live Kentucky know least 3 families travelled Florida last week vacation. One family still week. Posted lots pictures social media, didn‚Äôt see single mask. 

I‚Äôm related one families throwing graduation party daughter weeks. work woman another family - one currently Florida. 
We still working home probably go back office August. want around woman, anyone else work could contact her.

I feeling Kentucky going get worse coming weeks. Especially governor - done great job prior - continuing next phase opening state starting Monday. also allowing nursing home visitation near future.

I deeply concerned state country. Yeah that‚Äôs true. Maybe vaccine made scratch wasn‚Äôt. Could available around October according experts. Also probably chill. I‚Äôve heard always gets passport stamped crosses border last point sad very, true. protects going unmasked would. Would prefer that? Science country really really dealing situation poorly. vs country pretty much crushed contact tracing testing lacked. 

Yet, one protest similar amount cases 15,000 people opposed protest scale tens times lager everyday....

Something doesn‚Äôt add up. town outside Boston public antibody testing confirmed cases 7x undercounted strict 10 week lockdown. Given FL long head start minimal social distancing isn‚Äôt starting zero, that. Still, sympathies. I'm glad restaurant decided reopen slowly, scheduling July 1st, esecpially since think we're gonna makenit things closed again. takeout-only model fine us. 

I would've mortified guest sprang me. Hope stay well. Yeah wire sown already find them. states, seems, guaranteed insure US never controls infection rate. within states selfish people insure elected officials keep doubling must votes. second thought old headline yesterday, no, we‚Äôre lucky. 15.8% positive result too! we're going needlessly lose 33k lives then. That's tragic. say like cake banned throughout US. even still get cake Costco, big one feeds whole football team. Lmao sub people bad experiences like catastrophizing. Point part that's wrong. one libtards then?

Moderates similar issue. willing pay universal healthcare. Given able bodied treating least seriously, often asymptomatic presymptomatic contagion vectors.

It's kind reverse Darwinism - I, coworker, go bar hopping, mom dies. years ago, asked Trumpet when, precisely, thought America ‚Äúgreat.‚Äù

His answer 1780s. Quick common sense gun control work call center someone told attending funerals. forgot funeral even thing pandemic.

So yeah funerals people dying therefore causing spread funerals. Good job person. know part half people still even know what/who symbols even represent someone told looked up. even pick choose Google article read/believe I'm sure. think end result people weak impatient, think might complicated reasoning people got first place. I'm means apologist people, there's reason someone can't something simple wear mask.

It seems there's inherent system constructs led people trained people care others. people might naturally inclined narcissists, think lot people taught shitty people something whether news, maybe weird twisted teaching ignorant pastor church, ignorant parental upbringing, cyclical societal/peer pressure bad people.

It also help government officials damn baby-child president says things does.

It really amaze though bad feels population(even though might crazy loud minority(?)...I really hope many people feels like see internet.)

I've advocate long time ideas opening things way early, people lack discipline patience inconvenience, wearing masks.

I family friends spoken social media much hate inconveniences they're sick masks; want go back bars they're bored (also posting pictures places like Wisconsin opened places ""thank god people smart enough open, take longer"", like mid/late April whatever. People went shopping early morning openings stand able go shopping spree pandemic. 

Meanwhile I'm rolling eyes people fail internalize facts ***just officials right tell something...doesn't always mean go safe it.*** People look reason stretch break rules get away things. lot people impatient, lazy, narcissistic. Wearing mask distancing hard. going *that* hard look what's line. People act like literally apocalypse gonna fucked like 5 years isolation quarantine. year time blip suck go real fast. patient span time, gotta do, things way manageable nice things again.  biggest issue beginning told wearing masks wasn‚Äôt necessary combat COVID later told was. caused lot antivaxx crowd go arms wearing them. manage restaurant south Florida, $1000 sales yesterday bar 25% capacity, last year. So.... Ummm Texas. snowflakes definitely smartest. 0.4% Australia - ""flare up"" one state. Another state new cases, people quarantine testing positive. 6 states territories ZERO. I've got mine already still well point moot? sister who's esthetician cannot open shop? brother shop mall cannot open. folks mind, fun little reddit bubble. clear real world moving without you. can't see would logically work. Take scenario Person A-D sitting around table: 

Person A: asymptomatic COVID. Coughs elbow. droplet particles diffuse air inhaled persons B-D, get ill, subsequently shed virus waitress sheds Table 2 speaking etc. protesting ""no shirt, shoes, service""? naked, nobody going tell wear something? Everything America permeated race.

Of course wanting wear mask related lack community. lack community related lack community caused multi culturism. 

And numbskull planet idiotic noticing race permeates everything America mean Whites genetically superior? Please god research. Shutting entire businesses .05% death rate completely asinine. wear mask public, way scared thing either. people die due car crashes day covid. current mortality rate even take account many people Covid show symptoms, even tested. I'd rather covid disease. personally know 3 people covid mild symptoms days said big deal. cases end (or they'll asymptomatic). 

This whole fear mongering bullshit insane. partly put media get views revenue. also partly country wants ""that"" country goes everyone else get major flak it. everyone caving hysteria. Usually one day spikes like come prisons employers every employee tested. think find Northeast, people protests wore masks. possible areas we're seeing spikes (LA, maybe?), protestors may lower mask compliance (which would argue lot area's policies overall attitude toward masks). 

Here MA, think people operate assumptions a) virus spreads less readily outdoors, b) masks reduce spread outdoors indoors. actually surprised learn people elsewhere country bother masking outdoors, streets, parks, vast majority people masked. 

Generally, feel kinds people protest trusted obey mask mandates moreso general public. protests people give free masks sanitizer, organizers stress importance getting tested afterwards. Protestors self-selecting group generally sense community understand people shared goal, worry mentality adopted people want go outside recreation.

If would possible strong mask-wearing culture outdoor events, think there's problem letting open. depends lot individual locality's general response coronavirus, there's one-size-fits-all argument. People understand many calories restaurant food processed food. reason taste good use twice oil, butter, salt, sugar would use home. I've underweight whole life time gained noticeable amount weight recent years ate multiple times per week. Plants full water, fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants.... great health, great packing weight. outdoor protests NYC daily month. high levels compliance mask wearing. spike. 

In southern states people believe virus poses threat. densely congregating indoors, without marks, drinking. Rates spiking. 

These behaviors appear equal terms risk. Wear mask loser think much people caring look. 2% death rate... chance.. roman empire survived although huge damages three plague outbreaks death rate 80-90%... NYC pretty transparent testing + results. Testing widely available weeks now. copays waived. white man property Constitution referring you. seemed confident correct last post called delusional. can't say anything new deaths per day current average interesting.

Why go ahead change yesterday's numbers 39 new deaths (not 41 wrote) put today's 24. Tomorrow's around 10, much change last week. **ANY DAY NOW!!!** never happen long president thinks people wear masks don‚Äôt like *He‚Äôs also cop Herd immunity could work, generational strategy. immunity lifelong close it.

The idea would deliberately infect isolate children age mortality long-term consequences lowest. would carry immunity growing up, naturally displacing vulnerable populations immune ones age.

Having go route would deeply humbling. would mean could develop vaccine even across multiple generations, even face widespread death international order weak implement globally effective suppression. time, would nice believe put test could design implement grim plan across generations protect people.

In mind, last part real fantasy herd immunity: work extreme, weak carry even means global death. Pew pew Wear mask NC‚Äôs mask mandate went affect yesterday. Yes, late. least finally happened, unlike states surrounding us. Got haircut early week stanislaus county.

Just wear mask whole thing.

Not sure shutting things down.

Looking populated grocery stories last couple months felt like everyone last week two notice people wearing masks. ? fact state sponsored terrorism Karen. wrong

But said wrong. need know mistake correct it. eyeballs need breathe fuck scousers  Thanks. Yes forgot diet water, hole bucket, left handed fork throw pillows. Libs ruined constant nannying revisionism. Can‚Äôt casinos open- nah. Couldn‚Äôt be. Word. lot family parties going get people sick. like want want pretending consequences bad. Think people die, fact usually eat burgers 4th July. 

""Because that's we've always done"" good reason this. Gen-Xer here... please pass popcorn. Personally, think labeling generations gives society one way dividing tribes point fingers. It‚Äôs bunch horseshit. media need stop glittering generalities. People turn everything conspiracy. Wind coming west? Oh government plot! I'm sure train derailed comes common sense stability. Well said lie Florida alone 60x number new cases country. complete insanity. governor tried flex dick front Cuomo beginning. fucking joke see student history. They're weak, they're subhuman pieces shit.

No need sugarcoat insulting idiots. Thank fully humanity evolving way kind stupidity. Slowly surely Testing places difficult, run out. brother's hospital's supply tests sporadic. People Orange county need wait huge car line forever get tested. shit job one, make tests easily available encourage people get done. Without knowledge can't make good decisions (flip side, obfuscate information state hopes can't blamed outcomes.) Malaysian here. absolute embarrassment think forging data like country whereever think South East Asia means third-world undeveloped. 

We locked early, suffered united nation curb 3 months reaping benefits it. Many countries SEA handled crisis better ""first world"" countries fucking shit lucky, wish could find respirator work. They're sold everywhere look :( Pretty much everyone I've seen protesting mask on. cops tear pepper spray them. won't. husband get looked like we're freaks wearing mask venture out. Yet small texas town exploded cases. went 47 cases (with 32 recoveries) 5/27. Today, 6/27, 392 cases. 255 cases active added last week. 

Yet little block party last night  neighborhood Yo... Actually, can. least, would ok financially rest life. Sadly, life would also considerably shortened. HUGE issue it. also work airline, lucky enough face idiots travelling right now. hand, knowing people government, would definitely ascribe malice knew could get rich. like Charlie entire factory good behavior patience.

He STOLE Fizzy Lifting Drinks! digital thermometer company connects wifi able detect people fevers. think there's lot wiggle room lot activity. think approach along carefully examine contact tracing see transmission taking place react accordingly. think reopening lot stuff restrictions right move. 


But Jesus Almight Fuckboi Christ, bar pretty close worst imaginable setting know virus transmission. entire \*point\* bar confined, multi-hour social contact people disparate households. reason bar exists provide exact activity know worst thing do. enjoy day, i'm honestly sorry feel insulted, thought could handle banter. hear representative Socialstyrelsen say specifically patients respirator: ; two weeks ago; none us know expect Covid

How fuck even remotely true? Seriously, people need move island idiotic existence doesn‚Äôt destroy anyone else Well science believe untill stupid study done.  Yeah obvious many people everyday ask ""what protests? one mentions one main causes spikes? think protests caused lot problems we're seeing right now?"" continue. hospitals cannot handle surge. definitely sarcastic comment. So, ignorant scientific research would rather substitute reality? Cool! Ah see read letter arguments comment section Yeah, also distinct events. protests started big quickly faded, done week two everywhere except liberal cities. would cause blip cases rise drop sustained protest create sustained transmission chains.

Bars, restaurants, etc done opposite people going start feel comfortable last six weeks, create sustained transmission growth instead blip. Actually pretty common people japan Korea wear mask.

River tubing popular. rivers usually cool wide perfect tubing. Lots alcohol involved, too.  Ah yeah, get mean. Thankyou explaining. think death upticks would slower round. know mortality rate largely function age people getting infected. infected people eighties, would kill 10% them. infected people forties, would kill 0.1% them. (I'm trying downplay seriousness, 0.1% still ten times bad traffic accident deaths.) heard major outbreaks nursing homes recently assume better protected now, nursing home deaths made 50%-80% deaths back spring, mortality rates current waves much lower March/April death rates keep up. current pool victims much younger, better testing less adherence control measures, current situation different Wuhan/Italy/Spain/NYC, clear yet deaths/hospitalization situation evolve here. Unless near water. !remindme 1 week exactly smartest snowflakes there. Seriously, stop blaming damn millennials everything. Holy shit, see people every age wearing masks acting like fools regards virus.

I believe least one state trying pass similar legislation already passed it.  gave trying post anything consistent group think r/Coronavirus.

The lock downs sold temporary, flatten curve. resident north east, curve flattened. That's also we're slowing reopening.

It also remains seen mortality rate track new increase infections. Lots not-at-risk people added ""confirmed infection"" pool now, compared early on, testing risk, already hospitalized.

We're currently bit less 2x deaths 2018 flu season, actual mathematical reference. certainly more, could worse, possibly? far seems unlikely death rate go back exponential growth. ""Example' lmao.

Is right? think BMI does? screening tool risk. someone 6 1 gives range 40 pounds healthy BMI range low risk weight related diseases risk. overweight range saying elevated risk compared healthy weight BMI weight related diseases. also less risk people obese BMI range.

Again, 40+ pound range. exceptions everyone internet overweight/obese BMI low BF% basically non-existent women less 8 percent males. situations analogous? I‚Äôm still baffled aren‚Äôt pushing dining outside summer. Shut streets let restaurants use sidewalks, streets parking lots customers. would nice change pace much safer.

Don‚Äôt wear mask outside, keep one put go shopping go work indoors. Keep washing hands don‚Äôt touch face.

Instead, I‚Äôm seeing people hugging, large groups park social distancing buffet type food layouts.

Our health officials great lot trust, wish would lean mask use bit - especially things like public transit.

When experts say that, value them. voiced escalating concern would appear contracted coronavirus insisted steps protect himself, even refuses wear mask public agitates large campaign rallies virus could spread.

He really walking contradiction lol Absolutely. It‚Äôs sensible move that‚Äôs you‚Äôre armed with. ethos lives matter equally. much all... 

The group issue going war, denying healthcare poor, cutting welfare spending etc... can‚Äôt imagine teachers, professors educators going want live place could potentially die permanent damage.. Could possibly see exodus states treating seriously? 

I don‚Äôt even know anymore, country pathetic current state % positive increasing...now around 20% last 7 days. least get sick covid, even though kids catch get sicker million childhood illnesses catch. Eventually, sure. Looking curve CA, it'll next week half. kind straw man. literally postponed reopening 2 days ago kept telling people needed driving virus eradication order re-open.

All rocket scientists would pile say ""no FLATTEN curve"" FLAT FLAT FLAT FLAT that's it. make FLAT reopen like nothing ever happened, virus magically stay level.

Oddly logic incorrect. reopen r(t) increases virus spreads exponentially.

The ""impossible"" task working towards eradication turns path reopening. I‚Äôm pretty sure Donald actually state number one priority got shit it. point basically agree 100% schools = econ. 

I‚Äôm school kids survey democratic vote, they‚Äôre making feel involved process. I‚Äôm sure CDC local districts working regulations. reality isn‚Äôt gonna 100% adherence people gonna best that‚Äôs ask forget Orange county... Oh I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going clusterfuck, get vaccine, people cease problem lol. seriously think almost vulnerable population Lombardy? almost deaths there. South center country relatively cases. I'm California, definitely region dependent. 3 rainy days school year even could fit class time outdoor awning. Thanks, Oh interesting! also misunderstood then, thank clarification. We're truly living 2017 HuffPo headline ""I Don‚Äôt Know Explain Care People"" 6% ok, we've got 3x assays reduction prevalence. Even 10% provides 2x reduction. titled NPR MPR ? fake news people keep talking ? I've blacklisted local business I'd supported since 14 years old owner threw hissy fit, five rolls toilet paper boxes candy shelf started saying convenience store refuse close down.

He sells comic books. even curbside pickup. Facebook everyday telling people physically walk store browse. I‚Äôm surprised all, government bunch headless chickens also average person medically illiterate doesn‚Äôt high school level understanding viruses. lost mind, really still plan schools fall? schools means economy. anyone Washington even going bring up? understand schools state institutions, CDC, HHS, Dept Ed really want give guidance kids‚Äô school handed survey. They‚Äôre really leaving us? don‚Äôt know shit.

Apparently thing matters country stock market well. month ago working Florida commented Reddit shocked lack masks. People packed little gas station store masks distancing. wondering long could last outbreaks started get control. Apparently little less month. said estimate may downvoted oblivion saying this, honestly I‚Äôm sick drama. people resist common sense put there, well- survival fittest intelligent. ""In end""? end looking at? Party boys Way low initial phase. Queens saw 0.3% population die 25% population infected.

It may get closer treatments improving. That‚Äôs one thing don‚Äôt understand ‚ÄúNYC train wreck crowd‚Äù think they‚Äôre gonna see death? You‚Äôve got cases they‚Äôre gonna spiral deaths rate they‚Äôre absolutely going fly NYC‚Äôs numbers - turn pissing contest US country becomes don‚Äôt invest education citizens. politicians brought upon us years bad faith legislation deserve mouth breathers raining down. 

Let hear idiots complaining wearing masks know they‚Äôre responsible silent death country. Sick shit right willfully deny existence virus infected , wish right contaminated people though. security enforce masks? !remind 15 days vaccine going lessen issue virus it‚Äôs going become political issue right away. People aren‚Äôt going get ‚Äúgovernment can‚Äôt tell do‚Äù conspiracy theories. elderly death toll exclusive Sweden. 

True, also extremely high nations failed strategies amounted ""do nothing"" something done. Eventually seems... now, far that. 

Florida appears budget ahead schedule. argument there, who‚Äôs going something it? lungs bad require supplemental oxygen, probably cannula nose already delivering oxygen anyway. really think anyone seriously unable wear mask due medical reasons public, period. can‚Äôt handle mask physically, probably can‚Äôt handle even walking inside grocery store. probably can‚Äôt much physical activity all.. that‚Äôs little masks really impede breathing. N95s would make hard anyone breathe worn correctly, general public wear those. far incapacitated person, perhaps makes sense, even allowed every person cannot remove mask free will, would small number people wouldn‚Äôt huge spread result exemption. That, kids school age ones personally see legitimate reason wear mask. verbally express reluctance wear mask, oxygenation issue you. even many tests American marketing focused individual since least 2010‚Äôs I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs factor. Swiss went bit crazy reopening, surprised see they've even allowed nightclubs reopen soon. sure expected, among last things want resume pandemic.

Overall, however, think Europe fairly decent job trying gradually get businesses back again. Obviously always kind tradeoff. Exactly, adhering set principles, whatever lord savior tells to. Trump 180 mask policy would too. entirely untrue Remindme! 4months YES. never food service clothing retail years various roles. Everyone semester food retail graduate HS. learned classes. Also generally asshole. can't speak Florida live big contributors Texas's numbers Houston, Dallas, Austin. three protest numbers thousands. Houston, particular, 20+ officers worked protests test positive. would seem almost entirely political nature completely put fault reopening none protests probably closer 70/30 terms blame spike. YOLP live part (of life cause get hair eat outback wear mask social distance make hard decision makers want keep people safe people want) Lol obviously never worked advertising Money moves economy payments rent electric well. get saying, it‚Äôs still issue money went dead people many alive people. Please, don‚Äôt behalf... Mono serious long-term health implications: Lmao voted.

Oh yeah! go sub narrative. Definitely them! level delusion denialism cohort impressive. 2019, cancer killed 600K heart disease killed 647k USA. could probably uncross those. pretty lofty claims back source even type logical argument. kinda saying outlandish things without explaining reaching conclusions. ‚ÄúWhen happen became focused rights obligations fellow man woman?‚Äù

1776 Apparently comment posted response yours, one detailing numerous counterexamples ""not peep"", immediately flagged ""too political"" removed, think suffices say claim takes little effort disprove.

Come July 2nd NJ July 6th NYC, we‚Äôre going see surges state. First last state re-open, we‚Äôre going surge. Yes. can. get hypothermia forest, alone, without contact get cold symptoms Mom says can't wear mask long without needing take breathe. Like, half hour long her. conditions aware would make breathing difficult beyond morbidly obese... might explain Americans particular bothered masks, tbh.

Meanwhile I'm wearing mask hours time work short periods comes water, I'm fine. Think might even enjoying winter instead summer right now. I've adjusted noticeable I'm wearing except pop outside, I'm bothering Fake Smile nobody cares. Mom seems think I'm going pass then, dunno, die something. Yes, unfortunately isn‚Äôt November, soon enough IMO, think take time unfuck country. lot unfucking done, unfortunately. besides, lot happened happened despite president‚Äôs wishes, them. Hahah okay you‚Äôre right actually, absolutely line using masks what?

I'm California everyone give fuck anymore sad seeing spikes Karen needs hair nails done get drink bar . doubt it. bet Russia China. Disney seems want open up, reason Disneyland closed California let open. EXACTLY scientist reconcile being's existence ZERO proof aforementioned EVER existed all, according scientific method? Complete shutdown weeks. I‚Äôm DC right now. drove NC. ehhh Dupont Circle area hotel is, everyone masked, even seemingly crazy street people talking themselves. 

Driving VA proper, though, stop WaWa (big mistake) fucking nightmare. thinking ‚Äúwelp, get covid it‚Äôs going stop use restroom‚Äù. Uh Las Vegas casinos opened up? ""me first"" mentality. Never people entitled self-centered. guess cultural/societal shift along social media causing it.  did?
Just need Saudi money back though. Delta committed 40% open seats September. $2000/month? Don‚Äôt ridiculous! would politician‚Äôs rich political donors able afford sweet tax payer money companies money citizens? Blah! Silly Canadian!  Georgia isn‚Äôt far behind...yayyyyyyy! america smoke joint calm little, bro. mean? places like Florida (41% case increase last week) Arizona (41%) Texas (28%) protests dwarfed states like NY (1%) Illinois (4%) Minnesota (8%) Washington (9%) California (22%)? Ah sorry - got wires crossed. Someone else replied another comment masks. inbox reddit. 

Gimme second - documented statements state government. need dig Fireworks inside house! government determine gets money.

Besides big factor - everyone wants free money Agreed. I've driven California Texas back 3 times. takes quite bit longer, I'd problem. serve food normally? backlog negative tests... ended up, know, surprised ""phased in"" dilute percent positives.

After VA combined antibody tests PCR tests, began taking numbers grain salt. think call ‚Äútemporary emergency measures‚Äù something along lines. It‚Äôs normal it‚Äôs insane context. Implying okay insanity pisses people off. shouldn‚Äôt okay it. tolerate shrug think ‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs totally social norm never hug someone again‚Äù causes people say ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù go nothing happening. eventually deal virus. eventually global pandemic completely skewed dishonest mortality rates. rebuttal fact current mortality rate (which already extremely low) even lower shown due many people asymptomatic know virus not. top elderly dying (sure people 40's died well, EXTREMELY rare though) already multiple health issues already. thought credentials needed order read interpret statistics, apparently wrong. Maybe instead getting news echo chamber reddit, go look sources form opinion?

That's great saw 40 year old ventilator, stats completely prove I'm saying disprove everything saying. Shutting economy .05% death rate crazy, you. Cat obviously deep state That's, uh, point phase I. We, licensed staff, getting paid create plans three possibilities. ""I obey orders, I'm American"" types ~~~~generally~~~~ ~~~~kind of~~~~ idiots insist people disobey police orders deserve everything get.

FTFY Literally nobody making argument answers specific question. They're screaming 'rights' have.

You right endanger peoples' lives. Full-stop. sure hope Winston Churchill right about, ""Americans right thing.....""  clearly tried everything else. well referring recovery time WHOLE FUCKING TIME. one stomping saying ""nah definitely recover weeks"". source guarantee people sue publisher later Fellow MAN WOMAN?

Aren't OBLIGATED use non-binary language? isn‚Äôt strong evidence masks indeed help, don‚Äôt know is. Someone mentioned people trigeminal neuralgia suffer unbearable pain wear mask.

So doctors wear face shield. Stopping asymptomatic testing 100% admission defeat, Austin chance getting control symptomatic people getting tested. That‚Äôs actually horrible news Yes actually. groups going around literally ripped peoples masks faces. Interesting Exactly, obviously people protesting didn‚Äôt mask got unlucky caught spread. it‚Äôs dummies wanting go bars restaurants shit refusing wear masks we‚Äôre first place! live Spain dude, got fuck summer. 92f house today. Oh look. wrong. Oh! I‚Äôm US, think we‚Äôve failed massive scale, I‚Äôm really worried it‚Äôs going get worse unless come together country start making different choices. That‚Äôs like read/talk US response. know people knowingly virus &amp; went get haircuts April. I'm probably going get haircut find trustworthy antibody test virus becomes almost nonexistent live (NYC). pretty amazing we‚Äôve seeing reports like people well 100 surviving virus since began. say though make 114 likely something special biology lets avoid dying many ailments people would normally die from. ways isn‚Äôt surprising subset unusually hardy people might also survive COVID-19. Coronavirus never going away. People say delusional people refuse wear masks. Well, starters certainly didnt help trump spent couple months golfing calling liberal hoax. many people kind stupidity small x upper right hand corner bypass Fuck fuck off. Americans want watch disaster movie. Coronavirus serious first becomes major disaster. photo seen even damn cat enough sense wear mask. folks stupid, taking large amounts money industries care making money human life. people talk ""getting money politics"" kind things screaming decades. Covid egregious example, government officials killing millions years ignoring science money. flew ATL handing masks entering TSA checkpoint hand sanitizer stations around. Fortunately seats left right empty, full flight. everyone masks. Good choice. source? 

This study even month ago concludes still open covid relay rules/conditions last three half months. nit surprise her, thought could get away it. He's pretty vocal Trump insane. right infringed upon, exactly? south stuck ways, say? Stay safe, 6yr old too. wanna leave üò¢ Wear masks America FFS! Florida‚Äôs boomer population get bombed. Yes, many were. 

 **When Mask-Wearing Rules 1918 Pandemic Faced drive population mad. baby boomer thing joke. dad troll lol. Millennials hooked adderall etc. point alot people legally hooked drugs take away hell break loose. saying literally 0 people caught coronavirus protests look like: weeks ago minnesota gov said antilockdown protests containing 100s people would potentially push back reopen date? flu seasons nothing new Haircut? what's haircut? feel like gotten haircut since 1999. yay? also means shortages lifesaving drugs using fight virus hospitals get overloaded like New York...they even ran basic things like IV fluid Tylenol....multiple 1000 TX, AZ FL end like NYC I've tried hard avoid person asks this, someone tell Supreme Court ruling Jacobson v. Massachusetts overturned? 123 million would almost 2% world population. We, technically, could used severe PTSD fact something held mouth severely triggering try get running mask. 

However, jerks pull BS. 

Instead, get expensive mask put kind pressure front mouth order avoid severe psychological distress. still found way wear damn mask! Granted would liked mask affordable society issue virus issue.

For every excuse may make solution. reason wear mask. week ago, commenter telling ppl calm tf 80% occupancy ICU beds normal (and, yeah, according study cited, normal peak flu season). Smh then, smh now. COVID go hell, along everyone downplayed seriousness. We're barely second inning. wonder concerned people atmospheric CO2. Probably since it‚Äôs inconvenient give driving AC regional wont work. itll drive people nuts seek open areas..... right infringed told wear mask, exactly? masks required like couple days ago, solid 2-3 weeks virus spreading freely air crowded enclosed space. Yup, early April flood articles ‚Äúthis new normal‚Äù people wearing bubbles heads pool floater skirts saying nobody ever shake hands likely pissed people off. Plus fact strategy presented get us ‚Äúnew temporary normal‚Äù back ‚Äúpretty much normal respect maybe solving societal issues‚Äù. 

I think messaging irreparable damage mask idea. leaders fueled it. Tragedy Commons. time prepare = better. least tell teachers back-up plans distance learning tell ""Hey, we're gonna try in-person, big possibility we'll pivot quickly DL."" way start attacking learning plans home instead sitting dark. Teachers flexible, flexibility character trait, comes INTENSE planning. trusted whatever ideas tossed around, easier least idea expect (e.g. need hear straight mouths leaders).  tragic president dissuading people sort warning. good note.

Yesterday productive conversation someone opposite side political divide, actually gained insight feels way does, AMAZING turn partisan heat bit. Jesus. coming Saturday numbers usually down, too. Unreal recall. article linked today's thread, possibly yesterday's. yep......sooooooo......chip away annually growing population eventually humanity slims trims down..... feel like I‚Äôve watching slow-mo car crash months now. I‚Äôm glad isn‚Äôt deadlier pandemic(fractions percent total population vs double digits like spanish flu Black Death)...humanity could really creek. hope humanity learn lesson. credible study whether protesters wearing masks all? see pictures protests, chosen present particular point-of-view. hear you. going ugly. Id imagine Bogle would even advise moving everything cash. Maybe portion it, cushion? Long term tho, likely full recovery plus some.

Good luck you! Great perspective bruh bruh Hate guy it‚Äôs enough make wonder things like antivax flat earth pushed hard social media butter people specifically reason. mention big oils claims climate change isn‚Äôt real. withdrawal common acceptance science (aka fact) making nervous hell long time now.

If thousands people understand scared 5 outliers news considering many young people infected get seriously ill recover easily. kid fine; reasonable agreed. mom's one gotten decked. young white dude employee.  National Guard vocal stupid masks were.  sewed cloth masks crew moment found COVID. wear masks enforced proper procedures. 

Week two, tries day get employees side. Eventually mild mannered husband told ""You're fucking funny. AOT high risk trying protect everyone else. STFU!"" Everyone heard everyone shamed him. 

It's alot stupid alot courage educate them. Thankfully liquor essential.  No. gets hot everywhere US June July. say ""because understand science"" ""because remained willfully ignorant subject"" rather using silly analogies rights infringed here? pretty much Real Doll. ""The person stay inside"" mean technically kinda do, that's supposed wear contacts time, buuuuut issue *not* masks glasses... üòÇ Let's try least better Trump, please. wonder Japan also labeling every person dies Covid death. Yes. seems it‚Äôs depending people. see many old people social distance wear masks, also see plenty do, plenty middle aged don‚Äôt people age (20) don‚Äôt well.

Give take 1776. Nope, 20M people FL. They'd hit 60% 3.29 years rate. Let's hope vaccine then. spiking people US want use brain power make right decisions around them, instead wants live world exist hence crazy numbers right Everyone person knew got check except parents made 175k combined calls protest. voted him. started strong comparatively speaking, he's better than, say, DeSantis, that's low bar. strong party challenger next election, hesitate vote them.

Look statistics. one fear police walking nearly city street night. Saturday.  Let sink in. Next week numbers normal reporting resumes gonna bad....really fuckin bad. got much one time 1200 effective vaccine never developed coronavirus. would somewhat optimistic US government actual coordinated thought development program collaboration academia, federal government, industry. Instead, shotgun approach throw money pharmaceutical companies hope best. US government woefully negligent ramping testing production masks, pretty easy given resources. Given failure, see one could pin hopes something never done before, expect done totally unrealistic time frame. Asking Supreme Court dismantle last vestiges Obamacare worst pandemic strike planet stupidity. malice plain simple. Haha good stuff. tongue cheek question. italy local lockdowns contact tracing. 10 different areas moment quarantine. appartment buildings DUH Profits People. thing American guns apple pie.

Sorry, didn‚Äôt know technical term lost mind, really still plan schools fall? schools means economy. anyone Washington even going bring up? understand schools state institutions, CDC, HHS, Dept Ed really want give guidance this?

My kids‚Äô school handed survey. They‚Äôre really leaving us? don‚Äôt know shit. that's true. supposed indoors social distancing possible. **In America, replaced slavery 13th amendment, allowing slavery prison** work - like McDonald's uniforms. 2.2 million Americans enslaved, lifers chain gangs farm prisons. Texas zero AC even guards die year heat.

Now, since need slaves, start find them? 2.2 million rooms available year round...

# 'Shocking, Heartbreaking' words ""not hospital, problem""? Exactly. folks devil may care attitude always frame arguments ""Only 1-2 percent die that's mostly old folks"" though nothing ""complete recovery"" ""death"". say ""Came Great White Man-eater, got lousy disease"" can't kick flight? state among infected state u.s numbers spiked recent BLM protest. anti shelter protest, lack enforcement shelter protocol reopening everything early. near capacity Arizona hospitals massive massive spikes daily compared prior shelter during. went highest daily spike prior ending shelter 500 2k now.

Prime example IQ levels people days lol Mattis Distance learning never adequate youngest elementary students though. Many can't work independently, impossible remote teacher meet needs one-on-one way would classroom setting. Kindergartener really struggled (and learned almost nothing new) ""test run.""

If school remote fall, we'll choice hire tutor him. parents option though, could situation really deepens existing inequalities. 'Came beer got Covid.' ""your kid."" 74 million kids US.  Need tourists don‚Äôt need locals. Science data win! Cmon science denying states 10-25% positive rates. Myrtle Beach South Carolina. live medium-sized city lots protests mask ordinance time (Tampa). Guess what‚Äôs happening cases? record, 15-30 positive cases per day 0.5-2% positive weeks re-opened, despite first confirmed cases state. months, things control. Now? much. 

I can‚Äôt blame protests won‚Äôt blame protests, narrative protests don‚Äôt cause spread ridiculous. constantly point cities *that mask rules* ignoring ones didn‚Äôt. Spoiler alert: Urban areas without mask laws slammed new cases young people. can‚Äôt imagine why. 

The virus doesn‚Äôt care you‚Äôre outside large groups. cares behave are. masks difference, that‚Äôs great news that‚Äôs relatively easy fix. Keeping world shut year isn‚Äôt realistic, mitigate cases simply wearing masks? would save lives. feel like sexual activities great vector COVID-19. Mainly need use mouth almost non-penetrative activities, exception hand, dirty. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs unfair,‚Äù Myrtle Beach Mayor Brenda Bethune said. 

You know what's unfair?

People fucking dying disease. can't believe people discussions this. Lives going lost people still ignoring distancing measures going beaches. Japan shut quite bit, wearing masks something see every day colds. Consideration others taught.  Yeah every place different mean look cali thoughy definitely beat gonna come back get overwhelming hospital capacity many places possible, get unnecessary pile bodies. think people developmentally disabled. acting childish hell. Actual children adults answer even want eat vegetables. daddy WH terrible role model. complete total belief him, right lol look daddy stick libs.

I dont think intelligence logic play much role simple lack maturity mental development. wish knew overcome this. 5 dimensional idiocy.

If anything would equally concerned young people catching virus. Yes, survivability higher mobility.

And mobility comes spread. Saturday. know means weekday reporting resumes normal levels. didn‚Äôt read article. ab evidence.

The article points better hypothesis demonstrations increased number people staying home would tried out.

We don‚Äôt know demonstrators got COVID-19, overall numbers increased bartender laid semi-fine dining restaurant OC back March... I‚Äôm gonna everything power return industry. I‚Äôm transferring university I‚Äôm gonna pull loaned, apply grants scholarships. 

The industry fun while, met cool people. takes one Karen/Chad week 7 years... 3 month break beautiful, really see selfish miserable people are. ‚ÄúThe researchers used cell-phone tracking data Safegraph see percentage population leave home big cities protests, compared cities didn‚Äôt protests.

OpenTable numbers don‚Äôt reflect turn-and-churn family-friendly high volume restaurants don‚Äôt reservations seat diners far. ""we listen! protests outdoors, large majority protesters wearing masks. states currently surging opened early, encourage face masks.

Source: age group fine. Around risk groups (70+ one underlying diseases) careful. 

On philosophical note: seeing endless biological life highest good? can't older people say: long life going ask healthcare resources. Part good life also want live unsatisfiable long. Younger generations pay it. 

And also us younger people ask ourself question: living careful? Safetyism, many people might die. part good life taking risks. Risks gives life joy. Without risk health highest good pure biological life. bodily, psychological, culture, art, destroyed life risklessness.

Latter ideas Marli Huijer, Dutch philosopher. It‚Äôll go good ‚ÄúI got crabs Myrtle Beach‚Äù shirt. asymptomatic pass virus? Hey, fogging good chance air passing gaps near nose (the concave spaces either side nose hard close masks).

That's air way in, out.

Your mask/covering still something, stop momentum droplets, could inhales exhales went fabric... 

One way close gap fold short piece wire flexible metal bend hold contours face.

I've heard filling gap, too, extra fabric. I'm taking away folks stuck Vatican city quite time. Heightened anxiety SHOWN CORRELATED virus. 

For anyone experienced anxiety, symptoms often shortness breath, chest tightness, feeling able take full breath. Cruelly, also impactful COVID symptoms. 

There insane amount fear related virus. People getting virus also experiencing high anxiety ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs caused virus ‚Äúregular‚Äù anxiety, don‚Äôt know yet. it‚Äôs entirely possible significant chunk population still experiencing symptoms shortness breath months later dealing anxiety...

And don‚Äôt say lightly. took semester college decade ago thought dying. Constant shortness breath, dizziness, chest pain. ended anxiety. mask isn‚Äôt vaccine... fking delusional.  Someone disagrees, time call racist roughly 8x likely die road accident yet assume still take risk. people going state local leaders let open. opened numbers ‚Äúgood‚Äù, people lax rules. 

My boss told went bar almost one including staff wearing masks. Like really, even staff? excuse. start dating again, first question going whether wore mask without complaining it. I‚Äôm caregiver multiple people family. safety wasn‚Äôt priority aren‚Äôt worth time. don‚Äôt understand people. downplay what's happening there, crazy 57 new cases new wave, 47,000 cases buisness usual ""leadership"". Stark contrast. Paywalled. Saturday. know means week starts again. Probably double number. Covid freedumbs, freedumbs all, even corona! ASSERTION. proof droplet even significant means transmission. science moving toward aerosol quickly article first establishing aerosol kind vector. assumed COVID droplet based primary transmission flu proven aerosol confusing frustrating. 

When Fauci says ""back"" Fall means aerosol based humidity causes drop Summer. Aerosol exists indoor dense crowds Summer weather. Droplet transmission affected humidity explain seasonal peaks. backed Brazil new hot spot. Unfortunately idiots president refuse wear mask even need lockdown everyone wore one. thats exactly whats gonna happen since people refuse Well pretty well known people wearing masks here. plan people stupid also stupid. Thank you! 'doctors' mean worshiped? Nope, look engineers fare marriage market. doesn‚Äôt help issue knowing many people infected I'm disagreeing effectiveness masks, masks Even isn‚Äôt bullshit, ADA allowed request accommodations, disregard safety rules. can‚Äôt wear mask, ask Trader Joe‚Äôs pick items list bring car, reasonable accommodation. can‚Äôt demand let store without mask. So, number infection rate 2-3 weeks ago. Ahhhhhh Jeff County. surprised. live NYC easy see virus spread along certain transit lines.

How spreading place like Florida? US, 2 quick google searches would show multiple places tried shit country figured mass testing. countries making sure need it.

We test 1/500 population per day. infection rate exceeds fraction (say, 10% positivity), testing longer helpful either containment mitigation remaining infections. contact tracers wait days results, none contact tracing effective.

In countries able focus testing one place hard-hit area. states too, since federal testing cannot nationwide. states would stupid give tests away states, since one needs testing keep whatever economy running. Oh Disney reopening lol hit single day record Oregon 277 Oh absolutely, unfortunately, probably many nut jobs Florida, haven‚Äôt broadcast them. 

But definitely see twitter replies posts governor various public officials. kind central guiding organization

some kind central authority country. like leader figure country. something like existed. guys weird disaster fetish sub heart hurts lose. 

We entered business thinking would stepping stone owning franchise like Panera Bread. Instead, fell love. three us - husband, son, me. lost church friends normal friends first year. customers became tribe. 

Our customers extremely diverse black card rich Amazon warehouse poor. Every nationality, every sexual identity, every political demographic passes door shares coffee us. know goes church, affair, really needs hug. 

My employees solid rich kids college teen moms sleeping car. employees addicts, pastors, murderers, oddballs.  customers see AOT's kick ass crew. lost one tormented soul heroin years back. carry lose close heart. think every day use death main motivation.

The thought someone getting sick worked ate place causes daily anxiety.  rotating staff curbside enough? making wise decisions since real guidelines? enough protect everyone? more? help customers used cafe lonely? 

Owners, especially restaurant owners, special breed. True, plenty knuckleheads huge chunck like us. Folks love nurturing providing.  Owners understand real needs community.  Owners plan worse, expect even worse, pleasantly surprised still grinding.

I know next venture successful. make type call, one million. wish nothing mad success dear friend. Forgot can't make jokes online Might worth seeking antibody testing it‚Äôs accessible afford way Kingston 400 new cases. chief medical officer predicting 30. 

You may thinking number rope served salon outbreak started. 400 positives would mean nearly 100% clientele two weeks infected. 

Lots learn spike sure, it‚Äôs comparable US all. Contact tracing identified hotspot source within days 3 new cases. That‚Äôs possible low numbers Ontario right Inb4 add 100,000 cases one day. can't national shaming TV? Show countries closed did. Must protests 

They lockdown Thanks, :P

I worked salon near hotspots lockdown. ironically always wore mask work years, too.  nation facing consequences science denial, hyper partisan political footballing pandemic, lack common sense compassion neighbors countrymen. arguments same
""we dont conclusive proof yet, therefore doesnt can't exist""

There none indicated YET 
but Sars-COV-1 ... risks rushing Literally always.

That‚Äôs people get cooked ovens tiny amounts people owned everything rest slaves literally human history.

I cannot stand people pretend care neighbours comfort. fucking don‚Äôt. wear mask family don‚Äôt get sick step bum sleeping piss street don‚Äôt give fuck. easier ever us socially interact crisis. People can‚Äôt patient. seeing friends in-person first world problem. What‚Äôs phrase everyone using March? Physically distanced, socially connected. Jeez fucking really? Interesting senate benefits (that pay for) don‚Äôt want us guess 30 years ago political structure 300 years ago means thing. Glad Hogan getting praised deserves. He's seen mask early on. Even interviews. Going safer finding covid infection 5 years blood clots run everywhere. saw post couple months back think hit nail right head perspective towards freedom. Here, ""freedom to"" elsewhere ""freedom from"". people focused perceived ability whatever want, they're gonna shitty someone says they're irresponsible cut out. like telling child can't play toy while. Fucking temper tantrum. one buddy whole mask thing want wear it. He's isolating vulnerable family members, though. concerned wellbeing strangers.

Side effect lonely large uncaring city, guess.  It‚Äôs 2020. may seen temporary drawback keeping distance learning place longer may seen gift decade less climate change keeping us homes. important us learn distance learning effectively 2 month test run last school year, really hit hard identifying weak spots. We‚Äôre moving toward future we‚Äôll transition distance learning in-person learning relative frequency anyway. Thank you. really appreciate it. well Agree points. 

States NE show major dampening effects high proportion recovered folks (burning w/ aid masks/isolation) true herd immunity, hugely important either way. number scientists postulated significant chunk population may natural immunity cross-reactive cells coronaviruses. reality nobody knows point.

It seems quite likely FL soon reach NYC-like prevalence fade out. think next month give us great feel effects empirically (in particular, major NE cities open back up, see major resurgence?).

One major benefit let-it-rip period like may old/immunocompromised feasibly hunker died down. pre-vaccine herd immunity inevitable (which seems likely rebellious places like FL), approach could end saving many lives (counterintuitively) vulnerable protect themselves. without even considering massive economic/health effects lockdown. Mask wearing social distancing definitely protest specific. Seems many protests diligent not. Let‚Äôs real admit protests aid transmission. Don‚Äôt downvote truth, acknowledge importance cause outweighed risk. RNC convention coming,

North Carolina really dodged bullet. Also Florida: open schools 6 weeks. Ah, ok. get worldview now. Thanks explaining. 10 million total cases 4billion people 400k dead.....not bad cases surging even area bars closed protests. like adults do.  Herd immunity could work

How many people want sacrifice lives future generations? Immunity need lifelong. something endemic exposed often, immunity waning, completely gone. get mild form illness. Thinking kids tend badly this, maybe that's happen, everyone gets kids becomes another version cold get every often.  127,973 lives sadly - roughly 42 9/11's.  immunity life long, which, given Coronavirus, likely case, herd immunity patently impossible.

M'lady January 20th, 1981  Wow. ‚Äúin touch‚Äù population Anderson Cooper, check link watch interview would known. I‚Äôm SoCal, guess I‚Äôm tune news here. thought were, using Disneyworld test case.

But I‚Äôm also date, apparently.

I‚Äôm hoping reconsider new spikes cases FL. here. Vietnam November coming back USA holidays little travel decided stay foolishly thought would safer pandemic. I'm isolation Arizona Vietnam pretty much open (domestic) business.   Florida Gotham City Bane, neutron bomb, triggerman ""Gotham's newest state resident"" (hint: guy technically can't house lives). Shaming people isn‚Äôt changing mind.

The goal stopping people public without mask. people ashamed afraid possible non-violent confrontation, that‚Äôs win. That‚Äôs needs get done. 

They might believe even god given right American walk stope without mask. afraid/ashamed it, don‚Äôt really care what‚Äôs heart. imagine panic terrorist attack every day killed 700 people, terrorists specifically targeted old young causing long term health risks random numbers left.

They'd throw much money problem. read least two articles stated case. implies people crowd go parties bars keep social distancing wear masks. sure much impacts open space offices acs well. Non-paywall version: 20th January 2017. predictions deaths/day 2 weeks now? deaths continue decrease level change anything think surge cases? 6% high pool testing. test positive rates 6% would expect positive pool combine 12 samples. 12 either ask come back in, binary search.

Obviously goal pool testing testing overall hopefully see drop positive rate, incentive healthy people able isolate participate pool testing? Confirming already suspect (that infected) little give confidence go society interact others still many active cases. mean people actually get qualify Fuck you. wished death upon me. protesting blm ok right Sounds like are, rural areas hold outs. sucks. think circumstances go full disposable respiratory mask.

Jump ship, fun ! 12 year old, mid March got slight cough two days went away, got progressively tired. came sore throat, brief hours fever, super congested sinuses, terrible headache (she said hair hurt) dizziness/nausea. pink eye (in one eye), ruptured eardrum, vertigo severe couldn‚Äôt walk. doctors kept saying vertigo ear infection, vertigo started eardrum ruptured. course tests except hospitalized people intubated. within one day, poof, better. woke completely fine 12 hours vertigo peaked. congestion, vertigo, starving. fine since.

I kept telling ear infection, sinus infection, one eye pink eye, dizziness, vertigo Covid symptoms. bizarre illness.

I‚Äôve asked doctor antibody tests multiple times health plan says antibody tests useless won‚Äôt pay them. wouldn‚Äôt. person stay inside avoid maskless people. I've given wearing glasses mask try best without them. hate wearing masks much anybody, right thing want part get pandemic quickly can. saddens see many fellow countrymen think little fellow man can't bothered cover nose mouth public. think shows weak underpinnings community US see countries like Japan adapt overcome without missing beat, really think need reassess become nation. example societies aspired be, seems we're becoming something entirely opposite - example be. Kinda late conversation, yeah, pretty happy government, especially lookin countries like US, Russia, China, etc. I'm betting admitted lying, 'mis-informed', lying masks efficacy.

I used work financial aid university, know several former coworkers mentioned university suspending requirements making accommodations students regard financial aid. also understand many universities flexible deferred-enrollment policies, perhaps make appeal. Good luck. hold truths self evident...that sovcits dipshits. No. lockdowns response virus. Ergo, virus problem. I'm trying reason understand me. I'm simply going let afraid it. terrified something, make poor decisions. Fear paralyzing, causes things like needlessly lock entire country instead exploring proven options like mask mandates (and enforce them)  Calm down. Sweden look awful foolish now. It‚Äôs shame personally lot desire visit one day.  judge probably redditor. Governor corrupt. Acton still advising governor even though resigned department position. Apparently six feet social distancing intended militant training civilians üôÑ China doesn‚Äôt test. Period. USA highest numbers actually integrity test people. countries like Japan China exceedingly low numbers complete utter bullshit. We're four them.

They're Marxist organization. Fuck cocksuckers. Tens thousands innocents going due them. Less 5k 10 million confirmed globally. never understood lack stockpile.

I'm pretty sure best minds Pentagon writing playbooks ""if Soviets weaponize flu"" since 1950. Presumably sometime around 2003, retitled ""what ~~Saddam Hussein~~ Al-Queda gets germ warfare product"". Page 1 almost certainly ""have stockpile 800 bazillion masks ready go.""

Considering willingness splash cash number half-baked hypothetical defense products, fact ongoing allocation $2 billion year last six decades building maintaining National PPE Stockpile seems like amazing blind spot. Mostly Nixon Reagan administrations.

When fictional character got said ""Greed good!"" general public laughed lauded sort social visionary, that's started worrying.

That's happened. said political thing. I'm fully aware. ridiculous we're plowing country straight ground election. heartbreaking. Trump alpha?

Trump seems like grade material worth cool billion, nobody invited bought venue invite himself.

I agree wholeheartedly this. pandemic made lose faith humanity. God, people entitled, selfish, rude, *just plain stupid*.

Ok, mind actually providing proposed solution then? people going die protests, people going die parties. 

People getting infected cause number go up,

Number going high causes spike

Also conveniently address fact weeks ago mayors, subreddit probably furious fact anti-lockdown protests happening outside would cause spikes.

People decided kill grandma going protests, simple sub single contracting virus 'spike' 'surge'. article infected come long-term neuro health issues, discussing anosmia minority may stuck long term. flattened curve. Curbside pickup coupled gradual shift restaurant industry require government assistance. says can‚Äôt afford it, please check drastic levels inequality country certainly suggests funding there. That‚Äôs part solution set, don‚Äôt fight virus ignoring rules...The virus sets parameters. like 100 times  new cases per day not?

I'd say good cooperation levels government. provinces closed borders even Canadians travel non essential.

Very little culture war wearing masks. 
Much smaller demand open economy flattening curve.

Seems paid off. province 95% back normal preview shitshow go across America fall college students return campus. think going see +3000 new cases daily states next 2 weeks. Honestly masks mandated forever, even pandemic. right thing do. Fuck vanity male fragility. hit something saying, one reconcile telling everyone personal responsibility, incapable fulfilling wearing mask, actively agitating practice? mean Phoenix protests entire week blowing here.

Obama said trump private.

All stupid shit Trump says actually secret Obama quotes. thought everybody knew this. Judging experience working retail restaurants younger imagine combination of:

-The general public selfish assholes whatever feel like get away with, lot.

-The business owners wanting piss said customers let get away lot.

-Employees giving damn, seriously getting paid enough deal peoples shit police.

I envy anybody working service industry now. order food delivery, tip delivery people little extra. Times tough. Remember back India cases one knew weren‚Äôt getting hit harder Hey that's first gold, thanks, startled humbled.  Women whatever want bodies. mean free consequences ending human life. Florida failed state. Sorry, irrelevant? mean street justice? arrest reckless endagerment Leprechaun's immune Covid-19. people want badly blame spikes protests. current president needs give current stance masks happen.

Very unlikely voluntarily... friends inside, yes. really see comparison, either; agreeing you. Yeah, oxford vaccine based past coronavirus vaccine, already tested shown safe. tweak slightly make effetive covid

 researchers able move swiftly already developed vaccine candidate Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), virulent respiratory disease caused another member coronavirus family. Last year showed vaccine safe people prompts immune response lasts least year. January, group began adapting technique create vaccine SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus responsible COVID-19.

  One best articles I‚Äôve read lol, age well all, like floridas population won‚Äôt aging well get sick. I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs still soon say. Italy letting everyone EU (Sweden included) Europeans countries (like Uk) without imposing 14 days quarantine many either letting forcing tourist quarantine. idea could happen US tho, situation drastically different. Anyone wearing mask biological terrorist could potentially kill mother, that's see point. 100% agree you, treated like criminals. Oh well, guess economist good enough me. need provide supporting evidence plan. already going wear mask, government requires wear mask, lost nothing. sacrificed nothing. 

If going wear mask, government tells wear mask, lost ability endanger fellow citizens. 

In neither case lost something value, extent loss exists temporary. Arizona 100 new cases today week ago. Deaths flat 17 days, 1k Texas hospitalizations surging 22 longer according headlines. 

Stay safe. Never said that, said likely didn‚Äôt cause exponential spread. flailing you‚Äôve called out. \*\*\*ZOOMERS  Apparently lung nerve damages possible. also remember reading possible male infertility back February. even said let‚Äôs [‚Äútake away away firearms first go peep people claim fight individual freedoms. Wow interesting watching rationalize it. medical field?

What we're war government tells everyone worry, need guns ammo, resulting deaths? Thats apt analogy situation. wut lol I‚Äôm trying hardest get pumped upcoming school year, feel like need speech someone like William Wallace get back there... Great counter argument u/NewSill valid point. 

Actually u/NewSill brings really valid point 'rights' black white. Like right pay employee 2.20$ hour? right spray paint abandoned buildings? right building vandalized? Sometimes vague freedoms contradict. kind agree, although 'right' taken away forcing us wear certain things public, actually preserves freedom go public all, public without getting infected. complex issue doubt, case could made even though small infringement, justified might even create freedoms lockdown period. would hope laws permanent. Biggest load bullshit I've seen year. One think people wear oxygen masks time specific lung conditions. Granted they're last people leaving homes right anyway. No, wasn't. find zero evidence Obama ever saying this. Fuck off. Gingrich cronies Vlad Tepes'd.

CMV. India fuckin' babas. Every tom, dick Harry trying make buck two pandemic backs vulnerable. someone Texas, exist I‚Äôve seen people wearing Okay.

So what's solution?

Answer question. every person attended protest infected. Take instance Los Angeles county. currently around 90,000 active cases. Sure, probably reported, going reported numbers. roughly 10M people living LA. means 1 every 111 people infected. 30,000 protest, around 270 infected spreading disease. infects 10 people even, 2,700 people infected protest. 2,700, 80% even realize sick. 540 feel symptoms, perhaps 3 4 get tested one feel sick sick. would occur one two weeks after, seem like big jump spread multiple days. time, would spread disease people would repeat cycle. take month see real effects 3rd 4th generation numbers show surge opposed first generation. starting see surge states protested.

We going feel protests, states reopened early starting feel effects 3+ generation spread. ""wait two weeks"" starting smaller pool.  Stimulus checks several months actually equivalent printing unlimited amounts money destroy economy, that's true. saw picture nba player playing tennis said tested positive days ago. looooooong way go. Exactly. nothing other. voting right politicians instead ones pro 2A important. 

Candidate running campaign promotes cheap healthcare funding education, wants make background checks extensive.

Candidate B wants cut funding many public works, pro 2A.

Who vote for? bring up? what's point saying ""He's shit. Yeah, technically ""can"", mean, really helpful. Like, can't blame blister getting bigger, blame source problem

ty admitting ur well rule notion mass gatherings literally lockdown. Like, different levels lockdown. Fuck, got comment, dissapointed got you. Lol

like said, mass gatherings still lock down

don't really understand post, random rambling spot permanent damage even though duration relatively short already acting like green light.. Disneyland changed plans governor said they‚Äôd changing opening requirements. governor never something like that. We‚Äôre headed straight cliff Desantis thrilled. HCQ bad man. good we're placing bets I'll say no. become entrenched identity politics right. They'll wheeze ""fake news"" last breath coming fluid-filled lungs ever admitting anyone left correct anything. know healthy 28 year old prior health complications died. dad posted Facebook couple days Father‚Äôs Day. need happen.. allowed? Also NJ grocery stores, masks mandatory, thought everywhere still? teacher new hot spot city, I‚Äôm afraid choose poverty giving career keep health. seen economy work without everyone complying masks. I‚Äôm going allow guinea pig lot new outbreaks pile tell state tried, shut again. also don‚Äôt think enough teachers willing come back. 

I don‚Äôt know Iowa‚Äôs numbers, certainly get cases control enough expect teachers even show (and provide PPE). sacrifice put fucking mask selfish losers That's irrelevant many us already holding public offices.

But importantly, getting ""boomers"" nothing else older millenials grew slightly different world. There's genetical shift, evolutionary leap human species. us millenials born 1950s like boomers were, we'd behave same. 

The problems we're facing deeper one generation humans ""evil"". We're dealing issues caused humanity whole able think long term. Boomers cause this. wearing Hawaiian shirt? Kayfabe higher. kidding? NYC thousands thousands protestors across 5 boroughs. Times Square alone 50k one event. college town 60k people 4k come out. 60 total cases right weeks later bars serving outdoors restaurants 50 percent. Everyone wearing masks though. No, said careful handling packaging. so? people want 15 minutes fame, even cost everyone else's life. Found conspiracy theorist Well thing happened seat belts established. still needs enforced law. AA blew money share buybacks. deserve go under. easy certify youre asymptomatic Welcome club Texas. Florida. exactly. fiance constantly telling parents(boomers) wear masks. keep reposting masks dont work nonsense facebook. According logic public nudity laws. business owners right? else would put profits life? Message representatives let know ones put us mess refusing act re-election depends putting working class americans ahead corporations once. extensive cleaning initiatives, face mask requirements extension waivers customers,"" said Ross Feinstein, spokesman Fort Worth, Texas-based airline. ""That's reasoning ultimately feel safe prudent lift restrictions July 1.""

Translation: give fuck people's lives go bankrupt Boomers think anyone younger fuckin millennials. Boomers zoomers fueling spread. Millennials gen x sensible.  still wear mask stay 6 feet apart. I'm gonna go too. Oddly specific description. perchance fuckwit president mind? worst shape financially years blowing money share buybacks. CEO's shareholders DGAF. Everyone Texas thinks fucking moron governor Abbott, good job sucking 1 job asshole. Oh fuck. It‚Äôs reallyyou, heard call! 

‚úãüòßü§ö *bows down* think masks effective, concerns. I'm extremely handsome interesting talk to, people tend notice latter distracted former. Excuse what? curve certainly flattened. moment yes look pretty graph right see something says otherwise.

And right, people panicking disease correct go. would solved that? Probably pandemic response team government politicize global pandemic. 

The orders continue real threat. Swine flue killed 250k people GLOBALLY. Corona Virus last 5 months? Documented almost half million. **And that's including numbers countries fudged deaths caused covid-19 atteibuted pneumonia.**

And cool. Young healthy people survive disease. fuck everyone else high risk right? Like young people suffer asthma? kids who's parents 45+ could die? people 50+, still contribute society much offer deserve live much 'young healthy people' right?

Final statement: Disease panic dangerous yes. can't go around pretending pandemics never exist modern society succumb disease. people taken seriously start, society already developed concept wearing masks social stigma part life, competent government immediately tackled issues quelled populace instead politicizing death disease, guarantee we'd better place. Wearing masks, social distancing washing hands issue moot practice, honestly best world wide fact many country can't even adults simple concept are.

Please downplay disease. panic downplay it. Yep, Coronavirus actively targets countries without socialized healthcare.

COVID-19 deaths went 40% since then, US probably currently low excess. say  That‚Äôs reported Michigan yesterday last days. context difference completely semantic.

OK great, indications cases month six weeks ago marched towards reopen championing flattening case curve. think record numbers cases mean hospital death rates line? Also oh yeah, hospitalizations *already* coming record rates along cases certain states. love god please stop downplaying thing Convenient put blame socially perceived vice, bars bar patrons. politician end. Ever dodging responsibility. Less testing, less cases. can't believe many morons form opinions based absolutely data refuse change mind presented evidence contrary, are. Well sheer volume cheeezits bought last three months, I'm gonna say...no. hitting younger people too, long state testing symptomatic people. UK drifts towards US model much, Scottish independence becomes inevitable. TX AZ overwhelmed.

People like America fucked Dude, weeks recycled comments doomers fear mongers. I'm sorry lack ability show concern worry this, make right. Worry feel right. Less people like discuss current trends.

We eventually get this. taking hell lot longer usually want people elected officials mindset. 

Much love. Make sure send ballot dieing. vote grave anyways. GLAD LIVE CHINA literally soldered doors shut apartments buildings.

 

What great country straight shooter scientist like Dr. Michael Osterholm lay scientific evidence cloth masks prevent 3% virus filtration. Since viral load important, cloth masks NOTHING.

Do wear one? Yes, courtesy think helps, suportive want masks mandated. late. can't undo anything. gonna get lot worse. LOT.

Change state motto death Texas. might aware depression works want save economy 33.000 people? lives going impact economy? Even old, non-working people (it's not) still buying stuff, right? removed. one recognizes actually good thing?

We utterly unprepared test virus. March South Korea mobile testing stations nearly instant response times.

We far behind actual developed nations took us nearly 4 months get decent tests place start testing population.

The numbers likely back March April May testing ramped significantly positive test reports.

Again, actually good since get real data outbreak come plan contain it.

The worst part even know it. say that? 
The timing couldn‚Äôt worse. 
Maybe don‚Äôt understand badly COVID going fuck America. Let tell you. 

Continue protest within year, half America without job. currently 60 million unemployed.

Millions going infected. die hospitals overloaded. 

There million dead virus alone. including people die able get treated regular medical needs. 

Those survive heavily debt, work without help unemployment ran months ago government doesn‚Äôt give send help. You‚Äôll see massive spike suicides. 

You tell sounds important respecting Social distancing wearing masks protest? Wasn‚Äôt informative. mean difference wearing mask 95% population wearing masks 33k lives saved? don‚Äôt think so. projection 60% wore masks. 30%? exhaled coronavirus droplets get lungs, longer applies. I'm pretty sure it. Pounding headache 3 days, slightly feverish night, take deep breath cant hold it, eyes burning.

Shit I'm jealous North Koreans rn everyone would‚Äôve stayed quarantined 3 weeks would outdoors environment cotton bandana neck gaiter ok you‚Äôre around people. 

For prolonged indoor use actual mask. tried vaccinating America instead running around Africa confused thing dad WV. quarantined 5 days leaving Philly kept thermometer mouth. county 55 total cases. Like, ever.  still write mask everywhere. locals looked weird lot. Nobody wore mask. 30 countries less 500K inhabitants. That's almost 1/6th countries lmao (obviously they're small still) deserve vote. 

Look much ppe needed healthcare workers knowingly exposed virus day long. appears work well, still some, few, slip get sick. 

Any face covering better none. Anything limits direct exposure better nothing. pretty nice tents moment, al fresco dining, al fresco schooling, etc. 

But fuck like November? Basically boils infectious it‚Äôs rural places somehow safer.

The virus spread people literally carrying point point B.

If, nature rural, many people travel NYC (and area) ‚Äúpoint B‚Äù takes time virus gain ground.

But does, exponential growth rates hit. people STILL shocked. know sub hates positive news, average deaths per case significantly lower back April, almost three fold. phenomena occurring globally. Facts clear, it‚Äôs way couple weeks lot whole ‚Äúkids don‚Äôt get spread somehow‚Äù balo comes Sweden‚Äôs Ludvigson basically set course disaster.  turns school outbreaks predictable predictably kill adults exposed infected kids.   scan Swedish newspapers makes clear school outbreaks occurred. town Skellefte√•, [**a teacher died 18 76 staff tested school 500 students preschool ninth grade. school closed 2 weeks many staff sick, students tested virus. Uppsala, staff protested school officials, [**citing patient privacy declined notify families staff teacher tested positive. contact tracing done school. [**least two staff members schools schools remained open one attempted trace spread disease there. asked cases, Ludvigsson said unaware them. respond query whether would amend review article include them. thank BLM protesters. 

Do anything back feelings?

I made claim anything, looking sources claim. sure downvoted.

From ...measured blood oxygen saturation case, instinct concern. appearance expected close normal (100%). 75% ‚Äì level barely compatible conscious. 

I would venture suggest low O2 sat much symptom.

What article say ""People without typical symptoms pneumonia still lung damage"", that's exciting, it?   **47,341**

A back, case numbers first started track upwards US, said 50k 4th July. looks like I'm going days adrift.

The point date every day date states delayed reimposing lockdown (a real one time) things would getting exponentially worse - see sign state governors waking horror done.

The rise new cases per day back March. mid March early April, US went essentially zero 35k new cases per day. early July expecting 60k new cases per day, 100k new cases per day late July. cases, easier infection, exponential bites quick.

States need lock - $10k fine mask public, $10k groups people 4, businesses working home shops open. I'd closing state borders allowing movement - helps reward done work allowing infected undo efforts. \- still number people die covid every day, longer excess mortality. people die Sweden week corresponding period previous years. 

I see Tegnell doubling lies. seems desperation starting show. hoped ""herd immunity"" arrive longer goes worse decision making beginning epidemic appears be.

I've pointed before, daily deaths Sweden 6.9% 2015-2019 average January 1 week COVID-19 started killing people Sweden.

So even number deaths dropped 5-year average (and latest stats released Statistics Sweden say haven't) would still higher mortality averaging epidemic. Tegnell intelligent man... knows this. either mistaken intelligence, intentionally deceptive.  It‚Äôs spelled Gob We‚Äôre not. article doesn‚Äôt assume reporter caught rally, article suggests reporter asymptomatic spreading rally. swift decisive action, messing around  KNOW half youngsters seeing parents aunts grandparents last weeks. 

So, give month. 

All hope rumours virus mutated something less deadly true. one point figure groups people push whatever limitations extreme. delaying inevitable lockdown  Unfortunately, testing COVID-19 treatment medical assistance. make matters worse testing facilities massive lineups average 5 hour wait time. people would avoid unless they're ill. Every aspect COVID-19 testing treatment needs free protect everyone. treat individuals, they're going expose others virus. lasts 3 months, people getting infected already it.  Well rooms staff ppe supplies. Plus moving patients needed. moved surge line remain network matter end up.  work, testing asymptomatic people? frequently planning go? haters hating... 

Europe see spikes too, maintain least testing capacity couple weeks ago. stupid cunt. angry Tr ump supporters rallying streets haircut. nothing race. fault much larger percentage POCs low intelligence hundred Tru mp supporters would also gather streets protest.

Very interesting study talk Tr ump supporters rallying all, despite thing media ripping spreading disease going outside.

You wrong, plain simple. loud minority always dangerous They're dying take masks. Yeah seriously. recent West Palm town hall meeting clearly shows they‚Äôve got this, what‚Äôs d00mer bullshit? everyone beliefs you. comments get nuked? sound smart 13 year old. 

So either good cut good fooling us. lol Ok, set straw men there. Yes worry car accidents (and deaths caused pollution), spout anyone listen. Yes, worry poverty, that's donate AMF. fuckin come like know anything try call ignorance especially address first fuckin point. simply inconvenienced faced consequences yet, cognitive dissonance allows give fuck yet. Hope goes well ya. think people really cluing alcohol affects spread. Drunk people coronavirus volcanoes. stupid cunt admitting he's testing keep numbers down? Sounds like real stable genius makes angry. sister nurse four weeks giving birth first child. would never occur *not* work pandemic, even though could. she‚Äôs badass risking take care others jackasses don‚Äôt want wear mask maintain social distance going end hospital, exposing her, stupid shitty opinions. Especially since 0 evidence protests caused seeing. question get window. lmaoooooo read dude trust Sure hell would help process. solve anything; thank world scientists states like New York seem relatively well although there's always possibility things start get worse again.

Overall though, yes, would fucking embarrassed American, like OP said.

I'm Australia (not Victoria) think US (and countries) proof handled badly. Let's hope get worse again. hospitalization rate? Testing greatly expanded, people would sick enough get test couple months ago (or need doctor‚Äôs care) getting tested now.

Is number tests per positive changing?  Yes, easy mistake make. list footnote, even incorrect. weighted properly change testing volume.

At end day, people writing press releases still humana med make mistakes. perfect mean they're still best chance pandemic. known ""Whoops"" period. least world knows magic line is. (The world actually already knew line was, whole WWII fiasco all, bit slow catch on). truly asking man either lying extremely clueless, either way unfit office. bastard tough? heat kill it? motherfucker invincible?

It‚Äôs retrovirus, dude. It‚Äôs nanobot wants turn human tissue copies itself. Sounds like another nail coffin. someone made movie years ago depicting everything happens now, would total flop people would find unrealistic. state reasonable plan I‚Äôm comfortable least trying out. Like everything else that‚Äôs opening, need protective measures place, see goes. 

You can‚Äôt open bars restaurants even try open schools. That‚Äôs failure priorities. Well, duh, right? sucks people stayed home. especially healthcare workers, absolute disrespect people working frontlines. selfish short term gratification general disregard wellbeing others. 

Unless us vs mentally go away can't improve country all. Since change asks people conciderate others... universal healthcare. hope won‚Äôt see saw back April. hope won‚Äôt bad since there‚Äôs testing there‚Äôs knowledge treat it, considering rising continuously past 4 days alarming speed expect deaths. someone warn us, sort expert sort thing. VP said good thing younger people infected. Doctors article say explicitly passing others. one around okay. US population 1918 103 million. It‚Äôs 335 million now. So, extra 12k deaths guesstimated first wave 1918 like 39k deaths now. We‚Äôre 127k Covid deaths now, far worse early 1918.

The second wave fall 1918 195k deaths US, equivalent 633k now. hope come nowhere near that. Agreed. there‚Äôs lot things shouldn‚Äôt opening back including bars. Figuring childcare hurdle sure. Lots families talking ""co-op"" families taking turns watching kids.

You go back work, child's teachers, principals, support staff workers, families exposed go back? parents already send sick kids school tylenoled Albuterol mixed water bottles. teachers, already notoriously underpaid undersupporred many communities, compelled put families risk? Symptom:

Germany developed really good app.

We possibility use app, green party said no. (they coalition)

I would prefered app like people would get tested contact infected person.

I first test next week lots friends already test problem like now: ""Nice Im negative lets real party now"".

We wear masks (the gov gave us 55 masks per person) still. Also, half country President don‚Äôt think virus threat, that‚Äôs ones actually believe exists, there‚Äôs Yeah, that's nailed on. Well, rolled dice, every side single pip. Glad Trump told cut back testing virus would go away  trust me, make sense live Houston TMC says hit unsustainable capacity 11 days. I‚Äôve saying days now. Nobody listens. Agreed. live red state positive would win virus. think lose. may ‚Äúfine‚Äù mind.

‚ÄúWE‚Äù Georgia, South, US anything fine. facts lead one think otherwise. yes. get much worse like said. blame either. Eh, NYC spike tells probably super angry protesters.

And frankly dude, every single protest ever people saying ""it's right time"" ""that's that"" ""they're hurting cause"". saved ammo actually mattered. Never sorry speaking truth feel symbolic issues. 

I noticed recently. Facebook friends enraged symbolic things like standing national anthem pledge allegiance. truly awful things like president mocks handicapped person gets solid ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. ""You're putting faith Gods breathing system - turning back it.""

- Florida woman masks bad. person sick coughing, creates large droplets enough virus load create infectious dose contact surfaces.

Most transmission breathing shared air: normal breathing especially talking creates droplets small enough stay suspended, dose builds time point - 30 minutes hours depending air circulation much virus shed - amount inhaled virus crosses infectious dose threshold.

Even larger public schools probably hosed. We're unfortunately situation many universities US enough students. Go figure one. do, wish everyone else passes also.

""Ok we're different culturally Italy"" 

""Well, US like NY happen anywhere else"" 

Meanwhile SarsCov2 gives fuck none that. anything really. spreads anywhere people. Teachers USA screwed best times, so..

Source this? shut Michigan reopen protests, sounds like making 5 days average see spike.

Cases rising two weeks, deaths average stagnant declining. it‚Äôs Texas God plan. Put fucking mask then. Yes Europe badly affected USA. Also European countries (to extent even UK) actually made effort control virus resulting infections going Bidet 2020 Justin Trudeau election slim margin concidentaly theres ''pandemic'' increase popularity approval rate wake sheeple /s actually start evictions, riots make George Floyd protests look like child‚Äôs play 1. Less use mechanical ventilation biggest improvement. cases ARDS caused viral pneumonia, early ventilation better. we've learned due hyper-coagulable states induced severe COVID, ventilation make things worse saved last resort. Instead we're using machines like high-flow nasal cannulae deliver oxygen rich air without intubation
2. We've gotten better separating disease two separate phases, viral phase inflammatory phase, treating differently.
3. viral phase, antiviral remdesivir works ok, great. ok way better nothing.
4. inflammatory phase, we're using corticosteroids (which originally counterindicated) IL-6 inhibitors like tocilizumab supress cytokine release syndrome, ends damage killing people. treatments viral phase improved little, treatments improved lot.
5. We're refining lot supportive treatments. Things like prone-positioning always playbook, lot require trial error figure helps best. Frightened.....

When America, that's when. good ill entire nation built premise selfishness rebellion authority instruction order, spread around world ever since. Sometimes good effects, sometimes, here, good. folk refusing follow mask-wearing orders/guidance exercising individual rights freedoms hard fought for. folk UK flocking beaches last days, right freedom so. Antivaxxers? right freedom. Protestors/BLM/Antifa? right freedom. Pick something... right freedom, hard fought for, indulged upon exactly way hard fought right freedom, decades upon decades upon decades fetishised selfish individuality mild personal sacrifice common goal.

That's mindset turned cult spread around world. problem killer virus give two thirds one quarter one half one percent flying fuck that, need everyone sacrifice little personal liberty little communal safety/security vast, vast majority indoctrinated typical American selfishness happening never happen muh freedums. stupidity many think, stupid folk taught; stubborn selfishness that's ingrained collective consciousness. That's happened, still happening, it'll continue happen learn personal freedoms important thing world, following authority guidance evil default. know oven General rule: defense behavior ""It's right!"" need rethink behavior. As-salamu alayk*ahem* wanna see manager outside means spread day????? Good know we've got humans working it.  No, average R0 growth rate, would take like 85% population achieve herd immunity, perhaps locations right, everyone else stayed home protests. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Texans, got this‚Äù- Governor Abbott reopening press conference April 27th We‚Äôre gonna tough point tbh. Mask smart best can. keep safe. you? incapable? need skilled care facility? silly, virus infect people ignoring precautions good cause. infects people bad wrong. mean, even wears tiny little BLM hat, would never infect them, duh. Modern day Darwinism then. 60, died weeks later virus, potentially made worse anemia recent battle leukemia, CBS Los Angeles reported.

Man.. calling shit covid death  God damn ""testing make us look bad maybe slow testing"" make every American working brain's blood boil. We've recorded much higher percentage deaths cases. Especially beginning, missed ton. know wrestling fake, Covid-19 ain't putting smackdown worldwide. Texas governor anxious kiss orange idiot's ass put state predicament. WH started pushing reopenings seems like day two issued guidelines yet state met guidelines. wear one rest life then. Flu kills 50kper yr states. wear one last yr? Selfish? concerned 50k lives? Shame you. Name state businesses air conditioning. It‚Äôs worth noting asymptomatic means literally symptoms, COVID throat feels kinda weird cough occasionally you‚Äôre asymptomatic.  Right? everyone wore mask, could businesses open people back work. None relevant anything said. redirecting conversation away numbers demonstrate wrong.

Listen. know ""not Covid deaths Covid!"" thing favorite thing many people like say. please think critically one second go look states' *overall* death counts per month versus deaths per month past several years. [It‚Äôs really easy 

""Nationwide, least 107,900 people died usual March 15 May 30. number 20,400 higher official count coronavirus deaths period. Higher-than-normal death rates widespread across country; states reliable data, six show numbers look similar recent years.""

Keep mind people staying homes period, drastically reduced number deaths car crashes, example. 

Just look damn numbers search facts instead believing illogical, anger-inducing dogma conveniently happens fit existing opinions. remember back Michigan like that. literally get tested pharmacy day appointment. feel bad states, remember anxiety felt back March. Stay strong, everyone! ""San Francisco data related protesters tested positive testing sites asking people recently participated demonstrations, city spokesperson Cristina Padilla said.""

I can't imagine stupid you. ever cross mind? people tested positive COVID, doctors ask they've protesting, ask they've restaurants places re-opened.

Everyone thought wearing mask health care professionals essential employees. obvious wearing mask almost completely stops disease tracks thats US getting hid hard cases. Plus reopened slowed curve all. people logic. pick arbitrary bullshit read Facebook believe that? I'm tired intelligence thought going debate! need yell lot rights! /s Thanks info mate. know people downvoting I'm telling honest God truth. government even state owned news BCG vaccination likely help us deal virus better gave people false hope . today another 7210 new cases reported puts South Africa top 2 highest 24 hour growth per capita world third day straight. going get extremely bad here. God way drink home find women online something Works/worked Aus. friends NYC streets FILLED people ‚Äúpatios‚Äù restaurants. seems odd hasn‚Äôt spike yet maybe outdoors really helps think does?  send back daycare. it‚Äôs mostly killing people nursing homes heat going kill it, though. Interesting. Personally love wearing mask. mean really someone social anxieties dream able cover face looked like loon Mass gatherings ok wear mask?

And outside. Yeah. Maybe it‚Äôs burned New York last couple months. places hot spots months ago aren‚Äôt spiking despite opening too. still don‚Äôt know facts transmission I‚Äôm willing bet places didn‚Äôt get hit hard initially thy mostly closed open letting virus spread. federal government likely authority.

Historically, public health powers reside states. best federal government could try pressure make law (similar got every state raise drinking age). country fucking selfish. That's understating it, I'm loss words. Chicago literally surging right average age 30 years younger? Yea don‚Äôt think Florida‚Äôs gonna see 1000 deaths per day. Kind like everyone similar attitude towards people NY NJ? Fuck 'em. Anyone else feel like shit today? Exactly. That's short visits, outdoors! That's way many people gathering pandemic. Nearly 20 % positive. Jesus. remember seeing number high... everyone obsessed end year vaccine, we're developing infrastructure survive years worth pandemic.

We're considering make nursing homes safer although totally achievable outcome.

We're still trying determine we're going send little kids physical location school.

And bad plan things spending planning worst case scenario wishful thinking. NY shut 4,000 cases per day, still increased after. going bad since double resisting full shutdown Social needs thing well. could promise everyone go March 15th October 15th stay home, see family, etc. one else ever die it. people could probably grit teeth bear it. But... one even come close that. one know what's going happen people social needs.

Being lockdown *really* bad mental health even though income it. positive feedback cycle, amplifying worst insecurities. care people. wear mask protect myself. Chicago often Houston. spikes.

Next? Wearing masks already common Japan even covid. College kids Gen Z. Millennials 30+.... fair, LA largest protests also one largest populations. current situation mainly protest issue, numbers much larger. saying contribute (absolutely did), bigger issue people wearing masks daily lives public settings, bars restaurants. Firm brutal failing tell em f'off true, part wears tin foil hat says care government care want old people die mass. 

Think it- elderly people drain resources, die less social security paid out, medicare benefits fulfilled, etc. Trump actively leaning 'masks bad' narrative, even though whole world knows work.

I also think dont focus amount people ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù covid always significant issues due it. ‚ÄúA people.‚Äù It‚Äôs entire country tradition, families friends getting together close contact across counties states.

Bbq random Sunday sister kids? Nnnnnnoooooooopppeeeee standard answer anyway. 1.	 first said don‚Äôt wear masks ‚Äî wouldn‚Äôt help, weren‚Äôt enough go around needed save medical workers.
2.	Masks aren‚Äôt protect wearer, also prevent transmission wearer others.
3.	The mask doesn‚Äôt need fine enough catch virus, fine enough catch water droplets speech coughing ‚Äî that‚Äôs virus gets around ‚Äî normal cloth masks fine. That‚Äôs enough evidence account drastic spike cases. Again, gut feelings vs stats. could say that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going reopening day day bases age ranges. school district's plan split students three groups. choose send kids third group (online study only). choose third group assigned one first two. first Tuesday, Wednesday; second Thursday, Friday. 2 day school week.

Until recently, get tested unless symptomatic screened physician.

Though sadly drooling idiots throw shade us value facts reason. say I've given hope American functional nation... think idea government care safety. live police state... seen videos recently, ever clear.

What happens contract tracing says came contact person corona? Police force mandatory 14 day quarantine disagree met lots lots force Don‚Äôt forget blame game say wasn‚Äôt mass public gatherings protests deliberately ignorant also increase viral load re-breathing viral organisms breathe out.

/s I'm trying say despite record-high amounts cases people still fail see reality help curb infection rates, calling liberal hoax instead. remember shit started China got 81K, everyone like ""holy fuck"". US getting half PER DAY, acting like Biggie bars? Nah, selfish. huge part USA die off. thank people refusing wear mask  No. IFR estimations 0,2 1% depending region. 
Herd immunity requires around 60-80% people getting infected. around 0,3 3 million.

As ""happy medium"" ""medium"" life comes play - get infected could none? kids bring home grandparents? 

""Children resilient"" may sound old - make untrue. Academically, neurotypical students catch up. Students absolutely need peer interaction - one benefits hybrid schedule.

Assuming son starting K next year, he'll learning read. lower grades, direct instruction delivered small-group setting (math groups, leveled guided reading groups, writing conferencing, etc). current guidelines would take away parts day. Whole-group instruction effective learning. much detrimental students' learning also necessary considering proximity required small group instruction. best way replace it? small digital groups distance portion hybrid learning. instruction would in-person learning typically is, current guidelines in-person learning allow all. another benefit hybrid model.

However, due variation incubation periods, better wait till 3 days symptoms onset best accuracy. See research paper: 
reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/gjgst2/variation_in_falsenegative_rate_of_reverse/ American 100% agree. Losing faith humanity maybe it‚Äôs country. Manufacturing errors still happen, especially they‚Äôre rushing get doses though, right? wanna tell every young human 100% healthy? Tell families children died ""flu"". one told stop living, little causious. even care older people? 'll 70 like said stay home that's it? Yes. chosen careless working elderly, yes. employees get fired wearing masks public job work susceptible, good. truth opinion sure. COIVID test positives ONE indicator governing indicator many people want make be. title post NOTHING body article!

So, common, then?  Uuuggggh ok? smart can't pick putting down. Finally, time go herd immunity. fucking first place. still thinks political hoax Talk cheap. Maybe CDC shouldn‚Äôt lied face American people said masks aren‚Äôt effective. Well, American, say ""damn Americans"" tongue falls out. Also, American race, can't ""racists"" comment. 

I'm paying attention, can't speak others.

The proof countries managed control outbreak variety measures, widespread mask usage key component. fairly well known accepted point virus infects airborne vectors. Thus, limiting aerosolized droplets keeping reaching face holes people crucial. 

And still can't believe even argued anyone point... doctor skeptic disease since start; he‚Äôs Fox News saying Pennsylvania reopening slowly; suggesting virus mutated less deadly; maybe he‚Äôs right, maybe fix news viewer, since also booked appearances Channel Texas fucked big time. Smh Way go BLM! Truly making change! Mother fucker trying sides science. side refusing wear masks side saying Lives Matter. Actions speak louder words. .....ow.. wish could read think random jokes echoes things Trump actually said.... x.X Yes countries aren‚Äôt led stupid ones. best man. thoughts Where‚Äôs data there‚Äôs 0 PPE those. Where‚Äôs data people want reopening haircuts

My evidence literally look Memorial Day hotspots see people wearing PPE less people Even ""third-world countries"" better health care system US. Yes, least listen experts. dont insist anything. 

Also Google got spoon feed you. shows power effective propaganda. people watch Fox News consume conservative media machine 24/7. hooked it, like drug. don‚Äôt know it. live Toronto cases entire province 200/day going close 2 weeks. work mall reopened Wednesday see 50/50 people masks on. It‚Äôs extremely infuriating, luckily we‚Äôve provided masks give customers signage saying need one shop. can‚Äôt IMAGINE Florida would literally screaming people guy hoaxer quite time - lives hearing talk, big cheese doodle fan.

Hospitalizations rising - deaths rise soon enough.

And God it‚Äôs Pittsburgh. good news cases low, guy expert beyond me. That‚Äôs pathetic, need forcibly removed premises. Actually hooters shouldn‚Äôt even open. friend go covid. He‚Äôs ok now. bought family masks. hope actually wears now.  is. go store, wear mask safety glasses. put mask wearing 50% town. work place id terrible, people distance all, masks all. extra cleaning though. devil coughed JIZZED virus right mouth tell ya.  Never cuz MuH RiTeS think start proclaiming middle-aged conservative dudes look sooooo sexy masks.  There's magical search engine called Google. literally type curiosity boom pops up. P.s go couple pages get differing opinion. states virus spreading almost uncomfortable outdoors summer people hanging indoors much possible. disagree indoors dangerous, mask enforcement much necessary US *because* people likely indoors.

We ate breakfast place morning, outdoor patio. Thankfully, staff wearing masks. Nothing ever free. comes taxes. What's nice make less therefore pay much taxes able afford essential healthcare. saying free really whole truth. Lets protest 57% cases CA Hispanics/Latinos, make 39% population. 17% case whites, make 37% I'll look that. find hard believe protests zero effect rise cases sheer number people gathering around. coming someone believes protests justified.  He's pulling Brian Kemp LOL. First all, course think woman nuts. anti-vaxxers. right thing, not. I'm right side argument.

But understand gofundme-stuff. American thing? Someone TV newspaper Find way cash it? Surely thousands worthy causes donate money to? Seems like givers feeling good moment, right reading story, helping help needed. Yes, opening us choking demand virus control worst case us business owners. And....here are. Lockdown doesn‚Äôt mean virus disappears. It‚Äôs like test 2 million people 98 percent negative. doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt get virus future, means haven‚Äôt gotten yet exposed yet. takes long time 300 million people exposed. 

Everyone talks lockdown prolong inevitable. Look New Z, virus free got cases celebrated. virus always waiting wait. There‚Äôs never good choice situation US making worse. clear action plan true support American people. 

Trump guys thought could throw money us we‚Äôre hoping would 2-3 months. Unfortunately country 300 million plus takes much longer ‚Äúget it‚Äù statistically. idiots playing even dumber things get worse. truth is, DONT CARE. Good news! 0.1% looted economy long. He's actually not. People especially state government avoiding calling Trump much know action takes hurt them. think irrelevant right now. moving onto thoughts feelings. Please answer question continue. Learning part sentence predicate... adverbs, adjectives, vocabulary.. crap like answer standardized tests. Narrator: ‚ÄòBut didnt‚Äô continue watch Fox News turn brain mush üòÇ typical high school kid fashion, ignore went tens thousands streets weeks social distancing, protesting, new spike lines perfectly incubation period. 

StayWoke Fuck you, worse war independence. neverending slaughter slavery targeted ethnic groups generations now. 

You're probably someone benefited structure privilege saying now's time. know what? 

This particular flashpoint yielded results promising dividends time find, apply mass direct action system participate get results advantageous positions. Like less stability poly minority movement overtake majority run system.  rate increase doubt people laughing, wheezing possibly. Absolutely terrified folks. misunderstood sorry.

You admit great way wielding influence.

No really buy philantropy devolve nefarious things.

Philantropy exists thousands years yes influence. Look mother teresa vatican.

Philantropy serve perfect excuse purposes.

What saying vigilant whenever somebody looking best interests life always case.

Not always malintent also people savior dream urge help notoriously bad actually looking interests.

What Bill Gates prefers life regular people prefer life.

I scared death inevitability. fear well meaning billionaires marginalizing trivializing civil liberties save us minor threat.

Bill Gates talks social distancing normal reasonable thing. half population prefer virus. know do. liability one face bringing virus work refuse wear masks outside work? Nursing homes lockdown country since March/April, way got staff. need stop testing cause death too. Got it. thing. one hand bars nightclubs open way pandemic. hand governments take care owners staff businesses. able open business extremely harsh would probably bankrupt majority them. cannot pivot takeaway anything online, really absolutely nothing situation. would require military go along, seen far that's going happen. think scariest part situation. But, half-assed response going fail, huge number people say science failed. jinx us... Maybe that's case patients. said, majority lasting issues. making sound like every recovered COVID-19 patient lifelong lung problems, simply false. 99% get virus mild asymptomatic case. Less 1% serious case -- elderly people underlying conditions. Maybe handful people develop weakened lungs.

Statistically, chance significant. virus terrible, there's much fearmongering misinformation going around, that's even contagious virus itself. Another one St. Louis area, oldest supposed start 1st grade, new district year. I‚Äôve heard basically nothing regards schools plan. I‚Äôm reassured right now. said going sue feel deserves GoFundMe donations Lenon received. She‚Äôs suing slander defamation. She‚Äôs one took picture posted story online! way hell she‚Äôs getting cent GoFundMe donations. fucking chance. horrible excuse human being. Freedom continue make money feed family shelter them.... I'm that.  ""if there's little COVID-19 around"" carrying lot weight here. Well, yeah, can't catch someone it. Gyms opening places there's lot COVID-19 around, that's concerning. worry, able survive warm weather. Yo man, marry foreign nationals you‚Äôll allowed travel foreign spouse. saying. Shit might *THAT* bad yet, mean, we‚Äôre talking escape plans right? Anyway, don‚Äôt know guys kiwi chick looking mighty fine right now. link (Creepy slithery tone) inject it. üôèü§≤üëêIt's gonna hurt. I'm doctor. told someone else well, testing facility told us 5 - 10 days. wonder tests done I'm sure bunch different ones there. Maybe push back line done showing symptoms. months ago took almost 1 month get results back. Also think meant ""in 21th century"" guess start chanting ‚Äúwe‚Äôre number one‚Äú :( Considering kindergarten teacher, understand school provides academic learning. appreciate effort educate me, though. also agree distance learning nowhere near good in-person eduction - particularly lower grades.

You quite condescending tone - ""let's responsible this"". disagree I'm ""crying like baby"" want asthmatic self bring home virus. think responsible consider safety students, families, colleagues.

Children flexible resilient. Distance-learning idea certainly better rushing back school early parents wits' ends dealing children. Maybe that's - reason see lot parents sharing social media undertone driving decision. personally think hybrid schedule best. particularly disagree students required wear masks entirety school day. schools want students teachers return, regulations place protect students teachers much possible. Barring true medical need, reason child can't learn wear mask day - especially shortened hybrid schedule. say kindergarten teacher years experience - students would able keep mask weeks adjusting. 1) came out
2) it‚Äôs data information anyone else matter
3) everyone seems suddenly care peer review now, people seem also ignore consensus experts. 
4) It‚Äôs month. 2-3 weeks incubation period. takes days test see numbers come in. I'm seeing, general sentiment.

In words, I'm seeing, Trump *is* getting shitstorm blame. Goes show masks don‚Äôt shit. Guys don‚Äôt test cases duhhh Totally unrelated protests though! Yeah... couple days ago looked immigration possibilities countries. It‚Äôs corona either, I‚Äôve watched U.S. slide shit show post many years. Even child realized something wrong.

Luckily relevant skills could maybe immigrate. sucks, love country, culture shock would hard. I‚Äôve traveled lot it‚Äôs obvious sometimes people don‚Äôt realize culture contributes much happiness. even speaking language. It‚Äôs fun visit, get itch go home. 

Anyways, decided last night learn French, could help get Canada. crazy thing is, I‚Äôm joking. I‚Äôve always wanted learn it, truly feel time things go shit better chances apply Canada. think entirely unclear. 2.5 billion people live countries fairly sure disease control, now. Another 2 billion countries disease spreading unchecked. 

But 3 billion simply good numbers - South America general, Africa, big chunks Asia.

It's simply early tell. can't, doesn't. impossible completely isolate playing kids eachother, certain extent, that's okay. Young kids significantly lower chance spreading virus adults [according research (our local CDC), chance certainly zero, contact one two kids still much better contact twenty others. funny say UK almost double deaths per capita. thing hypoxia. Thats exactly from. Breathing emissions long. doctors nurses brought up. pretty rare though usually happens people weak respiratory systems begin with. Dumb shit. told consequences would ignored appeal base. Unfortunately good people Texas yo pay Abbott‚Äôs incompetence inhumanity. FrEeDoM

/s Problem jogging same. might pass someone split second there's chain joggers going either direction split seconds add equate constant contact. pass 30 people hour long jog that's basically thing standing crowd 30 heavy breathing, perspiring people half minute. That's thing, first shut economically devastating, course. premature reopening enforcement safety guidelines like masks distancing, *it nothing!!* TX, FL, AZ, etc right back soup again. 

The economy cooked either way. either due shutdowns people going they're afraid. Might well shut right way. may late that. think help ""science"" get used tool big money steer consumer sentiment telling people one thing switching course years later. example sugar industry Please get tested can. Sustained low SpO2 bad enough, covid make plummet quickly. Oh..ok.. whatever worth .

I mean hELLo... -.- may wanna get brain tested. Seems stopped functioning. wearing one argued early told work wear one would protection better protection. 

Still campaign convince reluctant, recalcitrant, denier needs iconic marketing tribalism. countries laugh bad US handling this. Lol one wrote article making claims. County health director person talk article, actual expert.. know fact mass gathering spread virus

Have source points protests cause spike?? Sorry dude I'm used talking manly man like yourself. 

I curious though fall man scale? ""Despite death counts decreasing"" oh dead people get un-deaded?

Better say death count per day. protested shoulder shoulder streets. Social distancing recommended fucking reason. Yeah... really expect anything ""improvement"" Isn‚Äôt important compare positive rates back April states breaking though? ""So... two meet?""

""I never seen heard before. They. saw proposal Reddit thread. ~~love~~ something first sight."" See gotta deal here? Willful ignorance. know need ocean beach, right? made choice. experts famine. won‚Äôt pretend be, going go estimates.

Right, either.  said ""could result"", ""will result"". confidence? know idiots like direct threat ones actually trying responsible smart public.

Dude went protest thousands others small streets. Pretty sure I'm responsible one could be. types people look charts say, yeah man right!  I'll believe science now. Yup. Ask Sweden well ""shield vulnerable"" works Hard people power want slow testing makes look bad. think irrelevant right now. think trying discuss. established, I'm happy share feelings want them.

Do think protests main cause massive spike? cancer cells. NK cells kill highest reported percentage antibodies 20% surprise government YOLO mode Remember 20 new cases China back February?

* consistent message health professionals levels government. 

* Media government providing platform medical officials spread information answer public health questions. 

* governments making real attempt provide assistance extended period.

It perfect, seems largely successful point. really hope US find way move direction, sakes. Stay safe! I‚Äôm first generation American dads side. saying months now. place people came opportunity hope future many years. don‚Äôt feel like case anymore.

I would love move country ASAP, it‚Äôs disgusting happened especially last 3 years. Politics considered sport people choose team. It‚Äôs divided selfish. take decades turn around happened worlds view us. makes really sad see. it?? Asking friend Sort reminds two boats helicopter joke preacher hurricane refuses rescue two boats helicopter asks God protected flood dies, receive answer ""What want me? sent two boats helicopter.""

The mask protect Gods breathing system, use it. USA country top 10 testing per capita 150M people (which, people have, harder test scale due manufacturing test kits logistically getting comes deaths per capita (despite likely catching cases able attribute deaths COVID due higher testing rates countries), USA better France, UK, Spain, Belgium, Italy (not going discuss Sweden approach controversial best). performance metric slightly worse Ireland Netherlands despite, again, higher per capita rates testing countries despite intercontinental flight passenger arrivals anyone else (and third international arrivals general), opportunities virus hop Europe said, explicitly voting Donald Trump Republican governor November, handling pandemic among reasons. think dozens opportunities handle things better have. 

But why, come here, people act like US government handled pandemic much worse major countries' governments? numbers despite culture provides many ""muh liberties"" responses wearing masks world-leading rates obesity increase chances complications. Without ridiculous rate obesity people ignoring CDC guidelines wear mask, death rate would much much lower still.  Exactly. So, no. won‚Äôt stop. That‚Äôs great reddit. keep scrolling you‚Äôd like remain ignorant. [Relevant Lol it‚Äôs not. Y‚Äôall love purposely obtuse. protests blame aren‚Äôt seeing significant increases states closed slowly opening restrictions ? NY cases significantly gone despite thousands protests going . Mhhhm wonder why. 

It‚Äôs states opened completely knowing slowed spread . states enforce masks social distancing . actually used brain would actually see clear reason increase cases pretty chill! Good smokin' bowl video, too... would imagine. valuing freedom wearing fucking mask

Citizens defining freedom piece cloth front face. Oh perfect timing, commented another one idiot posts proving even bigger idiot. Well done thank making case clear article left wing 'journalist' Christianna Silva evidence anything simpleton. matter much spam it. 

Imagine thinking know better experts, lol. Picking headline think make right, exactly like anti-vaxxer autism stats. epidemiologist done thorough studies complexities?!

What know fact mass gathering spread virus. End story. We‚Äôve talking lot explaining germs spread level. questions sees neighbor kids playing can‚Äôt, explain everyone taking seriously, are, socially distant wear masks. knows virus deadly people okay others die it‚Äôs important safe doctors help prevent people getting sick. yeah, get fundamental level age needs. don‚Äôt shelter facts since believe strongly science open/honest communication. Death rates spiking mostly young people getting now. know social distancing means, would rather protest parties. people protested families feed businesses opened need keep open losing everything. Go back begging sub people defy laws containment rules, won‚Äôt matter good bad task force is. People failed, period. Well, long, amirite? even surprised point?
Seriously, everyone expect numbers magically fix itself? Every decision made towards opening schools restaurants rest economy. Nobody surprised, saw coming. it‚Äôs get so, much worse. International biohazard AC switched many inside would‚Äôve taken masks cos heat. Cos protests people social distancing. UK half million went beaches didn‚Äôt wear masks distance. We‚Äôre totally gonna get second peak Thanks lot protesters. info deaths current death rate? understand cases rising hard find current deaths death rate. I'm 42 much internet experience Reddit social media handle. wife got first smart phone going chemo still figured things simple others simple Google search. Thanks subs

Just start calling really are, Trump based conspiracies. sub right wing cesspool years now.  ...trauma based mind control? conspiracy‚Äôs least understandable stupid uneducated. wtf trauma based mind control? 2016 saw country choose person put America first. But, changed. believe Santa Clause, Easter bunny, tooth fairy either.

Belief death intelligence. soon one believes doctrine sort, assumes certitude, one stops thinking aspect existence. dogma enters brain, intellectual activity ceases.

I believe anything, many suspicions. Anyone United States today paranoid must crazy. conclusion, conclusion. Things go always have, getting weirder time. Chinese schools first reopened kids passed away compulsory exercise line running masks on. Unfortunately, what‚Äôs alternative? Damned damned don‚Äôt. country like Greece relies tourism 25% GDP looking total economic destruction open up. least admit made mistake. progress suppose. Actually, NYC hasn‚Äôt seen spike cases protests all. Maybe people caught it, course, numbers aren‚Äôt there. 

Basically everyone wore masks turns effective spread deterrent. That‚Äôs far cry indoor, mask-less rally. Oh, I'm sure is. I'm sure they're going arrest time now. he'll justly punished! *is* America, all! Even technology I‚Äôm surprised confusing keep track of! quite. It‚Äôs understandable mistake. 

The better terminology would ‚Äúnationalized‚Äù ‚Äústate owned‚Äù.

‚ÄúPublicly owned‚Äù often understood ‚Äúpublicly traded‚Äù ‚Äî least US. It‚Äôs unfortunate different definitions mean different things. different definitions favor different places. Yeah depends situation. run mask live nyc. short stretches rarely see people, pull areas. need pay attention surroundings. aeee videos . literally family members Houston healthcare workers . ICUs fact near capacity . Instead trying ignore increased cases covid faulty logic don‚Äôt actually educate matter Freedumb finest. fuck Gen Z ignoring social distancing, protesting shoulder shoulder, shouting, chanting spreading droplets like there's tomorrow?

That's average infected dropped half, fucking idiots. ask blood oxygen levels like? I'm feeling worse worse sp02 hit 86% tonight. 89-92% days, new low. tested. downstate Illinois. go many public places, mask compliance decent far 100 percent. Facebook indication, many give crap taking precautions, presume ones get togethers, going church, etc. work outside, masks social distancing rare, except among older people work with. WINNING one number sure: bed 10 ""The best numbers.""

-Trump- breaks heart.  I'm long time ex-pat Canadian many dear friends US.  family US.  


Its tough watching country many people love spiral nightmare stupidity.  Americans know good, thoughtful, decent people.  far homeland idiots make problems rarely make far.  every country way another. Problem is, people refuse wear masks give shit people's lives. ""his nephew unknowingly virus hosted party""...like...how dumb you? friend went party made aware it, would consider criminal.

This survival smart fit. Stay educated there. I‚Äôm wearing masks stop making numbers?  It‚Äôs hurting helping. average person sees numbers pan starts ignore warnings advice them. Wow shit went 0-100 pretty quickly 36 second video ur still protesting, u selfish part problem, solution $400 laying around think biggest concern right going stay shape lockdown. Stop dumb. work COVID testing center... number + positive tests we‚Äôve seen completely asymptomatic people terrifying... &amp; reason tested broke social distancing guidelines &amp; someone later tested positive. today. lived. I've surgeries chest wall age 5 23. okay :) No, people change hits family. Hmmm maybe look Bible people handled pandemics guess believe population certain places listen comply directives. see plenty exceptions enforcement masks state requiring face masks already.

My source numbers higher time rising... stands reason dwarf earlier event.

You sound pretty optimistic this. wish shared opinion behavior humans. virus thats goal spread. 2.5m tested positive, say another 20m tested. That's 7% population. get 60-70% start stopping. lying narcissist blame ? Ontario tested 30000 111 cases yesterday. Stop taking dumbass rants facts. catholic mass essentially eating restaurant people gather together consume blood wine god. Jokingly McDonald‚Äôs serving god. primary ceremony. many religions core ceremonies animal sacrifices gods? Almost every early religion. something human psychology chose acts religious ceremonies. upvoting post ??  Thank you!! scan picture drivers license. hospitalizations climbing..... jogging like 6 weeks since I've seen anyone, lol think Administration supported wildly irresponsible protests social distancing ignored.

And right schedule, here's spike. I'll bet average infected way lower too, since young ass idiots protests.  Uvc, make sure one room use wireless remote off. People ignoring delay drives crazy - we‚Äôre see articles politicians stating, ‚ÄúDespite massively increasing cases past two weeks, people aren‚Äôt dying!!‚Äù  

Just like reopening state middle pandemic, it‚Äôs massively shortsighted. it? sky looks normal Kentucky  thought example popular German Youtuber/Twitch streamer pretty compelling: 

What would rather have: stadium full aggressive drunk people stadium stoned people laughing asses absolutely nothing, hugging other, reason all? I'd choose second one everytime. Really, endgame might end far worse position global stage US Brazil. far Glorious. Im jealous bit haha Massive crowds protesters shoulder shoulder didn‚Äôt tribute /s  observe social distancing play dates? wife tried twice, worked out, parents game hand sanitizer, stopping kids getting close, etc. two kindergarten/1st grade aged kids.

How work several kids? bad one Protests actually haven‚Äôt made worse all. Here‚Äôs working study shows protests zero effect, also contributed social distancing non-protestors stayed home. fact, using phone data, cities wide protesting net increase people staying home, larger / violent protest bigger effect. 

In words, amount people staying home due protests larger amount people protesting. reached point yet U.S. outlaws critical thinking?  mean, would greatly prefer forcibly shut places let people make smart decisions take care one another, but...(gestures wildly everything)  Chiming MA- Florida prepared 10 weeks intense lockdown mask usage? that‚Äôs it‚Äôs going take. even might enough numbers.  know least MD PA opened asymptomatic testing probably since still show symptoms all. considered essential personnel, non essential people coming work soon required tested come back work us employer strongly suggested get tested well. don‚Äôt plan getting tested unless show symptoms point. thought spread hOt WeATHer. fellow GIS person, I‚Äôm glad didn‚Äôt manipulate data, want clock person fired  true. Even though infections gone significantly hospitalizations deaths numbers shit show, 9 mio swedes disatributed area roughly big france countryside people used isolation. Also swedes trust governments follow orders. 

But still infection rates sweden allow neighboring countries lower borders. means lot historically borders non existent almost 70 years.

Sweden roughly 10mio citizens 5280 deaths now.

If calculate use numbers would stand 184.800 deaths!

So far complete shit show - contrary. 

For instance country Austria would stand us numbers at:

roughly 30.000 dead US numbers way higher population density. encourage people make home-made masks?  much easier self flagellating regrets proactive. Everything embarrassing compared countries. source cites BLM protests main cause spike?

Do think states reopening people going enclosed places (restaurants, bars, stores, etc) contributing factor?   hilarious see studies desperately trying suggest BLM protests/riots magically different mass gatherings?

As virtuous mass gathering much damage other.

It's really sad disingenuous, desperate crap ends us making opposition resentful.  Abbott science-denying Trump sycophant. deserves zero credit Manipulating data illegal. I'm Denmark I've seen total 3 people wearing masks (out many thousands people I've seen) past 4 months Fuck corporations? fuck business right? 

Every Mom Pop shop corporation. It‚Äôs either LLC, S-Corp C-Corp. local BBQ stand LLC S-Corp. 

Our business four employees S-Corp (no didn‚Äôt take money either). hey hey hey looks like blm protests finally paying we...did win? people nervous, people don‚Äôt care  laughing something serious?  bars?

He made people choose work health; entire reopening slowed.

It's young people partying; age group affected also large chunk public facing jobs Trump supportes. ""This way""  got diagnosed corona, smell taste completely gone, ever come back? I‚Äôm getting mixed answers Gee, wonder too... Wisconsin too, thanks conservative WI Supreme Court justices, way voted via Zoom afraid come vote chambers. Yep. travels pandemic? People think affect missing opening closed spaces large crowds stupid. stupid thing do. Given option, humans stupid thing 15,000% time. Disneyland CA. Disney World still scheduled reopen July 11-15. reminded brain dead mayor Jaws. last modern manufacturing facilities still require mass human labor work closely together assembly line. people arguing hast taken single economics class Yikes, second liked comment 80 years old I'm really glad live Florida. Voted DeSantis I'm alive next election, again. 

:/ probably way ratcheting down. Ease lockdown starting small thing older teacher, like trade-off! agree you, completely failed addressing solve problems associated shutting economy, prompt directed rant. shitty situation complicated problems, way slice it. know type mask people wearing horribly uncomfortable short period time store.

Are people buying, perhaps, burlap masks spikes inside? ball gag used Pulp Fiction? Duck tape mask rip off?

The mask common, everyday activities something simple loose fitting piece fabric covers nose mouth. Unless competing triathlon able deal it. guy country (Czech Republic) also treated Vietnam well nothing else praise Vietnamese care. Well done. Smart. Freedom responsibility go together takes wearing mask. People don‚Äôt think touch front mask touch something else. It‚Äôs also hand washing. Oh yeah it‚Äôs also hanging c lose proximity people it‚Äôs ‚Äúbad‚Äù area. ‚Äúbad‚Äù everyone‚Äôs area one time. Parents went Myrtle Beach brought back Covid. walked courtroom case taken care of.

I generally try avoid using google illuminati free mason microchips, naturally, front page results debunking insanity. testing skewed. Several people getting tested multiple times week every week changing routine, ever safe. chance testing positive slim. need go test people, different people makes sense. nightclubs open first place? perfect grounds spread. Sure economy must opened much possible think without clubbing now. 

Actually think nobody cares point, everybody ""meeeh, enough that, booooring"" I'm buying it. everyone 45 got shot yet still catch covid. Same. I'm going start telling places much makes sense, virus know spread protest entirely change incubation period wait months spike? heard ago wondering since vaccine gives immune system bit boost maybe booster shot could help defend virus boosting immune system. nothing solid get excited could fizzle out.

They‚Äôre smart enough know they‚Äôre wrong everything nobody wants one tell Oh, man, take way all, yeah, likewise you, we'll get sometime (sooner hopefully) doesn‚Äôt seem like understand anything virus certainly don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs going future. persistent question loomed massive protests police violence month: Would crowds become super-spreader event Covid-19, potentially delaying mayor‚Äôs plans Phase 2 Data tracks viral spread points answer: apparent stabilization DC‚Äôs coronavirus numbers comes time research institutions seen similar trends across country. ‚ÄúWe find evidence net COVID-19 case growth differentially rose following onset Black Lives Matter protests,‚Äù wrote authors recent working paper released week National Bureau Economic Research. paper analyzed data 315 cities saw significant protest activity. Pardon. Perhaps rephrase. happening proper use masks social distancing adhered to. hope clearer explanation understand post. dont think using twitter necessary wrong. shit says, much uses that‚Äôs problem.

Make sure everyone knows it, set standard! guys getting checks? never got stimulus LMAO God Bless ur family new baby best tell, study peer reviewed, found people go gym COVID, spread it.

This seems like trying mislead people believing can‚Äôt catch COVID gym.

You certainly can. Hard know grab now, pussies covered masks.  Yeah, he's full shit Please remember matter grim current situation looks like, pass.

As 1919 Spanish flu. Even without vaccine, influenza viruses eventually mutate less deadly form die out.   worse July nothing changes . peak higher. America is....



FUCKED  admitted lying interview. far interesting article read while. cheers! July De4th Put mouths thing? lick liberty bell? bet article covers extremely basic obvious hurdle...

I toddler, smoking gives panic attacks imagine stuck old woman calling cops CPS taking her. 

So stick whiskey. nothing. nap. 

A nice cup coffee helps time day Address content. dare you. Yeah thousands protesters practicing social distancing without masks nothing right dumb bitch. Hooters yesterday letting anybody restaurant without mask on. got saw nobody wearing mask putting show outside cops, like ""look us following rules"" men last? Aren‚Äôt men higher risk? Also taxes due July 15th. 

Those fed income taxes 2019 due April 15th , estimated taxes paid self-employed people Q1 (also originally due April 15th) Q2. Here's bigger question: long taking turn tests around? got tested 12 days ago still gotten results. point, result worthless 14 day period end weekend. Unless way turn around results 24-48 hours, making people wait 5 days feasible people already cooped inside long. end day you‚Äôre always gonna crazies don‚Äôt take things like seriously president administration isn‚Äôt even taking seriously course massive proportion population isn‚Äôt going either

A leader leads example example trump setting virus, Chinese flu isn‚Äôt something concerned about. He‚Äôs clearly concerned numbers polls people country nemesis made bat virus America gonna invent vaccine, Russians gonna try steal it. Helluva accusation make without linking source. first hand knowledge he‚Äôs changing numbers? Northeasterner, fact got hit early, damndest slow spread *and* give idea could happen alleviate it....only ""you"" ignore us, mock us saying ""Democrat cities"" got hit hardest, freak haircuts mundane shit, makes slightly-unsympathetic.

Im sitting house, watching horror pandemic becomes political. that. Unless need use medical equipment get diagnosis, phone appointments fit bill(no pun). I've used many times get prescription gerd back issues care.

They believe true. one video several others show give shit.

Time let people go. least got tolerance break! Ha looks like America winning again! Yea, opening bars beaches everything totally didnt shit it. Look number protestors wearing mask see ridiculous closed minded statement is. may come shock you, USA country world. world revolve around you. Turns average blm protest smaller biggest church towns boy lot smaller churches boot.

If try tell people passionate ending racism church goers Jesus Christians need start revival instead sitting couch every night. province new cases 2 weeks active cases since week ago able shut border. I‚Äôm worried we‚Äôve done everything right we‚Äôll open back good chunk economy tourism it‚Äôll get spread right back Quebec Ontario. study brought CRUNCH obviously tested population higher, brain dude fuck. Proportionally, US isn‚Äôt testing more. dont like medical staffs saved man's life near death praised foreign news site??? that‚Äôs really working us far. Probably less accurate than, know, Covid 19 tesr Yes. still can‚Äôt aerobic issues without ending sick afterwards. Yep. stay strong, too! tough me, middle school + first time ever situation like this, together! Unfortunately population individuals died become numbers. tragedy seeing many die hope day rememberance every year. Unless another world war, many deaths small amount time across globe. I'm St. Louis too! However, I'm teacher South Korea. online classes 2 months, included kindergarten.

Thankfully, Korea handled outbreak well we've back classroom since start May. Dumbass protesters without facemasks caused it. Sooo America see 5 Years prudent choice. sure anyone could think bars good idea point time. Oxford vaccine development years; that‚Äôs one major advantages it‚Äôs already safety tested extended period. Im Canadian pretty shit see what's happening next door. conservative premier Ontario I'm glad he's page prime minister could easily issue. Instead making political thing, decided what's best people. Imagine that.... Trump needs put ego away. cares? rest us simply trying ""not catch virus"", we're busy staying home! 2020, campaigns hoping win keeping candidates silent possible.

 heart want rich, ain't leaving TV till make relevant reliability state/oligarch owned sources?

If we‚Äôre comparing atrocities, [the USA notches belt almost believe media propaganda personal privacy. fact, ordinary people, privacy all. 

 privacy propaganda designed cover illegal activities rich.

 million dollars nothing top billionaire, still less conglomerate. could known?

Im sorry trying stop irony palpable, fact see biggest significant difference BLM protests events mention is, goes show really understand Covid transmission works. fact, name one study tying current surge Covid cases BLM protests. actual study, opinion piece Trump supporting moron.

While certainly possible transmit virus fleeting contact, transmission works best constant close quarters contact. events mentioned? involve people sitting standing around one place prolonged periods time. protests? Usually involve people standing around. moving thing, usually stay around people hours time. impossible contract disease protests, cases, volume significantly less expected, different dynamics protests vs mass gatherings possible reason why. beach yesterday lot people bars packed Thanks part. wish restaurants would this. Went get carry one day one favorite cafes pre-pandemic single restaurant employee (or patron) wearing mask...never went back. ‚ÄúIf could go back redo everything, would like Cuomo did.‚Äù That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying! I‚Äôm upset forced go back work nail salon last week. earlier today client saw yesterday told tested positive Covid. sitting (with precautions like masks plexi-glass shield, still that‚Äôs 100% effective) hour half nails. exposed Covid people decided ‚Äúneeded‚Äù get nails done asthma. Next time ""psuedo scientific nut job turned stand comedian"" U.S. we‚Äôre good Europe death rate near 5%. It‚Äôs less 1%. don‚Äôt know vaccine efficacy yet. Best case might need 60 percent so. Dude go listen townhall rants people angry wear masks.

This town reached maximum stupidity.

Either ubiquity cameras means able finally document all. 

In either case - I'm really much stoked. Beyond satire. scary. People lack awareness words actions absurd mock. can‚Äôt exaggerate stupidity, hit hard pan dumb can‚Äôt think new make fun it. Wow can't win narcissist. know many people fired impotus. 

You either get timid really effective narcissist still narcissist get stooge much worse. way could worked stooge's incompetence lead mass protests maybe even civil war oust impotus. think highly unlikely. still better now. Well, fun Looking forward movie. Maybe get Gorden Ramsay explain data manipulation using Beef Wellington since Anthony Bordain longer us. super love paying watch movie explains terrible people go jail none actually do. Exactly. fly won‚Äôt packed plane right now. Charge extra, keep seats open. cant wait hear protests anything make sense. Anyone explain me? Way go protestors looters... hand watching Ted Cruz splutter ""I get federal funding stopped testing"" glorious #winning I‚Äôm serious neither things?

The US FUCKED right thinking anything wrong.

No leader would agree reopening borders Covid rages major population centres US. Well, turns covid much worse car accidents, I've eating lot humble pie. Gained lockdown fifteen, watched old time baseball, trying figure grow up.

I'm capitalist heart, ain't leaving TV till make  I've watching people kinds stupid shit say ""don't worry, kept social distancing"". Social distancing means stay fk home! you‚Äôre claiming chinas news source propaganda tightly government control? doubt honestly believe that. Right perfectly normal

Except constant fear deportation, drive every day without license insurance, knowing get evicted point without recourse, working getting paid, fear losing anything invest money in. 

Super fun time 

You right though easiest part finding work there‚Äôs many American businessmen jump backwards opportunity max profits cheap labor know Republicans donate money spine go them. premise month mass protesting clearly involve spike COVID. know, know, narrative don‚Äôt want believe it. 

Ask yourself: would NYC want ask people attended mass gathering trying accurately trace COVID spread? 

The answer political, practical. seems ironic big debate country immigration. everything I've seen seem worth risk let American immigrate anywhere else. mean Rona, American ideology individualism even good individuals there. Yeah I‚Äôm still going suspect China‚Äôs numbers always, get it‚Äôs authoritarian regime, country population 1,439,323,776 really suffered 4,600 deaths? Like realllly? 

Even ‚Äúact early‚Äù, you‚Äôre telling couple months January - March trying contain it, 4,600 vulnerable people died? least expect death rate 10x. Even they‚Äôve stabilized since then, there‚Äôs ducking way you‚Äôre gonna convince country 1.5 BILLION people 4,600 die 1776 Good job thai keep up. Good news.! hope take COVID19 serious now. shit. Florida 2 weeks ago didnt see one mask. weird masks OBVIOUSLY work us Americans refuse wear them, people continue complain things shut down. really think possible stupid serious time. people ask DAS passes need them, Disney. give shit anyone themselves. small tweak agree judge's overall POV, find quoted part argument particularly bit mask size disingenuous. Imagine someone saying, Look, corks 0.5"" diameter big deal plugging nose day. 

The fact matter is, masks suck way regular clothing doesn't, world whole already clothing faces. They're stifling make frustrating two people communicate dulling speech obscuring face important tool human interaction. hate wearing regular face mask shopping that's couple years' experience wearing N95 probably hour weekday. 

Now consider perspectives millions employees wear masks day long shifts work, sometimes hot places without air conditioning, told buck by, least proportion, privileged people physically exerting working home offices mask always necessary. 

Better recognize fucking sucks manner transcends simple inconvenience, ask us make sacrifice anyway, admonish people ""uphill ways""-style comparison difficulties faced eras past. Precisely. fact shit political absurd. Nice centrist view got People wearing masks Covid even thing. think wearing mask makes difficult breathe, wait til find covid makes breathe! virus built infect cells respiratory tract makes stomach die, mixes saliva (which would likely happen many viruses food you‚Äôre eating) probably make way respiratory tract infect cell make virus ""Systemic abuse"" wrote. referring April investigation included 1000 facilities.

You research tin foil hat theories share them. saying ultimately Danish Ministry's fault. 2 would exist without case 1. Coupled opiates... Major credibility lost vocal experts staying virtually silent protests, marches, riots, looting. Science afraid speak up. wear mask follow rules. get people frustrated. paused virus let mayhem go certain degree still are. see pics every day women mask inch police officers face screaming them. Nobody says word? worse ultimately lost ground gained. People social distanced gatherings many mask governors mayors allowed all. sit home mask, gloves, hand sanitizer feeling defeated. right thing local leaders not.  live parents. When's last time stepped foot Austin? No. won‚Äôt. cute plan. Lmao it‚Äôs lot better states. Don‚Äôt get twisted. Generally people follow social distancing rules mask wearing stores such. Miles better what‚Äôs going US. taking like mfing plane ü§£ is, indeed, longer flat.

Maybe specific. first reply, quoting someone implying quote todays number. point sentence yesterdays numbers, says nothing todays numbers. Depends control exponential growth gets. now, death rate may lower younger demographic, disease highly infectious spread risk population. top story 5, water wet. Tune in-depth reporting. point protests obviously cause current spike cases across Southern states.

Whatever increase caused protests insignificant compared tens thousands new cases saw across South yesterday. That's one great weaknesses American culture. Maybe dark side focus individual rights. rabbi told once, Americans learn something Jewish teachings - US focus ""my rights,"" frequently fail think ""my responsibilities."" Judaism teaches live community constantly reminds us think owe others. cannot love G-d love neighbor. mean 57% elderly though. Curious % is, can't imagine loss people experiencing ;c rampant misunderstanding Constitutional rights GOP hilarious. freedoms limitless ignorant fucks. 1st amendment allow endanger others whenever want. It‚Äôs rude call entire USA meatpacking plant. love this! sounds knowledgeable, compassionate, rational. research. want send thank card. Wonder would make good president. NOTHING sacred?! forgot third option, pretending nothing wrong. America‚Äôs handling mask botched beginning. least months everyone told ‚Äúmasks don‚Äôt work.‚Äù remember people even shamed others wearing them. Surgeon General many others said don‚Äôt help. 

Then, almost night, attitude changed things start open back become mandatory.

Had health professionals government consistent message advocate citizens wear cloth masks early front much help instead saying absolutely nothing think Americans would keen wearing them. 

I even think companies government would say things like ‚Äúwe recommend masks‚Äù ‚Äúwe encourage masks‚Äù ‚Äúmasks proven keep others well‚Äù would go better government stepping forward saying ‚Äúmasks mandatory‚Äù especially good portion American cities currently pushing back law makers law enforcement looking comply protesting against.

And, clear, wear mask see resist it. gonna break 10k barrier tomorrow wooo always different average Texas City. Though, honestly sucks now. that's thing. awesome people started moving droves. insincere act like different. would wager guess number people legitimate medical condition precludes use mask...to much less 1%....2% tops.

i imagine conditions might exist....although can't think any....and neither Google. I've old woman literally corner tell proud wearing mask, survival fittest. Grandparents even care grandparents. videos hospital staff getting ready amount protection put on..... think someone wear mask bit really entitled behaviour. understand research pumped faster competent reviewers actually read it, it‚Äôs reviewed someone outside NBER, isn‚Äôt really much better post r/theydidthemath Look bright side, they've flattened curve!!! I'm aware way elastic used make fit better around nose. Elastics provide tension, think there's way use tension make curve (unless use vertically pull curves around nose down, think easily comfortably). 

The metal nosepieces work pretty well, although I'm worried whether affects whether machine washed. Personally I've best success sewing fit perfectly face, glasses help pin top down. sometimes use tape help out.  Let's go lautenbach Texas, Willy Waylon boys people trash. heart goes many, many suffer yours. agree what‚Äôs said here, vaccine mythical all. least 4 candidates track market end year. Meanwhile supply chains around world ramping anticipation completion final phase clinical trials. stuff absolutely agree with. That's NH doctor saying did. think it‚Äôs combination stuff. Memorial Day reopening large part increases. Since Memorial Day traffic live pre-virus levels. protests also cause spike however states hasn‚Äôt. still think indoors much dangerous outdoors. It‚Äôs clusterfuck bad decisions that‚Äôs causing pike. Unfortunately got rid dashboard ny.gov site can't link that. Best article read update everyday want look past week compare. 1776? fairly obvious things need considered standpoint lowest common denominators based states getting right. Unless planning recinding interstate travel commerce, either hard national lockdown cross fingers hope vaccine accept deaths along way. I've said start. Unfortunately, quickly would forget damage done? Memories short aging, there's constant changing guard young ones memory move in. say ‚Äúwe flattened curve,‚Äù looking graphs head tilted? work giving crap calling out. Even though I‚Äôm experiencing pretty telling symptoms.  they‚Äôll call biased liberal, propaganda powerful Good ole Ron FL going something say that. Exactly lol assumes everyone crowd infected shedding viral particles. case, least Minneapolis, protests. amazing. Yes rest world follow example. general public dumb reckless don‚Äôt see happening. 


Can give examples types precautions took first reopening now? 8.9k yesterday. 9.5k today Ooooh boy wishing bad health another. Stand person must be.   Yesterday AA said they'll fly full capacity. Delta then... worst assholes refuse wear one go around glaring everyone outright daring say something want flip ""their rights"" ""MURICA"", etc. example, live Denver pretty much 95% people wear masks mandatory city. Tuesday, medical appt, went store much redder southern suburbs isnt mandatory maybe 65-75% wear masks 25-35% walk around trying make coronavirus great glaring everyone. Like WTF...just wear damn mask. pleasure get wearing one trying stare do? life pathetic NEED attention badly? 

Hell, here's another great example week. finally got snow tires changed yesterday I'm avoiding unneccessary trips interaction. almost July well past time switch winter tires. tire place went also suburbs near mg old office store credit figured not? Overall, tire place great job social distancing, etc. single chairs outside people wait chairs good 10 ft apart. Lots signage saying masks mandatory. car owners drive garage avoid employees vehicle, etc.So despite chairs laid open...here comes Surburbs MAGA Dumbass ""I need mask"" Guy. I'm masked, sitting chair sidewalk putside waiting car makes point walk right chair basically brushing plop ass curb maybe 3 ft away. glanced him, got walked far end sidewalk area sit furthest chair could him. Didnt say word worth it. got moved..
With glaring entire time like one something wrong.

This guy drove tire place ignored ""pull wait assistance"" signs park F350 super cab 4x4 truck probably drives white collar office job never likely never towed anything road entire lifetime. fit type T. So, parks, walks store (ignoring signage, refusing wear mask, etc) told wait outside vehicle they'll right him. stands outside huffing puffing come list servicing. gets helped, proceeds stupidity act plopping dumbass right reason. mean would rather sit curb right someone instead comfortable chair 10 ft away?. people assholes....and militantly reason Stigginit. assholes lick ice cream cough people deliberately. Like WTF.


Mind you, pretty blue, overall progressive area. Even Denver's immediate southern suburbs purpleish worst turn ruby red get good ways south. first relocated Denver, got temp housing suburbs neighbors could pretty crazy. height 2016 election pro maga signage surreal. Lots pro gun, pro Murica, hang Hillary, craziness. lots guys like truck asshole...when moved permanent house city, nicer reasonable (at least thought normal) neighbors asked us ""why want move there...that's queers live"". That's verbatim quote mind you. ones thought normal.

So...yeah, America fucked. We're fucked good hard lube...and we're gonna keep getting fucked least 1/3 1/2 country science dear leader told so. 

In conclusion, that's 2 trips even Denver suburbs last couple weeks regret leaving reasonable deep blue city full people want due believe basic science. can't imagine like really deep red parts country. There‚Äôs thing rights, responsibility. Months away optimistic, especially scaled production. preparing 18 months away hoping better. Even JHU slightly overshot last night, least looked (approx 1400 GMT). Maybe started slaughtering Indigenous nations bringing people Africa chains? think now, need argument authority. Bill Gates Miss Arizona, everyone agree one, side lol I‚Äôm trying be! report I‚Äôm part number... despite efforts always wear mask, wash hands work home, still got rona. Luckily lost sense taste smell, otherwise feel normal. Islam better get terrorist problem solved ASAP. entire Middle East supposed become uninhabitable next 100 years. middle east relocate terrorist problem fixed nobody going letting in. think small number like 10% Muslims extremists terrorists, 10% 1 billion 100 million. Thats way many. Woah kidneys  I'd definitely take naked vomiting DeSantis point. doubting you, I'm genuinely curious, sure definitely false positive? heard researchers run arrays confirm test result impression research, commercially available antibody tests. Florida reported 2x amount cases 1 day country reported whole outbreak. Yesterday America reported 10x overall amount country.  Thats comment referred to.  seriously trying quibble exact procedures state implemented re-open?

The point clearly *wasn't* protests caused spike we're seeing today across Southern states. Stop trying derail conversation. Stay focused.

Obviously, whatever restrictions place either ignored (because ""muh dreedumbz), completely ineffective preventing spike cases.

Regardless, stop blaming protests unless provide data shows significant spikes cities biggest protests. worst pandemic since Spanish flu. curve US come right back April levels. majority country didn‚Äôt work together long enough crush it. Shocked Nicolas Cage face. Love thy neighbor hmmm heard before. Oh yea religion anti-maskers preach totally cool Morocco, especially northern cities. cafes neighborhoods people smoke openly. seen teenager beg cop entrance stadium give back weed confiscated.

There Islamic texts forbid weed since available back then, even alcohol widely available consumed Morocco, Morocco several beer wine brands. Imagine Obama Hillary power. 

The ppl who‚Äôre now, would refusing stand listen government. 

The problem Americans..... Yeah don‚Äôt think bosses happy first time face realization dead employees don‚Äôt bring money. sentence - one Saturday's update one saying backlog. article updated - says much. dont live vacation state means much easier :/ state still looks Florida, that's suckass Florida doing. know lot people traveling vacation, far, everyone specifically looked places private beaches contact. I'm surprised bc expected us shit handling this. players care themselves? continually see stories popping partying like. ok partying 50 closest friends, also make money playing ball. Every year passes year closer aging out. downvotes me, I'll wait end vent. Sucks that's reality think actually split shares lieu bailout Sounds familiar Also currently hate would bother protecting people dicks us? Fly Plague-Ridden Skies! need sort extension unemployment. many old careers back especially since reopening flopped massively many states including mine (California) Yeah, kids working kitchen together?

Yes illegal immigrants detention center, kids housing waiting set foster homes parents go legal system.

But tell us kitchens run children convicts wasn‚Äôt mistake. Thanks laugh, needed today. One door entrance arent quite people Reddit think are. would think children? Care like do? kick streets? did. Doomers saying Florida going fly past NY. I‚Äôm saying Florida‚Äôs average age infection 30 years younger April, deaths aren‚Äôt going stockpile like guaranteeing seems pointless argument. want school protect you, way protect there. go without telling come. I'd looking different career right - one going truly safe quite long time. seen spike cases contact tracers? Flawless logic Socially culturally, would say USA fucked country planet. specific right taken away? expect get reaction comment like see important? Maybe everyone things know virus everyone else since novel virus one knows who's right. Needs framed terms ‚Äúif don‚Äôt wear mask, trying ruin economy.‚Äù Stop ineffective concern others arguments. 

You don‚Äôt like things shut again? behavior. way stand court. 28 members family. Let sink mean, one point, people make decision really willing risk sit stands. make much fans, they're gonna lose lot goes further. personally, sports game anytime soon. dining in, bar hopping too.

Really US handling COVID general contributing it. one factor, though obviously bigger others, general lack sustained crackdown nation that's led getting hand States. Okay got shift home. People dining indoors, seemed pretty good putting masks table. said I'm honestly unsure safe even tables spread restaurant still relatively small Yep. fave pizza place curbside takeout only. It‚Äôs main takeout I‚Äôm willing right now. diagnosis March &amp; I've still got chest pain. Ok. No. responded comment ""solve please"".

I'm looking comments thread, discussing them. numbers confirmed covid patient covid Many restaurant packed since reopening.

And that's exactly problem. government pay restaurants stay closed. used live St Pete, moved Virginia Piedmont 8 years ago. regrets! time awesome vaccine gift Oxford.... Less fox news buddy weeding buried comments harrass people. That's spend weekend. Look kn95, seem slightly easier find pretty similar terms protection levels. 

You might luck here: bet good surgical mask paired regular face shield could helpful. I‚Äôve seeing around (Canada). US may outlier cares you‚Äôre protecting yourself.  course, still infect people.  idea is, put notice personally die, might actually take whole thing seriously, choose wear masks.  last updated 25th. I‚Äôm sure report Monday. God guarantee protections disease. People like invoke God understand Bible. Taking US example , leading cause death daily average COVID. also take account counted deaths. Annual death number articles read based complicated calculations algorithms include probably deaths said cause. 

The deaths COVID accurate excess mortality taken account. really interesting note pneumonia 5fold states likely COVID deaths. averages even higher 2 year averages pneumonia deaths accumulated across 3 months. 

But everything cases , deaths recoveries massively under/over reported. part, except short walks around neighborhood, left house go anywhere exactly twice since March 8th, times go contactless pharmacy drive-thru. I've part, hope protests ramp cases city again. :( Sounds right. I‚Äôd put Plain stupidity top. listen trump anything you‚Äôre idiot even American, contrarian right. democrats said wiping ass good idea, they'd stop it. here! state ""leadership team"" thrown us wolves. well yeah. uh oh fucking spaghettos days long discussion someone like two weeks ago. refused believe long term damage widespread problem reported. tanked economy pretty much nothing? Yeah science also said nothing bad would happen hey putting Covid patients elderly homes. 

Data. Science. maybe 10k attended protest could gotten it, 2 week period show spike less 1000 cases, thing though 10k went home spread family went else spread it, number start climb 40k-50k thats starts really registering... know virus transmitted? logic, refuse sell alcohol without ids minors? sell cigarettes menacing looking teenagers ? don‚Äôt need police force enforce rules. Moreover. clear endangerment others violation law, legal responsibility ensure adherence. Someone gets sick Walgreens wasn‚Äôt adhering local code could easily sue chain gross negligence. Breakin records baby  You‚Äôre right thing. boat slipped diligence. traveled help elderly family member surgery. circumstances required it, didn‚Äôt put quarantine afterwords didn‚Äôt wear mask around loved ones.

Then get call hear family member likely COVID multiple days there.

The panic anxiety personal guilt felt waiting test result awful hate slipping up. thing don‚Äôt want person spreads loved ones I‚Äôm GenX, wife. damnedest stay much possible. go super cautious, masked up, sanitized. sneak town day lunch treat even went in, poked head see many people, masks worn, tables spaced such. even showed soon opened limit patrons inside. 

There plenty people taking seriously, it‚Äôs one generation another. taking seriously not, nots really don‚Äôt give shit all. Like it‚Äôs non existent them. Gotta keep up. 7 day moving average new cases plateauing past week according distancing. Keep masking. Another loss red team point families pay _anything_ tests. could publicly funded part package actually _manage_ crisis. But, instead spending small amount money prevention, ignore fund another enormous bailout. Quarantined muthafuckin plane Surprising, contradicts studies

Anti grammar gamble book amenity maine 72 hours advance?  actual question: already know certain FBI situation reports FBI surveilling Americans via public social media posts, regard participation protests, I'm sure Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner's statement matter disconcerting many protesters. blame people wanting protect privacy regarding participation protests. Personally, think there's harm asking question, people answer however want, think making clear data used important. 


Maybe clear stance: I'm making kind claim whether protests lead spike cases‚ÄîI let data speak itself, also lot factors play. Personally, was/am nervous possibility, considering city (Philadelphia) already hit hard Covid once, held largest ongoing protests country last month. simply making claim simply yet seen trend surges cases cities held large protests (I analyzed current growth rate cases state). seen surges many states reopened earlier. Understanding data simplistic, however, lot complicated factors consider, lot variation factors, conditions, levels restrictions across country. 


There plenty speculation seen protest-related spikes (Philadelphia Inquirer HUGE difference indoor outdoor transmission rates, mask-wearing rate protesters, factors. said, suspect see protest-related surges Covid cases, surge cases likely strongly localized around major densely-populated cities held largest protests, Philadelphia NYC. far, Philadelphia's current case growth rate less 1%. New York City's case growth rate also less 1%. Places like Los Angeles little harder make confident claims about, currently 2% growth rate cases, also started reopening back May 8th, early. Business restrictions mask-wearing also reportedly lax California, spread largely taking place multi-family houses Southern California. bring general, Covid cases disproportionately spreading among Latino families South Western states, contract tracing pointing directly workplace exposure essential workers, spreading multifamily homes 


Arizona one major outlier I'd like bring up, experiencing highest current Covid case growth rate whole country, 5%, start loosen restrictions May 15th. largest protests Arizona took place Phoenix, hundreds people attending 4 days. Maricopa County (where Phoenix located) currently experiencing 6% case growth rate. there's factors could contributing this:  
**1)** four days protests  
**2)** According yesterday, ""...physicians, public health experts, advocates local officials say crisis predictable Arizona, local ordinances requiring masks forbidden Gov. Doug Ducey (R) reversed course last week."" 
 **3)** increase mostly based upon Latino multifamily home spread, light workplaces opening back up.  
It could reasons, various degrees, perhaps considered. 


But considering protests Philadelphia New York *STILL* taking place whole month, seen kind surge, I'm confident Arizona's surge realistically linked four days outdoor protests. I'm sure non-zero number people exposed virus result attending protests, rate outdoor transmission extremely low, considering airflow, viral load, etc., especially people smart wearing masks close proximity others. We'll wait see, may better idea days weeks come. You‚Äôre right damnit Yeah popular tubing spots Texas super crowded weekends basically like crowded nightclub big holiday like 4th July. outdoor, helps, packed 0 people wearing masks water. exactly. do. go state move stay two hotels. also saw friends couple outdoor beers bar. know wrong choice I‚Äôve feeling didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd see again. wearing mask it‚Äôs appropriate trying best take precautions Rights?

Lool say I've never understood guys afraid others thinking they're gay. Keep hearing talk people saying protests going bars that's wrong. Indoor transmission accepted predominant mode transmission, experts agree outdoor transmission harder 10x. Combine higher % protesters wearing mask vs. restaurants/bars results surprising.

Pure corruption, yet staggering number caused New Jersey‚Äôs coronavirus death toll leap instant nearly 15%.

On Thursday, Gov. Phil Murphy announced 1,854 probable COVID-19 deaths added state‚Äôs official tally, account people likely died disease without tested outbreak raged.

‚ÄúWe report nothing else solemn sense duty,‚Äù Murphy said announcing new numbers, caused death count jump 14,872. ‚ÄúFor many families, hope determinations provide sense closure finally knowing.‚Äù


Experts long said New Jersey‚Äôs tabulations, previously confined lab-confirmed coronavirus cases, understated. Data suggests new toll closer reality.

Since May, NJ Advance Media tracking mortality state comparing overall deaths year regardless cause would expected based previous years‚Äô averages. statistics consistently showed state‚Äôs tally low, missed hundreds deaths likely caused pandemic.

Factor state‚Äôs new probable death figures, gap seems disappear. March end May, New Jersey 14,893 deaths typical time period 2015 2019 ‚Äî virtually state‚Äôs new count.

So far June, mortality figures show increase excess deaths, though unclear whether change, given delays reporting stats.

There many reasons coronavirus deaths underreported, medical examiners epidemiologists said. outbreak rocked state, New Jersey lacked resources test everyone virus, people laid rest may died without disease detected. deaths, doctors may attributed cause generic ailments heart disease. cases, death certificates filled inconsistently.


In announcing probable deaths, Pennsylvania following lead states. Wednesday, Delaware added 67 COVID-19 deaths toll 500 lives lost review death records state health officials. Others, including Michigan Colorado, also include probable deaths part tallies.

It makes sense states document disease‚Äôs impact fully can, said Dr. Victor Weedn, former head New Jersey‚Äôs medical examiner‚Äôs office professor George Washington University. Though effort time- resource-consuming, gives important insight crisis‚Äô impact, said.

‚ÄúThen better understanding, continuing efforts next (time),‚Äù Weedn said.

In reaching state‚Äôs probable fatality number, Murphy said health officials combed thousands death certificates identify residents could ‚Äúwith great reliability‚Äù said died coronavirus. new figures included people died symptoms known contagions, particularly state‚Äôs hard-hit nursing homes, officials said.


‚ÄúThat particularly common earlier outbreak testing difficult, often impossible test everybody,‚Äù said New Jersey‚Äôs communicable disease chief, Dr. Ed Lifshitz.

Lifshitz said there‚Äôs deserved interest public knowing numbers. state plans announce probable COVID-19 deaths week, Lifshitz said anticipate increase dramatically week‚Äôs announcement, called product months review.

‚ÄúWe made claim possibly count every single person who‚Äôs affected every single person who‚Äôs died,‚Äù Lifshitz said. ‚ÄúBut best get numbers accurately can.‚Äù bow position breathe Problem is, still infect people. Masks need worn everyone - infected particular - helpful. Worldometer US 26th.

Same true protestors, many exposed, many symptomatic, many got sick, many tested, many exposed locations, place employment, completely unknown. 

It matter activity is, anytime gathering people exposure. literally less 1 10 million exposures contact traced, even major cities, and/or major hotspots LA, Dallas, Houston, Miami, etc. etc. 

Your assumption know, all, degree protests spread COVID19 completely false. idea. know every city major gathers protests number cases risen. wonder note medical doctor may provide support negotiating reasonable accommodations. union saying there? lot countries figured mass testing.

You sent list countries mass testing.

This means know refuse goddam point. Close proximity, mask drinking, loud talking, activity slows reaction judgement, seems like worst place be.

Look, trying start fight idea businesses house doctors... highest paid people states, nonprofit absurd.  

Care practitioners highest paid people states, executives are, insurance SOARING result. Sumone pay income right? 

Health insurance increasing lot different reasons, right for-profit healthcare system main culprit, lot executive went high school guy oncologist Dublin Ireland. makes nothing compared US oncologists he's happy lives lovely life. grew England.  Doctors comfortable, Uber rich like American doctors. US medical pay obscene.

I agree you, huge part medical pay high system also puts lot burden care providers NHS doesn't. providers (doctors nurses) US know, included, would gladly take pay cut meant better, lower-cost care patients better legal support care providers. big chunk paycheck goes towards health insurance like everybody else, also towards malpractice ran non profit 5 years. volunteered. one took salary. know real non profit works. please, assume know. 

My bad assuming, think ran different kind non-profit kind I'm talking nonprofit. (excepting, maybe, rural hospitals).

Literally every hospital United States for-profit unless they're rural area? seem dropped. 

This indicates actually engaging good faith. gonna waste time interested dropping mic actual agree that's huge problem totally want fix it. also contradict anything I've said prove original point objecting to.

So something pure conspiracy theory fismissed 20 years ago mainstream Gun permits unconstitutional reason voter ID would be. It‚Äôs people left care constitution it‚Äôs convenient. You‚Äôre expecting people solve problem child care next 4-6 weeks? Good luck. Holy mother God terrifying context put in. Wow. read whole article fast. might set speed reading record comprehension! Next time, read sources dismissing them. ""1-2% study within std deviation"" make sense study. 

First, know stdev study, cannot make statement difference ""within stdev"" (which even matter first place, study). 


Second, understand measuring. Please read actual study see I'm talking about. quantity question daily case rate, percentage, decrease two percentage points daily rate. state actual values say example, 10%, went two points 8%. (Side note, stdev would units % would value low 0.0000001% (for example) high 100%). *not* saying 10% daily rate decreased 2% 9.8%. 

This also shows make sense claim 2% within stdev. know stdev can't say that. change two percentage points could well 10 standard deviations away mean. Also note case mean published study attempt analyze mean stdev completely nonsensical. 

The study looked daily case rates before/after mask orders one geographical region. difference changes staistical comparison. 

Source: read study degree statistics. Pool testing make sense USA given... Pool testing would great countries handled things well, like say NZ.

In New Zealand could use pool testing sample large percentage population regular basis, conserving test resources. NZ bit less 5 million people would need perform 80k tests (assuming pools 64 people each) comprehensively test entire population confirm negative. impossible run many tests every single month!! imagine able go monthly test government announce sick individuals identified isolated. Everyone could go back life less normal virus knowledge.

This works know pool overwhelmingly likely give negative result. However USA much likely positives pools, point pool testing breaks start retesting subgroups pool sample. becomes much harder administer manage test, making sure right subgroups samples get mixed. takes time, isolate one person 64 sick, start contact tracing wasted days retests.

That effective. might well tell every person pool come get retested individually. US two million active cases, means pool testing going lead individually test hundred million people, sample mixed infected persons.... obviously could perform hundreds millions tests, need talking pool testing.

Additionally US high degree variability likelihood exposure.

* Wealthier professionals large homes, able isolate immediate extended families months little exposure risk. good health insurance, could already get tested, see need. risk exposure going doctor everyone interact healthy home three months.

* second group needs leave homes work, need contact others. would probably like tested, good health insurance, fuck them.

* third group plays russian roulette political reasons virus. Goodluck getting anything sensible them.

* really reason people get tested, symptoms, think may exposed. makes test positive rate much higher makes pool testing unworkable.

Unless right people get sick message gets particular group people county, persons supporters take seriously make impossible establish working testing system. Unless worry already sick, value going testing location, risking exposure yourself, protect others, people walking around would reciprocate. people test positive need hospitalized, however likely symptomatic simply asymptomatic people unlikely tested unless either know potentially exposed need work. think it‚Äôs region specific. Parts Europe opened schools safely without case spikes. 

The states handled virus wel grouping whole age group people stupid name. Florida 3k deaths. Texas 2300 deaths. NY 25k deaths. NY Fla amount people roughly. make masks

* material lab tested almost N95
* design lab tested pass respirator fit test

Then made supermasks extra layer material that's probably N99 filtration.

Course that's me. know anyone else who's that. It‚Äôs well-done modification classic joke.  found grandparents... ground love calling everyone sheeps basically lock step Tucker Carlson. mean Brook Baldwin Chris Cuomo gotten it, would suprised folks also got it. mean imply cared them, ordinary folks would catch it. difference freedom gun freedom haphazardly point gun anyone

Sadly, concerned rights focused ""freedom"" care (or cant) make distinction two month since rental freeze lifted. Pretty dumb move. Short answer: 01/20/2017 Hospital capacity can‚Äôt looked state level. hospitals fine hot zones hospitals may already full turning people away. Father‚Äôs Day last week. math. odd response. need wait weeks? say protests reason FL spiking? protests happened places time.   solve problem, instead boxing school equals childcare? Trevor A. Makal, associate professor chemistry University Virginia Wise, cleared masks block viruses even though don‚Äôt block fart smells.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs consider size molecules make stink smell farts,‚Äù says thread. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll focus one particular example, others similarly sized (when compared size virus). Methanthiol (CH3SH), like number thiol (-SH) containing molecules, smells! ‚Ä¶ smells like incredibly intense garlic; though many would say smells putrid. want everyone hate you, walk hallway carrying open container thiol compounds.‚Äù

Got it. Tiny, stinky fart molecules.

‚ÄúWell, CH3SH rather small molecule diameter around 4*10^-10 (0.4 nm, 1.6*10^-8 inches),‚Äù Makal continues. ‚ÄúBy comparison, viruses typically range diameter 20 nm 400 nm (J. Biol. Phys., 2013, 39(2), 215), COVID-19 around 60-140 nm (Cell. Mol. Immun., 2020). difference sizes COVID-19 virus common odorant farts 2-3 orders magnitude (100‚Äì1000 times diameter smaller methanethiol).‚Äù

Did get that? COVID-19 virus one hundred one thousand times bigger fart molecule. also please note Makal citing claims scientific journals. science. Fuckkkk even think fact days days... weeks? behind what's currently going freaks hell lol Natural selection everyone wants saved sadly Florida train wreck getting worse. Knowing people government, can't ascribe malice adequately explained actually posted sub week ago!   yet live literally one wearing mask. Walmart run masked course encountered 1 shopper wearing mask. Fucking 1 person besides store staff half weren‚Äôt wearing there‚Äôs right either. unbelievably fucked. Remove isn't. really bring race that? Could left last line bud funny, time thought likely going turn one accurate predictions ones thrown around back pandemic started. Aaaaaand wrong. also doesn‚Äôt explain increase hospitalizations. Miami never got far opening bars clubs.

Restaurants reopened 50% capacity May 18 cautious others care. mayor City Miami (who COVID!) recently photographed restaurant shut county several days later violating reopening requirements. mean like Vice-President today reporters suggested might good idea invite thousands people rallies right now? still how. isolate room use separate bathrooms. Ha ha ha ""Fuck coasters"" - love it! whats interesting least tenativly gets rid idea of, ""Well people buy stuff stores liquor stores can't go resteraunt."" No, 2 Girls 1 Cup nearly disgusting. It‚Äôs ok trump stole medical supplies case R states needed it... read although US sympathise. Even though may yet turned tide, life save makes difference. Keep fighting good fight. Toilet Paper hoarding restarts 96 hours Except largely seem case. reporting %positive cases?? Looking raw number cases dumb tells us nothing. Sad. Vote.  must idiot, hearing reports past several days: one made mention protests happening past several weeks??? Infections among young linked bars thousands kids protested arm-in-arm city-to-city nation wide (many little protection)? I'm saying valid reason people upset, clearly protests played role seeing. Let's hide this. Covid extremely infectious!! blows mind. want know? something respiratory really beat up, COVID, need take extra good care lungs may take time recover.

I actually happen me. went party February, got bad chest infection, hacking pieces week. highly suspicious weeks later may COVID. Kept social distance case. Obviously way getting test.

Was finally able get antibody test months later guess what: negative. I'm glad hell take chances. I'd gotten COVID heels another nasty respiratory infection, would even worse. case sign assets me. doubt it‚Äôs good precaution. Ha Ha Ha....Social responsibility? don\`t give shaite. want reptile brains tells them: eat, copulate, congregate, make fun others ""alpha"". sick thing pretty blue bar graph gonna even towards higher age groups folks go back home mingle. :| drive Colorado go social distance mountains? 24 hr car trip, air bnb rental. cancel Friday get anything back BLM liberals. Yes, they've destined property, killed people, worst all, perpetuate covid19. logic behind this. nonono solution country infected shithole get plane

Y'all leave polar bears alone suffered enough conspiracy subs gotten bad, infested right wing trolls propaganda, basically new T_D. country spiking. Several states spiking, contributing country‚Äôs total. 
 
Several states also declining cases. I'm calling liar, can't imagine there'd much echoing given he's full shit Lmfao calm bro, seems like you‚Äôre enjoying way much.  send PM person stop responding wanted dunk someone can't use apostrophes correctly. Protestors maybe? Definitely wasn‚Äôt point though see could read way. bet she'd run Florida better to. Reopening first wave help either. aren‚Äôt seeing happen. NY, least (huge pop center), trackers told connect dots. quite, weekend effect. Fewer tests weekends. I'm guessing live north east somewhere else temperate climate. experience school starts earlier year hotter areas. think idea end spring semester starts get extremely hot June (mostly issue after-school busing I'm guessing?).  enough people let alive vote? I‚Äôd imagine lot protests riots brother. tell give cash ever buy thing like tix concerts go use cred card. denying racism? 
That would like denying human nature lol. 


Do truly believe Floyd execution racially motivated? moronic, theory *could* possible decent correlation pointing direction regards temperature humidity. Clearly wrong though. know downvoted. Americans spend $$$ go overseas. tickets already grand. Plus grand hotel. need eat every night. adds up.

Lower-Middle class Americas going Europe vacation. lot prestigious institutions called lately including PNAS, U Stanford Lancet. considered world class institutions.

The fact prestigious school mean can't made mistake. like competitive sports cause sports banned

whats usas handicap? start career I'm stuck unemployed living parents can't even get unemployment can't get touch office officer refused case read law. 

I want shit get back work :( death rate dropping? isn‚Äôt bad? ever national park? Well Arizona hot spot fully believe that. Americans stupid What‚Äôs point. Assholes sitting packed bars sorry ‚Äúrestaurants‚Äù fucking night day mask around neck. Anything buck state motto. flip coin. really hope said monoxide doubly dumb. Well depends keep **6 feet** others. cloth face cover **not substitute** social would Obama stood angry mob voice reason, remind people protesting pandemic, regardless noble cause, **bad** not. I'm honestly disappointed, I've never disappointed large subset America care risking lives innocent prove point. didn‚Äôt be. 
Texas criteria case rate going down. wasn‚Äôt. opened anyway. good damn mind even think opening bars pandemic would wise decision?

can't people live temporarily without alcohol fix? start NJ/NY young folks. started middle aged folks traveled city, used mass transit, attended work conventions ect. one knew time bad ages public basically guidance ""wash hands."" made way nursing homes infected pretty much every single one. due young crowd hitting bars north east, simply know spreading like wildfire March. Us closed borders chinese aplogizers first?

Tell effective need anything else... party would never recover that. RIP New York retirees. baby! Suck Wuhan! bring everything need smallest amount human interaction outside bubble, going another month worry, going. mother fucker getting shut Fair question.

[Country compared land masses number cases per square mile, ‚Äúgoing out‚Äù would similar chance someone area create transmission vector.

Of course France much higher population, per square mile would even people could leap Frances case. probably contributed sky rocketing France Texas spreading slowly now. that‚Äôs reason spread quicker France, reason still exists wouldn‚Äôt advisable less restrictions Texas.

Quick data referencing earlier find links:

**Active cases**

Texas: 64,117

France: 57,807

12% difference (similar France slightly **better**)


**Total Cases**

Texas: 142,760

France: 162,936

14% difference (similar France slightly **worse**)


**Total Deaths**

Texas: 2,367

France: 30,000

1267% difference (France astronomically worse, relevant total cases similar, per capita below)


**Deaths per million pop**

Texas: 82

France: 456

556% difference (France 5 times worse per death per pop)


**Death rate identified cases**

Texas: 1.6% death chance 98.4% recovering

France: 18.4% death chance 81.6% recovering

1160% difference (France astronomically worse, ten times likely die France get coronavirus Texas.) let her. countersue bad. Texas pretty much kept economy open whole time. rolled things back declared ""WORSE"" overall economy. Clearly yet enough data make determination, although may well prove true 6 months now. Maybe harsh. level comment stupid respond it. made mean comment believe know better. completely in-line thoughts matter February. world South Korea, New Zealand. long ICU's packed, overwhelming scheme all, close it, almost nothing left except hope swift vaccine. 

You're literally forgetting learning virus months ago. It‚Äôs feel-good article don‚Äôt see anything substantive didn‚Äôt know before. Worked OK monkeys, large human trials starting. OK. trial results, I‚Äôll reason pay attention. so

Not problem. didn‚Äôt happen, we‚Äôre good.
 said. made argument you‚Äôre making.
 
Okay, let‚Äôs run back.
 
My ‚Äúmade argument‚Äù: You‚Äôre simultaneously saying extremely high density areas people safe distance fine, states operate.‚Äù 
 
Our discussion subject:
 (You) actually brain damaged think riots didn‚Äôt massive impact new COVID-19 cases
 (Me) answer specific parts US spiking? [because, discussed, protests occurred country] 
 (You) Different states operate differently. doesn‚Äôt matter slightest.
 
Can point misunderstood?
 knew /r/politics users weren‚Äôt smartest take cake.
 
Classic. Personal attacks, referencing dive comment history. Nailed it.
 said huge density people safe distance cause virus spread even exactly happened riots. 
 
*According what*?
 actually disagree statement? 
 
I absolutely, 100%, emphatically truthfully whole heart disagree assertion **protests** (because, discussed, haven‚Äôt riots since first week protests; end May) ‚Äúcontributing extremely‚Äù spread virus. yet present actual data sound logic believe case. what‚Äôs explanation done? Seems stifle fact protests added spike. OK.

Freedom free.

Sometimes gotta kill brown people, sometimes gotta kill grandmas.

I make rules. wonder Starbucks pools tips? That's see many gravestones Halloween. Trick treaters dead carbon dioxide caused masks. step right direction enough. bar manager see happening restaurants around going become bars I'm going lose bar. Every restaurant around serves alcohol almost every person talked today left walked street sit table drink. 

Its frustrating know bar keeping rules restaurant street full capacity weeks (completely unchecked) we're ones shit aren't. 

Its complicated situation peoples lives important money. need shutdown directing bars redirects people want go ignore safety safety other. Lmfao u trying make points far off, doesnt work make sense. U said ""kill people like you"". Gj.

And tell me, full? Empty? dont go take look! Well, think Newsom genuinely care, like he's trying bail ocean mop bucket. People businesses know quarantine shutdown anyway, want anyway, even legally required. really every man this. Well damn. least expected Bible Belt state. Stay safe! believe denial? It‚Äôs infuriating cites declining number deaths something optimistic about. 

Deaths take 2-4 weeks peak cases! 

We‚Äôre seeing daily deaths flatten right like daily new cases started flatten couple weeks ago. suggest won‚Äôt sharp increase deaths within next month outright dishonest. raging forest fire. mistake it‚Äôll hit they‚Äôll close, repeating cycle causation purposefully hidden push narrative. coming sense. believe SCIENTISTS reported noticeable spikes due protests.... know people protested covid. mean caught there. people still tonight? Surely heard news ICU 100% capacity now. ‚ÄúB-but god made mouth breath! Masks Satan Bill gates! poked? Sounds good useful. Now, secretly put vaccine track control people NWO....get back me. California closes people get mad they're slowing going back work. Newsom holding another lockdown. Plus Californian economy can't handle another lockdown state government declare budget emergency it. Little low.  source irrelevant it‚Äôs presenting fact, bud. NYC literally telling trackers ask positive cases attended rally. It‚Äôs posts opinion... Fuck Trump fuck retarded ass conservatives. murderers. guy even run governor? money power? certainly wasn‚Äôt keep people Florida safe. don‚Äôt presidents fight always send poor?

- SOAD would‚Äôve thought fucking scientists right. Oh yeah fucking hoax bed China whatever according middle America. worry stay home fall well. Yes, stupid leftist protesters reason increasing cases -- can't believe made top /all thanks pointing morons out! Meanwhile Trump - ""We need slow testing!"" Yeah, is. cities fly to/from?
 Marxists love causing death really. largest Mormon congregations probably around 300 people. lot megachurches caused major problems hold services 1000+ one time. problem Mormons typically devout social. means everyone shows every single Sunday get together Wednesday youth activities miss sick town.

There's feasible way protect students, especially classrooms hallways packed. need stop testing then. cause number cases go down! assure outdoor dining parks impact BUT... U.S. Constitution says that.... gotta wear mAsK

/s Fellow North Carolinian, presume? Maybe older individual COPD heart failure ultimately physician. Unfortunately group patients asking mask exemption letters. young healthy patients like wearing masks. standards guidelines medical conditions aggravated wearing masks. way see risk wearing mask greater risk aggravating medical condition wearing mask. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* could enema shots mask agree stupid...and don‚Äôt take side I‚Äôll present case. 

But truly think 99% Reddit zero clue Florida‚Äôs economy works. ZERO state income tax all. MUST tourism service industry exist. whole house cards comes tumbling without tourism service industry. mention borderline slave labor agricultural conditions, corruption, staggering inequality...Florida major problems. 

Lots places say ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt close down‚Äù varying degrees truth. But, man, Florida...with tourism restaurants. 

Not saying won‚Äôt even worse now, saying shouldn‚Äôt smarter. But, really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs they‚Äôre ‚Äúall stupid‚Äù...they literally can‚Äôt shut down. That‚Äôs fragile economic house cards there. really think people actually believe scientists, want admit loud give fuck Americans dying. pretend believe science anti-intellectualism palatable Americans. see ludicrous display last night ?

My kids school decided two days ago they‚Äôre opening- want kid there. I‚Äôm single parent school, it‚Äôll definitely interesting see plays out. So... can‚Äôt explain logic? 

*any factual occurrence disagree trolling!! Because... well say so!*

Oof. entered lockdown 3 months stayed home flatten curve, wear face masks, maintain social distancing wash hands.. I'm glad done HHS instead White House. never made partisan political matter.

THAT SAID... dumbass needs make statement, reinforced coming days weeks months, TAKE SERIOUSLY. 

No interjecting blame. politics. propagandizing. rants. ""everyone please take seriously"" etcetera etcetera.

Why? Because, task force involve help, would even effective he'd get side board taking seriously, wearing masks, distancing, etcetera.

But he's wrung hands issue campaigning taken care (and followers) need masks.

He actively damaging efforts government contain even he's part task force. care apologizes think could ever convinced take responsibility, needs pivot stop this. bullshit approach work work time either.

Accept loss, change tune even never admit fault, get board saving people. Arizona. Don‚Äôt forget Arizona separate? close proximity one another owned company. ask? I'd contact already done looking regarding outdoor transmission. mask proper distance, would incredibly difficult become infected outside. zero risk, small enough we'd willing take it.

I'd mostly avoiding contact parents risk factors too, live us, that's exactly feasible. honestly, can't entirely cut social contact next year half. Right now, outdoors seems like good compromise. Rule number 1 governing people always assume 90% complete idiots. Florida needs mandatory mask wearing business need refuse people non compliance. Fines need issued public parks people wearing mask too. Schools
Must remain closed august. Restaurants bars need carry only. need safety everyone. Don‚Äôt selfish America think sub filled actual people ? Lol. 

Theyre mostly paid plants downvote anything doesnt push narrative everythings falling apart. Damn man, I'm sorry hear that. tested either, ive lucky enough show major symptoms remember, though fair really tell corona symptoms apart fever respiratory distress. 

And despite feeling mostly alright past month close proximity certainly positive assumed one ones remained asymptomatic due kick ass overall health. also im probably oblivious physiological changes body unless get hit fuckin hard. I'm amazed Brazil even capacity test many people per day. actually pretty good capacity? cases simply much higher ones detect still amount many? I'm loser baby... kill wish Canada ever. never terrified live US. work general public every day. Risking life people buy frivolous luxuries. customers rarely wear masks allow 6 ft social distancing. terrified starting show symptoms. might choose paycheck potentially exposing everyone around me. I'm already behind bills want hurt anyone. mostly confused young people science deniers also think big deal effect personally. maybe could something disinfectant. keep hearing kills virus seconds. maybe something internally, like cleaning.



~the fucking president Texas worse NYC Texans live dense cities. DFW, Houston, San Ant, El Paso, Austin. one month see Abbot crying Trump federal support rare possibility mass graves. future history building software programs comb internet‚Äôs vast amount data search algorithms.

The historian still important, future historians need tech savy data aggregation. want get Mr Bones' Wild Ride results 7 days longer, according website. I‚Äôm going stick appointment, since test results quicker. wait time like that, doesn‚Äôt really make difference wait Sunday. Get usa Everything looks perfect!!! Great numbers! 
 Hope they're ready shit storm coming August tell Americans ""stop lazy, looking handouts get job"". Because, know, we've become ""reliant"".

30+million people work hungry good outcome.
How TF entire group people turn pandemic political battle?!?! I've never unbelievably disgusted completely powerless life! 
I would love nothing leave house go work! I'm high risk pretty much certain death. I'll also need eat help feed family. either stay home starve go work around city full people believe hoax risk catching dying ending million dollar bill another form death! Yep.

Sorry Europe üôè would never imagine party passing 120 000 American lives jokes go streets protest listen treated coronavirus feburary march...if havent seen now, dont know tell cause clearly never get it.  Governor Newsom charging ahead anything...I hate sensationalized news articles. 

California massive state population equal 20+ states combined. We've got significantly different circumstances happening 163,696 mi¬≤ state. state government create guidance open. counties access unique data region assess open. 

Counties move somewhat faster state moving reopen, data area supports that. also move slower -- look Alameda County Imperial County. smart path forward, state diverse. rural county 200 cases total treated exactly urban county 2k cases?  That's something that's mind

There going people think fake, last thoughts hooked machines hospital going wrong trackers told ask positive persons attended protest? causation don‚Äôt allow relevant causation question asked.

WANT MR. BONES' WILD RIDE unwillingness admit, personally media, giant spike due large protests scary. People may care politics, virus doesn't. Yes without doubt cases apart spike due opening back people socializing, adhering guidelines, ect... gonna act like protests blame.

I tested idea Minneapolis case reports wrong. surprising need search Minneapolis COVID dashboard.  they're testing many people. slow testing down, get less positive cases. Basic math. Duuuur Can't wait hitch ride new Corona Coaster! Doesn‚Äôt really matter ‚Äútrue‚Äù death rate is.

One things matter much. fuck guys office? order encourage everyone working home can?

It takes eight weeks deaths tallied reported graph link complete end May June. However, experiencing 20-40% increase expected deaths every week last year. huge incredibly emberassing american right now. truly disgusted people deserve every bit happening us. people idea think virus hoax. state report nursing home deaths weekly, I'm fairly certain lag like deaths. state reports cumulative hospitalizations COVID, current. Vote! Get rid science denying morons save lives Omg, read ""increasing demand cannibals!"" brain followed ""I see coming!""  think ever done original surge yet  Canadians Americans operate differently. probably didnt need province wide mandate. definitely people morons would rank population?

Florida also reopened cases increasing. always knew we'd end here.

And powerless would feel Besides giving $275/week Florida, also lasts 12 weeks. anybody started mid-March would done year now. 

I think temporarily added, what, 6 weeks? means person would done $600 end July, ALSO $250. Always appeal male psyche. UUUUGH. tiring. giving Trump supporters much credit. make half population country. truthfully minority case supporters vs non-supporters. much vocal, first join rally without masks. window lickers see memes videos.

Yes. he's impossible defeat. follows eviction protections lifted, percentage evicted 30 days, people struggling close fail line might take 60 90. unemployment sky high job market largely isnt functional, doesnt take genius see coming Hahaha wow hurt badly called ignorant moron endangers others he/she can‚Äôt handle keeping social distance wearing mask ? love people like . hope stupidity ignorance doesn‚Äôt cause anyone die. still know ins outs, despite that, use yet another hammer try bash Sweden with.

hehe sure we're fucked big time. I'm central valley local level people going wear masks unless enforced. People building finally started sent mass email start wearing them. Even then, still really enforced department level. week ago person floor wearing one. course real plan terms opening everything back up. tell sat ass local level almost much federal level. article specify numbers many protesters got infected. can't make conclusion without data. true person testing positive counted twice Nah CEOs age limit. thinking Sure, again, number interested in.

""It'll disappear own, like magic."" Outdoors + masks = lower risk

Indoors - masks = higher risk

Politics = zero India handling much better population, density worse healthcare. compare India 500,000 deaths considering population 4 times US. Yeah, am. Yep. matter Orange Menace WH even listen scientific advisors refuses wear mask imploring loyal followers wear one either. could try /r/china_flu almost exclusively racist American politics. Unfortunately people can't safely take vaccines provide immunity, people autoimmune disorders people immunosuppressants transplants. people need rely others let down. Add another layer. three layers takes 0 almost N95, think another layer would take to?

* [Source [Source seen nearly written yet. even estimstes many people become homeless? could huge disaster waiting happen. research. can't catch covid 0 active cases end country canada lol. increase nothing protests  little pet theory many people poor ability simply breathe wearing mask actually raises carbon-dioxide blood enough actually give flight-or-flight response. 


Its highly cynical, half people workplace decided would rather breathe little easier wear one. Trump's fault. much due testing? Amusement parks casinos open yet am, stage 3 province stage 2. province 2nd cases Canada unfortunately. 111 cases today, restaurants opened pickup/takeout, eating patio. went pickup food today employees properly wearing masks, big plastic screens across counters, little circles floor indicate people stand maintain proper distancing. suspect everywhere places follow proper procedure fined closed. case all. Stop trying make sound like rest world fucked bad US did. viral concentration waste water good enough kind thing? know sewage tested positive. mean samples taken treatment plant used reliably. Jfc Thanks! Hopefully they've separated data since then. look percent tests positive account this. restaurants town lax masks. One much Health Department paid serious visit.

The town liquor store? Gawd help walk without mask. tackle bundle door without second hesitation. Ya suppose defining theme park differently would mind. Disneyworld. actually 115k Americans considering asymptomatic mild cases think fact everyone staying indoors everything closed. basically shut entire world, 7 months would millions deaths point. flu season. nah, motherfuckers defend police every chance can. 

just wait man, police turn them, see weakening state come ideology Fucking Antima terrorists see, Administration sort forgot coronavirus. can‚Äôt listen you‚Äôre ripping ears shoving asshole. Jesus dude I‚Äôm sorry. can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre actually extending stimulus stuff like extra unemployment money. It‚Äôs fucking wild. Sometimes stop look state world especially US it‚Äôs like get here. hope guys ok, stay safe don‚Äôt much you‚Äôre ever bind need help feel free message me! &lt;3  forget shuffling kids classes 5-7 times day. (they still middle/high schools, right?) maximum contacts. I‚Äôve isolating possible, socially distancing, wearing mask whole time. FUCK trying say I‚Äôm part ‚Äúme‚Äù crowd. noticed jumped around 600 cases almost 1k today. That‚Äôs worrisome. settings crowds, plenty coverage showed protesters wearing masks left right. protests also conducted outdoors, relatively safer closed environment. account everyone every protest? No, can't. protests probably contribute degree, maybe much may fear. contact tracing data would needed back up. 

However, people partying bar may susceptible spreading. likely wearing mask bar, also relatively enclosed environment based around food drink.  also expect person sitting bar concerned precautions either. Again, contact tracing data would better support though. attest this. gf moved cross country CO VA ( plans set lockdowns follow through) time Missouri Kansas kinda terrifying. masks, people eating indoors restaurants almost social distance. Like idiots VA felt activity judged Kansas wore masks. baffling me. Even KY better. like everyone protesting right now. People went known risks. definitely gonna happen unless plan compensate people stay home kids school Depends death rate is.. 1% cases today die us that‚Äôs 470. it‚Äôs young healthy people aren‚Äôt showing many symptoms catching it‚Äôs possible. hospitals get overrun like Texas think we‚Äôll looking county. choose one Jesus Fuck Henderson County Wester North Carolina. actually misremembering, wasn‚Äôt chief police sheriff talking entire county... mean guess consider Disneyworld. true, problems taking advantage situation making worse either. 1. everyone wearing mask maintaining distance, probably low risk. I'd expect blood drive pretty strict enforcing medical guidelines.
2. That's relatively normal, also reason exponential growth quickly overwhelms capacity. Jfc you‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs exactly like that. It‚Äôs cause head empty, it‚Äôs always echoing. busted laughing saying Muh Riaghts loud, thank kind sir! Written by: Peter Berg

Trump could used entire pandemic advantage pushed towards maybe winning November. 

He could made defeating Covid 19 national challenge, ""If real American to, wear mask kill virus"". could given free MAGA masks everyone free advertising. 

What would outcome? would country looking strong like wants perceived, would stronger ever voter base due thinking trump single handedly solved pandemic maybe economy would bounced back faster. 

But no. denied issue, made COVID political, actively avoids problem together. 

What idiot. China lied, China covered up. China bad. gotta stop testing! like president said! got owned hahahahaha ü§£ü§£ü§£ I‚Äôm 30s, I‚Äôm coming four months came mild case - lungs still fucked up.

I think US fudging numbers... happen Beijing though people scared it, gets nearby region. They'll see people bringing in, they'll see pop up. rates tremendous many ""no maskers"" feel consequences.

Even asymptomatic people lung damage issues, longer term. 

How long take Stubborns change? change. rest us hang safely can. Karens way down! far, appears contributed. Coronaviruses somewhat tricky make vaccines mutate. possible always need booster. start driving around cars sporting Mad Max Hairstyles fashion? Beijing reported like 20 new cases whole country lost shit. Meanwhile chilling 40k day still debating wear masks. Bravo. Imagine blaming president people marching protesting social distancing wearing mask. impose martial law enforce people ""right"". like dump ass people. Saved msg. Great links Imagine stupid blame huge spike cases Southern states (who reopened early restrictions) BLM protests üòÇ incoming tide dwarf anything felt before

Do source this? states hard time controlling spread point, others demonstrating correct way deal this. states playing ""we're better puny disease"" game learn nature care egos, they'll institute measures (some cities counties states already have) they'll improve situation time.

It really look like program strict mask wearing combined aggressive contact tracing go long, long way. Surely it‚Äôs fault!? 

Lol suck. salons least everyone involved wear mask. nature, everyone unmasked shoving things faces restaurant. nobodys tested virus exist.
Nobody virus dont know Texas .. Lone Czar State.

Murderer Imagine stupid blame huge spike cases Southern states (who reopened early restrictions) BLM protests üòÇ tell people something it. know shit going buddy. I'm hoping CFR comes least little. try optimistic.

It's 5% right US. let's optimistic say drops to....3 % bulk people 18-55 1% (most 45). People 55 dying less higher rate.

That means 1-2 months, death rates about...15,000 day? Entirely possible.

Let's say I'm actually doomsayer. 1% CFI. 4700 deaths per day, slightly declining rate (because people freak stay home) 30,000 deaths per week. 120,000 month - long time point, many things changing dramatically.

It'll either get far better far worse. get choose.  Dont forget election year. doubt true death toll even spoken about. mean looks kinda bad record 100 thousand dead reign.
And funnily enough, america stopped recording deaths records 2 weeks ago, protests began.so 120k dead. 2 weeks later 2k deaths? Yet skyrocketing infection rates? Something isnt right Compared Sweden press ask officials softball questions actually became minor scandal ""crazy German"" was, GASP, asking questions aggressive manner since Done. 

Your tin foil dumb always. 

The German asked questions Swedish media simply true Swedes conformist lot.

This makes sense ever, anti-swedish feelings taking over. extreme conformity really evident media, esp. one compares Danish press conferences Swedish press conferences. Q&amp;A Danish pressers often downright uncomfortable sometimes since press hammers officials hardball questions. 

Again, clearly never watched swedish press conference, maybe even danish one. pure fantasy time start crack, party leader debate COVID June 7th 2/3 Nordics already opposition parties successfully get investigations launched ruling government. 

Utter lie. swedish opposition going course person research, actively encourage everyone read sides topic new them. I've provided start

Except current data says isn‚Äôt cause. go anywhere nation find trash laughing people's misfortune. tend also able hold job. think Cuomo needs get high horse bit. Sure Florida's Gov dick. California Washington sent ventilators everyone trying bolster supplies. 

None us this. middle basically got delayed first wave. West reopened weeks early turning point. scientists predicting months get second wave soon.  Hey Dan Brown writes good thrillers!!! must US cuz would obvious. masks lockdown ever really happened Gates going vaccinate us 5g trackers Soros somehow behind it. frogs gay. Hillary's emails. Anything Obama. Perhaps base learn rules fuckin vent shoved throats. 

smdh dead bodies tested anymore idea. keep seeing articles folks testing water systems- never see national coordination published data type thing. Lol Nice. dont fully agree funwheeldrive think good news bad news:

Good news: Less people dying due better treatments. testing means people know it, motivate reasonable people stay home, minimize transmission risk.

Bad news: Despite better treatments, point future, certain parts US risk hospitals overwhelmed, puts EVERYONE affected area risk, health condition, COVID. beyond scary.....I fear matter time happens somewhere. 

Unfortunately COVID, contagious, high case volume could mean lot deaths despite better treatments based high number cases. acknowledge it‚Äôs odd restrict extremely relevant question asked trying ‚Äúaccurately‚Äù track covid spread? Oh yeah like califor- Kminder 3 months! seen media, [Cassandra Truth courtesy TV Today shocking, wasnt one mask! DeSantis must missed semi-viral town hall meeting videos prove Florida (Wo)man make good decisions.... live lake county, people wear masks store tried require lasted half day. back giving shit. Even word virus misread virgin COVID19 vs. ChAdOx1 one inject asbestos? ::turns Dr. Birx:: Murican TrumpieDumbies: ‚ÄúMy freedom important lives!‚Äù fuck talking about? Lmao people padlocked apartment buildings Wuhan?   Don‚Äôt care, still voting Trump. shit really playing like game plague die mean fuck up.

This.

That's always get flu shot.

Why feel like death able come work week (if job week's worth paid sick leave, lost wages) get shot protected it?

Currently, paranoid comes COVID-19. catch it, think would definitely sent home weeks. lol DeSantis can't make good decisions, trusting people elected great choice. must severe cognitive dissonance them. hope wrong. city actually named ""Kansas City"". 

The fun question is: city Kansas City, Kansas city Kansas City, Missouri? actually free certain places, proving broken country is. ya covids even real flu lol Also there's notation dawn helps clean glasses defog them.. Knox County numbers Tennessee stayed relatively low length pandemic thus far. However, 4 last 5 days highest amount new cases day since pandemic started. 3 new daily records week. Cases went 30% week alone. except now. need loan pause rent unfair lmao. pathetic. life isn‚Äôt money. business isn‚Äôt worth night sleep ur piece shit acting like is. ur selfish ur lying think aren‚Äôt Resources limited. Every dollar spend testing dollar spend masks. I‚Äôm sorry but, you‚Äôre country full idiots run idiots. Seeing pics social media bars NJ Shore packed. learned nothing. always saying, ""the south rise again""? one strangest misunderstandings time. 

Putin likes little body hair, wanted fund anti-wax movement. goddamn accent rest.  Coronavirus loves employment. Enclosed spaces great spread. would doubt that. last longer year two absolute worst, kids return school coming isolation treat socialization. can't imagine much fun would small kids get play sports games work groups years this.

To use phrase haphazardly, going character building lot young people. take years normalcy school prison perceived before. mild case, would moderate case. /u/BabyEatersAnonymous. 

Mild case: barely symptoms, maybe slight cough low fever, similar cold

Moderate case: Similar flu, really anything actually hospitalized people. still brutal body leave bedridden weeks. 

Severe Case: Hospitalized, need oxygen, likely problems happening organ systems. 

Critical: ICU. likely die. 

According antibody test results, 30-40% asymptomatic another 30-40% mild. anecdote family got (9 people infected) 8 mild 1 moderate case, ton friends got mild too. cases exactly representative everybody gets non-hospitalized case. Many people even know presume slight cough headache, makes dangerous. wearing masks. Barely got back short trip grocery store burger joint (Fry's &amp; In-n-Out) Gilbert, roughly 1/3 people wearing face coverings despite Maricopa county mandate. 

Can please start shutting shit like Texas Florida? greedy man waste money wasty thing, reason gives computers Africans force buy softwares, blind see thing wants gain mind mass, beside fact never went warzone gloriously like Caesar reminds lot Caesar. dangerous man, know almost exactly similar virus prediction like COVID-19? dangerous. incredibly naive. virus care causes people gather for. think terrible strong word this, yes , wrong direction sure would bad? way better nothing all. idiot something? I‚Äôm saying definitely happened. said it‚Äôs possibility spike cases partially due protesting Fear Fear Fear Fear Fear Fear Universities going pushing in-person schooling. attend FSU UF you‚Äôre getting experience? It‚Äôs hard comprehend people shouting ‚Äúyou fucking wrong moron!!!‚Äù right. USA #1

üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ I‚Äôm expert, get booster every three months means unlike flu shot, need visits doctor multiple times year instead once. means nothing more, nothing less. cause social distancing masks forever? 

A Covid-19 vaccine likely make virus unable infect vaccinated person. infect, virus certainly easier fight off. So, even whole world gets infected, many people would die. However, virus run dry eventually. Imagine world three months, COVID-19 could spread, except unvaccinated. doesn‚Äôt take 12 weeks recover almost every case hospitals would almost back normal. So, coronavirus becomes minor problem. three months run out, infect people haven‚Äôt taken booster yet, sure. However, would lost lot momentum would need infect world again. virus grows again, people trickle local doctor take booster again. took US two months virus real threat. probably grace period month virus spread without social distancing masks world still fine. booster taken again, great, virus hold another 3 months! Repeat forever becomes routine, like seeing dentist every 6 months, everything back normal. 

Now, expensive maintain vaccine booster isn‚Äôt cheap manufacture, many poorer places infrastructure doctors support operation, many communities fine. Anti-vaxxers harbor virus, develop antibodies, die, spread it. spread it, it‚Äôs fine, since everyone else vaccinated, rendering virus weak. 


Sure, one scenario, see future real, functioning vaccine lasts short certain duration changes nothing. ‚Äúherd‚Äù immunized without deaths. brief respite virus starve it. lasts forever, COVID-19 eventually mutate weaker strand eventually easier spread unvaccinated, rendering even docile. vaccine means return business usual, even need booster week matter. Keep hand sanitizer car... I'm going risk it. point driving mask feel safe so. also switch back forth multiple pair glasses ( RX sunglasses regular glasses).. Masks. Masks, masks, masks, masks...

That's answer everything. Masks mean open economy usual, exception activities prevent mask usage restaurants bars. 

Instead, south decided claim virus hoax masks attack freedom. guess they'll learn two options: a) open masks, b) open without masks, pretend pandemic over, go back lockdown see learned option option a. He's living big house, painted white. can't give details would break sub's policy rules. health care workers? People must taking disinfectant injections bulbs ass. wondering this.  link data? Rich cunts want disposable cannon fodder back factory. Eventually virus runs new people infect Every ounce noble sacrifice struggling people still right thing lockdown wasted. let stupidest selfish among us take lead, fucked us. Ive started biz nothing. never asked government loan start. worked ass off, apparently know means. would idiot leave money table better help people. Again, lack maturity business acumin even scratch surface. Quarantine staying home long convenient you.

/s ‚ÄúI feel discriminated against‚Äù hahahahahahahah

Can picture caption idiot. Along anti face mask peoples future people search word ‚Äúidiot‚Äù face pop out? injecting partisan bullshit.

LMAO. started racist support it? This. waiting 10 days phone call yet. I‚Äôve read/heard wearing mask cuts infection risk half. seems imply 66,000 die current trends continue unabated. I‚Äôm probably grossly over-simplifying. case, 66,000 seems like low estimate 4 months go numbers we‚Äôve already seen. missing?  Wait, not? automatic 20% bump immunity (ignoring time creation/distribution) save countless lives improve herd?

Shit, 20% effective, insane would gamble rejecting vaccine favor hypothetical next vaccine may may right around corner? Wow. listened... Dec/Jan again, know time around. say New York got caught flat footed. can't say dumbasses/ idiots Florida/ Texas/ AZ. see pictures WW2 Vets boats staring beaches hail fire shells they're go into...  feel first weeks driving work, every single day. first weeks feel eerily comfortable, eventually start noticing littler things missed, dismissing would ifs, fix them, relaxing little should, news others profession .....  yeah, reasons concerned. insanity tell you. Oct 1, 2022... apartment complex Mexico City 30% Chinese nationals living 500 apartments. Since Mexico city shut they've wearing masks, socially distancing, provided masks guard staff giving away masks cost anyone needed them. community really great job acted examples complex see way proper mask adherence neighbors compared walk around block. 18th commandment/ ammendment ""thou shalt forcefully wear masks""  Suddenly I'm thinking pizza eating donning protective armor. yes, PhD microbiology/immunology.

Got ITT Tech time?  relevant anything happening failed policies?

Just call Governor. Lock everything down. can't nice things anymore. tried failed America. Try two weeks.

At least we're best something! /s still growing test capacity? think early on, shortage tests meant tests sick people, many COVID know it. testing improving, looks like less deadly. kid starts kindergarten fall nightmare scenario. snowing out. Repay it. even talked fines/jail time cases fraud really doubt they'll jail anyone. look closely come tax season 2021. mean clear website exact things meet get it. wife eligible (hadn't worked long time) unfortunately would stupid apply anyways take - course they'd paw back.

So calmly read requirements, basically legitimately put work covid like many were, fine, people lied probably sweating. plan work quarantine people live high risk people. can‚Äôt pretend boyfriend don‚Äôt exist, don‚Äôt take situations like account selective quarantine go far. don‚Äôt think anyone followed guidelines since started. Texas Florida certainly didn‚Äôt came reopening look now. 
No, wish do-over. civil.

Also, original point was, funny 2 months ago jackass going out, support people going out, horrible person?

That seems sidestepped injecting partisan bullshit.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* massive protests la couple weeks ago. didn‚Äôt help numbers. Thank voice reason. fked dam brazil like 50% positivity rate tho RIP two scenarios:

A) got rally, means someone infected rally.

B) went rally, means someone infected rally.

Kind splitting hairs we? sorry, enough June left try tough 50k Well, there's plenty data readily available shows biggest spikes right started Southern states reopened early, well protests even started.

So, want point blame, start there. 5 weeks meant whole thing, 2 weeks symptoms 3 weeks die symptoms.

Even using numbers still minimum 19 days die first infection(5 days contact symptoms 14 days death). That's still 3 weeks sizeable lag. maximum using numbers 25 days(6 days infection 19 days death) still lag 3 half weeks.

The point deaths caused actions today tallied least 2 3 weeks. Even full lockdown implemented today numbers dead continue go 2 3 weeks way stop them.. want hear regret leadership. want hear say magic phrase:

""Wear fucking mask. Please. pay fine."" We've 7593 total. post made cry. realize stressed covid calamity causing me. live rural community 120 miles Houston 45 minutes Austin San Antonio. I‚Äôm scared fellow humans. young adult children. physician husband coughed covid positive pt today. want people care. wear damn mask social distance. want see elderly mother lives 5 hours away. need turn tide.
Thank caring.  mentioned also, kind society created life threatening pandemic secondary race religion certain degree human rights

You ask people streets screaming Black Lives Matter excoriating anybody doesn‚Äôt toe extremely precise line thought. exact people saying weren‚Äôt ‚Äúin together‚Äù black people specifically disproportionately affected virus, everyone else‚Äôs suffering sacrifices meant shit. It‚Äôs like pathological need always considered underdog attention focused them. It‚Äôs fucking childish absolutely contributes disunity that‚Äôs produced numbers. personally think human rights trumps everything since encompasses many issues free speech right live safety security

Idealism Enlightenment great viruses science doesn‚Äôt change it‚Äôs cause agree with. There‚Äôs legitimacy left pinning republicans encouraged worse behaviour two weeks ago. least reopenings slightly measured (reduced capacity places, certain protocols needing least exist, etc.,) opposed ‚Äúlet‚Äôs pack many people possible downtown core scream we‚Äôre standing shoulder-to-shoulder. 
As far virus concerned, equivalent attending orgies 80s AIDS epidemic order show support gay community. Except disease doesn‚Äôt even require touch someone‚Äôs junk catch it. I‚Äôm sure jeopardizes right safety security everyone people protestors come contact with, number we‚Äôd know [if contact tracers would even ask think trump win again? Anotha one! Probably although normal viruses become mild mutate (not always). Interesting, hypothesis why? Exactly, let‚Äôs learn mistake neighbours south fly much for? 42,000 today. wish joke nope. gets gets worse day day. Yeah, they're open midnite noon. Cowpunchers gotta get libations. think problem believe real. mind laughing mass death mind political hoax. know people think that. global pandemic. Bruh sounded like post history would look like didn‚Äôt purge it. He's going find out. Alot people learn hard lessons ignoring real science.  Must reported officals, prohibited? Oh yes sorry didn‚Äôt mean already max capacity, also still quite ways away flu season, trends continue quite hospitals, all, already pretty maxed out. 

My worry won‚Äôt see correlating lesser amount people sick Fall, see exponentially cases Corona due already rampaging around country. talking USA course, familiar enough countries handling even speculate them. live Netherlands. Ad hoc ICU‚Äôs needed empty now. back normal ICU capacity. New COVID patients entering hospitals manageable rate.

In meantime business created plans new ‚Äò1,5 meter economy‚Äô. Restaurants, hotels, stores, fitness centers implement ways keep people 1,5m apart. extra terrassen, stores one-way-routes. White circles drown grass fields/parks tell people sit. business cooperating want reopen. Public transportation place masks required. 

We don‚Äôt consider virus control flatten curve trying keep flat. virus flares go back tintje way was. 

We together. 

PS
And yes. also people want stop 1,5m rule think restrictive. seems make possible reopen without real issues. shit bill. Lol call BS. Please kind polls week 31 July, free money dries out. downvoters said animals. ^ thing evolution really survival. reproduction. guy children, he's already success evolutionarily. 

I idea given enough time birth control evolve human population towards short term thinking, lack risk avoidance, low impulse control. People think consequences use birth control probably fewer children.

Bad outlook. Everybody risk. bought fake Fox News media narrative younger people risk, too? Sure. may die. good portion require excess medical care. Next thing know, health insurance premium quadruples recover costs. situation like Houston happens ICU wards slammed resulting excess mortality necessarily covid incidents also require ICU care.

I get it. bright. parroting nice man TV said without able think critically yourself. time let adults actually know what's going make informed decisions. fake Fox News media. Ratacoronouille filtered N95 HEPA filter whatever Green flair next vaccine updates? = Chubbed Fuck yeah. let‚Äôs enforce fulgencio batista mausoleum

( previously known florida )

it Fucking guy. finally ""overweight"" instead ""obese"" well (according BMI least) big milestone me! Keep great work. Nice. Lol I'm getting crossbow soon I've always wanted one. better time right!?!  cite, please? live LA pretend isn‚Äôt massive problem pseudo science would mistake. would say good 70 percent people age (early 30s) believe unironically astrology. 

Steve Jobs died believing alternative cures cancer. 

Just cause smart, doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt fall dumb stuff. 

Most people know LA starting hang together pretend pandemic real, over. almost businesses aren‚Äôt corporate, trust lmao ICU beds includes trained staff necessary equipment (vents, monitors)/ regular hospital beds done come with. Nurse patient ration 2 :1, critical 1;1. think it‚Äôs entirely unrealistic sit around wait vaccine may may come. figure way exist it, like we‚Äôve done many diseases it. idea whether I‚Äôll die get it. know underlying condition might get that‚Äôs gone undiagnosed. know society stands today cannot completely pause vaccine. US government certainly stand support people now, it‚Äôs indisputable fact can‚Äôt sit wait macro level. yes, population live die it. Everyone talks hard truths, one Yes. October 2021. least that's people conducting study said. talking sus, talking e-sus.  part FL? Alaska airlines best I've flown SWA close second person giving first hand account experience. nothing wrong per se. 

What know article scope scenario described.  Mainly build immunity lowest risk illnesses peak months multiple illnesses. novel virus terms doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúcare‚Äù seasonality terms later on. aspect rationale isn‚Äôt morality issue rather scienced based aspect. Treat novel virus best without interference deal multiple problems ie. summer months. Since we‚Äôre marching American reform calling problematic systems fuck airline industry next? Oh  good first steps. Pollyanna obsession going death all. Everything state done way late. sucks. criminal. don‚Äôt wanna burst bubble voting anything red, won‚Äôt unfortunately. many retired doctors politicians like keeping money. 3016 tested one positive, person got work.

Incubation 11 days, could 14, it‚Äôs typically 5-7. gyms dangerous you‚Äôd think least one would get it. Show blamed him

EDIT: case somehow confusing, lets make bit clear: stating 2 true facts (that uniquely positioned send warning early, foundation say anything already spreading unchecked) blaming. He's one step long list failures west dealing covid  Yes.

Have watched science based movies space? Apollo 13?

Needing CO2 scrubbers. airlines getting business. asymptomatic rate like 20%. Sacramento cops said enforcing masks..

What take?

I wore mask today outside 4 hours 100 degree heat..yes torture, better alternatives think about..like ventilator. Yo, kind liked Oklahoma City too. long seemed like ""slower"" sleepier pace lot big cities. super low expectations going though. posted 31 days ago it‚Äôs suddenly getting traffic today...wonder what‚Äôs that. propose? airlines? travel? Live within walking distance work never leave small area? Like kinda shitty life that, 1800s?  Dude, lose track old I'm 30's. can't imagine would like 100.

Also keep mind lot people back accurately recorded birthday, especially poor, might actually know year born. Years important, seasons were. ""It is.""

Fuck anyone says this, ever, reason. right ... least publicly he'd probably shut longer; he's gotta least toe Pelosi line 

privately meet crack hookers wants; make appreciable dent life Tbf lethal doubt would gotten far has. virus kills tons hosts kills quickly isnt going spread far Covid likes hide reveal symptoms spread unnoticed week kill .1 .5% population (any death % high)

And course, higher lethality (and maybe violent way dying) would make public panic take far seriously. Look Ebola example.

No, covid isnt apocalypse, quietly killing many people year average one have, infection death rates mark shame country didnt implement proper procedures. event makes fearful even worse ""silent deadly"" killer future, cause present showing collective population leaders foresight sense scale, never mind belief science, properly defend wrath. So... wave Gaslighting? reddit long friend. Clearly sub discussing opposing views. thought heard someone screaming soul.  survivors would much gain corona-induced mass extinction. example:

* corona wipes world, doubt big cities would almost uninhabited. would increasing need investigate abandoned structures materials dangerous animals trying reclaim human territory.
* would nuclear stuff would explode people know operate die off. would interesting read news one day.
* Survivors would given additional protection various governments make sure humanity die accident. So, human life actually become sacred closer humanity comes total extinction.
* Survivors probably conscripted learning survival skills. I'm sure many people could use those. puzzling result sure. outlier, would seem improbable closely related strains actually caused deaths/infections Europe widespread level. Maybe mistake; contamination false positives due similar coronavirus. Maybe evolutionary dead end. Maybe mutation necessary became deadly. given time scales involved, would first glance appear improbable would true positive virus causing pandemic. Riiiiight Flint place US poor water quality too. cops Houston said enforcing policies, restaurant calls cops customer wear mask S.O.L. I'd fine giving try take away *didn't* pandemic crisis. Wait President Idiot sets fireworks mt Rushmore. get forest fires too. 3 weeks ago 500-600 day started jumping 1200 level. went exponential 9k level. Deaths take average 22-24 days symptoms July 18th-July 20th give good indication death rate today's numbers Meanwhile, Nissan bringing car line work next week. We‚Äôve making SUVs 3 weeks now, influx several thousand people plant. 127k deaths 3-4 months huge number you? that‚Äôs locked time. You‚Äôre daft. beginning followed Korea model possible. prioritized testing people work institutions - symptoms not. mandated masks. taken everyone‚Äôs temp prior entering buildings public. bailed citizens main street businesses recurring payments. instead - borrowed another redditor - enough kill economy, enough kill virus. admire Gates, one making statements actual authority viruses like maybe immunologist virologist. Bill one making rounds tv networks. Feel free to. I'd rather cautious. fail realize people ecstatic second lockdown point. They're barely wanting wear masks now. thousands streets (wearing masks keeping distance, course) protesting lack adequate laws requiring masks? Even thousands upon thousands lives stake? No. 

No.

Why? 

Did congress people commit acts civil disobedience Trumps many egregious lies?

No.

But again, congress people carry civil disobedience health coverage?

No.

Why? Martin Luther King, Jr.? Figure making progress. mask problem. someone comes house want there, **you right removed.** resident make decision, police. arresting person behalf, arresting party must sign arrest form.

Refusing leave called trespass. police exhaust verbal options forced offender remove behalf clerk, *must* detain; asshole warned. mask ticket different offense entirely.

Therefore, clerk right someone removed masking up. Great logic. like mandate people murder. always backfires everyone goes killing spree. I'm surprised anyone Florida still alive. Correct Weird. could foreseen development??

Cries shocked Pikachu. I‚Äôm scientist. don‚Äôt beliefs, theories laws. case theory. 

My theory people using ‚Äúdata‚Äù ‚Äúprove‚Äù idiocy. evidence happens every one threads. 

My corollary theory series events posts may cause idiots draw conclusions rather listen people qualified speak. 

Because opinion validate opinion.  opinion fire crowded theatre (when indeed, rational observer would conclude fire present), shouted ‚Äúfire,‚Äù would call idiot loudly beg calm, desperate attempt save human lives, value highly ego. 
I apologize wounded ego, insofar I‚Äôm concerned, casualty imaginary ‚Äúfire.‚Äù courts ever made 10th Amendment ruling scope Federal Government powers national emergency like this? I‚Äôm sure would object temporary national quarantine would prevail. don‚Äôt think President authority lift state issued quarantine; suspect various national emergency contingency laws would give power impose one. Given yet see 60% spread regions large, doubt one breaks it. 30% 87k dead pretty awful. want airlines?  Nursing homes new killing fields. one protect patients staff. ""change mind"" guy thing virus. One argument flu deaths counted season, COVID-19 deaths counted season compare.

Which obviously insane since:

1. COVID-19 pandemic started part way flu season.

2. far tell, COVID-19 operate specific season.

If flu kills 60,000 year COVID kills 180,000 year, can't say equal ""if measure season 60,000 4 month period"".

Made mad.

The interviewee tried call little, talked around it. got DeSantis trying bullshit. Well, first tried pinning Hispanic farm workers remembered piss Hispanics win elections Florida. kids big deal they're going perfectly fine. Protesting murder man police good reason mass gathering. Plus Fauci said earlier week [""I still think reasonably good chance beginning 2021, we‚Äôre going vaccine, glad something look forward life again. Im glad live big city northeast ok hun? Getting 9mm 556 tomorrow die immediately. Deaths lag case increases. doubt it‚Äôs like controlled one back room mustache twirler, everyone knows political parties controlled big business. doesn‚Äôt mean wouldn‚Äôt fucktonn better Biden. 17 cases entire state Dallas. 

4 clusters entire state North Carolina.

410 Texas. 

Not exactly would call "" running like wildfire"". 

If children transmittors virus, C-19 got parents / adults. 

And kids transmit virus either children adults, number kids C-19 schools daycare actually irrelevant. Short sightenness...they think staying open protecting jobs. US govt months create ‚Äúhealth corps‚Äù like peace corps pandemic volunteers. thing? Like add extra stipend unemployment qualified volunteers. I‚Äôve looking way volunteer contact tracer far luck. six years clinical research experience, 3 phone screening interviewing patients collect data. I‚Äôm happy help free unemployed. I‚Äôve heard Trader Joe‚Äôs Costco good job. Fred Meyers awful. Safeway great, pick ordering online. CVS Target refuses kind parking lot pickup, can‚Äôt mailed, must go in.  anytime soon, people need aware it‚Äôs getting worse scary. ICU hospitalization #‚Äôs deaths? see cases? going hear good news people getting less less people die it? hope makes without health issues. Full send, it‚Äôs open idc also lung function spare I've quarantined since started, still go pick meds tip money awesome people bring groceries leave house without mask. I've got N95 lie, harder breathe fatiguing worn long periods, worth I'm even little concerned wearing mask going kill me. herd immunity yeah Seems like good idea done well. save person's sample immediately retest pool tests positive. pool test positive told I'd retest wait several days results, I'd worried entire time. ""A day tens thousands flocked resorts, Britain‚Äôs health secretary said Friday beaches could close ~~IF~~ **when** recent crowds cause new flood coronavirus cases.""

FTFY rude it. f\*cking 5 months this............ jesus ""are"" yet people think medical professionals, bankers, engineers, teachers, accountants, etc. It‚Äôs necessarily intelligence. Tribalism incredibly strong horrifying thing. Obama telling **not** wear mask, they‚Äôd proudly wearing home made ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Tread Me‚Äô ‚ÄòFreedom‚Äô masks. We've crossed 40,000 day LA County hasnt reported. Oh boy. LMAO American Vegas August, cancelled. Damn... love Winco much, majority people shop worst!

Once again, humans ruining something great dumb selfish. Nah fam, praying groups 100 top perfectly fine, drinking good. Nice assume shit me. really guns either. always wanted crossbow like people want motorcycles shit. Highest today. Tomorrow it'll consecutive day. think charge care virus. care re-election helping people. that's everywhere right now.   want see somebody go jail it. smart mayor  reasoning someone like that. Anything dont like becomes part conspiracy. protect reality. knowledge absolute everyone else idiot part machine. could possibly merit gathering 100+ people situation? I'm genuinely curious. I've spent last 3 months building 400 sq ft raised beds food, buying massive amounts flour rice beans sugar, stocking meat, paper/cleaning products. Tomorrow last piece. gonna lockdown stop unless feds come stimulus/extending unemployment people going go wild go ahead point part said lie. get emotionally rattled things implications scare you. Make argument. Mark Twain said easier fool someone convince they've fooled. know. fact I‚Äôm case nobody replaced would good sign future. Yes true, mean going get less infected people tested now. time passes people get infected pcr test detect parts virus months possible. 
This also depends number tests. 
Check graphs percentage positive tests number tests.   today‚Äôs episode ‚ÄúI clearly don‚Äôt care human beings,‚Äù I‚Äôm responding lot it‚Äôs cruel. 

Letting people die respiratory illness cruel. it‚Äôll interesting read nuclear sites 50 years road? fuck that. Letting folks die evil. 

Please take end world fantasy elsewhere. ignored coming. listened world experts taken seriously, might contained source. Let‚Äôs make mistake again.

This isn‚Äôt far right reporting this. CNN others well. PATHETIC LOL it? whole reason people upset main source venom thousands threads stuff? 4th July entered chat room. Yeah still people England example travel Scotland without issues, right? Let's say infections pick England situation Scotland remains stable, people would probably want go trips cannot stopped? Alexa, Play: Disturbed - Sickness mass gatherings across nation know who, surprise me. predict 3k deaths day June wrong. mitigation social distancing. Everyone‚Äôs claiming area ones anything, even lowering 2000 shows awful projections are. server fine dining restaurant true, guests also uneven expectations. told someone chef touched food bare hands might freak out, even blink bartender squeezes lime drink going back counting cash. Yet medical professionals among them.

Red areas doctors, bankers, engineers, teachers too. professions blue areas have. Higher risk mean go hospital. That's math works. Make 2 million agree. It‚Äôs protests. can‚Äôt believe don‚Äôt care health others. I've always wanted one.

Ding ding ding. nothing protecting planning what's happening. always gun ownership, living long-held fantasy. treating Covid patients NYC past months, tell cause concern justified. je-sus, poor Brazil. Still sounds e-suspicious. thing? 

I‚Äôm 60% sure covid February ‚Äî testing nowhere serology testing tomorrow.

Anyway, shivers bad wife heard teeth chattering side condo. Americans know 'societal responsibility' means. Let guess, 2 months covid deaths lockdown? county SWFL 19%, couple days ago 22%. shits fucked. Good job absolute minimum done days ago. üëè hope helps TX lower amount cases puts people's minds bit ease. destroying dreams every word. done 3 months ago ffs... people come urgent care clinic wanting get tested Covid. Without masks on. drives insane! Yeah beef focus positive rate it‚Äôs yet another thing people don‚Äôt understand dial freak over. It‚Äôs useful statistic it‚Äôs misunderstood, misunderstood commenter somewhere explained little better. big deal, pandemic, huge amount fear mongering society needs stopped. That's Abbott wanting ways. wants able say stopped virus abdicating responsibility actually anything. wants credit putting blame mayors Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, El Paso, Austin. way covers ass ""masks tyranny"" crowd also pretending cares people Texas. Fuck Abbott. Ignoring real issue overworked staff. news tomorrow. Masks. Bob trolling crap least day. I'm sure gets waste good sense him. downvote move life. resident Arizona, first time ever say I‚Äôm jealous Texas. say realizing Arizona shit hole. we're number 1! /s LA County gonna biggest sleeper cell this. People far lax, restaurants bars playing loose. lot big nightclubs slated open coming week, people travel counties weekend 4th. August going shit show. make valid point :-)
If believe conspiracy theories there's someone said exact thing 10 yrs back, also describes current situation we're exactly. start looking coffins there; imagine funerals cost $2000 not, devil's doing. dont follow closely, Harris Ft. Bend counties mask requirements. allows counties implement cities?  Yea get yer goddamn government outta cytoplasm Florida tourism-oriented 4th July weekend approaching. Yeah, came testing articles NEVER blame that. 

Counties across country nursing homes first outbreaks tested symptomatic people despite knowing 1) huge time frame form infection symptoms 2) large percentage asymptomatic cases. fucked hard media never bothers call out. 

The company work 4-5 outbreaks 31 communities stark difference severe outbreaks managed 3-4 cases, testing. Testing everyone ASAP saved lives. Glad managed get point beginning weekly testing. well one first major cities shut down. last weeks shit show. hardly see masks anywhere anymore. one social distancing. Places packed packed. 

Hopefully helps slow current trend increases.  Ya I'm arguing agree encouraged fullest extent r debating mandatory Lol. Like anyone would take morons seriously. said pandemic over. Fucking assholes. Technically it‚Äôs logistic growth. Okay, says ""aims distribute 2 billion doses"". saying planning eventually many, especially many countries signed receive it, think 2 billion current moment, unless I'm missing something know needs said Coronavirus 'wipe world'; even wipe elderly. true mortality rate novel virus starting come light 1-2% MOST. \~1% mortality horrific noticeable (would result million dead US alone 50% population becomes infected), that's hardly kind situation imagining. get sarcasm weird nihilistic urge fantasize end days, STFU economies world become efficient kind slow down. looked wrong way. don‚Äôt fix problem economic strategies. crazy part probably vaccine right now. sure one (or ones) safe. book airline actually booking 2/3of plane. plenty  Oh. üò¢ Trump's verbal support would enough get many wear mask.

However, deliberately doubled-down stupid telling reporter WSJ people wear masks public health, signal disapproval Trump.

Trump blood hands say ‚Äúwe highly encourage recommend people wear mask public, stay home much can‚Äù bam new case rates would drop we‚Äôd one step closer getting back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù probably need 10-20 years timeout. think we‚Äôve done. I'm AZ incompetent governor I'm constant state slow burn creeping fear. stay safe sanity-land, okay? abysmal funding cuts education every level, plus federal government pushing policies ineffective, may even notice. 
(And way teachers‚Äîwe many brilliant, incredible teachers‚Äîtheir hands tied little pay/resources advancement often tied standardized test results) need complete reset button here. :( Surprize surprize, peer reviewed absurd. They're gonna likely go back online anyway. 

If plan online 2-3 months plan prepare online pedagogy make better.

That's conclusion I've come family I. We're own, everyone themselves. I'll protect much possibly control.

It sounds dramatic whatever pandemic situation really made bitter towards people.  Surprize surprize, peer reviewed US? Washington maybe good hikes? favorite Gothic Basin. Crazy hard hike, amazing view. No, shake heady head. SMDH come back summer. Surprize surprize, peer reviewed So.... China‚Äôs fault? Well, guys 95K tests per 1M people, 4,5K, Brazil still leadüòéüòéüòé  That's nice way tell concerned want combative, there's honestly excuse medical office them. Homecare workers like can't get every site like Amazon medical resellers suppliers require medical business license. NYC. supplies actually there, kept reach. shocking appalling makes sense insane. Surprize surprize, peer reviewed OP, unlikely. international flights stopped back february opened yet. find people die eventually? Guess what, Covid-19 even close top causes death worldwide. Someone solving climate change directly. really can't believe Trump pushed Fauci yet. speaks mind afraid consequences even directly contradicting Trump. Refreshing! Surprize surprize, peer reviewed ""The comparison Spanish Flu, behaved exactly like Covid: went summer fiercely resumed September October, creating 50 million deaths second wave,""
I'm confused. say getting worse days ago? Low hundreds deaths recorded week...over 2k yesterday, back 600+ today.

The books cooked folks. Nothing numbers make sense all. expect continue (along cases hospitalizations) downward trend weekend Monday. I‚Äôm losing faith official reporting system, gambling man I‚Äôd expect next *national* record breaking numbers come next Tuesday. Anyone that‚Äôs really watching like hawk already sees pattern right said risk willing take. I‚Äôm DR, two YouTube videos shared people called drs (maybe weren‚Äôt?) one mask bullshit immune system bullshit. videos made rounds eventually removed false. enough idiots believed even though ton medical professionals trying talk sense peer reviewed, seems incorrect. It'll take breath away It‚Äôs incredibly embarrassing live United States right now. could redo anything would build time machine make happen /r/Qult_Headquarters peer reviewed? Apparently not. Kinda does. People live 85 years. 1 85 people die every year. Millions die US alone. 2k statistically insignificant. think you‚Äôre making point dropping 60 page pdf? 

Cite relevant quote(s). Doesnt look peer reviewed. Clearly biased piece written incorrect methods. makes upset thinking ahead could virus masks mandated public long time ago hadn‚Äôt opened early. nope we‚Äôre stuck Abbott protests. One race literally made tagline lives gonna put anyone else‚Äôs we‚Äôre seeing fruits effort. don‚Äôt know protest organizers aren‚Äôt considered bioterrorists packed street middle pandemic order effect political goal seems like fits bill. especially ironic considering people whose behalf they‚Äôre professing protest disproportionately affected disease. people totally brush concerns saying wearing masks (bullshit) it‚Äôs talisman magically wards virus. It‚Äôs fucking insane. article already date. Grats baby! think solutions fix school situations Soviet Union right collapsed too. UK WW2. power immune collapse people failed take seriously going panic freak hits close home. Prepare insane panic shopping shortages. New York locked hit 5k 

Florida 9k pretty much said fuck well that's obviously we're testing much! Stop testing everyone it'll go away!

I've got head sand everything fine, damnit! think thinking nuanced approach. One respects regional circumstances needs. One federal government respects responds nuanced way proportionate regional need. US, federal government essentially stood back washed hands responsibility. fact consistent federal messaging continued spread virus black eye US, exposes cracks sense American exceptionalism. Yes. Texas fucking stupid. Speaking experience live here. hate deliver bar hang place. Fucking morons. live BC got quite bit open, people already getting lazy. i've gone seeing 99% people masks maybe 50%, hot. hot, people wear masks. 

at least use hand sanizter tho I‚Äôm curious rate positives changed number tested includes taking required tests surgeries certain medical appointments. Dad appointment pulmonary therapist (not covid related) required take rest. believe patients required take tests surgeries well. Masklace oh like give money rich instead. need know is, online school, better extend unemployment December. 3 kids elementary wife stay home teacher instead going back work.

So many different problems different types people this. Shhhh... fit narrative they're trying push. argue opposite. vaccines proven safe 95% population won‚Äôt 2+ years. time it‚Äôs likely even light social distancing gotten us herd immunity. 

The act eating restaurant one human human experiences. many world religions based experience? It‚Äôs literally core Christianity. 12 people sitting breaking bread. Sharing food other. 

Herd immunity best guess pursue reasonable manner would costs 400k lives total. 300k now. already seems like lot social measure starting fail us. Worst protest decades. Cancel culture. Probably two worst political candidates maybe ever. It‚Äôs huge risks say fuck it. know costs versus unknown costs. bad things get people take 2 years isolation? What‚Äôs psychological toil America? many extra suicides?

So restaurants 2 years costs society bare (and I‚Äôm obviously including social interactions that‚Äôs similar conditions everything). Florida actually reporting things now, that's probably they're also mass testing major cities. calling history fiction. üò¨ Neither mayor Odessa midland implement masks. 5 laundromats it‚Äôs mandatory staff. keep hearing placing blame older folks see ones following rules around Iowa. Massive amounts younger people social distancing wearing masks purpose. Maybe blaming entire generation start convincing anyone reasonable least. hear lot blame president kinda baffles gloss protests riots even thought. even see video proof age group care listen reasons. Doesnt look peer reviewed. West Virginia joined chat irony right are, without knowing it. live not, I‚Äôm sure Central Northern part state kiss ground walks on. He‚Äôs fucking idiot. 4 year old would make smarter decisions. feel way. Though, know happened opposition got confident ‚Äî got elected. Lines outside door could mean people waiting someone leave half-empty business. think lot people trying go stay home. Don‚Äôt worry, gone Easter according president! Doesnt seem peer reviewed room wants party thinks they're sneaky. literally anyone else, either side, charge would happened. Surprize surprize, peer reviewed Oh look, another account months old throwing around ""Doomer"" label accusing ""Them"" scaring people unnecessarily ""clicks"" nebulous gain. Go back LockdownSkepticism. You‚Äôre right. Protests aren‚Äôt cause. Plan? plan lose presidency start news network media empire publicity siphon campaign donations deutchbank acct. didn‚Äôt workout we‚Äôve scrambling since. Wear mask ya nasty say you‚Äôre going Alaska, Canada let in.

But... they‚Äôve already fined deported bunch Americans saying they‚Äôre traveling Alaska instead partying Toronto. that's completely fair. hope everyone protesting understanding situation. Here: link contains articles regarding CoViD-19 situation updated near daily way back January first cases involving tourists China detected. English translations bottom half page (and aren't, use Google translate).

Some photos people wearing scrubs certainly provide evidence (I even know bringing up???), relevant data relevant departments updating us with, yes. mention small enough country data released match reality, would certainly noticeable.

The data progress CoViD-19 openly documented. simple google search 'covid 19 malaysia' provides many articles many different sources. Someone, post, even linked wikipedia page specifically detailing lockdown Malaysia implemented, way also link page detailing overall CoViD-19 situation right first paragraph, gee, detail travel bans foreign country looking (I know Wiki reliable source news, plenty referral links lead primary sources checked out). Even link post contains link page details lockdown here.

If can't bothered even minimal research efforts country society making, please also bother leave belittling comments us run baseless, groundless, unsupported narrative. they're not. data literally points opposite.  Truth. Flatten curve never reverse curve.

Everyone going get it. don‚Äôt find new treatments vaccine (we‚Äôve never developed vaccine coronavirus) number people going die it. It‚Äôs going happen slower rate. Also humans handle logarithmic growth patterns intuitively. little late. Wow, base. Thankfully, live country that's badly moment, long keep good work. 
You're deflecting AGAIN, point. wish well. case. Looks like track open Easter......2021 It'd super helpful would wear mask publicly cult following would follow suit instead making loyalty pledge. It'd help try gather tens thousands people together event center. It'd help would stop contradicting experts, trying silence them.

Just ways could stop trying kill Americans. it‚Äôs one time passcode authentication could work, problem plenty people lack access technology knowledge use it. Come October: Corna flu combined omega coronafluziod!

Everyone thank u/dr_mcstuffins ! rural Indiana here, I'm younger fellow (20), I've seen age group ones taking seriously frightening. Almost every single person age younger wearing mask often even parents refuse to. think means lost something. Perfectly okay dropping bombs middle east though Sucks old people. Children people fighting horrible dictatorship gassing people confined space killed next generations negligence confined space NBC feed show slides talking :( What's unfortunate today's numbers match individual public health units released! sure why, add unit get 179, yet ontario announced 111. Someone must got stats time. said that, 200 still great. 3 states like week 

This shows rate increase. Means case count may low, rate 1, state going fucked sooner later lock down. Every state except Northeast Weird headline. virus care people job wants spread. ""Karen"" officially female version ""dick""

Even local news young adults promoting masks getting shit it. Went optometrist yesterday he‚Äôs going herd immunity, masks. he‚Äôs 30‚Äôs went Texas A&amp;M. honestly don‚Äôt know people won‚Äôt listen science.

do think worth people intentionally getting sick shops stay open?

Technically Disneyworld, actual parks separate require separate attendance fees cure? wait guys getting multiple checks?

lol wtf hate Yes, dont need another lockdown. People still get sick wont die. possible? POUTUS tell everyone slow testing happen?? Yea problem masks protect people you. people super-spreaders leave trail death devastation wake. trying people Reckless Endangerment charging felonies, locking away safety society. Notice absurdly wordy explanations ‚Äúexplain‚Äù yourself? 

A simple yes would fine. Thanks. Flip chart grouping virus, come back, apologize me. Yep, likely case. Everyone top freaking deaths...

Deaths gonna stay low... Arizonan terrified, immediate family believe wearing masks effective, extended family believes gods hands and/or gov hoax. coworkers 'need breathe' one bothered wear masks. expect least funeral two deal year out. Depends phase. seems trend bars reopening tipping point really kicked everything off. 

Bars opened Florida June 5th. 

Bars opened 50% capacity Texas June 5th. replied wrong person, check SassySeehorse's post history. Fuck loser. Hi! Nerd here. 

Curious pulled sources have. I‚Äôve read cloth/silk seems effective fabric combo, that‚Äôs N95. What‚Äôs near N99 plan? takes 20 seconds sanitize hands. :-) American government brainwashed people... thing repeated 100 years now. cycle continues. Ya know, I‚Äôm drunk balls, doctor, problem. 

Again, I‚Äôm expert, might want doctors degrees. Hopefully medicine. even know we're talking death. care. 

What ***fucking terrible economy***.

As business owner, screaming sky beginning this. business suffer. employees suffer.

They **only** care economy old people, *they fucking economy*.

Anyway. Enjoy 6 months quarantine good luck homeschool everyone. shit even possible? us beating India Brazil. countries even running water Poor's. Plus land area us huge compared countries. Something messed up. Like glitch matrix shit. accomplish say yes? posting link thread. going move find someone disagrees harder you, fun arguing them? finally move on? 
 
Again, New York City. resident, registered voter New York City. assume are, realize going magically join forces start lobbying NYC government conduct specific contact tracing (again, still ask someone large crowds, protests large crowds recent past...). So, *quite* know trying accomplish plastering link everywhere. 
 
Whatever purpose, hope get want it. Meanwhile governor Brian Kemp insists mask order necessary need slow rollback reopening, three months proved competence told us realize disease could spread incubation period. 
 
This say, contact tracing better. denying preventative measures actively killing people, need move protesters help parents friends's parents increased risk hospitalization real death leadership. Well could care less 5G still wear mask even personally COVID-19 myself. right patient means free seek second opinion wonder array strings thing defines political speech Same. popping centrium's bit We‚Äôre St Charles county heard rumor. wife teacher that, it‚Äôs going much extra work her. President doubt would remind everyone ""they knew getting into...""

So, believe poll numbers, think way. 

There simply enough ""base"" left lift Republicans public office, prospect mind , **fuck em**, dumb enough still believing bullshit, deserve little exercise Darwinian social theory. testing states rising numbers 1or 2 months ago? mean number daily tests, testing criteria? not, even care rising - tens millions infected country, official stats show like 10% them. Deaths continue decline, that's main thing 7 billion people world. 200k represents .00015 percent total people. surely big number it‚Äôs scary, putting world scale doesn‚Äôt really justice many people world. lot fucking people. saying nobody ever taught read stacked bar graph? surprising...

I know many ways need tell go back look, numbers citing wrong. based reality. nothing 'reading stacked bar graph' everything fact numbers, due typo whatever, based reality. again, we're seeing real example now. Cases spike. Hospitalizations go up. Driven younger crowd. Age hospitalization decreased Texas.

I really want smarter proving work putting hospitalization numbers context total case count age group important. still little faith your. let off, son, I'm much older you. 

Then really shame far behind go testing data that's available. testing data indicates younger people likely test positive right now. clinical data suggests hospitalizations younger individuals. Yet, overall number positive cases late 2.3 fold pre-open peak hospitalized individuals older without overwhelming ICU. 

Alright champ, put together point context spouting numbers, may verge breakthrough. it! think depends report ""officially published"" verses count today. know outbreak 18 people Kingston instance, think announced Ontario's numbers published tomorrow's numbers probably. assume wrong. Everyone responsible Australia little changed strangled first wave. wish guys best, seriously. lot people choice. shutting important many businesses proactive safety work parents want keep kids safe. really fucked up, especially jobs ending wfh need back office. Yup, there's massive lag numbers covid spreads (ignoring lag behind gathering numbers). Say someone covid coughed today would still 2 weeks start showing symptoms, unfortunately really bad reaction covid get hospitalised days later extra lag 3 days. 

Sadly die covid hospital 20 days later, I'll call 3 weeks. Added together 5 weeks someone infected today added deaths. That's countries going really slowly reopening could take weeks find stuff opened far. Unfortunately US reopened really quickly numbers still going up/staying way know exact reopening biggest effect. Fed threw trillions COVID recovery would make sense vaccine affordable. Uninsured bills ICU beds completely unrelated. non-concern. Yes Deaths plummeted. Hospitalizations normalized ICU beds also plummeted. 

The reason right LOT cases, they're mostly people age 60. people going likely get really fucked it. big tits? They're also months ahead us force people listen. can't even get people wear mask president decided start defunding covid testing sites. is. Imagine stupid blame huge spike cases Southern states (who reopened early restrictions) BLM protests üòÇ  passed point time February/early March. Playing video games competitive instead cooperative. Damn. Either bots hella smarter before, ‚Äúno politics‚Äù filter gonna horribly executed. 

A bot whose job detect remove political writing. Think that. fucked cause trump/Republicans. They're killing us. travelling work I'm terrified. ICUs full. get bad die choking fluid lungs. fuckin scary. accept opinion. large groups, restaurants, multiple hotels, beach. reality, we're still middle pandemic care family's safety. Can't safe. booster shots required every 3 required every 3 months, distancing masks stay indefinitely. forever. got it. maybe measuring something different, like full hospitalization capacity. dispute Newsom cares, comment general mainly w local federal leaders mind I'm glad great minds think alike!

Me, thinking back life grades get med school undergraduate GPA 2.8 due playing video games 4+ hours day, skipping half classes, partying every weekend:

If could go back redo anything, would kept everything else played 3 hours games night. Yea probably doubling every 6 days now. 

8k start number

Over past 24 hours, U.S. reported record 46,850 new cases coronavirus 637 new deaths, raising total 2.5 million cases 125,122 dead  case, many things wrong. right fair. wrong though. current denial virus now, chloroquine trials, hosting rallies pandemic. spinning control. responsibly reclosing al stores Florida Disney pushes ahead reopening.

Apparently, believe Co2 bacteria build could kill them. Someone tell surgeons... See tomorrow works Straya's number go Amercians.

Let burn ignorance. can't believe many people still think masks work despite fact. Possible guess seems like would popped heavily lot sooner, unless virus mutated point become spreadable? sure things like work I‚Äôm wondering coronavirus claim found identical current coronavirus. Assuming even real mean idk right. need stop testing. cases go down. That's President recommending. Horrible analogy whatever I‚Äôm clearly hive mind subreddit point wasting time fucking insane people got 1200 dollars this. 

The $1200 people without jobs. stimulus check, separate unemployment. I'm sure became common compare monthly rent.

People unemployment got $1200 + state unemployment + additional federal $600/month. Ah, US going quit funding testing numbers go bigly. Checkmate! Kids making biggest sacrifice whole thing. year education going significantly impact future many poor kids. time without friends already emotionally destroyed many others. compare 2000 40. Florida under-reporting factor 50 Sounds like need democracy It‚Äôs really sad (pathetic too) politicians intimidated president afraid blasted social media completely kiss ass ignore science. (along whole slew things) think banned alcohol sales bars restaurants Partially due elective surgeries green-lighted filling beds, fully due Covid19. sound surprisingly cautious level-headed guy chases storms. really wonder solution , government won‚Äôt shit people go out.

Land corporations, home dumb.

Not proud American anymore... parents live UK say there. None masked shops. Lots places packed people. probably double triple death count. That's guess. Wish president actually gave shit this. So, many required hospitalization? many died? numbers count. I'm twisting words all. brought context protests, not? whole point media likes condemn protests large gatherings fit agenda. BLM protests happened 2-3 weeks ago see spike cases. could never large gatherings could it? half-ass replacing federal judges, unfortunately. matter time manage replace enough last check Trump's power gone.

It's really 2020 never. bad longer responsible global partner even citizen sides doesn‚Äôt even matter point, Texas far gone. Plus, doubt going enforced. Abbott absolute idiot going live failure.

Wear fucking mask. hard. hey opening Disneyland Florida, world's happiest place.. think it‚Äôs cost/benefit analysis parents. Social distancing, hand hygiene etc reduces chance catching it. There‚Äôs les value seeing strangers/acquaintances vs risk dying. there‚Äôs value seeing close family. You‚Äôre wrong it‚Äôs high risk socialize someone works bar goes daycare, probably feel benefit worth risk. There‚Äôs easy answer this. Don‚Äôt hard parents. it‚Äôs still extremely hot July August. July normally hottest month northern hemisphere. big fuck anti-intellectualism politicizing god damn pandemic. shutdowns beginning nothing since worse then. 

Seriously, opening early fear couple months ago. can‚Äôt believe fucked everything is...I live state GOP sued open state back conservative leaning state Supreme Court agreed them! can‚Äôt believe this. like name. fair, people severe lung disease actually advised doctors wear masks, wear short periods set attack. oxygen saturation already low, even small impact mask could drop safe levels.

AFAIK Spanish Flu 2nd wave flu well warm temperatures. kinda died bit summer came back got cold again.

This first wave. Coronavirus care warm weather. Ask Brazil. He's covering ass pointing something ""nobody could predicted"" looks like less politically motivated fuckup.

He still covering ass. Holy fucking shit people fucking stupid Forgive lack knowledge here, much help body's fight virus? much lower would chances dying took this? Actually, /u/nutcrackr pointed worldometers different data comes 663, also checked 91-divoc.com comes 634 US - NJ. right here, feel going balloon larger larger issue go along. lot people made serious sacrifices time. extremely serious (like lost jobs livelihoods) significant (those put lives hold since March). everyone sacrificed together, would pretty much past clear right now. happen. Instead, people sacrificed, others disregarded whatever wanted like children, finish line started. Obviously going end well economic lives lost level, think going end pretty badly social level well. people sacrificing going start really, really resenting nothing.

Coronavirus backwards suriv anoroc Blame leadership. contact tracing, *legitimate* efforts vaccine, no...anything Santa hiring? Wish best luck. 2020 needs good news once. It‚Äôll fine, generally trust managers coworkers keep safe. think going shopping essentials everyone masks and/not following one-way markets aisles etc really gotten head though build self dependence ur pathetic CPR study found formal qualifications predictor quality, medical knowledge informal providers Tamil Nadu Karnataka higher trained doctors Bihar Uttar Pradesh, study found.

This real problem. forgot /s Technically yes, actual number cases likely higher April since US way testing now. provide data shows significant spikes cities largest protests, moron.

That's problem old people. Everything bullshit nonsense. 'Merica leadin' way! actually prevent Ya can't imagine lack access face covering issue. But...maybe local government taking seriously enough mail masks somehow encourage take bit seriously well. lol pathetic. build self dependence. people like don‚Äôt deserve businesses ""Enough"" depending are. generally anyone needs tested tested, ""wanting"" tested might enough, ""Needing"" be, would. u.s. order went public health service test anyone wanted, u.s. could it, serious lack political will, massive squandering resources date. I‚Äôd say mums selfish USA BABY #1 Citizen tracing incorporated least admit wrong correct himself...none us know expect Covid somebody Netherlands, got lockdown pretty short got first deaths. However, think really important transparant open way government communicated people underestimate virus hit country. Listening experts, making sort roadmap order open economy again, giving trust citizens capable following new guidelines. 

However, made mistakes also, countries health order economy could fully open again. last slowly started continue next couple weeks. Oh I‚Äôm worried myself. working home 3 months, Corp said won‚Äôt back till end September earliest.... I‚Äôve literally drink every. Single.

Reducing emissions flu aren‚Äôt valid reasons majority workforce work remotely half decade. aren‚Äôt even valid reasons majority workforce work remotely short period time. Working remotely feasible professions, less others. Even it‚Äôs feasible results poorer cohesion workplace, issues childcare (how someone homeschool kid work home simultaneously) mental health outcomes. structure lives accommodate distancing much possible career (law) others I‚Äôm sure, even thinking WFH end year impacting industry unforeseen, negative ways Hey Luling texas! miss visiting baker st pub live music dancing! Austin awesome! Let‚Äôs hope governor starts job properly! daughter's school district trying please everybody, see going work. surveyed families, fairly evenly split: 1/3 wants go back full time, 1/3 wants part-time model, 1/3 wants full-time distance learning. district decided let everybody pick want. 

Sounds great theory, I'm hearing there's intention separate part-time kids full-time kids, even point? they're talking spending bunch money district install cameras classroom distance learners watching rest class day individual teacher tries teach populations.

Granted they're still hammering things out, lot change next month half. school board train wreck, chased district's amazing superintendent probably hope reasonable plan August. mean, they're wrong. erode Liberty. state dictating see, close stand them, whether earn living, without much basis actual legislation States.

you make solid argument erosion Liberty necessary temporary basis protect hundreds thousands lives. argue affecting rights liberties disingenuous turn people off. Fight ground favorable Yeah Chief back days ""numbers"" tad reliable. Man, can‚Äôt wait apocalypse. put numbers prospective:

Australia recorded TOTAL 7,595 cases since pandemic begun reported 35 cases yesterday. states starting open get back usual. Much like NZ. yet, one day, America trumped total completely water. Unreal. many thinking they‚Äôre invincible. Target checkout line today - guy passes long line (without mask) takes deep inhale mock everyone. We‚Äôre going get morons. That's... leaders work... Generals die wars, soldiers do. service use phone computer clicks days, knock knock UPS, is. 

Amazon even encourages order extra sizes clothes shoes free full refunds free shipping ways. try on, return like. free. Without leaving house. shopped clothes store 3 years, family three. Or, ""I ate mask"" Good lord denial dude. 

You think SIGNED PAPER, means nothing stop it? lol wat. season even STARTING let alone finishing. every single day when. Nice job trying troll. shows type person are. Lol like everyday week report new high score husband healthcare. CANNOT stay home. honestly know going Tennessee doesn‚Äôt get shit together school open back up! We‚Äôre fucked. clown eating shit up.

It's designed instill false optimism. Anyone see that. person restaurants use seems strongest correlation. Countries wear masks see comparable Covid-19 spikes reopening. sure...bars biggest problem. 33000 FREEDOM?! Nope nope nope murica another week dropping deaths? I‚Äôd rather deaths good news! point significant spikes cities largest protests prove theory true? know trolling still find funny claimed virus ""disappear"" ü§°ü§°ü§° that‚Äôs last 3 *months*lol  That's great. want extrapolate available data? Fine. Stay fuck away mine ""own libtards"" wearing mask enclosed space. *USA. USA.. Number 1. Number 1.* European lot less worried.
My government buys vaccines bulk.
Thank God healthcare system universal.

(I'm Netherlands) 4) states actively manipulating deaths now. need glass country. 


Heck, one nuke right place (or rather, wrong place) kill people blink eye COVID-19 six months. 


However, government without provocation state war undeniably evil. would upvote 100x's could! Africa 'country'? lolol foot mouth much? Disney World Phased Reopening outrageous even children detention centers all! fucked country. Treatment regimens lot better. Pay attention. Using anticoagulants, antivirals, convalescent plasma, better hypoxia protocols, immune modulation steroids like dexamethasone, toxilizumab. significantly improved outcomes IFR dropping dramatically early days. According FDA, phase 3 trials supposed take 1-4 years test ""Efficacy monitoring adverse reactions"". release vaccine October, started phase 2/3 trials May, would mean they've done 5 months testing.

I wonder thinking behind potentially allowing vaccine five months phase 2/3 testing. Maybe think risk worth save many, many lives. Yeah cousin wedding last weekend 62 year old mom went along 84 year old grandpa. didn't. 173 people people masks servers. Fucking insane.

This Michigan, cases going down. We'll see goes.. Extremely well written. link studies? doubting way, would interesting read. Hope everyone stays safe Definitely not. state going another lockdown point forward. best you‚Äôll mask recommendations hopefully people take precautions. Restaurants one human experiences? Dude fucking moron. can‚Äôt many people exist. world live in. America deserves everything it‚Äôs getting right population believes. dont think people really care anymore. Stop bringing up. 37 Aus people starting panic buy toilet paper again. gonna happen probably Halloween *earliest*.

And it'll one sport probably time. Sucks thats Now, countries, numbers merely symbols rising coronavirus spreading failure bourgeois governments contain it!

People must learn fight pandemic well economic recession! restaurant server better enforce people wearing masks? Today Illinois‚Äô first day dining inside restaurant disastrous. rained everyone patio rushed inside without masks on. Customers respectful social distancing, crowding around tables visit friends, rolling eyes engaging altercations asked put mask, make matters worse managers even owners restaurant upholding standards set state safe phase 4 reopening. Guests leaving shitty tips, staying far past welcome insignificant bills generally rude. don‚Äôt feel safe returning job, definitely don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs worth it. Check restaurant friends btw lot ‚Äúemployee relief funds‚Äù everyone donated 20% take orders went directly staff... never got employers. Never mind fact got small business emergency relief loan, assure you, restaurants STRUGGLE employees making minimum wage leg work. 

I sign mask patroller, disinfect every surface restaurant, put mine families health risk. I‚Äôm server. make $4 hour goes taxes. 

How hold superiors responsible? hold fellow citizen responsible? Apparently, lives matter. /endrant State borders still open. It‚Äôs matter time NY/NJ reopening collide numbers start going back up. Really messed regress that. Yeah, ok.......duhh year 2025, man still alive, lungs still survive ? Texas. Fuck Abbott. i'm masks. twisting words.

You're pro lockdown doesnt effect you.

It however effect millions people get plunged poverty dont care still work white collar job home right? That's narcissist can't serious. Cases started going Southern states protests started üòÇ problem never ""good"" time protests. absolutely terrible coincide huge pandemic, people waited several months, response opposition would almost certainly ""this old issue. dredging old dirty laundry? *You're* ones keeping alive."" sadly, reasoning work undecideds many centrists, since undecided people predisposed support status quo rather social change. Unless problem fresh mind, inconvenient acknowledge things need change. issue hot, much harder press. 

So protesters do? Wait pandemic end *and then* another act gross injustice hit mainstream? hopefully time another reason opposition thinks bad time raise issue, often seems be. Again, hate protests need happen right we're fighting pandemic. fact matter issue cannot allowed cool go back place majority apathetic unaware. strike iron hot. long majority protesters continue wear masks try act responsibly feasible respect virus, support them, matter much wish protests happen right now. leaders citizens. people USA dont give 2 shits virus. True pov huge. It‚Äôs huge tbh realize like 35k cases daily around 3 spiking states. way guess im surprised realizing  Half people u see ‚Äúwearing‚Äù even properly wearing social distancing effective too. anxiety attacks face mask don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right. wash hands keep space need don‚Äôt like feeling something cover mouth nose. Half bone heads see pull away talk anyway. get even worse anxiety people try converse one on. Like clue fuck u r saying can‚Äôt read ur lips so... keep ur space like normal human sanitized much possible. Get tested go Throw another 33,000 corpses pile, then. Another great therapeutic technique!

We use hypotheticals open-ended questions, coupled ""I-statements"" get people thinking behaviors thought processes without coming judgmental. long said spirit genuine curiosity way could interpreted sarcasm, really works! Ya everyone glossing obvious, slow build-up doubt mistrust science medicine coupled White House promotes breakdown trust institutions get this. People see something simple masks think it‚Äôs another issue meant fight back on. governments Canada steady sure promoting science health years much easier us buy in, governments really walked walk using top health officials guidelines suggestions hard rules follow. Policy followed science. Honestly thing separating response people US was/is LEADERSHIP top. Make simple change next time shit won‚Äôt happen. people wanna right thing. living username all. ;)

Thanks positivity! depends definition disaster is. young people dont care get sick, there's nothing labeled disaster. meth* Well said vast majority world lives northern hemisphere flu extremely season deaths September April. bad flu year easily 500k dead flu 6-8months. 

So, want perspective. Covid kills 500k 7 months absolutely vaccine barely treatment all, flu kills 500k people 7 months vaccines effective treatments. 

They *both* really bad. I‚Äôm sure kinda scoff flu like it‚Äôs nothing. virus mostly effective vaccines really effective treatments one seems worried still manages kill half million people year. Bro it‚Äôs fine it‚Äôs old people it‚Äôs fine Excellent great hear!

Although sometimes issue isn‚Äôt preserving it, preserving ability run it.
Wasn8t project NASA, saving old computer code (Apollo era?). backed reverse engineer figure worked.The BBC domesday book 80s laserdisc, still copies figure import old files onto new machines.

I watching Edgar Wright‚Äôs early series Spaced, one scene involved lot freeze frames. weird effect, stuttery motion. could wrong suspect would looked different played old tube TV, however playing modern flatscreen, scene altered.

I‚Äôm also sure heard something old nintendo game Duck Hunt. Something way made hinged old TVs, played modern TV game doesn‚Äôt function.

I‚Äôm far expert, something simple changing TVs cause problems, sympathy archivists. I‚Äôm sure possible workarounds devised, still though, it‚Äôs much, much easier preserve oldfashioned book newer media. US Brazil comprised nearly 45% worlds new cases today, wow Remind me! Two weeks going far worse ‚Äúfirst wave‚Äù cases/deaths also unemployment runs many people. 
60 million counting... Oh dining restaurants totally safe thought, long everyone cleans surfaces staff wear masks.

It's safe. People definitely get sick restaurants bars salons. Brainwashing: know expect me. acknowledged protests likely contributed / contributing rising cases. And, cursory glance, looks like decision counter goal precise contact tracing, agree with. (Although, say patients asked they've gathered large crowds, given state things lately, I'm pretty sure could deduce 98% accuracy someone protester). 
 
But again, hung event largely over? Dunk protests want, fun, refocus demanding competent leadership, American people try little harder combating virus? want start instance contact tracing, fine. that, let's move rolling back reopenings, enforcing masks social distancing, getting legislators allocate money keep people feet things settle down? schools really thinking reopening....at rate, 2020 going known year quarantine. expected accessible testing. people surprised tests = positive cases? devastation places live work among friends families colleagues. please, say ""wait two weeks"", Ive hearing since mid march. Yeah protests spread virus like crazy. Meanwhile people states argue legitimacy wearing masks en masse. Contact tracing feels like pipe dream, even though location data people already giving Google/Facebook/Apple/Microsoft free. ""He could done everything 100% right books get go, would sitting posting mad actions.""  


This would I'd expected POSOTUS, would LOVED see it! Hell, complained! body right mind could have, unlikely hypothetical situation. actually things correctly book would freaking amazing! Would damn sight better deadly shit-show US experiencing right now, know. 
So, though nice way try deflect fact despite absolutely, horribly, god-awfully terribly length term, far, awful lot people seem still support him. makes sense, are. get ‚Äúinept world leader mode‚Äù Plague, Inc. basically playing ez mode? Lets get cocky here. Trans-humanist agenda mf weird. Y‚Äôall love Corona Virus don‚Äôt y‚Äôall LMAO cares act ends weeks. florida goes another lock down, people going fucked. upticks mainly areas lean red

Since Los Angeles County lean red? ending soon - $600 extra per week reason economy isn‚Äôt shambles. soon does, fucked. Two part question here- feel free comment either both! 

1.) saw Red Cross free antibody testing blood donations signed one next week local church small Tennessean town. Now, TN news much yet seeing results comparable news-worthy states like Florida, wouldn‚Äôt say well. Today highest single day increase entire pandemic, governor unconcerned idiot, weekly positive test rate hovering around/over 6% sign going (last week 12% positive day).  reconsider attending blood drive? risks contracting type environment? anyone else given blood recently explain safe experience seemed?

2.) days ago (actually 12% positive day) governor stated 20% icu beds available statewide crisis basically things looking good. know aren‚Äôt crisis, yet, 20% availability sounds really bad seeing STILL protests/marches happening thousands showing numbers suddenly going pretty quickly. 20% icu availability concerning sounds? trying gauge reaction/thinking here. terrible numbers. trendlines going wrong direction. Thank you. feel like grasp drinking, I'm choosing drink alot? make Alcoholic? know anymore. I've quit drinking years, everytime drink necessarily get drunk. appreciate advice homie think end everything alright. mom got covid spread family others. claims wore mask everywhere kind believe LA takes one time though. Thier zero chance economy going shutdown like march-may. Simple put people can't survive happens again. underestimate power stupid. Unfortunately Trump made political issue anyone wearing mask reference exacts comments. ""The democrats making bigger deal needs be"" citing doctors scientists democrats republicans :/

Nothing stop stupid unless direct effect family course. Regardless shouldn‚Äôt done imagine stressful really wish best. Dont forget about, dan ""there things important living"" patrick [Here's what's driving There‚Äôs place logic politics. imagine boring must kid. Feel bad :( UK 640 deaths per million US 386 per 61% parents infected children also got covid, 7% parents non-infected children. website says suggests parents passed children, understand way around?

Still quite worrisome. Especially possibility outbreak began cold chain. big impact restaurants. still looking efficient way prevent happening again. Yup UK basically America Europe.

Wtf way judge whole province [‚ÄúNo person asked proactively attended protest,‚Äù Avery Cohen, spokesperson de Blasio, wrote emailed response questions ""gone stupid"" news you! call Zonarona well alot especially churches liqor stores, ""Why can't go church people buy alcohol."" ignoring liqor stores arn't going people long transitory plus singing closly bunched up. Yep, completely unreasonable states go strict lockdown others stay open. borders way open Seeing shit makes glad live Hawai'i. 17 total deaths. bias front door.

I dont think gonna happen. knew user gonna here, furious.

People economy? kill of? one new cases. sucks. Hope need left pinky. Man reading comprehension thing it? Writing coherently either.

I said actions end killing people like you, anyone else going it.

And fine, like I'm saying hospitals capacity presents real problem number cases per day going increase capacity.

Now way going time? talking sides mouth said hospitals full time completely empty. proof. won‚Äôt another lockdown credited to? don‚Äôt care accurately classifying deaths it‚Äôs scary worrisome me. taking easy way reporting deaths spending time determine true cause indicates handling overflow cases tad bit better Historically speaking, young incredibly stupid always thought invincible. older family members told otherwise. contact tracing woul really help. \*stay home. Washington? Yes, influenza vaccine usually 40-50% effective Yeah issue Canada too. cases actually came snowbirds coming back beginning government trusting people self isolate weren't. I've heard RCMP (our police) call daily check people ensure it. Hopefully state able something like that. i'm going vent bit. 

i'm preschool teacher preparing reopen july 6th. spent last week preparing classroom, mostly relabeling organizing literally everything solitary activities. children can't play work together all. allowed group instruction time. still blows mind acceptable, ""safe"" prek students teachers rest schools open. 

on top that, teachers mandated wear masks children aren't. children hugely going spreaders yet teachers protected all. get childcare needed, childcare =/= preschool. there's hazard pay, extra resources given us funders ppe, etc. back work like going hugely unsafe everyone involved. feel like i'm crazy one feeling worried uncomfortable, sucks. Hey, here's idea, bring NBA Europe. Can't Cal. Republican Americans stupid* $1200 checks either ruling elite corporations took everything wanted exchange first pittance. Yes exactly. live small rural town people either don‚Äôt believe covid think it‚Äôs city problem. It‚Äôs not, people dying even yet absolutely one cares. needed complete nationwide lockdown 6 weeks, that‚Äôs would‚Äôve took would‚Äôve sitting pretty good. Like Netflix internet would‚Äôve comfortable leave house change people selfish, leaders stupid. I‚Äôm pissed right now. first wave still? 
Masks self sustaining Covid19 generator.


For someone transmit Covid19 face hands means put hand face without sanitizing washing hand, previously touched something someone else sanitize, someone else touched spewed Covid19 wearing mask.

If happens, probably would happened person catching wearing mask touched face anyway.


But less likely happen infected person mask begin spewing Covid19 place.

No matter much weak link infected persons mask is, still better openly spewing Covid19. warm moist air making face warm glasses fog getting trapped, would larger droplets. gets transmitted carrier.


It also takes one person scratching rear touching stuff, wearing assless chaps farting around public spread sorts diseases. one arguing running around bottomless like Porky Pig express Freedoms. One time lost important hockey game people rioted evening. Would worse that?  We‚Äôre gonna die mean America. awful places like Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, wow that's lot bad places too. Yeah...checks notes...you right. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want live planet anymore.‚Äù Someone people haven‚Äôt even received unemployment benefits yet.  It‚Äôs deal things. outlook. Thank you. 
--cosigned: humanity can't Americans understand whole world revolve around America?? us countries Trump cringey meme, policies developments give crap what's going America. schools start July Southern states reopening restrictions well protests started.

Those states hardest hit.

One hell coincidence. Let's definitely blame protests, though üôÑ least feet aren‚Äôt gross wife isn‚Äôt ugly Glad sciencing out. 


I've hearing drug trials antibiotics treat COVID-19. first like, ""This make sense. virus, bacterium."" realized maybe antibiotics aimed secondary infections rather COVID-19 itself. That's feel common cold course people say ""Man Flu"".  Probably early. Either wait symptoms least days. Churches survive donations. People urged continue donate churches. Obviously. illegal leave state? average patient died covid 80 aka average life expectancy. always fond Greek Mythology somehow escaped me. Thank much. I‚Äôm actually shocked Trump hasn‚Äôt seized this.. claims wearing mask political statement surely say ‚Äúmasks dumb, buy supports constitution trumping governor makes ware one‚Äù Restaurant owner here. People seem get this. Even 50% capacity actually worse restaurants open. fully staff, still handcuffed revenue. That's genuinely good hear. What's point trying make, though? phone. blatantly wrong misleading. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre talking read trying fear monger. Yes bad. Yes it‚Äôs widespread. Yes need shut things longer. 

No chance hospitalization isn‚Äôt early pandemic. [Read CDC director estimated they‚Äôre missing 1 10 infections. assume estimation similar across age ranges (it‚Äôs we‚Äôre definitely missing younger cases old), CDCs numbers 1 500 cases youngish people result hospitalization. acronymception Florida income tax. all. depend completely tourism. Profs school protesting schools administration hard. Right it‚Äôs gonna decide student want online F2F. Looks like 50-50 deal sneaking suspicion it‚Äôll online. couple coworkers asked go bar/restaurant today looking good reason go. Luckily looked current #‚Äôs decided stay home. get people need escape mental health, damn. numbers tell us two things people getting sick faster, sick people ones getting test done number likely 75% real number. much like back work need rethink social distancing, limit restaurant capacity 40%, restaurant/Bars tables 6ft apart make shopping online pick up. People clearly aren‚Äôt gonna stay home need make rules dummy proof. please people need social interaction go close friends house restaurant literally anyone anywhere come go please. Hey man, thats bad dude. means fucking drowning last ditch effort time. Southern states reopening restrictions George Floyd even murdered.

Those states hardest hit.

One hell coincidence. Let's definitely blame protests, though üôÑ Right, want clear meant time high lot testing. Testing today near march/april. sadly people caring less. live upstate NY things really bad here, maybe less 5 new cases county. total state less 1% positives people tested state. nearly 25% 2 months ago. Plus qualify test, practically get one almost reason. Another reason won‚Äôt end selfish people Proving bigger idiot!  isnt highest daily count ever? therapists every day. hard UPR sometimes, seeing results makes worthwhile. People really come around, learn empathetic, helps us grow well. Even vehemently disagree someone point, there's really something said able listen understand they're coming arrived decisions. GOP downplayed turns. shit real,stay vigilant. Mask up. Don‚Äôt stupid PREZ is. 122k real number Wrong. everyone worked together instead doomers (by calling us doomers), could dropped zero month back running. simply true everyone get it. countries great. fascist, science-denying, regulation-stripping, big-business loving, planet-killing countries poorly. basically one consistent thing last 40 years.

Go live streets dread throat cant pay bills anymore. guarantee rather take chances virus IFR 0,0 0,5. Rebekah Jones, GIS Analyst (geographic Information Systems), fired asked (and obviously refused) manipulate Florida's dashboard COVID-19 data.

This straight misrepresentation, refuted repeatedly. fired kept making public statements authorized to, repeated insubordination.She also stalker. really focus efforts trying figure largest portion deaths nursing homes Jokes actually wants dead could already study out? 

We‚Äôre entering period we‚Äôd expect see spike hospitalization? 6 hours later count 46.580.

There still protests there, yes no? Like honestly, imagine anti-science outright refuse even entertain idea packing people streets protests pandemic would result massive spread extremely transmissible disease might cast political leanings anything less shining light. Happy better.  Wow, tough situation. First all, idea could stop kids playing other, that's kids do.

If choice work would spend money get highest quality masks can. E.g. N95, KN95 (Chinese made high filtration mask) KF94 (Korean made high filtration mask get ebay days). work office situation KN95s seem good. work constantly sanitize wash hands, get home whole protocol -- take shoes door, immediately take clothes put pile washed, take shower. assume covered invisible virus dust. wrong receive death threats giant asshole probably continue speaking publicly invite more.  Congratulations. country done terrible fucking job. Testing, enforcing masks, competent leadership sending clear message, among things. probably aware things school did. certainly hired have, that's know phd. I'm going shocked even degree.

How relevant anything happening failed policies? Apparently canceled trip, coronavirus, instead defend statues ‚ÄúLAW &amp; ORDER‚Äù sky falling hell mean altering actual title much? keeps rising (likely) think might reverse steps bit. Reduce number people gather, reduce restaurant capacity etc. CDC estimates it‚Äôs 10 times least. flooding hospitals also risks deaths slowing care people non-virus related issues. Imagine heart attack, die hospital full get cardiologist time.  early last semester end friends districts? NY always went back early September min June. California it‚Äôs mandatory wear masks stores outside near people/social situations even walking street. Sucks trying hard early lockdown etc people refusing what‚Äôs needed end this. really news anyone? We‚Äôre curve here, it‚Äôs like numbers gonna decreasing (especially everyone ignoring quarantine).

European hotels love see American tourists. one planet willing pay 20√∑ extra every meal restaurant compared what's menu. Think !! little sad feels like big ‚ÄúF U‚Äù Trump wearing mask camera. took last week convince mother. sad 30 years count number times given reason one hand playing flight bumblebee piano. Stay smart fellow NYer. like fucking realize spikes happening across US. New England gang currently good shape, tons protests.

It's there's totally *not suspicious* correlation users blaming BLM protest recent spikes also post conservative leaning subs. feel like see headline every day downright depressing.  Seems mask little protective getting someone, regardless distance.its way effective preventing spread person wears one. everyone looked like never wore one.  Right? Stuck months dealt strict quarantine, see packed bars restaurants maskless TX. Mind blowing everyone aware happened NYC.  underrated comment sub mean sounds like would actually great. certainly hell lot cheaper.  That‚Äôs bad ass profile pic got bro FL fucking weak. haven‚Äôt given up, people financially struggling, unemployed, careless given due stress. People want over, treat like game patience. 

Too many people losing game.

I‚Äôm fucking courtesy myself, parents, community, sadly it‚Äôs taking toll me. I‚Äôm currently looking work staying home, therefore accept full responsibility actions, duty live. kick back figure want happening. know saw taskforce briefing. tell Fauci happy people. less 8% difference, also note reports update different times day cause discrepancy data. might stupid, point saying, city Kansas CITY ? 

Glad requiring masks though :) people want status. Judged material luxuries, poorest among us far richer king emperor historical times. NY Governor kills thousands never openly regrets anything applauded

This article nothing told porn give politically minded people boners mean? thought virus would go away ignored /s I‚Äôm referring child care place house. also, covid-*19* Actually, recommended wash hands longer. 20 seconds believe. actually furloughed month April applied unemployment day claim stuck ""pending"" seen cent (nor expect ever). zero confidence system worst happens. still conclusive evidence recovering virus grants long term immunity (which would required herd immunity) Yeah. know sound hyperbolic, we‚Äôve truly exhausted eastern seaboard. east coast Appalachian trail. Might check Vermont 
. First: apologize rude. intention. 
That said- going claim something, think reasonable ask source it. Thus far- haven't. I'd interested reading percentage people wearing masks, contexts- thus far, I've seen clips individuals- wrong frustrating, totally agree. enough claim anything like large majority. I'm back orginal stance, can't read linking.

Yes, we've already established know read stacked bar chart. Nothing surprising. real life, make stuff reddit clout?

Look post history. almost nothing infectious diseases, vaccines, etc. riffing point.

Versus...let's open everything back nothing bad happen...oh wait...bad happening... but...young people need hospitals! Oh wait... ICUs full. but...MY BARS!!! ideology failed. surprising. I've said, takes 8 weeks hard lockdown eliminate virtually respiratory virus we've encountered. 4 maximum cycles. surprise failure occurred lockdown ended early. need live consequences push failure. affects everyone differently. horrible disease cause long term damage, friend March STILL recovered. Hundreds thousands people died it. it, symptoms super mild, enough doctor (and I) don‚Äôt want risk positive spreading someone isn‚Äôt going lucky.

Just it‚Äôs emergency people doesn‚Äôt mean isn‚Äôt others.

COVID Clinic terrible reviews. no, according CDC guidelines, knows states actually listen that. couple states started reporting way early May, stopped believe. know COVID project data specifically filtered time. I'm sure nyt dealt it. fractions. basic statistics.

It disservice country future American graduate understanding mathematical concepts completely ingrained understanding elements world. cactus intact fine condition. human, hand.... think kinds retail stores open different stage restaurants, theaters, bars. (Assuming everyone wears mask) chance infected store quite low. outbreak big trending up, it'll take 2-3 months get control.   Ehhhh... slow charlie Absolutely amazing. rate, we'll literally another half million sick people less 2 weeks. u increase day %will drop Nope. current trend states resurging began mid-to-late May ***before protests***.

Yes, protests impact, primary contributing factor. go check number cases per day states like Texas pretty clear current trend started week 28th May.

[Johhs Hopkins nice UI exploring can't possibly think Trump responsibility this. 

He encourages embraces reality denial well distrusting educated.

... odd huge percentage people masks support him.

But agree problem goes deeper Trump, happens obvious ugliest manifestation  many realize! 1st wave states! constitutional rights can‚Äôt even directly name? /s Unemployment bankrupt week now. Agree said except last sentence. People could save fellow man 100 years ago. mask opponents well. 

They worst part we‚Äôve learned nothing 100 years. He‚Äôs asking question. He‚Äôs framing certain way assumptions findings back up. spitting typical talking points deniers say. I'm NY even know Texas gotta football. looking forward new season like teams draft choices year I'd rather wait risk lasting lung damage. Tom Brady practice wants though. XD agree. There's way say certainty live body, steeled away type cell go dormant awhile eventually re-emerge. virus simply long enough us able know something like that. possible know right earliest infection 7 months ago. scary fuck, long term health effects infection complete unknown. Ironically no. Poorer areas trend younger aren‚Äôt hit virus level. 

Sub Saharan Africa looking pretty safe right Italy ravaged. he‚Äôs fired end day. then, hopefully, protest/riot enough energy scare right thing. St. Louis school district checking in. correct. It‚Äôs air, know much know. It‚Äôs crazy since spring break. School districts designed work teach home. appreciate everything parents do! Fuck us all. Also huge state prison industry Abilene. pulled four times there, got warning tickets I‚Äôm white guess. Imagine stupid blame huge spike COVID cases Southern states (who reopened early restrictions) BLM protests üòÇ stunningly high... fuck Woah buddy!!  That's traitor speak! /s stunningly high... fuck apply unemployment laid off? Dr John Campbell great academic teacher, he‚Äôs emergency nurse. Dr. Fauci one, the, worlds leading experts infectious diseases good news: death rates dropped since beginning pandemic, less people percentage dying due better faster treatment.

The bad news: literally everything else Idk see people pointing memorial day (May 25th) places started wantonly ignoring states orders social distance. first protests 26th may. Totally agree. definitely won‚Äôt anything it‚Äîwe continue IGNORE it‚Äîthat seems working well issues./s
It‚Äôs American way! Help. Us. Something better nothing. Gotta start somewhere, sincerely hope leads trend Florida overall taking thing way seriously now. Clearly didn‚Äôt pay attention theology classes. You‚Äôre confusing symbology underlying messages. Sarcasm ahead:

On BRIGHT side, rate, we'll achieve ""herd immunity"" record-breaking shorter ever time. Everybody either recovered antibodies died. nasty virus anyone left infect except newborns shut-ins. 

We'll able ""thank"" stupid people presently ignoring masks-in-public mandates going parties, churches, produce sections grocery store though nothing wrong world. Sadly, mask requirement California seems enforced poorly 25 mph speed limit residential neighborhoods. i.e. all. Taking bets. We're hitting 60k daily cases next week. I‚Äôm hoping dead people. People US idiots science denialism.  really hope Fauci snaps one day goes fake people telling us lies brain understand what's going on.  co-worker went vacation (10 hour, multiple State hopping, drive) week. I‚Äôm going keep distance returns. Yeah I‚Äôve home March 12. Remind 3 months. started talking nyc guy talking ny. NY peak 11k cases per day, ny population 19m. 

NYC peak 6k. 2.6 times 15.6. Better full lockdown. Hello, fellow mental health care worker. &lt;3 hope staying well taking care this. wouldn‚Äôt count fucks stop. People don‚Äôt believe science care human life don‚Äôt change minds easily. don‚Äôt fuckin‚Äô get it. Otherwise smart people, too. hell happened country? Well I've seen lots videos it, seems pollution ridden pretty much dump sky scrapers falling part. Imagine stupid blame huge spike COVID cases Southern states (who reopened early restrictions) BLM protests üòÇ I'm sure he''ll pay polls,  (texas probably vote even goes everyone's house coughs them) bet another shelter place style lockdown mid July, time it‚Äôs less effective even greater percentage people don‚Äôt give af. extra unemployment goes away July 31st people need go back work lockdown lifted rush reopen repeat entire process vaccine comes out. Fuck dude. I‚Äôd tell go home would quarantine hotspot state. üòÇ Imagine stupid blame huge spike COVID cases Southern states (who reopened early restrictions) BLM protests üòÇ mortality rate stood firm 11% past several months. current 1.35 million active cases. means 150 000 lives stake. Every day add 50 000 new cases, that‚Äôs 5500 future deaths. estimate deaths top million. 18 - 30 months finally get grip think DJT charged murder every single death.

I hope body count lasting legacy. wouldnt right mind going bar restaurant now.

I feel empathy establishments. local bar open street, put money remodel making place way nicer old abandoned building. he's punished customers uncertain future.

Would like could give guys us real economic assistance beyond July 30 karen destroyed america :( Don‚Äôt listen EaglesNumberOne he‚Äôs lunatic think combo factors. people getting tested testing people symptoms. learning works treatment better finally young people getting stupid crap like going spring break, protesting huge crowds. Washington brought first covid epicenter, murder hornets, CHOP, sheriff calling mask-wearers sheeple.

I think know writers live. They're obviously writing kind Neverending Story/Jumanji type book, must stopped! I'm sorry, thought process disgusting. Instead embracing good news aching deaths bc would right. deleted last comment making fun disabled ppl? Back early May, emergency root canal surprised Alabama lot people masks. ones would see without mask literally white men. lie.

I saw woman 3 kids masks fucking husband didn't. fuck. last 20 years repeatedly shown U.S. failing empire. r/NobodyAsked

There's probably lot things getting rid cakes general? customizations? Correct I‚Äôm wrong, due herd immunity even 80% population gets it‚Äôs still going keep almost 100% population getting it? think mass gatherings spread respiratory virii? alcohol cripples immune system, might wanna lay gas live high risk arsa Legit question, know it‚Äôs safe long term? causes issues 5 years line? Don‚Äôt usually test vaccines 5-10 years? Oh definitely problem. get it, Cops lie put people away life, hell we've proof people death row innocent, refused let appeal anyways killed them. 

They literally executed dude year merely house guy killed cop. Unarmed everything. 

Meanwhile, government acted help black community PANDEMIC despite dying alarming rates. dont blame telling government fuck off. 

Might effective mail survey mail instructions do. Maybe Latin America. USA USA USA USA USA... right? Oh.... Especially since already willingly ~~smartphones ~~ surveillance devices tracking every movement lol -118 active cases bringing 1918!

I hope keeps decreasing keep border shut.

I still see American plates wonder get here. read Americans using loopholes cross border Canada. danger hospitals overtaxed, nearly (at least, cities nearby prefectures), everyone knows government suppressing reporting testing. I've heard far fewer people public coughing usual (mostly guess they're either staying home truly withering stinkeye everyone gives sends packing), look around, person almost always wearing mask, helps, especially we're crammed together. need masks filter 100% virus prevent spreading. enough bring Rt 1.

It's realistic test people without symptoms, keep testing (because negative today, still get infected tomorrow). Southern states reopening restrictions George Floyd even murdered.

Those states hardest hit.

One hell coincidence. Let's definitely blame BLM protests, though üôÑ Without human beings, there's society. ‚ÄúDeaths‚Äù *whose Meanwhile Ontario got 110, BC reported 10.  get Trudeau extending border lock month month basis, way we're opening long time.  reason they'd go month month piss white house. body slowly dying ~~vat~~ apartment. wow ur really complaining able make rent ur shitty business ideas failed literally murdering innocent black people streets. grow Victory america haters people want shut things down! since deaths flat, testing up, news consistently leaves fact... ask self people want repeating fake news. thanks joe rogan encouraging people wear masks  Yes, we're desperately trying like you. Unfortunately, we're edgy angsty enough. Perhaps universal health care respected leader. saw padlocking people inside homes china knew something terrible coming. md then? kind medicine practice? insurance cover it'll pre-existing conditions. is, GOP succeeds destroying Obamacare. I've noticed difference, people, last couple days. masks less people out. run store, late evening, nobody roads. Friday night late June quiet seems like dead winter. keeps making statements draw attention. ‚ÄúLet clarify said that.‚Äù Seems like clever way point precisely things wants talk about, pretend like he‚Äôs still defend Trump goes details, gives message health experts everywhere focus on. big part it, like not. like Trump‚Äôs stupid rallies awesome, I‚Äôm legit terrified get vaccine released quickly. keep thinking polio one manufacturing issue gave kids polio IIRC. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu Southern states reopening restrictions George Floyd even murdered.

Those states hardest hit.

One hell coincidence. Let's definitely blame BLM protests, though üôÑ true! Many folks able pick year's worth toilet paper back March! that's prepared know is...! /s roommate girlfriend one. They‚Äôre still waiting test back luckily staying house last couple weeks, shit fucked wonder started printing bright red G masks could get everyone mask up. one specifically said hibernate person say Corona go away warmer weather ""some say"" ""it"" could also come back. I'm mentioning names. Sounds better old schools.  Losing antibodies quickly losing immunity. herd immunity impossible, vaccine also impossible, case new normal never ends. hope that's case. yup. Buncha Typhoid MAGAs. Trust people make good decisions, saw presidential election right? People prove can‚Äôt trusted hahah guarantee watched shit every morning Cuomo Yanks can't take seriously. wonder many die Southern states reopening restrictions George Floyd even murdered.

Those states hardest hit.

One hell coincidence. Let's definitely blame BLM protests, though üôÑ know what's worse? hesitant lockdown again, we've already spent shit ton money combating thing. think Mitch McConnell happy giving stimulus money out. 

They fucked up. warning against. opened soon squandered progress we've made. Southern states reopening restrictions George Floyd even murdered.

Those states hardest hit.

One hell coincidence. Let's definitely blame BLM protests, though üôÑ  Stop fucking removing posts. political, all. seriously looking background levels infection rather main two infectious strains? B (Victoria) H1N1 2009? Wow. even slower thought. maintained 50-80 infections per week, flu season. 

Here. go back January 2020 see contagionlive website says... Nope - actually good thing we‚Äôre heading toward herd immunity US denying racism? 

Reread pal, accused listening people do. would like denying human nature lol. 

LOL world LOLs you? truly believe Floyd execution racially motivated?

Why ask this? Would make upset? prove one pattern time shows true? funny many non racist incidents combine pattern distinctly racist.

 see America problem racism since inception must wilfully blind. woven constitution compromises states entering union. problems created stay us day disproportionately impact black America. question people really believe Black Lives Matter.


 hard understand said. reply Lives Matter taught say duplicitous racists deny America's history say BLM denying value others. dupes believe parrot nonsense.


So Floyd execution seen part SOP police impact racist. cops afraid citizens. citizens guns 2nd gun culture. fear based police training lead problems? Yes! disproportionately impact black America? Yep. think might led ignoring problem? 

And gun culture, 2nd meant that? meant allow slave states means keep slaves check? one initial compromises? Well see things? Wait, what?? Sauce please? Sounds like stereotype. Reporting typically lags weekends, never know. least say #1 again. Fuck shit Fuck president. moron retarded ideas last thing need right now. Southern states reopening restrictions George Floyd even murdered.

Those states hardest hit.

One hell coincidence. Let's definitely blame BLM protests, though üôÑ Get facts straight. ‚ÄúThe average death rate average life expectancy‚Äù? even ability explain, actual numbers, mean? I‚Äôm guess no, that‚Äôs nonsense. face covering reducing transmission others, protection oneself. wear non-disposable cloth mask sewn friend whenever I‚Äôm public others less risk near me, way around. Go go go US &amp; A, great country America, 3rd world world  childish spite...

If bubonic plague would still break quarantine, nothing aggressive stupidity childish spite... Pretty much countries group projects school. Teamwork US invention lol Missouri here. One district far reported either 5 day week capacity limits learning online learning. hybrid option capacity limits unless it‚Äôs enforced state county. Oh man like 2 months ago mean half people focusing protests riots What's funny looked Twitter many people mad closing bars infringing rights whatever. sides hate now. I'll surprised gets re-elected. Oh gosh, I've using Japan prime example show friends helpful masks super strict lock necessary everyone plays part. Texans I'm talking about, another quarantine almost certainly necessary ://// Death number rise next 2 3 weeks. seem lower 3 months ago, probably doctors actually gotten better treating Covid-19.

Still, nobody wants get hospitalized disease. may live, seriously impact health rest life Tuesday? true Trump fashion ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è always taking credit everything. Ugh. try stay side bridge. Fuck beach traffic. profit medical industry. millions COVID survivors permanent, chronic health issues need medical care years 2020. Permanent Lung issues, kidney issues, blood clotting issues, sterility issues, nuerological issues. cannot understand level stupid. ActualGrownManchild [48,891  Cancel subscription month? school start September y'all different? #outoftheloop call reporting highest yet tomorrow! want karma. many people conspiracy conservative subs saying mainstream media overblowing dangerous mostly old people dying. 

But old people dying cause concern too? least family. social distance, least spread parents grandparents. Texas feel like usually start school late August July August hottest months. I‚Äôve always heard save money AC bills, knows haha Cases upswing mid-to-late May. major national BLM protests started 29th May would impacted REPORTED cases week two weeks later. True enough wife championing Free Girls movement. She‚Äôll go out, walk stores. Drive thrus fair game though. Somebody respectable Dear lord don‚Äôt disagree government mishandling situation greatly. It‚Äôs completely reaction say ‚Äúthis hell earth‚Äù though. literally many situations third world countries places civil unrest comparing to. situations could understand using terms ‚Äúhell earth‚Äù responsibility people government officials longer taking responsibility action controlling virus? He's begging community avoid large gatherings, stay home, wear mask. 

But fourth July weekend freedomiest freedomfest freedom celebrations! deep shit.  saying people shouldn‚Äôt work? Maybe don‚Äôt work time maybe much. need robots. Current CFR US 5.0% Well we're tracing douche bags, tremendous help. Thanks. got batshit crazy chick. else need? Except people [rural catching COVID-19. takes one person traveling city back, common. bam, infected population acts can‚Äôt get infected. need treatment, could go area hospital may hours away, under-equipped understaffed handle pandemic.

If US continues lag behind sufficient testing surveillance, Rural America may end devastated pandemic way far long lasting cities. also *ridiculously* spread out. lucky first push basically spiked NYC metro parts PNW‚Äîand places *immediately-ish* saw bad things getting locked fuck down. 

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs way get someplace like Phoenix DFW suburbs thing. fact anybody brings question gets downvoted hilarious me. 50 years institutionalized distrust science expertise leading rampant politicization common sense mitigation steps. poorer kids inconsistent/nonexistent access internet, hunger pains rely school lunches, going fall way behind. parents need work can't afford 5 day week childcare, gonna do? fucking tragic see coming far likely enough done prevent many places across country. Forgot /s whole planet every species better without humans around Strong little buggers. link people really saying kind thing?  /s Alternate headline: Texas much face impending hospital meltdown. aware ‚Äúover hump‚Äù basically means critical mass infections eventually everyone potentially die?  44k Tldr... I'm gonna assume says something like testing, quarantine, contact tracing, masks washing hands.

All feel like everyone know now, America gonna Murica.  listed morning too. Joe absolutely kidding fishing response Burr. He's cover tracks now. also said CDC full shit episode. generally huge vector coronavirus disinformation past 8 weeks. unironically said Comedy Clubs essential business day. Joe changes opinion anything feels like depending guest. contradicts like one else. thought gyms theaters removed? Among others? Spanish flu killed 600,000 Americans....over period 26 months, February 1918 April 1920.

COVID killed 127,000 4.5 months.

Let‚Äôs check back August 2022 see compare. 44k! Holy shit  someone make happen please? feel like Fauci hold tongue basically 90% time frustrates him.  How? don‚Äôt Ron Burgandy they‚Äôre it? travel somewhere (lucky -_-) said would like half capacity. lied completely filled. Masks required everyone wore one still. want bunch pictures random people ICU? gonna get release forms that? Doctors take pictures random unsuspecting people hospital Wish Texas would also let citizens vote mail November. Define 'good portion' unless access data rest us don't, 'bought fake narrative' get make facts order agenda. phase 4 everything open. Social distancing still required, well masks. that's it. thing that, right there, I‚Äôd afraid husband ending like MIL ‚Äì father generally left-of-center liberal, got older, racist ass coworkers‚Äô opinions ‚Äúentertained‚Äù polite started seep in.

Then went full Fox News us, don‚Äôt speak all, sanity‚Äôs sake. lot privileged people conditioned think humanity control everything. Therefore something bad happens, someone caused it. Scary. I‚Äôm 26 üòû 

I‚Äôm sorry loss. want get covid, fly. know else say.

This facile argument. issue get it, issue spread disease. People get plane go destinations expose others. Fine, fly must want risk mitigated effort within confines plane social distance.

Personally fly days. Planes petrie dishes is. heard somewhere Houston hospitals already near peak surge, mostly non Corona related understand wave basically big ripple ocean. Storm surges tsunamis bit different though, caused atmospheric pressure. essentially big force pushing ocean atmosphere. big storm, pressure low, nothing pushing water actual water level raises floods land.

But think tsunamis also caused earthquakes things. 100% sure differ storm surges tbh Oh yeah means trying make Abbot sound good, absolutely double-speak executive order could either take credit distance depending things went. 

But I‚Äôm surprised took long local governments put test though, isn‚Äôt governor position Texas historically hands-off lot states? go ahead send kids school bc ""need break"" can't bothered them. I'll keep mine home safe. TBH, way China handled Beijing outbreak shows China reopen (as well Korea):

fast identify, large scale testing, maximum contract tracing, regional lockdown, damage would much less compare full scale lockdown (comsidering economic)

ps: Chinese soccer fan, I'm kinda frustrated soccer league. FA submitted league start plan many times, got denied everytime... cinema, considering bars night clubs opened, little bit overreacting needed good news badly. governor going shut beaches? pay funeral industry?  Right least seems worst Western World. Anything bad life Satan. remember Satan right? guy added Bible way creation make scared follow God? good old God punishing you. now, God scape goat. Good God, bad Satan. nothing would actually like sending plagues flooding whole world blamed him. exactly like seatbelts.

What moron. even taking seriously even affects personally. interview guy last week said friend died him, still ended going Tulsa rally Oh lord Dr. Oz... mom would notebook write EVERYTHING guy said take herbally would dump shit smoothie. Tasted like turds too. Tried tell mixing herbs dangerous mixing pills got 'No, herbs natural' response.

She also thought doctors money pushing pills. help pointing herbal supplements indeed thing quacks vend money fact guy show TV screams he's money, waste much oxygen trying reason people. Yes. localized shutdowns beginning, would better. Interesting moving fast.

What plan phase 4? Since many industries still covered, far know isn‚Äôt phase 5 think long term effects CoV-SARS-2 is?

And data basing on? Mayor County judge repeatedly tried right thing Harris county Abbott kept undermining efforts. fucked. Thanks conservatives need learn? Haha 5% tested positive. Like else would learn? think long term effects CoV-SARS-2 is?  data basing on?

what think long term effects CoV-SARS-2 is?

And data basing on? percentage seems keep dropping. think depends prior sample makeup. tests previously done sick people population going X% positive. expand include types people you‚Äôd expect increase positive ratio-wise sample type changed include asymptomatic maybe going hospital. 

http://rt.live good way look rate change controlling types variables. idea model real rate increase. second order derivative, measure rate change changing (e.g. rate increase *itself* increasing?).

Need keep mind sick population size begin though. instance Hawai‚Äôi high Rt (high rate many people one person infects, therefore growing population sick people) small percentage people actually sick begin with. one person may infect 1.4 people, start 20 people go 28. rate change high actual number people infected lower. state like Florida already 5,000 would 7,000 next day. 

I chose numbers purpose btw. Hawai‚Äôi Florida similar Rt, drastically different implications. number increases roughly what‚Äôs reported last couple days. 

The thing watch hospitalizations ICU use. helps adjusting increase testing numbers catching people sick sick they‚Äôre intubated dying.

Where I‚Äôm (California) positive tests increasing hospitalizations flat. implies that, moment, we‚Äôre probably catching people aren‚Äôt placed intensive care.

This point time though. fully expect ICU intake start increasing. it‚Äôs worse states. example, good luck Texas Florida. Yeah, could seen coming? /s elect (R) governors. Yep fully masked, beverage food options available main cabin, less masks going eating drinking. Also tried arrange seats people parallel aisle seats, aisle seats staggered

People going fly occassions. Cutting amenities seats, well vigilant cleaning seat area, cuts lot danger out. Wear mask, gloves boarding much disinfectant wipes pack. got frustrating expert stuck ""post-expert"" country. epidemiologists medical professionals subscribe ""theory""? Exactly. number critical / severe cases important stat keep eye on, bellwether future deaths. number going recently first time weeks. sad. Trump got roned Lots inland rural Northern California still doesn‚Äôt believe COVID real. then, course, there‚Äôs land behind Orange Curtain sheriff come said won‚Äôt anything enforce mask laws (and IIRC also encouraged people wear masks rights *probably* wrong that). Biden said today he‚Äôd make masks mandatory. think he‚Äôll lose election. People lost minds masks - told do. Reading social media reactions proposed school requirements tells moment Biden lost. Election time death: 6/26/2020. Well peruse local news places, officials begging protesters get tested. don‚Äôt really know yet. noticed increases. wonder it‚Äôs possible protests couldn‚Äôt contributed. Seriously, I‚Äôd love explanation tens thousands people clustered shoulder shoulder screaming didn‚Äôt increase cases. They're literally cooking books. Wow. cost couple thousand basic coronavirus test done? would've thought pretty high barrier controlling Covid-19.
What suggest state &amp; federal governments now? three five months info way make sure 1) wear masks exposed/around others/in gas stations 2) sanitize hands upon getting back car 3) avoid touching anything unnecessary public space 4) minimize time spent outside car public space others present, actually decrease potential exposure quite bit. catch car, especially minimizing time gas stations wearing mask glasses help reduce exposure brief periods spaces others present. Finally, I'll add see anyone without mask speaking coughing close despite efforts distance, could like spare shirt something change return car. Also remember strong direct sunlight kill COVID‚Äê19 viral particles surfaces within matter couple minutes (inside objects water droplets gets complicated). could use advantage: buy apple gas station cashier handles it, face bit risk contamination touch apple face. Leave sunlight two minutes, chances contamination happening fall drastically. gotta ruin good time facts? fully reopen.  planet needs enema Maybe BLM protests over? I‚Äôd rather accurately informed always taking everything worse believing every media hyped headline. They‚Äôre trying scare clicks too.

&amp;#x200B;

Since want accurately informed, think long term effects CoV-SARS-2 is?  


And data basing on? wish imaginary evil blame failures sound pious time. true course

I mean...it though. IFR literally &lt;0.5% people 60. remember mayor NYC scoffed Trump banning travel China told people go catch play ignore Corona late March.

Found DT supporter. Another factor think people considering case turns workplace, shuts everyone contact tested go back work, regardless whether symptoms. also drives demand tests, probably finding positives would found otherwise. irony reopening. Look last 100 years, hitler's numbers dwarfed leftists governments 10 fold. Whats truly sad country 5 months prepare have.... This. may different immune reactions common exposures us industrialized world do. example, theorized exposure weaker coronaviruses helps little one. may coronavirus-based colds there, may type virus offers cross-immunity. effing glad return work RN, dim bulbs would kill me...Not worth age. anniversary Sept.. speed little?

 (Only half joking...) they‚Äôre slowing now!!! rolling back mask enforcement according Gov DeSantis. It‚Äôs definitely time reopen Disney World They've 100 outbreaks Israel schools That‚Äôs happens thousands people flood streets together. protests fuel increases. They'll microwave book wear face mask.

Fuck. I'm optimistic sure hope prove wrong. lol Please tell things Oklahoma‚Äôs governor. fucked. hospitals may able handle end many people going die unnecessarily. looking one earlier find shows decline.

11% decline yet look positives. kept testing 15k easy day think that‚Äôs hipster idea hipster is. Everything I've seen says possible, far less likely getting though air. That's reason enough take seconds takes wipe something bring home wash hands. It‚Äôs difficult, sure mask long bit uncomfortable, gets point it‚Äôs bothering you, go outside away people take like minute two breathe return inside. (Obviously really something makes almost impossible breathe that‚Äôs different) much numbers. compute. Almost guaranteed 30 younger, ever lived US. Probably Texas something. London several bars pivoted. Bottled drinks selling across country. might option. started delivering locally. going hit 50k/day new cases pretty soon too....  know, assume public health system run &amp; Govt failed implement basic social distancing properly. Also recently closed borders.
The strange thing mainstream media seem aware this. no, that's insane. that's even close reality. clearly thought facebook lived quiet life hurry, hurry partly life, think quiet life far superior hurry, hurry party life. love slowing smelling roses. what? People catch eventually. Life go on. shut ins realize Thanks Like shocked asymptomatic people could spread it? Meanwhile conspiracy subs hundreds Bizarre right? I'm starting think form trauma-based mind control mean - election year. massive gaslighting going throughout media.  insanity driven media influence leftist politicians across world. [Well, US already purchased 300 million doses even Phase 3 trial part Warp Speed Gates foundation thing made right   majority Americans believe this, live like cave hermit do? leave house work acquire food. do, even though glasses fog barely breathe, wear mask quickly accomplish objectives return cave. Honestly dumb take. Like people really think people wanted get hair cut? Like really think that? mean honest need entire overhaul state federal laws. joke long I've alive, state laws (while archaic technically enforceable) downright absurd. saw, god help me, tik tok police officer talks laws. Like California, can't drive car reverse. Also California, illegal woman drive car housecoat. 

All drugs need decriminalized, least cannabis. enough proof states like mine (WA), CA, CO, etc. made marijuana legal years seen little negative repercussions. Weed treated like alcohol here, smoke drive subject drunk driving punishments steep WA. guy needs go... Nah I'd figure bit like dad, UK. painfully slow burn relative decline coupled denial.

The US suddenly disappear, location makes uniquely resistant conquering climatic agricultural failure still one largest countries world big market.

It get used big country, voice amongst others. supreme voice.
Problem is, nobody top accept it.
The UK accepted almost 70 years empire dwindled Righhhhht. Projections Florida going 22k cases day understand people commenting critical restaurant bar owners, somewhere open, mean go there. set foot crowded place least month hear supposedly ""safe"" so. I'll wait see stats like, first, even though live one UK's least infected cities. Maybe I'll wait I've vaccinated. Ywah thats I've hearing vaccine lot. technology experience books. We've advanced science since Spanish flu. like can't understand people think best things earth might put God. Maybe God helped society things made little Billy catch horrific diseases. Nope, miracle nothing. mean go ages since anyone's anything good say us!  lack leadership this, starting top. Unfortunately looks :( 

Fingers crossed improves soon though. 2020 kinda one-two combo us far 

Stay safe &lt;3 USA almost 1/3 new cases world. Wtf. isn‚Äôt meant. ""Our hope prayer case"" evidence support this? dumb prejudice take. know alcohol haircuts right? calling people rednecks really help case either.

I'm honestly amazed auto-correct let type without kicking balls. Here's word I'm hearing anecdotally doctors today Houston.

1. There's ICU shortage.
2. enough time understand virus people dying like used to.
3. infected attended one three places: bars, protests tubing. CA: Hold beer.  infections grow much much larger rate, exponential growth motherfucker. Hopefully since supposedly young people deaths go crazy, unfortunately way hospitals looking everyone might get bed. Insurance companies going like lol I'm surprised hear California spiking, I'm la masks required months now. la only? guess assumed state wide.

*Edit* I'm mainly referring indoors close proximity others actually dangerous. even let enter without mask I'm 100% support that. Outside feel social distancing enough wear one, seldom leave house fuck virus.... *testicles* now... can't imagine stress parent elderly parents situation.

Typical scenario bet: college-age son daughter cavalier COVID despite best efforts knock common sense thick skulls. matter, they're tired social life (what buzz kill days) go beach party come home basically kill mom dad whatever they've picked up.

It‚Äôs piece mind, way it‚Äôs social distance. Don‚Äôt fly want social distance. personally don‚Äôt trust airlines, people getting worse. curve trends down, I‚Äôd consider flight, preferably delta provide better overall hard product.

The false positives range 16%-70%, that's serologic tests matched testing we've done make IFR look artificially lower is.  


The prevalence Covid-19 estimated around 5% US, low level risk false positives becomes major problem. serological test 90% specificity, positive predictive value 32.1% ‚Äì meaning nearly 70% positive results likely false. disease prevalence, test 95% specificity lead 50% chance positive result wrong. 99% specificity false positive rate become anywhere near acceptable, even chances 16% positive results would wrong.¬† Right!

:-)  EU: **hell naw**  take accountability #Translation

State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell noticeably annoyed fact World Health Organization designated Sweden - along countries Azerbaijan Kazakhstan - particular risk country infection.

WHO later became milder tone, remove Sweden list risk countries.


It started warning significantly increased spread corona virus risks pushing health care number countries limit handle autumn, seasonal flu also expected require care resources.

Eleven countries selected - including Sweden.

""For weeks talked risk increased spread countries adjust virus measures. several countries Europe risk become reality - 30 countries number new cumulative cases increased last two weeks,"" said WHO's Europe -responsible Hans Henri Kluge according press release.

The countries listed addition Sweden were: Armenia, Moldova, Northern Macedonia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Albania, Bosnia Herzegovina, Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine Kosovo.

These countries part responsibility WHO's Europe department.

#""Clear decline""

According Anders Tegnell, interpreted figures wrong way regard Sweden.

""It rise Sweden, clear decline,"" told TT.

- looked number new confirmed cases per day, increasing recently started offering tests everyone symptoms. twice many tests compared week ago, course find many cases. increase see mild cases, inpatient cases. repeatedly argued many different contexts enough look single data source assess evolution epidemic, Tegnell said.

TT: looking instead, get accurate picture opinion?


- stable source number intensive care units. certainly tip iceberg, stable peak, see decline long time. single admissions Stockholm regions.

#Remains list


Following Tegnell's criticism, sent press release Friday afternoon tone Sweden significantly mitigated. organization acknowledged increased testing reflected number new confirmed cases.


**""However, important note proportion positive results among tested stable around 12 13 percent. indicates Sweden still societal spread,""** spokesperson writes.


WHO highlighted declining number new deaths new cases severe covid-19 disease ""very positive"" trends Sweden.

""Sweden able keep spread infection levels managed Swedish health care,"" stated press release Friday afternoon.

But press release, clarify whether Sweden removed list not.

However, evening, long series calls TT, organization confirmed Sweden remains list.


**""The situation changed**,"" writes Stephanie Brickman WHO's press service email TT.


#""Better understanding""


Anders Tegnell also pointed number deaths covid-19 Sweden decreased.


- still number people die covid every day, longer excess mortality. people die Sweden week corresponding period previous years.


TT: receive type information Sweden?


- No, reported continuously. provided basis Ministry Social Affairs, pass WHO. hope better understanding evolution epidemic Sweden, Tegnell said.

#""Constructive conversation""


Anders Tegnell found unfortunate dotted Sweden way.

- would better dialogue kind statement, especially discussion Europe countries travel travel to. really need nuanced picture real risk different countries, says Tegnell.

Social Minister Lena Hallengren (S) shares Tegnell's view WHO's statement ""is unfortunate"", says written statement TT.

""During afternoon, Ministry Social Affairs constructive conversation WHO's European office put forward."", also says. Alaska also blessed Canada physical border. country handled things infinitely better. Remember people would occasionally feel well days prior covid?

All stuff still exists.

Even highest estimates, (20m) 94% Americans Corona 

Your chances getting sick low shit nevermind, please reply. Fuck Greg Abbott. chart puts .09% 25 34. Seems same. youve contacted merchant theyve unavailable refused work credit company might chargeback. Worked airline tickets uh, Lol they‚Äôre definitely sarcastic. It‚Äôs tougher tell nowadays online there‚Äôs way user wasn‚Äôt making joke. edit /s tag feared people would take comment seriously well Central Florida around Villages area.. full restaurants, full golf courses, full community pools!!! whole retirement community thinks safe COVID immune bubble. participation trophy generation expect anything? lol Cause ignorant cuz much winning, hardly stand it! yet see unmitigated spread anywhere count, outside towns Lombardy 60%+ infected week lockdown.

It's nice US going find looks like rest world base decisions information. Though would lot useful we'd done March. Yeah work still head straight home. Bars business empty. Prevention actively get shat on. look Jimmy Carter. Oddly enough seems riots caused spread super wrong... think people outside shake hands, touch other, share drink can't catch virus? kind radioactive cumdumpster disease infection ... keep closed ones don‚Äôt care louder obnoxious do. China welded citizens apartment buildings stop spreading. Americans went spring break. Unfortunately, nobody interested happy medium saves lives. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúeveryone wear mask, social distance, take seriously‚Äù One best friends anti masker, said fight wherever =/


They also think dangerous.

I'm immunocompromised, kinda feels like told ""That thing think could kill you? paranoid wrong."" feels like... energy argue them. tips hotels? Thank you! doctor advised download app lap performing test. It‚Äôs frustrating seeing Texas 15k new cases week lab releasing results last week. can‚Äôt imagine next week going look like. downplayed back February: country moving quickly hell, degenerates! Brostrom fan? 

His point AI software going match humans intelligence, trillions IQ points beyond us. 

He‚Äôs far out, goes much deeper me. 

Highly recommended. 

Super Intelligence. *Facts entered chat* 
 
Let's go punch babies. It‚Äôs almost like novel virus didn‚Äôt totally understand first something God gave us doctors common sense too. Humans part. (I know, that's makes plausible) üòØ I'm sorry seem unable take constructive criticism instead interpret ""playground domination techniques"". inability address problem huge problem soceity, much convince one. 

I flinch admitting Denmark's problems. yet always hard Swedes admit any. ""my opinion"" provided big linkpile similar views. 

Not every country width opinion corrodior. Denmark press really basically attacking authorities pressers, unthikable Sweden German *sort of* (and even really much) called ""crazy"". 

The long run pretty clear see here. Sweden's strategy failed. fact, always *ethical* failure, even proved successful due abandonment precautionary principle face novel disease whose parameters still remain largely unknown. 

But anyway discussion really productive since seem take say insults, able consider good day you. Bible. 

These bible boppers use book pursue ideals extreme. make money people‚Äôs faith. none know wrote book, when, why, how.

Yet every single country deals extremism problem linked book. great power, comes great responsibility. book holds lot power. 

It‚Äôs like logic, reason, critical thinking don‚Äôt exist anymore. starting realize human isn‚Äôt human.  ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Slogan 2020 right there.  President good start. problem allowing full flights long term feasible thing seeing pandemic going long term. Sooner later airlines revert stay afloat. guidance help federal government requiring open seats helping defray cost airlines, expect this. smoking cigarettes countless health benefits..... says American Tobacco Industry Association. know bluest state country support. 

I mean Whitmer Michigan didn‚Äôt give shit neither he. I‚Äôm sure money absolutely nothing it. Oh all.  yes, sociopathic narcissist is, literally him. brain, stunted youth neglect, stuck emotional intelligence tween. believe truly believes saying- millions Americans wearing masks dislike HIM. Awesome. lip service opposed real action inevitably bring people already crowded spaces Florida. 

r/FloridaMan entirely new level 2020 justice, Rick DeSantis would get desserts worry though, cases drop dramatically Sunday giving everyone false hope start week again. Honestly, think contribute lot society‚Äôs ills , e.g. South Park‚Äôs extreme irreverence normalized behavior like Cartman‚Äôs, parody worst type person became something people accept idolize; great show, super funny, many people seemed miss ‚Äúthe point‚Äù growing worst bunch.

Still, think lot is:
* culture associating personality personal level, e.g. remember grandmother talking ‚Äúlunch Oprah‚Äù something such, meant going sit eat lunch watching Oprah; she‚Äôd talked TV, espouse opinions agreement disagreement, etc.; unusual, generation screaming tweets blue checkmarks
* much information, available instantaneously; generations used slow trickles, they‚Äôre bombarded every angle
* Corollary above, news considered factual, honest, least made attempt ‚Äì much media programming ‚Äúnews‚Äù channels provided opinion hosts (‚Äúentertainment programming‚Äù, broadcasters like call it)
* Politicians media figures constantly calling alleged lies ‚Äì real imagined ‚Äì caused people become suspicious
* Deluge ‚Äúfake news‚Äù produced troll farms Russia Macedonia
* Transition click-bait news articles, people jumping conclusions contents article based headline never seeking confirmation
* Following points, people either assume **all** media equally false worthy trust, *or* believe preferred talking-head ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù views conform own, refuse believe anything else


Bottom line ‚Äì society, species ‚Äì simply ready Internet. Many us simply capable handling free flow information, either terms raw processing and/or separation fact fiction. I'm worried outdoors, think gives lot people false sense security. indoor/outdoor culture people seem able establish line demarcation minds. Fauci correct, US serious problem.

All coronavirus deniers thought lockdown reason economy tanked may finally learn actually virus causing problem all. Hey I‚Äôve seen bumper sticker! might requirement, still see tons folks walking around without them. Whole Foods near doesn‚Äôt even bother enforcing tons people walk around masks dangling around necks I‚Äôve seen lazy enforcement, best, target walmart. NY still finding 700 cases day. don‚Äôt think say it‚Äôs control yet. beloved medical doctors failing mention high doses vitamin pretty much remove danger CoViD-19. good parent figure out. likely things contributed spike way another. can't ignore fact around large crowds close proximity cause spread matter protesting was. But, plain see states opened earliest totally screwed (FL, TX). state one biggest decreases cases officially went final opening phase today. Yes called evangelical Taliban knuckle dragging Neanderthal south. ‚ÄúIt starts coffee ends digital certificates forced vaccinations,‚Äù Gilles said.

The article also ‚ÄúParents low-income households least likely report send children school, 40 % reporting unsure plans planning sending least one children.‚Äù 

Which one it? jobs financial constraints pushing parents send kids back, would low income households LEAST likely send kids family babysit funds hire babysitter kids stay home. one us stay home watch likely lose house,"" one Ohio respondent said.

Ok, make sense low income households would sending kids back? brother law already ICU couple months ago (fortunately avoided needing ventilator). point, I'm even sure she'd change beliefs *she* got sick.

Im Western NY, NYC doesn‚Äôt learn states like NY, NJ, CT on. states already showed delay reopen wearing masks reduce infectious rate. ü§îü§î Should, sure. cater wealthy though so.... Yes don‚Äôt know many people infected right can‚Äôt use predict deaths either. every covid hospitalization requires ICU though right? Send world colonies free think whatever want. Yeah, like whatever particular version antivax stories follow lol  situation subway? packed? smashed previous daily record new cases.

**46,698 new cases reported today**, goddamn. Latin person confirm older generation especially hate following rules, degree really. combined overbearing predilection towards religious fait ""protecting"" caused this.

Let tell first generation family born raised America, whole event nightmare deal ti comes family community/culture. getting control turned political issue instead something everyone agreed science. worries even though way contagious deadly flu, majority people (especially younger ones) recover experience fairly mild symptoms. fully expect many group continue pushing ""it's flu"" narrative. Although people follow science know fractional percentage still means many thousands lives, may small enough impact lives ignorant directly behaviors change. post public Facebook kept commenting crazy stuff it. Even better, people found photos wearing masks political events, going supposed anti mask ideals. 

It literally says post wanted call police honestly that's threat enough days. nutter. course wants money. üôÑ  Ahh yes reopening week massive, maskless, gatherings across country. san diego checked +440 cases 6 deaths.  pos rate 6% 14 day avg 3.4%

San Diego reports another record day COVID-19 cases - there's question much able produce, get it. Logically, us wealthy areas advanced healthcare systems least need it. experiencing I'm basically gonna hold nerd rage people act like total twats fictional pandemics. author basically contrive scenario want based stupidity seems accurate life. awesome! thank random drug Trump promoted.

HCQ Covid treatment talked hopeful expectations within medical community, long Trump ever talking it. got politicized Trump started talking it, KNEW mainstream media would politicize fuck it. Suddenly ""he financial ties"" shit. sheep friend. MSM always agenda (ratings).

Also watch comment get deleted/banned WrongThink heard one liberal source mention definitely due protesters. soo quick say lock protesters violent virus spreaders. wake people used like pawns. hindsight, could checked info opened bars. maybe older generations, look younger generations kids making video games already, along movies youtube tv shows. Game engines 3D modeling software becoming free use. Everyone teaching things youtube amazing search engines lead us straight information. suck ads see getting better. see older generations taking advantage though, maybe they're tired. Porn always thing, nice food one going manipulate matter money buy sofa manipulate matter sofa. expand Mirroring unconditional positive regard? fix it? Keep wearing masks Ontario. 

You're right thing. seriously love logic! I'm gonna feel safe assume near protesting somehow would blame... nice. unfortunately might hard lesson people. people used Debit buy tickets, much less guarantee see money again, especially small local bank. learned hard way last year Pledge Music fiasco. company basically embezzled shitload money sort vanished thin air, got ripped fuck off. bank basically anything it. Ever since use cash-back AmEx non-cash purchases. Credit card companies refund money lot weapons pursue scumbag companies. fine king county many people believe community one Unavailable European readers... hope JetBlue stays business - go place go often soon... Yay stupid people getting unecessary attention. consider statements like ''playground domination techniques'', replies sorry offended you. easy Swedes, **I learn careful**. ''  examination recognition faults healthy weak. **I encourage try size**, even though know really hard Swedes.''

I already said journalists generally timid press conferences centralized opinions, every day criticism basically newspapers, Facebook groups, etc. personally felt German reporter Dagens ETC asked relevant questions, many others.

I bring slew problems Swedish handling pandemic, I've already brought think bad calls, good calls. due amount posting Sweden, think might covered them, I'll refrain clogging Reddits servers.

Unfortunately, I'm 1 person country 10 million, situated 6 hours Stockholm, region really hit pandemic major way. can't much alter particular problems.

If would've known real life, would find one critical voices comes currently sitting government. I've lost 10% acquintances this. tread carefully evaluate opinions every day, I'm sorry can't wholeheartedly stand behind condemnation general Swedish strategy.

How sitting government reacted thus far, inactivity, laziness lack leadership, something I'm vocal about, however.

I'm sorry fit folders boxes, that's is. us. want paranoid wait get vaccine, fine me. want life normal soon safely possible. **American triggering intensifies** funny people think people brainwashed normally brainwashed themselves. 2nd lockdown coming. matter time, point. assuming away hardest part - getting number tests.

Leaving aside UAE (a small, rich country), country done tests UK, barely 1 test every 10 people - almost 4 months. think that's lack effort, idea would 10x number tests we've done 4 months matter days ignores major, major logistical hurdle.

Frankly, think need 1 test per household. group test households, address main problem. Maybe can't count high? didn‚Äôt think /s needed since it‚Äôs ridiculous quote stable genius leader, downvotes replies I‚Äôm getting indicates otherwise. referring person replied to, said reason want repeal name. 

I saying get rid Obamacare, Medicare would way better solution.  Can‚Äôt win argument crazy person Yep, look new cases per person region moving forward, see uptick almost (all?) seem uptick bars/restaurants opened (religious things may also included) 

I feel anything indoors needs locked longer. temperature before, **during**, flight.

""We got one - open pod bay doors HAL..."" I‚Äôve got bad news you... Right. book airline requires masks uses HEPA filters rightly so. mean argue, adding. misunderstanding something? Everything I'm hearing/ seeing say [infection rates death rates we've broken records new caes 3 days row now. Also, infection rates may actually [ten times higher what's according CDC. I'm confused treatment since vaccine &amp; [there current treatments beyond treating mild symptoms &amp; common preventative even scarier hospitals running capacity issues - heartbreaking competent leadership could enacting measures first started seeing problems. good news might [antibody soon tide us over. everything I'm seeing says opposite said - states declining; however not, numbers doubt CDC. I'm calling liar, please think that! I'm tired quadruple check ( more) information even then....who knows?

I'm Chicago, [we're move phase Even that, [our positivity increased testing, centered around Chicagoland, think. even everyone walking around maskless. - - like nothing happened, even though we're surrounded states massive COVID spikes. I'm sure we're fine. like anyone town comes here... know millennials don‚Äôt know millennials love criticize millennials.  tested poor first. Almost 47k now. Respect needs earned article great chart show clearly increased testing reason increased cases. Yes live Miami. mentioned, many places getting around ‚Äúbar‚Äù definition selling food. Wait, anyone actually remember that? one? Self serving insular commitment world would protests cause current spike? dead US fine. Everywhere far


.... hope Trudeau keeps border closed long time. Why? genuinely don‚Äôt understand going mind this. Help! I'm UK know we've 5g thing (and David Icke) can't beat America conspiracy theories. would good laugh, except many people actually believe them.  Sounds like flu. 

My ex-wife got time could look other. way could get bed bathroom hands knees, standing walking simply question. even aware ex leaving bed, although must done. No. It‚Äôs unfortunately headed though. October early. Trump hold back let people feel comfortable going polls. I‚Äôm north end, may chance canoe :) Agreed. ü§£ live CA Hispanic folks wear mask host gatherings weekend. short, think people making bad choices irregardless racial background. weren‚Äôt intimidated president. They‚Äôve leading fucking parade. knew would get bad. practicing magical thinking god didn‚Äôt answer prayers. insanity driven media influence leftist politicians across world.

I like one, left wing liberals!! Like Iranian government example... Brazil? racist point protests likely largely contributed this? wEaRInG MaSKs can't edit titles. God dumbass. think already producing now. one cares computer salesman thinks. scientists CDC government officials already. Pretty sure offered anyone voluntarily leaves company 10 years non-rev less people canada california voted comment still here. virtually impossible room people come contact virus. Especially see much increased transmission occurring. 

I 100% believe see many headlines like coming weeks Funny think Biden worth fuck. Trump Biden? I'm sick bullshit candidates choose every election. I'm voting time. Like fucking matters anymore. know NJ added almost 2k deaths yesterday count tested. death rate dropping almost every place world. Today dropped 1% worldometer. UK put study Oxford today 4 times less likely die hospitalized April. 

Please stop conspiracy theories. general, don‚Äôt really way deal viruses all. manage symptoms wait bodies fight them. worry hornets still around multiple sightings recently Washington BC! Hopefully won‚Äôt skyrocket; remdesivir drugs helping! there's something Cold War generation convinced mandates erode liberty.

That ‚Äúsomething‚Äù facing Communist Empire Eastern Europe Russia oppressed freedom. 

Cold War generation id worried US going I‚Äôm 29 look 43 yeah makes sense lol don‚Äôt stop poking noses others‚Äô business? Contact tracing alleges private gatherings home, protests contributing significantly spikes.   I'm suggesting know vaccine safe, believe making one since 2013 gone numerous trials. Experts often tell people things really like hear, meaning ought things they'd prefer do. One obvious way problem pretend experts experts, lot people that's preferred solution. 

This becoming thing least 25 years now; parents bringing children way brought - distrust everything said expert contradicts would prefer believe.

The paradigm MMR autism. One dishonest, vicious, greedy arsehole saw opportunity make unfeasibly wealthy lying 'experiment' 'results' since 1997 doctors developed world watching measles turn something almost gone way polio disease kills hundreds every year. 

Because people believe experts, matter often present data, vaccinate children.

Think people vaccinate covid-19 think government conspiracy? least, left-wing conspiracy? Already got champ, keep condescending piece absolute shit part problem though. must feel great sitting high horse  Wat? Border walls work ways. fair entire country immune covid next mutation lol Actually, like 180 million. vaccine likely need two doses. funny feels like Europe kind getting passed starting relax. People obsessing coronavirus constantly like weeks ago. yet globally probably many cases ever been. There's going anyone left laugh 100 years. ya think Corona crisis bad, wait till climate change gets really bad Republicans don‚Äôt care. care stocks. Op trying push agenda Strange choice words. would like calling 9/11 embarrassing. is, all, self-imposed mega 9/11. ""Shocking,"" ""tragic"" ""criminal"" seem suitable me. ""Embarassing"" picking wrong wine table snobs. little serious that. sovereign nation Chop least. Arizona 3,428

THOSE ROOKIE NUMBERS! LETS THIS! CANT LET STATES BEAT SCORE LETS GO! flyover country lol, you‚Äôre idiot  Washington ""mandated"" masks starting today. wearing one indoors misdemeanor, even Governor Inslee said want ""enforced"".

He knows eastern Washington would revolt. There's already sheriff outright telling people disobey order. There‚Äôs literally way tri state travel law enforced Classic Streisand Effect. senate. use represent heinous war crimes, never prosecuted US ""won."" Another data point argument US empire biggest international bully ever foisted upon humanity.  no, case meant positive testing happens leader actively politicizes scientific findings militarize uneducated voting base agianst political opponents cost. voting base mind devoted toxic, narcissistic freedom culture happily trample health personal liberties name freedom minorly inconvenienced. truly shameful country become... also good point Certain places definitely should, necessary states things properly.

For example, Illinois reported 900 new cases, alot, consider Chicago, really bad number. that's locked early, locked properly slowly reopened. still wont back normal quite while. 

Comparatively, Florida 10x amount cases, making plans change anything they're doing, probably lock down. won't.   Well get coronavirus bad enough take right ride permanently.  Honestly, Beijing resident, dozen cases day still worries me.

The CDC says there's two-week ""clean-up"" period left, hopefully two weeks zero cases Beijing.  see folks wearing masks? continuing go church? headed bars friends?

Trust me, they'll send kids. first comment made jump animals humans wet market. clearly changed tune pointed said wrong. way twist meaning wet market humans spread other.

Nobody making respond. can't deal consequences making public statements, make them.

Do steroids give mood swings? Wear masks folks!

It really seem hard. Every country planet seemed figure out. dad's whole side family. one aunt quit job told wear mask. Full scale outbreak? No. hell cases reporting? would bet left pinky it. Russia, really. Still got family latter, pneumonia deaths roof. seeing updates? CDC still showing 40k. didn‚Äôt read links posted, you? Anyone else tired comments deleted reason here?  bottle feed kids MTN dew got bidet last month. love it. Good thing murder hornets happened shitmustard. doctor right! buying it. seeing updates? CDC still showing 40k. Average age new cases younger. Treatment improved. Or, likeliest theory every pessimist (which majority people are) believe, deaths lagging itll take 2 weeks deaths catch new cases. second wave actually materializes New York. [No yet. someone works hotels, *definitely* this.

Hypervibe forced respond every one chargebacks, individually, try keep money, hope credit card company agrees refund you. Well plagiarized before, confused Iraq Iran, forgot live stream, forgot declaration independence, said 120 million people died covid 19. saw video groping, kissing whispering young girls ears. he's pedo understand basic social norm kissing, nuzzling whispering girls ears creepy. really want someone understand fundamental social norms president? know, deeply concerning me. better job social distancing staying indoors, many instances transmission. Technically masks necessary can't social distance, people tested probably better position success China have? virus contained China! idiots taking stand wearing mask deserve it, zero sympathy. hope painful them. little late, buddy. shut shitt down. Stop gambling life. dont understand making decisions based vulnerable 0.007% population. reacted event history life. 328mm people US. 2.47mm cases, 126k deaths. ridiculous. first phase, another trial planned October, involving 6,000 people.

Sounds like phase 1 can't breathe layer fabric, coronavirus almost certainly going kill That's total first year deaths h1n1 mostly deaths young people. amount fucks people gave seems pretty... Small, comparison. ok watch forever net. Hi again! Trump never admit bad.  is. room 6200. reporter one got it.  Without Fitbit, surely would gained weight. 'rona could easily get 10k steps done walking around day work without much thought. I'm home, could easily day 1k less steps. Fitbit forced accountable meeting 10k goal taking walks daily.

That eating healthier - less processed foods - good thing me.  everyone agreed science

I've saying since beginning. Need put bullshit aside unite virus. scratch 2020 hopefully first part 21 wearing masks many people asymptomatic. Best remedy lead example. people financially responsible enough credit, already screwed badly. instance, brother law can‚Äôt even hold regular bank account anymore, gone negative  let go collections ignored it. Everyone going get it. death toll already decided. long hospitals aren‚Äôt overburdened, trudge along. That's essentially stage/phase 3 is. test safety throughout (even vaccine complete use), phase 3 mainly seeing effective big dose 

Apparently affordable Americans well? Another redditor told I'm sure got  many people actually dying though? Anyone got statistic? people know getting literally losing sense smell/taste come fever &amp; recover. agree it‚Äôs dangerous risk, anyone stat actual death toll ICU admission? I‚Äôve seen hospital decently packed next live nothing drastic April/may. others. Open eyes bro. Everything MSM
tells people everything ‚Äúthey‚Äù
Push masses throats pure heaping bullshit. 

Now different ? 

Frost protect it‚Äôs protect others form you! They‚Äôre shaming people lol. Personally wouldn‚Äôt disrespect wearing one. 

Maybe turtleneck shemagh get store .. that‚Äôs I‚Äôm doing. 

Personally believe face masks kind ritual. mindF. wear mask, safe, happen sick know it, may prevent someone getting sick may wear mask even care. still kill you. Ummmmm k ¬†""others¬†even said cakes sole reason Costco membership.""

I mean...

That seems like pretty expensive way get affordable cake gotta love many people bring shit storm onto themselves, try play victim. 

I sincerely hope translates tips barista Karen gets ***nothing***. tried publicly shame innocent employee younger person right thing public. deserves humiliation she‚Äôs brought upon Hey legit heard 60+ year old woman works bar yesterday talking dude saying never worn mask COPD Asthma hard breathe.

I really wanted tell itd lot harder breathe ventilator, job probably appreciate that. Truly. going watching see done responsibly? not. Check facts Florida Man trusts people who've making bad decisions make good decisions. yep, described better political? Like seriously? Like, wow! wow! replying one. used think COVID hit south hard summer due temperature humidity (as suggested early studies) initial superspreading cases (Albany/New Orleans) contained. Clearly, wrong. bound happen many unknowns new disease. think everyone could use little dose humility comes this, including myself. Weird analogy demonstrate ‚Äúshattering.‚Äù It‚Äôs like mad cause used getting things entitlement, they‚Äôre offended might get corona made wear mask. 36 year old brother keeps hinging back forth hoax people first talking shutdown could 8 week process.

2 weeks prepare, 6 weeks complete lock medical personnel public services people allowed property unless seeking medical aid, everyone could go back normal. 

Everyone would funny story locked month half orgy/party participated afterward, could move on. 

Instead declared like 60% jobs ""essential"" half-assed partial shutdown months end. fact aren‚Äôt growing fast anymore means death rate objectively dropped. 

There going delay cases deaths spiking cases.  Getting tested happens long time body finally shuts result Corona. Assume something like 2 week lag. literally doesn‚Äôt matter. 

I went multiple stores last week signs door saying face covering required 50% people every store weren‚Äôt wearing them.

Fuck assholes wearing masks.
Fuck ass holes make spread conspiracy theories wear masks.
No one probably read needed rant. test find. Shocker. happening along. get 51K from? Everywhere says 40K.

[link CDC. 2500 deaths though estimate people. comments daughters school page talking way keeping kid home distance learning much work them. No....who would guessed????????????? Perhaps time listen science quit kissing Trump's ass. look China. Look China's neighbors, Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, etc. similar deaths per capita China, even densely populated.

East Asian countries handled better almost anyone else. interesting. Thanks thought stopped testing cases would go down? Actually yesterday supposed whatever, every day record breaker next couple weeks almost like going massive protests gonna consequences...well intentioned not. Yes, I'm sure information sharing valuable. Tell ""crayons"". Yeah call AI short. concept around since least 50‚Äôs. complete utter failure U.S. leadership. like anyone surprised. think saw coming. sad, still say it. many people running around rugged individuals sense civic responsibility. Beaver County PA planning fireworks. seems wise. Offer something everyone cancelled get 100,000 people lined parking lots valley. go swimmingly. medical system overwhelmed? not, good. Herd immunity come! I'm saddened read bad things you. sounds horrible. makes realise thousands tens thousands people sector activity profoundly impacted pandemic.

My best wishes keep telling there's absolutely reason pull through. hopes prayers wont get shit Thailand. domestic transmission month - every Thai person returning abroad bring homecoming gift covid-19 there's mandatory quarantine anyways. government completely OCD virus, fine me. tourist economy running fumes though. Probably best time everyone picking it. think that's reason disprove findings, ; would disapprove DNA findings then. üëãüèº Hi! Also Houston! That‚Äôll collateral though, bad sounds. alternative generation school kids completely fucked. World govts sacrifice extra deaths order get kids back school, Mark words. Yeah shit.

Bye üëã True. Also true appear insomnia. no, wont dont make decisions ""it may save 33k"" may absolutely nothing thats big number theres 330mm people 40k die every single day. dont make life style choices minuscule sub section population. EVERY ONE risk get flu. one wearing mask cause flu. isnt even infecting many 9-45 million per year flu infections majority passed within days. 2.47mm cases covid majority covid cases asymptomatic mild, 10% cases end hospitilization 5% mortality grand majority severe cases elderly already risk health patients. way threat normal healthy person. mask going save obese 70 year old diabetes. wind change direction person going die year. Keep allowing freedoms stripped waiting cure virus years out. Stop watching news use brain, math risk assessment. food delivered custody exchange 3+ parties breaking precious guidelines getting you, promise isnt big problem media pushing think things would shut down. ‚ÄúJust focus good‚Äù Hahaha OK Karen won‚Äôt happen. Schools reopen otherwise whole generation kids fucked. Yes, it‚Äôll mean deaths Covid, that‚Äôs risk every country take. much clear, americans would rather (other people) covid 19 wear face masks. college person number cases still worrisome want say medical professionals done lot get situation control short amount time.

When Xinfadi market outbreak started government planned screen thousands residents area COVID-19. tests done nearby communities hospitals prevent infection. emergent situation government wasn‚Äôt prepared AC-equipped mobile test stations like South Korea. Instead nurses complete hundreds tests every day outdoors hot summer weather. news almost every day nurse getting heatstroke AC equipped rest stations set up.

 nothing respect Beijinger. That's insane. Pence says ""We doibg great job"". Government blatantly lie ?

SURGE Per article: Oxford‚Äôs vaccine, called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, developed together pharmaceuticals group AstraZeneca.... Yes does. spins. Picks chooses. Intentionally distorts. I‚Äôm young, healthy, without underlying physical health concerns, even lungs fucked still dealing aftermath virus caught February. overcounted? newer tests include antibody tests numbers skewed. Unless they've separated data? People also love throw time manufacture this... already done exact moment. manufacturing testing. Arizona hospitals beginning advocate triage. depending unhealthy, old , likely live depend wither get care not. want reality hospitals country? probably watched YouTube video going around featuring ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù many memes going around. watched Fox ‚ÄúNews‚Äù. 

What bothers reports could avoided. virus could used unite country, bring us together one purpose, protect elderly vulnerable. Instead it‚Äôs politicized help divide country. 

Like saying goes, it‚Äôs easier fool someone convince someone they‚Äôve fooled... Plus could blow stuff up. SARS vaccine, candidates didn‚Äôt fail. never got clinical trials first place.

[Just one many SARS vaccine candidates bunch differen mayors Southern Yeah seen DRIVERS/on roads? People give damn others. Foxnews (specifically hanity):

""This hoax"" later ""I never said hoax"". 

Foxnews like feeding brain paint chips mean, rural areas largely unaffected. hand maybe problems already maxed stay same? IDK chronic health issues well try believe usually worry like getting worse/fucked. give idea strict is, friend mine traveling car four colleagues, wearing mask 4 guys not, got pulled police random check 4 guys one fined 400‚Ç¨ wearing mask inside car. agree blame protests well churches, casinos, bars restaurants?

No. one outdoors masks. I'm mathematician, think know lot you.

You edited earlier comment indicate outdoor spread 10x less likely, wonderful thing add matches statistics example (15% inside vs 1% outside, yet outside spread). 

By reasoning sources, protests spread virus more. QED. Good day, sir. Spain dude, glad pulled too. join hands 

I know meant symbolic*k*ly comparison makes sense either. (Credit ""Oddthinking"" made point originally response article)

Wouldn't relevant compare ""loss due lockdown"" ""loss without lockdown"" one questioning viability locking down.
(They estimates) I'm guessing $200 ‚Äì they'll get health insurance cover pay $20 pocket. Something like  Take outdoor dining. matter? 

i feel like percent positive high regardless someone CDC's side back march try keep people wasting masks medical professionals needed, *ton* **new** evidence since regular cloth masks help lot specifically Covid-19. Anyone going back citing old articles probably different agenda point. Thank judge. absurd. I'd like make point. since mandatory wear mask allowed go work sick. denied ability provide care family cause I'm sick?

Follow up: ""no probably seasonal alergies."" ""No wont get tested"" ""why? like non mask wearers, 'you cant tell body.'"" Absolutely agree. UW really saved asses this. checklist? objective criteria? protect doctors nurses decisions? unprepared US? made germany soon saw Italy triage. Thank god use now.. It‚Äôs both.

Then spread cities, country, third world. see millions upon millions people internet access, looks like IRL, scary.

Some folks excited Elon's Starlink global internet. I'm kind worried. give tool people - know use it, little education.

And surprised become useful tools authoritarians? Idk...I hate timeline. deaths low....right now. cases hospitalized (if necessary) 2 weeks....deaths 2 weeks behind that. 

testing backlog, yes, actual case count tests done today would theoretically even greater 1600 theoretical week ago. 

SC danger one seems care Soon? People already telling now. Epic. proven sources long lasting lung damages never go away?

Also people know forever?

Also people know outliers people get healthy problemo?  symptoms, fever, period weird kind dizziness. laying suddenly feel like pass out.

How attempt coddle trump actually benefited us?

We never know guess still. tiptoeing starting wear me. really hoping support science criticize anti-mask people heard first sentence. needs consider ""flooding system testing""**

In addition, parents work, equipped teaching worse kids poverty dont even remote learning options. say nothing lack socialization young kids occur staying home.

What's causing spike? things pretty strict masks required / things still running reduced capacity? *You're loose cannon, professor!* headline, .. ,, ...  Japan shutdowns.

Excellent satire Well New York cannot ask someone went protest. course cases linked it. truly shame basic public health measures politicized. Like Cuomo said: ""It never politics. always science.""

People get reminder coming months. Nobody else ever needed go hospital anything else corona Calling bullshit this. guess, hard numbers even know build immunity virus. one articles idiots see say fuck it, over. scoop Erika Lautenbach corrupt, apparently also information undergoing sex change. must sort Danish super detective. able watch moody TV drama, sounds great. Interestingly, seems protests caused much spread.

Actually, that's true. claims ""net stay-at-home behavior increased following protest onset,"" means protests drove enough people cower homes large crowds increase net rate infections.

In words, protests happened, would even *less* coronavirus cases. reason spikes occur areas people afraid protesters canceled impact. 

However, spikes mean would less cases protests occur. believe otherwise, forced concede social distancing unnecessary. think year great American tradition thinking ""I got mine, fuck you.""

""I got toilet paper/hand sanitizer/meat, fuck you, quicker.""

""I got haircut, fuck stylist frightened might bring covid back immuno compromised mother.""

""I got health, care yours? worry health!"" (Ignoring fact heath much impacts health)

I've problems vaccine *works*, leave mark me, require put list, leaves lasting damage body.

(/s course) Oh, okay, realize that!  
Thank you, I'll change comment. really understand rilled asked wear mask, bloody bunch pussies.  idea - I‚Äôm dr don‚Äôt want make claims. heard may issues blood clotting stuff usual symptoms aren‚Äôt present, idk. 

The thing see bunch people acting like options are: symptoms, hospitalized death. good friend mine got February, first case recorded state. Didn‚Äôt go hospital, went primary care doc tested negative flu- never got covid test. He‚Äôs issues since went get antibody test. test came positive, tested lung capacity chest X-ray. Severe lung scarring 40% reduced lung capacity. 

He‚Äôs 26, non smoker, overweight exercised fairly regularly. young people aren‚Äôt ones overwhelmingly getting hospitalized dying doesn‚Äôt mean immune severe complications ""We made remarkable progress!"", said Pence. Can't say I'm surprised, tbh. Testing state weird now. bars area posted messages FB saying considering restaurant order kinda food drink much want. side stepping alcohol ban. Young people also bulk who's back work restaurants, bars, grocery stores, exposed people ages coming without wearing masks. ""We tested positive, negative way, positive negative!"", said Trump. realized whats causing this.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Someone please explain difference keeping genitals covered public vs keeping mouth nose covered public? They‚Äôre orifices secrete things, spread disease, yet one perfectly accepted everyone carrying pickets protesting over. Maybe comparison lame, let‚Äôs go shirt shoes service. Nobody hollering ‚Äúoh right!!‚Äù that?? wearing shoes shirt manners, covering nose mouth literally save lives. Possibly millions lives long run. 
Humanity horrifying. see mean, whole I'm angry employers employees. power keep things open versus shutting down. I'm angry fact rally happened all, secret service agents reporters assigned cover fallen ill. Could declined assignment? think would presumptuous me, random internet person, assume could that. (I think people voluntarily bought tickets even brought babies idiotic.) I'm angry bad policy results willful loss life rather specific individuals trying jobs. I'm angry bars kept open long are, service industry employees trying make living this. teachers dealing schools reopen fall. going mad specific teacher less perfect decision overall put position? on. ""We tested positive, negative way, positive negative!"", said Trump. absolute zero percent chance another lockdown happens. Better masks this. assortment cheapest Ebay ones none ones do. Makes sense. I've gotten mild flus kids tested positive never want got tested. I'm pretty sure five us one bad enough get tested. definitely offers safety creates new antibodies come contact democratic countries forcibly test people. also forcibly isolate them. problem strategy goals US. Nobody outlined ‚Äúthis plan, get level spread get level do‚Äù.

Instead people still don‚Äôt understand reason lockdowns. Flatten curve? Eliminate virus? Adapt ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù whatever means? quarter population laid them...I see people would pissed. lockdowns lifted, states clear nothing really done...no rapid testing. contact tracing. lot people sorta feel like wasted time wasted jobs.

And since foreseeable strategy, end this, large politicians galavanting around rallies little cutesy ceremonies (seriously, look White House official Facebook page), see lot people want get together friends families. Lol rules don‚Äôt sound strict. work Bellagio blessed low seniority yet scheduled Absolutely. Austria, 40 percent ICU patients died April. already around 20. mean, far along, think least 100 million cases probably First world problems ?  said, knowledge US politics poor opinion really. see someone horrific job leading. Whatever policies, LEAD. Set good example, show people good, responsible member society, statesman respected world stage. that's freedom means morally bankrupt country. ‚Äé

This comment look like social distancing Mobile look really weird PC complete fiction. cannot catch cold cold retain virus become infected get cold. even close. Spanish flu high death rate modern sense health care. end stuck covid seasonal illness likely. Viruses mutate LESS lethal forms rarely mutate deadly. It‚Äôs counter productive. find gum mints incredibly helpful regard. Lifehack! ;) still astronomically higher flu 30. suffer chronic pain. 
Rsd/ crps 

And copd 

I'll screwed *ATF would like know location. Say last goodbyes dog now.* ""U can't think could've possibly led this. probably Trump's fault""

-mainstream media eyes matter overall population. Florida tons old people. Right one thing Florida done kind ok keeping virus nursing homes, state many bound fuckups every time happens people die. 

When comes measures health Florida higher obesity rate risk factor. probably less prepared healthcare system well. city announced asymptomatic people longer get tested. Probably good move considering can‚Äôt keep us demand right we‚Äôre already 20% positive asymptomatic testing can‚Äôt imagine number week people really feel like facts liberal conspiracy. I'm kinda her, I'm vaccine available currently one that's rushed 6 months vs normal 5ish years testing? thanks Im not. shouldnt opened knows it. fucked up. Angela Merkel WWE Hall Fame? Oh it‚Äôs shit storm already. certain group people lost minds. Pro-COVID19 side hates CDC disregard data except this. lets say COVID mortality rates even lower thought vastly underestimating rate infected. dude, close bars, leave things open, people wearing masks, give fucking fine. FloridaCOVIDaction.com


It‚Äôs incredible highlights reason differences DOH numbers hers. also recently add new color key denote ‚Äúdeleted DOH‚Äù depressing. White House petitions website.

Just social distancing comment sir sure. cautiously pessimistic. 

I‚Äôve never heard large scale vaccines primarily relied T-cells. Doesn‚Äôt form immunity also offer safety symptoms? advice you, sorry. one kind position. cruelty, torture. can't believe people still defending him. one treating hapless grocery store employees like this, ESPECIALLY TJ‚Äôs employees. They‚Äôre without fail nicest people I‚Äôve ever met. need thesaurus It‚Äôs standard practice decades wear mask cold flu avoid spreading it. Also important note, population density Japan basically taking everyone west Winnipeg putting Vancouver Island. Japan many things better. literally to.  It‚Äôs also things applicable, like high speed rail etc. side, three Canadas extra Quebec people living Newfoundland+Labrador. Isnt border closed? I'm forced travel NYC work get fired without severance...it's great.  Nope. Sorry groups thousands protesters proven negate debuffs due united virtue signal buff. really read patch notes.  FloridaWoman mask killing people literally Yeah that's fucked up. really hate people sometimes... Like current times Lmao forecasts measures taken. Fuck. Can't wait vote out. 
Not matters slightest think me, losing business, stuck home 3+ months, losing grandmother spent 2.5 months without anyone able visit nursing home, eating much savings, living someone high risk group two 70 year old parents staring fact absolute morons facing rampant pandemic probably next 8 months could kill 3 people love almost time... Yeah, I'm going people get shitty lives since 3000 BC. takeaway here?? fucking insane people got 1200 dollars this. even cover month's rent parts country let alone others costs living. quit job reasons hit left unable get unemployment, finding really tough find decent work climate things get lot worse country. Complete failure administration exactly expect. Yeah reopening terrible It‚Äôs that. 6 months stand nationwide contact tracing team arm rapid test kits. ( hint: could used already existing census teams this). 6 months increase supply face masks come together country ensure everyone wore them.  6 months come coherent national strategy execute it. Instead let everyone whatever wanted local level pass buck result places nothing getting hit hard. don‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs protesters minnesota steady since Memorial Day. Abbott also made city governments can‚Äôt enforce new lock downs. unless declares whole state burn.

Sitting Austin way things going won‚Äôt able leave house much 2021. Honestly, think needs cooperative thing states. case spikes places better yet outright avoid them. California good lockdown early also starting spike. solution locking down. Unfortunately think lockdowns happen wave casualties comes Trump choice it. gonna happen. question minimal numbers already 130k toll, wait toll increase so. couldn‚Äôt hear anything since head ass guarentee cause blm protests too! mean, still kick customer out. good lad stay home November. offence, aunt idiot.

I mean, we're judging whole world based 3 comments plucked single sub random, I'd say could easily justify literally beliefs wanted. man lifetime civil servant serves pleasure president. He's done far good tenure he's presidents actually make use advice he's able president hears wants. power limited basically advisory capacity one choose battles.

Maybe wrong? Absolutely, also know downside kids poverty, kids working parents etc. likely never catch up, never able get poverty. fair thats truth. 

So do? friends (a couple) doctors San Francisco leave house except go work.  say awful insist take really seriously.  I'd imagine many similar anecdotal story now.  Friends gotten sick say thing.

And everyone privilege working home, sorry say. Outside feel social distancing enough wear one, seldom leave house fuck virus....

You realize real life like video game? virus programmed magically disappear 6 feet. Social distancing helps, enough without extra safety nets. Use mask. God damn embarrassing watch one episode Floribama Shore get idea people Florida mean, logically manners makes sense does... does. 

Stay safe, hope Taiwan get complacent. Ya'll done amazing job far. Meanwhile Europe trying everything keep thing control. hope God US open travel. nightmare keeping covid away spreading America like joke population. Brazil. Holly shit.

Thank you. everyone wouldn‚Äôt problem. doesn‚Äôt get gold star all. recklessly botched response reason mess. shitty. felt super sick. felt like anything without feeling like I'd pass moment. think idea caused much axiety struggling virus.

In April deemed basically doomsday virus. much better outlook optimistic people catching Florida bad right now. would surprised poor looks like China. Poor US means car. Poor China means buying bottle liquid soap big purchase.

The rich rich, majority people China.  reopened it. fly.. think would better Chinese treatment data all?

I regard data unreliable, unfortunate. Oxford vaccine good fall? Well see headline tomorrow Unless disease, recovered, tested positive neutralizing antibodies, risk. think height hubris. actually legitimate concern w.r.t. DIY masks though doesn‚Äôt need gain traction. OP hasn‚Äôt paying attention, story posted sub today...it‚Äôs currently front page crying loud zero chance extend unemployment bonus, considering something like 10% mortgages currently 30 days late. 

Unless plan actually war street. need learn difference ifr cfr. one saying 5% figure two things mean. central florida closer 90% wearing masks much sports fan took longer I'm willing admit realize MLB means thought OP simply misspelled BLM. CDC's best estimate currently .26%. It‚Äôs mix mentioned people unwilling risk health health around refusing work. Almost certain open. international guests unlikely families young children would want risk everyone getting sick.

The guests would locals, I'm sure that's enough traffic spending justify expense running park. Yay! ü§ó Ooh man. get it, daddy issues. Get yourself. Wasn‚Äôt idiot gloating tv weeks back well handling pandemic? things every day üëç. Doesn‚Äôt mean world ending Long Island, masks required indoors restaurant/bar? Also, rules capacity levels? Thanks! don‚Äôt Trump administration I‚Äôm sure cares lot them.

Plus I‚Äôm sure large financial incentive first vaccine Yep. work community college entire staff working home. handful employees custodial staff allowed campus. They‚Äôve locked rest us buildings. Please feel free. going let delete want. Fauci. man. double edged sword. Duh. say it‚Äôs getting plenty traction, I‚Äôm guessing mods don‚Äôt allow titles differ headline articles...it‚Äôs rare occasion actually see point agree Sadly wearing mask USA somehow political done 4 months? feel many people whining wear mask would accidentally get trapped plastic grocery bag. end day:

- People want see kids.
- People want run mouths.
- People want eat food.
- People want drink booze.

All happen virtually. could even experiment early maybe game night wifey another couple. See works doesn't.

Good luck! Watch old movie called 'Dave'. practically recited plot. 

( humorous movie &amp; well done.) Same, disheartening see people know HIGH RISK CATEGORY DUE AGE go vacations regularly drive border go open swimming pool.

Like, closures fun game seeing get away with. ***\*\*\*\* you, United AA!!!!!!!!!!!!!*** literally connected entire world internet. make agreement small group friends socially distant visit safely. worth bartenders servers lives. New Jersey dumped probable cases... Isnt good thing? People looking work. Impossible flying certain cities. Never flying American again. Fuck that. usually fly Alaska, Hawaiian United every often would fly American. suck anyway. HEAR 50k?! MIL also like that. Fortunately lives 900 miles away seen years. Things would get pretty wild ever got it, I'm fine status quo. probably figured event canceled would get money back. Even take lag account, death rate known cases half back peak days mid April. work hospital coworker took mask end day today ask ‚Äúall‚Äù bars closed, proceeded call girlfriend ask wanted go hookah bar midtown.

SO many people here‚Äôs attitude masks social distancing gone. sickens afraid go work HOSPITAL end interacting passing coworkers without masks. Interesting. Inflection point cases 3rd May. Inflection Deaths 17th May. deaths took lot longer rise steeply, another month fact. US figures. Death inflection point basically today tomorrow? investigation starting anti-mask, anti-science trends, prosecuted it? think so. Reality already exhausting enough, honestly. know energy doubt literally every authority figure ever. charge entire ~~virus response~~ country.

FTFY I'm glad flying Delta, AA.......(unless Delta follows suit) virus particles way small masks even effective

The point limit droplet dispersal, filter individual viruses. post office know send them? Isn‚Äôt anti trump people wear masks?

Edit: /s ffs  much fun. |: 

I COVID test scheduled Sunday. We‚Äôll see case gets added numbers, fingers crossed it‚Äôs nothing. D: I‚Äôm 100% unsurprised 100% disappointed. work retail put indoor seating 2 weeks ago (cafe/bookshop) entire time. feels unsafe require masks except get sit 30 minutes eating, many cases restaurant spread. really isnt though people go bars either socialize escape. Neither home (and agree bars closed) people reddit adults. one said stay inside. Go outside get fresh air. go inside public building mask on. Social distance. hard you? You‚Äôre fun. Let‚Äôs month see America‚Äôs numbers doing. love game.

RemindMe! 1 month ‚Äúprove loser wrong again‚Äù worst issue ""can."" US certainly *can* proper robust testing. trove almost every resource imaginable country certainly *could* used them.

We simply didn't. many ways, that's even worse. Money everything It‚Äôs going disappear. One day, it‚Äôs like miracle, disappear. I'm super pissed teachers arent considered reopening plans. state going reopen, business usual. Ignoring fact cases skyrocketing (way go Arkansas). 

My coworker back napkin math realized almost half coworkers either: old risk, younger immunocompromised, living with/in close contact high risk person. Greece lot American tourists. wouldn‚Äôt surprised American tourists spent European tourists, since you‚Äôre American going Greece, you‚Äôre probably going spend least week. frustrating, ounce prevention worth pound cure emphasized coronavirus. America's response nothing reactive rather prophylactic, costing us boggles brain anyone arrive beach, see think ‚Äòhey wanna go there!‚Äô I‚Äôm pro mask but..

There‚Äôs saying, give essential liberty temporary safety get neither.

Never mind North Korea South Korea social credit system prevent people getting public transport, getting flights, jail time speaking government. even anti mask couldn‚Äôt voice they‚Äôd jailed.

It‚Äôs slippery slope. People sceptical  Ah, there's proper bit it, thanks! use ‚ÄúTrumpanzee‚Äù? It‚Äôs hilarious. üò≠ people deserve pity people like children adults truly little control interactions life.

Did miss part?

I'm strictly referring people sound mind. worked assisted living facility 2 years included secured wing dementia etc patients.

The trivial things older people adamantly stubborn would blow mind I'm talking people full mental capability, they're old bodies otherwise starting give out. They're perfectly capable understanding choices. 

The ones currently cannot given choice. facilities locked visitors anyway, really leaves independent still. ""I know what's causing it, I'm scientist doctor anything like that, think "" Depends perceptions.

When customer only, assumed food kept safe, everything else done bare minimum.

Working national chains, safety standards higher that. Every inch food prep area cleaned every day, dining area cleaned every hour + spot cleaning, new gloves every customer, ect.

Working fine dining restaurant Chef Patron investors, original perception correct. Anything customer actually opportunity put body kept sanitary delivery service disposed of, exceptions. Everything else? Depends bored back house is. customers = clean restaurant, slammed open close = bare minimum, need sleep point. may reaching...but tested central Florida last Friday kept telling wife ridiculously inefficient process was. arrived 830, 15th car line, tested 1030. 

Maybe direction xx amount per hour slow testing? say fuck Internet, fuck Karen USA 58% 400,000,000 still 230,000,000 people. blanket statements don‚Äôt work here. countries majority GDP depends tourism, including heavily America (such many Caribbean islands). Even E.U., lack American tourism financial hit. Still, get virus control agree quarantine ourselves.

Edit: pop US 330,000,000 400.  Disney care gets sick, care money much makes sense. Fellow Georgian here. understanding parents students choice - teachers need prepared teach classroom online come fall.  think he'd done things better:
1) hunger games PPE medical supplies procurement made states bid other, outbid states failed federal agencies seize supplies. supplies ended back open market via Trump's cronies. Trump administration feature defied belief.

2) Would kept pandemic response team place. Perhaps CDC would utterly pathetic appointments well.

3) reduce testing bid look better.

4) refuse wear mask front camera contaminate PPE factories visited.

5) Would articulate conveying info also let experts talk appropriate instead Trump toddler translations medical info. can't fix stupid florida large elderly population to

yup pretty mix can‚Äôt tell serious it‚Äôs sarcasm. number increasing no-mask voter block dies COVID. Slightly dubious sources there. wish people could honest. Happy cake day!! Maybe.

Turn lights off, carry home. Srsly. Stop pulling numbers ass. 

CFR=case fatality rate. Number dead recorded cases, far fewer actual cases.

IFR=Infection Fatality Rate = actual number kills, around .5%

The cases catch tests, lower CFR goes. Sorry that‚Äôs people think. live outside US, see US whole. rant. It‚Äôs justified level frustration. I‚Äôm sorry deal inconsiderate jerks. Muh FreEdoMs!! North County here, seem alright.

Your biggest fears getting beaten ice hockey Canada running Latinos countries dirty work.

No country ever try invade US due logistic mess transportation.

You need army, need coastguard. 
Everything else pummeling poor countries overthrowing unwanted foreign governments. funny sick un health humans poor workers. know 2k years. current set morons cant seem understand that.

health happy workers .

work harder better. Please, someone retail, shown card, simply tell person Trump signed order defunding ‚ÄúObama‚Äôs‚Äù federal ADA last year disability complaints made state state basis, need state provided exemption certificate now. 

Obviously nonsensical card would fun watch heads spin. Let make analogy hopefully understand: 


Your brother leaves home age 18 says ""fuck guys, i'm out!"" never hear again.

Your brother hears started business lots money. comes back home age 30, says ""i've always cared guys! i'm definitely stay! money please?"" 


Apparently i'm supposed think brother asshole? Something waters... I'm wrong kind biologist look links. Hell far know probably right. Plus response decently level headed right amount bull headedness respect that. open knew would take bar buy beer it.  LA reason California spiking.

Checks really point think. find something else must going on. conspiracy theorists change mind like clothes.

The thing consistent something else going on.

Because understand anyone would make decision feel Covid19 warrants measures severe.

That core thing.

The people explain to, jump something else must reason unexplainably disproportional decision.

&amp;#x200B;

""We must explain it""

yes problem haha.

Our news media keeps scaring us covid dangerous nobody believes anymore.

Why try exaggerate danger?

Because show real numbers people even confused taking measures.

Atleast felt way found lethality. 

They exaggerate view can't really justify actually tell people:

 ""look big deal actually. bad way killer virus sold you. young victims kind really rare narrative could anyone really true."" ÁúüÂâ£„Å´ Who‚Äôs laughing now..?! Remember people Texas Florida calling democratic governors stupid?! People going state capitals reopen!!! now?! dare they, start protest something. It‚Äôs governor, Trump never enforced nationwide lockdowns think it‚Äôs questionable whether could even legally wanted to. I‚Äôm Florida even governor kinda stopped caring it‚Äôs mayors county (the level government states cities don‚Äôt know) decide Stocks might go 10% going re-test March lows barring new catalyst. treatments (I'd wager most, open correction) even treat 50,000 year. Depending dose (honestly knows gonna ug mg/kg), scale production going laughable. However, treat sick, death rate plummets, short term goal vaccine? really use mask snowboarding wraps around neck. Pretty easy grab edge pull up/down needed. thats true all, mortality rate higher 30-45, around 3% give take. were, would also seeing spikes major urban centers Northeast upper Midwest places near Chicago, not.  due reopening soon southern states. raise number cases Florida started 2 weeks ago. start today. Huh, maybe making idk protests large, endured long, people nowhere go nothing do. absolutely outgrowth covid lockdowns needs taken account. do. parents assholes.  I'm even American yet I'm embarrassed Everyone throw block party bar-b-que instead. every nation competent spying apparatus already knows. taxpayer right know current regime compromising national security incapacitating military pandemic. anyone think protests (which justified) contributed increase COVID cases? Things going well here. Thank God giving us Donald Trump lead us this


/s  live Massachusetts many finally starting (wrongly think) believe getting past worst this. Nearly everyone wears mask public tries observe social distancing guidelines. Even still we've 8000 people die COVID-19, today lost 50 more.

Observing lax many areas country causes think future dire U.S.A.

As stands, looking data provided individual state websites seeing antiscience attitudes carefree behavior many people across country think we'll fortunate lucky get 328,200 deaths end November virus nationwide.

I fear quite possible experience nearly double horrific death count still people, many people, refusing simple things need collectively keep infection rate down. Yeah federal leadership would helpful..... Fuck that. teacher's LIFE worth daycare parents. heard cook Covid-19 book 500 degrees 23 minutes it‚Äôs best prime rib you‚Äôll ever try. above: isolated incident never implemented government. China's policy pretty much 'social distancing wear mask' event happened late January, Wuhan. restriction imposed accommodation someone Wuhan. soon seen government over-reaction, metal bars used secure door wow 48k cases usa thats insane ""Everyone pointing fingers, gotta tell ya... we're going need fingers."" Nooooooooooo!!!!! I‚Äôve seen lot people mask live they‚Äôre mandatory I‚Äôve seen people line without mask on, today line store told mom we‚Äôre close got social distance, it‚Äôs precaution guy front without mask gave weird look. felt bad actually, nothing personal don‚Äôt mask dude  That's another good one - ""higher higher"" triggered ELO song me. binary scale 1) FOX news 

2) Facebook

3) Evangelicals 

4) Shitty public education 

5) Cultivating sense extreme entitlement without corresponding responsibility Looks like July's event. Lots hospitalized barely breathing kids. *Florida making run New York Ignorance invisible understood, countered. Russia funded antivax movement stop virus leaking back Northeast, South?

Quantity contact places people wear masks. Northeast people wear masks strangers. Make red MAGA they‚Äôll fly shelves rural Alabama. deaths. US given 2 months prepare, learn China, Asia Europe. 

If situation reversed, China would probably like New Zealand. US-based Redditors: Remember group projects school, people would work others would slack off? 

This giant group project needed everyone‚Äôs help pass...but we‚Äôre used excusing dead weight letting people live truth, failed HARD. 

Nature found Achilles heel fucking poked knife. he's looking bright side. Texas oil industry may suffering, Texas healthcare industry get major boost. /s almost home stretch people got fed up. states didn‚Äôt even care. Fauci Trump live two alternate dimensions regards MAGA-Flu anyone else see talk elephant room.  pandemic continues escalate, divide hatred ""maskers"" ""non-maksers"" spiral control see violence break two factions.  like ""black lives matter"" ""all lives matter,"" ""it's flu"" ""it's flu.""  election, Trump wins, mass rioting, looting, destruction streets dwarf seen far year.  hare hoping brighter 2021, good luck that. wait 3 months everyone taken seriously again, people suddenly declare safe go get haircuts. 69% Bill Gates eats babies.
























Veal Veal? stand corrected. Sorry miss labeled wrong oppressive system. Lmao Umfortunately, cases already happened. People realizing wrong dieing. Except that's basically what's happening. feds provided relief funding people laid implemented border restrictions. that's it. social distancing measures, ban gatherings closures business penalties travellers self isolating maters handled provincial governments.

Problems arise extended close contact one+ positive people. keep inhaling virus particles. immune system handles first, however, it‚Äôs like hordes zombies overtaking city. Defenses overwhelmed. point contract illness, become even sicker immune system fight hard subdue threat.

We‚Äôve found super spreader events account for, think, 80% infections. also seen repeated global trend contract super spreader event overall experience worse symptoms higher risk dying. 

At first, immune system able keep killing virus within system. problem arose kept attending super spreader events form reopening rallies. forced system contact virus event. Eventually straw broke camels back became far symptomatic.

   Tracking virus play major role keeping thr virus control.

   Increases number available testing test preforms correlate increase number total cases.

   Increases percentage positive cases daily samples (daily positive cases divided total tests preformed day) indicate virus spreading. 

   Currently, amount testing preform day significantly larger comparison public testing started, went 5,000 tests per day early stages pandemic 100,000 tests per day last days. (No specific dates stated.) 

   percent daily positive confirmed cases per daily tests preformed increasing, upwards 5% tests performed positive. 

   Increase possibility stringent contagious diease prevention measures mandated. states already begun issuing stronger restrictions businessess facilities. (On personal note, live Florida shut bars. Friday.) 

   California support peaceful protesters, utilize contagious disease prevention measures 
promoting social distancing practices protests. It‚Äôs one awhile... assume hospitalization rate something like 15%

Luckily, far nowhere near number. HALF sheets? December/January though. That‚Äôs thing‚Äîpeople *aren‚Äôt* getting scared‚Äîthat‚Äôs it‚Äôs gotten bad (and going get worse, like *way* worse). Bill Burr. Bill Barr corrupt shithead. I'm arguing anything accuracy report. arguing establishment totalitarian government? Ok. reading same, reports old date (March/April).

Will see person question feels tomorrow, forcing go get tested many...many could infected. like people anxiety always love claim anxiety people.

The world get man. world give shit you. world know exist. lying simply give fuck you.

I mean seriously know many people would this? talking literally millions people work medical field lying what?

What else believe in? Flat earth? Fake moon landing? Atlantis? Lizard people? much conflict city, county, state, federal government right laws kinda optional Odd Africa defacto country test high risk trial vaccines yet world screams BLM... Smh thought article interesting. yes. posted it. Come on, say like bad thing! keeping safe mansion 3rd vacation mansion too? worse gets less matters one individual.

Why (insert helpful slightly inconvenient behavior here) nobody else is? crazy patriotic many Americans go ""respecting flag"" represents soldiers ""died us"" Yet vast majority people can't wear piece cloth ugly faces 20min stores. talk highly sacrifice, can't even this. bare minimum. 
They selfish, privileged entitled.  think they're going close can't announce week postponing opening Disneyland California want tank stock price.

Please please reconsider supporting Health Care along trust government. work. We‚Äôre actually quite well, considering you‚Äôd expect 3 million covid deaths US alone. We‚Äôre 180,000! First sentence false. rest terrible comparison.

Again, I'm disappointed lot things happening right now, nothing FREE China. plenty videos reports prove it. now, understand speak them. want going missing, bud. Thanks BLM! Kyle Karen complain toilet clogging Well sister's boyfriend came positive, got sick tested yesterday list. live house....

""Cassandra Kassandra, priestess Apollo Greek mythology cursed utter true prophecies, never believed. modern usage name employed rhetorical device indicate someone whose accurate prophecies believed."" ORMC ~ 5x many covid patients today week ago. country spiking. skipped reading article even read fucking headline, huh? I've working busy ER day, today busiest day I've ever seen. fucked. going battlefield triage soon, totally fucked. I'm glad political issue people, worst case scenario hospital systems overrun finally shit hitting fan. people acted like gathering public riots protests going spread virus. chickens seem come home roost they? surprising. Lots packed restaurants house parties everywhere. Even shut restaurants, bars, gyms. shut birthday parties, summer bbqs, block parties? Police say they‚Äôll nothing. Let run entire population? don‚Äôt want best solution. vaccine going do?

There going millions heavily armed people actively resisting vaccine. annnddd that's protesting Tens millions tests run testing criteria way broader testing first started. vast majority people fine. Don‚Äôt worry. going home. bullshit make believe planning right now. make mass gatherings deadly pandemic less idiotic selfish?! science told mass gathering sure way spread virus way deny that. Hello fellow Washingtonian! first pandemic human history single person ever studied viruses anyone ever attempted model pandemics spread. impossible prepare!  Unfortunately perfect allegory climate change. Nothing done planet deathbed, far late. Hell, might well already late. low opinion teachers think school daycare parents. soon read anti maskers.. fuck man... 

Happy cake day guess twins  somehow guy won?  USA! USA! USA! Always aiming gold! Way go everyone. Brazil inching behind us we‚Äôll still position First Place July 4! time alive. /s Good job everyone. Showing care political team trusting know best. America sick head going away anytime soon. Really hope people subs people believing millions people. nasal swab last Friday went LabCorp results Tuesday. test took May, results 24 hours. live NYC, absolutely blunt, media got situation New York totally fucking wrong. 99% people wore masks everywhere least two months. stores restaurants closed except pharmacies, grocery stores, liquor stores (go figure), except delivery. people still rare became story people did.

Of course media jumps people wrong thing ignores 99.9% people took extremely seriously. Even friends thought would little lax quarantined completely except go grocery store.

I guess end day people see sensationalized headlines real access what's going here, unless actually know somebody ask them. must create many jobs diligently track quarantine localized outbreaks. somebody take platform? Distribution necessities infected, contact tracing, checking infected. jobs need done people complaining able work. Isn‚Äôt incubation period COVID 14 days? Sounds like reporter caught rally. ne ir three day interesting. increase every single day preeettttyyyyy scary. bright side... herd immunity, right?/s kidding? Go drink Emergen-C juice Ahh, yes, honor system... state people want wear masks use wearing underwear sort weird justification (which, record, fine, wear mask- put pair pants skirt face)..... Please confuse Ol' Billy Redface scumbag Attorney General. Sorry chief. China started US made awful own. China got slammed early reacted appropriately US react learned could happen sudden 120k deaths definitely gonna 200k soon USA USA USA! We‚Äôre always winning! Can‚Äôt help it! anti science administration since conception country oh word??? know that. got membership last week parents born?  source back claim referring Facebook videos uncle shared? Yup here. insane. wonder possible hire Karens harass get money. pandemic fizzling out. Kids get sick kills old ill people. I'm lie bed night worrying kids sneezing other. 

Do research, make mind up. think thats status quo people charge Pretty ironic guy created it....




/s guess that‚Äôs needed days start require masks, closing bars reducing restaurant capacity 100 outside going slow enough. drop going take really long time peak unless 85% population begins wearing masks hanging air conditioned rooms without starting right now. steep drop wanted to. Help understand makes Bill expert though? MD? damn registered nurse came high school tell us it‚Äôs LIKE FLU. Back March, tearing room told whole class gonna die. 120k deaths later looks like right super-individualistic society cannot fathom concept  I‚Äôm impressed thread political stuck facts. really commend amazing moderators adhering rules. jobs really tough, can‚Äôt believe could follow obscure rules. Almost billionaire owned media racebaiting clueless people pointless BLM riots according agenda. 

I guess 450$ billion transfer wealth last corona crash wasn‚Äôt enough them. America rots within. Seasonality could effect deaths too, seen lot info something simple vitamin better outcome patients, although get something get levels immediately. Also age, everyone going back work crowds/protests average age death. Nah there‚Äôs batshit crazy atheists too. It‚Äôs idiocy. 

# Texas Medical Center leaders change tone, say COVID surge He‚Äôs trying collect ideas! Don‚Äôt give them! course not. Yes, brilliant idea: *put condom middle second trimester.*

Absolutely astounding. Someone upvoted guy? would use CFR calculation like this? knew coming. chickens coming home roost lot places bucked early measures. mandate wearing mask, said one fined wearing mask. takes lot power away counties cities mask requirement. That's hilarious think get absolutely shit faced. even clue drunk founding fathers meeting create constitution. well documented.

Of course don't, talking completely ass attempted sound like tough guy.

Guess what, nobody buying we're laughing dumb sound. Fuck room. Listen scientists. ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô co-worker said ‚Äúno one could seen coming!‚Äù April... DeSantis: Covid magically disappear Disneyworld ER sometimes Critical Care doc here- challenge ICUs need people take care ICU patients- specially trained critical care nurses doctors. nursing ratio ‚Äúregular‚Äù/non-ICU patients maybe 1:4, ICU care 1:1 1:2- plus support staff (respiratory therapists, physical therapists, nursing assistants, infection control, critical care pharmacists, etc). need labs drawn constantly (to adjust ventilator settings, watch organ failure, adjust meds), need vitals constantly monitored, high need patients require continuous meds (IV infusions), special skin care/cleaning, LOT documentation. 

Even ventilators space, people care critical patients limiting reagent. Obviously required adjustment beds full there‚Äôs enough staff, maybe could stretch nurses 1:3 going sustainable long all. Hospitals often already operating near capacity hard find skilled nurses doctors keep patient load like that. also means patients can‚Äôt kind care need. trust me, don‚Äôt want sedation meds run low tube gets kinked, rectal tube fails one notices several hours you‚Äôre laying shit, pain tube shoved throat don‚Äôt ability ask signal help. Science wonderful things people actually let it. could swore read exact headline yesterday..... Depends district state. Kind odd loop teacher fashion. Like union, Principle HR emailing updating going on? waiting get tested? Seems irresponsible wait long feel infected can't reason someone position reason into

I'm stealing one thank much. 46,000 cases day US slowdown sight. going reach theoretical upper limit infection rate beginning Flu season. Millions could die US speed infection continues rate- even Flu hospitalization rates collapse hospitals. live busy street LA county even though many mask wearers, enough aren‚Äôt worry me. someone tell it‚Äôs important shop need line door TJ Maxx?? WHY?? point is, someone lives south also, see daily neck woods, white people. 

Sorry ruffle feathers man.
 
edit: I'm currently watching bunch rednecks party across road. Georgia. Boston. (Source. ) privilege showing. rest world sucking bad? I'm not. 

I'm realistically remembering outbreak state parents lost shit pulled school.

To point worry whether anyone show fall. constant calls coming already demanding permanent online year.

It big talk dead bodies Facebook obituaries started flowing town. 

Then real fear begins. live WA mask compliace low almost exact population MA.

Our deaths WAY lower yours.

How state high mask compliance 10x many daily deaths one low compliance? 95%? doubt that. Johns Hopkins Hospital estimates every 1 million confirmed cases, 10 million went radar. Bill Gates \*shuffles deck\*... 5G networks Series Li Again, chill blanket statements. American society huge wealth disparities. Americans spend second-highest international tourism, China. It‚Äôs still enormous market many countries idea Americans don‚Äôt leave country flat incorrect. so? Biological sex construct, gender strongly correlates it. semantic claims, they're either objectively true not. Save Mart work Sacramento believe ones town aren‚Äôt enforcing mask law. That‚Äôs lot people everyday could exposed. three people test positive work. Really concerned help take care grandparents. sure go leave survive financially. super fucked.  Doubt it. hard time seeing 1 million deaths 2021 given current trajectory clear fearmongering That's strange live, everyone looks wearing mask. Literally, 99% people MD wear masks. Thanks! new new? Tired winning?! #YOLO Aren‚Äôt children apparently vectors virus? Yep... need give unemployment benefits, least temporarily, providers families. Question science real. That's metric need everything. deny science CANNOT vote.  Schools providing internet school lunches lockdown area low income families. Schools open essential workers anyone working home keeping kids home Reaganism cut education budgets bone. Nowadays anything conflicts worldview, conspiracy make feel bad. Cognitive dissonance way life here. kinds spike wished stock market happening instead corona virus cases. Thankfully Canadian work Visa approved \^_^ , planning moving Montr√©al soon possible! What? really know works. 

Interns absolutely day 1 practicing constant contact real patients ER wards. run decisions attendings senior residents they're absolutely ones physically front lines grunt work interacting patients. Welcome life friend. Nobody cares you. yet everyone demands care them. Wait wait wait..this one day? Yeah protest cases coming play. straight told people, go figure caught it. Won‚Äôt become shortage think countries export rice stockpiling case. it‚Äôs probably temporary supply issue west. Actually no, there's evidence ever happened.

I'm defending company absconding people's ticket money, seems like someone got impatient looking fine print decided wiped contact info internet.

That happen. find link company page, fine print, lower left corner Rock USA Oshka page. I'm going bother looking facebook page facebook: whole thing means contacting company.  see advantage user system #TexasStupid back north summer ##YeetFlorida2020 You‚Äôve got right spirit Houston run ICU beds. collection hospitals ran base ICU beds. convert hospitals capacity. definitely still major problem tho someone tell pumped gas... elderly man took small piece paper wallet told ‚Äúdon‚Äôt find funny viruses come election years‚Äù years written pencil virus per year listed... 

I said ‚Äúno sir, works‚Äù  love people say stuff earnest. started girl telling knew talking medical professional. meant graduated EMT program community college, worked like month quit. Thanks doctor. underrated leader ever!!! /s lol. math. Add top 10 states (all south way!!!!). equals 32,233 new cases. Subtract number total cases 47,341. equals 15,108 new cases remaining 40 states.

The South get hit worse New York. Also Michigan: got bad realized drank days hadn‚Äôt past two weeks. Threw away last (admittedly fairly sparse now) alcohol supply yesterday, I‚Äôm hoping go atleast month sober get head back things.  you. good things. See tomorrow! I‚Äôm gonna sit commend idiots. should‚Äôve stuff before. shutting entirely. That‚Äôs contain shit getting worse way conveniently begin slowly reopen continue life usual. They‚Äôre dragging inevitable what? It‚Äôs totally counter desire keep businesses open running effectively. Question?

How address statements people go: ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs LOT people getting tested now‚Äù. ?

How many tests conducted one day spike? Honestly, he's probably better Trump Biden. man top scientific field would make policy based recommendations experts respective fields. fuck every politician like this?  hundreds people next wearing masks way people going spread COVID? Hold ventilator known diversity! ""Woman shamed Starbucks barista speaks out.""

Lovely. make face masks ears? Preferably ones packed sound-proof cotton.  work state Sacto week first positive agency. unit started 5 days week Wednesday instead wfh. :/  Youtube/Twitch videos streamers actually there. This. Mild asthma, case - absolutely want catch covid. get TX, FL even AZ....

But really understand CA club... :(  that's honestly stranger aliens me. understand aliens coming earth purpose. cannot understand people believe sanitizing, wearing mask, staying public positive healthy way okay. known asymptomatic people could spread it. sure that's lying, want dramatic, sure. Thank sir!

So, basically grtting worse, even increard testing taken account? something done soon? They've turned Death Cult point. Authoritarian single party state.

If know word actually means, China ""totalitarian"" like Soviet Russia / East Germany / North Korea.

Nice try using scary words, though. here. one person's fault, one person's only. love people like woman fall rabbit how...confident ‚Äúinformation‚Äù. It‚Äôs weird. one wearing masks people mask shaming wear one neighborhood Westside LA. It‚Äôs crazy. beginning pandemic thought great job, become lot lax it? Imagine NYs record would actually enough testing happening. statements make sense, think right either.
If accurately diagnosing mental health possible using texts short we'd save lot money. Unfortunately, professionals agree work. Yeah.... I'm gonna call bullshit lawsuit threat. said got deleted. Let's give free cruise they're gone finally get back normal. Actually plenty toilet paper, commercial toilet paper. course not. virus isn‚Äôt racist. Didn‚Äôt hear? Holy shit June over. fuck 2020 Poe's law. Reading thread I‚Äôm seeing lot anger business owners open, people maskless, people gathering beaches.

I wonder there‚Äôs large, rowdy gatherings people extremely close proximity could cause up-swing? ü§îü§î People trust much more. u check Unless going making 50,000 doses day starting last month outbreak far big treat using novel treatments now. see rollin'

Yeah, ""starting to"" title sounds like Trump joke. way testing start young people getting tested. good chance getting infected testing ever done showed hit vulnerable. Especially asymptomatic spread higher viruses. Young person know sick goes work nursing home. sudden everyone around gets sick Seattle Nursing Home situation. 

I read Tampa Bay Times average seniors get COVID start June 150 day 400 day already starting FL! :'( would rather live country allows criticism protest debate China‚Äôs arrest imprisonment surveillance citizens. Eventually deal virus. 

We terrible failure leadership. still would rather China. would probably end jail posting thoughts.

Read her: sleep unknowingly secret government agents come home plant pieces said nanotech masks clothes. Understandable. 

I‚Äôm working one that‚Äôs licensed vaccine process modified organism spitting COVID proteins instead typical antigens, it‚Äôs ingredients components already approved. I‚Äôd willing bet lot ones process similar. GNU Terry Pratchett CoCo County talking delaying next phase, supposed begin July 1. We‚Äôve seen 40% increase hospitalizations last 7-days. I‚Äôm supposed go back work July 1st don‚Äôt see happening. quite paradox, goes bad worse people double craziness. 

Maybe arrive hospital beds finally figure really depends whether healthcare workers got sick not. northern Italy March disaster happened sick people flooded hospitals infected healthcare workers someone found Covid. Many workers sick, home, worse hospitals died. 
You can‚Äôt handle traffic 30% workforce infected. Tough find enough substitutes best times. I‚Äôve subbing 2 years, probably won‚Äôt go back year. Good health, 59yo, I‚Äôd rather risk it. Next week definitely interesting. Montgomery - North Houston  POTUS, Fauchi would run task force day one would medical people it, politicians bureaucrats. RNC August. 50k, non-mask -wearing, think COVID hoax, even though ticket liability waiver, Trump loving morons add exponential spread. delaying opening almost everything, discouraging people anything requiring masks plan. lack plan. course. Many us working pandemic. People looking work lost jobs recieving unemployment. look internet home. places opening cant fill positions Copy pasted yesterday next data point. Rate increase still increasing scarily. 


This 7-day rolling average US new cases. Right column daily difference. Typically stops increasing half way peak bottom. really looking scary, know high peaks, going go time, minimum rolling average would \~51000 day increase starts dropping today keeps following predictable pattern.

He definitely to, way President act like going ""go away"" hold ego-stroking rallies. US still giant fucking military, economic clout, dollar reserve currency, enough nukes glass planet 100x over. changes, going major player. US little diplomatic weight leverage anything meaningful while. 

Obama repaired nearly decade US unilateral diplomacy, Trump ""hold diet coke"" raging bull upend post- WW2 liberal order. doubt world forgiving post Trump. blame them: whiplash leaves us little credibility. Maybe people want people dieing alarming rate? Close friend owns bar. barely making first lock down. anything everything make ends meet. definitely make time. Landlord business wants money, mortgage company wants money. vehicles sold. feel bad business built past 20 years lost. good things come wait...patiently. kept shut would‚Äôve downward trend instead upward fear preaching one people believe serious happens them. *And even then*, might one ""select"" portion tries blame illness even test positive. kind admire taking time try educate. US citizen run dry emotional bandwidth care people still refuse listen. staying home gotten it. worth life, no? Somehow, carbon dioxide gets trapped mask that's end breathing die.

/s poe's fucking law rioting same. right lump together

Nowhere say protesting rioting same. Hi

I'm pointing people took sake risks expense everyone else. *Why safe stupid?* don‚Äôt like needles, I‚Äôm going take Coronavirus vaccine protect others. Yessssss First, looking like China simply first outbreak, necessarily actual source. There's good chance disease brought Wuhan World Military Games. 

Second, China first really get shit together break transmission eradicate disease domestically. 

Third, China even source American outbreak NYC - Europe was.

Finally, current/recent outbreak China totals 260 people 2 weeks. America generates many cases within 9-10 minutes. China control. America? much.

But even ignoring that, China something well, there's shame learning it. 3% reduction major city population even reduce rent prices. Yes. means stop testing virus go away! California's lockdowns baked-in now- PR campaign get people used idea again.i hope people realize lock lock School Flu season Even SF Bay Area enough anti vax, essential oils types freedom liberty idiots make progress challenging.  Damn. Tenn riding big boys. feeling bet right now? ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting mask mail!‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good!‚Äù
- ‚ÄúBut mask contains COVID-19‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bad‚Äù
- ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre young, healthy adult!‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good!‚Äù
- ‚ÄúBut family members aren‚Äôt‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bad‚Äù
- ‚ÄúBut family members keep physical distance!‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good!‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThat physical distance contains sodium benzoate‚Äù

- ‚Äú.........‚Äù Well Trump Pence tried deny reality situation, today, devoted fan follow suit? surprised led community Yeah, called Arizona. :\[ I'll bet hard headed fucks still get either Hold alligator  appreciate insight. That's even including people die everything else (normally treatable) due run hospitals, staff shortages imagine.

Although measurable, there's probably going even preventable deaths due interruption services. large segments workforce work areas could detrimental effects too.

Like personally I'm IT, there's whole hell lot life safety mission critical systems rely people like make sure keep running. hospital major shortage take long things start breaking.  think would fair say demographics age groups.

Because let‚Äôs face it, people saying April would point people would gradually start drifting back together. Yea. DUH. runs wheel chair. A) testing duh 
B) deaths aren‚Äôt going up11!!
C) It‚Äôll gone Easter anyway  mean trust? Someone dedicated life medicine?

Plenty people ""dedicate lives"" professions still suck at. Look ""Dr."" Oz California plowing ahead reopening, numbers going fast

We take cue follow lead Also WNYer here... even though phase 3, doesn‚Äôt really feel like it. Sure restaurants open dine lot not. lot open pretty dead would say.

The thing see everyone wearing masks here. Today saw teenagers playing catch face coverings, grocery stores still following mask mandate diligently. 

Last couple things wanted add pretty easy access cleaning supplies, bleach, soap name brand hand sanitizer now. Places like wegmans keep ppe stocked stores cleaned. Even Clorox wipes bought online shipped normal prices now. feel like things keeping uptick tick surge. invited bar morning birthday party. told I'm going. Staying safe much possible. I'll let others make mistake take risk. look ways crossing street, buckle seat belt, take vitamins drink drive. I'm hurry die take chances including risking infection COVID-19. Nope 47200 cases yeah, trying contrarian anything, hope come like that. i'm honestly kind bewildered situation, say least. company work pretty \*trustworthy\*, they're telling us worry it... worry true state things elsewhere. (obligatory) ... far!

The US gonna tank world economy refusal wear mask. beyond stupid. countries handling far better going suffer shit show well.

It's Obama's fault though. /s  going theory kids 10 dont enough ACE2 receptors.. theres cross immunity extent coronaviruses (see kids get everything above).

But thats data showing..

Other antidotial information:

YMCA NYC never stopped child care (under 10) first responders whole thing. Hasnt outbreak there.


I dont know make arent seeing attack/transmit vector 10. Ffs! Stop blaming us Millenials everything. us kids now. We're ones partying. numbers stopped testing much. weird europe reopen phases cases still lower RemindME! 2 weeks You‚Äôre absolutely right think instance social media helped choices made today. Obviously voting best choice though extent parts true. Florida fine Phase 1. everyone forgot. bars essentially closed again. can‚Äôt cure stupid. turns protecting economy harder saying ""everyone pretend virus doesnt exist"" Carbon monoxide poisoning.

Thats overheard passing group anyways See tomorrow Darwin Awards close up, they're running 
of certificates give people. /s Lol rate next week start seeing +1.5M per week, insane Man... America number 1 think pass law someone shows one things order avoid wearing mask, protected criminal civil legal action take give paper cut edge it, across eyes.  study suggest students young vectors, prove it. Also, I'm sure study peer reviewed yet would like see results reproduced assume accurate. hope results hold one preliminary study something base policy around. saw somewhere mean age new covid positive patients Florida dropping significantly, lethal complications less likely among young. sad I'm liberal-leaning state let tell go waterfall local trail almost every single person wearing mask outdoors almost top packed is. soon saw turned around, mask on, walked back car. feeling stupidity transceds political beliefs. Yeah country 17 new cases today 0 deaths. Everything still fully locked down. pubs, restaraunts shops, schools everyone working home all. That's 17 cases wtf USA sort shit lol say JESUS FUCKING CHRIST? sheer amount numbers today? wanted go... let leave union WANTED go..... Yes. 
Source: Mormon family .... clearly crisis well beyond POTUS manage, maybe congress step up? CA extremely red outside big cities. know pilot regularly flies FL, hits town zero regard masks/distancing; flies back NJ. NJ asked anyone coming back hot state self quarantine, find airline pilots exempt. reminds epic meme XD Projected virus growth time 10 50% day time published such. Wuhan lockdown... took numbers March 16th, estimated 30% growth day, 1/2 billion cases would‚Äôve reached 4/21 22. 

So, lockdowns happening abroad, projection. 

Ps: you‚Äôre mom stupid. feel like we‚Äôre 10 million cases deep, saying ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù means lot start. spike reported deaths think New Jersey reported huge number probable deaths (presumably last months). Lot ""reports"" like this. people filming hospitals proving otherwise
Strange shit 25% effectiveness.

Great, another repost. already saw yesterday.  donny says, stop testing virus infections happen. based what? total lack knowledge subject? Immaterial. point many done fine need mandate state. Here's screenshot counties CA lowest infection numbers. then, viral spread POTUS rallies, **then fault press!!**

^/s read media sources world chose this? mean, really believe China thing control? totalitarian government controls news outlets. could true virus still killing thousands everyday nobody get news out. Wear masks. Wash/sanitize hands. Socially distance. Alameda County stable hospitalizations, positive testing rates, ICU admissions.

Again, we're back possible conclusion best hope herd immunity among young, quarantines old. People want something definitive one way -- either fully open fully locked -- might better different rules guidance young old. walk it, slowly possible, chart citing, pretty, show think does.

The chart shows hospitalizations reported CDC laboratory confirmed, 28% individuals age 50. 

As cases increase, hospitalizations increase. hospitalizations increase, rate hospitalization also increases, short massive influx new people population. That's basic mathematics. Try using cold grey matter head. number cases increases factor 10 number hospitalizations per number cases stays same, rate hospitalization (which based number cases overall population size) also increases factor 10.

That's God must hate them, coming together now. mean something people I'd agree, 10mil (largely) preventable deaths insignificant. Furthermore, assess people who've contracted disease lifelong problems also people suffer external conditions cancer get diagnosed months ultimately suffer/died result. yea vaccine technologies vastly easier scale method, pros cons basically vaccines trialled ""I take responsibility"" - Coward-in-Office, Donald Trump makes think wont happen case? Recovering alcoholic here, drinking home *significantly* cheaper. Trust me, I'm former expert, lol. shut bars today, least, right?

Bars ridiculous idea pandemic, imo. loud people yelling, crowded other, can't freaking ear mask drinking! can't nice things. wrong, also dead serious clear that.

It's unfortunate would likely make things worse overall, shed tear anybody total idiot stuff getting sick. Except whole spreading part. people stupid. 'You guys', 'wanted' hiding internet safety go hand hand feeble...

Just like swedens measures hope. rate Florida hit 15k, maybe 20k+ new Covid cases July 4th. That's New York level numbers. governor something closing beaches low hanging fruit would really help slowing cases. generations drank like fish. Agreed. March amusement parks NBA announced suspending season, got people's attention. Yeah probably MILLION percent!!

Lol

And sure - realize would asymptomatic people 1918 right? that's can't know actual IFR back then. go *confirmed* fatality rate. compare that's data have!

So, stands now, COVID's case fatality rate literally *twice* high. that's FIRST wave. recall, Spanish Flu's first wave fucking joke!

It's fucking hilarious think apt compare 4 months COVID 26 months flu came three different waves.

It's like ran 2 miles marathon said ""this easy!""

But look, get it. Reality hard accept! understand need tell things able sleep night. 

Unfortunately however, cozy bubble made pop. 

Hopefully pop way multiple people know dying!

Talk soon! You‚Äôre using numbers meant calculate death rates, essentially undeniably wrong possibly order magnitude. It‚Äôs basically flawed premise support conclusion Covid worse flu. don‚Äôt disagree conclusion though.

Why aren‚Äôt antibody studies significantly better way calculate death rates?
The death rate almost assuredly 0.5-1.2% * totally safe open up
* people infected get sick
* people get sick die
* Articles fringe agencies foreign languages say virus issue
* can't count vaccine might well get it
* Never respond statistics deflect
* Let's stage corona parties get drunk hope get infected!  Hindsight 2020 say... Half million. 5,000 deaths ""reported"" within April, May June. 350 pound diabetic cousin gave long lecture fake news I'm pathetic hate Donald Trump much. 

When said ""this flu,"" remind mother died complications pneumonia.

It's cult. open want. People send kids. can‚Äôt cure stupid. 'Where world' come from? nice quote also said recommend masks beginning cause wanted make sure healthcare companies got (but failed share reasoning healthcare companies get masks workers). Uhhhh flew NY TN American June 5th flight FILLED. Every seat. ??? WTF time.  society really lose cases Tennessee too. Reminder: Trillion 1,000 Billions! even spent 100 Billion items would far ahead, plus think many lives could saved. Highway 3 146 would get em people stupid work Karma!

Too bad lots people believe something happens. researchers able see change number contacts because, serendipitously, group Chinese researchers ~~done survey contact patterns Shanghai initial outbreak COVID-19. repeated survey lockdown.~~ spying along. oh look, noticed...... 


God, we're gonna die......... Well long protest outside masks on. still idiots tho. realized anti-maskers also anti-vaxxers when/if corona vaccine developed. I'm personally bridges. hate civil engineers river- crossing ways. 
.../s? ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) NorCal full non-mask wearing dipshits. That‚Äôs situation. blame Al Gore. thinking?

Edit: clarify silliness young folk, electoral nonsense yesteryear, Al Gore supposedly claimed invented internet. actually happen (although sponsor legislation helped make internet possible).

Anyway, feel pain commenter I'm responding to. placed enormous amount hope believed internet would humanity, bringing us together. Yet seem divided ever, least U.S. surprise me. Everything I've seen Ohio past years seems like I'm reading Alabama Mississippi. understand Ohio gone backwards recently. Damn reference 380 new cases Canada today. Canada‚Äôs population 35 million Florida‚Äôs 20 million. Mad client....who fucking federal government. Well. tested positive antibodies. LOLOL

Wow fair, very, cases that, rule-breakers would climb windows.

The typical case sealing side doors force entry/exit single point could tracked. Okay numbers sort speak themselves. tens thousands people gathering day day cities around bay, virus spreads way (masked folks crowded together shouting, outside open air) sure reflected testing. Hey LA neighbor. Used feel same. next-door neighbors tested positive virus. told recently 21 people died street already. (Fairfax district) know hot out, please wear mask outside, too...if go out. safer. Lmao underrated became sick, definitely spread sister nephew. nephew diagnosed ""viral infection"" tested. sister denied testing.

Trump thinks otherwise unfortunately still large number people 30-40% many states believe Covid ""just like flu"" refuse wear masks. problem went soft lock slowed growth disease, reason decided okay start ""reopening"" even though cases initially went soft lockdown. Meanwhile, 30-40% refusing isolate lockdown lifted literally act everything back normal.  can't even imagine bad flu season starts. Sounds nice. way MS.

With World Disinformation War isnt exactly crazy... California isn‚Äôt fucking yet still getting hit hard shit ""They protect serve"". They're though. enforce law see fit. police enforce giving blank check harass minorities. 

That said think needs enforcement establishments require masks. establishments need help dealing problematic patrons refuse mask police get involved. far police enforce whoever feel like that's bad idea. They've proven incapable less power better. Same. Someone really likes working home guess. I‚Äôve seen videos people talk mask activates virus. mainstream places, saying dangerous remember correctly, harm goof, improper use mask infect you, ideas main stream media. coupled shaming people wearing them.... well are. Well ski season got crushed year. died car crash pneumonia.

I don‚Äôt struggle friends masking. frequently argue parents grandparents put damn mask. infuriating. Covid? Meet Stupid. horrifying. They'll put name it. Hell, they'll probably even call trump vaccine. No, PA NY simply handling well. massive outbreaks managed them. slowly opening phases mandating masks enforcing distancing.

Nah, put tractor trailers like [last say ""good'"" specific. asking ""will available take autumn?"" answer impossible, anyone giving definite answer lying. shown effective tomorrow whether safe gonna take lot testing. remember vaccines generally ingrain (for lack better word) immune system proving problem later life incredibly difficult. Assuming shown safe effective September, produce 7ish billion doses HEK293 cells. system using grow cells produce vaccine like scaled actually making quantity product would either require hilariously massive combined effort biologics industry regulatory agencies allowing changes process see happening. Honestly, I'm hopeful people risk able get vaccine autumn anyone's guess. would hopeful treatment get sick, like regeneron trying produce, rather vaccine point time. China control citizens US.

Pretty simple. Oh right, saw edit. makes sense :) Can‚Äôt second wave first wave never ends

Oh god. got war flashbacks. feel pretty hopeless knowing time despite trying careful, leaving house go work take walks away people, nothing get better anything, everything got worse people get sick die every day end sight. beginning, thought people might actually get shit together work together try handle thing, thinking family friends, struggle even think maybe 3 4 take seriously capacity. think might gone insane apologies nothing said made sense, think I'm losing mind game me. Good. Idiots.  Doesn‚Äôt matter. virus going run course one way another. country state immune. Closing everything wouldn‚Äôt make difference. Let people build immunity getting it. It‚Äôs late anything else.  You‚Äôd dangerous idea talking about. 

1. 32k hospitalizations? making argument week? month? general? even know?

2. rate hospitalizations overall still 4.6 people per 100k, patients 65 representing vast majority number. far cry assertion ‚Äògood portion those‚Äô 50 end hospitalized. 

So keep thinking you‚Äôre smartest guy room, us keep laughing you. It‚Äôs always people comfortably sitting home risk lives first tell others risk lives lmao. surprised. Antibodies supposed short term. Keeping antibodies blood requires energy. presence antibodies indicates cells learned fight infection. cells memory produce antibodies exposed again. Great! need solid investment Rent-A-Chicken business struggling bit. mass people false positives thinking they're going immune lot false negatives knowing they're carriers? Total recipe success. 

Get good test place, ban others, make happen. many shoddy tests still market. Im aware ifr cfr is. Im seeing anything 40 million cases talking about. 

So going current US infections 2.5 million 175k deaths gives fatality rate 5%. take 20m+ infected gives fatality rate less 1%. USA #1!!! 

Wait, isn‚Äôt World Cup.....   Washington fredmeyer employee (grocery store) 0 enforcement taking place. Employees forced wear makes sent home. still slowing people without masks. mean they‚Äôve scaled restaurants back 75% capacity 50% capacity. could ask for? That's really good point. Back March lot Canadian social media full people offering get groceries anyone couldn't, offering share toilet paper hand sanitizer, really looking ways help other. certainly everyone, know even majority, vocal. helped us build atmosphere working together, plus always like think we're different Americans. Americans absolutely lovely people try humble they're good things, assholes loud. Well tbf testing practically non-existent beginning US never gonna stop major player world stage. It‚Äôll lose political brownie points office president won‚Äôt seen important while, that‚Äôs mostly irrelevant grand scheme things.

You qualified later. cases, grandparents responsible demise. cannot say are. grandparents kids grandkids think right. dementia patients, elderly people guts stand kids.

And homework. Michigan, facilities lockdown, according good friend mine visit mom independent care facility Michigan. even requiring visitors mask, making exceptionally nervous. jesus fuck........

Mercola.com FYI, went doc recently sick awhile wasn‚Äôt getting better. Ended testing positive Covid! Annnnd guess what? *never* fever, temp actually kinda low (97.6 think). 

So letting people know taking temps isn‚Äôt even much full-proof plan screening Covid. 

I‚Äôve sooo many symptoms, plus days completely miserable point hallucinating, never fever! 

About hit 2 weeks Covid, I‚Äôm starting finally get *little* better. That‚Äôs borne facts. new case new death numbers steadily declined since early April. numbers relatively low, per capita.

Edit: Deaths still little high, that‚Äôs likely residual people infected months ago think you‚Äôre confusing South Korea China. really planning fix this? He‚Äôs even pushing major healthcare reform. Meanwhile since fuck policy managed isolation returning citizens several days record breaking testing. Excluding already isolation taken quarantine facility resulted zero cases. Almost 100,000 tests since fuck up.

I extremely angry actions involved fuck hole fixed incredibly lucky continue infections streak things fine Reports data hospitalizations ICU case volumes missing vague getting old.

That sounds pretty bad, 10,000 100,000. US pacing toward 1 Million, 10 Million question. probably spiking (at least yet).

Meh. vaccine it‚Äôs risk I‚Äôm going take. actually know, think anyone does. However, know protests largely limited time, organized attended people cautious wearing masks, maintaining masks, limiting space. also know American populace rejecting preventative measures sustained period, continue so, flagrantly disregards attempt avoiding contact people. 
 
While know scale either two groups are, suspect they're honestly pretty even considering cleanly divided country always manages be. So, maybe protests bad -- definitely think want lay blame, start swath people wearing masks, continue yelling much want wear masks... protesters retreated homes resumed decent measure social distancing already. won‚Äôt weeks 4th people actually die It‚Äôs good prediction. thing is, 5th break that. 6th beat 5th on.

What fucking coincidence. Well, evidence suggests known percentage (I know US) people contract disease die. Therefore highest ever infection figures due course become highest-ever death figures. 

It's bad enough England watching capering half-wit screw time time resulting unnecessary deaths (as deaths 'necessary', seems phrase use) proclaiming response covid-19 ""world-beating"", least figures going (though query long keep given way people behaving last week so).

However, 1 person immunized one less person virus effect. least 50% population immune times, virus would slow spreading dramatically. people vaccinated, time grace period exists virus cannot spread easily, means time distribute vaccines, means people vaccinated.

Once initial push given, people resistant. besides that, say stop trying understand COVID-19 cone vaccine develops, especially vaccine works short time? Treatments used manage symptoms, combat virus, reduce mortality rates. Thus, researching treatments means tools doctors fight virus.

Stop it. evil. mean inevitable, toxic individualism everywhere America. Fuck, Libertarians basically people somehow think Americans selfish enough *already*. far... America gonna hit cases God knows future go? late july late may?? sucks, school michigan first week september first week june, sounds like southwest got screwed whole extra month school tired winning yet? true: according CDC, highest day cases April 6th, 43,438 confirmed cases country-wide. CDC also reports today actually 40,588 confirmed cases. biggest one day increase either, April 6th 26,065 confirmed cases, difference 17,373 cases. Yesterday 37,667 confirmed cases, difference 2,921. 

Today actually second highest number confirmed cases America far though, isn‚Äôt even close largest spike cases. absolutely heartbreaking hear. Stay safe everyone. 50% Americans don‚Äôt believe science. worries, stay complicit. never going end. Lockdown life babyyyy Odds right. sticks enough missed school opening day deer hunting gun ask excuses hard imagine. wish negativity world thing plastered everywhere look. I‚Äôm say controversial please reply civilised way (I don‚Äôt want offend anyone).

Isn‚Äôt fault black lives matter? US reopening quite without surge cases suddenly week massive protests cases skyrocket. missing something?

Of course protesting cause good pandemic maybe best idea Keep wearing masks folks! Damn that‚Äôs pandemic  keep seeing people say need let virus ‚Äúburn out.‚Äù That‚Äôs literally never happened before. worries! know we'd like generalize privacy laws works US, especially since enactment Patriot Act (not fan), rest assured privacy data one difficult data obtain day, look court battles! (airports, cops entering phone arrest, etc). We're actually winning war one court battle time! probably referring data collected via FISA courts warrants collected specific intent gathering evidence relates counter-intel counter-terrorism. 

This normal prosecution quite difficult US nowadays involves digital data. US Attorneys state respective District Attorneys generally obtain lot evidence cross ""threshold"" probable cause. Lot private companies fighting battle well hate lose customers (looking AT&amp;T).  finally figure out

Keep dreaming. time they'll say hospitals lying. Someone post old picture somewhere completely empty ICU ward FB claim reality gullible lap scream conspiracy again. Late May

Just media report havoc that's going mean still going on. chance one dude covid extremely small, though real crappy that. crazy thing nostalgic March memes like, ""Hey forefathers stormed beach Normandy, sit couch 2 weeks"" -- people really thought would 2 weeks! telling everyone knew back March kids going back school September 50/50, thought nuts. I‚Äôm school librarian last year couple middle school students interviewed experiences 9/11 class project. Nothing make feel older! Somebody tell Boomers Gen Z exist Spreading disease context consists normal daily behavior. 

I'm trying tell why. That's why. People want normal things. Yeah protests affect pandemic believe science also happen loudest. Muh freedom anti vaxxers = one same? God hope not. gonna wait that, countries letting said one tactic that‚Äôs helped keep virus shelters decision isolate symptomatic medically vulnerable people motel rooms, treated tested. Upvoting people see retarded statement. 

It's almost like research anything commenting. Like done listened excuse provided Fox News Donald Trump running it. ‚Äúirresponsible tourists‚Äù allowed crowding frequenting bars, hotels beaches?  mean get early May? Maybe cases spread hospitals get overwhelmed? stop testing, that's way bring numbers down.....yes I'm genius...you're welcome Thanks kind words! hoping that, least, results used university develop messages encourage student face mask wearing. Hopefully research catches used elsewhere, too. Australia #71 falling. like way! isn‚Äôt good argument man medical student feel like pandemic perfect lesson future. remember reading back December January USA ranked among best countries handle pandemic. used look CDC, thinking they'd always look health. However saw anti mask sentiment February March despite SE Asia recommending knew hope lost. supply chain issue, even given guidance improvise mask got control. CDC's/US government's handling COVID-19 go one worst public health decisions time. clear evidence regards countries/states adopted early mask usage rates infection. masks work, worst piece fabric front face. work, protecting others. understand risk assessment hard people make. somehow mandatory pants different... Nah I‚Äôm good brother, hope find way enjoy life without attacking strangers online. Obviously you‚Äôre going shit spend time, good luck Stay home then. concerned children dying, know safe. 

Schools daycares massive incubators viral transmission, children schools daycares elderly teachers, granparents, etc.

Spreading disease vulnerable concern, concerns often explain United? Wait thought going Delta... Disney postponed opening Disneyland Disneyworld, understand. time realize I'm wearing mask. Like realize I'm wearing glasses start looking it. Yesterday tried eat grapes wearing mask forgot it. read Newsom saying he'd refuse bow, would shock allowed beaches open protests.

Not like many cities, counties, states even enforcing orders wear masks. happens police defunded? social workers begging people wear masks? re-post actual title, edited one. That's wrong. parts CA excellent job taking preventative measures early. Bay Area counties first lockdown many followed suit. Something like 70-80% supported lockdowns.

But Orange County Florida rural counties want told do. Also, ravaging Latino community disproportionately since farm workers essential yet Latinos likely live overcrowded housing get fewer assistance stay home many undocumented. Hardly fault.

Politicians lead example absolutely place majority blame officials ignore science fucking stupid culture war shit ""economy"". president refusing wear mask sets example. did, bet ass MAGA cult would too. observation reality.

Find country actually want US do, learn language to, go. I'm hoping best home point realize ship sinking, going survive get lifeboat.

Of course, moment ship accepting lifeboats ship, help waiting line eventually do. Honestly?

There pretty clear difference ordering someone something versus asking care people. Anyone spent time interacting human beings knows surefire way get tell fuck order something rather ask. 

Regardless people feel wearing masks general (and record country mandatory mask orders, live Australia) seems type push back entirely expected? Particularly coming low level government functionary governor executive.

I'm excusing response here, particularly ""death threats"" (really? wtf people?) naive human behavior anyone favors. think what's sickening hearing anti-mask people's arguments. hard wear flippin mask. That's completely irrelevant point trying make fucking hot rains random. thanks.

I doubt that.  definitely good article explores intriguing questions coronaviruses general. Weird article. Sweden back roughly normal baseline deaths time year. They've peak come fine, shut now? anything, probably start adjusting/removing restrictions distancing recommendations see without cases drastically increasing. nose wire help this. fit nose cheeks. Apparently it‚Äôs considered private party you‚Äôre dancing, turns public event. you‚Äôre public event need permit. ended three friends facing charges getting fines (not big).

Faceplam. new one me, lol, surprised. ;) fOrEvEr miss 6 months worth of

My ex kept getting together friends lockdown ""I gotten *anything* months"". lockdown over, back making plans usual. wear masks around other. Oh ""I'm going stand 6 feet away run friend street, we're friends, that's ridiculous"". Also found standing couple feet away neighbor hanging smoking &amp; chatting. Someone never spoken ""we live building, keep distance besides, he's sick"".

He's worried bringing covid home already it. yeah, nevermind immunocompromised, still sick 4 months later nobody knows long immunity lasts *if even made antibodies* (not sure thing health problems).

Those reasons he's ex sure shit influenced decision. downfall, arguing weather use something save people. More: gap understand virus transmitted. Even scientists saying '3ft, good' GF works retail wears N95 face-shield. trust face-shield alone confined indoor spaces. Except we‚Äôre unfortunately.

Keep mind ""summer heat"" Sweden US south. We're talking typically 25-30C humid. People actually spent time outdoors summer. Winter time Swedes hang indoors. Thanks, needed depressed today. Trump became president social media created Culture matters ME.  fellow German here. confirm case since January.

We're entering seventh month governmental failure. Please dont say stuff like that. People numbers. Considering he's publicly said thinks least people wearing masks indicate dislike him, mockong people wearing masks, think generous. Italy terrible job hahaha, want good example look New Zealand, Japan, Canada. much top-down issue. wealthy elites company worry much virus afford luxuries amenities able test receive treatments bolster immune systems become compromised.

It's painfully obvious administration level, Federally many State administrations, mindset clearly prioritizing profits stabilization economy.

Nobody runs show Federal level gives damn imposing lockdowns regulating use masks know constituents predominantly privileged wealthy individuals personal self-interests prioritized serving common good. country selfish even inconvenienced wearing small cloth face public, surprise virus decimating entire country right now.

And stop? Nobody going mandate anything safety. Nobody power regulate thing currently gives shit anyone currently reading thread. Unless donating political careers giving vote, honestly care. Hell, they'll stop caring shortly either things anyways.

Our country filled selfish entitled people face planet. It'll take attending funeral loved one passed away COVID-19 wake hell serious is. even then, they'll find someone else blame inevitably happens.

I feel like truly lost.  Without order dropped maybe 10% people wearing masks. employers kinda required employees often ignored it.  Delta id also pretty good imo american airline I've flown in, thing stood good smooth flight stupid. course deaths cases maybe two three times higher, could hide millions cases rest world? announce pre-existing drug week back ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Well, increasing death count data artificially, seems fair go end. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll even end. Absolutely! world likely going hit 500k deaths tomorrow, too. realized stop moment chilling actually absorb many people is. Well yeah never claimed professional. leeway single person testing street-by-street? 

Can congregate settings? large offices/call centers/warehouses/meat processing? batch 10 time local testing center cheap call follow up?

People also need stop saying ""The US."" clear unified strategy. Places like new York, Jersey, Chicago, Detroit, could benefit strategy. Right

Good luck talking person booking flight asking plane HEPA filter?

Im wondering hard line sand airlines drawing mask wear. CA allowed claim medical exemption get around state mandate abused people simply want wear mask. Ah. sure throw words ‚Äútraction‚Äù ‚Äúleverage‚Äù optimum corporate enhancement. neither apparently guy knows better know myself.... Well prayer fantastic track record . think got rid Black Plague /s So... best part? That's really true, though. Often, grandparents understand choice. kids grandkids say they're coming over, would take adamant, mentally with-it elderly person say ""no"". And, case, party surprise party. 

In case, really people planned party responsible grandparents' demise. #sad. virus loves underestimated. flourishes places dismiss it. dies people take seriously. protecting older people better now, defeat united it. care people lifes journey. work Disney Springs second this.

It‚Äôs definitely important states mandate precautions safety citizens personal level people also try physically isolate much can.

Unfortunately, getting claiming they're en route Alaska.

 starts coffee ends digital certificates forced vaccinations,‚Äù Gilles said.

With starts coffee ends croissant. I'm mostly sane. too. I‚Äôll take good old hospital home town day. That's thing - people scared anymore. That's cases skyrocketing many parts country, people can't bothered. :/ guess... escalated numbers means death rate lower risk lower... guess. sensationalize everything pretty soon people stop paying attention. Interesting read Make America great know Swine Flu pandemic, right? handled better never turned completely fucky (also seemingly contagious fatal). swear god could remove one word English language associations it, *toxins* would there.

*Toxins* *energy* catch terms holistic health marketplace. gross. Ah damn, idea. I've mostly following SF South Bay part we're going back lockdown, can't much better.

While maybe silly, perhaps look whether virus cause idiocy people? I'm actually back work bc forced be. Karens cant stand able go happy hour! kids special needs talking years even catch were. need keep mind many kids special needs never 2 weeks year without school therapies. expect kids may take 2 3 regular school years recover lost skills therefore lose 3 years time towards learning needed skills.

We see one comes true. find oxygen supplement works better ventilator? death rate 1/16th Spanish flu 4 months death rate detected cases falling rapidly Trump administration incalculably stupid. 

For example, Trump suggests many new cases covid-19 stop testing. Wtf? also wondered loud can't inject disinfectants bodies. President United States uttering complete psycho nonsense.

It's embarrassing lying, divisive, narcissistic dolt represent country. Maybe careful slinging around terms like 'entitlement'. 

You currently unemployment benefits, long keep getting that, need return work. Considering situation, practical solution you. 

Other people use means put bread table. 

Call entitlement like. I'll call practicality. see nothing useful Florida

We find real quick effective ""bubble"" objects digital certificates, know swipes Starbucks members card discounts. personally like send people extra copies emails.

If went, anyone infected wearing mask could given him. infected went, wearing mask likely preventing hundreds new infections. damn sucks good parable grammar made eyes bleed. Here's fixed version.

A man told scientists social distance - not.

He told scientists go party - made BBQ.

Scientists told wear mask - refuse, convinced family believe God instead.

Texas posted way 1,000 yesterday 2,900 day Place bets 100 million mark üíµ diamond play button analogy going change fact congregating pandemic still spread virus, regardless people wearing masks.

What spreads virus more? party 150 people 10 people get infected, protest 10k people 100 people get infected? first case, 15% infection rate, whereas second case 1% infection rate. Yet, due increased raw population number, second case spreads virus more.

**The virus spreads protests, whether ideologically support protests not**. Yeah point people go beach summer time, therefore literally nothing worry regarding indoor 4th July parties... Righhhhhtttttt...... actually think it‚Äôs still law. yes, it‚Äôs facepalm worthy. Japan want #1 COVID 19 death toll. Florida wants #1 badly.  I‚Äôm impressed satan took time spreading evil around universe give guy corona.....he must important fella . media 

Oh stfu, 100% right-wing lunacy, ""the media."" u live true lol Exactly funniest thing. I'm surprised blamed covid Obama yet. I'm guessing OAN somehow heard anything it. they'll blame Hillary's emails somehow.  Yep. let wear mask? Sure get tested can‚Äôt go work. Seems easier ignore symptoms tough out. weighed situation hand ignore data showing miss approximately 90% cases? OK fam that's feel it, too. masks kinda suck least faction people must wear glasses, included. but, better getting sick, making everyone around sick. avoid people much possible wear much. Lol wouldn‚Äôt call 6,000 cases day uptick. mean President trying opposite places like Florida cooking books. Minnesota public radio what‚Äôs called ‚Äúpartner station‚Äù national public radio. Basically, NPR stations create radio programs picked stations around country, mixing local content too.

So hear ‚ÄúNPR sponsored partner stations‚Äù mean. Possibly. hard apples apples comparison. suffered much initially, NYC protestors cautious cities? likely wear masks &amp; remain 6 feet away? gut says yes, hard know sure. much still know virus, baffling people say (and report!) protests somehow immune. old white men want stay power. convince old white men younger generation reason problems world.

‚ÄúBut right, easy forge know Swedes dishonest prone lying breaking law right? ;) mean many? Probabl ymore one hopes hey whole rationale behind vaunted Swedish strategy 'swedes follow rules' one forgive Danes bit naive thinking will.‚Äù

This think wrong. don‚Äôt see Swedes would prone break rules Scandinavians. actually feel Danes would prone bending rules, breaking. Also social rules codes. Danes Swedes get equally pissed someone takes traditional Christmas food wrong order. Breaking rules almost worse breaking law. It‚Äôs frowned upon cheating cutting line. That‚Äôs think typical Swede would try cheat Denmark. course, always bad apples. jest husband got really bad viral infection dirreah month. Horrendous. whopping 0.125 percent neighbor tested positive - main symptom stuffy nose. elderly thankful all.  Recently ""campaign reelect Donald Trump"" using local number.

The number blocked still would get voicemail.

Turned voicemail account get ""call blocked"" alert. already deal plenty problems get virus I'll probably fucked. [WTB]: Ranked-Choice Voting, please. Exactly. Germs nothing new, people care before, now? I've seen vile things public transportation pre-COVID - people wiping noses hands touching handles doors, followed another person coming touch spot putting hands faces. sick.

The difference could pick could put ventilator hospital, care flu getting sick TIME before, think lot people desensitized threat even now. It‚Äôs true though. right wont take reason many adamantly refuse wear mask, left wont take pre-election it‚Äôll perceived unsafely rushed try bolster üçä‚Äôs election prospects (and wont help he‚Äôll certainly advertising ‚Äúüçävaccine‚Äù). experience I've never missed flu shot 20+ years since then. something fuck around with. banned store life. Fox News came prominence modern conservative era happened. Partisanizing generally agreed upon views benefit corporations. there's bunch ignorant lemmings incapable critical thinking running around. alternative attempting salvage economy would already back track done due diligence first place really comes lack leadership federal state local levels. needed consistent, direct message wearing masks social distancing levels infection reach certain level- bottom line. also seems lack empathy fellow Americans complex issue. could watershed moment history bringing us together defeat virus country influences prevailed tearing us apart.  yet many states countries manage it, longer 10 weeks.

No entirely possible. matter sacrifice. numerous causes throughout history entire societies recognized cause consigned sacrifice. Wow yeah, that‚Äôs good point. indoctrination ""muh freedom"" group ignorant entitled Americans believe God's chosen one.

Only country, shit allowed. Malls opening weekend though... Shameful honestly. I'd rather seeing dining indoors restaurants limited capacity, see absolutely pointless malls open zero capacity limitations.

I go anywhere near either years, still, people going probably come near me.

Sucks, watching us make mistakes USA, bit delayed. hope set incredible test trace around phase re-opening. somehow doubt it.. go Walmart cough purpose accident get sick. inside house. *confetti falls ceiling* good point people keep saying young people catching now. spread older relatives coming weeks. People still call Sandy Hook 911 conspiracy 100% hoax people I'm glad seeing normalcy. hope keep that. say probably aware statistics mortality rates virus children.

Two points:

1) Consider desired result achieved even though misinformed, children isolating elderly. consider win, because...

2) getting people interpret statistics rationally, especially pertain health children epidimiology novel virus yet fully understand, probably impossible. mean, that's kinda happening. smart folks wearing masks careful. dumb ones going Trump rallies refusing wear masks.

The unfortunate thing dumbs going take us spread. interesting, democracy founded concept given rights people expected civically minded society needs function. Basically rights given expectation responsibility. like remind people crowd viciously defending bakery refusing service gay couples, they're arms businesses refusing service *them.*

You realize mocking someone without understanding they're coming fundamentally flawed way approaching things.

If wear mask reduce odds getting COVID lot.

Pedestrians care road safety may kill cases. Drivers care road safety likely kill others. That's punish drivers harder violation traffic regulations.

In pandemic, takes fraction people behaving recklessly infect others ruin whole health care system. Nothing like reactive proactive ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing today, obviously, lot news saying huge number of, quote, ‚Äòcases,‚Äô‚Äù Gov.

If nothing changed dude, close bars today last week? day risking lives unnecessarily? well, grand scheme things, started, minds catch promise. trying say unintended consequence demonization:

Karen covid denier

Karen gets covid

Karen want people know covid embarrassed stupidity

Karen tell friends, family, loved ones.

Karen gets sicker, friends think issue. 

Karen gets admitted local hospital.

Days later Karen's friends start geting sick. Parks Recreations couldn‚Äôt even come something ridiculous recent ones we‚Äôve seen You‚Äôre wrong all. sit happy ass home basically every day stay far away people work (with mask ofc) can. Bad situation. Haven‚Äôt seen family physically 5 months It‚Äôs south, it‚Äôs also west, northeast Midwest aren‚Äôt looking good week ago Yeah governor told counties cities couldn‚Äôt impose mask requirements individuals. Local authorities begging change mind let impose mask ordinances. Eventually, county judge imposed order fining businesses require masks. Abbott said order consistent limitations he‚Äôd placed local authorities, actually saying judge ‚Äúfinally figured out‚Äù plan contained fun little easter egg hunt officials trying keep covid transmission down. 48 hours later, Adler imposed order Austin. leaders running around like flock seagulls Sounds right, that‚Äôs exponents work. Maybe thats Donald keep saying gone soon. stop testing. Shit stable genius could think that. really see thing else happening unless get major change direction across board.

Generic word there's two different title. Secretary Agriculture Sonny Perdue FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hah said joint statement week. knew better knew immune, want step real leader take heat what's right. he's trying stay good Trump. I‚Äôm Chicago too. Obviously media focusing cases that‚Äôs clear curve that‚Äôs rising. Everything else little derivative. trend continues, deaths start going too, fact aren‚Äôt growing fast anymore means death rate objectively dropped. fact 10x cases officially reported also means true death rate 10x lower. think it‚Äôs mixed bag, focusing cases misinformed. even question intelligent. Talking like talking 5 year old.

He goes back work next week train says workers unions aren‚Äôt enough push back Disney psychotic insistence opening this. nice comment buddy ""Our country"" doesn't. One group does. think simple answer UK national lockdown leader eventually come around taking crisis seriously.

The US national plan, 50 states fend themselves, Trump NEVER took crisis seriously. point lol sake argument, haven‚Äôt seen much discourse plays out: 

I live state mask ‚Äúmandate‚Äù today. put earbuds sunglasses walk self-service place like gym grocery store sans-mask, completely ignore anyone trying stop me, anybody going it? many physically overpower me. going call police me? what, committed crime? reside testicles. There's going tons kids going behind going next grade idea work going required. district near 40% students even login school site participate online learning schools provided laptops every student needed one. daughter friend 3rd grade older sister adhd mother even bother school work spoke believe told us that. blew going advance next grade matter. I'm going make face masks imbedded copper mesh tell idiots block 5G Bill Gates mind control attempts. I'll make millions, wear masks go back normal get numbers control /s ""Hope one hand shit other. 
See one fills first."" Soon millions positives coming way. Strong Objections facemasks *the one party identifies wearing facemasks* USA.

FTFY lot worse. work summer camp industry. I‚Äôm already planning summer camps next year. faith leadership come solutions help situation. I‚Äôm afraid we‚Äôll sail, bow first, straight maelstrom.  proving fair unbiased. black lives matter, lives matter. ü§î one letting us :/ Good job texas Dr. Birx shared interesting slides. said website set everyone review data. 0.006% death rate.  matter many months add argument. twice amount people become infected death toll doubles well math remains same, 0.006% death rate. 20 million cases 174k deaths 0.0063% death rate. insanely low. People obviously can't math ya know?

The irony comment hilarious. You‚Äôre factor 100. that‚Äôs generous assuming meant 124k, 174k. mean extremely hard economy complex. least right idea. sub thinks close everything forever fuck small businesses entire economy. real victims residents NY, NJ, CN deaths per million 10x higher places like Texas Florida.

It‚Äôs almost density populations states large effect pandemic works. 

You may something. Interesting seeing states spiking anything curb transmission rates. 

I‚Äôm sure won‚Äôt matter all. good journalism. try pro con anything give information.

It may bad think would people start parts.

You reopen safely everyone knows safe side. gathering unnecessary wear masks.    would hilarious incredibly wrong bunch people going die it. Prime Trump voters, too. Ironic. Keep curbside delivery. open store, would help shop customers.
They Walmart near must least 10 cars picking given time. Yeah know small shop cannot compare, let customers know open online portal ship to. new world need adapt. people medical issues literally cannot take vaccine anti-vaxxers hurting Neutrally instead wrecking economy like COVID test nobody really knows true answer Antarctica lovely time year. thought anime ass news reporter slamming drink onto table yelling loud hell exactly Iv feeling. can‚Äôt tell people get back work,but also don‚Äôt anything go directly home. whole job requires people go get hair done. stay open supposed get groceries house? I'm way smarter understand risk. flooding nations high doses vitamin panicking much? coffee mug corona virus. Local hospital getting thousands thanks one mug. agree terrible completely forgo people's liberties force people law. Everything needs politicized forced laws fines. aren‚Äôt welding infected people inside homes.  Realistically, people going start paying attention until/unless deaths spike back previous peak. people unfortunately dgaf anything many people dying. European soccer running seems ok stands people!.... economy!.... people!..... economy... people...  hell goes Disney World pandemic? wrong people? Future generations celebrating monuments depicting scene Saint Trump actually do? nothing get people killed. Imagine going back April 1 this. know people like peg people wishing reopen selfish pricks want haircuts

WTF? No!

There real selfish pricks going bar getting slammed friends. They'll even say ""Fuck COVID, care die"" drink 5th beer.

The issue haircuts, haircuts caused massive spikes USA. Lots places haircuts, without massive COVID resurgence. Na want tell show dumb are.

What fatality rate confirmed cases Spanish Flu? hard truth still true.  Went Subway today, one line mask on. Got stares people. would fantastic correct stop visitors countries high number Chinese visitors businessmen women.
Unless wrapped whole population cling wrap numbers add up
Unless maybe population country inbuilt genetic immunity naturally ?
Will interesting see death rates year compared last year.
The original comment answered removed leaving mine up.
Some photos people wearing scrubs provide evidence, death rate comparison will.
Not wish anyone dead look forward proven wrong - done think likely. Tell Doug Ducey.  Uh.... No? originally said forty million ifr 0.26% twenty million ifr twice high. too! really great tied together neatly many snippets things I'd heard/seen/read/observed presented coherent rather quite hilarious package. correct. states governors banded together shutdown, here. going get alot worse. surprised south region obese, seems states 30% +/- 5%. culture conservative politics regions probably contribute much more, wearing mask political now. lot money. One prevent people killed, one encouraging people getting killed. 

I'll let math figure out. American treasure Paulie chimes 'Hit one middle."" feel like Randy Quaid Independence Day...

""I sayin it! Ain't sayin it??"" curious tests done also reason ? chart shows cases vs tests done overtime? Fine no-maskers! Totalitarian Gov't. would dream right now. Canada multicultural seem problem real victims residents NY, NJ, CN deaths per million 10x higher places like Texas Florida.

NJ last weeks alone lost 200 people per 1m focusing Florida lost 157 per 1m last 5 months I'm aware cases, I'm east coast though traveling get Alaska. life permanently ruined virus. Don‚Äôt worry boys we‚Äôll beat record next count. every day least next 2 weeks. That‚Äôs exponential growth thing works. Little none. country incredibly divided; many said, pandemic really revealed truly divided people (fringe, conservative talkradio Fox News OAN certainly helped). literally worst example US city depends tourism. 

Cities like Miami, Vegas LA better examples That‚Äôs fine wouldn‚Äôt idea? mean unless test 20million people we‚Äôll never really know? said state; eastern half full morons.

I'm 53yo lived SoCal life. never heard someone use term ""eastern half"" talking CA. NoCal thing? testing capacity place organized plan, could done that. Since supposed stay away politics, leave reader decide fault this. literally move another country. Nothing stopping you.  keeps here? DiBlasio fucked up. clear. least made effort terrible start. hand, guy casa blanca different stratosphere fucking up. Discipline fucking doomed. Cancel humanity, deserve exist anymore. let people lick eyeballs anymore. think everyone needs support entire family minimum wage? makes think everyone entitled certain standard living, even cannot support it? Housing expenses shared roommates. I'm guessing kind person never actually experienced poverty lot prescriptions situations understand. 47k 128k dead less 4 months. one person said tonight, player, several players gets severaly lll end ends hospital? going leave here.

Dare Stupid - Weird Al Transformers Movie...no Michael Bay one...the real Transformers ""At press conference, DeSantis continued blame virus spread young people social distancing ‚Äì median age infected people dropped significantly since March ‚Äì farmworkers live close quarters."" sad people want valid research quote article even appears fake news. Eh stop testing virus go away /s Thank president telling coworkers beginning.

""Ok great, *die* it, still sounds pretty fucking horrible"" long street?? 21 people dead one street almost unthinkable?? keep egg face. also said issues food supply, flu, fear mongering /doomers, etc. No, won‚Äôt. hospitals get jammed Covid patients again, call National Guard handle heart attacks, broken bones, acute asthma cases. 

The virus sets timeline. economy, summer vacation schedule, school schedule, White House, much last wants deny exists all. 

*The virus sets timeline.* don‚Äôt learn lessons history doomed repeat them...and words Dr. Smith Lost Space: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doomed! Doomed!‚Äù There‚Äôs people United States countries combined plus like 55,000,000 more. Italy? need wait second wave (it means new uncontrolled spread virus). Right anybody found sick, state put entire area person live quarantine monitoring.
If want visit another country, better wait end July know exact situation virus country city want go. Example Italy regions almost completely fine visit, others moment. Remember also smaller city.
""For buy tickets, wait bit more. Check Spain situation place want go anything. Middle August good time think.""
 -Instead hotel, maybe B&amp;B would better(that's personal opinion)-
And please remember check new laws regarding virus remember respect safety others.
That's oh okay sorry sorry human data? Nobody world conclusive safety data apparently do. Please share really want see positive news.
Vaccine + virus exposure definitive safety data, even arguable then. Nothing, nothing else tell confidence. I'm actually happy live US I'm sorry educated subject, faced dozens upon dozens feedback loops coming online, fixing even one would like greatest feet humans ever accomplished.


It hundred degrees Arctic Circle day. Third day row increased cases. last 3 days. know. honestly amazing world came together make possible. vaccine we'll careful nice things look forward again.

Texas rolling back openings, Florida re-closed bars, various cities states + Arizona process hitting ICU bed capacities... national narrative yesterday, national narrative Monday going look remarkably different. bare-bones health insurance policy prescription benefits- I'm talking absolute bare-bones, dental, eye, nothing, $7,000 individual deductible costs us (2 people) $950 month. 

If get sick, really anyone gets sick COVID, facing bankruptcy. loss job income, medical bills. 80/20 plan deductible. way could pay 20% bill. 45 year old friend hospital since May 5th. vent rehab. family afford medical bills? keyword ""no significant transmission"". I'm American living Thailand really praise Thai people responsible caring well others. 

I wake news every morning states handling virus sooo frustrating parents there. Listen experts cooperate people! Thailand great example masks important. BREAKING NEWS: Coronavirus melt balls make fuse sack. 


Just kidding. Please no. Another lock cause people start mass riots mobs, economy collapsing *will* lead wide spread violence.

There critical mass number enough people unemployed, evicted, lost everything (including hope) hungry, adopt nothing left lose attitude really... **really** pissed off. 

I think anywhere near that, legitimate concern consider. need mass civil unrest top uncontrolled pandemic. really wants bang cactus  Karen created cards master boss Karens.

The last one must defeat video games.  Hey Patrick, I? Would like apologize giving blatantly false information? 675 ,000 vs 600,000 non trivial difference, see outright ignored that

From Case-fatality rates 2.5% 2.5%, guess trouble reading comprehension Can't tell saying work requirement bad thing? I'd say things likely get extended though Glad I‚Äôm Illinois. Yet, half people aren‚Äôt wearing masks talking Pritzker. don‚Äôt understand people think still hoax. party voting Trump November (hopefully) San Francisco going days too, today announced wait. Moving goal posts, first flattening curves posts keep moving. let people live lives, shut downs control  alarm think breathing wrong.

(Covid Nads?! Seriously?) Texas here. (Not Texan). given authority county judges mayors enforce rules requiring masks businesses customers businesses. removed penalty jail penalty fines store owners following rules. since one city mayor county judge read ENTIRE FUCKING ORDER LIKE DID(business owner) one figured could pointed them. Reminds Kevin‚Äôs heart book mom told read Bible every time asked help, several months later finally read found put money pages totally game haven‚Äôt found apply.

174k 0.0005%

124k 0.0003%

And precise calculations based 331 million Americans accurate 124k deaths.

Didn't really feel like pulling calculator go. Death rate LOW said anything vote manipulation? Also, said stupid? run people infect Happy cake day! met customer work today told thinks virus hoax handed cash. Thanks lady. naw, leftists tend kill leftists overall, revolutionaries first wall since rowdy ones leftist governments want lose power.

Go look history lol, may learn something. doubt though since worthless fuck though. Nope. seems older risk age group wearing wrong. people get eliminate virus. get better, cannot find viral RNA time. infectious more. build either neutralizing antibodies T-cell-immunity.

There reports viral reactivations, hold water.

There evidence recover virus ""breaks down"".

I think go China virus. even running 0.3-1.0% fatality disease population unchecked catastrophe. 

But yet evidence cause serious difficulties recovered people immunologic clinical dynamics consider highly unlikely. unsurprised Without spectators though.

It's outdoors well, corona levels lower here, bar maybe Sweden. small businesses man power may equipped Please tell sarcastic... comment pretty dumb offense,we even much tests amount detected. possible Covid also brain disorder?

I friend half joked similar toxoplasmosis, virus makes want act ways spread more. ten countries US side war eight countries other. put beautifully. Obviously ramps ***MY*** convenience, screw plebs crutches canes, let alone *lazy* even walk use wheelchairs.


- people, likely wish Georgia would same. Sadly state ramping up.  drove home work see everything downtown packed people. None wearing masks. slow transmission rate half. So, win! Trying find sense way much country responded Covid-19 fool's errand. think ""radical"", think explicitly leftism/progressivism. guess that's niche definition. using normal definition, suppose reactionary media radical. foresee cracks methodology. Canadian, want say, that's weird, never thought that. wonder that's hitting southern states now. Never would thought that. exhausting worldview imprinted mental circuit we‚Äôve always assumed sort ratio everywhere. hoping herd immunity hoped higher ratio. People imagining weren‚Äôt masses untested cases haven‚Äôt following anything. OC CA resident here. worry, people protesting mask rules meetings months. Look back find videos people crazy. health director put ban effect forced resign weeks ago protests death threats. motto matter scenario plays out? Masks work, there's never effective vaccine coronavirus virus, deaths lockdown causing outpacing covid deaths. Even trust estimate still 6% US population. 4-5 months still tenth way herd immunity. That‚Äôs nothing noteworthy here. Iran closest curves US, interesting compare dates expect things lowest new cases 2nd spike came May 2. Deaths stopped falling May 17 pretty flat May 31st rise started again.

The US bottomed June 9. continues similar Iran, expect flat deaths June 24‚ÄîJuly 8 accelerating increase.  7 day rolling average new cases per 1m people several states 1 week ago, yesterday. 

239 - 389 Arizona

112 - 186 Florida

91 - 164 Texas

85 - 123  California

35 - 34 New York

Which ones worth talking about? Exactly! area locked around mid-March too. First county state lock perfect timing. know shit Texas Florida right now, testing capabilities back March/April now, think numbers would even crazier NY PA. testing capability advantage good thing, contrary certain someone implied. 

So least going us nice. Also makes us prepared fall/winter. near opened (New York) hire staff busy. includes bars. combination less competition (sadly many businesses return 2 month closure) excitement return places left led surge. know article yesterday said people movement back pre corona levels America. Tourism devastated local businesses fall think allowed open.  honestly understand fax machines still exist level tech posses. negative even protons run away know asymptomatic people 1918 right? today?

All really compare confirmed cases.

Spanish Flu - 2.5% what‚Äôs current global CFR COVID dummy? Well also think sub infatuated hyper focusing several failing counties using reify doomsday‚Äôs so. That‚Äôs underplay things sucks counties us gunna return business usual next month.  well yes significantly less severe illness original SARS. 17% COVID. 17% includes patients issues tested positive. correct. Also would hella controversial, could impose Marshall law, supersede governors. someone living Europe one watch development US fear, anger lot disappointment. really tragic peoples lifes worth nothing tge leading politicians nothing stop this. People US suffer lot that. We're parade, we're four. Source: live Texas.  OC CA resident here. worry, people protesting mask rules meetings months. health director put ban effect forced resign weeks ago protests death threats. Y'all think would happen elsewhere. schadenfreude knows bounds.

Some us absolutely thought could happen elsewhere. I'm FL even left property months. 

Revel schadenfreude, still remember us done everything right incredibly upset terrified right now. idiots (and say otherwise, know). mean shit, wear mask anytime there's even slight *chance* someone might try talk venture forth grab mail.

After that, things pretty much normal. Well, 'normal'.

I know I'm talking hospitalizations? making argument week? month? general? even know?

Did even read link posted? complicated you? need take slowly? rate hospitalizations overall still 4.6 people per 100k, patients 65 representing vast majority number. far cry assertion ‚Äògood portion those‚Äô 50 end hospitalized.

The rate hospitalization first person country hospitalized 1 328 million. know disease spread hospitalization rates work? cases have, hospitalizations have, numerator continues go up. said good portion require excess medical care. denying that, got head keep thinking you‚Äôre smartest guy room, us keep laughing you.

I'm perfectly fine idiots like laughing me. Recognize quick &amp; dirty 'herd immunity' calculation, healthcare system would overrun, would likely overshoot vulnerable populations. 

If want different calculation US herd immunity deaths, I'd love see it. also help most, developed nations, form public health care would face costs many people needing hospitalization. actually saves governments money keep people hospital combating virus. America, privately profited industry quite well new (and upcoming) hospitalizations $$$. government pay these, really care much. antibody tests 100% reported specificity.
Here list tests posted plenty specificity. need start putting date title these, since lately daily event. I'm legit scared I'll right. Fuck... Yep, heard said, help think sure ""getting over.""

Guess right. every business closed except deemed essential. That's pretty big difference day day.  wee bit lol. see  possibility considered.

I reflecting three options:

* Either inaccurate report, something lost translation, literally figuratively; Possibly even deliberate deception demand help
* maybe common cold coronaviruses convey small degree actual immunity, people never gotten them. We've found cross-reactive antibodies.

But US absolutely caught anything like cases. worldwide includes lot countries like Brazil, Iran India along European countries hit testing capacity increased. look figures countries testing capacity much greater relative outbreak - Israel, Australia, New Zealand, etc. - much lower CFRs. Kemp said gonna blow government regulations load illegals take back himself. blow Covid shit? Hey uhhhh us hosers get early access still queen canuck bucks? Poor children's. horrible thing üòì sounds like kind news provider would Idiocracy replacement New York Times something. got fucking ticket forgetting move car weekly street sweeping 6am monday morning. 

They sure hell give tickets masks, get away shit. THATS ENOUGH GOVERNOR. expected see spike new cases following protests. surprise? amount people see hear parroting ""well course there's cases testing people"" fucking shit morons thats point testing find bad spread needs done. disease disappear test grows uncontrolled becomes disaster. exactly fucking happening. focused isolation mass testing financially supporting right people back February probably could done free bullshit nope 31.0 minute delay fetching comments.

I swear politics like watching tmz.

Next water plants Gatorade. Solve world hunger. also shares way much information everyone I'm NJ, far NYC.

Today took drive, done many times since start pandemic. drove beach. get car, purely get house still avoiding people.

It shit show today. Traffic backed seemed like miles. Every beach packed people NJ/NY. restaurants filled whatever capacity allowed (it could outdoor, could sworn saw people dining inside).

I fear whatever progress made previous month completely lost coming weeks. disheartening. 

The good thing saw people seemed wearing masks, really think enough. LoL! Someone needs IKEA style illustration this. funny see Brazilians try outdo us. one outdoes US steal-from-the-poor-give-to-the-rich project three steps least...

Step 1. Announce $660,000,000,000 bailout small businesses using taxpayer money.

Step 2. Fire inspector generals.

Step 3. Make rain. Thanks, we'll call ""vector"". Saw earlier Houston, Texas ICU's max capacity (Guess yesterday hit 100%). Protesting groups hundreds thousands doesnt help all. Especially shoulder shoulder shouting line police also shoulder shoulder. Well aren‚Äôt all. Milestone whatever Foothill people packed chairs touching back back mask sight. Scout‚Äôs thing, friend mine went walked right back seeing employees wearing masks. time, using much forceful language, saying wear mask whenever public.¬†

Okay wear masks. Jacksonville unfortunately. know, place we‚Äôre holding RNC August. 


We‚Äôre doomed. another post today England that, doctors say treatment evolved considerably. giving hydroxychloroquine, they're putting patients prone position, ventilating aggressively, they're giving patients blood thinners cortisone among measures. Sams Club fountain machines months sucks camel dicks! Americans go celebrate 4th. infections coming worse it‚Äôs plus plus ones starting protests.  That‚Äôs insane I‚Äôm Mar Vista stop going walks neighborhood many people without masks walking within 2 feet stroller, talking, laughing, one even coughed! three year old actually likes wearing mask (he knows take off) woman stopped said ‚Äúsick‚Äù making wear one I‚Äôm worried covid stay inside. drove house Centinela counted 22 people five minutes - one wearing mask. 

How different us? Also, hi neighbor :) Ooh, Mint class. nice way go cross-country. Good luck enforcing edict, law.... Here‚Äôs Western Australia got top it. 
1. Close borders. interstate visitors. 
2. Anyone returning state overseas spend 2 weeks forced quarantine particular hotel. 
3. Schools stayed open. 
4. gatherings larger 2 people outside household. 
5. Test anyone high temperature symptoms. 
6. Stopped travel regions cops roads turning people back. (WA larger countries; various regions could visited left.)
7. Wait.

The [current looking good we‚Äôre point everything less [open back we‚Äôll keep borders closed (although inter-regional borders open now). Except can‚Äôt move moment. Aussies immediate families come in. never stop gathering safety-related data, even vaccine drug released. effectiveness studies distinguish phase 3 phase 1, focused safety dosage. Found Taking bets r/wallstreetbets I'm Canadian know Americans charged Trump mass murder jack squat saving peoples lives. guy removed office get someone actually something. Yeah I'm pretty terrified lasting damage done people who've recovered effects dont know yet side things. back april luckily recovered little worried couldve possibly done dont know yet Everyone arguing circles hospitalisation rate % cases detected changes drastically depending proportion infected people don‚Äôt get tested. Israel, anyone cold-like symptoms gets swabbed (I think) catching almost symptomatic cases. 

The problem comes people try ‚Äúdouble apply‚Äù correction factors e.g. use low hospitalisation rate country excellent testing apply country poor testing, say since 1 10 cases even confirmed, hospitalisation rate divided 10. problem. Happy help. used throw too. know really bothers (among everything else)? brain drain health care system. health care professionals dying Covid took years train. NYC months ago.

Not gonna lie. didn‚Äôt like mask ended making using pattern NY Times. I‚Äôve made us friends quite few. it‚Äôs summer, it‚Äôs nice fresh mask put every day. Plus lot mask research would medical professionals, handling sick people trying get sick themselves. N95 makes sense. touch face makes sense. 


For general public, staying home, wearing mask spew over, 6ft rules, sanitizing inanimate objects, washing sanitizing hands, etc... everyone wearing mask another brick wall actions prevent spread.

Sure bricks may weaker others, stronger, leaving one leaves gaping hole wall. Hopefully bricks strong enough job without fail, one 0% effectiveness. think got it. mean, evidence place.  *gives 2020 bird* Jail thinking "" 15 people going zero quickly"" many deaths ? guess necessarily. People catch quicker. I‚Äôve got raging clue right guyss. thank cutting gutting funding public education States. Oh, idiots choose reject science. It‚Äôs shame census year next year. think missing point bit. Even best health care, people die deaths increase rising cases. Iran good comparison understanding lag rise cases deaths. US better healthcare, might change steepness rise. deaths US falling moment? good job controlling spread month ago transmissions occurred. month since clearly good. rights....... probably viral load average much lower summer. Expect death numbers rise temperatures drop. No. 2-11 days 5 median first symptoms last study saw. think instead takes two weeks people get sick enough need medical intervention. sounds like antiviral vaccine. 

Vaccines supposed prevent infection happening first place. can‚Äôt givn something people nothing greater good. That‚Äôs socalism *rolls eyes* posted article CBS May 4th stated would 3k deaths daily early June. took sub said 2 months old. find odd can't post older conflicting arguments here. hate sub. hate fighting can't stop watch play out. think bc bottle much irl.

I think half ppl understand long 'cases skyrocketing' headlines going on. 


I love country, huge issues born raised soil. want run ground. goalposts keep moving ppl keep freaking never going happen.... article.... September? much want agree see happening. American politicians selfish sacrifice economy much, fiasco first 'lockdown' US even economy take serious lockdown anymore. countries effectively beaten virus economical buffer make efficient lockdown possible. US country collect spend never social system made buffer possible. way US could would federal economy would sacrificed safe human lives, people like Trump followers charge never happen. live San Angelo (W. Texas), would say less 10% people wear masks. Bars // restaurants packed. Ita crazy Glendale here. job literally giving masks visitors still won‚Äôt wear them. Right. Govt body‚Äôs stated avoid beach, covid. govt body‚Äôs said protest ok outside mask. see outside without mask. protesters shoulder shoulder. I‚Äôm going trust eyes one. Stop thinking, use brain Think closer 1 - 5%. Still lot though. So, get exempt wearing face mask then? Anybody know? Covid likes this. stop acting like entire US. easily see 95+% people wearing masks stores Philadelphia That‚Äôs putting nicely. suck remembering details hospitals work. Forgive details wrong.

They're using non-insentive care doctors/nurses 4-year med students. hospitals going try stretch limits whatever healthcare workers get, even care optimal. recall mentioning flying staff in. surprise though. Except actual mortality close 0,35% number unknown infections high. question would handle situation feel like jerk. office open come everyone voluntary basis believe managers want team start working office again. Due various chronical diseases considered high risk Covid19. Also 1,5 hrs work oneway public transport. numbers cases seem ""under control"" (Germany) still feel safe tbh. Working home since March 13 now. firm created Covid19 guidelines clearly says ""People high risk work home notice allowed come all"" yet managers recently snapped told come in, saying ""I care guidelines, need keep business running"". know health. colleague healthy comes week catch us moans feels treated unfair. choose health problems. feel super pressured team come day according guidelines 1. even allowed 2. feel like risk it. vacation 3 weeks (at home course) know anything changed assuming still - would go would try speak yourself? Why? have. idiot Walmart special rope weekend ü•¥ :(

why idiotic? wannabe like trump? bet mum wishes redone things busy counting money, middle class got destroyed, upper class well. I'm picturing judge Judy chewing lol Yes.look kurzgesagt video discussing it.it visual guide help better understand mean. permanent lung damages large part already quite unhealthy population... Yeah, mean feel bad, always second wave. We're still this? ‚ÄúMission accomplished‚Äù estimated flu season killed 62000 people US no, huge number. Absolutely came conclusion, too. can't understand could face national security concerns reported germophobia. Wonder get someone take bet?

But bragging like chloroquine? Hmmmm... See guys tomorrow. Another day, another record reached. bit messed up.

Not guy, don't. may legal state level, still illegal federal level. guess what? supremacy clause thing, meaning federal law takes precedence local state State police can't give shit follow state laws.

No, choose forward case information federal law enforcement. prosecute Federal police could still fuck shit though.

Yeah, illegal. Federally. New Yorker saw worst state coming side, seeing rest county follow mind blowing. job gone another 2 months longer. know countless people lost relatives. MONTHS warning signs yet dumbfounded happened? Seriously! Thanks making sure south keeps joke world. loud fat dumb American still going strong. really get Internet stop watching mainstream media much surprise. That's expected. many need people start taking seriously? choice social distancing freedom, choice social distancing mass death. antibacterials/antibiotics aimed covid-19 ""it"" secondary infections virus SARS-COV-2-virus.

And agree second method SARS-COV-2-virus spreading really scary also explain virus spread fast different parts body much damage ply much havoc bodys functions. Real number 100k. video, also cop  That's sub shit, can't talk shit happening. virus nature, response p*litical. Haha ..where protestors people knowledge social reach warn everyone dangers early on,

He warned us years leading it. I'd say everyone world warning us dangers novel coronavirus, right top. Whilst countries three digit new cases , USA 5 digit deaths 

Crazy fucking Shit stop spamming link everywhere? peer reviewed yet. Without criticism peer-review, essentially someone's scientific fanfic. protests coincided states started reopening complicated question exactly causing increase. consistency regard protests, every state every state seeing increase, let alone skyrocketing amount. Minnesota protests started increase cases. New York massive protests handing virus still among strictest country cases small fraction were.

The biggest consistencies new outbreaks largely centering around south southwest, especially places hit badly start pandemic. guess would people much first hand experience taking seriously taking necessary precautions result (combined governments opening quickly), going take time experts comb data see exactly causing this. Brazil nuts good source selenium. Fish, shellfish, red meat, grains, eggs, chicken, liver, garlic also good sources. Meats produced animals ate grains plants found selenium-rich soil higher levels Brazilian nut familiar with, much help virus. Ah see thanks! healthcare worker know even harm kids? Lol u cunts. Blaming one guy hiding large societal arrogance &amp; retardism USA work. future too. World War II wasn‚Äôt fought US, course less 500K US deaths.

The vast majority 6M deaths took place countries France Russia, incredibly small area compared entire fucking world affected Coronavirus.

Auschwitz, again, wasn‚Äôt killing people around entire world way Coronavirus is.

The mortality Corona isn‚Äôt shit compared incredibly specific samples. ‚ÄúThis world wide disease killed almost half people one place 80 years ago. ScArEd Yet!??!?! 0.o0o0‚Äù

Fuck sensationalism. Oh boy already imagine anti-vaxxers saying ""see?? Bill gates trying take FREEDOM away!"" would guess already reached number. Listening public health officials lead shutting protests. got called China worst country ever it. winning people remember, study also absolutely drowned viral load far beyond person could ever expect reasonably get dosed Yep. Also reduced testing testing centres might open weekends. see pattern many countries worldometer; daily positives go Sundays Mondays due reduced testing. Well look you‚Äôre saying. breath you‚Äôre saying large gatherings, businesses re-opening horrible, terrible, lead people dying. 

While time declaring large scale violent riots, people extremely close proximity, often exchanging bodily fluids spit, sweat blood concern.

Well it? I‚Äôm honest sounds like lot people want businesses shut economy crash time encouraging violent mobs descend major cities.

It‚Äôs really difficult read lines want. Economic collapse anarchy. mean, honest point. data? Singing chanting wearing mask won‚Äôt lead spread. Naw. 

lemme guess, conveniently ignore amount deaths nyc could prevented stuffing Covid patients elderly homes, thumb nose governors certain party. 

You listen ‚Äúscience‚Äù like ‚Äúhealth experts‚Äù said ‚Äúsocial justice important Covid‚Äù.

Science data. Sure. We'll keep 36 kids classroom 6 feet apart keep teenagers getting close other. Easy peasy. hey Grim Reaper guy warning them

and ignored laughed Remindme! July 5 2020 Hey, theres good idea, maybe spread word Good luck finding story Fox News. Fresno County too. week we‚Äôve set daily records 2 3 times. Everyone thinks it‚Äôs over. We‚Äôre screwed.   It‚Äôs [17 growing. Dude I‚Äôm saying economies can‚Äôt survive without US travel. I‚Äôm literally saying idea Americans don‚Äôt travel isn‚Äôt true. Americans even want anything would mitigate risk children literally shot death schools. would take precautions this? Can't wait tomorrow's headline, "" US reports record jump coronavirus cases ~~third~~ fourth straight day"" that‚Äôs sad, 2000 people going die, today, america sorely needs leadership  I‚Äôve looking good science writer explain know crazy virus. Thank posting it. picture Ralph Wiggum saying this... No, couldn‚Äôt lucky. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre alive well. worries, didn't. I'm sorry stress must under. Nah. lack masks meat packing plant outbreaks. Amen Orly apps install? I've NOVID work half time restart bluetooth notify you. win? God might testing faith loyalty like Job. Holy shit Americans dumb üòÇ made stupid point that's easily proven wrong based common well documented history. switch personal attack based nothing (no personal avocation part) nothing trying save face. 

You talk tough guys can't even man admit wrong. thing Trump does, goes personal attack someone points mistake. like weak thing know projection. I‚Äôve lost faith country.

Hypothetically, it‚Äôd take end pandemic single press button, large portion country would refuse press principle ‚ÄúMUH freedom‚Äù Like packed indoor bars one wearing mask distancing people openly sharing drinks?

Edit: mostly see real benefit me, since leave house anything else work groceries 0.26 early may.

You're clearly comprehending well 0.4 excluding asymptomatic cdc estimate (not study). sure read notes lines chart. matter. 

And literally one thinks 5% fatality rate except trolls people reading comprehension,sometimes once. qualify. pointing everyone does. unemployment still around, supporting family $260 week quite challenge. Hopefully, I'll found job end July. I‚Äôve seen experts saying well. It‚Äôs acting like flu virus cycles regardless human behavior. It‚Äôs constantly present highly infectious virus. 

I don‚Äôt know try educate public distinction. seems like waste time. Parents need make sacrifice keep kids, themselves, rest society safe. idea district yet suspect teachers revolt try send us petri dish Apparently people get disease immune system mechanisms without time antibodies develop.
A vaccine likely 100% effective, case vaccines. good enough prevent infections lets hope 80% severe cases. edgy guy  do. hardly ever see someone without mask almost every establishment I've see said ""no mask, sale"" ""no mask, service"".

Covid-19 shorten anyone's life regardless age. gonna recover Covid-19. bring back field hospitals navy ships? That's totally suspicious all. Let ask something please answer honestly, would rather original SARS COVID19?

Severity illness little high transmission is. think meant pandemic severe global health concern SARS1 outbreak, correct, illness unequivocally less severe really even close. I'm laughing No, patient right refuse care given consentable/understand consequences decisions. Yes, they're still technically required public would say, stop think time vaccines comes going hard lessons learned change anti vaxxers minds. Half billion total worldwide COVID-19 deaths weekend. president, everyone would‚Äôve gotten mask March don‚Äôt wear it, it‚Äôs fine first offense jail time second Classic Jean Ralphio China, 1.4 billion people, 21 new cases.

People die natural causes, due respect lives finite expiration date. people dying mostly (if all) respective age expereration given US life expectancy rate, comorbidities. interacted self proclaimed Disney-philes, little culty I'd thought. Where‚Äôs failure? Trump‚Äôs unstated policy ignore it, get back work let kill may something someone, perhaps doctor place still respect science, finds way end it. 3 million Americans die meantime, it‚Äôs biggie. There‚Äôll 327 million survive. lot ones die old people color already health problems, cares anyway? we‚Äôre it, ask Supreme Court declare ACA unconstitutional insurance companies aren‚Äôt forced cover sorts people. Trump‚Äôs dead one else matters, where‚Äôs failure? God‚Äôs heaven all‚Äôs right world. happened Chinese lower class? Welded apartments? many businesses gone forever there. Actually, fair point.

Stay healthy :) Judges part legislative branch. don‚Äôt power pass laws. 

Only State Legislature power (during emergencies) governor. 17 Scotland deaths.  used think this....but cholestorol hit think really counts individualism though. think people behave society, there's nothing wrong competitive pay attention community around you. ... Worldometer? strong weekly trend. think confusing fir earlier spike. Fridays lot cases Mondays Sundays. Click box says 7-day rolling average smooth weekly variations. case interested topic, recommend Alfred McCoy ""In shadows american century"". book explains US lose power, kinda like UK probably three great powers future (China, US, Europe)

there also interesting topic US losing power status science leaders, US students go Wall Street dept money. enough willing work medium paid science job. foreign students return home country benefit society. It‚Äôs state propaganda owned China - nothing more.  War science like health experters saying fine giant protests? haven‚Äôt thought forever. this? many protests since start news them. protesting? Social distancing? bunker somewhere? send someone check them? Phase 2 reopening never happened. Frankly, stage 1.1 whatever made shit never happened either. supposed two week DECLINE cases moving new phase. Like, actual sustained two week decline. never met criteria that‚Äôs knew state doomed. Fox News says Coronavirus hoax......  Maybe we're much?  /sarcasm/ Ohh, close! Ran morning actually got another 2 litres. Cocktus that's case, *all* ""propaganda"" banned? careful, lot think ""news"" would also propaganda.

And respect article, wrong? forget trump cut funding testing, numbers next testing going on. numbers low enough that's bad. Switzerland (who one worst countries cases per capita beginning) we've stable 10-50 new cases day month now. Despite 94% wearing masks public transport. Mostly elderly otherwise compromised do. generally mandatory mask wearing except close proximity services like hairdressers. 

Not advocating masks all, saying people disciplined long enough get numbers low, getting lazy point necessarily disaster literally posted another teacher site Where‚Äôs source? saw e hospital issue? don‚Äôt remember people dying waiting rooms standing long lines Wuhan medical

It‚Äôs protests... exactly two weeks ago can‚Äôt help constituents ignorant assholes. know aren‚Äôt it.

I'm positive news? think there's whole bunch people going misread today's news. You‚Äôre absolutely right, isn‚Äôt coincidence states daily record highs positive tests carelessness open states. That‚Äôs states northeast seeing cases drop hospitalizations lower day. worry many trillions went Trump family friends. They'll set life!

Fuck Trump, fuck corporations, fuck rich controlling government. representation! biggest spikes cases following states prematurely ""opening up"" closely protests. Worded wrong. countries opened borders everyone else, America specific bans place poorly handled corona.  Must riots? ¬Ø\_( Õ†¬∞ Õü ñ ¬∞Õ† )_/¬Ø Saving lives enough get people wear masks. They're numbers them. needs promoted something relate with. Unfortunately you, good story - Vietnam keep streak near term, there'll books least one movie (perhaps one made West fill entire cast Brits Americans, extra irritation). rediscovered fallen love history buffs many decades now. 

It's kind platonic ideal neat narrative. already become legendary. [LA time's reporting tentacle Journal discussing coronavirus uses tentacles hijack two articles find discussing this.

But foreign holidays still option year don‚Äôt see english people would come larger numbers usual. I'm sorry, one coworkers chronic condition went get treatment wound catching corona hospital too. He's better thankfully scared while. hope friend makes full recovery.

In words priest, lot going take seriously one family members died. Amazingly, lot people exactly mentality. virus face undeniable proof do, pretend  exist. endlessly infuriating. little imagination, little compassion. careless actions could mean someone's serious illness death, hard least wear mask? Vietnam world example fighting virus. Congratulations. appreciate reading success stories don‚Äôt see bragging all. I'm afraid prediction 10.000 deaths Florida become reality. I'm not.

I'm realistically remembering outbreak state parents lost shit pulled school.

To point worry whether anyone show fall. constant calls coming already demanding permanent online year.

It big talk well dead bodies Facebook obituaries started flowing town.

STOP GOING BARS BEACHES!! Actually, get surgical masks online stores. ones can't get easily n95's. Surgical masks known quite effective, tested, unlike types home-made masks certainly effective degree properly tested yet. Surgical also breathable due special material use. TLDR: doctors use them.

Wear masks, please! wanna stay game! know point fingers anymore... like Spain, like 8 weeks. Mandatory masks seem great. Imagine people getting tested know many young people also call cold flu? Even someone 20s, actual flu sucks bad. ""Starting to""? Somewhat concerning already done that. really believe daily cases happening NY/NJ surging.

I thinking quarantine whole families one symptoms later, that's cool Ok divide conquer probably apply here, different groups people blaming certainly deflects blame directed means mortality rate 10 times lower virus burns faster 

Holding number deaths people symptoms constant, far cases great news Would curious see listing titles happened to. What's guess? Danielle Steele? Rich Dad, Poor Dad? Art Deal?

Course keeping distance.... central Florida. 1.4% (Infection Fatality Rate) * 328,200,000 (Population USA) = 4,594,800 (maximum estimated fatalities)

...presuming everyone USA gets infected Florida still 1300 ICU beds left.  close 10,000 cases per day good.

The emergency order super unpopular sides political spectrum everyone hated it, they're gonna decide everything's okay. assume I'm American insult U.S.. Everybody's allowed that! Yeah thinking exactly. Us Brits jump pretty decent ship say steering sinking one lunatic captain listens no-one. Less hundred people wearing mask, LA least 20 times amount people wearing mask protest Yep. lives now. You‚Äôve got real word heroes running Flu Study there. God bless ‚Äòem running testing samples FDA orders stop.

Yeah sure man Except protests socially distant! thousands people standing shoulder shoulder streets! 

The virus care cause large gathering. protests cause spread outside masks can't fans baseball soccer games? could easily limit occupancy make people sit 6 feet apart wear masks. large gatherings dangerous, protests? 

This even conservative liberal. Right left. thinking yourself. long people going try blame family bbq memorial day celebrating graduation skip protests thousands people standing next other?? 

2-3 weeks ago protests. record case numbers US. There's way something it. thing put place? wear masks carry on? lockdown hotspots fine, lockdown whole country disease put shame common flu embarrassing. sense smell return? show scientific data *proving without doubt* protests tied massive spike cases? think someone says protests tied spread, saying ""the protests *only reason* virus spreading""? one saying whatsoever. virus spiking multiple factors - idiots resisting mask mandates, idiots congregating large numbers beaches holidays, morons throwing private parties things easily celebrated pandemic, *and* people standing shoulder shoulder yelling chanting protests. 
 
In opinion anyone arguing protests nothing virus spike sounds exactly like someone yelling ""all lives matter"" response ""black lives matter"". painfully shortsighted offensive - proceeding abundance caution point time, fully support protests, people protesting daily need take care people around best isolate quarantine they've tested. Lol really miss area lived in. I'm looking forward going back winters. people generally suck experience. bothers news media call what‚Äôs happening spike- never went decline (except places)... quickly rose plateau, opened, quickly rising again. It‚Äôs spike, it‚Äôs sustained plateau rising much faster health care system possibly handle. happen?

It 1987, Oliver Stone released *Wall Street,* Michael Douglas delivered ""greed good"" speech, many people, politically conservative, took call action also entire philosophy.

Of course Gordon Gekko's ideas based horseshit like Ayn Rand's objectivism libertarianism general. turns give people excuse feel bad selfish asholes, many happily accept it. This. Watch wait. Highly-contagious respiratory diseases stay contained walking door every single day. course not. Shouting clever slogans spittle flying nothing. older population Florida vs NY definitely concerning. wonder 70+ crowd taking better care avoid getting infected. sound it, looks like that's negative ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Abbott must follow Trump's lead deny existence coronavirus. 

So mandatory masks public, social distancing, quarantining, contact tracing, even though necessary control/limit infections. 

As result, Texans suffer far higher levels unemployment, hospitalization, deaths otherwise would have.

People worry elections trump sorts shit doesnt matter. local state government influence lot influence you. That's one reason whole ""America bad ____"" comments ridiculous. America like EU states individual countries. things affected state state, kind like pot legal states. Well technically Fed says illegal supersedes state law. big deal they're going anything it. Kind one perks America cases. bad too. Like gays marriage rights 50 states Fed came it. Honestly marriage government nothing anyway really. able fuck woods say man wife man man wife wife fuck need give court 20 bucks married? love fuck off! Eastern European countries (especially Slovakia) also great job masks case numbers reflect like people call wars Northern Ireland ""The Troubles."" drink home. me. don‚Äôt know much Cambodia, imagine culture shock would lot move there.

Conservatism goes beyond politics. Many people we're talking never voted never will. ways aim conservation social attitudes besides political.

Out curiosity, assess purity comment? Thanks, statement correct. Like said, willfully ignorant. Everyone bubble stays bubble. leave, wait quarantine get back in. 

Regarless, missing point response. want debate whether NBA resume, fine. valid arguments sides debate. 

What said dangerous stupid. basically pro-Trump.

That's delusional false-equivalency. friends worked medical systems. lot systems horrifically unstable. chalk malice rather incompetence part system designer. According IHME projections UK peaked 100,000 actual infections per day seems cases missed reflected death total. Florida testing better UK late March. sharp increase concerning I'd careful comparing confirmed infections 3 months ago now. go, staff quarantined tested daily. waiting for? hurricane wash away? made realize weak many people are. can't bothered wear mask hour go shop caus much discomfort, accomplish anything life? Really? depressing. bulk progress U.S. carried minority people drag rest people kicking screaming. Wait forget studies efficacy masks. Im way pro trump, someone works medical field Canada.

Here's something chew on, surgical masks see everyone wearing designed ""clean rooms/operating rooms"", basically sanitized environment minimum bacteria germs protect exposure patient operated on. surgical mask use covid virus, anything, prolonged use created unhygenic setup. typical symptoms (a severe sore throat followed persistent fever chest discomfort) also experienced pretty serious brain fog confusion/forgetfulness month, weird ‚Äúfloaty head‚Äù feeling occasional dizziness. was...unpleasant. mean. New York cities northeast. headlines fucking stupid. would point reopening business  Maybe ten thousand Tuesday then. Pretty much putting pebbles front waterfall point. wearing mask indoor locations middle pandemic causes rates infections rise? Colour shocked Also, UK peak, already anti-spread measures, Florida still seems complete denial, could easily see half million deaths Florida alone keep things open couple weeks. I‚Äôm sure part think funny. What's point? Pop density? reason shut shut up. Honestly tired comments. Bold assume anywhere shut again. really hope don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs super likely Countries really starting making laws stuff. Yeah definitely contributed, way didn‚Äôt. Like said earlier, wouldn‚Äôt NY, much densely populated, similar spikes?! They‚Äôve protesting too. sure ‚Äúmuh freedom‚Äù lol people quick blame protestors.  Sure that's ""millennials"" Florida? lot boomers know Florida also going 0 precautions. think Florida thing... Literally *and* metaphorically, alcohol works best get rid Sharpie stains. people also realize person's personal liberties end begin infringe others' rights. liberty say want, mean follow someone around 24h hours day scream ear. 

This things like smoking regulations perfectly constitutional. want smoke, OK, forced restrict smokers filling every bar, restaurant enclosed space carcinogens. 

Mask deniers thing, except virus particles, risking others' lives health entire economy avoid minor personal inconvenience. would like get drunk dive. see issue it. That's thing always bugged me. Jesus was, accounts, exemplary individual preached empathy compassion.

I'd check that. bp low high cause dizziness live California. boss flying Florida weekend visit elderly parents ‚Äúget beach time.‚Äù doesn‚Äôt wear masks believe virus ‚Äúoverblown‚Äù ‚Äúnot big deal‚Äù. fully expecting get sick him. unfortunate truth lot people won‚Äôt think take whatever stance media choice feeds them. Maybe finally kill mouse.

...haha jk obviously. They‚Äôll make emotionally exploitative movies power love overcome covid-19 bring us together everyone run movies see it. It‚Äôs 60/40 mask compliance people age (millennial) downtown Philly. lot people think outside means mask isn‚Äôt necessary. Since Tea-Party 2008. EU ban US citizens entering europe remainder 2020, covid response pathetic. 

Stay Europe, welcome. early say, varies lot North higher, though IIRC less 50%. Italian Red Cross process conducting massive study scientific sample 150,000 people see antibody situation is. However likely quite far herd immunity (if indeed immunity virus). We'll see results study, would interesting Greg Abbott model governor pandemic. get days :) 

And ya. Clearly don‚Äôt understand exponential growth parabolic growth think mitigating one source important. Ro virus. infectivity. transmission works. analogy might worst thing i‚Äôve ever heard. 

Let make something clear. 


Stopping. Every. Point. Of. Transmission. Is. Vital. 



have good day. What's secret success? think/feel whole rushed reopening thing last near last effort avoid major economic scuttle, scales. would seem many people care much money health. (No, well person, monetarily speaking) Seriously, can't believe there's still people think nothing flu.

My 83 year old grandmother living almost independently month ago fall caused taken hospital decided required 24/7 care due dementia moved assessment center see whether safe go back home not. due moved care facility requested tested COVID (She tested negative coming hospital). Unexpectedly week ago got results back positive showing symptoms all. week gone relatively fit age unable even sit bed, every breath struggle riddled pneumonia there's nothing done her. morning longer responsive, cold touch look like got long left. 

Fuck disease, seriously. deserve go like this. That's Asian discipline American argue ""it's right"". typical American traits Karen. I'm generalizing btw Japan shutdowns... 

Taiwan, Vietnam, South Korea much better job Japan. Japan heavily criticized initial response take appropriate measures. well! &lt;3 Worked ER years. 0 weed-related injuries/accidents. Many drunk drivers, drunk fighters, drunk people tripped hurt themselves, drunk people played fireworks wrong hurt themselves. Probably suscetible low immunity already contracted diseased 100% ^ Americans fat theyre good disciplined noon tea lot ya second time county reddit since virus began. shocked saw lol. 

Jefferson county huge shit show. many people believe virus isn‚Äôt real. mandatory mask order 30th people standing doors restaurants stores screaming rights denied entrance. want leave US never come back. imagine probably people legitimate concern wearing facial covering medical reasons. can't imagine reason would I'm sure probably exist. imagine people far though legitimate gluten allergies. NBA set restart Orlando, can't see anything going wrong that! Italy Italians one hell great job handling virus. Considering one first countries get hit hard things here, countries followed example things could really different many part world now.  I've felt while. Modern internet social media made easy person consume output political content. often thought engagement better, we're sadly dragging ignorant incompetent people complex debates. One time asked one friends going play Super Bowl year said Jets Patriots. know anything football know that's literally impossible. That's problem we're political social discussions. large part population idea make arguments digest factual information. idea facts are. right...how else would describe it? ‚ÄúAnd so, fellow Americans: ask country ‚Äî ask country.‚Äù align statement Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, head WHO‚Äôs emerging diseases zoonosis *‚ÄúWe number reports countries detailed contact tracing,‚Äù Van Kerkhove continued. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre following asymptomatic cases.

I'd hardly characterize 100%. freedom harm others. selfishness cruelty. aren‚Äôt like this. Northeast handling kid gloves him? What‚Äôs got gets pass? socializing mar lago stays golf trips?

Most bailouts loans grants payroll. 

Why would rather industry cost billions tax payer money like USPS instead self sustaining one low margin profit brings hundreds billions economy? fool think chinese politicians bunch power hungry asswipes, wrong. chinese politicians strive make country better even backs SE-Asian african countries.

Thats founder proud boys it. Oh happened MD guy? Concerned Marylander Holy crap, that‚Äôs comedy bit right there. It‚Äôs ok stand outside mass protests 8 hours straight, also includes drinking, eating, using public restrooms 500 strangers. family get together, outside, 20 people, evil. totally got Kansas City, know would start ""City of"", guess use state name followed ""city"" might referring city within state? something like ""A California city"" even case think capitalization City makes clear referring Kansas City, random city Kansas. also remembered weird Kansas City existing Kansas Missouri flying airport :) People started focusing increasing case numbers there, happens.

Due lot overtime last year, broke 100k first time. based 2018 income, would gotten check. partner makes ~25k/year. get check, did. married, we'd gotten double amount since we'd 150k combined.

The way figure stupid relies idea everyone wants get married fast. probably safer right now. says least 20 inmates staff dead far. Big if. Gigantic if. Huuuuge if. 50 million people died that. said back March, Fauci urging people start wearing masks, question ""How help presidents reelection chances""? human think people die better chances winning reelection?? Makes sense all. Sure hell does, beginning disqualified Maryland even though hours cut half, got nothing. completely furloughed call get put back unemployment. 

Maybe states different Maryland told go fuck myself. Life cocktail party streets Wonder [Google many dum dums Yeah read somewhere designed small homes stackable fit least 3 average 2 bedroom (US) apartment. exactly happened. tried juke around original fines declaration saying ""oh wanted fine businesses instead, that's legal, even though provide guidance first time around."" Thus, judges Texas allowed begin cracking down. Judge Hidalgo Houston even tried come preventative measures cancelled first time. Absolutely not. I'm saying countries got wrong even worse USA various ways, yet never ever EVER hear loud people complain them. talk USA one fighting thing failed epic scale, insanely far truth. seriously, someone wear mask think they're worthy life?

Since February: Total cases: 240,136 total deaths: 34,716, total recoveries: 188,584

I keep updating good news milestones reached rather everyday keep attention higher everyday getting better better although occasional clusters far however contained. would make sense ban travel problematic countries point think. 

Several regions reported **zero** new cases: Campania, Puglia, Friuli, Abruzzo, Umbria, Aosta Valley, Molise, Basilicata.

Next milestones plausibly reached: 0 ICUs, less 1,000 hospitalized, 0 deaths. think eliminated completely numbers high, optimistic go 10,000 active cases reach 0 several regions South. really wish countries took notes. dont disagree. Personally think Southern states closed early. staggering closures more. RemindMe! 7 days sarcasm, cause people aren‚Äôt going even reopening cases still rising dramatically places like California.

SoI Covid-19 usually severe extreme, SoI first SARS was. However, due much higher transmissibility Covid-19, severity *of pandemic* much higher SARS.

There's sweet spot diseases mortality low enough keep outbreak fueled without burning out. Ebola severe illness SARS, SARS killed more. SARS severe illness Covid-19, Covid-19 killed more.

Thus, ""less severe"" bit misnomer, we're discussing pandemic (which severe) illness (which less severe). call pop soda.

Thank you, sincerely, advocate Reason. everyone become infected get tested. factor 10x seems little ridiculous though. R u overweight neckbeard reddit addict tho Yeah, I'm still sure believe IFR numbers bandied about, since seem assume huge numbers undetected cases. may well case US, numbers hard square experiences places like South Korea, CFR 2.2% - also positive test result rate 1% - every positive test result get 99 negative ones.

I see reconcile ""there huge numbers undetected infections"" theory. Early on, people theorizing 50% cases might asymptomatic subclinical extent simply noticed - buy that, since matches nicely difference observed CFR Korea US. keep seeing repeated pneumonia 'flu-like' deaths way year year bothers cant find source it. found first two sources third one new thanks looking. insinuating USA best overall response virus, thus far? think attributed article someone write it. garbage.

That‚Äôs one group/one sample many, could outlier, could false positive.

Gonna need draw conclusions.  Sooo, asked individuals large gatherings? Probably no. like media, go area, may offend BLM folks can't get sick god side. right. US ist absolutly clusterfucked. Perhaps, though wild mind focused deflecting blame virus. Russia‚Äôs interests pretty clear, it‚Äôs little harder figure what‚Äôs better China. weakened America best customer healthy shopping stuff made China. Education like vaccine. It‚Äôs bulletproof affects everyone differently still react badly it, enough people get (properly, mind you) account don‚Äôt react poorly without negatively impacting society. 

Too many people fall wagon, however, everyone suffers.

It‚Äôs painfully ironic education gets treat actual vaccines nutter groups. would funny weren‚Äôt fucking tragic.

Lots people wear masks Japan anyway, spread colds whatever i'm sure understand getting at. right swing fist ends nose.

Your right take precautions spreading virus ends infecting others. Japan community -- filled Japanese people.

The USA community, competing racial interests. lives matter smfh Lmao! metaphor exactly it. I‚Äôm surprised one bit. country individualistic people bunker care another. Obama, tbh. whole chunk people really came together 2nd term. Interestingly, scientists warn killer heat waves due climate change: high temperatures, combined high humidity, prevent humans cooling sweating kill even healthy adults. planet continues warm current levels next 50 years, 3 billion people could living areas hot humans.

This would come abruptly. would start tropical regions first vulnerable old people would die. Well, shit. know sorry generalization, crazy shit there. guess 37k/day Friday 4th Rest America here. Yes, know.. Americans entitled, all. 

It‚Äôs say doesn‚Äôt happen else where, does, seems Americans  put shame common flu; pay attention numbers?

12,000-61,000 flu deaths *a year*

120,000+ COVID-19 deaths *four months* , plus recovery period weeks *months*, possible repeat ER visits, blood clots, strokes, lung damage brain damage. local levels blue areas stronger response, governor really tried make able that. area mandatory mask rule now, stay home order many places did. I'm hoping put back place soon numbers going like rest state disconcerting. Yeah, live area (Southeast Texas). Everyone basically flat earther point. fight everywhere go. news articles virus get reposted/comments toxic mind rotting things ever read pretty consistently, Either its:

* ""Against constitution see far government push freedoms take away"" (all circle-jerking trump governor Jesus's answer sin earth)
* virus flu/a conspiracy/not even real government take away rights
* need open economy costs human life
* Masks literally anything sick stay home
* BS excuse ""break mask"" ""it's actually impossible breathe going die on"", completely outrageous claim. (As get extreme cases case, posts masse see around here) absolutely correct. reduced wages high qualify state unemployment, also denied federal funds. Idc people argue fact. It‚Äôs happened husband myself. weeks bring home short checks that‚Äôs still ‚Äútoo much money‚Äù qualify state federal unemployment. go gross, doesn‚Äôt factor taxes, insurance, 401k... fucking sucks. thought canceled oversee law order, bullshit. determined peaked already? Partly improved treatment, also transmission death often takes several weeks, deaths lag behind testing couple weeks. number cases started spiking past couple weeks, expect spike deaths follow. people thought Obama invading Texas b/c military practice exercises going on. state already multiple military bases. We're dealing top brass here. shoehorned argument. course always things go well, life. However, fact conveniently went right ignoring numerous positives States shows us unwilling incapable good faith discussions. bet latter. might well right. make predictions. death rate hospitalization rate virus incredibly low. mean, relatively so.

It ravaged old folks homes New York City first, think kind skewed everyone's perceptions.

Now, see scenario hospitals overrun death toll gets compounded everyone dies something else can't get help Covid? sure hell hope - absolutely possible. Wait till COVID19 reach elder population weeks.

It‚Äôs like tragedy foresee, can‚Äôt anything, Florida months today prevent upcoming tragedy. Exactly. America‚Äôs emphasis individualism versus collectivism detrimental pandemic. vaccine last resort solution isnt mandated theres literally point far hasnt, find utterly surprising ""This Thanksgiving, promise you""

- trump answer -- beginning 30 years passing Immigration Act 1965.

To state mother fucking obvious truth, sense obligation fellow man woman require consider part community. Exactly. Another bad sign can't give good reason conspiracy happening. ""It's election year country every country thinks joke"" explain worldwide pandemic, there's literally compelling reason proposed humanity's collective scientific body would agree lie shape planet, etc. Skepticism great comes rational place *actually* skepticism, ie sheep side. science shouldn‚Äôt funded companies vested interest suppressing findings harmful bottom line. It‚Äôs like fossil fuel companies funding climate change studies. They‚Äôve known years happening, suppressed information well. cigarette companies. need scientists funded, special interest. Death age group basically 55% 65 rest under, scary. worries, Florida flattened curve enough could ramp surge capacity refrigerator trucks. Everything going fine. well may be! still need finish red dead. There‚Äôs many games wanna play. thank god plenty time. try Minecraft dungeons gf! It‚Äôs nice easy dungeon crawler super fun play together. Stay safe friend! Thailand checking in. 58 deaths. 3168 infections, 51 still hospital, local transmission month think. imported cases quarantined government hotel, international arrivals 14 days. Masks. work. Population 70 mil, doorstep China. 51 people hospital right local transmission. fucking virus. I'm sure none could possibly protest related. Last two days Jefferson County Alabama (Birmingham) also double previous record quadruple high day day earlier last month. mighty fine coincidence 3 weeks protests. close eyes stop recording cases, suicide rates disappear. Well obviously. 

But virus deadly significant enough justify making people stay home it.

There far important things concerned corona. hypothetically nazi here, nazis. went Japan vacation last year. tons people wearing masks. already part culture coronavirus ever existed. angry basically every person charge Texas happy open up, letter amazing. I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs picking idiots. probably call Dr. Asking us earn confusion. 

Here‚Äôs things I‚Äôd right away. Get enough food water. Take normal medications prescribed. Buy blood ox meter. They‚Äôre like $50 lot people decompensate rapidly falling O2. call Dr. adverse effects could serious. you‚Äôll never know asking bunch keyboard jockeys. Well guess we're insane literally giving 20% effective. someone struggling conservative media driven cognitive decline father, feel pain.

Mine become incapable noting logical inconsistencies arguments consistently interjecting political non-sequitors convresations. can't talk anymore. minute half phone call Father's day, spoken since. indiscretion, go Spain? mean propaganda certain wing? Fucking rediculous. then, outcry conservative protests spreading virus month two ago? long ""everyone wear masks"" period, someone makes argument. reasonable person trust narratives change every passing day? Yup work.  vaccine. 99% population still get virus probably ""This large gathering causing infections, one"" ""Don't want give money refuse work"" tell bar staff laid TX FL. I've trying find new job get away death trap restaurant decent jobs Even amongst young people now, I‚Äôm assuming many still jobs, nursing homes, grocery stores, etc. asymptomatic minimally symptomatic, disease pervasive, suspect end spreading older folks. think combination of: Timing strictness lockdown, total travel ban (you could leave town basically two months) mandatory masks everywhere (still now) Lombardy even walking streets. make example, restaurants delivery three months (not even carry-out).

Also, interesting heat factors: AC Italy, least houses, extensively used compared US, might also play role. friends working teachers, final high school exams (oral questions) held persons sorts precautions. Schools \*banned\* turn AC (could open windows). Florida, bars AC etc. showed problem.

Finally, super high level compliance mask wearing similar far. MN, gov Walz kickass job (in March) explaining this. like 285 U beds WHOLE STATE, clumped Minneapolis Rochester. goes show need pump 1100, need be. Okay proud Viking warrior bow anybody (except virus get it), wearing mask public places really hard? He'll bestow certificate pardon everyone cronies first gets booted out.. Lmfao good 1 go everyday. job to. Im really worried concerned. part wear mask stay away crowds. bad yettt. Unlike new york dont throw sick nursing homes related. actually helping spread sickness social group, causing damage others believe mask fact. nothing de-humanizing another group, humans intellectual level humans group, that‚Äôs fact. False exactly it. many people, freedom means they're free whatever want, shoot guns, drill oil, whatever. real freedom others' freedom shot ha sing toxic waste pumped rivers. Makes furious many conflicting messages masks early even half population uproar wearing them. Worst, Leadership, Ever. Two questions:

First question is, deaths start go back up? I‚Äôm thinking next week see increase one, deaths continue drop , would able stay open.

Second question: states go lockdown again, specifically whole US? seeing increases states reopened, probably also see surges northeast follow trend south. I‚Äôm saying certain states starting get control seems things continue like another week, states forced go lockdown again. Check Taiwan son lives there, built mask factory, wear masks, businesses shut down...common sense realize TX Lt. Governor Dan Patrick said something stupid like, ""some things important living,"" right? plan always put economy lives. Lol.

Bullshit.

KY 900 pneumonia deaths month February previous five years average month. means go back 3 4 weeks.

Wait 2 weeks working well y'all bumped bit, eh? call them, Maryland go gross income week. care ask many hours work, ask much make. 

If make certain number qualify, get cares bonus qualify atleast $1 unemployment. 

Feel free look mdunemployment subreddit think bullshit. Japan shut down. dumb fuck lmao elderly death toll exclusive Sweden.

If systematic issue this, investigated properly pass judgement carried out. Maybe minor effect. fear may scary scenario Florida. Apocalyptic, even. California huge hot spot new cases doesn‚Äôt make news often cause goes narrative red-states mask = explosion cases. chief economic advisor Kudlow said absolutely stimulus, lockdown economy fine get back work.

He also said one pressers past week there's going another stimulus lockdown amount ignorance blatant hatred astounding right wing ruined country. crazy use word ""outbreak"" everything. wake hear there's ""outbreak"" turns 5 people restaurant asymptomatic.  medium.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Think moment type people toxic, red hat wearing conspiracy addicts would spend long periods time indoors with. Yeah, others like them, ones stand other. Dallas beginning June. can't tell disconcerting coming LA, mask use social distancing followed 95% compliance.. city see one single mask worn, except servers restaurants. felt like Dallas pretending pandemic never happened.. glad days prior massive spike seeing now. feel pain frustration - country whole handled situation much grace bull china shop. Remember videos people China collapsing, unconscious, grocery shopping standing guard? New York patient dismissed ER collapsed crossing street leaving hospital. scenario plausible. So, Miami-Dade 1/3 FLs total recent daily deaths? Yeah, appreciate effort. never thought I'd agree Dick Cheney anything. Good contradicting sociopath white house. 

It raise question, using toxic masculinity fight toxic masculinity less toxic? know. know joke obesity worldwide problem. one densely populated countries planet makes success even exceptional. Yes also outbreaks somehow good news.

Before (like 2 weeks ago) community transmission areas still apprently diffuse cases unrelated. speaking general virus still circulating.
Now start identifying specific outbreaks new cases traceable outbreaks.

That new situation italy borders reopened likely local outbreaks normal. already got imported positives countries.

It important able contain outbreaks test system soon possible. don‚Äôt understand people claim freedom can‚Äôt infringed mine due refusal take simple accessible measures. can‚Äôt go anywhere anything actions supposedly exercising freedom... costs everyone else theirs. ‚ÄúI honestly think time medical community could care less profits.‚Äù

Cmon buddy can‚Äôt na√Øve. coworker says Bill caused virus!! someone NY currently living MA, I'm afraid Florida may worse either two states. took almost entire month start lockdown cases started come states. obligations people? first I've heard it. Thank god never left house even this.  people follow laws? get it. requiring requesting mask usage different societal norms, laws, regs getting along society? friends took trip Boston day noticed majority people wearing masks taking necessary precautions. citizens NJ hand great job numbers solid far we‚Äôll wait see recommend work office take transit company wide work home 2 days. literally hand free everyday. pandemic see gets weird, number, take total daily reported subtract previous day. 

But one histograms daily counts, reports slightly higher number. Article says nothing millennials. source statement? years glasses anti glare coatings never issue, every source find online says detergent right thing use regular coated lenses. Guidance avoid windex, vinegar harsher cleaners.

For example following many guides less, outbreak small enough, masks distance perfect. That's there's small transmission Korea, despite good mask compliance.

If outbreak large, need shutdown stay-at-home - greatly increase distancing effect, removing possible contact entirely. That's Europe learned China, got outbreaks largely control. school [here canceled Chinese New Year events due coronavirus concerns **January 25th.** think saying believe protesting cause continue virtue signal. might well homeschool year... see clearly object 2-3 meters away me. need stay one place (travelling public transport) shopping supermaket/groceries/pharmacy, ok. One friends works ER said wipes help prevent fogging. sure get them.

Chinese numbers made up. prep work job glasses fog like crazy sometimes I'm holding knife. still gonna wear mask regardless.

Counts areas marches impacted. ask information. ban fascination irrelevant. mitigating every point transmission vital. learned nothing infectivity this. growth exponential. every person infected doesn‚Äôt social distance isolate contribute.  know true certain classes programs, people proposing universities teach classes online indefinitely. makes sense fall semester, least.

Test counted hence skyrocketing test numbers, many larger employers require 2 double negatives go back work, person could test multiple times weeks time new test, even neighbor said people tested 13 times counted 13 positives till double negative happens. lots people general tested get negative work. people testing positive, next month like May negative, come June positive marked new case time. Imagine over. 

I someone moron neighborhoods app say friends told hospitals (I'm Broward) overwhelmed looking add icu units. I'm like friends, tin foil hat wearers? He's like friends work Borward, Holy etc. text cousin whose ER neighbor whose nurse also there, complete bs lol. Reminds Delray got reported like multiple floors Covid patients ventilators used, uncle whose ER physician like even 1/4 true accurate. that's fake news starts going viral media picks people take thinking end world. 

Plus counting beds stupid stats, notice never saying actual 'covid' patients, media making seem like 70%+ capacity covid, lol, even remotley close let alone inaccurate reporting been. Hospitals generally always operate capacity, didn't, they'd hemmorage even money (or borderline majority). hospitals overwhelmed entire time regardless media made be, hell furloughing employees left right private elective surgery spots either. 

Now talks actually adding icu talked long time part true, even started know Boca wanted previously know board members there. simple adding icu units icu floor sections. talking building additions $$$$ anything medical related construction cluster fuck getting approved work.

Even gym, I'm 38 there's larger amount 50-70+ year olds LA I'm there. wear mask pulling lifting weights, pull back walking around next spot cleaning equipment disinfectant spray well. People general pretty good procedures now. Every machine wrapped blocked also. awfully convenient scapegoat bars restaurants especially since many closed places like Philly. massive gatherings a-okay you! gonna lie, that's window soon drink morning coffee eat something, matter fresh mouth it. still wear mask breathe nose anyway. I'm thinking it'll 4-8 weeks deaths, possibly. first cases going younger people, it'll take weeks spread older vulnerable people, week get symptoms, another week get bad enough hospital, weeks dying.

But big percentage before. rate death dependent age co-morbidities ages least trending younger overall infected. effective treatments two three months ago. post survey Europe found hospitalized people four times less likely die months ago due better treatments earlier testing. possible. Protests combined quarantine fatigue perhaps. surge FL order magnitude worse expect. Lol thanks made pothead teenager. I‚Äôm pothead adult Apparently pretty dumb. $1.4 billion 0.3% overall relief. That‚Äôs negligence. That‚Äôs surprising success given failure rate means testing aid.

I‚Äôd happy .3% margin error means people actually get money. real problem living need stimulus haven‚Äôt gotten it. 

We need strip means testing fix problems back end. leaning towards violet. ""I want now!"" think it‚Äôs logical cry ‚Äûlaw order‚Äú time ignore law order maybe that‚Äôs me... present exhibit far I've seen 2 people wear masks. know get myself. agree i'm sure say begin with, friend.  bad America way compel idiots things.  was. old issue now. seatbelt protects wearer. (non medical) mask protects others, wearer. still giving guy platform? Oh, insane amount money, right. uh switching calling ethnocentrism ‚Äútry saying face‚Äù. tried boy, go back protests lockdown. Raus! lot Swedes sub saying entirely PR move Turkey took effort fly one citizens Ankara could get treated Covid, repeatedly denied Sweden despite deteriorating condition. one daughters plead case. Downvote hell wish, come on, Swedish international news I've reading similar cases, clearly something rotten Swedish medical system. 45% Florida resident cases occurred past two weeks.

So don‚Äôt let low hospitalization death rates trick you, cases haven‚Äôt resolved yet. Yep. Henchanged national mythos 'we're together' one rugged individualist taming wild west. think making assumptions without single ounce data supporting bad idea...  Per week, California one highest. That's gross, net. Agreed. Spain same. People without masks don‚Äôt look strong, look dumb. Variation Narcissist‚Äôs Prayer. man island  reference covid. Reminder beginning outbreak, US gov saying masks dont work. hindsight, likely citizens didnt horde low supply n 95 masks. might something US citizens taking masks seriously. Floyd protests? CDC lie things. It‚Äôs pandemic. Herd immunity requires entire world reaching 60%. Trump failure. wanted quick pump stock market pressured states reopen. Pretty sure almost states referencing hospitalizations talking exclusively attributable covid covid-like symptoms. hope meet requirements one What?  oh OK, cool cool cool yea definitely, almost seemed times various governors competing could react worst whole fustercluck

Love username btw Personal experience. might I've using cheaper/offbrand lenses, harsher dishwashing liquid like say. admit mistake then. Scares too...and many friends idiotic.

This can't nice things. Saw recently they're seeing antibodies go away 3 months. immunity would last long anyway... read article headline? 

This discussing summer activities low risk areas. say schools opening matter what

I 64 page report department education citing sources sides argument opening fall. decision made, made closer schools starting. number hospitalizations specifically COVID. gonna come shock you, California LARGEST POPULATION ENTIRE UNITED STATES. Per capita would tell greater chance high numbers genius. Trying sound smart fail. let‚Äôs look states opened earlier have...Texas, Arizona, Florida....all opened early, yup damn protestors. Common sense says yes protestors obviously spread well Per week month? thing dumber reopening begin fact cancel Food Wine Festival Epcot, starting *day one*. 

Even limited crowds parts World Showcase cramped, one food stall another. 

Plus excuse everyone take masks constantly. Victoria, swear time person wearing mask public transit. Yes, one case island, keep way people? feels like everyone decided back life usual. Makes nervous :( almost like there's lag testing positive dying human brain weird. nuclear accident zone, you‚Äôd wear PPE. You‚Äôd say, ok, want see family ‚Äî there‚Äôs radiation whole bunch places, we‚Äôre gonna suit say hi suits on. 

We KNOW covid spreading communities, yet people don‚Äôt want take basic precautions. Right now, young people infected throughout South. turned summer, people hanging indoors rather outdoors since hot, helps increase transmission. 

While small subset young people require hospitalization, norm people 50. 

Now depends young people transmitting older people. know several weeks may turn out. cant get shit together? months It‚Äôs good thing Trump says disappear heat same, I'm heavy trump country, by-God-Carroll County seen 99% people compliant. Hogan saved lot lives, hope numbers hold. Vaccines 100% protective cases, plus medical reasons get vaccine. still need herd immunity protect other. need apologise! What's point nice technology available can't afford it? stand corner get dusty?) voluntary questionnaire. Canada 90 day restrictions date last MSM intercourse permitted blood donation day takes develop HIV markers. effort reduce remove better tests become available. phase 4 releasing US Brazil let whole world determine would take vaccine not. Though October release pretty safe effective proven effective phase 3. Hopefully works, US needs ASAP. bad, sad, Mr. Governor. cared dollar people. we're paying price inactions.

\-a fellow Texan I‚Äôm afraid given heat. friends still trying invite us indoor July 4th parties... people still think they‚Äôre invincible.. Think difference 6 ft cigarette smoker inside vs 6 ft cigarette smoker outside.

Infection requires certain number viral particles less likely reach threshold outdoors air better able disperse. Speak yourself. I'd love go real vacation thanks idiots control called strategy making Sweden even joke before. like call ""expected"" admit deaths trending downward? option exists: paperwork get line.  just? knew long time ago. claiming go major city incite racial tension /

Lol imply racially sensitive / significant turning point history. 

I agree everything agree correct? many, many comments sub supporting mask mandates outside, getting mad people going beach ect. things contributing rising rates. dare bring protests, response ‚Äúthe virus doesn‚Äôt spread outside.‚Äù Oh, fine going sold sporting event held outside? No, course not. dare sports leagues play outside even start playing again. care money, health. What? thought virus didn‚Äôt spread outside. dare you! lack empathy even bringing protests regards CV. 

There‚Äôs lot cognitive dissonance regards protests Reddit. desire blame reopening 100% problem absurd exists fit political world view (same it‚Äôs protests). It‚Äôs everything. states protests seem impact, states less. states reopening caused spike, states much. places, think it‚Äôs combo. 

I say you‚Äôve seen pictures people bars restaurants almost month, see pictures people mass protests weeks that, cases don‚Äôt really rise much...it‚Äôs really hard continue care lot. goes last group. people weren‚Äôt going public places protests (really anywhere people congregate) staying away loved ones. Sniff...but love going Europe Canada. Thats sane people are. I‚Äôve noticed Florida disaster data moves cases around.

But adds guess it‚Äôs kosher. Nah, wrong. They're clearly radical left-wing shills paid Soros strip Americans guns forcing watch gay marriages ... MASKS! 


Seriously, JFC. area roughly size like 1/3th East Coast, managed curb virus basically effort. Thanks Trump. That‚Äôs super weird. actually adjust facial recognition people wearing masks, it‚Äôs already around - it‚Äôs new? It‚Äôs almost like haven‚Äôt paying attention. Masks good point show irrational un accurate beliefs. decision based facts, studies, empirical evidence common sense.

Btw Americans western countries general able collectively respond crisis before. new anti intellectualism era. It‚Äôs ironic movement started Russians Chinese communist revolutions. came full circle posted reply xCurlyXO Thank support! ... yet probably won‚Äôt. Welcome America, people risk lives work pandemic elected officials get month long ‚Äúsummer break‚Äù reasons. used think person consistently posting ""memory lists"" would better understanding actual hospitals like recognize inherent absurdity window thing. guess not! know prophesied satanic ploy force submission onto genealogy children bill gates George soros? 

Japan must really jealous right cause handled good stuff No, I‚Äôm simply examining evidence drawing conclusion. 

It‚Äôs ironic think that, you‚Äôre likely taking position you‚Äôre protests‚Äô cause. Given facts you, given compelling argument back position, it‚Äôs pretty clear conclusion. shut down. Many us work worked home least month. No. NY already 500 deaths day two weeks outbreak. Florida's 40. They're comparable severity. likely making threshold, States horrible. Cali $450. Wow thank helping answer question. suspicious symptoms left house week. received several packages via UPS, FedEx, USPS--and takeout. 

Is sort national broader database contract tracing information including means transmission? run glasses warm water feel warm. There's discussion had, friend.

I agreed yes, one illness severe other; agreed yes, one pandemic severe other.

Please, enjoy day. let bother you. import. Next week they'll top 10,000 -- unless funding cuts testing kick place end month keeps numbers down. I‚Äôm arguing there‚Äôs easy path forward. Either path trade offs. Silly talk one option bad. options bad. Yea, there‚Äôs massive portion country naive hell anything outside profession. 

This guy high school football player Texas, graduated law school ‚Äò84 became partner ‚Äò86. guy doesn‚Äôt know shit struggling.

It‚Äôs easy parrot American Dream shit happen country reasonably attainable that‚Äôs life. 

So I‚Äôm particularly shocked statement. fits him. Even though rulings seem pretty good overall glimpse. Spain dude. Glad much better us. That‚Äôs needed leaders act decisively set good examples. It‚Äôs one responsibilities executives isn‚Äôt discussed much. president governors needed get people‚Äôs skulls shit serious. Instead Trump called hoax half governors shit bed too. society stupid people. leaders give cover create narratives whole things hoax creates serious problems. That's happens society B-52 sized boner individual freedom, even means thousands people die. posted reply XCurlyXO think logical way reduce beach crowds would last name access.
i.e last names start a-g week 1 access.
It's really way. Uncle Sam like: hold cup. 100x better. It‚Äôs mostly social skills. I‚Äôm employer allows work hime full time (before schools starts make decision) may keep home. Kindergarteners couple hours day work, I‚Äôve already teaching 1st grade level stuff since he‚Äôs home March. Kindergarten likely teach nothing far book smarts go. That's mindset government too. 
ppl losing livelihood, struggling trying make ends meet, sit comfy saying ""big fucking deal"" ...

How u give something dead person? 

That money sitting limbo. try figure dead isn't. remember getting downvoted tried explain reopening plans insufficient.

Now fucking are. there's victory right work hospital capacity friends risking lives. DeSantis pure panic spouting BS like mentor. FL boy buried neck cases trying hard slow it. came ask thing: indoor spaces higher priority close instead outdoor spaces given studies shown outdoors exponentially safer? wear mask... type people like parasite, causing harm people around generally anything useful because, ""yehaw cant tell cuz muh freedom"". really isnt hard basic level common sense care people. lack compassion sad. Thanks this, looks like actual scientific study real data results. 73% Asymptomatic reassuring frighting. Lol ridiculous comparisons. I‚Äôm talking going bars even grocery stores. people going see families. doesn‚Äôt make us pathetic culture all. Oh would definitely vote naked vomit guy. Finally , politician relate to! isn‚Äôt lot karens refuse wear masks lol gather people reported infected nowadays much lower viral load often mild symptoms none all. fact led many doctors assume virus weakened (I really know believe tho). 14,000 active cases probably symptoms mild. county planning open public pools July 1, highest number cases state. kids asking regularly we'll able go swimming. Looks like correct answer ""next summer."" think mask associated shutting businesses. matter political side slippery slope. Giving rights, even fore greater good lead bad things. [This age (hard believe article dated May 20th) know least 18 people. fucked up. Sorry. We‚Äôre probably gonna treat 4th like Moscow treated Victory Day. Yep, political dumb dumbs. Right people describe reason hundreds thousands Americans going dead over. I‚Äôve saying need culture wearing masks West. well got three choices- lockdown (not gonna happen fucked economy), everyone wear damn mask slow spread stay open keep economy limping back life buy time vaccine, yeah - let rip us, kill millions til get herd immunity, survivors inherit earth etc. done....sorry ones didnt make it.

im pretty sure sticking plan 2 olan 3 decimate medical field. That's exactly I've left apartment 3 times since march. think realistically go business gloves mask without something stupid touching face, rendering precautions useless. Similar thing happened got bedbugs years back. procedures preventing reinfestation strict said fuck threw everything out. understand people still understand aspect virus. came months ago people hospital low oxygen levels still conscious, pretty damn worried possibility. virus attack nervous system prevent automatic responses, many ""asymptomatic"" virus prevented body creating symptoms wreaking havoc body time. cases stay active long time. Yes 14k active cases. today 120 new one found, number decline rapidly. union protect worker show up.  answering communication still paid bad idea. definition changed time. me, idea 'how man' feels archaic insulting. customer approach truck, rolled window mask on. says ‚Äú I‚Äôm wearing mask house ‚Äú said nothing. Got tools we‚Äôre walking onto porch says‚Äù wearing mask huh?‚Äù said‚Äù I‚Äôm health safety‚Äù opened door put mask on. Florida: Hol really get new material. ‚ÄúDaddy issues‚Äù basic. üòÇ biggest tragedy pandemic masks politicized. Stores opening people dying this. 

If look countries greatest success dealing Covid, one thing common. strong mask policies. evidence masks work overwhelming. Yep, 16 players got. Bet one big name players could shutdown league right proposing goes evangelical /church society.

I think spend time studying thinking see goes rural, cultural society, whether people religious not. 

There plenty Christian scientists. plenty Democratic Christians (like me). plenty Christians cities. could wearing masks public March... could really though? fact 1/3rd population still staunchly antimask, almost July, seems suggest actually done that... Seriously start fining people. 100 buck citations anyone wearing mask. seems like necessary precaution. Make punishment lack payment similar traffic violations. nice generation cash local government. come to, can't rely people right thing, necessary thing. #Facepalm. major communications failure Danish ministry justice poor reporting across Danish Swedish press. 

Your reading comprehension really needs work. Japan already culture wearing masks sick, sick, might sick. Actually, Japan kinda culture putting others general. Apparently political. Mods assholes. Virginia phase 1 started 3 weeks ago Yeah good point. course simply get married.
Just kidding Testing went 12.6 high reason. 10K day opening Disney mind boggling. many don‚Äôt realize AZ follows CDC guidelines reporting mortality. don‚Äôt mention lost lives reported AZ Dept Health receives official death certificate naming COVID cause death. Well Jesus prolly couldn‚Äôt get visa enter country he‚Äôs illegally. absolutely right gov would tel leave. world live in. Maybe can‚Äôt handle making unpopular decisions good everyone maybe shouldn‚Äôt governor. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Maybe could offer idiots olive branch - don‚Äôt wear pants wear mask. Glad hear there‚Äôs folks taking seriously. I‚Äôm suburb south SF maybe 50% population wears masks (except grocery stores, thankfully everyone does). Drove downtown last night pickup takeout main drag looked like fucking cruise ship, completely packed outdoor dining bar closed alley packed people 20‚Äôs, 30‚Äôs. Yes good point, assuming everyone subreddit (especially one) basic reading comprehension never good idea. [Looks like edited ‚Äúsoften up‚Äù remove stuff ‚Äúhahaha get away this‚Äù added wouldn‚Äôt actually it, gist it. asking agree me. I‚Äôm trying say you‚Äôre embarrassing yourself. back 3/30 added 241 cases one day. welp. Europe, nowhere protests caused bir corona problems. Corporations people! it‚Äôs inconvenient... Damn hell defending subhumans? people give fuck you. People stupid, adding 20% herd immunity adding 20% herd immunity. there's imminent, inevitable, better/safer alternative means pour resources one. never coronavirus vaccine (not MERS, SARS, cause common cold) developed safe/effective humans. would rather fortunate get 20% boost. would already started showing. 4 weeks. Timeline spikes roughly 2-3 weeks.

These protests started back May. Actually, indications increases seem police national guard members. Good point. got ‚ÄúPeople Walmart‚Äù coloring book laws joke gift since got 3yr old bunch coloring books. 
I feel like Walmart employees see shit like go ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get paid enough open worms‚Äù let people want. Minimum wage minimum effort? also tells stupid are. Stop hiding behind bots stop pretending sides same. guys bad people. ""Those would give essential Liberty, purchase little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty Safety."" society adult children West breastfed myth behave however want without consequence. behave however want there‚Äôs vaccine pill pop erase away consequences stupidity they‚Äôve involved in. Well little old virus remind everybody can‚Äôt. America really thought rest America social group since 2008. name company, said tesla company would do. seem daft. state declining ROT 10%, 90% ventilators open, ICU % back normal. would lockdown like that? models assume interventions place work, like social distancing masks telecommuting, etc. Why, know, largely assumptions false, understand correct that. models largely far low since beginning. Remember one eberyone using predicted 80,000 deaths August? Going note non-responsive. Went absolutists model immediately rational talk. He's done little good, massive amount bad.  wonder they'll bring back regional cordon sanitaires? one around Helsinki while. People fought infringed freedoms. social media presence though. Vegas open experiences traveling Japan, large percentage always wear masks public anyway, long predating pandemic. told me, it‚Äôs seen sign respect others.

They especially aren‚Äôt feeling well. Yeah, meds considered immunosuppressive (not like biologic, it‚Äôs weak DMARD), there‚Äôs protective barrier. noted biologics seem less severe symptoms, less hospitalizations, less chance death. steroids screwed. others seem normal slight increase risk. thing entirely expected. virus exists, probable answer ""do people ever get Guillain-Barre this"" already automatic ""yes."" Like said, Guillain-Barre autoimmune disease, virus-specific. get surgery.

Saying someone got Guillain-Barre COVID like saying water wet. Like sure, science journals keep track sort mundanely obvious stuff that's science does, tracks data points. news? No. think math wrong. Lets say start 50,000 active cases today (of course more), doubles every week (last checked doubles every two three days), back envelope calculation say reaches 100% infection less 13 weeks. use next time hear argument. Doctors used oximeters show masks don‚Äôt restrict oxygen intake rest. All, excellent examples, thank you. Norway higher limit 20 new cases (per 100,000 / two weeks) data look regions, countries. 

This meant Norwegians period could travel Swedish island Gotland, without need quarantine returning Norway. Currently longer possible. That's easy answer... 

Ever since president scared mask wiping orange makeup face turned culture war. do/did often well c19 ever came scene. American pride weird shit. wear mask day work safety glasses. piece tape paper clip combat fog issue really wish knew. new Truther talking point. declining deaths things hold to. You‚Äôre referencing one test study Minneapolis spreading represent entire country. 

NYC represents 1/3 entire country‚Äôs covid cases refusing ask positive cases attended protest. know NYC better sample size Minneapolis, small city Minnesota.  bet mote players test positive get shut down. Stop picking choosing think spreading virus think isn't. CA massive spike.. CA massive marches. *Most* people saying protests causing virus spread *are not* saying protests *sole* reason spread. literally irresponsibility across country combined causing spread. Every time see someone say ""the protests causing spread!!"" see people shout ""all lives matter"" response ""black lives matter"". short-sighted touch reality. What? social profiling me? problem persons living basement? saying life worth life someone living basement? dehumanizing living fancy house? Then, trying instigate avoid confrontation throw hands discussions? Maaan, real subhuman. Go back sandbox. agree Disney reopen, opening Epcot day one. Magic Kingdom Animal Kingdom day one. still approve. Finland hard time years, support taking measures protect fully even means excluding Danes whomever else. Best accurate comment want, let cheerleaders, jocks, popular kids Internet

lol peak redditor years ago. fuck been? really need case study masks point? think weren‚Äôt initially told ‚Äúmasks don‚Äôt help, stop wearing them‚Äù CDC people wouldn‚Äôt annoyed ‚Äúeveryone needs wear mask it‚Äôs mandated‚Äù thing. People lost lot faith told. zip code, we‚Äôve consistently #2 cases whole county city Atlanta since started. Sad true. Maybe want electrician vet tech. Maybe want I'm good love, speech-language pathologist. American dream about, fulfills us? yes, field programs offer funding, partial. undergrad GPA 3.85 got merit scholarship 20k first year. still cost 60k. Different fields different norms requirements. I'm speaking know normal field. too, there's one viewpoint life experience, maybe sensitive that. 

I'm happy path took allowed wanted, I'm saying debt real consequence working towards dreams. everyone same, everyone struggles money buying expensive cars eating time. Wages people stagnating decades CEO salaries skyrocketed, costs healthcare especially education. middle class shrunk. Back 1950s within average person's means attend college without debt, house, two cars, raise family one income. dream much less attainable without taking debt. 

You seem really incensed topic, frankly puzzles me. one way view experience world. might want open views experiences others, diminish frustration.

Also, another note, posts easier read split separate paragraphs. üôÇ Ok? shit going last while. Suck up. grandfather overseas 18 months war. father overseas least two years Vietnam. Neither AC Netflix. people can't bothered suck year something actually killing Americans American soil? Jesus fucking Christ, pathetic culture. again, someone know pulled mean correct, guess department labor states wrong know better..

Awesome bro. Yeah, see thousands people protrest within inches isnt problem, really answer random internet link article written joe bob junior 3rd?

Cmon man, half people protesting arent even wearing masks, ""womp"" means nothing me. Wow course surprised. sorry, can‚Äôt imagine situation stilling job, choice go awol? course not. dad served army 24 years, Afghanistan ~03-04, retired 2005 want go back. feel like need discuss ever, never seemed super bothered it, mental health issues noticeably all. imagine actually felt like. Seriously thank sharing. also give hope, make feel like I‚Äôm crazy. understand watched Kat Williams standup talks news came new word: insurgents. could get tv easily say killed 10 insurgents today instead saying killed 5 men, 3 woman 2 children. [This really opened eyes also feel loss. many people don‚Äôt seem see true picture. [Another great clip finished West World, sure fan. seems like many movies, tv shows, books warned us this. finished reading Animal Farm starting 1984. don‚Äôt understand people don‚Äôt draw correlation current world. corruption deeply entrenched, clue solution could either. hope wasn‚Äôt much rambling ranting. I‚Äôm dealing in-laws currently worship trump think Covid fake, said BLM movement racist. husbands family white, half black, half white. worried Covid GA county highest #s rising. science facts, literally don‚Äôt know respond, except social distance now. don‚Äôt know talk people won‚Äôt listen. seriously thank reply! Ok anyone's bro. cant understand simple sentence maybe best read reply build comprehension skill little more. It‚Äôs almost like country isn‚Äôt one homogeneous entity different areas different experiences.

Thinking measures necessary New York city city 30,000 ridiculous

And people like advocated strict lockdown across board reason many people rejected it.

Our hospital sat empty past 3 months, losing $1mil per day. People rejected lockdown essentially 0 cases seemed pointless.

Response needs proportional level risk since couldn‚Äôt test 3 months, numbers misleading unable identify hot spots. whole thing botched people like keep crying wolf saying world end. turned Rachel Maddow last night, and, first time, can't anymore. turned watched Austin Powers channel. They're nuts irresponsible reactionary. 

Unhelpful. 

It one ten doctors/scientists saying shit since late March. talking Texas mayor doctor saying people frequenting restaurants and, again, get togethers, causing outbreaks. I'm saying causing new outbreaks they're causing new outbreaks. Surely latest science pointing poor ventilation, length time exposed infected, indoor risk factors points least places work, churches, public transit, etc., especially states everyone spends lot time air conditioned environments. states could close restaurants beaches tomorrow they'd still problems air conditioned and/or poorly ventilated environments open along low mask wearing public spaces.

The photos video shown outdoors. People eating utilizing outdoor space... yet... more... beach photos. chrissakes, pointlessly unhelpful point even bother watching? Also, regions, lack masks probably even bigger issue reopening quickly. Why? trend across Europe. Italy, Spain, New York, south acted similarly. know, makes difficult discuss certain legitimate topics.   1000% agree: First thing thought read comment science teachers blaming themselves. Nope.

It‚Äôs Bible belt - family values - Newt Gingrich - evangelical nonsense cropped 30+ years ago ridiculously anti-Science ways sure weren‚Äôt close mainstream maybe late 80s? 90s?

Bible literal truth surely existed fringe snake handling. Now? It‚Äôs linked arms always-entrenched US anti-intellectualism taken us rabbit hole. 

I raised Protestant, church-going family. difference evangelical nutters ... extreme. look it‚Äôs taken us. Sounds like easiest person develop backbone towards. can't believe name vaccine starts ""Chad"". bully virus bodies? think pretty obvious people would focusing rising number pieces, given finite capacity healthcare system. number cases directly correlates number deaths, apparently doctor can't wrap head around that.

This "" let eat cake, "" sort shit. micro chip 5G vaccine! people think seatbelts violate freedom? wonder.... world connected. China far recovery. China relies heavily exporting, crashing. People recover domestic virus crisis confront another economic crisis. Unemployed population reached 50 million includespeople living cities (about 50% total population). Hundreds thousands companies go bankruptcy due loss deals capital chain rupture. facing serious stagflation now. Factories cannot sell goods people money buy. Thanks That‚Äôs many positive it. doesn‚Äôt mean disease killed many. I‚Äôm taking number Witt grain salt doesn‚Äôt differentiate dead ~~from~~ COVID dead ~~with~~ COVID lump AA Delta, Alaska, JetBlue, Southwest. 

Thank including United. United probably going something stupid take big bailout too. like shameful negligent Something easy yet find difficult,sad,and selfish ask me. Hm, states understand might come snappy, experience Spanish people sound like that. Like people South Cali always come sarcastic.

So mix eare bad luck difference cultures would guess. least I've never negative experiences Spanish people So, simply:

Are willing put money mouth sign waiver saying since forgo wearing mask, also forgo medical treatment contract Covid-19? Well, Donal Duck embarrassing President compared countries. Mom sounds gangster, love it. ü§£ continent full things easily kill you, Covid-19 like ""nah, I'm out.""

Way go badass Aussie legends. lucky bastard would probably get healthier covid... Agree. whole Asia sheep. See numbers, days get 10x increase new cases, duh! (1 case 10 cases) Remember March April hopeful Covid given science far credibility even right wing may shift bit scientific warnings like climate change?

Then y'all Qaeda showed state capitols guns shattered illusion.. first week May, got chastised two ladies, one around 60, well 70, 4 miles path, mask on. pushed throw mountain laurel cracking branches get away me. dramatic. path even narrow. stunned speak. like, whole world shut people age whatever screeching people wearing masks area sparsely populated literally bigfoot sightings. went rant since mentioned masks hiking. see walking someone without mask threat, we'd already. National single-payer never happening this. idiots rock hard killing Muslims, y'all chance. tho? People invoke ""freedoms"" wear mask. put dont tread flag picture act like Mel Gibson Patriot so. ""Gobmint cant tell do!"" Who? protestors looters? used wrong word calling someone dumb. lol im stem field? 

Undergrad? Ahhh assuming now. first I've heard neck gaiters. I've wearing cloth mask go walks, tying around neck pulling see someone approaching. sounds like neck gaiter could comfortable alternative. Anyone experience them? Everyone press f poor soul gave life paint house. Shame need burn one painter per home. mention everyone isn‚Äôt hopelessly stupid afraid go shopping neighborhood unless it‚Äôs necessities.  Someone show ride coattails? (my vote clearly Kushner) Americans don‚Äôt even support universal healthcare, won‚Äôt care either. 

Sad. mean? kind get-together? We've grilling pretty regularly mother-in-law. set chairs us backyard grilling, feels pretty safe plenty distance them. definitely want put risk. go inside use restroom wear mask.

I think real danger indoors others long periods time wearing mask. dangerous situations, that's dangerous. guys eating indoors, necessarily mask off, would skip.

I would ask grandfather setup still like. maybe even suggests indoors others makes uncomfortable right maybe guys could barbecue backyard. yet lost 3 million? minority mob rule It‚Äôs almost like kind news sensational representative generalized American public. üò± Mortality? field since wanted flaunt STEM undergrad? entire United States embarrassment start comparing countries. allowed say that? Worried he‚Äôs going mysteriously disappear now. Everything bigger better USA. reason they're allowed diagnose illness prescribe meds. Nurses basically executor physician's treatment plan. Honestly two camps valid points. mean best course action though.

I think need get really strict right also think vast majority reddit wants excuse continue feeling good able nothing day. Unlesa covid differently permanent think they're going publicly declare many people they're turning away. Seems counterproductive side, potentially going get attacked grieving relatives.

I bet start hiding data becomes manageable again. what's keeping moving elsewhere? N99 respirator masks filter 99% particulate matter. Tbh I'm glad Wisconsin nobody comes vacation really passing state unless they're going canada sweaty bandana definitely worse, fabric gets soaked sweat paper mask. coworkers agree. We‚Äôre already cramming 3 people per truck sometimes four, mask absolutely pointless situations like that. homeowner shouldn‚Äôt personal space anyways. Social distancing enough. 

The negatives/dangers outweigh positives comes legally forced wear mask hard labor. rather die heat stroke due able breathe properly, I‚Äôm wearing mask moving job. I‚Äôm glad better job lined I‚Äôll definitely wear mask day there. 

I‚Äôm mask wearing, used one get gas. needs exceptions. law needs seriously tweaked bunch people going passing die. I'm concerned. But, admittedly, fellow citizens think actually test faith God (with obvious exceptions Northeast region West Coast). Correction, corporations wealth. American people dirt poor propagated point thought slavery. Yeah well can‚Äôt Regardless, Australia strict immigration laws. us approved. immediate family denied applied shortly home country ended communism. parents masters electrical engineering (so risk mooching government), debt, current medical problems bad family health history, law abiding citizens (again risk mooching government), brother, 8 time, top class even skipped two grades, 3 still toddler things. got denied poor, risk taking advantage government provided health care. reason poor opportunities country yet, everyone except politicians poor. got accepted America parents got jobs field (within two weeks), became well off. obvious ability holding own, parents needed get job pays properly. ever learn...

Yeah dude. Educate yourself. Hey man need online anonymous resources they‚Äôre there. Bet change way data presented. data got lot national air time probably political shit show behind scenes. worry isn‚Äôt beds - put beds anywhere - staff.  won‚Äôt enough healthcare workers like hire currently unemployed former serving staff fill gap. Exactly. I'd rather live simple life somewhere mountains. Somewhere like Nepal.

Howdy neighbor Seriously. country make anything political gender debate... wtf feel sorts ways sorts things. However, confronted facts enough evidence convince something, pay attention adjust actions accordingly. feelings hurt pandemic, ruined plans quite thoroughly. also researched observed accepted things were, wanted be, felt be. 

I honestly give fuck believe masks effective not, know nothing convince certain types people challenges belief systems worldviews. problem comes fact type ignorance killing people causing unnecessary suffering. people segregated nice big enclosed building good central hvac system drooling circle jerk ""mask bad"" leaving rest us alone staying hell far away, care. selfish ignorance killing people. 

""Freedom"" entitle cause harm ignorant actions. right dumbass ends infringes right life health. yes, force stop things harming others. beating child, I'd sure hell FORCE stop. Since many ignorant tools tie put masks on, I'll make sure stay far away all... Second. flip finger safety community, forego right first line treatment. right wear mask, right tender medical care first exposing danger unnecessarily. Freedom goes ways. Thank hope too. Cool. rest us gonna go ahead take die. K? slow entire re-opeming like *supposed* dumbass? Simple solution: hiring freeze Swedes crisis Sweden. Otherwise continue happen. yet another incident add growing list cases exported Sweden. Guillain- Barre known risk infection even trauma/injury. immune system malfunction response stressor. 

If we've one case covid-assosciated Guillian-Barre, going rare event. Still awful illness fatal paralyzes breathing muscles get hospital. Let‚Äôs see well ‚Äúeducation‚Äù goes, hopefully people wear damn mask they‚Äôre public. I‚Äôm NC noticed people wearing masks lately still huge percentage population. Hopefully it‚Äôll continually increase ‚ÄúPatriotism‚Äù co-opted right. see word think right-wing nut jobs racists. see grandiose, overt flag display private citizen assume they‚Äôre right wing asshole. Please join Facebook group ""freedom Breath Agency"" troll this. got booted already üò≠ They're also people tell others can't abortions love sex partner, ask wear mask ""mah rights"". Spoiler alert: like 9/11, America honestly bad guy. Shhhhh..... United States many adults stamping feet, crossing arms, crying ""It's fair"" ""He/she started it"", enough adults saying ""Regardless started it, responsible fixing it."" Reminds Japan never shut down, instead, majority people wore masks COVID death toll less 1000 this. 

That tell something masks effective are...and also many lives could saved everyone wore masks beginning. people sense responsibility . try make like freedom fighters. Ridiculous! Wow. least problem documenting kind thing apparently new Sweden, (apparently unsuccessful) attempts fix aspect past. 

Anyway, great guy survived, sad many others could given proper treatment instead one doctor called [""active not. one worst saddest aspects tragedy unfolding Sweden. even talking cruising coming back? Let's focus managing pandemic economics fallout first. Luxury cruising really high list.

My guess .. come back proven, effective, vaccine. minute sooner. USA lot going them. agree, health care system one things. think real crisis initiate change, I'm sure crisis serious enough people demand changes. america... stop guy...

I'm redneck. Soooooo gonna stop? angry becomes late...deal mongrels still human decency left.. thing rips apart families start ripping mongrels apart.. suggest put island happens...and wait rehabilitation.. absolutely positively certain rehabs short xD

Lol uggggh im lost words. think get island sound like screw keeping mental order coming loose. Even Sarah fucking Palin would comparatively crushed Please explain NY's numbers. I'm literally begging. one person explain difference...

(the answer protests, reopenings) American exceptionalism. We‚Äôre always #1. Biggest military. COVID. school shootings. Best country imperialism system measure. Highest healthcare costs. Murica baby. kind indication Covid spread easily public spaces.. weird said earlier thread related protestors, think it‚Äôs worth putting again.

If people don‚Äôt understand badly COVID going fuck America. Let tell you.

Continue protest ignore social distancing go crowded places without mask within year, half America without job. currently 60 million unemployed.

Millions going infected. die hospitals overloaded.

There million dead virus alone. including people die able get treated regular medical needs.

Those survive heavily debt, work without help unemployment ran months ago government doesn‚Äôt give send help. You‚Äôll see massive spike suicides.

Ask sounds important respecting Social distancing wearing masks. Maybe, probably not. seen spikes places protests open up. I'm guessing something outside. tested positive COVID couple days ago, last night made hot tea realized couldn‚Äôt smell taste anymore. know one symptoms researching online wasn‚Äôt clear-cut answer long lasts. Anyone clue? seen sheer amount people tubing rivers? Getting packed school busses float.....crazy crazy easy find state made mask wearing public mandatory. It‚Äôs misdemeanor get caught twice without one. course people buying everything right now. think bushes dumb ass can/did better trump lol mean 200k people die, wouldn‚Äôt comparable number people suffer lung damage minimum? CDC said 20m Americans caught corona far.

Even one percent that‚Äôs still additional 200k people survived lung damage. ""Oh, it?"" - massachusetts Believe say this, manages dumber Trump. ""We're finding social events gatherings, parties people wearing masks, primary source infection,"" Lautenbach says. ""And secondary source infection workplace settings. 31 related employers associated one party number people brought workplace. us, community size, that's pretty massive spread."" Trump charged federally conspiracy. Hes blaming SINNERS

He's Uber Christian. subtle way blaming SINNNERS. Fuck bill gates Whereas Scotland, Trump Dump ""weclome"" here, since Sturgeon atleast got us new deaths. Swear every time theres one negative thing media blow up. good Win win situation except fact, go ground, run around spreaders refusing wear masks. tho? reasonable.

String up! /s feel bet now? SCMP often rated high facts low bias, beating most, Western papers. Hong Kong paper. Deception never good strategy public health expect people trust you. Subtle. Blame sinners. Never introspective look Christian ass ... honest, idea many decent people around me. heartwarming.

(Even socially pressured conforming still conforming greater good, heartwarming) get point can‚Äôt treat everyone many people it. deniers say friend/family member, died something else, death certificate falsified state COVID-19. argument exhausting. people seem understand virus cause issues, turn, lead death. got downvoted people threaten leave country follow through! 20 years ago Bush stole Florida, 911, Shock &amp; Awe, poppy fields, Abu Graihb, Gitmo, etc etc etc. Trillions dollars spent 20 year war terror (both parties) people threaten leave country still here! There's plenty good advice there; problem half population listening guy says ignore all. Honest question. people photo seem distanced fairly well they‚Äôre outdoors. thought outdoor transmission pretty low. live together, anything low risk situation? Look, hear saying, wearing mask slight inconvenience thats gonna brother.

/s fucking mayor still going forward 4th July celebrations. cities around us including Dallas canceled theirs. means people hotspots coming ours. called hoax town meeting yesterday. level stupidity astounding. planning getting married 2021. saving could afford decent wedding decent house (in NJ, less, housing like 4-5x costly areas thing).

Now losing job due COVID everyone would getting married pushing wedding dates 2021, looks like we're going wait even longer. :/ Never confirmed. ongoing investigations IVO hospitals early - yes. nothing since april. 

The person still spreading conspiracy theories, nothing else. hear you, common cloth mask provides minimal protection wearer. vast majority effectiveness wearer virus helps minimize spread. everyone could get N95‚Äôs least people without masks would susceptible risky actions. right, shut everything. every Karen would equally upset instead I've watching world meter drop 5% 1% deaths 21% 8% last months. Encouraging also understand testing likely big part that. states, like Florida, governors straight ordered data falsified make look like they're maliciously trying kill American people dude white knighting nba salaries closed airports borders early March month, another month, another month, numbers started climbing doubt they'll open time soon. restaurants opening packed people masks. math .004 whole country dying. People try act like small number hundreds millions people country. going bar worth one .004 lives. Texas here. 

I answer this, Fox News. Watch Tucker Carlson's Sean Hannity's shows. discount virus provide propaganda fodder followers. horrifying. speaking family members telling stop watching Fox News. mean technically trouble. Shoot could even go beat poor white person say called N word ok. ever know I'm emotionally charged idiot. Archive link: http://archive.vn/D28VJ

The hospital denied G√∂sta Andersson, 81, intensive care even though space. daughter appealed decision changed. SvD's review shows handling contravenes current regulations.

- sad, says expert Torsten Mossberg.


For 32 years, G√∂sta Andersson S√∂dert√§lje cycled V√§ttern Round [a long cycling tour], summer would again. April 7, G√∂sta became ill sent ambulance S√∂dert√§lje Hospital. received covid 19 admitted care ward treated oxygen.

‚ÄúVery active pensioner. Usually cycles V√§tternrundan annually, ‚Äùsays G√∂sta's patient journal.

Daughter Ulrica Stigberg kept touch hospital. April 8, noted diary:

‚ÄúSince Dad 81 years old, extra control him. present, position stable close sending intensive deteriorate possibility‚Äù.

The next night, 20 April 9, made another note.

‚ÄúHe alert, alert independent. still full control dad see needs get intensive‚Äù.

But true. Four hours earlier, doctors decided try save life G√∂sta deteriorated. journal states 15.59: ""Position-taking life-sustaining treatment: 0 IVA 0 CPR 0 Respirator."" means G√∂sta would moved intensive, get cardiac rescue put respirator, County newspaper S√∂dert√§lje Dagens Nyheter previously reported.

#0 IVA, 0 CPR, 0 Respirator. G√∂sta's journal appears hospital would try save life, why.


The decision so-called treatment restriction means patients life-threatening conditions receive care harm good. Health care help, prolong one's death. difficult decisions sometimes made time pressure complex situation, must always carefully documented. administrative measure, minimize risk incorrect judgments.

In 2011, National Board Health produced binding rules say doctor must document medical record decision made, colleagues doctor consulted with, consultation patient relatives taken place attitude have.

But forms would reported, empty. shows SvD's review G√∂sta's journal.

Shortcomings due time pressure, carelessness, ignorance preconceived notions patient's age, disability underlying illnesses noted before.

In June 2018, Ekot reviewed 187 decisions treatment limitations S√∂dert√§lje Hospital Karolinska University Hospital. written justification every fifth decision. Patients also confused sometimes neither patient relatives informed. head geriatrics S√∂dert√§lje Hospital told Ekot shocked.

And Stockholm County Council 's website , chief medical officer Johan Bratt said:

‚ÄúThe rules treatment restriction clear clear. matter course rules must followed care providers.‚Äù


On April 10, doctor called G√∂sta's daughter Ulrica announced G√∂sta become worse would receive intensive care. judged able so. Ulrica shocked.

- came flash clear sky. pleaded said please, please, give chance. told Alps last fall chance dad competed hill. manage intensive care, does?

The doctor spent two hours chasing space another hospital. G√∂sta's journal, wrote: ""Due poor location much effort consulting covid 19 infection consultant Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, patient moved"".

In afternoon doctor called back Ulrica announced G√∂sta place Huddinge. There, G√∂sta received treatment tight-fitting mask, placed respirator eight days. total month come home again.


I pondered day IVO notified hospital. must continue, must help others, ‚Äùsays G√∂sta Andersson. 


When SvD meets G√∂sta, alert works garden. emphasizes received good care earlier wants find happened.

- all, want try help care get better one else affected. would happened daughter fought me?
SvD examined G√∂sta Andersson's journal together expert Torsten Mossberg. review shows number errors.

Torsten Mossberg chairman Ethics Responsibility Council Medical Association examined G√∂sta's journal SvD.

- I'm sad. Again. exactly emerged Ekot's 2018 review. sad see.


He question medical assessment, often difficult complex.


- Neither stood G√∂sta's bedside seen felt. However, course, question documentation. motivation completely lacking. unthinkable everything.


Why documentation important?


- Especially patient safety, also doctor makes decision forced think extra time. checking boxes uncertain.

Is due time pressure, ignorance, carelessness exceptional pandemic?

- pandemic served spotlight problem. know enormous ethical stress doctor feel forced take stand stressful situations. almost read this. probably gone fast got wrong. strange knowledge improved.


High blood pressure risk factor covid 19. G√∂sta's journal incorrect say suffers high blood pressure.


His so-called fragility rating stated third nine-degree scale, nine worst.


- third quite good means treatable diseases control. Intensive care respirator constant monitoring. G√∂sta might needed it.


Torsten Mossberg cannot comment common lack documentation is, consequences serious.


- easy calculate. worst case, means patient dies.


Following medical alarm tough priorities intensive care, IVO recently decided conduct audit emergency hospitals Stockholm region. Mossberg looks forward it.


- exactly case about.


David Hellgren Svae head intensive care unit S√∂dert√§lje Hospital. consulted early G√∂sta need intensive care time. Instead, David Hellgren Svae recommended doctor make new contact ICU G√∂sta got worse. However, know happened.


- ICU consulted many cases, must also documented.


What documentation look like?


- must stated grounds decision made understand reason. also clear information obligation complied with. possible, reason reported, example ""the patient unconscious"" ""tried call relatives x number times"".


David Hellgren Svae says historically sloppy.


- I'm allergic that. good reviewed.


Was shortage ICU April 9?

- No. otherwise solve sitting calling hospitals.

The family thought G√∂sta Andersson, 81, would come home package eight days respirator. soon back feet. ""The first week borrowed walker looked old it,"" says.

G√∂sta Andersson notified S√∂dert√§lje Hospital IVO, Inspection Health Care. June 25, called meeting two managers hospital received answers questions, citing case reported first investigated.


- bunch words hour, answers became. even around basic issues, says G√∂sta Andersson.


Christophe Pedroletti CEO S√∂dert√§lje Hospital. tells SvD hospital random checks six months review treatment limitations 2018, showed documentation improved.


- big problem healthcare sector structured documentation, completely open to, says.


He want comment G√∂sta's case, takes serious look IVO report says hospital start investigation expected completed September. Thereafter, hospital also make Lex Maria notification.


- everyone table. clear procedures limiting treatment documented. failed, hospital's investigation IVO's assessment show. patient relatives also offered participate investigations, get answers questions contribute views take seriously, says Christophe Pedroletti. one state policy like around nursing homes.

I live one Southern states didnt lockdown well enough. dont giant protests every day anywhere near live, cases spiking new high every day. coming from? saying protestors states coming little town getting everyone sick?

im speed availability vents, going limiting factor. Attention Walmart shoppers blue light special PM's presidents fall category seem feel can't wear masks? mean personally sometimes wear masks work, proper full ventilation masks fitted work ridiculously hot environments absolutely sucks, certainly makes things harder I'm working poor environments. Wearing simple medical mask nothing. kind seems like trying find reasons wearing really seem valid me.

String up! /s Nope... [What mean,  never claimed saying that. said ignored warned coronavirus, ignoring UN WFP famine reactions coronavirus. sources already gave man, read them. Well closed airports borders early March, basically country shut-in stopped virus spreading (we used like 50 new cases day first 3 months, 250). good hospitals equipped pandemic. **Everything** US embarrassing compared countries. 

How Citizens **punish** government corporations run it? 

Clearly voting USA anything. made difference, would outlawed long now. Look fixed US elections 2000, 2004, 2016. Newt Gengrich answer question. also explain shifted Americans different points views actual enemies. reach *a* ""peak"" two ways... either embrace measures slow spread, reach herd immunity (potentially without vaccine).

If former, means risk exploding cases *again* high, completely relaxing measures may lead explosion / second wave new potentially-*higher* peak.

Every country far *had* ""peak""... kind.

So take issue questions like ""Have reached peak yet"". short answer moment, IMHO, ought emphatic ""No"".

As long population infected yet, real *potential* peak still road ahead us, declare global eradication SARS-COV-2. peak experienced far brought back measures may sustainable. know feel like Canada handled pretty well. reopening actually really smooth disaster expected. say someone works grocery store. ass still chaffed state coming from? taxes even high well off. making 50k per year, paid like 12k taxes last year got 1500 back tax return.. effectively 20% so. one thing feel we're right UK. think we're one leading countries studies treatment vaccines, especially Europe. get wrong government shit controlling this, invested ridiculous amount solving problem also supporting economy, wish could also lockdown level Italy/Spain Sheer stupidity population.

Temporary beds= fuzzy math = data guy annoyed right Don‚Äôt worry, Vice President yesterday announced US flattened curve congratulated people good efforts! Yeah, ok dude.

Even taking account greater likelihood people feeling ill wanting go get test. Education spending per pupil, adjusted inflation, gone *up* last 30 years. large gatherings same. pretending side refuses mask distance possible. pretending issue unequal treatment instead difference conduct.

The mental gymnastics publications condemn protests even go completely guidelines mind boggling. politicizing prevalent fucking infuriating. 

When started banned gatherings 50 people, didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúgatherings 50 banned they‚Äôre thing it‚Äôs ok‚Äù. No, gatherings, type 50 people no. excuses, bullshit exceptions

  New chat member‚Äôs profile pic: http://edsuom.com/covid19/Florida_20200626.png Yeah, really know anyone age range taking seriously. Maybe lot friends, aunts uncles convinced ""plandemic"". people legit reasons can't wear mask stay home. already breathing problems, chances getting seriously sick Covid skyrocket. serious issues mask really hinder breathing. mom lung cancer 7 years ago. Big chunk one lobes removed. Thankfully caught early, spread well. parents gone shopping person since March. Everything delivered. I've taken walks mother park me. wears mask. complain. Whooooo! We're number one!! That's president governor want, right? number one, everything?! Take guns first, due process later. long safe, protecting yourself. Fuck idiots. You‚Äôre saying takes month catching COVID need go hospital? really can‚Äôt understand sort brain activity comes dumbass trolls who‚Äôs post history downplaying virus.

Funny desperate wanna blame protests, fact federal state governments treated like joke since March Getting virus something don‚Äôt recommend, I‚Äôd rather get fighting rights people POC fighting opening local bar. telling slow testing cause would less cases. That's practical. Try teaching kindergartener read Zoom.

Not mention guarantee vaccine coming October. even magically ready would take months distribute it. bet bleached asshole. Greatest  Frankly, people exhausted tired following lockdown protocol Respec, brohan much better access masks protect well. Three four months pandemics still talk health care workers adequate protection. protection well normal citizen. would responsibility government.

Weak, weak, weak. big deal masks? It‚Äôs literally piece cloth face. Simple effective. I'm depressed right now. get money I'm going buy record player speakers. know probably save money, want something make happy little bit. feel happiness anymore. 

I see people refusing wear masks feels like going last forever. flunking college now. can't keep online classes. boring. future feels bleak. 

Let people happiness. smart financial move? No. cares. *laughs universal employee* I‚Äôm danger LOL amazing. Laughing. admit, I‚Äôve done before, too. It‚Äôs never good idea. insane! ONE bar! Greatly reducing interstate travel would definitely help I'm even anti-mask that's slam dunk think is. There's better arguments masks ""Well, wear *shoes* you?!?! haha checkmate!"" Yeah that‚Äôs bs think protests didn‚Äôt shit. 50k new cases day say? Next week claim? Ah shit Americans anti-mask

Poor education system, social media, rampant untreated mental illness. wish could flippant toss pithy comment natural selection, honestly I'm stuck FL furious. left property literal months, I've spent hours convincing grandparents stay home mom accept offer work remotely, ensuring everyone plenty masks. everything fucking letter. 

And matter fucking assholes concerned convenience well-being country large. Follow fucking rules. Wear fucking mask. flood fucking restaurants bars. 

It's goddamned simple yet y'all bound determined see far drive fucking death toll. 

My grandparents elderly one serious skin cancer. called yesterday ask thought would end could go back living lives they're genuinely concerned might die chance safely leave house. 

And might. 

See, thing time. I'm still young. grandparents not. grandparents probably aren't, either. every minute spend inside seems majority people (in FL and, seems, parts California) give fuck less anyone another minute they're never going get back. many minutes spare. can't even walk park near house anymore many people decided BBQ season, social distancing common sense damned. 

This genuinely heartbreaking infuriating. hate fact actually used believe country would rally unite face extreme tragedy... we'd try could lessen burden other. Imagine death rate absolutely plummet ..what now? I‚Äôve getting invites parties (college age kids) right great excuse since I‚Äôm getting surgery little week. told friend reason distance wear masks saw last goes ‚Äúoh cool I‚Äôll make sure throw huge party July surgery over‚Äù. Like that‚Äôs meant.... Probably. I'm jaded point, mostly cause grandparents FL helping outlook there. getting harder care every day sure anyone would go strip club pandemic. internet free. Sweet. Let's sure allow misinformation I'm responding pass unfettered, though. people really surprised huge outbreak?

I shocked suddenly ended lockdown immediately see restaurants packed, bars packed, social distancing, big congregations, parties, events....

What people expect? Nothing changed. Yet everyone acting like Corona with. Anyone know who‚Äôs getting coronavirus now? old people young people, kids picking more, anyone graphs stats that? Lol. spin haircut since February, pretty bad... Society moves slow it‚Äôs slowest person seems. laugh want - think that's good either - NY making news things spiking, like Arizona, Texas (my state), Florida...

Protests driving like would expected. Yeah, Benidorm probably suffers too, although think mostly (much) older crowd, Costa del Sol. example J√°vea chill already, still predominantly touristic. 

But true Andalusia, Torremolinos Torrox bit like Benidorm, smaller towns 'authentic' still. Either way, different crowd Costa Brava, capital city people always going special. percentage false negative really low (&lt;0.01%) get due dilution need start already low-concentration swabs. PCR tests really high sensitivity ever 32x dilution allows confidently identify asymptotic people. mass screening, benefit increased capacity outweighs small amount false negatives. 

From another point view, low-concentrations specimen result error getting swab. uses pool testing takes two swabs one person, really decrease number false negatives. Florida's governor fucking idiot. would love opportunity tell puffy, stupid looking face. Shut fuck up. Thanks thoughtful post. sound like generous kind person. We're gonna get pandemic. Next year better, really think so. sort magical thinking that's gotten us mess. spike skewing younger hopefully lower death rate. add 30k cases week spike deaths follow. snide comments somehow people trying desperately prevent deaths hoping reveals much mental states.  seeing action effect profits people mindset around country.

Also seeing complete lack empathy ‚ÄúMY FREEDOMS!‚Äù crowd.

America basically third world country point, earning pity countries managed things successfully, doesn‚Äôt seem like things looking forward rosy. Either stay open continue seeing hospitals reach overflow status, forced shut that‚Äôs final blow many small business can‚Äôt weather second storm. country live ‚Äúyoung people‚Äù stuff referring people clustering bars, beaches, parties, etc. Well, blaming protests entirely less ignorant claiming *weren't* major really worst thing pandemic standpoint, people coming disparate areas, crowding together, screaming,"" transmit virus easily, said Dr. John Swartzberg, clinical professor emeritus infectious diseases vaccinology University California Berkeley School Public Health.

And no, masks *half* keep **6 feet** others. cloth face cover **not substitute** social showed change points spreading rate affect confirmed case numbers delay two weeks (median reporting delay **D=11.4** days plus median change-point duration 3 days)

Protests began Thursday May 28, largest occurring weekend tapering now. states reopened businesses middle May number cases started go end, additional spike infections two weeks June exactly schedule caused protests. scheduling $600 haircut $4,000 suit. venn diagram people think ""freedom"" wear mask people think one freedom pants sag, suspect would nearly perfect circle.

[This It‚Äôs like several places Phoenix. places go to, shop wise like Costco save smart, require mask store. totally skip Frys Phoenix mask order penalty fine it‚Äôs probably safer last week. least cities AZ coming won‚Äôt see results masks couple weeks leadership looks like. delighted vote Jay Inslee November. Maryland pretty good too!! great governor!!  think Sweden kick ass testing should‚Äôve ramped earlier. right testing bad compare Europe. Denmark outlier comes testing. 

Agreed, last week starting pretty well that's *Great*. limits hit, I've couple submissions recent post history testing limits hit various places Sweden. 

Also, apples apples comparison right now. example, testing fallen many places outbreak fairly well contained: *need* test ton many cases. 

But anyway, think international pressure helping Sweden turn ship around biiiiiiit faster incident too. Hey, maaaaaaaaaaaybe actually brilliant bit politicking Danes' part: get souther Swedish population THINK come in, get pissed government testing infrastructure place take advantage privelege. mean probably not, probably bungling never know. Borgen made think everything Danish politicians several levels deep. think wrong. don‚Äôt see Swedes would prone break rules Scandinavians.

Ah used /s instead ;) make sparkling clear. joke: we'd discussion rules, rules, rules point exactly said: average Swede going lie cheat way Denmark idea might forge documents something worry *much* about.

New York, Pennsylvania New Jersey sent COVID positive patients nursing homes, vulnerable among us. 

If don‚Äôt look things accepting fact single news source, run risk seeing whole picture find lies exaggerations. Yet, prisons detentions centers often building. fence around us worked together kitchen. even went yard together. 

We never shared cells. You‚Äôd able prove contracted it, likely problematic. wear mask. Sometimes can‚Äôt talk sense American, prepare yourself, stay home high risk categories.. city Wuhan, new coronavirus outbreak originated China, conducted 222,675 nucleic acid tests May 16, local health authority said Sunday, nearly doubling day earlier.

Literally first google result proves wrong lol think they‚Äôve said press conferences icu bed ventilator. Denmark today said 11 people intensive care 4 ventilators. Sweden doesn‚Äôt publish number. don‚Äôt know patients icu ventilator. Media incredibly opinion based every day. sad people downvote simply highlighting recorded observation blatent disregard social distancing protocols.

 seeing allot healthy people twenties cintract Corona virus area recently. feel bad people inevitably contract virus attending protest, risk took voice beliefs. Woah! Woah! Woah! Since Americans supposed responsible others? Isn‚Äôt sixth amendment something? Thou shalt make law requiring look fellow citizens. *""In desperation halt spread plague, Americans unwittingly unleashed something far worse.""* number suggested cognitive limit number people one maintain stable social relationships‚Äîrelationships individual knows person person relates every person.

This nothing empathy people don‚Äôt know. literally may people maintain relationship remember relate others within group cognitive perspective. 

You can‚Äôt read Wikipedia article understand don‚Äôt post back arguments. Exactly! I've heard use shaving cream glasses prevent fogging up. Especially factor urban density average age populace (Italy 45.5, Japan 47.3).

The existing culture masks probably helped bit too. would take vomit DeSantis point Lady Antebellum Lady A. USA one countries actually mass-scale testing. Countries like China Japan accurate numbers. really believe Tokyo would 300 deaths compared 20k+ New York? Tokyo 4 times population New York, even worse (close quarters) living conditions inhabitants. United States many cases actually test people. point, people blame continued spread virus. Wear mask go out, go absolutely need to. right thing wear mask want stay alive. No, definitely thousands people yelling chanting masks off. possible. It‚Äôs definitely restaurants salons. wild NM creeped 2% 3% like OH FUCK think important say ""Norway"" Norwegian people without position right demanding that. checked aftenposten VG neither even mention demand far could see Grandpa Joe since we‚Äôre bunch assholes like run office worst week 3-4 weeks Arizona fully locks again. Trump poor man‚Äôs idea rich man, weak man‚Äôs idea strong man, loser‚Äôs idea winner, idiot‚Äôs idea genius surgical masks stop getting covid, contain 80% shit comes mouth.

They also kill momentum get mask, ""aura infection"" much smaller. Retina back eye, viruses need go cornea first. **Nurse Demonstrates Blood Oxygen CO2 Levels Wearing Mask(s)** 

 live Seattle area, first cases showed up. People took seriously new heard terrible news coming Europe soon NYC. Thankfully, nipped things bud prevented hospitals overrun. head errands, I‚Äôm happy see people wearing masks taking social distancing seriously.

And yet ... even local FB groups ‚ÄúKarens‚Äù say masks joke, ‚Äúmy freedoms‚Äù, that. Thankfully, fewer around parts country. mean taking longer spread means hospitals get hit hard fast. good thing. main concern hospitals overrun. must admit dissapointed Judge Brannick lifted stay home order Governor decided go phase 1

This said, someone would brought court almost immediately county would difficult time fighting governors recommendations, matter stupid are. This. Several people work (Refinery) border Jefferson County, happening, started refuse eat local restaurants lunch simply think masks stupid part ""Democratic Hoax"", driving 20 minutes go Orange County current mask law. people older people, higher risk serious complications caught COVID. doesn‚Äôt need bubble. hang anyone long it‚Äôs 10 bubble 10 must physically distance. Example go bbq 9 people 10 bubble go long physically distance.

If go bbq 9 people bubble kiss/hug.

This system relies lot honour system. sure people actually following lucky.

I think lot indoor places open restaurants dining theatres etc. started arresting people walking alone beach. Fucking degenerates creating problems acting like somehow fault. Source Would willing admit one variables contributed current spike could mass gatherings?  confirm. trans I'm somewhat skinny/athletic bottom grindr. always sleazeballs married even ashamed fact cheating? need discreet good enough fuck me. Also think probable deaths previous days get added separately. 1 time would get huge bumps deaths, shit's infuriating. Mmmmm I've used statement earnest dealing police.

There conventional wisdom saying over. Conventional wisdom would been, let's look Spanish Flu outbreak understand come back vengeance (and never actually went away first place). horseshit made politicians bloggers random citizens saying was. I've internet since 1996 absolutely confirm everything said here.

Social media especially ease-of-access mobile platforms like smart phones completely destroyed internet. High speed internet becoming standardized also hyper accelerated process.

Lowering bar entry makes everything worse. It‚Äôs good know. think likely since February back Korea antibody test May came back negative. started coughing coming LA. I‚Äôve careful new coughs makes think could 2nd infection. Maybe 2nd antibody test. partisan issue wear mask. partisan issue mandate it.

Neither be, patently *are*, partisan nowadays.

Are also willing criticize Trump's confused messaging virus refusal lead example wearing mask? masks cultural unfaltering Japanese tendency help community preserve safe usability public space military discipline. try separate garbage japan watch happens. get kicked building. even protests caused spikes, ending racism important ending corona virus restaurant opted close temporarily install air purifying technology HVAC system create strategy eliminate lines establishment, according post Facebook page. 

I still need see proof air purifying systems actually work. virus shown spread indoors venues, even distancing. think system like limit spread highly contagious virus. anti-mask people frequently *are* grandparents. Tina Fey‚Äôs twin sister? extreme absolutely nothing sort scenario. deaths get hundreds thousands tens thousands dying every day would mass panic issues supply lines. hospitals completely fill no-one would want risk anything could put hospital dangerous jobs would table.

Since covid put hospital weeks (not symptoms recovery afterwards) leaves weak afterwards tens thousands people unable work thousands willing risk it. inevitably lead thousands isolation coworker sick. 

On top there's fact we're going harvest season lot food, stockpiles big risk rationing might required(leading unrest), food could imported US Europe Canada that's bandaid solution, talking huge country.

And there's international investment would dry people stop trusting US economy function.

It's totally avoidable scenario even avoid least need level lockdown(not sure exactly strict), would require US leaders admitting messed US needs go back lockdown that's already caused hardship many people, many US leaders seem reluctant admitting messed would ruin credibility potentially cost election. happen. know ask protest cities towns found cases tied them. NYC cases weeks since first protests I'm seeing evidence protests super spreads like bars meat processors. gotta quit feeding troll ENDLESS MASK PROPOGANDA. get it, reddit. think also going reject reality.

The infection rate deaths virus takes weeks kill. Making claim virus less effective stupid New York saw rapid growth cases lag death count.

!remindme 1 month

I'll back listen convince thousands new dead people big deal (since 126 thousand dead still fine) Finally.

1) Yes, Constitutional make others wear mask.

2) love America, view patriotic duty, opposed considering personal rights.

That sums up.

This perhaps happens leader always passes buck. followers never take responsibility either.

Inequality, racial justice, corruption become rampant wealth gap increases.

I really hope guys figure out, I'd like much live country, last years detrimental say least weeks ago didn‚Äôt say UK 1300 imported cases? Unless maths changed lot 30 doesn‚Äôt sound like half. see lot misinformation here. reason spike really early reopening. 

It misunderstanding part public - businesses reopened, safe begin socializing without precautions. 

The positive cases happened following: 

1. Church congregations meetings without masks distancing
2. Family gatherings without masks distancing 
3. Businesses discourage mask use safe practices distancing
4. Restaurants bars indoor eating drinking
5. Allowing visitors without masks distancing home
6. Play dates/sitters without masks distancing
7. Exposure persons activities without masks social distancing

I made list using evidence gathered interviews patients came clinic COV19 testing.

By ‚Äúlocked up‚Äù mean can‚Äôt go bars crappy restaurants. maybe something Oh that's good, put sign says ""The United States negotiate terrorists"" ban her. still stuck 1864 panhandle pandemic, everything‚Äôs bigger Texas Sharia law bit scary, doubt would ever become acceptable US. Aceh province Indonesia quite ugly imo. Muslims integrated community seem nice. much topic though.

We need focus eradicating COVID-19 own. clear can't rely government us. don‚Äôt understand seeing surge cases young people blaming bars restaurants. It‚Äôs young people going establishments - plenty older folks going dining well. Yet don‚Äôt see surge (yet) age group like young people. imagine plenty older group going protests seems obvious mainly young people protests, it‚Äôs mainly young people new cases. Examples = LA, Houston, Phoenix.  protest jeopardizing everyone's safety. worth it. trueeeeeeee.  lot people going home old giant high rise buildings one elevator, indoor hallways, small shared laundry rooms mailbox walls. Especially Florida buildings old shit like it‚Äôs decrepit residents nothing sit bar/restaurants day everyday. agree saying, mostly. However, feel there's simple, human explanation dichotomy responses pandemic. is, quite simply, people scared.

The difference something like pandemic 9/11 ongoing half year now, spread place. 9/11 one time event, one place, killed 3000 people one fell swoop, perpetrated (arguably) identifiable foreign power. easy say ""I would've done that"" there's simple logistical explanation didnt ( ""well live anywhere near Manhattan"", ""I idea plot"",...) well concrete reasoning sort event likely personally hurt future (""I dont plan ever living/working major city"", ""I dont know anybody lives city probably ever will"", ""the odds kind attack happening infinitesimal""...). Many people mourn 9/11, though, seek understand little decades-long conflict resulted middle east response first incident, fully support efforts war despite apparent lack direction comparatively massive number bodies resulted time (on sides) it. pandemic, dont anyone blame causing it, loose grasp dictates nature effect virus (or even *if* one all) best end saving lives speculate. speculation turning us wherein adhere despite evidence may completely divorced science. 

Tl;dr-- inevitable people viewed stunting progress many ways, think necessarily viewed evil inconceivably inhumane seem inferring. learning roman history example, recognize modern science shows us many beliefs nonsensical, much focus placed capable achieving despite lack understanding.

While may want jump people quick question/oppose authoritative measure like imposing mask requirements, people simply afraid lives changed ways control over. fear drives people wear masks, cause change perceived difference.

It quite unfortunate, though, people *who embrace science* could collectively tarnished opinion US government seem think harmful global pandemic.

*Everyone* scared, *some* denial that. Getting angry denial going drive wedge all, regardless position, inevitably go down. americans ashamed!!!!!

these blm animals ruining country everybody right here. I've go back work casino shift basically telling people keep masks wear properly. Followed us getting bitched we've tell 2 3 times. really understand. lives coworkers hands bunch people give fuck. truly feel people working health care, unbelievably upsetting. Cses like neighbor's make feel MUCH better bout grandma who's 80 &amp; still going plce. Pence's press secretary tested positive. result, Pence taking precautions quarantine. We'll see develops. appreciate everything fauci did. doubt underplayed masks dwindle supply away. That's horrendous Thank explaining that. makes lot sense weekend lull way Monday‚Äôs numbers lower side (since that‚Äôs really numbers Sunday). Also explains usual Tuesday jump Look, somebody's grandparents need die economy. Better their's mine. understanding inter-regional travel Italy also banned lockdown. US, people could still drive across country wanted to. technically allowed, next zero enforcement. token checkpoints states, really fining people turning back. Even states spiking, local governments yet closed gyms, restaurants, etc. ordered bars close issued mask requirements, seems like enforcement still going far less impressive Europe. Sad.

I mainly shop places make people wear masks places still require right now. Well damn, Foxxy Kat come Same. know employees local store many greet name come by. wouldn‚Äôt hesitate fight anyone tried get face like woman.

I assume mean protests zero effect.

On average, yes, make compelling case that's true. reason what's indeterminate. Beaches problem, indoor activities around beach areas following proper guidelines. always post stories Facebook hopes anti-mask friends see it. probably falls deaf ears. post anyway. Bars seem issue U.S. would assume restaurants well. I've strip clubs years years ago yes definitely really buffets. Saw someone rolling oxygen tank non-essential retail store last week. think least mask though... go week. needed background check needed get something notarized. start internship August, fortunately telehealth, still need paperwork. Sheriff‚Äôs Office great. temp checks (which literally everyone initially failed it‚Äôs extremely hot outside), required masks, allowed one person time. UPS last month shit show. one masks store small. time, there‚Äôs law! Everyone masks. Would look that? done! really wish get called back work last week. Besides hurting back boss seeming care, basicallly go busy bars day evenings weekends I'm call.

And masks pretty much non existent except myself. 

It's giving much anxiety.  one asking bow. FFS little bit cloth might protect someone saying wrong, crypto salesmen exactly shy comes declaring imminent hyperinflation. Money isnt real Today‚Äôs numbers Friday‚Äôs numbers. Saturday‚Äôs tomorrow Sunday‚Äôs reported Monday. Sunday Monday typically see weekly lows. 

I guess we‚Äôll see tomorrow brings... World spreader? much international travel going right now? I‚Äôm saying essential, none us sick took necessary precautions. They're scared stressed shit want reality go back ""normal"" every fibre being, know feelings cope asses massive amounts normalcy bias positivity slanted delusion. Indoor venues also play huge part spread.

Large gatherings + indoor venue: perfect conditions virus. Guess still holds indoor events. Yeah Minneapolis protest several thousands, Houston 60k. Google it. unbiased given right-wing beliefs? PROTESTS over, declining. bad seems burn like 100 years ago. ways people generalize age groups country. Depending grew up, one little common many ‚Äúgeneration‚Äù. can't expect restaurants feasibly provide sort safeguards hospitals still stay open. main choices point are: fail retrofit decontaminate everything healthcare level (not even realistic long takes), fail close can't afford overhead costs keep operational, stop subsidizing huge companies start subsidizing local businesses reopen really settles down. much science evidence backing masks, truly don‚Äôt understand people even argue them. US first country go this. US benefit daily data countries things went well, things go well. US also benefit foremost tertiary education institutions world, well prolific scientists world.

You almost every advantage could possibly have, still managed fuck up.

Your leadership wilfully ignored science, ignored data coming countries. Enough American people followed suit. everyone, enough country become number 1. way expected to. talking dude? No, 2.54 million confirmed cases covid-19 127k confirmed deaths covid.

Are seriously dense think doctors know killing people? Someones ICU testing positive covid dies ventilator think thats due covid lol?  :Shocked Pikachu: We‚Äôll probably keep going explodes anything fixed. like we‚Äôll print money dollar blows up. Meanwhile good time prepper prepared many possible outcomes. good forecast. protests, people took masks seriously, also people handing masks needed them. see anyone vicinity without mask attended, also tested negative virus following week. Everyone best responsible, given circumstances. live nearby area county judge's area, confirm seems like reasonable earth guy. Proud see local leadership trending. get much, please tell joking. strip clubs buffets I'm going regret never going one snorkel goggles, soap usually diluted water. dunk goggles bucket soapy water essentially. might help. imagine type cloth used dry lenses amount pressure used rubbing might matter. bet he's fine laws requiring people wear clothes public. researchers found lung damage previous problems. imaging. covids researchers found lesions consistent inflammation underlying lung tissue (ground-glass opacities consolidation, use medical jargon), specific SARS-CoV-2 infection may seen many forms lung disease. Texans? Lmao, imagine ignorant. 


It's pretty sad know first thing country Yeah I‚Äôm states.. soooo.... thx. I‚Äôve noped thinking joining team Covid. too. I've reading triumphant BS Munich media simply went nuts. Difference Singapore suppressing numbers didn‚Äôt say doesn‚Äôt work. said article top. hours wayyyyy bottom. it‚Äôs useless link. I'll give credit admitting fault

But go back lockdown? Houston's ICUs hit 100% capacity thing closed bars  time proximity. party, know might spend 10 minutes talking infected person.

At protest, would likely around minute two would somewhere else march crowd.

There definitely exposure time element chance catching it. Don‚Äôt ya know, nobody America trust cdc bill gates. Bunch crazy lunatics America ""Likely"" gonna fly people Half Japan already wearing masks even hit. whole concept Âíå (wa) - Harmony. 

It doesn‚Äôt exist US. Instead US concept ‚ÄúMe‚Äù. 

This infringes ‚Äúmy‚Äù rights. 

Masks make hard ‚Äúme‚Äù breathe 

This goes ‚Äúmy‚Äù beliefs 

What‚Äôs ‚Äúme‚Äù? Source? Again, American Science. haven‚Äôt predicted registered anything accurately. Sorry tell you. Also selfishness. amount people I‚Äôve heard past week say me/coworker ‚Äúthis virus democratic hoax they‚Äôre using control us. don‚Äôt know anyone died it. It‚Äôs fake‚Äù insane. world doesn‚Äôt revolve around (the general) you! don‚Äôt know anyone doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs real. carry saliva reserves earlobes. make necessary room earwax collects armpits. needed use antiperspirant 20 years.

Glad I've quarantined 4 months SC cases going ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Cheers least 4 more!  assumed he'd donning Darth Vader helmet. MURICA BOY! wish held indoors. works still even though newer articles feed. depends area, one thing I've found pretty accuate take current day cumulative death total, multiply 100 rough picture number total infections stood 6-8 days earlier (total infections, current/ongoing).

So far, decently accurate getting rough estimate we're at. used yesterdays death numbers (in US) 127,640 would mean 06/20/2020 would around 12.7m total infections US. 

This estimate based IFR around 1% deaths lagging behind cases 7-8 days. perfect means like said above, far seemed pretty accurate estimate back envelope type stuff. Reopening, combined false propaganda right, misinformed public ""safe"" return normal. Go beach without masks. Support local restaurant! boss needs back office 8am sharp. Mask work remember Selfishness foundation of. Conservatism 1/2 nation made self centered pricks care less even parents children. I‚Äôve saying millions time.....I live tiny studio north east I‚Äôm completely dumbfounded AZ, TX, FL astronomical rates infections much lower density ginormous homes stay in. It‚Äôs like purposely went get infected numbers high states. Infection rate seems depend willingness populations adhere guidelines....not much density. amount proles.... amazing really. example, I've couple Home Depot orders pick past month. Mostly bulk heavy stuff, curbside (or even going around back get whole pallet loaded). time watch people going out. Several weeks back, super busy, maybe 50-60% people wearing masks. Earlier week, busy time still plenty traffic, maybe 10-20%. probably really closer 10%.


Fairly consistent little I've observed places months. great deal early mask adoption, everyone masked up, started slide May, seems like not. 


But one individual's observation take grain salt. ##DUUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHH I‚Äôve told opinions Danes bit trigger happy Swedes drag feet. lot feels typically Danish, communication wasn‚Äôt thought through, policy wasn‚Äôt thought through. fuck people going prove negative test? paper? boy/girlfriend thing. going prove that? made another form. together three months(or something along lines). Maybe check boyfriend registry. 

What mean I‚Äôm surprised confusion especially stress policies different restrictions. look Sweden it‚Äôs generally rule everybody it‚Äôs easier follow. it‚Äôs better don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs different. Remember days smoked indoors? went store lit up, people would definitely complain. Chicks sounds bit sexist. really anything bad saying Dixie, thought described south, even Civil War. I‚Äôm realizing sub worst place get information honestly. seems alarming number people think Spanish flu repeated it‚Äôs ...not. Lol comparative thing.

Is 16,000 active cases still lot?

Yes, course.

But active cases steadily decreasing. possible mid-July, Italy less 10k active cases. spread really control. keep fingers crossed next days might see case increasing two figures instead 3. Depends, testing anybody wants test people showing symptoms? lived Hong Kong years owned mask long time started wearing shut orders began. Even liberal city, often one wearing mask beginning... got weird looks too. Thank goodness almost everyone masked now, don‚Äôt understand stigma them. It‚Äôs big deal it‚Äôs awesome way show neighbor love.  mention won‚Äôt fog you‚Äôre wearing right. stiff part across top? You‚Äôre supposed fold fits tight nose, blocking warm air glasses. Wow, extremely uneducated! Guess what, eat big Mac, get covid! Stop comparing apples oranges fucking moron - youre pathetic! Well said. incredibly frustrating watch burning trainwreck slow motion. Living AZ, it‚Äôs maddening level disregard people welfare others. Going back next spring hopefully. Give POCARI SWEAT! serious comment? wear glasses give advice fog glasses. one good, two better watch Netflix dial-up connection. lot comments flagged type trolling. Please discontinue. Couldn‚Äôt happened bigger sack shit. bad everyone state suffer it. Americans fucking selfish.

‚ÄúPersonal freedom‚Äù go far good public involved.

This public health crisis Karens bitching moaning need STFU wear damn mask public. anonymity nice. Suddenly, feel awkward public self conscious facial expressions. Yesterday grocery store man 'forced' put mask on. (I know details police officer checking man wearing mask...) visibly vocally upset saying ""I heart condition, can't wear thing!"" went say ""I'm upset...I feel like fighting someone!"" ... think actually fighting someone would aggravate heart condition thin mask? Or...maybe getting COVID-19? 

The worst part cashier checking side trying complain shame treated harshly. 

So options were...buy groceries go along 
 (in opinion) obvious stupidity...or argue woman side. chose calmly get groceries without causing huge fuss, I'm giant sensitive asshole. MONTHS doctors saying virus could HIV-like. could lie dormant kill suddenly months infection. 

And even that, could cause post viral fatigue syndrome, something associated bad viral infections. Yes, also mask vs mask thing. writer article comes like asshole transportation guidelines they're meant travelers require longer term care, stable enough move, loved ones requesting home.

My hospital surge capacity plan involves transferring patients country, though.

Border towns might, though. dnt think beat deaths, NY positivity rate 30%+ Imagine China dispatched PLA quell HK riots, reddit would fire anger, yet dutch sending military police one colonial holdings gets nothing shrug Yup.

[/s] word sec football lately? would believe whatever media sooo feeds you? think critically, question words document. China one data suppressive countries world. hide plenty information citizens. Think critically, really think numbers make sense? feb.16 nearly 20,000 confirmed cases. next day, feb.17, cases drop less 2000. think realistically, there‚Äôs possible way jump 20,000 cases less 1/10 total number one day. infected, affect 2-3 individuals average. long Americans president believes people wear masks don‚Äôt like never widespread use Ok, share evidence. saying means nothing. happens don't? comfortable telling us facility southern 3 counties biggest problem? Yeah feels bad votes. There's many caveats report including study Bellingham county seat population \~92k. representative larger cities. Protests significant impact covid infections.

At time probably understand protests serve important social function parties even workplace gatherings (many things remote, there's also lot bullshit unnecessary luxury jobs there) addition graduation ceremony, student participated non-school related ""Field Night"" event Saturday, June 20, also attended juniors seniors students surrounding school districts. locker room talk lolololol Seriously. hell gonna get hurt someone walking alone? fact petty tyrants flex authority cops arrest people everyday activities goes show insecure power.  j-just b-bants, l-lol. 

Still taking bait. go, little one. Shoo. Break further, Orange, San Bernardino Riverside Counties CA largest increases. Basically Texas Florida CA. virus gets overwhelms two-bed ICUs government's response give vacation tax credit go Disney Land. odd analysis seems put link circulating cooled air virus becoming airborne. seems obvious.

Florida hospital employee here. dox myself.

My hospital diverting emergencies two days ICU beyond capacity. prematurely discharged two patients rehab (something medical care team suggested waited Monday thought would probably OK).

We're making space we're converting beds increase capacity. I'm working today I've heard we're back accepting new patients. we're increasing floating staff.

But pretty bad never bad before. Mandatory masks casinos, staff provide doors, sanitizing stations everywhere audible reminders use (they already use casino speakers advertising shows anyways).

Back April, daily hospitalizations Florida averaged around 175 per day, new cases averaged around 1,000 day.

Today, daily hospitalizations Florida averaging around 175 per day, new cases averaged around 10,000 day.

How Florida seeing 10x cases, amount hospitalizations? Shouldn‚Äôt hospitalizations 10x more?

Even within social media there's noticable divide. feed split deep discourse various issues, stupid memes, actual commentary life sentences grammar, thread (sexual Sunday) post non-filtered pics various states hungover/kids fighting background/dogs thrown up/makeup looking shit cuz slept in. far removed ""only good stuff shown social media"". Every I'll add acquaintance rather friend instantly regret seven selfies day bizarrely misspelled everything. Social media hole. bets anything made China (I mean put poison milk increase protein-count!). probably safe. Yea, I'm normally boglehead try time market... upcoming disaster seems incredibly obvious unavoidable. Right? someone take one team print red MAGA masks? Maybe trick naysayers wearing one hate this. American democratic republic based upon personal liberties, group liberties. want worry people much, go join religion. would guessed experts right? Suggestion: 

1. People wants exempt wearing masks, alleged medical reasons, must register state.
2. People wear masks, given ticket (citation) wearing one, also registered state.
3. Anyone admitted hospital covid-related symptoms, registered either 1 2, above, shall isolated quarantined, shall receive medical care.

Basically, people volunteer Darwin awards, given Darwin awards, instead taking needed medical care away people. many countries ran antibody tests peak insufficient antibody test kits. government better giving conservative estimate rather likely higher number, also remember antibodies easily extracted weeks infection. Combined crap tests stupid figures like 7% even though everyone cat thing. 

In Italy, right would great time run Roche test. think percentage immunity massively underplayed. Clusters immunity everywhere. Whole families living fear sore throat early March whole ordeal. crazy see thread one downvote one totally wrong upvoted... government powers putting gag order contact traces coming protests.

You got proof this? means protests drove enough people cower homes large crowds increase net rate infections.

So... saying protests nothing increase spread kept people going spreading it. people started going out, started spreading faster. 

And that, protests caused cases. Somehow.

The paper actually states likely reduced lot spread encouraging people stay home instead going out. 'maybe' people come town join protests. Statistically minor group, also, people back home already statistically likely gather indoors... 

So... Likely net zero. never heard anyone blame anything mentioned Obama's fault. Fuck no, send everyone. administrative burden applying qualifying would nightmare. favorite is, ""it traps co2 poisoning yourself... like, know much smaller co2 molecule compared virus, 500 times smaller. Cloth masks even stop virus 100% there's almost way mask capturing much co2. believe contradiction due lack masks started. fear run masks (it kind happened anyway) would happen medical professionals would without protection (kind happened too). Masks sold early March regardless. think much research yet affect non N95 masks like now.

Regardless information given know effective now. people interesting reasons- religion, political, random freedom based arguments well conspiracy theorists. BABY BOOMERS  Cold. Look out, winter season.  I'm sure ""normal"" mask is. started wearing things recently. so-called N95 masks seem fit fairly well, definitely better surgical masks have. I'm traveling plane next month plan wear N95 section panty hose around force tighter fit. Keep safe! Also many places Asia high volumes pollution many wear masks public. 95% lol already wearing years whenever sick. Korea too. Americans fuckin petty doesn't.

SARS took 20 months get animal trials, failed due ADE.

COVID19 vaccines raced animal trials, several candidates China, UK US reaching late stage clinical trials fraction time. sign ADE candidates.

It's fair comparison, suggest otherwise simply disingenuous Exactly. connection industry paying business via grants come pandemic wise use public money. Right, instead Floridians live Japanese people, they're much likely actually respect lives fellow countrymen. know say make assumptions, dude. spouse unemployed since March. But, know I'm responding, there's changing mind. US get shit together, please. Everyone it, hard. Pretty much. days LA county shutdown someone told went clubbing. wanted one last hurrah knew able awhile. stupid selfish, said person stop hanging people really. keep #1 stay Florida! Lol. woman fucking stupid unreal. know else messes God's Perfect Breathing System?? COVID-19 late point. [They   I'm assuming even backyard party require people house, kitchen bathroom. masks = bad. Cry fucking cuck Public gatherings contributions coronavirus. 

Retarded think otherwise. would see universal spiking cities case. know NYC many infected slows spread, would seeing spikes Minneapolis, Chicago, Boston major northern cities protests major cause. real live tiny little town middle tiny little rural county.

I go grocery store. place order go pick up. bring right car see anybody. Austin understandable - government level people instead treating like idiots they‚Äôd get increased compliance. Wisconsin starting see significant rises. protests main cause likely contributing. Also contributing bars open 90% people wearing masks. That's gotta criminal!! Great Dane Detective sure salty antihero. He‚Äôs like House, he‚Äôs wrong time. Compelling stuff. city? useless...... Thanks fixed it, mixed up, hate stupid names age ranges, ridiculous. :) Exactly president tell us wear them. Makes absolutely sense. hate bring politics not? Everybody needs wear masks. protest city almost one wearing masks. state also surging cases. Please stop trying defend protests. risk people‚Äôs health. hide behind biased beliefs want protests undoubtedly causing cases. protestors young likely asymptomatic, perfect combination spread older vulnerable people. I‚Äôm fucking tired narrative protests can‚Äôt cause infections anything else can. It‚Äôs risk across board. get bonus life getting high score? work 10 hour shifts front 3 ovens 500 f. get really hot. get symptoms heat exhaustion. keep mask anyway.

If it, pretty easy rest you. I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôll start time shut people start getting it. way continue people shocked wonder even tried first place. 30 years Fox News does.   America really developed advanced, social sense. also done N95 masks? governor much coward another lockdown. ‚ÄúWe believe what‚Äôs important people listen leadership state leadership local community adhere guidance whether facial coverings whether size gatherings,‚Äù Pence said.

They‚Äôve managed speed phase phase II trials established safety. Also particular one developed preexisting technology it‚Äôs safety well established past. 
People keep forgetting years experience developing vaccine it‚Äôs matter using pre existing technologies applying new virus. 
You may argue fastest vaccines developed least 4 years long. Well that‚Äôs bureaucracy red tape around establishing studies testing. hurdles longer relevant due emergency situation. Also outbreak confined less developed country interest developing vaccine usually low.

I‚Äôm arguing whether think effective, statement production unequivocally false. long-winded, presumptuous, rambling reply doesn‚Äôt change that. Thankyou this, that's great way think definitely makes feel bit better it. 9/11. 

thats siuspect generally correct. makes sense: Largely under-counted infection-rate, known number deaths. good news, rapid decline healthy patients permanent organ damage still distressing. rape victims abortions.

As someone pro-choice, respect ""moderate"" position allows exceptions rape victims. OK murder baby conceived via rape, OK murder baby conceived via consensual sex? saving babies, punishing women sex. pro-life, anti-women-having-sexual-agency. would probably indoors, especially indoor sports facilities gyms. infections definitely going up, think we‚Äôll also see large rise deaths think worst deaths occurred point? death rate slowly going (as far I‚Äôm able tell) I‚Äôm curious know it‚Äôs going ramp again. disagree premise.  Yeah, correct. That's happens support science denying bigots. [Hopefully form $4,000 vacation tax live Texas. Lots obesity diabetes shocked desth rate among younger people higher here. Holy shit! figured masks work--people WEARING BACKWARDS ALONG. 

Masks must directional--small CO2 molecules can't go one way relatively large virus molecules pass way. Solution: WEAR MASKS INSIDE (OR BACKWARDS, confuses anyone.)

/s ^(obvsly) Yeah, one cloth mask metal bridge one never fogs up. masks without bridge, try use eyeglasses hold fabric ""nose valley"". fabric starts rub eye lashes lids. Strange feeling, better getting sick, Imho. Evidently ventilator tube stuffed ones throat. mask? Multiple military bases named Confederate generals less. Maybe thought coming heritage one, including top Nevada health officials, seems know exactly who‚Äôs blame state‚Äôs recent surge coronavirus Nevada officials, too, anticipated surge cautious reopening casinos, bars long-shuttered ‚Äúnonessential‚Äù businesses...


ARE FUCKING KIDDING keep saying virus somehow gotten less virulent deadly ask source get Big Mad. Alabama self-employed people approved $114 weekly benefits. Cus Vegas back open. anyone visit Nevada? problem listen science people work field. countries leaders actually listen science got hit way less long run. US learned absolutely nothing Spanish Flu guess history repeats now. ‚ÄòAtlas Shrugged‚Äô great book supports people carry progress. anyone hasn‚Äôt read it, should. opening soon. Spain locked super hard mid March, mean really hard. still fully open now, although we're almost there.

The way stop total ban travel, mandatory masks, everything apart supermarkets drugs stores open, plus PROPER essential workers, anyone says are. Good luck guys, gonna scary ride think. less people packed subways?

That mostly affects amount people get infected, right? Well, Florida high infection numbers anyway, matter? Summary: 

* Beijing lowered public health emergency level people starting feel ease. city hit outbreak
* Health workers felt noticeable surge patients, prepared earlier year even simpler that. feel silly something new. wife Japanese and, Covid hit, broke masks. She'd brought like three boxes Japan kept case emergencies. Really saved wear panty masks they're handing office. Well mean could hope. holds accountable? Nobody, stuffing pockets, point finger guy. It‚Äôs pot trying call kettle black. used take approach Plague inc time. Humans virus food. oppressing make wear mask ^/s ‚ÄúEarly Data Show Uptick Covid-19 Transmission Bullshit biased post answer bait actual information feel like way combat ignorance education:

&amp;#x200B;

Beaches, particularly Miami would less social distancing lower mask usage protests. protests ended infection neutral spread offset non protesters limiting activities.

&amp;#x200B;

While outdoor activities bad indoor, still increased risks, particularly among groups use masks follow social distancing. Evidence increasingly clear likelihood severity infection based amount exposure. type exposure happens often closed spaces recycled ventilation meat packing plants, restaurants, warehouses, factories convention centers. DeSantis: ""hold beer"" Get new arguing material, points literally moot. NYC firm grasp virus surprise spiking.. FFS toxic human being. last response you, I've tagged ""toxic af, stay away"" Active cases 16, 836 go almost 750 per day. trend relevant, cases critical. worldometer see blue active cases curve, huge improvement.

 

Plausible explanation less severity mandatory masks, reduce viral load make new cases milder (or virus evolved can't say sure now). Masks sense explain new cases mild (you less exposed droplets). Also, positive test might people catching asymptomatycally two months ago already almost recovered (you must test negative twice declared recovered Italy).

A lot comments missed main points lockdown: **it saved Center South**. strict never reached many areas. huge factor explaining current numbers, 10,000 16,000 active cases Lombardy (as 50-70% new daily cases). lockdown saved rest country.

They also figured better ways treatments reduce mortality ICUs, doctors nurses far prepared deal covid February (i.e. figured intubation/ventilator avoided even critical cases). say *why* need testing, *how* could help. posited fact, without consideration opportunity cost.

Just Fauci says need testing make fact. Fauci used say people without symptoms need wear masks. really think dollar spent tests save lives dollar spent masks vaccine development. work Universal team member. communicate lot. Disney opening couple weeks. Universal open since early June lol. lot (pseudo?) scientific articles coming explaining N95 masks surgical masks home made cloth masks etc right thing wear, even make worse wearing one.

The antivaxx anti logic movement swung full tilt behind antimask (antimaxx?) toddler level 'you can't tell do' pushback. mean yeah, state hit goals suggested still fully reopening careful, literally everyone agrees fine continuing moving forward slowly. Well thing Republican voters concerned last 25 years. Liberty isnt ""earned"" ""proper behavior"" default set things birth Summary:

 

* Scientist says Thailand producing vaccine avoid repeat event vaccines ordered arrived H1N1 outbreak ended
* Thai vaccine reaches clinical trials, among first done outside high-income countries reach stage keep wondering poor souls never worked retail. wear fucking mask like 8 hours straight time break lunch whenever need drink water job, im perfectly OK wearing it. Hell, walk florida heat shit hours im still fine despite suffocating feel.

A lot people bunch pussies cant look past 5 seconds realize kind death count theyre contributing towards. I'm defending they're actions, see bigger picture what's going that's lot destructive. wish people would educate history see parallels lining up. Sydney getting like one local transmission every couple days it‚Äôs nothing notable. numbers coming returned citizens Hotel quarantine, nicely tucked away models made people, inherently optimistic. need stop saying two weeks. Non linear growth slow boil takes transmission cycle go crazy. It‚Äôs couple months. Nah one decent examples, Florida crazy rules. maximum pay like $235 full-time employee. come maximum amount make taking maximum payout adding 25% so. 

So Florida make $300 week disqualified, shit insane. Even better... Stay fuck home! uncle dropped HS says uncle coastal elite snob That‚Äôs works. ""It's job wear mask!"". 

You correct, fucking duty. Oh please, limeys shit wussies. everyone inside casinos, masks requested required? would like see source, math number 21,426. accounting humidity temperature? Started sore throat, head ache, went got tested. Didn‚Äôt fever day 4 symptoms started hitting like fatigue, difficulty breathing, body aches day 7 5k yesterday? 2x per day now? say developing both?

I merely asked could possibly know vaccines wouldnt effective 20% people separated properly everyone masking.

It's really difficult say lmao think Florida residents haven‚Äôt received unemployment STILL going miss work wait line 5 hours find results 7-10 business days aren‚Äôt going hope best go work? Remindme! 2 weeks u mean ignorant people.... Widespread mask use way get things re-opened. political argument, happened places got things control. economy main concern, people masks, against. 
 Giving rights
 
Which right given up? country founded principles individual liberty, obligations collective. People hold onto freedom dearly here. Strike!  Nurse strike states without mandatory mask laws orders, passed. 

Solve damn thing week. People would die Govs want play hardball, sucks, lives would saved long term. 

Can imagine state acting holdout citizens dying street? pressure force masks would overwhelming. ...yes, forget massive protests Texas Arizona, massive COVID boom New York, Minneapolis DC. Lmao brief summary:

Sigh - happens listen scientists know talking about. Telegraph legit though. Florpacolypse Ok. doctors talking triage telling people come testing fake news? None happens? people refusing wear masks people want deny LGBTQ right marry, deny rape victims abortions.

The level dissonance boggling. Pence said we're fine. Actually doesn't.

American, I‚Äôm baffles embarrassed grown-ass adults saying tiny piece cloth infringing rights. Wearing clothing doesn‚Äôt seem bother them, it‚Äôs FAR bulkier face mask. saw video people saying God punish politicians uphold mask requirement, don‚Äôt get it. parkour argument far? wish country less self-centered stupid would wear fucking masks help everyone out. told they‚Äôve testing vaccine years already? Thanks downvotes! meant, lot KN95 counterfeit KN95 masks coming Asia. one Bona Fide Masks true-KN95s, already several sites selling counterfeits those. Bullshit.

They're still asking attended large gatherings, specifically asking protests. statement stands true even exclude mathematically impossible death count (most countries clearly underreporting, US). absolutely mind boggling me. Watching Canada horror sad. also criminal. clearly re-opening issue. then... right?

Seems like ""infection density"" may important. Since Italy, like Spain, got close 10% population infected many large communities.

What guys think scientists saying virus follows path regardless attempts intervene? i.e. hit certain # infections, tails off?

 guess wait see deaths. read article day said doctors/medical teams become better treating patients since they‚Äôve trial error time work different medicines/therapies reduced death rate four fold. changes anything regarding precautions whatnot don‚Äôt think anticipate scale death saw New York Italy. Every photo protest saw people wearing masks. 100% somewhere around 80-85% people wearing masks enough stop spreading willy nilly.

In city, protests ongoing *still happening* small scale, far cases associated ongoing protests, despite us pretty good contact tracing one original protest organizers testing positive. Everyone contact wore mask, tested negative week later.

The burden proof supply pictures protests people wearing masks, seen any. legitimate reasons doctor would advise this. However, doctor would advised go public violate rules regulations area. exact reason said. hinders big parties drinking. House parties big place spread. Disease Controller Dudes &amp; Dames got legit belly laugh. Thank you! lot comments supposed Floridians sub also age well. remember consistent comments gloating numbers compared NY NY going hell, calling anyone told Florida worst hit yet doomers Florida going nothing like NY. Though guess latter true, rate, likely end far worse...

I feel Floridians take seriously want government people.  Landscaping, construction, roofing etc... do. even want predict far, models can't even keep quickly increases coming. guess, make it, would current testing capacity, would difficult go 50k. might 50s next week positivity rates bad states 10-15% more.

The models predict worst-case scenario like 200k+ cases per day October seem outlandish hope would willing everything gets six digits. Yea Ontario many people seem done it. Even cuz decided give flying fuk goes party's friends celebrate graduate year. think also take weeks see consequence protest infections... 2 weeks. Let‚Äôs try 6-8 weeks  nothing value add, got daaaamn. that's awful. GOP literally behaving even worse worst protestors without mask, analysis bogus. be. reason shitty governors get untouchable. People wear masks time japan sick. Covid not. It‚Äôs actually seems likely it‚Äôs people wearing masks. doesn‚Äôt really matter they‚Äôre doing, wearing masks key. hell said anything vast majority survivors? Dont add qualifiers fact try make case.

We saying thing point:

You, Mr. Positive: ""Most people recover within 4 weeks""

Me: ""But people got thing March havent recovered yet, could lead chronic illness some""

The. fucking. end. Universal mask use digital distancing guidelines everyone respects needed. wearing mask store 30 minutes end life?? size problem. corruption ineptitude.

Start electing people quality things improve dramatically. reopenings botched many states ~78% US deaths infected ages 65+. 

Especially upcoming election, I‚Äôm sure pandemic dead boomers bad thing. Better oversheltered kid dead kid Super mad bots maybe? see many people still go quack doctors really care/uneducated science.  


Wrong, cause ENOUGH doctors. India's doctors per capita ridiculously confusing prestige science. nothing people respecting science here.

&amp;#x200B;

Both. People general india give respect science prestige, numbers per capita people FORCED look alternatives. think high percentage people India AFFORD allopathic medical care refuses go doctor listen doctor's too. care science. jobs easily make money. 


There's prestige association well, money, money 1 factor. instance IAS officer make less money private company engineer, guess get respect India... South Bronx - 5/30
Lower Manhattan - 6/2
Lower Manhattan (Washington square park) - 6/6
East Meadow Central Park - 6/6

My group brought disposable masks hand protests. able get rid 2 total due fact multiple groups set en route handing PPE majority people need. assure you, statements bullshit. city, contact tracers tracked half cases parties bars. fucking ridiculous. course getting high makes forget problems, it‚Äôs reason brother gets drunk. uses substance 0 lasting change mental state.

I don‚Äôt believe forgetting problems, believe tackling head achieving massive personal growth defeat them. Odd comment seeing world wide surge cases.  liberty given us government. inherent humanity. exact reasons need enforcement, suggestions Low death rate mean last time LA, one restaraunt rat ran across floor eating. Food good tho. No, realistically nobody thought would happen us. make sense happened us. Sure...it happened everyone else everywhere else world, us? shocked appalled. China loved methods, comrade! State help know place Cause quarantining. come across border Arizona, act like nothing happened, go home, oh infection say? money. mandate masks pay actually ensure supply. let schools send kids home mask school any.

""Oh, little Johnny forgot mask *again*?""

They can't, aren't. internet full people aren‚Äôt cheerleaders, jocks, popular kids anti-intellectual. need look farther reddit find them. sure Ohio Texas governor shut bars. Wisconsin? bet wisconsin. can't tolerate wearing MASK , look getting FACE SHIELD. Philly NY enormous protests one disappointed death ratio sweden are. posting r/collapse dreaming one, finally got it. probably expected 10% Sweden wiped now. dedicated life making seem like Corona destroying Sweden? feed collapse fantasy? genuinely hope lasts here. like mask. Circular face scarf (buff*). I'm diagnosed agoraphobia. past months last year. feel safe.

*Other brands available. mucous membrane irrelevant virus encounter ACE2 receptor becomes inactive. 

Also, condoms thing? Bodily autonomy. one allows women choose whether want grow fetus baby. mean, reason believe better? common cold still kills ton non-naive old people. worldwide looks like new cases still going . problem alot countries surpassed first wave Italy, France etc others seem seeing spike cases. alot developing countries like India etc seeing record new cases ofcourse US pretty much failed flatten curve. Deaths seem gone worldwide could easily change month two since deaths tend lag weeks. time tell Yesterday NBA Disney World conformed resuming operations weeks. Disney World open July 11th NBA season start Orlando end July. ‚ÄúI disagree views country‚Äôs govt I‚Äôm happy innocent citizens living dying en masse make clever comment fake internet points‚Äù

Pompous redditors, classy always Well damn...that‚Äôs shit Lack trust urban areas rural. guess goes back carpet bagger days. Even colleges considered instruments humble country man taken advantage of. 

Add open internet, lack critical thinking skills, cultural cesspool. Yea people supposed learn. world different Nazis roamed Germany 80 years ago Spanish flu wracked havoc 100 years ago. learned shitty past.

But 80-100 years later US hasn‚Äôt learned one damn thing. Racism everywhere, pretty heavy love Nazism administration office virus denial, masks. 

We know vaccine won‚Äôt even help US, country full idiot believers, half country won‚Äôt vaccinate themselves. (see ‚Äúautism‚Äù anti-vaxxer crowd) crux is: reactionaries always argue bad faith, coherent consistent foundation arguments.

How determine bad faith someone misinformed? 

Sometimes tactics deliberate sometimes people even aware using tactic. Since tactics often manipulative, may help folks could recognize beware attempt purpose.

For interest, spotting tactic essential. Definitions various tactics/manipulations example(s) would useful.

Not sure would serve purpose except helping weather/stomach exchanges social media. ; ^ )  Mah FREEDOM! US actually burned way money ""stimulus"", gave directly mega corporations. instead given money people would money $2k/m.

So willing spend money. people. Honestly day goes I'm exuding gratitude feeling sadness hard end fence. remember reading article families go jobs upended help whatsoever, almost crying finishing it. 2 grand drop bucket some, others difference roof head food table. $1200 dollar one time check basically fuck sad help need it. 100%

I got takeout couple times, refuse get takeout anymore places indoor service. know it‚Äôs much likely staff infected table service. Still 50 ppl day. serious compared countries. There's difference. America care, Japan does. as? around upper New York. problem demand go restaurants since reopening high tough. bars packed since reopening two weeks ago. Waiters work staff great masks, though, good also economy individual people. dont give fuck people need, care economy. people money = spending. vaccine really can‚Äôt get fast enough, it. gist added 1,854 probable COVID-19 deaths confirmed COVID-19 death count. ain't Maga folks there.    Nothing unreal it. People ignored scientific evidence given said ‚Äúnah it‚Äôll fine‚Äù it‚Äôs coming back bite ass. places 6 soldiers killed protesters. 

What think would happen protestors America killed 6 national guard Man, school opened full time attendance weeks ago requires masks building. classes 5 hours long we‚Äôve done set breakdown live show production systems stages. That‚Äôs lot cables equipment move around mask won‚Äôt complain it‚Äôs necessary. Karen‚Äôs boomers rolling around Walmart scooters complaining asthma muh rights irritate hell me.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ok great comment haha plenty warnings, plenty opportunities, plenty chances fuck up, yet still dropped ball. America nutshell. Thatcher Regan came power, that's when.

Thatcher even said: ""...there's thing society. individual men women families"". 

Now need make sacrifice runs mantra. Suprise, suprise generation elected politicians refusing make sacrifices. 

So different times grandparents politicians said: Ask country you, ask country. ""Take cake, wash make. Take cake wash make. Blue Lake River toilet cakes.""

- tune sang to, old cartoon Nickelodeon common initial radiographic finding found COVID patients called [ground glass means there's something ""fuzzy"" X-ray. nonspecific finding founds many cases viral pneumonia. Now, hear ground glass opacity think ""lung tissue destroyed"". [94% asymptomatic patients one study ground glass opacities CT means asymptomatic patients significant lung damage.

&amp;#x200B;

What mean? need longitudinal cohort studies long term affects COVID. Even though I'm young healthy, want apart studies. Yes mask important. . remember going Tokyo back 09 every go always someone cleaning something . sweeping streets wiping counter. remember comparing Tokyo LA/NY . sanitation efforts night day. imagine Rona it‚Äôs even so. likely death front. far young people testing positive right now. It‚Äôs infect parents grandparents. take month so. Yep, wear one-amazon TONS, you‚Äôll try variety fabrics. don‚Äôt stay great unless add ear loops, (or put disposable surgical mask it, wear chin encounter people- pull up) did! Hillary broke home, used mind control subdue took guns! even turned newt!  /s moment educated prediction. Time tell. Let‚Äôs hope wrong. swear, every year, find reasons angry asshole boomer parents putting hell rock damning try clean disaster they've left behind kills me. Quite larg percentage. Thanks link. salt life. (read quickly) They‚Äôre keeping distance all, business usual partisan issue wear mask. partisan issue mandate it.

The fact find hundreds articles tweets obfuscating downplaying benefits March April certainly help. believe optimism, could I'm betting turn well. NV Fuck science /s China. fucked :) Depends protests. There‚Äôs lot pictures it‚Äôs better 50%. also lot ever popular pulled masks, sure people taking (unless think one eating drinking). told 'Leadership' hoax.

Disgusting. Utterly disgusting.  would actually really, really good. people died died, whether said coronavirus something else. Worst case seem reporting cases 50% - twice many people died virus numbers say. 

But 10x many people think, 2x many people died think - 1/5 deadly think. 

And get herd immunity need get 90% population it. 1% population it, that's going happen 5+ years. 10% population it, herd immunity could come much sooner - especially 1/5 deadly think.

The ideal situation would 100% people turn - would resolved weeks. Unfortunately probably case. Unfortunately, cause permanent damage casessevere enough warrant ending vent. Pro tip fellow glasses-wearing folks. Rub couple drops dish soap inside lenses, buff soft cloth. fogging!

You also find anti-fog wipes made ski goggles diving masks. work well, too. looks like ppl lost ability feel empathy sickening. would love know two World Wars preceded change like this, cause feels like outh be, maybe ppl lose ability feel empathy start behave like entitled brats start wars bodybags start pile win back empathy suddenly (this theory mine). That's point though, antibodies guarantee getting disease. That's getting everyone vaccinated important rough. I‚Äôm sorry went that, glad hopefully much better. I‚Äôm sure friend would want happy!

I listen [Chris updates, well reports numbers hospitalizations. rising trend scares news. issues also around people go like issue don‚Äôt wear masks. won‚Äôt hanging people like time being. really bad asthma, long term damage virus causing longevity, mixed health insurance got laid said virus. might overly cautious really don‚Äôt want get it. please look videos some, PhD epidemiology, it‚Äôs flu. flu kills like 380k annually, 4 months Covid killed 500k rising. 

Thanks suggesting book check out. I‚Äôm much novel reader grabs attention hooked.

My dad piloted blackhawks, told minor details before, know holding back. make sure talk him, I‚Äôm sure aware happening, get brains him!

The learn, gets worse worse. Ignorance truly bliss. would rather know truth feel do, blinded it. I‚Äôm pretty fucking cynical. Best family well! dude arrive US yesterday what? Using Japan example terrible.

The japanese culture may help combatting COVID cannot serve role model diverse pluralistic western cultures. supposed racist slur kind? Pro-life misnomer, living creature actually pro-life, order survive end lives living things get food. 

Pence anti-choice. thinks women allowed choose bodies. sub absolute antithesis scientific testing Don‚Äôt forget meth gay hooker hotel room too! Both. rate reopened put us heads time could evaluate reopening going.  sure post update internet points!  Indonesian here: yes stupid. bodies, also took patients force hospital, happen everyday here.

The body hijackers wants bury dead family traditional/religious burial instead covid19 procedure burial.


Some hijackers got covid19 positive got arrested police Americans prefer demented rapist politician‚Äôs orange flavored &amp; loaded corn syrup. hoping delays here. already said they‚Äôre delaying openings gyms, movie theaters malls matter phase each. Even positivity rate dropped .8 1.3 last weeks, it‚Äôs better little cautious. Don‚Äôt drugs, kids. hang science-only sub. WeaRiNg MasKs wow... Yeah lasted days, maybe week. weird, every room smelled same. Outside smelled inside. Incredible. like know anything contagious diseases. COURSE. People protesting around world, yet America place seeing surge magnitude open fine, also open stupidly? seem odds. opened stupidly, didn‚Äôt open fine. wait minute, laws requiring cover genitalia, orifices? fairly equivalent either would violate rights neither would. Especially laws requiring women cover chests men. see right way. good feeling, make question hope country. Us plebs everywhere time (and admittedly considered US ""always right"" party). 

Next time hear renaming french fries freedom fries, think COVID reminder maybe others point could wrong. proud american. Make country better, constantly. reason spelled ***""freedumbs""***...exactly agree what‚Äôs said here, vaccine mythical all. least 4 candidates track market end year.

It's mythical vaccine. he's saying comes evidenced based understanding. Even makes people frustrated hear. fears hopes dictate reality. Reality does. 

There's reason experts categorizing vaccine effort way finding exceptions rule change rules. 

A lot things vaccine candidates. SARS vaccine candidates. None successful everyone lost interest vaccination.

And even vaccine, vaccine seasonal flu measles, there's nothing vaccination guarantee fundamental change.

And series unprecedented miracles allow us vaccine end year, there's still mass production distribution demands.

And think time honest conversation whether US prepared stay locked several months order get us health care system collapses, lose lot work force, economy, etc.

Your delivery driver dependent dialysis die. I, hospital administrator, medical care team, lot people industries critical vaccine manufacturing distribution.

And survive might permanent kidney, heart, lung failure.

Locking allows us work force infrastructure handle this. Remaining open may cause additional delays.

And closing would require Congressional financing. Revisit month, see. I've said start, point people accept it. week late Spain, think would worked well then. watched Italy, knowing week behind, think instrumental relative success. world looked horror doctors decided lived died, felt here, knowing coming soon. think US long ago now. Yep, give two weeks! I‚Äôm sure models tweak assumptions since peoples behavior changing. models don‚Äôt predict single value.

The UW one useful understand may headed. Somehow everything got mixed in. Wearing cotton face broke camels back extreme levels mistrust. mask blocks spit particles flying mouth. mask protects droplets. Except Spain, Italy, Korea, France, etc etc etc they've living first time US. Turns out, they've almost eradicated US exploding. That's ""it happens"" thing, that's USA undeniably worse emergency  happens go Flo 'Merica! Florida approach. show could weaker virus, means give fuck people.

The American toxic mindset glorifies ""lone wolf"" cares themselves. bastardization frontier mythology cleverly ignores fact many frontier people families *heavily* relied people around get tough times. trespassed like disruptive customer. 

Now whether mangers like actually totally different discussion. . EXACTLY sheer ignorance. healthcare coworkers talking enforcing masks time like trying use condom pregnancy, created CDC disappointed moment. I'm saying protests carry risk spreading virus, lower risk outdoors inside bar. got argument co-worker masks. like mask went house banged mom something. big deal? Got find cool one Joe Exotic Corgi butt it. feel personally attacked wear piece fabric face. (If serious might worth order adhesive metal nose strips. They've completely stopped fogging experiencing make masks way effective) Well, reading said, protests caused everyone else stay home. would also add study went June 20th, lot states strong uptick week. upwards 2 week lag exposure showing symptoms so...do really know? Japan. that, proper social distancing too! No, take pride stupidity ignorance. people think college idiots. wonder perform surgeries needs doctors, right? become suicidal shoot twice back 3 times head plan changed. bad asthma allergies carry oximeter run. much trouble breathing, pulse ox/V02 Max 97-98 whole time. try get mask high thread count cotton one side(600 so), silk other- cotton trapping virus comfort, natural silk apparently attract virus, may slightly easier breath correct, though set page big picture stats (sorry can't find it). I‚Äôm sure know (or even care) ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Mess Texas‚Äù actually anti-litter campaign slogan. hilarious. model COVID-19 response, look states east Florida wear mask go care well shouldnt forced mandated law so. 

You're forced mandated law wear seat belts. affects people seat belts. Absolutely middle ground.

In classrooms Japan, students frowned upon express opinions. comes cost. believe individualistic societies innovative. USA always fractured melting pot many cultures. strength weakness. weakness people get tribes fight. strength realize pull best characteristics different groups come solution. benefits usually seen longer term downside seen short term.

Clear examples see things like ‚Äúcode talkers‚Äù. unusual short term long term gain economic growth. Individualism ramps economic growth progress pulls people poverty long run short run leads wide economic disparity. think pull towards collectivism slowed growth leading people clash. people trapped indoors thinking current situation, built anger coming out. hand extremes individualism 1800‚Äôs led massive growth also led protests economic disparity. benefit today growth individuals time suffered. 

So much good thing bad... reminds added spinach diet went healthy eating kick. endurance performance helped lot. good clean diet. hate bag spinach every day. mention spinach eating causes kidney stones? worth it. Balance good unfortunately vogue today. agree with, fuck can‚Äôt people wear face masks? everything need advance side? lost lottery ;( live Midwest. Midwest NorthEast really trying minimize cases. South West not.. great.  Feel free address point. I'll wait. Yeah false equivalence theres far peoole gathering together protests party! Protests worse! yet happen understand full emergency. People stupid. know reason people keep claiming protests risky places data skewed contact tracers allowed job properly. Testing stations shut protests also contributed that. think political thing, paying attention. 

Both sides playing game right now, called ""Who wins White House"" virus another pawn game. St. George.  say anything mask associated closing certain businesses. right I'm talking right business opened. government shutting businesses slippery slope. right whatever want ever want matter affect around me? know carry gun, refusing wear mask self quarantine / stay home shouting obnoxious everyone who‚Äôs listening experts thinking wider community. Rights great can‚Äôt take grave useless ur dead. Somewhere along line western extreme american culture become self obsessed want individuals less regard fellow humans. ignorant defence. said vast majority people reddit seem really try right thing! Presumably Olympics postponed, incentive longer there, months? rule Ontario 10 people bubble, hang 10 people total including people hung connected whole country, week week % decrease deaths shrinking Swedish Meatball entered chat ^ likely, eyes ACE2 receptors suck droplets like nose mouth, evidence eye borne infection weak, look Right recommendation wear eye protection caring Covid positive patient otherwise comfort level. bad  her, healthcare workers whole disproportionately impacted due nature jobs.  When/If overcome this, mental physical trauma left behind infected directly impacted indirectly going long felt. answer respect article, wrong?

If article correct, fine. Better lot garbage even true! I'm still seeing argument, more, ironically, extremely childish insults. quite pathetic.  
 
Whatever. dismissed. It‚Äôs Q it‚Äôs swallowing older conservatives wholesale. US stagnant every industry tech, food retail.

The bulk progress US stopped weak people mention weak minds too. Well parties happening weekends, way instances way participants

Then parties close proximity social interaction touching surfaces eating drinking enclosed space prolonged period time exposure math question. humanity hard fake?

But since can't wrong, I'll you: X 1, R0 disease 1. Meaning still spreading. Therefor still problem.

To break even simpler you: something riskier something else second thing risky. Shooting head gun riskier riding broken Rollercoaster. They're risky. case, riding broken Rollercoaster something do. lying risky simply foxnews levels bullshit. wife lived 3 years would love go back. look jobs regularly awesome makes sound. want little mask sign hold up!!!! 6.4% actually. clearly rise. going ""its 6%"" complete bullshit designed ignore truth situation bad getting worse. Every freaking night here! small ones, larger ones actually go ways explode smaller versions ones would see 4th. Like come people! got lucky last night cause stormed. 8.9k. around 5k day before, still onsane. Disney world least waited month. Universal, sea world, lego land reopens earlier month. think credit due Disney cautious others bet (or forced) delay. Nah, I'd say encouraging listener base something could kill them, qualifies idiocy intentionally something could drive future profits.  I‚Äôve lost hope it‚Äôs change anything. What‚Äôs old Stalin quote (maybe made up?)

‚ÄúA thousand deaths tragedy, million statistic?‚Äù

120,000 dead Americans doesn‚Äôt seem phase many people would expected. Yeah, going happen. watched two people argue dispensary staff yesterday wearing masks. everyday thing, every business. People get it. CDC clearly made mistake recommending cloth masks. However, they're reason wearing masks become political issue... less discomfort ""you can't tell I'm American!"" infected shredding virus way past woring exposure levels (which probably matter get infected). Every breath take goes nose, picks viral particles brings lung. exhale, viral particles go lungs back towards nose mouth. see mask would change exposure level significant way protests area high mask usage though, probably 70% more, way higher go store. too- basically run 5-6% grade hills around now, stay far away beach, wear balaclava whole time, cross paths human- love 6ft away pull surgical mask balaclava. it‚Äôs hot, I‚Äôll leave surgical mask up. maybe idea getting rid testing altogether isn‚Äôt bad idea all! Can‚Äôt coronavirus suspect bad cold!
/s ever get first one, bet get second one! thinking recovered since then, may ask? 

Thanks sharing story. Yeah, anyone half brain knew 5 months ago. again, likely people said ""It's Flu, wear masks, lockdown's work, etc..."" lot hospitals allowing visitors right now. Might want look fly Well maybe staying home smoking weed... rest us, things looking like gonna ""alright"" Disposable seems wasteful

I'm already seeing littered surgical masks everywhere  Maybe enjoys prostate play? rights. selfish-isms. want inconvenienced don‚Äôt care others. That‚Äôs culture bred anti-science, anti-community politicians. say it‚Äôs rights socialist wise... absolutely asinine certainly nothing opening cess pools known casinos, requiring everyone wear masks yesterday, drunken tourists world thinking vacation dandy idea midst world wide pandemic.

I hope get bottom mystery soon. /s hit vast majority yet. Odds kill 250,000+ over, affecting many families. future deny even happened like idiots Holocaust. Yeah friends Manhattan said terrifying could literally never mentally check happening sirens constant. Spanish Flu, behaved exactly like Covid: went summer fiercely resumed September October, creating 50 million deaths second wave,""

Uh, except time, going summer... government still sitting 1.9 trillion approved CARES Act. supposed helping taxpapayers IRS sent 1.4 billion deceased.

[GAO also tells strategy beginning. constant misinformation forced lockdowns mixed hypocritical unscientific ideas what's essential business vs. what's not, politicization allowed go break quarantine lost good public beginning pandemic, half public chicken little mindset going listen anymore. think horrible mindset lead death, watched unfold, could see coming Americans listen think dealing honestly them. Even means end suffering result. much higher population density, I'm sure, STILL many miles (or Km...) ahead America. really sad time patriotic American cares others. What‚Äôs worse Fox News releasing Fox Nation appears subscription based news source? Imagine like-minded people subscribing single news source. We‚Äôre fucked. could set pandemic team would specifically focus efforts studying exact situation put charge shit like [happens](http://). Well there's way parties protests quite limited days/time outdoors include sharing drinks food close interaction indoors Great! son flying Delta see Dad July
 uneasy flight/ traveling panic, knowing calms little. That‚Äôs funny me! Ummmm, already take phone everywhere dumb ass. I'm responsible state. Deal fucking problems certainly would attitude standing deal mine. states requiring 14 day quarantine periods traveling state.

I know New York does. sure State California state Michigan visiting. September/October can‚Äôt come soon enough 40 miles outside city spent lot time late Feburary various hospitals clinics Lyme disease. (I suspect got infectious disease clinic went late Feburary) Shit, riding road bike. know annoying glasses keep fogging up? Super fucking annoying BUT...not annoying getting sick getting someone else sick.

For part now, ride quieter times use peloton instead get exercise. 

But like say, easier move accept minor annoyance. sure scientist? live suckass Florida know NYC regret opening indoor bars restaurants July 6th. 98 Orlando today without heat index worse, people infected higher chance another infectous deadly strain develops game starts anew. Case numbers low means protests helped plant seed grow time, seen peak response protests (IDK long ago were, suspect it'd take 20 days cases start appearing hospitals). Protests large numbers proximity, disaster waiting happen.

But course, i'm arguing bars awful idea ATM. Keep shut down. protests going time. Wait vaccine herd immunity time work. People seem care grandma. I've seen dumbass family dumbass friends say ""It kill me, kills compromised immune system already way out"" that's true even okay I'm teacher UK (currently maternity leave) seeing colleagues planning work home looks soul destroying. matter set parents complaining, set worksheets - parents say printers, set online activity - parents complain technology access it, set activity involves kind resources (crayons, glue, card etc) - parents get cross home.

The pot ideas things children resources, adult involvement, internet access printers small they're fighting battle can't win. better making claim effects protests COVID-19 case growth absence evidence. happened Texas toxic political environment. keep thinking about. WW2 killing 400,000 people United States years level sacrifice country made... years. 100,000 people die couple months orders stay home family... ""I want wear mask live like this.""

I know economic hardships involved, demanding government account every penny stimulus get right people.

Someone double check math.

$50,000 x 20,000 people = 1 billion.

$50,000 x 20 million people = 1 Trillion. believe saw news want gone now? American, ridiculed wearing mask well. literally lost friend season, shut couldnt take anymore never like ropic before. Nah, it‚Äôs good. didn‚Äôt want think ‚Äúhate life want die‚Äù person. Exercise bad chance pulling muscle increased compared sitting couch eating cheese poofs. Everything‚Äôs bigger Texas tell something masks effective are...and also many lives could saved everyone wore masks beginning.

The issue humans like herds cow, multiple leaders saying masks required.... people pick ""Right"" polarize it.

It takes good government good society. literally said. ‚ÄúLet know millions die countries‚Äù

Regardless even infected numbers deaths way down. make mistake find risky situation, people time time, remind things done reduce risk reduced _overall_ risk. risk situation might higher, safe, odds one time unlucky low. saying everybody rights live purely service community. reality mean, state. 

Perhaps like neighbor? Perhaps know neighbor would never stand hour need even stand his?

There's little reason put danger protect people hate seek remove rights deference serving them. Lmfao hard dumb? Like must get stuck simplest problems. Vietnam, undefeated! restaurants bear loop we‚Äôre PACKED No. opened fine. opened stupidly. retarded governor didn‚Äôt require masks that‚Äôs problem. comment previously deleted nonsense name companies supposedly eorse, matter whataboutism. guarantee can't find data supports wild ass assertion. wording implies judge dismissing importance rights. wear mask literally nothing rights. government always able tell people cover certain parts body clothing. Right includes mouth. children murdered school nothing done make sure happen again.

And continued happen. OTOH, sub allowed fact-free letters editor posted Washington Post. LOL Yea asymptomatic, pass closely, leave people ‚Äúwake‚Äù- effectively breathing them- hence need mask. protect others you. Says guy wearing mask. stats many people rally got virus? I'm surprised heard anything. culture theirs, OURS. don‚Äôt get Fox News blamed much cities allowed mayhem exactly Fox News cities? gatherings controlled masks social distances. never heard anyone that, question anyone wears mask. That's false equivalence know it. want want also like protestors. Japan? Everything pretty much normal. I've tons since blew up. Heck, I'm teacher we've working. weird. first self isolating worried honest, seems almost non existent here. idea why. Climate? Diet? Regardless, normal. gives update past 24 hours. way slice numbers match, even close. mild cases. partner sick month. Dry coughs, chest heaviness, shortness breath. lost sense taste smell bizarre finally partner headache bad went ER. doctors hounding us asking us traveled (we work high tourist industry) wrote notes work sent us home. antibody test came positive 70% accuracy. someone seen coming. It‚Äôs true. honestly, I‚Äôve impressed many people friends reported wearing masks protests. makes hopeful. forgot /s mate Yep. good we‚Äôre green phase people acting like means virus leave us alone. hope everyone around wearing masks though I‚Äôm sure people try pretend everything back normal they‚Äôll start ditching masks. odd reply. 

I would thought logic showing anticipated survivability rate much higher reported news would received good news apparently like wallow fear. can't help Edit: find little weird fixated people's age.

This might oddest part reply because: 
1) I'm fixated age all, literally CDC breaks numbers. 
2) 65 seems make one risk widely reported. 

So fixated all. part data that's necessary analyze what's going on.

But seem logic reason strengths. work giving crap calling out. 

What industry work in? Wow. seem triggered fuxk, writing church pew COVID funneral!?

How bad would say gets find appropriate begin discussing whether there's god watching unfold? question someone whose approach solving seems asking god help? ""the point saying stuff like this"" would say?

If real, made this. Apparently ""plan"" calls wanton suffering preferred way to... well exactly, guess. fucking joke.

You thought system let become God Emporor Earth wealthy going shit poors? much true. Denmark shut swimming harbors due overcrowding. guess that's big difference though: *can* that. hope Starbrink gets wish Sweden needs to. Bill Burr said best: time Trumps walk built, we're ones going going it. know would 3 years. Blue light special K-mart thing. like father law.

Percentage Positive means test say 100 15 positive, get 15% positive.

If test more, number tends go down, test, slacker requirements be, thus negative people end tested. Remember images people suddenly passing street Wuhan. condition may explain that. mostly does. 100,000 dead counting? states doubling back reopening plans due large outbreaks? 

Thats at. Well that's shitty, genuinely wanted see comment. dont own? guys understand people financing super cars mansions. like car home. 

Gosh yall really need grow up. Oh stfu..you weighed, measured.. found wanting...

Bye dirk Ah, return Darwinism. what's needed. Modern medicine allowed fools live long. It‚Äôs pile rubble now. computers crushed, can‚Äôt access update numbers. Lol, one dismissing facts currently know. 

Covid19 widely detected U.S. February. death rates weeks remained stable.

After schools started shutting middle March Covid19 detected U.S. death rate week Mar 28 spiked 11% higher average week.

By April 11, weekend supposed open Easter, death rate spiked 40%

As recently 6 weeks ago spike deaths week 15%. since CDC page facts states take 8 weeks update data trickling around U.S. I'm sure wait get data posted trusting 15% spike. Here's Texas' latest case/death chart, 7-day running averages:

 chart fucking article. 

The states biggest protests spikes INCREASE COVID due protests offset buy millions people avoided going due protests lol. 

Like really think fucking people packed liked sardines didnt cause increase?

States opening early also dumb fuck waited bit cant shit closed forever Canada took swifter action earlier reduced cases. Canada-USA border closed appears helping well. Canada seeing spikes though, check Kingston Ontario. hope you‚Äôre taken care grocery store brother. Thanks showing safe. 21,000+ total cases 1580 US veteran deaths. don‚Äôt know isn‚Äôt bigger story. keep hearing Covid ravaged nursing homes nothing mishandling VA hospitals elderly veterans. US veterans it‚Äôs country would rank 50th cases 31st deaths. r/conspiracy gonna shambles! they'll field day this. involved know massive protests every single day since start June streets New York. 

No statistically significant spikes anywhere. Good job, NYC. I'm living New York, although state seems best, still embarrassed living stupid fucking country. Nope. You‚Äôre stupid. could listened scientist doctors. Theres lot nice places America. struggling doubt moving geographically going help much. Almost like people telling shut fuckin reason Yes, trying say think handling well all. Blame president refuses wear mask! generation old dead now, generation charge spoiled shit children great people able put college part time job retire pensions social security. Thank summarizing best reason wearing mask. percentage Americans actually test? therefore percentage Americans 100% sure positive right now? everyone taken test week currently wearing mask said mask effective people currently infected somebody proven infected ought concern fellow man woman Yes, coronavirus politically aware disease itself. simply refuses spread protests, riots, looting parties social justice theme. politcalization science last 15 years truly frightening thing watch. gotten exponentially worse last two years. Sorry, don‚Äôt use imagination... point not, never, lived way eliminate risk. current pandemic even worrisome thing face every time leave house. terrified getting car, virus .03% fatality rate stops tracks? Let's hope stays quiet Finland! keeping eye Norrbotten situation least [seems somewhat like exploding more. *think* strict lockdown-esque NPIs region instituted (indepedently FHM) *should* pretty quickly bring problem control there.

Pneumonia actually considered even factor simply even mild cases often walking pneumonia scans barely symptoms. also said get ARDS isn‚Äôt severe, that‚Äôs critical. Severe anything hospitalization, ICU/ARDS/ventilator. Moderate basically flu like symptoms, feel REALLY shitty pain that, requiring hospitalization. 

I don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre getting guideline says mild anything hospitalization. possibly describe family then? Barely symptoms, maybe light cold. would possibly put category guy describing? model infers Sweden took overall best long term course action based science, instead fear speculation.

So, chance they'll close restaurants again? Make to-go's? know pandemics now? mean, least wait two weeks. gave government help us, need help other. 

If people want morally bankrupt ignorant need compensate take personal responsibility actions. 

One way help confront untruth. untrue person socially distances. virtuous. get socially distancing. providing misinformation masses member media. instead giving corporations trillions dollars put majority hands people.

put debit card 2 weeks % money gets taken don‚Äôt spend it. 

money trickles corporations restaurants food pick up. 

not hard. you‚Äôre tool throwing ‚Äúmacro micro‚Äù economics sound like onto something.  documentary effect SARS CV anything like SARS patient end lung damage. living medication rest lives. people think get COVID Myrtle Beach won‚Äôt come Myrtle Beach  100% correct. 

Fundamentally Fox News feeds viewers content makes feel like they've wronged, democratic boogeyman take away guns children source ""true content"". criminal. Also like serving pizza gay person potentially kill family. i‚Äôm NJ went shop rite today saw man mask on... it‚Äôs ridiculous, wear damn mask hour done it, really don‚Äôt see big deal Sorry, bringing sick animals dad. Short term debt really problem.  Countries go cycles whole balanced budget crowd doesn‚Äôt understand macroeconomics. Unfortunately debt GDP levels high, plenty revenue sitting top draw on. economist worth salt would argue otherwise. friends got new guitars amps I‚Äôm like still got 6 months winter get dudes. Stashing 10k rather giving money back corporations actually profit situation. Also lack awareness taxation gonna fuck lot people think. Wait, owe 4 grand? Banks bailed out. humans? Yeah, we‚Äôre billionaires want travel I've always felt everyone work restaurant 3-6 months. would create much pleasant environment. Part family law back greeting hugs kisses. (I'm okay outside garherings distance). 

It's frustrating see. niece bartender Keys they‚Äôve closed bars, restaurants, movie theaters, whole bunch things still open. would think social gathering places would across board make difference. I'm sorry, let phrase this; Fuck you, fuck off, fuck outta here. insult people act like shitbag, too. Cram concern twat.

Serving military give carte blanche asshole. Dude media absolutely political agenda. Everything NBC Fox social media like Reddit political agenda. Case point post suggesting BLM protests something spike cases deleted political. Huh?

My position media need stop pretending thousands people protesting next contribute spread covid. told leaders large gatherings dangerous spread covid protests (which large gatherings) ok cause increase cases. complete BS. BLM protests ok. lockdown protests bar closure protests. ones definitely ok - according media 

You somehow think BLM. think message behind good human rights important. agree looting rioting. also think standing shoulder shoulder thousands people pandemic, matter protest, stupid help spread virus. businesses refuse service people wanna wear clothing wearing mask protect issue? Utah's [cases per million capita](http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=states-normalized&amp;highlight=Texas&amp;show=us-states&amp;y=both&amp;scale=linear&amp;data=cases-daily-7&amp;data-source=jhu&amp;xaxis=right&amp;extra=Utah#states-normalized) almost level Texas. concerning, even numbers seem low. ridiculous keep trumpeting younger people getting infected good thing lol.

More younger people getting sick think elderly vulnerable actually cautious. Also, elderly people aren‚Äôt chomping bit go get drunk friends bars. right now, cases rising among 35 due general selfishness arrogance millennials.

Don‚Äôt worry though - they‚Äôll bring home parents grandparents see numbers start rise week two. mean stay Covid, stay forever last week, kinda want want wrestling go flames start scratch believe science trust government rely evidence make recommendations. personally work two months, I'm back work wear mask scrubs full time, even though live area Canada risk COVID actually extremely low. ""Houston cruel, crazy town filthy river east Texas zoning laws culture sex, money violence. shabby, sprawling metropolis ruled brazen women, crooked cops super-rich pansexual cowboys live code west‚Äîwhich mean anything need mean, pinch."" -Hunter S. Thompson, 2004

That actually high form praise HST, very, dark sense humor. Houston issues big city part US, one thing lot places missing individual, personable hospitality. Based comment history, take regardless. ""I visited Brandis Exotic Show Lounge got lousy Covid"" report US alone likely 20 million cases. I'm sure plenty larger countries reporting is. 

Brazil came nowhere tripling numbers month already half cases US. Russia 7,000 10,000 daily cases since April 30th. India's total cases doubled three weeks increasing thousand daily. read requirements Norway, misunderstood. thought max 20 per 100,000 course two weeks. actually 40 two weeks. average per week across 2 weeks 20. text, translated:

Incidence rate past 14 days (average last two weeks) &lt;20/100 000 per week.

Then makes sense Denmark, V√§sterbotten within requirements. Norwegian Institute Public Health commented included green zone, said increasing trend. That's norm type triage. point reality comes crashing wall group fiction evaporates, there's ""The Secret"" quantum nonsense fix things. Creating new capacity hard, beds, new nurses, new doctors, new supply requirements, amounts documents required probably grow twice fast. forget pandemic, countries less likely send help. US doomed collapse. tip: stop fogging tuck mask underneath glasses Rome visiting family almost 2 weeks now, going shops, Vatican etc constantly wearing mask (except eating restaurant something) god uncomfortable heat. difficult breath whole beard gets messed up. 

But, anyway anything beats getting spreading Covid-19 loved ones. heard, climate change caused 5g towers! j/k Bronx. It‚Äôs traumatic silence traffic broken every five minutes sirens. Anyone else tired winning?  Haha yep. Waking bunch hair neck still surprise. longest ever been. too! shall pass, say. need make shirt ‚ÄúI got COVID Myrtle Beach‚Äù Easy, following guidlines shut prove properly institute them. funnily enough people believed hcq told got trolled sub never understood religious people adamantly believe they've told, nothing green earth convince otherwise.

The assumption know confirmation know nothing.. Jon snow  ""Bing"" COVID response. say 'we beautiful', know US pathetic country doomed fail. Amazing news .. Rt 1.00 ? also testing magically create cases, always know were.

And protests even reason spike mean still implement methods limit spread, cases still exist. essential travel. bad people shitting on. I'm glad live area big Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese population. always mask game little corner cal  Yeah wish governor would mandate masks statewide don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going happen share source ICUs full parts California, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia? seen that. Anyone else tired winning yet? really low males? Maybe people hang seems shockingly low. low guess im wrong. ""... older Corona patients responded badly intensive care different care preferred humane reasons.""

Hint... man received intensive care first denied it, responded well, went recover disease.

Now he's alive ask denied first place.

How many older patients could survived received intensive care? We'll never know, died without receiving it.

But man (and others like him) show blanket assertion like utterly ridiculous. ""Try something new? We've already tried practically nothing all. want us????"" ""Conclusion

Although retrospective analysis, results suggest early diagnosis, early isolation early treatment COVID-19 patients, least 3 days HCQ-AZ lead significantly better clinical outcome faster viral load reduction treatments.""

Surprising, contradicts studies lib, wear mask. 

Doesn't make sense, know sense totally unnecessary! Come beach, stay Covid... isn‚Äôt actually true, though. Protests may decrease social distancing participants said protest, also increase social distancing everyone else often net positive effect social distancing overall

It‚Äôs bit amusing, protests actually *good* reducing spread COVID-19. they're purposely misreporting protest zones counting cases bars / restaurants. Considering based honesty person tested, many people tell doctor, ""oh yeah, protests."" Ny‚Äôer dealt months southerners saying ‚Äúdeserved it‚Äù, honesty okay getting pittance. anyone information countries US (and think maybe Brazil?) politicize masks? Obviously people refuse wear mask country, anyone hear politicians, conspiracy theorists, etc. masks way US has? lol fucking say don‚Äôt fight virus ignoring rules...The virus sets parameters.

We'll stated. agree option. 

 means dramatic debt incurred, however nothing better suggest. guess even biggest dumpster fires could use little extra gasoline  dumbass doesn‚Äôt think younger people serious medical conditions also like diabetes (Type &amp; II) &amp; obesity, smoke even. 

What saying COURSE KNOWS. doesn‚Äôt give rat‚Äôs ass cuz he‚Äôs even bigger Trump lapdog Mike Pence. ChiCom nonsense So, yeah, live half mile bar. number one shit show town absolutely shock.

The kids go DGAF. sure busy first day open. disappointed surprised. Things like these. think people trust news. 


Any huge congregation good intention result mass spread coronavirus. People keep crying ""I'm locked up!"".  7 miles bike morning. Took time enjoyed ask people tested positive attended protests rallies? That‚Äôs two-way street bud. testing capacity maybe many Austinites strong Texas accent. supposed surgery March. phlebotomist preop labs saying Covid hoax. Surgery cancelled got rescheduled redo labs. phlebotomist again. wanted ask still thinks it‚Äôs hoax. blows mind people medics field idiots it. River tubing

I thought water slides something. hell tubing? Google gives stuff plumbing Americans fucking stupid? 250-300k casualties year over. mere 100 911s, biggy guess? WAY hot eat outside. would miserable. simply don‚Äôt like dining without air conditioning. less fucked Arizona They‚Äôre probably anti good grammar too!   Deaths ‚Äúlagging indicator‚Äù (because victims linger ventilators month dying). 

Instead, use rise number positives tested. Increased testing yield cases, increased number people tested *should* lower rate positives. metrics rise, you‚Äôre trouble scissor lift! That's good point still think like everyone knows gun legislation probably exist Republicans get fun parent wishes could stay late eat ice cream mom (dems) know needs bedtime. thing taxes. 

Unless think types guns available case disagree. I‚Äôm tired winning US is. cause effect. serve trash make cheapest, convenient, readily available food. 

Yes, make conscious decisions 9-5 world paycheck paycheck living, easiest choice. I've taken opportunity get back shape, take vitamins, bolster immune system. Yeah, crazy. Indiscriminate, preventable death happening singular source, one wants take seriously see eyes. actually lot people still can't communicate other. Like 20% US households high-speed internet. I‚Äôve learned though 30% Americans callous really care dies, long isn‚Äôt them. true might watch undertaker vs Goldberg 2 It‚Äôs small chain. I‚Äôve reported board health daily basis. I‚Äôve even contacted numerous congressmen, mayor, governor. Still, nothing happening. cannot deal this. feel like depression spiraling control that‚Äôs already untreated due cost. COVID would severally put back financially miss work need pay treatment, let alone actual health risks. feel fucked. known work would bad, wouldn‚Äôt come back, felt choice since one stipulations unemployment involve answering ‚Äúhave turned work?‚Äù It‚Äôs like honest doesn‚Äôt matter.  probabilities use come conclusion? Kids get it, they're likely die traffic accident way game die coronavirus caught playing. They're also likely die flu coronavirus, consider whether keep playing sports flu. (Though obese otherwise risk yourselves, might concerns kids' health.) Long-term health consequences also rare probably long-term risk response coronavirus (lack exercise, socialization, exposure common germs, etc.) coronavirus itself.

Over-sheltering judgment call need make based they're taking far many parents also over-sheltering kids. read [this don‚Äôt care think it‚Äôs old people dying, think I‚Äôd like treated get older. It‚Äôs mostly indoor gatherings. True, watch distances DeSantis now. supporters dumb, actually believe Trump never supported him. next week, Covid-19 eats way arsehole within year recovery. Fify Easy Tiger morons quarantine said ‚ÄúLook cases are! deaths! lockdown sham unconstitutional!‚Äù, ever stop consider maybe cases deaths... quarantine? Typically 50/50 survival rate Fair. put risk though? Also still vague idea long term impacts. 

The risk/reward simply make sense. Little league back next year. I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre trolling now. mean, kind lot countries Europe special epidemic laws. possible force certain kinds medical intervention onto people. Though, far aware of, none actually use individuals. [Fuck hold couple years necessary catch socially later road. lose friends it. happened little girl happened mine, Im sure would survive it. true all. live racist community people definitely going protests (BLM ones bitching SIP rules). issues (at least live) arrogance selfishness. People don‚Äôt want wear masks socially distance. want get hair nails done go eat. SIP rules started ease people got together sans masks, that‚Äôs cases started spike. listening coworker go conspiracy theory China Japan purposefully released COVID, ‚ÄúhOw mAnY iT‚Äôs WoRsE aMeRiCa???‚Äù

As masks aren‚Äôt part culture surprise. need close travel states. real joker leader

so i'm complicit simply he's president? can't blame BLM movement Trump consistent COVIDS existence

sure can, nothing wrong that. still spikes deaths BRAVO!!! 

Thankfully one thoughtful human amongst us. There's alot factors go this. best consult doctors.

Age, lying health conditions, Current condition.

It's automatic death sentence, obviously never good go ventilator general. God speed. 2016  alpha Florida man. intentionally let happen, past point USA NUMBER ONE Agree disagree lol PTSD coronavirus March. scary af main reason went hospital thought heart attack, anxiety culminating panic attack. 

Was definitely emotional roller coaster. worst day, 2 weeks in, took several hits lsd instead going hospital, spend last days hospital alone. 

I got ptsd foreign hospital 2017, tied pumped ketamine 3x acute stress syndrome/panic attack, cut up, ER. Dumbest shit ever, fucked subconscious level. Can't sleep without meds due excessive norepinephrine pumps regardless think about, 3 years later. used flashbacks shower moved arm head position tied down, nearly pass want puke instantly. Given Florida known deliberately cheating numbers, hard use metrics way defend them, no? saw picture yesterday basically folks packed together like sardines masks (because water) lined steps tubes get river.  That‚Äôs spreads tubing. Wonder many deaths withdrawals Lots kids survived coronavirus. okay. bet lot less inbreeding Japan versus USA. quite honest, seen plenty ICU. said, experience neurosurgical surgical ICU can't speak medical intensive care unit. cops enforce general public actually follow mandate? hate argument much, standard anyone ever consistently applied lives point history, nobody ever will.

It literally impossible set child's life zero risk death. parent's job mitigate risk reasonable choices. (and they're pretty bad it, that's another story. Vaccinate kids, install pool, drive speed limit). happen became focused rights obligations fellow man woman

The fact article supporting sentiment one upvoted things reddit right beyond disturbing. happened ‚ÄúAsk country ‚Äì ask country‚Äù? 
For one loudest countries patriotism, Americans sure like destroying they're proud of. Yeah, that's virus media works: ICU beds fill stay full weeks, media reports that. Mask wearing seemingly simple clearly effective way slow down. Yet great country, people made political statement president fans flames stupidity every turn. fear doomed.   flu tho ;) Graduate degrees don‚Äôt mean shit. Masters I‚Äôm dumb fuck kids classes got Masters degrees also dumb fuck. Flabbergasted. Would ironic banned started coming back mask, kept mask pandemic. probably would happened regardless, yeah make seem okay. young people inside long time summer. Hard say going friends. hope they're cautious around elders testing positive. also obese many kids think died virus? Playing sports added risk, likelihood child dying virus extremely low. plus it‚Äôs lot easier test, trace, track numbers low. need people stay vigilant going work sick going get tested soon think symptoms.

Unlike southern states, theoretically able get small outbreaks without shut entire country province. 

Can‚Äôt really you‚Äôre posting thousands new cases daily hospitals nearing 100% happened two weeks ago? June 13? like got handed call bubble wrap, decided take bubble wrap smash concrete floor. Ironically it'll voted relaxed visa entry requirements know come arrogant online, like said outlet get thoughts way won‚Äôt affect rest life. Really well written. bad he‚Äôll voted it. There's hard data back 90% things sub likes talk about. Shut down. obese  even know ü§£ standard medical mask record number daily cases! winning! Americans tough, skip work cough.

lol! call tough. call desperate.

If lose job, sick one day many, lot people would rather pretend healthy starve. think Cena WWE? soon sais something negative publicly he's ""injury"". people dining inside restaurants drinking inside bars parties (unmasked) country people protesting outdoors. 

OpenTables got good stats active dining cities - work portion restaurants. Masks better keeping keeping out. They‚Äôre beneficial indoors large crowds. prevent people don‚Äôt already getting it. 

When you‚Äôre nearest person like, 50-100 feet away, they‚Äôre next useless. thing you‚Äôre protecting point air. Personally, wouldn‚Äôt risk it. wouldn‚Äôt even risk state that‚Äôs rather well moment, let alone state that‚Äôs hotspot. kids may like understand it, boils safety issue...there heartbreaking stories families completely ravished COVID-19, way many stories include family members passing away it. Seems like way much high risk-low reward scenario. like masks hide double chin I‚Äôve developed quarantine. course. Vince McMahon sociopath like CEOs. I'm 20, sit home every day helping around house actually minor understanding grim pandemic is, everyone graduating class goes parties vars downtown. bars reported staff positive refuse acknowledge close. girlfriends store connected another store entrance, one closed didnt. would making profit right limited employees per day switched online also refuse acknowledge county highest daily increases per capita right whole state. happens incompetent asshole brag winning anything over. Possible, someone downvoting everything new fucking smart, dude. like one I‚Äôve ever interacted Sorry, realize acceptable amount violent mass murder. I'd take case case basis. want know exactly sport is, setup practice play is, precautions taken.

Is point kid would exposed immediate breath another kid prolonged period time? point kid would sharing unventilated air supply prolonged period time? probably let kind play. not, probably would. really understand logic behind wearing mask. feel like politic statement? easy fucking wear one. i'm near future, confirm. civil war incoming. buy bitcoin. work educated people. TIRED seeing go eat, go parties, socialize, etc without masks and/or social distancing. keep posting Facebook. None friends seem problem this. encourage it. I‚Äôm sitting absolutely baffled. people far smart.... know better. But, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs intelligence anymore. think it‚Äôs sense entitlement, ‚Äúme first‚Äù mentality, lack empathy. supposed return office August frankly don‚Äôt feel comfortable. imagine things even worse then, maybe won‚Äôt to. knows.

I acknowledge lucky able work home past months. cannot believe highly educated people work taking pandemic seriously. legislator literally telling us give rights Americans worst Americans. say American. Hmmmmm.... first protests favor activity increases spread disease protests.

The wasn't.

That's first criticized promoting spread isn't. Arrogant assholes area  Everything bigger Texas! Ignorance, idiot density resulting death toll also. Exactly. nothing other. voting right politicians instead ones pro 2A important. 

Candidate running campaign promotes cheap healthcare funding education, wants make background checks extensive.

Candidate B wants cut funding many public works, pro 2A.

Who vote for? I'm Netherlands one cares more. Like past. masks, distancing, nothing. Thank Satan virus over, we're go holiday smh Well, national medical research labs.

And universities.

But hey, medical research corporations, please ignore others, count, give money stupid fuck. Nationalizing expensive medical research means can't patent hold knife throat demanding money make year insulin.

What you, kind commie, wanting people actually survive without making us rich process? Time Fox News accidentally leak real name people find home, commie.

--Sincerely, Corporate America.

PS Please forget national research labs universities, really really want money would given them. I'm gonna honest. dont give shit anymore. now, theres putting genie back bottle. one let run course point. pandemic way far control. fully support BLM; however it‚Äôs ignorant say didn‚Äôt cause spread non American, ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù always seemed individual, kinda makes sense Absolutely. People saw protests TV, they‚Äôre seeing considerably greater number people restaurants, going house parties, vacation etc every single night. protests drop bucket 40 percent country told it‚Äôs hoax, it‚Äôs flu, deaths inflated, testing much, wearing mask violation constitution, gyms bars essential businesses. 

The country also greedy fuck decided letting hundred thousand people die OK stock market stays high business owners keep making profits. never received first one lol. Vote 3rd party Deja Vu. Looks like we're going keep reading vacations headline another week  gathering people risks spread virus.

Unfortunately anti-protests folks, however, evidence suggests safety protocols taken protesters mostly worked risk spread virus protests far smaller tried pretend was. rights usually understood end point start inflicting harm others? mask order protecting harm. wear mask potentially harm others. 1-2-3 Corona! Disneyland changed plans governor said they‚Äôd changing opening requirements. governor never something like that. We‚Äôre headed straight cliff Desantis thrilled. Excellent correct move. Science! There's huge difference thousand 60k. seeing Minneapolis even reach 10k.

Cases rise there. even mild symptoms recovered still got danger impact results? way they've acting bar compared insane well. lockdown maybe one night week shit show, afterwards people getting crazy every single day. Last night pretty chill though we've spike cases, course bothered safe that. Pretty grim, matter done states runaway infections they‚Äôre completely fucked now. Give another month people dying streets. changed couple days ago. Everyone required wear mask. brother girlfriend :( Lol would even know given virus hasn‚Äôt even around 7 months Never eyeball day arent best friend actually this. He‚Äôs leave one year deployment electrical work research facilities. Yeah bad ranting, yeah hope people take proper precautions get mess together Yeah. Thinking more, think right that, since he's high risk occupation, normal activities would acceptable others phased reopening (not full lockdown) still unwise him. Someone works home area cases *might* able limited social bubble visit people time time, reporter needs report rallies. 

Snack dumb too, though whatever reason I'd kind assumed like vending machine something. Looking again, really say.

However, much bigger picture level, would happy could get handle high risk indoor events..... churches, bars, parties, restaurants, offices, theaters, gyms. Letting people decide definitions social distancing high risk places clearly working. visit anyone person days, though thankfully live alone, national policy standpoint, I'm okay people visit select friends family members person (hopefully outdoors) stay sane, means Americans agreement mask-wearing keeping riskiest venues closed longer, rather big, hasty reopenings across country. also think would prevent people feeling socially deprived even slightest lifting restriction results crowds parties people feeling like pandemic over. wish people would view set necessary sustainable lifestyle adjustment near future, Full Zombie Apocalypse Lockdown mode month, Mission Accomplished Partying immediately after. Clearly giving people stimulus checks meant simply flood economy unlimited amounts money. Thank correcting me. curfew Care-For-You. Im gonna say hasnt.

But LITERALLY EVERYONE SAYING SOON.

And was. bent knee loud group morons. cough March headaches since I‚Äôve seeing things corner eye move like every three days. I‚Äôm bored isolating home could this? probably it? went dinner friend couple weeks got super sick. live Ontario, largest populated province Canada. 111 cases pop. 14 million yesterday. difference went lockdown stayed there. early mid May, things open grocery stores. May, retail stores allowed open strict guidelines. 2 weeks ago bars restaurants open, allows patios 50% capacity. #IT'S 9000 Floridian here. increases started blamed testing, reporting nursing homes reporting migrant workers live close proximity others.

Now it‚Äôs younger people infected higher survival rate, it‚Äôs great news! /s /eyeroll 

Meanwhile back reality, fired coder said told count positive tests once, person tested (negative) multiple times, every test counts; whereby skewing numbers. person says proof. DeSantis said insubordination.

So yea, checking armpit nation. see still don‚Äôt shit together. Death negative outcome COVID. sure drive... wearing seat belt watching speed vehicle that's inspected yearly. kind point first comment. take precautions driving another less dangerous activity. Treating life though COVID exist needlessly risky driving without observing associated safety measures. *everyone puts hands circle* trump says something bet opposite it. Wait two weeks 

Just wait see Hi. mind reviewing post submitted? I‚Äôm economist definitely understand works.  But, yes, it‚Äôs possible. did. opinion piece full even ridiculousness. 

‚ÄúFerguson, 2005 said 200 million might die bird flu (about 100 did), asked New York Times March best-case scenario US COVID pandemic.

‚ÄúAbout 1.1 million deaths,‚Äù responded.

As June 10, Ferguson factor ten. continue listen schools already proven disastrously wrong anyone‚Äôs guess. ‚Äúchicken little‚Äù story comes mind.‚Äù

Does author believe stopped disease June 10th? believe cumulative deaths still reach 1 million? author similarly reject New York‚Äôs hospital system overwhelmed, along parts world increasingly south?

To make claim overestimating possibility dearth ‚Äúa blunder scale Iraq war‚Äù completely neglects acknowledge hundreds thousands already dead growing cases every day. Seriously. area shutdown joke. Almost business could classify essential, were, however, massive amounts professional offices sent employees work home. wearing mask home. CDC Needs make masks mandatory nationwide want go lockdown again. Even vaccine immediately ready right now, would half year could implemented global scale. Says inventor virus.. someone came back U.S. move permanently March 12 (!), marooned indefinitely, I'm watching thing like hawk. hope works out.   Even though weekend numbers usually lower week. I'm really holding breath next week. Especially leading July 4th going horrible USA. highly doubt - tax situation screwed it‚Äôs due economic fallout. Let make perfectly clear though - want everyone vaccinated. want vaccines required kids go school. want military vaccinated well veterans. think countries prevent people showing unless they‚Äôve vaccinated. see reality people resist despite best intentions. I‚Äôm going wet bed that. ""normal"" mean exactly? covid causes long term damage mean even think outdoor dining wearing mask? Would crazy get haircut go dentist, even though might taking proper precautions? single, accept next long give hope finding love? really unsatisfied answer: ""well decisions going you, based much risk willing take."" know answer, still frustrating. He‚Äôs mandating insurance companies stop covering pre-existing conditions repealing though. Yep üòÇ someone ever says ""I know rights"" ask ""and responsibilities?"" lets nice, letting ppl die. murderer Correct. But, transmission air. It‚Äôs(possibly) everything touch.  Big boy Burbank? I've lived canada since 4 even got mine pretty quickly. rest world isnt either.... It‚Äôs like, would choose find hysterical mental gymnastics conspiracy website trust traditional journalism mainstream scientists world? What‚Äôs logic there? talk social media solid mental faculties. conclusions logic bonkers. Shame can't kicked world I've lived canada since 4 even got mine pretty quickly.

 

I've lived canada since 4 even got mine pretty quickly science cool thing, Oxford vaccine built [existing vaccine platform already underwent clinical trials made modifications re-key COVID-19, essentially, began recent round trials. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* heard thing called inflation? taken history economic courses before? went back restaurant job California yesterday. waiting everything close back go home see Jim Carrey eating rhino butt permanent damage almost worse dying, limited chronic aliments due covid, prisoner body, die much prematurely result Even though I‚Äôm young, I‚Äôm afraid dying covid I‚Äôm afraid lungs damaged. 

that would suck. Isn‚Äôt vaccine suggested testing African populations? one got loads backlash due racist sounded? I've lived canada since 4 even got mine pretty quickly. +1992 Georgia, +1600 SC. think states lost. go Right? Treat others like want treated. Locked nursing homes agree agreement 100% already posted protests going month also group constantly complaining we've 'ruined economy flu'. Hey Bubba, wanna keep closing down, wear mask keep distance! guess point is, restaurants closed dine-in service it‚Äôs risky everyone involved. employees still need paid. perfect world, would able receive unemployment benefits due pandemic making unsafe work. Unfortunately it‚Äôs perfect world, don‚Äôt answers, need decent fellow humans. choices dangerous child? don‚Äôt see comparison here. lost job hours reduced &amp; u make less 2k? students getting $1250 though. height crisis NYC, NYC less 20k tests day got 8k new cases Florida performed 80k tests (4x many) yesterday got 9.5k cases. NY cases mid-April grossly undercounted due lack testing used barometer. quoting Obama AA also requiring everyone wear mask duration flight banning refuse follow rule. see met neighbors. also parties almost every weekend.

We doomed. troll stupid. People genuinely suffering Trump's shit response. know wears mask encourages others trump holding mass gatherings discouraging masks.  can't compare two all. 

Are still waiting clear Easter? disappear? Cause that's trumps plan. Without parachute. Wait, flights still going there?


Allllrighty then. hope save hospital equipment resources sending home without treatment. sad

can trust right thing people. everyone got agenda. ain't party like Nana's tea party I'm one said ""no way."" assumed least eyeballed way. Almost besides point, can‚Äôt believe WWF still popular is. Hi Spain. Slime on, banana slugs! Ah yes, Lena. Thank USC. hard enough getting enough people wear mask. doubt find enough willing fight military lol. Well, embarrassing. right. downright shameful poorly Americans handled crisis. president. governors.

No real mask/social distancing mandate. RATION FUEL? WANT GO DRIVE! CAR, ABLE DRIVE MUCH WANT. JABE MONEY YIU GIVE GAS!   
      
WHY BLACK WINDOWS NIGHT? WANT FRESH AIR! DONT GET FRESH AIR DIE HYPOXIA! amazing, true.

The difference perception numbers discussed... always controlling perception.

When talking scary things, like many people caught virus, understated numbers. talking reassuring things, like ""herd immunity"", overstated numbers.

They saying ""we've hundreds thousands cases getting closer herd immunity"". Instead they'd simply give prediction ""herd immunity"" would arrive, always matter weeks - is, basically saying ""don't worry, almost over"".

But talked many cases were, would talk ""plateaus"" ""flattening curve"", saying ""it's almost over"".

The fact claims totally contradictory shows really thought Swedish people ~~dumb~~ ""trusting"". employer would probably give promotion coming in. spouses work office one still coming tested positive. stupid be?? let go playground. might fall crack head open. Well made crappy video watermarked stock picture, dramatic lo quality music synthetic voice telling said, would believe 110% Natural selection you? don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs big risk child family members. problem anyone joining group activities becoming vector. live multigenerational household see grandparents regularly, probably bad idea group sports. partner underlying health condition, thing. consider actions one family member impact whole family. I'm sure racist this... least directly.

""Show money!"" Yeah pass risk onto someone poorer you. Corona-chan going viral Give time. infections protests start showing soon. simultaneously protects covid hides *disfigurements* That‚Äôs worse. much agree depends person question, generally, agree. Maybe lucky, yet meet person ugly seeing naked could potentially put life danger ;-) keep kids inside greatly limit time near others, making sure wear masks keep distance, play sports they‚Äôre near kids pick virus get sick possibly die (kids immune died this). also pass family friends. I‚Äôm sure something you‚Äôre debating.

People spent DECADES isolated others small prison cells, hardly human contact. You‚Äôre wondering months house kids see family, play games, watch tv, call friends using voice video, etc. 

this shouldn‚Äôt even something question....... MuH FrEeDuMbZ.. informed wear mask Americans entitled  What's point trying make stats? Cuz political party it, it‚Äôs ok. Goddamn it, stupidity thing we're exceptionally good at. Stop denying us exceptionalism. get this... waking morning risky. Kids kids forever. idea lock vaccine arrives (which may never happen) borderline child abuse.  let people go time ICU.

No one euthanized ICU ""snowing patient"".

Sedating patient point longer responsive thing euthanizing them. survive hospice return hospital

If survive hospice 6 months, doctor take hospice. unethical malpractice force someone go hospice refuse care want care. outside view ICU elderly know inside.

In state, ICU like. family members ICU months chance living. elderly relatives get surgery chance surviving. hospital going take someone court force go hospice state. years working hospital, never seen heard happening. plenty patients 0 chance ever type quality life full code. 

You obviously either live America making stores. one forced go hospice family want that. informed all.

You really think doctor informed going patient? Learn tell better lies. jump insults rather actual discussion? must really gullible believe everything read. Galileo arrested death theories astronomy. Today, know theories correct. Acting way human species lost. I‚Äôm saying theory 100% correct, said it‚Äôs theory. Nonetheless, numbers add up. don‚Äôt need master statistician realize number cases China correlate correctly based upon countries‚Äô data. spike one day steep drop possible due way Covid-19 spreads delayed inoculation. Please research educate yourself.

Please tell kind elaborate troll every day least next month likely considering we‚Äôre still seeing little movement combat surging numbers risk/reward driving kid little league make sense? kid likely die from, car accident COVID? think losing job. engrained culture go work dependable employee. needs change. Americans listening sound advice? Shock. tell me; count deaths it‚Äôs related bankruptcy, unemployment, social isolation, whatever? Never assume it‚Äôs easy propose. 

Depending situation make decision country, sometimes hard lockdown alternative sometimes it‚Äôs not. feel bad slightest. sympathy here, sorry. I‚Äôve heard two goals get drunk get laid. They‚Äôve months reading books. Virus everywhere, man

Virus everywhere, man

Wear goddamn mask, man

Don't breathe indoor air, man

Travel? dare, man

Virus everyyyywheeeeeeere consolation, happens everywhere. worldwide problem. Demise boards. USA! USA! USA! news: Mae Young, 90 years old, would've beaten Trump's entire family whatever-on-1 handicap match. yes? want kill grandmas? Yes! Thank God. seems treatment getting much better NYC days. Fingers crossed. Masks, less older people getting it, virus may getting less lethal. ask anyone arrested past month social distancing works intake side process - jails? Kosovo

Kosovo 20-35% positivity rate last 14 days, indicates insufficient testing according WHO's 10% benchmark.

Kosovo reported 1057 new cases last 14 days. That's 58.4 per 100k population, originally announced 16/100k benchmark.

New outbreak Croatia originates Kosovo

But allow travel Kosovo? Why?

Ukraine Egypt raising numbers 16/100k benchmark? 

India, seem able contain virus even lock-down? Mother wore masked sneezed. Saw white couple looking mother disgust.... evidence contradict county health department interviewed article say? feeling? folks actually evidence thanks contract tracing. Oh fuck off. Millenials treated like trash without good reason yet societal scapegoat problems created everyone millenials? Sounds right. PhD complicated things. bad. new research, was¬†published¬†by National Bureau Economic Research, found evidence coronavirus cases jumped 315 cities weeks following first protests. I'm far enough away I'd stop gas once, figure alternatives rest areas (inner plumbing outer), absolutely competent safe country. I'm bringing (admittedly small) risk, right zero.

I probably isolate two weeks fall go see her. minor hardship compared some, love mom sucks. America still included ""free"" world? Cute Hard argue people can't count 3  hard problem solve. Texas numbers come several times day. need wait end day getting total. Canada population 37,000,000 north USA averaging 300ish cases 30ish deaths day lately.

Whats key difference? 40% dislikes video. Shaking fucking head. Wrong state. Exactly. Everyone acting like kid catching guaranteed death sentence available data shows much isn't. I'm confused people mean ""next wave"" daily numbers literally higher ever right now? ""next wave"" considered started soon places started reopening? Im aware come off, don‚Äôt really care I‚Äôm never going meet even wouldn‚Äôt know guy made comments someone trouble sleeping lately, popping edible taking long ass THC nap feels sooooo good. always greatest sleep compared nights lately amazing good question. would model it? Arizona? outbreak accelerating now. 
How going protect taking come home? SF 30k person protest 99.9% people wearing masks. Lol, didn‚Äôt take long. Made comment maybe like [3 hours ago saying I‚Äôm waiting DeSantis go fill Trumpism fueled years faux news Fuck 4th July, country international embarrassment there‚Äôs goddamn thing celebrate year. ashamed American. number set stone.

- people things spread virus more, R goes herd immunity threshold goes 
- conversely, people careful, number goes 
- people acting differently, therefore different personal values R, almost definitely decrease herd immunity threshold 
- hand, overshooting means whatever true value herd immunity is, almost double number virus finally stops vaccine? You‚Äôre cruel, now. I'm sure masks something get blamed parties. cognitive dissonance astounding. virus risk drop low enough worth trying live normally? virus go away own. Rebekah Jones shows data But..but...they opened restaurants must safe right? /s

Important lesson: take word pol safe eat out, go bar, theater, sports event etc immense pressure business groups open damn consequences! kind damage makes person cruel? Thank God! Nope, acknowledge participants felt like importance outweighed risk. people packing restaurants. countering regret oversheltering kids little league season compared regret child catching virus possibly long lasting negative health effects. OK, conservatives, one Texas places told quit fucking babies wear mask. quit crying masks uncomfortable unfashionable, wear God damned mask. understand difference outdoor protest masks indoor party without probably leave sub. want see compliant population is. believe people running around actually confronting others public wearing mask? truly sheep wolves world. surprise happening. Business /bars can't make money social distancing rules. really 2 options, ignore rules stay business follow rules go bankrupt read Japanese children taught good citizens early grades schooling. academics comes play slightly older. 

Might reason fairing better. Even states like PA hardcord lockdowns seeing increased cases months lockdowns.

We either lockdown vaccine, open care it. Temporary openings wont work. sure would consider ""caves"" category Florida beaches talking vacations even better Big spikes cases cities biggest protests.

Let's see it. data super easy find right. seems although cases resistance, wasn‚Äôt big issue like now. think leading reason death around you. Almost every home sick family member (eventually homes marked cases), trucks/wagons pulled collect dead bodies, dead bodies left porches left corner room days. sickness much faster deadlier, would give people immediate incentive wear mask. doesn‚Äôt seem masks back useful though mostly made gauze. outlined ‚ÄúThe Great Influenza‚Äù John Barry, worthwhile read lot parallels (including government ignoring problem.) sharing border nothing it, people travel planes now. 

Also, sharing border China, control, bad sharing border US Brazil. Well said. There's like 15% us cynical realistic eniuigh called shit beginning.

In March said we'd huge upswing July right countries starting open up.

This ruin us. takes us months restart economy (or whatever left Mass foreclosures) much behind rest world. no-mask folks tripping valiant help fellow American 9/11.

Meh. lot people grieve porn followed nationalistic circle jerk 'terrorists want take away freedoms'! 
 
Followed government reacting with... taking away many freedoms. Good question? happy got people stop smoking restaurants. many important things selfishness. Pretty much... I've Asia plenty times, people common courtesy wear mask they're sick, air quality good day, especially Korea. Instead wearing sometimes wore time. complaints rights all.. lol. mention Houston. massive protest Houston. saying Houston ""not surged"" too?

There protests almost every major city America. weeks.

I buy argument protests spread coronavirus much things like private parties opening early. masks outside. mainstream media outlets try tell protests spread virus contribute current surge *at all,* call bullshit.  problem don‚Äôt care guy dies. ‚ÄúOh mask doesn‚Äôt help help someone else? Nope-don‚Äôt it. mild discomfort feel worth someone else‚Äôs life might save.‚Äù Yup. Individualism- cool. /s Perfect üòë tested every dead person COVID, would expect 0.05% infected die ""with"" COVID it. number highly approximate: positive COVID test around two weeks, two week period 0.05% population (almost old people obviously) die.

But actually impossible say one person whether happened die COVID, died COVID. died COVID, we're certainly undercounting deaths essentially everywhere, number would die COVID low mortality rate like 0.4% insignificant.

In Colorado actually two different numbers: deaths COVID, deaths COVID. appear significant undercounts, theory difference could used way estimate many total people it. gotten closer time, though, suggests process yet refined enough get number that's better guessing. definitely right ballpark. live A1A Broward, absolute zoo already weekend, mobs people without masks beach bars. There's way Broward close beaches well, right? Maybe Iowa teachers strike. Seems ridiculous. Seriously, im compassionate beyond point people, need see someone suffering Lol like 80% America.  Former president Barack Obama? \s  Yes! Avoid cloth masks. get authentic KN95 US Beware‚Äîlots counterfeits! Yes would Quintana Roo area beautiful friendly people protests US didn‚Äôt lead significant spread, any, able mimic protestors behavior gathering groups, right? Protestors gathered massive groups often close one another. Key factor masks. take protests example? Mass gatherings ok wear mask? Yep. presumed case 3 months ago recent blood tests indicate abnormalities body regarding kidney functions.  noticed seriously increased sensitivity heat immediately recovering, real challenge day day result getting sick.  Really option learning live it....  People need take seriously. model stupid decision making. R u gonna deduct fraudulent death counts...?? u every death u know true?? MSNBC told u huh.. lmao... face diapers unite Hopefully meeting followers discuss this.  video? Half population wears every day anyway. start feeling ill, wear mask. make sure friends work catch might have. Can't look ""cases"" trended basis -- really ""old cases newly reported."" look ""date onset"" adjust testing levels.

Better look Hospitalizations &amp; Fatalities. trended date less issues.

NPR goes here:  show numbers using specifically? thing everywhere across country, celebrating graduations partying summer lockdowns lifted.  definitely get stares well. I‚Äôm even visibly pregnant get stared like I‚Äôm crazy. NBA interacting local staff live interact local community. bubble. curve shot back up. Yesterday record amount Americans test positive covid. worse several months ago. Well usa fucked guess much can. Wear mask, basically bath anything touched sanitizer everytime leave bar. might help little ludicrous percentage Americans give fuck anyone that's themselves, model shows.

There #FTFY without idiots though, remember protests Queen's park Toronto open Ontario, short lived though. I've even worrying conventions supposed ""tyranny"" recent months. say see true. like others said fact government acted cohesively across party lines top down. Couple fact country founded believe peace, order good government would mandate nation general see played culture. factors alone made massive difference nation reacted. Ahahahahahahahahahhaha. actually believe that. Despite last three weeks full negotiation drama mixed person person getting sick.

Same fucking thing going WWE. delusional bunch always come out. Lib living florida here. send help guys know get states easily? even sell powder form mix 1L bottle lie teeth news flash, China COVID free never COVID free. put big giant fake face. happens virus tries go tissue body ACE2. succeeds immune system may attack damage tissues. may get long-term issues depending organ extend damage. Therefore anything diabetes multiple sclerosis, CFS/ME infertility table, reported. Asymptomatic """"""mild"""""" cases included. 

What percentage cases? know, want study means someone pay chronic patient's healthcare costs. Numbers mean nothing mean percentages Agreed much. Honestly last 7 years really shown majority people world (not US) selfish gladly throw somebody bus helps out. Every time watch futuristic scifi shows post apocalyptic shows, used think ""There's way people would behave like that"". Now? seems plausible, expected. amount family members (not immediate thank god, aunts/uncles/grandparents) revealed racist sexist since Trump presidency began really disheartening. Especially past year corona BLM stuff happening. 

And fault lie people either. US least, government control situation absolute dumpster fire. want people lockdown, give 1200 survive? Many people one, maybe 2 months worth rent saved up. There's way hell survive nearly year (which looks like may come that) lockdown. people sympathy for. people making political issue, ignoring social distancing, wearing masks. despicable really worrisome. Wish attitude towards entire state full people. Exactly! We‚Äôve already seen people want. Honestly, loss ends. He's one top vets state (not exaggerating, taken care state drug/explosive dogs long while, operated president's animal), trust ass either. sucks. know I'll able hang while, he's age that's significant part remaining lifespan. everyone know crowded house hot raining that's booze is. go back house two weeks hope get really sick infected hospital full then. explain doctors nurses wear mask 17+ hour long surgeries completely fine? One study Raoult team again? again?      
I see point retrospective analysis flawed study whatever, discussion interesting nonetheless. I'm PROUD state! real men statements bad others, like promotion idea certain thing real man woman. Really isn't... I've Asia plenty times people common courtesy wear mask they're sick, air quality good day, especially Korea. Instead wearing sometimes wore time. complaints rights all.. lol. greater Los Angeles area. starting see lot cases area. Things barely opening up. Bars even really open last weekend even though cases started rise. lot protests 2-4 weeks ago. clearly jump businesses reopening even though really reopened right time protests line time line perfectly. Plus first jump mostly young people 30 know protester demographic. Good. tr8r thing article. Speculation. medical field clear definitive proof must include peer reviewed study statistically significant findings. I‚Äôll patiently wait browse google study. one hand I‚Äôm pro mask hand government official saying ‚Äúwhen happen became focused rights‚Äù fucking terrible look. Anything let normalized used us future, need absolutely fucking certain trade worth it‚Äôll another patriot act Woah. That's asked know anything NYC. Sorry offended lol absolutely love cooking home. 

The day made Ratatouille. simple. gorgeous fresh tasting. work (worked, clinic currently shut due 3 coworkers testing positive covid) massage therapist +100 clients I've see past 5 weeks, 3 asked remove masks session. wear mine times company policy clients must wear mask entering leaving clinic, session. Everyone else complains wear it. He'll say that, he'll turn around talk quarantine measures conspiracy destroy America, claim virus death toll massively inflated. 

He really improved all. hoax, according Trump company. people still believe that. told people, slow stickers!! estimate current IFR based people already died, know many currently infected people today die number # cases, # infected Safer outside I'm restaurants bars till vaccine. number reported locally 85 cases moment expected. many hospitalizations deaths tho... It‚Äôs really weakness discomfort, it‚Äôs American society focuses individualism personal rights. Americans don‚Äôt care actions affect neighbors. It‚Äôs ‚Äúme‚Äù culture. Taking slight hit personal liberties fellow countrymen don‚Äôt die controversial topic, bizarre considering ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù comes military. Americans think ‚Äúserving country‚Äù going countries killing people. many countries don‚Äôt glorify imperialism militaristic show force, serving country means things, like idk, wearing face mask fellow countrymen live see another day. need HARSH penalties dont wear masks public. Turns takes one person start pandemic one hand, that's lot people. 

On hand, there's like 18M annual deaths Heart Disease.

People wear masks, COVID fairly easily avoided, then, deaths Heart disease... really needed invite Chinese authorities locked Wuhan. know deal Karen's. mask, reeducation. Feel warm, private bed you. NBA calling bubble bubble. NBA interacting local staff contained free go wherever please outside work hours. Yea, early studies focused reducing mortality, generally meant focusing patients already supplemental oxygen (or intubated). they've reached stage, know there's much that's going bring back brink. Hydroxychloroquine azithromycin, used conjunction, understand, cause heart problems, tends problem prolonged use. Much like remdesivir, relies early intervention, makes somewhat impractical given current state testing regime. still found silver bullet yet, finding things help. think blood thinners increasingly used course treatment promising early results steroid starts that's name escapes moment. Doctors fighting chance now, early intervention still key. won't. Us young ones ton turmoil get through. remain positive prepared situations. seem old one juvenile uninformed opinion. CDC Penn State studies saying 10 20 million people likely infected yet one turned goo street, eloquently suggest. Time build wall! say protestors wearing masks standing 6 feet apart it‚Äôs matter fact. Im sure this. remember watching protests people definitely shoulder although several wearing masks, all. want snack food texture I‚Äôd recommend wild rice mean... sounds worse tell dr bar restaurant rather protest. One someone ignoring social distancing fighting cause believe in... option ignoring social distancing want get takeout lazy... see friends bar zoom call? One fighting justice selfishness. know I'd way embarassed tell doctor got socializing vs protests. Think people's motives. leader heavy criticism downplaying virus fight back. refusing wear mask health everyone else. They're Making America Great Again... getting people sick. think high 86% NYC. numbers much lower thanks improved protocols. I'm Tomball, going HEB Specs scary since like maybe 40% wearing masks wearing correctly.  think assuming educated people intelligent people. It‚Äôs common mistake. Considering hospitals usually operate 50-70%... 40% additional crippling. health problems don‚Äôt go away virus here. so? hilarious see people defended BLM protests boast great China is. book one way ticket try protesting see well turns them.  can‚Äôt just... take them? 

Gun violence US epidemic proportions, obviously.

But sure seem like care ""muh rights"" human lives. Classic conservative position think objects matter lives.

Nutjob. Cocoa Puffs grocery store right now! Life sooooooo haaaaaaaaaard one barkeep talking hundreds people happen Yep, thank sorting out! 

Interesting Kroonbergs l√§n close. 

And yes, seems like accounting quite fuzzy requirements low infection rate.

Yep, IIRC Denmark testing positive/test done ratio 5% lower. doubt many Swedish regions fit criteria yet testing *is* steadily increasing. beginning crisis, evident vunerable old frail. first measure every country taken provide better protection nursing homes. abject failure governments launch targeted response - priority - order so. 

Many countries guilty - Sweden, UK, Ireland, Spain, Italy.. countries majority mortalities occur nursing homes. many cases, lack preparation serious lack training, equipment resources, including staffing. Covid patients released back nursing homes. complete mismanagement situation - evident number deaths countries within nursing home sector. 

There appears systematic problem across board. 

And stop - UK, elderly people, those[ *with cognitive coerced signing DNRs. 

In Ireland, government even poaching staff private nursing homes public sector, leaving many homes severely understaffed. government Covid response board - NPNET - representatives nursing home sector board, despite majority deaths occuring homes despite private nursing homes seeking place table. 

Sweden appears issues too. common denominator countries. 

Systematic failures like require systematic reviews carried independent commissions probe many people died care homes. doubt biggest failing area - better response, would seen lower spread infection within nursing homes lower mortality rate. Nothing rioting protesting I‚Äôm sure don‚Äôt catch close world keep control Looks like world know going cease exist won‚Äôt make new one. Nobody gives shit ‚Äúpositive‚Äù are. I‚Äôm sure aren‚Äôt prepared way. prepared die sick, starve, fucked death worked death. that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs future. That‚Äôs thats going happen anyone like you. ‚ÄúHow even consider ending session?‚Äù asked. ‚ÄúPeople suffering. Businesses closing. People weary tired ready get back normal.‚Äù

Ohhhhh! didn‚Äôt realize people want go back normal! bad! ‚Äî virus let everyone please, get close say

""Since forgot mask, please back leave little extra distance"" mean, would different BTW fan club members getting every available BTS seat. Clean inside pipe stem bong save stuff smoke case emergency (I.e. running weed). Thank later. That's yesterday's numbers. still gotten full count today. masks. piece garbage. big difference walking street mask sitting restaurant without mask. Yes Well, could invite Jacinda New Zealand, seems nice. me, (i work grocery store) need little firm people wont care There's actually article today shows lung scarring effects asymptomatic people necessarily true. it?  Mild inconvenience (mask) vs lifetime issues. Make smart choice. Yes, virus outermost laters meat anyway unless it‚Äôs ground, case cook well done Looks like Karenpocolypse addition, read many people generate antibodies level sufficient detected (they however generate t-cells) Reading comprehension must strong suit, I'll say again. Read slower time.

**If protests significant contributing factor, we'd see huge spikes cities biggest protests.**

That data easy find, right. So, prove wrong.

Unfortunately you, data exist. live fantasy world. He's concerned himself, seem concerned rest country. can't stand fucking people. Lots people...one crapper 

Big problem transmission media still picking favourites. true, also killing young people, unfortunately accept dying old people big deal get put jail say anything bad ""the authorities""

We like them

/s cities huge protests increases? really used dates x axis. Money read article, they‚Äôre literally advising people arrive full tank gas, food, water medicines wait. don‚Äôt worry, masks won‚Äôt mandatory went shut downs Georgia. Never mind record numbers coming department health. burying lead realize real outbreak map tab shows infections per 100k county map. Definitely don‚Äôt look want know, know stuff. /s 

I hate stupid state sometimes.  Watch happens Minnesota. cases drifting up, get exponential growth next week two means protesting big no. don‚Äôt, means outdoors completely changes level risk think us agree reopening plus protests caused surge cases. don‚Äôt understand disregard protests say protestors didn‚Äôt spread ‚Äòwearing masks keeping distance‚Äô simply isn‚Äôt true. claimed know going happen article. tentative conclusions may able draw based know viruses including coronaviruses based think interesting study.

I interested think two things though. atlanta daily cases doubled, google Heard weirdest take dad last night regarding recent local mask mandate: mandate people wear masks *because* need watch vulnerable community members. logic people various medical reasons cannot wear masks, mandate hurt can't make rules without thinking them! rule question specifically gives exceptions people. fully aware dropped take. turned worried about? poor people going *shamed* go without masks!

I several thoughts take, many people around area seem think masks kind personal attack unlikely ""shaming"" anyway. got condition makes mask use harmful condition makes at-risk enough mean minimizing trips absolutely possible alternative (like need see doctor)... TBH main thought is, ""oh, telling autistic ass society 100% wrong shaming disabled people following societal rules reasons control, people expected make make concessions like 'not going avoidable' make acceptable?"" mean, that's idea agree with, maybe first focus cases consequences whole bunch people following societal rule *not* spread deadly disease. Like, I'm hurting anyone stimming, argue society needs stop shaming that? know, instead spending years telling important act normal?? Hello. 1:30 = 90 mins weeks, sure people happy go out. Texas already seeing sharp decrease people making reservations OpenTable. never said struggling. Simply like mindset Americans gotten way politics turned sport. 

My wife fortunately employed still make good salary little debt. point would love work remote able another country. Meat safe eat fully cooked? Even outbreaks meat packaging factories? people thought Obama invading Texas

Come on, people morons half brain MUST know small % people causing problem. 

A MUCH larger % people partying Florida Arizona like Spring Break. 'rights' telling many 'fuck off' selfish masks annoying getting wasted trying pick someone bar. 

Don't naive. Ah yes, let's ignore DC, NYC, Portland countless cities.. Fun fact, DC portland still daily protests issues. macgyver fans country? FYI OP editorialized word millenials. appear story. 1/18 bad cardiovascular disease HAha @ logic, wrong country. Well shown numerous places infection controlled. ignore strategy pretty much guarantees 1M+ unnecessary deaths. addition huge burden hospitalizations, severe illness, long term sequelae. cherry top pretty much guaranteed much worse economy long term. 

So I'm sure ignore strategy coming ahead exactly? Besides ability nothing therefore try anything hard. Ok article mentioned WEEKS afterwards still shortness breath. actually know long-term implications long term study them. end article mentions doctor started follow-up patients begin long term study. record, I'm one ""those people"" I'm saying; need sensationalize this. bad enough. anything stick facts, gives anti-maskers ammo. Judging comments vague way people jumping train, lot people actually read article. trying mimic behaviors protests, going bars restaurants would out, main argument protests leading spikes occurred outdoors. 

As others pointed out, main places protests aren‚Äôt seeing spikes places mask mandates place, majority protestors masks on. However, areas mask mandates, seeing spikes it‚Äôs likely protests contributing factor.

Mask wearing crucial factor reducing spread, it‚Äôs become politicized issue lot false information wearing masks, enough people wearing masks public social distancing, going contribute cases.

Wear mask, wash hands, keep reasonable distance others, especially wearing mask. imagine contaminating kitchens called ""wuhaning"" I'm pretty poor guy, money would give 1,000 awards. Holy crap. real statement time. like...is it? don‚Äôt know we‚Äôre saying. road seem scary, least. realize vac likely better option. Um throughout American history... issue people going galavant everywhere summer freak kid going school. can't ways. said earlier thread related protestors, think it‚Äôs worth putting again.

If people don‚Äôt understand badly COVID going fuck America. Let tell you.

Continue protest ignore social distancing go crowded places without mask within year, half America without job. currently 60 million unemployed.

Millions going infected. die hospitals overloaded.

There million dead virus alone. including people die able get treated regular medical needs.

Those survive heavily debt, work without help unemployment ran months ago government doesn‚Äôt give send help. You‚Äôll see massive spike suicides.

Ask sounds important respecting Social distancing wearing masks.

We finding long term health implications contracting virus. written can‚Äôt help see reality going, don‚Äôt know will. I'm pretty sure doctor tell pneumonia pneumonia, sure delete covid completely. excess deaths causes combined still third seeing already half way Corona airways thinking way while. may able much summer, right thing summer, we'll future summers enjoy. wrong things, may well last summer. 70 testing sites total. HUGE protests HUGE cities WAY testing sites that.

So, huge spikes cities biggest protests, data would easy find.

It exist. live fantasy world. wear mask protect another who's system compromised. issues versus MANY not.  wear masks stores etc outside. That‚Äôs understatement Yup, even packed together protests. don‚Äôt worry covid doesn‚Äôt infect large crowds. Texas Republicans unbelievablely blind faults densely surprised encounter truth. TX-Rep herd good recognizing enlightened Rep, bet bottom dollar judge better get board out. heavily conservative states? Ones trust ‚Äúinstincts/morals‚Äù science? Package deal: Fly American acquire Coronavirus free Anyone get covid? anyone gets severe? Always. Rights rights. Period. death rate almost zero... got Covid back March, lost smell/taste, confirm: it‚Äôs psychologically draining. Even many things end smelling tasting like weird, almost hot metal flavor. It‚Äôs gotten point almost dread eating. try figure common thread might be, there‚Äôs correlation. heavy traffic, cat food, mac cheese exact unnatural smell, takes toll mentally. Haha still works! devil uses screw us all, eh? I‚Äôm pissed government making ass outta me. beginning year told multiple people masks weren‚Äôt effective going advice cdc. that‚Äôs clearly bullshit months hope didn‚Äôt hurt anyone. They‚Äôre going lose business either way. People aren‚Äôt going risk lives go restaurant shit hitting fan city. best outcome restaurants hope us get virus control quickly possible. dad puts tape along bridge nose doesnt fog up

Up want walk around duct taped face mask tho  I‚Äôm really sick seeing ‚Äúonly 1% die‚Äù argument. Y‚Äôall realize 1% US population died, that‚Äôd 3 million people, right? Wear mask want see players wearing helmets fall. It‚Äôs hard. Man considered heading finding another sub something? safer think bad stuff world caused people random chance. stop people bad things least try, random illness jumping animals humans time wipe 30-60% people like plaque did. think become pretty obvious recently, decades, judging Americans vote, vast majority care fellow citizens. suspect driven large part negative economic feedback loop, result class warfare. Possibly. really know percentage required herd immunity virus. could anywhere 30% 90%. Scary thought upper end range. Let‚Äôs keep protesting tho Oh, say complete yet. going get worse day day. wait school, K-12 college, start back up. There's pushing hard us face-to-face teaching classroom. yeah dude, 30 odd students ""bigger"" classroom going totally contain spread. 

We're fucked.

At point even see 2021 returning modicum normalcy. We're looking 2022 earliest. Mark McGowan absolutely smashing right? people known use hand sanitizer get intoxicated due alcohol content. pandemic,¬†hand sanitizer banned prisons¬†based fears inmates would drink use start fires. Centers Disease Control Prevention recommended facilities consider relaxing restrictions alcohol-based sanitizer help combat coronavirus. Good question. *ponder* Release exactly? must mean like 199k people die lower, sadly takes little one pass away covid, death rise later infections. No. You‚Äôre outside. Chances transmission exceptionally low you‚Äôre running, walking biking past someone split second. half country never did. called hoax beginning berated anyone tried follow scientific guidelines. played ultimate victims acting like virus created spite them. True american snowflakes. Data NYC support assertion -- ZERO increase reported cases 3 wks BLM marches. jail migrant children. like humanity 101.

An enormous number children arrive unaccompanied. law, CBP can't release streets. humanity 101. leave shelters, need go sponsoring family takes time background checks. Also humanity 101. States making excellent case continued self governance. dog, ate bee yesterday eating bee getting bit mouth like before, smarter DeSantis. Even rural locations, people go grocery store, fast food, church. like rural people Amish interact outside people.

 Hell, tribes deep Amazon getting infected. Nobody safe. probably ü§îü§îü§î try Yes, death count important, spiking infection numbers likely indicate large rise deaths occur soon. Thank USA demonstrate lowering number cases UE nothing summer heard? title hell earth transferred Australia US numbers trusted China? no, yesterday! Deaths died big difference. Tests accurate help. I'm sure post getting downvoted. historically vaccines side effects small number people. Things like MMR known totally safe point, take time sure long term side effects new vaccine. 

I'm antivax ALL, really hope October. understand hesitation. people expect protests millions people huddling together? 42% FL cases happened past two weeks people still clinging hospitalizations yet climbing FL.

Florida isn‚Äôt special, least way would make less susceptible poor outcomes virus, hospitalizations spike again.

Already hospitals hitting capacity, others bracing impact much larger wave looms. deaths much back upward trend again.

From conservative north Florida liberal south Florida swamp in-between cases exponential growth Ron-Ron still acting like it‚Äôs going make way vulnerable population

As young old people don‚Äôt chill together hour church every Sunday throughout FL. Singing big stuffy box, could go wrong. Hospitalizations decreasing ICU beds painting grim picture  Im sure Saharan dust blocking sky adding dread. Im sure situation suddenly becoming real many folks. Funny ones bring 9/11 never NY metro area. Congratulations, America. saw video talking reopened hand gesture like Trump. I'm thinking guy love Trump trying emulate much can. expect combination two factors:

1/ Time *the only* limiting factor vaccine development. as/if funding, admin actually getting volunteers trials. fact provided spades means development vaccine faster, even certain constraints time cannot avoided.

2/ reason time important due diligence, double/triple checking etc. overcome enough volunteers resources. run trial 5 times, 5 times amount staff equipment takes longer time, run 5 trials parallel, 5x staff, equipment volunteers, fifth time. important long term effects. Questions like 'what causes x adverse reaction 6 months line?'. Now, fact trialing vaccines 70 years means least possibilities eliminated without actual trials. thinking probably scientists pretty good idea potential effects could happen window [how long we've tested-how long would like tested sort vaccine, ideally] weigh likelihood severity. 

So yes, probably ultimately come 'it's risk worth taking' expect lot thought gone minimizing risk, much acceptable. Delta American airlines resuming full capacity flights.... Preach!Imagine bringing politics situation everyone risk. reduces spread 50%, matter whether ill healthy person wearing it. Clearly 50% great odds, R0 without masks 1.8, cutting half 0.9 gets transmission chain extinction trajectory. 

The N95s reduce spread high 90s%, extra discomfort, higher fit sensitivity, cost, rarity makes viable outside high-risk + highly trained organized staff like medical organizations. Fair point. Never saw tithe bad guy.  Wait till September college age kids south west bring virus back NYC RI.  sounds like good idea, needed masks PPE go medical professionals everyone else stay home. Don‚Äôt need mask within confides property. Oh you‚Äôre one people... US here, Florida. Retail worker. 

The shit hear sickening, I‚Äôve people come literally loud say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe people still wearing masks, don‚Äôt know worst over?‚Äù 

Cue 4XXXX+ confirmed cases end sight, people still believe it‚Äôs serious. ludicrous. I‚Äôm also NYC businesses back even 50% were. 

Most people taking seriously. That‚Äôs see people like /u/warrior5715 claiming NY less testing, opposite what‚Äôs happening reality. Covid old news. fakes done caring. wear mask, willing take flouro tube butt cure. own. It‚Äôs almost like didn‚Äôt read article. unclear article person even visited gym infectious.
This interesting premise investigate, lack evidence proof transmission reduced.
They might well claim gym use increase spread ebola. nobody sample it, cannot spread. Full lockdown happening again. **Many states really well currently including Massachusetts New York.** happen lockdown small number regions small number states highest infection rate. should‚Äôve held reopening soon. tip iceberg Legit question. could possibly enforce face ask social distancing requirements. US proven nobody listen anyone telling anything. won‚Äôt. voluntary compliance, self preservation Darwinism it‚Äôs impossible make anyone anything. less likely exposed crowded 6 train hardware store rural America? I'm calling bs. sounds much like actual plan, can't it. understand people continue downplay. 

What really gets downplaying guise ""omg people want good news"" 

Everyone wants ""good news"" 2020 nightmare. one week lake filled flesh eating algae, next week someone told ""Oh fine see!!! GREAT NEWS LETS JUMP IN"", I'm going reservations. think certain states/locations/people Seeing handling pandemic disaster since start surprised contact tracing different? Ah yes states talked crap ny it‚Äôs time shine. Oh surprise :/ can't wait country reporting numbers like (UK)

And sarcasm tell, course want UK rise numbers know yet people still went bars restaurants anyway really aren't. icing bad cake mediocre best. Oh something does. usually male prostitute mean wrt antibodies latching protein spike? show epi curves places practice masking. Nyt single, incredibly buggy website. can‚Äôt believe many fucking morons eat shit up. see masks worn one boat entire State Florida. Nope. No. can't describe why, feeling. Tennessee per capita higher California, Florida, Texas parts week...

I'm looking forward one blood drives near me

Twenty horrible since still shut elective surgery create space, also surge capacity beyond that. fine weeks least, watch number cities peak overall. open icu bed Bristol help Memphis anymore one Kansas would option one lifetime cop... RN need extra careful sake others even outdoors, away others going guarantee safety others since wind blow. 

And even virus dies faster outdoors still survive awhile carry someone around carries move one area another still could get transfer someone else. 

So yes selfish even outdoors, even since say RN held higher standard since handle patients likely either vulnerable rely safe possible even job. Worst timeline ever. well part... back square one Yup. way happen. like said Newsom thinking requiring masks week later happened.

We go back lockdown we'll end like Arizona, worse. personally glad happening. Americans needed taste bitter medicine (hopefully) realise nation angry toddlers elected angry toddler. Also, thin herd idiots. Frick anyways Lower actual numbers, that's case every country mass community spread. Infected count probably closer real numbers due lot testing (although testing availability varies heavily region region), death count less judged case case basis huge backlog - deaths seeing statistic couple weeks ago more. Makes furious Every time someone sudden come proponents taking precautions. ""Oh remember wear mask, social distance!"".... Stupid mother fuckers, we've telling 3 months. Yeah, absolutely! Oh even though job protect public health, felt need lie Americans mask safety thus put Americans' safety jeopardy. lie could said save masks essential workers, make mask! said masks effective...a lie. cases, 102 total - 3 died (all 80) active cases since early May.

Lol course you‚Äôre also pro-confederate average Florida Man especially bright. consider half floridians dummer average imagine turnout... right, are.

Stupid people elect stupid politicians lead stupid decisions making higher deathrate pandemic. Apr? Seems really early tho would send letter boss CC whoever HR (if applicable).

If company one, involve Betriebsrat. wear mask, goober sweet think cares people suffering dying. Deaths exponentially decreased. Testing improved exponentially. new cases true mild asymptomatic. worse form Influenza death sentence like cnn says. need be.

I like upfront bluntness accurately describe things. really surprised mods sub allowing rag white list, block sites left ""biased"". would frightened, flu bro What? You‚Äôre one making claim posting shit article evidence. BLM protests rioting happening concurrently spike COVID cases? Merely coincidence! 

No offense actually believe protests nothing increase, you‚Äôre fucking moron. still taking seriously. Iran closest curves US, interesting compare dates expect things lowest new cases 2nd spike came May 2. Deaths stopped falling May 17 pretty flat May 31st rise started again.

The US bottomed June 9. continues similar Iran, expect flat deaths June 24‚ÄîJuly 8 accelerating increase. You‚Äôre wrong, there‚Äôs much force people comply. nation stubborn streak absolutely insist learning hard way. Take meds Well depressing reminder. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ New national mask policy:

US full idiots governed even idiots. Many still think Jesus take care everything them. I'm florida watched press conference yesterday.... kept think man guy turd . guys punch face ? Ducey says can. Smart? No. see lower numbers sooner countries let bunch people die get sick eventually herd immunity take effect? Yes. actually think worse. Usually small town mayor, governing council Krypton, whoever villain. real life, half population. Come live. seen one unmasked person last week. Test processing Florida appears least week delayed, least Tallahassee. wouldn‚Äôt see cases spike probably two weeks later people start feeling crappy days later get tested. thing happened memoirist day. Congratulations idiots guess :)))) I'm business, policy include pandemic. people around testing positive Trump clearly wearing mask makeup smudging, get yet?  Thats I'm thinking  wont football Fall b/c clowns dont like masks. FFS big still trying protect vulnerable places. take much start hitting again. That's quantum level genius. Reality exist observed.

/r/woahdude protesting area lot crime looting, might apprehensive participate contact tracing potentially outing requirement. long  we're getting sent back work crowded environments half-assed new protocols nothing wrong üòÅ summarizes perfectly!
Sadly, mindset descibed exists everywhere. live Germany, matter look, I'm surrounded people.
We may better US, really could've done better. That's correct. reason hospitalization rate high China forced even mild cases go hospital isolation wards mainly isolate prevent infecting others.

The thing happens East Asian countries right now, Singapore/Vietnam/Taiwan/South Korea. well dont business take over. 

cinemas get replaced ondemand vids.

that hard people owning business always way history. 

i notice trend many want change/adapt live current situation know. believe cases actually popping states protests less popular..... think there's correlation  India banned international flights completely since mid-March operating even except repatriation. must they're excluded, there's need since can't come anyway.  Both. Multiple states reporting 100% ICU usage cases keep skyrocketing people go gym COVID, spread it.

Well DUH it, can't spread it. That's thought reading got confused... news? Yea, opening bars beaches everything totally didnt shit it.

Yawn think people also want see friends family. I‚Äôve never killed anyone guns. 

Rape epidemic too. Better cut penis. 

Also yeah rights matter lives trying take them. don‚Äôt try. people going 'I want wear mask!' probably people go 'I want quit smoking!' 'I want stop eating red meat daily!' totally dishonest suggest crossover ;) Denmark, maybe 1/2000 wears mask, busses, streets, beaches bars/restaurants totally packed.. wierdly enough rates low, infection gains momentum we're scewed Well it‚Äôs like planned ahead people sign wavers ,.......oh wait never mind nobody knows, nobody know. might random distributiony reports virus major effect male testes, unknown results. never spike shortly reopen protests. Hmm.... Precisely. They're basically flying petri dishes. Protests sites super spreader events. makes sense see many people protests. Humans mess. I'm sure protests contribute spread virus. they're obviously reason numbers increasing south southwest, we'd seeing huge increases too. I'm 30s, previously runner strength trained. Covid gave viral meningitis four months. I'm still bed day double vision feel drunk walk. Steroids helping, idea permanent damage done.

Scary shit. Ask New York 

It‚Äôs data

I posted 

Your issue them. It‚Äôs like made link graphs genuinely left FL vacation yesterday   doctors cried wolf telling everyone drink, smoke, eat junk food, lots sex strangers, might credibility now. agree agreement agreement 100% Nah, hospitalizations increasing many states well friend. Ok thanks. Separate note cant believe get voted asking questions smh afar really seems like people US focusing wrong rights freedoms. People value right make someone else sick right person healthy.

Ultimately right matters right fair equal representation, everything else flows that, US right people get equal votes (if they're even able vote). hospitalizations rising fast spiking testing ton people months ago? Minnesota it‚Äôs going way easier identify protests causative factor understand means opposite pumping stock right? give link 50k NYC Times Square? says They're absolutely right. coincidence restaurants arose time aristocracies lost house servants. funny watching Reddit collectively trying excuse virus spread may protests simultaneously try treat virus seriously. Yes, opening restaurants bars helped contribute spread. spike, least Southern California, protests. Many restaurants bars open 2 weeks. restaurants limited seating. protesters brought virus home infecting parents. they're going work giving coworkers. know people can't admit it.

It's harder pass around outdoors mask perfect throw 20,000 people 2 blocks crowding shoulder shoulder virus spread. tape idea works really well. Unfortunately job need donning doffing masks fairly often. Definitely, esteemed epidemiologist Larry Kudlow said problem! Damn guess stay inside forever  record aspire beat. new cases protests, testing people wearing masks within large groups people? Oh, era Ronald got elected. person referring wearing masks get upset business denies let wearing masks. Who's say don't? find UV light?! Michigan getting deserves; **what asked for, via demands threats assault rifles SCREAMS murdering Governor.**  shame.. there's one person deserves get him. US surgeon general said masks dont work average people. It‚Äôs crippling 

No hospital Arizona crippled 

That‚Äôs hysteria said earlier thread related protestors, think it‚Äôs worth putting again.

If people don‚Äôt understand badly COVID going fuck America. Let tell you.

Continue protest ignore social distancing go crowded places without mask within year, half America without job. currently 60 million unemployed.

Millions going infected. die hospitals overloaded.

There million dead virus alone. including people die able get treated regular medical needs.

Those survive heavily debt, work without help unemployment ran months ago government doesn‚Äôt give send help. You‚Äôll see massive spike suicides.

Ask sounds important respecting Social distancing wearing masks. wish Florida released better data (or fucking lazy find it) see average infected person. concern age might averaging younger, there's many old people Florida. sure vulnerable population stays isolated younger population older/vulnerable population relies services younger population. Yup. real reason to. grandma dying what, me? mean really, hurt me? already isolated, yet connected billions people via internet. Christ, watch videos read blogs people died; literally interacting lives they're done living them. We've spent decades replacing Church Government moral compass. yeah - dead grandmother matter amount tut-tutting, moralizing shaming change that.

Fines prison sentences way. Good luck that.  ones getting used.

Many protestors wearing masks, especially early days. still packs close-quarters conditions makes risk even greater. disinformation getting people killed, seriously stfu stop defending moronic propaganda. 

If protested, get tested, do, self-quarantine avoid elders. Please. experience protests screen, saw police lines rioting. areas protests people closer shouting taking masks temporarily, majority protests took place distancing 99% mask usage. speaking experience Atlanta secondhand knowledge several cities. 

My point still it‚Äôs impossible ‚Äúact like protestor‚Äù restaurant/bar environment. Closed spaces easier catch viruses in. can‚Äôt eat drink mask on. protest decide close/far want others. can‚Äôt really crowded restaurants. eating you‚Äôre actively ingesting stuff, instead passively breathing in. There‚Äôs ton factors. 

FWIW, don‚Äôt disagree protests effect uptick, disagree small minority (per capita) people protesting big effect versus amount people going restaurants/bars/stores/etc. without protection surely higher (and includes people protestors well). Keep door open. Windows can. helps. Carolina reaper might trick Hey us Kyles already accepted joke walking monster energy drinks. Don‚Äôt try flip male Karen. spike right bat. quote another famous fictional mayor ""Amity know means friendship."" No. think real want asshole, wear mask.

They two reasons: selfish obstinate. 2 days ago. People staying avoiding restaurants far less think Well...

I'm Iowan. Enough said. :/ spike Chicago? Minneapolis NYC? larger protests them. spike.

That's comment bullshit. rest people flirsi. Including parents. 

They moved dad's Hart condition made cold weather difficult him. basically stuck condo afeaid even go elevator building. 

They deserve this. Yes, thankfully treatment improved. worry much long term damage done lungs even younger people. That's addition knowing really long term effects since novel virus. Guess we'll see hope best.  think newly reported cases going survive?

We keep warning states see NY cautionary tale, people keep determined prove NY. 

Well, they're going prove it, right. One nine sort respiratory virus!? feel fairly confident seasonal changes REDUCE spread COVID somewhat, though may necessarily mean fewer cases testing becomes prevalent societies open back up. summer weather provide virus fewer floating particles travel on, people tend spend less time indoors thats virus proven effectively spread. Culture way different. much larger group people pretty high risk tolerance compared countries, least 30%. countries, probably like 80-90% people board 60-70% most. US can't enforce strict shutdown either. People wanna party still so. can't even properly enforce mandatory mask order. Shutting another time another half ass shutdown like first delay inevitable. Also, less financial support hard make people stay home simply go protest non stop. shutting economy infections stay similar slightly lower till reopening happen again. cameras catching cheaters, think enforcing masks issue casinos. fact travel tax credit cherry top. see next year predicated fact $4k spend vacation start also think virus threat well going states quarantining states. Beautiful. wish could. windows don‚Äôt open, we‚Äôre allowed keep door open :( ‚ÄúNo biggy.‚Äù‚Äô- Joe Rogan smart move,and agree,all schools tested well. live summer 95 degrees high humidity. Thats solution many regions. 2 weeks right? still messed up. GEE WILLIKERS!

OSHA must getting hard, much fap material. Geez that‚Äôs big family. Even extended family small. Thx posting. People underestimate potential longterm impacts COVID19. doubt it. mother-in-law died April remember well. Stubborn, always right afraid tell wrong. Yeah, MERS SARS also coronavirus, influenza totally different virus. Chimps humans share 97% DNA, 3% difference makes huge difference terms different two species are. Two infectious microbes viruses doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean present fashion cause similar damage. Well. posted it. says helped us understand covid. already stated don‚Äôt understand jack shit. Doesn‚Äôt effect young people. Wrong. simple respiratory illness. Wrong. forth. Nobody knew anything anything helpful. Unless consider writing theorizing article article helpful. don‚Äôt. I've looking I'm exactly sure get them. Googling seemed shove shady site shady site me.

Any advice could get them? me, depends state's response. live state made science-based decisions excellent job testing tracing. willing assume reasonable risk patriotic duty: limited risk pool (pods), masks, sanitation, change culture studying working sick. 

But minute see crowds people indoors masks nearby? I'm out. Even better!  Laid Americans receiving average $900 every week. I‚Äôm sure get sources from. $1200 stimulus (and $500 per child). can‚Äôt imagine conservative states. can‚Äôt believe pandemic became partisan issue.  probably still open infecting customers knowingly! Mad cow plasma I'm neither troll stupid.

And that's stupid. new star wars ride Rise Global Pandemic going death defying! feel sorry America.. stupidity frightening 2016.

New macgyver would like North Korea. wear mask, parties, casinos, traveled airplanes etc... year remind I'm fine. going superspreader event. Ok Chicago, Minneapolis, NYC? What's different there? Blows protest talk.

For example suburb Chicago protest March 5k+ masks nearly everyone local. continue decline. Bleach, dont forget bleach! use wash hydroxychloriquin pill with. Kind like beer chase shot liquor. Also yeah rights matter lives trying take them. don‚Äôt try.

/r/iamverybadass lol I‚Äôm stealing one Thanks protestors almost like firearms guaranteed part constitution. Free speech stayed open well - evidenced re-open BLM protesters. post directed article might contain information... Exactly this. gave country $1200 include never would gotten rest bill passed.

The rest bill basically insurance payout businesses (including doubt GOP owned Trump owned businesses) help prop stock market long enough wealthy friends exit it, takes time can't sell everything once.

Once get out, market going allowed crater, people US going stuck huge bill.

A second ""stimulus"" bill thing - prop economy little longer attempt buy time. going work. terrible vision wear glasses reason wear underwear! Stuff needs breathe! /s I'm also going go vomit thinking idiot old Florida woman wearing underwear. airlines received huge government bailout go bankrupt due pandemic open refuse part slow spread said pandemic? 

Sounds like owe government bailout money back... remember first started showed video Chinese man next someone 15 seconds outdoor market caught it. Seems risky me. do.

But I'm annoyed greens year. might go Soc. takes experts deduce? üòÇ someone losing business 100,000+ put it. UBI means Joe family eats, business survives.   Take care quigly big hug. However death rate still runs neck neck w Texas day day. square that? know specific bars people getting sick.

If rash protestors getting sick know Wearing mask hurts nobody. wearing mask killing people. [one mean think people antibodies never got tested before? hotel security/ front desk.. need check get room.. serve unmasked folks.. building policy, personal one. Yes. This. enjoyed reading immensely feel exact thing. US really attitude infections entirely reasonable.

Whereas countries actively trying reduce infections zero.

And weirdest thing see. mean SC testing widely, yeah, good. it‚Äôs people showing symptoms tested, % positivity gonna lot higher compared states testing widely, even virus isn‚Äôt bad. Like peak NJ, 4500 new cases day 50% percent positivity. FL 9000 new cases day past days 12% positive. NJ percentage least part much higher cuz sickest people tested.

I wouldn‚Äôt surprised shits hit fan SC, answer question, percent positivity doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean y‚Äôall next Florida. Forgive asking probably dumb questions, super spreading events like this... everyone get infected? HVAC system spreading close contact individual it? like jumping person person? They're trying allocate personnel based parents' choices children go in-person online school fall.

Most every district thing, announcing plans. done state-by-state, district-by-district. agree that‚Äôs rude realize build hospital two days need one?

Anyone remember unused shit nyc 

You Cuomo types hype, facts 

You cherry pick numbers claim apocalypse. 

Death rate people 80 .26 

Less normal flu season Good. People starting get careless again. land free, home brave, land saving peoples' lives. /s lol never pledged class Wait... tattoos this? New Zealand teacher, find whole thing you‚Äôve said absolutely totally unbelievable. seems hideously unfair. I‚Äôm sorry deal this. ‚ÄúSpicyness‚Äù technically isn‚Äôt flavor (it‚Äôs mouth injured) shouldn‚Äôt affected, wouldn‚Äôt surprised saltiness wasn‚Äôt affected either since don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs connected smell Exactly. adhering social distancing wearing mask following advice medical community, dont go anywhere morons are. grocery store morons like congregate, wont go there. Costco recommending everyone wear mask take business there. Otherwise get delivered. smart, stay smart stay safe O2 saturation curve. Usually saturation‚Äôs anywhere 88-100 asymptomatic ( even lower young healthy patients larger reserve). problems this, one still develop organ damage related RJ hypoxia two certain point oxygenation drop precipitously. see link middle part curve things change drastically get middle part guess, new York almost 50% peak iirc. nationwide rate gives us big picture, rate. SLICES DIAGONAL CORNER SHEET CAKE??! OP here's comparison:

I've both! me, flu much worse, COVID-19 lasted much longer really annoying. 

The body aches flu terrible flu headache worst terms pain. However, flu headache lasted 1 day. remember pain bad felt like head get enough air slept outside. 

The body aches COVID-19 lasted 2 days pretty mild. upper abdomen upper back achy. headaches severe omg woke headache almost every day 4 weeks!!! horrible! also swollen glands neck irritated neck muscles ended neck ache jaw 2 weeks. 

COVID-19 symptoms appeared, went away, appeared, etc 4 weeks. Test free live. wait line 3 hours many people testing. I'm TN. Well guess [this aged like 127k deaths US according Google (almost half million worldwide). USA deserves better getting. agree statement ignorance encouraged. appears viewed societal deficit, know is. song slaps. Butbutbut... it‚Äôll cost rich shred penny don‚Äôt want spoil us slaves sort communitarian anything. Better roll die imperceptibly dent undeserved, Godless, luxury. It‚Äôs embarrassing you‚Äôre dead. Im obviously expert, best knowledge things u claim either misleading subjective: Americans generally took taking covid-19 seriously. American health care system obviously third world country, overrun healthcare system except maybe new York. plethora scientific studies done done, counterfactual; could social distancing saved people long run? Possibly, hard know sure. Remember imperial college model predicted millions deaths America year alone? 
So tldr: 
I think unfair call America biggest failure 20th century reasons:
1. 21st century 
2. Apart new York state, US ranks middle pack deaths per million 
3. governments great job containing outbreak, hence US really worse Britain China similar country 
Please continue leave house ...New York somebody else's experience? I‚Äôll wait. take 41,407 post think could repost every day success much better let predators sex traffickers right?! Conveniently forgetting it‚Äôs Millennials work whole time work jobs lot viral exposure ‚Äúwe‚Äôre young healthy ones.‚Äù üôÑ Except real life deniers damn thing exploded. go ignorant stupid want, don‚Äôt go anywhere near people idiocy could actually fucking kill them.

Fuckwit. Yes - sheriff town said enforce governor's orders wear mask. He's re-elected 5 elections - sure hell voting him. Please explain? 99.75% survival rate ""fucked"" local school district way trustworthy federal state government. said that, local used car dealer trustworthy federal government.

I know low income thing two thoughts:

1. Low income people apt laid due COVID-19. one resource time.
2. Low income people apt crowded schools poor cleaning standards. Yeah virus 0.0/05 IFR rate kill everyone. delusional fat fuck I‚Äôm sorry entire restaurant industry - guys completely fucked. Find new line work now.

And need keep mind, anyone already struggling find work: Good luck, whole industry folks also looking. 

We need talk UBI. needed talk years ago. 

Also, want throw in, ""welfare queens"" anyone lick numerical perspective care ones Wall Street. strange thing alot people hear concerned business owners shut employees work people dieing, would avoid businesses made wear masks.

Many made point driving next county get haircut masks required sit restaurant.


So instead supporting favorite restaurant barber shut down, would go way avoid wearing mask. mask wearing local government decision

The hypocrites care people work, loose businesses, die. main concern seen mask. Yes grandma saying true years.

It's true.

Flu shot give flu. believing science change, Governor Asshole?? ramped testing. Bro, *ever* wash clothes? might book smart hella street dumv can‚Äôt gather groups 5. Protesting fine. Idk reaserch sides like did. level need Samuel L. Jackson. Fauci one blessing had. good voice Trumps team happens one political agenda, still ignored every thing said. 

Watching Fauci fix try correct whatever bullshit Trump would say press conferences goddamn painful... couldn‚Äôt even factual needs Trump would fire him. Every great nation great leader  wants look real cool anti-lib social circle. That's what's driving idiocy. Performative social media crap. Awesome. highway stop work opened seating area, too. I'm ""hot"" states uh... Highway stop. takes one. explicitly stated, corporate essentially told managers turn away customers wearing mask. actual job politician per se propose, support create laws favour citizens, politicians labor tell us want hear, dealing underways extra profit, another matter entirely nice letter anti mask morons read it. :( anyway linked george floyd protests? wonder could aftermath virus thriving mass gatherings Nothing changed, except he's hiding anything. Well considering graduated stem field 4 year course. guess right know nothing science. 

And science says could hurt prolonged usage also get sick built bacteria. 

Do really think medical proffesionals wear mask whole day everyday? 

I could go yall scientists I'd rather take advice reddit doctor! hated weed. smell, coughing, sounding like Seth Rogen.

Then started taking capsules think weed is... good, man, good. Humans doomed extinction point, it‚Äôs best worry it. I've both! me, flu much worse, COVID-19 lasted much longer really annoying. 

The body aches flu terrible flu headache worst terms pain. However, flu headache lasted 1 day. remember pain bad felt like head get enough air slept outside. 

The body aches COVID-19 lasted 2 days pretty mild. upper abdomen upper back achy. headaches severe omg woke headache almost every day 4 weeks!!! horrible! also swollen glands neck irritated neck muscles ended neck ache jaw 2 weeks. 

COVID-19 symptoms appeared, went away, appeared, etc 4 weeks. government done lot things. That's continues rage Yes one dramatic hyperbole lmao also state would mandate masks worn backed monetary penalties  excellent reason. vaccine come protect 20% people, people would end catching covid would drop guard. Well, isn‚Äòt exactly like that? Stop eating cheeseburgers (going socialising) could serious consequences. sinking feeling many US Americans ever take seriously happens family. maybe even then. articles ""look happened us learn""... work. could learn need articles. actually correct. meant loosely ""legitimate"" ""on rise"" ""his stakes rising"" probably eluded me. Thank you. swear politicians biggest idiots lol. Oklahoma Can‚Äôt tell you‚Äôre sarcastic UPMC doctor Wednesday said number people hospitalized COVID-19 within UPMC lowest many weeks, people test positive aren‚Äôt getting sick.

Dr. Donald Yealy pointed occurring even midst Pennsylvania‚Äôs reopening ongoing social justice protests.

He suggested country focusing much rising COVID-19 case counts.

‚ÄúWe need change mindset focus exclusively number cases, severity illness. shouldn‚Äôt counting diagnosed infection,‚Äù Yealy said. ‚ÄúFor vast majority people testing positive, illness mild, don‚Äôt even know symptoms COVID-19 infection.‚Äù

Yealy also said UPMC tested 15,000 patients receiving non-COVID-19 care, one 400 testing positive. said rate, held steady weeks, suggests aren‚Äôt many people carrying COVID-19 don‚Äôt know it.

‚ÄúIn summary, experience shows fewer people admitted, are, tend much less sick beginning peak phases pandemic,‚Äù said.

Yealy said declines might result factors good job protecting elderly others highly vulnerable, rising portion new cases involving younger people healthier less likely need hospitalization.

He also said UMPC improved tools helping sickest patients, including drug Remdesivir, ‚Äúgained experience best care for‚Äù COVID-19 patients. noted early pandemic, doctors usually put sickest patients breathing ventilators. UPMC learned ‚Äúit difficult successfully come off, outcomes simply aren‚Äôt good.‚Äù

Yealy said UPMC presently 14 patients ventilators across 40 hospitals, include six Dauphin, Cumberland, York Lancaster counties.

Yealy said lessening impact COVID-19 might related summer weather people spending less time close quarters.

However, Yealy another UPMC official spoke briefing reporters Wednesday warned disregarding need face masks precautions prevent spread COVID-19.

Tami Minnier, UPMC‚Äôs chief quality officer, said ‚Äúwe need stay vigilant. need able continue wearing masks, wearing masks appropriately, washing hands frequently, using social distancing. Despite points Dr. Yealy made, plan going forward keeping us safe.‚Äù states biggest increases states biggest frequent protests, states reopened tried pretend everything normal. research, scientists developed vaccines not? Interesting. idea. Damn Americans acting like center Universe nothing else going world. countries corona control widespread mask use. proof results. That's article says. Woah woah woah. voted Wendy Davis like sane Texan should've. guy's ignorance stupidity knows bounds.  say one dies anything preventable, ever. 

Scale matters, killing every month car accidents kill every year. oh look speed limits seatbelts airbags. 

Clearly one family died yet stunted look this. I'm assuming 14 edgy boy grow serious loss life we've seen last 80 years WWII people still lament day. thing San Luis Obispo county Give couple weeks fella act like spreading indoors kind secret.

You fucking idiots, think cancelled sports music events indoors fucking fun? Sure January/February could make claim, end March. Christ. There's Trump van area sets parking lot closed business sells Trump crap. also sign saying they're selling masks hand sanitizer too. U.S. Covid 19 cases begin popping Attempt control Fails miserably Mfw we‚Äôre laughing stock planet driven influence leftist politicians? huge spike virus cases? rly sure understand you‚Äôre getting Literally never opened. Closed space, indoor dining, also ever opened. literally cannot wear mask drinking going eat. essentially pointless even bring one, type scenario STAYED CLOSED! mean donates insufficiently? amount money fix problem people dumb basic stuff gotten problem control many advanced countries? direct implication stance. moronic 'whataboutism'. sad thing sick deluded fanatic like actually think 'good guys'. people actually vile. Y'all find out:

If gonna dumb  

Then ya gotta tough idot, watching happen certainty would huge mistake. Define unbiased might neighborhood, know, went Lowe's one day earlier week see single person wearing mask. employees, contractors, customers masks worn correctly. see anyone mask hanging chin anything like either. little shocked, honestly. good way. flying though? welcome zombie apocalypse?... will... wackos Bro, troll. Bet files taxes Thank saying this. think anti lockdown crew often cry business owners hard us, business owners themselves, yet claim side. Time time again, polls show even business owners people lost jobs still support strong mitigation measures protect community. run business. We're stupid. see consequences mile away we're used thinking future constantly. us emotionally able acknowledge truth math looked calendar saw truth.

I lost business, close willing spend savings try save something feel comfortable promoting crisis. would rather close start news infected 15 people, one staff *inevitably* get sick maybe infect entire family. Many employees live multi generational households. children. also conflicted wanting work vs wanting safe. *No one* angry lock blamed government closing. Yes entitled clients upset lockdown even tried sympathize saying *wasn't fair small businesses like us.* wanted served. wanted life go back normal. life normal would rather close responsible outbreak hurts community. close big mean old government told business. closed work 100% incompatible social distancing pivot. that's goes. think nationwide lockdown time mistake. people sick areas virus is. county 300k started lockdown ~March 15th May 15th ~150 cases. 2100. ""locking down"" area picking I'd think people would willing it, good luck convincing people lock 16 weeks first 8 weeks precautionary necessary. That's problem country size limit interstate travel way. European countries locked boarders size one states. Much easier contain virus way IMO allowing people jump plane Florida New York go Missouri visit family, go business trip, vacation, etc. still see tons people FB feed going vacation across country people talking taking virus seriously. said CASE FATALITY (CFR) IFR. people understood difference 2 numbers discussions would lot fruitfull. add Australia, NZ South Korea list. leagues Europe US response. guy gets it, indeed r/leopardsatemyface sports leagues transition include 50% ownership players, start supporting again. players reason watch players deserve least partial ownership teams! Alabama much lockdown first time, certainly another. governor apologizing today calling businesses nonessential. really care businesses like you. IMO, re-opening forcing people unemployment. Eat fucking dick garbage human quite natural barriers could established borders. Obviously Rocky Mountains, Mississippi river, Apalachians Colorado river well many smaller landmarks.

Cities lie sides river would simply split two. examples cities sides border river work together perfectly, border countries divide people. Aw. Cheer sweaty dick tits. Darwin awards people offspring. big heart, hence scapegoat üêê 
Be well, amigo ü•Ç Trump? Golfing, course. can‚Äôt believe first comment HR th doctors House  Look, know anymore people love shit leaders make comments like this, can't appreciate governor fucking *Texas* places, willingly admitting wrong actions took, he's regretful? mean yeah, listened advisors, scientists researchers, everyone saying reopening slowed.

But day age, I'm glad dig heels stand immediate reopenings. Small victories low bar, suppose. still welcome me. I'm pro shutdowns science find, really understand idea empty middle seat somehow safer.

You're going closed metal tube someone directly next 2 feet away matter seat empty. There's someone behind you, there's someone front you. breathing out. thd flights ventilation system decent, it'll keep particles settling easily, isn't, kinda fucked whether there's 100 people 150.

Wouldn't enforcing nonsense mask policy flights far safe arbitrary empty middle seat gives illusion safety? percent California population Latino? Look bruises arms next time golfing. elderly bruise higher rate IV placed. one travelling plane right now. Sitting indoor space, 150-200 people, one worst possible places want spread virus.

People need realize this, cases US rising. outright dangerous. guy word ""weed"" name talking IQ. I've seen all. Jokes you, grandparents left sacrifice. yet modified work cv-19, yes?

And mods may unintended consequences. I‚Äôm epidemiologist, degrees related fields. read lot ad pay attention current events while. didn‚Äôt immediately catch scale early days, soon really left China became apparent gonna disaster epic proportions. Especially states. mean lack preparedness large scale epidemic evident years something people warning about. Covid filled void. It‚Äôs also, apparent day one states going hit especially hard. takes looking recent track record administration foreseen going disaster seen generations, point telling American friends February/March go back states (I live Europe) gonna bad idea. frustrating thing foreseeable and, difficult, preventable. It‚Äôs shitty able safely bet cynicism pessimism watch right.  condoms prevent 100% pregnancies. What's fuckin point? mean, Facebook alone would that. many tests per day average US rn? Fauci unbiased, agree? Prepare ""Florida man"" news Wtf, UK dogshit job managing we‚Äôre nearly back normal, fucking badly US? It‚Äôs you, system accumulation capital cannot name sub. Europe saying get 100 rolls TP, deep freezer, stock chicken now. Nope. give lip service small government ‚Äî except it‚Äôs something think important, like military, abortion, corporate taxation, freedom religion, education, sex Ed, get fair share too, bong There's tons debt years one cared repaying.


If choices death, living long enough possibly see taxes go up, I'll take tax increase. guy would awesome parties... Yes, usual practice. NY, required law take them. think data source looking for.

[CDC shows state, reported deaths broken Covid, flu, pneumonia. Sitting alone corner B- blood sure alarm heightened remaining 5% get special dispensation scientists politicians riot. LOL see videos covering protests? I'll admit lot people wearing masks, yes, social distancing thrown window. gut feelings, tell data ...to safe others? .....or ya know, protest? Currently dealing peer pressure coworkers I‚Äôm coming back. I‚Äôve mentally prepared weeks now... waiting someone actually give directive. said, 98% job home, 2% gets taken care office night weekend. Takes 30 minutes office week total me. Even though New York‚Äôs numbers aren‚Äôt bad right now, I‚Äôm seeing everything going US I‚Äôm keen changing newly adapted lifestyle yet. you‚Äôre saying WONT save 30,000 lives Oct. 1 I‚Äôm central Florida &amp; I‚Äôm scared.

&amp;#x200B;

With Cpt. Incompetent ruling nation death toll beginning.

With population using religion basis wear mask...even muslims shut hajj year, first time ever. lol!!

&amp;#x200B;

This USA wants. infected.

So it...

&amp;#x200B;

Keep border closed. Deny US travelers entry numbers finally drop due mass infection throughout entire population. USA lacks intelligence right thing remove USA threat...keep out. like say country permitted entry. surprise anyone? see look up. looking death ""headlines"", wait 3-4 weeks, that's long death's lag behind confirmed cases. They're coming.... Phased re-openings based total cases.

It isn‚Äôt hard. would I? total failure government. government temporarily required mask wearing distancing flights, airlines would level playing field. could raise prices due added cost. Flyers could confident bring deadly disease home grandma. no, almighty dollar king going let airlines infect people. Paywall... Contents? Masks prevent 100% infections. Bars, house parties, hair salons, restaurants, gyms, massage parlors, nail salons, sports, etc alllllll going daily across much America now. That‚Äôs clearly large cause spread. fact, likely moreso since much spread comes indoor spaces. Recycled air, low airflow, etc Fucking hell comments Twitter thread are...who kidding, totally unsurprising. fucking hate racist Americans. Actually buy like 3 year savings cakes pays basic membership. rainy season here, may see clusters continuing pop up. They've done good job handling it, expect continue handle well. life matters...in papers is. Remember TOGETHER. 

\s weed stupid hopefully not? Yeah going find hook ups bar face covered?? government really going sit people go homeless hungry pandemic?

Huh? though America's government lot states motto ""If doesnt happen dont care"" now. Lol whatever national health institute said masks ineffective. 
This whole thing politics cant see well open eyes. deniers damn thing exploded.
No wrong... fact fauci lied facemasks time anything effective blah blah blah. oh wait info used say masks ineffective show they're effective. bullshit enjoy show though . 0.3% 1 million Americans. Yeah look perfect rest world is... explain masks work, since insist bow reasoning. Yes. disease highly infectious. I‚Äôm fan Scotty marketing, done pretty good this. I‚Äôm Queensland it‚Äôs good premier stuck guns border closing far. Bro 95% Americans wore masks, 95% Americans would SUFFOCATE! Thing‚Äôs gotta breath!!!! takes weeks deaths covid formally recorded. That‚Äôs demoncrusher saying. seriously doubt there's 70 million Karens refusing wear masks.  ""People die, extra couple thousand deaths per day matter!""

what Stop equating every American president. Tons people immigrants developing countries we‚Äôre ones calling shitholes. We've reached weird stage internet tv perfect storm propaganda machine. figured manipulate certain section country large enough size get power. fantasy easier live reality, also promise forever, people eat shit up. 95% impossible.

What 70%? benefit there? Yes actually obeyed , wore mask, didnt open economy early. 
Only madman absolutely sure.

Under present brutal primitive conditions planet, every person meet regarded one walking wounded. never seen man woman slightly deranged either anxiety grief. never seen totally sane human being.

Help conquer IQ shortage worry less think more. show think unbiased I‚Äôll let ya know, okay champ? FYI, patient hasn‚Äôt noticed it‚Äôs technically sign, symptom. symptom feature disease noticed patient; sign something patient hasn‚Äôt noticed clinician detect, usually via diagnostic testing. Definitely way don‚Äôt care do. second that. Hey, walk street insert random group's conversation. mean welcomed? No. here. Think little, free. putting America first now. people didn‚Äôt go social distancing. Northern Nevada here. confirm people fucking stupid everywhere  Im uk already rest life main thing protests outdoors, know greatly decreases risk transmission.

I considered that, yeah right posing lower risk spreading virus outdoors.

Looks like though US might need unfortunately shutdown everything suppress rapid surge cases. remember people saying ""look see Florida never surge!!"" 

But sure enough infact right now.  tax tithes gifts also. research suggesting masks help stop spread respiratory viruses? group, partnership dozen governments global nonprofits, aims 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses end 2021 ‚Äúminimum target,‚Äù CEPI manufacturing expert James Robinson told news service. believes 4 billion doses, much ambitious target, achievable. Singapore managed see per capita rate infection US, happened migrant worker dormitories. below-standared health care (for Singapore, is...) crowded living conditions, they're young fit work hard outside. Nah, said lost game save country chaos Well now, admitted would look bad health care workers still complaining adequate ppe flattened curve time, they‚Äôre still getting price-gouged, could foreseen workers getting sick burnt letting respiratory disease run wild Okay yea 100% thought that‚Äôs saying wasn‚Äôt sure, apologies pay don‚Äôt work? fuck? realise many people ¬£400 laying around? Get bubble. You‚Äôre way stupider though. Damn dude shut stop making look bad. Dam got bro! Washington state sheriff weenie? Oh forgot hes facist bigot racist pig. Year hindsight... could weed GOP supporters getting ICU beds they'll inevitably clog one thing upon admission hospital: make say Obama greatest president ever, Trump weak little crybaby. *not* able that. They'll take death dishonor, rightfully so! came out. y‚Äôall want ignore science facts. can‚Äôt help you. correct places acted responsibly, many areas case first wave reduced enough allow separate second wave. one big wave. hope Tsunami. Death lag. cases certainly brings deaths. hope enough remove heartless cowards next election. (Guess that‚Äôs another pipe dream Texas) Sure asked ad nauseam think could exposed‚Äî long would take show test? Don‚Äôt want Infect parents comfort I‚Äôm finding UK figures, government‚Äôs ineptitude obvious focus economy people, aren‚Äôt USA. 

But even it‚Äôs like enjoying death shooting squad hanging slowly death. True. Mitch McToiletsnake delete auto-populate wiki article him. Plus, fitting name referring turtle. could go back redo anything, would LOT sports betting.

Or memorize winning lottery numbers, go back time...

I also would try warn people stuff, prevent bad things, would easier wealthy. ""Well, US like NY happen anywhere else"" 

If look animated timeline coronavirus cases per capita, AZ, FL TX (and others) headed [**same 

States going hit New York levels cases hospitalizations soon, already late something it. nothing people taking advice staying home?

Please tell comprehend statistic made public, meant things continued remain preventive measures taken, please tell understand much. American everything looks better outside:/ I'd still put flame face set alight though, get wrong. There's also fact many states lying death rates chalking massively increased pneumonia deaths coinkidink. Trump seems think otherwise unless intentions let Biden win.  man here.

ü§£ü§£ God please stop. 

How far fall manly scale? Interstate Commerce clause Constitution give federal government broad authority matters interstate commerce. Since virus certainly impacts industries cross state lines (i.e. airlines flying different states, package delivery, etc), federal government could probably lot more. example, could mandate goods services crossing state lines must workers wearing masks, customers interacting workers must wear masks. No, - switch enable opt-in enabling API used contact tracing apps (just like turn location services off) app itself. can't even flick switch unless installed it. Lol, fuck someone actually looking science facts things amirite? Let‚Äôs continue ignoring thing, it‚Äôs working great states that. 

Never underestimate idiot confidence. words, never underestimate u/Zoerillamynilla know idiots like direct threat ones actually trying responsible smart public. let evil opinion? XD hahahahahaha
Hahahahahahahah..man man arent front now...

why even neutral would probably piss mouth Congratulations ‚Äúwith complete‚Äù laughing 2nd April article Foreign Policy. Yikes.  didn‚Äôt help Fauci lies masks helpful fear healthcare enough. said get fo science told him. masks helpful need make horse healthcare needs them. gave ammo argue this.

Downvote want, wear mask fauci said dumb put masks take off. Blame trump. 

His fault people protesting last month. 


L l l won‚Äôt work , entire point kindergarten socialization children children. 

We going real social development problem kids can‚Äôt get socialized crucial ages 3-4-5. People need accept marching protesting ignoring social distancing killing untold thousands people. customer get face proudly tell covid yet never refuses wear mask. 

Some work places states require masks, state job. I'm stressed every day I'm going bring virus home elderly parents. posting two-month-old article now? unemployment benefits. want pay workers unemployment. thought opening state people would forced back job would stop paying unemployment. risk infection extremely low.

It‚Äôs odds problem. It‚Äôs stakes.  prove something trying it? mentioned stuff proven legislation demanded it? Goddamn murricans. Move New Zealand Agreed r/Masks4All Yall fucked. Maybe schools, too. also construction workers wearing n95's years dead. haha true. Maybe mushroom? problem tell ""case"" means. already this?

We're testing 650,000 people per day don‚Äôt want Americans here.

Sorry sorry. won't. forgetting increase testing capability. Remember prevalence NY NYC ended 20%. still long ways FL tx. non-american, USA healthcare system ""of third-world country"", far worse unfortunately. Nobody here. Everybody outside nobody really adhering corona rules think case. like meme here.  look statistics distribution primarily 20 50. Old people careful (nursing homes dangerous right now). death rate higher, catch it, 75. die, may 60 years complications, young. might beat odds die anyway young, get lifelong debt depression. Well, case must pretty horrified...

212 people age 60 died Sweden, including one child age 10. That's 4.1% deaths.

To put perspective, 213 countries reporting COVID-19 infections, 150 less deaths **in total** Sweden age bracket 0 59 years.

This includes Australia, double population, 104 deaths total. Na... bud case lungs get messed keep stocks, hsa, liquid assets family needs. 

I came depression era concepts around saving, money emergency, needing help someone else.

I also never ""locked down"" due essential US industry.

I entirely agree username. end lockdown could better coordination leadership effort. 

Now I'm sure areas get locked second time (Ex Texas bars reclosing) cause business trash 2nd lot supplies lose money. Lol must've missed riots maybe woke mob force us comply like they're already trying force us things best interest. He's wrong. cause, yes. forget social distancing for? think average age infected half was? protesters young ignoring social distancing. spike lines perfectly incubation period. then! read ‚Äòshould‚Äô things. want get hurdle take actions get done. country pissed, leadership torn apart hands changed, end, better it.  know like 25,000,000 people died since start year right?  Kentucky usually bit far north get ton dust Sahara dust cloud, blows Sahara desert tends blanket area Amazon Rainforest gulf coast US. years carrying lot dust usual (apparently biggest last 50 years), might get thin dusting. find maps dust search around forgot Florida man flat earther I'm Californian born raised rural area. started r/Masks4All 3 months ago. freedumb folk place. Hope fall didnt break anything! He's trying help virus, he's helpless, prideful, moron. 

He helpless, born silver spoon never met problem ignore, threaten, pay off, divorce, file chapter 11.

He prideful, drew line sand early making political issue incapable admitting mistake death division caused.

He moron, literally can't understand basic concepts exponential growth simple mitigation procedures. Still spinning story? Vote think ""in know""... lives, people snickered huge gaps understanding every basic concept.     
but know something nobody else does, there's conspiracy! dumb they're smart one talk condescendingly everyone. Sick, I'm gonna take 2 3 would thought cases gonna go millions people gathered together close proximity protest? absolutely shocking! Yeah, one seems slightest bit concerned here. think title little sensationalist. Pretty much every virus cause Guillain-Barre, even cold. Actually, surgery, getting shot. even virus-specific.

This proving ""link"" direct COVID-induced illness, rare immune reaction triggered basically virus plus million things. Real man here. wear mask since February, anyone doesn‚Äôt *especially now* nothing overgrown baby. part solution, part problem. Serious question. kinds people get news? Clearly consistent source grew conspiracy theories. positive news deaths still down. Hopefully new phase massive testing numbers mean cases mean huge spike deaths Yes, virus sensitive tested! putting anyone's bullshit! need 'Muricans puttin' microscope judging motives! Shit, blame it. wants sit around judged trying kill thousand people that's reason existing!? Vote Science! Fell bad man tough yourself. Neither hospitalizations. idea cooking books deaths cases seems weird. Testing certainly incrfeased, doesnt explain spike. Ive heard media reports (but seen data) cases skewing younger. Hard say, gonna say cooking books, youd better bring sauce that. death count missed NJ adding almost 2000 deaths June 24th 25th. people caught it, course, numbers aren‚Äôt there.

This whole topic literally 1 reporter. sarcastic. said sounds totally reasonable correct me. copy BLM? several friends vax. staying fuck home much possible, wearing masks need venture forth. 

(Don't hate me, kids vaxxed.) Idk getting downvoted, that's literally called highschool school economics class. would work [contact tracers told ask people attended afraid of?  wear seat belt? gun permit? smoke detectors? check green cards employees? turn two forms ID bank accounts?

Yeah PROVEN work. Masks much. 

I'll take downvotes leave thank much.  New York less 1% case growth rate right now. 

New York closer herd immunity anybody, growth rate lower definition. *global really see much false negatives. places, 85x higher thought. also read show nasal cavity detectable levels someone starts really showing symptoms. Also, originally allowing people get tested. know true Houston went whole testing fiasco 2 months took 20 business days get results back well. Lol people hoarding toilet paper bottled water. think theyd leave masks shelves essential workers? 

Hes almost 80. Hes literally head cdc longer ive alive. virus couple months old. made decisions evidence achieve benefit. Changed guidance new info came out. Im sure trying get at...that wants people die? Dude suited treat ebola patients. Hes politician profiting this. Hes literally pioneer study diseases. I'll follow advice armchair epidemiologists mean hospital employees got furloughed due lack patients able work again? Made smile. Thanks that! company behind said numerous times working get supplied globally little cost possible. Plus already gave billion dollars. OK fatty 200 million people would recover US herd immunity would leave millions    I'm 4 years sober thats used do. drinking handle vodka 12 steel reserves every day. Trying drink much bar would go broke less week. say Venezuela rational, functioning government? 

Jesus Christ. Sweden gambled lost: 
  


I agree, Sweden start something wildfire-like spread disease. good start would recommendation use face masks public places.  Yeah fine me. want warn shit tonne people going keep dying tragic random shit world lifetime pretty much forever. fun stewing forever. You‚Äôre fine. don‚Äôt wear mask outside unless know somewhere can‚Äôt avoid keeping distance people try avoid places.  deaths aren‚Äôt time highs? that‚Äôs good? think reading somewhere previous peak maybe 1/10 true numbers due testing? Well, deaths lack far behind. makes better Trump, yet still beneath pedophile personally think moved threat level midnight  Well, he‚Äôs wrong. data whatsoever shows wearing mask social distancing increases risk significantly. Try keep science please Fox diverting like crazy. seen single big headline site surge last two days seemingly they've relegated covid coverage page, sight. almost nothing negative coverage protests. *sigh* put quotes ‚Äúmaybe COVID doesn‚Äôt kill people anymore‚Äù, said that? said seven weeks decline number deaths isn‚Äôt statistical anomaly. 

The trailing indicator piece isn‚Äôt even accurate look data late April/early May. Look two weeks prior first peak, two weeks after. keep running curve. death rate % shifted quickly down. Something happened.

Nothing goofy President did, nothing WHO/CDC did, either treatment became much much better virus lost steam. Yeah, testing, anywhere near high that... I‚Äôm Florida anxiety levels roof, job finally decided close everyone lost coworker got positive case refused tell us department work YES. Holy shit thousand times yes. work busy restaurant college town. people wearing masks employees. social distance max capacity every night. people crowd tight space, spread germs, disseminate population go home. EVERY FUCKING DAY. like chicken pox party hell never ends. Dont think karens. Everyone thinks okay nothing. Weve already lost 2 employees week quarantined sick. Except countries run competent leaders locked early much control. rest world has, whats wrong USA hmmmmm..ü§î Abbott retard.

He concerned Jade Helm 15 Yeah, except scenario couple group members decided actively sabotage project too. dying Chinese virus different dying Chinese virus.

Gunshot wound head? Chinese virus? CV-19 death!

Go back watching CNN/MSNBC hack.   Common sense buddy. Try sometime. Something tells takes month's recover develop symptoms weeks It‚Äôs illegal election interference.  First, spikes cities large scale protests like Minneapolis NYC. Second, Boston, governor encouraged protestors free tests results came back 2% positive, much lower positive rates see southern states.

The difference protests outdoors participants mostly masked. Many people mingling south indoors due hot summer masked. Also, many protesters seems, lot people hanging bars, restaurants, malls, shops, etc. point fact contributions protests minimal. I'll keep ready. Lol. logic questioning gods ability create killer virus? think gods viruses ineffective need mask? turn back gods viruses tut tut... stay home. end jail. Adopt ‚ÄúBeing outdoors solo activity much lower risk‚Äù

Have tried jogging mask on? fun also pose huge risk. Oh look, classic whataboutism. Yeah man.. idiot leader deadly situations.. Duh, people arent gonna wear masks disinhibited alcohol. go, boys girls, inevitable happening. Damn right embarrassing. Americans hillbillies Earth. worry guys Trump God save them... show epi curves places practice masking

I like wishful thinking: data help science deniers. 

Stay plucky. Hairstylists getting wrecked all
This. one talking it. industry broken.  Thanks laugh!   They're same. Indian PM too. Unscientific minds, power-hungry psychopaths gambling people's lives.  Still, keep mask ready case see someone can't easily go around them. Please. Seems pretty unhelpful now. America doesn‚Äôt need hindsight needs leadership.  times we‚Äôve criticized wearing masks public - told we‚Äôre mindless sheep masks don‚Äôt help. we‚Äôre Nashville, even boonies you‚Äôd expect more. find evidence

yeah ok. doesn‚Äôt take Einstein know large groups gathering without social distancing masks spread virus. Nice try though think question whether common outlier.

Thinking - makes sense many people would mild lung viral infection notice. would explain asymptomatic spread. think question, common, lung damage measurable and/or permanent.

Healthy people might able withstand 5 - 10 percent reduction lung function blink eye. youth.    ‚ÄúSLOW TESTING DOWN‚Äù ‚Äî dumbass masquerading president virus concedes submits too.  Two weeks infection death, time positive COVID-19 PCR test death. Pff. It'll go away April. mean July. Honestly, see fewer 100,000 cases, think that's tremendous job. mean 200,000.   think may thinking flus ability this, quite that.

Influenza actually enters viral particle several (11 13 think) distinct RNA strands.

Coronavirus actually contains one RNA strand viral genome.

So someone infected different kinds influenza, viral genomes mix using separate strands. easy coronavirus genome combine another one. (You would need copy error essentially) Bazinga  Look many thousands confirmed cases past week, starting act... wtf. hell wait full blown control wild fire anything. top people listening, fuck. Ray Steven's wrote song #fuckdisney needs start trending IG twitter. Theres statewide mask mandate Florida It‚Äôs smart least. It‚Äôs classic Reddit pseudo- intellectual nonsense written someone thinks they‚Äôre expert they‚Äôve reading coronavirus internet couple months. thanks I‚Äôll continue live life. seem tucking scared you‚Äôre welcome stay home. stops 24th looks like. Wait till show numbers 25th 26th thing. Fla appears making jump ridiculous speed... Exponential growth. Oh, also call people ""j"" word. Like, rhymes work. got deleted one, even though pretty clear case. Translation: 


Norway gained control spread infection country - Sweden cases continue increase.

Now, Norwegian doctors infection control doctors demanding Sweden change strategy.

\- feel sorry Sweden, says Bj√∏rg Marit Andersen, former infection prevention physician Dagbladet.

Since Sweden started testing more, number cases skyrocketed, least noticed. organization recently listed Sweden one eleven European countries high rate infection.

The spread Norway less - many experts country believe Sweden change strategy.

\- Sweden played lost comes corona strategy. know sure March, obvious everyone, says doctor Gunnar Hasle.

Norway one countries Europe closed large parts country spring.

&amp;#x200B;

**""Should see good effect""**

Bj√∏rg Marit Andersen tells Dagbladet ""the thing know working"" stop spread infection shut country. Therefore, like Gunnar Hasle, thinks Sweden rethink strategy.

\- think Sweden would see good effect shutdown now. addition, summer high temperatures, something also seen curb virus, tells Dagbladet, adding complete shutdown.

\- Swedes allowed travel, go restaurant go store. stick time use facemasks.

The former infection protection physician says Public Health Authority know elderly vulnerable group understand would happen many employees without expertise infection protection.

\- feel sorry Sweden. country tremendous faith leader infection control (Anders Tegnell) trusted him. Show offs.

-NSW people mentally ill.  Go back analyze data. doesnt I‚Äôm expert read twins carry 9 months together, 18 months previously supposed confirm NYC, one compacted places Earth. best example use. 

Point lost you. Forget it. Enjoy Rona shit. youd compare flu? USA.... Hold beer, stupid enough take challenge! Good know rest world exist. Thanks bringing back earth lining protective barrier bacteria. grow back virus makes ur immune system attack lining cells. weakens lungs dude. I'm sorry educated yourself. Analogous car. web page informational overview useful data. Many states disseminate covid-19 data public - deaths, cases, hospital beds available, ICU occupancy rates, etc, explained reason America #1 world (in pandemic numbers)  Sweden shit show... One countries still isolated rest western europe (the one UK)

Seriously, hospitals simply totally outnumbered country really low population density outside stockholm.

If calculate numbers down, death infection rates rather similar us, roughtly 9 mio people overall distributed big france. Sorry party literally encouraged mass gatherings, riots, looting, arson, etc. 

I find rich sit high horse blame GOP sides blame. We've lockdown since middle march. opened restaurants partial capacity indoor seating Wednesday (June 24). got hit hard fast beginning partially due high population density. That's thing exponential growth, sometimes take really long time ramp up, does, hard handle. Technically article wrong, lung damage, asymptomatic. fact, would clear symptom. Anecdotal, mom COVID March- moderate case- several months later lung functioning steady 80% prior. knows ever improve? symptoms gone. ""honey, getting covid test?""

""I got exposed someone""

""where?""

....

""how?""

.... I‚Äôve got brilliant idea. Everyone concerned COVID, wear mask. Boom. Problem solved, right? you‚Äôre worried getting it, wear mask. Seriously. absolutely right. fuck think make wear one. They‚Äôre miserable it‚Äôs 90+ degrees here. fucking thank you. I‚Äôll take chances. Covid taken 6 spot leading cause death (from Alzheimers). think easily overtake stroke though may overtake respiratory accidents, though Trumps continued actions, may yet still make third. That's thinking. I've lived Northeast, currently live Florida. here, winter people want outside. Summer, much. Everyone inside probably driving spread virus. Everywhere else might see surge colder months. 36% day

but feel like SC heading direction. charleston mostly free-for-all. ton tourists too. Lmao, NY gave everyone 3 month head start guess everyone wanted find Go back grade 1 math asking Redddit solutions? demanding government? I‚Äôm Indiana working Jacksonville one local guys bought universal season passes taking family every weekend since opened. hoping children's teachers go strike. deserve handed them, keep kids classroom. Free WiFi? Key difference? honestly think large majority Southern neighbors legitimate morons. never much opinion Americans COVID came around see many actually are. Millions people protesting virus? literally see shit here. I'm liberal province family conservative one. sides coin taken shit serious since day 1.

The U.S fucking brain dead large part it. Yes. every employee told help enforce. causing spikes can‚Äôt say one isn‚Äôt that‚Äôs bull shit. dude... knows virus still won‚Äôt put mask isolate even protect wife kid. Proceeds tell everyone it‚Äôs flu thinks he‚Äôs stroke goes hospital. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Wait, going one busiest days base experience that? crowd calendars tell best time go want avoid crowds. Fk, imagine cross 10 million cases covid second time 3 time ! certainly help bushfire crisis. Look, agree China deserves blame got here, fault fuck fix fucking problem.  

Fix problem *then* point finger. Don‚Äôt point finger say fault mess. 

Initially yes, fault. handling continues fucking terrible. 

Our leaders continuing throw heads sand, aren‚Äôt asses, base continues eat up. 

China isn‚Äôt fault shitload people refuse wear fucking mask. 

China isn‚Äôt fault governors continually refuse put people business. 

China isn‚Äôt fault federal government throws money businesses let rest us figure ourselves. 

China isn‚Äôt fault people believe 5G fucking cause this. 

China isn‚Äôt fault continue pretend like virus situation mass protests (rightly still poorly timed.)

We *know* it‚Äôs initially China‚Äôs fault. information absolutely nothing get us situation.


In closing, stay safe, wear fucking mask. goes back America's original sin. 


In April, media started reporting COVID-19 disproportionately affecting African Americans. Shortly that, anti-lockdown protests started, along mask defiance.

I strongly suspect leaders anti-mask reopening movement stopped taking pandemic seriously thought would hit non-white communities harder maybe even hope make worse minority communities. ""My life sucks, want care others e cares me? Fuck you""

America nutshell Imagine working one.. coworkers getting sick.. protection won‚Äôt last forever oxygen tank, probably wear mask there‚Äôs supplemental oxygen delivered straight nostrils, mask mask. Someone correct I‚Äôm wrong. I‚Äôm nurse, work neonatal unit don‚Äôt experience COPD patients. logically, would think cannula on, oxygen availability still adequate. Also, people don‚Äôt want wear mask express loudly, clearly showing great oxygen levels. talk/yell sentence sentence, oxygenation issue severe enough excuse wearing mask. small amount people wouldn‚Äôt okay wearing mask stay home much possible. agree sentiment. person Donald trump care is...Donald trump?

Shocking. reap sow. Children men scenario without vaccine Treatment Coronavirus getting effective patients younger presumably suffer symptoms bad.

 Hopefully hospitals overrun. antibody tests junk. 50% possible false positive rate 10% false negative rate. Less accurate literal coin toss. wrong want Trump get Coronavirus? Applebees survive this, Joe's Taco Hut cannot

a decent UBI solves problem. Exactly, there's bunch cities massive protests spikes coronavirus cases. entirely possible reopening early large protests drove rise cases. 

The biggest epicentre cities right (Houston Phoenix) large protests reopenings. Dallas smaller fewer protests Houston, saw smaller spike cases Houston did. Houston eclipses DFW cases beginning approximately two weeks protests, even though two cities restaurant/bar regulations place: There's weekend/brunch buffet club near called Tits Grits seriously! combination Karen customers shitty owners/managers problem exploiting labor make quick buck. manager staffed server place 30 tables 4th july--his excuse raining lmao. made virtually tips definitely made pretty penny sales. go back!! got :) would hilarious, one Florida general also redic. wait mass death react? worry states worse NY. Lots people drinking right next street though, even shit June gloom weather. NBA could return play Canada much safer won‚Äôt course. It‚Äôs foreign concept play Florida. hahaha. 'nuff said. too. thanks. hate disappointing nephew, *can‚Äôt.* I‚Äôve working whole time. 

The me-me-me-bored thing *killing* me. Bored? Let‚Äôs trade off, then. essential workers trade places furloughers. get house like want (not like want lol, careful wish for), us busting ass three months take break. Everyone know whose working home entire time, *especially* us critical services health care past burnout. 

I seniority choice back March‚Äîto furlough stay on. cross training experience enough needed, chose stay. Partly stability, mostly objectively better choice good others. happy it, together. makes want cry thinking now. I‚Äôm worn husk looks like soon *nothing.* feel betrayed community. I‚Äôm disappointed. tired. Could also 25,000+ (with decent probability) saw clip US President saying 15 June 'numbers like we've never seen before'. got right now. Oh sure numbers we've never seen - WRONG DIRECTION. Let's take closer look birth certificate. 
@GovRonDeSantis described 2006 ""working directly detainees Guantanamo Bay."" DeSantis smart douche Happiest place earth! /s Global death toll officially surpassed 500,000: 500,162 It‚Äôs advice, it‚Äôs data. NBER study shows increase stay home compliance even strongly lockdown orders cities protests. larger protest, larger effect. thus fact protests actually helped covid19.  find hilarious.

The party without personal responsibility. abortion party. party tells can‚Äôt tell pregnant bodies.

Well. Isn‚Äôt ironic. Reap sew. Yay New York!!!! Man killing me, I‚Äôve fucking North Carolina since shit started, person wearing mask since then. hands 9000 times day social distance, sanitize. don‚Äôt know hell rest people thinking. get crap might well walk bridge. Screw N.C. nationwide mask shortage time didn‚Äôt want run masks like toilet paper. god knows Americans would have. sorry.

It's simple. Two different liberties (freedom mandatory masks, freedom disease spread others) at-odds - one protected legislation, isn't. blame lawmakers able escape logical contradiction cleanly, let's pretend like there's ample helping hypocrisy served talk restricting liberties.  find people pro protests concede protests contribute spread. hear lot anti-maskers pro-openers attributing spread solely protests. evidence course but... Dear Senate,
I believe enough. allergy stupidity...does mean apply inflammable fluids deem stupid? No. 

Its called tolerance clearly TRUMP zealots need taught lesson November. lie it? Unless dating contact tracer Say medical condition go business. allowed CA guideline. people want fight. retarded clickbait article, I'm sure can't cross 10 million mark twice ‚ÄúHow kill many people possible?‚Äù goes 93 mins Masks big part it. general, NYers took seriously unlike states care. Let's take closer look birth certificate. 
@GovRonDeSantis described 2006 ""working directly detainees Guantanamo Bay."" Yes. hits retirement communities nursing homes, absolutely will. Florida's average age significantly higher NYC. calc'ing that? I'm seeing 17.5K confirmed &amp; 21K confirmed + prob; NYC Metro Population ~13M. 0.13% - 0.16% low end.

NYC also appears large outlier, outside city rest NY half death-rate. believe that‚Äôs mostly happened got curve much quicker it. also think under-reported olympics supposed holding hope would still happen. Let learn hard way wife works Publix phone walked day mask order went effect.

Counted 10 customers without masks within thirty seconds. ridiculous. That's quite achievement. Let's take closer look birth certificate. 
@GovRonDeSantis described 2006 ""working directly detainees Guantanamo Bay."" income 2018. 2019. I'm one everything early/way actually due. 

So filed February 2019 taxes. Fuck guess  Maybe would helpful found way virus 101 sentences? Seems like lot people smart enough see what‚Äôs happening don‚Äôt foundational knowledge put things together Covid joys feather flock together...  Nooooo wayyyyyy wowwwwww whooo wouldaaaaa thoughtttttttttt Whatever airlines continue screw passengers pandemic airlines never fly again. want get specific here. since 1980 medical school days. funny people think rights family member admitted. bother touch market parts anyone purchase delivered. I'm certain dying preventable diseases believe it, never fully recovered Swine Flu. People vs people? government. Try political way first work, look French Revolution ask time. tremendous Americans. British friend. elderly wife (also elderly underlying health condition. feel would ""goner"" ever caught COVID. Yet refuse wear mask.

He's nice guy smart (he's Mensa). He's conservative. want wear mask refuses listen anytime argue favor them. Coronavirus approximately 3 months ago.  

I one lucky ones, able recover overnight.  

Once breathing pain got much handle, 3rd day, went nearby ER around midnight 15 minutes ventilator total couple hours tests, waiting, giving blood, getting IV - felt like like million bucks - or, least going die next hours.  

  

My question is, resume working lifting weights? 

I've already jogged there, even lifted couple times...  

I'm curious bad idea lift weights point.  

Thanks advance. live Canberra, Australia opposition leader said weeks ago ""The pandemic over"" territory active cases.

...No, there's plenty cases around country overseas even there's none here. dumb thing say. pandemic sure hell over. Also fact Japan island nation. Things work way different island nations. look Japan, Taiwan, New Zeeland etc. Including outdoors. get jailed breathing freely completely empty street, harming absolutely noone. people still understand universal praise mask wearing. There's nothing really good this. parents doctors find much harder jobs without physically seeing patient personally prefer people newly come US long term citizens friends. Why, real ingrained, hyperdesensitized children US produces. superpower, wealthy, made substandard graft idiots running govt. Trump represents tiny fraction population, look ratings, shows that. someone almost everyone wants impeached, put prison. dumb mouth incited people rebellious idea masks, persistent surges mostly fault stubborn fools think infringes rights. One sick person wearing mask get whole building people sick, Trumpites, Stubborn compatriots dont care others, thinking makes seem independent cool, surges everywhere, worst Covid response Earth. Dont blame american citizens actions orange-utan POTUS seat small fraction conservative nutjobs refuse wear masks. mistake aren't. last time looked protest would've around week ago, indeed fault. Thank clarifying point, wether true. I'll look this. :) Simple reopening precautions measures could avoided spike. Require masks public places, take person‚Äôs temperature allowing entry, move restaurants bars outside, etc. US can‚Äôt even simple things. expected nothing less south east knew make government work him, would be. He's dumb go far, know how. Marylander, news want hear. Keep up, keep masks on.

I tell what, went Sam's Club day past week. Every one entire store mask on. great staying safe. Keep up, keep masks on! Upmc consistently playing covid pandemic since forced stop elective procedures. cases area rising green phase, downplay again. empire decline, little while. Covid makes obvious. Yeah think Gov. every country need ban full flights (minus cargo) permit 1/2 full flight. Yup wash clothes every time get back outside house too. Rubber gloves must well. study talked lot household last couple weeks. went send kid back pre-school don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs safe. We‚Äôve already paid year.

If schools safe, hopefully we‚Äôll know September. right away. We'll see bad gets, many smaller measures added, sum measures end similar lock down. 

At least spent trillions dollars exact spot worse. know number people Texas, Florida cali coming back NY soon month long vscations.. bet none quarantine. know fact one coming back work week Ahahahahhahahah self own

r/selfawarewolves Anybody coughed awkward silence? doctor goes great detail COVID patients hospital experiencing less severe symptoms complications. 

Also, say focus case count. Rather, focus. ‚ÄúWe need change mindset focus exclusively number cases, severity illness. shouldn‚Äôt counting diagnosed infection,‚Äù Yealy said. ‚ÄúFor vast majority people testing positive, illness mild, don‚Äôt even know symptoms COVID-19 infection.‚Äù Notice # deaths gone much. actual mortality rate anybody 60 years old less 0.1% visited family Texas week ago home health nurse told ‚Äúgranola‚Äù people worried COVID. substantially liberal family (which shouldn‚Äôt matter digress) kept mouth shut counted days left. won't, won't. Sigh. I‚Äôm glad huge labor vs liberal shitfight whole thing - helped lot common goal amongst right thing. Sure Scotty copped lot slack, aussies big entitled whiners too, glad followed scientific recommendations. Yeah thought gonna hit sooner. There‚Äôs answer takes 60-70 days go full throttle population hundreds 69 day‚Äôs ago 9000 yesterday. Lol Hospitalizations going roof...in handful areas think virus intelligent point.

It infected Trump made even retarded symptom knew leadership. longer fly flag. stopped reciting pledge classroom. don‚Äôt give crap celebrating Independence Day year. ashamed country it‚Äôs citizens. know good Americans, bad far many. worst turd Oval Office. findings suggest short-term gains privatization health-care systems (such cost-cutting cases shorter waiting times clinics) weighed long-term risks lower capacity (in equipment staffing), less equitable coverage, lower adherence medical standards often over-prescription antibiotics. case COVID-19, equity element may played large role, uninsured people feeling ill likely avoid costly testing treatment, well less likely able work home, thus facilitating spread virus know argument usually presented side, think perhaps ever since Madeline O'Hare. point somehow became important protect rights practice responsibility Wrong. 

The correct answer ""I would listen doctors scientist's recommendation"" LOL see videos covering protests? I'll admit lot people wearing masks, yes, social distancing thrown window. Sorry, low IQ that's ok. way stupider though.

Lol stupid people always think they're smarter next man. dude shut stop making look bad.

No dont think will. many blacklivesmatter killed teh skyrocketing crime rate spreading infections?

The US bungled covid response showing epic political bias nation go history one biggest failures 20th century.

Your nation shaped 20th century created biggest genuine middle class Earth Wearing mask obligation fellow man woman get killed sick.

When people understand? try move fast can. still wash hands even though leave house?

Has abundantly clear whole life? use bathroom, wash hands. eat, wash hands. handle raw meat, wash hands. work outside? 

I personally give pass people pull mask time time running, biking, working, etc 6 ft others. 

It‚Äôs people can‚Äôt bothered wear one ever real problem. know anything reduces human population pro-life given damaging humans currently eco-system.

Yeah morbid, also true fuck asking prove it. saying things fit narrative, evidence. Show us evidence shut fuck up. Unless virus kills many don‚Äôt functioning economy anyway! 

(I know that‚Äôs exaggeration.) downside making mask political issue people dislike current administration wear masks going survive, everyone else went ""but muh freedoms"" wear mask going get get sick.

I'd say downside GOP, survivors going stuck taking care people severely disabled due virus, *everyone* higher risk due actions selfish few. Yes apparently, employees wear even half noses uncovered even saw completely face. love feelings? Leadership starts top trickles down. Enough said. NJ opened past Mon 6/22 Agreed. talking specifically Karens refuse wear ""they get triggered"", medical conditions and/or throw tantrums asked wear one.

Right **now** think there's people dismissing covid altogether, nobody convince 2nd (still 1st lmao) wave covid US BLM. guess since said it. probably start gyms. wish Canada would hop onto one. Yes. He‚Äôs conquering evil. It‚Äôs simple. stay Canada cooties filled American! drunk people social distance drunk people actually start spewing virus reason?

Or both? (Sincd obviously number 1 true) Here's reality. young &amp; healthy nearly zero risk. Sure u may get sick, get it, probably wont even show symptoms. Sick people stay home, vulnerable people stay home. rest us need keep living. yet trying say employees liable bring virus in. article frustrating doesn‚Äôt define terms. know what's proven work, way America handled far.

You're right. dont think shouldve urged blm protest LIE saying they're risk contract covid. BLM important covid evern took like 2 3 week break covid? 
Also think putting covid+ patients working homes proven work cuomo hope again. try something new radical

Nah bruh I'm radical. id tearing city. wear mask weeks see gets you.

Haven't month+ now. Remember lockdowns supposed 2 weeks 2 here. we're danger. think initial rise spikes related Memorial day, subsequent relaxing states starting around time. get concern there, there's lot vaccines part triggers specific antibodies. That's skip safety trials time. Yes wear sunglasses inside, better nothing. Coronavirus infect people they're protesting. aware social justice issues. blows mind people seem care all. 9/11 deeply entrenched popular memory US, mainly high death toll was. shit hitting fan April many people dying *per day* still nobody seemed give shit  perfectly said edited make filler country even paying doses getting doses two seperate events. point UK vaccinated enough population able justify shipping vaccinations out? Trump religious average televangelist ‚Äî true believers, the. con men know abuse trust rubes. Trump innate understanding evangelicals think despite personally believing anything himself, exploits make wants. 

And there‚Äôs lot overlap evangelicals 5G conspiracy theorists. Even crazies don‚Äôt personally attend church culturally influenced evangelicals around them, basically think way. sub say reacting normally.

But piece shit board grandparents want. want sound like fully understand what's going firmly say want now, considered first wave cases US never really dropped? flattened curve around 20-30k day, never went down, started going upwards due BLM protests, people congregating. 

I fully support BLM, unlucky started global crisis diminished progress made. shit, sport. greatly reduces chances spreading it. Nobody claiming 100% efficacy. Walmart doesn‚Äôt deliver, I‚Äôm rural area. county 10,000 people. it‚Äôs largest county within 100 mile radius. psycho neighbor leaned car talked ear off. Made pretty upset uncomfortable. need grow backbone tell people fuck off.  devastating critique world scientific community blew opportunity save lives, scientific rivalry obtuseness part so-called experts.  

Well worth reading whole thing. LOL failed life. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Im sorry loss yours. think Trust vaccin rushed fast. good reason takes lot time normally R‚Äôs pretty much mix evil stupidity politicians sit stfu.. wont. Doctors/scientists, etc calling shots one case benefits culturally homogenous society vs constant conflict subgroups diverse society doesn‚Äôt see one big body, rather competitors seeking win prize wealth privilege expense players. Yeah sure, save money months ago.


And two months ago? One month ago? 


I‚Äôm trying understand talking point made, reason? Local officials still require facemasks though. mayor Orange Country put requirement place, example. 

For whatever reason, Desantis trying super hard avoid forcing people panhandle wearing masks outbreaks peninsula, order would do. Thanks, Dont think it‚Äôs corrected though. still debates whether trust science even outside masks going pointed trust scientists. done damage last years. science truth need say it‚Äôs favorable time. Day Day America seems getting like movie Idiocracy. become epidemiologist? Exactly this. go walk run keep mine lowered, I‚Äôm approaching someone pull up. Especially it‚Äôs someone doesn‚Äôt mask - like show doing. believe Abbott. last nearly 40 years received nearly $14,000/mo settlement personal injury lawsuit - working whatever could limit claims tort reform. Abbott looks competent Dan Patrick even bigger lunatic, they're terrible leaders complete hypocrites. would rather pay people service industry spread disease stop it. think are??? Smart?? comment r/agedlikemilk 

9000 cases yesterday. Anti-Masker opening day. Can't mind-control Americans right thing?  spreading blatantly false information? ranked among best beaches US many times. Lovely place. live Texas. It‚Äôs infuriating (though surprising) hear try walk back pretend like policies leadership aren‚Äôt blame here. everywhere (at least country formerly called ""America"") survived Spanish Flu much less technology education. We'll fine. cost lot lives, money loss respect, we'll fine.

And dark part feels things natural. population animals gets large, something always eventually seems pop try thin numbers, usually takes least prepared. Unfortunately tho there's usually collateral damage well. point still contract disease home. Wearing mask make impossible. agree masks limited effectiveness especially see people made masks of. Well, least trying, like older woman wearing party hat face saw once. humorous also sad desperate shows overwhelming level medical illiteracy. But, leaders refuse wear masks country consistent message? self isolated away family since nightmare began keep safe alternative scares me. Face Masks used tool isolation sounds evidence based practices like hand washing social distancing. sounds like real tragedy wish way could help spread word. can't drum support tell someone ""I read reddit comment"" think ‚Äúidentity‚Äù would better word choice ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù comment. guess around .5% maybe little low, ballpark. think right safe guess range would .25 - .75 ways explain people difference infection immune response?

My idea ‚ÄúA virus makes sick contagious, immune system fighting virus makes *feel* sick. takes immune system week get ready fight COVID-19 it‚Äôs system‚Äù. Texas whole bunch fucked shame it'll mostly people can't think follow leaders say whatever.

Most comments say people wear masks take precautions get ventilator even they're infected. know like hpv could serious consequences years later. people speaking/yelling directly extended time vs yelling straight ahead. safety measure $25 temperature gun. Also 10 million total cases. ""Here end June get it. really make sense.""

how earth make sense lmao ??? makes 1000000% sense ... Removed repost already top sub's front page yesterday here: actually currently front page here: sounds really annoying deal with. least recognizes need stay home able so. Plus nice yard, she‚Äôs set! Chicago 30,000 people one protest, multiple protests thousands strong. Yet COVID-19 cases Chicago still declining. DC, NYC, many places. agree unfortunately Texas basically American version Saudi Arabia. Separation church state thing there. basically run church. Seriously people even eat out? 
Cooking home much better. 

You go get burger right? 
They season meat. 
They use fresh ingredients. 
And lucky get hot fries. 
Some best food I've cooked HOME. 

I've worked alot fast food basically getting someone's version day give fuck made correctly. still struggle compile data state. YES! feeling exactly. blame internet want truth we‚Äôve put proper emphasis education country actually actively sabotaged it. Thus wind educated populace can‚Äôt make informed decisions understand nuanced ideas. keep hearing MIL say ""I dont covid, feel fine, dont need socially distance mask."" people frustratingly dumb. Also heard FIL call ""hoax."" 

Like, hoax? think people actually dying? dont understand...sigh Brett Hart gave deserved.

Yeah Brat angel assaulting Boss. fuck would anybody right mind realize would happen? all. article spiraling cases caused people ignoring masks **and** social distancing, yet latter almost never discussed. contributing spread directly, Americans see massive protests flagrantly violating rule, everybody praising instead concerned health risk (sometimes even dismissing concerns *are* raised), possibly interpreted social distancing important Look real americans independent folks. Suggest wear mask get compliance.....demand assimilation..you gonna get fuck you! yet much want true multiple reports multiple cities show otherwise.

Komo news, run fucking Sinclair Media, even reported less 1% protestors getting tested Seattle positive.

Less 1%. every god damn person wearing mask screamed didnt. God, would've thought, MASKS WORK Sorry, presumed everyone sub following. 

A quick search could find articles. First one May 40 million unemployed. Stating rate far higher.
I update recent articles, find them. But, sure suffice. can‚Äôt see it‚Äôs heading case numbers backend higher 3 months ago. can‚Äôt reason you. 4th July needs cancelled right places significant community spread. would save many lives people barbecue day. always happy go war tiny countries but, mattered, waited 2 years :P ahem....AMERICAN ""CHRISTIANS"" YOU. READ BIBLE? DID. WRONG. mean obvious churches started advocating Antichrist tRUMP. agree also find ""half population average intelligence"" reasoning super ironic whenever used. idiot sister took entire family Miami vacation. complained telling story entering sort high end shop immediately asked wearing mask. said one moment could make exception? shop worker said mask, entry. sister's response far walk back car get it. (In telling tale, akin difficulties Frodo faced bringing ring Mt. Doom.) finally relented clear going let made long, arduous slog back retrieve vehicle... PARKED FUCKING CURB FRONT. supposed vacation Portugal right US. obviously, butt home right now. Fingers crossed summer 2021, we'll see US finds new ways eff then. Lol authoritarian indoctrination machine goes brrrr government official asking care rights fucking scary. said that, wearing mask best interest it. Love something much Trumo loves killing Americans  Nope! Bad bot! quote directly article. They‚Äôre insane they‚Äôre dangerous idiots Asking people hit shoulder shoulder bar pandemic self quarantine.

What could go wrong 

We release serial murders rapists stop murdering raping too. Really? people coming China virus cases are, claim, low? :( Stay safe. Harris county? YAY FIRST TIME EVER! Tell half country wanted Orange Man leader. FYI sad 6-8 weeks compare countries I‚Äôve tracking covid tolls using John Hopkins map, I‚Äôve found consistently reliable. it‚Äôs matter looking covid deaths NYC comparing population. well guess company survive til end year? Trying anything possibly interpreted *p-olitic*al removed.

It's faceless statistics never humanized. number, name. Humans easily driven emotion reason, need look evidence video showing one awful, unfair death dramatic detail causing reaction 100,000 dying alone (at time) COVID-19. COVID-19 victims, giving nationally covered obituaries show ""number"" actually human life, family, friends, legacy, hopes dreams, cut short disease, full weight tragedy become unbearably real even otherwise unreasonable.

This also includes protesters realize risking hundreds times many lives trying save, emotion salient numbers. Blacks account 21% COVID-19 deaths, **25,000** far. matter measure issue they're protesting about, irrational think even remotely comparable threat COVID-19. They'd save lives really worst thing pandemic standpoint, people coming disparate areas, crowding together, screaming,"" transmit virus easily, said Dr. John Swartzberg, clinical professor emeritus infectious diseases vaccinology University California Berkeley School Public Health. ""And they're going back communities.""

The worst part though many people told us dangerous mass gatherings praising protests instead pointing risk. people possibly interpret except social distancing matter no, CDC disagrees masks eliminate risk. Social distancing still keep **6 feet** others. cloth face cover **not substitute** social distancing.

We need recognize even people share views need held accountable part, fail. Flattened curve? like virus that's run course. Right said 8 weeks may may 2 months. sure. Don‚Äôt know math  Yup, bar/resturant apartment, full right now, people sitting close eachother aswell. We're fucked people dont care Yes, get prioritized medical treatment go someone else might help briefly explaining difference infection immune response is.

Eg. ‚ÄúThe virus makes sick, immune system fighting virus makes feel sick. takes immune system week get ready fight virus‚Äù. think guy got plasma something way back when. recall correctly, he‚Äôs 3 extremely close calls (same room time) infected. I‚Äôm calling bs Jail little harsh, mind seeing $50-$100 fines given out. I'm Austin area, biggest fear past several months Texas going go Full Texas.

Texas went Full Texas. parks many resorts scheduled open believe they'll able fully isolate everyone. Even something simple staff working parks one day ""bubble"" next (like shuttle drivers, food service, etc.) serious risk contamination. recipe disaster. currently live outside Georgetown, others' benefit, 20 minute drive outside Placerville. girlfriend works Placerville visit often. words, I'm even rural people quoted article. 

As such, usually shop Placerville least week. noticeable uptick mask usage Placerville -- Georgetown -- still hold outs. disappointing. like make shit Fricken entitled Orange County. absolutely blame people. It‚Äôs sides. government supposed smarter that, safety constituents heart. Guess don't. Sorry. America people believe lived man named Adam pet dinosaur.  country comprised spoiled children. never seen way, might right. MuH fReEdOmS! makes sense now. Yes. air flow. Restaurants bars worst place be. masks + enclosed area = virus  means don‚Äôt UV light colon right now?  Well, blaming protests entirely less ignorant claiming major contributor.

Agreed. Using half-truth absolve responsibility gets us where. won‚Äôt last long. Soon hospitals going run. You‚Äôll die home, hopefully live house someone wrap sheet haul body backyard they‚Äôre also ill. guess people live apartments get tossed windows turn congealed goo sidewalk. Yeah. require WORK. Much easier sit front tv watching Fox tweeting. fucking sad, it? live Arizona, one new 'eyes storm' every opportunity avoid watching hit driving back try warn fools right - people incapable learning others' experiences, incapable rapid behavior change response black swan event, fucking incapable foregoing eating marshmallow year live next year. evolution making massive selection know is. sign vote you? better good excuse enforcement people still go out.

They're outside likely social distancing. wear masks, really worse tens thousands protesting shoulder shoulder. That's all, masks, never was. defend said Redditt assure you, mistaken.
Have good day Hardly anything done statewide, counties depending felt. county elective surgeries stopped month beleive. work big box hardware store. Although course anything official, word across social media managers stores threatening associate test positive, telling company's social media policy post positive test. Personally think bullshit illegal, would like see held accountable it. I'm type-1 diabetic forced back workplace financial reasons. walmart target town positive cases, city hall too. there's positive case building management hides me, there's going massive problems Familiar French Revolution. History won‚Äôt let happen way went down. feels like energy sucks :/ Actually, article's headline clickbait conclusion things still go wrong Florida, perhaps relative good fortune chalked weather, perhaps county-level lockdowns made big difference, one say state hasn‚Äôt taken thoughtful approach crisis. Or, one reasonably say ‚Äî which, course, hasn‚Äôt stopped many journalists. That's eleven 9/11s Ah thanks! I've fully employed throughout know details well enough. saw cat's gut-flora passed drunk sidewalk making sense Florida mandating masks. evidence people charge idea doing. can't go anywhere except Brazil pretty much. EU banned them. It'll 50,000 today Makes sense. Kinda dick move underreport much. humble. like way good story may become politic-PR card. that. Can‚Äôt haw back yee, partner 2020 going like four chapters own. Absolutely! Show 79 year old grandmother ventilator 7 minutes flatline. Show new person every day. Show it. people get message like 7 minute video watched? bet will. I‚Äôm glad moved outta Texas year ago. live state medical doctor governor, masks required everywhere indoors months now, case rate skyrocketing like bumblefuck state‚Äôs is. They'll distribute vaccine wherever needed most. Probably nursing homes people high-risk first. US definitely get lot cases invested $1.2 billion Oxford vaccine. get sub doom gloom way alarmist normal population believe I'm careful wear mask buy groceries hand sanitizer since easy find county mean tell death rate right 0.25 percent cases state telling quivering boots go outside.? dont think so. *extely healthy except middle pandemic*. 
Fixed you. http://gestyy.com/eqTo1z Yeah there‚Äôs literally nothing would make care. Still living life desperately trying find stuff future, anything left bring happiness DeSantis: Hold beer Right, cut slice day  daily increase alone would rank 31st world total cases. üò¢ screwed statement food food packaging alone, anything else added statement would change statement modes transmission. wasn‚Äôt goal. Yes, said ‚Äúno evidence new coronavirus spreads foodstuff packaging.‚Äù means absence evidence. proof. cannot conclude. say evidence new coronavirus spreads foodstuff packaging. point, would evidence conclude food packaging safe.

Are talking CDC statement released, misinterpreted public, CDC make clarifying statements website? See: media reports appeared suggested change CDC‚Äôs view transmissibility, became clear edits confusing. Therefore, edited page provide clarity.

The primary important mode transmission COVID-19 close contact person-to-person. Based data lab studies COVID-19 know similar respiratory diseases, may possible person get COVID-19 touching surface object virus touching mouth, nose, possibly eyes, isn‚Äôt thought main way virus spreads.‚Äù

Therefore, surfaces definitely still viable means transmission, primary. tell would bad. 20% marginally better wearing mask. mean, realize people expect vaccine make safe return normal lives? told still wear masks, social distance, even participate lockdowns going ask ""why hell take then""? People expect vaccine make ""immune"". Yeah definitely wanted say. innocent people impacted stand. Maybe directly indirectly.
Friends/relatives loons get virus, pass another friend/relative may even supporter, could elderly person staying indoors avoid getting sick. unfortunately, invited infected friend inside tea. (the friend could caught via pass loons) LIBs StoPPED teStIng NEw Cases!!! US wins again! think timid he'd fired 300 times over. Loose loose situation. get it, you‚Äôre going able force people get it. Ontario seems better daily butt right. Things getting loose now. 
An coworker mine rushed work wife complaining chest pains.Hopefully false alarm. know happens positive usa divided worst possible time. would imagine that? little president point; American citizens wanted there. chose this. shaped country exactly wanted fed them. 

I‚Äôm you, want out. fucking hate Americans. Mandatory masks, it‚Äôs Reich thing do. block altogether, they'll likely insult ask nicely. Plus, there's Kansas City. Part Kansas, Missouri. sounds like we're agreement, demented rapist joe never president fucking men Making someone pay fine teaches better, though.

Jail, too! Hypocrite. want restrict people's life, yet can't even stay home? lol

And oh, boo hoo. vacation abroad ""real""? dislike Sweden much, hope emigrate can. almost like EVERYONE TOLD GOING HAPPEN, GREG. piece trash fumbled entire thing start listen solemn handwringing failures people dying. Individualism feel comfortable wearing style suits us, value things like freedom speech, achievement self-improvement, hallmark free society. America's emphasis individualism (which would argue really doesn't) problem, America's emphasis *narcissism* behind lot issues. Narcissism might seem linked individualism find much collective societies. 

Individualism fine idea everybody has, ""main character"" world revolves around them? That's bueno muchacho. Firing possibly infected employees seem highly counterproductive, puts cases street, risking cause lot spread. Would much sensible Danes followed Norwegian example regard. 

Glad see agree point yesterday though - ones visit Sweden who's fault spreading infection, seeing they're going recommendations, dangerous things whatnot.

But yeah, fact many citizens Sweden's neighboring countries go recommendations can't help laugh whenever hear countries closing border Sweden. Obviously, left cat flap open. Yeah, wife part Italian, grandad born Sardina. love Italy. Madrid favourite place, try Valencia near me, Barcelona. prefer both. Stay safe dude. understand expressed concern people non air conditioned work environments wearing masks. point outside community, need enter place like wear masks keep workers safe. 

It‚Äôs crazy disrespectful general community regards safety concerns around them. Exactly. real world real people lock work. are. Health experts everywhere sounding alarm. Everyone else keeps hitting snooze button. Insisting earth flat dumb doesn‚Äôt put risk spreading COVID-19, I‚Äôm going former I‚Äôm putting anyone strictly blame. people gathered Memorial Day , graduations, etc. want nothing end this, people can‚Äôt wear mask chose public beyond me. confused current restrictions state state.

What restrictions? winning cold war, West befallen hybris. absolutely love governors saying, ""Open bars! Open restaurants! Open amusement parks! also, you, citizen, deeply irresponsible go places."" screenshots lol. scrolled back check. This. April 

 thoughts exactly Imagine shoulder shoulder outdoor crowd everyone smoking cigarettes. people make fun ""nanny states"", supposed double literally. implies people wont lose immunity time virus slowly mutates. dont live vacation state means much easier :/ red state still looks Florida, that's suckass Florida doing. know lot people traveling vacation, far, everyone specifically looked places private beaches contact. I'm surprised bc expected us shit handling this. 1 &lt; X &lt; Y

Is math really hard you? Logic seems favor anecdotally feel like evil people never seem suffer consequences actions can't trust anybody service government. They're point judge purely according dictates personal politics.  past years looked back worst years American history. Thanks, I'll try out. 

I really need glasses 8 hours computer I've never checked solutions. guess that‚Äôs assuming y‚Äôall monogamous. I‚Äôve tested HIV it‚Äôs quick don‚Äôt know would issue. name banned too? head coronavirus response US? Woosh right violated requirement wear mask?

If exists, requirement wear pants already violating right? Reminds fake service dog cards every entitled twat years ago. Well really... thats point unfortunately.

Herd Immunity 70%, thats long time reach, growth hold exponentially forever long run flatten high level logarithmically long time slowly going down.

Even Sweden need another 7-10 years reach herd immunity wont work virus mutates big degree long run people lose immunity years, options still investigation. Yea mean think people legit think hoax something, too. people upset mask afraid slightly uncomfortable.  Parquet courts said ‚Äúcollectivism autonomy mutually exclusive‚Äù Casinos, tourists bars Good. Online learning joke Locking point requires literal act Congress states money.

Congress bankroll lockdowns House returning vacation, Senate go theirs.

These people care us. nations trying fuck every nation time, US probably #1 culpritbof activities. idea pandemic created change outcome US election one dumbest ignorant conspiracy theories come whole ordeal that's high bar cross.  except, one talks japanese pilots wore masks Pear Harbor Day...of days sneak attack, japanese pick Pearl Harbor Day....and THINK coincidence, really UNDERSTAND..?!$
on Pearl Harbor Day, celebrating fine navy base, instead watching ships get sunk... 
So, MAYBE ought consider maybe people don‚Äôt wear masks protest sneak attacks peaceful people... way don‚Äôt wear red kimono sashes heads....doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt understand science, understand ethno-hebephilia newly botched form neo-botulism...and Buddy, don‚Äôt put mask that.... difference kind people protest people tend care fellow human beings thus wear masks. People host attend social gatherings pandemic not. seriously trying quibble exact procedures state implemented re-open?

The point clearly *wasn't* protests caused spike we're seeing today.BStop trying derail conversation. Stay focused.

Obviously, whatever restrictions place either ignored (because ""muh dreedumbz), completely ineffective preventing spike cases.

Regardless, stop blaming protests unless provide data shows significant spikes cities biggest protests. tried crawling? way head height form covid particles, it‚Äôs much safer! Bruh. Let assure bad purported be.  people know illegal migrant laborers problem all. Either getting country, getting country, finding work, finding place live. I‚Äôm worried mine. think govt, google platforms aren‚Äôt holding heap data it‚Äôs kind funny Certain 'Patriots' calling start yanking masks people's faces.

Truly deplorable disgusting people. Collapsing remember Deerfield Beach years ago July w gf. Burned bottom feet sand! good news was, sort callused sort natural protection LOL WTF wrong people? words. time protests Minneapolis, case numbers still relatively low. fleeting moments exposure seem causing infection. insulated room going accumulate air time expose lot people viral load necessary cause infection. Two bars hometown Mankato, MN linked 100 cases among 20 year olds visited two establishments weekend opened. Controlling Diseases Place? Key word here: ‚Äútemporarily.‚Äù can‚Äôt even friggin‚Äô accept that. god damn embarrassing. think death like new york worse occurs around many populated areas, see support actually something. hope. You‚Äôre required wear pants shirt go outside argue that‚Äôs violation go refinery dictate can‚Äôt facial hair, wear hat approve clothes say wear, violation rights

No, stipulate rules get car put seatbelt go hospital make wear gown violating well?

No, ditto #2 Assuming social distancing masks works perfectly wishful thinking. 

There forms protest btw. sound like sad little virgin are. want protect right give flying fuck people. 

These people, who, *a large majority* right wing, conservative Christians...pro life, pro guns, pro capital punishment....all movements seem F-U way. 
Pro life: F mother. made bed, lie it. 
Atheists: don‚Äôt believe god? F you, deserve burn suffer eternity. 
Pro guns: F criminals. Anyone tries hurt family, take life. 
Pro capital punishment: break law, F you, die. 
Anti government assistance: you‚Äôre poor? F you. Deal it. 
Anti gay marriage: oh, non traditional relationship bearing life whatsoever? F you, hate I‚Äôm going stop you. 
Refugees entering country seeking safety? F you, you‚Äôre like us don‚Äôt shouldn‚Äôt here. 
Wear mask protect others spread pandemic? F you, shouldn‚Äôt inconvenience anyone. 

Kind sounds like bunch snotty 13 year olds me. Really self-centered, narrow-minded thinking. governments started trying take away Parties largely indoors summer Florida. damn hot night even. Millennials need take virus seriously trash boomer leaders open state LOL. Alabama reports day after. Friday's numbers. grim reaper coming Florida. Shit going get really horrific spreads nursing homes elderly communities. So, focus one exception find, disregard tens thousands new cases came Southern states yesterday?

You can't serious. Japan pseudo shut down. State emergency people society, finances life. People forget, maybe realize, started small numbers cases; see lot people saying things effect ""we already flattened curve, get back normal."" get people completely stop taking precautions, there's nothing stop happened happening again, we're probably seeing US now. you‚Äôre mocking God instantly zapping everyone knows going disobey him, you‚Äôd horrified lived society due process isn‚Äôt norm. 

It‚Äôs double standard  Ok. This. think peer pressure anything. Group think going kill people. Cdc says masks useless. want believe? probably best accept father **was** smart person. 

He's currently brainwashed minion lost ability think himself.

I confused current restrictions state state.

Would need self quarantine 14 days get back home California?

I need know since currently working ""essential business"" would inform upper management time off. always thought trying forge federal document crime. Well I‚Äôm sure. article collection trace contacting random collection case clusters. understand super spreaders work excess pneumonia deaths past winter addition coinciding explosion cases availability testing skeptical. also definitely false positive. Cause you‚Äôre bum. hack. Many businesses continue defy Cooper's plans slow state's reopening. Several gyms bars, though permitted reopen state's order, opening customers. Local officials communities spoken said enforcing state's mask mandate.

Utterly bizarre Eric Garner strangled death cop promoted after... selling cigarettes.

But businesses kill loads people governors like, ""Now let's rude. rights."" holy crap. point, fire person! likely we'll get 50k cases today.

Are guys ready new heights? absolutely homophobia. risk groups still donate. (Its since changed, prostitutes could donate one year gay men forever ban 5 years ago. matter married, monogamous etc. I've sex person 10 years still can't donate. work many issues, go here: Lol. people forged one two report cards growing up. Damn, accurate. due respect man someone supports masks, people agree 'duty fellow man' wear additional piece clothing.

Full stop there. Californian here. rural, specifically, Central Valley, laughing stock state. ""Individuals seem problem restaurant requiring shoes shirt...""

He's generous there. live county there's insignificant number people still issues rule. person says willing die country war willing (a) wear mask (b) stay home watch pornhub day (c) stand six feet apart one another I'm pretty sure last five minutes basic training going overseas fight. Like really think fucking people packed like sardines didnt cause increase?

Clearly, significant one, can't find spike cities actually look data.

And clearly, whatever statistically insignificant increase came protests come even remotely close increase caused Southern states reopening early.

Blaming protests current spike, almost entirely driven Southern states reopened early, ridiculous.

You seem angry. So, direct anger right people, people taking literally option given stopping cops murdering impunity streets. It‚Äôs like people complaining people unemployment getting much massive amount companies getting millions. fuck little guys fucking joke? infinitely smoking rather eating.

In legal states, even get high quality capsules, need ingest excess calories refined sugar put bizarre aftertaste. 

Doesn't make angry, give false confidence, retains enhances ability feel empathy appreciate art, enhances relaxation, makes watching tv 90 days limited options less tedious. makes cleaning less tedious. makes tedium general less tedious. read somewhere reddit (so like research paper anything) young, healthy men wind sore testicles months. publicize that, mask wearing go real quick. arguing with? pro-mask, think people say stuff like ‚ÄúIf hate masks you‚Äôll really hate ventilator‚Äù counterproductive messaging.

I think lot people it‚Äôs genuinely occurring 95% reasoning protecting others. saying would make huge difference heard good number people launch ‚Äúlet sound smart detailing (mostly correct) reasons cloth mask doesn‚Äôt crap protect me‚Äù mode.  know feels way, think tipping point American regards recent spike number infections tied somewhat protests.

Now, clear protests lead increased transmission events alone. cases traced various state re-openings. 

But lot politicians public health officials waffled whether tell people protests necessarily best idea pandemic. say person supports protests attended them. 

I felt floodgates opened people start gathering privately protests happened. say protests bad, people's messaging appropriateness pandemic led people let guard general comes activities. personally guilty myself. 

It natural humans gather, hope everyone continues stick outdoor gatherings much possible there's need gather. also quotes Tegnell said useless beginning outbreak. 

What mean ridicule people go extreme demand evidence work since telling fact work means going strategy support of. People get called alarmists, doomers even though top 10 deaths per 1/M. posts crack up.

There plenty fail go around press share beyond one incident. looks like need see huge surge deaths things change. giving altogether. IMO, anyone disagrees wearing mask follow social distancing forfeit medical care related COVID 19

If get sick it, tough shit, die home. ashamed American right now. Truly. embarrassing &amp; feel like literally nothing do. feel helpless. Yes, &amp; others continue follow guidelines, others continue refuse. illegal living nightmare. guarantee 98% would take legal option available. 

For almost legal option. There‚Äôs line get unskilled worker ties US can‚Äôt claim asylum. Tbh idiots south, lot northern states pretty well. twist tie loaf bread electronic cord, cut tiny hole one side top seam, BAM metal nose bridge. many extra steps wear mask. Preserving rights obligation fellow man.

That said I‚Äôm unclear mask issue rights - rights stem property rights anyone welcome demand wear mask property. government intervention required. anyone fault it‚Äôs business owners requiring masks property. depends strategy. going eradication, like China, lock early sweep massive testing identify isolate cases.

Other strategies seem less effective overall. Drove nuts too. Went CVS bought anti fog spray. Cost 8 bucks. Sprayed glasses , continue wear mask, dead. pulled work everyone whining away. Sprayed glasses. Everyone lived. Sorcery! right....because texas 90% ICU capacity overflow capacity reached people infected already even new infections.... think resurgences countries? are. always going happen. Everyone ounce intelligence knew beginning. stopping healthcare system overwhelmed once. never supposed completely stop virus. people going get sick, that's way works. scapegoating young people went socialized shameless shit ever.

Here's tweet saying Washoe 108 new cases:

 

That's 18 hours ago. Almost everyone.  exceptions orange guy washington, people worship him. say want facts still there. Tunisia even ranked safe spot tourists year. make argument country( usa, china etc).
By way live Tunisia don‚Äôt think know country spent 18 years in. lot people Japan wore masks Covid well.. probably good inventory social norms already. wish best, sir. Ah, gotcha. curious. We've open two months haven't. Many businesses require masks now, restaurants require masks workers every table, big events cancelled, etc. 

We've declining long time slight spikes around holidays. masculinity *is* personality would provide proof? free believe whatever want way people believed real estate brokers banks 2008. Remember that?

That's debatable. virus real economic damage caused people working. also tank super dingus. untanked. context this? u getting at? *An ICU nurse(...)described conditions Associated Press overwhelmed Phoenix-area ICU(...)she says toll sick dying patients becoming strain.

I‚Äôve never noticed saying ICU=ventilators press conferences. 

If Sweden would currently around 20 times ICU patients Denmark around 50 times (hooked ventilators). 

That seems unlikely.

So understanding exponential growth lag ‚Äúwoosh.‚Äù Almost normally wear masks time year anyway wasn‚Äôt big change lifestyle... ""tHiS LaNd fReE!"" Well we're gonna free take land population dies somehow obligations abridging rights. [This comprehensive one I‚Äôve seen. looked 300 cities determined protests didn‚Äôt lead spike coronavirus cases. People believe random stats facts get thrown them. absolutely way know  March 10, probably got Feburary. (MA, USA) Anyone PA notice numbers starting go up? happy weeks ago 300s, I'm getting little worried. feel like people diving back normalcy soon. Studies great all, South Korea already entire country showing us do. lack will. Time start imprisoning people. overwhelming majority Americans believe it‚Äôs real. like everything else it‚Äôs loud fringes assholes make place look like asylum. true. really really selfish entitled. 100 dollars ? Even China's numbers 30x US would still higher. would bet life Many Dallas do... honest, sometimes bad.

 Others.. wait drinks. Union tries ( member) live South, ""right work "" state. Union little voice. Less half (probably 30- 40%) even belong (Unions evil, know). far note, considering consulting neurologist it. yet give definitive diagnosis, had""bleeding brain"", 2 years ago (no apparent reason, high dose anti-seizure meds (one side effects susceptible respiratory infection). think said lost Alamo? I'll take evidence back claims somehow selfish people bars get covid righteous protesters can't spread.


Somehow think statement needs proof people take word it. Thank fabric suggestions. sew I‚Äôll see come with. Also Spanish Flu kills young people people returning war young, lethal them. second wave gonna less severe Corona Spanish Flu.  It‚Äôs mostly immigrant farm laborers. Yes, nearly everyone is.

Do understand lib states talking cutting health care coverage right now?

Do understand blue led House approved almost month long vacation month June.

And red controlled Sen go vacation July 

Those waivers guaranteeing free treatment expire political faves shrugging. vote leopard eating faces party, maybe surprised leopard eats _your_ face.

I call schadenfreude. Im loving steps NY taking fast. protect states, want enforce 14 day quarantine harder get source sharing purposes? TIA Good - best luck! fuck time move on. debate masks save lives. What‚Äôs lowest death rate estimate? It‚Äôs 0.2% mean current deaths(over 125,000) means 50 million people infected, far. 

Stop idiot. yea ""studies"" lol Restaurants bars never ever going safe get virus gone.

It's bummer they're following rules even gonna spread.  implication real men like X things, that's pushed socially said OK ""Real women"" sexist thing obvious reasons. 

I also see anyone actually going mask ""Real men"" thing, especially decades men ridiculous social standards tough face literal public brigading accusation parts make ""Real men"" sexist thing, men rape abusers, women. 

It's pushing sexist wedge means nothing negatively impacts countless lives, one thing much underreported male rape due sheer, raw amount apathy towards it. It‚Äôs going tight squeeze since earth flat new. speech. somebody posts wish speech banned, somebody else post able say whatever want rights important others fee-fees. ""Work self-isolation"".....I dont think so! Thank explaining.
I saw direct replies comment, looking comments OP. Canada also seen number unsafe working condition charges thrown courts ""if province opens up, safe"". 

We people working home asking continue working home less risk them, less risk anyone needs go office denied someone top rush get everything open. 

Ontario Quebec even come close managing first wave -- steady declines decided open up, starting see growth. squash everything safe population; showed could control said fuck politicians could get bump ratings leading us crisis. Yes. generation lived WWI WWII (not mention Spanish Flu) would ashamed children's behavior. Saying protests anything Corona spiking social political suicide. really think piece paper says part mining company worth anything dollar collapses? Oh, I'm sorry. country mind asking?

Please stay safe. feels like unpreparedness feign surprise going preface new grim milestone. Yep. Also, good developers want move US, make lot money. 

At least, true Trump. bullshit immigration policies finally accomplish something countries tried failed fix decades: stop brain drain US. it‚Äôs like flu say Even you‚Äôre perfectly healthy, people around not. thing spreads fast it‚Äôs controlled, hospitals buckle strain you‚Äôll also people dying can‚Äôt get care anything else. 

Rogan focusing ‚Äúpeople boosting immune system‚Äù missing point we‚Äôre worried about. elderly, complications. Maybe choose fat, can‚Äôt choose old. Nice! state totally OWNING. testing, states re-opening, mass protests streets Fatality absolute worst thing virus, but, walk park die either. Studies showing younger patients diagnosed chronic fatigue syndrome life, damage lungs, hospital bills piling up, secondary infections, even lung transplants cases. death rate trending mean ignore surge cases. Yes, younger people less vulnerable. young people families, friends, patrons, doctors, etc, older age. That's kicker virus. Oh young asymptomatic, waiter young. even is, also family, etc. It‚Äôs ‚Äúwhat people think‚Äù matters... it‚Äôs science proves numbers reveal matters. Outdoor activities simply spreader, pictures I‚Äôve seen majority people protests wearing masks anyway. People bars getting drunk hanging talking loud puts spit air singing DJ (spit again) lose inhibition. People restaurants aren‚Äôt wearing masks can‚Äôt eat mask sharing AC many others eating forks plates touched countless people. comparing apples oranges. serious?

Try getting elementary school kids pay attention screen day. Try showing write. Try pointing letters they're trying learn read. Try actual full time job helping kids attend ""distance learning"" 

You must live alternate universe none things issue. ""So send message people protests don‚Äôt cause spread bar dangerous"" 

You send message truth. Every individual analysis shown correlation rise cases protests/size protest. Whereas one bar Michigan alone lead 70+ cases. difference outdoor transmission 10x harder indoor transmission. Simple physics. know every city major gatherings protests number cases risen fairly dramatically.

What know this, particular, true Yep. local one Friday lunch buffet, normal life. I‚Äôve turkey. bad worth immune covid states Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah Texas. California several states also expected added state. East Lansing. Know family. dont give shit anyone except themselves. Yeah stupidity seeing amazing. would think people somehow plain unintelligent. 

If virus affected people like would one thing. wish mess anyone ""you reap sow"" comes mind case. doesn't, willfully ignorant people spread innocent people. 

Proper mask wearing commercials make even obvious wear masks billboards showing well. UK still compulsory worst country Europe COVID19 cases Nevermind Owen Hart died ring Vince let PPV keep rolling along like nothing happened. 

Garbage human being. Watch first minute linked I'm not, reading message, maybe sign subconscious trying tell something! wonder could be..._shrugs_ Lock doors. let people wearing mask.

Eventually, they'll get it. Idk anxiety. Don‚Äôt symptoms planning getting tested Monday I‚Äôve out. Best-case-scenario tell grandkids got test Armour force Black Lives Matter Plaza tear-gassed innocent protesters. also unmarked Armour soldiers guarding Lincoln Monument. mean that's bit dramatic title, DeSantis ordered certain bars shut, correct? mean shit still going hit fan... happens promote ""identity politics"" everywhere transform society battleground various groups opressors opressed, get tribalism group believes holds ""truth"" thinks absolutely right, easy groups justify generally ""immoral"" acts this.

 encourage INDIVIDUALS think act way brings generally less suffering world, encourage stick group conduct starting supposition.

This ultimately migrated politics science alone describes world cannot make value judgements actually conduct world us. Science tell us ultimately right allow people still go work provide families secure futures people die close everything shut economies human suffering brings well, UN report warning ""famine biblical proportions"". 

That's people turned answers elsewhere, shows modern societies deep crisis identity manifests corruption fundemantal presumptions respective civilisation, exactly Nietzsche predicted late 1800s. long people find salvation group think, downhill end tragedies plagued 20th century, also predicted Nietzsche.

I wish 'good cause' like homelessness, pandemic. believe countries tests per capita per day US. hard get data like share, it'd really good able compare. Approaching 5000 new deaths day new cases breaking 200k day next week, deaths sure increase months, developing world vastly underreported.

Tragically take 3 4 months official deaths pass 1m, reality probably already close. competition TNA TNA managed ran poorly WWE somehow. Now, WWE competition AEW, like said, also couple promotions think. happens don‚Äôt serve Remember days US used see 20,000-30,000 cases there's like 40,000+ day. Like WTF happened get even worse care rich ass hole says COVID worst virus could pick 96 cut date Contact tracing? like January thing would worked people followed rules. fuckin shits bag.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* mask usage Japan insane. transited Osaka late January everyone airport wearing mask except foreigners. Apparently lung nerve damages possible asymptomatic people.

Taking facts COVID ground glass lung shows CAT scans asymptomatic people, massive disparity death toll observed excess mortality together strongly suggestive portion asymptomatic people dropping dead coronavirus-induced heart attacks strokes... also think adjusted outside people wearing masks exposure due protests drop bucket compared indoor parties, family gatherings, people hanging bars. So, big, total spike COVID cases city Minneapolis shows protestors got spread far wide throughout city?

If theory true, would impossible Minneapolis huge spike comparable cities southern states opened early. conspiracy guy then? usually recommend fantasy novels want satisfy desire nonsense hoping reports this, people realizing much toll takes expecting get back running 5k every morning week COVID19. 

Otherwise...

Yeah, want think that. made say that? statement also explains wealth gap ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è yet people blame everything themselves. going hospital scared virus, hospitals admitting get CoVID19 bonuses./S brother got COVID. isolation another week returning work. worry works heat. know heat sensitivity common occurrence recovered?

Appropriate acronym. anyone actually believe this? virus care political convictions...

You really know that? Lol 0.30% NYC died it. antibody tests showing 20% NYC caught it. sure CDC (the CDC said masks useless) thinks 100% NYC it. That's China isolation quarantine, prevent infection family members. much common one person infect rest household. Sure thing pal. downvotes prove correct.

They think right gun trumps right safety. season meat.

We season EVERYTHING state. Sometimes forget people world think mayo spicy think 1 pinch salt enough seasoning. I‚Äôm hoping happens. think he‚Äôs still waiting hear final word not. Karen wants talk whoever's charge shit always pisses off. Husband WFH secure jobs, well aware lucky. Sure, may also good financial literacy skills even still job allows us make expenses extremely beneficial staying afloat.

I‚Äôm robust comprehensive UBI people paid taxes deserve it. Cull large companies received bail proceeded fire people. point ready give trying good...seriously...nobody working win thing. get it.

I guess need hit million deaths call pandemic. NY brutal fucking failure. COVID response, y'know, everything. beauty haphazard country culture promotes retardation. spikes country. It‚Äôs almost guaranteed protests apart this. Like said, protesters probably asymptomatic easily spread people didn‚Äôt protest. Candidate running campaign promotes cheap healthcare funding education, wants make background checks extensive *and try push AWB, magazine capacity bans, ban cosmetic features like last time stronger background checks proposed. 

Fixed first one you. Personally I'd vote candidate B. Schools locally funded, school district fine, I'd happier taxes higher already retaining much rights possible. work forest preserve district thousand acres many miles trails. It‚Äôs awesome crazy busy last months. fucking fine shit  lied wearing masking start. Told everyone didn‚Äôt need them. look. Fucking cunts! Yeah watched live streams week straight many people wearing masks either wearing chin straps pulling spoke people could hear better America breaking records I'm pretty sure protests also contributing numbers. Let's pretend haven't.

Not nearly degrees bars/restaurants people's generally apathetic unempathetic behavior towards pandemic. No, interstate travel Constitutional right. probably weren‚Äôt stupid Someone like allowed get test bypass sides points worth considering. one valid path forward laid out. Period. Full stop. feel lost media frenzy sorting fact versus fiction know. 

As healthy young adult, I‚Äôm watching lot friends gallivant around seemingly carefree. I‚Äôm still wearing mask public, social distancing, trying smart, while, there‚Äôs whole group friends screaming everyone wearing masks saying stay home forever. 

Is anyone really right? virus bad thought March? 

I‚Äôm also seriously concerned never come back job, (currently furlough), know opinion bit skewed. Good thing rioters spread around. rioters good people, restaurant people bad. Insurance companies need treat people refuse wear mask way treat people intentionally set houses fire.

No medical coverage purposely got sick middle pandemic. Thank you! It‚Äôs industry give give get beat down. money great, sanity much valuable!

I hope time graduate country get back track covid won‚Äôt big thing. know this? Legitimate question. reopening process guided data science. cases rising throughout CA. We‚Äôre seeing rise cases SF too. numbers still low rising result, we‚Äôre temporarily delaying re-openings scheduled right eradicate thing now, instead it'll mutate, become perpetual problem, kill millions, maybe billions would assume that? hope true. lasting effects minimal. line really give confidence. 

""However, ""fewer infections requiring hospitalization"" resulting death, said, without citing figures."" Good. Masks political. might find /r/coronavirusga interesting. raised because... Oddly enough people refuse wear shoes stores argue illegal. They're called Society Barefoot Living Nope! Wrong state. They're singing Yellow Rose Texas banging sister praying President. many hundreds thousands may chronic health conditions rest lives now. Stimulus checks arent meant cover unemployment. Unemployment money is. Apply it. video also link.  always like this. Stand Ground laws used called True Man laws, American invention. really concerned people country either. thought article title odd. #realmenwearmasks shaming. people pre-existing conditions don‚Äôt know yet haven‚Äôt bothered say, ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm annoying thing you‚Äôll deal rest life.‚Äù

Friend mine going get physical get tested see diabetes. Spoiler alert: suddenly died appointment.

Also, suspected covid trigger diabetes.  Makes sense. Many people Japan already wear masks public. Wouldn‚Äôt take much convince them. read whole thread? 1. Fuck them.

2. alleviate burdens well (mortgage forgiveness involved min). Fair point, point really trying make still stands. figure head 4th July weekend first 2000+ day. Two weeks later, might hit 3000. 

Mask mandates rolling larger cities, know, can‚Äôt catch COVID-19 you‚Äôre tourist different zip code. üôÑ live die tourism ‚Äî literally.  fed could give us paycheck like wallstreet.

Now gonna massive austerity next months... true! customers daily (in Florida) cry it‚Äôs rights conversation complain government didn‚Äôt tell quick enough wear them... WTF! country never get everyone dead, remove politics situation realize social responsibility humanitarian issue... nothing more! #spreadlovenotthevirus Yeah, good point. tend think elective surgeries outpatient sorts things, realize much extensive I've admitted wrong before, happily I'm wrong here. lose moral high ground demand apologies hurl around insults people hoping apocalypse. takes time fat. mask takes seconds put on. realize US still three spots behind Italy deaths per capita right? 570 deaths per million compared 380 deaths per million... We're either fudging numbers somehow lucky far, people longer giving fuck. I'm seeing less less masks every day. think people who've lost limbs severe organ failure they're transplant list going magically regrow body parts? anyone trust CDC anymore? live Florida know doctor supposed goto New York coronavirus training, deal 14 day quarantine, can‚Äôt go get said education can‚Äôt afford lose local VA long gathering potential risk. Like flu, covid really care gathering. hover crowd deep dive infect deserving.

We need information based slanted-for-me opinions. need real information based best conclusions available. need remain aware one - ONE - operating cemented real facts considered conclusions.

Could conclsions based upon lies?

For example, riot affected cities, anyone looked number outsiders participated, went there, two weeks later. many spread virus traveling?

How many would step forward declare viral status been? 

Covid virus existence long enough establish many firm facts - plus virus may evolving changing ""facts"" go. even virus could lying us.

Chill, people. Everyone seems hell bent blaming someone else. Let's work together. 

If rioting convince virus go somewhere saner, streets rioting, burning, killing. hurting people? 

Insanity reigns. Go post history. Nothing asking handouts money lending sub. dude entitled. Taiwan setting people coming back country hotel room quarantine? Wellness checks right got plane? Personal taxi quarantine hotel? even people little bag sanitizer couple disposable face masks video watched. actually following tracing. protests. still based 10% positivity cutoff? That's good principle states easily manipulate data remain it. what‚Äôs wrong tattoos? Right, point total deaths. great report 80k whatever. Maybe YouTube guys right two million, knows, what's denominator? many coming? How's long lock usa India travel? opens tons infection again, whether admit That‚Äôs way looking things also misguided, look people affected pandemics past see we‚Äôve learned past use knowledge fight one.

Pandemics things you‚Äôve mentioned. Schools hospitals shut merely aren‚Äôt enough people man them. give example *this* pandemic. live London one best public transport networks world. It‚Äôs reduce services, mandated government people getting sick weren‚Äôt enough staff. Pandemics past brought place massive societal changes amount people died ill. claim spanish flu brought end WWI people sick fight. long range view (of like 100s years) might seem like good things, ground, living it, it‚Äôs awful.

These measures place take away civil liberties protect you. thing taking away civil liberties messages convince put others harms way. else make do? cases town low I‚Äôm probably sending I‚Äôm probably sending masks lots hand wipes. cases start rise home school time.

Schools going total shit show anyway - constantly closing opening. mean can‚Äôt even send kid school peanut butter due possible health impact another child. heck kids going school sniffles. many sick children school it‚Äôs one buildings dedicated nurse. don‚Äôt need day care feel people do. School toughest decision have. originally thought cases would ramp summer could delay second wave. never could imagined we‚Äôd facing another surge soon. reason to. bother me. Good point. takeout delivery .. moment.

That stops open fully. Gotta go clean oven now. Fu@k! sit trying eat half naked girls keep stopping sitting lap. How‚Äôs Canada shit? seem awfully quiet, wanna dip go likely sick depends got to, went grocery store it‚Äôs definitely possible particularly likely, went packed nightclub much here...jerks everywhere..the sign says mask got picnic table 20 about... trained teach, love students, house payment, eat...What would recommend, welfare? independently wealthy. ass? forgot stomp feet point I‚Äôm dad. mean... really left house besides what's necessary since beginning year. know much seriously take it. denial, obesity, lack medical care south trouble. virus obviously ignores you‚Äôre protest. It‚Äôs crafty! amazing human being. came anonymous GM 

AND QUOTE several responses articles linked comments above. places spikes places protests are. spikes happening outdoor events almost everyone mask on; happening states lifted restitutions soon without following CDC guidelines, many clusters clearly traced back places like bars parties people congregated moderate-large numbers, indoors, AC. infection rate low, outbreak cause Rt spike. happened Germany weeks ago isolated outbreak plants. teacher I‚Äôm tired told things like masks social distancing don‚Äôt matter much schools, it‚Äôs big deal won‚Äôt safety precautions go back August. school place things like social distancing magically don‚Äôt matter? 

I feel like we‚Äôve done magical thinking throughout whole mess. Actually making schools truly safe return much difficult expensive. going say safety precautions don‚Äôt matter much schools, half assed security theatre, hope ignore virus magically leave schools alone keep economy going.

If ignore virus goes away! really does!!!! Really? They‚Äôd average probably 400 deaths day rest summer NYC stays low.


400 number aren‚Äôt even close daily. They'll distracted classroom zoom. Next. South Africa. We've international news presence far things going ridiculous. absolutely fucking mindblowing me. let say, context, I'm liberal fuck. obvious anyone working eyes spike least partly due protests.

Like we're straight-up ignoring we're seeing huge spikes youth infection cities even reopened, fit narrative virtuous makes immune. Science racist now. Un-fucking-believable. That's point. point plenty dumbass americans go ""haha US bad"" they're americans too, they're also stupid. care people agree, care think they're special ones suffering issues think comments like mine validating they're direct target. point studies suggesting covid transmitted via aerosols? Would love read 100% agree evidence protests sites super spreader events unless access data public health leaders don't. believe De Santis banned sale alcohol bars. I'm sure bring own. probably came request cura√ßao government. Mask wearing gendered problem. make one. inclusive problem. RealWomenWearMasks.

It stupid make gendered, trivially obvious toxic negative label fucking slapped men. old misandrist shitshole radfems feminists care. one decent human left movement.

I guess par course bullshit ""avoid men, practice women"" crap used genders abbreviations, usual toxic dogwhistles normalize hating men.

There. Is. No. Acceptable. Version. Of. Gendered. Hate. 

None. Every day past week, Florida breaking record. get it. happens property owners default mortgages? long apartment complexes sustain zero income? agree everything. Everything wrote first comment (above edit). 
BUT: Someone asked open. Someone else explained people need income live. someone else said easy problem solve. another person basically said ""ok, explain would solve it, easy"". expounded rant (which agree with) addressed none preceding discussion. That's \*winces\* 

I meningitis several years ago. never forget headache, headache couple days. threatened murder people tried take away rights. 

And stand that. would someone took away right free speech? Don‚Äôt worry least 22 states numbers rising soon get states record numbers cases. That's issue, reject science evidence. Bible, would another story... matter time, ability stomp clusters put test. matter many downvotes get, change fact. happy, pandemic real, dumbasses like die IT! ""I can't possibly see that's relevant."" - Government gonna like least September Around chin nose seems work ü§£ subreddit fucking joke. telling bars reduced capacities people talk one another maintaining distance likely spread coronavirus thousands people yelling one another crowded together. So... listing reasons wrong now? Kinda weird making arguments us now. argument equivalent ‚ÄúI think motorcycles incredibly dangerous therefore nobody able operate public roads.‚Äù  Sweet, gonna go ahead send first one time? mean maybe long term implications, yeah people acting way political reasons. Again, know. catchy headline people, instead, polarize issue choose line sand minimal evidence loaded hatred opposition rather search truth. made contact since possibly got infected? yh I'd quarantine till results come back jus safe. long gets test back anyway So, still think I'm wrong?

You always set another reminder. Could share, permanent issues cause you? make easier, Worldometer shows 37 deaths Florida yesterday 26 today. record, think take 3-4 weeks deaths really spike since age skewing younger, that's ill-informed speculation. society predicated lying population possibly SACRIFICING LIVES preserve itself, moral society. 

Trump made decision kill pandemic team sell masks stockpile late Dec 2019.

You tell die mistake? society burn  Sadly, universe give rat's ass do. Mr. Universe left building. High quality information? true never killed anyone Texas Medical Center also stopped reporting daily statistics reaching 100% base ICU capacity: last update [June 

Hospitals beginning see effects rising cases. 2018 return address file, put direct deposit info site. I‚Äôm worried sent old address never get it. want point Robert Stevens say considers ""significant"" percentage. 5%? 80? 

Without specifying percentage is, really making point. 

Not trying say concerning, informative useful. way look US‚Äôs response chickens coming roost. way government operating demonstrable failure, option change country works. Lol yeah

They're welcome downvote virus since government sucks. Big Way kill voting base. Wisconsin northern state lot people eating outside socializing outside. rates much lower scorching hot states. fall comes go everyone heads inside. Bro, even see? know thinking Texas 5 days straight nearly 6000 cases bad saw Florida 2 days straight 9000 cases. Jesus Florida happened. Oh god no. functioning brain. never would never put situation.

My suggestion keep safe suggestion go awful sounding place. Ever. That's fair, either way we're even second quarter I'm afraid underestimate conservative mind. honestly honestly do. catching non-mask wearers. getting comply stay spend/lose money leave another casino that's tricky part. easy thing. Like wtf, we're probably heading second lockdown God knows much longer shit. would done original lockdown worn masks lifted it, would now.  people America won‚Äôt even listen government, that‚Äôs government *is* telling stay home. Helpful optimism towards US allowed sub. play contrarian (i‚Äôm still formulating views)

üßê

Granted don‚Äôt think anyone wanted virus spread exponentially uncontrollably, anyone expect new infections increase lockdowns lifted? highly contagious virus. 

To extent they‚Äôve limited younger, healthier people far lower mortality rates shorter hospital stays, isn‚Äôt hoping for? seems though vulnerable taking heightened precautions. Younger people *materially* less vulnerable (I‚Äòm keenly aware numbers won‚Äôt moved anecdotal story two) virus, deaths remain mostly constant another week two, shouldn‚Äôt dial back panic?

no oh that‚Äôs, people wear masks socially distance better been. note stories new cases beginning look lonely without follow ups overrun hospitals higher deaths.

ok ducking cover Indy 500 planning 100k August! think probably right money.

It's industry explanation consistent understanding. dont give shits people calling covid hoax. care innocent people infect might choice public. cash cow HVAC. Every system planet needs re-engineered reconfigured, huge expense massive shortage people skills it. great day skilled labour, also unlimited overtime. think best way judge would deaths per capita. gets rid population differences, shows really matters. so? 
Around 60 million currently unemployed, cases eclipsing 4 months ago. 
Please explain? efforts toward clinging world know instead adapting new way approaching things deal thing long term. absolutely right. country paying dearly mindset right now. We're opening faster almost anyone else world we've top 2 highest daily increase per capita world past 3 days row. Unfortunately government going learn clinging old normal catastrophic results. rate we're going possibly next Brazil story. right safe,i dont care people think.I rather safe sorry.  Booyah! that's reopen. return flight tomorrow well. Fingers crossed flight isn‚Äôt full again. Fortunately think aisle end seat, least I‚Äôll 1 person directly next me. Safe travels friend but, articles said evidence. early guess article implies protests less impactful likelihood root cause new surge cases. one brave stand publicly protests. It‚Äôs issue math. don‚Äôt even get statement. math necessary? Yeah see picture protest people crammed together wearing masks, direct disregard medical guidance dismissed non-fact based, conspiracy. joke. People like irresponsible. can‚Äôt believe covering junk isn‚Äôt part ‚Äúno shirt, shoes, service‚Äù Motto. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è world's richest man like 20+ years. think he's got good security. Fair enough. It‚Äôs frustrating see basically every country get top US shattering records everyday. take little bit comfort knowing I‚Äôm south, seems main culprit, still. That's NYC dumb dumb.. feel way fellow human beings stuck countries shitty governments like, say, Iranians Venezuelans? Americans self centered selfish stay home wear masks public. nation ""ME first"" mentality cannot stand personal comfort convenience impeded greater good others around them. hope younger generations learn history repeat itself. Schools massive long term consequences. Malls gyms dont. guess im surprised bad outbreak right now. mean US states worst hit like New York New Jersey seem still ok. Yet overall US still seeing record number new cases. Perfect example. Here's trumper knows trump racist pos. need mask for!?!?!?! virus gets near basement full ammo guns till next Tuesday. virus know messing with. No, work self-assessment - work Leaflock assessment. Unless ever taught 8 year olds, right say this. Unless ever supply kleenex, hand sanitizer, clorox wipes, paper towels, band aids, etc (under ordinary circumstances, pandemic) shut hell up. cleaned blood, piss, shit, vomit, sometimes day. Spend day elementary classroom (try 29 years), preach me. wear masks exercise/est healthy reduce heart disease?

I don‚Äôt get you‚Äôre comparing two. bulk progress U.S. carried minority people drag rest people kicking screaming.

Reminds bit Jim Jefferies. comes 4th July. really, really think right way behave pandemic, honestly? see difference response, China outbreak 50 Beijing, go absolutely nuts tracking every case contact, aren‚Äôt  45 states not. power headline Restaurants things legally someone literally watching. something discussed enough. rabies virus cause people significant fear water transmits saliva (which washed away drinking water). study 2010 people contagious common flu, yet symptoms, likely want go groups people. Viruses affect us neurologically, I'm surprised there's research subject. aside - suppose one wants especially pedantic meaning 'symptom', asymptomatic still accurate medical jargon 'symptoms' refer something patient feel/notice (compared 'signs', something noticed doctor/examiner).

That said, time people say 'symptom' mean much general sense, easy conflate 'asymptomatic' 'carrier' 'not affected negatively virus'. ain't over, % China antibodies right now? I'm sure know hunger) number pretty damn high think declare best worst guess Joe Rogan wrong TX Next years- Maybe, vaccine takes, say, 3 years rolled out, we‚Äôll get better dealing virus is.

Forever- No. pandemic ever played way. reason virus seems exotic don‚Äôt enough data pin exactly does, won‚Äôt seem weird anymore. 125,000 Covid-19 patients died nationwide - country.

Still people don‚Äôt get it. Via rectally inserted UV lamp? know what's hard advising protests (for obvious reasons) giving guidelines protest safely.

It's like sex ed be. sex *could* result pregnancy, safest option avoid pregnancy sex. However, given people *will* sex, safest ways handle it. ~~Yes know oral/anal/gay sex result pregnancy, analogy, actual topic discussion.~~ Hmm, curve looks familiar, [have seen flight 100% full, thanks United. I'm going back tomorrow fingers crossed it'll better. feel like wearing mask least get things back normal. many people need die? unprecedented horrible virus killed half million people, 25% states far. US getting highest numbers ever terrible response. Individual rights argued right time request simple wear mask not. Wake people, many countries proven wear mask, wash hands, sanitize, social distance beat least lower numbers lowest possible genius comes cure. Wtf, know this?! Poorly run chain restaurants yes. Bars able get half capacity problem. Obsession freedom. Americans hate told culture based upon idea family comes first.  know going high schools student 5-6 hour long classes 20-30 students each. really would need test twice week. see indication anyone talking that. Instead they're waving hands hoping it'll work out. even working offices, vulnerable immigrant farming communities forced take material risk health. People need really pay attention distinction workers compensation claims. consideration much social medical system Canada burdened increased risk employer taking. Even important US employees either insured huge deductibles, meaning even survive hospital stay, financially ruined. pretty crazy see gym Texas. open month now. First days maybe 30-50% people wearing masks. week 2 become alone almost every day even occasionally getting goofy stares 2 days ago. suddenly 75% wearing again. understand people. could mostly live normal lives they'd fucking wear them.  leader saying get back there, government anything. decided lead leave states. knew get go south gonna screwed. south poor health overall, bad numbers yet come, deaths. know, right! really care. Seems like fair compromise return me. I‚Äôm going comment protests rate spread there, restaurants bars *excellent* way spread covid. People use silverware drink glasses dishes cleared server, goes run drinks bar. know places trying designated people serve others clear, restaurants disgusting able keep transmission happening impossible.

I'm wondering what's going happen retirement communities Florida people start catching it. would think bode well keeping numbers hospitalized down. NY shut around 3,500 new cases per day, IIRC.

Meanwhile Florida showing 9000 new cases daily absolutely intention lock down... sounds like Meniere's disease. I'm covid19 recovery subreddit lot heard anyone talk prolonged vertigo. Haha it‚Äôs not! still know something‚Äôs Minty, spicy etc point wonder can‚Äôt politicized?

Also, medical system privatized here. Doctors spread thin ER move next patient.

If live somewhere like happening, did.

I make masks

* material lab tested almost N95
* design lab tested pass respirator fit test

Then made supermasks extra layer material that's probably N99 filtration.

And bought safety goggles protect eyes. (Not sure could wear office. could wear wraparounds.)

So eyes, nose mouth protected. three routes entry. take cue Asian neighbors. One woman wears mask even jogs. others wear even take trash out. (It‚Äôs apartment complex). I‚Äôm same. True sweden pretty even though ive 2 Cities arrest them. Work courts. calling extrajudicial killings. Doctors decide lives dies opinions. save treat prioritize save many possible. Hand fines, throw jail saying killed absolutely insane. Never estimate power stupid people large numbers

- t-shirt saw once. believe CDC explicitly stated many people would die, think estimate based current actions taking. also obviously many competing models, different models use different assumptions. 

The problem here, gleaned experts saying, guessing way much. Without extensive testing antibodies positive cases, unable work accurate number regards deadly thing is. Further, thing could kill family mine, prudent thing cautious? real man, overgrown manbaby still wear mask know excuses  Made China [lmao vote manipulation april back force subreddit 30K cases last 4 days.

Because people dying them.

People willing kill countrymen bare minimum deserve die death fellows did. Real men wear masks one government knows Fauci said black brown people cooperating understands want talk government. I'm talking. feel free prove wrong. Damn could buy oximeter ~15$ so. 4 times less likely die: yes, partly new patient younger proven effectiveness cheap steroids. 
But sequels still there: lungs wounded, kidney failures, blood clots resulting strokes, embolisms, necrosises cases amputations, loss eyesight etc etc starts compare Brazil's situation, would lot less embarrassing. depends referential. Thanks, sure compares NY. Scary! going last longer still. something I'm excited either, might well face reality. tight restriction. country 10 millions would limit 800 cases 14 days.

It makes sense, really. Yelling increases velocity particles exit mouth, forcefully penetrate protective membrane mask. 

But hey, wearing mask, right? whatever want it. Old people reason live also concern. People need realize even die virus, get **severely** ill.

Just take look people saying /r/COVID19positive. Yup. mutual friend married doctor several doctor friends. invited us party last month another one 4th July. 

Blows mind. Told sorry won‚Äôt coming. comfortable yet. Really seems like nightclubs bars closed everywhere virus isn‚Äôt totally eradicated (places like New Zealand). get people want fun, you‚Äôre indoors, can‚Äôt social distance, can‚Äôt wear mask want drink something. People might even thinking virus they‚Äôre shitfaced. least, make bars outdoors only.

As side note, know someone going bar thinks safe bring glass. Yep, pay bills never open mail either ""Those churches going PACKED!' Pro life anti mask. positive negative always equals negative. 

We done lock down, done full Sweden.

""Unfortunately, arrived untested placed within San Quentin really kind seeded outbreak second state facility,"" says Dr. Matt Willis, public health director Marin County, San Quentin located. ""In rush trying address epidemic Chino, [testing] step may overlooked.""

It's clear why, deadly pandemic, inmates tested. Prison officials said working health departments.

Dr. Willis says he's alarmed prison's rapid increase cases potential impact area hospitals.

""I'm concerned see hundreds cases,"" said. ""Even small fraction people become sick need hospitalized, stress regional hospital system.""

Sounds like good reason get coffee. Republicanism kills Asymptomatic cases counted Kazakhstan's official daily total. 569 symptomatic cases reported today, compared 988 asymptomatic cases found.

Kazakhstan mass testing since start outbreak March, 45-50K tests done daily country 18 million people. ""Embarrassing"" might nicest thing say regards this. could see lot people using full 6 month visitor visa come hide/live things blow over. Especially anyone shifted work home, reason people can't work remotely here.

But reason hope border stays closed while, really need bunch people flooding get much worse Florida.

Assuming yesterday's study 5% confirmed cases needing hospitalization correct, florida added ~925 people needing hospital care last 2 days alone. sustainable trend Restaurants, gyms, beaches, theme parks...all remain fully open Florida. Disney World opening weeks. Nothing done actually make difference limiting spread. 

July 4th celebrations cause another explosion cases. Contact tracing makes sense limited number contacts trace. epidemic full swing, enough resources trace contacts. That's we're lockdowns ask everyone wear masks instead. assumes everyone infected.

I'm testing. I'm thinking testing miraculously stop virus. People collectively stopped giving shit here. economy much important seems.

Went shopping groceries today. felt pre-corona times. That‚Äôs did! Got amazon reads like ""who phone?"" spookypasta adapted joke. pop banner saying database maintenance yesterday later today (afternoon point).

Again, single one sources supports claim. 

Again, taking things context using gotcha question solicits improbable scenario suggest UN‚Äôs prediction flat dishonest.

You ashamed suggesting UN wants close quarantine. urged anyone restart economy. 

Stop spreading misinformation. Patient surges could soon demand distressing triage decisions U.S. intensive care units (ICUs), too. 

**ICU triage**

Should ICUs become overwhelmed COVID-19 despite surge strategies, [critical care prioritises patients intensive care rations scarce resources required. applies patients without COVID-19, groups competing ICU resources. Critical care triage ethically complex emotionally draining. ideally coordinated regional national health-care systems level, countries provided guidelines COVID-19. triage policy implemented clinicians trained triage senior ICU practitioners, complemented clinical decision support systems, might identify patients low probability survival unlikely benefit ICU care. Yep, poster clearly P E N C E. 370 million Americans. .004 number = 148,000 dead Americans. 

Right CDC says number US COVID-19 deaths 150,000 July 18, 3 weeks today.

After that, percentage Americans dying COVID-19 continue rise, since many Americans concerned ""I've got mine, fuck you"" ""Do unto others would unto you.""

The mask worn diminish opportunity infection infect others (and no, asymptomatic, mean spreading germs anyway).

The lockdowns diminish opportunity infection infect others--and *theirs* infect *you.*

During Influenza epidemic 1918, people figured wearing masks social distancing way slow stop deadly Spanish Flu.

Please reat article commenting: congestion outdoor dining, frequently discussed spring, region legal tools stop crowding parks beaches. ban crowds 50 people apply parks.

Your anecdata contradicts enormous amount photos I've seen anti *and* pro Swedish strategy groups. complain widespread NPI fatigue, Tegnell recently re: younger people. long article say hillbillies want wear masks [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/E6QzZ) That's wrote difference headline text.

You definitely got tougher generation grow in. Shambolic technical term this. say ok ignore safety standards? said measures proportional risk. city 30,000 empty hospital 0 cases, fewer restrictions big city thousands cases hundreds deaths.

No despise Trump, good job generalizing. Getting harder corporate consolidation happened airline industry. conventional epidemiology best practices, pool testing useful population monitoring, important enough clinical testing capacity. 

So ramp testing capacity enough clinical testing start pool testing. 

I'm worried administration talking pool testing like replace normal clinical testing...that's works. might well happen. hospitalization rates amongst vast majority population low. Keep spreading garbage misinformation. hope get Covid. Trump seen manly.

it's amazing bunker boy even comes even slightly associated 'manliness' can't even handle walking fucking ramp definitely think it‚Äôs better safe sorry, also understand small family get together. guarantee things much better year two now. can't believe people care grandparents enough wear mask public. like nation said 'fuck grandma, cuz gonna die anyway needa breath people Walmart'. ya ur def hoping bailout Ahhh makes sense. Thank you. must admit dissapointed Judge Brannick lifted stay home order Governor decided go phase 1. dissapointed order larger evacuation TPC refinery exploded dumping huge black clouds chemicals air. must admit shocked found spine mask order. even shocked bothered write letter.

The thing people understand Jefferson County 86 ICU beds. surge capacity 104. beds already full. Surrounding counties like orange Hardin county 0 beds. surrounding counties also depend Jefferson county. Yesterday third day 100 positive tests Jefferson County alone. 

The sad part area probably needs full lockdown. simply can't handle large surges. Good riddance Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Think back things starting get bad. Many felt initial response far slow indecisive. People said borders closed earlier, flights grounded earlier, etc.

I've reading posts week making clear things escalating quickly again. last day starting see states reacting, even many would say little late.

Have learned nothing? Texans could go back redo everything, maybe we'd elect someone else. Thanks üòä appreciate empathy. It‚Äôs pleasant see friendly! Wildings refuse bend knee. biggest prison population, too. per capita overall? think both. need navy hospital ships! handle ourselves.


-NY [""Leaders"" freedoms go lives spread virus halted. 

What that? let get straight second third sure richest man world ability make major impact USA whole responding instead ok go fuck himself. Even small children understand liberty earned responsibility. understand behave well school, parents give freedom. 
 
It's different adult. socially responsible people act, fewer laws needed discourage anti social behaviour. utter shame many people seem unable grasp simple concept. Anyone know subs stories like these? see trolling, misinformation, conspiracy theories, please report comments get flagged us see whole world can't wear N95s, agree going go Trump rally wear N95 bc idiots hear masks begin with. everyone wore surgical mask, need everyday people really need N95 bc spread virus would much contained. issue noncompliance, leads surgical masks much. America def Great lol. whole fiasco shows education system failing country. think get added next day, can't say sure. hope do. good ICU admissions declining people ICU care worries neighbors. people moving around society spreading disease worried about.

Wages hospital staff much higher Norway Sweden quite many Swedish nurses work Norway. Here's example one Swedish nurse working Norway tested positive Norwegian hospital department Correlation, causation. referring Taiwan Hong Kong South Korea least population exposed SARS MERS related viruses may produced antibodies combat COVID-19? Correction: hospital ship specifically NON Covid-19 patients. I'm European even COVID thought chance permanently live US. There's safety net politics radical me. COVID, I'm speechless everything.

I'm starting think possibility might beginning demise US knew it.   He's donated money one person has, ever. 35.8 Billion lot money. live fort worth. I'm aware garbage. restrictions though. mess Work flow saturation? many factors- Memorial Day, Protests sides, bars, gatherings, travelors, rallies. comes focus blame? shit here. Wether China, right, left, middle, Bill Gates Donald Trump blame, here, killing some, permanently harming some.

We need focus improving situation, pointing fingers virus origin blame spreading it. need focus virus. huge amount us sick political bullshit whining. still donating millions, give 99 percent charity dies leaving 10 million children. act like keep money billionaire. Also Texas

Taking fox news away like taking alcohol away crack addict . long term solution multi-generational. come, glacier's pace

Of course, right people thinking better. Many parts Texas hard live due global warming, too. Either way, less people Texas. inevitable point Since expert this? Oh that's right, created virus released purpose. Always huge believer population control. play, wish friends would play risk it, brother already caught 'mostly' recovered, smoker years long term damage going catastrophic him. Equal opportunity outrage! Degenerate barbarians.. say every country difference US watched whole world. Tv/movies/singers/fashion everything blast world see gobble like sit behind computers talking shit fat dumb americans are. guys amazing sandwiches (subs) though! mean guess wonder read history book. spoils war United States. Yall argue masks continue pile gold Anyone else catch say ‚Äú Pandemic 1‚Äù really close death back early may remember. 10% lung work, several organs failure would dead ecmo stopped. plan operate lung transplant fortunately recovered miraculously getting better better since then. Lucky country good job fighting virus, hospital get overwhelmed concentrate resources help don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs ‚Äúeconomic stimulus‚Äù money, it‚Äôs intended prop economy, keep people financially solvent duration crisis.

These greedy ‚Äúrugged individual‚Äù fucks can‚Äôt wait throw us proverbial incinerator buy cheap property folks lose homes businesses. It‚Äôs one giant scam, American right cheers scammers, even many fall victim them. Spoiler fucks want see people get hurt. Originally read ""the devil's dong"". Bill fuckin Murray support anecdote. almost like would horrible tragedy get together every single holiday birthday graduation baptism baby shower. chill 6 months mom. Please. asking 4th July. Let's keep family alive things next year. Read article cluster fuck Arizona. quoting people saying unless someone know gets sick care take seriously. 

Americans diseased brain rest developed world waking it. suspected irrefutable. Exactly. Stop looking ways complain ways convince people wear masks.

Who gives shit construed sexist, idea article brings up: shame need it.

It doesn‚Äôt matter. wear mask. Don‚Äôt make excuses ways shift conversation. People don‚Äôt care offended inconvenienced, people care alive healthy. still bold plan kill base like this. many try hard make look even worse own? Often lying misconstruing truth? also favors homeless, since little means protect themselves. wave evictions coming... literally title: Reglerna f√∂ljdes inte n√§r G√∂sta, 81, nekades v√•rd

And saying earlier article, not: follow up. Follow ups new information clearly allowed. suck know noticed, article Bill Gates. ridiculous statement Snuff beer may may motivation well. We're almost point jury would convict assume crime name would definitionally impossible. specific context discussion. infringement god given rights obviously/s true would listened scientists opened right way. insane stupidity hurt bottom line. think really busy dumb. criticize want, that's part beauty great country. one other? think got things right things wrong. people like yourself, 100% wrong, matter what, period. That's point. man could cure cancer, complaining it. states increase cases, states biggest increase states ignored containment measures like Texas, Arizona Florida. Therefore one must conclude reopening early ignoring containment measures caused round increase. states protests followed containment measures ways start see increase cases, say protests cause. necessarily. district giving parents option either children online school send person. Either way, teachers required go person school. latest message since last week Yup. don‚Äôt leave house unless it‚Äôs groceries essentials items. trip vet week. 

It alarms many people think I‚Äôm serious keep inviting socialize. Oh, went bars twice week...UGH! That‚Äôs risk. doubt there's 70 million people BLM protest. I'll take mental illness $500, Alex hasn‚Äôt worked far, maybe vague appeal convince people mask socially distance...

Eventually FL‚Äôs luck run virus hit retirement communities it‚Äôs game over. actually stopping counties &amp; cities putting strict local restrictions place recently. 

He fucked state genuinely thought we‚Äôd fine &amp; trying backtrack. asshole. seen cases per day? We‚Äôre back. Today. Riiiiight Wait people usually drink every day? this. wait... got real predicament. says America isn‚Äôt world leader more? 

Brazil way toppling us though. Nice face paint. Americans realize weakens military response right ? Aka, someone could something fragile period time hospitals overloaded 20% military infected helping ground usa cities...
Also economy.. china bouncing back.. trying take opportunities job market company profits. live Austin, worst positive rate nation, someone recently finished Chemo breast cancer. Nevermind lost jobs (I used business... much) COBRA eating alive atmospheric monthly cost top costs there. We're Unemployment, extra $600 expires end next month things going get tight. 

I right man. Anxiety roof. I've got hope 2021 bring something new. hope don‚Äôt get sick ""Slow testing downnnn!"" Lol. I'm Baytown, TX. give one single fuck. Yeah, vaccination never comes every single person world get within next 5-10 years so. 

And immunization 3 months (I read yesterday again) get till hits 50s die. Kindof annoyed Massachusetts thing everyone stay inside got shit control kids crayon munching states flood colleges two months. Honestly every student required get tested coming in.  Although agree really dumb businesses remained open, describe joke general. Speaking anecdotally, roads *dead* even peak traffic hours, background sound cars actually mostly gone while. stay home order, apartment parking lot barren day, afterward packed day every day everyone home. 

Even lot businesses skirted intent, still seemed *massive* reduction people going work. brainer indeed. Masks everywhere honestly, don‚Äôt leave home without it. see people saying it‚Äôs ok go park without mask. It‚Äôs fucking not. Mask moment leave house. possible, young people also ones typically engaging risky behavior well going clubs bars, dining out, congregating house parties, beaches, etc. I'm sure protests good job spreading COVID people infected otherwise would contact with. Nobody gives damn. see 4/10 people wearing mask go run errands grocery shop. word protests source? miss omniscience part? Omg where? despicable shit told risks ignored science order kiss Trumps ass. 

Texans, man gambled lives Onion job I'm AZ (Gilbert). Stay safe brother/sister. Could put effort trolling please Ah, right. see went wrong there. things either considered treats live inarguably unhealthy breakfasts, albeit breakfast foods. 
Sugar always sounds good. quick reward intense. 

I'm glad gorged whatever honey found. Well, think? getting xD

Yeah, can't imagine every day. sounds kind awful get onto nonstop bloodsugar rollercoaster. 

I'm honestly left :/ feel bad many addicted insane amounts sugar super short chain carbohydrates. Bah. God damn country motherfucker right now. great yet, fucking idiots? taught - kids understand it. I'm California. logic behind push narrative protests aren‚Äôt blame. Miami share insanity rest Florida. People upset mayor closed beaches punish county protests this. Eh, live people give shit people. close fully open, cases dropping daily months now, fully masked. need keep southerners state. ""we're reopening economy""

Okay must get Canada. It‚Äôs new frontier. must way vast wilderness. Right there‚Äôs wall stop us. 

Maybe start convoy. I‚Äôm sure gather tens thousands us make voyage start new life. like old days. Maybe get wagons horses. Plus hear there‚Äôs gold hills. could get rich. Found Washingtonian. Dark days indeed, friend. Apparently 40% population ""forcing put concentration camps faces.""

This reaction preventable, leaders chose cause strife get off. See y‚Äôall tomorrow, time, place, headline Hey, went /r/sportsbetting

I found intertops.sports.eu felt safest me. make sure check local laws are. crime. Masks given people wearing them. everyone afford mask still need go get groceries supplies. refuse wear mask given one, fine order, best thing supply one dont one. Brazil still long, *long* ways go catch USA cases deaths. Oh god ain‚Äôt good all. one taking seriously, screwed fear. hospitals reach breaking point happens death skyrocket. Mass murder isnt solution, COVID-19 let run course. countries develop population growth slows. Want combat overpopulation? Advocate reform aid health education poorer countries, ridiculous Thanos style culling. Unfortunate basically useless pretty much population density map. number means nothing tested ton people. %positives increasing??? scary. went pick food restaurant couple days ago. one wearing mask. Three employees wearing masks, noses. People looking like crazy. Everything open here. Amusement parks, casinos... disaster. valid question would say no. think gatherings 10 acceptable people quarantining much possible smart decisions (in state larger 10 allowed play game).

My plan also eat yard family ate patio (I'm city neighborhood suburbs). think enough protective measures put place. start asking extremely obvious relevant questions? Oh that‚Äôs right, supposed pretend protests didn‚Äôt cause this. Trump useless imbecile ever roam planet. 

That said, saying testing correct. test, cases revealed. 

Deaths per day continue go down. may go again, they've trending U.S. while. 

This disease warning shot. right largely denies exists, left over-amplifying lethality. bad, we're actually lucky. much worse scenarios much menu must prepare for. happen again, may benign next time. Again, may true, match known covid hospitalizations, week, week represented bar graph (or real life).

Again, laboratory confirmed hospitalizations reported CDC. knew half think know, would obvious posted chart thought dropped mic.

I know heck lot do, kid. gets boring educating people like nothing point regarding infections age trying cite data back point.

Oh yeah. real life example unfolding everybody's eyes happens versus speculation driven by...what? gut feeling? biases? know someone flew TX yesterday vacation. told planning going water park tomorrow pretty sure fucking me.... hopefully. Actually, need mask social distancing(if possible). Unfortunately, people want wear mask. See y‚Äôall tomorrow, time, place, headline winning?? 0-1 friends real life I‚Äôm shocked many people thought would
only last month two, we‚Äôd fully back normal quickly. they‚Äôre saying ‚Äúwell least fall look forward to, then‚Äù.

Jesus Christ. people look data history all? Minus vaccine, things September 2021. best.

If people raising hell now, bad 6 12 months? really don‚Äôt give shit leftist former director CDC says

So fucking predictable lol borris Jonson tried that, changed mind pretty quick Even though go smoothly them, complete shit-show think people downplaying cultural differences. cannot expect average American clean average Swede. mention probably respect masks social distancing lot more. needs fiction, reality? Genuine actual question here-

Could due increased testing? Maybe far cases start know nearly enough testing going on. maybe actually less cases looks like don't? Lol oh ok, one particular county mean way others CA rising states like AZ, TX, FL, Carolinas among many areas? numbers far outweigh county town alone alarmist according you? Maybe try looking whole picture, compassion people hurting even they‚Äôre outside little bubble. 

This goes way, way, way bigger circle people know. everyone, sooner realize sooner actually start working together solution. 0 patience ‚Äúme‚Äù crowd, isn‚Äôt ‚Äúme‚Äù. It‚Äôs ‚ÄúWe‚Äù. part solution instead problem Dont underestimate resiliency humans, going hard eradicate completely. I'm sure Elon isnt one rocking crazy bunker. tell whatever need soon protesting happened suddenly one cares corona virus anymore.

Surprised picachu spreads even now. mandate open September, long series vague safety recommendations, allowed interpreted differently school.

Did Trump write plan?

If schools Northeast can't make work, rest country (who take virus seriously) stand chance. California opened damn early. one following safety procedures I‚Äôm waiting Disney world announce delay opening. rate pandemic climbing FL, who‚Äôs going want come Disneyworld anyway? Ok, don‚Äôt answer that. Let rephrase, rate, Florida things close hospitals fill up?  don‚Äôt see anything good coming Disney pushing reopen health system straining. maybe nosey. Go give unwanted opinion somewhere else. Bye, Felicia. Darwinism. even regional type situation, like northeast starting restrict certain visitors. Currently reading 8933 'official' 8938. mean later today? Today, Friday highest. Instead static amount, percentage based income.
1% yearly income first offense, 2%, 3% - half going healthcare workers. course, businesses wanted liability protection. knew forcing workers increase risk death want pay it. Also, forget business lobbied states enforce pulling unemployment people want report back work complained unemployment payments generous.

We're pretty much living Chernobyl 2: Bigger, dumber, deadly. 2nd place? Come on, Georgia, got try harder. Kemp's counting us beat Florida! entire northeast, epicenter US outbreak pretty good job. rest country could reacted similar manner we'd way better position.

What's worse decent trajectory reopening unfortunately since southern states decided little nothing they'll probably ruining rest us. Hopefully travel law tri-state area recently introduced actually enforced 3. already murder hornets. covid trackers told ask positive persons attended protest? causation don‚Äôt allow relevant causation question asked. ignoring scientific facts

Imagine thinking know better experts, lol. Picking headline think make right exactly like anti-vaxxer autism stats. epidemiologist done thorough studies complexities?! 

What know fact mass gathering spread virus. End story. found troubling raise voice prevent unmasked patients walking in. explained one came puck negative results:""You right thing, results negative, may dashed sacrifice walking unmasked facility seeing Cov19 positive cases. exposed yourself!"" looked shocked understood. 

To illustrate Mom calls ""jello-brains"", numerous patients ignore signs outside door says ""STOP. ENTER"", walk entrance, ignore sign inner door says ""STOP: CAUTION ENTER - COVID19 EXPOSURE! SAFETY WAIT HERE"". 

Jello-brains. probably spend much time Facebook I'm college hoping I'll least classes online. I'm art major feel safe using shared equipment, including computers. sound argumentative, confidently think that? 


I remember days observing behavior China Europe basically talking hoarse trying get people take seriously. everyone strange confidence would blow over. one could ever explain exactly thought that. 


It's honest question, engaging wishful thinking? 


I trying learn better convince type person. Hopefully even necessary SARS-CoV-2 resolved part daily lives. people choose get vaccines, than... I'll live forced vaccinations. prefer people choose, still, wont....you can't kill kids young sick vaccinate. happens economy put human lives?

i dont actually know america rushed open everything dont think surprise literally anyone earth would covid trackers told specifically *not* ask positive persons attended protests? 

The answer? protect narrative you‚Äôre pushing ‚Äî spike isn‚Äôt caused mass protests. problem feel much financial pressure makes risking health everyone else's health seem reasonable, middle disaster worry paying bills. 

Why get trillion dollars banks started? still going foreclose thousands people point?

It's different demanding run back burning building bank needs document decided responsible for. People grown complacent false sense safety going around south never hit nearly hard north wrongly making people think reacted. lot fake news going around masks working/stay home orders working, reason people eating up. mention became political even worse now. I'm fully expecting shit-show. I'm hoping nobody care dies/gets sick point much turn around conservative communities begin hit hard. many deaths could've avoided already, sad. Canadians like Mayo. actual personality. ""better America"" main trait. Never met German acted way. never met Italian acted way. Canadians. makes feel better fact always 2nd rate compared Western Europe. hilarious. Doubly satire. I‚Äôm tired us winning time guys make farty sounds armpit! won't. feel like headlines couple weeks bigger numbers day truth unwanted conversation. mean state state basis? instructor Case Investigator class today: ""people usually do, need call 3 times max mostly."" want get excited, research I've read, people asymptomatic tend weaker immune systems. would Google it. I'd link bit annoying phone. son 2nd grade. school total enrollment ~150 kids K-5th. They're talking splitting school days half classes come per day online learning ""off"" days. Masks required (not exactly sure work two autistic children class). Desks supposed 6 ft apart, bad considering class sizes 10-15. Water fountains closed meals eaten classrooms. 3yo supposed start pre-school fall think we're going skip year enroll next year. feels like bad idea send mess. guess could mean literally people still shocked this? Millions millions people likely US. easily spreadable lot cases asymptomatic. RESEARCH. 
just bc cnn,fox,ABC fooling you, not.
Do real web search, stuff isnt fed bs agenda narrative 
Either way, pawns :) ""It time die""

-Floridians makes sense. actually heard hospitals say reaching limits. twO wEeKs :-)  leadership. lack leadership. could spent several trillion ensuring Americans good internet, fed children, funding parents can't go work. 


It's resources, government chooses hand resources corporations EVERY time. look exponential growth terms doubling time must account increases testing. 0-1 million, 1-2 million, 2-4 million, 4-8 million. fuck didn‚Äôt present way? Hmmm...

Remember didn‚Äôt think thing March? LOL. people got turned away tests testing limited severe cases - yeah, never included numbers. We‚Äôre finally seeing iceberg beneath surface increased testing. Hmmm...

So, Tom Friedman either fraud pushing narrative, he‚Äôs fucking stupid. really don‚Äôt give shit leftist former director CDC says - wonder thought CDC busy telling everybody wear mask intentionally lying public preserve PPE? Funny MSM glossed that.

Regarding comment down, no, nobody got me, guys fucking sheep easily manipulated MSM. whole thing entirely politicized never would turned shit show 2015. inflection point coming two weeks based recent spikes disease progression - I‚Äôm gonna say July 6 - deaths aren‚Äôt apocalyptic levels AZ, FL, TX MSM hype past two weeks bullshit. Yea sub really alarmist misleading. Make mistake numbers good now, question. area California even worse late February early March EVERYONE around getting really sick. I‚Äôm convinced already got really ill symptoms. Many coworkers customers also got sick. absolutely way get tested though unless ended hospital. Sure enough one coworkers hospitalized feeling sick mid March. positive. anyone get tested means lot people going get tested. That‚Äôs good thing, think high numbers California little bit increasing cases increasing testing. [Here 3 died (yes fucking DIED) detention centers. that's tip. children anything follow parents. Look left, Felipe Gomez Alonzo, Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez Jakelin Caal Maquin three children died custody U.S. Customs Border Protection

You fuck off. Given quality data whether you‚Äôre talking moving averages, Ôøºover window, etc. 41K 50K less number. 

‚ÄúLie‚Äù implies intention mislead. going here. told ask it. hide cause, it‚Äôs cause. say anything murder? guys kill refusing vaccines building backyard rocket try prove earth flat blowing up. guys take care need murder. Unfortunately take many thousands you.

And yeah hospitals everywhere usually run around 80-85% full. One many downsides private insurance medical fields. want run close full capacity times maximize profits. fairly unusual full though start getting people worried

Also I'm super confused. hospitals full empty? saying empty saying they're always full? That's really weird. almost like know wrong actually full want admit wrong. weren't. I‚Äôve read threads, could lock fully today would peak around 2 weeks time. Everyone going die point, get now?

Huh... Actually written sounds like something monster would seriously suggest. probably voted can‚Äôt look new cases say hit new record. many test percent positive tests increase?
If it‚Äôs 46K 500k lot different 46K 100K. 
The increase testing could reason observing new daily positive cases. Wine. live wine reps. Fucks acid reflux bad. quality free wine drink I'm scared. Many sheriffs elected they're bowing constituents who, ironically, sheep wearing masks. Thank goodness Texas least something. Unlike Arizona blissfully trying pretend nothing happening still. small risk virus

This may true regarding people dying say shit. significant number people dealing long term effects this, even 'mild' symptoms. houseplant. read vitamin deficiencies severe cases high correlation, pushed gf along family taking supplements every day keep levels high. find study read, I‚Äôll link it. ""not wear masks well"" ? places dumb? Asian countries much empathy see use mask low deaths.... embarrassing western countries behind never mind fact US universal health care fighting idea using MASK hahaha insane think vulnerable people way cautious general everything we've learned whereas everyone basically take seriously simply know bad problem due lack testing. 

Now, lot low risk people taking seriously positive cases weighted heavily towards them, seeing overall mortality rate. low risk positives reach critical mass though, likely risk people get sick simply hard avoid. eternal night right now? Sold! Unfortunately someone educated one area study, lacking intelligence overall. 

I 2 family members, 1 engineer 1 lawyer deep batshit insane conspiracies (Q)
I really feel schools need teach critical thinking skills. Plus classes identify reputable sources/not believe everything see internet. literally cases recorded **since pandemic started** country long term health effects recovery.   
Best get all. need care may also develop chronic issues far last month 21 teachers retire....this month 13 taking January...so 34 teachers need replace next months...

Plus still 3 agendas sept. I'm sure retiring. understaffed begin district 14,000 children. state guidelines came today, impossible follow 99% them. 

We hoping send sort poll,questioner,to see parents employees think. know half district refuse go back September current conditions. I'm petrified return job,this virus going away anytime soon. sad lot taking seriously,and heart aches previous lives lost affected this. okay. It'AAD DJaadte. promise didn‚Äôt add lol genuinely want see what‚Äôs 4 months. hope look back good spirits!! both? doesn't, aid come price businesses longer liable wrongful death lawsuits related virus, another 2 generations grandchildren paying off. Eh, what's 10 trillion dollars? guys never get tired comment huh. Protesters' failure complete. still white cake, 10"" round one now. Got one birthday last month still half freezer. lot Karens, anti-vaxxers, bible thumpers running around fewer pandemic goes on. Kemp deserves burned alive front family. Hawaii would choice. southwest wheee it‚Äôs hotter Good resource reading total employees number might well include administration, HR, janitorial. dont see firefighters count either. 

So apples oranges noted -- number firefighters affected total employees 14 percent, non-firefighter staff covid19, percentage goes up. Wait 2 weeks 4th July. You‚Äôre exactly right that. layman saying ‚ÄúI doubt‚Äù response scientific study actually devaluing science. almost mass protests pandemic good idea. weakest hit hardest. amount people infected easily ten fold known infection rate. Like said saturation occurring. point locking anymore. realize sarcastic, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Yikes. Hawaii schools Texas, Arizona New Mexico Thanos-style random. virus picks people vulnerable, picks populations vulnerable, e.g. poor food health care. creates incentives better health-care systems healthier populations. US vulnerable large part many younger adults terrible health due over-processed food income disparities lead far many people getting healthy diet good preventive health care. Shoddy housing may also factor lower-income people.

Eradicating poverty world-wide, poorer countries, good idea, overpopulation, also mitigating outbreaks like this. either-or, both-and.  Disney already delaying plans. governor zero power force reopen  Austin ISD talking 20% class goes school one day week, everyone gets person time four days virtual/online. 

If there‚Äôs infection cohort, miss two weeks person class everyone else cleared, go back. 

Seems like totally fucks working parents - stimulus bill could dealt nah, airlines needed 250 billion whatever fuck else money. dude go it, safe wanna it, go live uo Schools Southwest Imagine stupid blame huge spike cases Southern states (who reopened early restrictions) BLM protests üòÇ Half population thinks virus fake big deal. even talking about? still protests/riots going on... many times, got nice resident discount. criticize countries things worse us, more? crying rooftops terrible Merkel is? Sweden? No. not. Something maybe roll around head awhile. know aunt uncle big group time travels? weren‚Äôt, would posit traveling city suburbs different traveling different city. 

More that, think ridiculous. I‚Äôm concerned getting people wear mask unimaginable convincing get vaccine uphill battle. theory already movie. ""Idiocracy"" going lot harder hide full hospitals dead bodies.

Well, release COVID-19 hospitalization data, lot people dying ""pneumonia."" solution ""some computer figures it""? KC STL saved Missouri far.

The governor basically left everything local counties cities, basically deciding nothing.

They really bore brunt bad decisions, KC STL (by far biggest population centers) enacted pretty strict measures early on. Extra helpful, also state's hospital capacity.

Sadly, rest state catching lot sticking ""do mostly nothing"" worked earlier year. Even wear mask pumping gas.

I wear disposable glove bother sanitizing hand.

But wear mask unless I'm going inside. Apologies, I‚Äôll keep Depends reopen smartly. could done south too, criteria move one phase another. wrong totally disregard metrics aside two weeks phases went 25% open 50% open 75% open without reexamining data previous phase.

If reopen phases, actually take account data make sure virus blowing up, definitely reopen safely.

The major problem individual states going imported cases neighbors. cohesive strategy thing, I'm afraid going see rolling lockdowns virus makes way back forth across country. need real leadership unified strategy ever want get thing control.  Better late never guess, fuck, really late. Oh fantastic news! Middle seat believe God plan. also believe total moron, that's create us brains expect us use them. assume Abbot actually cares stopping virus. significant portion Texas electorate think COVID blown threat. people r/Houston arguing COIVD deadly highly infectious disease. Texas GOP cant afford piss people off, act like COVID big deal. think Florida surpass NY worst terms new cases soon.... disaster. course, clear, really practical disability medical condition would prohibit someone wearing mask still able shop / walk around.

I various autism groups people massive sensory issues face masks. Also people mental challenges function like PTSD might issues. course, people mostly stay home get deliveries instead. would think Anything say sort crapshoot. Wait till Monday see whether positive not, then, try maintain distance brother law. point giving figures since would essentially guesses. I've flown times last months could sit middle seat. booking 66% whatever comes ... I'm jealous NJ ; never thought words would come incredibly frustrating. People wear lack education it‚Äôs badge honor advantage. noted Ontario also completed tests ever before...more testing necessarily lead cases.  can't even tell people wear masks. People stupid. England started falling time 2 countries US USSR started rise hole left filled. Also England started going 2 world wars involved heavily India breaking away. None things happen US without world collapsing too. prejudiced towards US stating facts. Again!?! happened massive purchases months ago. hell eating there? vegemite stuff? must trained Indian pilots licenses It‚Äôs true ICU = respirator beds Sweden. Yeah, though depend are. Costa Brava people going lot jaded Galicia. CDC thing. get rid them?

Leaving leaves China powerful member. clue Orange set old Baptist Hospital help Orange County, can't place blame politicians. live Calif people responsible mess in.

You need government tell going crowded bars wearing mask bad idea pandemic. need threat jail fines make what's best interest deserve ever get.....unfortunately people take others collateral damage. guy get told scientists Social distance, t, Scientist tell go party, made bbq, Scientist tell wear mask, even convince Familie t. believe god.

2 months later painful Death covid heaven asks god ""why protect me?""

 God: ""you stupid moron send 3 direct orders credible sources safe you"" Perhaps woman would like pay bill virus patients bars. course. late save many businesses. (Of course, late many lives, too)

Also, someone Austin, us need change anything. I've quarantining 4 kids masking months, many months Guv dipshit. Teachers next sacrifice parents tired dealing kids. Average American teacher middle aged overweight. People struggling get poor neighborhoods filled drugs guns.

Do hear sound distance? [The recent example yesterday's NBC Nightly News personal favorite shared days ago dude audacity start gofundme help pay medical bills. People wear masks ones care others die... Yeah, way they‚Äôre another lockdown. They‚Äôre going keep pushing many people herd immunity develops. God knows long take. new. guns. somebody posts wish fewer guns US, somebody else post able whatever gun want rights important public safety. Hmm...

Yep. figured pretty bad it. He's also pretty non-confrontational guy must pushed limit. attitude around abominable. would agree except even then, they'll blame relatives pre-existing conditions. Thanks bro someone explain me? protocols place record cases/deaths 24 hour basis numbers weekend always lower. seems standard reporting able pick weekends based numbers. statistical anomaly explains this? big country mean anything. Basically America sucks. There's almost social safety net anywhere, even ""progressive"" areas, parts least terrible extremely expensive. think happen. is, far little dial back long-term mitigation measures meaningful measure, society 20% immunity less risk serious outbreaks virgin territory. morons saying virus we‚Äôre talking do, lot people think goes away April, heat, heat comes in, typically go away April,‚Äù Trump repeated later group governors. don‚Äôt think going go well. states would make plan let parents know, accommodations made now, rather fly. parent adjunct soon teacher, think way handled awful. 65th Ah, anti mask lunacy actually moderated? Good hear! Thanks reply. dont get people say Pence worse Trump, I'd rather leader mentally ill doesnt watch Fox News 8 hours day, basic things like complete full sentence.

Sure he's hardcore fundamentalist Christian, Trump acts way, dying every hill religious supporters want to. mother-in-law's Canadian sister said something effect.... ""My friend died, cancer death certificate said covid-19"".... Like cancer precludes dying something else. Texas admit first, strongly disagree Greg Abbott handled despite incompetence responding clearly genuinely concerned  report title title article misleading understand people can't chill short period time. act like forever. year. There's guarantee likely get better.

You answered question. There's guarantee. get say temporary, breathe say ""but really, know! temporary though, hold out, k?"" think healthcare system one third-world country, pretty ignorant healthcare system really third-world country. 

You Google it. hard. 

Here's clue, there's medicines people usually die floor, even bed. 

People COVID-19 put basement IV check every morning see they're still alive, change IV gone next morning. treatment anything. checked see die every day, day.  That's really works Texas. members party 100% guaranteed elected statewide office win primary. know possibility ever truly held accountable either mistakes malfeasance, ignore former ramp latter.

This works whenever single-party rule state country. Corruption, negligence, malfeasance, criminality, ultimately violence. did. explain what‚Äôs new? bumper sticker Get fuck many new deaths? 

Oh that‚Äôs right, daily death count decreased fast daily infection count increased. they're wearing mask, they're clearly stupid save. Sounds like triage me. mercy communities communities full idiots Governor Abbott concerned JADE HELM 15 actual plague understand worry is, similar Finland finish people cross border work Sweden get sick. ICU numbers important overall picture, especially people contest infections happening (so infection rate increasing) tests done increase confirmed cases due that. sure asking. Haha money printer goes brrrrrr company lot business Texas travel lot. head division announced day refuse travel Texas don‚Äôt feel comfortable going they‚Äôll fully support decision. couldn‚Äôt help laugh. Fucking Texas, like it‚Äôs war zone something. Think mass amounts people street protesting may contributed bit more. Could wrong, sure doesn‚Äôt get brought more. don‚Äôt forget kissing/fucking/sucking. stuff always happens around alcohol known spread virus two. youth.

and/or exercising. 

This explains people dont understand could happen without symptoms. We're given lung capacity need inactivity. mildest cases, damage isnt great enough cause shortness breath unless exercising fairly hard. also moderate severe cases also show shortness breath walking climbing set stairs. sever cases leave patient unable get around house without struggle. shades gray. think could ""go back re-do anything"" would 8th grade biology could understand basic fucking science. Definitely‚Äî wasn‚Äôt trying mislead anything. Thanks giving numeric context post! somehow missed warnings past weeks public health officials saying protests would expand pandemic. one article focused Tulsa. exclude COVID spreading protests, article's focus. Pretending makes look balls-in-mouth stupid.

Like said, check back two weeks articles COVID spreading protests satisfy ghoulish pride. meantime, figure way comment feel superior people thread one.

TL;DR: Get bent. LMAO what? Maybe long government taken opportunity possible take rights? don‚Äôt give fuck masks, 1st 2nd amendment? don‚Äôt disappear we‚Äôre pandemic. definitely nothing shitheads gathering tens thousands major cities everywhere looting protesting shit doesn‚Äôt matter compared health nation. -_- warned.... probably arrested. crime charged admitted spread virus knowledge positive ? Go look big critical pro Swedish groups Facebook. Reddit weird FB links link Swedish able search easily. That's easily explained shift demand. corporate sandpaper garbage find businesses, gas stations fast food places longer used. places make quality TP resources cover huge surge demand. hoarding much massive shift used. may contributing factor. People Florida, Texas, especially Arizona spend time indoors AC summer heat. northeast, people spending time outdoors good weather. distinction huge large part protests spread virus much.

Why pattern happen flu? Texas restaurants 30 years: ""Enjoy EXTRA BIG ASS FRIES"" know talking about. understand. value changed 2%, daily growth rate, percentage, changed 2. exponential growth lot. mentioning standard deviation mean anything context. literally understand results study measuring. know watch couple hours sports week ‚Äúuse mental capacity better yourself‚Äù too, right? Jesus Christ pretentious. smart, dear. Stay strong thank responsible. easy make living need compete folks undereducated. looking cause trouble, contact tracing really useful? Think it, people install apps obvious reasons, human memory highly fallible, importantly time tracing actually completed, damage already done.

Does make sense allocate resources preparedness (PPE, testing etc.) instead?

Looking opinions this. virus ‚Äúpick choose idiots‚Äù doesn‚Äôt solve bigger issue though.

What people fail realize science process. niche anti-science bullshit theories sexy enough garner headlines clicks often offer theory point blank solution. People don‚Äôt patience actually wait see things unfold, willing accept hypothesis educated guess could dead wrong. want real world problems solved fashion TV series solves problems: 30-60 minutes give take occasional advertisement.

Our educational system (for kids adults) needs massive overhaul teach processes, time consuming, important. Otherwise we‚Äôre going continue shooting foot. Spoilers, bro. Damn. Sure, numbers important. It‚Äôs pretty relative. excess death statistics? rights mandatory mask order pandemic infringe on? tried Buffalo Wing kind! They‚Äôre great certain amount holidays birthdays run coworkers tho care rich dude says so. Oooh wait.  
I care vast majority virologists vouch handing vaccines receive millions him... Oooh wait.. 
I got it. care gave billions China.. waaaait starting northern illinois. 2 months ""stay home order"". nice. people part, followed rules...but ever since governor lifted order? People think ""it's over"" that's that. :/ making uncomfortable ""Gosh coworkers seem get Covid every week! That's ok. See 4th July then? I'm going make potato salad. later month we're late graduation Kelly, since May. grandma's birthday we're going celebrate early might last one.""

It's endless... New improved.... everyone sign award Oh, sucks region then, bad. 


I know contradicts seen, asked share social media ""anecdata"". Damn autocorrect ruining jokes. Supposedly slightly higher risk/mildly higher risk, nonetheless: He‚Äôll yeah USA USA USA USA!!!

We‚Äôre gonna power , fear ! Actually, Japanese people already wore masks pandemic, still it. mention fact Japan virus control extremely well compared America (Japan roughly 18,000 active cases write this, believe.)

 Compare America, never really worse masks unless Medical field. virus control, fact strong beacon do, numbers rapidly increse.

I know getting information from, would enjoy seeing it. Please source can.

Thank you, nice day. work someone who's daughter went vacation Florida airplane week. around great decision making there. like many years ago. Eh idk live houston threw knew u right praised highly able last bit longer  +9636 cases florida. bad, tested 78,000 people. residents Florida accept crap government health department puts statistics? report hospitalizations, report nursing home deaths. Florida worst. ‚ÄúMay be‚Äù =/= ‚Äúwill be‚Äù. 

‚ÄúHave attended large mass gathering?‚Äù mandatory question tracking virus actual, intended goal. Someone posted similar sentiment yesterday. new antibody study? Last saw almost 20% definitely help slow spread nowhere near 50%. study released February project total amount death COVID-19 range 15-50 million. guess important point statement less stupid able grasp something wrong... ‚ÄúExperts said finding probably either contaminated sample separate coronavirus outbreak, although research needed‚Äú

Telegraph fucking tabloid. Remindme! 20 years Masks lot better nothing, filter 100% virus might shedding. know sure infected, fraction that's filtered still want expose others to. Refusing wear mask ""fuck man."" ""fuck everyone me."" work makes staff wear library visitors, I'll happy continue wear point give second official warning put plan fix ""issue."" Fuck get link that? sounds wild. TL;DR - ""yes, kind that....so?"" despicable soul. rock garden I‚Äôm fairly certain higher IQ DeSantis. wonder difficult would samples modified. way CCP pushing narratives, don‚Äôt trust anyone Every day I've worked I've least one person talk stupid find interesting assertions 1) threaten him, 2) received death threats. First, era, Trump followers are, think photographing someone, naming accusing anti-Trump actions social media basically asking militia attack. I'm sure received ton scary threats post. Further, strongly doubt **she** received death threats. right-wingers violent. probably received ton messages calling b\*tch, kind ask it. answered question best anyone can. mean anything consistent, various meanings, they're grounded fact reason. They're ways creating confusion people's minds political ends. example, ask physical biology accepted semantic argument. many, physical biology accepted all. cases, fact edge cases like hermaphroditism used argue bio sex spectrum. Still others point endocrinological research try argue sub classes gender.

The common thread among scientists, they're interested scientific method veracity, simply want abolish idea sex gender, make half baked, often ridiculous assertions one scientific community take seriously. large platform, though, threat science scientific scholarship real. don‚Äôt conspiratorial blame left. point millions protested last week global pandemic. Largest attendance protestors ever I'm sick tired hordes beleaguering boomers. live 5 minutes beach, packed since warm, board walks, beaches, ect. continued down. bars unfortunately threw caution wind overall behavior beaches weeks shown impact. also many protests uptick. 

The biggest concern going indoor dining indoor things opening around fourth July goes. Welcome science! unless makes rich asshole money one cares!


*cries* Apparently manipulating public records felony Florida. DeSantis asked health department go back remove deaths, also state completely underreport deaths degree it‚Äôs criminal. month ago Florida listed like 1,600 Covid deaths, 5,000 pneumonia deaths (yearly average 800). Haven‚Äôt seen updated numbers since can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs gotten better.

DeSantis federally indicted straight fraud administration pulling. Beyond corrupt. really. Likely spanishflu2 So, bus coming going home important appointment. I'm NYC things going well felt pretty good since mask everyone else. got bus sitting guy started open mouth sneezing covering mouth... mask chin. 3 times spray sneezing bus. maybe 12 feet him. imagine, felt wildly uncomfortable, got home, stripped down, washed hands changed clothes.

I know people dying/getting seriously ill losing businesses/jobs can't complain much.

Ok. *is* complex **broad** descriptor problem, however it‚Äôs generally accurate assessment.

Yes, well-educated people absolute morons (Ben Carson‚Äôs ‚Äúpyramids storing grain‚Äù remark comes mind), people receive formal education extraordinarily intelligent (see: Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, etc.).

*It's FDA.* understand everything revolves around America? developed United States. think well-respected established universities located overseas give single fuck Trump administration? 

That's politics works. American university, I'd concerned. not. matter whether FDA approves not, university responsible pushing market. don't, vaccine get released. 

Oxford going stake reputation university money Trump. give fuck.

And began started ""opening up"" states never got disease control first place like Texas, California Florida. Plus ICU full covid patients get wreck suffer stroke, shit outta luck. 

America failing level unimaginable four years ago. applied UT Physics program insanely competitive get in. :( Thank much!  Imagine stupid blame huge spike COVID cases Southern states (who reopened early restrictions) BLM protests üòÇ won‚Äôt it. States it, numbers get better, he‚Äôll say it. Thanks protesters. Nobody town tested (around 35,000 people). don‚Äôt test, coronavirus right? someone moved month NYC Texas escape density/cases closer family, quarantine responsibly....then met this? Feels bad man. Whats testing capacity like USA rn? Assuming mean US, no. NJ posted large backlog created giant artifact point graph, subtract NJ data 931 deaths, higher last 2 weeks. lockdown Colorado 8 weeks Yes article headline says. read it? guy smarts CNN keeps reporting due young spring breakers young partiers (notice blame young people).

None medical professionals know mentioned demographics reported along cases? They're blaming young people assholes; data shows cases hospitalizations rising among younger people beginning. things go shut down, cases get manageable, he‚Äôll say ‚ÄúI shut things saved thousands lives. Nobody else thought good idea, it, nobody thanked it.‚Äù See next week inevitable break 60k daily cases. rioting looting ""protesting""... Thanks Abe Lincoln!! Woo go sports team! Gotta move/throw pig/synthetic object over/into/across designated point! Much importance! number seems insane. reported 380 cases Canada yesterday 

Did know population CANADA SMALLER Canada alone. 

Some Canadians like present superior many way, including education, try little harder analysis perhaps? think Bernie good chance making real change. never know. hey least crashed economy President actively trying take away healthcare millions now! I'd say Trump slow testing soon. daughter got full ride UTPB Texas Tech. Chose stay home goto UTPB pocket extra scholarship cash save medical school. Don‚Äôt overdo weed shops best luck you. said yourself. plan deal child care. Schools aren‚Äôt childcare pandemic. Wealthy small business owners?

This assumes crank magnetism thing. Go pick user conspiracy sub, never *one* conspiracy they're about. live conspiracy world. anti-mask people. real pandemic spread batshit crazy conspiracy theories. hope hospitalizations deaths don‚Äôt find growth.

I've read different places pretty large portion newer cases young people, hopefully means hospitalizations lower new cases! I‚Äôm sorry. :( Thank everything do. course. Entire states reopened early restrictions. states hit hardest right now, states biggest protests 

You're moron. Chem trails steel beams obsolete now? setting world records here? Adam Corolla victims? exactly right. seems like one cares happens immediate family member though.

(Typical Fox News readers, guess.) start that? realize fair, I've following Ontario numbers. Yeah Im glad American either seem like douche So..... ask obvious? instituting social distancing &amp; working home again? numbers supported then, support now? See tomorrow, headline. We‚Äôve hit peak. Source? people wearing masks live? 

I‚Äôm Tennessee people wearing masks here. Comments Facebook community news posts full people‚Äôs conspiracy theories, fake facts, etc. even mayors try mandate masks, many refuse want ‚Äúdefy government overreach‚Äù. 

I‚Äôve isolated 100 days we‚Äôre high risk household. order grocery pick up. go driving around time time, staying car, moment house. Nobody‚Äôs wearing masks going stores drive by. 
I swear point I‚Äôm never getting isolation.

What‚Äôs mask situation live? Probably needs it.but States need don‚Äôt want it. Big country. parts like end k-12 school year peak summer heat 4th july?
Wtf going happen then? sometimes would regret choice going nursing route life I'm surorisngly thankful lmao worldview damaged. think blind spot US. ideology free market suggests always private incentive anything. case testing case situation US poorly. China centralized government decide everything. one asked rights, expected comply orders. US strengths weakness right now. think really soon governors states going cave public pressure regarding inaction mandate masks absolutely nothing (maybe curb exponential spread less exponential) it‚Äôs late mask wearing doesn‚Äôt reduce spread it‚Äôs seeded everywhere everyone going day completely open. 

They‚Äôll shrug shoulders blame poor compliance mask wearing culprit well say ‚Äúsee? Masks don‚Äôt anything! weren‚Äôt wrong mandate them!‚Äù minor cough compared blue death. 1918 plague comes back, know it. bet Moroccan weed shit too! certainly explains infection rate death rate, rest country took exact measures NYC exact time...except didn‚Äôt infections. Leading lockdown fatigue extreme financial stress...It‚Äôs like standing swinging bat hour anyone pitches baseball. You‚Äôd feel like idiot probably much mood batting practice time come. Even Cheney promoting mask wearing right now. ""where country"" ??? mean, worst nation world regards deaths infection rate? 


Credit credit due: one thing America good killing people. Yep, ignore information happens outside USA, see point. really bad first thought ""hope catch it?""

I'm scared. think I'm empathy. think I've actually reached new bottom emotionally watching countrymen respond pandemic. Theres gotta line where, crossed, legally hang elected representative signpost.

Lying crisis currently killing citizens really line.   Even people pro vaccine going skeptical vaccine that‚Äôs rushed normal track development safety testing, even based almost-finished released vaccine related virus. source said 14 100-150 party got infected via contact tracing. That's 10-15% people who, presumably, none wore masks. 

If fails specify many (even zero) traced protests. 

Without numbers saying many infected traced protests (failure specify number zero), **you cannot conclude virus spreading protests.**

Disgraceful reporting. conclusion currently draw data reported article wearing masks promotes spread virus, protests parties somehow independent events. reality situation **not protesters wear masks.** year long time someone expected ""behave themselves"" ... forced behave 2 years thumb shit blame Trump want think great job. 
 
What Trump do, specifically, think great?
 
The thing think **did** implement toothless travel restrictions mainland China virus already confirmed spread 20 countries. action resulted tens thousands travelers rushing return home. wasn‚Äôt great.
 It‚Äôs per say fault different states different leaders different things. 
 
He‚Äôs president. Swedish I‚Äôm really happy live Germany. They‚Äôre pandemic pedant. Surprise! Coronavirus exists No, convey point.  Murcia

Why everyone keep posting Spain? would closing possible Sweden? They're municipality owned. Closing completely them.

From seeing lots harbors, lakes beaches (both person course spammed social media, would love social media examples) last weeks, overcrowding struck major problem. Distance usually held, like pretty much anywhere else, we've confirmed outdoor transmission low. would probably especially true near water winds quickly disperse aerosol spray etc. invest? Right, would think also true hospital complexes. Take La Jolla clinics San Diego example. Maybe could donate another 10 something else? He'd still richer anyone world ever Yep, that‚Äôs it. Btw they? follow earlier article Yup hence judge's point. 

Extremely self centered narcissistic society. mean holy Christ look elected president. Makes Camacho look like MLK. car loan student loans agree you. What's nonsense part Canada's reopening US lieing death toll? since week 18 though. Also they're really unexplained mysterious, they're attributed Covid-19. week 18 excess death. contrary, expected number deaths lower normal, generally. course Placerville, place it‚Äôs unusual see Confederate flags guys business literally named used hang Chinese people there. fireworks typically are. Facepalm. **major** communications failure Danish ministry justice *and* poor reporting across Danish Swedish press. least fixed posthaste, tiny handful Swedes able exploit confusion enter without test. word they've expelled yet. 

Well, least fixed tiny handful took advantage probably harm all. Sounds like community directly coffins   world's top hospitals universities secondary schools, problem institutions accessible wider public general baseline depending socio-economic class really low. 


I would much rather system everyone guaranteed baseline good quality healthcare education, rather elite exceptional services. think extremely optimistic goal hope teachers preparing e-learning test plans regardless. I‚Äôll give bars hotels beaches, sure that‚Äôs virus spreading. True. Even obvious. large portion people seen rioting protesting wearing masks, they. social distancing , they. Numbers like anything else. coaxed giving whatever answer want. Someone attended protest, later went bar? Well, must caught Coronavirus bar. that's fudge number. I've lost weight I've gained past six years unhealthy eating habits lack exercise. I've got food purchasing point $120-$140 last 12-14 days. involves cooking everything eat lots vegetables chicken. try two-three days without meat. still consume sugar twice week. 

I also already 55 lb SelectTech weights, pull-up bar P90x DVDs everything needed. P90x routine made people trapped indoors. run twice week well.

All told I've shed 60 lbs since December 3rd last year. still lose another 15 lbs I'm 178 lbs currently. Yeah, something grows exponentially simple. Cutting infection risk half could easily difference continued uncontrolled spread making fizzle completely. number lives saved change infection risking enough information infer current tend. can‚Äôt shut whole country, top four biggest countries: Russia China Brazil US got hit hard didn‚Äôt shut whole country. focus pockets. Nope, point billionaires exist, do, they, government, failed divest wealth sufficiently. I'm familiar case judges supposed make laws. That's role never was. judge does, even decide right direction, overstepping power. 

We system making laws system work, can't various officials randomly choosing take powers never granted. Nobody want single person powers. fianc√© flew yesterday first time since pandemic started American. 2 leg trip, second flight, pretty much packed. impossible social distance Charlotte. wore face shield face mask. Majority people face masks saw 1 person face shield. plane, didn‚Äôt take one sip water eat anything didn‚Äôt remove gear. Disinfected every surface. Showered got home. felt relatively safe considering flight times short we‚Äôre 30. However, probably won‚Äôt least year. least won‚Äôt be. say extra measures protection take (face masks, constantly disinfect everything) surprisingly add much stress travel. already thought planes airports germ-infested cesspools pandemic. cases start going down, doesn‚Äôt seem worth travel leisure point. Things closing again. We‚Äôll see rest year pans out. see! Lol 4 back 80‚Äôs. don‚Äôt remember much one memory stuck holding pole recess kids heading back classrooms found unable move legs. glad young remember spinal taps followed find wrong me. volunteer die ~~country~~ whatever. TikTok it, please. 

I like irony. Andrews quite good handling covid. started reopening last two months, got unlucky cases spread community, people going around meeting family friends made spread. like states also open shopping centres, people visiting family friends, BLM rallies (even though hardly contributed amount cases Melbourne - current cases families visiting Eid). know medical situation. Likelihood much higher certain groups. city 9% mortality rate. uninsured people feeling ill likely avoid costly testing treatment, well less likely able work home, thus facilitating spread virus

Seems like common sense. shame conversation public healthcare typically surrounds cost care rather cost care. Thank you. dislike clickbait titles. won‚Äôt though I'll give example. upstate NY city, limited testing long supply issues. percent positive 6-7% range. restricting testing symptomatic people only. governor ramped testing dramatically. pretty much anyone anywhere get test often free charge. curious, get test. walking Walgreens, stop get tested. sniffle, get test. thousands asymptomatic people getting tested negative. look count positives, pretty level. number daily positives April. stable positives increased negatives - percent positive went 1.2%. current level stupidity impacted 1000 hashtags. point watch play hope forms lesson future pandemics. I'm cynical, I've simply seen much idiocy topic I'm starting wonder human race stands chance. Toxic masculinity fight toxic masculinity. 

Should definitely work. many people use word ""symptom"" refer something notice/consciously experience rather strict definition word. 

The point undetectable without specialized equipment, that's people thinking term ""symptom"", even technically incorrect. live normal life wearing mask. Denying science calling people 'libtards' help me, wearing fucking mask will.

We longer normal society. thought normal longer normal awhile. Find balance. alot people still flying it‚Äôs ‚Äúcheap‚Äù airlines take advantage well don‚Äôt think protests helped much. 100% agree. statement worded poorly. appreciate correction. 
I‚Äôve public times since end February worn mask 100% time went facility. Really scary.

If governments could get message across people, maybe everyone would start wearing masks, conscious behaviour. 99.75% chance wont happen. way all? I'm missing important fact authoritarian government restricts normal movement yes, would way all. infecting possibly tens thousands people letting go merry ways lockdown actually happened probably allow happen.

I'm basing guess probability. Let's say covid R_0 2 event (which likely MUCH higher, like R_3), let's assume maybe 1% 120k attendance it, works 1200. 1200 people would go infect 2400 people, based hypothetical setup. That's 3600 people walking away one singular event. Let's say 1% infected actually mobility around China, that's 36 people.

Even conservative estimates (which likely Order magnitude higher IRL), dozen people walk away leave Wuhan covid. really ""no way""? California seeing huge spike well? see people post Texas Arizona Florida? California even reopen yet. Good. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è would post comment 5 times post? agenda push? Citizens valuing freedom wearing fucking mask

Nope. 

They value freedom. people hate ""freedom"" see someone something like. Burn flag. See react.

They say ""freedom"", value comfortable belligerent. **told** something like toddler emotionally react pouting. That's all. toddlers stomping feet. least vaccine available, us heads straight &amp; able protect anti-maskers. people want exercise personal freedom &amp; risk lives pandemic rages on, won‚Äôt take it. Right now, feels like sitting ducks.....   :( fuckin is. Like legitimate embarrassment shame. Florida reported deaths lag 2 months. deaths reported yesterday occurred April 17th June 25th. Florida count probable deaths. wonder America purposely selling third parties. conspiracy. money involved don‚Äôt doubt trump. Right fifties, developed ailments directly trace back Guillain-Barre paralysis child. Never learned walk quite right, developed knee arthritis early; type things. advice fellow Guillain-Barre patient: please take care yourself! man culture actually called, wrote letter, sent emails office asking keep things closed. moron. citizens protesting say lockdown weeks freedom... Perth Western Australia lockdown months minimal complaints hard boarder anyone WA can't visits states. Yesterday phase 5 started well ontop it... stayed home topped country Nah, arguing people like you. Brain dead morons incapable comprehending. Dying hospital bed alone, struggling every breath take.  Heh. Said guy wants microchip everyone vaccine ü§£ /s Tough say. depends population numbers use. people haven‚Äôt caught yet, using population number undercounts it. likely people it, survived without needing medical intervention, taking 

Pulling numbers : 

We‚Äôve 2,554,470 detected cases US. still in-progress, don‚Äôt know outcome yet. 1,196,541 cases outcome. cases outcome, 1,068,868 recovered 127,673 died.

So it‚Äôs clear there‚Äôs 11% mortality rate people who‚Äôve bad enough response virus seek medical help get tested. antibody testing gets going won‚Äôt know fraction people get virus don‚Äôt need seek medical help. runner husband wears one it‚Äôs perfect. he‚Äôs empty street it‚Äôs around neck, gets within 20 feet someone pulls up. reasonable compromise. Seems like keeping people divided necessary prevent us getting clue, coming together, finally changing system better. think need comparison anyone else us say embarrassing. plain embarrassing. hopeful one, cautious. really want good working vaccine, want safe to, coming quickly question really know long term effects not. Ah, point donate nearly money cause?

You're choosing beggar. Send back country came supported government. country wont support orphans, put sanctions country.

If fails move children us system outside ice. going spend money this, might well count.  people please refrain posting exact thing every day next months. us fucked know, it‚Äôs obvious it‚Äôs getting worse daily record breaking updates annoying hell. ""You're putting faith God's optical system either.""

Why? wrong?

I seriously think lot people dismissed NYC numbers (as well UK's, Italy's, Spain's numbers) something would happen ""those people."" shit's get real flyover country points between. Yep, graphs directly disproved ""more tests equals higher cases"" line POTUS. connect dots us. thought surprisingly decent. Unrealistic CDC plan emergency pandemic. decent!

Covid19: Ok Go jump building seem like perfect asshole.
Blocked. 2nd wave 1st wave. 

Wave top wave. School New Mexico supposed start August 12th. work tried force back 15th despite able work remotely. go back around July 15 wife working whole time well. 

Right schools suggesting sort hybrid schooling rotate buildings either daily weekly basis. idea hell we're going manage work three kids, quite possibly different schedules due different schools go this.  Mine normally mild unless get sick. end sick, usually pneumonia. pectus excavatum (and I'm old fixed, repair child) addition asthma, diminished heart lung capacity. also viral pneumonia child, multiple bouts bacterial pneumonia adult, time lungs get little scarred.

I fine good day. backpack -- fast, long distances, go four five miles enjoy myself. 60% average lung capacity means I'm running marathons take slow uphills I'm hiking, meh, I'll get there.

I bad gut feeling catch covid, survive it, enough damage lungs I'll never able things love, like backpacking, again. 

I get very, angry people take seriously. getting gas today gas station attendants wearing masks none customers masked up. city mandatory mask ordinance.  leadership all. Nope.... That's cause spread. Notice masks protestors wearing. seen spikes protestors. idiots refusing wear masks enclosed areas. least Trump rally there. seen resting face? Looks like saw 8 african american felons gangrape duck lmao Reading study; qualm sample size little small. even admit paper pieces literature single outbreak focusing on. 

Certainly, could true knows. could regional strain virus, maybe genetics children region, maybe anomaly documented.

I want send back millions kids school test validness one study. You: EVERY PROTEStOR WEARS MASKS!!!

Also you: EXCEPT ONES DISAGREE WITH!!! think it'll worse Florida's governor committed nothing. friends NYC peak, least officials trying. friends Florida hunkering know going worse. People spread virus even though may symptoms.


And wear mask? puts many people danger. Depends NYC. live neighborhood literally 1/10 people wear masks, constant sidewalk parties everyday. lot bodegas aren‚Äôt enforcing wearing masks inside. It‚Äôs horrible scared leave apt. yep, hopium Maybe could start ‚Äúnot born‚Äù instead. And? Teachers need sacrifice health &amp; lives? Fuck that. WTF. likely severe under-testing it, espcially rural areas. Almost 10x number people died vietnam. Kind of.

We get point 6,000,000,000 people disease. rate 200,000 per day it'll take 82 years get need be.

This beginning.  least cojones admit past included positive antibody tests new cases, idk still that, do, could also partially explain high number. 6 goddamn fucking months started. hate fucking government, hate stupid fucking state governor fuck this. hate county governor fuck this. hate stupid fucking old idiots that'd rather take time say smart ass shit wearing mask instead of, know, wearing fucking mask. hate stupid fucking company posting signs say mask required shop told us can't refuse service someone wearing one, turn makes sign USELESS.

FUCK BILL LEE. Either giving eye drops listening little bit old Ludwig Van. Woulda, coulda, shoulda

Soon Trump come say, ""I never knew bad"". seen videos middle-aged women nervous goddamned breakdowns ""NEED DISNEY"". sorts people move Florida near park go irritating little niche events get themed pins. mean quantifiable though? fairly easily. good many people protests tested negative.

It's pretty easy understand though, outside vast majority participants wearing masks.

That's frustrating would fairly easy beat thing. everyone would wear masks, keep distance keep clean. 

Unfortunately one party decided politicize make things traitor people cast shunned. change I'm wearing mask outside home? sheer narcissism think happening election year. It‚Äôs almost impressive. Lolwut? Us closed borders chinese aplogizers first? word youre looking 'mass hysteria'. something world seen properly time. buckle crazy train getting going want privatize education. Put paywall education keep poor place control taught. Look sec ed is. goes bad worse people double craziness.

This American Way definition. stubborn, hard headedness made America succeed also enables massive, preventable failures. makes even ridiculous actually protecting others wearing mask. Yyyyep. ): Also San Diegan. work retail amount stupidity deal astounding. sure hope respond again. kind asshole. healthy eating website repute (that *think* originated feature ladies mag used read dumb teenager, like *self* *Seventeen* maybe even *Jane*?) whose claim fame demonstrating substitutions tweaking shave shitton calories (basically ""how smart making healthy choices without hating life"").

And lame ""hungry french fries? look grape!"" type substitutions, like ""This ice cream choice DQ 550 fewer calories SMALLER ice cream choice BR"" type stuff. really educational terms insidious (and unexpected) hidden calories restaurant food - basically never order salad pre-dressed, never put crunchy shit home salad kit, never let fast food places put mayo-based sauces burgers, stop pretending milkshakes coffee, *fuuuuck* muffins.

but hilarious ends promulgating CDC policies situation

**Welcome Costco, love you.** get president dumbass. Trying get family grasp family going kill hardest thing Yes, article specifically uses terms‚Äã COVID-19, coronavirus Wuhan China, sars-cov-19. saying generic coronavirus. people site jerky? US number 1. saw Brazil taking lead yeeted way. much winning. 

/s reason Sweden's strategy incredibly stupid callous human life. mention epidemiologist seems like never took biology 101 classes beyond.  acually retarded think child would cautious. Utahns live south state parks, really. Everyone's north around SLC. USA shutdown right? complete madness. lack leadership everywhere honestly shocking. know president sucks expect better governors. He's going right. need ear? I‚Äôm sure honestly. They‚Äôve calling people back opening additional resorts week. They‚Äôre moving full speed ahead apparent slowdown reopening plans. 4 hours later 45,346....but yes everyone it‚Äôs over. Nothing see go back business üò° bull shit Yeah, whole world got together said ""let's kill bunch people ""hoax virus"" fuck impeached dumpster fire trump.""

""It's ""ploitically"" motivated"" #1 boneheaded thing cultists taking away this. Patrick Star 10x IQ DeSantis. like 2 days ago lol daughters school announced today school like normal hand washing...thats it. changes. know. bad remote learning is, better teachers miss school days time every time come contact someone tested positive, school constantly shut deep cleaning every time someone school tests positive, teach miss month sick ICU, constant worrying bringing virus home, worst all, someone know die thinking might vector.

Remote learning ideal, kids school worse. done friend super easy lets basically set however want bad idea. Ok got medical professionals endorse masks? people would surely come around idea? never left 1st. Bake along eat feelings! good point. really important metrics hospitalization numbers numbers deaths. need get R0 1.

You mean, *You need get R 1*. R0 number preventative measures 100% population immunity. can't change R0 behavior, change R.  think distinction matters much. matter fact there's chance cytokine storms *are not* immune system *mistakenly* overracting *intemtionally* overreacting order kill body prevent host spreading disease members species. 

If watched David Attenborough's documentaries equivalent ants killing spore-infected members colony site carrying body far away nest possible. 

And way recommend googling ""cytokine storm videos"" see looks like action severely bodies might react COVID-19 order prevent spread, saying videos exist. Little late, Texas. Thank that. infinitely interested talking kids hear bullshit 17 months old. scale easily accessible head. someone says 'oh s/hes year half,' far accessible much likely engage conversation. He‚Äôs somehow still smug. He‚Äôs ignorant moron-in-chief. nice around people care others well . SOMEBODY GET MOTHERFUCKING COVID MOTHERFUCKING PLANE ok bill

instead sittin behind mansion wallas dont come rest us help part solution 

ya rich dillhole We‚Äôre number 1!  rates increased age, rate 0.3 persons aged 0‚Äì4 years, 0.1 aged 5‚Äì17 years, 2.5 aged 18‚Äì49 years. rates would inflated still fact US still picking disproportionately severe cases (see US's CFR compared countries higher similar testing rates much smaller outbreaks). And, unlike original supposition, would contain people ""healthy"". happen overall risk relatively low young healthy people. vast majority young, healthy people infected need hospitalisation. ""All work play ..."" Kojima right. really can't handle massive amounts information. internet big fast. scariest part really think conspiracy. think anyone complete control.

I want ride, please. point would order extinguisher China, need wait 6-12 weeks much cheaper. math hard guess area. go store 100% people wearing masks. honestly wonder anything could change peoples minds. bad get!? Lol BLM protesters (and rioters looters) wearing masks. Maybe cherry picked images media wanted see. 

I'm comparing people murdered people wanting go bar. I'm saying large gatherings either ok they're not. media hypocrisy unbelievable Terrifying how? Actual deaths trending zero. Oh poor baby got bad flu survived. San diego here. We've record highs 5 6 last days. Hit 440 today. consistent 120-130 range months. 

It's starting.  think so. internet savvy. going research stuff (I'm Australia). USA absolutely shutdown right?! way humane allow people keep infecting others. Ok, trumpy coping shutdown? 
Or moved COVID now? diminishes fact cases increasing change virus kind seasonality. They're changing entirely human behavior. wasn‚Äôt looting La Mesa San Diego. 

There looting San Diego, handful arrests days including large marches downtown North Park. protests large incredibly peaceful, saying otherwise ignorant.  I'll take yes. wrong. Thanks taking time. live far Benidorm, different world here, understand point. get lot tourists live, crowd Benidorm. zero package holiday here, villa apartment rentals. really, really hard know much we're undercounting either deaths cases worldwide. 

There scientific study March concluding outside US (which much better), 93% cases counted. use metric 93% outside US 85% US, get 123 million infections. purely guess; 93% can't accurate Europe anymore US certainly better 85% now.

Deaths even harder guess undercounts. Simply looking excess mortality says might undercounting 20-40% US bit higher Europe. places really undercounting even excess mortality numbers. might accurate pick lower upper bounds IFR's (0.5% 1% say) use death numbers get wide range 600k-1.2m. looking exact proof statements made published timeline. got good sources this? don‚Äôt want wear mask believe anyone able please comes bodies....including forced wear mask. Try again. cruise ship, every single person tested, probably best representation get changes risk factor massively versus business people in/out generally wearing masks.

Its puzzling many people dont get this. ""I've gone grocery store 20 times havent gotten it, what's bad restaurant?"" FYI, I'm attorney regulatory litigates constitutional issues. valid arguments wearing mask constitutes political speech. People site tend really naive. unfortunate can't understand shutting everything forever really option. Every pic I've seen asian country past 5-6 years always seems least people wearing masks. think started becoming common one SARS outbreaks. Masks part society seems point. "" remember it‚Äôs controlled one corrupt governments time "" says American Trump administraion. argue Trump's crimal negeligance killed tens thousands people probably hundreds thousands end this. Legoland masks SeaWorld enforcing them. Haha remember video various italian mayors basically screaming would come beat shit mom didn‚Äôt comply lockdown. 

It italian still sounded lovely, clear Italy playing telling people stay home. Opened 2 weeks ago counties, expected cases rising 10 days continue state gets serious enforcing requirements especially bars restaurants shut again. even 2 weeks upticks till measures take effect. short fucked next 2 weeks month matter happens. Made up? Lmao. use whatever data source want use. data source 2 deaths 2 non-residents died Florida, showing Florida dashboard tracked behind scenes dig Florida's data.

Here's data source: report using raw data provided FDOH include Florida residents non-residents. March 26, dashboard stopped including non-residents visible counts, they're still tracked behind scenes.

If want use counts non-residents excluded, so. I'll pull FDOH excludes non-residents visible counts. created separate tables each. end day, matter. match closely point stand either way.



Anyways, keep moving goal posts dude. Really bold move goal posts. Cya mid July. Perfect example meant 'that's works'. 200k we've able verify. 

The point response size numbers, though. Sometime last night (Well... night me... live California) crossed 10,000,000 confirmed infections globally. That's number that's easy understand solid, scientific way also hard grasp bigger sense. hard visualize. That's people post photos American football stadiums baseball stadiums. 

The largest stadium world Pyongyang, North Korea. holds seated population 114,000. fill confirmed infected 87 times. insane number. still tiny fraction world's population. No, overkill. LIVE them. absolutely get tested. I‚Äôm afraid going work (California restaurant willing avoids taking proper precaution safety), can‚Äôt afford leave. possible way quit, take temporary leave absence get unemployment? Truthfully, get money unemployment work, point feel like it‚Äôs matter time contract COVID. Customers suck, employer sucks more, government doesn‚Äôt give enough shits protect small economic contribution. Arguing argument sake - awesome.

Beach, parks, amusements parks, river rafting, lake parties, outdoor house parties - awesome don‚Äôt dare take away freedom.
Eating outdoors stop pandemic - it‚Äôs fucking hot rains random. thanks. need experts tell us this. fifth grade stuff. Tell joe rogan. American Airlines aka ‚ÄúTrump Air‚Äù respectable numbers. Welll... damn... saw 415 minutes ago. Felt good sec. Involuntary, premeditated? embarrassment recently surpassed depression me, come think it, depressing. here. I'd consider going desert climate, well heat lot desert states outbreaks. can't win. need open, said.
We can't stay home, said.
They can't trample freedoms, said. 

Exactly, freedoms rights enjoying now? civilized countries govt feeds family able so. I'd say criminal. early days pandemic friend died, fauci, CDC said healthy people wearing mask wouldn‚Äôt necessary.

Maybe right open letter get fired? r/whenthetypomakesitevenfunnier Would doctors recommend students go shopping pandemic? Scientific publications disagree me.

I assume referring article freelance writer PhD ""Developmental Biology"" see identical article published Scientific articles question, post we're going discussion them. 

This article perfect example sexual abnormalities insignificant inconsistencies sexual dimorphism used cloud scientific integrity. generous measurements, one one hundred people ""some form of"" DSD (differences disorders sex development), e.g. nothing necessarily calls biological sex question. considered fringe view scientific community. scientifically sound analyses state likely 1 limited data incidence DSDs; estimated overall incidence DSDs one 5,500

Bilateral renal agenesis, born kidneys, affects one 3,700 people, consider number kidneys naturally occurring human body spectrum. one argues fact, I'll add, made political issue.

Even bad premise, article nothing state scientists already know (and already stated), DSDs slight nuances sexual dimorphism, *do not* affect understanding biological sex binary. Take final argument may building nuanced view sex, society yet catch up. True, half century activism members lesbian, gay, bisexual transgender community softened social attitudes sexual orientation gender. Many societies comfortable men women crossing conventional societal boundaries choice appearance, career sexual partner. comes sex, still intense social pressure conform binary model.  pressure meant people born clear DSDs often undergo surgery 'normalize' genitals. surgery controversial usually performed babies, young consent, risks assigning sex odds child's ultimate gender identity ‚Äî sense gender. Intersex advocacy groups therefore argued doctors parents least wait child old enough communicate gender identity, typically manifests around age three, old enough decide whether want surgery all.

The point article general public ignorant amount¬†and type rare abnormalities sexual dimorphism, causes doctors individuals DSDs feel pressure ""correct"" necessarily need corrected. agree opinion, political opinion¬†and nothing more. valid evidence article Biologists consider sex spectrum, don't.

The assertion title article obviously clickbait. Let's take look Redefined: Idea 2 Sexes Overly Simplistic  think larger spectrum binary female male

Nowhere article evidence support apparent claim that

a) concept nuances biological sex anything new (they're not) significant determining definition biological sex (they're not)

b) Biologists redefined biological sex (they haven't, there's simply evidence it)

c) Biologists *now* think anything different (they've known evidence article decades) 

d) Biologists think larger spectrum female male (they don't. recognize birth defects insignificant nuances bio sex, decades. change scientific taxonomy human sex either male female).

Furthermore, writer article, Claire Ainsworth, PhD Developmental Biology, closer philosophy biology, considered ""contemporary experimental biology"" Stanford quick look Ainsworth's Twitter feed shows much politically top three posts black representation sciences facial recognition technology leading false imprisonment black man. also reducing total sick load public, decreases chances individual getting first place. could ride disappeared, would good, never get idiots. definitely become global, seasonal issue USA.

&amp;#x200B;

USA! USA! Almost already dealt SARS before. 

They learned last time. 

This lesson. RIGHTS! people going realize that?

Honestly, I'm joking, opinion, rights!

Think like this:

* you, right firearm? **Yes**
* you, right carry firearm person? **Yes**
* you, right use firearm protect yourself, property, safety/property others? **Yes**
* you, right walk street firing firearm random directions? **NO**

Honestly, hard. Morality intrinsically based upon whether individual's actions removing consent another thus, one imposing upon another way suppresses tyrannical use force threat thereof.

You right remove consent around health. legal smoke cigarettes privacy home, illegal smoke cigarettes public places. rights body health, jeopardy body health another. use law (force) restricts acting manner jeopardizes health another force used SELF DEFENSE--I.E: never morally ambiguous use force protect tyranny another set strip consent. cannot consent inflicting harm upon another, so, are, actings, knowingly stripping consent another wish health jeopardized.

I understand people talking believe defending freedom. people taken conspiracy theorizing levels believe all, least fundamental level, form method control, goal stripping freedoms away; look, not.

You wear mask private. wear mask home, home sharing space agreed not. Hell, enter somebody's home want wear mask, every right world go person's home! EVEN go public place requires mask, every right refuse go place want wear mask! Nobody using force make sure go places wear mask, EVERY right share public places! Nobody infringing upon rights mandating safety measures. forced wear mask identical forced smoke cigarettes public. enter public building choice, light cigarette, asked security/law enforcement, assuredly within seconds, either put leave premises--refusal absolutely met either removal premises, arrest.

There many ways corollaries created match scenario spiritually nearly identical overarching idea: Imagine driving automobile. right one, drive one, park one--to sorts things, right drive right side road oncoming traffic? right drive intoxicated? laws restricting actions road reduce freedom? NO. reduce freedom implication true freedom freedom paramount freedom another.

Freedom something posses, conflicting wills, freedom mane stay people, must conditions MAN infringed upon given action would lead direct physical harm, threat thereof.

This whole mask thing sheer stupidity. EVEN believe Covid-19 threat, arguing wrong thing here--the argument free risk health around actings--the argument whether Covid-19 actually dangerous.

If want argument, it, cannot argument time, argument dangerous SARS-CoV-2 is, whether believe freedoms infringed upon required law, wear mask.

Remember one making assertion holds burden proof. assertion CoV-2 dangerous, prove beyond reasonable doubt, happened. everyone else comments complaining this:

Get one masks little piece metal bridge nose. squish fit nose glasses stop fogging up. Almost 10,000 new cases reported today... Apart truly essential things, like working hcw exactly I'm gonna do. 
Have fun re-enacting Bergamo/Wuhan/Madrid/NY again. vote check Facebook posts comments. It‚Äôs false tho it‚Äôs literally time line projected hahah Culturally, Japan communal, masks worn people sick long time (pre COVID) protect others getting sick. generally compliant mask wearing due history politicized issue. Americans exact opposite, rugged individualism part DNA, people feel right want, many want government lives. Add US leadership cohesive message focusing facts data, leadership made masks partisan issue (and served good examples people), leaning individualism. gone far people tested positive, refusing cooperate contract tracing. Citizens US refusing participate good entire society. individualism way. 

All gets us here, continue much longer could have. extended tinfoil hat wearing Bill Gates hating anti-vaxx crowd gets involved vaccine finally available, people die needlessly participating.

As safety issue, lets take Oxford vaccine. based previously developed MERS vaccine phase trials (safety) conducted last year. Also vector used chimpanzee adenovirus vector inability multiply within humans. Adenovirus vectors vaccines previously used approved Ebola. 

And yes vaccines fail. fail pre-clinical phase stages. better odds success stages displayed immune responses. case Oxford one read papers pre clinical studies involving rhesus macaques, pigs mice. looked promising good immune response profile.

Fuck off, hypocrite. I'm going stand things want vote politicians going violate first, second, fourth amendments. 

If want peace friendship, extend hand first instead childishly demanding others give rights personally feel comfortable. US Businesses Gov: ""LOL Oops! Sorry got sick, late anything 3 million cases! better get back work cuz ain't getting anymore checks!"" like Italy. need brace kind images seeing Arizona. People gonna get scared now. gonna shut big fucking time. think that's really comes to. One side saying bad, side says worst thing ever. look numbers, % small consider whole population, numbers recoveries vs deaths. 

The recent protesting help covid situation, suddenly virus forgotten died we're back covid something serious. remember people reddit claiming everything overblown ICU beds filling up, thus coronavirus bad Florida people could go back beaches theme parks.

Well now. ‚ÄúYeah guys let‚Äôs stop worrying rights let‚Äôs see help country‚Äù-Russia, WW2 Thank protest lovely guys This!

American going surgery: 
Hey Doc, need mask....Do surgery without one....We cool Texas post relevant, extremely political. bot nerds booger off. Exactly. Also, I'd like know names doctors who'd recommend wearing mask pandemic protect lungs. live Harris county well. work restaurant tell u people care guidelines all. boss said suppose tell people masks social distancing don‚Äôt comply say ok let sit wherever want. yeah unless shut ordered Texas screwed Ugh don‚Äôt get started. Spent two days Vegas take care important life docs amount people wearing masks crowded environments astonishing. soon got jetbridge asshole ripped mask yelled, ‚Äúwear masks sheeple!‚Äù Top 5 IRL cringe me. Luckily state Nevada instituted mandatory order it‚Äôs annoying even come that. town near plan July 4th parade. paper, looks fine - longer parade route fewer participants usual, throwing candy such, family groups attendees least six feet apart preferably more, etc. theory, riskier sitting front porch watching cars go by.

Problem is, town people wearing masks distancing, seem think media hoax, etc., parade general brings lot out-of-towners generally affinity ""masks losers, get hysteria"" politicians.

The honor system fine people involved honorable, sadly. $$$

Orange County residents dead set paying healthcare services.

A years back (though hurricane Harvey), vote raise taxes try get hospital partner come area. vote 80-20, ""HELL NO, RAISE TAXES"". town hall discussion forums opinions of, ""if heart attack, time go... well, I'm ok that.""

Add baptist hospital fully closed years, easy turning lights back get speed. Source? outliers please.

Oh yeah can't. Many many people recover good again, make like virus worst thing ever. 

We simply can't know yet also please say like fact. Make Ohio pay it! people put Millenial headline harvest clicks. Personally, taking seriously boomer mom, denialist.

Hang there. It‚Äôs worth it. students doctors notes saying cant wear mask. exist rare arent given willy nilly. said, way one people shed wallet times really comes to.

It‚Äôs almost Vince McMahon greedy piece shit values profit Emperor said so, Emperor cannot wrong. Millennials currently aged 25‚Äì40, reference. Deaths super low, 1 yesterday. Hospitals aren‚Äôt overwhelmed. Major cities requiring masks, hopefully helps. 

I know 3 people went test last Sunday, still haven‚Äôt received results. backlog unreal, numbers see today probably tests week ago. Probably sold highest bidders Yeah I‚Äôve least 4 protests far NYC barely seen anyone without mask protesting. Also, plenty protesters handing PPE. Stop pushing false narrative. Even somebody went bat her, money belongs barista, person set page GoFundMe, it? surprised. Tell don‚Äôt microchip him. voluntarily phone carries around. uses social media form ‚Äúthey‚Äù already know knows himself. smart phone, smart tv, Alexa, ring doorbell analytical treasure trove. still can't say why........because would make look terrible. mean wasn‚Äôt made scratch? yet six months later: ""I truly concerned him"" referring bin laden. bombed Tora Bora gave up. 

Bush bad Trump, mental DNA less, deflect blame, diminish press take responsibility screw ups. idiots ""MaSkS cAuSe OxYgEn DeFiCiEnCy!!!"" Yeah? really stupid twats? professions require even stringent PPE freaking cotton mask? used wear p100 respirator upwards 10 hours day painted cars daily years. put bandana go whole foods assholes. Jesus. Yes, look data. Places tons protestors, like Chicago, seen masks re-opened soon, ahead CDC guidance, seeing huge increases.

The deciding factor protests happened everywhere. I've using curbside groceries Kroger. get strange substitutes sometimes, last month got potatoes already going rotten, sacrifice that's worth it.

I tried going Sertinos, last week, used regular place me. None employees masked food prep. person making coffee wearing gloves either. owner, I've known years, actually making fun wearing mask.

I tried, thanks way people treating stay holed lot longer.

As teacher, I'll forced August, back public life. doubt things much better then.

I heart defect discovered couple years ago. Based type defect is, manageable many years decades. get symptomatic case Covid I'm probably done. ain't Jack shit living community. Everyone dead set spreading disease. strange way put it, chance might passed 10 million before! Straight karen-esque screed town hall meetings. Yes, exactly. punish restaurant owners though. Clearly give fuck willing make comment like that. childish mindset simply respond going ""lol u angry"" instead argument itself. expected people claim served 30 years military even bother basic google search see even entails.

Have good one, teenager! constantly begging family get rid platform owned Zuck. deaf ears, even though admit lost social media past. Maybe one day.

My hope places like Facebook become cesspools extremists majority public since moved new forms interaction. Trump would NEVER try that. Individual states could, set National Guard pseudo-borders along interstate highways. Trouble is, I'm sure many much smaller roads could taken, right? no? I'm sure, American. commenting thread 10+ times: ‚Äúbro really don‚Äôt care‚Äù
ü§£ Literally every single one like tests without failure free either

I'm often stunned people bring costs crisis. cost testing miniscule compared avoidable $3 trillion bailout shutdown. wait it, next shutdowns coming. mean can't force people go get tested

The 80 percent solution simply making easy. Heck, that's 99 percent solution. Masks already semi-commonplace, much jump ""seeing people wearing masks every day"" ""everyone wearing masks every day"" I‚Äôm government leader. I‚Äôm own.

Also, wasn‚Äôt talking them, responded comment Floridians ‚Äúweak.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt wish upon others harmful measures, ever, don‚Äôt think could live responsible cause another person‚Äôs death. choose life, I‚Äôm wearing mask. It‚Äôs incredible. Things bad enough without lie. need get better letting stuff go getting debates haha Pretty sure Biden together enough listen experts.

Well, still opposes GND apparently not.

His campaign profile picture Reddit wearing mask incorrectly.

He wandered set first town hall forgetting supposed doing.

Even Politico joking dementia campaign. Bully you? LMAO Seems u/Cfrules8 already got number. I'm Canadian I'm hoping someone explain bit - supposed $600 top unemployment? Put glasses nose brim, works. Even though look like grandma reading book don‚Äôt ‚Äúcommunities‚Äù Arizona per say I'm bit exhausted arguing reddit moment thread 10+ really don‚Äôt care‚Äù thought, maybe people Texas need ""don't mess Texas"" printed masks, see really are... armor. Hispanics seem willing host big parties even lockdown.

San Diego here, confirm.

A children's birthday party neighborhood often bring 40+ people small residence. think they're family, they're safe.

This [family transmitted virus 18 birthday party, despite warnings family members doctors (and attend party). completely ignored advice family, ""just couple hours"". husband I, millennials, went brewery firs time. great set social distancing (it's farm) employees taking super seriously. Signs everywhere, 100% mask usage. 


Guess demographic wearing masks nose, crowding bar, getting yelled management? Majority SEC schools said football going forward matter what. 

There much money stake. I‚Äôm South Carolina, USC said expect lose $138 million year, includes football money. don‚Äôt income looks lot worse. 

Clemson appears letting players get recover. Probably good strategy, since mostly immune season starts. think 40 players tested positive it. Cases COVID-19, disease caused coronavirus, tend milder young adults elderly, disease isn‚Äôt without risk. 13,496 adults 30 tested positive Tuesday, 542 4% hospitalized 11 died, according state data.

That's part really eye-opening - 

I found article know Georgia bit mystery - first open back yet spike like Texas, Florida, dozen places. Looks like luck might starting run out. Nonsense 

Racism state less anywhere. media...

The internet awful, sure..

Cable news makes dumber, that's fact.

But still journalists job. Local papers, public media, primary sources like AP. 

The problem really people consume even consider balanced media diet. They're stuck feedback loop, unable change. Part thinks that's getting older... politicians celebrating 4th Russia anyway. know made comment defending protests, condemning parties. Yet, concede protests easily spread virus spite lower risk. invalidates reasoning behind comment. 

Let's say already understood difference risk spread: mention spread comment? know trying defend protests.

You seem care actually spreads virus more. Genuine question, I'm trying blindly defend here, really bad case? totally understand problem stuff like ""real men cry"" ""real men drive trucks"" stupid stuff like that, case seems like saying ""real men care well others wear mask"". definitely see problem saying talking ""traditional man stuff"", really see bad used try break stereotypes. Like see anything wrong used ""real mean afraid cry"" ""real men drive want without prove anything"". 
 
Do still see kinds things problematic, missing something? home 10pm really solve? Late night parties peoples homes weekends maybe? Total half measure. I‚Äòm low key suspicious Trump‚Äòs plan along... let pandemic roll US unabated, high death toll all... without curve flattened theoretically come pandemic faster. perhaps November pandemic US, majority Americans shortsighted enough remember point forget massive death toll... D: fucking bad. hired someone competent. non apology isn‚Äôt accepted. You‚Äôre personally responsible least hundreds unnecessary American deaths. hope he‚Äôs fake Christian rest special spot Hell territory can't wait tomorrow's numbers. wonder number get anti-maskers decide quarantine might good idea?

Dodging bullet doesnt make bulletproof bullets still flying. yes Italy able prevent South following North dramatic proof concept controlled proper coordination across population. 

I wonder Italy ‚Äúin blood‚Äù speak, given rome rocked every single major plague since forever (hell dven word quarantine comes Italy). havd repeated selection pressure culturally biologically complying quarantine. Wait week look numbers. following world news live threads back march would see exact comment every day, day two later weekend numbers would higher. one forced work restaurant. Dont worry, Gov MeeMaw come TV next week scold tell ""Our cases risin' becawse y'all followin' guidelines. Y'all need responsible."" Florida Jan 2018 scraped ice car one morning. also June 2018 summer temps much different. 91f today house. Florida winter temps hotter Spain though generally, we're talking building hospitals now. think generally Sunday Monday numbers, technically Saturday Sunday's results. demographic goes cruise ships though. @Thomase1984 wear glasses too, tip might help you.

I don‚Äôt wish upon others harmful measures, ever, don‚Äôt think could live responsible cause another person‚Äôs death. choose life, I‚Äôm wearing mask. according great poet DJ Khaled - ‚ÄúAnother one‚Äù ""You got know hold 'em, know fold 'em,
Know walk away know run."".. shit. means literally nothing lol. I'm sorry I'm buying it. I've seen videos protests looting yes people wearing masks looks like 70% most. Saying massive protests street spread virus mean support protesting. subtlely anymore. Everyone extreme one side other. fully support protests probably spread virus around. nothing wrong saying that. Came say that. would make sense meant current cases never thought generational terms, before, makes lot sense. first generation grow computers home, definitely grew information processing management necessary skill. Much older people never learn know manage filter much information. Read fucking article retard, AstraZeneca making Oxfords vaccine. think elections sane precondition establishing legitimate authority swamp land Arizona sale.

He's right people wear mask, though. Universal, Sea World, Legoland, Busch Gardens currently open (as well number one offs, like Gatorland) - Disney's currently handling best waiting July. far know they'll mask-enforcers (wear correctly get kicked - Universal already), well limited capacity required reservations get in, likely safest place FL outside home. went ER said O2 normal,at 99%, therefore categorized low priority. like heat rain, stay home. like STDs.

The thing antibodies last 3 months. herd immunity hard unless happens suddenly. vaccines, require boosters every 3 4 months. need accept lockdowns masks us rest lives.

If much, consider alternative means individual life/death plans. Posted elsewhere, want drive point home shitty FL leadership citizenry dirty systematically misleading public:

""When went show report card would say county, among things, asked delete report card showed counties, pretty much, ready reopening,"" says. ""And want draw attention that.""

""To me, read like kind political conspiracy higher directive,"" Jones says. ""It seemed like people expected brought results, results support plan written, not, seemed panicked, like figure way make results match plan.""

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

She says state's dashboard, person tests positive counted positive test once, matter many times test positive. person tests negative counted time test negative coronavirus. Jones says many residents, health care workers, require repeated testing, state's dashboard artificially deflating true positivity rate. ""They're adding total test figures instead total people, makes percent positive extremely low,"" bf works Amazon warehouse wears surgical mask double layer cloth mask goggles. People suck. concerned, stay home.

We can't, things reopen, lose unemployment go work homelessness decent option. K

May ask state? Yes Again, look FDA list approved tests.
Plenty 99.5-100% specificity range.
And counted 9 tests ""PPV prevalence = 5%"" 96% more. Thats probably far risky beach. current rise fueled young people gathering partying anything else. Still, makes sense limit public 4th July gatherings. know suggested would feel wearing masks? banded together wore masks awhile like China might able slow thing little. always going way. long term immunity, forever. live like die virus something else. must start pressuring governments fund expand euthanasia programs citizens, regardless age health.

The actual case load increase higher 41,407, question much higher. 2 possible reasons. 1. treatment improved 2. ""actual cases"" compared ""tested cases"" lot higher back due lack testings. hope mostly number 1. Tell thousands idiots protesting dems / media pushing narrative. month late huge spike comes omg Trump fault! yeah lets ignore every major city riots.. knew masks worked last November three kids got sick(just colds) terrified going chemo. wearing mask, kids wore masks outside rooms, Lysoled common surfaces twice day. never got sick. month. worked. never go anywhere without mask, stay away crowded places Covid hotspots.  gotten sick yet. one family gotten Covid. we'll keep wearing masks nightmare over.

From article:

""Let‚Äôs look first infection lymphocytes, white blood cells. authors report provide evidence SARS-CoV-2 infect certain white blood cells laboratory setting. also noted MERS-CoV, virus closely related SARS-CoV-2, infect cells. Importantly, however, noted neither MERS-CoV SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated ability replicate cells. appears viruses enter cells, infection abortive. HIV, contrast, replicates aggressively white blood cells, infected cells spewing thousands new viral particles.

What observed lymphopenia? study individuals died COVID-19, researchers noted amount lymphocytes blood decreased steadily course disease. contrast, standard blood markers, like red blood cell counts, remained fairly constant. observation mean infection SARS-CoV-2 leads immunosuppression, like HIV? necessarily. authors note several[1]¬† factors could lead lymphopenia. Instead, emphasized monitoring lymphocyte levels people COVID-19 may effective easy way clinicians predict disease severity.""

So even close HIV cells immune system  Pandemic Scorpion says: ""Stay there!"" Oh man, start? EVEN FRIGGING START?

Just last xmas laughed, dreamed together, wonderful plans life, happy... We... ""we"". I'm alone now, couple months everything changed, feel lost, drifting away strange world.

We even planned adopt child since one several miscarriages.

So, that's history. you? That's point making. getting article lead people think 50% cases give neurological issues know, probably right. we're working. Something change, I'm trying think things within financial power could help area. whole question freedom is....addressed differently different people.  force narrative ""freedom context harm others""  versus ""there's others us, asshole!!"". in.....yeah, could send trash space cheap, then....go ahead liter depths void, but.....you shouldnt freedom to, say, dump heavy metal-laden waste material, over-hunt endagered species, smoke indoor public spaces, go around grabbing ...their special areas.  So, yeah, right wear masks....in depths nature, home....but really, think freedom go market, wear it?!?!?  

Just context, cause often lose sight, here's list freedoms usually complain give up:

*  Stopping red light, crowded intersection major city, cars coming directions.
* Driving right side road, on-coming traffic
* pooping indoor, anywhere TOILET
* throwing grenades people
* stealing, murder,graft
* Playing super loud music, late night/early morning, close proximity residents likely sleeping

Just illustrate, generally accept social creatures, like spent time around others, get, perhaps always consciously, compromising well-being comfort others.  Masks arent liberal attempt allowing riots anonymous, step towards making people accept orders government. Masks are......proven easy way LIMIT LESSEN spread PANDEMIC, one comparable Sanish flu, exceeding everything since, except AIDS, way deadly also way less communicative (communicable?) new studies saying still immune T-Cell memory?

That‚Äôs CFR .08%. n bomb going get worse unless quell influence NOW. never happen 14 days isolation, symptoms üò¨ borderline. It‚Äôs literally doublethink. Oh Christ, whether true not, fuel certain people  Living Earth singular experience. activities carry greater risks others. That's we, society, placed restrictions activities carry greater risk injury oneself others. example, speed limits, required safety equipment checks automobiles vehicles, etc.

Living pandemic brings health risks normal simple daily living, greater usual care needs taken prevent spread disease. critical thought doesnt mean indulging clear dangerous falsehoods people known incentivized make guise ""well, right?""

There arent always two equal sides issue, matter much people given platforms. Well desantis.. thankfully would close continue open generally impact education.

Theres one day delay least infect others. 

That doesnt make sense. new. added wear anything else people would pissed same. ""You must wear tie entering building"" would cause amount bitching.

I personally think mask stupid also want able work groceries comply.  USA. We‚Äôre masked building, chronic allergies I‚Äôm always coughing while. one coolest thing's I've heard today! enjoy file NY, offer option take federal state taxes payments. 150% signed option hopes paying less April, cause job (live events) likely back year. also morons read news got ejected car cause wearing seatbelt. I'd usually chalk darwinism care except scenario , flying bodies land us. conservative protests ""re opening"" leads covid infections deaths Liberty something that's ""given"" ""behave"" well enough.

Liberty non-negotiable. We're getting crap UK - ""5G spreads Coronavirus."" fact 5G hardly got started areas seem register. yet. come light has.

Watch Belarus Portugal, we're coming up! /s added, ‚ÄúThere one person infected party wearing mask. worn mask wouldn‚Äôt happened.‚Äù

No shit. Restaurants bleeding money offering take out. every restaurant feasibly outdoor dining. since livelihood line, care. growth exponential. mathematical meaning ""exponential growth"" pandemic produces new cases every day (or week month) percentage day. Meaning doubling rate stays constant. agree India fits pattern everywhere else, says pandemic general cause exponential growth first week two. slows down, continues slow down. Takes long time absolute numbers new cases start declining, growth rates start decline early.

Assuming testing rates keep increasing (and admit know India) minister telling truth (big assumption) outbreak hitting peak soon places driving numbers. big county, outbreaks shift elsewhere, U.S., driving new surges. that's different story. That's they're raised days. Bullies *run* teacher pointing finger victim claiming victim bully. Unfortunately, ""adults"" dumb enough go it, bully wins again. they're working world.   posted impassioned message Facebook lamenting previously ignoring social distancing mask-wearing recommendations expressed guilt exposing family.   stupidity put mom sisters‚Äô family‚Äôs health jeopardy. painful experience,‚Äù wrote.

Pretty consistent. tested blood donors antibodies week ago 5.0% antibodies. far over.
And consider death survival. lot surviving left life long complications. 
This virus definitely stay away from! data would like?

you use basic logic, experts condemned tried blame second wave 400 conservitves protesting 500k blmers protesting :ok: pretty funny, bunch 70+ year olds travelling across border go shopping Sweden, quarantined anyway Norway, sit quarantine returning Sweden matter them.

Since people mainly want protect, happening, know something messed border thing handled. demanding guns next. mistake forgot buy bullshit ""Freedom Breathe Agency"" card thing currently spread around could flash laminated bullshit instead saying it.

If something definitely want defend guest. Idk COVID, city appears aid police finding/charging people allegedly possessing drugs.. Younger people rarely die covid. Tremendous even. Lol ok bud. mean demonstrably worth similar properties away beaches. Seeing positivity rates rising across states scary... Shows states need testing capacity right violated? always look new line work feel safer. could wrong, videos cops killing defenseless black people surfacing steadily while. suppose we'll never chance replay history without virus see people would demonstrated even locked and/or unemployed time. suppose fact fewer things focus general could factor well. Uhhh saying 57% covid deaths aren‚Äôt linked nursing homes doesn‚Äôt make seem problematic younger people. im sorry say yes, OVERWHELMING number deaths elderly people. It‚Äôs is. extend it. Democrats vote it‚Äôs right thing do. Republicans can‚Äôt economic crisis heading presidential election. Last time happened deal black president 8 years wasn‚Äôt narrative literally killing grandmothers outside. fact congregating exercising right protest considered idiotic. blm it‚Äôs suddenly ‚Äúsocial function‚Äù admit hypocrisy? *Arizona entered chat* things tried?

Your comment wasn‚Äôt removed?? Well sure looks removed me. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something... Common sense says both. Obviously indoors close proximity others spreads most. protests Hollywood,CA people packed Hollywood Blvd. everyone wearing masks. think people got there? Public transport carpooling others.

I know four people went protest. covid. wear mask surprise woman? TJs pretty big consistency store store, least experience. store go (and morning) line outside six foot spaces marked people waiting get in, limiting number people inside one time. standing there, BIG, unmissable signs saying masks required, there's also always someone working line, making sure people know expect get inside, terms maintaining distance cashier, bagging groceries outside want use bags, fact aisles one way only, yes, masks required. 

My guess surprise ... wanted confrontation excuse throw fit. covid deaths matter? Odd would occur - I'd think judge must see people acting selfishly daily almost daily basis. Fuck goddamn protestors. guys make really glad smoke weed fair. Boy howdy gonna something. Something like 57 million people die year, precorona don‚Äôt think people paying attention sheer amount people die day regularly. aren‚Äôt constantly reminded ticker.

Canada closed notice.

Dear Canadians,

The USA closed notice. Lmao can't tell trolling not. Lmao read study you, champ? didnt even get past article headline bet. literally said protests certainly lead spike cases among attendees, offset roughly ""net neutral"" effect increased social distancing people participating protests. attributes increased non-protestor social distancing people afraid leave homes protests causing destruction chaos. 

Its genuinely baffling willfully ignorant people maintain belief system. Set study aside- beat head ""social distancing stops spread"" every day last 4 months what? virus somehow magically doesnt spread 1000s people standing shoulder shoulder screaming chanting? virus pro BLM something? mean jesus wrong people? sure hope comes IKEA style instructions disclaimer using wipe bottom. china? think mean people think bad see themselves. aunt Florida posting daily pics 80 year old husband going packed bars taking selfies friends touching faces. masks. says 'Don't afraid live! Ditch mask.' Yah ok lady, even going sad pity party posts she'll spam man gets it. Governor Ron DeathSentence plan people Florida executing it.

Between representatives refusing acknowledge problem, fact becoming apparent pretty quick opening without strict regulations gonna work. worth noting seen small children, even absolute necessarily (some cases kids transmitting seem exist). really comforting opening full school systems.

This study seems looking 3 confirmed cases? Hardly enough draw conclusions, unclear blurb symptomatic. also know asymptomatic individuals less likely spread, that's reasonable since sneezing/coughing many droplets. mean *can't* spread necessarily. really don‚Äôt understand gatherings didn‚Äôt cause peak areas. honestly confuses me. shouldn‚Äôt nba season either is. brain stuff? There's brain stuff? :/ little ironic seeing modern ‚Äúsatanists‚Äù personal responsiblity. Agreed. Collin County it, 15 minutes downtown without traffic. quite insane restrictions per county. Deeper research needed. that‚Äôs things continue stay bad wanted say someone living AZ, heartbroken NY, NJ, MI. We're awful people here, though large amount people seem think they're invincible/it's hoax (as evidenced huge surge cases). I'm sorry people acted like you, cool all.

We've pushing reopen everything quickly daily numbers, well hospitalizations keep increasing. madness many people pushing go back fully open quickly. ""But muh fReeDomS!"" could counter source. said ""tons people"" (whatever measures) maybe source opinion? Americans, seriously, what's going on? education system that's pushed critical thinking skills science? America used nation advancement progress. happened there? Sounds like level headed sheriff. Eight days hospital? Glad recovering. Hope suffer long term effects, excellent health insurance cover stay. bill probably enormous. I'm fatass eat one daily? oppression costco! Even wearing masks protesting, certain behaviors cops made spread likely. Tear gas pepper spraying protesters caused coughing removal masks. Arresting people way ""curfew violations"" putting lots people buses close quarters long periods forced lack social distancing way wash/hand sanitize. forget US second amendment for? 2 weeks sun ribs would virus-free! There's much hope invested vaccine really hope wash out. Go ahead we‚Äôll start citizens arrests. ‚Äúis Pluto planet‚Äù semantic definition argument again. Actual biological science isn‚Äôt debated it‚Äôs labels people use different concepts.  mention many people covid either don‚Äôt realize and/or didn‚Äôt get tested they‚Äôre going to. Imagine medical bills hospitalization Covid family member got sick. 
It‚Äôs pure stupidity. One solid reason scientific data says anything stop virus way. Youre still going potentially spread virus get virus mask on. dont put flimsy mask cant even bothered wear correctly anyways sudden safe environment. theyre made viruses stopping microscopic transmission. Masks nothing face coverings nothing assinine fashion trend. Ill wait link accredited health organization shows scientific data masks prevent virus spreading. virus itself, can't blame media that. we, country, start taking seriously, economy continue suffer unfortunate mental deficiency maybe suits better. hell cares idiot say? real dangerous situation. said things listed taken place within United States one point another Weird talking texas, bring poor countries instead.

Getting infected coronavirus not. read things include phrase ""you've never heard of"" headline. scientist however, offer information regarding don‚Äôt SARS vaccine. It‚Äôs mostly disease died didn‚Äôt enough virus going around test vaccine.

Yes no. disease died means pressure pursue one therefore funding died out.

But factually wrong say reason vaccine enough virus went away own.

We several promising vaccine candidates ultimately failed. point I'm making. 

I think impossible develop vaccine. I'm saying ""in development"" thing someone's Tesla ""in development.""

We know make Teslas. successfully done many times.

We never vaccinated virus. Developing vaccine still fail ways Tesla's manufacturing line won't.

A lot go wrong vaccine development expecting candidates hit home run December fairy tale. Sometimes fairy tale story lines happen real life bet fucking house They‚Äôve managed speed phase phase II trials established safety.

*As vaccines, scientist...* see look trial success rates conclude anything meaningful. vaccines die later trials.

And no, scientist, cannot say abridged second trial sufficient. fully reject that. window test ensure maximum dose amount safe populations preexisting conditions we've less six months months observation here. That's red tape. That's lives risk factors.

You know, people, label uses medications deemed safe later recalled long term observations fucking matter. matter less way big pharma companies like AstraZeneca would singing millions dollars worth deals manufacturers around world ramping supply chains, scaling production stockpiling doses even studies complete didn‚Äôt iota faith developed

Yeah. would. Especially governments pre-ordering they've entered sole source agreements offer immunity guaranteed bailout. COVID killed 42 times amount people died 9/11 Texans voted Abbott systematic voter suppression... Well, are. Yes yesterday paraded Berlin newspaper like hottest recent shit.

So yeah country basically built upon obsessed rights, what's good collective...then rights little wearing mask even bring sort ""right wear one"" middle deadly pandemic bad faith argument. üéâ üéä ""solution"" let people die?

I work restaurant two bars opened either them. service bars only. can't trust clientele practice social distancing. We‚Äôre also see 500K deaths today :/ drive? Yes. risk kill somebody even driving speed limit? Yes. Get car selfish bastard.

-someone work Seriously knew pinky brain retired. thanks, well here. I've enjoying total freedom here, coronavirus free. awesome. Lightheaded?

CO2 kills. I've already told you. can't understand that?

But, go ahead, argue dioxide poisoning: literature review often forgotten cause intoxication emergency conducted 1980s showed 89 deaths per year USA alone, work confined spaces; 22% occur rescue efforts [4]. number decreased since. recent study Occupational Safety Health Administration (OSHA) 2015 still estimated number deaths involving confined spaces around 90 per year. Unfortunately, number killed rescuers risen two thirds deaths levels CO2 decrease blood pH throws CO2 bicarbonate ion ratio. sever cases hypercapnia (partial pressure CO2 75 mmHg) one would progressively experience disorientation, panic, hyperventilation, convulsions, unconsciousness, finally studies came out, found effect protests. Places bigger protests see larger increase (cant remember ones)

Makes sense: outdoors, lot masks. transmission there, sure, protests also caused many people stay home bigger effect. Dusting combat boots. meet? president vocal too. Even went far convene voter fraud commission drew report template assumed happened instead making objective conclusion. like asian countries, one densily populated. Well everyone responsible parents fuck needs esthetician. loser dipshit reddit flaming commenting reddit. bullshit probably responsible world's greenhouse gases. Yes, know air conditioning spreads virus. Math checks out. 325M * .6 = 195M. 195M/500k = 395 trust people misinform protect supply chain? wonder he's complained BJJ centers closed. lot families separated borders due bad immigration laws. wife allowed come USA country requires us married seven years become citizen there.

We live opposite sides planet, need travel via air visit her. True Well that‚Äôs plainly wrong bad judging based feel rule law

Fuck Super world spreader hotspot. probably be. Thanks encouragement  Fake ass Christians / Mormons. North East fine fine.

Fuck bible thumping hypocrites. don‚Äôt give damn anyone themselves. However, judging obesity rates south, hardly even care bodies. shocker want get convid die. continue people wear masks! Unfortunately idiots screw minimum wage workers come contact shops petrol station etc mean. Dutch dont Tiananmen Square part history. Employee partys dont either ""I got BJ covid patient last night. glory hole still better safe."" Also people getting money feel get also.

I pay taxes contribute nation's economy infrastructure. got check. Listen Im wearing makes ""when become focused rights fellow men women"" sounds like 1984 shit  tried engaging people comments Facebook post. complete lunatics. lets infect greater good, what? Like italy. Uh huh, sure thing, totally believe right control others wife served 30 years piece, General. I'm wrong.

I repeatedly explained hold belief experts not. Meanwhile, Australia: FREE test clinics everywhere - even small town 5, 000 sign main street advertising it. go FREE hospital get FREE test. new cases increasing day globally. Scary developments... scientists knew masks work March. said otherwise preserve supply chain. gap understanding.

Just someone said something wrong past mean saying something wrong now. serious pandemic spreading rumours anecdotes without evidence harm good. can't base science decision making anecdotes  MPR NPR, FYI. public radio same. live DFW Texas (Dallas) see 70% people actually wearing masks. rest guess care. wonder state seeing spike cases. Give break, re-learned 40th time asymptomatic cases spread disease /s Yeah, number employees. Guys think thing might serious STOP PROTESTS. Wish best. ....and videos f Karens Kyles throwing temper tantrum begin in....3....2....1.... NYC well downward trend cases protests happened. cities not. pic protests Houston, see what's happened last couple weeks.  America without job. currently 60 million going infected. die hospitals million dead virus alone. including people die able get treated regular medical needs.

Hahaha doomer sub never fails entertain me. see massive spike suicides.

There already massive spike suicide attempts lockdowns, problem right? given 20% effective vaccine I'd still waiting effective one unnecessary contact others. would mean might well it. 


It would probably worth choice interacting others, without reducing steps they're taking. Princess pea. certainly see discomfort wearing saturated mask long periods time physically active, lung function truly compromised. able bodied adult wearing one strolling sitting?? purely psychological reaction. Spend 5 minutes trying breathe soda straw ( still teacup ride compared mild asthma), try wearing cloth mask comparison. always this.

And point, incompetence. plan.

And believe incompetence want so. bet people said stuff back then. This. governor worked hard tie hands county officials.  people would immediately take mask dirty hands put face... used/took mask all. antibody prevalence map, varies within region, depends specific populations subsets neighborhoods. Even Los Angeles's sero testing, first survey revealed 4.5%+ exposure, second (with different survey group included minorities) yielded 2.5%+. random samples reputable marketing research firm. really shows unlike diseases like cancer diabetes, covid hits communities like wildfire, hop-scotching &amp; torching areas leaving others unscathed. really hard put exact figure number non-diagnosed exposures via survey studies, especially asymptomatics. still broadcasting home? case say do. Lmao tee hee hee. forget change numbers made make exit, Einstein. 

1200% increase new cases since beginning June, bud. Hospitalization related covid deaths decline world wide. New death rates continue fall US. even balls say 7 people die/day current avg. Ya come back July let know dumb real surprises here. wear mask every single indoor place go super uncomfortable get really hot. excuse wear greater good that's non surprise. 2 American stupidity, clear work. 3 (availability) big one. I'm concerned I'm almost expired hospital masks far find buy without jacked prices Eva sheep üêë. Remember herds get slaughtered thing. ok admit wrong. testing injections. vaccine effective, administered via injection. 

The vaccine already exists. already made two phases testing. needed refrigeration, would well established now.

Your argument never *everyone* would vaccinated (which would never happen even capability so). Mass production allow mass vaccination. Millions people vaccinated huge first step containing virus. ‚Äòsubject matter expert‚Äô certainly know that.

Again. derail distract initial claim, it‚Äôs also really cool admit made error move on. Lol. asked video chat Zoom, quit ducking him. OP link video happens, need entertainment Wow, 20+ huh?

Just think many subhumans interacted with? *shudder* side note rules rules rules. 19 friends school organized big parties. rented venue everybody pitched rent. maybe 50 people. course wasn‚Äôt popular authorities. can‚Äôt young people drinking fun. police came checked couldn‚Äôt anything. one underage, one drugs. private party. Next time party happened police came closed down. Apparently it‚Äôs considered private party you‚Äôre dancing, turns public event. you‚Äôre public event need permit. ended three friends facing charges getting fines (not big). That‚Äôs ridiculous rules Sweden. started GOP realized could convince half country anything done good many direct infringement rights. mean...where fuck guy been? get ill start shedding virus within seconds inhaling it!

The amount scientific illiteracy sub depressing. I'll assume aware subject results every academic study then? Solid perspective learn. literally legal authority time remove people according ruleset, figure hand would delayed rounds stimulus.

God damn, really trying lolbertarian 0.1% stimulus Keeping economy up. gladly sacrifice 0.5-1.0 % people, especially old .... Italy March: like us, beg you, worth it. horrible... 

Italy today: Phew, least we're fucked USA. sure dodged bullet. real number could 120m, considering undetected cases Tried fight seether. Man, many things make American science COVID compromised. largest political influence coverups spread. Followed lack actual numbers due lack testing. I'm starting get worried anti-DonDon circle-jerk taken away peoples ability subjective virus. get it, underestimated virus take seriously enough. respond quickly enough, people rightfully frustrated upset this. feel like people *overcorrecting* under-response starting cause harm. new information come out, become clear virus serious initially told March. get wrong, still serious virus. I'm disputing that. essentially told level 7 8 threat, turns like 4 5. We've clearly identified demographics *far* likely experience severe symptoms negative outcomes. 

Children extremely, extremely unlikely experience severe symptoms, died statistical anomalies. clear indisputable observing actual data. know parents anti-DonDon infants acting like dare go outside risking child's life allowing family members interact child unless strictly isolate 2 weeks beforehand. planning keep year - vaccine. can't help think level paranoia stems swinging pendulum complete opposite direction. OrangeMan believes serious threat, *must* serious threat ever. Whatever says - opposite. Whatever thinks - believe opposite. 

I think reasonable sustainable precautions taking limit spread covid, think taking extra steps isolate protect risk experiencing severe case. VAST majority contract virus experience mild flu like symptoms. limit much society large expected sacrifice stop spread virus, especially one largely affects elderly immunocompromised. take risks every single day. spread viruses community every single day, sometimes viruses end killing people. unfortunate, price pay enjoying kind quality life all. People die car accidents every day - many times even fault. one advocating take cars road - value society collective quality life worth cost.

Anyway, guess point rambling truly honestly observe actual data pretty clear covid serious taking steps limit spread. also something necessitates shutting society keeping everyone indefinite quarantine vaccine. middle ground ""let's nothing, cares!""

I'll wear mask day every day means dont kill someone. Yes breath hot get people Texas Governor Greg Abbott actually issued order forbidding cities counties implementing mask rules.
These people deranged. Even major models 5%-95% confidence range predictions WAY places model published days ago.

Here Columbia's, major model, check Florida, Texas, Arizona, Georgia. keep checking can't wait see Oct 1 worst-case prediction is. Maybe get Karen Billy Bob wear mask. they've never liked pesky facts challenge worldview.

 agree, unfortunately people seem think one instead admitting possible. probably Acton resigned. Mazal Tov Laugh now, cry later regional lockdown also table. National lockdown necessary time, since know anything 0 testing, probably go far. 

Also, lockdowns tad bit overrated. data points people self isolating government action. Really, government action get minority bad actors comply reality. Remember news outlets back February claiming U.S. needs avoid becoming another Italy? Well we‚Äôve outdone it‚Äôs even close.  kind cringed reading wife 60 years service (military, national, regional) us believe country community feel sense responsibility.

I'm sorry angry. mean, thought shortly saw first JM press release whole point throw bit feel good bone Swedes effectively keeping ban place. onus swedes amp testing put infrastructure make 72 hours test thing happen. ""oh come test"" thing partially giving regions kick ass increase testing, imo. 

But right, easy forge know Swedes dishonest prone lying breaking law right? ;) mean many? Probabl ymore one hopes hey whole rationale behind vaunted Swedish strategy 'swedes follow rules' one forgive Danes bit naive thinking will. funny thing Danes always called Sweden land restrictions think Sweden little restrictions.

As editorial points out, generally Sweden land million restrictions. really odd anarchic Denmark followed international European 'rules' moved solidarity countries conformist Sweden beat path. least macro level. thought editorial interesting perhaps literary take happened: Goodbye 33,000 people. RIP. inevitable, work company puts rights first obligation employee's create population people think rights important. reap sow.

However surges blamed Memorial day protests, protests happened two weeks numbers started going considerably. we're part world nobody could've predicted it......cause would require believing science.... /s Yes please. someone please shout time home naught fuck now?? that's horrible news. Means sixteen times damage left go, words first prediction millions dying would true.

Everyone hoping number actual infections much much higher well... R front name one tells want hear ""yet"" key word Florida. Every rich jackass Florida winter home rushed here. stinks bad advice wear masks did. systemic problem. Bar owners managers enable feel emboldened.

Despite knowing manager still threatened cut unemployment. pandemic shown selfish industry think hanging bar key good. used feel like family see expendable. order batch testing work, need organization logistics. like funnelling huge herd sheep various gates find right sheep. 

For example, let say identify cases floating around US city. organize massive street street mandatory testing population? think US capable now? Worst day ever... far. Protests weren‚Äôt result lock downs.

At least, believe requiring everyone (with exceptions) wear mask reasonable easy measure. added bonus would close bars, dine restaurants, gyms wearing masks would difficult. can't imagine that.

Unpopular opinion: don‚Äôt need people, hopefully get wish catch COVID-19 die, without affecting rest us give damn. Karen Starbucks absolutely floors me, especially frivolous lawsuit she‚Äôs claiming file **for social media post**. Yes, I'm telling analogy works trying say, **because Surgeon General makes distinction outside inside, specific quantities comes secondhand smoke**. Rather, Surgeon General gives blanket statement **no exposure safe**. That's interesting analogy pick, because, analogy, outside vs inside matter comes COVID-19. ever imply either things? approve way he's handled situation all. still believe people overcorrecting far extreme precautions actual data calls for. Lmao, probably, wish citing old arguments adapting things people actually said past couple weeks. 17, flu developed pneumonia almost killed me. 1 month period, went 175 lbs 140 lbs...at 6'2"" height. 

It really really sucked...especially since that's doctors found allergic penicillin got deal allergic reaction top pneumonia. compiled articles problem. hospitalization system Japan inherently different would expect lot western countries. specialized hospitals designated infectious diseases, patients aren‚Äôt accepted emergency room covid. first find designated hospital space. hospitals overwhelmed leading people waiting ambulances call several hospitals (in one case 80 hospitals) finding one take in. leads people rejected hospitals don‚Äôt immediately need oxygen avoid overwhelming system. deaths, little publicly accessible data have, I‚Äôve linked article touches mortality rate covid season excess average, significantly higher reported coronavirus deaths. relatively safely agree people aren‚Äôt dropping rate US Brazil, given nature Japanese government compiles publicizes data, reserve judgement many actual deaths occurred time passed 3rd party provide statistics. Another not-so-insignificant part reporting family members dying en masse language barrier relative privacy. Perhaps you‚Äôre right, numbers real life (suspiciously) low (especially considering aging population hospitalization rate), perhaps people aren‚Äôt taking English twitter report grandparent died ‚Äúunknown‚Äù illnesses, common ailments elderly citizens (that may low-key coronavirus complications). Maybe I‚Äôm skeptical, knows. article seems expired otherwise disappeared figured I‚Äôd leave case resurfaces something ""freedom breathers"" ""freeman lung"" ? draft? kids died needlessly Vietnam? Soldiers defended freedom World War 2? Yes government absolutely tell do.

And they're asking wear God damned mask. Worst case causes autoimmune reaction. doctor hospital Queens. never heard many patient's coding, rapid responses, anesthesia/airway teams overheaded announced PA system. 

Just moved Los Angeles continue specialty training, numbers looking great. I'm waiting asked cover general medical teams again. wait two weeks? *hubris, yeah. Florida half population California. per capita like California reporting 20,000 cases one day. Holy shit  tell right phone call? urban areas, majority people already wearing masks outside Japan *crowded hell.* managed suppress well shows colossal difference discipline cultures. thing, know fewer 10 people. mom, dad, family family already 9 people one infant.

We're fighting facemasks reality government failed us, care, seem remorse given House spent good amount time vacation June Senate going recess.

A pandemic, like climate change, systemic problem. impacts everyone everything. impacts ability get medicine flour cakes.

If everyone became vegan, we'd still suffer climate change problems causing within systems. things unsustainable given challenges face.

A mask would help ultimately need systems fixed. need people stay home without worrying bankruptcy homelessness. need universal free health care CARES Act waivers disappearing talking million dollar medical bills.

States killing people cannot afford lockdown many ok killing portion residents.

You wearing mask help. like vegan could help. it'll never enough problems systemic. Yeah, I‚Äôm actually surprised well people Mexico things. actually listen everyone wears masks/face shields.

So hopefully beat virus soon! refuse stop car one motherfuckers crossing street. I'm American. one tell do. great adaption! better good excuse enforcement people still go out.

They're outside likely social distancing. wear masks, really worse tens thousands protesting shoulder shoulder. analogy bad make feel bad.

Is harm done wearing mask? No.

You plague rats need put effort want taken seriously. sound like joke.  feel like whole bunch Americans suddenly appreciate deeply deeply fucked tuskegee experiment (tho many likely ignorant story entirely). 

We essentially tuskegee experiment nation now. government lied us helping taking seriously, functioning cruelly useful data happens nothing......  Considering locked yet NY locked weeks peak... Yup... much longer need see well ""education"" goes?

Trump Pence Brix Fauci stand podium warn us, tell us social distance, wash hands, wear masks. Yet reason Trump's sheeple want believe Faux News Flu.



If someone fires gun air within city limits arrested. 40,000 people year killed guns. 120,000 people died Covid-19 less 6 months.

So wearing mask likely kill someone Covid19 around firing gun air.

Both result arrest. Memorial Day indicator, we‚Äôre absolutely screwed 4th Idk. view mask another thing wear part daily life. Like wearing glasses crash car. Also hat want look like leather bag 50.

I'm underestimating anything. made claim (that Covid like HIV, infection natural immunity) without backing anything. pressed supporting evidence, gave anecdotes subreddit instead actual science. saying say things true. Damn, that's nice way start negotiations. OK then. Try going public buck naked see happens.

(What's funny attempted back following citing posts doctors supposedly think masks necessary, actually read article, they're pro-mask.) Also another thought: resources health infrastructure limited.

 Also hiatus Sweden, also recall pretty big outbreak occur outside Stockholm district, updates regarding play positivty rate remaining roughly past week 2?!?!

Hm, thinking G√§llivare? one north. think accounts this, no. Norrbotten region G√§llivare in, outbreak started accelerate June 12 610 cases. 1149 June 27. two weeks *basically* doubled cases. that's still drop bucket. 

As KiwiBattlerNZ way positive rate remain stable testing increased initial infection rate much higher (but hidden lack testing) infection rate increasing well.

I *think* former likely explanation tbh. supported fact regions offered expanded testing HUGE response, several became overwhelmed shut part program. 

So think (unless i've totally missed something possible) first suggestion probably accounting this. still good, bad could be! lastly though really related post, Tegnell still talking precious antibody levels across Sweden since I've away?!?! haha :P

Sigh, actually lol. got back [a study showed decent prevelence (17%) **BUT** sample self selected. self select? Obviously think disease. want go anywhere near Swedish hospital right get test tell nothing interesting? Anyone right mind thinks it. *heavily* biased sample, Tegnell quite pleased might imagine. ;) apply jobs, go interviews offered, accept job that's offered. Need vent this. mother law contact positive case. didn‚Äôt tell anyone hung around her, wife worked last weekend. got test went work hung family test results back. negative fuck pissed. And? referring cause outbreak. far I‚Äôm seeing state, we‚Äôre adjusting procedures based numbers. We‚Äôre handling immensely better states. one reach us high case state flooding boarders. even governors mayors responding quickly don‚Äôt think things get bad again. large extent already happening Hong Kong. Best comparison middle May positive rate roughly now. Back average 24 thousand cases 7-day average, 34k (and growing rapidly). 42% actual cases right middle May. Yeah, can't. kind people would think doctors scientists part conspiracy anything say lie, moment got seriously sick they'd still go them.

I'd love someone iota brainpower control situation takes actual leader focused situation implement suggestions. Getting rid Fauci help anyone unless exists someone ability convince government move ass. really cringey attempt spinning it. Aaaaand basically right also means death rate substantially lower. deaths aren‚Äôt close March peak yet. we‚Äôre getting 100k cases day back March first shut down. Although trust numbers China accurate, know people work Shanghai Beijing. absolutely back normal terms everyone returning work office again. doubt things way worse US Brazil right now.

GA elect governor, Kemp steal election even barely won. End day 47,431. flu season interesting, trying seperate coronavirus regular flu. Especially countries testing routinely carried anybody symptoms, like Japan. Flu seasons always bad too. I'm Toronto, Canada, government said schools students rotate half kids class given time, promote physical distancing rooms. individual schools decide whether alternate days alternate weeks. People encouraged keep children home feel comfortable sending in, online education continue people switch back forth wish. always wear mask since late February actually. believe personal responsibility ensuring best personally, society, community importantly culture. 

The fact many homeowners purchased homes height housing economic bubble without ensuring fiscally responsible enough able weather difficult challenging times take responsibility. Losing house something celebrate... matter time. There's nothing it. 

And many victim circumstances beyond control. actually hurts heart know society dependent factors can't anything change... I'm even talking virus. I'm talking easily millions us lose homes. Food. Education. Fucking toilet paper... virus. That's just... Fucking silly. We're supposed greatest country world! respond fucking crisis? We're fucked üòÇ

Point is... Many people deserve lose homes corporate government irresponsibility feel them. hope every one find way crazy time God, friends, family... Whatever need, hope it.

But I'm going feel bad worked fucking ASS last 20 years position I'm right now... spent almost 4 weeks hospital last 6 months, bills going crazy still MIGHT able buy decent house small yard next 2 3 years.

The collapse going happen. one's fault, take part responsibility allowing happen. shown whole world especially Americans fucked up. let system get control. elected allowed pieces shit stay office far long some, dumb enough even LET fucking door begin with! (looking Donny)

Now fix it. start wearing fucking mask showing give fuck November, healthy enough something it. 

There's nothing point though... might well hope big enough buy house cheap! American way life negotiable. one ever make movie pandemic US winning fight world knows reality Lt.

It kind hilarious. mean yesterday big beachparty Amsterdam loads people, nobody cares front camera everyone pretends practice social distancing. nobody really believes big threat anymore. doomers wear face masks. look outside city full people almost laugh ordeal assure you.

Also last protest group hug government tried make everyone believe insanely dangerous move.

In Netherlands sane rational people consider mask wearing hysteria thing actually feel same.

Like, kids people school!!!!! won‚Äôt around people much. private place quiet stretch beach. Maybe going pick take couple trips store beer/food interaction I‚Äôll have.  Yes, weaponize virus. president started sending pandemic team Wuhan California back December without telling expect sure shit quarantining upon arrival. seed disease California. be.  Hospitals starting hit capacity people tend crash 2 weeks initial infection. think still first wave summer... can't want imagine going look like fall come winter time flu/cold season. Especially schools opening up. 

I hope wake call US need real leadership believes science. outright diaster. still can't believe crazy conspiracy theorists thinking joke. frightening anti-intellectual society entails. I'm planning see family LA Fourth July weekend COVID numbers make impossible

You're irresponsible people shitting on. Bye fact many people living #1 economy world enough savings sustain 6 months without job, losing healthcare time, clear signs American kind ""good economy"" really mean stability happy people. 

Classical case much anything bad. fast moving money flow great, that's healthy. way fast point load people would debt without job 1 2 months, point healthcare leverage force flow? That's terrible, that's also America. agree something likely wrong here, think lab would realistically release something like without running 1 2 additional tests confirm? So, theory deep state's big evil plan subjugate enslave humanity is...face masks. think Pinky Brain effective plans world domination! Huh? top 10 states highest new cases order FL, CA, TX, AR, GA, NC, TN, SC, LA, OH. death rate down, likely stay down, fuck everyone freaking out? cares record number cases carry commensurate number deaths? even ‚Äúdrive-thru‚Äù places require appt advance time slots taken Sunday, genius. places booked July 2nd. Sunday soonest could get.

And also I‚Äôm staying home staying home ever since noticed symptoms. Way assume. comment gives vibes original coverage China, Wuhan reported 2 hours rest China. Colorado Adam's 12 School District also trying person schooling. They're giving options parents let kids go online, parents internet home? parents money purchase PPE children? then?

Yeah I'm calling out. Ah yes, solution limiting exposure disease remove limiters exposure disease. Gotcha. High school kids going study write shitty essays period history 250 years chapter regarded historic stupidity unprecedented scale. terribly sad is, incredible living it. Yes. different strain family virus. That's disease causes called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. disease different. hide deaths.. florida expert that. US also forcibly quarantined entire families openly published infected people's names newspapers century ago, back polio major problem. idea political freedom useful public health measures mutually exclusive modern one. Venn diagram two groups *quite* single circle, damn close. they're dying states go blue November. Happy Cake Day!!!! well. far thats data shows. Theres easy answers right now.

Lets hope continues one small positive mess (that 10 dont seem get hard it). 34.0 minute delay fetching comments.

Nah couple days ago. came point appreciate mess, better planet less people. 

Of course sad individuals, hand total population still growing way faster people dying.

I still hope turn mindset go little greener future, must return old ""normal""

Here go mods. No, will. minorities, protestors, homeless people. white ""standing liberties,"" cops ignore you. article states actual scientific studies empirical evidence. epidemiologist study says MAY prevent transmission what. 

""The first five days mandate, daily growth rate slowed 0.9 percentage-points compared five days prior mandate; three weeks, daily growth rate slowed 2 percentage-points.""

Squarely within standard deviation mean 2% shows affect. 


""The latest forecast Institute Health Metrics Evaluation suggests 33,000 deaths could avoided October 1 95 percent people wore masks public.""

The amount likely saved also took vitamins werent obese diabetes. number mandate 330mm people restrict personal freedom over. 

The link provided explains evidence completely silly. infection rate 0.007% population death rate 0.00038%. actuary terms thats risk. made is. covid thing taken serious? Yes. everyone risk? No. youre shape, unhealthy, health conditions begin yes may affected, cause yorue unhealthy, take steps boost immune system vitmains nutrients exercise would net positive better effect wearing mask scientifically documented effect. come news isnt pushing healthy eat well take vitamins get work in? Thats proven work. data shows spread much protests. guess outside masks helps lot. Maybe. Havent seen infections follow deaths far. Seems like first wave (globally speaking) keeps going. doesn‚Äòt seem stop summer. New cases deaths per day still rise. Within certain countries, term second wave makes sense (Iran example), globally really slowdown. long somebod like Rachal Maddow, Katie Tur, Jake Tapper gets it? found sanctimonious Canadian! ""the numbers going quickly""

We need get rid Trump. Absolutely Especially shine inside body. /s Antibody tests detect people least two weeks infection.
On average would lot longer (up couple months), depending test done.
You certainly estimate IFR based that, done many epidemiologists many countries already. absolute shit show, shut completely 6 fucking weeks could‚Äôve over, people get haircuts, people party. selfishness nation sickening. understand think masks aren‚Äôt necessary normal flu season agree. It‚Äôs wearing mask deeply ingrained culture public understand sick = wear mask. government didn‚Äôt even need issue guidelines people knew intuitively do. I‚Äôm really confused logic here. know cases know about. Today know almost 9000 additional cases FL. That‚Äôs still lot, even don‚Äôt know 5000 cases today. 1/20 people need hospitalized that‚Äôs 450 hospital beds TODAY‚Äôs CASES!! point completely moot. ""Owen Hart died. going 10"" 


Paraphrasing told JR commercial break thought issue might adjust masks lot put hands close mouth frequently. uhg, really sorry hear that. 

My wife works Federal Government, scared happening. Shutting churches would huge impact cost ZERO jobs. He's better Trump America still going laughing stock rest world resolve issues. next 4 years going waste time. apply position NY Times. talent writing clickbait made bullshit get attention. Pathetic karma whore. truth De Blasio Cuomo handled awfully. Instead coordinating fought among themselves, contradicted press conferences. De Blasio even encouraged NYC residents wear masks. Like rest politicians sides failed grasp severity situation instead engaged petty politics score points. Kind now. agree said. Profiteering major concern mine. I'm waiting see figure vaccine/treatment current guess ‚Ç¨3,000+/treatment (as vaccine good luck guessing). 

As hydroxychloriquine, uniquely American problem. rest world doctor would laugh telling medication want prescription for. spent 4 months US last year still baffled constant prescription medical ads television.  ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt see forest trees‚Äù comes mind. do. Jimmy Flores - piece shit started company divert COVID relief funds, sudden wants people pay $40k+ hospital bills going crowded bar *sharing drinks* friends. Deaths undercount Florida 10%. none residents state invited facilities playing, staying, eating, etc.. matter? Took 3+ weeks get dad's April. I‚Äôm tired country Exactly. friend FL believes FL positively rate less 1% media blowing proportion. 

That‚Äôs gave started getting ready many months isolation. Hopefully fact particular wavelength doesn‚Äôt repercussions. I‚Äôd hate later find accelerates skin cancer development. It‚Äôs nice UV-C isn‚Äôt harmful deal demon virus. Putting tinfoil hat here, think beginning campaign federal govt get us accept herd immunity valid strategy.

The CDC estimate based antibody testing. couple weeks ago saying antibody tests accurate enough make meaningful conclusions. Florida win wooo Good job dude, we'll done. Proud human garbage ^ trapped belly horrible machine
And machine bleeding death Actually, read Genesis... way avoid death stay indoors. sort makes sense certain definition population density. necessarily close live people, many people use grocery stores, hair salons, gyms, buses, etc. sorry. re-elected November 2018 term 4 years. Unfortunately, also got Ted Cruz senator that's 6 year term. counted hour period instead days...eg: 11am Thursday 10:59am Friday. they've moved goal posts. *may* recover

Precautionary principle. New virus, many unknowns. Well said judge

I disgusted blatant disregard public safety mass protests weeks ago hard keep state closed two months. People willing stay inside see people indefinite amount time. needed better plan lockdown going lifted People issue wearing masks, recommendation wear disposable masks cloth masks. Reason breathable versus cloth masks thick makes harder breathe. ICU filling high-risk ppl need worried about. Holy shit silver lining least younger population vs older ones. anyway. Hospitalizations manageable deaths bad yettt.. still early say that.. issue PPE never fully ‚Äúsolved‚Äù, heard - nurses doctors forced reuse lots equipment while, especially hard hit areas. wearing cloth masks endanger supplies N95 surgical masks? makes sense. Actually, widespread use face coverings public conserve PPE (indirectly) reducing transmission disease lowering burden healthcare systems. shame didn‚Äôt sooner. I'd post smile emoticon could.  could told old rubbish climate change would believe it. 

The research funded George soros, china conspiracy, way control lives etc. near spike. next week liable worst. parts. keep safe Stop giving apologist statistics, Signapore 1000x dense US seen NY important statistic density. actual data article suggest millennials actually spreading virus more? lazy writing treated such. expect WaPo. Well Sting Ray killed poor Steve Irwin, one trusts him. helps avoid confusion.


It's like Ray Faux News Virus responsible tens thousands deaths week everyone wants ignore. Actually, recently discovered cambodia allowing americans in, pretty much virus free! said, good luck getting there, require $3000 deposit pay quarantine get there, would surprised ever see money haven‚Äôt even mandated everyone wear masks. government fucking joke. 

Florida isn‚Äôt going take seriously hospital capacity. Honestly, I'm furthest left person ever, I'm gonna upset see G mask, least they're wearing fucking mask. insane. Today took Facebook openly defy Governor support shocking Everyone dog wants go TMC. people begging get treatment TMC even Covid-19. Also fighting. Lotta contact there. Bingo Per-Willy Amundsen supports Tommy Robinson suggested child support non-western immigrants cut stop ""producing children"" halt possible decline ""ethnic Norwegians"" population. Talked contact tracer, said system isn‚Äôt place tried contact ONE person 3 weeks they‚Äôve worked there. still trying log system weeks. elective procedures hold order governor days ago. Hey, that‚Äôs county!! order posted FB littered idiots mad him. However, going 95% people actually wearing mask. It‚Äôs crazy simple mask tick people off. Japan last year people wore masks prevent spreading catching cold/ flu. Let‚Äôs protect other! need listen medical advisors. 

Our leader (Australia) dimwit holiday bushfire emergency. Still part, listened medical chiefs something like 1 death last month. 

Sure less people much less. Per capita like USA 13 deaths last month. 

What failure leadership USA regarding pandemic criminal. morons responsible hundreds thousands deaths. idea dire situation India. Even didn‚Äôt harm kids that‚Äôs even point post was. Take negativity else where. People putting health lives line help people survive Covid. right. live that. get pretty nasty. Yeah, recall seeing videos cops beating black peoples NYC wearing masks ultra friendly white people wearing masks Central Park. Don‚Äôt forget cops focus news last several weeks. mom read article day hospitalizations labeled covid test positive, even someone go motorcycle crash happened test positive going in. regular heart attack stroke. 

I‚Äôm saying completely true, find interesting. months back. confirm: fog days row. Hard explain concisely, something ‚Äúoff‚Äù. quite strange. going use decreased death rate percent confirmed cases among young people sugar-coat situation. reality increased spread virus essentially forces elderly risk stay home stay away young family members, basically continuation lockdown (with end sight). help economy? thank posting. truly alarming. stay safe everybody Completely agree. think walking eggshells still prudent responsible. Saying things like ""reduce testing numbers look better"" help anyone.

Test put data. Furthermore, may need start teaching R naught infection rates. Asymptomatic people real wild cards. Yeah, interesting specifically called closure tubing. mask part reasonable general. Clearly US able solve crisis; opioid epidemic, school shootings, etc. Fucking Christ. Every state needs close borders whole country seeing numbers time.  Also Florida: Masks optional. absolutely shit take. Throwing away rights ""obligations fellow man woman"" used justify everything Government surveillance removing/reducing labour laws. whole point rights foundational are, they're something *can* fall back on.

People obviously wear masks, take care protect around them, whatever help everyone get this. opinion revolves around denigrating people's rights defensive go directly trash. Testing positive means virus alive well inside you. Sometimes asymptomatic people pre-symptomatic present symptoms later, remain asymptomatic throughout infection. what's making virus devilish defeat handle. makes people really sick leaves others without scratch. Arizona among several states, Texas, Florida, California North Carolina shown substantially increased rate COVID-19 among Latino communities. Idk many times I've heard people say, ""I symptoms months ago, bet people already it."" No, c'mon, even make sense. people already many people suddenly dying *now*?  Y'all love making excuses flawed system.  Irony strongest quality. China way cases confirmed. US did. means sell alcohol to-go. Let‚Äôs see happens next two weeks. parents let go America unaccompanied pandemic absurd me. Yeah sure sure Jose bounce illegally surely get noticed, sick, caught,detained anything. man that‚Äôs works Florida: hols beer Fine, dumbest phrase ever, better? Ooof. Ok that's good know. know that. would sue ignoring order. anyone tested positive experience dizziness standing bending over? think migraine last night (never one before) lingering dizziness things still happening morning I‚Äôd like know worried Or, 9,585 cases announced today. came controversial find mom said me, ""bill gates evil. He's eugenicist. sterilized Africa. Ect"" saying ‚Äúthey‚Äù based masculinity? 

99% masculine men I‚Äôve interacted good, caring people. shouldn‚Äôt surprise people confidfent therefore don‚Äôt need bring others lift up. 

If I‚Äôm speaking experience, it‚Äôs unmasculine men insecure masculinity judgemental tend bully others they‚Äôre jealous of. (Which makes sense that‚Äôs common defense mechanism insecurity) 

But don‚Äôt want hypocrite say unmasculine men like that. Again, depends individual can't wait responses claiming massive nationwide BLM protests nothing increase.. going worse NY start reopening, NY peak start lockdown Actually, I'm mistaken. say ""d√≠game"" means ""tell me"". Sometimes even shortened ""d√≠ga"". Someone told meant speak me, checked, doesn't.

Another example. American, English person, may approach shop worker politely say ""Excuse me, help me"" something like that. Spanish person walk say ""A question"". culture. listed done Nazis, imperial Japan, Rwandans. common tactic preceding mass violence way dissociate they've done humanity. thing starship troopers story aware. Real men care protect vulnerable, even means discomfort. grandfather flew 101 combat missions Nazi AA guns think put piece cloth face 45 minutes day.  Exactly, Africa. Africa quite far behind compared continents. Palm Beach County mandated masks. needed plan. Period.  hiding something, probably gag order received, wanting hide anything themselves. Disneyland, Disney World Yea you‚Äôre telling me. Like people actually saying can‚Äôt breathe masks medical professionals wear time extended periods times every day! death rates look low nearly 50% Florida‚Äôs cases come past two weeks, nearly half infections aren‚Äôt old enough worsened point hospitalization fatality. Where‚Äôs Billie Mays ya need Good thing US extremely easy travel across land. serves propagate undeservedly privileged status. Government tool control corruption Let's lump everybody together, American thing, republican thing. Fox viewers loyalty America point, they're Confederates.

If choice Republicans destroying America virus destroying Republicans, easy choice. Yeah crazy. office went 100% 50% work home within like 5 days lol. live rural CA, moved New England near family. every bit ignorant backwards backwoods portrayed Deliverance. Many people even speak backwoods drawl, thick find anywhere deep south. first thought imagining this, googled found [this page topic. it‚Äôs like haven‚Äôt forced wear things public entire time. read wrote earlier regarding NY. NY *much better handle* virus rest country. got hit hardest beginning actually felt pain rest country pretending virus real - pain made NY clamp letting completely safe so. really surprising virus spike NY based purely that... model rest country handling pandemic. Los Angeles screwed response hard, even though locked first - hence seeing massive spikes there.

You also ignored mention virus spreading differently region region. Boston may seen spikes, still held protests, virus may spreading different pattern - purely speculating done 0 research Boston handling virus numbers are.

You can't put blanket statement like country 3.797 million mi¬≤... Fair point. sensational. Guillain-Barr√© syndrome triggered anything illicits immune system response. Really fact common COVID-19 probably interesting. BTW, common trigger campylobacte infection eating undercooked poultry. dunno, maybe whole slavery thing, like beginning time? Twice day two minutes, simple remedy. forget floss! seems pretty straight forward me. Stay home new cases drop. Open new cases increase. Wear masks, practice distancing, limit interactions especially indoors cases rise significantly slower rate. need focus running clock vaccine available slow transmission next year. Everything else secondary. agree this. summer heat curbs virus getting hit hard virus US South. may slow transmission outdoors hot people hang inside causing spread. Yep, basically soft max total cases, positivity rate climbs comical proportions. We've seen 15-20% days four states. like even bother read comments even say.  Great job, Florida. sure showed libs. Disneyland California denied permission open. Disneyworld put ticket reservation system yesterday morning. Hard believe since outbreak peak started much earlier UK. need properly fitted someone knows they‚Äôre they‚Äôre gonna effective standard mask Yeah, completely understand. things reversed, wouldn‚Äôt want same. think I‚Äôm thinking bit future, problems worsen problems life becomes much harder, much corona. Yeah, lot Japanese hating lack action government. citizens took every precaution spread virus, government sat back basically said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going enforcing precautions gets worse.‚Äù America isn‚Äôt country. It‚Äôs business. still poor take implies people's rights taken away. They're not. PERSONAL ANECDOTE:

I may may months ago, biggest thing threw ill mentally foggy was. job requires lot thinking writing, I‚Äôd previously able work pneumonia flu problem. enjoy work like analyzing problems. fell ill something never felt cognitively impotent. Couldn‚Äôt focus, couldn‚Äôt articulate thoughts, mess. laid bed days staring wall. exact message Trump put out.

If told wear masks would  Sustainable meaning continue meaning hospital capacity handle it? rights give *me* something, obligations gives *you* something. merica. also like immunity. helps Northeast virus gets slowed 20+% immunity. Same. It‚Äôs free money though, tax dollars (presumably) paid already anyone? update every 24 hours. Muh freedom + normalcy bias. tell people reopening economy, *that flu problem* must over, since reason """"""*lockdowns*"""""". Right?

Also, less people wearing masks, higher chance maskwearer stop wearing them. ""I want *the guy mask*. Muh identity!"" Shocked pikachu face Sounds time consuming Well, beaches Miami people think. There‚Äôs massive pile bars clubs ‚Äúat beach‚Äú. 

So it‚Äôs people chilling sand. It‚Äôs basically closing Ocean Drive. Almost 25k cases Arizona, Florida, Texas California yesterday ONE day?

Let‚Äôs go 10,000 day July 4

‚ÄòMerica ! virus response?

Other blame New York brown people? Philadelphia little dicey right now. might seeing new spike, noise data. Netherlands small country, yet areas 10 percent, areas less 1 percent infected. anyone frequents sub, live here, predicted 10k last week. Sorry much. S/He technically correct, best kind correct. ok auto mod, I'm big boy. take bit incivility. Delta SW made actually enjoy flying. chore feel like sheep carted around nickel dimed need throughout East coast  already pre-ordered US likelihood manufacturing started.

Can't see country charging citizens vaccine. majority people make effort ever.

I'm sure ""majority"". 

Where am, majority people outside reasonable, tons people I'm seeing inside reasonable. experienced poverty.

How pay least cashier works part-time $15 hour.

Why $15? $150? want poor? Make mandatory start handing tickets awhile. people follow rules. Lots already wear them. Especially make mandatory indoor spaces. amazing people speak confidently without even basic arithmetic. kidding. Big Bear EVERYTHING opened weeks lockdowns even ended. went 4x4ing people bars, jammed restaurants shopping normally masks. IE many people masks, people throwing massive house parties several dive bars letting people pack shoulder shoulder. neighbors believe coronavirus, says made up. None local PD wear masks, ever. 

People stupid fuck way. Young folk make large set U.S., may bad first go around. beaches? asking people throw parties backyards homes? obsession beaches!!!? Good thing cares don‚Äôt matter. Idiot. Thanks! see excel spreadsheet age stratified numbers. age group 0-17, per 100 thousand says 0.69 deaths 343.15 cases equates CFR 0.201%. possible NYC missed 10x total cases based seroprevalence studies, kids likely going mild asymptomatic infection adults. estimate IFR age group ballpark 0.008-0.02%. Brooke Baldwin well antivaxers get chance fuck things up. schools open July 26? Fourth day incoming lol think real numbers insane, ammount reportation basic 'dismissed cold' that's happening country alone im sure everywhere else mind blowing Theres also significant hotspots overrun hospitals point. beginning several countries well NY. Death rates spike again, TX looking pretty bad capacity wise. Ughh lack leadership US made think moving Canada. I'm already Canadian citizen not, right? ""aboot"" crazy here! (Sorry to) lol think real numbers insane, ammount reportation basic 'dismissed cold' that's happening country alone im sure everywhere else mind blowing oh I‚Äôm dumb I‚Äôm Kansas lol, Missouri totally agree - schools lose connections many students. entire year worse. ending school year early, least benefit knowing kids, work habits, issues dealing outside school. Starting year remotely would allow us make connections. hope go back safely! - logically - schools shut early unsafe there, don‚Äôt see different now. Maybe know virus time put proper precautions place? risk still real, even split kids half, I‚Äôve seen suggested. don‚Äôt envy making decisions - seems like lose lose. :(. Woahhh could predicted would happen?! Thanks much! Bars, gyms, theme parks need close Florida IMMEDIATELY. 

And people need GO THERE. C B household 4 devour one these.... Wrong assume used large gatherings. USA responsible nearly 25% new cases today despite 4% total world population. Good work guys! mean, maybe revolver truly ridiculous cylinder. IFR young healthy people low. Young healthy people die exactly comparable Russian roulette. Remindme 11 days ! raise taxes wealthy provide free health childcare way.

Better pull bootstraps. Lots grandmas grandpas better bunker getting numbers? Dashboard used use work anymore. sloppy masks part understandable. people vaccinate even cure hand masks mandatory. Whee! Yeah it‚Äôs like 0.5%, even that‚Äôs skewed higher rates elderly. 

However medical providers get overwhelmed could expect death rate rise 2% Dude I‚Äôm saying getting drunk cope world catastrophe 100% control, unhealthy weak. Please prove sentiment wrong.

Please prove sentiment hiding hardship abusing substance healthy way cope.

Why bringing trump thinking trump rn

You‚Äôre stereotypical redditor link shows higher percentage among black Americans white Americans. showing opposite claimed. 

Percentage number (amount) different Unfortunately keep wearing masks distancing themselves, people need first place I'm sure lots people expressing regret voting dumb ass. We've got pinhead Arizona that's thing... ""gee, sure wish kept people safe instead corralling deaths like many cows way becoming quarter pounders!"" sympathy children. sympathy want shake time. Found scrub. I'm aware Flint's water crisis. median age new infections much lower (in states 50% age 35). Roughly 25% deaths far nursing homes still locked down. That‚Äôs say death rate couldn‚Äôt sky rocket along cases lag time might lot longer time around. That's really going anything.

The infections happening bars, restaurants churches. beaches covid can't get chicken bake.....thanks covid wife got haircut today refused wear mask. reasoning? ""The pandemic over"" going thread copy/pasting comment over?

please feel free rejoin discussion done fellating elon. seem lot stamina, i've given half day catch breath. totally understand need time, though. Americans, enjoying ride? You‚Äôre idiot K. Thanks helpful answer. US like kid study test, wondered got F Wouldn‚Äôt sight see! really hate people going ""lmao Darwin award"" statistics.

People basically forced market break quarantine, behest people class interests run counter people dying. Family member flew AA flight LAX PHL two weeks ago full. That's happens one wearing masks anymore. go Meijer shop rarely see people masks. That‚Äôs get annoyed see headlines comments talking spikes.
‚ÄúWe reopened 2 weeks there‚Äôs spike‚Äù
Epidemiology doesn‚Äôt work like that, exponential curve won‚Äôt look like much first two weeks ramps it‚Äôs frightening.
Here kicker. way way late! 
Those people interested reopening economy may like explain economy going fair many people sick can‚Äôt work, remember large proportion get laid bed two weeks.
If 1/8 workforce sick time, it‚Äôs predominantly essential services, transport retail sectors it‚Äôs going shitshow. lot subs work multiple school buildings. sub who‚Äôs contagious takes job multiple schools one week could go expose shit load faculty kids.

Also lot subs older, retired educators looking something occupy time. They‚Äôre prime age group covid complications. school 5 best subs typically work multiple days week late 60‚Äôs early 70‚Äôs. Looking current CV deaths short sighted. still beginning pandemic. Look numbers played see impact is. One problem many hospitals become overloaded, qualified carers short-staffed, likelihood complications would otherwise handled could result much worse outcome. want triage situations. Jokes them. Trump didn‚Äôt need pandemic look bad. I've gotten influenza kids several years running despite getting vaccine. Every time I've see doctor every time would walk in, put one surgical masks set out, every single time people would look like 2 heads. recall ever seeing another patient put one despite large sign asking anyone influenza symptoms put mask. Last December went ER get checked pneumonia fever returned quit coughing, 8 days flu B diagnosis. Even ER doctor said ""please ditch mask, like able see I'm treating!"" already told diagnosed influenza. Americans think masks super weird get it. Many rural areas done well all. previous protest (April)by group, leaders husband said willing kill people sacrifice life cause. spike happened. disease kill instantly. Major hub airports slot-controlled. Airlines either fly lose slots. Stop filling planes start losing money, quickly. Coronavirus proved that.

It'll take like two months DFW folks telling AA fuck they're bankrupt.  People like reason fucked up. negates importance story, Rebekah isn‚Äôt scientist GIS analyst, I. scientist. doesn‚Äôt make happened OK. percentage expected hospitalized? Anybody know? Gloryhole porn earlier phase reopening types porn. First solo gloryhole doggystyle reverse cowgirl. 

CDC call ideas. reach 11k passed NY states peak infection rate adjusted population looked news, looked outside posted earlier lol comment thread Facebook posts awful, brings worst people. needed though last 2 weeks order put place, I‚Äôd go Kroger somewhere I‚Äôd one 3 people masks on. Idk, live America one ever asked questions polls suggest. people that. Sweden shown us that, plan well enough, never run ICU space. let people die elsewhere.!&lt; cat eligible.

And that's problem.

My choices two war criminals histories mass violence.

I'm even sure Bdn knows year is. one point, campaign gig, even remember he's gig wanders set. encouraged people wait line pandemic vote instead demanding universal mail ballots.

Who earth vote capable meeting crisis? know. Riverside ships covid patient's, fucking scam Sucks get super powers then. r/nottheonion right...?! clearly must note proves since Doctors give it. I'm sure conveniently left home wasnt excuse /s Almost forcing public turns people away idea hmmmm wearing mask clearly. numbering ways avoid wear masks beginning enough PPE healthcare workers. there's plenty reason wearing masks people catch covid, throw quarantine cells deny treatment? Would karmic justice me. Don‚Äôt forget 7.8 billion people world. logistical challenges one thing. ethical challenges charts. mention still huge anti-vaxx issue, it‚Äôs America. far many drawbacks keeping schools closed. someone breathing problems knows people work healthcare, wearing mask 30 minutes go grocery store nothing compared entire shifts surgeries one pretty much plastered face. Wow! kinda thought that. days like warmer sometimes even called winter I'm from. summer heat slowing transmission keeping everyone outdoors. would say even cold outdoors get results. people get together precautions hang indoors regardless weather. still get cold days weeks live lot people indoors times summer winter here. Wait second, lying Chinese wet market bat jerkey Wu Han Virus 2019 Trump saved us new Faux News Virus one same? work Strip. place I‚Äôm working reopened recently strict cleaning social distancing rules place. Unfortunately one really follows guidelines back house. Guests hardly follow rules either. Masks mandatory inside public spaces pool areas. We‚Äôve people American hotspots (Texas, Florida, California, Georgia) stay mingle other. workers also tested reopened free plans yet testing everyone again. there‚Äôs outbreak casino I‚Äôm working at, let alone dumpy casino relaxed rules I‚Äôll surprised. Even invincible 100% assurance would asymptomatic, still go, would tell friends reconsider   wayyyyy double Here's link NV get rate, divide number positive (1099) number test administered (4180) , lastly multiply 100 percentage.

1099/4180 = 0.262918
0.262918 √ó 100 = 26.29% (rounded up)

We're bad shape sound like feds prefer say. 3+ at, I‚Äôd say 90% people wearing masks also multiple people giving free masks well. patriotic don‚Äôt want it? doesn‚Äôt sound right, communist. past weeks saturday posting highest numbers, Monday usually lowest day. exactly.. Japanese people go work sick, wear mask to. infect coworkers. Taking sick day frowned upon Japanese companies.  according Sweden‚Äôs experiment. 

Have people already forgotten bodies stacked unrefrigerated trucks? Name shame.

These people killing families. 1/3rd population US. California alone 6 times many deaths. Makes sense. close street put tables outside it‚Äôs cold.

People cars figure out, maybe they‚Äôll take fucking bike better environment air quality alerts there? Owensboro see anything. wimp. 30% refused tests says ""oh well!"".NSW? ""Then extra ten days quarantine!"" Go Gladys! do. Hospitalizations new deaths stable There's good reason dine put back quickly restaurants. go patio got way forward long pandemic going on. sucks customers way semblance protecting employees newsflash need healthy employees dropping like flies virus make food.  Covid count Harper's 85; antivaxxers say they'll survive; life's good far... Oof, indeed üòî Yes logistics would quite difficult....but think would less expensive yet another round Stimulus packages....and effective. People willing sacrifice entire industries vaccine (that may never come) arrives.

If concerned, stay home. There‚Äôs still enough doctors.

You get half face respirators filters though. good news anything happening India regarding Covid-19 moment. never fail shocked recovery rate keeps getting spun good news. 
Also cases increase exponentially reach 5 lakh cases obviously doubling rate keep getting longer happened every single country world. perfect. don‚Äôt need realize anything, man. read-up you. Making political going send thread spiral, say agreeing Trump state nation. already clearly indicated money, else, important thing American society better, probably worse. strongly implied comment removed can‚Äôt actually see said anymore. Nevertheless, take favour laws requiring people wear masks then?

Also, rules put place pandemic violate first second amendments?  happened GOP seized power, stopped education, terrified people forced religion upon every step way. h√® new here? Nobody:

Florida: Records made broken. I'm American firmly support this. live state (Maryland) masks made maditory soon locked down. still required wear store. 
 I'm ashamed people's arrogance wearing mask.  
We care aborting unborn children(?)..... can't wear fucking mask potentially save another human life!?!?! Honestly big part comes way media tried emphasize risk.

The old, prior conditions, black people.

So basically typical middle aged white guy figures long Gamma stays home, he's safe. Better yet, poors health issues blacks hurt, better mind virus run rampant purge society. kind guy honestly believes family get virus side effects, I've seen many rural communities, believe already community last fall (when flu went around). Thank serving public please take care even it‚Äôs moments time throughout day.

(I would say sarcasm, really not. exactly American culture become: individual comfort/happiness/opinion important well-being/health/good general public. matter everyone else. country built ""i matter you"", get bunch selfish assholes contributing worst global public health crisis hundred years, end sight.)

&amp;#x200B;

""proud american"" american ""fuck you"" agree older crowd wearing especially ridiculous. grocery store aisle marked one way help keeping people distanced. Yesterday man woman shopping together, 70, wearing masks going wrong way every aisle.

Thats either total lack awareness total dick move (which likely case). family member get work home? 

One reason people still forced go outside earn pay bills Speaking myself, feel like I‚Äôve aged decade past 4 months. analogy meant visualize way share air close proximity. nitpicking isnt going change that. Also last time ever. Wtf title? Dish soap lenses.

Rinse off.

Leaves invisible protective film.

Let air dry.

Won‚Äôt dig weeks. breathing problem, doctor let wear mask. anyone harassing wear mask, guys violating federal law.



Hum smell bullshit. protests at? ones maybe 1/3 less people wearing masks Stay safe really went tough bout. pulled through. takes avoid another battle. Triage. \**Intentionally* manipulated underfunded government.

Think that's meant, CDC, easy mistake. Lmao people really don‚Äôt get it‚Äôs like NYC restaurant. 

You basically face face diners closet yeah whatever, go back basement now. see ya Americans today literally can't fathom concept making sacrifice. sad 18 year olds past generations would forced wars agree with, would fight die country, today, Americans asked please wear mask retarded pandemic, asking waaaaaaaaaaay much many country.

It ridiculous pathetic. super power, waning power momentum military tech still allowing push world around, much longer suspect, level sacrifice Americans willing make.

But hey, least know America stomach sending millions people (eventuality convinced, point, really would take perhaps 3 years COVID less) untimely deaths still.. got going you, nice. bars open US. It‚Äôs beyond ridiculous point. 50k/day week Congrats coronavirus 10 million cases! salary mean put sweat equity someone digging ditches patching hot tar roofs Arizona heat? Saying contribute earned certain amount cash disingenuous ignorant slap face millions. Eat it. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs mix both. Wish could decide name club. Perhaps get t-shirts printed. perhaps turn micro-penis thing. Like people big dicks wear masks not. least take care dudes. supposed ""bow to"" (take care of) people, selfish prick. America ... world's largest wave pool. Sorry Joe. Time sacrifice business put life savings nothing show it. hey, new Texas Roadhouse surely open place over. 80/20 rule action. Nah, truth simpler. realized outbreak would affect economy repressed news first month quietly liquidated assets. ready allowed panic start up, tanking economy. Stock prices dropped became crazy cheap. wealthy elites could buy cheap stocks liquid assets. 

Then got fill started pushing narrative reopen newly purchased stocks could start increase value again. big short new tactic. Crashing economy pretty safe way rich make fuck ton money. That's purpose. people started convincing others government, interest it, best way deal get rid I'll take ""no fucking shit"" $30,000 minor, too. wear walking around outside, there's even curfews effect anymore places, many places never even saw curfews. 

You literally wear inside stores. long *honestly* going spend inside? worst minutes, probably even think mask rest day. Suck fuck up. personally issues United excuse dumb fuckery. I'll get behind wearing mask get behind getting rid TSA Patriot Act... Yes, starting date definitely something difference. going lately, also testing know. Although took quick look find date June two-week count 23. that's close 20. political parties Norway seem agree open quite gradually. State stopped reporting it, gone lengths reclassify gets counted do. Also, Japanese culture value handshakes hugs, bowing distance...

And government say hoax. funny blame Satan when, context could God's considered will. Also going go route, God likely created corona. bubonic plague taken punishment God... on. Wow assume behaviors people feel good calling subhuman? charmed life able mold reality make feel better distortion bubble. past entertainment industry...

I wear masks right thing do. call people bullshit like calling people know better ""subhuman"" right thing do. Yeah, REALLY going change behavior society better calling people subhuman (not ever face course) ... Senators similar House Lords Congressmen (Representatives) similar House Commons. 

There's direct equivalent governors UK, close First Ministers like Scotland Wales. 

Some Governors taking seriously (Cuomo- New York, Newsom - California, Pritzker - Illinois), several blown paying price (Abbot - Texas, DeSantis - Florida). definitely agree one governors done poorly got it, things would probably change state. car said 103 around 4pm St Pete yesterday close enough lol Japan also prepared dealt Sars don‚Äôt want alarm anyone COURSE FUCKING DID. Fireworks blast away lungs months come.     
America... please build wall. **embarrassing** would kind word use. wear mask walking park? live city, always decent amount people park. two year old try get outside much possible think confused mommy daddy suddenly start wearing masks. way would ever keep one on. course wear masks anytime go stores drive pickups. never take toddler infant places. haven‚Äôt seen spike protests may caused reopening spike. love respect Finland grows every day crisis. yet another beautiful instance Finland offering brotherly love solidarity Sweden. sure would follow needed. Let's hope not. literally hold breath moment enter liquor store point leave. governor idiot. Knowing people STILL drink drive glaring warning light open ""intoxication kiosks / bad decision centers"" state. Western chauvinism. survived Spanish Flu burned process killed 17-50 million people globally. would rather live Mexico US? Bilingual help you, definitely can't hurt. I'm Canadian living US another 2 years. looking forward returning home country somewhat cares non-rich residents. countries large America value freedom much America.

Although hope [outbreak G√§llivare]( soon slowed strict NPIs imposed local authorities, it‚Äôs kind gesture Nordic solidarity Finland make offer aid hope know read like 2 sentences gave up. Put loser trial sentence five years... Japan. That‚Äôs I‚Äôve saying along. Shutting twice make business go business first time. it‚Äôs going necessary half asses first one. there‚Äôs still shortage? know that! lots national news next 2 weeks well. wonder protests anything recent spike numbers. Mild/ asymptomatic Influenza also causing long damage. infection damages lungs. You‚Äôre falling fear mongering headlines article ought either get named removed. know, one side bother scientific evidence coronovirus. Population adjusted don‚Äôt think US even close worst. Well field spit out. Well, part problem though. Maybe regarding COVID, general supporting lot corrupt shit going US. Narrator:

We won‚Äôt. TMC updated informative statistics daily. Yesterday hit [100% base ICU still updated site. busy update it? solve confirmation bias. Yeah you‚Äôre right‚Äî issue really differing beliefs, things test me. He‚Äôs kind person would drink bleach show won‚Äôt kill you, does, he‚Äôd die happily. Wishful thinking. guys fucking dumbasses even arguing this. Protest started when? Around May 25th.

It takes 2-3 weeks patients get sick. looking numbers 3 weeks May 25th, significant increase infected rate. Look case numbers Minnesota. **Check actual data instead following news articles like dumbasses.**

Fri Jun 12 Texas forefront states peeling away restrictions designed control pandemic, allowing bars reopen May.

You need add ‚Äúcritical reading‚Äù skill set. article gives multiple examples states high case reporting reverse early ‚Äúeasing‚Äù efforts. That‚Äôs common.  penis. gender identify male. Whether others gender identify male really something worry about.

I wear mask staying home since March receiving visitors. Yes heard hypoxia. think coronavirus cause severe cases people? Gotta hide Antibodies factor immunity. B cells play large role show antibody tests. talk louder, one thing, yes, make spew coronavirus general. also start yelling more, either anger boisterousness, ramps again. Swedes human (speaking interesting book [""Are Swedes reading list). going to, like anyone else, get sick following rules, even rules recommendations things like happen. kinds things need actual enforcement capacity, Starbrink calls for.  following uk? Lol Hope least asymptic It‚Äôs still disease. Read room. Nobody worried wiping world. worried idiots like don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs big deal going spread ‚Äúü•∫oh doesn‚Äôt affect thoughü•∫‚Äù. Plot twist. unless live total solitude mountains, live around people. get disease spread people. It‚Äôs hard use abstract thought remove tired existence little empathetic. Americans can't act like responsible adults wear masks. South Korea never locked look that's working them. remember young virgin correcting every mistyped word internet. Hope get de flowered soon. mean actually paid services US citizens need would money need military equipment perpetualize endless war middle east come from? like feeling soft swab tickle cortex I‚Äôve seen lot types guys groaned young people wearing pants low, wearing masks around chin.  Ikr. super power shit. we're village idiot. 33,000 lives (in US) roughly 1 10,000 (or 0.01%).

(Before everyone jumps me, wear mask. view minor inconvenience.)

But, *speaking viewpoint society WHOLE*, do?

I understand viewpoint people wish wear mask. They're hot, they're uncomfortable (especially summer). 10,000 people suffer save one life, especially one life probably old poor health anyway.

I also understand viewpoint people feel everyone wear mask protect vulnerable among us. I'm 60 years old - want die people feel wearing mask inconvenience.

There often major differences good individual vs good society. Common good individual rights.

I answer. would nice could identify risk protect better. fair, Trump said would Easter, Memorial Day, whatever holiday said... didn‚Äôt say year. Yes logic one really proves sharp intellect best idea congregate mass pandemic? No. obviously felt necessary personally agree cause. Could done pandemic-friendly way? Sure. knew ass wasn‚Äôt going go protest even though agree cause. 1. work full time. 2. pandemic. However US people right protest regardless.

However, people literally denying existence virus rushing reopen placing blame protests nothing else aren‚Äôt going taken seriously must resist urge save lives Ya WCGW - drunk people drinking confined area Glad sober! even wrong, bars open Christmas now. restaurants going start closing permanently soon lower 25% capacity next week. many Americans opposed using contact tracing tech sponsored government. really freedom privacy, it‚Äôs wanting held accountable they‚Äôve spreading virus adhering masking distancing. mean, get it, society, we're going achieve perfection, many wind suffering disproportionately matter Reddit want. I'd like see everyone vaccinated, I'm also acutely aware politics general mood U.S. particular take stance we'll best can. sister damn *nurse* took state getting 60,000 cases 1400 deaths like ""hmm maybe go trip California Washington every weekend. still hanging friends wedding *last weekend*.

SMH  Got oversupply greed, though. feel bad people without insurance (especially lost jobs result pandemic). one hand can't pay lifelong debt face hospitalized, hand *need* life saving healthcare times like these. Understand, one daughter pearland another rosharon neither leave home except work. Let rephrase that, find little proud American global stage. Yes within country good things happening much good come respond much bad many people blindly accept promote bad. ...how question? see attack ‚Äútheir country‚Äù extension ‚Äúthem‚Äù, rather seeing bunch New Yorkers killed. don‚Äôt care anyone outside immediate circle. speak bit Spanish tried best. really surprised since others said people welcoming, nice. Keep mind, ""hospitalizations 2 -month high"" means little. Elective surgeries general hospitalizations seen steady increase back normal-ish numbers since beginning reopenings, much saw massive declines shutdowns began. Florida going disaster. Worse nyc. Throw computer/cell phone window..
that'll show 'em! called anosmia minor symptom, Covid causing permanent loss smell, taste broken. lose ability appreciate finer flavors, can't tell stink, huge damper cooking people. Long term anosmia subtlety nasty quality life hit. (Source: Lived someone it.) can‚Äôt spend half century shitting government electing people exist shit tax people like Gates expect government suddenly work you.

If you‚Äôre American, don‚Äôt blame Trump, blame yourself. countries together people don‚Äôt jerk collectively stupid government is. countries never elected Reagan landslide, twice. countries KNOW trust collective put aside delusions total swaggering independence functional society. countries‚Äô citizens got unemployment office 1000 phone calls.

You‚Äôve made bed get wretch hack lung it. tora tora tora Maybe hits 50k, people start take seriously. sad crazy time. Well i'm 30's.. never worn mask whole thing happened. put one first time go grocery store felt anxious it. even sure why. really care just... new feels weird. 

But wore it. moved fuck despite slightly inconvenient talk cashier deli person something, moved on. Next time went store put never thought twice. 

The REAL discomfort people FEEL embarrassed uncomfortable group they've surrounded even acknowledge existence problem. put mask on, acknowledging they're either wrong virus, they're sort liberal conspiracy force change population somehow. What's going here. counting noon noon? Friday 8700 Saturday 9k 12:30 think that's many people wearing masks? Cause would make sense someone already denial ""unsure"" might want acknowledge admit we're pandemic wearing one. there‚Äôs bunch Dr. Any‚Äôs Texas judge asking question? onion? solution opening Vegas without shutting completely. people traveling across US (and world) party together one spot. Probally even greater point. Lol NY managed to. read first page? It‚Äôs like taking number dmv. 

We serving b19 eat rich window. Damn right we're focused rights fucking tyrants. don‚Äôt I‚Äôm sure msm donate time.  mean, theory pretty far there. think second government gives fuck life money, paying attention. Well, plus note help housing market. might want check reliability antibody test using Prevelance almost certainly 1% February even accurate tests large probablity false positives. Wait, I'm 37, millenial? Yep. needed victory long string defeats civil rights movement.  Another masks effective, ha? That's UI works state. lose benefits making UI benefit per week,or working full time. Jez lot smaller reasons too. Dad talks way back fewer tv stations. said everyone watched tv shows night would talk school. everything segmented different. I've many times. extra confirm. Safe fuck. Hahaha love counter arguments . Also mom mommy written like : ‚ÄúMom‚Äù like :‚ÄùMum‚Äù : ‚ÄúMam‚Äù . wrote mommy* selfish moron didn‚Äôt understand course. Hey, plenty fellow fatties wear masks. lot us - enough full range responses represented. said, astonished many anti-mask people older, it‚Äôs.....almost like it‚Äôs Fox News demigraphic. seems counterproductive maintaining ratings? research aren‚Äôt providing? you‚Äôre getting Facebook comments? stupid parents? 1% positive case rate testing. lot less states peaking. almost 3 weeks since protests started. would've seen higher cases NY. cases dropping. They've also contact tracing. know want ignore facts. easily find info NY state. MyPillow guy become MyMask guy.

(although, guy batlickin insanely religious even worse trump cultists, gonna happen) Point doll tell facts/stats hurt you. lockdown real lockdown, South gained regions zero cases. others greatly reduced surface except hotspots. 1/500+ death clip. I‚Äôm gonna respond comments gonna put may right. far though, main source seems states reopened soon. York 4180 tests completed whopping 26.3% positivity rate. Casinos started opening June 4th believe. See we're dumb Americans lol. Elaborate abuser. I‚Äôm concerned Texas. preventable. like this. bulk progress U.S. carried minority people

Damn straight *we*

Uh oh Fuck Bill, death rates better Italy, Germany, France, etc. 

We big population, course we're going deaths harder time it. Why? don‚Äôt That's really specific alcohol, though. Oh sorry disagree  Yes. graduate degree too. scares many like her.  many us honestly tried shutdown shut comments. I'm going back lockdown, I'll mask whatever please. long already. make kind things laws. Stupid people rural areas small parts cities stupid putting everyone risk. needs mask order heavy fines anyone refusing wear one. Anyone seen without mask public asked one time put say pay thousand city help hospitals filling up. easily manipulated people started drinking kool aid get rage common sense. Since gender fluid, can't identify ""real man"" even u born female? without extremes either side. think you‚Äôve taken assumptions judgments bit far tbh. wholeheartedly agree chronic weed usage certainly poor coping skill people often relying weed get uncomfortable feelings. 

But conclude increase weed consumption lead leading extreme one favors. 

The world collectively experiencing new trauma led many many people experiencing activation preexisting mental health struggles. 

Logically makes sense weed consumption would go ability healthily aid coping several mental health issues people turn experience overall increase well being. Well, first lockdown super strict. People couldn‚Äôt leave houses unless go buy food (shops sold essential items, couldn‚Äôt go buy random things. done discourage people going much), go work (only essential workers) health emergencies. allowed start going again, could stay town, region. Inter regional banned.
Plus masks thing, mandatory. can‚Äôt go shop, public transport... without one. Everyone clean hands entering public shared space... 
Things like make difference bigger problem thousands cast members guests going theme park 9,000 new cases day. That‚Äôs straight public health violation. define old? heck happened Nevada? report +1099 new cases, think previous high two days ago 500.

How state increasing total number cases state 7% single day late pandemic? Same, year win worth it. suppose thought speaking actually case. would surprised type stuff gets posted although think intentional want someone may started paying attention see take away cases good thing spread elsewhere take risk serious should. Yep, latest research shows new clusters appear mostly kinds parties lots people. You‚Äôre welcome travel rabbit hole. places pretty good job sourcing numbers. surprised that? care themselves, would expect care everyone else?""

the (un)official motto 'Murica think make sense stupid? exactly trust CDC lately. Used to.

If story correct scary bit IMO lingering after-effects hit folks. docs seem handle treatment death rates high. Cool. Cool cool.cool. Yeah propping NY model go somehow. happening across US. Guess get reopen without testing contact tracing capacity limit new infection growth. Comparing US, YES. mean, virus kills causing issues. presence isnt magic life drain. starts fucking body systems homeostasis fails. It‚Äôs like epidemiology foreign science don‚Äôt understand.

problem major portions population actually understand it, refuse believe experts Sorry whole countey many cities. knew virus serious. dont one important holidays Yep. It‚Äôs behavior associate toddlers discovered word ‚Äúno.‚Äù knee jerk reaction selfish petulant lead sickness, injury, death. Watching disappointing level hard bear. Elder Millennial well, concur. concerned well family fun right now. Kids haven‚Äôt left house months. go work back home, that‚Äôs it.

Still haven‚Äôt gotten haircut, I‚Äôm feel like it‚Äôs still much risk.  good day indeed.

Incredible people cannot answer simple question. controversial position say SARS much severe illness, fact, there's arguing it. psychologically uncomfortable. 

Wearing mask makes conscious idea ""protection"". makes acknowledge threat infection. makes feel vulnerable. possibly little anxious afraid. completely wipes ability denial voluntarily wear mask.

This lot harder adjust physical discomfort. Yes do. normal years older people means spend summer fall northeast stay Florida winter spring. Considering travel restrictions difficulties northeast year, may stayed Florida summer. called anosmia minor symptom, Covid causing permanent version that, taste broken. lose ability appreciate finer flavors, can't tell stink, huge damper cooking people. Long term anosmia subtlety nasty quality life hit. (Source: Lived someone it.) Cause ain't cure summer time blues So, words, friend idiot? F√∂rl√•t. USA needs shut everything strict lockdown notice. Mandatory masks, caught without one fined 500 dollars. businesses open emergency services, pharmacies, grocery stores. elective surgeries notice. Make mandatory curfews everyone can‚Äôt leave house hours 5pm- 6am. Set tip lines individuals call others social distancing business open illegally. prevent that, pandemic unit created investigate social distancing violations business non compliance. Anyone found violation would assumed infected placed virus containment camps given clear return society pay hefty fine violating orders. checkpoints people make sure one trying violate social distancing. government set generous UbI offset economic consequences. get vaccine enough get vaccine, open safely small stages spread months time. Many businesses probably lost never return, rebuild them. may take decades longer, will
Return sense normality one day. big problem neighbors mask works prevention spreading less prevention getting it. Pisses people can't slightly inconvenienced. Could deal another semester? think anyone proposing online coursework permanent, makes sense upcoming semester. Run glasses warm water. Itll keep fogging while. also put super thin layer soap rinse warm water alone work lenses fog due temperature difference breath. they're warm, stay warm, long youre breathing least. Im talking Governor Florida, Trump. MUH POLITICS FALL THAG FAKE NEWSSS /S

Taiwan, Korea, Japan end mask speculation

Unfortunately positions earned without facts cannot defeated facts No, I‚Äôd lose scholarship would completely throw post graduation plans wack  sense civic duty anymore b/c they're afraid anything help fellow man help lazy dark people. seriously think would prefer social studies textbooks removed talk social obligations lists privileges. Correct, hasn't, though makes sense given timeframe. said spikes NYC northern states response? race bottom. mean sanders wanted give guys. guys (collectively) vote him. World population ~8b..

USA ~350m

Rednecks 20m-50m

Stop america... stop guy... angry becomes late...deal mongrels still human decency left.. thing rips apart yoir families start ripping mongrels apart.. suggest put island think Cardi B Katy Perry medical experts.

You mean... they're not? mean left comment passing. wasn‚Äôt putting blast. Yes, let's wait 2 weeks check deaths. remind 2 weeks thing post? guarantee they'll well 1,000 per day, possibly old peaks maybe quite (because conceded testing, also testing two weeks ago zero rise cases, there's obviously fundamental shift). draft legal fees fees directly situation taken care you. Think really need put things perspective. Enough said. never agreed pants. wow, kidding me. could possibly happen. time Mr POSPOTUS took office. might rugged individualism showing feel like EU super arrogant this, head US‚Äôs path (which they‚Äôre starting to) face scenario we‚Äôre facing now. might take longer develop can‚Äôt *fully* reopen vaccine rolled out. Really? Ok, shut RIGHT NOW! Oh want that? Ok STFU. There's blood thousands Texans hands I'm sure sleeps like baby every night mansion. That's 9...9/11 events per month. absolutely partisan issue. Source reality. Limey, fear right this. barely ever need Law, need existing law enforced. Sadly, so-called party Law Order Government past decades decided let police decay away. Okay time keep n95 times lmao That‚Äôs good idea. buy cough syrup cashier jams swab nose. everybody dancing cockroach pic now? Keep original bro curve flattened following social distancing wearing masks happens stop following guidelines? going stay flat itself. see. situation doctors holds conversation treat covid countries ? example exchanging guidelines handbooks europe, china, Korea etc Wtf literally giving life saving medicine people. starting trialing UK Brazil. Go back banging pans street. shut could prevent NY. needed spend time increasing testing, tracing, instituting measures like masks distancing.

Basically none that, except testing slowly increasing. restaurants full capacity without masks.

The South tanked economy lockdown wasted it. still won‚Äôt wear masks.

In two years, you‚Äôll see states forcing masks longer safety measures rebound much better. really need expert get this. fog thing happens first figure put right. moved Canada back trump elected. one wants see people needlessly die, based anti science political agenda.

Unfortunately, taking covid-19 precautions politicized sign weakness. so, people gladly follow directions self interest even survival, believing ""helps team win"". WTF?

There's two teams alright, ""less 1%"" control red &amp; blue, ""rest us"" followers. Wake fuck stupid red -vs- blue smokescreen shit show!

How ever get here, could possibly worse manifestation sick broken culture?

The US "" K-12 educational indoctrination"" fault, discouraging critical thinking encouraging obedience ""staying within box thinking"" indirect rewards. broken, obsolete indoctrination system may great producing obedient, non critical thinking, wage slave population industrial revolution assembly line production workers past, failed us greatly current situation.

No person US stupid fucked enough deny basic science protocols required stop deadly virus.

Why many countries orders magnitude effectively controlling compared US? could anything basic education critical thinking skills related?

We country, really need bit self reflection, thought, effort put fixing shit. Yes, 'rightists' spend time inventing things express faux outrage lol  public officials completely utterly touch affect they've citizens. act like idea people become way really quite obvious. Perpetuating selfish idealism ""freedom"" means American citizen deeply rooted society. mess. made bed lie stinky, smelly shit created. New tech, new lessons learned. species, probably get similar hump printing press first got popularized, radio first took off, local access TV stations first got started. issue is, much localized. really developed immune system bad behavior yet current instant, barrier entry, global system. It'll probably take generation embarrassed failure adapt get right. 

The kids'll figure en masse fuckups. They'll alright. Interestingly I've heard complete opposite. Like get permanent residency even setting foot there, mindbogglingly skill-based, really better either luck-based salary-based like lot places.

Canada seems give chance never spending resources you, great way handle immigration. Lol, think race. not. play game division. 

Listen Martin Luther King less Malcolm X. right. Masks dont kill 36,000 Americans every year injury 100,000 more.

Oh, meant right treat weapon like barbie doll. bad. Big pp I‚Äôve noticed also depends store. There‚Äôs low cost grocery store get meat (locally) one where‚Äôs mask. go grocery store near house (where everything expensive nicer selection) almost everyone wears mask. But....my freedumbs?!?!?! wonder could considered job injury? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* suspicious prison business want incur extra expenses logistics testing. them, inmates dispoable inventories. probably profit ""treat"" sick inmates healthy ones. I'm making ... instance ... $500 per day inmate need treatment, $5000 per day.  lived Thailand 4 years making $1200 month little island somewhere. enough save anything, enough live 99% worry-free worry much anything. regret leaving everyday CDC Surgeon General outright lied try preserve supply medical masks (surgical N95 respirators) medical professionals. supply chains locked tight, admitted everyone wear mask form. 

Problem is, tell people bat *masks help, need save N95/surgical ones medical professionals higher risk around infected patients* people would pro-mask. bait-and-switch lie, refuse wear masks point older articles/statements say ""*data inconclusive*"" outright ""*masks help*"" contort something ""official"" (yet outdated) justify way want act. someone Spain due arrive Orlando today, hows going? musician several bar bands, tell go broke set foot bar play gig. accounts, bars nightclubs breeding grounds virus. Lol, smell like smoke visiting Casinos, smell like Coronavirus. understand hard countries ... see example, case study, replicate it. Dixie Chicks changed name Chicks. 

So guess racism fled country. 

I‚Äôm going KFC. Anyone need anything? Karen 'Cough Free Filter' 
White people like rights rigged favor: guns, hate speech etc.

It like black people Latinos protesting masks. Glad installed air vents longer breath recycled air... Yeah, risk staff leaving every day go home. Nope, none all. even daily testing effective saying real men suck dicks. problem isn‚Äôt manliness, it‚Äôs fundamental selfishness. virus doesn‚Äôt effect ‚Äòfuck off, rights!‚Äô perfectly sane consider R0 sickness 3, social distancing, real lockdown, bunch dumbs calling masks satan invention President saying it‚Äôs dem hoax. God love EU every day more, love much. could put ""- Joseph Stalin"" quote would work quite well. way America going come side millions unnecessary casualties...

Does strike unusual? going tremendous collateral damage, terms physical health mental health. selfish bozos refusing wear masks social distance extend lock downs many months. importantly, force schools remain closed set back children's education growth. infuriating. groups people telling people okay self-obsessed self-absorbed bother caring people. tempting, it? take society contribute way? help pay roads, police, fire, sewers, clean water clean air. actually support people trying destroy things resources?

But theft people low character criminal intent. okay acknowledge loud: people criminals stealing us. see many articles concluding different lockdown policies, presence/absence protests, must explain states spiking others aren't. social interaction scores spiking states (eg TX, FL) identical to, lower than, social interaction scores states without spikes (eg NY). absence spike NY can't attributed stronger lockdown policies keeping people home, implicitly, away ""parties"" 

So NY's social interaction score matches FL/TX, protests too, NY spiking? Probably saturated virus April/May hit herd immunity. herd immunity threshold 20-30% (observed serology studies NY) consistent 80-20 (80% infected 20%) transmission dynamics observed far. superspreader pop NY already immune nothing - reopening protests - meaningfully grow cases, unless immunity turns short lived. 

Protests probably spread covid, effect observed states reached HIT.  Okay, honestly interested. clear, say things like ""if that's fun"" interested angry fight Reddit, interested in. suggested Zoom video call would post Facebook. Would willing that?  Bill Gates, he's developing vaccine - vaccines coming Gilead, University Oxford, others. foundation much working treatments, funded massive project coordinate research treatments scientists share information. responsible many recent developments like remdesivir antibody treatments. trades fear point. going last long people right thing. strict lock extensive testing, could time limited operation. right fucking around, passing back state state. Case point, heres one lf lobotomized now. Yes, people stupid, what‚Äôs point?

20% still better 0%. like calls 'uptick' instead cluster fuck really America? thought world  Yeah look happened Arizona university data interupted Governor's narrative. front far. got comfortable data New York early on. Credibility counts. Yeah that‚Äôs exactly is. That‚Äôs terrifying, possible Florida won‚Äôt get bad ny though since assume it‚Äôs less people packed subways? Lol whoops üòÇyou got tend smug WFH job gets shitcanned economic activity fell cliff That's beauty virus, care lies told. 5 people? even easier south reopen safely since fewer cases start with. Reopening fast, without enough testing track virus spreading.

You cannot drive car safely know road is. age equal maturity. Kingston really, really well. Zero cases weeks, believe. predicted, restrictions started ease up, new outbreak popped up.

I'm waffling back forth. people would go get vaccine least smart enough fall conspiracy theories, already distributing responsible cohort. However, even scold people part vaccine (""this 20% effective, assume work continue take precautions""), wonder many people actually understand 20% chance means Burger King can't even convince people 1/3 pound 1/4 pound. ""20%? One five? That's way better even one two!"". president governors telling get spend money America.

It's almost like need fourth round trials tell test subjects effectiveness see risk management ultimate infection rate lower higher. Maybe..Sunday Monday numbers go down, shoot back Tuesday. Make mistake, downward spiral though. DeSantis unfit office disgrace deaths antivaxers argue better get disease shot disease gives stronger, long-lasting immunity.

(It hurt type out.) Coronavirus : war USA history team killing sub extreme, yes. 

But part problem every time people given inch justify take mile. 

Like say small family gathering. Maybe means 4-5 people standing 10 feet apart yard quick beer burger. That‚Äôs pretty low risk. others, small family gathering means 15-20 people hanging 4 hours like life fairly normal - that‚Äôs really ok. 

People need think terms exposure risk. people put proximity risks growing exponentially. linearly. longer spend person certain get virus it. 

And no, isn‚Äôt going away long time. Probably vaccine. doesn‚Äôt justify saying ‚Äúwell ok fuck let‚Äôs go back normal things‚Äù. It‚Äôs really end world hang group people year. Happy cake day low-level staffers around go home night families? Even lowest low quarantined facility whole duration?

Everybody always forgets staff. players, staff. shocked allowing people crowd indoor spaces together lead cases like even saw coming think answered it. wondered like 90% positive tests COVID meant symptomatic. Like someone pointed out. asymptomatic get tested. wondered many symptomatic cases required hospitalizations. 

That way dispel misinformation common flu worse blah blah... Nothing wrong looking angles rules, policies regulations implemented government private entities. Especially regards effect people unintentional consequences may present. 

A lot examples exist something positive reasons also impacts people negative way. I'm seeing LOT people around Philadelphia suburb wearing masks covering noses.

Is okay? think people say ""the protests tied spread virus"" blaming protests spike? things happening right tied spike - reopening country, people idiots congregating beaches large numbers outdoors (like protests), nutjobs resisting wearing masks ""muh freedoms"".. one solely blaming protests here, anyone argue 30,000+ people walking shoulder shoulder Hollywood Blvd ""safe"" attribute virus spread plain assinine. Pandemic hitting x% country reality hitting states much harder states, within states cities hit harder others.

Damn straight it‚Äôs political MADE political. ask think deduce it‚Äôs simply companies didn‚Äôt wanna lose money logical response I‚Äôve seen while. It‚Äôs sad many fellow Americans (if you‚Äôre American) tend think differ. USA playing dangerous game pandemic. country strict regulations still haven‚Äôt case weeks ! That's true. guy Italy saying Spain. Total lockdown. allowed go anywhere. Supermarket, drug store, essential work, it. exercise, food delivery, nothing.

Big fucking deal. Italy reached herd immunity new infectious becoming less US still experiencing increase daily cases (with higher percentage infected population)? It‚Äôs human behavior versus virus.

People seeing much life sucks/their life sucks sit thoughts can't stay busy/busy sleep 24/7 ignore stuff dealt ages ago. NY absolute failure Covid-19 response. Idk could say pretty well straight face. Cumulative hospitalizations lets back new hospitalizations, subtract today‚Äôs number yesterday‚Äôs number. Hospitalizations let back deaths, 4.3 hospitalizations equals 1 death roughly. comment really makes contrast MAGA crowd adores people worked combined neighbors support nation WWII. people depsrately want would willingly go without, eagerly offer labor gather metal scraps, constantly looking greater good. distance wont wear mask others, gave everything others, greater. best interests mind still make mistakes fail foresee interaction. There‚Äôs reason new drug development testing takes long does. Saturday's even yet  ""Health officials emphasized influx cases result laboratory backlog large facility outbreak."" Cant people done manslaughter. vote people in. missing something ? One comments reported 14,000 active cases. me, still large number, even country. 

The thing seems record low number people ICUs dying. explanation (I can‚Äôt read article don‚Äôt know Italian) ?

The thing think many high-risk individuals already died. Unless something treat differently (medicine, procedure,etc)? treating high risk people differently, like providing delivered groceries versus go grocery shopping. 

Lockdown doesn‚Äôt explain smaller percentage infected people dying. masks. things explain fewer people getting virus, reported. 

Any insight would appreciated. could start calling news fine print not; they're entertainment company. People take seriously. thing really doubt already happening before. daily +100 new cases city highly unlikely random people unrelated other. One person infecting family friends coworkers. cases obviously going emerge small clusters. think become media sensationalism report ""outbreaks"". people thought Colbert Republican?

Vegeta, scouter say Florida's daily COVID cases? saw advertisement tv Houston Universal Orlando. spending money get people back doors. Cuomo cites state's numbers, trusted worldmeters really go need it. unemployed, anyone hours reduced. someone can't cover rent mortgage send money there. Put money food banks. Food banks Minneapolis instance huge need food people need. Plenty people know need money, end paying one day future raised taxes. open obamacare, give without insurance chance get insurance, states like Minnesota California reopened health insurance marketplaces. Absolutely get rid payroll taxes period time, hurt Social Security Medicare going forward making elderly less likely able live comfortable life, making harder future generations chance retiring one day. think states well increasing lot protests--especially Ohio. states mentioned lax get-go true. New Zealand gets three imported cases, big news there. ... right.

Have good day. Oh people know. don‚Äôt care. former supervisor tried convince stop wearing mask ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt even help helps around you‚Äù. people assholes think something protect others sign weakness. fundamental rule rights-based ethics every right implies duty, vice versa

Whenever people talk rights, duties completely ignored Extracts Wearing mask required indoors NJ usually shamed don‚Äôt wear one. places need type attitude. I'm going argue them. tell straight they're complicit murder mass death. topic friendly debate one ""agree disagree"". evidence shows populations wear masks suffer more, people arguing masks threat others. point civility goes window.

I lump category people trying get others drink bleach. They're horrible, despicable people need called are. plausible, noted total three months ""you can't leave village"" thing made South never really reached virus. regions reporting 0 cases almost everyday, huge impact current numbers. virus reached South situation would horrible, hospital capability non-existent many regions.

Also worth noting. regions wide circulation, government said regions ""we care, rules nationals, can't leave town time being"". huge importance. want called posts, post vitriolic garbage justifying choice actively intentionally endanger others. biggest improvement nursing homes taking serious hit mortality rate hard. small mortality rate much let Florida get though. public health authorities lie either.  know. common weight. case counts don‚Äôt show correlation protest attendance tracers told ask protest attendance... 

You can‚Äôt correlate banned asking about. Deaths also lag case count likely reported deaths complications COVID causes unusually high

Holding number deaths, symptoms negative effects constant qualification gave

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Florida tested 78,000 people.

if AZ tested many people percent tested +....you would looking 18,000 new confirmed cases. I‚Äôm seeing Dr. Asking area. PUA (the program covers gig workers/self employed individuals) runs 39 weeks, it‚Äôs extra $600 ends July 31st. ""rights."" politically motivated agendas pushed base supporters use thoughts. Yeah shit. global problem. mention one specific country? exactly happen? Sometime first school shootings resistance make guns harder get, emergence superstorms killed people destroyed billions property, trying reduce fossil fuel consumption someone else's problem.

America become land selfish, 75 years greatest generation sacrificed many lives keep country free. Now, ask someone wear mask going store, apparently treading flag. Even including pretty big difference. 20 reported 60 worldometer, even accounting time change, make sense. it‚Äôs true. You‚Äôre shit human, already know deep down. agree. federal government dropped ball testing early pandemic one really knew true numbers anywhere. way knowing whether Houston week behind NYC month behind. worth time. little piece shit deleted comment ever reason. bigmouth someone gave reply like? Mommmy call brainwashed conspiracy shit talk!!! ""Honey delete type something new look smart"" asshole said less covid exist believe science sheep. Go back cave idiot. become american? I've even gotten point I've disabled voicemail. 2-3 robocalls day, leave voicemail. Compared 1 2 legitimate calls missed last year number forget state he's in? wonder people think requiring masks violates rights feel pants. would suspect Americans taught way important everyone else? make sheep. crack rock. Ain't thing leftover crack. Ever smoke crack Friday leftover weekend? Nope. numbers starting skyrocketing DeSantis decides one allowed see anymore. Media outlets reached hospitals told aren‚Äôt allowed release numbers. Gov announced it, reversed decision went effect. received much backlash. stated people felt govt overreaching. feared people would ignore everything order mask mandate place 1 10 - that's ratio deaths cases area, that's flatish curve. 

Houston saying three days ago ICU max capacity July 4th read yesterday hospitals already max. 

And case see deaths doubling and/or deaths rising due lack hospital rooms. 

Needless say, shit's hitting fan. That's ironic. think parks shut again? Like Universal? hateful wish death upon someone doesn‚Äôt share views. Wether right not. That‚Äôs literally fucked intolerant be. Yeah 1 thing agree like took care elderly. friend works main hospital orlando gets tested everyweek deal patients closely twice week. Unfortunately true. hope shakes people complacency dedicated ignorance, turn helps put brakes on. people argue closing shops wearing masks 'we'll hit herd immunity soon rate'. also got mandatory mask order indoors unable keep 6 feet. goes affect 12:01 6/28. appearance separation self illusion. Everything everyone inextricably interconnected. Wtf? data disagrees fair question. Covid virus cannot infect mucus membrane, need specific receptor bind enter one cells. imagine cells lots tiny houses little doors locks them, Covid virus one key: protein spike unlock ACE2 receptor, none other. find ACE2 receptor, enter cell, hijack it, start multiplying, take body. ACE2 receptors located cells inside mouth, tongue, inside nose, airways, cornea eyes. touch mouth virus get in, stays oral chamber maybe bind one receptors (as matter fact, think pretty unlikely well, infections believed directly person-to-person). eat food, chances pretty good food bolus would envelop virus particle never touch mucus membrane all, gets washed saliva, unlikely linger mouth long enough find ACE2 receptor bind to. Saliva produced chewing also contain anti-virals regular saliva, may provide additional protection. food zero risk, considered relatively safe. think Sunday Monday low reporting days Florida, they'll hit 10k Tuesday.

The thing might save funding testing ends June 30th might diminish testing capacity. know situation Florida definitely losing testing sites Georgia.  Asking people wear fucking mask isn‚Äôt shutting economy. It‚Äôs trying prevent it. fucking stupid you? ... Since forever? 

What seeing consequences rampant toxic individualism freedom (to fucking idiot) US A.

This America. seems lots people don‚Äôt recognize mask isn‚Äôt protecting wearer. say I‚Äôm concerned myself, don‚Äôt need it. convince mask protects others them, say well I‚Äôm sick. explain presymptomatic spread.

It would easier adult president could set example. Even Dick Cheney pro mask. Yeah maybe, think mostly American thing. might wrong think rest world puts much emphasis that. least people know. personally find bit strange. I've heard 50% ICU beds available way things going would run beds couple weeks. responding comment Japan‚Äôs collectiveness superior United States individualism.

As example, severity nuclear disaster Japan direct result collective case collectivism failed. masks success.

‚ÄúStubborn, irrational based individualism‚Äù say, decides that?

There many cases history consensus wrong. 

The biggest innovators history often people first considered crackpots.

My point culture promotes individual allows many would consider fact based creative ideas lot pluses. happen became focused rights obligations fellow man woman?‚Äù

Duh, get go. 

This happens build society muh rights muh freedoms. can‚Äôt suddenly stop falling cliff. Thank this! know hard restaurant industry hurting, needs make money, making worse opening soon. going eat.
Restaurants reopened people rushing back really scary way. Stay strong! supporting community many ways!!! Stay home wash hands everybody!! So, basically could go back time would told March self open bars....but know March self listened. indicates larger problem - he's listening people know. Harris county tried enact fines wearing masks, shut almost instantly stuff opened indoors Philly. experiencing surges. think quite reasonable assume massive protests driving spread. would accurate say they're pro-birth. (maybe pro-death too, definitely pro-life) love everyone ripping China initially covering severity virus, turns US probably would done sort thing originally discovered there. Well, might driven incompetence direct coverups, end result would probably same. opened everything time protests started. Japan leader telling people wear masks wear himself? entire portion population fucking brainwashed? Plus theme parks opened past couple weeks.  
We someone work visit orlando family vacation last week he/she several family members tested positive. telling, deleted source :) nothing really new here, Norway allready using military border many places Norway. That's large many border crossings Sweden. police capacity follow-up. Social media fear monger here, again.. protesters disproportionately active FL, TX, AZ? I'm sure protests contributed \*some\* cases. think lot indoor exposures partying. Back dumbass. Yes. It‚Äôs invasion privacy violates HIPPA. keyboard bulky back today! Hooray! sleep well? Oh...and I‚Äôll ignoring keyboard bullying on. You‚Äôre annoying. already said severity pandemic higher. Im talking illness answer question. Would rather SARS od Covid19?  Abbott bad Everyone dies osmodius Brazil done well people posting it. Here, BBC, based UK. people bragging Vietnam. Finally! use statins! Government vs private business. Government business telling must wear. supposed next years sequel: ""COVID-19 - Part 2: Resurrection"" 1600 new cases SC today. 20% positive like seven times seven massacres. America joke. really can't survive 2020 without spending hours indoor bar, probably sharpest tool shed

‚ÄúShe looking kinda dumb finger thumb shape L forehead.‚Äù

Sorry, add light-hearted humor fit well comment. 


Just cause Ameri*can* go bars restaurants doesn‚Äôt mean Ameri*should*. Stay safe. Social distance. Wear mask. respectful people love. Even think nothing lose you‚Äôre young, still unknowingly pass risk, including people *do* care about. Well, take comfort hundred thousand grandparents get live extra year two result dreams collapsing front you.

Thats something, right? Litterally 90% said lie virus put hold riots looting. 5 us family. house large windows. even managed watch 2 parades. (Thank BLM providing entertainment!) Ahh yes-- hard contact sport Golf! There's noticeable difference golf basketball, no? 

If comparing soccer Europe basketball America need realize majority Europe flattened curve shutdown regions cases start spike again. happen Trump gone. Great news It‚Äôs probably inside vs outside thing. never concrete evidence outside major source spread. overwhelming evidence people share closed spaces risk makes feel blue Course Mickey Mouse land open Fla. $$$ government state dont give shit Public officials? think mean Texas. They're stupid af. point, escaping crisis, escaping inevitable future crisis, unless something changes America's mentality. I'd rather stay here, living country people treated like people government actively listens science experts sounds amazing. he's reelected, I'll probably start actively looking. go it; real schoolmarmish vibe fyi We‚Äôve got actual law enforcement willfully flaunting disregard mandates, including latest mask mandate. county‚Äôs sheriff already said won‚Äôt enforce mask mandate. said something similar you. Black person even looks suspicious told ‚Äújust comply law you‚Äôll fine‚Äù White people openly say won‚Äôt follow rules it‚Äôs freedom. already say fuck reopened soon. 
And means push back home loans much needed tack extra months. most, banks lose bit interest wait bit longer get money. 
I actually saw rant video dude went full detail everything government Same, go way avoid massless people shopping. Luckily they're becoming rarer rarer masks mandated. Everyone neighborhood (well everyone know mean) hosted huge parties Easter Memorial Day. see single mask. still hardly see masks I'm driving around look people. really can't fix stupid. dumbass masses die off. Darwin speaking us beyond grave. Millions casualties? stats reading? would thought pandemic caused highly infectious virus might actually increase cases.

Wow, learn things every day! pro Fetus, dgaf. Well no, many places shut opened back April. That's problem, problem enough medical staff existing. Actually easy get medical staff agree work little compensation emergencies, can't immediately manufacturer medical staff needed Lol duh severity matters. there‚Äôs reason suggest someone mild asymptomatic COVID developed permanent lung damage Texas way! no, number cases number cases, whether subway BBQ party.  Narrator: Yeah already manufacturing vaccine. need ramp time there. far best day 10 years, sorta, amazing news day sure, take bit actually get people vaccinated month. day sub ghost town like 100 new cases day US nobody cares anymore amazing one. Yeah, I'm too. I'm sandwiched two major cities get fireworks lol. least apartment far enough quite loud. best way words felt need thank post offer virtual hug friend. think that‚Äôs reason well. don‚Äôt want pay anymore force everyone back. cases spiking... people top don‚Äôt worry getting infected they‚Äôre able live comfortably working remotely. another reason think aren‚Äôt taking seriously. mostly agree would certainly hope that's case I've also read one truthfully accurately reporting one feasibly 100% testing. mention, least US, we're reporting unusually high amount unseasonal pneumonia deaths (~120k January - May 2020 vs ~50k 2017). imagine countries let similar cases slip cracks. Wait saying protesters going cause similar, worse spike cases? people politically ones causing problems go out, protesters protesting shoulder shoulder masks immune all? Interesting perspective sherlock  mod? saw couple anti maskers reported morning get booted sub. No. laws Japanese although yes, political things true, think true spike covid would impossible hide. Yes point to, dying this.

And think know why. look social distancing dictionary Japanese lady smiling page. perfectly social distance people earth. seldom hug even house, dont shake, dont high five, try keep line space them, rise early necessary account time takes line get subway, perfectly foreseeable.

It's one best endowed cultures problem. vietnamese too. always covered sun, wrapped head toe touch favor close face face encounters way occident. learned deal one past jobs. hike mask top nose bridge rest glasses bridge mask. hot air comes eyes instead hitting lenses. Pretty incredible country 90+ million people, densely populated cities long border China done well.

Well done Vietnam! purposely designed flaw people defunding education. village idiot becomes president instead ostracized banished get today. herd immunity nice way saying planned deaths civilians? Washington here, lookin make deal *snowflake alert!* Around time ""keeping Jones"" important. already foresee this... claiming ""Dem hoax"" make Trump look bad (as political organization could coordinate anything big). rest entire planet done this, America riding Maverick first wave still. fuel tinfoil hatters thinking faking numbers pandemic over. It‚Äôs probably inside vs outside thing yes, stopped watch correct twice day. 

every single president done mix good things bad things. Trumps worst mix we've ever seen. Anyone know could find biggest daily new case number reported NY? I‚Äôd interested see compares. Lolol that's funny, EVER war? come MN, state protests originated saw longest sustained amount protests weeks, saw increase cases? Look states opened early states protests. states opened early seeing spikes, states protests seeing spikes. mean protests impact spread COVID? No, mean protests main driving factor spread COVID.

And look nyc! Biggest city country massive protests well. Protests days. Look pictures - huge crowds people, outside, marching masks. many weeks ago. still spike. Every state suffering right one thing common: opened quickly. tell protests worse.  Yup too. Still get every year. [Real Every time strap mask outside door shop 15 stifling, fogged-glassed minutes, look people wear uninterrupted 8 hours straight honestly can't fathom stand it.  would recommend fully researching making kinds claims.

Instead thinking might uneducated, maybe consider Google replace actual subject matter expert know everything. know wild concept understand stick here. 

Mass producing vaccines shown safe effective general populations creates situation might end billions useless medicine fucking vaccine. get safe effective last goddam stage drug trials vaccines fail last stage. 

I'm tired conversations.

""It'll get bad.""

""It come here.""

""We're testing enough criteria still limited.""

""We're testing enough.""

""We're reopening early.""

""No we're not. flattened curve. one said anything declining it.""

""This vaccine going long shot.""

""No, many Phase 3 right they're mass produced.""

You sound like reopen folks. Maybe I'm asshat feeling way kneejerk ""better"" news feed ""it's over"" people make people take less seriously.

If 16 100 people dying 6k it
And 12 100 dying 25k still going enormous death toll. conspiracy. Same, Finland. grandma born get dual citizenship actually considering lately. Sometimes disinformation comes mods. There's one mod who's reason like every coronavirus sub, anti-masker start fights users advocate masks remove comments. got banned r/COVID19_support saying can't wait N95s available general public (because want one), twisted words act like saying want force everyone wear N95 outside banned replied. Oh. might me. That's bit simplistic. India's neighbours, Pakistan Bangladesh also posting scary growth rates nowadays. Russia, peak passed ago (unless parties, parades voting push back up) neighbours like Ukraine Armenia actually faring much worse recently. 

Worst all, rest South America far Brazil is. Mexico Chile top 5 number new cases, Peru detected total cases Italy, Ecuador insane mortality least one city earlier year, Bolivia relatively low numbers high test positivity little testing do. Uruguay Paraguay seem fine. Ironically, Argentina even Venezuela also bad part economies already state little lose hard lockdowns. Damn cold blooded tail wagging dog shit! already foresee this... claiming ""Dem hoax"" make Trump look bad (as political organization could coordinate anything big). rest entire planet done this, America riding Maverick first wave still. fuel tinfoil hatters thinking faking numbers pandemic over. That‚Äôs happens culture promotes rights responsibilities... They‚Äôve already begun 

They adjusted pre existing vaccine it‚Äôs likely safe 

Three testing sites

You chill bit hopeful man course discriminated against. way human societies work.

The point is, make 45 percent population. Thankyou. I'm sorry hear loss also. Every death horrendous virus one many. wish people would take seriously, like nobody cares anymore become inconvenient we're pretending gone away. Obviously grandmother 83, lived long happy life family around adored people lot younger dying way time people left serious complications last rest lives. fair, Joe Biden made exact point last debate Sanders ‚Äúsee how
Medicare works Italy!‚Äù, tables turned  also tried hide infected numbers testing hopes Olympics would still go ahead wearing mask business different sign saying ‚ÄúNo Shirt, Shoes, Service‚Äù ? could [turn back maybe fewer people would ‚Äúreach stars‚Äù.


I know things did, love trump

I know said things said, drunk

Pride's like knife cut deep inside

Words like weapons wound sometimes, case caused spike. 

I really mean hurt you, i‚Äôm dumb. 

I wanna see go, i‚Äôm dumb. 

I know made cry, baby ima die inside

If could turn back time, I‚Äôd close bars

If could find way, I‚Äôd make law


I'd take back words that've hurt you, i‚Äôd make formal apology 

And stay, hopefully hospital 

If could reach stars, donald trump star?

I'd give you, maybe all

Then love me, love me

Like used do, died. 

If could turn back time worthless president didn‚Äôt bother unify country Target write algorithm decides someone pregnant effective even know, don‚Äôt work covid? There‚Äôs gotta way this, even 6 months data, way would least point people tested heads 2-4 years, lot people going look back call unavoidable crisis. They're going say everything could still lost battle battle virus.

Don't let get away lie stay open could last time around. good keep coming üòÅ peoples health responsibility...if would slapping cigarettes peoples hands big macs peoples mouths 300 pounds.... Right? grandparents served WWII survived Great Depression. actual hardships made actual sacrifices. People losing shit able get haircut needing wear mask. God damn people entitled fragile. Cause, murica? dumbdumb muricans? America needs little bit jantes law Wow, described American ethos better. mask protect you. protects others you. do, taken corruption thought pay attention could live lives.

Apparently, that's bad idea, we're paying it. Whataboutism provide anecdotal evidence doesn‚Äôt hold much weight here. live Houston I‚Äôve gone store I‚Äôve witnessed majority folks wearing masks distancing. 

Now aside let‚Äôs discuss reality. reality hospitals room. reality capacity filled majority non-covid related patients. reality room equipment well surge capacity needed. reality death counts declining. reality testing done now. reality sure wasn‚Äôt reopening protests combination both. reality. agree, masks annoying would much rather wear one. scale inconvenience, however, pretty minor considering things people get tough times. Metals restricted non-military use rationing flour, sugar etc. 

It's even obvious Americans spoiled cushy lives, believed face threat people would focus. I'm sad see rot core seems much worse appeared. don‚Äôt want wear mask, don‚Äôt leave house. Seems like every day record setting day. Im getting bit tired reading headline again. Hang town originals? dumb name That‚Äôs Oxford that‚Äôs AstraZeneca Thanks reply thinking this. think may misinterpreted comment, though. believe increase weed consumption going cause mental health issue. believe symptom addressed last point. think views diverge whether chronic use dat chronic healthy coping mechanism. some, maybe, others could interfere daily life. think agree form mental health support would beneficial everyone greatly limited social interaction. Agreed, several friends writing JM complain good enough people regions allowed all. possible public pressure caused close loophole first place, since satement given press seem like mistake. 

More coming, worry. weird corona going 3 months, still know people get infected die instantly even within week.

I mean seriously. 3 months info EVERYwhere, still understand basic things :) Total lockdown Spain, population 46m. Peaked 9000 per day, 2 weeks strictest lockdown Europe. supposed fly Miami today 4-week vacation. Stay safe guys, hope see next year. Dumb selfish scrabble Trump scale back testing well 50k per day happens. Don‚Äôt even feel like answering one bro ""Maybe hits 100, people start take seriously.""

""Maybe hits 1,000, people start take seriously.""

""Maybe hits 10,000, people start take seriously.""

My thoughts every past record. could seeing 500,000 new cases day bet many millions continue crying ""hoax!"" ""it's flu!"" ""open up!"" vaccine **candidates** aren‚Äôt mythical; working vaccine still thing dreams. Interesting point view really made stop think. much asshole top part, obsession oppression need feel like one overcame it. Mitch McToiletsnake

Most people things getting together like normal. Maybe avoid hugs kisses. can't control group, need get together smaller groups. much safer.

But people babies parties unnecessary numbers people get together. There's healthy way things there's stubborn uncompromising way try used to. people died Russia falling hospital window. Nothing see here. Oh one flying around big time. think must getting source, they‚Äôre using kind wording. Like medical professional people working hazard materials haven‚Äôt wearing masks hours end years. Think late 2016, sir I, too, district's fall planning task force. Right now, phase planning. creating foundational plan three possibilities: in-person, distance learning, hybrid two. 

At end July, MN gov announce school plans fall. time, phase II planning focus learning model probably begin fall.

I'm glad two phases (first breadth depth) likely transition different models upcoming school year. foundational plans make transitions little smoother.  No, actually, first statement Danish Ministry quite clear complicated. However, article article utterly failed convey complexity. Looks like someone else posted it! Yeah fucking nuts right now, like 9.5k cases today. went kayak fishing (Away people lol really run many people) way back home around 1130 traffic looked like normal FL weekend traffic. 

However see lot mask wearing people going stores. get Americans. wearing mask save lives big deal? basic common sense. caring others. brainwashing, supidity, both? WTF god political parties it. basic common sense. ‚ÄúYou (18-34 year olds) somebody would potentially able spread virus vulnerable groups,‚Äù DeSantis said.‚Äù

He also said ‚Äúif 25 would partying too‚Äù Heartbreaking. Well, rich people go Dubai, care pay fine, almost nothing them... like virus baseless speculation source doesnt support. Here's another quote article:

""But findings cause us assume SARS-CoV-2 like HIV.""

Yet assuming exactly that. Exactly. think children babies going able vaccinated? Probably hasn‚Äôt tested yet. immune compromised? herd immunity important everyone get vaccinated vaccinated. comment spot on. No. But, guy could brought lunch says, ""I social distanced except get snack""?

His employer say that. many folks following employe's social distancing requirements. later takes ""hours"" tell people it, cites ""neighbors"" example. 

I understand saying, going person claims behavior. boss make hang neighbors stop social distancing get snack. goes rally hangs neighbors ""indoors""? 

It possible person gives rest rally, though assume many bringing in. 

Anyway, guy social distance. states behaviors choices. X 1

That matters. Everything contributes something contributes lesser fashion mean it. *insert bugs bunny sawing Florida gif here* New York cannot ask someone went protest. course cases linked it.

And doubt people voluntarily offer information. it‚Äôs fucking president thinks stock market important tried downplay ignore it. failed, turned culture war ‚Äúmuh freedoms‚Äù Look Fauci vs Birx. thankful Fauci. 50k day? Lmaoo totally concerning. Add seasonal flu fall oif get control. schools universities planning resume. time something like Europe did, seems stomach that.  Yeah China much stronger claim HK Dutch Curacao asking friend stopped reading watching corona-news long ago: situation USA control? Well maybe certain states. responsible here? population? used exact order every time. Mine fairly high functioning, nervous everything, able remember hygenic. He's gonna heartbroken come Monday make stay 6 ft back give anymore fist bumps awhile. Somewhere around late 70‚Äôs early 80‚Äôs..

That‚Äôs America truly began its, ‚ÄúFuck got mine‚Äù attitude. Maybe dunno. /r/thathappened phases can‚Äôt sustained without exponential spread, won‚Äôt work anyways we‚Äôll back lockdown, protests speed week two. guns. love guns. things important guns right now. Like actually surviving fucking pandemic.

There lots liberal voters also pro 2A. Maybe ~Russian~ NRA would start courting parties we'd see support sides. giving fuck fellow man woman American way. Yes scrapped preclinical stage. like said vaccines fail stage phase I. current ones phase III humans injected people. hence likely succeed :) got mask made of:

-100% polyester interior layer
-poly propylene padding
-nylon/polyester/spandex shell

So, synthetic. questions are:

1) concerned inhaling micro plastic
2) Ate synthetic materials effective? using cotton only. Asymptomatic transmission still low risk. problem aerosolizing events like eating together, dentist, restaurants, bars, etc.

New research showing UVC (and thereby sunlight) effective reducing presence air. outdoors exponentially safer indoors.

If get everyone wear mask kind group remain outdoors distanced, transmission zero.

Symptomatic transmission, hand... Even light cough going infect everyone room one wearing mask. end? Serious question.

What obligations others, fair line drawn society needs butt of? None us asked born, arbitrary expectations, ""we live society"".

I take issue others assigning responsibility consent myself. America real problem people thinking they're entitled work -- practical, social, mental -- others.

People contribute society feel good place reciprocates effort put it. vantage point, society extremely righteous write laws subjugate others point view. gets dressed ""civilization"", self-congratulatory masturbatory moniker.

Deep down, we're tribal-ass monkeys, barely socially advanced chimpanzee cousins.  Don‚Äôt moooo-slims wear face coverins? Face coverins in-‚Äòmurican! Afghan Kush lot closer US. Always curious middle eastern weed still shows claims ease vaccine likely overblown bullshit. clearly like look positive side things throw hands negative scenario ends real one Opening casinos opening slaughterhouses virus. 

Just stupid. 

Texas started spike. logical assumption young people infect vulnerable. Hospitalizations Texas rising past week.

I'm hoping right honestly reality based past history first get spike cases get spike deaths. Fauci said much press conference recently. works. Texas recently starting new case spikes. take time. happens, death spike follow.

Let us ignore new york. thing happened Italy Spain too. mention two countries obviously bit politically motivated maybe put context outside America better discussion. country dealing country even handling poorly (i.e Brazil Russia). Personally think many people honestly believe ""it's flu"" otherwise big deal ignored. culture makes big deal lot stuff routinely ignored -- cigarettes alcohol, sugar, flossing, 10000 steps...

I think people get angry defensive probably psychology described above.

And people at-risk categories -- older, illnesses -- wearing mask, staying home, means acknowledgement mortality. That's terrifying people. Even people deaths door (cardiac patients, etc) refuse acknowledge death.

I'm 46. Back March, sitting patio bf, burning stuff drinking beer. got talking computer passwords, medical power attorney, sort thing. realized kind estate planning. scary conversation.

 TBH, yet acted thoughts, to-do list write stuff down, make draft will, talk kids stuff, figure give bf legal authority make medical decisions me, etc. fear. Even though numbers State low, cases rise due tourists Arizona Texas. people continue want throw birthday parties. brother included, throwing birthday party niece really want go know bad idea. recent experience Delta, taking seriously think management realizes instilling trust majority people worried pandemic probably best business strategy. Planes clean flight attendants best could gently remind people (sometimes once) masks required. hope comparing friday Friday instead 6/26/19 (Wednesday) 6/26/20 (Friday). May ""American"" support freedom speech constitution, simply put American true American values, likely brought values another country (as real AMERICAN) would support constitution even meant end world. Give liberty give death. seems like it‚Äôs don‚Äôt care think certain rules don‚Äôt apply time, it‚Äôs group privileged people haven‚Äôt experienced discrimination and/or oppression always gotten wanted don‚Äôt like told do. Privileged people don‚Äôt like privilege put pause. ITT: bunch people think . 3% going dead people actual problem.

It STIMULUS check, relief check. idea get money circulating. Either people spent money went dead people, it'll still government coffers next year. spent it, great! stimulus economy
If not, net 0. Either way, actually problem Re-opening. I‚Äôm wondering first class action lawsuit business spread Covid-19 hit. Sounds like grandparents fled shithole time.

Also, outside. reduce transmission enormously. agree this. problems back end. really amount. flawed processes. Like yelling masks asking basic social distancing first expanded testing first? like demanding maraschino cherry instead sundae. would look excess death numbers pneumonia deaths. one way hide numbers. Denmark same. 

But DK *only* looks Nordic countries regionally. example look Germany whole, look Sweden region region. Right fact Swedes Vasterbotten allowed Denmark. Given around 17 hour drive Denmark tourist destination really, quite Norwegian exclusion Gotland (I'm sure know Gotland one Sweden's major tourist destinations). Symptoms things sufferer aware feel.

I always took small line indication Camacho actually rational, pragmatic fair person. 22 months isn‚Äôt 2 yrs., it‚Äôs 1 yr old. massive difference 13 month old 22 month old.

American, feel numb reading countries treating ""57 new cases"" striking thing worthy major reporting. Wash, rinse, repeat. 

Minus washing rinsing part, cause would actually help stop spread. I'm scared, I'm common sense things keep risk acceptable minimum. I'm also recognizing government dropped ball, downplaying seriousness illness one good. 

Fortunately, live place we've learned little current administration thinks us, we're relying tossed rolls paper towels. Instead, vast majority people wearing masks, using sanitizer, keeping distance public spaces, etc.--and respecting governor's instructions what's opening when.

Just look rising caseloads states thousands healthy young middle-aged adults frisking beaches, going concerts rallies, otherwise acting like world 6 months ago.

I used statistics COVID tracking website; broken age. every state over-reports, many simply reporting all. 

Florida, example, took tracking website want show many people died due downplaying seriousness contagious nature disease. website operator opened page try keep accurate numbers.

So use whatever numbers want, breaking age change fact people dying disease normal contagious normal, nasty things people's organs go away they've 'recovered.' Fake News!!! /s DeSantis tooting horn 1 month ago FL media pushing narrative.

Yet hear anyone crying right wear one, people protesting right wear one. certainly people feel way wear seatbelt usually pretty quiet it. people put one think it. mask different? LOL Taxed money already paid taxes. I'm sorry loss, lost family member COVID also. I'm also sorry apathy selfishness others lead people like put danger. disagree? Seriously, tell me. influence community federal gov. dont I'd like hear thoughts it. tangent end confusing? dont think particularly controversial. Dave Chad &amp; Daniel point discussion - number lives lost U.S. year due motor vehicle accidents 33,000. many people saying making people wear masks save 33,000 people right choice would say thing changing speed limit 25mph prevent driving deaths?

Heart Disease causes 20x many deaths per year. 650,000 deaths. Banning red meat would almost certainly save far 33,000 deaths Americans year. Would support that?

We make tradeoffs lifestyle deaths literally time. 

I think everyone wear masks public save 33,000 lives makes sense. also think banning red meat save vastly lives also makes sense. Protests fine. People can‚Äôt closer that. requirement wear mask violate 1st 2nd amendment? /u/xbwtyz incorrect. look forecast May 18

What goes around comes around seems whole lot coming around days US. get fucking deserve. Well shit. Didn‚Äôt China already story AC unit spread everywhere? idr perfectly safe. I‚Äôm told one gotten sick protests, shouldn‚Äôt matter densely packed in. Hahahaha think point flew head little racist boy üòò reactionary cultists actually use facts logic? talking old roommate lives Tampa today, said people acting like everything's back normal there. bad, dumb people going prolong this. Type II diabetics also high cholesterol put statins. might imagine dietary patterns lead type 2 diabetes may also contribute (a single factor multifactorial disease) high cholesterol. 

It really depends individual patient's lipid panel associated trends. due tests counted person gets tested multiple times. 

78,345 people tested yesterday. includes people positive getting retested, people tested negative previously get another test, people never tested getting tested. 

1,830,791 people total tested. compare yesterday's total, it'll include people got tested first time people got retested. Well kinda validate extreme actions well. place blocked borders, forced masks everywhere, crushed tourism sector redistributed taxes everyone got 7 deaths now. horribly strong, people really mad originally.

Thanks control groups, like NYC (Hong Kong) size approximately, know would happened shutting up. Thanks guys, America lighthouse world :) d) edgy teenagers want stay home day Reddit phds told hospitalizations down, would lie like that?

Americans worried wearing mask rights? Like rights matter lives? history know government took away rights something like past? even police understand communication think press less blame ones actual communication policies. wear mask 8 hrs day work retail store gotten yelled customers say need mask walk around without one cause can‚Äôt breath fogs glasses up. wear damn mask considerate people it‚Äôs hard Stores gone way make getting groceries safe possible. I‚Äôve seeing people complaining older Americans wearing masks. Meijer special hours seniors others risk. 90% masks on. shirts shoes also without complaining. FYI, far I'm aware, issue nervous system can't respond low oxygen levels. actually low oxygen levels tell brain getting enough oxygen, much carbon dioxide. leading theory far COVID impairs body's ability breathe oxygen, breathe carbon dioxide, means oxygen levels drop without brain detecting there's something wrong.

NY amazing job, please notice us world beating thing state Especially since admitted hanging neighbors indoors (likely without mask).  0% chance people like hope weird things really people ignoring fact there's pandemic meeting large gatherings ignoring social distancing, completely disrespecting everyone following guidelines they're selfish. feel you.

Whether agreed not...makes really see fucked political system Bernie Sanders land primaries. year platform relevant would resonated people yet are. happening country? Literally one doctor scientist met idea possible?

Or literally anyone ever gone bar. mean he‚Äôs always liar dirty businessman, I‚Äôm sure anyone‚Äôs shocked point. agree. Fuck him. Sadly pretty much case anywhere Small Florida town here. Record new cases people still posting it‚Äôs hoax neighborhood group. 50% mask compliance last couple weeks observations depends store. Grocery around 70%, convenience store/gas station morning it‚Äôs around 30% best (not including employees must wear it). Ah shit get prioritize economy pandemic.

Hey stupid fuck idiots (politicians?). econimy work infected dead people/.

Idiots. realized replied someone named simp69420 parents ""greatest country world"" rhetoric embedded brains. sort blind patriotism needs stop; younger generations know far behind compared rest world. fucking suck. Deaths coming, course, absolutely previous pace even close. Deaths would already trending significant way aren‚Äôt. won‚Äôt. Yes Norway still *extremely* well, best mainland Nordics terms caseload deaths. 

As say, sad happens hospital. hope exceedingly careful, sounds like will, think good outcome quite likely. still unfortunate happened. think reguations hiring countries quarantine list would make sense time being. Same, maybe I'll get lucky country grant asylum since president followers keen taking away rights crime alive trans. instead hypotheticals cured cancer everything right, look actually did, bad? You‚Äôll get don‚Äôt worry, try active cut portions players free pool money fork billion $$ team choosing. first hopeful reading big impact getting 99% people wear facial coverings, social distance, hand wash, isolate sick could do.  live measures 12+ months probably take get vaccines there. 

Givrn might happening next three weeks, also think wasted money, financial hardship, death permanent health damage gone since March. 

For lack individual responsibility, suppose nothing want believe real unless personally happens you. every county every state need suffer high death rates due running ICU beds see refrigeration morgue trucks parked outside hospitals like happened NYC get it?

freedom, freedom, freedom me. forget true patriotism.

As money spent, sure lot went larger businesses. Somebody always makes out. feds big enough address long term shortages states can't handle.  finally got enough masks PPE, ventilators experience First Wave Part Two? kid xD Uggggh im confused reply this.... 

Unless offering suck care view Instagram. 6'2"" 180, cook home, active work feet, good sleep. drink smoke though. New York well. live buffalo. know /r/shittyaskflying joke sub right? thanks making go check post history, got see real nice picture Massanutten. screamed top lungs. America's response poster child example handle pandemic. countries would wise watch ""learn"".

It absolutely systemic failure. politicians, culture, selfishness, stupidity, ignorance, etc etc. go on.

I'll agree would prefer come Chinese state sponsored propaganda essence article true. US shitshow. even man pulling Bush‚Äôs strings understands [what needs done  That's problem everywhere. People fucking stupid, think momentary relief discomfort comes first. think luckily he's also stupid. Scary thing though, gotta wonder smart authoritarian licking lips could possibly get away with. Looking source looks like increasing quickly even may 25th... seem accelerate all. sure trying show numbers. Trump fine making look bad own. logic prevent unwanted pregnancy refusing wear condoms reduce overall number pregnancy tests. people believing virus Trump supporters. Trump make speech saying virus real people need follow precautions. probably get everyone believe lord savior said it. Fuck people refuse wear masks goi g bars.

That‚Äôs wear hurried trips store, along pair gloves know use properly. point, IDGAF people think.  can‚Äôt see helped yea definitely main factor. I‚Äôve heard friends friends going don‚Äôt feel bad. Terrible people nah, said ""pneumonia"", ""fell window"" Lmao never happen.

They charged now, no? None governors tied Trump whatsoever aside riding base victory. failed people DeSantis. gave IG.. puss puss?xD Thanks America spike NYC/Boston obvious masks outdoor setting kept protests problem like opening bars restaurants without masks distance. really obvious point. Yeah would anyone want walk around store normal times, beats me. Almost bad people walk buy one thing. one pray state autonomy constitution says do. Cuz we're bunch sewn together States sits federal government. that's states leave union sort like brexit states like new york forced nursing homes take sick patients massivly increasing spread area high probability bad outcomes tell. Vill check sweden don‚Äôt want sitting thumbs.

They‚Äôre often forced so, give false info kicked out; it‚Äôs reprehensible. Goddamn, hope travelers least feel pang guilt see highway signs mass urging isolate 14 days. guess people best readers... Perhaps black magic. still lot beliefs region. You‚Äôre really appreciating nuance ended here. it‚Äôs going get better Americans others do. 

First: outbreak started west coast relatively brief flare impacted mostly nursing homes. know Reddit loves skewer anyone says this, old enough relatives nursing homes it‚Äôs go die. may make year two, maybe bit longer they‚Äôre lucky(?), that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs shocking people die nursing homes. 

Second: outbreak got really bad northeast. idea why, don‚Äôt know aren‚Äôt studying fatality severe reaction rates high, remain anywhere near bad even south west spike. Something unique happened northeast, look forward learning what. 

Third: country locks event largely impacting people places Americans connection to. Even middle Surgeon General publicly insisting people wear masks strange belief hospitals source dust masks cloth masks Home Depot. didn‚Äôt say supply issue though, said ineffective. America feels extreme stress, Coronavirus economy. 

And finally: virus starts going away impacted areas unaffected areas go back life normal. they‚Äôve 2 months trying pick pieces lives. it‚Äôs spiking again, deaths aren‚Äôt immediately following, it‚Äôs looking increasingly like technocrats trying bankrupt Main Street political gains. Hence symbolic mask backlash bolstered surgeon generals words. 

So, we‚Äôre stuck. could selectively made policies impacted areas, strategically tried save economy assuage fears bankruptcy, no. tried one-size-fits-all Hail Mary didn‚Äôt put actual policies place prevent spreading again...and deaths continue decouple might find people literally completely ignoring state leaders try make pandemic policy. It‚Äôs Fauci said worst-case scenario. It‚Äôs deadly enough disaster deadly enough galvanize response. Put people front line days watch different decisions would be. Must easy call shots comfort armchairs. money always important unfortunately. Wednesday. Honestly, death disparity due way according deaths catalogued, assuming count towards covid deaths virus main cause unlike countries like Italy inserted datas infected people died regardless real cause death, method accurate? Nobody knows.
The number real cases far superior statistics every single country due fact cases go unnoticed asymptomatic mild symptoms, mean country faking statitics even tho russia seems carrying enormous amount tests day.
And russian lol, feel like needs said. Let's spread rumor anyway. Maybe people actually start wearing masks. spreading lies, then.  data case fatality rate, infection fatality rate. many tests done daily basis, know? almost like...the virus immune ignorance. thumb shit blame Trump want think great job. It‚Äôs per say fault different states different leaders different things. America like way showed that‚Äôs mainly really fucked up. think go start closing borders Well right interfere others well being, allowed, it?

Like smoking indoor. right smoke smoke could kill others allowed anymore.

We need studies regarding Covid mask think scenario. incubation period roughly 2 weeks people follow rules wear masks still get control. nothing pelasant

Shows sad life lol Thanks ur contribution type political immunity?  Thanks laws school year say kids must start Enjoy ride. We're fucked there's nothing it. 

A country truly defined manages idiotic people. America elected one. over. America fucked. Yeah, surprise anyone. always going big deal last long time. trolls jerks sure. laughed platform hid amongst themselves.

As someone grew 1990s, there's whole lot rose tinted glasses REALLY early eras. dial widely available, internet absolute cesspool pedophiles.

I grown men world hitting ICQ solely knowing 15. even knowing sex location.

I people sending dick pics.

I people trying convince mature age.

YOU might seen it, that's old target.

The internet always full horrible, self-centered people, were, fact, nerds geeks techies also happened awful people.

Some may well coworkers thought good people.

It's definitely gotten worse, never truly ""intellectual"".

There lot less overlap creeps non-creeps homes mostly stuck to.... mean certainly mean somehow chased away. chased spaces.

But definitely still around.


One almost got meet him, ""cool friend"" totally gonna go catch movies with, gonna drive two hours hang me, guy must COOL 30s stuck-up self-centered hang kids! parents asked friend taking bus meet stopped tracks, would probably raped possibly killed kidnapped.

But hey, keep rose-colored goggles like. please stop acting they're clear glass. gun owner believes sensible gun laws. modern times, allowing anyone weapon insane, regardless 2A interpretation. That's opinion, opinion many sensible gun owners there. also wear mask protect COVID-19 public, regardless maybe ""infringin mah rights"". Listen yourself. sound like asshole here. saying vet get covid die? 

All calling guy idiot. Actually, look post again, try figure many valid points made. Name calling 3 year olds. Notice u/target_locked tell 'fuck off' bit unnecessary, never personally insulted you. called redneck, trumper, idiot, incorrectly superior, lack brain use, assuming guy hates 'damn libs', hoping catches covid, triggered, course snowflake. 

Who asshole here? gig delivery I‚Äôm going back it, I‚Äôll find remote job unemployment isn‚Äôt extended. went restaurant pick dinner last night house insane. Triage already Arizona. Great job gov! another idiot, whatever. agreed It‚Äôs stupid. logic stupid. government compel wear shirt purely preference compel wear mask preserve public health. data infections among protesters. circumstantial evidence, anecdotes, basic biology suggest protesters got sick spread coronavirus even overall case numbers didn‚Äôt spike.  increasing number new COVID-19 cases across country among people 20s, 30s, 40s, New York Times reported. Protesters predominantly younger age groups.

I think tells whole story. younger generation also outgoing general, indoor venues like bars restaurants places virus higher chance spread. identity theft kind. server feel trapped one grossest situations possible right now.. ISO job work remotely home &amp; offers benefits!

This study pretty conclusive fact COVID-19 *zero* effect transfer disease. hugely important point. Imbeciles still damnedest minimize downplay severity situation: live/die deal. Viral infections serious consequences decades road, look Viral Parkinsonism viruses produce similar symptoms.

You want virus, matter small insignificant think mortality rate is. arizona opened arly may 16,,,  think fair say happens everywhere, however likely larger problem America culture lifestyle. understand. Minor symptoms minor they're permanent. GO Except important understand activities higher lower risk. I'm sorry telling people stay indoors interact anyone go grocery store week 6-18 months idiotic never going work.

Other countries reopening experiencing huge spikes. never shut contained outbreak. know sub deals absolutes ""shutdown forever"" ""reopen it'll crisis.""

It would much, much better people knew outdoors wearing masks much safer cramping bars restaurants inside taking mask eat socialize. died needlessly surely agree. feedback loops yet fully understand consequences of, entirely possible feedback loops result runaway greenhouse effect extinction. Add rising possibility nuclear war resources grow scarcer billions left habitats destroyed immigrant nations survive.

This plausible, possible outcome. agree models say unlikely. assume impossible pure arrogance. look similar other, surprise. lmao ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù work healthcare literally wear mask 8 hours, small breaks minutes. blows mind people aren‚Äôt able wear mask 30 minutes shop whatever. wear mask weak, overweight, mental child, couldn‚Äôt survive 2 minutes shit really hits fan. might work current leadership. Wear fucking mask cowards. Extend $600 unemployment December issue stimulus checks *right now*, insane. Testing way reduced. lying? 7 day testing average still 60k tests. bit reduced 65k peak, still much higher states. Furthermore, positive test rate last 7 days 1.1% means adequate amount testing. really can‚Äôt affect American politics really stage. matter holding opinion.

Here disagree.  There's election coming up, politicians \_do\_ sometimes act. 

For right answer strive affect possibly - opinions absolutely nothing. Thank goodness I'm Canada, order online delivered next day so. Besides that, nothing see here. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Florida Arizona reopened early ... google wear mask glasses, apparently strategies avoid fogging There's lot Ukranian pneumonia Texas believe. Fairbanks? AK?  extending comment individual governmental responsibility.

Both parties responsible predictable results actions. government predicts 10,000 people die effect certain policy‚Äîbut given person particular will‚Äîthen government responsible causing 10,000 deaths aggregate, individually. 1% high antibody results/asymptotic cases. ok putin Texas already +3446 numbers from: Dallas, Harris, Tarrant, Travis, Montgomery, Williamson, several smaller counties. Current record +5927 6/25, today good chance top it. Two weeks many died numbers  also used wearing masks normal flu seasons stuff like that. Apparently Americans cant adjust practical sensible strategy. guess Americans worried personal freedoms part community. always wondered felt alone America, Im realizing reason. almost sense community. Kind ironic called ""United"". doubt, thought seems people thinking ""this spike party last Sunday"" necessarily true. accurate reporting system, less like tachometer car like running average. 

Texas cases going crazy I'm hearing labs backlogged now, numbers go know truly fewer cases process tests yet. u/sweatergoblin That's completely uncalled for. proving u/target_locked's point insults. Make valid counter arguement. I'm unbiased reader thread, sound like one throwing temper tantrum. fair u/sweatergoblin could've friendly. hear too. risked god damn life 8 years insulted? Leave alone, that's right. guys super open minded I'm sure able make common ground. bad can‚Äôt split country like minded folks grouped together. anti-maskers thing within confines even rebuild economy way. would fascinating AB test prove knew along. Yeah, print 

Money printer go brrrrrrr 

Why pay taxes...just print whatever need. 

Since that‚Äôs attitude, I‚Äôm quite happy keep stacking gold, 
Silver, copper miners. gonna interesting see hospitilizations increase current infected population lot younger previous spikes

interesting could scary hell though.... would lose sleep possibility you‚Äôll taxed poverty assholes. thought he‚Äôd love social distancing, extra space make crowds look huge Yes making money working kind incentive go back? Pretty fucked up. One might argue would increase it. think people need understand much worse spend hours breathing recirculating HVAC (""let us week jawbs again!"") air compared maintaining social distance outside people wearing masks. Night day, people. understand indoor air keeps either recirculating sittings there, right? Holy cow! know going on! people need socialize put lives line drinks. It‚Äôs worth right?? there's crisis affects everyone, supply shortage part it, triage situation respond way people need equipment get first.

If war, lack ammunition, I'm going send ammo crates rear echelon troops truck drivers. I'm going send dudes front lines. Common sense.  said I‚Äôll say again, give everyone enact special one time tax take back high earners 2020. Way simpler, help everyone now. It‚Äôs ridiculous apologize labels. Like - YES - grocery stores, gas stations pharmacies fucking essential businesses. provide bare minimum ensure society survive home people enough supplies stashed last weeks/months.

During quarantine supposed going supplies/essentials. That‚Äôs whole purpose quarantine!! yeah - bars, salons, restaurants, clubs, clothing stores provide NON-ESSENTIAL services. need able able go bar get nails done live.

This country incapable making even barest sacrifices, compared made generations. It‚Äôs truly wild, seeing repercussions.   worries. Thanks correcting me.

Stay safe healthy. &lt;3 Oh, reckon back started pumping 24hr cable news propaganda...or earlier. Can't quite recollect. saw study recently used infant flu mortality rates across countries proxy IFR going vary result healthcare. difference factor around 4. problem, course, failed mitigation available healthcare many people even places great medical systems normally. best available info NYC indicates around 1.4% IFR there, serology studies Spain, UK, Belgium similar numbers.

On hand, successful mitigation - suppression - would keep healthcare intact, would also lower age distribution infected. passage time overwhelmingly likely treatment continue improve.

I think lower bound lower 0.5%, upper bound also higher 1%. can't really even get useful range. I‚Äôm pretty much social distancing could give fuck anyone thinks

If you‚Äôre scared stay home fooled. 60% cap really means 60% chance getting sick. mention, airlines probably added indemnity clauses contracts already. Meaning contract sickness, liable.

Realistically, matter. enclosed space people. already 50% chance catching thing. percentage increases new passenger plane. gamble, Florida, people whatever want anyway. Live risk, accept consequences resist temptation look pity fact. know personal discomfort due overweight mild asthma. sweat little breathing little restricted lmao prevents someone breathing lot restricted worse cares lol I‚Äôll suck up. Dude. care, can‚Äôt force get vaccinated. lose sleep preemptively Reddit fate people stubborn right thing, let go. die though, pass around maybe long term impacts overall 99+% live complain everyone else kept getting haircuts. relative dies blame shutdown working also ruining economy.

They learn single thing. I'm Michigan, BBQ [Dickie's, there's one near highly recommend it] place near operating again, recently re-opened dining room reduced capacity, least far could see, however, pick family's order two people came eat dining area take booth RIGHT next people fucking waiting get carry orders.

Pissed off. seats could right there. Least person saw getting food sat window. read ""stupid woman said stupid stuff"" know, it‚Äôs infuriating. I‚Äôm actually becoming quite curious would say responded question. clearly idea much America involved war beginning, frantically churning munitions vehicles Allies using ""neutral"" status excuse get bombed still supplying Allies.

Japan bombed US it, US feign neutrality longer officially joined war unofficially involved whole time.

The US ""save world"", always helping Allies, without efforts Allies, including absolutely incredible sacrifices English Battle Britain, US would able join war Europe. Period.

The US would send seafaring vessels across Atlantic already set stage immediate invasion, without Germans getting indication going on, ships would torpedoed met naval artillery long reached Europe.

Like not, USA __part__ war effort since beginning, single handedly win party war.

No matter much Murca-ass ignorant propaganda heard ""Saved Europe Asia!"", US barely fighting compared people beginning, swept war already well underway acted like fought ourselves.

Ignorance like people make albums unironically titled ""American Idiot"". country got military job. Majority field hospitals set parking lots hospitals set exclusively take care corona patients, student housing emptied colleges went remote malls also turned secondary field hospitals, supposed take mild cases. I‚Äôve seen people wearing two. I‚Äôve seen lot people wearing any. Honestly huge problem lack trust leadership government. lie use, know they're talking about, spread propaganda. People getting vaccinated lack trust government. think need leaders honest decent, citizens would listen tell us stuff. know people angry CDC said wear mask, should. surgeon general saying masks help. course we're always getting new information, sort leadership, believe, seriously hurting us right need us listen them. like boy cried wolf many people. government leaders full shit, know? 

I think big issue that's discussed. going continue far reaching effects children vaccinated, trust medical science, importantly, trust other. represented someone painfully ignorant. I'd pretty embarrassed FL. exceptional level delusion. asshole. lazy quick google search. SAD. services part experience, petty people experience temporarily servant. ""Ha haaa"" - Nelson Muntz already posted pretty dangerous vaccine time. Interesting framers Constitution knew times things could change, hence living document. there‚Äôs already amendment process that‚Äôs used 27 times.

So whoever else thing 2A needs changed, don‚Äôt draft amendment instead unconstitutional laws fly face it?

In many states, including own, pistol purchase permit required buy handgun. Thats regardless plan carry it.

And many states ‚Äúbanned gun lists‚Äù encompass hundreds everyday guns happen magazine capacity 10 (including handguns). Also 2A infringing reason. Look Japans handling pandey see wrong are. one example. Plenty more.

It's human problem, American problem. slug limbs embarrassment free thinking Floridians. Stay safe Nah, can't compare. populations differ, geography differs. many variables. 

On standalone basis, managed bullshit. failed well. Barring couple states, situation totally control Um go Joe Pa! relying Trump saying? said would fifteen cases zero That‚Äôs probably vent covid.

One risk vs benefits always discuss rounds long patients ventilator neurological damage starts set patients immobile long. would weren‚Äôt incredibly tragic. Anyone complains wearing mask never done manual labor wearing respirator middle summer. Problem is, many idiots around literally believing this. 

Including big kahuna White House. 

""Nobody knew healthcare could complicated""

""COVID 19 ... 19 stand ? People know"" Please read commenting. Thanks. recent powerful editorial critical Swedes authorities need stop lying come clean Swedish people.

Ouch... hit nail right head. Swedish government deceiving people almost start. article clearly lays hidden reason behind appeared utterly irrational decisions, showed viewed lens ""herd immunity"" strategy, rational, necessary.

I'd also add downplaying number infected people reassuring people ""safe"" go public unprotected would exposed infection. believe failure Tegnell sees change people's behaviour slowed spread much.

So ended rate infection high enough lead thousands deaths, high enough produce ""herd immunity"" rapidly. assume trying stop spread virus, failed. assume trying reach herd immunity quickly possible, failed.

Basically, failed, thousands people paid price. several every time 90% people masks on. case almost every livestream i'm watching. save bullshit. care pay higher taxes cover unemployed asses medical costs disease crippled years/life. easily look rise cases correlate geographic locations protests took place. result. main rise largest protests took place. reopened quicker callously. 

Community spread takes atleast one month ramp show. happened first wave. seen now. True mean there's shortage tests priority definitely symptoms. Texas - y'alls turbofucked. Wear mask, filthy plague rats.

That also applies us Texans everyone else world. Stop assholes. strange balance almost 2 months. RIP turned around fast I'm aware current events. percentage people streets actively protesting general population still low. May unemployment rate 13.3%, even market expectations. 

The critical mass referring much higher, know is, think bad, imagine 35-50% unemployment top issues currently.

Regarding getting act together, right you. whole lot really November. get takes stop virus...somehow cant get hang act tough wearing masks softest ones. can‚Äôt even endure small discomfort mic worse financial shape delta.

Not defending actions all, doubt AA gonna make think something here. protests turn parties hangouts? 

That's risk would be. know someone sensory issues mask (or hats glasses). says feels like itch never reach, head/face. go places right now. Luckily nice yard stuck totally inside. I've never seen 60% before... seems low. Mayo Clinic says 70%, I've seen studies say 80%. difference public school teachers, least economic lynchpin. Folks cook home. hand, economy goes shitter schools open. 

I'll certainly keep mind budget time.

Honestly, hope teachers states prepared go strike. know children need experience natural consequences actions. curmudgeon increasingly thinks body politic needs experience natural consequences unblunted sacrifice teachers make ""for kids."" Scottish.  Keep proving it. Amazing job Vietnam! Kudo spending millions dollars keeping foreign national alive. 

He would dead got sick UK. avatar American hubris. Everything changed governor attacked... He‚Äôll back ‚ÄúA sign of‚Äù? Oh honey, multiple California counties going lock again. elected deranged narcissist fuckwit office told everyone else blank check selfishness too. Instead 45 signed executive order regarding monuments looks like right, REGIONALLY nearing capacity still room. teacher also idea eating classrooms even real safe solution. 30 unmasked 5yos cramped room can‚Äôt sanitized least several hours? Outdoor lunch needs pushed hard, one even mentioning it. don‚Äôt want supervise indoor class lunch daily expense health. Old people definitely risk., young people also die get permanent lung Data March 16, 2020, report Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) showing younger adults also getting COVID-19, requiring hospitalization, even intensive example, CDC report shows March 16, 2020, 508 people hospitalized COVID-19 U.S. these, 38% 20 54 years old. Half ending intensive care younger Officials Europe noting trend, reports half serious cases France Netherlands people age 50. Income owner. Paycheck employees.  *""As June 30, American also ask customers certify free covid-19 symptoms previous 14 days.""*

How certify prevents people lying? really, REALLY wish WHO/CDC act together beginning whole ""masks worthless mitigation measure"" narrative took hold.

Don't get wrong: washing hands sanitizing surfaces very, important. know dedicated-mask-use is/was best measure along. Every country guaranteeing payroll providing far direct stimulus people US country seems unable take care basic needs citizens.

What think look like 10 million Americans face eviction 2 months?

Riots. True. protests miami incredibly tame pathetic size compared cities Dr Henry going mad, disappointed.  herd immune logic Wow, I'd never seen before. actually amazing Bret think Shawn anything Screwjob, nonchalantly asks ""Shawn, that?"" people think vaccines cause autism 5G towers cause Covid-19. That‚Äôs good point, viruses. Unless I'm mistaken, NBA business that's happening Disney spectators stands. One founders ReOpen Maryland, movement pressured state's governor end stay-at-home order, said ill coronavirus.

""Here end June get it. really make sense""

- Yes science logical, sure mystery, Tim! Lowe's stores. get flimsy cloth mask looks like cut old tank top ear holes cut it.
Meanwhile 10% customers come mask many practice social distancing. many people actually get upset take steps back them.
Although probably I'm south Georgia.... people apathetic stupid. California mentioned medcram YouTube channel weeks ago, San Bernardino guy also imperial counties Wait 4th July. really good numbers that! unexpected. zoomers younger millennials fucking things up. Ironically ones complaining people taking virus seriously.

Where say that?? Indoor mass gatherings masks distancing certainly blame spikes. Outdoor gatherings masks used much lower risk. already know chance outdoor transmission low Proof needed US belong 3rd world countries.

Three fact 5 6 year olds going pay attention much half hour laptop. 

There's studies showing much education kid needs age per day long. goes schools age basically daycare. think (unless i've totally missed something possible) first suggestion probably accounting this.

I'm certain is. see graphs know limited testing imposed artificial ""plateau"" number cases. animation daily number cases listed report FHM:

[Daily see, changed criteria test seriously ill ""high risk"" people, number cases per day ""plateaued"". Tegnell media talking it... course knew really going on.

In early June, criteria changed include testing people ""mild symptoms"" suddenly daily number cases skyrocketed essentially rate testing limited seriously ill ""high risk"".

Now, instead talking ""plateau"" Tegnell explains rise cases due change testing criteria, proving knew along reported numbers kept artificially low. talk ""plateau"", knew damned well happening?

The indication rate infection much higher past crude ""case fatality ratio"". Sweden one highest CFR's world, means either virus deadly Sweden... or, much likely, number cases significantly under-reported rest world.

Put simply, hiding number infections talked public ""cases"", quietly watching number infections increase rapidly - assumed ""herd immunity"" would reached soon.

[Here another animated graph showing total number toward end animation rate increase speeds up? happen ""plateau"" - rate increase would slowing down.

[As deaths, another animated see rate increase slowing. 1000 deaths every two weeks 1000 deaths every three half weeks (ignoring lag reporting). That's great news, wonder much due doctors knowing much treat COVID-19 April...  imho wv skirting luck alone right now. cross border pa regularly like night day. masks. social distancing. obese population. WVU really going open fall extremely worried. they're Trump made masks political ship sailed, giving local municipalities control could happen. almost certainly lower death count amount cases would resulted months ago New York, yes, we're finding better treatments, make comment wrong.

The death count likely start going next couple weeks, although much I'm sure. Hopefully lot, I'm optimistic clearly are. guy dumb fuck. USA going post apocalyptic country months. virus wipe idiots hopefully leave smart people took serious protected themselves.  order magnitude numbers Utah Florida 2-fold difference numbers normalized per population Utah Florida.

It make sense look commonality can't contact trace 5k new infections per day rising.

You lock things get minimal amount new cases reopen contact tracing. rights worth risk

Shutup biased nonsense. Well still pandemic five years now. true? I'm actually pretty calm accepting quite lot dead lung damaged Americans.

I guess well, agree that. Spiking moreso That's true, point people dont care good luck efforts now.... tighter people actually listening.   much fun taunting us north like figured out.  thanks BLM protesters. fair comparison 4 months ago w amount tests available? say Floyd's assassin killed lot one american? kidding?! related protests? Trump‚Äôs fault? love racist bigot thrown around all
Conflated virus. many don‚Äôt take seriously. politicization virus. soon Dems sniffed angle impeachment didn‚Äôt take....they‚Äôve running ever since. contact tracing violation privacy HIPPA, it‚Äôs easy dictate like China countries. Thank God. Yeah, i'm worried grandparents, uncles, aunts, just- everyone can't protect themselves. virus really scary. also moderate asthma, may bit bad  Last heard, another stimulus check table. Things could change based bad economy gets. I'm honest, one time anti-vaxxers right reservations vaccine. 

it's crazy conspiracy theories vaccines around decades safety data millions/billions uses.

but eh, vaccine rushed 3 stages administered less year? knows long-term side effects could be. prostitute guy? Physically I'm taking seriously I'm ""essential worker"" work lots people, one circled got sick able forgive myself. mentally I'm far past it. Loads people taking seriously. state feels like ""did job"" stop wearing masks start fun again. hard take seriously anymore, everyone know feels same. Whatever's gonna happen gonna happen we're beyond point convincing people slow spread. Wish us luck. Yes do, even assume wearing mask 0 effect catching someone cut chance spread half. critical thing thst everyone needs wear many people know it.

A dead simple example thst can't understand one help you: 2 people. 2. One people virus one doesn't. one? know. Now, neither wears mask transmission nearly ensured. 1 person wears mask cuts transmission half one direction, since know cut transmission 1/4 possible situations. parties wear mask cuts 1/2, depends person infected always wearing mask well.

Wait, prove uninfected people wearing mask actually reduces spread? Yes, world imperfect information certainly have. POTUS wants would even less information go mandatory masks everyone even important. know exactly doesn't, want better result possible situations everyone needs wear mask. EVERYONE.

The funny thing is, extremely good testing tracing could actually reduce mask wearing overall would effective trying suggest everyone wearing mask completely shit testing. AMERICAAAAA - FUCK YEAH People going disregarding safety norms fellow citizens.

These people indirectly committing murder. ""Once get forever maimed virus""

Yet vast majority people get asymptomatic mild cases, lasting symptoms.  try Stop watching news They'll protect vaccine. They'll fight one.

But care others. wear mask cause protect them, others. Scientists never wrong? saying case can't claim definitive answer anything regards outbreak. They've wrong many occasions since onset pandemic. 

Also Abbott spineless playing games local leaders. common sense important. Europe likely ban Americans soon well believe. Can‚Äôt people coming shithole countries.  Thinking thing Missouri!  least get control now. Good job there. Definitely zero. reports satellite evidence China experiencing surge hospitalizations 1-2 months reported virus. say data invalid also live US, Brazil UK... discredit rest way add emotional reaction attempted insulting garbage talk add assumption it.   ‚ÄùNo, isn‚Äôt issue, let‚Äôs cut testing funding this. ‚Äù

Hopefully Darwin principle purge assholes existance. Fingers crossed. Sorry, don‚Äôt speak language Shiiiiiit! planning going protests weekend absolutely, damnit mean absolutely NOBODY practicing social distancing wearing masks. I‚Äôm shocked right now.  ignorant, *proud* ignorance. militantly loyal Trump fiercely afraid ‚Äúliberal agenda‚Äù ‚Äútake away freedoms.‚Äù Tbf there's speculation alot viruses trigger diabetes. 

After rotavirus vaccine introduced added schedule, noted declines T1 diagnosis youth. 

My partner T1, watch kind things toddler's sake. death sentence, holy fuck want live it. article beginning states 'we know' - goes speculate dates countries, however ""It important keep mind unlikely Thailand confirm anything last minute.""

Apart wishful thinking author, runs tour company apparently, zero indication Thailand open borders anytime soon. Good. hope keep country virus free - tourists damned. ‚Äúwere‚Äù hahaha already back bigger before...? Louisiana. Everyone forgets this, fastest decline country one first epicenters post-Mardi Gras. Please leave reviews online concerning behavior.  Businesses anti masks need shut down. I'd willing bet employees healthcare customers do. 

I think major part disconnect.  customers ALWAYS health care. healthcare 17 joined Army. employees grew like me. pay insurance. Staff used getting sick fixed mindset concerning health.  Customers know insurance cover cost okay putting others jeopardy fully understand/ care true cost staff. 

Honesty, I'm trying number employees.  lost one four years ago drugs I'm losing one covid. people definitely need take seriously 13 year old probably (99.9% chance) going okay even get it. I'm worried people gathering indoors masks on. God forbid government actually try keep us safe lol. Damned do, damned surprised all?  Stupidity exclusive states. act like country fair share stupids southern states right. Cali, Fla, Ari, Ga fueling new wave.

There protests around country spikes everywhere, not? Answer: mentioned states opened earlier haircuts.  I‚Äôd like note every single person got $1200 US could still get employment needed. 

In Canada $2000 easier apply EI benefit taken unless needed. 

So really it‚Äôs $1200 + harder get EI vs $0 + easier get EI social distancing, average age infected cut half, lined perfectly incubation period.

There's fucking evidence. I‚Äôm seriously impressed there‚Äôs place called Chilliwack. thought Australia weird place names! 55 million hits H1N1 numbers. many catch common cold every year? many die... ELI5  Thus tone leadership president would made difference. made political. Even simply, walk street naked? No? Stfu. Well good job. Enjoy it, arrogant bitches. UK next think BLM rioting, looting, protesting made number cases better worse? us antivaxxers good reason. 2 people family died hours receiving flu shots past 10 years. Add that, autistic son could also kill. Add friends son completely normal got vaxxed. cant speak, even essential functions like go bathroom himself. crazy ass people. us good reason it...and suggest anyone wants vax good hard research theyre actually injecting first. ‚ÄùI‚Äôm man, supposed do?‚Äù/s  makes think met doctors scientists?

They're willing accept crazy explanation theory except logical scientifically sound one. Lol else would for? believe German scientists proven trying remove millions bodies, cremation better choice large pits. coronavirus deniers 

Agreed. would anybody think hundreds protests social distancing would lead anything this?

Blood hands now. Bang job wokesters. make see us lock down. Everyone see He's right. I'm truly disappointed federal states government fucked bad. yerp. cheers mate they? I'm still seeing shitload idiots refuse wear masks. There's way stupid. literally refuse believe it. know, know, Florida man stuck two weeks ago things flatter. Typical American reaction. something somebody else? article states social distancing outside protests increased protests simultaneously admitting protestors social distance. 

The decreased social distancing protests *offset* people distancing outside protests. Thats justification use article. okay *you* spread virus long *everyone else* right yes, liberal media literally says okay spread virus. Can't dictator w/ ppl dictate sympathy stupid people. Maybe doctor then. test talking about, both? believe already know immunity months studies saying. One first things look antibody test made, would number antibodies time. way information known yet. fully conclusive yet, must already know odds. judge leadership? factor number deaths state calculating this?

For instance, Gov Whitmer Michigan widley praises leadership, state 6100 deaths

While Texas 2300, similarly Florida 3300

So 2 biggest problem states less total deaths combined Michigan. 

Yet one praised others derided.

Absolutely ridiculous. I'm pro-lockdown, pro-mask, pro defeat fucking thing. no, fuck extreme. 

Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, South Dakota, DC, Vermont steadily declining. There's reason lockdown like that. 13 states 50 daily cases. 

The south needs put time-out. needs extreme lockdown beaches, grocery shop. ain‚Äôt salt life then. culture America rooted obligation rooted individual. may disagreement among people, one thing ever counted majority one time first lastly motivated interests.

I see nothing wrong this. US lock enough severely harm people‚Äôs livelihoods businesses, enough stop virus and, time, try use politics shame effectively promote masks. could done short effective lockdown, it‚Äôs probably late given massive community spread. could promote masks politicians, medical advisors, CDC news media apologize misleading population mask effectiveness, use positivity instead shaming, give free masks stores instead threatening fines, massive concerted push wear masks preserve front-line workers end lockdown restrictions. 

Since today half-assed measures harm shame, combat virus, order puts onus individual wear masks, state effectively supple promote masks, feels like violation rights. absolute sure people actively infected NY peak Florida Texas currently. Brazil 40k cases 40% positive test result right now, infections significantly higher despise slightly lower official number. see mask guy picture. Irony hypocrisy? None done either bars riots. live work Houston. work mental health. anecdotal evidence supports due rioting. client load dropped 75%. one clients sick Covid-19 attended riots Houston bars. Yep 80 IQ BLM protesters Ouch, yeah surely lead infection spikes?

Like honestly, Sweden's neighbors want distance themselves, they're rather half-assed work it. gonna worse weeks long block party smoke effects gym class activities provided free police free. Restaurants nowhere near packed protest. We've seen aerial shots huge crowds.

Both idiotic. Mask wearing nearly universal NYC. many protests last weeks. people saw wearing masks police officers. Maybe protests south mask wearing isn‚Äôt prevalent bigger spreading events. recomendations wear mask Sweden, seen heard anyone ridiculing anyone wearing mask. generally trust managers coworkers keep safe


Big mistake man, gotta keep safe rely others - they're human prone mistakes. Even take necessary precautions, happens spouse brings home bring work. Can't careful. Wrist band?

""can asymptomatic sick?"" wear mask jackaninnies. think boils half country internet 25 years half maybe 10 less, starting predominantly facebook social media. seem question anything read ever consider they're reading targeted technological sophistication probably social construct. that's data says. filled viewers heads insane conspiracy theories, bad science straight-up lies 4 months now. can't undo brainwashing know wrong people die due it.

Also, try convince viewers ""despite fact world calls idiots, inside knowledge makes right sheep wrong"". fuels search places believe something odds prevailing theory bizarre way feel superior even objectively inferior due exact belief. afraid live age nothing matters unless enforced. distance people, whether inside outside. Four people sitting four corners basketball court danger.

If daughter fighting tooth nail would died.

So many people die like this? anything place prevent kids catching do? wonder?  Oi guys Sshh! 

Please say C-word...I hate lockdowns! *40% gobbles stock shorted pandemic. overwhelming evidence that, makes article disgraceful plucking single one pieces evidence citation. Learn joke is. spread misinformation. career integrity Fauci, realize fucked been. med school entrance exam yet canceled like April goes show back square one worse parts state. right thing literally undid sacrifices healthcare professionals essential workers matter weeks. happened, Dr. Fauci still let rip.
When people actually lead example lead? Cut water supply. don‚Äôt need government apparently don‚Äôt need water. almost one-fifth came single state: Florida.

Florida almost 9000 cases day (8942).

At rate,Florida track break New York's record high (which country's record high) 11,571 new cases day sometime next week. kind random, updates happened Quishi? I‚Äôm seeing anything within last 2 months, saw let journalist go finally.  Nothing see here, runaway infections state 20 million people.

Remember, NYC locked 3,500 cases day peaked 11,000. FL almost 10k lockdown sight. don‚Äôt know life situation is, highly recommend mr money mustache. blog early retirement, exactly that. ok, lots states trending downward, US big place... putting Florida numbers today (+9600) context, NY reported cases exactly 4 times...several weeks mask order went effect.

that's it. 

assuming testing capacity exists, Florida going set new record, soon week. can't work way. Even infraction ticket, right hearing order challenge ticket Sure  forget dash Death Sauce side Panic. report total hospitalizations reasoning reporting active hospitalized? must info? Unless keep printing money giving away inflation going skyrocket. Government also contain spending. yup I'm proud bit surprised fellow MD'ers acceptable let dumbasses endanger lives people community actively spreading deadly pandemic refuse put piece cloth dumb face. 

Disgraceful. Truth! Problems seem simple solve sometimes. 643 hit new record coronavirus cases Saturday, reported 9,585 cases 24 hours.  Department Health says 132,545 people tested positive COVID-19 since pandemic began.  least 3,489 people died virus-related illness Florida, including 99 outside state.  statewide numbers Saturday broke previous record 8,942 set Friday. Same. know retail hell thing made viewpoint mean get awful thoughts pandemic feel guilty it. headlines sensational. article filled good information starts ‚Äúmajority neurological issues headaches, confusion, etc.‚Äù ends 1950‚Äôs memoir quote UK influenza outbreak implying ‚Äúthose suffered became lifeless zombies decades‚Äù.  one way another probably is.

Wait red bloody? Tell please.

This right here. Basically everyone agrees minimum clothing requirement pants, shirt footwear. exactly big fucking deal tweaking requirement slightly temporarily? Florida even stopped elective surgery? Surprised pikachu face grandpa got 2 years retired. Total paralysis. hospital 6 months. Eventually regained gross motor functions fine motor. Pretty crazy see. Glad able get it. (ok... we) don‚Äôt think social distancing they‚Äôve got buzz on. Doctors know Texas told infected something common: attended bar, protest, went tubing. Yeah, Sure.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean there's overwhelming evidence spread largely caused groups people INDOORS without masks. understand might feel way. Harm reduction hard pill swallow. Prohibitionist hardline approach drugs seems feel like best strategy, harm reduction approach reality ends less death overall. seem counter-intuitive, fewer deaths overall always better deaths opinion.  scientific community ones do. Everyone needs wear mask outside house, 100% time. Period. exceptions. Americans dumb believe medical experts. \#boycottNBA

What dangerous stupid. basically pro-Trump. Oh btw forgot Turkey lockdowns already mostly lifted even existed weekends sometimes day two more. proving point ignorant moron. Looking dashboard, right bar graph. looks like today might higher? might glitch? Site loading properly. know they're safe? I'm scared take anything without long term safety trials. would bad decision. concerned sued outbreak occurs? Extensive, interesting article. political. made political calling political. Thanks muzzling free speech though. Yikes. What... What? election middle this? Terrorists worse virus duh /s surprised population protesters wearing masks, huge chunk wearing incorrectly (especially heat). day day experience, can't count number people I've seen nose sticking mask, wearing mask chins nose mouth uncovered. That‚Äôs public, including you, disillusioned. honestly believe people protesting fighting police numbers far higher called party restaurant nothing spike cases. Cmon bud you‚Äôve gotta little intelligent that. seeing that? seeing 12.82 among new cases, 14.36 overall day.

Lol. ICU admissions hospitalizations roughly 1/3 peak. never reached capacity, used outspoken goal goal posts shifted ""confirmed cases"", highly arbitrary number based testing capacity.  
 
Yeah, totally worried. slightest. lets see Norway ends start opening again. keep fingers crossed vaccine (lol) cure (lmao) they'll ""enjoying"" bad case common flu long, long time. It‚Äôs amazing terrifying plain sight. feel like every horrible thing gets swept rug 0 consequences. also can't mention someone's intelligence. I've docked twice suggesting folks bad critical thinking. One even flummoxed human mod. ICU numbers normal, actually. misinterpretation. guess yesterday blip new normal. Best luck forced pressure cases No, implying real voter suppression, adding voter fraud, GOP sites part reason they're committing voter suppression, actually happening. I'm pretty sure source supports assertion. Thats works Wisconsin, usually THursday, Friday Saturday high number days here. Yes masks work.  Fauci knew back March told us wear masks. areas massive spikes tied areas massive marches? No. they're not. 

But go ahead pretend want push beliefs.

This really hard see bother looking data. correct, goes show much attention people paying. masks protect YOU. protect EVERYONE ELSE AROUND blocking RESPIRATORY DROPLETS leave mouth. Everyone wearing mask. people wearing masks endangering everyone else around them.

In world, wearing masks would significantly susceptible wearing them. Sadly, take precautions others yet still get sick others you. I'm glad I'm one noticing Wearing mask political ideology. cannot happen / local healthcare system collapses. Denver might close now, open schools get bad. Id freaking you. People idiots taking seriously. I'm calling shit dense turd nugget. ‚ÄúWillful‚Äù key word here. abundance vetted, peer-reviewed, current information available educate oneself. deniers, whatever reason, choose that. Didn‚Äôt end needing bailed end going get massacred white walkers? Hmmm LA? Oh doesn‚Äôt fit narrative. 

Also lot states opened mid May. Florida opened ton businesses May 4. Nothing month. I'm Canadian dated American several years. would always point things America best at, best musicians, players, etc, always make fun Canada. whole american number one schtick got rather tiring while. love Canada point everyone things make us great. really made realize different are. Despite still read lot crazy people trying use flu example COVID lot BS even conspiracy... estimates **influenza** associated 35.5 million illnesses, 16.5 million medical visits, 490,600 hospitalizations, 34,200 **deaths** 2018‚Äì**2019 influenza** season 

35k deaths entire year 128k dead less 4 months. 

Shit - people convince anything scares future anything. people vote affect futures. enough cause revolution democracy starts costing lot lives looks like could be. don‚Äôt understand part every school district country saying they‚Äôre going open two months confusing Texan elementary age kids... fuck Texas.  parents boomers millennial, parents gen x probably eat tide pods.  Congrats, Florida! So. Much. better. Technically truth Although I'm much pro-vaccination I'd rather wait see first round two vaccines humans make one within year like they're saying. News articles mostly puff pieces. looking hard data, check studies sister site /r/COVID19 interested amount infected.

I supporting scientists, although interesting, amount positive testing indicator lack understanding virus people overly concerned indicator testing rates. higher NY Pop culture terrible thing America. media sucks balls. word done Florida battle upcoming surge? Wuhan build 26 make shift hospitals field hospitals...is Florida anything similar? going let hospitals get overwhelmed flooded? insane considering I'm UK almost 3x population Florida yet far worse every day one counted bunch old cases even day 1000 less new cases this. also sent rowboat Hmm... well stayed hotel Decatur (right outside Atlanta) 2 weeks ago saw ""normal"" hotel guests (e.g. middle aged white people appearing vacation kind possibly staying nearby Emory Hospital type health care). see homeless people make blanket statement like suggesting every hotel Atlanta (or given city) going homeless people little bit exaggeration reality ground.  Yeah, fucking fireworks people shooting last month ongoing investigations IVO hospitals early - yes.

Can confirm. IVO (Health Social Care Inspectorate) looked found systemic abuse.  
 
Plus point would braindead claim something else we've gone 80% capacity roughly one third that. conspiracy theories appeal peak capacity (I personally got sucked in) point one would essentially claim multiple independent branches government cahoots doctors, nurses elderly care workers facilities killing elderly fun pragmatic reason behind it. kill them... because.  
 
You'd absolute moron believe that. afraid numbers going today. Even lower, probally weekend, spike upward next week. Actually, think way around. rural whites set ways diminishing demographically days. Texas turn blue next ten years

Still, talking many millions people millions children millions grandchildren. Usually, children better parents America 2 million cases coronavirus there's 6,000 people world? Indiana here. requirements. It‚Äôs highly suggested required. find strange TMC, arguably one largest medical centers US, capacity take new patients major hospitals equally hard hit places florida LA California still holding on.

The worrying part takes weeks rise required beds even levels (let alone drops), even curve flattened tons people still need hospitalization weeks come. higher plateau, worse gets. addition, applies serious mitigation measures implemented enforced yesterday rather today. 
 
In words, situation fucked *way* beyond even wildest imagination. zero inmate coronavirus cases prison throughout March, April May. Today, 500 infections. Oh okay. realize superintendent Denver school system here. zero sum game certain point too, every bed corona bed taken away MI, stroke, big killers. Thinking people won‚Äôt follow basic common sense brainwashed doesn‚Äôt sound idealistic me. Honestly, know generation taking seriously millennials. older folks certainly aren't, younger folks streets. think media idea millennial is, catch-all term young people.

I mean, wife millennials house kids jobs take precedence going fuckheads. far tell, friends spot. There‚Äôs (unsubstantiated) claim Winston Churchill said ‚ÄúAmericans always right thing, they‚Äôve exhausted every option.‚Äù Let‚Äôs hope make there. one ever said houston's hospitals full. one hospital biggest full. misinformation spreads people get doubt. Quantifying solely based rate increase astoundingly stupid lacks context. Miami still cases. also stringent masks rules state. many factors playing rate increase, acting like people packed like sardines streets hours time can‚Äôt contribute rise cases myopic biased. top that: took NY 3 weeks locking go \~2600 hospitalizations peak \~19000 hospitalizations.

**A 6 times increase.**

This get much worse Florida. Ever wash clothes discover left pen load? checked pockets removed pen first. Getting rid aftermath stains hard. It‚Äôs kind counterintuitive decline outbreak (as saw US northeast) death numbers seem tell story, beginning outbreak (like sun belt) seems new cases watch. article time! No, I'm listing reasons distance learning viable solution schools reopen. Nope. fact, told tv station thinks deserves money. Sub rules dictate able change headline via post title. I'm sure could done differently there.

If think previous studies can't inform similar subjects I'm sure tell you. Obviously 1=1 correlation understanding viral spread population carring percentages percent people feel sick enough visit doctor viruses seems like reasonable place start. know significant portion people get virus called ""asymptomatic"". mean feel symptoms symptoms weak feel sick enough visit doctor get tested? Either way seems similar discussed within article people get sick never get diagnosed cause feel ""ok"". science start square 1 everything draw assumed knowledge could translate study, proven wrong, we'd never build understanding anything. knowledge builds came before. Since judges opinion ‚Äúobligations‚Äù override rights?

Yes, masks beneficial. No, government cannot mandate them. !remindme one year lockdown beginning, one thought economic damage much bear. believed could gotten away swedish approach .. asking people adopt measures like masks social distancing. Evidently wrong. devil's spectacles new band name buy that. Take resistance wearing seat belts. People wear seat belts subconsciously afraid car crashes denial. wear inconvenience knew odds needing one actually pretty small.

Masks pretty much same. They've told chance dying practically insignificant healthy individual.  choose ignore based people taking precautions don't, could get slammed odds dying go way up. ignores lot negative side effects death worth avoiding. ignores fact may good chance surviving, could easily give someone else who's odds much worse.

They ignore things selfish. calculate personal odds decide worth it. Whatd say? listen response big yikes, thought smarter tbh Seriously? would insane. mean elect Mike Pence governor, guess level idiocy possible. Coincidentally president would sign bill owns numerous hotels...   cry! touch face wipe tears may transmit know what! course happen facebook wear mask deniers. wonder anything else going around American cities bringing mass groups people together. 

Liverpool winning league mate coronavirus happened  New York shut long number point you? absolutely is. Native Texans urban suburban areas could turn Texas blue EASILY. counterparts back hometowns never left transplants California keep red enough.

And anyone questions that's typo, yes, Californian transplants Texas average conservative native Texans. Sucks right move Airlines afraid angering Trump. trying get government bailout.  Really great piece! friend mine grad school recently book published vaccine resistance, focuses similar questions language communication framework (our discipline Rhetoric). imagine really amazing trans-disciplinary work coming this. comment wasn‚Äôt removed...and yes, ofc I‚Äôm mask laws. It‚Äôs stupid thing fight over.

And laws forcing people stay home violate 1st amendment, laws preventing people carrying violate 2nd amendment. Many places tried both. un fucking real

our governor can't keep ignoring  Masks political. Insisting cause spikes is. virus real *and* governments handled poorly, *and* used pandemic excuse push shitty pet laws people busy dealing fallout?

Never let disaster go waste. slimy politician corporatist, anyway. :P Sadly Betriebsrat. HR pretty good shitheads sometimes that's that. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*  president politicized this. really answer. dad said overheard bunch ruckus neighborhood last week.
Not neighbors throw graduation party, turned parade around block encouraged everyone join (no masks allowed). 
People perfectly comfortable killing neighbors. Yes, dare give shit fundamental human rights. modeled immunizing 20% population actually increases transmission virus. I'm asking tipping point i.e. harm false sense security fall benefit immunizing portion population?  Jesus. writing medically induced coma something? Glad you‚Äôre still us!!

Do know where/how caught it? ???? Nobody debating whether there's problem, I'm debating terribad projections based bad assumptions. die cast now. Even forcibly lock every single person house, case rate going continue rise least next ten days. people diagnosed today probably infected 1-2 weeks ago showing symptoms. That‚Äôs going continue new measures (slowly) start take effect. problem rest us work earn living. Since reopening, everyone expected go back work. Eviction protections foreclosure protections, little were, expiring go back work.

If want go back yet use little personal leave time have, it, lucky employer let take UNPAID leave. likely fired coming work.

You go work surrounded unmasked.

Unless fortunate enough job work home, continues allow so, independently wealthy retired, everyone's problem.  I'd worried taking virus getting sick get quarantined get home. face time her. Yeah, run another lockdown hcw-collapse trying save indoor dining ;-)
For sure still lot place list already Wuhan, MIlan, Strasbourg, Paris, Madrid NY it.

It effect failure Jan/Feb govts didnt want hurt economy order contain virus. Name Doctor Shameful people vulnerable everything protect themselves. feel great shame, no-one breathing issue would able yell like without becoming breathless. genuinely breathing issues kerbside pickups, staying home wearing mask short time store anyway protect themselves. Awful human being, caring nothing vulnerable. It‚Äôs disturbing think commander right might seeing rash cases say anything fear reprisal. keep forwarding old ‚ÄúSituation getting dire, measures ineffective‚Äù tap dance around offending higher ups sound weak. *first time ever*

Implying cross milestone twice 4 weeks, Florida locked TODAY. not. expect increase remain indefinitely 4 weeks unannounced stubbornly avoided lock goes effect... Totally get that. What's worse African Americans greater risk getting critically ill dying. dramatic impact communities. Houston hitting max capacity hospitals now. 

You know used think people needed education? Yeah, wasn‚Äôt it. saying work restaurant sick, incentivized say anything can't collect unemployment ""too sick work"". Yesterday today grew 7.8%, meaning they're doubling numbers every 9 days. next Saturday, added another 122,000 totaling around 250,000 people. That's math. rate, they're doubling 250k, 500k, 1 million less little month's time. It‚Äôs indirect relationship.

Here, let refer old article connects dots I‚Äôve already seen multiple friends mine huge parties, 20+ people, kids all, protection... I‚Äôm sad. love enough want live long healthy life, would capacity anyone else? Thank you, yeah like 90% work home, 10% paperwork requires office presence that's colleague covering office one day week. healthy, high risk 15 minutes work. Still complains guess that's feel shit want let also I'm fed complaining managers. overall bad feeling one says ""Sorry come in"". hand: Health everything else. Thanks words encouragement! second one first one *always* turn left unchecked. I'm sure bother debating this. reddit extremely doom gloom desire vaccine work know scientists like Dr. Fauci. breathing problems.

I may need lung transplant within next five years regardless COVID-19 progressive lung disease. 

My doctor demands wear one. fucking safer lungs COVID-19. Damn % positive though. Like stood quickly? K governor definitely responsible hundreds needless deaths. Families torn apart income lost housing lost life over. every single recommendation science  point yelling fire watch theater walls ignite crime? training world can't make PPE appear thin air. That's 1 5 testing positive. Damn coming people co-opted patriotism religion themselves. right wear mask. duty, patriot help protect country, religious person help protect fellow man. bunch selfish, dumbass, spun-up, assholes.  understand masks importany. think don't, really met lived among them. dad would tell anyone listened seatbelts personal choice wear one unless suspected cop would see him. test less actually less cases... Neat. confirm didn‚Äôt either. wrongly trusted regular people right thing cautious. allowed spread COVID hours! problem asked. live here, we've ""asked"" wear masks now. leave house see single person wearing one. *sigh*

Sorry guys, state really dumb. that's probably another 450 Americans per day dead eventually, people take masks distancing seriously. Wish we'd provided sensible information -- agree you. Trolls around since days ARPANet, stayed bubbles before. bubble encompassing everything everyone nobody able conversation anymore. excuse. make mask lot less time money getting argument.

It's gotten point keep least spare one car case forget leave house. 

The public asked wear respirators require fit test pulmonary function exam. looser fitting masks little sneeze guards meet requirement. realize English first language - I'm sorry insensitive friend. Constantly wish speedy recovery, friend. Americans anti-mask?

There's evidence helps stopping spread catches water droplets going out, maybe even going in. 

There's empirical evidence well, countries wore masks tend better.

And even chance actually work anything, there's little cost wearing mask, complaining? literally lost nothing wearing mask. guess thinking regular contributions, prices fall, money go farther. risk moving everything cash really difficult successfully time it. hard know bottom is, peak is. definitely gamble. depends risk appetite. Reopening fast adhering simple science basic common sense. last country get going ton economic harm. Goodbye Florida man. issue masks work labor heavy job makes hard breathe, I'm wearing mask practice social distancing absurd extent, can't suffer mask. They're angry they're told angry, right? Fox told be? depends open safely, according scientific advice society acts disciplined not.

Haha never said thing. saying airlines better others, choose airlines possible agree. Americans tough, skip work cough. highly individualistic society big part failing terribly containment. good news flair imo. whole state. article talking specific hospitals. San Francisco Bay Area large repeated protests corresponding spike far know. People also wear masks, pretty much everybody one. think police would going around telling people mask up?

And really bad. country formed rights. got lot stupid, uncaring individuals think got especially unlucky protests fact country fed super markets smaller local stores. odds stacked us saying, justify uncaring individuals, means reasons careful still living lala land. guess biggest difference much time spend near 1 sick person. You‚Äôre likely get inhale lots virus. protest march everybody moving around mixing up. event people staying one place long time there‚Äôs going group people downwind sick get long blast virus.  development team started working project April, ran money keep up. article might behind paywall quite long archive link: [http://archive.vn/ibrVA](http://archive.vn/ibrVA) work avoid this. article quite long goes timeline different strategies/decisions taken different hospitals accounts people problems getting intensive care specific place (and investigations it) mean intensive care patients after. United States based individual rights. Japan not.

Japan saying, ‚ÄúThe nail protrudes hammered down.‚Äù

Japan discourages individuality. cases like immediate spreading virus, great strength. others, massive detriment everyone stays silent travel wrong road think everyone else thinks correct. Yeah bizarre. I‚Äôve noticed sniping stuff Reddit. I‚Äôve also seen exact arguments tossed back forth different people pointing getting downvoted hell replies. strange. Disney open previously bought tickets open reservation basis. said person reservation ends feeling well, think skip going, pop tylenol fever reducer head crowds? Oh yes addressing someone else sorry someone frequently listens NPR, obvious don't. everyone still vacationing here? beaches don‚Äôt close, people droves keep arriving South Midwest take home :( Viva la Revoluc√≠on? Naming single place protests surge cases evidence plenty places protests experiencing surges. Correlation causation.

LOL using Florida example, probably state worst position. it‚Äôs almost like nonstop protests weeks end... rock hiding since time began? Dude Camacho bad leader. recognized wasn‚Äôt smart enough solve farming crisis, enlisted help smartest person could find listened him. could fucking use Camacho right now. Almost wearing mask big deal... Condom manufacturers increase funding vaccine taxpayer money? US trump run already huge deficit biblical proportions lowering tax income. well put. even understand people wearing masks, uncomfortable like day get used it, hardly different transitioning short long sleeve shirts fall gets colder. feels weird little bit, feels normal. understand point protesting racial equality means attempting downplay importance struggle. However cannot arbitrarily award rights citizens based perceived importance. results seeing now... large political division.

We mayors still issuing fines jogging Lake Shore Blvd trails name Covid encouraging massive protests street distancing guidelines. churches shut (another 1st amendment right) regardless assembled outside proper distancing. lot local governments enforcing laws rules based personal moral compass instead equality every citizens rights. lead people discredit become enraged leadership.  

In fact regarding White Coat BLM almost bigger hypocrisy simply stated White Coats higher chance spreading viruses due heightened pre-exposure. virtue signaling disregarded people color co-mingled feel good moment since likely virus average citizen due continuous exposure.  


I trying say certain segment right one wrong. attempting provide insight people reacting way are. Marxist movement allowed line streets local business owner told dangerous open business provide family. piss lot Americans rightfully so. don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs suggesting it‚Äôs hospital‚Äôs intent. think suggests it‚Äôs strategy. No, realistic softer method, difference effectiveness small difference cost massive. things propose close useless - known cases shipping, example. might feasible anyway - resources lock things like medical care might there. We're talking something like 99% effect 20% cost.

And open anyway. Even coordinated globally, likely would cases - every time something pops up?

Just accept soft closures, necessarily strict anyway much normal life continue, need timed well. US, involve closing interstate travel necessary, model sick leave insurance might feasible more.

Now dig *good* stuff. Can't wait see suppress deaths wave, something tells keeping new deaths suspiciously 40-50 range every day gonna work time.  expect second, better vaccine right around corner insane.

Why? suddenly get crystal ball says so? know vaccines already stage 2 effective 20%? Pls sake justin bieber's left air jordan shue wear masks!! Luckily, virus transmissible something like measles, long like 10% people dummies I'm hopeful smash thing. 

The fact countries well even without vaccine reason hope! I'm sorry bout situation...that said would pay move back Pennsylvania Florida Man up! 

Even president grabs pussies pushes handicapped people.

/S Seems pretty pale comparison Florida 9500 new cases reported today. Excellent distinction slope 0.5 degrees, needs lot grease. #1 can‚Äôt wear mask drinking


Unless get full face gas masks straw inlet mean address someone else? Otherwise, read actual article (which copied comment already) see authorities references. Lol mean people Northeast put gruff mask strangers, guess trying say that. yet somehow number seems low... depressing thing think US 3.8 million square miles. Singapore 255 square miles. Existential causing enormous amount death, suffering, disruption? course. Existential causing human extinction? Extremely unrealistic. projected 11 billion people end century people scattered across entire planet varied climates. places remain survivable others smart people manage survive expense others.

The Irish potato famine killed million people forced million Ireland‚Äôs population 6 million leave. realistic scenario future climate change cause mass crop failures. Ireland cease exist country? No. example throughout history country millions people completely died cause? No.

There another reason highly doubt go fully extinct isn‚Äôt discussed enough. People often fear overpopulation good reason: people means demand resources. However, rarely discuss opposite: less population means less demand resources. it‚Äôs true. significant die population, ones remain easier time getting basic resources need survive hot, miserable planet. Yeah idk them, actually don‚Äôt give shit either. That‚Äôs Okay fucking die may right. pussyfoot around much. Example, answer phone everywhere ""Speak me"", that's standard Spanish people. Borders porous, many people think virus democratic conspiracy. result big split exposure risk within single states cities low rates.

People take seriously go bars high risk, since take seriously (and half think hoax) can't really expect participate pool testing program.

People take serious (and financial means isolate themselves) done months. necessarily enjoy staying home, change behavior even pool testing common know lots Trump crazies there. participate pool test? I'm certainly going risk health safety family, leaving house going testing site, zero impact future behavior. Instructions unclear burned dick protecting strangers point try push wearing mask. nothing tough guy much weak minded person worry ""tough guys"" think wear mask.

A real tough guy give shit others think wearing mask put safety others first. difference courage stupidity. moment government lied us. Thats data everyone see live actions case studies places. software wasn‚Äôt phone nov brought it. install phone really think trace enable .. You‚Äôre right don‚Äôt seek out. listened political organizations, I‚Äôm complaining political hacks. Miami also highest population density shit going cases.

And yes, discussion causing quickened increase ""the rate"" EXACTLY discussing. 

Nobody said large protests effect spread. said, borne data, outdoor gatherings mostly masked people constantly moving (marches) causing less spread people jammed indoor spaces like bars without masks extended periods time.

Now *dig* good stuff. may ask question.
Does testing positive COVID-19 mean symptomatic point hospitalization? mean positive asymptomatic?

Would data better presented knew hospitalization rate death rate, rather positive cases death rate?  one incident, saw good examples wechat. Mostly rural areas, local government welded people adhering quarantine. recovered? Ahh classic, ""come across arrogant douche"" response without references.

You, idea talking about. Go back overpopulation conspiracy subreddits lets actual adults conversation. won‚Äôt.

It help much money politics. there's entire party half another party anything protect donors. Anything. price tags services making shit work people valid reason wear mask. pregnant woman give birth wearing mask too. people glasses mask causes glasses fog too.

Overweight whole different discussion. Majority overweight blame themselves. always extremely extremely fraction fraction overweight medical reasons, guarantee reading you.

Oh rich people ones travelling. It'll poor people using opportunity taking back community :/ People make personal choice eat big Mac smoke, make choice around people public spaces people behave. Big difference.  first study Diamond Princes cruise ship assumed asymptomatic spread without infected person would infect 15 others. looking like case. really think generations polio.

Well, rodents historically associated plagues, Mickey point. said, understand frustration city giving tickets obstructing street sweeping. think better answer give tickets neither, start ticketing people wearing masks. Nobody could predicted exactly every scientist said do, outcome could bad. going keep breaking record every day? late innit? I‚Äôm sure month. Hospitals Houston capacity right now, governor still yet place strict urgent lockdown restrictions back place, meaning it‚Äôs going get very, ugly within week two. Regardless legal restrictions though, I‚Äôm really sure recent politicization masks country conducive new preventive measures. I‚Äôm sure close NY got this, least point, Cuomo reacted people responded.

Even Abbott impose heavy restrictions effective ASAP, would take week two weeks see reflected hospitalization numbers. Texas going even horror story NYC ever within weeks, least judging know NEVER get germany! cause europe wont let americans least year heard :( FUCK VIRUS!! I'm back school task force district, consensus need strong go-to virtual plan. Whatever in-person plan have, single case shut school down. Sweden also act like control group. crazy US group super strict lockdown either. We're lagom control group. Rich man states obvious. Dawg billion dollars stake. players owners thousands players work league. what‚Äôs new? sure East Java, lived Sumba couple years, put dead loved ones monolithic tombs near house order stay close them. Also funeral huge party body out. don‚Äôt think would okay skipping tell 20% effective, better nothing. Problem solved. expect second, better vaccine right around corner insane. Apparently not. outed tried shame him. winning lawsuit. sad 3 kids. get donations yelled at. Open invite antivaxxers come photoshoot me.

It's easy say people decide fly, know employers (as bad airlines themselves) forcing employees fly work.

Money matters. god hope reckoning companies. Responsibility empathy damned! Intention vs Impact. may claim don‚Äôt intend kill people. information EVERYWHERE telling killing people choices. choose ignore credible sources credible advice continue actions. choose kill others. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want wear seatbelt. don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs going help accident despite evidence available contrary. don‚Äôt wear one won‚Äôt.

Constitutional rights paramount else. rights many controlled few.  Nobody stopping pursuing happiness? Good. gives hope cause thought we‚Äôd fucked resigned. Except countries managing it... subset Americans don‚Äôt seem capable giving shit people? I'm pro distancing, think NBA return. players spoiled threatening play. They'll isolated rest world, tested every day, interacting people circumstances. Many people go jobs far less money far less protection. simply true, lockdown saved center south travel restrictions. lockdown crucial stopping thing, *that* cases decreasing ...yeah...well.... there, drank around 3 bottles Pocari Sweat day. Every morning I‚Äôd super bloated electrolytes wat worth it. right wing started firing propaganda telling so. Face shield effective case somebody infected coughts directly face - rather unlikely happen. 
Glasses even less effective eyes lower risc transfer Virus Aerosoles risc inhaling directly.
Only specified medic personel (and trained properly) use face shields, protective glasses gloves.

For common people mask sufficient. important proper hygiene distance Others. ever notice meaningless insults ability hurt feelings demand support beliefs policies?

You're joke human being, parody model citizen taught birth fountain good anybody disagrees foundation bad hope family catch covid, weak pathetic triggered Texan snowflake. Sad!

Gotta love humanity display! empathy!

Not worry though, little fear I'm riddled obesity!

Still, shows mindset have. Everybody like die cause. scared death government require de-densify passenger seating. zero increases past 2 weeks bars restaurants Mohawk Valley region New York Modern Christians money That's lack trying. I'm guessing gun owner ton ""common sense"" gun restrictions trying pass Sandy Hook banning things like cosmetic features standard capacity magazines hold rounds arbitrary number someone decided many. many bug words idiots understand.. 57 new people = striking new wave
46k/day = flu bruh man wrong. embarrassing 4 years imo. headline needed recognize leave sub pure propaganda mouthpiece.

Protests 50K aren‚Äôt causing this!! Shame 8 people together backyard celebrate accomplishments EVIL!! 

For fucks sake Florida pretty significant protests Tampa Bay Area, mask order, seeing huge increase there. yeah company shop, dealing 20+ people day, past entertainment industry. well adjusted deal people like you.  slogan shaming seems bit problematic.

Wait appropriated #RealMenDontObey. They'll testing resources imaginable man they'll isolated rest world. see can't give go. many employees forced back work far less money, far less safe circumstances, see NBA players get coddled. Glasses fogging indication fit mask across nose eyes loose. Mask fitted much less effective. think masks would've fine, begin with. Problem is, lot people got tired being/feeling trapped, allowed leave longer wished feel controlled. 
Also, hate say it, never make people choose freedom others, that's dangerous path. Lol downvote, ignore, move on. Great tactic. long border country done really well contain covid19 risk factor.

Well I'm sure far would trust official numbers, obviously able get control (obligatory, 'for moment') real cost probably never known happen thag became focus rights obligations fellow man woman? 


Idk man maybe 20,000 BC-ish? Get logic facts. USA rules made shouting solves everything. bar pretty close worst imaginable setting know virus transmission. 

A church soccer stadium, lots shouting singing, think even worse.  see younger people tourist areas, Millennial. Perhaps Gen Z, much hate say, truth. Florida see lot college age kids like 19-20 something. re-read said, isnt single definitive statement there. ""Could, could, could'. 

You err far side sweep shit rug proven sure. Track back march. Scientists told Americans wear masks unless sick, nothing fear unless getting coughed on. 

People know COULD happen, especially EVER INCREASING EVIDENCE hypothesis Yep. ever come time US look back behavior objectively people judged worst US history. actions literally killing people. think outpouring grief emotion 3000 people 9/11. feeling 100,000s people. 

They would say, could would‚Äôve helped save someone twin towers won‚Äôt wear mask even though proven around world save lives others. people destroying America. maybe simply pulling back curtain many Americans think; fuck everyone else. That‚Äôs healthcare industry it‚Äôs COVID response. Austria cases coming lockdown wore fucking mask stayed home recommended. understood help help other. selfish pigs disgrace beloved country leave US citizens want right thing chance work together stop deaths. 0.14% population. officials told us beginning.

They knew masks would help, want shortages.  agree, least 3 contributing factors within 1-2 weeks. Maybe one alone would caused huge spikes. Memorial day, protests, opening restrictions. 3 boom! Sure, lots reasons optimistic. 

But there‚Äôs also reason assume actually work. We‚Äôve seen vaccines fail past, even dozens candidates. 

I every hope one work, also assume we‚Äôll never see act accordingly. switched parties couple years ago Democrat Republican. knew way wind blows, changed parties could get re-elected. Yes, judges elected here. Regardless good isn't, party switcher like likely get endorsed president either party. get many robo calls, get like 1 2 week, even sure robo calls cause leave messages Ok know vast majority boomers awful people aren‚Äôt worth reaching. know ‚Äòboomer mindset‚Äô boomers don‚Äôt know that. want good ones side, large generation. messaging 1 year [**2021-06-27 18:17:06 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-06-27%2018:17:06%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

The twisted sense satisfaction seen frustrating best look academic approach. means thousands cases states way shape form going eradicating virus US anytime soon unless dramatic actions taken know go another nationwide lockdown clamp down. 

Time tell. 

Vote. feel like explain Beaumont you. surrounding area. grew town right outside there. people believe every word Trump speaks. still mindset go away. took forever even acknowledge coronavirus thing. Seriously Google Beaumont Texas. Go KFDM page see people's comments. people real people walk amongst us. terrifying. longer live rarely visit. backwards way thinking area. Something like 86% people one town voted Trump. guess need say anymore. thank you. jumped gun thoughts surface transmission. well known NYC spread subway, vacationed NYC last summer... mind fixated poles dirty must be. Apparently poles much shared air. mistake. 
I think we're missing ""real"" number infected 2x 4x. stick official numbers baseline, compare apples apples. MN have, LARGER hidden population anyone else, testing outstanding. 80,000 tests week since riots, 3%-5% positive. like said, thought protests going cause massive spike like wrong, are. protests negligible impact almost 4 weeks. question worse: mass deaths?  states go lockdown. put way, even progressive &amp; humanistic &amp; liberal Los Angeles, county board said flat Lock Downs option. They're willing let covid burn region shut businesses again. Maybe particular wealthy white-collar cities like SF Seattle implement lockdowns, metros exceptions. easily done hard spot, that's Fox like get away confusing motivations widely. Absolutely meaningless recirculating hvac system larger industrial system bring 100% fresh air.

Don't trust small business politicians ban recirculating air within building. Recirculating lowers hvac cost, something allowed right now. Japan lot Japanese Americans wear masks cold flu season. you‚Äôre cramped take precautions work. 40,000 people protesting shoulder shoulder? totally ok.  
2 people milkshake diner? verboten.  
10 people attending funeral 80 year old mother? zomg no! *shocked Pikachu face*

Bu-bu-but rights... No, issue everywhere country. states may stupid others, matter go find people acting thinking government trying take away freedom. live Pacific Northwest, somewhat liberal place Texas, 15-20+ outside city find people dumb idiots equally culpable politicians goading behavior. Wear masks protests? WORSE - herd immunity plan, sign people completely ignorant selfish given up.

I spitballing, gifted elementary math teacher, amounts much, lol. appreciate ""math checks out,"" warms soul. PERFECTLY relevant! saying 'we dont enough evidence say virus cause random life-threatening infections months road, therefore true!'

months ago people like saying 'we dont enough evidence virus spreads, therefore need wear mask 3ft distance good'

what happens UNDERESTIMATE eh? Others pay price normally care, they're putting others risk stupidity. want body far I'm concerned, asshole wearing mask. absolutely hate wearing mask, especially getting hot live. know what? wear every single time exit home. imagine things would spread widely flu. friend, almost three months shelter place Michigan taught really, really appreciate subtle mirth myriad comforts afforded cannabis. Many us voted legalize here. hope find best grass ever enjoyed warm hug soul. thoughts exactly. Lmao thread full b00tlickers, ironic given vehemently everyone Reddit hates State. specific right regards masks?  I‚Äôm sure people uproar told wear seatbelt. buy car insurance. remember China reported 14k cases one day Feb everyone freaked out. 

Lead way US. Show us new normals every day/s absolutely false. Infection requires sufficient viral load. part immune system called innate immunity protect pathogens without establishing full blown immune response. Reminds Japan never shut down

This entirely true. prefecture level many prefectures closed borders outsiders (e.g. many gas stations tokushima allow licence plates prefectures) well clubs/bars. 

Of course, worth mentioning technically none measures real laws, japanese term 'suggestion'. However people continued follow suggestion implied threat would become order (some pachinko parlors Osaka close, think stir around this). However Japanese American society different aspect, one far end collectivist far end individualist. Rather policies, real problem individualist nature lot americans. guess forgot ‚Äúchild endangerment‚Äù part letting child attempt cross border illegally unsupervised. Oh humanity huh... Wow looked account even notice till read comment looked again. brilliant fucked way push narrative. consider testing four months 10 percent US tested. 

remember test kit shortages, supply chain issues, conflicts countries local federal governments

consider 7.8 billion people earth. 

Consider 7.8 billion people poor decent access health care is

Consider logistical challenges

Consider ethical challenges. fair just, prioritize getting vaccine poor vulnerable developing world first essential workers. last people get vaccine people like work home. wouldn‚Äôt expect get vaccinated fall 2021 earliest. real case number double. I'm telling even everything goes right, still need mass production distribution. Disneyland far. bought 80 family extended family. ETA August 11th....  absolutely ridiculous unavailable are. No, they‚Äôve postponed Disneyland, Disneyworld understand asking people wear mask first step somehow taking America. Or, even first step to? honestly get argument make logical sense. God can‚Äôt handle lack critical thinking. ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt wear masks unless you‚Äôre already sick won‚Äôt protect you.‚Äù I‚Äôm claiming masks violation. wear mine. I‚Äôm trying shut protest. point pandemic would think large group gatherings wouldn‚Äôt celebrated. Science viruses don‚Äôt care. cooled want everyone back serious pandemic again. understand frustrate people. That‚Äôs all. bad downvoted? I‚Äôm wearing mask protests. I‚Äôm looking objectively situation. live Australia we've 100 deaths (cut number almost half exclude cruise ships docked here) almost one wearing masks.

I honestly feel like ""mask issue"" become superstitious totem people can't grapple overall complexity battling pandemic. Clearly masks needed prevent major outbreak also clearly stop massive outbreak progress. unless whole deal trying make feel better pointing people say ""idiots"" actual issue hand way complex ""masks: Good bad?"" otherwise grok different countries wildly different outcomes without masks - country great example one masks largely worn transmission rates incredibly low Italy would side spectrum. Also FL hospital employee major city. Everything pretty normal - got back fully staffed. numerous hospitals area patients tho Toxic individualism academic term selfishness. Good man, politics degenerates discuss, degenerates discuss. guess better headline would be, ""The US, one wealthiest nations alive, cannot figure mass testing. thing countries figured months ago.""

That's news. number cases per day. 

you saying number cases set period time, that's case. too, take glasses soon mask goes bump around half blind shop. yet people can‚Äôt assed wear ‚ÄúmAh RigHTs‚Äù Pretty much Spain. am, 90% wore voluntarily, even mandated.

Japan never forced lockdown state emergency lasted March April. Restaurants strongly encouraged (but forced) close, least shortened hours (close 8:00 pm)

Now, restrictions eased pretty much every restaurant back open. don‚Äôt know enough virus, younger people still get sick know nothing long term effects asymptomatic people. Take seriously keep safe. case anyone confused, Texas ""county Judge"" title held chief executive county government similar mayor.
