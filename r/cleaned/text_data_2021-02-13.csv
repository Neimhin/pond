There’s actually thousands variants, vaccines appear prevent severe covid them. county still mandate. Thank god Richer nations, stated article. also additional research find nations specifically want information. know nations include United States, Israel China. There’s more, course. Variants neutralized vaccines US currently distributing. Spread 65+ year olds doesn’t matter they’re vaccinated, OPs point.

So every person wants Covid vaccine gets Covid vaccine, ***35.72%*** (76%\*0.47) total population vaccinated. good number? Covid Tracking Update: around 2,200. 7 day average cases around 3,500. 7 day average deaths 97. vaccinated Israelis: 544 infected vaccination, 4 severe, 0 deaths. Estimated 93% efficacy symptomatic infection. **dramatic** reduction risk getting severe COVID-19 infection. There’s 3 different variants, vaccination doesn’t mean can’t spread covid. Hardly fever definitely dream come true. ... reminds rest us important double prevention next months, even see peers giving Yeah, read article.  nation vaccine use vaccinate people?  I'm hoping get novavax end month. would make summer even solid. “new normal” could get onboard 100% fine voluntary masking. 

Emergency mask mandates must end emergency over, however. daughter week out. feel better she’s alone. not, apparently, work directly planes. May another contact spread workplace. I'll take chances exactly Cluster 5? variant strain? compare new variants infecting world? Denmark know last year took take hard measures drive towards extinction. really doubt anyone follow yearly mask mandate every flu season. People probably start wearing masks sick though.

I think actually does. worker hypothetically choose jobs city country vastly increases competition employers workers would drive wages. Obviously would also open door competition employees jobs that, counterintuitively, may also increase wages. potential talent pool small adding higher salary necessarily draw better applicants talent pool entire country higher wages also easily equate talented applicants.

uhg. got first shot 8 hours ago. Feeling hot, bit flemmy, tired, headache eyes. Lmao totally missing he's saying psychopath. need help. shit dude. Collapsing ecconomy leads poverty &amp; disparity leads horrible shit like this. dumb basically leaving others whatever want using UN. read article explicitly states richer nations hoarding vaccines stockpiling need assume there’s scarcity manufacturing problems? Knock hole wall, fill hole window open vent pull push air. Problem solved. I've remodeled houses this, really hard, takes paying it, one seems ever want do. China government Yes. Reddit main source news interaction - especially Coronavirus subs CNN - disconnect little while. 

It wonders psyche realize world isn’t ending aren’t going live shut-in dystopia much longer, despite clickbait wants believe. calling hospitals big businesses now? related facts:

* 16.5% US population age 65.
* 11% US population already received least one vaccine dose; therefore probably already vaccinated large fraction older adults
* Adults age 65 account 80% COVID deaths
* vaccines eliminate virtually COVID deaths

The thing conclude US expect see **massive** drop deaths next weeks. fact, directed vaccine doses elderly people, pandemic would basically already. investigation done January 2020 maybe truth, done 2021. idiot leave evidence lying around 1 year. still doesnt change fact patient zero south east east asia originate Wuhan clear record. fever dream Who? OK? even read article? Nowhere state “white people” anything randomly launched manifesto. Yikes, embarrassing. don’t really care it’s scientifically proven lockdowns works anti-lockdown comments scientifically wrong basically fake conspiracy theory, that’s point. There's 6 PM - 6 nationwide curfew place, end sight.

Bars restaurants closed since late October, personally alternance lockdown (can't go 1km home, can't meet anyone (there's ""social bubble"" concept here), fill form everytime go out, etc) 10PM/8PM 6PM curfews since September.

Still, virus keeps spreading never reach ""reopening"" levels rate going.

So lockdown is, many people, way mess: lockdown hard reopen stuff April May. There’s way provide end date ahead time, none us crystal ball predict precisely over. (Republican) state governments dumb shit like dumb shits. says signed document declaring evictions increase COVID transmissions. Nothing moratorium preventing people getting evicted. Check comprehension skills. Awesome, flu? It’s you. Remember, never got ill year *everyone else* wearing masks, won’t true mass vaccination. I’ll ever wear mask it’s mandated, increasingly fewer places they’re mandated starting summer. Thanks Jennifer, cool!  sure you’re sarcastic not. Whatevs, readers learn something  people--you included, apparently--don't understand actually manufacturing vaccine scale hard part.

There's reason Pfizer/BionNtech Moderna companies *producing* mRNA vaccines. reason production difficult nobody else capable producing scale, today.

As slight aside, U.S. needs expand access college education, graduate-level science education U.S. free everyone, reputable school.

The 15 million target account 88% deaths (leaving 12%) plus people get shot got getting ill. ability treat people Covid means people taking lot longer die, deaths continue months still.

I think report impact released next week.

Edit: masks social distance lockdown still important tools. saw average 1,000 deaths day January, want reduce deaths much possible. Check attitude. think restrictions ever tight anywhere US, progress progress. start allowing outdoor meetings opening schools first, that's good. gradually ease keep removing restrictions weeks go on.

i's simply covid versus covid elevator fomite transmission maintenance worker MIQ, two MIQ guests touched rubbish bin. two confirmed cases fomite transmission. also left one likely sources Auckland Coldstore outbreak, though physical evidence found. 

Fomite transmission seems extremely low risk eliminated transmission risks via MIQ system, really leaves fomites. would gets noticed NZ. something worry unless trying maintain zero cases. Sorry, Russia.

It’s pity there’ll miniseries highlighting disaster coming US soon. Journalism thankless. That's Russia. give 11th amendment rights exactly? Freedom wear masks? Smart resignation. doesn’t want responsible deaths end losing job anyways. responsible deaths couldn’t avoided tends stick. symptoms started Friday night whole household since tested positive. However symptoms strong fever tenderness chest, taste/smell fine cough shortness breath. mean immune system winning fight? I've taking paracetamol aches pains I'm worried might dampen natural immune response. I’ve read New York Times recently, can’t remember article specifically You’d need another 80 million cases US 1/3 it.  studies back up? France trying conserve vaccine doses? isnt evidence people lose year income least large portion it, decide spend overly following years

why people think people lose level income eager go spend it? unpopular snap lockdowns are, seem effective. look recent outbreaks Perth, Brisbane Adelaide. It'll interesting see happens Melbourne next days. Best luck cities. Ah right, anymore.

The UK raised £548m back like September time, UK largest donator. However Biden came pledged like dont need lot things, doesnt mean dont want them. guess. lot infections detected cases, many case sue postpone investigation?  
Gov: hey need check make sure people safe workplace.  
Amazon: Fuck I'll see court! ever left America?... world already many countries multiple different vaccines. never left America know. true. It’s dropped 20% time, far less case drop. Fewer people seek tests there’s fewer people getting sick, testing still 1.6m per day ya, mean hate landlords people really expect? landlords still taxes source income may confusing ‘Rich’ upper-middle class people actually rich definitely hooked vs. average upper-middle class couple million assets living $500,000 house. Sorry break ya that’s rich anymore. Oh... now? really, ultimatly cant consistently shower cant smell good feel dirty

I lived car bit kid cannot ever shake obviousness showering 2 weeks versus people  marks 2nd 3rd time fomite transmission linked spread among people NZ. don’t necessarily believe it’s common think government, people, apt use possibility particles aerosols likely. It’s real weird see NZ specifically use fomite possibility once. Especially considering countries less silent it, even ones strict lockdowns. Yeah well AFAIK need weapons specifically designed kill humans. yeah, cool side. That’s even close true. Hospitalizations dropping quite quickly.

They peaked around 130k month ago fell 70k today chances slim, yes, might make respond coronaviruses harmful way. Vaccine testing coronaviruses happen (on animals though). dont data. diabetes, 65 underlying conditions would make afraid virus, would get vaccinated heartbeat. 

If go region Malaria, take medicine even though makes sick. get Malaria I’m fucked life. covid, data points worth it. Apparently people antibodies need first shot, strengthening theory. 

I might change mind situation doesnt get better, mutations arise harmful. However, point, danger, pointless costly vaccinate certain people. Especially symptoms upon reinfection get weaker too, large group people beat naturally (and already have). data suggesting antibodies deplete get weaker time, might also reconsider, data far know. didnt make decision without thinking it, really research best ability genuinely worried vaccinating much people need to.

I wish best health man, disagree something doesnt mean dont wish well. hope get back normal soon. are, fact, falling bet new conspiracy theory there

So conspiracy theory there's conspiracy theory? Yeah, listen armchair forecaster. Continue take precautions foreseeable future. can't ""go back normal"". life 2019 never coming back. saying we'll wearing masks permanently, kidding think there's reality wind clock back pretend never happened go back ""normal"". majority vaccinations far.. read 66% happened though it? Liar Yeah well AFAIK kiwis allowed. yeah, cool side.  fair, western countries, makes bulk rich countries, cases deaths.

Logically speaking, give vaccines first countries need US/UK fit bill.  submission linking blogspot.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Take something designed nature reprogram make work body rather it. case adenovirus engineered genetic level helpful rather harmful. best way describe imagine body highway picture virus fast car driven bad man imagine damage car could cause. replace man cop picture changes. that's essentially we've done.  Seriously could time travel first day US hit 100k infections tell things going get rough 100k new cases day would something celebrated.. I'd probably heart attack. Cool story bro freedom REEEEE /s Hope gets better you! pandemic? says going end anytime soon? People wearing masks rest lives. Covid like HIV. world never going quite same. state live major lockdown 22 active cases. Gotta gotta save lives Universal flu vaccine may even useful tbh mutates faster change said. Pfizer sure vs. placebo. Pretty sure moderna well.

Oxford Tdap (I believe) quite. premiers NSW utter dogshit. yesterday? No, understand. think vaccine could fuck way virus couldn't? Zero Covid even realistic vaccines know end-game there... Yeah. thing need us opine them.

Few weeks ago another case left 14-days quarantine, became positive case 5 days leaving MIQ.

Not without traveling places Northland region. fair enough her. away partner many months, followed protocols entry country. Funny hospitalizations also trend. sure? people absolutely stripped money pandemic. One step closer universal death vaccine. would like thank time naturally progressing time think bad call 10 months ago? so, why? certainly don't. 

That said, also think USA could work pressure China. Instead pulled cut part world's pandemic response. think could pulling out? What's nothing policy reactions everything days zero nuance? switch gears belief overstated deep state infected trump. learned playbook now? ""Next MSNBC, Dr Peter Hortez shine flashlight chin whisper phrase,"" varient, varient, varient"" five minutes... scary"" - every MSNBC host need case counts local community spread come masking social distancing become less important. going look different place place. can’t make sweeping federal guidance places like Butte, Montana Covid free long Newark, New Jersey example. wish they’d explicit it’s clearly causing lot confusion among general public. 

But take heart, even Fauci recently said CDC guidance gatherings among vaccinated individuals coming soon. 

Seriously though, watch what’s happening county surrounding counties help determine going play community particular. EU bad funding producing vaccines, maybe would better place. Lol. still cannot understand why.

Natural immunity acts exact spike protein mrna vaccine. Also, afaik natural immunity act spike vaccine also different parts virus. They’re actually contributor. contributor hesitancy historical problems, people color didn’t need read historical offenses stories medical abuse told generationally. 

What actually happens types articles you’re educating people don’t want take vaccines,or likely, educating people know people topic articles. Refusing speak issue doesn’t magically make go away. articles beneficial.

Your viewpoint reminds think talking race propelling racism (lol) solution stop talking race together. It’s good guess superficially true end. non-Brits, means met first target vaccinated first 4 groups (or least offered 93% uptake 75's per article). 

Now next target groups 5-9. 

Onwards! Still overly pessimistic. vaccines block spread. need avoid fun get May - won’t spread many vaccinated. agree, I'd like source asked would awsome, Im folding right This.

Grocery store workers ahead everyone 65 (without medical reason, except first responders, critical infrastructure, funeral workers) based graphic shared. 

My reservations would be:

* roll-out Q3/Q4 seems unnecessarily slow given forecast rate supply; 
* clear infrastructure workers, generally work team members relatively safe isolated environments (potentially outdoors) rank higher grocery workers, exposed public potentially pass infection everyone else. thought placebo used trials, another preexisting (non-corona) vaccine.

If placebo saline water people could easily deduct injected saline thus distorting results. wish could surprised. people sub Americans like myself, think wearing mask affront civil rights. we're coming year since ""started"" people fucked around top/all time sub today curiosity. March absolutely fucking insane news, wow. lived still surprised reading crap happened, forgot lot it. fun fact: declared pandemic day Tom Hanks announced tested positive. think Gobert touching mics 2 days drops happening without vaccine super widely available oddly enough.  *laughs ar-15* legally allowed Seems got free money EU want spend it. nothing, mRNA project failed. 

Sanofi also developing protein based vaccine, planned end 2021. 

Sanofi plans also year production Biontech vaccine Frankfurt’s facility, 125 mln doses. Well, one way avoid would mandatory covid test vaccination.

I wonder that's done? sarcasm, big oof. Could confounding factor here? theory, perhaps strains contagious deadly resistant immunity acquired earlier strains, rather inherently contagious deadly? convenient! vaccinate distribute AZ vaccine anyone interested general public. Problem solved Source biggest contributor Covax?

Found EU: im thankful scotland's handling covid rules (except selfish rule breakers) lockdown vaccination speed, 1.2/5th population receiving coincidence, UK peak cases happened 9th January since cases dropping dropping.

I wonder explains peak, Christmas parties? I'm torn apart this. would royally pissed punished homejail one two fucking cases. that's european point view, I'm sure see differently.

On hand, looks like works. stage would probably prefer one month hard lockdown get shut control never ending soft lockdowns, solve anything yet legally much sleep, work sometimes buy groceries. want preface make clear anti-vaxer ignorance lies trust doctors/scientists well alot smarter me. hesitance vaccine due numerous times heard doctors like Dr. Fauci infancy covid pandemic state takes good 2-3 years come good tested proven vaccine cases (I'm sorry can't provide proof said moment I'm almost positive said many times) fact vaccine created what, 8-9 months? little reserved skeptical want call plain idiot care. kind feel comfortable wait least year reliable research etc. hopefully make part ""Idiocy"" truly wait get vaccinated feel comfortable it.

Even health staff ppe take necessary measures get low rate despite high risk environments sounds like nonsense. end sight. Vaccines going arms cases dropping. need gloomy. stay cautious optimistic leads believe wont us forever?

A lot people know antibodies. dont know many. see vaccinating everyone answer pandemic, feel free change mind. I'm even going start rambling weak virus actually individual level. healthy person shits virus. 

I'm saying shouldnt vaccinate. I'm saying might closer reaching herd immunity think. Mount Roskill Evangelical Fellowship. Let's bash baptists one. C19 represents last gasp dying media. nothing good news media desperate clickbait. average fatality rate 0.26% like CDC says, I'd say 180 million total cases would make math check out. literally millions day hold small gain. would dumb.  Vaccines don’t keep coming contact virus. protects sever case. can’t. local regulations use skirting. go Nobody knows. Hence lockdown. buys bit time figure situation is, came about. Blame Fauci CDC. refuse admit anything unless sounds bad. Otherwise it’s “unknown time” make people fall line behavior. I’m shocked let info get published.  That's really issue Pfizer moderna vaccines, produce whole spike protein. Corona virus can't get rid spike protein altogether else able enter cells replicate self.

We picked good attack vector combat this, evolutionarily got thing balls. argue that.

Never late start. point couple days nothing compared long take vaccinate everyone.

But yeah, vaccines go? That's whole lot money. Jesus Christ must nice functioning government cares people. saying vaccination can't useful. be. vaccinating everyone might needed beat pandemic, especially **when clue much people actually antibodies.**

Dude that's exactly blind vaccination good thing. know many have/don't antibodies. want like flu stay us forever hit hard possibly deal every years? Well deliver pizza, delivery bar tonight... hundreds people masks there. Holy shit got fast. claimed immunity summer different

Yeah, lol

You think same? millions people it? That's dumb.

Did need link covid gives immunity due time? need link millions it? I'll supply both, seems kinda unnecessary. need link sky blue too? water wet? Source lockdowns help? yup. like said, need get new infections tolerable level first. need careful reopen. go small, make sure R value stays 1, reopen stuff, repeat. 

last fall went fast, played big role cases spiking back up. hopefully make mistakes again. Dude lockdown nazi. It’s okay say it. Big Bad! Rofl fuckin killed xD point 2 million people day getting vaccinated, waiting 2-4 days every person get antibody tests counterproductive. blue laws drag you’ve lived anywhere else. can’t even get double. don’t disagree point RNA vaccines seemingly better; live Europe, simply enough supply vaccines months come. You’re saying European countries let people get hospitalized die, AZ vaccine “up there” terms efficacy mild symptoms? I’m sorry handle situation like do. limited personal experience covid would assume isn’t underlying conditions making fatal would treatment? Right? 15 544 people tested positive hospitalized due symptoms. Israel’s stats hospitalizations vs positive tests general population unvaccinated people? would need know stats control group making claims vaccine results milder course illness. 

It’s great 90% didn’t catch virus, people vaccinated; but, haven’t read solid proof getting vaccine leads milder disease course test positive. given individual variation disease progression, it’s impossible compare symptoms severity one individual tests positive without vaccinated vs vaccinated. can’t measured. Summer: hit 100k cases crap fear.

Me 2 Weeks Ago: hit 100k cases crap excitement. thing stopping lack imagination. Get Yeti cup make happen. 1) that's extreme exaggeration know SA variant 


2) vaccines US using appear strong efficacy SA variant 


3) SA variant appears extremely low prevalence US moment, even natural immunity provided protection, would trouble getting dangerous levels snuffed weight large-scale vaccination program.  gotten August, maybe, there's enough time it.  October level 2 (social distancing fans sport limited crowds) ended August actually one hurts choice, would also choose one RNA vaccines, supply little, urgency stop virus large, cannot wait months different vaccines available. course one forced take certain vaccine, someone declines, I’m sure enough takers little supply have. mean, kinda hard argue that. freezing nature’s way resetting homeless problem. Maybe so, never ""beat virus"". would never done ""strict lock down"". economy important extending lives elderly. future generations sacrificed. anyone know much percentge 15 million Pfizer AZ approximately? Covid restrictions binary choice. scale hiding bed licking subway poles.

As long number new infections large R value stays 1 we're good. ratio people form immunity going reduces R maintain state less restrictions. happen gradually next months going ""the day"" open up. 

But first need get new infections tolerable level. casinos? since Texas state govt allow many Cuz MURRICA FRAYDUMB Yeah I’m sure it’s good bottom line business closed restricted. Cus makes since right? Churchill said greatest argument democracy meeting voters...............

its perfection: trimming extremes.... finally book dream vacation Dover bunch people Texas, Florida Montana also waiting go back normal there's vaccine. evidence points social distance measures actually good economy.

""But evidence also suggest stringent temporary restrictions, could actually benefit economic recovery reduce spread disease. International Monetary Fund, example, determined lockdowns “impose short-term costs” may lead “a faster economic recovery. organization states “by bringing infections control, lockdowns may thus pave way faster economic recovery people feel comfortable resuming normal activities” ( bit.ly/2UXoIUy page 74)."" Demand drop cliff 1/2 vaccinated. least 33% US anti vax many kids qualify. bad since least Tulsa 1921 massacre. won’t catch spread virus

There literally 0 data vaccinated population’s ability *spread* virus, saying it’s neutralizing/without contagion unproven irresponsible assertion realize specifically said teachers &lt; 65 right? considering open America now, get 50% vaccinated, best believe it'll pre covid life selfish self-interest.... good bad... conservatives take logical conclusion You’re gonna really shocked find live downtown happened neighborhood. sure someone lives even matters discussion point you’re acting though everyone city terrified re-opening that’s remotely true. friend's aunt uncle live Toronto can't get vaccine they're 79 cut-off age 80. let house, need quarantined 2 weeks. /s idea political composition live? letting gets elected determin live giving want. wanna know family housemates got it. Lol thanks. Touchy subject haha. It’s news still spread others unprotected would much worse symptoms. 

Unfortunately everyone seems think vaccine ticket whatever want. suppose that’s case don’t give fuck anyone else. voters way.... problem seeing everyelse die... wanna calle dout it. dads blessed day Speak Yeah days numbered, sorry  RemindMe! 1 Month Pretty sure whole point reality TV judgey can't say I'm shocked. GF got 2nd shot whole local family (about 15 people) vaccinated. Time party 🎉 I'm giving vaccine store past 2 days, 7 extra shots. Employees get priority, yet 2 employees want it. can't even understand it. prefer call ""politicians""... family flathead valley. Let's say lot vaccine conspiracy theory stuff really dug people's brains there. conversations vaccines wild. big portion goes Flathead county commission. last health department officer (who resigned frustration said commission health board) essentially begged funding help rollout county said “not problem.” consider absolutely anything public funding socialism won’t give red cent anyone except causes aligned interests. also anti mask. say they’re appointed Annie Bucacek, far right extremist anti mask anti vax health board shows values regarding public health lie. poor folks trying vaccine rollout hands tied behind backs someone punches face someone else preaches appointed position vaccines death. Hah, elected officials actually people would want around envious. think would trouble restraining saw governor public, I'm fan local mayor either..but also become lot cynical year, seeing one failure another another. (Mainly COVID, also BLM/protests/police response dealing rent/evictions.) know we'll even know. 


The US done pretty poorly overall testing tracing different variants.

Overall, numbers trending down. low-life even close. COVID-19. experience nothing mild cold. 

My 2nd moderna shot nearly killed witha 104.3 fever &amp; trembles. Reality TV show subs think people stayed home since day 1 social pandemic awful people deserve censure lol Let relay shocked, completely totally shocked, live UWS. mask, like told do. don’t understand bunch people texas, Florida Montana already going back normal. I’ve literally tin packed bars multiple times year it’s awesome. 

&amp; save “don’t ask help sick/hope like killing grandma” comments. I’m fine I’m scared virus done pretending confused. dismissive anything thought about. what’s pissed about? genuine question lol i’m loop. People forget elephant room potential mutations occur. happen? rich get vaccinated virus continue transmit mutate even gets point vaccines rich took effectively longer work. takes one person enter soil spread mutation everyone back square one. 

This pandemic global issue, EVERYONE needs vaccinated EQUALLY regardless cost. one thing people consider. Sir Wendys Haha yep. job searching got random call expecting recruiter always email first contact call me. answered thinking spam caller said ‘hello’ loud irritated voice. Turned recruiter actually ended getting job 😅 walked Amsterdam UWS nearly everywhere indoor dining hitting 25%, so... 95% effective. Guess means? 5% people still catch get symptoms. far, doses 0 deaths. statistics right 100% effective death.

*Dumbasses* interesting see UK variant ever makes real impact Even better! China build hospital 10 days build mink farm sooner that. fever 104.3 2nd Moderna &amp; experiencing trembles. Doctors said I’ll fine. 5 days ago. I'm betting happening. (Berlin's great, way. Enjoy) I’m thinking like fine “violent aggression” lmao, would mean don’t wear mask? pancoronavirus vaccine would become part regular vaccine schedule get kid. wouldn’t outbreaks. Seems logical. You’re wrong place. Lmao country mine...smh... I'm trying understand position better. fact evidence support it, that's fine. tests groups, 0 deaths far people fully vaccinated. Inslee pissed. He’s gonna end lockdown soon. would like see older high risk people vaccinated priority. Lock-downs used arbitrarily damn near total disregard science keep forcing swallow, coronavirus? No. could happen would gamechanging. 17 years two sars viruses emerging humans found bats throughout China. likely jump humans again, maybe even quicker gets bats countries. vaccine ready day one would make outbreak couple deaths instead couple million. working home normal times would allow time ability socialize fun stuff logging friends. like socializing co-workers usually guy leaves clock 4:30 5:00 go hang friends, work home normal times would perfect ideal. getting opportunities easily see people actually like socializing would incredible. realize many teachers support staff 65 right? don’t think race really anything bigot boy. seen underground parties shut NYC? young black people. masks. may help understand. regards social compliance government authority. Contrast american society country form opinion. small “small”? Even 15% still pretty significant. unlikely verify people antibodies parts virus natural infection. going get universal corona virus vaccine Yes  I'm suggesting freedom implies respect towards who's around you. Freedom sandbox map whatever fuck want. That's meant. wont go philosophy. backwards? Frankly see permanent measure, way let society open world's luxuries like cinemas gyms, cases go down. wanna partake asap, well get vaccinated asap. see backwards. COVID can’t spread people unless people also voluntarily assume risk choosing participate outside world (and vaccines, won’t spreading much all, does, won’t matter people won’t get sick even know “had” it). know COVID exists, anybody leaves home and/or interacts another human assuming risk. get COVID transmissible (but that’s decreasing daily vaccines). narrative pretend normal activities like going work gym, eventually wanting take mask off, people forcing COVID onto others really isn’t true unless literally forcing people leave homes (or breaking homes).

Treating COVID like emergency appropriate point stops emergency. Temporary measures meant “flatten curve” minimize deaths end COVID causes hospitalizations deaths rate that’s comparable risks society voluntarily accepts various reasons (e.g. don’t ban driving even though would prevent ton car accident deaths know burden would place life isn’t worth it). Normal? I’m guessing next year. Open restrictions? End year (fall/winter).  Nothing... think eventually move point angry/resenting it. Good news: unlikely get seriously ill. Issue is, poor vaccinated, we're also screwed. They'll start mutate amongst poorer it'll get point it'll get rich countries they'll get infected since new mutations work vaccine. 

It's huge free-rider problem inevitable. health official tell December. reality people back normal summer regardless recommendations. vastly inferior terms efficacy point think many people skip would rather take two higher certainty they're going get virus badly Montana Dems also good waiting till August election year start mobilizing frantic push get people vote they’ve never talked before, unlike Repubs organizing like February year. solution socially distance , lockdown, wear masks end time?

You you, 95 percent people won’t live like that. link regards moderna vaccine exported. found nothing. 

The USA worse many nations, ability test. Latin America doin really badly, Africa. found sub. daily discussions every day since last March? honestly think foreign aid isn’t self-serving purposes? new thing? always thought normal small town bars. Cases skyrocketing? soon enough supply go around everyone, worry get 2nd shot scheduled.   Ever Alberta? every time think could really go chicken sandwich, check calendar. Agreed - Fuck Gianforte congratulations! believe personal charity something people make feel better, rather addressing reasons problem itself. “Hidden” you’re looking Probably. great chicken fast food restaurant. Dang, smart, remove car maker liability installing seat belts it? Save costs. American auto industry could use savings. pretty annoying opinion, it’s entirely opinion based. keep headlines? one ever said going 100% effective.  Treatment improved lot since then. like mandatory butt plug idea. I've genuinely thrilled recovery US.

You're due good fortune. lived Japan traveled Vietnam, Malaysia China extensively work + fun. speak experience. Maybe people would guess got placebo immune reaction like typically get vaccine. Arm hurting, red irritated skin injection site, etc. 

Just uneducated guess.  will. It’s different animal right due multiple variables. See comment 2-3 years. don’t know, Montana harder think. year last time Republican governor quite time ago, always seem 1 Democrat 1 Republican Senator. Plus swing voters like grandpa voted R life, Obama twice, Trump twice. differently? month two. already 25% adults one dose, almost everyone 70 clinically vulnerable done. Couple months we’ll good go; covid essentially bad cold /flu. Pretty sure to-go cocktails stay put Ohio too! not?? Everything else available curbside, favorite silver lining pandemic. vaccinations, millions people longer get it, reduce vector disease don’t shot. Thank you. That's good hear given worries local variant virus well value property. Worked ass it. willing hand someone wants it, well thats fight.

Myself everyone else work hard shit would absolutely, without question, let someone steal everything well I'd prepared kill another human. fact value materialistic shit human life highlights previous .223 Rem split second common range.

Get help. cool. badass. using term assault rifle argument playing fiddle old unlce Adolph.

Refer previous comment. You, anyone remotely familiar firearms even video games matter knows exactly I'm referring to. Furthermore, using 'assault' context attempting make point, reinforces suggestion bringing meaningless likely rehearsed talking point relevance actual make mind, AR-15 mighty efficient killing human, would equally efficient killing soft game like deer rabbits.

Ahh, yeeeah, almost AR-15's designed without soft game targets mind instead, like, know, maybe sustained fire military application and/or kill humans en masse. Even amateur hunter knows get one shot (rarely two) hit target; literally one going unloading even 5 rounds let along 20+ single practical applications except for... fun shooting one range?

I'd personally fun riding motorbike 200km/h motorway. Something fun translate practical appropriate precisely hero never claimed one. keep living simple quiet life harming anyone would appreciate others come demand conform views.

Unless someone came property tries stealing shit, case preemptively decided shoot \[with .223 Rem\]. Secondly, fucking views people coming demanding confirm to? talking mormons /S?

Seriously, presume already conform vast majority laws land. no, owning AR-15 ""assault rifle"" (I used REEEE) line drawn? Jesus fucking christ dude. hero

It's obvious sane person, though question much truely believe it. best bet scared little coomer troglodyte uses guns crutch feelings inadequacy.

I'm done shit, mate. Go back ""simple quiet life"" apparently comprises trolling Covid subreddit try bash country reasonable gun laws. Fucking pathetic. guess, I'd say close holiday season.

Global numbers highest mid December mid January, falling since.

While vaccine developed, doubt enough received yet explain significant decline rate.  Vaccinations border workers begins next week they’re essentially protected, it’s going be...quite UK get handle things. leave house unnecessary reason global pandemic even wear two masks get what's coming you. Back country morons. something reddit I'm missing? often get messages instant I'm answering messaging

Anyways, much worse HIV. get someone breathing way. far infections giving immunity, tell people 2 3 times. Covid going away. Get vaccines get Covid whatever. still take another shot two within year. sars whatever big deal, people flipping Vietnamese nurse caught it. Hospital workers calling sick, quitting scared. idea version cooled off. Covid, sars whatever, contagious 1/3 Americans caught now. Shit fucking scary regardless age, politics, race etc people still wearing masks wearing disposable masks. Username checks out. leave house unnecessary reason wear two masks deserve what's coming. Low IQ rednecks pay price sorry. kind feel comfortable wait least year reliable research etc.

Same, even US law books shields pharma companies liability regarding vaccines particular since public health emergency. design testing extremely rushed, top novel technology (mRNA), something *does* go wrong, however unlikely may be, harmed them, legal recourse made whole like would normal circumstances.

Unlike vast majority people though, least reclusive spend almost time isolated home, pandemic... hitting town every night putting people risk like young people seem be. doesn’t agree that? mutations happen. told mutation unlikely UK developed 2 different strains already. let virus continue swarm population, mutate much much bigger problem us. Unless barbecue, football accents. given conflicting advice many things

This challenge science communication dynamic situations like covid. scientist look existing research _think_ something might good advice. 3 months later research comes showing wrong, change advice [1]. That's ok, that's science works.

Typically scientists rightly hesitant share opinions without research know hard people changes. case though, trust experts opinion ok get things wrong along way. would concerned experts changing recommendations new information came out. See [1] diehards ignored RCTs done.

[1] Hydroxycholorquine great example. papers showed might work SARS1, anecdotes people thought might work. RCTs showed work may detrimental. later studies come showing maybe certain situation studied further, regardless turned silver bullet people wanted. Can't wait Osterholm Feigl-Ding relegated dust bins ignored twitter accounts. might lucky one. think even common side effects occur like ~70% time it’s guarantee you’ll side effects. Congrats finishing doses! yellow fever shots years ago, believe me, feel immunine system working.

If saline probably felt effects it. Maybe 100%, almost. Okay dummy, canf see diff 95% 50% efficiency I'm done replying you. already seeing many infections uk variant among vaccinated group country.  done worrying Covid realized I've known single person tested ""positive"" THAT'S IT.

Not testimony matters anyone I'm sorry, can't afraid something seems affecting hardly anyone end fine 99% time.

To whole thing politicized grab power control world governments. Everything keep telling us wrong outright lies skewed numbers figures.

I live house active people, 25, 27, 56 year old females well 61 year old male none us even know someone (Atlanta suburbs).

So yeah, die oh well, far see reason worried... worried least compare anything else kill me.  That's terrific news hear definitely! could people easily deduct? took part trial placebo saline, way tell. agreeing guy whining complaining see largely people like you. bit coming hopefuls goalpost shifting. I'm neither bot paid opinion, I'd guess vast majority either. 

A solid majority done shots summer. take month second dose done. two weeks reported makers. Secondly, two weeks *first* dose, 80% efficacy. Thank you. 

I'm paywalled original article discussing, appreciate one, similar, read. 

I'm old enough remember SARS well lived close one major outbreaks, followed developments closely years afterward. I've appalled last year ONE media talking long-term effects SARS potential devastating ""second epidemic"" set here. finally seeing discussion good, way, worry way late many. use logic applied give Obama credit low unemployment rate 2018 (linear extrapolation), trump surely get credit ending covid later year. Prior COVID avoided touching face, practiced good food safety, washed hands regularly, including ate anything. people fairly clean pre-COVID, really stepping game notch.

As shaking hands activities. Yes, intend that. also assume hand dirty so... like before. Keep working cardio brother. It’s important rule. Oh interesting. Yeah looks like Singapore Airlines. I’ve read vaccine reduces risk infection 99%. perfect great start! like get pay bills sure. What? argument person diabetes gets covid dies dying diabetes. complete nonsense. course comorbidity factor covid cause death. 

Yeah die eventually. get hit train cancer, died getting hit train... cancer. 

Covid kill comorbidity not, get wrong. almost half f Americans diagnosed issue one.

Hell fat comorbidity. overweight die getting covid, fucking died covid overweight. could lived 60 years fat fuck died cpvid come around. diabetes. Omg, slow? people willing go bars 1am pandemic going shit parties. Honestly though, shake hands, kiss first date, wash veggies fruits next years? course wear mask? Maybe I'm little paranoid first person know got died. 3 people know got wife kids. probably never see again. Fucking Covid pretty rare life considering 1out 4 people know died? 48, hospital, fucking scary ass place now.. Ahh naw American media portrays Asian families time Asian Americans make significant demographics certain areas. Maybe try look media outside bubble. vaccinating? otherwise they’ll going snap lockdowns country’s like UK vaccinated entire adult population stop worrying covid altogether. Start revamping education system country. failed oh many, oh actually working intended, point still stands. agree have? China: “No” Exactly. ever Skid Row.
Covid bad, people suffering long covid. never gets reported get clicks. Zazzdx cc, a, basically Covid beginning? make last longer, infection gives immunity thus contributes herd immunity. Covid HIV. weeks, entire life post nothing America it’s annoying go “bUt aMErIcA” ""haha America response bad""

*Looks vaccine response*

""haha America please help""  assuming new mutations make virus worse, virus falls category like coronaviruses contagious humans, spread really matter virus severe. heard we're better vaccine response best. [World Data Vaccine  us Montana great scientific opportunity. watch case numbers see happens. predict immediate impact, rise summer. Yes lot. case count nosedived Trying hire where? already dead don’t even know it. Makes peace tie loose ends. days left. agree, bunch hick losers florida. can't wishing get virus man. puts strain Healthcare workers.
It's frustrating know, better that. NZ yet begun vaccinations. begin border workers next Saturday, general public starting July. Since Air NZ airline really flying NZ, none crews vaccinated. Wow. sound like great person. friend idiot still like you. little dumb dumb. Happy Valentine’s Day you’re trying say media Angel sensationalism dead you’re wrong. coming ardent progressive cases case went case went case large, several locking mechanisms help hold overflow, made Samsonite. think there’s not-so-insignificant group people sub cheer pandemic Dude people distancing another year. Pfizer main vaccine EU, enough own. Astra's vaccine lot better nothing. firmly believe explosion depressions pass one year milestone. really hope governments take account start working measures reopening socializing tools (restaurants, theaters, gyms etc) like last summer. bit indication - CFR South Africa going great book. Weirdly, review top one Amazon. Yeah, surprised 90 year olds die given week absurd. 

I remember article freaking vaccine seemed minor temporary facial paralysis side effect. 

At half rate occurred general population. hooray, apparently held too! needs children anyway, care 90 year olds world C problem accepting AZ pretty much giving chance better one (you placed vera end queue). stupidest part comment “quarantine babies”. Birth rates actually falling quite dramatically instances. Actually much Midwest lacking workers. tons jobs industry. I'm also talking sticks... Indianapolis, grand rapids, saint Louis, Louisville on.

These manufacturing jobs blue collar. Management Engineering hard come by. well playing positions too.

Source: Trying hire. Huh, almost like exact post thanksgiving Christmas wave said would be.

How many extra people think killed? 50,000? More?

January 8th spot two weeks Christmas. Lab 🐀 We’re #1. mention healthcare authorities openly said attribute around 90% excess mortality COVID. /s lol ""now"" Scrambled eggs *over* face, boy do? Cool, I'm them. Deaths trending down, US world. explain fellow Europeans numbers dropping? biden-imposed measures seasonal thing?

 

I know Coronaviruses less actice Europe May October, hence genuine question. exaggerating saying like Trump used attack them. like him. awful role model. need provides comfort/entertainment. Owning gun designed kill humans bring unless total psychopath. give BS hunting, come family lot hunters, AR-15s/similar guns optimal deer large animal hunting. 

But sort missing point. said I'd rather functioning government puts health well first something completely frivolous like overkill weapon. fact response OC ""lol well I'd rather able AR-15 functional leadership protects family/friends/myself"" says lot you. average response means. unfortunately, big world NOTHING fair. Massachusetts haha  Nocebos say hello. Genuinely can't tell satire. know things going well close matching Argentina anything.  gave lifetime Washington State Ferries pass 90 year old Wenatchee?? That's... well... going get much use. :) Maybe, doubt it. We’re vaccinating high-risk people faster rate infection spread even peak. even 2 weeks first shot there’s decent immunity. Cases may spike again, don’t think ever see another major surge deaths.  also pointed using personal twitter account fundraising efforts. Also consult health department prior action. Talk political animal.

All course time new virulent strains entering state. Conservatism mental disorder. They're trying keep expectations low way people happy lifted. That's thought process it. start seeing things happening better around May 1 May 1 July 4th would say.

If substantial waves summer though suspect mitigation back going much less.back normal even bad waves. Would literally worse flu actually probably milder. Really? week heard admit going quite more. depressed, glad nothing dangerous house One drink. argue makes sense beneficent govt standpoint. truth seen expendable class. job market great right now? childcare, move away friends &amp; family currently providing cheap/free, affordable?  Booze makes parties better eradicate smallpox? Even organization problems, fix problems. idea World Health Organization value value moving forward.

Edit: Also CCP shady fuck, throwing there. like real China! End summer : fall even get us peasants. Maybe. PhD science friend worked one labs told last Feb "" novel"" meant. took spare coins bought stocks accordingly. figured solid year LEAST bought, wrong, sadly. China says originated somewhere else though certain age yes. considering employees 40 eliminates us qualification. won’t! encampment located? Covid every state buffoon hits Alberta fucked..... Ucp could nothing stock market based confidence well stock market do. stock market still confident stock market starts go sideways, US government give huge cash infusion. say it’s constant, circuit breaker lockdowns literally happened 4 times across country, state. Outside people major hotspots close contacts covid cases, Australian (the VAST majority) spend 5 days lockdown yet since state eliminated covid.

Western Australia eliminated virus first wave, enjoyed majority year restriction free, 3 days home get control again, return complete freedom? Sounds like constant issue me, it’s never ending struggle!

Queensland basically same, spent year restriction free year everywhere else virus spreading like crazy, 3 days home? Completely unsustainable strategy! They’re never going shake covid

These things aren’t anywhere near constant seem think are. Australia easily populated zero covid country, easily letting people back in, anyway shock leaks (which outside one outlier early on, swiftly easily taken care of)? Wow I’m sorry hear that. Even conservative COVID friends went camping last summer, friends def anomaly.

I'm 17 really want take this, yet can't US. Meanwhile, lucky guys declining like nothing! thought COVID dec 2019. Took antibody test last April negative Gallatin County still effect. theoretical reinfection rate 20%. I'm saying 20% people reinfected. cells prevent reinfection prevent severe illness. virus five times likely get compared people antibodies terms reinfection god damn excited daylight savings. extra hour plus extra minutes daylight building huge thing.  HAHAHHAHAHAHA KEEP CRYING. GOVERNOR LEGEND Yes, misinterpreting saying. saying mask wearing, given ability prevent spread variety illnesses, continue past pandemic (if day ever come). Flu, common cold, endemic covid, potentially newly emerging viruses mitigated wearing masks. So, no, nobody asshole, thinking outside box recognizing american society re-think tendency carelessly spread germs, whereas asian societies wearing masks prevent spread illness long covid ever around. I’m 41 yo mom started coming here, bc like chat anonymity unlike Facebook, esp bc opinions common part US, I’ve noticed really angry people Reddit. Like almost abusively aggressive.

T-Cell immunity also plays large factor virus, re-infection rate anywhere near 20%. understand people would apprehensive vaccine side effects. vaccine developed record time there’s lot data it’s new. Doctors scientists seem think it’s safe looking side effects first dose. end day, much higher chance dying COVID vs dying vaccine. know, maybe makes ripple March April. see variant big impact unless reinfection rate like 50%. think vaccine likely pace otherwise.

Fine, I’ve v-c zinc balanced since birth. testing related though. winter worse spring, way counted cases spring. 

Hell way counting now, reached point testing tests really revealing many cases.(Testing people such) area makes magnet crazies? sure. get point reopening probably fine (though obviously, still careful it. keep people desk jobs easily wfh working home. avoid packed clubs we've gotten numbers even lower everyone vaccinated is) 

the point I'm making we're good ways point right now.

so worry see stuff improving, think ""lets ease everything"", run risk regressing everything. instead hitting point june timeframe hit july/august later. Yup. people really going realize ends one day almost cases get late May. President Trump said, one day going go poof that's what's happening now. really new normal going go back old normal rapidly economy mostly pick really really rapidly suspect.

Even fauci saying masks several, several, months now. think masking largely done summer except maybe airplanes school, sheer amount students systemically homeless dependent upon schools work/ education towns jobs... astounding. Thanks voice reason. UK strains they're probably going somewhat another surge. mean Florida already pretty normal honest kind delay last bit maybe month return normal life get it? still pretend I’m biohazard 24/7 another year? yet stock market keeps going up. spooky.

At point, something give, less less center hold. Dominance one thing, surge cases another. It’s Florida 2 months really hasn’t done thing. I’ll shocked see sort new surge. 😑 meh Trump suggested using Hydroxychloroquine ward Covid-19. couple hearing that. Wife survived husband died.

Listening president US actually deadly. trial, chief. I’ve nonchalant I’ll say it: you’re welcome. lot Reddit truly stood believed chinas claims shock someone leverages house house houses needs rental income pay mortgage. someone needs make money. doubting intentions ""flex rent"" normal business practice business (30, 60, 90 days accounts receivable) landlord using money gift.

The market created it, is, can't deny it. Charity nice good wanted, can't (and shouldn't) depend it, can't build life around it. guess depends definition ""mild annoyance"" symptomatic people seem experience pretty severe flu symptoms though recover. Also lingering fatigue, loss taste smell along serious ""long-haulers"" also absolute dread anxiety knowing positive. knowing could exposed, long isolate, long symptoms last get worse. seasonality, though? flu season well. think people try pinpoint one variable way simplistic. 

Based I've seen (so absolutely, completely 100% anecdotal), city people way social ""close"" Summer rates incredibly low. cold weather hit, everything started ramping back again.

Does indoor vs outdoor transmission? Seasonal boosts transmission rate virus? Holiday gatherings? three? Maybe none? Maybe factor accounted for? Maybe true spread disease great much closer herd immunity thought? huge percentage people natural immunity?

Because also city, told would Thanksgiving Xmas ""spike"" numbers peaked Thanksgiving turn true. However, NYC 2 hours away, spike deeper Winter could plausibly blamed holidays.

100 miles us somehow, Philadelphians gather holidays NYCers did? much difference culture? 

Lots questions answers. Either way, bad numbers rapidly dropping lot good look forward let analysts sort out.

Just rambling bit. tend disagree ""holiday gathering"" hypothesis previous spike clean reason, also stinks partisanship (""we're mess people socially distance holidays"" etc etc). Old people likely die contracting virus, that’s they’re front line. Meh Nah... people feel strongly enough downvote everything that's unbridled optimism raging media/Twitter randos/lockdowns, including people asking basic questions. Yep bu guess required longer lockdown get situation handled 3 days one Yea remember state began reopening tier would unlock vaccines. give metrics much population needs vaxxed fully reopen.

I'm beginning think Florida right plan along. don’t think it’s normal. child tests positive, removed home. also would passport can’t use faced restrictions travel country. there’s chance could put lockdown point time. 

I’d much prefer US response. Freedom isn’t free. 

Also, zero covid isn’t long term strategy. Eventually countries move life. NZ going keep borders shut forever? isn’t natural immunity there. dependent vaccinating majority population. prefer term selfish asshole idiot. Tfw wanna meet Jesus means necessary OK UK second worst developed country planet handling Covid. make feel better? know still crying America outperformed yet again. Note difference strain variant. Variants, iirc effected vaccine strains cannot. variants understand either. 

Too many people seem forget pretending steep cliff edge feet make safe walking/falling edge.  
Reality give FUCK beliefs.... I'm American never worry Trump's administration. However, least Trump transparent, mishandled, whole world knew it. least could go America get whatever data would required. little update everybody King’s confirmed cause death: Sepsis. You’re CA ‘closing’ doesn’t compare NZ Australia’s closing though. hE’s OfFiCe ShOrT civil. Yes, matter. Gibraltar UK territory deaths attributed UK. surprise they're terrible too. Funny call us uneducated know territories. Covid serious sure, younger good health likely fine. right.  There’s enough genomic testing know becomes dominant variant. thousand samples tested per week US. must credentials verified mod team wish claim them. We?

Your post history says live Ireland.  often reflexively downvote anything anti-vaccine too, don’t take harshly. 

The best thing us end thing right aside wearing masks social distancing encourage others vaccinate. 

Your concerns seemed legitimate rather usual lunacy, happy help. Yes?! need find extremely mild flu-type illness covid, decide vaccine get? Ventilator sounds intensify. Fair enough. Better interpretation made. true btw. Shrinks make bundle misery. That's California never strong restrictions NZ, people listening stay home orders, people traveling across state lines. last one big issue, California even able close borders thet could much better now. they'll again, again, another time that! Cuz that's works. There's many people planet. jabbing slowed Israel then? Fair enough; read wrong. somewhere Memorial Day dream forever. r/NoShitSherlock right vote best interests spread potentially life altering life ending disease :)))  think international borders amongst last restrictions dropped, different countries going different stages vaccinations year. think end year. Keep information high quality. realise Belgium third world country, explains death rate higher UK's... sure enlightened truth! It’s fact foreign agents want cause chaos disinformation. there’s also dummies fall spread it. 💯 Kissing vaccines. really blame them? People given year lives this, clear sacrifice done much anything help situation. can't go like forever. lived Louisiana year thing *really* miss drive Daiquiri places. caught happy hour could get 2 1 $7. yea, hell Friday night! \*feature, bug 


C'mon, considering zeitgeist last administration, anyone really surprised? Grossed maybe, surprised? worth trouble getting angry it. worry that's it.

If got arms every time someone broke nonsensical restrictions, would never even remotely happy. be. think lot people never take granted again. Oh we're making even new bullshit justify ourselves. Belgium dosen't matter? Slovenia dosen't? Gibraltar dosen't? San Marino dosen't? disgusting attitude have, want pretend third world countries?

I always thought meme ""America number 1"" people uneducated bigots, shown true. Congrats. Dismissing symptoms poor explanation fact still sick. Doctors telling patients ages illnesses heads. 

That thinking belongs back two hundred years ago. Brofist Israel. Lets get em jabs going. rate, might get finish line us, would absolutely awesome see. Oh means want around people, average trump flag waiver around quote “I want beer guy” heartbeat. Yessir! universal flu vaccine holy grail viral immunology ages. reason isn’t one yet it’s hard pull off, lack effort. Oh wow, heard that. Hopefully vaccines &amp; boosters make unnecessary.

One major issues whole pandemic seems messaging. ""end point"" *should* move confronted new information, that's science works. difficulty endgame looks different depending disease impacts people.

A 2 week respiratory disease death rates similar flu? goal really needs keeping hospitals overwhelmed. Beyond that, enter pretty ambiguous space. 

Now turns kids developing MIS-C clearing infections even know mechanism. turns ""respiratory disease"" directly infect basically every organ system including nerves brain. turns insignificant portion ""asymptomatic"" people develop organ damage may permanent. turns variants infectious, also increases danger populations previously less likely get disease transmit (like children).

What kind response merit? lot decision basically arbitrary since depends weigh issues other. I’m sure increased vaccinations lack holidays nothing Ohio open last night felt free :) Florida's decrease cases significantly lagging national decrease (13% vs. 23% week week) use entirety capacity produce Pfizer. There’s strong possibility may brain dead  feel stranglehold late 90s early 00s. look ASEAN trade group, massive explosion manufacturing southeast Asia, many major companies halting growth China, manufacturing sector actually starting stagnate transition service economy past. Still note king now, trends look interesting You’re welcome, sweetheart. Glad could understand basic body maintenance routines. post looks bit scary pretty open interpretation. clear means ""building safety daily life"". mean better hygiene, maybe wearing masks staying home sick? mean restrictions continue forever?

He also says ""Yes, things we'll different while, mean resume regular lives"" seems convey opposite sentiment. CCP Liars Liars Plants hires. Testing changed. time. June 
feels like one big blur. Thank knowing one. This. remember vaccines touted key return normalcy, they’re diminished merely “tool toolkit,” along masks social distancing. actuality, many feels like we’re still square 1 end sight. past year it’s doom gloom without consistent information life able return normal. People judge want get fully vaccinated couple weeks I’m living life again. current existence one worth living :( People sacrificed much long they’re sick it. one life live Lol it’s not. fact news December, head Govt. statistics organization held speech parliament.


And specifically stated numbers statistics. official covid data reporting patients proven active covid, case Russia atleast death.(Russia tests corpses antibodies) 

Whereas RosStat reports excess mortality, includes people died, example, result lasting conditions virus eliminated entirely body.

But also people like cancer patients, completely denied surgeries half year due clinics focus covid. despite obviously dying covid never EVER encountering virus system. MuH rIGhTs!!!1!1  lot people hypochondriacs I’d imagine embellishing.  Yeah, true. point still stands. people cushy WFH jobs, accumulated money. looking spend money things missing on, means thousands jobs openings entertainment, dining, hotel tourism industries less fortunate desperate need job. state Covid cases began US still baffles readily many Americans happy give personal freedom pandemic.

This comment seems criticizing people raise concern.

Wild times...

Edit: I’m referring masks, self imposed quarantine months end many people die lowered numbers? 4 80 know got far. Milder 4 second time That's mL saline going veins, 0.5 mL going muscle. We’re far away beating UK variant vaccine: aren’t going declare pandemic one day flip right back normal overnight. It’s going gradual process getting back normal. lot things (like international tourism, large conventions etc) going take longer come back normal things indoor dining restaurants. government doesn’t actively fight scientists, Pillow CEO Neurologist chief medical advisors infectious disease.

This nothing conjecture . state actually policy opinion Australia implemented US didn’t?

Or policy scientists recommended wasn’t implemented? Totally agree you: percentage can't wrong *and* statistically true live? light end tunnel spring break gonna fuck us?  totally deluding think entire world going declare sort trade war China damage global economy time everyone wants recover virus. Nothing going develop. Regardless whether virus emerged negligence wet markets negligence lab, outcome same. Nothing done now. China remain rival US, matter much Americans might hate that.
 
The bombshell would deliberate man-made virus, idiotic conspiracy theory point. woman straight murdered mask, actual jackwagon can't wear mask months.

Did read quote?? 
  government’s top infectious disease expert told ABC’s “Good Morning America” Friday **by time 75% 80% population vaccinated, “the level virus community could low could start pulling back bit stringent public health measures.”**
  
Hes talking masks. He's saying hit 80% vaccinated start pulling back stringent measures **a bit**. saying okay. restrictions lifted. okay wearing mask people vaccinated. Maybe end April so. I'm okay 80% population vaccinated still stringent measures place.
  
Quit straw man argument. arguing one right now.  Felt like got covid soon walked damn joint

Then turned around left felt afraid virus bowling alley. ridiculous all.... serious issue noone knew was. reports crematoriums ordering pallets urns. chinese actions year pushback letting come serious panic mode likely taken measures cover lot deaths. 

The numbers going reported. think country outside eastern Europe transparent America whats ridiculous. article makes case russia may top deaths cant conclusively say so. rural areas actually elevated hospital rates spreading rural areas much faster rates. Cities simply cases due people Thank Thought done replying.

Not job cite claim reinfections unspecified country. 

Have wonderful day. Iv seen American conservatives argue changed testing protocol standards something make numbers seem better Biden. sounds rediculous truth that? Thanks! It’s dynamic question habits people different areas. Rural counties less inclined enforce mask usage compared urban areas. it’s probably difficult number quantify satire. Americans beginning think like am. healthy, young adults continue change lifestyles shield ""Grandma""? Maybe time obese, weak elderly shut stay home? Flu r0 1.3

Covid r0 5.7

Your whole flu vaccine eff 50% fine 50% vaccine eff covid flawed. lack logic knowledge giving false sense reality.

For sources, Google search, I'm Alexis, cant find simply handicap arguing anyone. contrary, last months show federalism good thing. Again, president.  decrease stop?

Australia New Zealand brought zero without vaccine. Aggressive contact tracing isolation cases combined vaccines would powerful thing. results whole population, researchers estimated 63% people Eastern Cape infected since epidemic started, 32% Northern Cape, 46% Free State 52% KwaZulu-Natal.

There various percentages provinces. math involved.

Also, selection bias. people willing donating blood likely people willing around people, therefore likely exposed virus.

Also too, must look median age country, younger median age, people survive COVID-19. median age South Africa still make difference vis vis public compliance! People masked then, mask vice versa. definitely agree, Canada also huge population Punjabi Sikhs (like me).

A lot want Khalistan, independent Punjab state India, see Indian part India. 

I definitely agree Indians though bring excellent point :) Masks remain. social distancing places.

Once government removes mandates, picking choosing go depending mask mandate not.

This grocery store mandate? Guess I'll go somewhere else. like guys think debunking me. everything Xi Jinping done wrong, got tweets people see. Trump did. Also healthcare system centralised China's, data collection COVID independent reliable. 

Clearly user trying equate America's secrecy China's, objectively even close since outlets like BBC banned China (and Hong Kong).  Source? mask, actual jackwagon can't wear mask months. minor inconvenience best. Fauci saying can't leave home.

The point wearing masks longer period time hammer cases hard possible get zero close possible, ensuring new variant suddenly arises middle vaccination process. Coronials supposed ""gotcha"" moment.  kids in-person since august. gone fantastic. Yes... blatant lie media always intended tell... never going fair investigation. suppose I'm saying think ""won even knew fight""...that sort means knowledge going ground we'd like be. many ways nature say GO FUCK HOME HUMANS STAY THERE! Depends US. death statistics pretty good take deaths county divide 0.003 0.006 depending think fatality % give rough estimate total cases county. divide number total population get %. county like 10-20% estimated infected (8% pop confirmed infected) I’m Maccabi HMO referenced it’s fascinating watch relief people feel three weeks second injection utter frustration feel selfish get vaccinated. barely month he's office, effects Presidency felt years come.

Also intricately tied American Covid response, yes, people still talking him. Maybe herd immunity infection thing. agree. I'm progressive one thing really really scares prospect vaccines labeled ""The Clinton Vaccine"". Thankfully came time administrations could take credit anti vaxxers largely apartisan I'll make clearer: 

\-The vaccine reduces chance symptomatic infection 94%. 
\-For get infected chance severe disease (In Israel defined severe pneumonia saturation lower 94%) reduced 92% compared unvaccinated cases. 

Hope makes clearer. That’s think people get infected again, South African variant seen official reinfection. Hopefully norm. Also know natural anti body response actual virus less vaccines. need people vaccinated ASAP! can’t let guard Kind opposite... used eat lot didn’t enjoy cooking. Kind liked saving money pandemic mostly cooking home plan continue that. I’ve discovered enjoy cooking, didn’t enjoy time involved already office day.

Definitely putting money saved straight travel funds can. 1. couple N95 masks bough 4 years back, figure still good go?
2. also planning order N95 masks. many times mask worn needs disposed? Great !!!!! 👏 exactly US recently dropped cases? Pass vaccines? vaccine like thing modern medicine provides: quick fix get us situation didn’t in. reward work time. understanding rural areas typically hit harder per capita? may wrong. Regardless, wish vaccines openly available everyone. Yes well keep exact types pandemics refuse make large scale global changes. industrialization environmental destruction continue destroy biomes forcing animals humans interact increasing zoonotic infections. make real changes international travel person catch infectious diseases delayed incubation period one part world travel side planet undetected even presenting symptoms. Wealthy nations continue ensuring perpetual poverty less developed nations order exploit natural resources ensuring poor healthcare infrastructure areas stops chance catching outbreaks disease become epidemics. international plan address global issue well roll dice continhe reactionary fact hope 2,000 emerging infectious diseases discovered year none turn global catastrophes. SARS, Avian flu, Swine flu, ebola, MERS, COVID, next _______ I'm thinking November 18th mark COVID-19 Armistice Day mark cessation hostilities western front. Gun reform literally effect Covid whatsoever. move place might murdered gay. Sounds lovely. Read article watch video article.  sources there. Maybe express right. ability leave club bar drink change encourage people drink driving. 

It’s perfectly legal Germany less drunk driving guys.

Drunk driving caused lack public transit gives people ability get home safely. 

In many places USA even walk home bar due lack wide walks. public transit get home either. people make bad choices.

I suggest guys start looking countries solved problems. need reinvent wheel.

Only give licenses sell alcohol bus metro stop close by. establishment close 30 mins last available service. Also car parks bar. people take bus get take back. It’s really interesting, I’m Spain, numbers cases raised lot, much compared US, public health system collapse weeks. Still alert. usually shit US public health system, seems private system coped pandemic stress lot better (here private hospitals too, ant full public ones, private insurance use private hospital it’s emergency, public system really slow) . Please compare zero covid people people pushing mitigating climate catastrophe thanks Well yeah, they're gonna vaccinate population. Although seem really dragging feet it. go. biggest predictor lingering symptoms whether it’s post viral fatigue new autoimmune disorder female. Long haul symptoms experienced women almost 4 1 compared men maybe even higher. Oh no! I'm really sorry hear - really wear body mind time. Hoping round bad clear us move toward better health overall. Get whatever vaccine available soon possible. affect releasing data rest world. disease cost trillions dollars millions lives.

China wants #1 spot take heat. Release data investigators get truth. ran people suppose Oh know, questions dedicated figured I'd post response yours. Kansas? done nationally? Anyway, result quick jump number positive tests change made fairly [steady 7-day average ~250K/day 7th January ~96K/day yesterday. Yes, that's exactly suspected. infection tiny chance causing mutation, multiple millions infections odds one mutations happening increases **Tomorrow vaccine shot day I'm nervous, get not?** 

I'll getting Oxford vaccine I'm young, I'm worried south Africa banned exact vaccine temporarily replace johnsons vaccine, wait months take vaccine actually helps variants data out? ça en fait des accidents de trottinettes quand même... Yeah, except people seem forget GOOD science, replicated, takes months years solid proof peer revision accepted community large.

There’s way believe less years time Science changed much mask wearing. knew efficacy shortcomings masks year ago, everything else molded sculpted public messaging order affect compliance. yet stats show 5% unemployment something like that... Maybe it’s snow greater part us that’s it, hope it’s first statement exact numbers hand majority UK AstraZeneca, rest Pfizer. awesome, thank you! understand kept close home. nothing lose unless violated treaty/alliance. know originated there. suspect how. give us full story make sure happen even deadlier virus. Two positive Pc women. Hospitalizations NY dropped 20% little week. NZ Australia forever, though? ever plan re-join world allow travel countries? Fact matter world may never get rid COVID fully they’ll find another way deal locking everytime new case pops up. can’t forever. Pay Wall  Nice! many type vaccine? is.  complain them, there's still people working shops, delivering food, people like get stay home cozy safe.

These workers immune Covid. spread it. easy write-off spread ""oh rulebreakers"" fact is, essential workers spread too. Science evolves learn more. hard concept. Currently relapse. Got infected March. absolutely hellish year two weeks later though, told, along everyone else, 6 years ago. new kids block new change, know upload to. hard check, every company managed fine? ...but you’re saying won’t wear random holiday. hey, Sputnik V works, right... Riiiight?... Gibraltar part UK. Scotland is. People taking less seriously lol Yup cities need start getting back moving need vaccines far farmers interacting others without mask first place without caring didn’t say we’ve reached herd immunity. tens millions citizens longer (or unlikely to) contract virus means less opportunity virus spread. Oh okay yeah sure people make proper risk assessments things.  see got downvoted. People don’t realize 1918 Spanish flu didn’t start Spain. cute countries like NZ one strict national lockdown which, iirc, nine months ago. Yeah, I've heard couple anecdotes (well fact, course) rumors circulating parts China ""new flu"" least far back October. extremely infectious deadly at-risk groups, yeah... reason dangerous spreads without killing majority people.

I'm cautious, afraid pointless me. Yes, could get die I'm largely safe. I'm cautious others that's really it. No. excessive deaths statistics, nothing else. country's data changed based excessive deaths reports.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* means likely circulating Hubei province (province Wuhan located in) long December already showing US December.

Currently, many experts seem consensus outbreak origin seems China though started nearby regions. reason bats initially suspected quickly nothing wet markets fact earliest case coronavirus similar effect years ago miners came contact bat feces clean. case, outbreak could started China, parts SEA, and/or parts Africa locations bats known live/migrate communities regions use bat guanos medicine though I'm sure covid survive guanos processed pills. guano carry covid, bad theory either considering guano heavily used fertilizer well. Wearing mask public great sacrifice. 

But locking inside entire year, refusing go see family? 

It’s extreme, it’s shocking little encouragement people needed completely ruin life’s. Well I'm surprised 5000% Nope. problem, ain’t fucking job help you. Help yourself. 

Life messy complicated. People stupid shit cannot stop them. 

Accept, breathe, let go. Omg wish😩😩 fuck embellishment. People tend suggest 2020 much longer year simply felt like forever them. I’m sure sarcasm like comment want list ways US fucked response. think numbers speak themselves. We’re owed 600M doses Pfizer Moderna end June. happen we’ll need receive daily average ~4M per day rest way. Fair points!! think he’ll fine, it’s still first week. lot Latin America close countries terms deaths would probably equal remove undercounting Well I’m pretty sure always “herd immunity”, thinking back “flatten curve” days, putting aside— even know we’ve reached herd immunity though?? don’t know true percentage that’s herd immunity threshold, don’t know true number people already achieved natural immunity, deaths/hospitalizations/cases fall low levels 70-80% vaccination, lot less death  likely people never left house little social life before. feel good thinking anti-social lifestyle makes responsible even heroes, want end. That’s really good point, don’t like they’ve become issue people see two ‘sides’ instead looking objectively. I’m gonna murder someone hanging friends maskless. I’m gonna go nursing home sneeze everyone I’m actually sick. always start new company old stoped serving costumers well

This true market need really big investment research makes impossible nearly impossible start new company. Even then, prevent big company buy small ones prevent competition. 
Also, address point someone buying road prevent people accessing particular business... Again, help slightest. Well, comparing Russian excess deaths excess deaths countries. That's right way go it. OK helpful thanks, I'll take tomorrow, scared duo south Africa decision stop oxford replace johnsons vaccine Cool. they’ll sending two-thirds doses to... say... Bangladesh?

Sounds lot like “American Social Security recipients overwhelmingly oppose socialism”. Let go. zero control situation. Breathe let go. 

Seriously. Holding onto shit bad you. Literally one said it’d temporary. don’t establish government agency temporary thing.  March 2020, posted FB masks helping everyone got shredded 

I don’t understand getting voted  Duh. can't believe anyone ever thought otherwise. I'm getting really tired whole ""We technically know sure, worst case scenario might true"" crap. helping. place worse Sub. reason testimonial people think feel even Pandemic 

People thrive negativity know respond it

People seem forgotten absorb process good news second peak(rates dropping fast moment) still amazing. politicians pushing end lockdowns consensus want wait bit certain. want open early again, cases go up, lockdown again.

Currently predictions near normality May/June, time plan vaccinated adults. Average != median 

But yeah, guess give benefit doubt always reach herd immunity. 70-80% people vaccinated. think even. 

A resistant variant could emerge poor country vaccine access go extinct advantage maybe disadvantage compared original. pops country half people vaccinated maybe takes hold. 

Well theory. Exactly lobbying.

Liquor stores want competition go cups. Basically US market tapped out/dominated vaccine manufactures time get out. 

So... they'll try see get slice pie Europe high income countries competition Moderna Pfizer (I predict European countries want rejab Astra-Zeneca recipients) 75% doses distributed administered. We're definitely point supply, administration, become primary bottleneck. Yup. fact downvoted trolls telling well.

Fuck china. =) family eligible take Covid-19 test New Jersey likely wait June us eligible. possible way us get vaccine time period? Congratulations haven’t life uprooted dont find restrictions burdensome IMO requiring 70% population vaccinated, ignoring natural immunity, lifting mask mandates completely nutty, yeah, hope fact hospitalization/death rates low levels much much 70% what’s looked at, don’t lot faith bad lot people see England UK one same. Yeah, tired, too. Everyone‘s tired. don‘t care anyone‘s grandma, don‘t surprised others don‘t care opinion. now?  extremely deadly.

It really isn't. qualify stuff like Ebola?

Infinitely deadly? lot people said 9/11 TSA security enforcement airport would temporary

I feel like remember people saying we'd never fly work skyrises again, feels likely people saying we're going stuck forever mask mandates.

Maybe go away quickly people would like, take anyone seriously predicting 2-3 months advance, seems like matter time. here. going wear it, wear right.

I think point pandemic time start talking unmask. answer can't continue vague people stop bothering right now.

I think vagueness making people start say, I'm sick this. go back normal? I've heard way people talk zerocovid people I've actually seen zerocovid people. finding this?

It's seems likes big moral panic small percent looneys. old guy traumatic injury going hospital getting pneumonia? sounds like something happened millions times covid happen millions times well r/unpopularopinion Cool. Thanks clarifying. Proof qualify. I’m US thing employer told qualified due type work make appointment doctor pharmacy choice. told bring “proof eligibility”. think pay stub healthcare transportation company’s name No. would resulted people catching virus well, would noticed.  video following link best context. He's referring get enough people vaccinated. context video, least took it, believes able enough people vaccinated June/July start rolling back health measures, would include masks.

The reason would need wear masks 2022 something goes wrong vaccine rollout, new variant screws us (unlikely) half country refusing take shot (becoming less likely every UK cases gradually increasing leading spike December. UK variant Florida since December see cases going opposite way. roughly third population natural immunity vaccine rolling fast, don’t see UK variant making much noise. (Reuters) - Israel’s largest healthcare provider Sunday reported 94% drop symptomatic COVID-19 infections among 600,000 people received two doses Pfizer’s vaccine country’s biggest study date. Health maintenance organization (HMO) Clalit, covers half Israelis, said group also 92% less likely develop severe illness virus. “It shows unequivocally Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine extremely effective real world week second dose, found clinical study,” said Ran Balicer, Clalit’s chief innovation officer. showed us couple examples, **that’s them, standard epidemiological investigation**,” said Dominic Dwyer, Australian microbiologist team. “So then, know, interpretation data becomes limited point view, although side might see quite Fischer said seen inconsistencies data made available Wuhan couldn’t undertake deeper analysis without seeing raw data. **The provision data would case countries**, government Trump next nothing

Is said another thread now, argued Pfizer vaccine manufactured Germany shouldn’t exported.

So what’s different AZ UK manufactured doses? Pretty blatant hypocrisy part. Oh no, sounds like may picked COVID slightly around time shot 1 2, right? I’m still surprised daily covid numbers Israel despite many people vaccinated Like rest Reddit, echo chamber half. Exactly. Like sure, death rate nursing home residents got vaccinated suddenly much higher haven’t been, quite worrying. I’ve seen nothing suggest that, conspiracy articles rely reading actually thinking. lot people said 9/11 TSA security enforcement airport would temporary, could something like happen mask mandates restrictions? 

For it’s hard guys think? Australia federal system btw pretty hard lie awake rage night people incredibly stupid shit putting family members risk. dumbass cousin decided ""quarantine"" family tested positive covid going live grandma.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* theory really disagree you, someone who's COVID I'm really rushing get vaccine till easily available general public. given relatively common get false positive/negative COVID test, many people assume sick actually it, many people get know asymptomatic, etc. see useful way actually putting practice. could antibody tests, last thing need steps delay process getting vaccine peoples' arms. limited america? They’re popping place. Brah. Yeah clearly mask mandate isn’t miracle solution it’s disheartening governor couldn’t bothered even bare minimum pretending give shit.  guess we’ll see. 70k deaths per year 200 per day. actual rate March lower infections down, even 200 per day, don’t see restrictions staying place. Yep

Unless speak terror agree wholeheartedly something people Sub don’t read well first started learning COVID, **eight years ago** 2020, 

?? really think virus Wuhan December means authorities knew whole time ignored it?

There's bit Schroedinger's CCP going here, suggests they're nearly omniscient virus time pretty incompetent controlling covering up.

We know medical system missed something like 19 20 cases virus early epidemic. Seattle initial outbreak lifecare facility medical authorities thought contained. Seattle Flu Study took respiratory samples they'd collected cold + flu testing violated protocols rtPCR tested SARS-CoV-2 found positive sample showed unmonitored community spread (and world knew virus test it).

We also know virus spreading Italy late-Nov/mid-Dec cryptically. first confirmed cases Jan 31st. first confirmed deaths Feb 22nd. That's 1.5-2 month lag virus Italy nobody knew about.

Given asymptomatically virus spreads due fact ""just"" viral pneumonia (there literally single symptom causes caused circulating respiratory virus) virus always well established population doctors realize way many cases pneumonia going once.

They fucked up, always going fucked up.

I'm much pissed China current cover see broad daylight going here. much widespread availability respiratory samples Dec 2019 sequencing analysis, people (vaccinated people) collecting bat shit every mountain ravine Hubei. Wastewater samples Dec destroyed ""per standard procedure"" (procedures better fucking changing China better treating samples epidemiological gold right?). Instead China trying everything place origin virus outside China obscure source virus can't anything preventing happening future.

TL;DR: Blame China right things. Stop wishing make simple China could stopped virus. stop jacking WIV lab release. There's ton shit going right blame for. Laughs Darwin misunderstood numbers. way way off. Still, people age still take precautions even vaccine. Even though good preventing severe illness, perfect. Also, never thought masks big deal compared changes (some us) made lives stop pandemic. Usa fighting alone, India, Japan, Israel, Australia part Europe would join party. one ever world. ceasars till Hitler. I'll take 30,000-person concert went last Saturday evidence, cheers anyone know: Based transmission rate &amp; fatality rate, point covid-positive individual encountered enough people likely caused, led to, one deaths?

For example, covid-positive individual encountered 2 people effect someone's eventual fatality? encountered 10 people? 50? 100? etc. little article FACT reinfections. peer reviewed study reinfections. want talk reinfections? invite /r/covid19. Reinfections going occur, undoubtedly, like viruses. sings far pointing extremely uncommon short time frame. taking vaccinations consideration, proven (at least mRNA vaccines) elicit much stronger immune response natural infection.

I know point regarding mutations even is. can't draw conclusions virus mutating. fact mutates. Every top scientist sun said virus mutate especially running unchecked. unlikely completely evade trained (whether naturally via vaccine) immune response short term.

If believe time next year we'll exactly place, similar amounts deaths, simply fearmongering. virus going magically poof disappear, we're going manage point become nothing small annoying, developed world. Even thread there's people saying ""masks mandated 2022 that's okay."" that's true, what's going happen 2022 that's going justify ending mask mandates? seems like people want caution sake caution living currently Northern California scares me. comes pandemic seems like there's nothing good news. old people know schedule vaccine themselves, younger people them. elderly people without support system, big concern they'll left behind. God real savior! /s apples-to-apples comparisons: Israel data includes lot vaccinated-to-vaccinated transmissions (or lack thereof) we'd expect transmissions much, much less common. 

The UK strain antibody escape we'd expect highest antibody titers best. E484K lineages concern here. limited data B.1.351, none B.1.1.28 P1. Chicago still beaches playgrounds closed, long past point knew outdoor activities extremely low risk. governments, like Chicago Illinois, going fart around forever drop empty safety theater restrictions, especially they’re things don’t impact tax revenue (like playgrounds beaches). see masks like that, too. Yes, yes locals. They’ve lived locale whole life. Families living locale decades. “point” literally makes sense. It’s usually ppl area generations hit hardest influxes wealthy inhabitants/gentrifiers. think give trump much credit calling ""incompetent mobster"". implies hes even somewhat capable organizing something. prefer buffoon like grifter. that's me. Yes covid still long way go contagious virus we've true thing organically evolved something akin SARS 1 MERS current form without even feeling evolutionary pressure vaccines see reason get worse. uk slowdown cases variant, vaccines go past holidays, yeah variant become dominant point little become sick, hospital capacity dramatically increase winter. Since Pfizer vaccine could effective 2 dangerous COVID-19 variants new variants arrived, good time monitor situation see well vaccines respond new variants real world. question could change course pandemic. Lol likely Se literally amazing job right now. Slow start better anyone except Israel Sweden fine. It’s almost like bull shit. happened people small percentage, and, crucially, exclusive Covid-19. known rare complication whole range viruses bacterial infections decades. Imagine would happen someone threw funding effective early treatment.. Maybe even repurposed drug thats already widely available? It'd crazy! 

They tried (and, Brazil, they're still trying) hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin ivermectin. failed. got offer vaccinated today, really fence it, want get prevent (29M asthma/epilepsy) catching horrible virus, worried potential unknown long term effects, anyone help I’d really grateful! OK let's slow up.


Him saying one scared covid saying extremely deadly need scared tow sides hyperbole coin.

Should groups worry covid? Fuck yes, ridiculous unless blind last year. covid also huge deal majority population? Also yes, numbers lie deadly long covid exist, experience people disease.


This extremely dangerous certain groups, need make sure ways groups survive go back normal.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  cannot wait day catch COVID treat bowl chicken soup, sleep, Netflix.  ok, gotcha, thanks clarifying.  UK already. UK far largest funder COVAX programme provide vaccines globally developing countries. Last time checked provided funding whole EU combined.  originally read title ""if world manages conquer covid Canadian PM Justin Trudeau"" nearly spat drink laughed No. don’t want masks “stay” want people wear actively coughing dripping snot. Lockdowns huge economic reprocususons create massive problems housing jobs. 

Masks hand, much lower cost, high reward policy. 

I understand desire immediately get rid them. We're making improvements well already. get rush masks. Formally? Sure.

In terms impact daily life Europe? Barring catastrophic developments variants vaccine delivery, effects wind course next nine months, beginning April-May. mean, yeah that's point... none locals Florida initially county. one main one state site counties opt not. way demand vaccine. seniors thing happened initially long. unaccounted all. federal government sending know twenty million doses went, sure want help administer renters pay property tax though... landowner does

the renter pays whatever landowner deems right price  Yep statistical studies show vaccines useful protections strains. already shared thread doesn’t matter well intentioned not. still effect did. first message people hear usually one pay attention to. message keeps changing, people lose confidence. mean, biggest vaccine manufacturing facilities India? kissing ass - truth. incredibly misinformed. vaccines made India AZ/Oxford vaccine, produced licences AZ/Oxford. UK exporting IP allowing others mass produce vaccines rather direct manufacturing exporting, substantial manufacturing base UK, recently even capacity produce vaccines population. UK also provided largest amount funding COVAX programme provide vaccines around world developing countries, developed country last time checked EU countries combined. I'm lot fan government would never vote Boris, I'm massively Brexit politically. give credit due, really make case UK world supporting global vaccination effort country moment. sure. asking question. sure it’s vaccines? Again, it’s 1,170 case, 11 case. Yeah.. I’m speech pathologist made job incredibly difficult. I’m getting referrals kids can’t say sounds otherwise think would could visualize teachers mouths :/ Latin America. thing? ""About 550 million people affected lack access adequate toilets 2014 but, since then, Swachh Bharat, program managed Indian government conjunction UNICEF, India reduced number people without access toilets 50 million""

Anyways  obviously correct sentiment states dropped statewide mandate usually still local/city-level governments mask rules. places true local leaders feel masks would unpopular, also people disregard mask mandates anyway really though it.

It's demographic dependent. Last Wednesday 10th February, went dinner family today one people dinner tested positive Covid-19. within 3 feet him. wore mask one else gathering did. outside well. started exhibiting symptoms yesterday got tested today. Even though wasn’t technically close contact time frame, would still wise quarantine get test? Yeah sucks sucks like flu sucks, people couple weeks discomfort, tell friends ""damn, got covid year felt like shit"" sure, might help read whole article maybe data driven journals.

As yet similarly studies done Switzerland, recall number deaths seemed scary well, found unlikely linked vaccine. Keeping mind largest portion vaccinted individuals already high risk categories older age. 

I would mildly apprehensive, trust information hand, best step forward vaccinate rush towards herd immunity. would still go vaccine available (Probably last category/group get country) 

Don't intend convince anyone. think rational based information currently have. Oops! That's evidence theory - facts make seem unlikely. However, epistemology, proof triumphs evidence, COVID-19 antibodies found blood Milanese Italians proof originate China. EU one exporting vaccines. cooperating? aside, Covid killed anything, hopefully it’s killed “open floor plan” office all. Open plans suuuuuck. Finally, someone actually gets it!

This pandemic may unavoidable, excess deaths not.

As currently stands 309 deaths per 1 Million people planet combined.

Were necessary deaths? Could avoided? That's saying look back, ""lol weird amirite?"" It’s magic. new virus, subject evolutionary benefits limitations viruses. hasn’t flu evolved reproductive number 10? advice used avoid physical exercise 24-48 hours getting vaccine, even feeling fine. I'm sure that's still current, mentioned last times got vaccinated. isn’t Melbourne. Everyone else Aus NZ least manage keep new lockdowns short. got name show called community. Since I’m brown took name fun. seriously that’s real name? Give chip Bill, need Totally, whichever country/organization is. Losing... NY Doomsday Times. I'm offering help, I'm telling truth want hear.

How resisting reality worked far? changed anything? 

Describe working you. So, provide facts sources backup statements, fearmongering?

This we're situation we're in. Americans underplayed since day one we're going pay coming years. Let's party like summer 2020! samples sequenced find 13 variants Wuhan area. 

The ones geographically diverse suspected Covid cases October November. Covid tests administered. able test 67 92 people antibodies found antibodies them. isn’t anything proving Covid geographically diverse within China December. think it’s possible antibodies don’t last long, it’s also possible suspected Covid cases weren’t actually Covid cases. Yeah, like ""coronavirus"" ""pandemic"" 13 months ago. need worry, press looking revenue, then. wish everyone mentality Palestinians getting vaccinated too? It’s great tbh. I’m still careful it’s nice need worry it. think Trudeau reopen US/Canada border anytime soon? Freedom costs millions lives every year. Three million Americans die average every year. People die obesity, tobacco usage, traveling, driving cars etc. cancer bad luck well poor choices. Heart disease huge killer men women. 

To fair, didn’t really cost half million sons daughters. vast majority people died age 75. 

Tbh, don’t approve US approach approach New Zealand. future, better way protect elderly without requiring young people sacrifice lives extent. evidence presently regarding effect vaccines transmission. study endpoints still ongoing. Thankfully resisted (based science showing schools higher risk job). teachers even stealing codes used book vaccine appointments taking themselves, healthcare workers/elderly.

It's frustrating they've finally ramped infrastructure widened access everything slow again. part money gave them? guinea pigs? paid troll, bot, someone hates human rights?    experience well. There's endless cycle emotion stepping works amazingly psyche. Despite public health admonitions--go outside! Talk people! comes point remember mental health important physical health.

Interesting. Yh it'll probably start shift AZ since IIRC UK AZ plant course doses ordered. Although interesting see split goes vaccines start arrive UK like Moderna, Novavax J&amp;J. yeah, currently willing admit to. Vaccines it, regardless don’t do. anyone wants keep restrictions vaccine, they’ll forever. There’s endgame beyond endemic virus. 20 million ~~unused~~ reserved second doses U.S. right now. Ew cringe tankie difference western nations could remove leaders take seriously democratic accountability. CCP accountability, ever shared got control Wuhan save face sweeping rug anymore. like putting poison straight brain. help. killing people posts? Ah kickass. can't wait relief knowing I'm safe it, even odds anything bad happening pretty low. last lockdown ended October Cause can't say ""America bad."" Jeeeeesus can't people get fucking comment.

You looking back pandemic thinking ""well half million deaths obviously unavoidable let's get learn anything all"" it, point companies decide everyone work home, removes need higher salary reduce pay. It’s Montana it’s like everyone close proximity really try sedentary are. take you’re able leave home go walks runs throughout neighborhood? South africa yhe middle summer restrictions good enough get across they're worried efficacy time efficacy. received notification appointment second dose Moderna Dodger Stadium right schedule appointment second jab 28 days first.  


Seems though actually held back second doses 👍 Sucks suck. going literally put them? think schools double building space available? Classrooms available use? Please show school able halve third classrooms up. Every school I’ve worked already uses every single available classroom even divider walls classrooms. It’s possible. Much developing world even started vaccinations yet. article says interest market aim seems especially tourist hotspots airports. 

Considering start see parts world opening bit year seem late. kind solutions could give private businesses cost effective way first test people quickly. Needing test wont go away years - likely ever COVID. mean try change focus America, regardless. countries exist thought Biden stooge China...

Or least that's Republicans would think. too. guys deserve COVID-free, actually care other, unlike depraved USA. years

When understanding economics sociology never every 7/11 toilet country either Must caught guard. Give weeks..they time fudge yet. Mission Accomplished US always led world large margin foreign aid

In absolute numbers sure. that's bizarre metric use. last community cases require lockdown thanks superb contact tracing system team (my father one contact tracer workers). hope cases detected early enough chain transmission minimised. ridiculously over-cautious. Daily cases lower since early October, vulnerable populations already vaccinated. kind thing makes glad live US.  could afford drive car insurance. government regulates car insurance wants drive. thing here. MIL incredibly dumb. words trust scientists themselves, papers/social media accounts. Journalists usually quote whatever want publish twisted opinions, without peer-review. awesome wedding gonna MFing rager, let tell keepit up! Maybe 1% Wow! Hopefully works. would awesome get shot would protected variants years.  lol Russian vaccine seems good others.

I trust Russian car (or Italian one matter), scientists always top notch. hope too! get better time things ""normally"" time bad days I'm laid really low lungs super weak still. Also complications autoimmune disorders I've really careful isolate. course, help lot mental health issues well Same. freedom work anywhere huge plus. even amongst current vaccines still remain around 60% effective SA variant

Exactly, that's 40% reduction less year. virus going stop evolving that's viruses do. think going happen another justifiably annoyed suddenly news meeting reporting almost variant it’s jaw dropping news it’s run mill science world better part year

The news media reporting variants already causing problems cause road. South Africa relying AZ vaccine, they're make significant adjustments rollout. B.1.1.7 likely cause another surge US becomes dominant strain like news never reporting car crashes fatalities one day particularly bad pile occurs suddenly every car accident reported like breaking news 

What we're experiencing right multiple bad pile-ups guarantee future.  Nah, lockdown till people vaccinated. guess good anyone else's here.

Also depends wildly live. kind hope remain option. many job opportunities major coastal cities cost living high areas. I’d love able work remotely permanently city much cheaper cost living. Obviously want covid gone ASAP constrained physical location jobs places live would really nice especially working couples.  going people celebrating this. Shame them. sure time frame state talking about. never said people following rules. Ugh, fucking Giantfart. I've already person yell store ""YOU DONT YO WEAR ANYMORE!"". see lot people die.  Dr. John Campbell reviewed paper well. Highly recommend Yeah. misery loves company. It’s abhorrent see people person normal human interactions. Public health guidance never advised outright, simply take precautions. feel comfortable seeing someone outside masks, means. people accommodating needs. 

I really feel man. hope shit ends sooner rather later get life back. might feel like won’t deserve it, promise you’ll get back swing sooner rather later. Look sensible comments! cares!  Masks worn sizable portion population vaccinated, say 60% 70% more. Covid complex pathology given many people long haul issues. think worth wear mask prevent that? may vaccinated, could still infect someone yet unvaccinated give issues. Lets get virus counts much possible prevent emergence variants, get life back normal. pandemic got bad nation took half measures. taking corner this, lets right. really closer think. predict late summer near return normality. Except time people returned normal numbers. month since release hospital....was supposedly knocking deaths door..
Two weeks able walk unassisted. Two weeks feeling much better last three days feel like left hospital....back shortness breath every sentence...cannot walk even toilet unaided grabbing onto things using wall stay upright.
Losing weight eating , headaches go away come back, forgetting thinking talking midsentance...pain collarbone breathing deeply..,....it socks hope last year. What's wrong that? Gianforte went alma mater everyone hates   Good point. South Australia never mandated mask wearing public, noticed quite lot people still wore them. risk went away (when like 1 2 active cases, hotel quarantine) practically everybody stopped wearing masks, etc.

But still fear consequence virus had. use qr code entering stores, government yet begin vaccinating anybody.

Once vaccinating people, lift restrictions others, serious problem. place lowest COVID incidents compared state wa super mask strict still learning regardless, trials ongoing results published time goes on.  Better area. got update county father lives in. 156,000 people signed awaiting vaccine getting 1200 doses week.

At current rate going take 2.5 years get people vaccinated list. that's whole population. know Montana, Iowa, North Dakota lifted mask orders. guess state like Florida already made fines associated wearing masks illegal back September lift mask orders soon vaccines become bit readily remember hearing interview landlord Texas right first wave rent forgiveness stopping, guy trying ""woe me"" fellow landlords. ""I want kick people onto streets, can't pay...""

I wonder current admin going take efforts help folks they'll left fend  lot people 10-20 years say long term side effects studied ruled out. Honestly, WFH highlight lockdown, trust me, I'm probably anyone sub. think hybrid system would ideal moving forward,3 days 2 out, bc agree human interaction coworkers important. missing point. N510Y mutation reason increased transmission 2x binding affinity ACE2 receptors (aka lungs uses viral reproduction process kills cells lungs via apoptosis) variants have. I'm California Kaiser, one biggest healthcare providers state even enough vaccines high risk elderly patients. something like 200,000 vaccines distributed last month million patients age 75. Meanwhile step dad appt Tuesday get vaccine CVS. CVS set disribution largest healthcare org California doesn't? 

Nothing makes sense. unclear mean ""noticeably symptomatic."" People [more five acute infection likely get long covid, says nothing illness severity. Many people mild initial infection (including myself) still symptoms nearly year hospitalized covid patients develop Long Covid, compared 10-20% people get covid. However, 5% people covid hospitalized, means 3.8% (5% * 76%) people covid develop long covid hospitalization. means remainder 10-20% people covid develop long covid (6.2%-16.2%) hospitalized, 1.6 4.3 times common hospitalized get long covid hospitalized get long covid. 

This even touch fact generally know what's still wrong people severe enough illness hospitalized. lungs, kidneys, hearts permanent damage measured medical tests. treatment regimens problems well-defined. Contrast medical mystery long covid relatively mild illness, frequently less debilitating seen hospitalization. understand it, can't treat it. 

Overall (both perspective numbers medical ignorance), disease burden long covid relatively mild illness greater hospitalization. (are) probably downvoted seem recognize fact over-confident something researched sufficiently experienced personally.  ahh, ok..no problem. yes, suck. live Windsor, early got long term care home vaccinated past weeks, hardly anything. friend nurse here, still gotten first shot. sister nurse Detroit second shot weeks already. makes feel better given 12-18 month timeline vaccine back March.

It took 9 months instead. UK, made incredible progress vaccinations, still seems dragging feet reopening. start allowing outdoor visits beginning March 8 thinking reopening nonessential retail Easter.

Thoughts? Ethics.

You’re right, I’m sure would people willing this, even running study presents huge ethical issue. don’t good way determining exactly die covid- great data ideas makes less likely, can’t 100% sure aren’t risking life intentionally giving covid, study would still highly unethical. Many people stressed needs WWII level situation terms mobilization response. point. indeed good example, IMO. comment, short, ""so fighting Hitler"", i.e., /u/Evan_Th said suspected hard problem, prompted response. surprising anyone?

 way vaccines rolling still months get people covered. We're turning corner sure, still going take time. Austin pretty locked - masks, distancing, etc. waiting out. would deaths without protective measures. IDK rest state. giving much credit. feel like there's difference people hypothetically reject vaccine asked, would take vaccine they're spotlight  region live UK variant cases province people charge responding easing lockdown restrictions. Try understand spite good foundation public health policy. Honestly, care wearing mask, even I'll probably keep collection around I'm sick. physical distancing gets me, though. want hug friends again. ""pro life"" party btw live meridian idaho story. Everywhere open busy, masks. covid rates everywhere else. personally wear mask, anecdotally doesnt seem make huge difference.  Oh please again. literally believes world 6000 years old retirement exist Noah 600 built ark. Obviously retirement exist he's special, also able choke slam reporter asks question like. I'm getting he's fucking embarrassment union shocked Gianfuckface come strong unions. thought better qult runs deep days. True, cross bridge get it. Let’s live rock rest lives fear “might” come.

Be safe vaccine isn’t widespread; reach point mass vaccinations, still COVID return normal life. point, impact incredibly small % population. True, last week found simple asthma medication prevent 90% hospitalizations.

That might go long way towards preventing worst cases.

Problem still stop pandemic. yes, vaccines way out. hopefull tge vaccines new treatments disease may look lot less dangerous soon also badass lakes good beer. understand point. hate watching majority us vote keeping way life. makes brain ache. hobbies those? rock climb mask 🤷🏻‍♀️ east coast it’s either desert flat, hot, farmland nothing do. Tripling stupid. gop way. richest 1% 1% got 30% richer last year. saying...

Also miss fear mongering qith variants saying vaccines less effective need new ones? want endless cycle. clear day wish could make thread Dr. Fauci, Biden administration, government official come say this. alas, nothing. People puzzled surprised “the virus burning out”. that’s exactly case.

This known while. actually hitting herd immunity threshold required normalcy return. How? TRUE number Covid-19 infections FAR higher known. CDC reports real amount infections anywhere 3.5x - 7x: there’s currently 28 million reported cases x 7 = 196 million people natural Coronavirus immunity US. that’s best possible scenario, let’s keep 4x per CDC link. 

That would mean 112 million people natural immunity. Add onto 37 million people first dose get 150 million people ~ Covid immunity. Meaning somewhere around approximately 50% population immunity Covid-19.

(Mind current freezing cold across America) Add onto gradual move towards warmer humid Spring/Summer weather respiratory viruses spread less, get perfect finale end all. Go figure! Summer 2021 amazing. things never seem change. And, course, Jews site, Chancellor Angela Merkel, Health Minister Jens Spahn, Minister Foreign Affairs Heiko Maas virologist Christian Drosten, Jewish. proof lockdowns work, especially virus like covid-19. (Highly virulent, extremely low rate death people 50 healthy.) honestly don’t understand difficult fucking concept. masks = cases = longer lockdown = less $$$. masks = less cases = hopefully less lockdown = reopen, $$$ necessarily (or even often) case increased contagious equals reduced lethality virus.

For Covid, tends kill sometime *after* virus cleared system, done spreading others. Indeed, increased transmission would naturally correlated higher viral load peak infection, may also expected lead higher lethality. lose-lose situation, sadly. lift it... lower it? estimation estimation overestimation underestimation, estimates. 

Wait, what?  think economic boom going start much earlier. worried, second get jab I’ll signed up!!  in. federal government closed borders montana outbreak over. right, didnt used see kind partisan lines came local elections... landslide republican victory billings local reps, previously much closer 50/50  Christ lmao Vaccine good. worry time worry. sure would. adults want vaccine able get one, COVID less severe flu children. unless want make wear masks rest life, seems silly point. though lot Asian mask wearing pollution also. saying all, believe contributes see Asians masks. Everyone assumes it’s solely disease. 


I found passage below. 


Japanese wear masks feeling sick courtesy stop sneezes landing people. Japanese women mask faces days don’t time put makeup. Philippine motorcycle riders wear masks deflect vehicular exhausts heavy traffic. Taiwan, citizens say masks keep faces warm winter offer sense protection air pollution, including airborne germs. odds significantly better that! people like stick know Honestly, mask. see big deal wear one till vaccination goals met. Rogan smartest dumb guy world.  Sounds right. 5/100 get 95% efficacy rate. 0/100 need hospitalization die. took like 2 months respond. Damn right im proud. bit topic, anyone know gal planning wedding based many doses per 100 certain time periods?

She really doubting we’d get 20 per 100 month last heard. 2 mil + per day rising, think might actually clear next couple weeks. think every time see numbers written way. There’s 99.99% chance people made flyers also don’t wear masks. Yeah endorsing Ethan saying necessarily Joe Rogan Elon Musk spreading moronic bullshit vaccines. care anymore. Pfizer going make commitments Moderna bit bigger question mark.  depends successful scaling Lonza facilities finding supply chains components quickly.  They’ve currently kept telling Canada will

Plenty idiots celebrating like cases somehow testament failure system. rates vaccination speeding staying people already it, trend don’t see reversing. Especially weather starts get nice southern areas people outdoors. accuse EU vaccine nationalism 

I accused EU anything. exporting USA 

As far know, O:-) America two vaccines available right now: one made based New York; based Massachusetts. others expected soon, [Johnson &amp; New Jersey, Maryland. (plus AstraZeneca based UK, one approved yet U.S. authorities)

Not sure seem chip shoulder w.r.t. U.S. case, we're ""taking food Europe's plate"" terms COVID vaccines JFC...  Yea, probably already COVID beforehand due work and/or level risk.

Not even that. Give million people, chosen random, glass water dozen die following day. Simply live ever. Yes 2 week quarantine rule american tourists. Canadian Ugandan Samoan goes Asian country, need 2 week quarantine also.

Would also say ""no one wants Canadians/Egyptians/Tongans country due terrible covid response"".

Im questioning inferiority complex Americans uniquely unwanted due covid response. true.  liked speech better original German. colds actually coronaviruses. are. Way lose progress. agree everything said except idea everyone voluntarily leaves house. That's true. everyone works home, go work, starve.

You've spot everything else, that's base. convinced imbecile. Two week quarantine... Might well ban 99.9% Americans.  TIL stupid racist americans understand asians actually live country. Yeah, *in*civil. good work bot. learn deaths lag infections.  Yeah, hate say suck shit  stay safe bud. surrounded evil idiots. Wham! That’s way it: 3 community cases Action! discussing around opinions protest shit. fuckin get it! numbers see way dude. 224 million Americans already virus? Lol ok definitely we've started masking diligently following lockdown rules, know restrictions destroy livelihoods work. Imagine thinking winter weather hinders spress respiratory viruses... So, either: 

* No-one dies, third country stays home days, rest wear masks hold concerts time, or

* whole pile people die, restrictions implemented anyway even healthy young people, quarter country stays home indefinitely?

Sounds sensible. borrow tin foil? people 80 offered vaccines right now? heard anything Hire someone write comments on.  Maybe I'm misreading comment trying give trunp credit vaccine rollout? thats tone deaf point. often u even see Asian family portrayed American media??? coincidentally want use Asian family like family even part story headline... Amazing answer there. people obstinate reality? Probably cuz Chinese new year Last year Europe summer virus practically non-existent. vacationing without limits. reason now, especially knowing good part population vaccinated, different? Lol nope noticed too!

I celebrating good news, suddenly comments suggesting caution seriously downvoted. Like, agree good news, also mention we’re woods yet still need keep masking distancing *for now* (not forever, mind you, get enough people vaccinated!), get downvoted oblivion. heaven forbid mention double-masking. It’s weird shift makes suspicious. gotta use Asian family cover... guess people thought wasn’t real made herd immunity population. rest us continue mask up, distance, get vaccine. believe said happen unless extends past 72 hours - apparently that's happened last time.

Bear mind NZ can't really fire workers like that. tried share link moderator told cuz source Twitter reliable, understand policy case unreasonable, whatelse could reliable source himself? Winter, quarantine fatigue, Thanksgiving, Christmas, new years, mean surprising cases spiked. It’s short lockdown stop spread investigate cases came provide time people go get tested. They’re locking whole country. 30% drop revenue 30-day period, relative previous year. can't breathe mask vote even walk fight stairs? Interesting! stories reinfections severe first one. IV Vit C infusions hospitals. Yay guess? everliving fuck everyone start September. Lots 3 degrees separation grandmas grandpas killed off.

0.15% population dead COVID-19. Issue: lots sick ppl refusing get doctor testing. Why? don’t want quarantine still, time, thinks it’s fine that. Outs raw numbers rate change encouraging. Beats Hell me. bizzare I've listened uneducated mouth-breathers say COVID-19 is:

1.) Completely fabricated 

2.) distraction installed foreign powers order meddle election 

3.) totally mild disease level modern influenza virus ***and*** 

4.) Caused electronic signals

I know upset actual facts back claims, careful get banned balance reduced r-rate vaccinations. reducing lockdown faster vaccines take effect r-rate increase 1.0 Since total numbers still high would overwhelm NHS stats even proved lockdown need increased again. 

Covid19 responds instantly opening give it. UK government waits stats infections &amp; hospital admissions. occur days/weeks initial infection. seems thread thought prior covid world risk free. adequately vaccinated simply “same amount risk, includes covid”. It’s gonna big deal. Calm down, you. Big Spike due Thanksgiving / Christmas / New Year's mingling fluids events.

I'm weird pointless vaccination.

IDK never sure loathed it. One families I'd ever met absolutely loved living Ohio, claimed much better Oklahoma. Ohio sucked donkey balls, figure OK must've terrible. USA get BioNtech vaccines German taxpayer funded factory mit enough EU nursing home residents? problem USA taking care first, long others allowed same.

We know going on, USA holding gun companies governments heads. people wonder many think USA reliable partner anymore. annoyance, would want spread annoyance others. Especially people it’s bit annoyance. Oh lol weird vaccines. Okay weird. dudes initial wealth software engineer/businessperson(or thought), think he'd man science guess lifting masks basically guarantees reelection states.   likely theory moment one positive case's works airline laundry possible contamination there. nothing proven yet. people still eligible vaccines long term care workers residents, healthcare workers people recipients chronic home healthcare.

Just accuse EU vaccine nationalism want little bit USA doing. exporting USA even vaccinated nursing home residents yet. Naw, it’s black white dawg **All** knowledgeable people **knew** bad idea. Paying companies fund setup production lines agreement first doses come UK isnt vaccine nationalism good business practice.

Putting restrictions vaccine exports like EU vaccine nationalism.

Very little said factual correct. can't analyse data exist. takes time variants spread enough people catch die statistical analysis.

If bothered click link would also know building earlier reports already suggested higher mortality. statistical weight people died. Hoarding vaccines yet produced still hoarding them.

Popularities change. may popular, people realize mistake made. also initial thought, choose react serious manner. really place jokes opinion. mess up, they're making dumb joke Especially large percentage million people old and/or unhealthy. say ""couple months"".

Irrelevant. point know much immunity vastly. measured, least countries.

Yes measured, extensively. numbers also indicate closer herd immunity might think, alot people antibodies compared confirmed cases. varies region region telling people Bergamo. forget people die end debilitating long-term symptoms.

I'm sorry people get ill, data there. virus generally harmful people. exceptions obviously, rare. Long term symptoms, much known that. Let's focus know. common people long term symptoms all, know occur yet feel free educate appear testing antibodies probably expensive vaccination. Secondly, behaviour naturally-acquired antibodies seems, like much else COVID, variable. minority infected people level antibodies declines rapidly. Research far suggests vaccination-induced antibody levels consistent.

I really doubt is. reason assume that? case, be. might depend country. lot USA regarding healthcare make sense all, surprised. Also say vaccination-induced antibodies likely true. also dont lot data vaccination people already antibodies, data suggests need one shot, excluding possiblity one shot might even pointless. study [suggests natural immunity might even effective vaccination-induced reason think otherwise. Natural antibodies seem work new strains, vaccines Pfizer Moderna. yet read study concludes loss antibodies given amount time. lot still ongoing.

Also EU that's put controls vaccine exports whereas UK hasn't. Plus add insult injury EU went straight big red button triggering article 16 less month agreement came effect.

so without really knowing long natural immunity lasts, many people infested... hesitant throw numbers like around

Oh yeah. Despite happening, US government intel new viral pneumonia Wuhan November 2019. intelligence community tried get message multiple occasions. vast majority people immune. also antibodies aren’t end immunity. pandemic denier antimaskers"" seems like overblown talking point me.

The primary thing ""haha America response bad"" American media floods Reddit American site.

&amp;#x200B;

The non-Americans like go ""haha America bad"" 1) response bad, 2) deflect country's failings. notice one shows lot thread something negative another country's response. There'll always ""well least america XD"" Ready turn capitalism yet? Cheap houses often places little /low paying job prospects FAR away jobs are. Alert Level 3 light type lockdown applies Auckland city. Level 2 rest country lockdown. social distancing, masks public transport, gathering number restrictions.

Vaccination started NZ yet. first vaccines arrive next week enough vaccinate border workers.

The 3 cases travelled Auckland New Plymouth, know many people inadvertedly infected time, far people travelled around country, people also met infected. strategy last minor community outbreak. changes assess situation draw ring around infection spread. determined rest country moves alert levels back normal life Alert Level 1 quite quickly. social shaming. Honestly, look it, realize ""I apprehensive side effects want going months get vaccine anyways""

The one small benefit first. random Asian family cover photo? US Asians lowest infection numbers, deaths, second smallest minority group. got Chris Cuomo virus prophet say today?

Other trump I’ve never seen someone contradict often still word treated like gospel. incredibly foolish ignorant thing say. living totally normal lives nearly 5 months now. wear masks, economy fully open. would ever abandon system allowed go US UK approach??? 

Also vaccines NZ yet, whole population vulnerable. clearly know nothing NZ response. [Level 2 isn’t nobody vaccinated. wonder travel bubble countries vaccinating well, US, UK, Israel, could make travel bubble come summer even earlier allow travel countries. People already COVID seem natural immunity new South African variant. Maryland proposing thing!

The alcohol lobby huge (it's one reasons legal weed yet). could see passing. certainly hope does.  Schools masked, guess. rights ...... What? Level 2 country fuck all.Just greater social distancing lower crowds. like masks? think they're kinda cool. Im Dr would assume types corona virus around quite time act similar way.

My answer don't, can't assume works, therefore used proven methods.  won’t normalized US. willing wear temporarily, cannot wait burn throw away. Who'da knew something would better nothing around 25,000 actually. thinking surge deaths (because targeted vaccinations) heard Dr. Osterholm's new warning. still find hard believe COVID deaths ever going spike we'll see. thing bothered whole pandemic could shut matter weeks large majority us actually wanted real lockdown. Oh well. Except maybe massive explosion cases happened starting couple months ago... there’s way fuck (again) - Americans find it. That's true all. hate lockdowns since people flaunting restrictions privately one balls close air travel we're getting long drawn shit going whole year now.

Now damn mutations.  Millions people given fuck ton past year. lame statement. Please go back watching Netflix something. “medical officer” terrorist tried crimes humanity immediately. We’re wise satanist freaks You’re going shut entire country 3 cases? Wouldn’t make sense advise 60 older stay home younger people vaccinated still live lives? Like isn’t logical choice point? Wouldn’t incredible? Future generations may never go inconvenience catching cold every year. honestly believe little vaccine nearly everything holidays over. Could believe amount people proceeded Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year normal. comment downvoted implies people Asian origin can’t considered Americans. ironic considering you’re one accusing people racism. claimed immunity summer different.

but yet provide facts back claim

instead, trying get prove claim wrong. work way. make claim, provide evidence back claim. spewing hot air. Fur mostly farm minks for?  Oh dude, totally people still believe virus exist whatsoever entirely fabricated specifically make #45 look bad. Strict lock downs worked New Zealand Australia...

Taiwan Vietnam also beat virus without vaccine Bro people wearing masks past 6 months. attributing covid cases small, likely rural % people didn’t wear them. textbook straw man argument. 

Additionally use vague phrases like “take pandemic seriously” without offering real elaboration beyond mask wearing. leads believe don’t actually ideas curtail “pandemic” prefer fear mongering inducement historical event Haha, America get hundreds thousands cases per day fully reopening 😂😂😂 think they're trying better you, want feel bad.

It's okay give credit government still acknowledging they're overall quite shit. Lawmakers Wal-Mart check ain't gonna clear small businesses dead. US likely load mutations well. They’re looking way U.K. is. sure things handled UK, suppose government hand securing supply vaccines. Credit NHS course, seen rest world, success UK compared others lies mostly good setting effective production infrastructure. point strong.

It genuine question, rhetorical one, fwiw. intended make point along lines ""I see trust now, please share"" rather ""_you_ trust _I_ see reason strong vested interest vaccine succeeding

I agree interest, follow would might lead lie dissemble efficacy safety vaccines. people take ineffective unsafe vaccines, help achieve interest vaccine succeeding. see it.

Or mean might biased consequently inadvertently painting better picture reality due wishful thinking etc, rather deliberately lying? guess see someone might concerned given conflicting advice many things

That's certainly fair point. said lot overlooked one, easily see would cause people misgivings. best response far, love it!

They strong vested interest vaccine succeeding given conflicting advice many things 

Now, signed get vaccine soon turn comes, trust doctors, two reasons right really good ones point strong. Yes, do. finance films! points true, still business case justifies something contract manufacturing. 

The fact *might* learn something unlikely enough own; lower prices means can't charge much manufacturing Pfizer, could cutting guaranteed revenue stream launch competing inferior product.

I'm really arguing continued development, want know rationale — benefit us them. sure downvoted raise good point. Highly unlikely stop spread known yet Yeah, well value property. Worked ass it. willing hand someone wants it, well thats fight. dont even start ""call police bro."" ETA police force measured minutes live urban environment. Tens minutes live rural area. ETA .223 Rem split second common range. 

The whole funny issue ""assault rifle"" term propaganda made core. Originates back in´44 first gun class called Sturmgewehr orders one wll known guy moustache. sounded cool designed psychological impact common infatryman. could losing war handed STURM rifles, right? NATO took over, well, right core sounds cool badass. fact really term without practical implications, pretty much defend home said ""assault"" rifle hand assault someone kitchen knife. TL:DR using term assault rifle argument playing fiddle old unlce Adolph.

Also make mind, AR-15 mighty efficient killing human, would equally efficient killing soft game like deer rabbits.

Zero practical applications except for... fun shooting one range? 

Im hero never claimed one. keep living simple quiet life harming anyone would appreciate others come demand conform views. SImple risk. watch Kurosawa’s *Ikiru* would average person need AR-15?

I would personally prefer functioning government looked allowed weapons overkill comes protecting hunting. know already happens yellow fever right???? wish countries this.

Yeah particularly care what's going Germany wherever, care state can't go back normal there.

Get USA vaccinated, stop international travel places variants, help others get vaccinated we're moving normality. I'm waiting Pakistan vaccinated. So.. going help make last longer ding dong? probably dont wear condoms either fuck it, HIV pills now. Moron. dont see place enough people vaccinated anyway mean, imagine locked doors 60 even 90 days April, summer young wild free. wear fucking mask right, hard. trust now, honestly think way former white house regime handled whole situation beginning confusing lackluster. really hope forbid another pandemic lifetime government/presidency allows trusted doctors scientists head information. want make political former administration US handled poorly mislead sometimes false information hard know believe trust. answer question, yes, believe Dr. Fauci trusted proven source unbiased trustworthy. Like said wanted take time research ask questions etc. people like help understand informed make easier make decision quicker. Thanks taking time reply informative.  do. vaccines effective vaccines right though HIV issues actually infects immune system. alerting system still immune cells attack virus simply enters infects. Holiday travel season, least. Curious see happens folks start wanting take spring summer vacations. know folks already talking going vacation soon want I’m dodging making commitments yet... 1: might learn something applied later project.

2: suppliers means lower prices better availabillity Flight crews aren’t routinely tested. blew mind. think nearly vaccine though.

He's piece shit computer science department graduated named fuckwit. 

Damn, thought gotten this, years I've immigrated Canada married woman dreams (relevant I'm gay he's anti-gay bigot) nope, Fuck Gianforte I'm always going feel like this. US even member. ignore it. say matter. Nah dude, it’s uncomfortable it. Sure won’t sneeze peoples faces, won’t wearing mask forever. Again, you’d like. I’m super liberal isn’t always case. West Virginia, Alaska, dakotas top 5 states vaccinated Yeah, anticipated mask years, too. sure trying argue. suggesting without closures mandates social measures cases higher? that's trying suggest please show study basing on? pretty much studies I've seen say opposite I'd like understand point view better.  Lol, annoying means you’re happy spread flu around shop? Weird way broadcast ignorance boo. mean kind agree, ""once general population starts getting jabs"" arbitrary date. take months entire willing population actually get vaccinated. look cases/hospitalizations/deaths decide they're low enough. Depends live. Midwest even inflated prices homes. Mortgage payments even PMI, Insurance, taxes baked STILL cheaper renting. It’s annoying, it’s fun wearing them. people welcome continue second it’s required government I’m dropping it. please. basically worthless, right?

Yes know mRNA vaccines hard produce. nothing equal distribution called allies. Dude misdemeanor he’s governor state? literally qualified candidates? voters Montana stupid? Ok good, tired wear one every time walk business. Here’s summer/fall. US’s annual deaths could prevented people literally putting less food mouths time.

That's true, unlike Covid they're getting **other people**. conditions mentions contagious. really don’t get getting downvoted much. Cases skyrocketing, new contagious mutation Covid spreading like fire, states relaxing restrictions. Sure man, you, that’s good way get inaccurate picture what’s going on. Cannot speak restaurants Walt Disney World open 35% capacity even FL government green lit full capacity. also laid 18000 cast members. it’s pretty bad. Peter Daszak Twitter refuted NYT report know there's video - speech Feb.2015 Bible College- here's article. covid one regular id card. live America size covid exception picture. people simply love lockdowns much let go admit go back life 2019 second everyone US chance get vaccinated. 😮 Fucking Moron. murdered people. I'm sorry going this, least government handling virus relatively well. Definitely better provinces/states countries. hopefully outbreak last long. variant spreading Ontario weeks know spreading [government give They're [reopening signed law would protect businesses lawsuits customers employees related contracting virus.

I like, ugh, why? Handed court? US doctor fills large stack cards CDC logo beginning day, filling today’s date. get handed patient, it’s write name. 

I’m bringing mine second appointment, im even sure update get dose 2. mean fill date myself...

The cards forged simple copy machine hear already market fakes Ahh yes fear mongering painting tech big bad monolith. Nope Florida Anglo-saxons practicing Eugenics disable people. That's still necessary ""only"" 50 million vaccines administered U.S. number rises, normalcy return. pandemic still going on. one denying that. vaccines offer way out. 

People still encouraged adhere normal COVID guidelines even they've vaccinated 1) vaccines 100% effective- they're close perfect, 2) encouraging anyone stop adhering COVID guidelines would lead many nonvaccinated people shirking well, 3) still sure possibility asymptomatic transmission vaccinated patients. exactly likely IIRC possible occur patients.

u/poop-dolla Good one bro.

Thanks, ""bro."" Uk Portugal number new cases dropped lockdown started  thought. took psychopharm college went details approval process drugs vaccines. think I'd remember offhand. guess kind since mindset pretty much ""at point, I'm much vulnerable get pre-existings"" back mind knew fully tested trials process already rushed much safely possible due emergency world. Take author article.  Good. Vaccinate everyone within reach. didn’t stop us constantly blaming last guy so. remember suggesting would unconstitutional months ago got downvoted oblivion supporting bad orange guy. bet feels similarly Facui Trump, hopeless, especially views compared state he's in. America honestly wrong right look ridiculous wearing mask. many people wear mask change mask least every two days? Three days? Four days? AIDS, 60 yo morbidly obese take precautions. started taking precautions earlier, probably. us normal folk...don’t tell do. Ok that's ventilation system, window, which, sure, better nothing way maintain current protocols keep down

With logic we’ll locked 2030. usually test medication children we’ve verified safety adults we’ve always children clinical trials. would ethically fraught roll new medication general pediatric population otherwise. universal COVID vaccine, pancoronavirus vaccine. Vaccinate SARS-CoV-1, MERS, SARS-CoV-2, cold causing coronaviruses, potentially zoonotic animal coronaviruses, one go.

I admit big brother, travel anyways big brother anyways. I'm hopeful that, weeks, 1400 reasons get Surface Pro number South Africa evolving favorably actually? Even worse consider instead preventing us hoarding vaccine banning export. importing vaccine. mean, theres many infect.. study looked mostly healthcare workers (91%). likely higher exposure virus compared regular people  I'm sure everyone keeps looping back COVID - memory extending longer year, know easily illnesses spread close contact environments.

And there's middle ground 2 days unlimited. people need use maybe 3 times per year fully recover well within week. Even 3 weeks (w/o medical proof) would mean vast majority forced choose money coming sick. fuck everyone abuse it. Germany state minister today told news restaurants, operas, theaters hotels open Easter. would unwise so, even though case numbers going every week would put danger achieved far. means spent six months locked then. wonder we'll match Argentina. think international part foreseeable future. I’d expect large parts population example EU needs vaccinated first freely allow again. also fears 2 tier society developing, mainly others privileges others don’t purely based age/health factors.

If guess, based epidemiological point view allow travels. Vaccinated people however probably skip quarentine periods, CDC US currently advocating for. 

Poorer countries probably want everyone vaccinated too. 

I agree though vaccine passports future, especially skipping quarantine virus still spreading.

Above THOUGHTS. Story New zealand? Better shit America! workers considered ""critical"" keeping society functioning grocery store employees.

I understand reasoning necessarily agree it. seems unlikely could see major social impact due mass absence work infrastructure sector - seen far, also consider risks benefits public employees protected. ultimately, could happen infrastructure, could impact food chain - grocery store employees critical workers food mind still know sure whether vaccines reduce transmission.

We clear data, bet vaccines *don't* reduce transmission would long shot. know higher viral load longer duration symptoms positively correlated severity symptoms transmission, know vaccines reduce severity likelihood infection. still behave vaccines reduce transmission helps us minimise whatever remains, that's decision take individual, rather societal level. maddening thing happens side street, side fine, underground power lines don't. None ever makes sense. Oxford used Meningitis vaccine placebo group avoid people deducing vaccine got. people comparing EU, several different countries, different budget, different culture languages. 

Yet Japan, single country Country want hold olympics 4 MONTHS got vaccine approved. Ridiculous. going say, even something U.S looking specifically? UK they’ve specifically looking variants via genome sequencing quite time, likely reason we’ve tracking variants. Biden admin already said don’t want domestically. Internationally need one, regardless hardly travel anywhere without valid reason. Tanks street probably Biden saving world!!! woulda thunk picture Asians?! association got stop european may rest easy...

Also, access assault rifles. Well, technically yes, thats shall issue common semi auto sport rifle may issue police exactly eager hand permits. realistically no. 

Unballanced individuals wishing proper tool defend property. Yes. travesty. Itching reason? No. firearm comes great responsibility am, example, eager come conflict escalate one already happening. need arises? Yeah. use firearm defend property. Recieved second dose Moderna Friday afternoon, Sunday morning I've side effects, sore arm. Strangely, swollen lymph nodes first shot time. Anyone similar experience? That's Japanese ""efficiency"" you, say confidence I've worked hundred Japanese companies last 10 years. $4/gallon gas coming. Probably going put damper surge advantage give life? average valentines day find hilarious cool vid news like super positive lately like Biden magically something that.

I like Trump, Reddit insanely bias concerning.

Edit: Covid news. you’re saying makes sense, poor understanding virus still.

A small change like new strain could change this. Here's science cdc....  trump gone c19 slowing down, cover now? anyone think media?  Also number 1 Coronavirus deaths. it’s coincidence explosion rapid decline mirrored almost entire world (who didn’t variant time)? probably need vaccines 2022 well.

The Pfizer CEO said probably need annual COVID shots: then, would farmaceutical companies **not** want pursue this? Except Alabama, EMS personnel can't even get 1st dose. Trolling conspiracy theory crowds like boss! interactions people like really highlights need common sense gun laws brings great deal happiness knowing here. realise even without prolonged exposure American propaganda, NRA lobbyists, etc. unbalanced individuals like country, knowing they're unlikely access firearms (let alone assault rifle) brings lot peace.

The way try glorify kinda seems like itching reason shot someone genuinely hope seek necessary help.

RIP \~41k NA lives p/a Seems much coincidence cases consistently dropped since trump rallies/gatherings. Everything started back 3 weeks Jan 6th. could winter markets like Europe. Mulled wine all. really surprised conservatives like guy? Republican voters pretty goddamn stupid selfish, makes sense idea ""we almost cases late May"" frankly delusional. right US alone list saying people got drunk enough get kicked much consolation standing outside pub without drink. Ireland banned Americans there's uproar that. There's (unjustified pervasive) view American tourists plague bringers. find country bans Americans due covid concerns places like Brazil exist.

The EU list countries they're currently restricting travel from. funny mention Canada, since Canada list since removed due increases cases far I'm aware US never list.  I’m assuming continue see decrease cases coupled ramping vaccinations that’ll good thing us, right? open source doesn’t seem like government willing accept even case,

*At moment*. accepting low case numbers protection moment. Things change vaccines distributed, whole point getting vaccines. COVID mutation mutates slower flu. universal HIV Vaccine nigh impossible due lightspeed fast mutation.  media says vaccines useless scared varients assume applied Swedish model cov-19 infirm. Euthanasia diagnosis. deaths generate lot social media.  They'll obviously release data (ie soon), get us? ""data"", clarify. Fwiw I'm concerned variants anyone, anyone prone reinfection surely likely see critical case many hear about, due catching second time.

Not saying cause watching, concern etc - far early alarmed yet. guy again. Bit obsessed. listen facts. worth effort. course comments likes bad news. Let remove restrictions US, feel like people let guard shit hit fan again. Thank you. thought process become strangely widespread. I've seen expressed number times Reddit, became rage last summer NYT CNN like talking US passports devalued Americans becoming pariahs.

Sorry, world fixated Americans; countries travel restrictions tend apply broadly. fact, due limited restrictions upon return, Americans often able travel abroad freely countries significantly better. March 11th think was. remember shocked going play ncaa tournament without fans thought overreaction. evening NBA season suspended news broke Tom Hanks. reason really hit me. possible viable correct headline.

Better straight yes.  China must would show world hiding massive screw up. "" would like seen Montana."" ""these restrictions need lifted arbitrary date given! cares actually happening? That's irrelevant feelings matter!"" Infrastructure workers considered ""critical"" keeping society functioning grocery store employees.

Keep mind still know sure whether vaccines reduce transmission. Probably long year hospitals workers overwhelmed planet. think sort nefarious plot here?LOL minority major urban dwellers wear asia high somg days. stop spreading racist stereotypes Yes, UK heavily criticised French government “taking risks people’s lives”. Laughable really. didn’t....so I’m certain argument is. normal, racist stereotype like this

edecuate making blanket comments people largest continent earth Government wants business usual tax dollars keep rolling in. dead last thing want shutdowns unemployed angry men roaming streets. That's governments fall. people claiming government control hilariously stupid. mean, award winning levels stupid. would risk, would risk *from COVID-19*, cost avoid adding risk top existing risks would've fairly low. past. we'd done it.  risk free, chance prevent addition risk, squandered it. ailments even close covid level transmissibility

Instead pretended would simply disappear nothing. literally made hit economy worse wearing masks. Less effective still effective. interpretation. I’m going argue objective fact. 2023. Az work SA one, jnj said 50% vs uk variant. Pfzer said lower efficiency vs uk variant 
 Leave rock thinking moving Montana point future, y’all’s state govt always stupid? Disinformation soup! downvoted pointing absurd biologically implausible someone symptoms developed symptoms worse initial infection testing negative.

This describes minority Long Covid cases. majority mild illness acute phase either never resolved, resolved subsequently got worse. Several viral infections different phases, second worse (see Shingles EBV), unclear ""implausible"" claim coming being, extrapolated bunch data numbers highly variable, even things like number hospital admissions.

I felt like fairly obvious back-of-the-napkin estimate available figures well-known studies sources. 10% Long Covid figure NHS. Clearly hospitalization rate varies, generally around 5%. someone decided argue that, asked examples biological mechanisms event unable provide any.

The current model (in opinion molecular biologist) best chance true covid simultaneously triggers NAD+ depletion SIRT1 inhibition. may may present symptoms initially, long term, causes body siphon tryptophan replenish NAD+. However, several studies shown virions remain body months initial infection, process may continue indefinitely. Depleted tryptophan results low levels serum serotonin, causes mast cell activation condition resembling MCAS. However, body may remain symptom-free state trigger (often exercise) pushes everything past tipping point. See [this [this don’t hard numbers, truth data indicates long covid rare

I'm going waste time someone dismisses evidence order uphold preferred narrative. Lancet study nearly 1000 hospitalized covid patients (cited above) found 76% least one symptom 6 months. Body Politic studies (with hundreds participants) found definite temporal pattern symptoms people Long Covid, suggesting common underlying specific pathology. Neither points rare condition. anecdotally, know 10 people got covid. 3 ended hospital. one symptoms lasting 4 weeks, well, except one died. 

Oh cool, tiny non-random sample comprised entirely friends acquaintances Long covid skeptic. people would definitely share experience chronic illness it, I'm going take anecdote face also found quite telling article OP’s post lends significant credence idea symptoms purely psychological (even describing people things like anxiety depression likely result fragile mental state made worse circumstances infection) something else people get viscously downvoted sub for.

My anxiety depression getting better long covid symptoms getting worse, even able taper antidepressants around time discovered MCAS vitamin supplement stack, essentially cured many others' Long covid symptoms. psychosomatic explanation among weakest medical field usually betrays unwillingness admit one's ignorance and/or lack imagination explanatory paradigms. given amount upvotes original comment id say I’m currently downvoted

I’m working town staying large RV park, would say 90% people full-time whether choice not. Definitely lot snow birds didn’t head south year. take don’t live Vic True. I’m Pfizer trial, unblinded learned received vaccine. still want come six month follow up, presumably want continue monitoring level antibodies people received vaccine. Also still filling weekly survey asks I’ve experienced symptoms. 

We can’t make time move faster rest assured trial coordinators gathering data. Dudes r/SeattleWA troll, folks want fReeDUmB Inslee’s shutdowns don’t allow that. saying Inslee’s approach perfect, first U.S. state outbreak also one lowest basically every metric success regardless feel “heavy handed” approach  Hooray congrats Montana! plan overcome covid tons people die inspiration.

She made much money little trailer able take winters off. beach town Texas. it’s okay legitimately question Biden president? don’t care personally wouldn’t mind became acceptable wear one you’re feeling bit ill public. 

Does make wonder countries greater prevalence wearing masks public feeling sick lower rates flu... average, countries represented 750x fewer covid deaths per focus influencing improve. happen country member.

Which Taiwan left travesty.  gets point say more. Wear mask live life. haven’t answered number already contact list 10 years. Yes public policy perspective may better put faith odds. 

From empirical research perspective, it’s still good actually test things out. That’s basis entire method all: make claim, test out, let others critique tested replicate it, determine hypothesis bolstered not. think people care admit boat. Hardly fair lump rural communities like that. definition reasonable care flux. reasonable 2019 considered grossly negligent. new standards, consider unrealistic, leave businesses much vulnerable threat legal action. remain favour liability protection. Small businesses already suffered enough. I'd unpopular, office. High five politeness accurate answer!  incivility 🛡 New Zealand Taiwan really never let spread. South Korea increase December close lock back down, parts Australia lockdowns right now. countries also still mask mandate. way get back complete normalcy, unless one countries eradicate small scale vaccine. One fridge? see California taking longer back normal, Florida? already pretty close normal cases going rapidly, like rest country.   certainly hope so, interactions anti-vaxxers, exactly change minds evidence.

Having requirements school admission, jobs etc shown change behavior through, well economic incentives. 90-year-old choice too. sure don’t plan wearing one I’m 90. Yeah... seems like terrible idea. I’m suuuure everyone waits drink get destination. thing seem like governments care enough research this. care severe disease. Masks really prevent major spread. They're least invasive measure there. makes sense last thing go. flu incubation period too, though it’s long Covid’s. getting people vaccinated help. despite people subreddit want believe, virus still poses significant risk age groups can't safely reopen everything whole population vaccinated. otherwise we're needlessly putting lives risk. It’s never going end rate. WTF? “free” part means they’re part England anymore. got twisted bunch meanings afterwards. lot people waiting see, long-term side effects 10-20 years issue, since short-term effects already killed them, caused severe long-term side effects (long Covid syndrome).  confirm. lived Japan year mask wearing uncommon. Look Dr. Osterholm's latest appearance Meet Press. He's afraid UK variant cause case spike US end March. says people 65 older fully vaccinated (consider takes month first shot reach peak level protection). thinking numbers looking pretty good heard talk it. ever considered diesel heater? 100 dollars amazon fairly easy install, safer propane, cheaper propane, heats better need worried deadly gas, uses amount energy cell phone charging going.

Just thought though link one use interested Maybe guy wrote lose job. Mao please come back That’s...what happened dip shit. Living van river sounds pretty decent. don’t allow read expressions, exchange smiles, make random fleeting connections enrich lives. They’re also physically uncomfortable us. I’m prone headaches general, every time wear mask get slight headache. people get skin rashes them. Rich countries invested large amounts money COVAX largely funded research led vaccine created start with. sure could outside taking vaccines citizenry giving foreign nations.  current plan lmao, done research making details fit narrative want believe?   mean already mask rule Ontario obviously wasn’t enough cases still spiked dangerously high Nice faith America anymore ""Americans pandemic denier antimaskers"" seems like overblown talking point me. IHME projected US 75% mask-wearing rate couple months now. higher projection entire East Asia/Pacific region Europe, including Germany UK I’m totally opposed requiring vaccine certificates regular stuff traveling within country; one entitled right enter foreign sovereign nation (except maybe refugees/asylum seekers per international law), absolutely right require foreigners get shot entering. No. 

We care trying keep life good us. People allowed make decision comes risk tolerance. Oh no! stay home 5 days return basically complete freedom outside period?!?! 

Devastating, may well let virus run free, weekend plans important grandmas life anyway think Louisiana one first states allow mixed drinks order drive-thrus. considered open container straw punctured cup's lid. Exactly. first novel virus lifetime mean experience do. Every virus one point novel. tame compared first time anyone got measles, influenza, etc. We'll absorb risk point move on. want shots get them, take risk on. I'll certainly get vaccine yearly like flu, summer anyone wants vaccinated, we'll done large-scale restrictions. want keep masking staying home welcome it.  10% people get virus antibodies another 10% antibodies show actually effective. That's 20% people easily get reinfected There's huge difference rapidly going rapidly going down!

I hope larger trend, Christmas traveler cases winding weren’t vaccines last summer!! Huh that’s strange. Might want send modmail mods.  13.1 million according new york times! odd sad, reminds v much Covid real/just flu/Trumpist-type denial we've seen last year. probably inevitable though sheer length lack ""hope"" (something burned us thus far IMO). too! parents would selfish travel right maybe selfish boomers easy. living cheaper suburbs, find job. move jobs were. Ding ding ding!! large percentage vaccines going elderly high-risk - ones far likely end hospital and/or die, metrics restrictions for. Getting people vaccinated going make greatest impact. That’s don’t need 60% 80% whatever vaccinated reopen. threat hospitals, that’s it.  one though. Automod reliable unfortunately, hence manual inclusion. Summer: hit 100k cases crap myself.

Me 2 Weeks Ago: hit 100k cases lower I'm buying nice bottle champagne celebrate tonight. It’s 5 days. Yeah sucks we’ve near entire summer basically restriction free rest world shitshow. entire generation vote Brexit Tory. hard younger people wait months? I'm sure count 'boomer' partner next age bracket offered jab, parents also it, one disabled severely impacted lockdown, bored really bad time due services cancelled. I'm happy they're protected now. sit home wait two months. South Lake Thursday. Driving home awful lol Reminds fuckup last summer regards asymptomatic pre-symptomatic spread. Oh GOD!! people would read I’m REFERRING TO! course wear one RIGHT saying won’t wearing one vaccinated/other people get vaccinated. guys acting like assholes. DeSantis declared Florida completely open September, California closed even outdoor dining look one worse winter. Human behavior definitely plays big part COVID, rising falling cases saw certain states winter, say human behavior probably factor determines rate COVID spread. hahaha hoping we're better place covid then!! Someone doesn’t understand percentages.... suspect roaring twenties. know ended unfortunately suspect one may end way even quite bad last one. Bring back roaring twenties! understand saying. friends think ok loosen someone authority tells to. Unfortunately, think that's going happen very, slowly. There's going day (not soon, anyway) government says, ""Ok, clear! Back normal! *giggle*"" going push pull, people tired testing boundaries, starting disobey more. stinks way, think going gradual degrees, immense pressure society. know of...unless asymptomatic. Never got tested! Lol Peter Daszak cant trusted. Conflict interest Sick fucking burn. She'll get voted back crazy high numbers think popularity matters all. 

Majority white families across country vote purely based hate bigotry - white-ass state like Iowa elect back even approval rating 2% mean numbered? Christians. role COVID-19 vaccines may ultimately akin flu shot: reducing hospitalizations deaths mitigating disease’s severity. COVID-19 vaccines whole excellent preventing severe disease, level protection far seems hold even new coronavirus variant found South Africa causing reinfections. This, rather herd immunity, achievable goal vaccines.

I think lion's share Americans, ""reducing hospitalizations deaths,"" flu shots, work fine. get COVID shot (and annual boosters, natch) greatly reduce chance get it, hence spread others. Also get it, virtually eliminate chance kill cripple me.

and antivaxxer blockheads never get vaccine, later catch COVID, well, ""play stupid games, win stupid prizes"". again, mine protected. good enough What's point printing stuff like quite obviously author idea. There’s evidence asthma significant risk factor. think emphasis ""evidence"" part. coronavirus before? UnCoMfOrTaBlE Perhaps average person know ""disease logic"" is. aMeRiCa!!!! That's disgusting. think wearing face covering 20 minutes store everyone go essential goods ""annoying,"" lame re-assess willingness sacrifice minimal level comfort safety others. better. stay home afraid drunk drivers.  vaccine reduces chance getting COVID19 *symptoms* 95%. None tests aware checked asymptomatic infections, part clear degree protection vaccines provide transmission. far answer seems be, ""Some."" Seriously. headline click bait trigger small minded, selfish people. people working home get shots grocery store employees? would ever flu??? First all, one listens public health experts deadly pandemic, flu definitely won’t. Masks prevent corporations making money, soon needed gone. It’s simple logic people 33% immunity now? Seems little early end Biden's ""100 days masking."" seems like sub taken accounts advocate forgetting Covid opening economy. suspicious change Must either vary natural state fatigued shitty notice.

Over 24 hours got sore arm basically immediately turned political talking point, went Hannity brag ""reopening Iowa"" (as ever closed) days later. even pretending encourage Iowans wear masks we're ""open"" now. It’s really not. Unless live developing country, almost over. Love adorable puppies. ok, ok. means anywhere 10-20 million fully vaccinated, right? stalks them? Like sentient boogeyman? That's necessarily true. developing boosters reason (both companies), geared towards E484K variants concern. non-issue seen drop ability neutralize (even still end day). may long time significant drop efficacy occurs (hopefully), may be. really know yet.

This virtually every virologist I've seen said matter. situation indeed hopeful stay science-based perspective consider real possibilities. shame obvious stuff gets voted repeatedly Cuba already used interferon beta ... like what... June 2020 already success that. old news.

Edit: Interferon alfa 2B (INFrec) know feel, friend.

Nothing. videos. look virus graphs literally goes upward bam, flat line. suspicious now, seriously hell that? Lease non-renewal means you’re trespassing stay isn’t covered order- current lease, ergo also seeing increase homelessness. rented room well paying lease done, rights. Also completely untrue either Thank donations!! 🙏 gonna rough time everyone gets back normal eh? Wait USA?  quick already booked vaccines 4 times Canada population..This also goes pool.. Well yeah. China. can't trust them. Slashing trade agreements across board largest trading partners certainly did.

In terms finance, astonishing watch London Dont bother man. american tell without doubt countrymen bring sweden discussing covid idea talking likely parroting Qanonsense equally ignorant bullshit. also likely unflinchingly defend trump hate fauci. anal Covid, like never washed bananas before. Trust me, hate Covid. Fucking life fucking hate it. fuck elbow? feel like idiot elbow. QPark going come another video YouTube. Fuck.  Kind point, yeah. trust damn government Trump clearly lying severity virus, trust democratic governor best interests, either. still treat virus seriously go frivolous reasons care individual people might straight kill unknowingly infect them. continually cross fingers I'm going end end one since people clearly feel way risking me. Holy crap. too. don’t know paying attention legit got traumatized something forgot, don’t remember post titles news headlines looking apocalyptic. 

Remember going stores completely empty? Literally produce, dried food, bottled water cleaning supply?

March 13th always stick memory. went grocery store state. line behind two people dressed St. Patrick’s Day outfits hugging talking frightened were. 

We wearing masks went back work following Monday. believe next Friday, company handed us letters stating essential healthcare workers, told us display military police stopped us caught outside house. 

That fun month.

People need hear good news too, there's lot good news right now.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yep. India able make significant headway influence countries Africa pretty beholden China. China unable live end bargain comes vaccination pretty much India Russia pick slack. believe moment world finally says India arrived respected degree world ""respects"" maybe fears China. think likely china may still hold title never know. However suprised find countries like russia, china, NK, brazil, easily manipulating corrupt governments lying. inflection point Jan 10/11. Nowhere near 3 weeks later. months forward, wonder calculate many people murdered flying mom sister Christmas? None us ever covid knowledge. planning trip internet assured murderous. God, imagine outrage US Biden sent vaccines countries everyone chance go get vaccinated.


The government's first job protect citizens, people living US, protect citizens countries. Imagine low-power version could run phones night charging. indeed doubt “body slammed.” 

I’m sure assaulted.

Constant Mindless Hyperbole (and kneejerk partisanship) literally everywhere. Nothing. 140-224 million cases another 38 million vaccinated. Virus running hosts. Good luck getting people wear 2 masks, even though way better(surgical mask/cloth mask combo). 

People Florida can't even comprehend wearing one.(they still believe real, Bill Gates putting microchips people).

I agree sad thing is, always affect people way. could get it, feel fine spread without ever learning lesson, actually impact personal level. Two play game. country loves castle laws, stand ground, gun rights 24 hour television. bad spot, especially children, would use that. One sheriff enough dislodge home. did, would make sure TV crew Oprah around.

What happens use PO Box friend? None people's business live... Respect India. Well good see people like standing racism...which also indicates ignorance. racist uneducated, also moron.  even point. trust pople easily lose give damn... anyone think zinc would it? Think vaccine express lanes freeway. They've moved traffic way allow vaccines get faster. Things change fast. next weekend, won’t seem optimistic - everyone saying it. People talk allowed roll vacation days. Would real dumb decision company allow they've wfh. pretty obvious joke forever 

Actual tweet seems Yes, things we'll different **for while**, mean resume regular lives. I’m picturing May 8, 1945. coronavirus signs unconditional surrender, celebrations immediately break world. Normally I’d make joke “open everything cases spike people gasp” time real hope beginning end. People get reinfected viruses time. Influenza example. completely unsustainable, end goal this? Zero covid impossible even people vaccinated. MIS-C.  88 cases NJ last year.  deaths. 22 cases since December. Infants high schoolers. 

Cases nationally small number deaths. legalize drunk driving? know countries drinkin driving laws well right? always count Americans right thing — they’ve tried everything else” 
*Winston Churchill (allegedly)* know vaccines usually saline solution... That’s true, weekly average dropping remarkably straight line, 240k 160k 80k. longer spread base 240k build from, it’s even less likely 80k still dropping. cure flu, fake sick? Upper Marlboro reporting. want vaccinations. Exactly. many people think possible eradicate virus. never happen. pandemic effectively enough immunity population risk covid becomes less risk flu. point, return normal life live virus like flu (maybe occasional booster shots deal mutations). Eh, there's reason *not* take optimistic view story ridiculous lag-times regards spreading infection--with two-week wobbliness infection symptoms undetected third generation infections ground day twenty start seeing hospital presentations original transmission cohort day one. likely also additional mechanics involved initial viral load challenge communities spread initially unnoticed widespread, although past point matter much here. message mods get flair updated! :) never trust china Yeah. Im pretty much one those. Software dev, working home already something pandemic, home. gamer too, already good high-end hardware, quality microphone headphones, comfy chair long hours gaming. 

So, income didnt go all. Went bit fact, increase demand embedded software devs familiar IOT. money spent aside usual bills lots videogames fancy food orders, coz entertainment had. much spend videogames till literally anything worth owning came past half-decade, trying keep weight check, go overboard food either. managed save quite large sum tbh. Half salary basically - thats addition usual pension/savings deductions had. Loaned friends less fortunate me. plan nice tour EU, probably land France go westward till shores Portugal, visiting every damn drinking establishment see way. wil pay taxes, money tolls. owners probably set tolls high need clients. sell billboards too. depends pricey (and putting clients) private police systems stop black passangers. Lower price = less cheaters = less pricey control.

Basically companies need loved, like Apple ideally, probably come good road deal (definitelly better goverment, doesnt need loved steal money violently taxes without asking).

Some gold membership pricey roads course occur free market really free market, thats good. “This bad news, must true!” china trusted. Twitter it’s going def using US demonstration information China pandemic continues trickle out, suspect may rapidly change. Let's see develops.  **Rule refusing it** pregnant decent amount higher.

The UK's vaccine uptake rate literally 99%. first deaths counties matter. one cares 3rd world ones since healthcare sucks. Atrocious UK much worse America, guess country must even bigger obesity crisis ours. changing rules? Per capita way compare two countries. Otherwise, suggest country failure even half vaccinations :-) Unless NC VA acceptable application communism state control liquor. going small
Order made get quickly.  answer question, hopefully help get vulnerable vaccinated week 2 earlier otherwise would have. old you?  Assuming people trolls, place much better rational discussion. disagree sling names other.

The daily discussion helping get this. *have* go there. Reported mod. too. know things return normal. Sometimes sucks since different risk tolerance others know. finished voluntary quarantine one person see seen positive friends. Huge huge deal.... extremely compelling. Thank Biden! Fuck Trump! successful BioTerrorist human history said differently, directly, flagged.
If high risk, it’s Die drive. I’m sorry plight find in. 

Ask any/every civic org church gas gift card.
Don’t give up, make plan, seek assistance execute plan. Well must Biden’s great work!  /s teacher (who's back since August), I'm ok schools reopening, dang wish meant hybrid went away. back right Thanksgiving numbers, makes sense.

Our cars skyrocketed people gathered Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years. 

And bad thing people numb seem think GREAT NUMBERS forget really high numbers  Tell it. morning really bummed told husband ZeroCovid catches I'm moving far away he's coming me, I'll get arrested--he take pick.  Technically wouldn’t murder unless intended kill people. Otherwise it’s manslaughter.

Either way idea attributing deaths fractions deaths fools errand. said “I tested positive covid, boarded plane, visited people” think we’d talking criminal negligence.

The idea travelling isn’t much issue take reasonable precautions avoid flying covid and/or don’t put position spread widely event become infected. Literally difference would roads could longer used working class due tolls. Yeah quoting biased person possible. might well asked CCP media outreach contact. 

Daszak claimed (publicly repeatedly) past year impossible virus come anywhere wild. financially supported development Wuhan Lab direct, vested interest success. like Philip Morris medical research cigarettes determining smoking negative side effects. NZ literally normal life months. get 3 cases locking 3 total days. 3 days! locking 3 days would take able live life completely normally, you’re telling wouldn’t it? 

Imagine able go football game concert festival without wondering you’re gonna catch COVID. able literally months able less week. top that, NZ starting vaccinations week 

So normal life months gotten vaccinated without killing massive amount population. Sounds like win me. Strange landlord single family home rented around 85% market. flexed rent families could buy kids presents Christmas. used money assist tenant buying one houses paid twelve years earlier. 

Private owners carry lot liability pockets REITs holding purpose built rentals don’t concern with. Full herd immunity June might bit optimistic, point enough people immunity (especially vulnerable) deaths hospitalizations stay low. enough get mostly back normal. add tens millions who, like me, ventured public maybe month, absolutely necessary, wearing mask, watching space, sanitizing hands everything touch.

We've mocked near year now, damn efforts didn't/aren't save/saving lives. right, reason think downvoted people tired quarantining want over. unfortunately virus care feelings. 60% efficacy number SA Novavax huge confidence interval, know exactly effective SA variant. confidence intervals regular trial SA trial actually overlap, even know less effective not. Well look trend least days actually going (Superbowl), hopefully that's minor blip. Mardi Gras, hopefully people go crazy (it's *just New Orleans*, St Patrick's day, Easter.

My big concern people seem acknowledge vaccine drop numbers, end holidays. seem think going ok gather now. Somehow feeling would already know solution riddle let class mate think one year... UK limited genetic surveillance, sequences 7%-10% positive virus samples, absolutely massive sequencing effort. fully sequenced 488,000 viruses couple weeks ago.  There's still flights coming out, plus regular shipping goods. would prefer end? Western countries lockdowns anywhere near strict Melbourne. basically full-on police state 4 months. military stopping everyone left home, breaking car windows people comply. also arrested people anti-lockdown posts facebook. Covid's done.

It's definitely done. Declining, done. lower guard foolish. NY waited weeks reopening indoor dining. numbers may go back again. example think Noah,"" continued. ""How old Noah built ark? 600. like, cashing Social Security checks, hanging out, working. So, think obligation work. role work may change time, concept retirement biblical."" 

Guns around either buddy. Better get rid then. horrified daily vast scope fully completely previous administration failed US people.

(Sure, newest administration trying undo harm trying help, they've started worst handicap I've ever seen, beginning administration, thanks hard work fucking things much humanly possible previous administration.) think UK variant shouldn’t discounted like many thread seem want believe it’s Pfizer‘s mRNA vaccine. usually falsified, every covid death detected first, check weeks later total deaths vs normal pre covid, reasonably assume difference mostly due undetected covid. fear european jab 40% population AZ going party non-stop, south african variant explodes.

I find funny started, lot people pointed downsides masks ""feelings invulnerability, risky behavior, etc"". could vaccine 10% effective variant (that likely become dominant). going problem. It’s like pandemic started everyone world completely forgot middle school level biology.  Damn  Cries Utah 60 99,9% chance you’ll mildly annoyed worst. India probably beat United States zillion downvotes mentioning this. Britain - remember India producing Oxford vaccine, Oxford university gave away cost, profiteering this. Right, sorry. Really depends area. know people FL it’s wild west there. state, also home state still taking seriously 3 days one month Probably is, person age 50 age 16 happens everywhere statistics initially announce death known caused covid, either tests doctor's diagnose based symptoms. worldometer would show. 

But every case detected, done check years excess deaths average years, majority countries found excess deaths much higher deaths positively assigned covid. excess fairly assume mostly due covid pandemic, even though includes every factor, death covid went undetected, deaths illnesses higher normal ( maybe indirectly caused pandemic due people getting adequate attention) well maybe average deaths like flu traffic accidents due less mobility people. real way know sure excess deaths distributed, make v fair assumption blame excess duev pandemic, directly covid indirect deaths. 

The difference covid identified deaths excess mortality time sign governments lying sign adequate statistics health systems. 
A health system might good system identifying diagnosing deaths covid, countries already good statistics total deaths, though usually lag several weeks.  Oh, we're changing rules 496,000 deaths dosen't seem bad. Got none data supports UK highest world per Capita either... worried testing data, J&amp;J vaccine good choice you. based vaccine line approved, tested products market years (the ebola HIV vaccines made janssen).  OK skeptical put body, people compassion understanding that. blown proportion. People essentially saying we'd reinfected Covid months. based rapidly dropping antibody levels initally. generally stablizes protection pretty good although perfect. can’t wait see freakout November 21 cases rise again. Impressive see fast scaled vaccine production. also much infrastructure skill drug manufacturing now. Good job, India! Greed reason. that's fine

If possible rent anything except purpose built rentals. Renting private owners usually gigantic markup want make profits stocks though can't push edges. escape somewhere protections somewhere buy. Imagine 50 60 70 getting kicked out. world depends China. They’ve become default choice manufacturing many things long they’ve made absolutely necessary. Manufacturing starting expand elsewhere Asia China gigantic head start. this, rest world must tolerate them. 93% effectiveness still means 7 100 get infected exposure. ~100 known infections ~20,000,000 vaccinations pretty good. See 2023! Trudeau competing NZ Australia longest lockdown. really sucks.  point arguing guy. someone brings gun control covid thread they're far gone kind reasonable discussion. like Brazil, awful combination corrupt government society putting first overrall have... 500,000 won't. problem boat everyone else comes making plans future. Like, planning wedding anything important government could effectively cancel hours notice. Still, better watching hundreds die every day. guess little (holidays variants) we’ll never know much much b. point would valid weeks ago? Trump won? makes comeback 4 years.

Point is, US capable lying public. Literally every civilised nation: 

Healthcare, gun reform, democratic elections. 

America: 

But muh rights young luke part. Haha. 
Thanks man. 
I hope fly sooner August though. experience, August always expensive season fly in. Unless airlines decide give passengers ""welcome back"" discount flight tickets. Besides. Fauci really right vaccines becoming available mass late April, might luck. 

I want damn vaccine passports turn second class citizen, lucky enough get vaccinated, complete freedom lives blown proportion. People essentially saying we'd reinfected Covid months. based rapidly dropping antibody levels initally. generally stablizes protection pretty good although perfect.

Also: Science-tists share 3-month updated findings, using honest phrasing like ""we solid evidence immunity lasting least three months, data still coming in.""

The new/blogs share snippet, says ""scientists see three months immunity far, we'll keep updated.""

The panicked and/or undereducated citizen reads thinks means lasts *exactly* three months. post Twitter broken everything vaccine lasts three months.

The scientists wonders everyone mad them, 3 months original update prepare share hard evidence ""that immunity lasts least 6 months, data still coming in.""

Their first update still dominating social media loop. take least months get everyone vaccinated, think it’s interim period concern. Fortunately, data coming showing vaccines reduce transmission don’t eliminate it. unfortunately it’s still necessary maintain precautions hit sweet spot high vaccination rate low prevalence. Yeah, really hope actually sticks around. nice even getting cold year. Except vaccines set risks. Albeit low, anything put body risks. 100% correct furniture companies making slow change move production Vietnam SE Asian countries due Chinese labor costs. Sidepoint Mexico also getting manufacturing. think 100% change future though. Sooner later rent bubble burst. people paid rent nearly year landlords can't evict them. There's way people year's rent **will** get evicted sooner later. starts happening slew people evictions. Landlords turning people away evicted pandemic make good business. Probably explained fact covid much likely kill people already seriously ill Yeah, especially seeing high cases per capita European countries second wave, given current scandals involving certain east coast governor, really think west collectively failed pandemic US would still worlds' highest cases count even competent administration. website information worldwide? goal isn’t zero COVID forever. It’s zero COVID population gets vaccinated R&lt;1 even everything open normal. Vaccines never 100% effective would sane person look forward that? investigator western media offer conflicting I’ve seen studies showing masks vitamin don’t help too... stick common sense comes stuff. Zinc Vitamin C lessen symptoms duration common cold flu viruses. reason believe antiviral properties would uniquely work extent covid. Taking moderation harm, I’ll continue taking. Well yes much Europeans Americans. look deaths per Million. bad news

* mRNA vaccines prevalent developed mere days genome sequenced published. packaged within week first tests. 

And good news 

* technology new, development decades steady incremental breakthroughs 
* actually lucky technology going production, traditional tech using weakened adenovirus vectors months slower.
* time developing vaccines spent large scale trials, trials show prevalence serious side effects indistinguishable background rate.

In conclusion, far riskier take part commuting work, walking, taking shower take approved vaccines. 

And far riskier, take vaccine. get COVID19 myriad already proven long term complications. I’m sure vaccine factor People who've tested positive wait long time vaccine. know sounds like minor thing, we're pushing reopening eventual herd immunity back weeks wasting vaccines people already mostly immune. least Trump transparent

Mask mandates.

Created sense community pride fighting together. headline misquotes/uses stupid quote match article. article says 22m lost 9.8m fewer jobs. 60% lost jobs back already take 2023 get 100% (based forecasts etc.). could 99% year. maybe company could, know, hire people compensate? God forbid people actually get time work recharge. Instead they'd rather work every employee bone wonder productivity suffers. Yes. Thats gonna driver. fact, tech probably slow down, less demand, would advise savings covid time spend once. noticeable growth immediately - certain sectors completely shut down, wont recover fully 2 years optimistic estimates, still immediately better, keep going up. Growth breeds optimism economy, people likely engage economic activity, likely open business make investments growing economy. thanks dose optimism previously infected Corona body already developed antibodies it, LESS response vaccine body already prepared need mount new immune response.

Please reframe comment way instead ""support mental health."" Completely incorrect. 95% population willing months don’t know sure natural immunity actually working on. even Europeans, anti-UK hate actually comes UK itself.

As example /r/Europe probably balanced subreddit UK news, far /r/unitedkingdom generally hate anything positive UK does. China damaged coronavirus cooperation OP, it’s time optimist2021. also less obesity usa. Also probably much less vitamin deficiency. mean. short article says people getting ""dead butt"", like dead leg, sitting arses.

They ""gravely damaged international cooperation Covid-19,"" statement said, adding U.S. ""acting none ever happened,"" ""pointing fingers countries faithfully supporting WHO.""
""With track record, win confidence whole world,"" added.
The statement released less 24 hours White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said U.S. “deep concerns” way findings WHO’s investigation communicated.

After released preliminary findings last week, Dominic Dwyer, Australian infectious diseases expert team, told Reuters Saturday requested raw patient data 174 cases China identified early phase outbreak Wuhan, well cases, provided summary.
His comments came media reports suggested investigators denied data requested trip.

However, another member team, Prof. John Watson told BBC Sunday ""a great deal data"" provided Chinese criticism information handed ""characterise mission whole.""

And death rate case rate FL. Per capita better FL. wide open like FL we'd much higher per capita. Sounds like post-viral syndrome uncommon. Hope goes away soon! Covid flu. sucked. I’ll meet bar Joe Rogan going upset this. No, backwards. studied whether giving Covid positive patients Zinc+VC would shorten symptoms, didn’t.

Summary, eat oysters! ?

The people want coup, people afraid covid ***exact*** opposite people. want ""make money"" rental? care profit lags stocks lags comparables?

Even nicest guy ever, fact kick someone reason ""lease ends"" makes unacceptable someone wants lay roots. Maybe malicious maybe need property whatever reasons. Meanwhile purpose built rentals drop matter long money kept coming. Nothing personal. Yeah. know there's much attitude lost jobs recover like flip switch. Even good percentage people kept jobs accumulated good amount savings, spending recover jobs already lost. anything recover short order. NHS procure vaccines fund research manufacturing? someone copy paste article. comply EU data protection laws bit. still 100k per day average. things bit different, Israel priority received 1st dose get 2nd within 21 days. slows things tiny bit. Issue people wanting vaccine become noticeable, still plenty want it. estimates see 60-70% vaccinated population till start seeing major decline demand. Nah, what's likely contamination. I'm anti-vaccine I'm black cable technician severe asthma, option take it.

I literally see damage caused virus firsthand everyday dat

 see families moving back parents...

I see old customers mine died...

I see homeless people area I've never.seen before...

So guys jumping joy first dose might effective, I'm risking life fiximg internet overtime, talk me.

Thanks That's quite silly headline. ""Inadequacy Russian testing procedures revealed"" would like it. like statistical information mortality classified, failing diagnose 80% Covid deaths quite bad.

For comparison, Slovenia (one hardest hit countries, second deaths per million scale) 3736 excess deaths last year, 2796 reported Covid. 

So assume real percentage same, Russia would nearly 258 thousand official Covid deaths 2020 recorded well Slovenia. would put figures 1,176 deaths per million, Slovenia UK. clickbait media too. hyping variants much one hand, I'm taking academic approach, lot people afraid, preparing worst. I'm inclined decide several opinions.

On hand, may goober:

 never come across people IRL. purely internet/Reddit phenomenon

Because they're sheltered home, ya goose Please explain us Biden done, that’s independent trends prior pretty lazy journalism. excess deaths figures known months, lot major countries obviously also higher excess deaths. Australia - basically business lost 30% revenue got $750/wk/employee, proviso keep workers on. Saved *lot* jobs.

1 case bit 300 days Perth... even pre rona, mean... sure hell want bring kid world. fuck noise. big reason rural counties uptake much lower, prevent wasting doses open up. similar thing happening live. getting people 75 plus uptake really good start getting people age 75 uptake going pretty quickly. suggests we'll probably vaccines available almost everyone mid late March live. China still needs pay... let world know knew November 2019, never would’ve gotten far. totally both, often are. Plus damned poorly educated people country. ending restrictions lockdowns never solution.

Can put stone tablet read start next pandemic? learn proceed steal valuable irreplacable time (still) healthy people actually enjoy living life?

Thanks advance.  really never area that's case. 22 million work stripped cash? knew could get rich collecting paycheck. agree. people need spend money make tourism come back etc. work industry caters upper middle class up. actually saved money pandemic, industry bounce back.

Is fair? Absolutely not. is, mean right. like economy stock market going ""move on"" without poor people. continually forgotten. That's going happen month. open entertainment dining hotels instant. take years recover. mention people, like myself, hopefully get re-employed, make less need recover lost income. way going splurge anything. Likely story 22 million others also unemployed. true irrelevant direct conversation, since drops cases hospitalizations lot three generations old People tried, comment gets deleted lol You’re indiaspeaks, pal. sub’s infamous fake news propaganda echo chamber. hilariously fail counter facts pity, chest thumping, hollow sense nationalism... Could agree more.

And start federal government lead vaccine distribution 3-5M people vaccinated per day month so, call rest assured would happened trump Lol hope it’s people taking seriously Funny last year told masks don’t help you, help others around you. quickly science changes! basically said looking forward cases rising fall. going that? Wouldn’t make people want get tested future, might end back line vaccine? require people proof, would need show they’ve tested negative periodically, slowing process. point, it’s much getting nurses staff inject many people possible that’s bottleneck. fact people look counter narrative automatically brand negative/bad fucking horrifying. course people anti-lockdown. vaccine, cases decline, year, anybody anti-lockdown point either skin game lacks empathy enough full fill 400 million government ordered. specific study mention it.

However, no, vaccine 100% efficacy rate hospitalizations death. last reported stats saw deaths single digits *total* (keep mind COVID death rate Israel several dozen *daily*).  4 became ""seriously ill"", none died. Among vaccinated [Hospitalization rates confirmed range 12.2% (65-74), 17.2% 85) US. safely assume numbers would similar Israel age groups, make bulk early vaccinated. 544 confirmed infections would expect see least 66 hospitalizations unvaccinated.  I’m starting get really frustrated WHO. say COVID didn’t originate lab (it may have, proof definitively say that?), also apparently aren’t sure originated China. Apparently could’ve come exported meat shit. Like wtf WHO? acting like china’s lapdog? need demand transparency/structure reduce funding them/fund meaningful org don’t comply making large quantities vaccine Britain, said contract signed British government requires fulfil Britain’s order send doses manufactured abroad, including EU.” pointing legitimate issues facts isn’t acceptable anymore? Counter facts, propaganda driven messages Zero COVID *can't* happen time soon. disease way widespread animal reservoirs.

It's political thing. literally can't eradicated reasonable amount time. Areas higher population density also likely sustained spread. I'm getting vaccine equitably possible, beating starts cities view. Many people can't social distance due housing situations. also guy [was hit lightning participating Moderna vaccine vitro testing pre print apparently dozen samples (non disclosed reason, probably would've shown statistically irrelevant).

I didnt teleport anything, unlike actually read everything.

There 4000+ thousands strains, tested vaccine vitro couple samples acquired, even then, ""robust"" headline says pretty much marketing statement based data doesnt mean natural immunity isnt enough, all. 

A study like START, could replicate exact experiment exact opposite result doesnt look statistically relevant.

I cringe random internet people like trying push study clearly understand headline. easy understand someone trying make billions vaccine would push preprint help sell it. typical response feeling control minimize problem insist everyone else ridiculous. emotionally driven, many people cope. government actively fight scientists, Pillow CEO Neurologist chief medical advisors infectious disease. Zero covid figment imagination small number people. even America. keep hate, hopefully things get better soon!  corona kid new swear word next 20 years Yeah it’s insane. state tuition state school well. Yeah, every day don’t cases increasing decreases time 3rd/4th wave get going again.  Thanks! Work big wine chain NC. amount people want liquor can’t get crazy! 
Also found SC get curbside beer wine, spirts anything 15%(port wine come mind) curbside pick uped must store pick up. Seems like picking hairs thanks. awful girls. wonder many children becoming orphans due this. Yeah, along millions died cancer, heart disease, etc time span. pretty big: 
 new study Israel’s largest healthcare provider, Clalit, shows 94% drop symptomatic infections people vaccinated coronavirus, 92% drop serious illness among fall ill.  study reviewed 600,000 people who’ve received Pfizer vaccine — though unclear already received doses — compared 600,000 people yet vaccinated.  study follows [one Maccabi published last week showed half million people vaccinated doses Pfizer vaccine, 544 people — 0.1% — subsequently diagnosed coronavirus, four suffered severe illness, none died. knew day would come! NZ going limited lockdown, 3. Probably longer have. What’s worse even knowing virus, western nations didn’t take serious. That’s worse Maybe, remember exactly 80 90. Besides, might mixing estimates federal authorities city's healthcare committee (which, interestingly seems label deaths COVID-related excess mortality shows) year ago people saying bodies would litter streets I’d say they’d okay happening place see zero covid mentioned threads people complaining zero coviders.

No policy maker expects make zero covid reality. flip side governments taken life away year many healthy citizens. He'd rather go overboard give false hope going away soon. forgetting winter far worse due inept messaging previous administration? findings true, must wider search samples around World. might possible ancestral version virus circulating way before. mean, yes no. We've pandemics past, changes things... it'll change things ways probably affect people,maybe better cleaning protocols businesses stuff like that.

But we'll go back concerts events things people soon enough return would consider normalcy. Chinese government would never less honest. story  takes thought I'd read ""corporations run love come good road deal; maybe even gold membership roads"" one them, thank greatly it. expect that, huge expectation - fact among bare minimum I'd expect. 

That said, appreciate people get limited sick pay, case suppose hard blame them. first infection? Weird, one ever wants quote US numbers Yeah think obvious can't look COVID cases peaking last week Trump's presidency credit Biden fall...but also obvious Biden Trump was, Trump would done re-elected. helped. 350m people US. 10’s million crap. “Herd immunity” need least 70% think 85%+ virus. close especially new variants popping up. Look happened UK. Please stay vigilant. 2 masks n95/kf94 masks. Social distance, go large crowds. let guard spike again.
Hopefully deaths continue decline older people get vaccinated deaths issue. 20% “recovered” people still issues. want get covid. Keep smart, follow CDC recommendations, double mask get better mask, social distance, wash hands Maybe also explain people get infected. back February 2003. wear masks

How dare say ""M"" word? gasp. 

I think many Americans think cold flu, hear people using interchangeably. ""Oh, head flu"". far same. hospitalized years ago. one son 8 years old, also spent night hospital well (I get flu shot prior incident, son did, still think smart get shot, convincing hand hard). cases pneumonia. spreading
Chinese lies propaganda lol Would love vaccine elicits IgA antibodies prevent mucosal replication transmission. You’re triple counting. don’t 51m people vaccinated, 51m doses delivered. many vaccines went people previously infected literally look testing numbers. don’t need “hear” anyone. like multiple independent viral outbreaks weakly contagious virus becoming acclimated humans, lots failed starts spawning sustained outbreak.

Something many suspected (because weird before-the timeline samples/cases) others said impossible stick science. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Pretty close rare IMO research community using 5/100 cutoff point “rare” (read: statistical significance) since Fisher 1925. Still first wave USA receiving vaccines EU. 

For example BioNtech plant Marburg. None anything decrease  Dropping faster April harsher lockdown better weather. million dollar question got extremely close localized collapse cities various times. Generally things got bad area, people reacted adjusting behavior reason happened want admit infection causes immunity pregnant caught it. horrible chest pains, resting heart rate 130+ bpm, debilitating headaches lost taste smell. Still full taste smell back 6 months later. nothing mildly annoying it. really source claim Good job, India. Take care brothers north. US needs beer, maple syrup, hockey curling. Kidding aside, hope works Canada. Yes largely people.

I say course mega-lefties waiting fail, like side... people actually ""marched"" last month not-rooting virus, generally believe problem (or perhaps even exist). saying can't question even 80% population vaccinated can't fully open return normalcy? frankly insane. vaccine ever going administered 100% population, essentially saying need restrictions ever. 
   
Plus, whole point measures keep hospitals overwhelmed. vulnerable old vaccinated risk longer exists, point would cruel continue restrictions.
  
COVID going eradicated. People need learn accept need move life OP concerned vaccinated unknowingly spread not. vaccinated protected vaccines yet. don’t get Covid protect mom. Don’t see her. 

I don’t know tell lmao. Nahh summer bro already businesses closing it. Places back home open decades exporting stuff EU literally can't operate they'd hire 2-3 people full time paperwork theyll lose money. Many hobby shops buy massive stock issues literally can't get stuff need europe time good price due mess.

Brexit already massive impact. r/india lurker many years. toxic sludge filled propaganda mod abuse. downright disgusting sub. Anecdotal evidence scientific evidence. mean...I don’t know sure let’s roll plus side?  guess find either antibodies probably okay time get sick later. even know matters, nobody going put post-vaccination restrictions.  don’t think Apart last two times worked allowed us live without restrictions months time.

And also added benefit thousands people dying. especially look downvoted comments actually person drank coffee breakfast Good news we’re done Stay safe yes definitely prioritize! Good luck! don’t know yet whether mutation makes variants contagious, concerned might. warning, escape dumb pieces shit anywhere U.S. Israel? US? Elsewhere? think everyone live knows someone hospitalized, long hauling, died virus.one estimate saw amount virus area 40 45 percent people . I'd say shitbecame real 25 30% people probably virus like early November. mean many my?  neither NZ Australia *consistently*. course everything 100% would preferred, swinging back forth heavy lockdowns open terrible, good approach all. Clearly Bherm100 saying, yes, forever. Masks stiched surgical procedures starting soon. Oh NO! vaccinated causes susceptible lightning strikes. /S 😂 New Zealand Australia racing vaccinate populace.

So far neither really started mass vaccinating im really sure waiting for. almost natural immunity. only. share friends perfectly modern thinking skeptic vaccination. guess it’s don’t know anyone personally hurt disease. 2 Every time virus replicates, chance mutate. hosts, replications.

This go past April/May ""open season"" Fauci said. read comment, lost credibility implied BBC propaganda Chinese state media isn't.

I never claimed anything like this, putting words mouth.

I debunked ""lack transparency"" allegation using western media sources.

BBC independent CGTN meaning all. two **western** studies concluding BBC independent especially comes foreign countries.

However, strange observation PR department China tends reliable many supposedly ""independent"" Western media concerning China. say? find places even Western media go ""mainstream"" narrative often contradict themselves. one cannot clear consistent view China using western media.

That said last time sick October 2019... Lung infection all, fine far... Spending time makes think real world like here, go outside actually talk people, quickly realize nearly every opinion find exact opposite there, thankfully. Stop posting anecdotal fear mongering. would changed recently? suspicion many people still able reinfected Brazilian South African strains. I've seen early immunology numbers we'd expect maybe 50% efficacy antibodies vaccine perhaps marginally higher vaccine. 50% people show neutralizing antibody activity remaining 50% show sharply reduced neutralizing activity. however, said that, also know cells working fine strains. likely reduce amount time infectious well reduce severity although still get illness able spread others. one potential concern relying t-cell immunity strongly correlated severity infection... people got mild may much way t-cell immunity may prone actually getting worse reinfection compared someone got severe first time strong cell immunity  Follow science studies done two shots needs norm True vaccine mandatory New Zealand since there’s immunity. certainly case rates low vaccinated #s high. likely also worthwhile crowded places like public transport.

If last vestige wearing mask extra months, not? understand that's hill die on.

Restrictions capacity difficult social distancing measures first go. masks helpful easy. Plus, can't really tell vaccinated. That’s anecdotal, though. Overall figures show decline. Yesss there’s soooo many jobs right (in US) can’t speak UK Vaccinations without government fucking up. We've working this, us since August September. think pregnant doctors expected person pre-vaccination either reassigned telehealth duties time being. instead level accommodations teachers high risk groups, generally every teacher teach online person students, since student's choice come back. 

I needed keep teaching portion students online unpaid maternity leave enough subs year kids would otherwise nothing. unfair?

A bunch us laid August, class sizes huge. We've told thousands us need laid school year. supposed keep morale we've working hardest handle groups students once, even know we're still going job this, everyone online calls us lazy. worked hospital bed labor, standard lazy selfish. 

The average American worker mistreated general mean wish groups. people realize legit CHINESE factories Northern Italy filled chinese nationals working minimum wage make garments labeled ""Made Italy"". clothing stitchers could've carriers infected whole community since number imported workers (often illegal &amp; table) substantial. Freedom isn’t free. could drastically reduce deaths making alcohol, unhealthy food, leisure travel tobacco illegal. could save way 500k deaths year. Three million Americans die year!!

A virus one percent death rate simply isn’t worth government lock house without even trial. loss freedom New Zealanders affects every single citizen New Zealand. Every single one lives country government take away ability leave house country. Americans lost lives, survived (99%+) retained freedoms. 

Young New Zealanders especially sacrificed since would likely die many causes covid. handed government liberty elderly people live extra years. It’s tragic young people New Zealand across world given elderly people live longer. catching courier packages mail 

how would know this? Yeah France come past week said doubt France December 2019. So, like say, surprise all. 10 days valentine day entered chat.  Lol. study done kids even went back school fall.

The cdc doesn’t carry much weight right given mixed messages botched responses last year. know Novavax point estimate 86% efficacy UK strain. case moderna 85% efficacy senior citizens original wild type strain. Pfizer running well ahead numbers Israel 90% UK strain point. really has! Colleges throughout US giving students random days instead huge spring break.

p. 31 said, Israel strong safety net, not.

Why pumping money Israel even universal healthcare access pandemic? Thanks!!! Yeah, need 4 5 weeks past second dose gather enough data make sort analysis? 


I concerns quality Israeli medical data. World class. say people got sick terms vaccinated? got sick shortly getting first shot v later second one, there’s probably different level immune response play. Yeah course did, basically heavy lifting develop vaccines it’s right get first. Seems pretty reasonable me. Bro... fist? course. didn’t claim either, jumped assumptions/accusations wanted clear air show old article topic support statement. sure? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Mmm, l see point, would lie death rate? wouldn’t know. healthcare workers America interact COVID patients waiting first dose vaccine. almost whole production distribution thing started ramp plenty holes yet addressed lacked means so. make nearly sexy clickbait title. people starting say US delay vaccinations young people send vaccines abroad Liquor stores fine COVID though. They're going business, even restaurants take cocktails. 

Probably somewhat different clientele well. Restaurant cocktails, takeout not, cheap booze. Rare, zero. also don’t know new variants affect people getting Covid twice. mean get it, remain asymptomatic, transmit new variants easily transmitted. Oh that’s still vague though kidding. one fabled White Americans. 

Race class always place discussions it’s foolish ignore them.

I still laugh comment replied to. would love live world live in. could stop talking everything bad miraculously rectified. It’s though. showed NY school system people less likely get sick. false. study shows schools risk. vaccine probabaly open thw general public April/May. Leblanc likely never seen actual Pfizer contract speak contents. asked Stephenson whether anything federal government’s contract prevented provinces buying doses Pfizer Moderna, LeBlanc said nothing deal would “preclude province deciding want pursue parallel different strategy.” 

This Minister Intergovernmental Affairs Dominic LeBlanc answering question Vulcan. Vulcan's cannot lie, want avoid speaking truth state fact nothing answering question. Procurement Minister Anita Anand also recently learned speak Vulcan.

This also exactly provincial premiers (and rest Canada) gradually realizing misled beginning.

For example . . . PHAC department approves particular sale, use administration drug anywhere Canada. No, wait that's Vulcanese PHAC rubber-stamp whatever FDA approves use States. 

In case Pfizer Moderna vaccines, temporary emergency use approval provided provinces cannot negotiate directly manufacturer. Two years Pfizer's vaccine [is beyond Interim fully approved, likely province doctor order Pfizer. 

Asking Minister Leblanc federally approved drug use useful asking Manitoba's premiere they'd want undermine federal distribution vaccines Canada.

Neither pandemic experts going get Vulcan answer. effective preventing symptomatic disease severe disease? COVID cause loss taste without losing sense smell? significantly severe loss taste smell? people mostly young savvy real world reality. also probably hard time accepting spent last year scoffing downvoting “economy” concerns, pushed unbalanced policies created situation. Like somehow “economy” isn’t also people’s lives, big business never danger fact mostly gained policies. think growth proportion amid falling cases they’re concerned.

Secondly, don’t think vaccines tested mutations SA variant. mutation spike protein. answer isn’t yet “no,” it’s don’t know.  don’t know. Lost family member one favorite restaurant owners covid. Brother also bartender, correct work healthcare 1/3. 


Do disagree vaccinations make impact deaths? stats disagree you. Really depends are, US back least hybrid, although we've back 5 days per week since beginning here. We've person since August regardless conditions anyone vaccine priority. obviously nonsense go back they're getting vaccine priority. AstraZeneca currently US’s apparent plans 

The Brazil variant shows potential degree lost efficacy nothing approaching amount would call “not working”

The US’s genomic sequencing stepped quite bit. Sure, can’t prove don’t sudden new variant new enough influencing current positive trajectory also shows properties immune evasion order magnitude stronger anything seen date. seems remote enough described searching things worried about.

It would difficult spike protein mutate much moots vaccines entirely still allows efficient cell entry. may even possible. don’t freedom. live locked country doesn’t second amendment. hate respect Americans’ culture freedom now. mean statistically you’re wrong, but...... definitely spent many points lethality COVID-19. Rookie mistake. Everyone knows win infect many people possible first without killing lot people scientists don’t pay much attention cure/vaccine. believe Japan much better shape widespread mask use even pandemic.

However, hospitals near capacity nearly impossible get tested, even symptoms! Therefore, long excess death numbers, really know actual number deaths. Compare number tests per capita industrialized nation they're laughable. third economy world, hard think incapable testing thus identifying COVID cases &amp; deaths... American don’t understand botch? COVID-19 going anywhere. going us long haul, like coronaviruses. new variants time. significant are. know South African Brazilian strain really worthy note considering vaccinating. matter percentage variants going long overall denominator shrinking keep going lot. Oh administered: 3'967'246  shots: 2'635'673  shots: 1'331'573

Data Feb 12th, reporting Sunday “news makes uncomfortable therefore must fake incorrect.” I'll take vaccine, put something arm. True. office told us April 1 first day back office, back October, heard peep since then. feeling it'll eeked back bit.

We probably wear masks common areas office time. thats going company's choice. is, ultimately temporary. hospitalization rate drops state live cases mysteriously drops? mistaken assuming already. Absolutely.

We get back normal lot regards, there's going major paradigm shifts come well. natural effect kind massive societal upheaval stipends Israel receives far tied military medical production general aid. 

This made rigid trump's term office. 

The money give closer payment military medical advancement tech sort general aid. Probably didnt use strictly vaccine distribution. 

Israel decent job healthcare. Regardless funds US provides. compare countries receive aid really close.   ? There’s evidence people permanently lost sense taste smell So, numbers many people sent ""quarantine"" locations symptoms covid originally, got infected died? would nice know applaud approach. know, sending people death cough OK. Economic stimulus restaurants. It’s way. Question, let's say masks stay (don't believe will) make immune system weak? PR well warpspeed kicked ass.

The CCP learning information operations Russia, undisputed masters game. week would great hear many stories month/months, brother 2 weeks without. love eat drink coffee sucks.  please explain? works, Russia ~2% population vaccinated far, almost effect overall mortality. need test agressively there's covid - test symptoms influenza largely gone year people symptoms. test people likely catch (like work borders), surveillance test people random, test sewerage see there's undetected outbreak. keep labs prepared massive surges testing case detected.

Maintenance mode country different mode hunting virus. considered issues HoH people would face this. Thank reasonable differing viewpoint. certainly hope so. AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine significantly less effective South African strain, vaccines seem less effective (possibly ineffective) Brazil P.1 strain spike protein mutation, US sequence viral samples enough know variants evolved among 28 million+ US cases. Columbus, OH strain mutations spike protein yet tested vaccine (happy corrected this). promising new vaccines development right vaccines primarily use spike protein train immune system, significant spike protein mutation reduce effectiveness. vision new need careful spread respiratory things we'll different safety daily careful high prevalence seasons

I hate seemingly innocuous phrases like mean absolutely nothing own. *any* look like? language used advocate better sick leave system US normalization voluntary mask-wearing sick. Which, cool, that? exact language also used justify shutting entire industries, enforce strict social distancing protocols year, villainize people want hang friends. Words like ""careful"" ""safe"" mean nothing anymore, people need say really think needs happen stop hiding vague undefined space ""maybe wash hands more"" ""don't leave house years"" Yea someone brings race class lot white Americans change topic. goes ways mate. Trust damaged.  you’re “anti-mask” I’m going go ahead assume you’re immature probably wouldn’t friends person anyway. 

Literally one saying need mask end time. wouldn’t divide could suck what’s scientifically best awhile. real? Freedom isn’t free. 

Yeah, already cost half million fathers, mothers, sons daughters. least people cough spit policemen.  true, population time already way fear disease government. scared death. That's many surrounding provinces voluntarily locking down, villages. much Chinese government forcefully reopen much China economic reasons, forcing factories reopen, forcing people go back work, disease contained.

If people western nations afraid COVID Chinese people, people Asian countries. hit hard were.

East Asian countries general handled disease much better regardless democratic authoritarian governments. Precisely people fear disease, everyone take seriously. feel it, reason to. think talking median age, that's 26,8 years think point guy trying make stress worry actually (physically mentally emotionally) bad health. 

Understand risk. Take precautions see fit. Don’t go don’t want to. 

But don’t lie awake night cold sweat something literally cannot control.  still remember hashtag Twitter start pandemic...#chinaliedpeopledied Thank you! probably originated Europe Good news!

Americans fighting like hell go back old normal. going new normal. 

So proud. Woops, minority typo, read majority.

It's always 70 percent margin. think adjust move forward cases keep going like are. Need get 3M day. sure supply let us. car parks?

For real? DDing table.

While think would factor high percentage drunk driving incidents, think bit foolish think allowing take-out drinks cause slight increase drunk driving incidents.

The easier something, happen. rocket science, forcing someone stop liquor store way home work addition Red Robin order drink drive decrease amount drunk driving incidents. anyone know prognosis someone who’s Pfizer vaccine developed symptoms 6 days (possibly immunity develop)?

Symptoms being; cough, shivers, mild fatigue changes smell taste (not complete loss). 

Confirmed Covid positive day 16 since vaccine. 

Thanks I'm sure going bunch racist comments; but, shocker. first country hit months advance notice like rest world. seen huge nations like US blow lead still get swamped report. lucky China recognized virus all. would almost totally unenforceable. condition getting vaccine needs way person signing shot prove they're eligible. ID proves age letter employer prove job. could prove *haven't* tested positive?

So could make recommendation, there's practical way make requirement. I’d feel really bad kids exposed massive quantities COVID-19 every day measures place protect them, know kid scared go school stomach bug going around, let alone pandemic respiratory virus Lol troll, India vaccine powerhouse even Covid. 60% world’s vaccine imported India. fucking research writing nonsense. Almost entirety Oregon rural...and like CA ""rural."" largest (by population density, area) Portland half million people.

The largest city Southern Oregon Medford, less 100K people. county 4th largest state 200K.

It's also stormy (rainy snowy) there's fewer interactions among people right milder season.

The point data point cautious application what's going major urban areas rest US. always mild annoyance. people told news sources, they'll finally believe it. Ok doc ;)   numbers steadily climbing, it’s hard imagine plateau anytime soon. BUT, plateau number listed above, 260,126,752 vaccines June 12th. Or, 569,587,888 vaccines late October. Which, figure would include I’d say half population 2nd dose late October. actually sound like agree almost completely. find masks annoying honestly kind triggering. severe health anxiety since small child, concept pandemic like basically actual worst nightmare come life, when. see people masked triggers anxiety. really unpleasant, but, tough out.

I issue people saying ""I like masks, miss seeing faces."" feel way. But, yesterday saw comment refer masks ""oppressive muzzles"" admit wearing mask improperly purpose. That's issue with. China seriously consider comedy show statements pandemic caused. Nobody unafraid Covid. extremely deadly. major sub since governments undoubtedly take advantage social media push agenda. I'd thought take longer, much, progress progress also likely larger underweight population, thanks Norman Borlaug far fewer people starving past. That's shame. Feel bad kids. Take whatever numbers China says. toss like 2 zeros back.  Plenty cities Earthquake zones (e.g. San Francisco) 

Cities also things might cause explosions (e.g. terrorists) US policy went like ""no need anything"" straight ""too late anything"". NRI hating fellow Indian good news India.


Oh man even start... It’s Pfizer developed vaccine. It’s BioNtech. Don’t people call Pfizer. It’s ridiculous. Minister Jacinda Ardern told Morning Report confirms right taking precautionary approach moving alert levels, considering variant infectious. also know based sequencing able link cases we've come managed isolation facilities tells us unlikely, therefore, form issue managed isolation.""  said couple scenarios would investigated today: One possibility virus came transit passenger, another one came international aircrew. cases, crew uniforms cleaned place one people tested positive works. Experts say appear cases reported world transmission occurred laundry, said. Like flu... oh wait didn't. I’m sorry ridiculously damaging calculated risk, like basically everywhere Europe. You’re ruining futures widening gap middle, lower upperclass. actually super easy. need bureaucratic pixie dust. BTW, im scientist, understand scientific method. also understand burden proof form non-fallacious arguments. clearly can't either these, take issue you. doubt knowledge, argument. remember said 1 died. 2.600,000 people. search source. prices already insane. drive SC, 3 hour round trip save money buy two bottles something. That’s federal government means talks reopening, 0 chance Biden administration push end mask distancing schools late 2021-2022 it’s complete waste time demand Meanwhile Oregon, teachers offered vaccine 65. Disgraceful. China's harsh response outbreak best response. time examine roots virus praising China locked strictly tested whole cities. 

Sure, city administrator's first impulse attack doctors trying figure going many mistakes made many leaders around world.

Trump's epidemic mask denialism killed twice many Americans would otherwise died mediocre response Canada. Boris Johnson's slow lockdown killed twice many UK citizens would died locked one week earlier, according epidemiologist.

There's plenty learn future epidemics. vaccinate children? Here's know. 1 shot next one scheduled March. Told vaccine would effective 10 days 2nd shot.

Then, I'll continue things since last March. Mask up, distance, work home.

Then I'll follow local news stats (cases, deaths, # vaccines).

Then see stats like, may begin venturing necessary stuff then.

So basically, I'll lifestyle changes virus control local stats proof. Like kids car, no, we're yet.

There still lot know. I'll let statistics speak themselves. variants popping up, know know numbers lie. doesn't, still believe true. Good thing comment nothing then. like people looking reason hate everyone everything.  Hopefully moderna good failure republican run government failed one term president Trump spreading constant disinformation. Anyone surprised? become colloquialism big Tech That's true anything though. That's people. masks, would something else people would dividing over. see lockdowns, personal risk assessments pandemic, hell even pandemic, people divide anything everything.

This also disregards actual studies show benefits mask wearing respiratory pandemic. Just, entertain second. masks work, part PPE hospital settings? surgeon wear mask operating room. may say, protect patient, we've asked better part year now? Protect people? need CCP that. r/india would soon. Thank president trump! Nothing nature really 100% lol Translation:-

Yeah spent summer India Thailand... 3 months got used seeing fat people... like weeks would go didn’t see single person gut.

Flying back US landing Dallas learned meant told “the real culture shock come home”. Idiocy sounds exculpatory ignorance. Idiocy means ""it's fault they're dumb"" whereas ignorance means ""they nescient culpable negligence"". thinks J&amp;J vaccine eventual big stick crushes COVID developing world. India population vaccinate also provide lot doses hard limits. Russia. China. EU/UK. 

Meanwhile J&amp;J vaccine come online Moderna/Pfizer's vaccines already made massive dent U.S. vaccinations. brutally honest. Many Americans sick tired Covid lock bullshit. Enough enough. unable attend Cubs game Wrigley Field last Summer!! sacrificing future generations extend life 80yr 90yr olds? worth it.

US July. dates seem pretty optimistic, especially considering UK hasn’t even started dose 2 yet.  think leadership needs honest help.

Walking around grocery store fifteen minutes probably help lot keeping sick cloud contained smaller area.

Sitting office day, can't see help. air go somewhere gets pulled around HVAC fans.

Outdoors completely stupid. everyone walking around outside alone masks completely beyond me. Yeh shit, they're even trying make look like virus originated Italy. 

Their propagnda work released data. Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. don’t trust India, enjoy taking literally pharmaceuticals life (hint: made India). Bidens done fuck loan Trump has. Amazing Biden done three weeks. F*CK Trump Administration. matters truth virus vaccine matters. lockdowns. still Maine. see rushing take away honestly. Yeah I'm thinking go super low right away: young folk spread cause more, younger masses get vaccinated April May. warmer weather it'll harder convince people patient starting 1-2 months (myself included). maybe theres good amount immunity populations anyway.

But hospitalizations deaths hit rock bottom, would amazing, see good chance happening. Indians hate Modi. brought power. saying already infected need one shot actually need zero?

Why dont 18s need vaccinated? that. No. don’t need wait. self-centered comment is. Canada list? Canada doesn’t even manufacture vaccines... link source? don’t believe you, want read context

And ok yeah, boil vaccines, “enough people” vaccinated “few months” metrics clearly defined not

Why, why, would wearing masks 2022 expect enough doses fully vaccinate every American July Ask Stalin. Many PCPs part larger healthcare systems must use captive lab. one single antibody test available them. spoke specifically PCP test could offer seem work well spike protein. doctor order one specific spike antibodies would work mine cannot I’ve supported school opening since start. issues district need help. process streamlined places people can't even figure sign appointment. states using vams, aren't. Florida high risk people lining doses going getting reported, federal government still trying figure 20 million doses went.

The process putting arms don’t need vaccinated everyone. Already infected people &lt;18 year olds don’t need vaccinated. major problem vaccine: haven’t yet! comment asking Wuhans successful lockdown, wrote reply, comment deleted. I’m posting reply anyway case it’s helpful.

No reasons worked. 

China Wuhan realized physical lockdown keeping people home sufficient.

They created government controlled places anyone tested positive would sent regardless symptoms. used hotels, dorms created spaces monitored carefully none left. tested positive go one locations. didn’t test positive symptom like fever cough, sent one locations isolation.

Of course seriously ill patients hospitalized, realized asymptomatic transmission high. 

So anyone positive even symptoms separated anyone could infect. kept negative test results.

China even enforced places requiring pharmacists report anyone bought cough medicine medicine keeping fevers low like aspirin. purchases made app, people easy identify trace.

So, basically China went big step farther western countries repeated mass testing isolating anyone positive test symptoms. mom 61 teaching person worry since also conditions. worried pregnant I'm not, feel ok long wear KF94. I'm fine waiting elderly high risk conditions get first, think priority alongside workers need work person rest general population, long getting one still issue.

Imma start smoking gain weight become obese. xD reality, dislikes coming from? wanna get vaccinated D: problem, discuss therapist monthly wait minute, calling people cautious new vaccine idiot? I'm allergic everything long way idiot. I'm taking even able take would cautious long term side effects. Coming person chronic health issues worst thing medical professional say is, ""the benefit outweigh risks"" boom get worst reactions. personally refused experiment moving forward. time that. Ha ha ha get it? Cause they're dead! Lololol epic pwn fortnite default dance. Interesting! wonder area vaccine supply Iirc, 100% effective keeping people get infected severe case. Omg ... I’m sick bad news..... can’t catch break -.- appreciate explanation, thanks.  That’s 1,170 case dismissed universal way. believe that? Nobody, tweet popularized ""evidence"" China ""covering up"" H2H transmission. horribly wrong lying order deflect blame inadequate response, result millions people around world misled including yourself. live Portland suburb. flew hometown visit family early/mid December 2019, sick dog whole time gone. He’s type get sick, passing floor every day hours time. Worth noting work Japanese company decent amount travel back forth states, office every day. masks point course. I’ve told even though seems unlikely, think back then, got March take care me, masks either us (they hadn’t arrived yet), didn’t catch me. Please explain gun reform affects Covid. comment reads like alt wet dream. Come back reality dude CA detailed plan terms businesses schools open etc., lifting mask mandate nowhere radar anywhere. Welp, guess die something. Nothing could do. Oh well. 

-/u/InThePartsBin2 ass backwards misread. 

You like terrified 24 hours day? Keep you’re doing.

COVID fact life. way make go away, even you’re vaccinated, always going us. 

Yes bad grandma gets it. Yes worry natural human tendency. Worry also happens shorten life, point I’m trying make.

I don’t see worrying helps guy grandma.

Resisting reality completely futile get nowhere. Ah see. don’t think us peaons really know came from. might never know. point, sure helpful pointing blame help curb whatever practices caused this, possible. Apologies say anyone died that’s taken vaccine? 

So made explicitly clear me. People die vaccine vaccinate entire planet. sorry people want confront that's assumed result. 1 3 million sounds right kind risk. evidence suggests link, that's great! don’t think variants showed now. They’ve spreading US least months, it’s important continue try minimize spread much possible. It’s great cases hospitalizations going need make sure continues. Dose 2 5 hours ago, dead yet. Hoping die tonight tomorrow, either.  I'd really like get back going concerts really neat dungeon club Hollywood, though, vaccination is! Vaccinate world. not?  obstacles? You’re literally highlighting evidence suggests vaccines safe. try vaccinate 7 billion people, bound complications, especially amongst oldest sickest us. Israel nearing 50% vaccinated. country process exiting third lockdown. Next week plan open commerce people vaccinated (stores, malls, gyms, museums events). admit get certain sad amusement fact hardcore anti-mask types probably fly rage every time flip channels hospital drama doctors wearing mask. media get clicks experts daily tv time. 100% toxic hellhole kind understand vaccines together. mean problem wealth gap different member states. Germany France example would much better place secure doses could potentially left poorer member states like say Romania etc potentially left exactly bode well unity EU. would vaccine nationalism within EU Exactly, Perù, Ecuador, Bolivia Mexico would still higher Russia  reduce chances getting it, got Pfizer vaccine haven’t gotten it. study analyzed 1.2 million Clalit members, including 600,000 received Pfizer vaccine 600,000 not. inoculated group produced 94 percent fewer symptomatic COVID-19 cases, 92 percent fewer cases serious illness.

questions

-what ""94% fewer"" mean? group 1 100 symptomatic cases group 2 6 cases? missing numbers here

- ""fewer symptomatic cases"" ""fewer cases"", right? vaccine hinder spreading?

- study? published journal? I’m sure you’re understanding results survey - it’s (unfortunately) clear 60% Americans motivated get vaccinated. Outside healthcare workers, US institutions won’t enforce vaccinations, there’s lot ground need make convincing 40% Uzbekistan Kazakhstan Guy replying seemed bit unconcerned people pandemic affect, rather affecting them. kind of, ""fuck got mine"" approach. said anything Trump? article main link says didn’t find antibodies 67 92 patients suspected Covid Wuhan November December 2019, say still consistent theory antibodies might last long. American antibodies last long Chinese ones not? Expanding upon two commenters: 

because logistics short life-span vaccine, deep freezing, coupled dab inexperience, vaccination centers ended hundreds doses given thrown away. 

Sometimes they'd invite family friends, anyone lives close come hurry, even eligible time according guidelines. I'm talking dozens hundreds people center, every day. 
Also, safe assume people lied healthcare personnel. 

No matter way got vaccine, data registered ministery health and/or healthcare provider, (unless black market kind deal guess, I'm describing wasn't) I've seen article long time ago remember posting subreddit. Chinabots downvoted post anything related origin virus China. Distancing goes masks.

I say another 2-3 months max give even illusion social distancing. World mixed now.. people everywhere working everywhere. Also China invested half world new silk road thing. Cant wait cookie monster variant You’re big boy, get it. support upwards half billion towards COVAX Maybe limit knowledge virus tweet popularized didnt mean software eng = medicine, rather think would objective people. Yeah, two working parents working home whole time, honestly angers me. idea get vaccine :( I’d still wait parents get it. 

I agree able worked high risk teachers CDL. problem relies bit group effort, younger healthier people go allow others truly risk home. know many people (not teachers) jumped vaccine line either technicality plain lying even though young work home, I’ve lost faith humanity :( yeah take time getting vaccines done better job controlling community spread. don’t know fact spreading northern Italy September 2019. report generally ridiculed 11% people COVID increase hospitalisation excess death Impossible. likely theories false positives common colds.  
Also impossible originated Europe one ever found SARS bat population. it’s found many times China. pangolins intermediate host near non existent Europe, especially Italy. China? They’re packed tightly together food source. Impossible, millions infections would resulted massive comas/death cases too. even wishful thinking. People acting like amount cases could go forever ridiculous. We’re definitely point heard immunity. point can’t infect anyone comes contact meh, could've bought bitcoin gme. think really easy say things like hindsight maybe easy u say. fair, lot people ""stay home forever"" train really arguing good faith. stopping virus them, keeping ""new normal"" lifestyle lifestyle pre-pandemic social outcasts it. 

There's difference wanting exercise caution move back normal, digging heels saying can't ever go back seeing one another.

We need realization lifestyle bizzare, unnatural..and must temporary. person worked airport. imagine sort contact transiting passenger likely. Officials said mother works catering company laundry airlines, officials investigating whether link infected passengers. Officials said woman hadn’t going aboard planes herself. There's lot kneejerk reactions even slightest inclination wear mask ever post COVID, even alternative coughing spreading common cold/flu public spaces, seems they'd rather occur ever see another mask life. left local subreddits unfollowed local/national news. places toxic everything covid-related think/hope improve morale next little while. There's YouTube travel vlogger called bald bankrupt went offline revealed caught covid Russia height pandemic. got bad way required hospitalisation, required contacts hospitals already turning people away.

He made video later removed it. I'm guessing either Russia made remove wanted suppress bad was, able get hospital bed way did. Obviously Russia would get bad press famous travel vlogger died covid Russia hospitals full.

The video re-uploaded areas online people wanted watch it. talks whole ordeal. I’m curious actually read article posted? hypocrite Nope 😂 I’m even considered high risk. live Israel. Got leftover dose. understand people victim blaming you. legit worried grandmother, directly affects you. like said ""that dude punched face!"" people responded ""Breathe let go, control people's actions. hold onto pain nose, go get checked out."" Ooooooooooooooh scary They’re talking severe illness related Covid infection, side effects vaccine. 50 million+ vaccines given, starting oldest portions population.

Of course people died. 

This garbage. Twitter go way Blockbuster, horrible place. deleted account past Spring happier without seeing everyday U.S., Centers Disease Control Prevention said Feb. 7, 1,170 reported deaths among people received either Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine another Moderna Inc., rate 0.003%, evidence suggests link. No, passive recommendation, active strategy. 

We locus concern control. 

Locus concern things impact us. pandemic, economy, friends family. nothing control things locus concern.

Locus control things within environment actually effects produce results better lives. going locus control. Saving money working job, locus control. Mask wearing, locus control. 

You actually label Things stress one two. it’s locus concern locus control, there’s nothing don’t worry move on.

That, slowly go insane. Nice, assume work health care? CDC says you’re fully vaccinated exposed covid literally doesn’t matter, quarantine anything worry about.  Canadian think Trudeau said day they'll getting doses delivered 2nd quarter originally planned. that's true hopefully significantly ramp speed vaccinations offer every Canadian vaccine September.

We've seen UK US decent amount supply daily vaccinations significantly ramped quite easily. isnt fully true, girlfriend Pfizer jab town hall setting. saying Fauci, Birx, Redfield, scientists didn’t get sidelined? well documented. 

Could provide documentation policy recommendations you’re referring defend Trump matter day?

This federal government’s response covid.  Stay topic let turn hate filled rage even going bother rest since N95 mask shortage well documented. 

And provided actual policies implemented early March April federal government curb shortage showing claim incorrect.

There really isn’t anything argue clearly enough; 

Are changing argument nothing done several months enough mask makers nothing don’t actually contract material makers also (meltblown fabric). production good supply chain.

You’re desperately grasping point simply wrong Eve though showed clue talking obvious you’re trying defend U.S. response strange partisan loyalty previous administration. 

It’s obvious you’re trying attack U.S. response strange partisan hatred previous administration. 


See medical supply shortage well documented across entire United States. 

I didn’t say wasn’t shortage. That’s what’s going happen global pandemic hits. I’m calling uninformed claim government failed address N95 mask shortage several play blind party loyalty, 

What try play off? showed based post history probably true.

So, done even trying argue something shown wrong about.. Also age pyramid. Somalis manage get old enough Covid risk must resistant *a lot* stuff. 50+million americans got vaccine, 1000 people 50million would die of: heart attack, stroke etc. anything vaccine, clear agenda, looking post history Vaccinated people catching covid well, idk 😬 Fuck facts, right?  tested 67 92 suspected November/December cases antibodies found none any, test known early Covid cases antibodies? mean yeah, surprising. pretty disturbing people would willingly bring another soul dystopic world currently live. actually encouraging news. First, paid lot money early guaranteed doses, many countries didn't, even enough doses hand.

Second, everybody required member one four health insurance companies company scheduled members. US disorganized patchwork networks administering vaccine. A) US vaccine issues, especially compared Western Europe East Asia. B) headline literally saying ""Yeah hungry kids US wait see what's happening Africa."" 130 countries totally lacking cash resources vaccinate people. tangentially related coronavirus. usually implement wage subsidy employers keep paying employees. worked really well payments happened day application. Please liberate us crazies, Euro bros. Conspiracy nuts said year ago. 

From on, vaccinated individuals citizens. cases superbowl Sunday accounted yet? Question. happens people’s jobs lockdowns? get jobs back? businesses shutdown good? 18”-2’ snow. actually insulates. 

This makes think maybe insulating undercarriage own. Buy make skirt kind RV. amazed much helps. bet new conspiracy theory claiming libs deliberately faked cases trump loses gradually stop make Biden look good. B117 cause surge regions. prevalence doubling week California Southern Florida 5% 10%, respectively. trend continues follow UK, Irish, Portuguese trajectories, B117 become dominant month regions. 


With relaxation social distancing Americans gradually dropping guard good news, new surge seems almost inevitable even aggressive vaccination campaign. IHME -- others -- updated projections regions reflect upcoming surge. 

Vaccines help past infections. make last surge (which I'm hoping smaller, hope strategy), think we'll great shape gradually return normal. sucks eventually drop cases stop. 70k average? 50? 20? one knows, enough community immunity decreasing numbers *never* decrease. yet anyway. Hope too! Thanks update  said words. sub drastically changed. precautionary information here, usually, downvoted. Suspicious. one brought 33%. one stats. instead seems like nothing except feelings. sad.  article: “the reported decrease viral loads vaccinated people small compared range viral levels experts seen COVID-19 patients”

Translation: vaccinated superspreaders still superspreaders, won’t symptoms know sick. Vaccinating everyone blindly much faster. let perfect enemy good. Meanwhile Canada grinding suffocating halt ordered Covid test - negative nasal swab. spit test confirm - confirmed negative. 

I truly hope version virus. excited get vaccine, can. *Coughing intensifies* comical little understand real facts calling China dubious. Would still worry quarantine not? I’m mood authentic^^TM London Fish &amp; Chips. Yep started open last week...... Going fun! need new haka we're go level 3 less 33% YouTube game. learn anything YouTube. never said one friend. arent testing antibodies enough. would give lot perspective alongside regular testing.

 lets vaccinate everyone blindly. bit late party similar symptoms toes nothing else. Curious hear latest results were. Thanks! Lmao We’re hosed perspective numbers, good ways still. 🤞 No. general position ever argued otherwise. Trump year lol perfect example poor leadership! truly hope people live smarter that! charged manslaughter every single person dies coronavirus due stupidity! right, misremembered.   Wrong, wrong, one thousand times wrong. 

Stop normalizing masks distancing. wholly fucked core. click link. click prior article. least light end tunnel  people, where? USA &amp;UK, constitute whole world. investor class flush cash nowhere put it. would let run rampant community, immunity, could shut one city days? Right?

I could've running like 100 degree fever noticed I'm perpetually worn I'm inside drafty house brutal cold front 95% statistic mRNA vaccines refer vaccine's ability prevent severe Covid, refers abillity prevent level symptomatic Covid. Exactly. Glad said. long term effects covid still unknown. something actively worry about. I’ve hugging friends family (who want it) throughout pandemic. brief hug actually risky? kiss see risky, one two second hug doesn’t seem like big deal. Hmm yeah maybe phrasing wasn’t good.

Anyway good job NZ far, think country key example history books. Guess shut works forever then! Silly American. US spends little foreign aid compared size economy population. Much give ""military aid"", i.e. giving poor countries money buy military equipment, ideally US arms manufacturers. Hooray military-industrial-Congressional complex.

That said, foreign aid investment, often good one. often cheaper help defuse bomb let hope so. trend grim, I've already lost couple family members. Honestly, guys knocking park vaccinations, continuing ramp vaccinations!

Despite Trump's fumbling mismanagement, US world leader pandemic preparedness, vaccination numbers part legacy.

The risk would see US-centric. whole world vaccinated, matter time next Variant emerge. Currently, US vaccination rates combination large domestic US vaccine manufacturing capacity combined Executive Order stopping vaccine exports domestic US demand met¹.

Once per capita total cases begin drop low enough, probably time also start allowing exports. Ultimately, would best assist programs like Covax help get vaccine developing countries.

I'm actually pretty confident guys got now, matter following completion.

---

¹ going throw comment, Canadian, guys kind f*cked us that. country per capita doses pre-ordered country. pre-order dollars went expanding production capacity, places like Pfizer facility Kalamazoo, MI. Instead Pfizer supplying us Puurs, plant, expansion moved cover.

As long EU keeps allowing vaccine exports… still, vaccine always good, matter gets dose first. curious, this, regular bar actually shook long? I’ve made home times prescribed way ordered fancy club vintage cocktail menu, didn’t take long come still tasted right. It’s control, get 3 days see far it’s spread! isn’t first rodeo! Testing antibodies takes days... minutes... everyone would come get tested antibodies come 3-4 days later get vaccine much extra effort... president take shot coup.

Half country would still vote him, ideals far gone. see downvote thread, isolationism pretty damn popular stance America, ifit come expense ever was. 

Actually, clear downward trend, worrisome. We're far status quo claiming.

The world need stand united many issues, last thing need nations playing alone corner. That's Russia China would want anyway. lagged probably calm could maybe homes cost much hmmm crazy 3 days intensive contact tracing testing school. World class track trace? problems.

I still work tho!  will, counties still mandating masks. selfish fuck, stay are. It’s naming impact uk. would here? election cured Covid. test antibodies. fan lifting mask mandate soon, ridiculous. Probably .5% catch die small portion lasting effects. around 140-224 million people US already virus another 38 million people gotten vaccine dose. weather actually gotten worse. California went 12k 10k five days thick winter number daily cases decreasing rapidly. would suspect things warm spending time outdoors becomes viable option, we’ll see cases drop even further.


Or increase people want go “normal life” go large gatherings again. Natural immunity go away (people gotten re-infected) may true vaccine immunity (but don’t data yet).

Right may dip people weren’t wearing masks weren’t distancing got sick virus ran population. immunity least period time.

But also seeing new variants, changes calculations.  Uhh yes? That’s we’ve lived past four months restriction free. aren’t throwing away whats ADE? Ok ben Can’t disclose much details, Deep South. county better 80% rest state still caution air. Lol cannot claim safe go bowling alley unmasked people that’s contradiction. Unless quarantine 7 days plus test afterwards putting household risk. Facts don’t care feelings. true course, stopped worrying zombies bit you. Agreed. buy ""4th wave"" stuff. Osterholm quack says lots speculative things.  America great think. Deal it. city huge, love it! rhinoviruses believe People want zero COVID understand humans virus oddly enough
Firstly, virus infect animals, unless find vaccines them, good luck getting rid COVID.

But big point want make 2nd lockdown (3rd right now) 4 months Melbourne. Want went though, seeing two weeks two weeks.,The dumb 1% setting back week times, absolutely disconnect felt school work. goalposts moved right infront us. felt like gonna end life stuck 3 weeks 15 cases get 5 average week. 

No, don’t think Zero COVID gonna work work like way it. feel sick every time remember awful scary times were. wasn’t living then. surviving. Seeing Zero COVID suggested makes feel angry scared. almost like making people work year giving financial support horrible idea. seem kind variant there, study specific immune vulnerability. great study shows populations target: type blood, women, history proven infection, relatively lower IgG thereafter. 

It's urgent get enough people study group, start protect better, also identify immune response poor. someone rural countryside community, move away employment opportunities paying minimum wage. like was, think little browser based now.
It works me, guess depends set compatible systems.

I running low, using gpu power hogging computer. Yes that’s true would rather use reported number give estimations someone. 

I also don’t know I’d use word “only” 30 million, that’s still 10% total population lol Americans dying vaccines? What? good documentary give closeup dire situations people living in. Must gotten much worse Republicans terrorist traitors america. guys 300 fucking thousand cases day, madness even think absurd number... Also, first wave hit nursing homes hardest residents account huge chunk deaths. may right. I’ve read experts don’t really expect see effects vaccinations March. Maybe little sooner increased vaccination rates. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Another thing quickly newer (mRna) vaccines created. figure kill weaken virus still getting immune response. need millions eggs grow viruses. 

I believe vaccine dna sequence within days. (Obviously scale). right amazing me. 

Also similar last person's response, also stacked various phases vaccine running parallel. Normally take risk, havok created trade deemed worth while. north 277. Basically tent city would, client total shit PC appear work. Well, they’d still catch 80% colds rhinovirus enterovirus. believe corona viruses responsible many severe colds. previous winter worse though even Florida bc wild west long time. ...

It’s crazy people still this, dousing food homemade bleach cocktails spraying isopropanol alcohol. mean, made sense start unknowns it’s documented food surface transmission incredible rare comparable real world True, passing 100k much better way way up. Almost women HCW Type episodes tended severe, one fatal infection.

If study valid, women type blood might consider taking highest precautions avoid exposure, least vaccinated variants (if becomes possible). Organizations identify HCW get harm's way.

Are patients also increased risk communicating virus patients, based less efficacious immune response (decreased IgG)?

How soon common factor vulnerability ascertained, wonder, identified screening, potentially targeted therapeutics? Yes let's of...idiotic reasons. People already going large gatherings, spring hits they'll least outside lot data. Interpreting data interpretation pass scrutiny peer review next step. Here’s theory... COVID engineered government knows something far worse, 100% death rate, coming soon. Thing is, vaccine COVID provide protection new virus unvaccinated die. Oh, new virus alien nature. thought would able take planet population ravaged enough get COVID vaccine, avoid that. make even worse, democrats working league aliens. It’s virtue patriots still left government vaccines distributed. Bigfoot somehow involved.

Pass around. Quick ;) Yeah downward trend natural immunity science knows what’s up, prepared whole versus new strains/mutations. I’m arguing right! understand we’re urgent vaccine.  hometown cheapest location country. local jobs reflect little beyond minimum wage farm jobs. 

Even then, farmers prefer target vulnerable foreigners pay even less. city folk love retire country, severely driving housing costs. Unless becomes endemic never drops zero cases unique year round. people inside = virus spread guys lockdown &lt;20 cases, celebrating daily new cases nearing 1000.


You guys right.

Speaking which, worked Melbourne like two months, can't wait go back ohhh nooooo. sad /s Yep - AZ supplies per week ~2x Pfizer now, heading 4x. isn't. weather cycle. ""nature"" behave according many homeless people are. going down? really depends. lot people indeed struggling really hard pandemic also large group people bunch money sitting sidelines result. I’m talking rich either. Middle class people able keep jobs and/or WFH haven’t spending money normally would going dinner, going vacation, going bars, going sporting events concerts, etc. lot money people accumulating would normally spent.

22 million jobs lost lot, 155 million jobs US 2019. 85% people close income far less places spend it. situation changes less restrictions recklessness.

cases also going states plenty reckless people little/no restrictions remember that. way saw it, shit really hit fan once, least North America. NBA shutting down, NHL shutting down, Tom hanks getting COVID, think really shifted view COVID potential issue full-on crisis lot people, once. 1. already earn money contract manufacturer Pfizer;
2. Research expensive. reason governments healthcare providers choose product Pfizer whoever, unlikely see return investment. Given delays developing product far, simply getting market enough, would therefore expect aspect believe advantage competition, i.e., IP valuable. Full circle would US need EU vaccines lol? Hey! someone mention Florida's governor, Ron ""schools close second time watch"" Desantis? Almost half cases state woooo. hate Bible belt Australia one vaccinated. We’re taking slow small cases.... went lockdown Melbourne 😭 live busiest land border crossing Western hemisphere. Even Covid ""closures"" literally 10s thousands people crossing every day.

Our county-run vaccination centers officially giving people live Mexico show they're employed US.

Anything else make sense. Came thinking comments would removed, wrong. problem discussed earlier context Canadian snowbirds flying Florida get vaccine. personally it, state chooses allow monetary reasons, that's decision. weird 100k scary approaching it, we're approaching side, good. 

Dear god, pandemic depressing. 

Wear masks, wash hands, isolate, get vaccines, people! got this! people would rather live life risk catching covid free so.

If scared covid stay home want, mean rest us to.

Take care. agree US likely going happens. Keep mind US much immunity naturally spread UK strain UK it. UK 7% people antibodies October thereabouts recall correctly. US already getting strain instead 7% immunity around 30%, that's going substantially cut impact new strain compared seen elsewhere. point virus going gone months one way another US. back normal June July. know lot people saying concerts going come back actually think cases go basically nothing could happen last minute least sense it.

The UK strain probably cause quick fairly bad spike Florida possibly California gone month. don’t think understand post. I’m completely vaccines. I’m confused. couldn’t make obvious pro vaccine. Yh hard anti vaxxers believe Bill Gates tracking us vaccines cause autism there's changing minds they're dead set. 

But honestly think they're vocal minority. Alot ones I've come across real life atleast tend skeptical vaccines example they're new vaccines rather necessarily hard anti vaxxer. Like people mum knows originally said going get vaccine new safety concerns etc. end ended taking saw others real side effects. doctors supposed training relationship coronavirus zinc/vitamin C studies exist? hopeful, I'm ignoring situation. 95% effectiveness preventing *symptomatic* infection among 16 older great! get mine asap. trouble several major issues disease still almost entirely ignored we're stuck dealing immediate threat. young kids, life still unlikely return normal several months. one 2 minutes me. horrible, I'd never travel two minutes get it. missing? something tried that's really good? mean liability shifts Gianforte removing safety?  say real scientific angle. 

I feel it’s different battle ground COVID United States. Society relatively open spread constant, variant could fall line speak . spike wrecking ball locked countries get . it’s boiled it’s COVID. new strain becomes dominant it’s COVID 19 ... Saw video recently family U.K. trying argue release elderly relative I.C.U. ward claims vit c zinc effective respiratory illnesses. Poor NHS worker trying tell gets taken vent drop dead moment o2 saturation low 80s. please spread anti-vax messages. I'm sorry loss. Iowa ridiculously small population South Korea surpassed number deaths per population total number deaths. information Jun 2020.

Lockdowns proven nearly similar not. 

Follow science. refund property taxes schools haven’t reopened yet. ""go cups"" SE Louisiana. areas don't. Well going issue people pretty good immunity perfect. seems 80 90% immunity terms preventing reinfection relative sense. Also virus need one shot. Furthermore, people get sense virus probably get vaccine least based people know it. say f vaccine I'm safe probably least reasonably so. don’t think race really anything bigot boy  seen underground parties shut NYC? young black people. masks.

bit hypocritical say nothing race call black ppl parties shut down. One issue yet standard way verify person vaccinated. get really high rates makes sense lot venues, airlines, etc keep mask requirements know vaccinated not.

You could relax things sooner vaccination status linked state ID something Americans conspiracy-y bunch see working out.  does, 2 weeks spend 3 months there. 2 weeks next place, stay 5 months etc. Unless you’re paying quarantine (which know)? Yes ongoing afaik, recommend follow Dysautonomia International always research updates about, yeah. many summer? Probably fact ~40 million flu cases year ""long flu"" commonly known thing. US government spend 2.5 billion moderna vaccine. spend anything BioNtech/Pfizer vaccine.

Yes true. US also funded majority J&amp;J, Novavax along UK AZ/Oxford. even Sanofi though biggest producers China, India Russia.

Yes AZ Sanofi fumbled development/production. supposed mass produced vaccines.  need rest drive must embarrass state selfish bullshit I've heard ton vitamin D. first I've heard C even suggested. See, inadvertently pinpointed issue here: Republicans single issue voters democrats varying opinions. Democrats disagree policy ""in-fighting"" really nuanced political disagreement. Republicans think voting democrats quite literally favor killing babies amount logic fact convince otherwise. virus body beneficial.

The last thing read viral load/burden increased:

[Increased infections, viral burden, new SARS-CoV-2 came late-Dec/early-Jan suggestions increase viral load (which preprint references). new information increased viral load? Amazon isn’t Silicon Valley company. founded Bellevue, Washington suburb Seattle. Thanks I've heard claim work fb conspiracy nuts. Who'd thought doctors training could correct? people fucking stupid?

It's piece goddamn fabric, wear fucks sake. anything you, quit acting like fucking child. anti-mask morons, maybe US would better place. get many cell get landline. get call blocker landline, cell carriers won’t anything seriously address problem. Statistics side rural areas wearing masks relative urban areas. Urban areas wear masks 4x rate. 
 another beginnings widespread vaccine roll way that. There's lot hopefull about. Vitamin C might help sepsis though, still say reporter body slammed shot How's boot taste? think even then, concern quarantine country Southeast Asia. Two weeks per country really adds up. People talking whole time. never heard C big deal. Still taking supplements regardless. trickle-down effect billions corpo bailouts coming second now... It’s data says regarding spread. young healthy people start getting vaxxed, daily case numbers plummet shortly assuming major variant/mutant hiccups. That’s bullshit. idea phone companies can’t tell difference VoIP, cell “ground” lines laughable. profiting spam calls won’t stop them. mentioned conversation yesterday. like overnight change. used ""good news"" met anger downvotes. Almost night seems like shifted to, ""Hurray! Things back normal weeks!"" Glad I'm one. real, knew fucked saw memorial day weekend last year still pandemic since enough population immunity yet (but getting closer). 

Once significant community spread US, chance eradicating virus. realistic amount restrictions would changed that.

People giving lives year already. blame thinking given enough. Millions people given lot couple holidays, holier-than-thou ""*humanity* selfish stupid"" shtick getting old. acting like everything world would A-OK darn people celebrating birthday barbeque ridiculous. Hahaha good one 😂 get 2 long Island slushies time drive past. Get nice drunk like 7 dollars.  best friend husband got second shot last week. invited another mutual friend got 2nd vaccine 2 weeks ago friend still wanted hang outside mask. wouldn’t even use bathroom held Pee. strange, even get vaccine? friend lied get vaccine early (does qualify yet) doesn’t work, still going crazy even vaccinated adults? key actually eradicating MERS, eliminating human populations, going effective vaccine camels. pancoronavirus vaccine works animals, yes it. Polis seems good governor UNICEF secured billion vaccine doses, last time heard. yes. still believe extremely dumb rich countries handing poorer countries, even reaching herd-immunity rich country first.

Look india example. They've starting donate vaccine poorer countries around world, find beautiful. respect generosity. would still expect save people first, giving away Yes governor also. lucky mostly able work remotely except hours day work day. However change shortly recalled completely office.

I'm scared work situations like restaurants, bars grocery. friends working businesses.

Compares upcoming hurricane. I’ve listening podcast since last summer. He’s pretty accurate far. don’t let guard early I’m saying. safe enough vaccines secured everyone July. they'll produced. Might still take bit longer get people's arms. think, barring production set backs new variants vaccines can't handle, everyone wants vaccinated able get early September latest, probably sooner. Nucleocapsid vaccines may actually produce SARS experience taught us lot extremely useful lessons, turned out. SARS-Cov-2 rather closely related 2003 SARS coronavirus, you’re going worldwide pandemic, you’re far better one that’s much like something you’ve already poured R&amp;D investments into! case, two big take-homes coronavirus vaccines could indeed suffer ADE, seemed depend protein chose base vaccine around. Specifically, vaccines targeted N (nucleoprotein) antigen coronavirus ADE problems, ones targeted (Spike) protein not. experience thoroughly taken heart vaccine developments last year: one, best knowledge, even bothered target SARS-Cov-2 N protein all, reason. look antibodies generated people who’ve infected virus, certainly make N-targeting ones, along Spike-targeting ones antibodies directed various ORF proteins. vaccine work, everyone stuck smart may figure get N protein vaccine pancoronavirus generate ADE disease, process definitely lot harder dropping N protein mRNA one vaccines have. Based Federal Reserve paying interest, buy 9 trillion dollars worth junk bullshit prop up, rich people nothing better buy stocks. 

If Fed paid interest, bank accounts would actually make money. used happen back Boomer land. 1980s, savings accounts paid 10 12 percent per year. Housing prices low mortgages cost 16 18 percent year. 

Today, savings account pays .12 percent, mortgages cost 2% interest... savings accounts worthless housing prices high. money stock market, damn thing gains money, losing money asset inflation. 

So everyone buys crypto stocks response. Fed raises interest rates, market crash. 

Also housing collapses due evictions market collapse. that? Nope. Right . obvious. saw happening Japan also . lot people living cars . guess it’s happening everywhere, cost living high . Lmao, TN worry personal responsibility. worry might get voted seen ""mandating"" anything. solution would nice grocery store worker cant afford road trip. risk least likely expendable cash seek alternative solutions.

I'm 16 days shot 1 Moderna. answer received 80% effacy two weeks out. I'm huge fan KKK lower average life expectancy. recommendation frankly, lot time people likely get sick COVID aren’t mentally capable making good decisions. Therefore, government act like nanny since people can’t trusted make decisions. That’s opinion. Maybe willingly accepted risk, need force others anything sure thing mate worrying, vaccines effective varient? want something really uplifting: situation reports finally good news graphs showing sharp drops new cases.  mean want others take first. people don’t drop dead, they’ll want too.

In words, people bunch chickens cowards. rate vaccines receiving meant sorry confusion.. canada continues get shorted vaccine delivery sucks.. too, tired every Reddit sub randomly infiltrated ""covid talk"". Like cute cat video, not? Lol Way many people get told oh ""it makes sick bit""

Immune response mean sick. 

There nothing vaccines approved America possible actually make sick. basically tricking Immune system turn on. That's thats happening.

I'm confused need separate passport. travel vaccines like Dengue Typhoid, mark little yellow booklet. nah, you’re implying freedom low/zero covid binary choice never was. don’t feeble minded. Right, guy responded said vaccine suppress symptoms, far know incorrect.  Give then! Okay. I’m glad kids’ teachers willing work. Every time cases pop somewhere, vaccinate / re-vaccinate everyone around block spread. Eventually, nowhere go. need completely exterminate like Smallpox mutates something far harmful like Spanish Flu virus did. vested interest making difficult possible schools open

Is corporate dystopian speak “they want stay alive”? mask requirements stay vaccination risk longer risk hospitals overwhelmed? makes 0 sense. whole point protect risk overwhelm hospitals. would continue wear masks, especially already vaccinated? logically make sense post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

And technically 25 BMI right start overweight, bit muscle, I’d imagine mine would 25 without.

OK, Texas pretty big population much way mountains. forget novovax, close well. Great. Newfoundland full lockdown variant. Yup. vaccines better anybody could possibly hoped for. immunity start building right away vaccination? find google takes several weeks build immunity, gradually build day? plans see parents 1 week vaccination, I'm wondering that's enough time build partial immunity. aren’t perfect, overall net good.

The focus influencing improve. happen country member. think past year proven opposite. soon government gives OK, people flock stores, restaurants, beaches, whatever. call selfish, call human.

### Abstract

Background: COVID-19 major health problem acute respiratory distress syndrome, saturation intensive care units (ICU) mortality. 


Methods: study aims elucidate effect calcifediol \[25(OH)D3\] treatment ICU admission mortality, patients admitted COVID-19 wards Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain. total 930 participants included. Participants (n=551) randomly assigned calcifediol treatment (532 ug day one 266 ug day 3, 7, 15, 30) time hospital admission controls (n=379). 


Findings: ICU assistance required 110 (11.8%) participants. 551 patients treated calcifediol admission, 30 (5.4%) required ICU, compared 80 379 controls (21.1%; p&lt;0.0001). Logistic regression calcifediol treatment ICU admission, adjusted age, gender, linearized 25(OH)D levels baseline, comorbidities showed treated patients reduced risk require ICU (RR 0.18 \[95% CI 0.11;0.29\]). Baseline 25(OH)D levels inversely correlated risk ICU admission (RR 0.53 \[95% CI 0.35;0.80\]). Overall mortality 10%. Intention-to-treat analysis, 36 (6.5%) 551 patients treated calcifediol admission died compared 57 patients (15%) 379 controls (p=0.001). Adjusted results showed reduced mortality 60%. Higher baseline 25(OH)D levels significantly associated decreased mortality (RR 0.40 \[95% CI 0.24;0.67\]). Age obesity also predictors mortality. 


Interpretation: patients hospitalized COVID-19, calcifediol treatment time hospitalization significantly reduced ICU admission mortality. 


Funding Statement: CIBERFES FIS (ISCIII), FEDER funds 


Declaration Interests: RB small lecture consultancy fees Fresenius (Germany), Abiogen (Italy), Faes Farma (Spain) Proctor &amp; Gamble (Belgium). authors declare competing interests. 


Ethics Approval Statement: study protocol approved ethics committee Parc de Salut Mar (Exp number 2020/9287). Man. What’s death toll going end this? Yeah that’s like virology urban legend. idea virus deadly can’t spread host dead. goes window pre symptomatic spread. Mutations random. It’s natural selection allows contagious variant become dominant. could deadly less deadly. long people spread feel fine that’s matters. Put band-aid mask part nose logic? said think swayed country's politics offering state facts world follow current issues.  Neither sub Yes, end year, latest. Without doubt. Holidays normal little worry. disbanded could also mention October 25th yesterday, could basically whatever fuck wanted. one city lockdown mentioned, rest country free since like mid-2020.

95%+ Australians would rather position America Europe, we’re chillin Covid smart stupid doctors. wish could give COVID job NHS. Maybe even replace Boris Covid. They're testing children ages 6-17. great news. mean, health problem independently wealthy, still sucks American. let corrupt administration family manage Trillions relief oversight “billions” skimming bucks top. really haven’t months right?

I don’t understand.... hear cases surged people aren’t following rules. you’re saying following rules that’s people aren’t dying? Fucking Montana. Hey us. us heads straight. get second shot Monday, I'll still masking avoiding crowded stores unmasked spreaders months more, see herd immunity bringing case count way down. Biden guy better thought. Feels good UK we're giving populism. No, lying myself. give hysteria big, bad government trying control us take freedom. confident everything rapidly going back normal, going send frenzy mask requirements linger bit get case counts. Nope, done lockdown fact you’re upset state isn’t threatening violent aggression fellow citizens enforce dress code? Yeah, I'm gonna closely watch news try see what's happening regards.

Admittedly, got bit burnt news government's handling kept date it. also hell bent getting Europe (Berlin me) soon hopefully can! They’re going too. see italian id given court Article says 14.5m first doses, still nearly 25% state it’s 68% percent people nursing homes died average age 82 mass.gov don’t think people going clubbing... lol real, every time love gun forget democrat now. matter party right bear arms always constitution. It’ll take vaccinate everyone types colds many different classes virus cause illnesses call “colds”. [This definitely unfettered capitalism producing vaccine, 

Additionally, rollout (i.e supply chain aspect) crucial production primarily done NHS &amp; army, private company free market. I'm anti-capitalist, deserving much credit regard light end tunnel speak of? current messaging least United States vaccines make meaningful impact daily lives. Even vaccinated, keep masks, distancing generally miserable, purgatory-esque existence indefinitely. gather vaccinated friends anyone else either.

I'm trying smart ass. genuinely want know cause optimism given current state affairs what's transpired past year so.  water vapor jet exhaust condensing -50°C mind control chemicals. world giant dinner plate Antarctica “lip” holding water in. US government brought twin towers thermite. 5G mobile data plot give cancer. moon landings Hollywood studio Funded by.... Well, like 5 state reps Covid, maybe cows afraid .... exhausting. You’re misreading it. poked around old portal find notes warnings deprecated, could you? could least pointed right direction instead making public statement two weeks later. businesses want mask mandate restaurants, bars, casinos think keeps state ""locked down"". Bunch dumb ass people want state tourist place. many business profit assholes want ruin state. amount sub divisions built everywhere reminds areas near grand parents California housing bubble. money forgetting state get -20 degrees winter tourist money dried half years causing businesses limit hours many avg employees. average family four make less 58k yr Greg wants outsiders buy land rent us, Greg worse governor MT history, Cuz one wears masks anyway whats point mandate. enforced past couple months. One night shut two restaurants wearing masks. unenforcable even mandate everyone doesnt follow it. understand too. We’re kind cornered district. window 2/6 2/16 notify district regarding chosen option kids’ schooling (in-person, virtual, home-based). district made clear choice made stand entire academic year. understand logistics them. wish would give us time choose. would much better idea stand able wait decision June. herd immunity set looks though vaccination rate outpaced variant transmissions, would comfortable choosing in-person option without vaccinated. much Europe (it varies country), fairly strong mask rules. business closures hospitality entertainment. Church services permitted masks distancing believe singing usually permitted. restrictions meeting others.

Covid declining, far slowly. However, hospitals capacity now. preventable.

Not true. Covid actually preventable. world needed done would ended long time ago. idea part factual statement disagree with, seem rational outlook online discussion work. I’m concerned all. Two weeks 2nd shot I’m done worrying anything Covid related anymore.  Meh, isn’t real point vaccine protect us much getting won’t die get deathly ill? Yeah corporations masters swindling. ""When polls said half Americans would take vaccine, saying herd immunity would take 70 75 percent,"" Fauci said. ""Then, newer surveys said 60 percent would take it, thought, 'I nudge bit,' went 80, 85.""

- Dr. Anthony Fauci, [interview NY Times, 24 December article: ""In telephone interview next day, Dr. Fauci **acknowledged slowly deliberately moving goal posts**."" think Summer normal, think international travel open back fairly vaccinated countries - still convinced vaccine passports widely implemented, we'll see - gonna wait couple months, see we're (up Canada), quite bent getting Europe Summer. good points, thanks explaining insane think that's works. Makes sense. Standard procedure corporate bullshit. Waiting data suggest way vaccine helps reduce spread virus is... ""spreading fear doubt based lack absolute certainty?""

Interesting take. I've seen still, live Southern California.  Fuck madd. It’s platform conservative theocrats lobby claiming moral superiority making hard criticize socially. misremembering. Yeah noticeable dip # tests done snowstorm week, anecdotally many testing centers area closed day two. I'm hoping explains plateau, percentage still lowering That’s it. I’m moving Denver. Maybe someone explain us US, Medical Officer would resign instead one charge mandate? come from, Medical Officer Health Orders override laws jurisdiction government entity. looking info works, way. really.

Vaccine 100% effective. COVID-19, seems hover 60% 80%. want many people vaccine harder virus reach them. would stop doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists realizing covid free work places exist states leaving? live montana tell ive never met anybody says stuff like this. People dont care all. Best case scenario - Nothing happens. 
Worst case - WWIII.  
/s  find funny many people fundamentally masks ""how dare people actually spread germs!""

Like, legit sick going shop, basic courtesey try infect others. Denmark cull 16 million mink covid. aprox 1,500 mink farmers Denmark every single farmer farm. Denmark alone. First bats, pangolins, mink? Give rest. argument? U.S. government, democracy, supposed represent interests people they’re that. thought didn’t test medicine children unethical? pregnant women risk unborn children? alternate reality took exit 2019? Maybe I’m misremembering... You’re right, they’re all. diseases mentioned are, point, way prevalent, deadly, preventable. 7-day moving average cases 96,000, approximate R value last couple months 0.85. pace 2 months we'd 14,000 cases day, high probably qualifies ""dropped prevalence"". June, COVID would gone away.

But, course, response declining prevalence make 100,000 cases day new normal decrease social distancing. one constant pandemic reproductive rates never stay same. can't think anything else happened November? Calm bruh. 2019-era life back late year latest. relax. much rare already that’s going long covid started. Thanks!

 often someone backs say, they'd say something backs agenda keep blabbering it, second someone asks proof, leave feeling lot screaming “compromises” Anyone working US pays taxes US government, even US citizens.  Americans actually ever gave shit. Problem Americans never actually even gave damn 2 weeks. vaccine like every one! there’s absolutely reason think otherwise!

The vast majority people develop required immunity, since efficacy 95% not. 

They likely develop immunity therefore less severe cases, milder symptoms less chance spreading.

So people 0 chance spreading small chance  NY tests sooooo many people though. 280k day. could add 3 European countries many. That's issue Capitalism. unstainable economic system. like it? New Orleans drive cocktail places. sell 44oz slushies like $5. One I'm pretty tanked. Hope gun. Take virus! Could've done parallel company working definitely feel sitting traffic hour twice day improved mental wellbeing. Turns unfettered Capitalism terrible mitigating pandemic good mass producing vaccine. Pick poison. Shit pandemic response vaccines instantly. good response vaccines while. Thanks info! I'm looking Berlin right now. friends stuff thought would best place go really. Last heard shortages(?) I'm cool waiting little longer case. doesn’t mean all! Like vaccine, vast majority recipients develop immunity won’t catch spread virus, small amount outliers not! Madd isn’t gonna like Everything came UK regarding Corona bullshit. UK government messed lot things pandemic, gotta give credit credit’s due, they’ve nailed vaccine role representative tough guy, act like tough guys Facebook groups Worse SA variant?? correct, Greg rep house special election trump appointed Ryan Zinke Interior secretary part inside plan get XL pipeline Montana(tin foil lol), amongst shady stuff had, prob still planned. Greg idiot, cut business taxes Republicans love him. Ok, *only* 1.5% die. rest miserably sick possibly lifelong lung damage like 12% required vaccinations, since everyone needs two doses. live Washington people abide it. really don’t like wearing mask don’t really know science says it’s unnecessary, happily wear one protect others myself. I’ve wearing one even enforced seems like right thing do. don’t get hard people understand.  Vaccines readily available all. city Montana, vaccine sign ups get booked 4 minutes! Jesus, going really fast amazing scientific advances. Spanish Flu took 2 years way deaths per capita, we’re 11 months comparably fewer deaths light end tunnel. Never mind people endured WWI WWII...

Being impatient 11 months something President suggests masks might necessary (even though it’s overly cautious messaging)... generation really needs little fortitude...  Yeah pro-vaccine anti-lockdown stance could take. funding? Trump's decision left China biggest funder went covering things Beijing. US back game, leaves ""investigation"" open higher bidder who'd like pay national imagery.

Yeah realize sounds 100% like crazy conspiracy theory. care cause chest hurts. Fuck virus hope never restores credibility. places China US... think people guessing late spring, early summer international travel relaxed highly vaccinated countries, anyone's guess wanted travel country that's struggling vaccinations. happens time. People read/see/hear want hear downvote. really wish subs better moderation. Spreading antivax conspiracies seriously damaging. Government represent people elect it, people Montana want, good Governor giving them. thing. Walmart allows free RV parking. Ask manager late, park. It’s well lit quite. car. Edit: buy window shades right there. battery died, bought new one Walmart morning. think profited. free parking $150 spent Walmart, free will. 😂 That's pretty clearly already happening. pay money happen? Also sucks trying get vaccinated. county decided contact people appointments phone, email anything else, supposedly call twice leave voicemail. answer, get skipped. Montana Dems atrociously touch picking candidates recently.

Hopefully pull heads asses soon we're going straight R generation.

I felt way Biden, that's beside point. Literally ran ""My last name Trump."" perfectly reasonable give protections vaccine manufacturer produced vaccine record time combat one worst public health crises modern history. way people get vaccinated. benefit far outweighs harm.

The benefit protecting businesses sued negligence far outweighed consequences protection customers employees. First detected Sept 2020 UK, 6 months alert world higher lethality...take time... One reasons vaccines could approved quickly ironically bad outbreak become. 

Vaccine trials need time get enough cases control group make reasonable assessment protection given treatment group. disease rare, take long time. there’s huge outbreak, cases accumulate quickly trials end early.

Yes lets learn nothing eventually health restrictions regards animals smh  werent hyper cautious flu risk kid, antiscience given every study shows flu greater risk kids

dont deny kid social developmental years please Good you, new strains taking lives 30 year olds. 50-60 years life left. Even 60-80 year olds 10-40 years left them. can't return normalcy virus mortality rate somewhere 2 - 4% spreads easily cold.

There 100,000 + deaths UK space year, that's despite three national lockdowns. 

You can't return normalcy want to. would gladly take 2-3 colds even flu year could actually see human beings smile mean people still need wear compliance muzzles forever?

Well good thing wanting weapon specifically designed kill humans always mark stable person /s Hopefully starts wearing often give across right message. plus side.. depends count citizens? underestimate influence placebos human brain currently Toronto, guys likely back normal long us.

Our case count significantly, Pfizer moderna jerking us around. vaccine roll extremely slow due supply. pandemic book expected mortality ballpark bad flu season. guesstimate require vaccinating 25% population (everyone 65+, equal-sized group high-risk younger adults). current pace, reach late March stop vaccinating young healthy people. pretty naive believe half UN basically puppet US previously USSR. could be. could also bunch factors. 

I got vaccinated trial back September sneezing bit past week two. it’s mountain cedar season Texas it’s cold AF nose runny. 

Basically 50/50 lol said I’m angry? think you’re dumb, that’s all. Assuming you, like me, last round, I’m you. I’m eligible vaccine, get expect everyone else gotten too. I’m gonna keep caring that. People pretty good amount natural immunity virus get natural infections... We're talking probably 80 90% range. can't dismiss folks hand even vaccinated... reality we're starting zero reality we're starting 80 100 million Americans roughly mostly 100% immune. people immunity natural infection suspect. Study study shows Marine corps study recent one saw people antibodies 80% less likely infected compared not. folks mildest cases fact something like 60% asymptomatic something like 85% asymptomatic reinfected.

The reality case numbers go dramatically even everyone immune we're going stay shut 80% people vaccinated. going happen. 50% people immunity , start seeing dramatic differences fast virus spreads. Relatively minor mitigations large effect compared zero people immunity. probably approach 65% immunity vaccination natural infection late June. 65% would estimate probably 20% virus 45% combination virus vaccination vaccination only. probably hit 50% immunity natural infection vaccine mid late April, infections continuing go point, pretty clear trajectory going that's things start open. yes die you/ make long term nursing home average less 2 years live. Numbers don’t lie nobody die do. look numbers 98% people live covid die generally really old already dying. Life hard... friend’s boyfriend got it, spent night together day started coughing bit (by Friday felt like he’d hit train), didn’t get it.  yeah happy cooney running cause knew Trump ballot bullock leaving cooney man win. still voted though¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Don’t bother. people don’t want reasonable helpful. want angry. Lol people dumb trust want investigate? people need make mind. Lockdowns work cases low enough test, trace, isolate *and* lockdowns super strict. widespread community spread, lockdowns protect certain classes people able stay isolated. rest us still exposed, creates spread. 

What *can* mitigate risks. I’m guessing I’m 1-2 months away fully vaccinated I’m catch covid now. don’t indoor dining, I’ll eat outside restaurants (I live warm climate it’s big deal). double mask work (I work kids homeless shelter). avoid crowds. that, pretty much live life. go shopping person food necessities. grab take couple times week. avoiding aunt she’s 70 health problems, she’s vaccinated I’ll probably see another week. 

Lockdowns way don’t work, we’re close effectively ending pandemic. Lol people dumb trust want investigate? people need make dumb mind. Sure, meant wearing mask *can* ordinary long-term day-to-day thing. I’ve going chill bars it’s awesome. Still gotta wear mask you’re seated outdoors good. It’s huge burden shoulders.

Smiling *Frasier* I've gone official websites waitlist closed, havent seen local org ones. might wishful thinking part, consider US tens millions cases last three months (and that’s *confirmed* cases) means tens millions Americans immune next several months. top tens millions vaccinated citizens (even one dose decreases chances contracting virus significantly) number daily vaccinations surpassed 1.5 million. top *that* people already received vaccine likely die contracting likely contract line work. 

We’re thick winter number daily cases decreasing rapidly. would suspect things warm spending time outdoors becomes viable option, we’ll see cases drop even further. Uhhhh, Montana? guys alright there?

Tell hate adorable puppies not. See governor South Dakota refused *ever* implement mask mandate &amp; spent Covid money creating tourism ads bring tourists state. universal Coronavirus vaccine help  I’ve thought FDA stonewalling vaccine satisfy donors one position power.. anywhere... wants explain why. Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, etc ? reason besides finances partner aren’t traveling fully vaccinated not. traveled mid pandemic vaccine fine. wore good masks face shield flight eating drinking plane near anyone.

See reason couldn’t performed safely now. hard time imagine self owned businesses make money pandemic. Like that's income, could gone six figure income near zero even could reopen changed reinstallations. hope start taxing carbon appropriate amount. maybe people would think beyond whatever selfish reasons fly frequently.

It’s one thing SA variant dominant variant Austria UK one AZ fine projected dominant western countries coming months. WTF wrong many states country? get it. guess I'm one East Coast liberal elites. IIUC work universal coronavirus vaccine pretty far along time sars1 outbreak. outbreak got handled funding dried up. MAYBE, MAYBE, time around, tangible proof another coronavirus could well end fucking civilization know (we got FUCKIN' LUCKY covid, things considered), pull plug time around.

I think there's somewhat universal notion among people backgrounds world run someone competent. ""they"" know do. practice, think world coasting full speed ""YOLO"" overall theme. vaccines without eggs ppl allergies. mean take vaccine something allergic to. Yes currently people specific allergies cannot covid vaccine. I’ve never liked needles.  oh well live Canada really dont give fuck anyways . GLHF fun paying ass tiny apartment making wages you’d make nondescript Midwestern city. Israel’s data supports lower viral loads/reduced ability spread That's privileged thing say. People work many can't work home. even often forced come office. Someone go store shop groceries work cash register. people work risky environments, e.g. bar, can't afford quit jobs qualify unemployment. choice them. 

People also need social life hobbies. can't stay home forever. many choose take risk. that's months sitting home watching nothing change governments world care enough handle pandemic properly finally end fucking nightmare. take risk could get shot two? crazy conspiracy theories becoming reality. quick google search shows moderna supplying nations: us facilities working outside facilities, started yet. trump executive order ban vaccine exports, show didnt employ defense production act truly ban exports.

lets real tho, us buying priority first set vaccines means less went first world nations. third world countries really immediate priority manufacturers. still us announced joining covax soon already gave $4 billion gavi vaccines poorer theory case anyone care reality TV show sub posters think, though?  That’s interesting know actually. Based news I’ve seen, make sound like everybody burned masks events size Royal Wedding daily. you’ve seen, people relaxed masks distancing outdoors then? know things supposed getting much better everywhere next months, even point, I’m hoping way Florida working well translates summer northeast it’s warm people want outside.

Also agree getting spread homes, makes sense. 18 January, 26 days ago, predicted rate 7-day average daily new cases crashing United States incredible. predict y'all sub-100K 3–4 weeks.

All comments like, ""oh way that's way early"" . . . course tiring, battle over, people live far worse situations. Haha reminded popular saying social platform Weibo China: mediocre, yet confident. i’m canadian actually britain last year school repatriate canada original flight cancelled.

the brits done terrible job. even worse america look numbers. we’ve done quite well canada lockdowns atrocious. latest guidelines reopening parts ontario published cbc given endless list contradicting confusing nonsense.

i get lockdowns done prevent hospitals overrun better way. imo based fields study, things allowed open entry buildings allowed you’re wearing mask (as already case). that’ll keep transmission low let people work meet friends. also contradicting rules ffs. like go walmart costco can’t meet group friends park?? makes sense. virus lot parts, two. important one spike protein, however. Vaccinated immunity superior immunity infection precisely include ~3 decoy proteins. future, could generate tailored protein parts want exposed create best antibodies work strains choose. They're less risk. argument however government wants delay people vaccinated think likely already virus That's think larger point especially chance death relatively low government's eyes won’t lifted easily, especially certain crowded places, schools one them. literally one said everyone needed vaccinated start reopening. fact quoting saying that

I appreciate already moved goalposts ""Once get 30 40% end April"" ""June"".  I’ll try mods; since using names couple primary colors descriptors state &amp; social leanings makes “nakedly political” post:

Tennessee conservative state believes personal responsibly.

Please feel free exercise personal responsibility seeking vaccine nearby state w/o residency restrictions prioritizes higher.

Mississippi, Missouri, Kentucky, &amp; Virginia nearby vax distribution polices aren’t based do, they’re based &amp; risk.

Write letter local newspaper editorial page you’re fully vaccinated &amp; call representation. numbers seem reasonably realistic, though actually looked vaccine supply supposed get China bad, must paid China.

Is easy?
Hey, China ok. Please CCP, would like money cash possible. Thanks try drag way longer know Good read. Thanks weather? mention it. understand ""greater good"" planning. However see math would back argument grocery workers less risk general public.  IKR! Bullock put mandate effect, dumbass Gianforte reverse it? Jesus people, use brains. hallelujah even bothered read article, would see link Guardian article expert Covid Germany talks likely source mink farms China. Ah you’re one people aren’t you?

Ah good point. lived visited, outdoor recreation available amazing. And, could used altitude, seems labeled different difficulty scale areas country--if area, stick stuff says ""easy,"" first. Right here. realistic, hate say part steps taken. many businesses would close fully shut down, allow worth didley day-to-day lives point might required international travel large venues owners decided check house policy It’s pretty clear wasn’t idiot’s mistake took long theatrical “investigation” Still happens nontrivial number people 40s. still get neutralizing antibody test different one normal one ensure them. percentage people 5 10%. keep telling people government make decisions based relatively small percentages people may atypical different norm way. go based averages that's make decisions end month, US likely 20% 265 million people age 16+ given least first dose. number likely double next month J&amp;J gets going small uptick Pfizer/Moderna distribution.

I think 60% adults vaccinated 1+ dose shortly end April. looking total population (including children) standpoint, it'll probably 33% end next month 60% Memorial Day. Billings resident, pains see people beautiful city *not* wear one. Well, proof come roll-out vaccination take months - years. proving vaccines stop transmission. ultimate proof 'real world' test. Lol, wear one obviously. mean afterwards. Please read said. keep mandates otherwise people start realizing propaganda children suffering long term organ damage lie Bye Felicia, one cares.

What authoritarian nutcase. 

Good Montana. Shea mid 40s. would impinge liberties. drunk driving scares you, wear seatbelt. actually test positive THINK it? 

Furthermore could've also gotten false-positive sick something else even 

So evidence anything think PEOPLE gradually start following rules less less spring

The actual mandates lifted time somewhere May-July. States already mandatory mask laws NOW. Dr. Fauci continue advice stuff reality? I'm sick tired guy. reality situation far cry reality. roommate lived car before. verge homeless again. tuned family looking apartment too, moved together. It’s tight squeeze, make work. Beats alternative. Yeah, need term limits. need easier voting enthusiastic voting populace. That's best defense elected officials represent constituents. Forcing good bad ones time gives us revolving door good bad, likely bad good. 

I hate idea kneecapping democracy fucking active democracy. Term limits lazy solution, sorry check inaction.  get Texas suburbs, Albuquerque short power outages absolutely apparent reason lived there. Source? UK run idiots. I'm saying right second people mostly vaccinated age 65 relatively small percentage virus. get vaccination campaign substantially overlap. that's probably going happen large numbers another month EARLIEST right. God shown incompetent everything is. would never survive mad max scenario  states don’t allow open containers vehicles...

Everywhere I've seen legalize cocktails go, enclosed container, even styrofoam plastic cup lid. I'm guessing put straw one car, would considered open container, partake get home. Same! would relatively little overlap two groups? 30% estimate includes ~20% never tested positive, would still largely seeking vaccine. least people tested positive seek vaccine. 

So would expect chance 20-25% vaccinations far done people already form immunity. besides agree opening right now. still little bit early live Iowa store work flat took hands created informal waiting list ensure extra doses scrounge go right employees

Got first dose yesterday they're going ensure there's second 4 weeks don’t seem care one mental health, socialization, economic ruin. 

One thing I've learned past year, someone drink alcohol: realize getting drunk public important mental health! :D using bad faith argument restrictions, see would fly little pea brain. Get real. don’t see thing Britain Canada don’t need we’ve done decent job maintaining low enough illness rate stayed level would result exceeding maximum capacity.

Why isn’t outcry British governments mismanagement pandemic? drag feet long possible implementing lockdowns/stricter measures, resulting higher illness rate manage, resulting protocols kicking in.

Sick disappointing surprising. second hospitals longer risk overwhelmed every single restriction needs end

They ended last week then

Like, &lt;100,000 new cases per day vulnerable already vaccinated, hospitals outside LA overwhelmed even averaging 250k new cases per day... are. everyone needs vaccinated start reopening... That's reality I'm sorry. look esteemed virologist Angela Rasmussen said basically saying assuming got 50% immunity cases keep coming unexpected surprises probably start really opening June. we're going wait everybody safe reopen going happen we'd waiting forever.   They're even trying hide anymore. never considered service workers essential. Makes fuckin sick. ""Lower"" class people fuckin chance world. Same, honestly. Billings resident disappointed state government. Gianforte better Daines Rosendale, straight up, need Bullock back office.  checked spike antibodies though? lot younger people develop normal antibodies show test spike. also cells likely give pretty substantial protection although prevent spreading it. move. ""live exactly town become homeless"". need find new friends share values. 33% immunity summer can’t fix problem like “mental health services.” People’s mental health struggles clear origin: lives yanked away us. solution bring back real life. People, listen. Montanan, INDIVIDUAL companies/school districts/etc get CHOOSE whether masks required buildings. Calm down, please. You’re probably giving anxiety nice Benadryl hydrate take nap Okay.....good luck Montana. ratio lmfao Month two. Lol. Maybe next year may get together. Right talking tier two..by end summer. end summer fall. I'm saying maybe next year. Maybe. looks like guy would hire play villain political thriller. want world find balance. say summer, government promises 70% vaccinated beginning summer everyone September. make immune. coworker two weeks later antibodies. switch overnight limit exposure. logic it. likely first get pass it.  I’m saying it’s likely early good news. believe though it’s black white sick/not sick. It’s little complex. yes still careful spite recent decline cases need one wire nose bridge. I’m liking halo mask right upgraded one filter pocket. wear glasses exclusively 🤷🏻‍♀️ tried, thank though!!! people expecting *some* reduction, giant question much reduction occurs. ""95% effective"" statistic specifically preventing severe **symptoms**. Unfortunately, article actually say much transmission reduced, still leaves important question unanswered.

All available data seen far shows vaccines significantly less effective preventing mild moderate symptoms asymptomatic cases. 

For example: Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine apparently somewhere around 80% effective preventing severe symptoms, reduces transmission 2/3. That's way better vaccinated all, that's also low enough mean ""herd immunity"" would literally impossible achieve vaccine. Even every single person vaccinated, disease would still slowly spread. Definitely better nothing, also means COVID would continue circulating forever.

This unique COVID, normal. multiple levels ""immunity"" - sometimes body kill virus entirely, times asymptomatic carrier.

It alien magic. poorly understood highly contagious disease hijack ACE-2 NRP1 receptors, allowing damage basically every major organ system directly indirectly. Given strange ways *known* viruses behave, treat brand new disease caution.

We know directly infect peripheral central nervous systems. One thing know whether neurodegenerative. is, we're already looking severely messed future. cavalier stage literally among dangerous things could society. Disease kills &amp; iniures people war. act like it.  online jobs Cruise ship workers do, ships standing still, burning millions every month.  Claudia Sheinbaum, major Mexico City, lifted red alert (we use traffic light system: green, yellow, orange red), even government's indicators put place said go back it, stretched orange alert El Buen Fin (our equivalent Black Friday).

Then passed us back orange alert couple days ago, right time St. Valentine's Day. see (indoor) mask mandate would let good chunk people vaccinated. I'm really sure anyone expected end earlier, especially data showing effectiveness. Let’s put numbers this. Pretend need 3 pieces virus become sick COVID. unvaccinated sick person (in vicinity) produces 3000, vaccinated sick person produces 10. would make “equally” sick. idea much virus need encounter become infected. Maybe actually need 50. case, vaccinated sick person isn’t threat you. don’t know yet. data waiting on. absence knowing, it’s safer everyone (or anyone actually care about) operate first example correct.   Nah, based vaccination targets. That's sensible way. even talking friends restrictions eased thought it'd sensible way. 20% population vaccinated, outdoor gathering limits eased, 40% are, indoor limits eased. 50% population fully vaccinated, mask mandates lifted.

Something like puts definitive end something work towards. I'm going lie, also kind fascinating New Zealand cases, track transmission routes well even figure someone got infected. countries position Georgia bit different NYC. literally pulling numbers ass now

current news shows we'll get enough vaccines produced everyone end july, probably able get everyone vaccinated August. That's great. Vaccinations well people better following restrictions holidays also causing cases go down. That's also great. long continue careful reopening plans, seems reasonable expect cases continue go down.

But ease reopening fast, stuff likely go back up. important assume everything good ease get caught guard. seriously thing takes absolute least effort earth do. Americans literally whiny selfish entitled babies planet. bill allowing CC without permit? realize guns people MT. fact life get used to. actually makes feel safe Right cuz it’s coincidence one world’s biggest virology labs happens city originated. Definitely coincidence Blame Americans anything.

Canada death rate 2.7x lower US. 💯 Haha mad? I'm surprised many seem surprised number going down. default get disease fewer get disease. Also, everyday fully vaccinated started January takes 6 weeks get full effectiveness. we're mid February!  (I'm one week away that.) thought heard something it. used bartend Texas wonder would work. Anytime drunk something stupid TABC great trying charge bartender it. though (assuming current Victoria one end less week) describing lot us stilling living countries. travel anywhere domestically reason whatsoever  amazing we're almost year people still can't grasp idea. like people getting positive test falling dead soon receive results. cant possibly comparing last fall. others said, there’s lot people immunity right now. probably still immunity, reinfections rare. Vietnam currently living Taiwan, countries allow anyone travel unless business, citizenship. 

Getting flights back Vietnam even citizen nightmare, trying get back Taiwan almost year. travel another country like would likely get stuck several months longer too.

Once possible fly Vietnam that's plan, meet anywhere can. think insane weather parts country.. People FINALLY stuck home want go out. vaccines dead people help think mostly weather. Come March, think numbers skyrocket (warmth kiddos back school). Unfortunately trash people. Even trash ""property management companies"". unfortunate part world isnt easy solution. Need place live get mail, get ID, get job, get streets. cycle. 

Hell lived car 2 years making 28 hour nowhere would rent eviction 19. Masks remain. social distancing places.

People though choose precaution. I’ve got hope though boosters every six months die?  threat laughable. 

try staying topic. think I've explained pretty simply. 

Being vaccinated ""magical robe protection"" like game Dungeons Dragons. 

Vaccination 1 tool (among handful tools).. must collectively still use keep trying **reduce spread**. 

Even vaccinated,. still catch, carry spread Coronavirus. Vaccination prevent that. vaccination prime immune system to:

* Make (internal) sickness shorter less severe

That's it. nothing more. 

If think get vaccinated, like ""throwing light-switch"" ""opening door"" go right back unsafe unprotected things PRE-pandemic ?

No. That's vaccination does. 

Vaccination ""communal"" thing (we together,.. like Masks Distancing forms hygiene). things TOGETHER.. beat virus. 

The goal we're trying achieve keep reducing R0 number (as far) 1.0 possible. Nearly US States still high 0.9x areas.. 1 state (North Dakota) 0.80.. still concerning. baby bust... Respect India one.. Evicting someone pays pandemic fuck off. Landlords raise rent enough, want take advantage market conditions set rent high enough start bad business people total scum.

Yep, births 25% France compared time last year. article also said big declines expected US UK well. Lines losers going new year’s smh Wonder he’s going many vaccines Hang there... pandemic **will end.** certainly wasn’t awesome forget people already infected.... optimistic say herd immunity June?  “We stamped virus again,” Ardern told news conference capital, Wellington. still something worth investigating. whole point. irrelevant argument organized governor.... can’t really see many vague nouns predict everything reopen mid-March. Schools, businesses, restaurants, even sports stadiums.

Now, Modi going give vaccines anytime soon polishing shoes nothing? Yes, top steady rise Xmas.

More specifically, peak (rather continual rise) due lockdown introduced start Jan. hope vaccine deployment continues, leave lockdown *and* continue see cases (and especially deaths) drop spring summer.

It’s late side, yes. injecting healthy people antibodies vaccine developed companies cannot held accountable something end going wrong, unnecessary risk lot people. might really close herd immunity anyways. Especially since virus weak, get reinfected even weaker.
And vaccines leaky too. fucking waste. God bless America, truly.

It’s typical puritan American laws. getting people want vaccinated still get vaccinated certainly problem. problem. also problem everyone else can't get vaccinated

but we're even bridge yet. first, need vaccine available everyone wants it. then, look data see enough people vaccinated tell need get people vaccinated think herd immunity hold. unfortunately, still happen june/july timeframe. Funny cases drop stop testing... Alberta Montana neighbours, also government’s mindset dealing pandemic. AKA Texas Canada. BAD yes, already made fact actually facts back claims perfectly clear. sure felt need repeat yourself. Yes is? seen UK numbers after? R rises third symptoms generic? would ask humans experienced fatigue, headaches chest pains past month i'd guess would answer yes. I'm harder harder time coming scenarios end pandemic United States. Hospitalizations implied casualties go project continue dropping reach negligible levels. 


The non-math version reasoning is: 


1) transmission environment appears turned hostile virus even vaccinations could make presence felt. 


2) heterogenous nature risk disease allows early vaccines outsized effect casualty rates, vaccinate high-risk first get much larger casualty drop percentage population vaccinated would imply. 


3) vaccination program reaching size \*should\* noticeable cumulative downward effect overall transmission well, especially if/when ramps soon addition new vaccines. 


4) variants came way late relative vaccination campaign exception B117, even B117 looks like poised outraced vaccines. still driving infection rates, 50% increase currently fairly low infection rates still \*that\* high, continue pummel vaccines week. people try drag Australia well. Calling us authoritarian, etc. known medium (possibly long) term effects covid19 severe. Jeez, voted. What's wrong people?

But yeah, lagged deaths Christmas surge. they've also going since end January. Unless still paper end straw/ it’s still closed container. 1. never said California ""getting wrecked."" words, mine. severity B117 surge yet determined. 

2. Yes, know IHME garbage. mentioned simply make point modellers making changes based increased transmissibility B117. 

3. Since Rt constant, increase due activities. Even B117 present, collective behaviours alone could create another spike. pandemic fatigue easing restriction, Rt likely stay 0.83 months. 

4. Vaccines help; however, statement, ""our vaccination campaign focused high-risk patients"" entirely accurate. Osterholm noted half vaccines distributed 65. Tens millions health care workers, emergency services, lab techs, educators, even politicians 65 received first jab (myself included). come from? News flash: people get vaccine. wants.

If want even publicly available, problem. State one highest DUI offenders U.S.. give ""to go"" cocktails? anyone else see insanity? Mom buys cell phone surprised autocorrect errors. Cases started going right Trump left office Good know That's even new one. among bullshit Trump spewing last fall. Yes, would dumb.

I’m jealous people NZ able live complete normal lives last months. lockdown Auckland area gonna painful course, couple weeks lifted absolutely everything pre Covid head tells right, guts tell corruption also exists China maybe exotic animals used labs found way free market. 

I know total nonsense cannot shake thought.  businesses NZ get subsidy agree cut jobs. 

I think expect drop profits 30% lockdown time apply subsidy. number big businesses ended paying back subsidy ended profitable expected. percent per capita density size don’t matter. Dude, literally moved Florida COVID Desantis. live Virginia fully blue government, higher pay skilled job ever south Florida, cost living low. feels good worry walk front door everyday anymore. Sure, beach isn’t 15 minutes away anymore, Shenandoah National Park is. ""past pandemics"" mean specific case Spanish flu, unique context time?

You guys give slightest damn mutations first 10 months pandemic. Seem discovered possible. happened? didn’t say know better immunologists experts. knowledge subject acceptable enough know said totally wrong

Maybe he’s Florida place doesn’t believe virus it’s business usual. US consistently stabs gut wonders bleeds, hope human suffering created low I'm idiot assume anything, can't use population data point ""% world population died COVID"" know that:

1. demographics comparable US death rate dependent demographics.
2. number cases documented way population due less developed medical system.

You compare US countries document cases similar demographics sampling bias, like I've said, clearly care truth, care proving narrative. June July US probably around April May UK.

UK things intelligently B.1.351 seems make AstraZeneca vaccine terribly impressive. true. People held longer could even imagine. 

But even sub, 2 months ago, positive. Even daily thread full pessimism, threads especially negative. it’s different story. daily threads go optimism. threads pretty decent long aren’t kids/schools variants. 

Is partly people coming areas Reddit? Probably, some. bet least tone shift legit changing perception. tone *this* subreddit changing, doubt happening vacuum. Even though Reddit definitely doesn’t represent real life lol kind infringement rights freedom exactly concerned about. They'd better that.

If people want vaccine, get it. feel need to, don't. Simple that. Well provided vaccinated AstraZeneca get steamrolled B.1.351 said ""the"" flu season, yes, summer. Can't wait, waiting. Great news! Exactly.  wages also lower national average too... honest worry get many staters tele-commute offices back home state, really bringing industry them. Sure increase people bring increase retail sales entertainment, states good paying blue collar jobs dying, housing sky rocketing. 

Also im salty, applied mortgage last january couldnt get one, payment needed year ago, still way short buying home finally. pretty hard xenophobic towards outsiders situation... person bought house looking at, came california, paid cash, paid 20k listing... hard compete  Okay, you’re looking fight. I’m interested. Yeah, really see raw incidence death data. probably evident level. 

To fair, report states likely deadlier put number it. many caveats representability data increased risk hospitalisations death vary greatly. Reporting really try make outrageous claims tens percent higher mortality especially going go different studies limitations. federal government authority implement ""national rules"". Trump Biden.

Most people numbers pretty close eradication New cases easily traceable since numbers low. 

That's completely false. places neared eradication mass lockdowns. There's zero examples countries getting rid virus mask mandate. ones got rid used mass imprisonment, forced quarantine multiple weeks anyone traveled country. He's trying diplomatic he's right, masks well restrictions stay. smartest minds used put cocaine soft drinks lead paints. 

As someone plans live far, far eighties, ask one question anyone extolling virtues specific vaccines.

What **long term** side effects MRNA vaccines? 

NB. mind weakened virus vaccines, inoculation etc. referring exclusively MRNA. Translation OP mentioned points: efficacy rate, time efficacy.

I don’t know interpret comment efficacy rate “not really” point, translation seems suggest points concern, language doesn’t indicate one important other.

Are getting different interpretation reading original article?

Certainly let's get everyone higher risk dying covid vaccinated first. done, say pandemic over? would love see clear description markers policymakers looking determine steps take going back toward normal I'd love see steps referencing supporting science.

Even feel sentiment changed neurotic pessimistic hopeful demanding end insanity got jab. opinion 75% population gets vaccinated, go damn lives. problem experts scientists largely people perfect world. They’re largely detached common people. still get paychecks. study reality, don’t always live it.

after people get vaccinated around July. need insist normalcy. Otherwise go forever. Yeah, live area got Dem rep incumbent. She’s also said Republicans majority incredibly splintered disorganized hopefully stops pushing much BS state conservative think tanks.

The article decent enough job spelling out, could easily see someone like 50 year old mother taking title face value increasing distrust vaccines. stand corrected, see pdf report. modelling B.1.1.7 strain admittedly subjectively think combination UK plus South African plus Brazilian, plus ones know yet cause another wave U.S. stamp out.  I'm glad hear comments many like us - I'm hoping create covid pod families similarly concerned, playmates. Like play kids careful, vaccinated parents. LOL. Good one bro. Hospital drops still accelerating recent weeks. Unless trend suddenly reverses itself, weeks away back summer lull lows ""Because many stupid people following rules"" explanation usually hear  state big snowstorm last week? feel way NY realizing plateau may tests last week catching week, percent positivity I’m travel ICU nurse. I’ve wanting travel Montana work awhile. It’s absolutely beautiful summer. Looks like I’ll get chance. starting get worried cases declining know I’ll job there! Let guess... he’s Republican? Remember example London already 37% people past infection rate.

So 20 people said get vaccine, possibly 7 people already immune.

Source: Cambridge University feel much Florida. key republican demographic, forget it. Republicans, elected ones &amp; voters, think America far far end pandemic. There’s gonna lot shocked people new variants cause next surge end Spring. Aye! well earned nickname. funny, anti-maskers getting really desperate kind validation. seems like prioritizing teachers (&lt; 65) mistake. many essential workers. Young hospital workers priority hospital risk overrun. spike rna cause sterility “Once 99% country vaccinated, start consider date possibly begin discussing maybe start pulling back restrictions” get that. It’s thought. end 3-4 months one ever said otherwise. never second vaccines approved garbage. Someone presenting COVID symptoms tests positive COVID, virtually certain COVID.

If read case report, sum total man's clinical presentation September:

*""In September 2020, 58-year old immunocompetent male history asthma presented mild fever dyspnea""*

He's asthmatic FFS - asthmatics frequently short breath! - could anxious... presented twice testing December too. mean ""mild fever""? likely subjective symptom there's temp. reported. best come support claim certain reinfection (together one swab..) fail.

No doubt authors would pushing ""glory"" first report first case critical reinfection SA strain. Unfortunately quest spoil normal scrutinies required publication.

What think odds ""critical reinfection SA strain"" likely anyway? strain around least 5 continents now... hear these? Compare odds false positive test I'll take latter thank you. think anyone claims that. obviously money though. else made meds higher profit margins. checked life expectancy France (50% hesitant) UK might 10-20% hesitant (with google).

France: 82.72 years

UK: 81.26 years

So see vaccine hesitancy effects ""cavepeople""? Demand much higher supply. Nothing do. Israel special case, made deal BioNTech/Pfizer exchange Data. countries paying better / small population (like oil rich gulf states), get deliveries, factor power: US decides export done, blame them? - Germany still think right thing work EU level: don’t want animosities go together. tax base dying fast enough. do?! Hopefully politicans keeping out...

goverments supposed reflect people.

change people, change government... general population starts getting jabs go back normal world Florida Man? long taking it? can’t find anything says long takes go deficient raised levels. I’m vaccinated child isn’t we’re latinx means it’s harder skin absorb vit sun I’ve giving vit drops. what’s big deal?

To promote anxiety public clicks. grandma dies COVID say “well time.” 🙄 last real issue parties agree on. wouldn’t eliminated become drastically less common. Right it’s 100k cases day 7 day average still US. last time checked. lineage evolved Danish mink farms. biologically different covid classic. think e484k, probably less contagious humans died out. protests outdoors people wore masks. Let consumer decide. guy beat reporter years back. Total scum.  I'm trying best here, we've patient 11+ months still end sight continually moving goalposts. asking one, think anyone apologize completely wits end point. going rest life? COVID going eliminated US entire English speaking world, make millions dollars/pounds every year scams run normally done free versions software use.  people selfish morons. minor inconvenience. imagine government instituted rations like WWII?  whole point flatten curve stop Covid cases  he's getting downvoted suggesting government encourage outdoor dining masks. Cerave PM lotion lifesaver winter skin  willfully obtuse, I'm out. Exactly Hopefully state Soom, hate whole mask thing rarely wear NJ?

And BMI 25 still top end healthy weight. probably far average. Yeah started using Reddit covid lockdown complain nothing else covid lockdown, guess way life people? Idk dude want get internet go back real life activities ASAP 😢 Guns cool. Fuck god fuck bigotry though.  supposed prevent catching transmitting too, they're still gathering data confirm officially. I'm thinking NY there, although cuomo ass hot seat pressure builds might remove earlier  IMO zero covid people dangerous anti-vaxxers. anti-vaxxers refuse vaccine, everyone else vaccinated really harming anyone themselves. Eradicating covid impossible attempting would mean endless lockdowns, much stricter anything seen US Europe. would absolutely destroy society.  overwhelming majority experts disagree you.

What's clear, least me, considered substantial risk. kids transmit virus even they're infected? kids good wearing masks social distancing. (I hard time believing kids good that) Oh STFU. censorship really needed? Judy Martz - governor bad took damn near two decades pretty conservative state elect conservative lol. completely respectful everyone treated respect. Moral high ground maintained. worst stories hear. breaks heart knowing close. Montana governor blood hands.
I’m still shock events past year, people still don’t think covid “real,” “that deadly.” lot people mourn 9/11 every year, 3,000 people killed, don’t give shit nearly half million people dying. Unreal.

I’ll also never understand refusing wear mask. It’s literally easiest thing world do. wear 2 whenever I’m store, haven’t died oxygen deprivation yet! guess would masks full schedule full attendance. That's good read, thanks. health policy political? Nothing stopping wearing mask, want force others same. cool   don’t see businesses putting obstacles customers longer they’re required. Also there’s way verify can’t easily faked puts onus door person probably makes minimum wage gives 0 fucks. don’t see happening outside medical communities congregate living   husband anxiously awaiting turn vaccine (we’re 30s), newborn baby, 4 a5 year old. children vaccinated, I’m unsure proceed even summer comes.  don’t need government tell looking infection death rates Georgia apparently others reason. I'm NYC. Everyone know approves opening indoor dining. allowed opinion this, city, thing achieved talking ass. hasn’t proven fact, least Pfizer’s vaccine, there’s early evidence reduces transmission lowering viral load. mysterious fourth group, depressed broken pandemic they’ve given even hoping normal?Definitely projecting here... think concern unknown long term effects. There's evidence even people Covid mild symptoms, might still long lasting vascular damage, heart damage, lung damage. know could case children parent might little worried too, seems like there's lot still know. happy say mom included count today Quantify disaster? AZ rollout looks rest country.   Yeah understand vaccinated yet still socially distanced wearing masks? Makes 0 sense lol  seat table would worse, no? reason worry vaccine efficacy, least yet. Wave what? Wave freedom? Oh no, best go lock away another year. Going honest. people use website kind losers. offense guys, I’m willing bet lot people heavily use reddit, included, don’t exactly ton going IRL. everyone obviously that’s definitely stereotype. 

Lockdown basically business usual lot people cares ends not? job reduce transmission, replication, dangerous mutations novel pathogen. relax restrictions vaccination proceeds, R continues one. glad say UK government indicated exactly plan. Either way, takes 2 weeks sort hit big peak first dose. sick already got vaccine, severe symptoms 10 days later, vaccine really time much yet.

Still sucks. Sorry loss. Shh don’t say kinda stuff Twitter! three groups people comes covid: 

1. People care since lives back normal.
2. People still heavily affected restrictions eager get back normal.
3. People like ""covid lifestyle"" want return normal.

I'd estimate half US group 1 point. people post read anything covid. sub mostly group 2. small vocal (especially internet) minority group 3, source comments mentioning. downvote people. I'm montanan. He's worst. end year? end Spring. boss boarded conspiracy train. asked morning get DuckDuckGo onto work computer. younger me. watches YouTube videos. wife Facebook jail posting false information i.e. videos fact checked FB. Covid vaccines actually vaccines ""shot"". refuses wear mask. time daughter Covid prior testing positive getting sick. tip iceberg him. I'm mentally drained get home. don’t believe it’s ethical make condition employment education fact feel would cause people need disclose legally protected disabilities (ie cancer immune issues something it’s recommended take it). think strongly encouraged workplaces schools work bring vaccine people it’s easy them.  base full anti-vaxers. point sharing clip share Rogan clip. Didn’t watch much full clip. joe pissing couldn’t find clip anywhere. Yes, I'm sure rich overlords absolutely love us peasants home instead working 100% productivity going spending money them. know moronic think situation ""the man"" wants lmao. part brain processing basic logic really ain't there, it?  Good them. US need vaccinated. Happiness can’t excuse put people risk, else sorts abhorrent behavior justified. I’m asshole doesn’t give excuse *be* asshole. 

Besides, like said before, tell they’re distancing anyway. Shit, heard best friend’s voice last year. 90% interaction friends exchanging memes occasionally laugh react. 

And don’t blame them. nothing enjoyable say. best I’m incessantly babbling oddly specific hobbies know full well don’t interest focus on, worst I’m vacillating hopelessness, paralyzing anxiety, anger/frustration. don’t anything nice say... majority Reddit people seriously scare me... surprised this

Of course.

The whole mechanism vaccine induce immune reaction antigen virus similar antigen virus. wonder vaccinated people immunity ""trained"" deal virus, thus, surprise, surprise, leading lesser count viral particles body.

That's vaccine works. 

Now, said that, body quite compartmentalized terms immune response: immune response lungs mean immune response nose. 

I started learn quite recently grasp details this, maybe that's proverbial devil details. Good never denied. PM came said press conferences pretty much day symtufy published  surprisingly, wasn’t well studied past, people didn’t care much much flu virus vaccinated person shed. We’re learning lot pandemic many ways things. Maybe wants take health optimization high level. Many East Asians wear masks ordinary life block pollution. bunch babies can't put mask. couple week ago saw newspaper headline North Dakota mentioned herd immunity 60% us already it.

A lot people living rural areas brightest bulbs, either. cannot think many actually gave crap learning went school them.

In fact several special needs class, sadly gave answers homework tests, pushed system. Exactly. Literally state overheard business owner tell story man asked wasnt making employees others wear masks... response was, ""because I'm republican that's why!""

Complete facepalm. frustrating apart politcal party personality sole backbone reasoning. Cases dropping like stone vaccination, reason.

Prior vaccination (in Nov Dec), cases surging along deaths despite lockdown. Thanks providing insight, instead guy shove German throat. I... guess? Lol That’s definitely pandemic US over. There’s good reason continue massive economic disruption virus spreading (and killing) fractional rate compared peak. 

We’re waiting full herd immunity, we’re waiting vulnerable get vaccinations. Herd immunity bonus. Archived link:  March 12th sitting room full college students email hit spring break extended. Everyone screaming other, excited, joking. fucking scared. Still everyone insisted would back two weeks. 

And look, nearly year later I’ve lost absolutely everything made life worth living. haven’t set foot campus seen people since day many never again. wasn’t supposed way. roots ‘scientific’ experiments aimed prove racial superiority Totally!

Guys let's let die. want die stupidity, let them. average IQ raise state  Perhaps supporters won’t around much longer. CDC already said published lot recommendations due political reasons, that’s one reasons CDC flip flopping around Honest question - safety = normality? followed rules, I’m personally worried catching this. worried others though extremely careful. things care - bars, concerts, sports reopen? deaths = flu average? flattening curve worked. peak March April certainly smaller could been. also allowed ventilators manufactured PPE procured hospitals. 

Two weeks flatten curve never meant two weeks stop virus. point wheels already motion. Came say same. think decrease cases seeing definitely ""herd immunity threshold"" keep mind human behavior still pretty heavily modified, thus threshold lower would required true return normal right second. Also minor correction cannot simply add 37M first dose ~100M natural immunity 37M 100M group already natural immunity. Nonetheless, crazy public perception close done covid. even need acquire true ""herd immunity"" risk vaccinated severity covid literally turns flu. many first doses today? There's rule says case. Lethality would drop less prone killing people would lead higher transmission.

SARS-CoV-2's lethality irrelevant spreads takes long kill spreads symptoms appear all. 

Meanwhile, higher viral load likely infectious likely harmful. mask mandates actually anything. still see plenty people store without masks. I'm glad like somewhere like Florida though. Legit interested. sort job? said reflected mainstream scientific thinking, fact WSJ chose cast words light politically motivated appalling. leave house? come lol. I'm going Mexico Saturday 2 weeks. I'll wear mask, though. Graphs don’t go linearly reach zero That’s point article all. study it’s describing didn’t even look reinfection!

The point people virus make stronger immune response first dose vaccine haven’t. probably CDC says vaccinated people don’t quarantine close contact COVID positive person unless showing symptoms. Pre-symptomatic symptomatic infections carry viral load asymptomatic infection. Another article goes depth next steps. give vaccine tens thousands healthcare volunteers, observe couple weeks (basically another clinical trial) vaccinating anyone else. unlikely see _any_ mass vaccinations least another month two. virtue signallers keep I'll call bluff say something like, ""you're right, I'm murderer.

Exactly. worry future media. might learn code. Seriously, reevaluate life choices here.

You're spending time spreading hyperbolic misinformation. Oh, that’s one didn’t know. Thanks source 1) it’s still good model safe behavior. I’m big parties there’s way people know I’m vaccinated not. don’t want send message vast majority Americans aren’t vaccinated yet ok go maskless. 2) vaccine isn’t 100% effective I’m fairly high risk 3) live people yet vaccinated don’t yet know if/how vaccine prevents transmission 4) I’m following recommendations pretty much every public health agency maintaining precautions even post-vaccination  New Zealand Europe study doesn’t actually anything reinfection. It’s people people previously infected antibodies wane respond vaccine. 

I actual expert viral immunology tell circulating antibodies single important factor prevent getting reinfected (though aspects adaptive immune system help respond virus faster second time). Yeah we’re hard workers entry level person experience expect make least 45K first year benefits day one. mention 6 100k+ openings everything between.  Where's lie? US correctly recognized amount lockdowns would stop disease forever, instead focused vaccines. NZ quickly learning same.  Since vaccines effective UK variant, I’m guessing Fall, people travel UK again.

Nonessential travel South Africa may longer wait though. millions people already vaccinated puzzling. Peter Daszak incredibly biased financially motivated claim anything except virus originated Wuhan Lab. fact ""face"" team appalling. Lol really don’t think understood comment all. didn’t say India worse, said India bad comparison US it’s different country reasons outlined previous comment. Maybe you’re getting confused another commenter, never brought “slums” “low standards”, definitely never called India 3rd world, think might touch conversation going here. I’ve worried we’ll see explosion depression ends. People spent nearly year hyping “normal life,” blaming pandemic everything wrong lives. return normal happens lot people may live great thought everything going day happens. It’s important people manage expectations remember life far perfect 2019. statistics disagree you, completely Indiana they’re right heart 2% unemployment bounty retail options. One reasons vaccines developed faster testing stages normally happen sequentially. example, lab tests animal tests multiple stages human tests. stages tested parallel. stage successful result saved time. Normally poses unnecessary risk, case. Man it’s fun looking back posts. Invokes memories sinking feeling realized things going shitter. fast. Feels like happened years ago. That's precisely point, people vaccinated yet. Get whole country vaccinated, advocate closing borders international travelers. Till then, disservice paying attention updates could potentially harm you. 

There's harm following protocol till vaccinated yourself.

And know, international travelers getting banned anytime soon USA, meanwhile transmissable variants keep arriving. think enjoys making people wear masks? think he's smart? think know better does? qualifications? that's incorrect way looking it. viruses stored labs may capability, won't. Everything common cold influenza viruses animal viruses incapable infecting humans ebola stored labs. Well, let's exaggerate. There's still minor issues like public education, democracy, drinking age, war drugs, incarceration numbers, death penalty, abortion laws infrastructure work on. 

But rest world migh feel inclined welcome US 19th even 20th century   Negativity sells. Canada big population people Indian descent.

It’s much calculated political move public health one. Absolutely, people make sense sometimes. Let's trust vaccines stop fearmonger. Easier replaced liquor store popcorn store People turning property isn’t “fortress” biggest reason rent high.

PS : Mean ignore new zeeland ans australia. ""west"". cam better. Toronto can't wait over! Oh shit imagine that?? Heard immunity. sub rails funny it’s working. what??? “People got vaccine likely die??” people lost jobs worked smaller businesses, jobs automated, actually good big companies comprise stock market indices. 

Also people buying tons computers phones etc., imported. obviously aid gone companies. 

And there's reason unkind people. piece shit. Fortunately mRNA vaccines make thing past plan start phasing unnecessary pandemic expenses, like streaming services, start saving post-pandemic life?

I’m thinking I’ll start either March April. Lol think USA U.K. allow travel? 

My boyfriend haven’t seen since travel restrictions March would really like something look forward go around Reddit making false claims sharing sources don’t even support bullshit arguments? You’re idiot got [rightly savaged Apple day exactly you’re now. hard find real number, official numbers falsified.

yeah reporting lies least editorializing without concrete evidence. hope right hard say. quite contagious compared current wild type young people vaccinated March (when projected become dominant US). plummeting numbers reopenings, see wave occurring primarily among younger social age groups likely ignore social distancing point. Hopefully acceptance vaccine risk high negligible effect death numbers. see. I'm mostly optimistic comes b.1.1.7. keep seeing acquiring E484k mutation begin worry bit. hopefully data mRNA vaccines handling proves robust. Adults getting vaccinated make community transmission plummet. Given relatively low risk COVID elementary school aged children, reason wait 12 vaccine life return normal. earliest could 12 vaccine 2023. need adjust expectations. That's definitely promising hear, concern still much different type strains know about. feel like likely dodged bullet far SA variant, tough say non factor number cases there. wrong girls back turn reptilian I’m CO, fun easy bartender.

It's 'redone' put it, comment misinformation. US 500k excess deaths, no, US still greatest ones get British people seem hate despise everything do. pride whatsoever. need shoot messenger. telling EU... Unfortunately true jobs. think still able get people back work, working different jobs automated. say people start throwing shit lawn call cops trespassing possibly land jail time record. watched happened foreclosure crisis 08/09 really care. country simply doesn’t care. Trust me, talk big game soon starts happening unless neighborhood rallying behind you? I’ve seen big burly grown men sobbing foreclosed repo men sheriff. mental anguish, embarrassment, shame lot work even think clearly. makes sense. Canada gun ownership popular. US lockdowns strict comparatively many nations. Plus government looks health well need ""keep toes"". post seems divorced reality tbh.

Edit: Also NZ's strategy allowed avoid lockdowned majority pandemic. They've living best lives fear free 2020/2021. appreciate optimism, us lost several family members describing time “weird” One day, poof, simply disappear “I’m tryin’ think nothin’ happens!” situation regrettable I’m sorry you’ve go that, covid-related unemployment ever affected 11-12% population. Furthermore, 11-12% population possession far less 11-12% liquidity nation. probably less 5%. 88% people workforce lose job covid. 88% includes overwhelming majority top 50% earners control almost wealth nation. people lost jobs, societally meaningful scales, already lacked monetary benefits resources things done pandemic.
.
Those wealth eat out, travel, vacation, party, etc pandemic almost still do. almost people desperate beyond measure go back things. left concern non stop conspiracy theories fake news ideal.

If see posts r/India like r/the_donald based amount fake news,stupid theories,propaganda conspiracy theories. lot people forget original goal post flatten curve hospitalizations. vaccines reduce severity COVID-19, guess people catch asymptomatic carriers also much less severe cases given low viral load... even transmission fall (unlikely; spread plummet vaccine) hospitalizations also sharply fall... wanted along (i.e., far ""nightmare scenario""). majority people vaccinated becomes moot. salt remedy coronavirus could mine account solve pretty quick  could done HELL lot better 500,000 deaths whatever it’s now. Oh, explains it. I’m always shocked expensive dental school is. Okay withdraw previous comment thank updating thought legit Feel really bad people europe suffering EUs faffing about. Nation states taken hands earlier on. Less two months? you’re talking US? That’s pretty unlikely.  One many stories. United States, 25% years infected December likely close 40% Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year superspreader events. reason news organizations report number.  Frankly accomplish much, processing capabilities would like 20x less typical gaming computer   parents became eligible debating wait Johnson &amp; Johnson... said No! eligible- go get vaccine ASAP!

Pretty sure ""didn't italy find 2019"" pushed hard them, could wrong. China knew 2019, us alphabet agencies too.. dropped ball? everyone's vaccinated matter. Probably saw others take perfectly safe 

Oh get it! Cos caused side-effects, would pretty much instantaneous, right? DAMN! PEOPLE *SMART!*

C'mon mod, day. think always knew 40-60% population going catch this, restrictions mass gathering bans put place prevent happening once, stretching 12-18 month period instead.

Encouraging hysteria always terrible, odds say you’ll probably catch point, matter many precautions take. It’s contagious.

That messaging like first 3 weeks pandemic, changed. Atlantic even wrote article last March titled “You Likely Catch Coronavirus”. Well crap yourself?  US seem fighting never ending battle people want ban things. tons people think they’re accomplishing something convincing others illegal. vaccinated matter? recognize may able vaccinated. choose get vaccine? That’s them. can’t keep things hold forever. guess take positive bury negativity. know way people like industry know people described hey I’m Midwest low unemployment low cost living. would recommend Vancouver Toronto 100 times 100 times. Toronto absolute rudest city ever visited. indifferent mind absolute rude. I've never talked someone thinks eradicate virus. Ever. 

I'm sure people continue rail strawman. evidence ""someone online said"" comfort knowledge one public health, government, medicine believes able eradicate it, sure warrants strong response I'm seeing supposed ""a lot people"" think eradication possible. 

I know never met one person believes Covid eradication mean exist, number comments seen upset supposed individuals vs actually seeing 20 0. Really sure deal is. Yellow Fever shot went either Thailand Peru, can't remember. Never felt thing, fact, I've never reaction vaccine, ever. different person person guess. “Harvard” study referring Harvard university. non-peer reviewed study posted Harvard website. eventually refuted retracted. excerpt:

The nightmare scenario, discussed small groups online campus, this: vaccines reduce severity COVID-19 transmissibility? words, vaccine takes someone would sick COVID-19, isolating home, converts asymptomatic carrier, world spreading virus like millions Typhoid Marys? we’re ones best vaccine response.

I think Israel us totally crushed % population vaccinated.  US shabby. Never seems bit harsh. time last 5,000 years could possible trust China ? handsome slick haired PM botched badly makes sad... mean lab theory? open schools. wave number 300. Time go mandatory lockdown. Remember, stay home. /s reason attributed decline? changed? done caused drop. mask social distance performed compliance months now.

Appears Germany believe needs like NZ. Surrounded Pacific ocean prevent new mutations entering. Data: Shows receding infections, accelerating vaccinations, pandemic decline.

MSM: “**B117 SZN AFRAID AFRAID**” heading towards depression Biden leading charge. 1.9 trillion debt nails coffin. Yeah, certainly blame them. lose respect see selfish behavior. go business enforce mask mandate. I'm saving lot money would gone restaurants, I'll NEVER go back them. I'm making list, actually. I'll take mild annoyance life disrupting panic day People going gathering 10 friends using savings funds vacation days they’ve accumulating years travel vacations over.

Uh, unemployed, vacation days talking about? Plus anyone gets employed again, likely want start saving again, bit shy spending money frivolously survived year limited local Applebee’s still around, 3Q 2021 2Q 2022 going best year they’ve since housing crash.

That helps Applebees bottom line, sure, bring back businesses closed. 

I've work year pandemic. Current job outlook pretty bleak. I'll lucky get back job making anywhere near money previously. I'm far alone regard. Along 775,000 Europeans. probably want surprise low infection numbers Valentine's gift. psssht, tell. realize viruses spread faster winter everyone inside, right? think problems willingness vaccinated groups, especially certain religious groups?

The UK pretty high willingness vaccinated (I think 80% even start vaccination drive) likely rise people get vaccine confidence safety/efficacy rises. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tdepends define ""finish line"". Israel clearly ahead vaccine doses delivered effective vaccine less worry variant wise. define finish line 90% adults fully vaccinated think feasible USA UK gets first (US depends many anti-vaxxers, least sense getting covid vaccines, shift views next months)  Amazing news really! “It must flouride mind control!” necessarily accurate statement though, lot people get bit runny nose covid. case jab sounds bit worse.

i.e. cannot know ""better covid"" different effects person. Gen Alpha born 2010? Millenial, feel extremely old :( work there's good amount competition, case years. Also, private roads bad business since someone could buy road prevent people accessing particular shop increasing toll something ridiculous like 1000$. Making road private bad thing. whole plan beginning? Keep up. owe 300k...paid decent chunk off. dental school. current admin going take efforts help folks they'll left fend 

Let answer you. Nope I'm expert mutation rate increase infected cases? No, previously Covid makes much likely side effects, immune system recognizes vaccine gears nuke it. Covid, fever, chills, body aches first dose. Overnight, 3more ppl know positive. completely agree. ""experts"" ""officials"" obsessing case fatality numbers every day months, seems like suddenly stopped looking them.

I think fact least 30% population infected something deliberately understanding. like chain letters Ponzi schemes, unchecked exponential growth long enough simply run people. huge waves cases like California mean huge portion population must exposed thus likely immune.

Add 15% vaccination going rapidly, new cases level late October, cases falling 50 states...

I get want cautious models wear masks save X lives forest vs. trees thing. pandemic clearly ending. Big brain destroy everything closed gyms. Super Bowl bump coming ... know read it. another kowalski disease? new cases discovered found months later testing stored samples, known time. found 100 cases via testing. 

The RT-PCR test developed Jan 12th, everyone lucky get diagnosed based clinical symptoms observant clinician. I’m sure it’s entirely related factors stated. seeing identical trend Canada, yet don’t many vaccinations many people covid here. came across one real life shocked. people literally disappointed coup attempt failed. Basically every epidemic curve US shows steep increases Thanksgiving, Christmas, finally New Years. one doesnt think US ever could controlled virus like Australia NZ did, like even Biden, Hillary president, doesnt change fact every state governor would agree full lockdown, would never happened. clarify, that's say think aiming zero covid. envious places achievable. trying imply unusual event would unusual? know exactly talking about, maybe misunderstand other. virus ""wide circulation"" December, finding many antibodies 6 months later quite consistent. least knowledge, 6 months average lifetime antibodies far. 

This observation would also consistent several early outbreaks Europe. Presumably virus context changed somewhat Wuhan that's first noticed there. hear complaining. pretty optimistic US going enough vaccine send border within couple months. definitely envision world vaccine card allows travel. That's right, Brazil underestimated 10% New York Times, far better job neighbors India probably reporting far 50%. 40-60% population getting infected according serological tests, although deaths obviously lower younger population. South lake Tahoe always nightmare. Well said!! I'm familiar r/India, would downvote positive articles country? get it. get antibodies test. People freaking ""there things we'll different while""? Already 94K 1. Japan supremely bureaucratic.
2. disastrous roll MMR vaccine killed disabled several kids 30 years ago vetting program vaccines. really saying. Don’t say that, people won’t afraid longer need depend government. dunno actually say things.

I agree lot things different Covid. surely lasting paranoia. However also renewed emphasis interpersonal relations, local businesses, work/life balance, fewer people willing put 2 hour commute go work crowded space, etc. positives go negatives. ""Hey! Teacher! Leave figures somewhere 2 - 4% 

Whereas reality, 0.16% 1.60%

You're welcome.

Now somebody ban leave place? C'mon mod, open door, I'm done here. studies fraud.

- schools Europe open windows, airborne virus that’s essential 
- testing/ tracing protocols know asymptomatic spread (Sweden specially bad aspects)
- health outcomes also comparable countries universal healthcare worst health habits 
- data last year without taking new variants contagious among children created optimal conditions contagious among kids virus thrive spread There's another reason numbers might dropping. believe wrong fewer people getting tested positive.
Everyone know Coronavirus never got tested. sick last thing want go sit testing site waiting turn told something already know. Without need medical treatment rode home. think also might want get tangled tracking system regretting risky behavior want admit to...fear government. people selfish care. Biden positive factor going forward, don’t think anyone genuinely believes vaccines given January/early Feb anything Biden. know. brother Melbourne. I'm UK. horrendous 4 months, last seen bars, concerts, cricket, going holidays. I'm denying lockdown tough. However original commenter describes surviving, living, goal posts moved, exactly we're living UK right now. Nothing essential shops open. restaurants, beauty salons, hotels. We're allowed leave local area can't see friends family unless 1 1 outdoors 2m apart. tough horrendous come semblance normal life like Victoria I'm game. Yeah month year long brain fog, unable work physically flat death ***SURE IS*** fine. 

""Be fine"" ""Mild annoyance"" direct odds know infected COVID, even among athletes looks like. Plenty 20 30 somethings dead ventilator past that. previous failings direct government policy failings specific medical institutions.
The government refused lockdown early enough, opened soon **twice**, introduced schemes like ""eat help out"" middle pandemic.

So Conversative party take credit NHS (An institution systematically sabotaged underfunded decade), abhorrent.

That's people specify NHS government. bet BA still worse. Live homelessness always huge problem. insanely control government solutions. Every unlocked public park, every highway entrance encampment. amount cars clearly people living around gated park toilets skyrocketed. Something needs give. outside local government buildings pitchforks. don’t think it’s function generation wanting lay roots much unable to. I’d love buy house stay rest life none price range haven’t long time. really strange. I've mentioned before, I've never come across people IRL. purely internet/Reddit phenomenon misinformation. South Africa halted distribution Oxford Astra-Zeneca vaccine effective South African variant. F1 driver celebrate coming first second lap? No, celebrates over. looks like we're long way that. That's I'm saying Oh god county fair CANCELED??? Death mercy compared this? 

Sounding incredibly fuckin entitled wish death this. Ask 400 thousand dead wanna switch places. Absolutely ridiculous pissing moaning. think might touch conversation going here.

You say (more less same) passive aggressive crap every conversation lmao. least little kids would vaccinated well really annoyance, elevated levels severe disease well, compared usual circulating respiratory diseases.

Also, special property ""first contagious, week later severely ill immune-mediated disease"", might make things bit complex, comparable used last decades respiratory viruses. man flu, shits real! Oh, hangovers.  would really like see coverage kinds impacts Covid lockdowns... people homeless, jobless, without purpose, lives turned completely upside upended. hear lot case counts deaths much people affected lockdowns. world would get vaccine she’s already virus?!?!? Yep cited direct quote president get downvoted. People hear want hear. even gets point vaccines rich took effectively longer work

Some pre-orders may become useless even manufactured. companies still need paid bankrupt unable make next version vaccine. Technically goes Gen Gen Beta (these kids)  That's PMI for. PMI payment ready.

If money area country maybe need lower employment standards. Sure every one wants work machine shop roll around grease day, places begging people, even without experience, paying $15-$25 hour. People like given year lives. probably tried month whatever wanted do. Peoppr continued wear mask, avoid interactions people, go essentials, actually given almost year lives. know have. figure 3.  things concern interpreting trend. first changing recommendations (?) considered positive case back 2021-01-20. much adopted US PCR tests? second fact several/many insurance companies aren’t covering tests many cases pay $100+ pocket, might contribute reduction testing discovery. Third deaths declining pace cases, even shift 2-4 weeks graphs.  Brazilian data released individual state, ofc there's gonna natural difference real number, seriously doubt there's deliberate manipulation data.  
Just president lunatic neo-con mean country comparable dictatorships oligarchies like Russia, China NK. hidden here. Encampments taken every public park. City plan except make every plot land zoned apt housing. Meaning residential house goes sale bet developer going outbid anyone build unit rentals. fucking maddening. Essencially letting land. can't see living much longer. happens cases still happen vaccinations? still shut down

No, course not. risk positive case many vaccinated comparable positive case now. would awsome too, phones apparently powerfull nintendo switch. No, world knew gone. living like forever. public health officials try force it, people ignore them. Jeeze! crazy! live? vaccinations \~51 million, combined \~30 million actual infections, likely underreported 3-4 times, we're 170 million 'immune' mark, thats 50% country. think we're long decline now, tail end SLOOOwww burn less 100 cases day. That's true. Windows/doors open example restaurants definitely recommendation US Thanks reddit downvoting last months, various estimates analyzes come many deaths China may had, talking 11k, 23k, 36k, even said 42k more

I guess one last two figures correct one, also based local news information. reported around tenth real deaths (despite probably knowing real number) absolutely criminal thing

That said, thinking China may country deaths world ridiculous (we still Usa first, Mexico second Russia third, considering excess deaths directly related covid) I'm 30s, worried death/hospital.

I'm still worried lungs, admit know yet: know, data severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) suggests many 50% people COVID-19 may lung damage. bad much impact life unclear. 

When younger, woke middle night needing nebulizer (but grew it). I'd like avoid again. It’s approximately 45 Americans believe US never aimed zero covid. botched response early think became abundantly obvious wasn’t going happen. Sure suppose can, what’s word hearing vaccines distributed? Also happens there’s non-compliance receiving vaccine? happens cases still happen vaccinations? still shut down, seems like dangerous precedent set.... people compliant willing deal lockdowns (admittedly many aren’t full) fine. vaccine received supposed 90% effective prevention, troubling

Is it? They've already vaccinated 100s 1000s, I'd say 4 good news. Avoid spreading misinformation. Cite sources. Avoid spreading misinformation. Cite sources. too, trying convert see many Americans would think pretty much everyone okay things. people problem masks people sick, business closures, rules preventing people seeing family friends, etc. small vocal minority wants things continue forever. Yeah dont tell woke population thread. They'll jump fucking cliff give facts. hell owe 200K? vast majority people skeptics comes covid vaccines. outright anti-vax. There's huge difference, need show compassion understanding skeptics. scary time, easy worry new technology administered record time. I've lot family successfully convinced every single one sign vaccination.

I sure fuck calling morons. listening, acknowledging fears anxiety, countered explanations MRNA safe, trials went quickly.


Now people actually anti-vax? think going cause us sterile turn autistic. Fuck them, waste time. Scotland we're British Overseas Territory would correct...

Scotland's full part Union, even devolved, integrated member union. 4 home nations use NHS example, whilst Falklands Gibraltar healthcare setup. Yeah, don’t think student driven. bill written conservative think tank advocates gun rights. gave dude Joliet present bill. ladyfriend got second jab yesterday. Spent night fever aches, hoping eases today.

“I keep telling myself, better Covid”

Quote night Source? don’t need CCP downvotes good thing India involved..patriots form r/India sub needful :) know multiple people twenties thirties really terrible time covid infection. long haulers means, pretty distressing illness them. also know one thirty something one fifty something long hauler, vulnerable due pre existing conditions (lung conditions one auto immune other). Hardly 99.9% ""mildly annoyed worst"" 60, wishful thinking. 30 something long hauler feeling better think took many months. 50 something still terrible fatigue, brain fog, shortness breath. infected last March April. honestly infuriating. understand choose believe garbage. 

Also, that's great many medical professionals family! dad interested learn science behind vaccines, maybe could speak one them! Lol yes is. Nobody probably knows. guess things like:


No major holidays, it’s peak Xmas/new years 

Tons people already immunity even without knowing 

Vaccines USA. wish could have. us, constant daily cases. I'm happy even feel safe enough go grocery store farmers' market. Currently, I'm waiting post-holiday cases drop last summer levels...which means still plenty dailh cases much better before. happens, allow grocery shop week morning weekday fewer people. never forget day hospital saw first covid patient. everyone talked about. News vans EVERYWHERE around hospital, blocking ambulances staff getting hospital. Fear, chaos, insanity. following week 5 cases. next thing know standing 2 new ICUs covid patients, literally can't find anywhere put patients anymore. entire bed board red, indicating isolation precautions.

Watching cases hospitalizations fall huge weight shoulders. could feel tension sadness hospital last year. Everyone fear eyes. first time year, people hopeful happy. talking want travel, restaurants want go to, big post covid party going be. pandemic made many huge buisnesses boom. ""shitty"" small ones mine matter stock market. actually mind people masking flu seasons whatever they're going store onto public transit feel well around someone sick. 

That already place lot places courtesy try get people sick. one bigoted racist one sided reddit threads I've ever seen, ignorance comments oozing hive mind thought police. Fucking unbelievable. Luckily received full water vaccination already keep mind first shot takes month plus full immunity we're ones best vaccine response

Close, Israel UK best response far (and Israel wide margin). Sorry pedantic. US response great though sure ramping  China best deny possibility. observation true, think know means ""authoritarian states better healthcare"" storyline. probably curbed one outbreak ignored many others. surprise large parts China look like India, antibody-wise. Welcome New Orleans CCP bots gonna downvote oblivion. Indian win seen CCP loss them. possible aim zero Covid vaccine available? give risk uncontrolled spread?

The US aimed zero Covid didn’t exactly pan out. idiot, virus killing people. Particularly elderly. That’s elderly first people eligible receive vaccine. results looks like help reduce transmission. opening immigration gates 

Infinite growth economy paradigm  correct, calculated IFR equal infection 0,0009 1 1000 overall age group, CDC lower. Yeah got lol believe claims 6.3%. That's based state unemployment claims. Many people qualify longer unemployment part unemployment number, fubar, collecting money now. 

Simply calculating, there's approx 200M people 18-64 years old US. best case 100% considered eligible employment. 22 million lost jobs 10%. people get vaccine severe side effects there'll doubters eventually get vaccine too.

My mom bunch teachers town live skeptical back December would talk vaccine, mom, dad, grandpa, teachers town gotten first shot least.

Our problem rural area live hospital allocated couple hundred vaccine doses *a week*. hope bigger cities extra supplies vaccines left people stop coming get able start distributing vaccine smaller communities well. Sweden! true, oddity illnesses October similar symptoms covid, known illnesses between, testing positive antibodies. CCP deliberately targeting military games contagion point. simplest explanation caught covid military games.

For theory true, would independently catch covid military games asymptomatic. That's actually less likely, especially varying rates infection early pandemic. sure using meme right there... Reinfection rare possible. article saying high percent immunity 100% msm random article reddit. Ask genocide front page think Post COVID Comedown going huge. lot people telling things ""normal"" going rush euphoria delight. 

That first night bar without mask? Great fun. next? Less. 2 months later 3-4 beers nobody gives shit anymore ""fun"" back wasting away nights dingy dive bar.

Going back office? Great! like old times. Next thing know stuck interstate traffic 40 minutes stressed ass worrying late wondering thought would ever pleasant.

I'm claiming lockdown life great grand, societal rot disillusionment happening LONG TIME pandemic, going back ""normal"" going fix gaping hole lot people have/had. average lifespan antibodies much longer 6 months. Wtf even going remember, US literally pull middle worldwide pandemic.

Or, begin proceedings to, anyway. Yeah, think great way allow trying different things little competition states get done faster. It’s actually complicated 

There building boom area (Texas) residential commercial properties due PPP basically making labor free. Builders throwing lines homes 3 months labor accounts 50% cost building house. profit.

Problem: putting empty strip malls businesses moving them. putting multi unit apartment buildings least 60% empty. building homes 20-40 time banks putting unqualified buyers low rate mortgages.

Ok happens fall PPP stops? probably built 2 years inventory last year. surplus commercial residential properties. sudden housing bubble massive layoffs construction.

2008 

It becomes systemic .... builders, banks, service industry Brazil one accurate reporting.

You can’t trust China says it’s obvious hard lockdown stopped covid tracks within month. way competing overall deaths even remotely close they’ve clean months months everyone else deaths piling up. many people think actually died Wuhan? Maybe 20,000 upper limit guess.  -5 degrees 😫  Purpose built rentals throw people time refuse renew leases. buildings change hands every quarter. rules change rent term change. lot purpose built rentals around becoming Airbnb’s well. probably around realize. pandemic basically forced life show everyone run million miles hour. whole lot people found really enjoyed slower paced lifestyle. Reality lot picked somewhat since March obviously. Pandemic ending means go back 100 mph social calendar they're looking forward it. viruses give lasting immunity. ...go 🤔 waiting Chinese totals Deaths much accurately recorded. look excess deaths match pretty closely. Obviously hard say exactly since car accident deaths down, suicides/ODs etc. Lots variables play. I'm sure covid deaths hit 1.8 mil though, would pretty noticeable. don’t get you? ALWAYS come amount cases, therefore ALWAYS amount deaths completely eradicate virus (which take years, or, likely, never happen all). accept move on. aren’t going social distancing wearing masks virus eradicated. going hospitals longer risk overcrowding. we’re done. Good that. can’t expect people quarantine week runny nose Prior Trump administration eyes ground looking sort things. deemed non essential new admin. I’ll leave Comments bein downvoted left right... assumptions Embarek true, long ccp cover outbreak epidemic? ""But can't lockdown like NZ did!!??

Yeah, why. Interesting! definitely think that's bad thing. It'll also potential case study states demand starts drop off, tiers open, etc. Biden done literally nothing change except make already implemented mask mandate? Seems legit.

A list good idea, manage change history later, often try do. reminded word deed Saturday, people government failed do: prevent bad people ruining future. Thank entertainment. Maybe one day advanced America, hopes vaccinate population slowly America is. One dream. Reminds old piece NIH director's second scenario new coronavirus crossed animals humans became capable causing human disease. Then, result gradual evolutionary changes years perhaps decades, virus eventually gained ability spread human-to-human cause serious, often life-threatening disease.

Would fascinating know first crossed. Pfizer Moderna yet licence India..I guess afraid cheap generics :) Depends state, yes see point. [maybe Snowstorm may factor too. People believe larger populations mean higher deaths there's important factors like age obesity.

The US 15% population 65 years old (50M - represent 80% deaths). obesity rate 42% general population.

China 9% 65 (126M) 6% obesity. Huh, peak covid birthday. I’m feeling pretty optimistic though, 6 family members gotten rounds vaccine awesome Lol think communism means? worries. Well reasonable Australia NZ. already zero covid, try stay there? different trying get 100,000 cases day 0. using Asian people cover image COVID article?

Feels bit controversial especially seeing raise violence towards Asian people. theories seeing drop? Agreeing crazy accusations favorite way handle them. Yep, murderer. hate old people want die. Immuno-compromised people definitely subhuman. 

I’ve done person times, one knows respond. people making insane accusations assuming don’t want called murderer, anything disprove that. show don’t care say, don’t know do. Good grief. *Is better?*

I'm anti-vaccine I'm black cable technician severe asthma, option take it.

I literally see damage caused virus firsthand everyday dat

 see families moving back parents...

I see old customers mine died...

I see homeless people area I've never.seen before...

So guys jumping joy first dose might effective, I'm risking life fiximg internet overtime, talk me.

Thanks problem 100% completely wrong. get sympathy. Media show cover nutjob barricaded house story. guy willing risk family shooting match cops. play nightly news sympathetic you. Trump President anymore... need keep repeating bullshit used spew R already 1 there. 80% people get vaccinated? There’s holes theory getting addressed.... Hopefully India copied version Pfizer Moderna vaccines coming soon AZ effective.

What point manufacturing 100,000,000's doses AZ right now? downvoted? know people expect 22 million lost jobs recovered immediately. understanding compute official statistics. Plenty times, including country Argentina, deaths officially counted months fact. country made deaths official, worldometer added them. understand treat Russia differently.

Edit: sorry, see ""Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova announced 31 percent excess mortality rate 2020 due covid-19, words 111,000 deaths. official death toll sent daily still 80,000 dead.""

So, Russia added 30 thousanf dead made official. sincerely hope non-essential workers able get vaccinated soon :( mean, didn’t hurt Current unemployment 6.3%. immediately go couple points people start going back bars, restaurants, vacations places, previously furloughed layed much staff since April/may, suddenly bring back many staff hiring new ones accommodate demand. pandemic around 3.6%. It’s even twice now, again, still going continue go down. definitely exception rule layed high paying job. comfortable average living wage 40-50K year. service workers furloughed layed make much. people working bars, restaurants, hotels barely pay bills. Flight attending little better.   India much younger US. 80% US covid deaths 65s.

Page 35 stop talking people they’re significant statistic? It’s obviously alarming, act like get Covid you’ll sure long-term issues reality. Apologies. totally right. completely misunderstood post. 22 million jobs created matter couple months? Everyone gonna become Twitch streamer? Pro-enslavement subjugation women/POC. getting downvoted hahaha Go r/covidlonghaulers I’ve seen people post reinfection positive tests number months later. Texas awhile! seal top isn’t “an open container”. it’s awesome! Legacy Media absolute panic mode right now. pandemic nearing end means less eyeballs death spiral continue brief hiatus.

I one thrilled gone, non stop fearmongering. That’s happens sports writers writing thing clue about...endless articles “surges” “surges upon surges” whatever bullshit conjur up. Last numbers saw reliable source covid deaths total 470,000+ climbing. :( Lockdowns never stopping disease forever. It’s overwhelming health care system. wear it. doesn’t mean don’t still want set fire... one responsible also resentful... Trump administration isn’t around anymore. Xi still defending them, people spread new variant christmas, breaching lockdown getting away train london lockdown That's UK actually, per capita. logistical effort immensely impressive.

It's mixture NHS, military private sector.

The govt knew NHS able handle cold storage -70C (and thing slowing countries). contacted Boots Superdrug, experts moving cold storage medicine, gave contracts distribution.

The NHS GPs splendid actually jabbing people receive doses. military medical corps splendid pop-up jabbing Lichfield Cathedral, Salisbury Cathedral, Birmingham mosque etc.

Fantastic co-operation concerned. ok, freedom, liberty much better. like freedom without guns. Starting rebuttal thorough experiment ""I had"" ""I know someone who"" going get laughed away. called anecdotal evidence. actual rich people know getting tests weekly basis back tests unavailable unless documented encounter someone already tested positive (I trust see logical problem there.) happening elite sports circles.

If preference whole thing, I'd hate see one would look like. shit might convincing 2020. entire last year sacrifice elderly. best guess retreat indoors, school starting, communal activities. idea. Conservatives: ppl say bcuz vaccinations.

me Conservatives: ppl say bcuz vaccinations.

me  Correct. Oceania. Thank pointing out. Streaming services? Honestly, probably never... bunch friends rely accounts various sites pretty insignificant expense help out.

I canceled FreshDirect getting 2nd vaccine dose, I've saving money I'm spending commuting for... whatever plan shit back normal, could range going vacation selling house moving apartment. Cases national level going faster rate ever before. million+ people get vaccine every day rate could still increase. Covid's done. might still around, 40 4th quarter. trials currently underway 12. Astra Zeneca even announced trial 12. unlikely available US. guess it’s conceivable something might available 2022 can’t start clock there’s sort trial announcement. feeling get State officials, coworkers, random passers-by people ""done coronavirus"". They're tired hearing care anymore. People going sporting events, bars, etc. they're wearing masks part (at least area). wear mask public get dirty looks everybody. seen videos people wearing mask assaulted they're trying protect themselves.

I never leave house without mask on, really wonder efforts good whatsoever. seems majority Americans least live would rather everyone get sick people going die die, move selfish little lives. It’s hard time testing person got potentially infected unknown Well, I'm expert I'm trying say people save reinfection here. Obviously higher antibody titer protect better reinfection. look like people measurable antibodies still form protection. comment aimed doomsdayers saying would protection waning majority recovered patients — 11 17 — longer antibodies, 17 showed strong immune response first shot normally witnessed second.

This sound good. stronger reaction despite antibodies anymore. Looks like body still remembers despite antibodies, wrong here? Yeah think going see lots people US reaction. going hold take J&amp;J. problem people would likely take J&amp;J already really give crap restrictions anyway they're going rush get vaccine. long short done almost entirely MRNA. highly confident we'll see story says end. think biden administration starting come conclusion. ""licking ass"" saves lives keep licking. Source? kinda wish spent last 11 months coma. Pretty sure stress alone shaved years lifespan lol anti-lockdown sentiment since people sick lockdowns afraid virus anymore (either vaccines, lower cases / hospitalizations / deaths, learning actual risk it). brigaded. seems year end sight people getting sick contradictory restrictions ineffective lockdowns.

People want lives back deaths old people, see continue suffer long old people vaccinated.

I huge lockdown restriction supporter last year I'm also sick it. Never ending restrictions lockdowns never solution. vaccine. need get people effectively direct rollout. Come lick ass Justin  Maybe competent POTUS help deal problem.

Which seems true little time. Conservatives: watch ppl gonna say cuz vaccinations.

me Probably is, person age 50 age 16  still somewhat open question imo even likely not. seems likely people trust first ones successfully first shot. long run skeptical we'll boosters every year, perhaps every 3-5. still somewhat open question imo even likely not. seems likely people trust first ones successfully first shot Wow! Biden it! crazy sonofabitch it! Yeah nobody cares poor, jobs lost, fake, everyone staying home working...

/S Wouldn’t mainstream scientific thinking also agree truly independent review board wouldn’t include biased Dr? least cite source truth things played out. I’m even suggesting anything nefarious reads like he’s investigating team / coworkers. trust that? world absolutes.... sure. that’s world live in. California decimated lockdowns. death per 1M slightly better Florida. open. restrictions. Businesses alive. California ruined. Mass exodus people California. Go ahead loom up. 

A virus gonna virus. 

Lockdowns overwhelming proven effective locking down.  Pfizer upgrading factories next 2 weeks order increase supply, supply next 2 weeks think public sentiment actually shifting reach one-year anniversary restrictions reflect given year (quite lot) versus gained terms averting deaths ""gaining control"" disease (seemingly relatively little). Wonder NZ well? What? NYT actually good journalists China. Daszak mad someone called clear bullshit.    really. people going need booster shots every year, helping learning technology getting approval quickly make booster shots needed. know, whole bunch good news; read see news hospital workers people general refusing get vaccinated.Up 30 percent.
I hope 70 75 percent country get vaccinated creates much manageable virus/ medical emergency. Sorry, see now, dude, anyways, hope guys recover get back track soon, clients mostly come US need job back. Also right, US India compared India governments resort techniques seen human rights violation, US even EU know, think blame authority here, given sheer number people here, could gone way way worse us. guys way freedom, owning guns stuff human rights shit, whereas common Indian spends day get life, paying attention governments saying. Shame see Dr. Gottlieb join new normal 6 feet wearing masks forever crowd. reasonable long, looks like he’s reading tea leaves 15 minutes fame up. “Big water comin get ya” key point too! point key you!

SARS-CoV-1 infection gave detectable immunity 12 years later.   death rate catching 1.1-2.2% world

World: 2.2%

US: that's confirmed cases subreddit brigaded late?

I noticed lot anti lockdown sentiment lately makes hard read. pandemic subreddit point see quite negative comments. Reinfection proven easily sequencing proven. sure mean. creative writing headline. god. 😂 Hha holy shit. Trudeau pathetic, licking India's ass hoping get vaccines.

How end situation? flip side actions saved lives many Americans. People going quit caring get back living lives anyways. There’s life avoiding one virus, everyone limit long they’ll put restrictions. 

Unless new variant Captain Trips, social end pandemic coming sooner rather later. said trial. 

yknow. make sure safe others? Participating medical trial one least selfish acts there. 16 year olds vaccine trials selfish making sure classmates get vaccine months, they’re healthy someone risk might need *that* dose more? seems like Zero Covid common sentiment among healthy 20-50 year olds actual vulnerable populations even experts. Yes, know 2 close, 4 total extended network. people May-July last year. lot friends healthcare seeing reinfections timeframe also, it’s uncommon one whatever strict testing meet WHOs criteria it. Huh? feel pretty good grasp reinfections. 

We know 7% don’t mount proper response reinfected. 

So, reinfections that? completely odd headline.  understand Russia corrected official numbers, they? wtf togo cocktail? whole point cocktail made fresh drunk immediately.depending ingredients taste bad consumed within minutes. March 13th last day person school 2019-2020 happens, extremely rare uncommon US several variants already. let ""fear porn"" news get you.  son law 25 years old fit policeman, reinfected last week - second bout much worse first. Everything ends. HIV longer death sentence Don’t let speed bullet trains fool you.

They still use fax machines listen music CDs. Username checks simple entitlement. 
If everyone could life changing humble experience realize good it.

Can't fix stupid suppose. Western PA. California, closed 11 months already, cases deaths rate Florida Yes. usually reticent using case count indicator, drop big. Something good must happening According article, mildly implies CDC doesn’t want recommend don’t want encourage travel. I’m waiting for, defines return normal, reunited guy given waiting me...yet. zinc known inhibit virus replication anyone know someone personally reinfected? I'm tired seeing stuff said without real concrete scientific evidence. article, told believe something can't proven science. Great. know making first positive result. someone would that, far every time read something like eventually says something like one ""but blah blah blah can't proven because..."" need redo US trial start thrown protocol serious adverse event UK took long explain FDA. People missed second dose.

The trial paused unpaused, trial continued. new trial. current US trial contains small group delayed second doses due said pause.

It redone. US trial 'redone'. believe could please link sources claim. know easy look someone's post history silly. know believe that. 🏖️ End year, stop spreading false info. take immunosuppressants, really get minor colds, they're always awful. Maybe that's think others potentially exposing them.


So yes, exceptional circumstances, I've never left property known infectious illness. I've definitely never gone work ill. Late Q2 early Q3 2021. person replied lot concise reply. 

Yours' flat admits data might coincidence rather correlation equal causation (greater gender ethnic diversity corporate leadership doesn’t automatically translate profit), correlation indicate companies commit diverse leadership, successful. 

The statement immediately following seems show level cherry picking data, conclusive evidence assertions subtext.

 question data whether companies would succeeded even completely homogeneous one ethnicity/race, like entire company Cherokees, Eastern Slavs, would nearly successful? education people driving factor, people backgrounds access education even 20 years back?

If there's data proves point, I'd happy, however, sure read accept it.

 reiterate, I'm questioning source spirit intellectual development, ""hating diversity"". Currently we're new normal, old normal come, it'll while, late 2021/early 2022 sure though felt little funny sore arm first dose moderna vaccine. I’m expecting flu like symptoms second dose means working. soon opportunity get vaccinated, please it. experience nowhere near bad virus itself. Thousands people across US every day struggling breathe ventilator. permanently lose sense taste smell. HUGE proportion Indian descent like country hates Modi...

Trudeau's response really confuses times Yeah, mRNA's going cure aging make us immortal too. Alright we’re going back old normal. Even feel people never leave house again. ingrained paranoid ends, won’t break spell. Let tell 70 year old mother love much. 

‘Mom. get Covid, I’ll fine. pass you, good chance hospitalized possibly dying alone hospital. I’ll okay!’ Common sense people find reasonable? pandemic shows anything, distinct lack common sense reasoning ability people exhibited (well, basic compassion others). Even booster every year like flu vaccine, would problem? positive news, sure. new virus introduced daily lives, things change never fully go back *exactly* way were. Imo merging previous understanding normalcy understanding virus us, ideally less harmful capacity due widespread vaccination measures. Lmao you’re insane Https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations Wow, realize bad. Good luck all. fearful horrible future long actually take recover.

I affected 2008 crash well, time got nice buyout company (in Detroit, automotive engineering), ended work longer expected, two kids hit, wife died, complicated matters too. find good job eventually. recovered couple years ago myself, best rebuild retirement savings.

Then company changed owners early 2019, laid half salaried work force, basically gave ultimatum accept transfer facility 100 miles away lose job. accepted transfer want lose job right away, managed work cubicle months forced quit late summer 2019. Thought I'd take months spend kids unwind, make sure oldest son transferred middle school ok, started looking work early 2020 COVID hit.

So that's life story, lol. could say shits. Right someone suggesting limiting restaurant capacity prevent spread flu people would fight too, rightfully so. Again. It’s matter weighing much money vs many lives. So, math back January converting covid deaths Sorry, English native language, mean number vaccinated people developed severe COVID reduced 92% compared unvaccinated people. Drinks made someone else hit different. 75% asymptomatic. Much likely least one would symptoms, someone near develop symptoms, group dozen different countries. Virtually every vaccine prevents transmission, excepting small percentage people don’t achieve required immune response (efficacy vaccine 95%).

While conclusive studies yet performed (they’re starting to) vaccine, reason believe different! Remember biometric government tracking IDs tried push early 2000s? bet it'll that. Carry electronic Id around thats linked yourself. Scan places go let in. Absolutely nothing terrifying right? Government wanted years perfect excuse reminder vaccination #s lower week due winter storm (s)..... politics took year kinda investigation first place. 45 feet 22.5 americans US spent entire year claiming Chinese ""hiding truth"" corrupted, also denying problem hiding truth situation US.

The utter hypocrisy position made anything US said coronavirus utterly worthless. politicised whole thing day 1.

China US bad other. Fuck them. good. I'm saying shady stuff, think many opportunities get worse offenders ignored. mean might mask mandates capacity limits, life still look New Zealand. seriously hope facetious. Many generations sacrifice significantly 20’s one.  require wearing masks socially distance 1+ years seems hardly onerous. lost income, I’m heart broken for, complain able party, I’m dumbfounded. No. cycle threshold tests reduced January. Why? It’s readily known immunity natural recovery wildly fluctuates person person, even amongst severe case whatever reason little CD+4 8 cell activity; manufacturers mRNA vaccines clearly stated don’t know long efficacy last one injection recommend it. I’m saying you’re wrong necessarily, though heavily question it, I’m saying based little scientific data. mention 4 studies, let’s see data. long study, many people, severe original infection, ages participants, long study run? don’t want know government feels right thing do, want hear science is. got covid mid jan showed mild symptoms tested negative (twice) early Feb ok/safe get vaccine week? Also anecdotal experience vaccine affects people recently recovered covid? I’m afraid of. expect cases go early , I’m fully expecting wave spring break people think reach kind herd immunity vaccines already positive cases. must campaign absolutely everybody (in world) gets vaccinated. That’s way. Remember also need solve younger 16 group new vaccine reinforcement new variants (maybe one shot one). least state, urban counties cases absolute numbers terms per capita case/death numbers, urban counties nearly best. disingenuous say ""vast majority"" cases cities acknowledging majority people live cities too. locking whenever cases detected supposed good thing? people know long haul symptoms women men? US situation constant restrictions

Depends state. restrictions. Well, many people family friends 60s don’t want see dead. even mildly annoyed Covid, I’ll annoyed 60 year old parents aunts/uncles hospitalized dead. Often seems like bit embellishment. Quick question: woman? username really suits vaccinated 70s people can't take it, yet plan possibly booked in, vast majority 70s it. Take rates well 90%, high 99% according reports. happens people’s jobs lockdowns?

The good news NZ locks relatively less time. remember reading tested 300 people. think key point though next group still responsible large proportion hospitalizations even much less deaths Oh, got it. soapboxing. 

Odd use time, you. Two virologists: Theodora Hatziioannou Paul Bieniasz studying HIV/AIDS Rockefeller University pivoted SARS-CoV2 pandemic hit, studying antibodies produced response SARS-CoV2. seeing mutations associated new variants (B117, E484K, etc) since early pandemic, low proportions. think rise incidence ""new"" mutations reaction increasing immunity, question whether variants transmissable. True also China issues.  chance happening extremely low. I’m saying doesn’t happen mind you. mid Jan atleast. we've ordered far AZ Pfizer likely time goes percentage drop. True even made TRUMP DEFEATS COVID [commemorative coin memorialize event... Oh wait wanted make money base. 25yo friend mine bedridden emergency runs bathroom week. time, would admitted hospital, right surge he’s L.A. recovered fully, aunt uncle (40 44) died left three daughters aged 6-19 behind.

This anecdote simply representative experiences millions people. I’m frankly *amazed* 86yo mother (dementia, diabetes) didn’t get it. got first dose Pfizer week ago. Also include: US world's longest international land border, Canada 8,890km. border Mexico 3,141km.

And always, NZ AU islands far mainland. colleague works major US city detected SARS-CoV-2 stored samples taken wastewater treatment facility December 2019. They're working testing older samples now. 

Covid clearly circulating well beyond Wuhan late 2019. People panicking yet. Yeah respawn every implementing restrictions weeks goes away definitely preferable US situation constant restrictions *and* raging pandemic. title make sense. say 92% reduction severity.  25% population covid, vaccinated 15 million (another 25% ish) given cases young vaccines old much overlap there. maybe 40% country already way immunity, immune get. Apologies link Hebrew, English soon follow. 

This study novel because: 

1. first large scale study using real world data matched populations. 
2. shown fantastic decrease severe disease, something original Pfizer study unable due low power. , scientists confident still prevent severe cases

I'm sure that's true, failed South Africa 19 vaccine arm got infected 22 placebo arm. hard imagine gets People overly obsessed efficacy %

Huh? anything, numbers ""preventing death"" wide error bars get wildly overhyped. getting downward trend seen clearly right shenanigan's election fiasco. watched documentary went detail it, wish could find again. explained use community based approaches controlling/monitoring illness, actually pretty amazing ppe standards place ebola, older people stay home/young people bring necessities, already used avoiding physical contact. Etc etc..

It's pretty amazing see well ""third"" world dealing it, considering lack hospitals, medicine, general education it. countries africa real problems ones American ideals. Maybe certain states everywhere US. lot states still first phase vaccine millions risk states still need first dose, least 3 weeks second dose. 13 million people gotten doses vaccine Except AU NZ ZeroCovid. respawned.

It keeps this. don’t need fast. haven’t secured substantial amount vaccines, back line countries besides USA, UK, EU countries, Israel, local production. Basically research done shows us follow guidelines minimal transmission within school. lot kids going full time person school since august (my children included) study study shows safe (with masks etal), especially younger kids. don’t think it’s safe open rest schools, opinion based emotion science.  died sepsis caused two underlying conditions already had. covid. death certificate. can't way current international travel vaccinations? interlinked electronic system World Health Organization currently Wuhan announce scientific community known six months -- coronavirus originate China. hard see play out. 

They've already announced lab origin coronavirus. Next, they're going announce virus originate China, circulating outside world months first cases showed Wuhan. they're going announce virus circulating, undetected, United States since mid-2019. they're going announce scientific evidence points United States likely origin coronavirus. they're going challenge US government transparent like China allow enter US conduct investigation virus origins. US allow in? Ever wonder Trump became hostile cut funds threatened scientists arrest set foot US soil?

Among first cases US outbreaks Virginia Maryland Heatherwood Retirement Community Greenspring Retirement Community. e-cigarette vaping illness also covid-19, vitamin e acetate misattributed cause one knew new virus time. circulating long undetected reason cases country world. see argument, concern imperfect immunity could put selection pressure toward escape mutations, don’t mind squashing things highly effective vaccines know lots people situation born raised here. death rate case rate FL

They're talking lot domestic vaccine passports go shops stuff. doubt young still go work vaccined able go work think great news! Freedom main problem, years already!

Last fall guys (I'm US) opened much quickly conditions then. time around open fast compared conditions now. lots differing opinions estimates exactly situation is, principle same. end we'll see infection rate responds changes policy agree accepting numbers coming back changing restrictions accordingly need agree estimates going in. Also half million people died, knows many breadwinners among those, death pushed families orphaned kids. Imagine seeing headline April 2020 thinking actually good news directly mind please r/whoosh Even reach ZeroCovid, keep way? New Zealand lockdown 3 cases now. Altough ZeroCovid nice theory, see way countries make work. dated statistic last summer, economists figured would lose 50% small businesses pandemic ran summer 2021 

Closing many small businesses send massive ripples real estate supply chain. work oil field services tell boom/bust type cycle. Right running 4 crews used run 24 summer 2019. 

There aren’t magical green jobs sprouting future guys skill sets build wind farms install solar panels. guys can’t Amazon delivery routes Uber drivers. industry take 4 years recover like always. price oil skyrockets welders pipe fitters might still here.

The government need come plan put people back work force. talk people lost jobs 2008 took 10 years recover. got back feet covid hit. 

I’m talking plumbers electricians, people turn wrenches living essential every day life. faith good people government look them.

I want see something Oh dang fr lived MN CO. Loved wandering MoA weekends. I've read viral load study, pretty damn terrible design, data absolutely dogshit (the researchers however amazing!).  
They took PCR results positive 60+ old Israelis (which age group vaccinated first), compared positive results younger Israelis (which age group vaccinated later), looked Ct.

 actually directly compare vaccinated un-vaccinated, access data! 

The fact managed pull statistically significant result mess pretty impressive, I'll wait see stands peer-review. sure investigated hotel room. quarantine month? likely okay even somewhat less 70% due natural infection largely protective UK strain. saved us covid! He’s hero! do...I know couple people infected summer reinfected 6 months later. surprised see sub much CCP propaganda, saw comments lol. got Covid, deduced one dining found person got it, got another regular. said done 20 us got place, one us contact traced. Chicago, we’ve testing sites due freezing weather... positive case South African variant. It’s mess Eh sarcasm necessarily translate well internet, someone could easily said thing said complete (factually incorrect) seriousness. literally examples several weeks ago.

At point two weeks want deny data states dropped restrictions several weeks ago.

It clear convinced mask mandates useless even cases drop Montana 2 weeks. Lead carrot stick Software engineers normally lie illogical side things strangely enough. Eh, average income colorado around 25% higher national average. Denver major city yes prices high average rent comparable ""non discript"" city colorado like say Colorado springs, find different. 

Especially consider minimum wage almost twice federal minimum wage. (Still livable)

Also...colorado isnt midwest. there's people like seem thrive misery. like leaving house? see reason take we're contractually obliged population vaccinated. using gdp per capita Africa reference, anything wrong that? Perhaps read carefully next time.

I quote stats find funny I’ve seen wayyy many Indian shills telling India superpower “Just two weeks”! Gotta sell clicks. one falls antibody drop articles anymore, reinfection new scary. gets old ""this new strain may render vaccines ineffective"". mean apple juice may render vaccines ineffective, study saying doesn't. Taking wait see approach. I'm rooting particular political outcome. healthy trajectory.

Will follow data circumstances placed. take good news without getting hopes tbh Wanted fact check you’re wrong, Alabama currently ranked 44th terms % ppl received first dose Ok let’s keep masks forever policy maker expects make zero covid reality.

Then Australia New Zealand doing? Well, EU *didn't* cut vaccine exports Canada, Serum Institute¹ India exporting vaccine doses decent clip. Also, Covax program *is* sending vaccine world.

I'm sure, US probably one countries exporting vaccine. Even EU/UK dispute Oxford/Astra-Zeneca UK sending *enough* fast enough.

As I've said before, important get whole world vaccinated quickly possible, less important gets jabbed first. think outside politicians, people realize that, even anxious get vaccinated².

¹ Largest vaccine manufacturer world, IIRC.

² Excluding anti-vaxxers similar course. point UK allow AZ export vaccines? News flash; 95% damn near 100% like claiming want. easily deal again, mention outbreaks become less less frequent. close half year since last one. still acting like bad minor outbreak, like means control like everywhere else. data majority actually Pfizer. end January 6.6 million Pfizer 3 million AZ, although agree shifting towards AZ quite rapidly. long?


Forever? Florida? Hahahah. don’t even give real numbers. Florida joke! Also, warm year round function outdoor seating indoor seating windows open everywhere. Try Midwest. Another gift know who. nation, USA, infrastructure waver change political wind makes Chinese argument unassailable. 

To pretend take backs, King's X, refusals address prior political mistakes presents ugly misanthropic people, untrustworthy matter political claim.

The US wears albatross around neck, China, others less bold, hold say, ""Look"".

The search facts case caked mud know who. world hurts. likely January year classic symptoms illness antibody test positive months later...

I always believed around far earlier. Interesting see theory gain traction - never buy anything CCP's selling, sell deceit. (And evil.) BBC spreads propaganda Chinese TV doesn't? Lol, lost credibility I'm going debunk rest (and allowing tributes one doctor social media make free social media site - there's reason Twitter blocked there).

The thing is, even America secretive China was, matter investigating America China, China that's transparent US delaying investigation year, still handling crucial data.

Best part one bringing America nothing said original comment debunked. non-vaccinated benefit greatly vaccinated. every one opt in, long get 70% winner. bodes well one-dose J&amp;J vaccine getting widespread use. knew efficacy shortcomings masks year ago, everything else molded sculpted public messaging order affect compliance.

...except part they've **ALWAYS** worn hospital settings? dentist? surgery? oncology wards? Appreciate it! Read OP comment next time responding. Claiming Biden done nothing except implement mask mandate completely false Nice! Meanwhile Germany: &lt;2 millions .... setting heartbreak, dude. 

The long story short is, China's scientists first detected outbreak, stable genius Trump decided go all-out attack science came in. according stable genius reasoning, whoever smelt it, dealt it, right? bad news happened -- science came in. United States facing mother embarrassments.

It's going come out. biggest open secret US right now. government scientists know, government officials, senators representatives, members media, mention World Health Organization. able keep secret much longer. comes out...fasten seatbelts. Exactly, name-calling ppl idiots ignorant itself.

Ppl trusting big companies government----Can blame them?
Humans survival instincts, distrust survival reaction. (Totally normal human behavior)

Educating solid information help calm distrustful thoughts. time, people get program. 

Forcing people inject questionable ""unknown"" serum answer. I'm skeptical actual cases dropping. believe moment. sure get downvoted antibodies: exposure vaccine people previous infection make lot quickly. That's belief cells recognizing infection, mostly memory B cells float blood stream bone marrow actually make antibodies. 

Cellular immunity important cost effective way measure directly. sure? Thats everyone assumes stats saw way around. evidence hand assume AZ without stats.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think shows that? Dude legit stalker. Wait starts tagging things photoshopping name stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I recommend reporting main Reddit reporting tool, subreddit specific one. exports allowed then? surprisingly UK gov exporting vaccines bought.

You realise facilities UK capable producing vaccines? countries companies invested facilities would free export output. thought usual US angle restrictions draconian they're killing everyone's livelihood though. better everything running 100% fine rather control spread plus restrictions people seem even accept reasonable? gets old ""this new strain may render vaccines ineffective"". 

Those already circulating, people sub freaked it. Right, protect getting blood substances getting faces anc protecting patients doctors sneezes whatnot. 

Not protect airborne virus. Andromeda Strain haha Ding ding ding, get it!!! Viral load Well keep mind also worst weather related storm systems. knocked ability test state alone last month. can't get test see numbers. fooled low case count right people. Till get April better weather really know things going. I'm willing bet cases still high higher see them. think middle summer states high levels immunity vaccine adherence we’ll seeing close zero covid like everywhere else then. Fuck China Fuck paid China Dude I’ve sub Reddit Chinese bots ccp fanboys lurking downvoting anything critical CCP. Bloomberg article bots social media platforms putting comments posts rug bad dumb liberals (unfortunately right doesn’t fare better) actually believes word CCP fanboys say. counting help us? fail realize GLOBAL pandemic LOCAL one. Countries like US UK hoarding vaccine, poor countries looking getting vaccine 2023. cannot achieve herd immunity without everyone else. Check privilege, you’re group isn’t US. reach ZeroCovid, keep way? New Zealand lockdown 3 cases now. Altough ZeroCovid nice theory, see way countries make work.

Once get population vaccinated imported cases get far start zero. lol fucking guy likely okay even somewhat less 70% 

Especially given already exposed. They're still vulnerable newer strains, Maunaus guide, suspect whatever antibodies still enhance overall herd immunity, even something less 70% make way mess. reaction first Moderna shot: fine first day, fever topped around 100.5, sore arm, headache day. completely back normal day later. 
I covid, least far know. Wondering intense 2nd shot side effects be! Despite side effects I'm excited fully vaccinated. 13th dui 9th speeding tickets...we also pull TON people. 

I means speed queen years would get speeding ticket every 6 months like clock work. also pulled tags ""were expire"". Even test driving car sales guy put temp plate wrong place (yes wrote ticket, literally said ""we quotas hit""). also pulled late night multiple times eastern plains ""check ad make sure things ok"" (I assume suspected someone city near boarder must driving weed boarder. seemed pleased saw dogs clearly road trip). 

I'm saying drinking driving isnt issue isnt important. moved Michigan college 0 friends ever DUI MIP everyone drinking driving. solid 50% highschool friends MIPs graduated. never pulled 4 years lived Michigan. dont pull people over, dont DUIs. learned risk factors pandemic really lucky I’d never gotten flu risky condition. Also doctor said he’d normally recommend pneumonia vaccine knew age would bunch extra insurance hassle passed it. I’m paying attention. I’m going taking proactive steps like masking flu season. I’m 15+ years getting flu vaccine least wasn’t idiot didn’t know dangerous could been. China care world's health. care pocket books. They're sheer capitalists heart would rather kill couple thousand citizens secret preserves ""image"" safe technologically advanced place business. West learn slave-like dependence China. Sure, cheap electronics &amp; clothing makes us feel rich, there's larger price pay long run. talking about? Huge tech made WFH permanent months ago, news. I'm ""huge tech"" moved HR calla ""hybrid"" model permanently basically means come office un less really to. However, per capita, Russia would country deaths with

If we're using excess mortality false. number 0.32% Peru. article comparing excess mortality US Russia tested mortality every assume mean last year? already admitting looked data claimed virus pose risk people age groups, opinion everything else irrelevent here. please come back properly educated “Beep boop Trump?” “He president anymore” “...beep boop Trump?” think reports say effects fertility actually covid, long term. (Same thing happens lot viruses) lol you’re saying China trustworthy? You’re absolutely zero doubt integrity possible compromise regarding researchers? That’s naive matter whether vaccination happens fast enough, vaccines remain effective variants, people maintain adequate precautions prevent contagious variants taking hold. either nip bud, become whole new, even worse wave. yup. people age groups dying facing long term health problems rates far higher flu ever posed them.

guess looked data? Ohio already it’s best thing come virus  CDC Updated again.

50,641,884 reported yesterday...

52,884,356 reported Today...

2,242,472 doses administered 1 UK's plan (currently) give everyone one jab. 3 months later give everyone booster. doubt coincidence 3 months approximately time required vaccinate 50-million adults UK. UK 3 months something approximating herd immunity works.

Most countries boosters 3 weeks. end 3 months half adult population first jab. means still risk lockdown reduced early.

Remains seen UK strategy works. scientists want see results longer committing time line reopen. Yes like earn money, says we’re making money right now? Jan Feb worst restaurant industry. done studies interviewed industry, found people dining terrible customers don’t tip well. I'm happy them. absolutely wrong there. states need vaccine, help. hope look back disdain people locked home bragged social life personality trait worth having. two months late. already discussion. Two week quarantine level masking restrictions same. stayed inside every risk gone. We’d never move this... I've reading account. aware comments aligned. Peace.

Just waiting see situation ends revealing.

I aware convinced masks nothing = bad outcomes.

I taking wait see mode situation exist in. let results others determine outcome specific situation.

I'm actually argue. state's governor decided do. Without consultation anyone involved medical field. *Yes confirmed.* happened. done. One way another cultural situation state exists live life.

What unhealthy wait see attitude?

I get it. fear disease. unconcerned. posts appear quite nonchalant. worrisome thing far scrolled could find posts account dealt anything related covid. Maybe scroll far enough?

Can end now?

If need get last word - please do. *Alanis Morressette drives shakes head sympathy* impact needs talked more.

Nobody know seriously affected. Jobs fine, nobody seriously sick, without outside context really seem like weird year WFH. People like never feel safe Covid. would suggest seeking mental health professional. World returning normal seem stuck. going downvoted propaganda bots don’t care. true world economies going line fuck China. China barely feed population right one already find affordable labor India, Vietnam Philippines. Huge mega corporations already begun move part supply chain away China due labor costs, going accelerate much faster. 

Imagine could Chinese government would tried honest... imagine families who’s lives wouldn’t changed worst due death... mine included. vaccine probably never going released. join Pfizer, Moderna CureVac develop manufacture vaccines future mutations absolutely clue getting downvoted lol China definitely lied Covid deaths. way US. straight locked people homes military patrols ensuring people didn’t leave reasons. call response authoritarianism you’d right. limited spread death. testing sites mostly shut due freezing temps 🙃🙃but like... indoor dining doesn’t spread inside. Mk No, different study. AZ export vaccines. UK's supply AZ vaccines finished UK, production numbers relevant geographies No, behaves exactly way: infecting cells simple code makes create prefusion forms spike protein released blood. sure weird go drug store see Nyquil ""Perfect cold, flu, covid!"" say actions pandemic represent best US would understatement. time, China proud. earlier SARS outbreak, little openness early stages might helped lot countries (although US would likely taken advantage advance warning). risks think vaccine healthy people? Cause it’s basically zero ""May"" ""Could"" sentence. I'll wait research results :) replies comment say all. take pressure countries Japan starts making vaccine. Hard lockdown, nobody unless *absolutely* necessary. reach 0 cases way, whenever case pops throw whole country lockdown again. Rinse repeat next 10 years. probably f'd-up misleading title I've ever read sub. time reconfigure production lines, vaccine ready anyways seasonality disease, even country cases lowering vaccines could cause almost like changed leadership something.... reality though case counts continue crater even places strain prevelant. Thank God live U.S. this. great see great restaurants NYC Chicago re-opening indoor dining. Enough enough ""lock down"" business. right nice porter house steak glass fine red wine. think time ""Grandma"" stay home. everyone wants vaccine one. US, Israel, etc... Lol. Good luck that. China going walk world next 50 years. revisionist history dude. accidentally left comments we’re aggressive got automatically removed mods. guess that’s line accidentally leaving good math data original dumb argument least.

I literally showed first three comments chain. thing ""left out"" fourth comment, response *you* calling *me* ""dumbass"" saying ""bad math logistics,"" ""pulling stuff ass"" ""can't listen people smarter me."" started first condescension first comment. trying blame starting it.

Except one showed anything. even read data sourced, supported *my* conclusion, yours. *opinions* based know, whenever anyone presented anything respectfully, respectfully told grow learn mistakes, you’re meeting hostility burying head sand.

Hell, Netherlands US' equivalent 60k much less vaccines. speaking bar industry? us wanting waiting you. News flash. People dining typically Covid hoax believers anti mask people, either don’t tip tip super shitty. Also, United States industry workers petitioned wanting serve customers get vaccine. That’s unreasonable since DINING job people take MASKS OFF! fact NZ Australia way less densely populated surrounded fucking water might helped bit too. wild guess though since people seem ignore this... number people phones much larger people gaming computers. |I don’t care “suggested benchmarks”. care scientists saying transmission schools.

The scientists (CDC) telling go hybrid/all-virtual. use studies, too, fact 20% positivity rate city means enormous amount spread, people dying needlessly, (KC) under-testing, (KC) exact reason thing continue drag reason.

I appreciate links... used CDC, here's another 500,000 people Princeton: link trade day; there's plenty conflicting stories
/ studies go around. end day, rely scientists sort make determinations/guidelines own. studies may peer-reviewed, may large sample size, may taken context, etc. scientist, I'm pushing agenda... rely CDC bodies scientists give broader picture instead cherry-picking handful articles match world view. set bar kinda low intentionally raised 150 million, I'm also hoping gets crushed.  cant find figure give source - BBC news said less 5% refused, think Vietnam also people await test results covid hotels, regardless whether showed symptoms. Controlling asymptomatic carriers made huge difference. clarify, article britons think *Covax* vaccines go, vaccines. 

Covax WHO’s program try supply worlds poorest countries vaccines, rich countries failed adequately prepare tried succeeded drawing essentially charity aid mission (Canada already drawn early Covax supplies, eu angling some)

what survey saying uk residents dont believe rich countries taking vaccines specifically earmarked poor countries, vaccines bought rich countries diverted  trying insinuate originated Italy? people need told think. know states Illinois always plan shut things open etc. Based positivity rate many hospitals etc. Exactly. I'll take days feel like shit vs permanently losing taste smell. Ive before. fun fair criticise government, can't really post stuff like without acknowledging fact country vaccinated people world. unlimited amounts vaccines available. US better lot countries terms vaccinations. Canada given 1 million doses, US given 50 million. Sure want complaining much? country massive. Israel given 6 million doses. That's 80% less US.  might submit original source. many nation states opted sort things themselves? don’t know that. Look much trouble Johnson Johnson manufacturing vaccine issues AstraZeneca scientific studies. Pfizer done much better comparison. agree, hardest part course developing BioNTech recognized that. get that, could argue (as devil's advocate) try hard influenza future unmitigated rarely kill 500k people year US vaccinate measles, mumples, rubella children less likely die healthy; even die significant overall number. short sided approach means could looking decade sars-cov-2, worse, permanent... 2030. LOL, got it. virus nothing China. know fact virus spreading northern Italy September 2019, we've found COVID-19 antibodies blood Milanese. two months reached Wuhan rest China. Saying Chinese Sinophobic inaccurate. needs investigating Milan, Wuhan. lead believe media afraid virtue. Post vaccination, might still use information part decision making process certain activities. love getting voted speaking truth.

The politics rule apparent people evidently can't get echo chambers believing months. aren’t new variants resistant disease, yes. 30% Israel's population children 16. current authorization impossible get even 60% extremely unlikely. I've met fair number people. usually terribly knowledgeable. generally think herd immunity, however achieved, end virus. add this, discharged covid patient 2 months now. Fucking incredible sight see. Can't wait discharge last covid patient. is? Stop ""whataboutism"".

It's quite obvious Trump administration poorly handled pandemic US, ""science skeptic"" messaging still hurts us.

However anything PRC transparent anything COVID related. critical determine origins put measures place keep happening again.  depends. private business (airline) could require passengers wear masks forever want. Walmart etc.

State Federal mask mandates probably go away late summer / fall cases drop really low point people vaccinated.  soon adults fully vaccinated airbnb short term rental, even full name QUALIFY SPACE?
We're looking least 4 5 requirements below:
1. Solid employment last 6 months
2. Monthly income least 3 times monthly rent
3. 580+ Credit Score
4. Rent paid full time last 12 months
5. evictions last 3 years

It's actually generous qualify 4 5, honest. need minimum income least 5k (60k+ per year job) hope maybe another adult that. I'm seeing places demand people qualify individually unit (in case break up, one roommate leaves, etc.) that's making infinitely harder even couples qualify, though easier time single woman. Maaaany times I've asked husband/boyfriend applying lease, presuming one. Le sigh. problem is, could reduce hospitalizations *in near term.* But, due nature virus, cause long term damage, specifically cardiovascular problems. 

I'm scientist, seems early signs people mild even asymptomatic cases develop cardiovascular problems, people vaccinated catch COVID-19, could also develop problems.

I'm suggesting case (so overzealous mods delete post think am) I'm wondering anyone thought this?

[For example, Mayo clinic "" Imaging tests taken months recovery COVID-19 shown lasting damage heart muscle, even people experienced mild COVID-19 symptoms. may increase risk heart failure heart complications future. "" entire family husband’s vaccinated shortly. allowing see us soon. aren’t vaccinated, accept tiny risk don’t sterilizing immunity seeing sons birthday party (where everyone except us vaccinated) pare days December early January there's 200,000 even 300,000 cases per day, I'm hoping thread continues vaccines still rolling out.

As someone works hospital, I've seen well. second half December first half January fucking bonkers. Compared previous years, census 20%. patients waiting hours ER room left make new beds. article, published English-language section Jerusalem old news. They’ve found evidence virus Italian patients early September. Journalists, consumers, please full research. Yep. Even CDC saying, long haulers need get ass work tad harder push body. Amazes fatties hiding behind longhaulers. Lol. stuff mentioned damn easy. Anyone could this. hardest part developing vaccine. Many actually failed. look sanofi. thread kind dying lately, guess good thing covid becoming less less hot topic every day. excited back normal! Happy Valentine’s Day everyone ❤️ Looking back things countries reacted, pretty proactive knew take serious measures get things control. worked. wear 2 order effective. Healthcare standards United States shown worst healthcare statistics first world countries. I'm envisioning likelihood yearly Covid shot go along flu one. also owed 100M J&amp;J end June. Add Pfizer &amp; Moderna supply that’s enough 400M Americans aka entire population. study shows supplements cure COVID anti vaxxers seem say.

“Just take supplements &amp; keep immune system good, you’ll fine”. Karen, supplements saving grace. They’re = supplements

To add onto life, body naturally needs it. doesn’t mean it’s going save life stop getting intubated. Username check out. Except Britain, course. Neither CDC That's point.  sure, another illness permanently floating around mutating like Flu still sucks.

Like flu, may always around, kill people every year, years worse others.

It's frustrating knowing multiple points may avoided humanity kinda blew every opportunity. Well that’s pretty clickbaity title. article says likely least 1,100 infections end 2019, isn’t surprising. virus circulating Italy NY people reacted well. Spoken like true moron Would also hurt liquor stores.

Not I'm opposed change, looking would help is, obviously, one sided. Every country's outbreaks larger initially thought. evidence vaccines provide sterilizing immunity 70-80% people either vaccinated previously COVID mostly ""go away"" Bad timing Dad. leads pneumonia. Things want get rid of:
1) COVID
2) using “jab” slang vaccines Yeah mean governors laying specific plan lifting restrictions getting back normality I’ve seen plan governor

Also 70-80% vaccination rate herd immunity probably thing, considering many people already achieved natural immunity, I’m really hoping that’s main threshold that’s looked think paid vaccine got true. infections longer time circulate, likely see vaccine ineffectiveness new strains read lot lies 48 hours post vaccine. Fully back normal. bit tender morning touch went away. Woo!! somebody tell many football fields is? almost year ago. science saying masks help everyone. italy. Also managed blame US army,India,Bangladesh Spain Interesting comment posts China virus. Get fucked. I’m sure downvoted. don’t want masks stay like right now, future think people coughing/sneezing/runny nose/any type common cold wear mask. It’s Japan cut sickness much. also keep lot young infants hospital RSV. makes sense. 

I’ve never seen non medical professional wearing mask 2020 30 years life states, it’s time start people showing symptoms illness post-pandemic. offence, vaccine developed Astra Zeneca, pharmaceuticals come India like u/Million2026 said-so, want stop taking medicine stop going hospital, go ahead :) Yes, word September appear article. nothing CDC guidance, based science current prevalence/deaths levels.

If cannot get prevalence deaths vaccination end summer we're gonna rough decade. Fortunately appears though vaccines actually work, happen. yeah online people seem think stock market province fat cat Richie riches. like, totally is, lot average people also need care mean yeah... Yeah, guess support too. Socializing meal times pretty important part life. Hi sorry, I'm Dad! :) Yeah well, ever heard international solidarity? Biontech vaccine developed EU produced Belgium US. share production Belgian factory world. Pfizer factory US isn’t allowed export it. America first. Pretty sad. Fuck CPP. Taiwan number 1. Someone posted English link sorry. Israel Hi fellow dmv person! always wondering, lack results area (vaccination effectiveness transmission) due e need data time? it’s much difficult experiment design? recommend that. knew that, go 2 months. rather convenient suspect given 1 month's permission Even use percentage people testing positive, fallen 30-32% early January 6-8% week. represents huge drop Light end tunnel. might get sooner later Perhaps, keep mind US 485k deaths compared 25 New Zealand. That's definitely worth least level inconvenience. good source, okay. mean truthfully state decide. Federal Government enforce mask mandates social distancing etc. federal property.

Some states already starting getting rid mask mandates lowering restrictions. watch Covid-19 task force briefings talked things going back ""normal"" late summer early fall 70-80% people get vaccinated reach herd immunity. dont know rely US. think get many America, would give away need much?  Upvoted Tool, new album kinda sucks tbf. rules people entering china currently.  Peter Daszak, British zoologist also tweeted: “As lead animal/environment working group found trust &amp; openness w/ China counterpart,”

This guy president [EcoHealth paid WIV perform coronavirus research, he's [personal lead scientists there. enormous conflict interest. 10 seconds find this. try sometime Scare media click bait. Honestly think wandered onto wrong thread here.

We're saying watch actual numbers coming back tune restrictions accordingly. expect happen matter we've got data work from.

Having said that, way anywhere near herd immunity previous infections. IFR around 0.5% 0.3% population *dead* gotten without vaccines. 1.15 million bodies yet. cancer have. Today year since last date.
I one march 9th planned.
Quarantaining began 8th lmao Isn’t moderna also higher dosage? Well city, teachers home full time despite huge societal cost, got prioritized vaccine still fighting go back April. 

So case, teachers treated better almost worker here. Reports like make wonder actually much farther along pandemic people think. 

A lot people likely COVID currently prove. whole thing finally coming end called d**mer saying masks visiting hospitals nursing homes continue likely continue log time.

The days outdoor mask wearing anywhere numbered. totally relate. Sometimes work took California I'd load good scotch trips. amount saved taxes covered cost gas (which paid employer time!) Yes, true. relative there. much less desperate immediate need us. believe they’re exercising caution, l respect it. also considering realise countries desperate letting 1st dibs vaccine, whilst seeing next couple months play globally. way vaccinating everyone ASAP, every method failed. Nope, perfect immunity, plenty evidence vaccines reduce spread enough worry it. good job *specifically regarding vaccine distribution* wouldnt be? mother PA strange virus back november 2019, doctors figure was, lasted like 3 months. Looking back, symptoms Covid.

Strangely, one students got back visiting relatives China week started showing symptoms. Illinois plan getting back actual normal? would give essential Liberty, purchase little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty Safety.
-	Benjamin Franklin kind argument this? can’t even hide much suck CCP. Yes article claim originated Italy. Even first paragraph saying spread past China early September. Monday Tuesday's number significantly lower compared day week, doubt itll happen. However think point we'll 1M+ day unless reach bottleneck supply. But, Twitter said bad! wonder February 2020 Los Angeles. Felt like flu x10 cough lasted month so. seems promising. vaccines, I’ve probably best feeling Pfizer one.

Australian government clearly onto solid too, recently buying 10 million - despite ample supply AstraZeneca already. Indeed is, definitely annoying part catching Software engineers aren’t medical scientists, would matter. pharmacist got caught ruining covid vaccines certainly medical scientist. Holy straw man Batman!  funny thing idiot already almost certainly taken vaccine made India.  doesn’t mean it’s irrelevant. vaccines effective, easier administer, easier store. AZ obsolete. much, much better “well one died.” given clean CCP approved data, raw data. know, could 10x. 450k+ dead global pandemic calling trillion dollar military aid response. 

Better late never. Pessimist2020, Pessimist2021 LOL article motive getting vaccine poorer countries quickly altruism: evolution punish delays.

The author writing wealthy countries sitting piles unused vaccine doses slowly figuring (or if) share wealth. reality countries even enough populations moment, much less entire world. 

Until supply greatly exceeds local demand, there's really much difference administering vaccines locally vs sending poor countries. anything, delaying likely cheaper, easier, effective nature Pfizer Moderna vaccines harder transport administer. single dose vaccine without need ultra cold cold storage much easier distribute remote village Andes. 

Also, notion poor countries extremely relevant economies rich nations seems HIGHLY debatable, best. Many US companies extremely well, stock market reached record highs, supply chains delayed still moving (the latest iPhone pushed back year) putting lot product consumers' hands. that's bunch people locally America work. I'm buying vaccine affecting poor African country going cause appreciable amount economic pain America. Yeah another snowstorm coming much US today tomorrow expect days lower numbers followed biggest numbers yet Please do. Please stay home COVID globally eradicated. beg you. it’s right thing societally, rest us much happier do. Lockdowns cause huge economic devastation risk calculus different loss income, homelessness, etc. 

Whining masks seems petty. They're effective cause long term economic distress. Although reported numbers dropping already holiday rush. Highly doubted drop numbers due vaccines. Less people getting tested places focusing vaccinating. Also add weather across much U.S. Wayyyyyyy less active weekends here. good, means people lives busy living! Can't read died 2 days taking vaccine that's enough time immunity. takes two week dose immunity boost. that's good example.  start bottling BioNTech vaccines Frankfurt. get it. Especially since ""incubators"" variants seem immune compromised/elderly end incubators weeks months. would better minimizing global vaccination effort assumed rather agonizing getting vaccine every last arm resume normalcy. Oh is. something pay attention to. I've seen many ""vaccines pointless new variants always ahead vaccines"" - like posts. frustrating. got second dose, safe workout tomorrow? toilets vaccine production? large portion worlds medicine made India yeah think industry impacted going hospitality/hotels airlines. ever see recovering anywhere near before. think airlines going see end hub model bunch point-to-point routes relatively small planes. airline industry already starting trend direction going see lot more. they're going go discount airline model including legacies. extent going whole hog. Hotels general severely damaged / impaired especially midrange portion market. missed mention Volcano's returned favour :)

Cities long history earthquake zone, try Turkey. They've cities written history. Okay man, whatever. There's point anyway. best. Phase III study showed 100% efficacy hospitalization death, one case severe disease defined subject states 93% day came evaluated never needed medical attention.

THAT SAID: total number people *any* disease small showed 100% efficacy, nobody experience vaccines actually expected would stay 100% released.

In reality, nothing ever 100%. start dealing populations millions people, see small number fully vaccinated people get COVID get hospitalized die. reduce risk outcome turned COVID-19 disease similar morbidity (risk injury/severe illness) mortality (death) seasonal influenza.  certainly fair point. couple follow questions legitimately know I'm thinking data may exist yet.

1) data surrounding prevalence long haul cases exist asymptomatic v. mild v. severe? guess low asymptomatic v. prevalent severe cases... supporting numbers me.

2) data yet lung scans / heart screenings vaccinated patients exposed virus (i.e., distinction recovered cases vs. vaccinated exposed cases)? I'm gonna guess exist yet would closely mirror asymptomatic cases arguing that. Trump years vary damaging. population knew threat trusted gov't mind anyway. Someone sure planted propaganda you. Would saying thing l 3% population vaccinated? Completely different context. 9/11 government wanted people keep constant fear concern terrorism since trying get support years military intervention. pandemic different, everyone wants move on. 
Just look past pandemics, Spanish flu everyone moved roaring 20s, point lot people forget massive pandemic think definitely could like Vietnam, probably good Island nation. Cheers. friend Taxes? Say multimillionaire billionaires

Plus there's species jellyfish that's immortal Maybe likelihood contagion high them, important vaccinated? matter strategy, want curb contagion fast possible vaccinating likely get want reduce deaths vaccinating vulnerable? government close school, vaccinating teachers seems like minimum Corporate retreats minuscule portion business travel year. drop bucket.

Make mistake, things already trending way, Coronavirus pressed fast forward big way. shit sherlock say til midnight Wed chances it'll longer. Meanwhile friend ER doctor Swiss hospital can't even get vaccine. taking consideration enormour amount asymptomatic carriers times testing available? 

I agree first paragraph though I'm arguing rush going ""back normal"". dont even know takes achieve herd immunity point time. There's estimates guesses different mathematical models. say 70% immunity, say 40-50%. regional too. Hard tell. flexed Canada's mighty muscles strong armed india instead It’s basically additional contract Canada signed limited amount AstraZeneca come earlier expecting main order AstraZeneca start arriving. 

Canada set start receiving it’s order 20 million doses AstraZeneca April USA plants. Hope so. best both. can’t refute claim call name. That’s fine me. Reported. safety director building expects everyone brought back open floorplan office September. seemed insanely pessimistic me, remembered **liability.** Many non-customer-facing companies like mine incentivized err side caution. Look locus control vs locus interest.

I talk therapist every month.

You cannot control behavior others. Period. It’s probably gonna 4-8 months it’s available general public reach herd immunity, wouldn’t still ton time delayed decision till April, it’ll reportedly available average joe according Fauci Vietnam ranks first tests per confirmed case. Even cases would spread pretty easily since bars clubs open since last summer without mask restrictions.

But one differentiators 'severe' covid19 disease autoimmune response, antibodies start attacking normal cells.

I know whether pieces spike protein floating around, well full virus, would sufficient trigger response. saw estimate CDC couple weeks ago 90 million people US contracted COVID. Natural immunity, vaccine rolling out, holiday season done likely cause drop I'm necessarily masks, saying *if* produce significant positive effect ditching considered. example surgeons commonly used, really can't compare risk infection someone's saliva/breath particles making way someone's opened-up body close proximity surgery getting someone sick grocery store. Further, masks used redirect germs rather catch them. essence I'm wearing mask public shit's still getting out, right front me. Someone walking behind still exposed.

If masks work cases high long? Someone obviously say ""oh that's people wearing them"" come now... I'm proposing masks become suggestion mandate, people understand someone may choose wear one telling truth tho Shock horror, government signs contract company expects deliver quantities said contract. end! No, first study show still valuable. 

Keep mind much science affected publication bias - pay attention sensational outcomes we're missing lot good science. haven’t already started it, would logistical nightmare would set people already shots variety different places Man don’t think problem vaccine, racist ties place home ownership? job, family, anything else. Yeah nah bro second group broken would better. huge difference 18 year old basically kid 59 year old People blaming messenger instead actually wanting face problems. lot social issues seen pandemic really problems ""normal"" society society good sweeping things rug something really disruptive like happens. problems exposed anyone cares get rid thing exposing them, rather trying solve them. want 12 Monkeys? that's get 12 Monkeys! Sadly, that's good description state party atm.

Perhaps leadership wake absolute sweep occurred last fall. Otherwise, yeah, R generation. Lack empathy fellow countrymen?? care Americans died covid 3 million Americans die every year?? life ended covid valued life ended due obesity??

We simply different mindset live different cultures. highly value freedom many Americans. likely don’t value freedom autonomy much do. criticize caring freedom, says lot values. **Since sin care life?**. 

Why want government imprison people home slight chance might get ill?? selfish!!!

You likely haven’t stopped thinking COVID wouldn’t website posting covid. 

It’s really ignorant concerned young people given across world elderly, including country. can’t imagine able empathize young people dealt virus.  

Despite you’ve read media, US pretty good shape. approaching herd immunity rapidly vaccinating population. top that, didn’t government imprison people homes. You’re experience draconian laws lockdowns winter begins rest world moves past COVID. 

Fwiw, freedom travel. fact, went period time couldn’t venture far house. current travel restriction government implemented: say - freedom isn’t free. likely don’t understand people, especially Americans, sacrificed remain free. way said right comment day wearing masks ""several months."" also said could wearing 2022, he's always erred side caution.

What boils vaccines. long get enough people vaccinated, wear masks longer months. Got satire. *good* satire, satire nonetheless. think totally page then. think okay people vent annoying without anti-mask. People thread generally understand value masks also need get miss seeing people's faces.

That's hardest part me. Masks reminder whole shit show. miss seeing strangers smile sooo much. literally 69 years. What's wrong you? recommendations happen, schools open up. Except, new ventilation system become thing? seems expensive time consuming implement. America actually good job compared countries world probably best large country. Look Canada right America get vaccines India Dontcha think? Sarcasm? I’m talking elementary school. Younger kids mostly. School kids almost exclusively socialization. Reading writing math...sure. developing social skills. Anyone feels scared sending kid school without vaccine free pursue options - don’t make choice child. adult staff vaccinated adult get vaccine, schools normal. Glad specified England. three nations seem high uptake care staff quite well (though i’ve checked Wales percentage while)

Overall seems lot petty politics whenever nation particular singled out, decide group UK together. domestic production anymore everyone (understandably) prioritizing people. whatever get shipped internationally, we’re influential wait. like new variant hits harder second time. There’s low risk strategy here. virus sucks, way spreads completely unfair. seems mutate faster Coronaviruses.

We commit good strategy- striving absolute perfection time consuming &amp; could cause virus gain lots ground us. Millions vulnerable need shots, true, hitting 10M per week. 20M people age 70 entire country, comparison. less 3M teachers. on. We’re vaccinating rates completely swamp numbers. Think bit math It’s far likely came pneumonia. Coronavirus may well around then, widespread thousands bacterial viral infections...? simple all. harms lot. causes distinct divide people. pro-mask friend anti-mask could cause tension example. masks whole lot positive sense certainly need relax narrative since causing massive divide population people wear masks people don't. is, course, bad. fellow Canadian I'm glad hear this. watching sidelines worried, great news. Keep up! related earlier article India ""approved"" exporting vaccines Canada already purchased? care elaborate nonsense? understand AOS? Holy shit, really 5% obesity? There's nowhere US rate low. source Scotland. I’m obsessed checking daily. Yeah, depends widely circulating. people early chain transmission lockdown last long. spreading weeks likely lockdown month. live SI though, effect much. excellent contract tracer's know lockdown longer necessary. ""long flu"" commonly known thing.

that's lot people ignorant uneducated recently discovered post viral syndrome exists. many times encountered people saying still feel alright couple weeks cold flu? least quite often including agree. mandates already losing steam places people compliant. summer, completely toothless. Especially we're 50% population first shot 25% shots. People going follow mask rules. 

I suspect, could actually good thing. messaging could be, ""the vaccine deployed, masks required, get vaccinated return old normal"" see continued demand vaccine. 

Or could pipe dream. Yes. Tested positive, negative return work. Said like bad cold first time, second time ‘feels like I’ve s__t kicked me’. Let's Fucking GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO perhaps Thor revealed antivaxxer. think draconian part clear end goal metric lifting mask mandates. Nothing. “til say so” messaging I’m vaccinated literally dgaf. I’ve followed every rule year want go friends houses again. Well, trust conclusions interpretation study motivations. 4000 strains relevant. impact spike, ones mutations inconsequential. know this. Also, I'm saying they're right, evidence doubt claims. would love provide sort study contradicts this. one. Youre talking evidence. cringe. two mutually exclusive, CCP deeply corrupt make saying wrong, US's Response Trump massive fucking joke. Comments like drive wall. 

Covidshield brand name supplier using AstraZeneca vaccine. gets import approval Health Canada safe, manufacturer (the Indian Serum Institute) working closely AstraZeneca. There’s reason trust it’s safety. 

Your comment step anti-vaxxers. Eww! want mine back seems like Western rich countries worst hit this. poor countries badly hit Europe/US aren’t getting vaccine doses now? really seam like *new* normal. Rather change normal.

What change public’s *perception* masks don’t anything. 

The truth is, Fauci admitted such, lied efficacy masks order preserve supplies. argue day whether right call not, regardless, eroded public’s confidence public health messaging. Yeah, 65 corridor absolutely PACKED manufacturing everyone know struggling keep workers. everyone charging premium labor. constantly people job hop factory next door give couple bucks. starting pay $18 unskilled labor get people door. cling single study done prior kids school completely ignore studies done kids school?

Point two. Kids still seeing faces. see faces family, see faces tv (which already kids learned know people, that's entirely different issue), they're remote learning, one wear mask.

Given effective vaccines preventing severe illness, would seem negate ethical issues associated challenge trial determine effectiveness stopping transmission. expose intentionally try spread unvaccinated people, could expose test see significant level virus respiratory droplets. weird reply say someone despises CCP. sure you’re snarky. 


New strains virus going become majority infecting people, new variants continue emerge even spread slows, there’s still questions efficacy vaccines new variants. don’t want get situation we’ve vaccinated large amounts people new strain covered.

15 days ago 1000 people hospital now.

Hospitalizations lower 11/14/2020 

And past 5 days, hospitalization decreases averaging per day. disgusting troll. Ban. Yeah fuck especially don’t define actually means think like polio flu. 99% polio cases mild symptoms, 1% could horrific symptoms including paralysis death. 

Mass vaccination campaigns effectively controlled polio. young children everywhere given polio vaccinations suspect case Covid. 

Within couple years, we'll safe well-tested pediatric Covid shots join pediatric vaccination schedule along DTAP, MMR, IPV, HiB, PCV etc. shots parents familiar with. Count that. Come J&amp;J! That’s flu mild cold, though usually it’s modestly severe. healthy adult hospitalized also uncommonly severe.  Also, there's perception vaccines rushed/politicized, makes people skeptical usual them.

I think fair concern abstract, though obviously there's enough results safety/effectiveness we're fine.   Well, that’s odd. 

There 92 suspected cases November December 2019; tested 67 antibodies found none any. 

I’m surprised none vaccinated yet, also curious seems believe never Covid, antibodies may remain full year. didn’t say whether tested first identified Covid case (or early cases) whether antibodies nine eleven months later . You’d think would give valuable clues. virus, that. idea you’re going about. People can’t construct thought process properly, shouldn’t go around calling folks ‘dumb.’ Oh yeah, December.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Eh? kids mostly normal school year.  case managed isolation, UK variant via airport workplace. respect growing sentiment lockdowns, we're rapidly reaching point need move on.

I can't respect anti-mask sentiments. Get wear mask months. literally harms nothing, minor temporary inconvenience inside public building. Nobody making wear one park, car, home. Nobody oppressing you.

Get first vaccine available you, wear mask public spaces, hard. Lol alright 🤷🏼‍♀️ nice Sunday 👍🏻 India (with population 1.2 bn using Oxford vaccine). they've already supplied dozens countries Morrocco carribean.

Because Oxford vaccine sold cost, retails $3 dose. Pfizer one retails $20 dose (so $40 fully vaccinated). think globally demand pay $40 per vaccination $6, rocks head. bunch studies show somewhere 3-5x many people infected cases, i.e. people get get sick get mildly sick never get tested go doctor.

If true somewhere around 100-125 million people already exposed, likely immune. 30-38% population. Add 15% vaccinated we're close half country immune... cut spread substantially.

Just like chain letters Ponzi schemes, uncontrolled exponential spread long enough run people.

Yes, they're little uncomfortable wear leave deep lines face...but that's know they've got good seal. you’re right, let’s never correct bad messaging - stick whatever said first confuse anybody; new data damned, especially it’s inconvenient!

yikes. clearly disturbed, violent individual. would love point facts wildly base covid killed far people flu, personal safety think I'm gonna block you. 2nd clinic sounded like throwing party 15 minute waiting area. 
I realized long since I'd heard group people laughing. wonderful glimpse normalcy. Every time see good headline Reddit, everyone replies still finds way turn negative. know 100k still lot would horrified heard last year, still improvement. BioNtech developed vaccine money German government. factory bought converted 375 million euros German government. BioNtech vaccine funded US government. party operation warp drive.

Yes expect vaccines manufactured EU given vulnerable population first.

The EU commission screwed passing laws good time.

It would hurt USA vaccinate vulnerable population slow after. it’s America First. always. must same. friends South Africa reporting reinfections. sequencing much due lack resources. I'm keeping close eye doing. Things seem good last time heard though. seems like 2nd bout reason hits harder. again, vaccinations come halt. tradeoff might result wash. tried storming Capitol? Canada slow compared first world countries? someone says “western media” know they’re CCP troll. Dead giveaway much walking ourselves. hour neighbors walk around neighborhood. one minute they're themselves, next they're passing one another, zero social distancing. mistreatment. solution. Getting keeping society crumbling mistreatment. It’s working maintain life face adversity. 

Can ask honest question? Would accept deal could stay home pandemic ends means must forego everything requires another person maintain? short-term tick births isn’t really problematic though. wouldn’t call negative effect—just effect. believe Canada start getting substantial amounts novavax 100m doses u.s
 need likely send Canada possibly Mexico. think best vaccine named Pfizer competitive moderna imo smaller incidense side effects.

in short, US UK good job vaccinating, countries benefit including Canada get extra doses coming quickly early. Rare irrelevant. fucking gun roughly 2 6 chance blowing brains, 1 10 chance living never put temple fun. COVID G7 countries substantial portion youth 1+ preexisting condition even nearly active could be. 

With **STAR ATHLETES** talking ""Will never play pro again"" levels bad death, fit young people find, general populace far likely overweight obese, asthma etc make COVID far worse. talking likely chances took flat *no precautions* got COVID 20 something 1 4 chance death intense hospitalization 2 4 hospitalization. talking mostly bullshit talking point based *already knew* generally true squint stop thinking immediately words exit body. 

We deaths young 16 state 30 year olds dropping like flies. another comment someone already pointed half hospitalized elderly half split younger people, 50 20 crowd. high chance hospitalized killed flu likely taking precautions year round simple fact chances getting seriously fucked one disease could put poverty. 

The idea COVID mild irritance youth misinformation, damn close bold faced lie benefits people exploit working class. Even part 30 crowd gets mild COVID symptoms already reaching prior 2 6 bullets analogy, lung scarring heal ontop still spreading virus infect far vulnerable members society. likely chance long, outstanding damage ruin weeks months life.

Thank god someone speaking changing definition victory! educational background contradict experts?

Like Alaska's population 12% age 65+ rest country closer 15%. lot less 100% population take vaccine, much exactly remains seen lot polls show like 40-50%.

I curious see happens. states try ""stimulate demand"" either opening people running campaigns.

You use “we don’t know vaccinated” even 80 90% vaccinated surprised anyone surprised.

Of course couples want children think corona danger, uncertainty fear there. mentions: like war.

In 2019, 753 000 children born France.

Now 20% 150 000, born babies.

We could almost add 81 000 deaths coronavirus France, making casualties 231 000. Nah, s/he loves smell moldy basement Solidarity Allies? Compassion?

India Russia supply world vaccines remember. Wearing mask hurts me, hurts lots people. uncomfortable physically mentally. go concerts, nightclubs masks? wear mask several years, won’t. strongly disagree one shot strategy. AZ vaccine barely effective UK variant useless SA variant. increase SA variants new mutations. always Europe (and rest wold) pay price risky strategy. Shhhhh. 

Please dont ruin good secrets midwest. believe main reason cases dropped, wasnt US anything, cases jumped holidays started dropping reason family gatherings. UK banned exports vaccine. AZ contract supply UK 100 million doses. 
AZ manufactures 2 million doses week based information publicly available. would take 50wks supply 100m assuming yield remains constant. suspect Canada done fall 2021. probably true Australia well guess. Things going ramp pretty quickly US UK mostly done vaccination going probably June. Yeah think also understating far phases are. Friend mine young diabetes. definitely group 5. got first jab weeks ago. Oxford vaccine probably one least used vaccines.

Pfizer J&amp;J probably dominant global vaccines. Great... Newfoundland outbreak UK variant us total lockdown. Including gain function research virology labs... Protections vaccines allow pharma make sell vaccines all;

Gee, wonder businesses would need shielded liability reasonable policy. agree you. right thing right thing, easy external rewards. called integrity. Check latest case/death charts curve orbital SpaceX launch, Ohio trying catch accurate reporting.

Ohio currently 129.49 deaths per 100k, still US national average 144.41. They're ranked 27th overall per capita I’m legit sad see countries cooperate comes vaccine equity. Canada always solid partner US absolutely hate see aren’t offering supply least get vulnerable people covered. wouldn’t even many people end day.

Maybe. Yeah, there's assumption UK AZ. half doses far Pfizer. spent whole summer holidays whatever fuck wanted. Packed nightclubs every weekend, concerts back, could see family friends whenever wherever wanted without fear. 5 day Lockdown piss easy trade that.

Only first wave back March, Melbourne’s second wave caused serious lockdowns. Speaking behalf telling us we’re living fear pretty bold considering 99% us don’t agree And? hope always vaccinations.

I don’t know it’s coincidence there’s scientific explanation this.

Until week ago, palms feet would sweat gallons whenever I’m stressed hot, it’s like whole life, even sweat forehead armpits single drop come hands feet.
 
I looked everywhere doesn’t seem articles specific matter. correct misunderstood aren’t vaccines supposed prevent death severe illness 100%? say: someone first date might wanna fuck ya Vikings always fuck ya

My first NFL game actually ""miracle"" playoff Saints. intense. today felt guilt hating weird New Orleans fans mood NYT. every major media outlet.

Trump pandemic way absolute worst nightmare. squeeze every last drop possibly topics fade background people's lives again. mean, summer vacation numbers impacted vaccine well. people vaccinated means either less spread least less people symptomatic. said case, outbreak. mild annoyance ICU nurses experience can't postulate side effects vaccines almost always manifested first 24 hours? Y’all said UK variant agree, like last 4 comments I've made sub autoremoved says political. Even I'm saying anything political. We'll see one stays guess lol. thread day article take hss extremely high far like 90%. drop severe cases good hear. lockdown thought business done better job. 

Most spread time workplace like food processing plants. 

Imagine next pandemic deadlier. 

I’m pro business next time government needs hold accountable. 

But first government needs plan business prepare case happens again. dont care level precautions people take. quick judge others. ""Oh dare go gym, work outside"" ""Its irresponsible go bars"" etc. South African strain would like word you. using Northern Hemisphere Guinea Pigs Well right aim reduce hospitlisations deaths. teacher high risk group that's likely end hospital whilst high risk catching covid it'll probably mild them. whole reason countries restrictions place prevent hospitals becoming overwhelmed. we've finally got risk groups protected move onto eliminating spread covid like vaccinating likely catch etc Go see them. They're vaccinated Ok... Quovid Nantien Cousteau? quite horrifying? virus undergo drastic gain contagiousness infecting cities?

If true (and I'm suspicious is) matter time jumps something R0 10. genuinely sucks they're opening school given vaccine priority.

It entirely students/ families choice go online here, think teachers conditions put high risk able stay home teach kids chose online anyway, rather every teacher mix need person. Online less effective going least need option long many families want be. let teachers high risk it. Paycheck protection program, part Covid relief packages basically gives money small businesses don’t fire employees allowed forgive loans 70% loan goes pay labor. Well, building houses, 50% cost labor, pretty much there’s house bloom right now

As second comment, would rent apartment banks put mammal day job house right now? literally giving mortgages 2.7% anyone walks door poster replied called troll. called troll back told “go away”. f bombs anything.

Mod removed post, ask used f bomb going call FBI something? mod removed post too.

I haven’t seen sensitive moderator this. New Jersey allows smokers get vaccine. would advise family take smoking(or fill vaccine form tell smokers. going check?) Well worries too. least three variants running around worse original one. course can. US larger country means resources terms people, money, infrastructure. fact could argued outperform smaller nations even per capita collective bargaining power able get access limited resources like phone calls pharma reps. Pfizer rep time six phone calls, think they're going spend time calling smallest countries first, would call ones offering largest offer get process moving quickly possible people? waiting 2 weeks 2nd shot, mean? believe even exist really say theres much truth think tons good news virus... scares narrative surrounding restrictions. Especially given rhetoric sub I'm worried government pushing masks 2022 ""it's piece cloth"" ""it can't hurt"" even hospitalizations collapse. understand need masks hospitalizations go want spend another year masked, sterile dystopia ""it's piece cloth"" ""it's really bad."" though happening makes depressed. Removing restrictions overly intervening people's lives thinking they're stupid think critically themselves.

You're lost think strains showed now. There's reason national average infections deaths decreasing peak highs hearing infectious strains. Stop kidding yourself. First all, one ever said anything semiannual vaccinations. That's crazy talk. Second all, vaccinate world time. 150 million Americans got flu shot last year, sure similar least developed world. able meet demand going trivial within reasonable time vaccines developed approved. well manufacturing efficiencies realized.

But really besides point. nothing scary COVID becoming endemic. lose collective poop common cold we? COVID19 novel. immune systems become familiar it, going lose potency. quite possible we'll getting boosters interval. Whether fortify time diminishing immune response, combat problematic strains. different flu. importantly jumping gun talk way way early data simply yet. feel  i'm historical reenactor events cancelled mid-2022 really angering vaccines *likely* widely available months. wish people would try sensible patient  cure third arms prevent getting COVID. Yea sound alarms every time new variant even vaccine effective can’t good news. get next group vaccinated that's pretty much end hospital protected. pretty much eliminate hospitlisations. Though even 70s vaccinated still reduce hospitlisations substantial amount. TBH I've mostly seen people running opposite direction saying vaccines 100% prevent spread despite limited evidence.

The truth quite sure yet. Poland next. Feeling hopeful. I'm fully vaccinated today first time girlfriend mom able get appointments involve waiting 2+ months driving 3 hours way. Outsider feel get it’s fun shit US we’re actually great vaccine front. issues, vaccination really isn’t one them. Cool, sounds like half us need vaccine then. Probably shouldnt forcing anyone it’ll work either way pretty good peer reviewed study 2012 2013 masks airborne viruses. consolidation studies drawing data far back 1907. particulars effect virus much still learned, transmission via droplets aerosol common century good data on. choose ignore established science. SARS-covid-2 new might say novel transmission mechanisms well understood outbreak - takes lot less year link previous data. always physics engineering make re-useable rockets, didn’t naive think China propaganda. Ever thought western media chose title investigators obviously disagree angle? truth is, although seems western media diverse, processors reports reuters/BBC/NYT, basically propaganda arms UK/Democratic governments. know reason is? Israel done well compared rest us? dude made money 90’s dot com bubble everyone grandma could get software make millions producing nothing value.

It lot wilder today’s tech boom (sorta) rooted fundamentals. beginning suspect weird karma bot. biggest misanthrope ever Lol happened Diploma mill doctors. Started hit herd immunity amongst likely get it. shit ND/SD let run wild summer, reason respiked Jewish neighborhoods NYC. rocket science. It’s made AstraZeneca plants.  USA doesn’t approve it, supply get released rest world Every bit helps. faster vulnerable vaccinated faster death rates hospital visits decline finally able see sort sense normal again. Probably human mind like quite understandable somewhat less intellectual person topic like anti Semite fuckward, get life stop fool. Oh convenient discredit people shown ignorant. would refer back holiday super spreader events. Otherwise aren’t much differently. anything, fewer people masking 3 months ago. would assume immunity, offering temporary protection peak. us approve us? guess question Lol, going Top posts time, found gem:

""Governor Cuomo: “My mother expendable. mother expendable. put dollar figure human life. public health strategy consistent economic one. one talking social darwinism sake stock market.”""


And turns Cuomo undercounted nursing homes deaths, large amount deaths came policies nursing homes. race time trying vaccinate people easily transmissible variants spread like wildfire since obviously that’s bad yet-to-be vaccinated group, drop efficacy new variants obviously also bad already vaccinated group.

Removing restrictions precautions early allowing virus variants spread freely would cause unnecessary deaths severe illness.  *Death cults vogue!* point... Yes. afford Karma. I’ve got karma days. know downvoted even measly points, won’t adding conversation.  I’m basically muted thread disheartening people need hear possible truth good other. 

This bigger people willing capable visualizing. mutated, vaccine help that.

Pretty well second shot. Still studies. lot people get angry idea restrictions won’t go away reddit randos decide they’re needed anymore.

I mean people look numbers, yeah, areas maybe needed. are. Texas face face entire time even going see vaccine general population does, despite fact Texas seen several educator covid related deaths.

No one asking free job, saying bullshit certain states asking us go back ""with"" precautions, us already back already know truth. rolling dice praying there's outbreak. Around 30 million first vaccine, around 10 million vaccines. 

On plus side US they're prioritizing highest risk patients like elderly, well health care workers. rate hospitalization death drop dramatically soon. 

I think heard 2 weeks infection symptoms. Another ~2 weeks symptoms hospitalization, another ~1-2 weeks hospitalization death. people get hospitalized die, takes 4-6 weeks infection point. 

So starting around March hope see death hospitalization rate drop dramatically. Western ones? read SCMP's article?  agree, sandwiches. correct - can't get damn house test know positive not. know people right positive quick tests turned state numbers get full test. care link says says nothing weather delayed issues- look around. Texas getting ready battle worst winter storm they've seen years bet nobody going go driving ice covid test. Numbers people able get test clearly fact even one person effected like this. Masks minor inconvenience. can't wear well fitted cloth surgical mask vaccinations months I'm really sure problem is. happen longer necessary? Thats lovely vaccine Mrs. Cleaver. 

Thank Eddie don’t think US vaccine issues I'll DM you. saying Fauci, Birx, Redfield, scientists get sidelined? well documented. defend Trump matter day?

I'm even going bother rest since N95 mask shortage well documented. clearly enough; contracting mask makers nothing actually contract material makers also (meltblown fabric). production good supply chain.

It's obvious trying defend U.S. response strange partisan loyalty previous administration. medical supply shortage well documented across entire United States. Trying play blind party loyalty, based post history probably true. Welp breakdown today, miss big social interactions irl friend group fallen apart pandemic. seeing old pics conventions new people really set off. pandemic absolutely destroyed mental state.  Accurate going thanksgiving, Christmas New Year’s Eve parties? Okay. You’re free think that. prepare disappointed.

My argument never happen, it’s likely happen. looks like masking around several months. far topic seems sort quarantine-breaking human error inevitable.

""error""?

Also believe count anyone died infected covid covid death regardless likelihood would died anyway someone extremely mild symptoms covid-19 advanced stage cancer gets counted covid death (or heart condition covid heart attack) almost guaranteed some.

I saw study stating statistically died covid died 10 years expected adjusting quality life lost 5 years reasonable quality life. wonder number looks like vaccinated individuals. need mandate masks 2022. vulnerable vaccinated hospitalizations deaths go down. no, need live sterile world masks 2022 threat longer there. 
After post holiday peak cases, numbers dropped. Half us masking socially distancing China welding people inside buildings. Yes it’s effective also barbaric. Even states gyms open, showers closed I’d take it, doesn’t necessarily make ineligible better vaccine there’s surplus hope read vaccines work spike protein mutations really major concern, yes vaccines great let's approach cautious optimism science. know. world needs 8-16 billion vaccine doses depending whether people get 1 shot 2 shot vaccine variety. could take years get point. saw claims it'll 2024 entire world vaccinated. hope long, thats lot time new variants evolve. 

Also deadly variants variants avoid immune system evolve mammals like pigs, bats, etc transmitted humans whole thing starts again. still find circumspect positive news vaccination efforts caseload negative media variants future. Maybe it’s wishful thinking it’s hard dismiss fear mongering. Huh so? dumbest article ever. people getting vaccinated already, nationally cases going down, vaccines used showing promising effective results variants, hell would critical restrictions removed?

If wondering ""What matter reduces viral load not?"" consider found didn't. means we've missed something... something fundamentally wrong thought mRNA vaccines operate. Gaps understanding dangerous b/c means we've left open chance huge surprise later. Especially we're talking public health crisis. study on-going, released preliminary data mainly convince remaining unvaccinated people asap.

At point supply greater demand Israel. think $10,000,000 donation senator get vaccine tomorrow? boss happy said couple people asked *What's weekend* said heading FL Christmas spend best friend, people know shut go.

I ended canceling huge gucjibg mistake.

I'm sick it. Life alone, worth living. Us making vaccine approved? Everyone receive vaccine perfectly fine society provide First. Especially.when partners unwillig cooperate productively, looking eu. would even work? pay taxes directly Israeli soldiers get healthcare civilian Israeli HMOs can't even enter area? know anything Israeli healthcare system? Yeah really isn’t easily available information scenario. I’m sure it’s rare considering numbers vaccinated prevalence virus. Umm many, many people jobs families still homeless. bubble live in? say did?

Israel purchased vaccines U.S. money using U.S. money distribute people. Nah, businesses won’t purposefully turn away customers willing spend money. least assuming Moderna vaccine effective company claimed this. one making assumptions speculating. round one caught flat footed. 

For new variant probably well America ever society preventing spread, yet almost everywhere.

Any take-aways?  get *if people actively coughing* *go outside mingle people*.

I can't tell many times I've grocery doctor's office past year, someone cough thought ""well, that's COVID me!"" I’ll focus *probably* hope best. Thanks. mean retrospect kinda did

The non American shot that’s worth anything one you’re talking about, even seems skeptical american. China Russia’s vaccines people grow third leg shit. Moderna one goes saving world. Think game cat &amp; mouse...similar radar detectors invented allow speeders evade law enforcement. 

There 20 year back &amp; forth technology maturation sometimes law enforcement upper hand, times speeder.

Eventually came equality sorts radar detectors &amp; law enforcement.

With enough time &amp; study reach similar equilibrium instance well...and measured months adjust new variants mRNA boosters....not years. snap lockdowns New Zealand Australia past months, none lasted 5 days. One scheduled last 6 days cutdown 3 realised much control thought. me... parents. Developed symptoms time. explanation picked virus vaccination centre :(

Was first dose. Pfizer purposefully take US money development vaccine avoid politicizing it. financed Germany. already-postponed-for-a-year June wedding plans hope right. 

Not even sure vendors let us postpone second time, fight first time. We'd much time money :( know reddit fond weddings - yes already got married parents backyard parents - want celebrate friends. I'm curious say? :) Redditors heads explode fact. Sure sure, that's autistic person would say. point Americans didn’t everything. anyone find actual study ?   say universal mean known variants, possible variants. They're clearly same, link posted proves... Yay! Go it! long recovering covid get vaccine? Rules state state basis, humane governor may better one score political points That’s inverse about. It’s vaccinated people infecting others, vaccinated people getting infected. 

I agree, people seem think vaccine open season whatever, don’t think there’s enough said fact still transmit disease. grateful unlike you, grandparents possess common sense? Wear mask get vaccinated. get vaccinated, well vaccinated. one constant pandemic reproductive rate never stays same. did, yes that's exactly would happen. Whether situation better - still unmitigated disaster every level. good news ""its flu"" aquaintences it. Maybe change minds. Maybe not. No.

The US government spend 2.5 billion moderna vaccine. spend anything BioNtech/Pfizer vaccine. majority government funding one.

There 175 vaccines development.

The biggest producers China, India Russia. world remember helped them.

China exporting majority vaccines. freaking hate CCP glad prioritising.

Russia also exporting even though struggling reach everyone due size country. they’re 65 wouldn’t suddenly *ineligible* they’re teachers. So... anyone taken vaccine covid? reactions especially took Moderna. :) I’m young I’m fully willing take risk infection. others might infect, you’re vaccinated assume also accepted risks. county (part Austin) 1/3rd 65s received one dose. Mainly health workers younger Texas allows people wide range medical conditions vaccinated equally 65s. fact 1B population 50% adults.

Even 1/3rd seniors great start unfortunately current rate need 6 weeks get 2/3rds one dose. Although increased supply ought help significantly. 

But big drop deaths way due 4ish week lag behind dropping case counts. It’s gonna happen continue accelerate vaccination takes hold.  Ya living van, counting lucky. way people outside winter I’ve ever seen Lol Hospital workers understand still find number people 20’s reason another got vaccine know personally mind boggling 65+ aren’t complete. 

Like social media feed full people I’m like “how F qualify”? Yes, governor. basically got rid Covid restrictions ""Iowans right thing."" Meanwhile, many people know excited maybe required wear masks work anymore really like them. mandate gone, must need them! lot sounds like long-term patients fibromyalgia experience. long time, docs take us seriously; clinical trial early 00's established pathology set place treatment options...unfortunately, there's enough patients money maker drug companies, research funding fallen away. left on-going reliance Zolpidem (Ambien) Duloxetine (Cymbalta), cause pretty miserable side-effects.

My heart goes victims pernicious, long-lasting infectious process...my hope that, current attention funding, remedy might yet appear! saw grandma without vaccinated. wore mask whole time distanced. vaccines extremely likely stop spread, need wait little longer data make official. exchange air? Sure, days wind, that's fans invented for. simple fan vent hard put in, even put one HEPA filter pull outside air filter smoke pollen comes in........ 


As HVAC systems, sure, harder retrofit existing structures, COVID, schools closed anyways, there's plenty time retrofit work...... Making sure know many category. Serious answer real cultural belief, small powerful, rural Montana government truly can’t tell anything. open store, get vaccine, definitely wear mask. It’s tied anti government philosophies Ammon Cliven Bundy people actually spread Montana pushed local state leaders hard issue. Bundys took wildlife refuge Oregon used public land excuse enact radical anti-government ideology. it’s masks. I’m saying everyone won’t wear mask Bundy follower, messaging powerful preached local leaders. state politicians capitalize opinion score points, seeing ol Greg. put quotes around body slammed? appears like saying never happened. People downvoting wanting see video. comment appears claim governor's assault bs. connections Chinese? independent researcher?  make sense vaccines stop spreading though? Lockdowns stop overwhelming hospitals. Masks inconvenience worst. barely restriction. conflating extreme social distancing measures like lockdown, large gatherings, etc. masks. everyone get vaccine though immune issues, stay lockdown people don’t risk health next 40 years? non zero number, tell that. Ohio made permanent. mid summer peak matched nationwide rural peak, no? Sorry, understand trying suggest. trying say lives older people valuable? Never said that. love going socializing, drinking partying friends. Suggesting Ppl cover face Ill eat outdoors flew season reduce disease seems fine me.  Congrats! Though full effectiveness kicks two weeks second dose, heads up, I'd wait couple weeks. 

SOON :D Sounds like time fabricate/simulate threat make everyone think real. goalpost always people vaccinated. Simply identifying vaccine prevent people dying. I’m vaccinated. I’d rather test everyone. 0/100 need hospitalization die. 

That's important part thing matters. correct. Otherwise need placebo group calculate vaccine efficacy. comment reads like it’s June,2020.

In case forgot short term lockdowns back April/may. 

Then goalpost got moved “find vaccine” arbitrary restrictions

Then found vaccine, goal post moved what?? one America dies ever covid year 2025? CDC dashboard VAMS health departments using certificate. getting check texts? so, card you. think missed point. Many people act like big decline stratospheric high month ago means prevalence COVID pretty low...it’s not. It’s actually still high needs time really get brought heel. Even current R value would months. 

But what’s likely happen people become careless risks increased spread. Seasonal variations vaccination hopefully weigh people careless, it’s quite time careless we’re 95k cases per day. That’s still lot cases. Right you. love state much everything provides immense beauty. generally people really kind suck here, feels like look hard find good people racist estimates \~15% COVID-19 infections severe. quoted Israel data 4 544 infections vaccinated cohort severe. dramatic reduction severe infection risk even vaccine efficacy symptomatic infection zero. 🙄 go read Age Surveillance Capitalism Shoshanna Zuboff. decrying tech, worshipping good either Jesus Christ conservatives seem understand economy going hurt whether we're lockdown not.

What understand 80% economy generated progressive cities going go back normal corrupt jerk one state says podunk flyover town need wear fucking mask. isn’t tagged good news assign blame. know place loved used be. time - ""outsiders"". Yes, them? vaccines still work them. Cases still decreasing. variants mostly non-issue find people believe otherwise fallen misinformation/fearmongering. go it? bet one get closer 6 feet? Depressing, huh? went nicely balanced, purple type state this. Kinda skews numbers state many average age death covid 1 year older average age death males US... don’t think so? think Florida California otherwise probably much saw Idiocracy..... Camecho.... that's guy! know. appreciate you. It’s really dumb say it’s worth comparing. Comparing important see nations better learn next pandemic n  know feeling. company working home since late feb precaution constantly traveling pre covid. Vancouver originally living Toronto close friends family back home. 

The winter helping isolation feeling found projects keep busy mind current situation. 

Also going air best thing. Yeah consistent, zoos closed churches fully open. Cases Montana 26% last 2 weeks &amp; deaths 89%. Straight NYT, look up. Might well wear double masks forever, right? point acceptable end mask mandates? You’re roommate wrong deadly.  NewYork lived RV last 3-ish years. cost space, rv payments, insurance costs us $1200 less apartment (we don’t qualify low income housing). Yea now, double dose.

With J&amp;J it'll reduce 1 numbers better. attributing holiday travel waning down, plus vaccination high transmission areas. Seeing vaccines rolled out, long, approximately, recreational International travel more... *relaxed*? early say?

I'm unclear what's going right now, looking travel UK Europe acceptable so. I've also booked vaccine appointment that's making even curious. (Don't worry, I've locked house stupid little job playing video games past year lmao) ‘Millions’ Biden administration also committing giving states estimates much vaccine receive least three weeks advance. move comes states complained need advance notice plan everything mass vaccination sites smaller clinics."" short, trying find diplomatic way saying, ""things pretty much fucked there.""  Jfc people still gonna saying indoor dining death us first climate change famines come. wishful thinking based fact. Serological studies don’t show even remotely high. guys getting numbers? 5/100 get 95% efficacy rate

No, that's right. logic, without vaccine, 100 100 people would get it. flu vaccine 50% effective (it varies year year). mean 50% people get flu vaccine end getting flu? 100% get vaccine get flu?

No, way works is, given group people, would expect certain percent get illness, vaccine reduces number.

For example, 100k people, maybe would normally expect 100 get sick per week without vaccine(number made up...I know real number would be). vaccine, would see 5 100k get sick.

In summary, (# people) * (% effectiveness). (# people) * (% get sick) * (% effectiveness) country proves filled dumb, selfish people. It’s big deal means still spread COVID even already fully immunized. may sick , you’re still fully capable making people sick.

Too many people taken belief soon got shots forget restrictions, reality possible whole community vaccinated Okay tell idea lawsuits actually work. business sued someone got sick there. happen covid happen now. happen, lawsuit would go absolutely nowhere.

To sue, *negligence*. Meaning business exercise reasonable standard care. E.g., didn’t follow industry government standards health safety measures.

Why want incentivize businesses exercise reasonable care? benefit? employees customers know business gets sick negligence recourse. bill world economic impact I'm betting damn near everyone would onboard including Russia take China bank screw Sorry, read bunch last week Israel efficacy notice whatsoever.

The article quote link data. 93%, numbers irrelevant. trying provide context 93% arrived at, numbers required incomplete. puts useless-either-way numbers headline itself. happens talent pool also includes people developing countries work 1/10 people US work for? AFAIK there's indication far. everyone take shot, everyone keep boosters already state boosters get every 6months so. going away new variants firing over. mask mandate good nobody listens anyway. VA one still people wander places without them. Businesses mostly make policy mask service since business road allows get business. Unless blanket LAW heavy fines/jail time point mandate. People listen without examples made either law enforcement already defunded who...you guessed Democrats!! pick poison here. Yes cure everyone greatly reduced hospital rates even death rates. dumbass expecting perfect live IL, county borders STL. Apparently yesterday county vaccination clinic 80% people registered MO states. got turned away living IL, also frustrating I’m sure took away appointment slots IL residents. Vaccines protect overwork, ptsd, fatigue, whole host issues come dealing war zone year.

The article recommends improvements. BMA calling better access protective face masks, Covid-secure rest facilities, doctors able take leave haven’t yet able take. NY went 8k hospitalizations 7k week. Pretty crazy. Masks hitting trash cans bonfires June, shots arms people ditching reminders hell year plus imo. extent true. able sue usually anyway.

Where liability protections come prevent people suing negligence. force employee know symptomatic covid come work kitchen? reasonable customer would expect that, customer gets sick dies family can't sue. benefits? company. WFH sometimes prior covid colossal things going background society hard get out. like colleagues miss office interactions think go restaurant things feel better national parks beautiful tho, shame many idiots. Later! hope strategy really young kids get virus, really methodical studying longer term health impacts virus.
Once info out, parents go risk assessment. would great data say covid kids x% less dangerous childhood illnesses (flu, colds etc). That's works, OK. Yep, Montana's large since 1990, though almost sure thing we'll back two seats post 2020 census redistricting. 

Here's hoping districts made fair. solidly Republican Eastern Montana district 'leans little red still swings' Western district would great. 

However seeing redistricting went 2010, shocked see whacky wavy swerving nonsensical district lines make 2 solid Republican districts. hate rural people getting priority even Colorado rural counties fucked biggest purpose. They're ones refused masks mandatory, refused lock down, refused anything stop spread Good. Based Na, read 10% efficacy South Africa variant spreading Europe.

Fact is, nobody (at least Austria) seems really ""prefer"" least like AZ vaccine. Particularly medical staff doctors fighting hard get mRNA doses.

Europe ordered enough mRNA vaccinate (willing) adults (well, least end year) everyone wants ""the good stuff"". So? Shady lawsuits win. they're frivolous, defendant seek attorneys' fees. hand, business behave negligently, costing customers employees health safety, can't shit it.

COVID immunity stopping frivolous lawsuits. about, again, shifting money pockets poor hands wealthy. Really? waste time True. Lack childcare huge issue economy hurt many peoples careers. Schools teachers absolutely priority sick? Same! Crossing fingers reschedule June wedding I'm ready PARTY Remember thought Silicon Valley going make world better place? see 10-12 years comment? Immunizing Teachers gets students back classroom start pick education pace (online learning sucks). long term benefit vaccinate teachers. I’m hoping actually enjoy wedding November without masks! though we’ll still happy party people safely them. need build wall keep conservatives states. mean, dismisses inconsequential ones post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

I never said Portland single handedly lead messing vaccine rollout (80 year olds getting vaccine, absurd look mortality rates), rather example screwy politics are. Surely prioritize getting vaccine asap? set goal universal vaccine may waiting years ? living rock?  That's nearly 25% entire nation that's amazing progress outcome supposed happen 5 percent time millions trials news. Oh right, yeah nah live Australia mask policy punishable law government rescinded got pandemic wraps. idea you’re talking about


Have fun ya easily preventable deaths 😘 fact 80+ blowing part. argue healthcare workers direct patient care exception, outside vaccine distribution done according age IMO. Mortality rates absolutely justify that. think ridiculous I've full course vaccine AZ 80+ year olds Oregon even chance recently. I'm convinced articles talking people color hesitant get vaccine one biggest contributors people actually hesitant get damn vaccine EU's fault company used wrong portal, especially considering EU said 6 years ago use portal anymore? clearly companies mistake. Nice, Montana cold. fair tech economy benefits lockdowns considering influence tech companies government relative industries, least plausible institutional analysis. people 50% less infections means 50% less spreading. beginning knew would mutations? FL? It’s pissing lol. stay home lmao   planning trip southeast asia november 2021, know different terms govt vaccine distribution, don’t think it’s going happen planning rescheduling autumn 2022 unless miracle happens totally fine late summer. vaccine distribution among lower income countries lag greatly, ability hop around countries similar area probably restricted quite awhile Reports patients died getting COVID-19 vaccine attracted international attention. Norway, example, least 23 deaths reported. According Norwegian Institute Public Health (NIPH), **large proportion people offered vaccination first elderly,** vulnerable. Dr. Sara Viksmoen Watle, senior physician NIPH, urged 


Why? highest risk side effects, working class get back business faster? never saving us Covid contagious 9 PM, right? Literally. thought obvious start mask mandates would last thing removed majority get vaccinated. I'm fine wearing one summer. That's deadline. there? really know much natural immunity lasts

vaccine help. vaccine gets us actual end goal site. we'd fools try jump gun rush things point. got anti body test back. 

It Abbot SARS Cov 2 IGG test. Shows 7.09 index. 

Anyone insight? won’t speak doc till Wednesday results. tested positive Jan 2. people choice pretty rapidly enough MRNA vaccinate country July. argument largely debunked. different point time much supply. going substantial supply month half. people know pretty strong preference towards one another. view legislative bill leg.mt.gov.  

The two piss concealed carry changing child care ratios, care givers make money kids.  also trying change voting rules yet again.  list sitting desk HB SB numbers get you. Shrinks going clean up. Lower viral loads almost always mean lower transmission. Nothing peer reviewed yet. takes time. Actually yes. really think many higher ups get controling masses make us say. huge power complexes pandemic allows fulfill wettest dreams.

And say cannot true: humanity long long long list history people that. genetics. thing preventing travelling right minute restrictions. ALLOWED NAKED PUBLIC!!!! TRYANNY!!! people won’t choice people won’t preference. study published peer reviewed, goes without saying vaccinated individuals lower viral loads. talking spread unvaccinated individuals. 

The important part article: *”While understood smaller viral load better, clear whether reduction would enough block transmission.”*

So, no. conclusion incorrect. support reduced ability spread. I'd say 80, 85% people see day day wear masks indoors. 15-20% there's virtually enforcement level due state making illegal fine individuals wearing masks, instead fining businesses unmasked employees/patrons. even county city handed less 100 citations past year they're $100.

It's actually pretty impressive many people wear masks there's essentially risk legal penalty wearing one. Meanwhile Canada taken much seriously shows death rate 2.7x less US.

Meanwhile America gets literally act like morons gets vaccines instantly.

It's like giving liver transplant lifetime alcoholic. can't wait inevitable story come next months ultra rich able cut front vaccine lines. 👊🏻 small victories I’ll take ‘em offered respect: global vaccination drive getting started, occupy rest year sure, likelihood several years. 

It makes perfect sense U.S. government -- which. less month ago, transitioned ""it's flu"" blockheads rational adults -- focus vaccinating Americans now. plenty time opportunity U.S. provide vaccines Third World countries extremely lucky. even feel real. arbitrarily pick 65? Like aren’t 40-50 age groups also high risk. also vaccine last summer far less people degree natural immunity. hope right thing know vaccinating people actually reduces risk Covid long hauler/organ damage. far know researched (and definitely think be). Feel free correct I'm wrong, seen papers/articles this. might forgetting 450,000 US sacrifices... I'm saying vaccines given communities enforce basic mandates get priority even higher death rates. Whether city rural priority yet see rural non native american community strict stay home orders mask mandatory states hell masks poltiical? mean, know real. freaking President really almost died. Regeneron available 100% would intubated. Everyone point must know someone got sick Covid, many know people died. please stop damn anti science? death us real. Canada death rate 2.8x lower US. Meanwhile we're getting vaccines countries selfish people get instantly.

If US death rate Canada, US would 184,000 deaths.

It's like giving liver alcoholic. They're going learn. even masks distancing, still catch it. Masks 100% takes one person wearing one improperly poorly ventilated area cause outbreak. Imagine hard life would everyone dumb you. believe prayer I’ll something like honor ☝️ yet still one worst world.

Literally US ranked 9th worst death rate, Ohio recently proved counting deaths correctly, knows much higher rate actually is. They're great.

I’m unable wear contacts due eye condition, winter I’ve unable find masks don’t fog glasses point can’t see. Indoors summer it’s issue me, cold. 

Seriously, fogging glasses real issue, please dismiss it.  really hard wear mask little longer? What's wrong distancing anyway? still live full life wearing mask sitting away people, without vaccine. choosing view wearing mask little apart people physically bad thing. anything it'll make people concientious future manage they're sick. Maybe someone cold, they'll wear mask go work,like half world already begin with.

Seriously, wearing mask healthy vaccine extremely limited supply moment.

I’m sure every American vaccinated, people going uproar send poor countries.

It would ridiculous American tax dollars vaccinate non Americans still midst pandemic.  risk getting Covid ends high probability getting flu, thats negligible. reason seems negligible flu rarely causes everybody wants vaccine gets one risk adverse outcome COVID drops less flu

We know that. Studies shown risk getting long hauler blood clots organ damage Covid around 30%. Even mild asymptomatic cases get this. one said vaccine reduces risk types complications (unless actually makes immune, vaccines currently available often don't, e.g. J&amp;J mainly aims reduce severity disease AstraZeneca practically [useless South African Link?

But yeah, Toronto great city world class summertime. looks like one big dumb thumb  Goalposts far. Ray gonna miss again.  mild asymptomatic. Next. That’s thought vaccines also. didn’t see coming year ago. started kept hearing least year year half vaccine available testing 9 months later getting people vaccinated. real beginning end opinion. Solid anecdatal proof! Things can’t enjoy wearing mask. hard enjoy! Suck  hotspot South African variant Austria. 400 known cases already much sequencing. Huh? sure downvoted. know point many people want (maybe need) extremely optimistic. Still, pointed data article mention realistic opinion. that's true, stupid places like California, example, stricter limits places like Texas. Discussion well good.

That can't right. companies semi-hide proxy + $$$ how? matter, able want. said I'm open masks essential places cases low, anywhere non essential individual business. youre okay stay home, simple. rest us manipulated fear mongering media going go back normal lives.

By way little calculator risk 1.6 percent. risk I'm happy take means able things enjoy again. wish mandate indiana.. that’s situation right now. effectiveness vaccines, it’s unrealistic see covid become bad cold future.

Years ago, entire department fly another city meeting. told take two separate flights, case know, one planes doesn’t make it.

Praise (insert deity choice here)   never understand thought process think majority people get vaccine simply reward outweighs risk. 

That said, there’s way know sure whether severity 4 people’s symptoms would’ve worse without vaccine. cases asymptomatic mild anyways. There’s way quantify symptoms vs symptoms without vaccine. Different people react differently covid, valid control group 4 people, would be...those 4 people. Well point stands. effective. like it, mean effective.

Ok question whether worth lose extreme amounts freedom long period time sake getting virus likely kill you, then, whether reasonable force people accept tradeoff imprisoned will. Luckily little bit moderna 60 million doses Novavax coming could serve stop gap Republicans think choice making pandemic worse hurting economy. fact, third choice: make pandemic worse *and* hurt economy. happens health measures eased concerns scientists medical professionals. end getting worst ""options."" people end staying home anyways, enough people go keep pandemic raging.

When reported, attempted sue number media companies, freeze action, whilst investigated British Medical Council eventually struck off. media companies insisted complete action lost pay costs.

He struck number reasons, well bribe. Despite holding needed paediatric qualifications, subjected children to; 
Colonoscopies, colon biopsies spinal taps. 
Bipassed ethic committees hospital. 
He purchased blood children son's birthday party. 
Showed disregard pain suffering children studied. Nice!  led believe whole world suffering large scale problem?

We president take shot shit world liking us.

Same ever was. Pfizer vaccine effective known variants date. Even “less effective” vaccines highly effective preventing severe illness death.

As far transmission vaccinated people—it doesn’t even matter people risk dying already vaccinated. Pfizer graph show clear sign protection around 11 days. information gathered contact tracing one time since March. Central Ohio “purple” much past year. There’s way trace cases back anywhere place actually tracing. really. Israel showed stuff. like 93% 500k second doses. real world seem matching trials pretty well, exactly want see (or better). It’s even San Francisco municipalities even small ones seeing homelessness rise increase use services. Look rental relief orgs absolutely slammed every single county. young people elegible? me, 23 year old, able fly europe I'm vaccinated yet. old relic, priority, able to.
Sounds like discrimination me.  niece November. Still cannot taste food like used to, constantly tired become depressed “the kid got covid” treated peers becoming sick. It’s definitely survival rates. going go normal business millions people dying.

I sure hell not. used dine least week. eaten restaurant since March cut takeout twice month. see changing long time. 🥳🥂🎊 actual mathematical chances happening though?

Can anyone back envelope calculation? Elon Musk said? Nah, America really. outdoor dining subsidizing masks

You must live either Hawaii, Southern California Florida. Flu season overlaps winter completely odds comfortable outdoor dining. Yep, I’m one living motels, summer fall, lived mostly tent commercial campground (because woman, it’s safer.) lease non-renewal ‘eviction’ subletter didn’t really rental protections early pandemic thought hey I’ll Airbnb month even though lost job able get back soon (god naive!) 

But yeah one really traveling am, motels people like families facing homeless crisis. It’s impossible qualify rent nearly everywhere without job you’ve year, paid least 35-40k year, current landlord. Even small time private landlords want full lease upfront can’t qualify order overlook qualifications. Single rooms subletted must also approved landlord it’s like can’t rent low. 

There many barriers even without eviction record. (And it’s eviction filing goes report- even WIN still there.) happens folks haven’t able pay rent? That’s going come due. least give monthly backpay people catch make good rent. don’t know- don’t think idea bad housing crisis get. keep forgetting Montana state lol Surprise he’s R. hate science much. Basically there’s people population super susceptible covid. happen touch frozen chain faces. Like people Montana followed mandate first place... still stupid though first example Mexican TV star South Florida get vaccine. live here.

I fan incentivizing medical tourism right now. also fan incentivizing uncontrolled border crossing. like flexibility I’ve had- feel like need office go, want sleep bit wfh that’s also cool. Would happy continue forever tbh Poorer countries receive free eventually. 
I know selfish say this, think first world countries give away vaccine paid good money for. 

Money talks. US rich countries save people, expect hope send excess doses abroad vaccines protect variants, discussed many times. OP clearly saying many people 65 vaccinated knowing account 80% deaths, numbers deaths start dropping rapidly. 

Spreading nothing OP said. Oh! That’s great!  moron. absolutely itching get out, thing stopping ice cold weather. normal feel gloomy February, different can't even see colleagues face-to-face. March comes around feel much better. Ethan Joe equally crazy. Ethans attitude doesn’t accomplish anything.  Lmao yes, South Africa cases like 80% peak massive wave reinfection Also similar size population size makeup US EU. might missing similar general trend CFR fall? Like moment, limited genetic surveillance, likely catch cases end hospital? felt way remembered bad shape last summer. We've yet come close levels Well expect, UK variant that's vast majority cases UK, SA one, immediate concern summer, booster shots planned that.   
 
But also , although seem stop minor cases SA strain, scientists confident still prevent severe cases, can't see serious lockdowns would still necessary. People overly obsessed efficacy % sub seem fully grasp signifies doesn't. They'll get new strand.

It's theoretically possible virus mutate happen get back classic version, extremely unlikely. Thanks insight! Makes lot sense. really didn’t know India big pharma player. 

I remember back late February 2020, people America started feel like virus might becomes big deal, read article said may shortages medications like Tylenol due critical ingredients manufactured countries. bought fresh bottle haven’t thought much sense. So, turns Hm? machine translation garbage.  Seriously get understand year freaking later. Even simply break voting lines (not great metric least baseline) 74 million people probably trying follow CDC guidelines limited consumer spending. Taking 50% spending population restricted spending adding actual government restrictions, add super swell economy.

If would seriously gotten control like many countries, could opened pretty reasonably least part last year far targeted restrictions. Instead get persistent restrictions, consumer confidence, general irritation everyone. WHOLE FREAKING YEAR. wear mask? need government tell you? Great news, great progress, hope stay track. lockdowns going impossible soon highest risk get shots. We’re already looking now. Masks absolute last thing governors/mayors lift masks visual cue/reminder everything else, also masks probably biggest power struggle since last year.

I don’t think Facui/CDC ever officially say masks longer recommended widely worn people healthy (even reason think they’ve exposed), expect point say they’re required anymore except people ill. Smartest minds didn’t put neither things things. Greedy corporations did. Don’t negate advances science sake “woke” debate. 

But understand reason question anything. right reason scientist suspect any. It’s lifetime pandemic. 

But means, don’t get vaccine. Frankly one would really care. choice thinks what’s best. smarter brighter minds thinks different. Maybe leave economically depressed, plague infested, pre-civil war US? Probably fall. month, people still getting accustomed this. people get vaccinated evidence transmission low whole, able drop masks. meant stay house, stay Missoula. explains dread coming back here. always tough coming home college, pandemic  also gutted county health boards here. want elected officials make discussions. experts, guy gal I’d love beer with. surprised 50% US population covid end Jan 2021. say this, weather warms people going go enjoy life, vaccine not.

I downtown city today people everywhere. 25 degrees out, overcast snow sidewalks ... one gave shit. could tell people itching get house socialize, drink eat.

I hope chicken littles assholes press end doom gloom bullshit. I'm still :'( Lakes? guys lakes (cries billings)

I get mean. Unfortunately, really easy fear monger here. ""Candidate X wants take guns"". goes vote. 

I know people believe anything fox news tells them, matter ridiculous. swear last week someone tell Biden getting rid thanksgiving.... sometimes lost cause can't actually choose go back billings since I'm student go back summer. nice thought    purpose get scientific data countries make judgement. got samples virus wuhan. provided countries instructions test infection. mission accomplished that.

Everything else subject China willing let say. China definitely want say ""close border China"" didn't. china source risk rest world china object.

People complaining inconsistencies guidance understanding political limitations operates. never intended substitute local health authorities, provide science need cannot get countries.  honestly can’t figure out. like aren’t vaccines coming MT. I’m Yellowstone county moved age limit 70. mother law trying get shot three weeks. 1000 week park county... comment higher. even hint condescension comment, ended optiminism, even contradict claim. 

In words, getting upset correct information. mask wearing transit isn’t issue. don’t care wearing mask train. Fuck ever wearing mask bar, restaurant, concert, etc we’re vaccinated. know meant say way, posts makes seem like people getting vaccines morally weak impatient. hope mean say health care situation relies risks others make treatment reliable. 

And vaccinated person catches covid dies it, fine. far diabetics vaccinated hospitalized died Covid, things going well indeed. gets really depressing looking basically anywhere reddit save sub, people assert we’re getting back normal 10-12 years (saw word word) vaccines don’t reduce spread, half population anti-vax. ice cold takes brought completely unrelated threads get hugely upvoted. People real comfy.   choose go restaurant, get Covid, it’s fault. don’t deserve it, sure asking it.

In better world, everybody restaurants either vaccinated Covid within last three months. 

In perfect world, nobody eats restaurants over, plus govt supports businesses.

I hope ends soon. MMA basketball. variant seem able escape antibody response.

You can’t tell looking mutations whether they’ll interfere immune response. actually test out. Ok us voted him. represents Christian right small business owners Montana, ignore everything else like body slamming reporters believing dinosaurs. western side state favore him. first republican governor long time Montana, like everything else, years behind electing mad man run state.

Therefore risk adults either vaccinated offered vaccine, every single restrictions needs lifted. masks, capacity restrictions, rolling lockdowns. Nothing. 
  
It seems like people forget since year ago, restrictions still place supposed **extreme temporary last minute solutions** something supposed carry years.  Right still phase really want one actively seeking doses getting them. wonder reach limit cohort switch ""now convince everyone else"" mode. I'm still skeptical go smoothly get people. Shit!

It’s month feel 100%. trade American ""freedoms"" communism. hell social safety nets! would rather eat paint wall give away guns! /s said 50% mayor (or governor, know correct term) Dheli said months ago deaths province 60% higher reported, ""mayors"" smaller towns said 30% higher. end really hard think higher number

Ah 40/60% infected practically impossible, find studio? Unless affected village whole country seems really difficult... jobs come back like flip switch. Lots small businesses closed. Many larger ones learned less. look back 2008/2009. took several years regain lost jobs.

Just look unemployment rate here: 5% Feb 2008, peaked 10% Oct 2009 get back 5% September 2015. Still thrilled rollout. spending ton time helping elderly relatives get scheduled, heard one second appointment canceled Friday anticipation snow (there snow Friday). think get ""sometime March"". better way. totally get you’re coming sure you’re downvoted either. countries would exact thing more: examine successes approaches thoroughly find takeaways populations.

Satan entered chat. study. yes obviously quite still need money live money comming from? Australia - 29,000 cases TOTAL...OVER ENTIRE getting 3x infections single day, another country entire pandemic - must real source pride you.

Don't get wrong, previous President fucked royally, killed half million citizens rank incompetence inaction.

Having eastern coast virtually shut time taken economic toll well. Maybe correct path let virus burn population times? Maybe serious long-term health risks eventually kill many many more? time tell.

PS. Let's get working another year come cure common cold too... would impinge liberties. drunk driving scares you, wear seatbelt.

I'm trying figure serious not. feel bad mods, huffy boys.  realize ownership locals two different words correlated. believe google yourself. Yet they've little say Ireland imposing €100 fines Irish citizens travelling across border north south. Seems legally binding treaties GFA mean fuck all. Interesting countries higher covid 19 death count excess deaths. enlightened souls...mortals like us never understand actions. Exactly, live GA society back normal. Packed bars restaurants every day. thing missing sporting events I’ve seen plenty reports it, must limiting view. vaccine received supposed 90% effective prevention, troubling.

This could new mutations could lock us even longer. herd immunity. no, jumping joy actually over. cases dropping fast compared previous case peaks? think enough people vaccinate big impact decline maybe factors? mean PA. Liquor wine sold state shop. bottle shop could sell 3 6packs time. distributor could sell barrels cases.

It weirdest thing. changed?.

Shit friend ordered case wine shipped state store. citizen grand country fully expect(ed) government provide support neighbors compatriots.

And part American history led believe this? real. would love know. allergic reaction saline? legal recourse made whole like would normal circumstances. 

Isn’t National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program for? Stop please, next tell Scotland's deaths count devolved government hahah. Looks like American better understanding country do. 4 mild asymptomatic cases too.

That's want, people getting doses, they're exposed covid get sniffles perfectly fine that's desired outcome, flaw. still active. much people compared 20 years ago still active. :) mild symptomatic too? However cope? Well he's right, even want hear it. think world knew gone. MAYBE get back day hear Covid news anymore. far. around 10 months knows long give protection going plan. mind vaccine elderly at-risk population making covid endemic learning live it. Obviously Australia NZ seems zero covid doesn’t seem possible unless want close borders decade Sorry I'm missing something, even checking valentine's day morning, anybody know CDC Tracker updated numbers 3 days? That's actually remarkably better national average. 10% nationally compared 1% Iowa saying vaccine killing people. How? killed many kittens Hopefully it’ll quickly drop J&amp;J rollout. doubt it, chance good source this? one planet 'right' harm others.  
GTFO bullshit, please. mean, like vaccine... wife December 2019. seen “upper respiratory viral infection” 18th. tested positive antibodies March 2020. CCP lying fucks. am, idiot, reading “more 15 meters UK first Covid jab” Gen Z comes... Gen R (R 'Rona)?  better qualify destination.


Editing: read also read headlines. headline horrible misleading 

“The CDC added recommend people travel time.
“If someone must travel, get tested viral test 1-3 days trip,” agency said. “After travel, getting tested viral test 3-5 days post-travel staying home self-quarantining 7 days, even test results negative, recommended public health measure reduce risk.”” Didnt lash Modi regarding farmers protest...?

Man awkward Best them? Exactly everyone else. Best given since there's shortage higher cost mRNA vaccines? traditional ones, like Oxford's. Produce mRNA vaccines succeed making Yeah, surprised 90 year olds die given week absurd.

That's we've last year so. No, get what's offered soon get it. Also people told ""We relax safety measures 6 months"" several hear ""We pretty much forget safety measures 4 months... maybe sooner"". notable 4 people got vaccine testing positive covid? Wow, **four** cases?! Shut down, vaccines work. think it’s public opinion changing. People care public health sure year this, lot people sick invasive measures wants lives back.

There’s mainly 3 groups now:

1. People want restrictions end March/April vulnerable vaccinated.

2. People ok restrictions till enough people vaccinated herd immunity, least want see begin phased year. 

3. People want years till eradication there’s even 1% chance could save someone Covid.

In September, would say Group 3 majority since last US administration’s Covid response joke far knew, could’ve still months away vaccine.

In February, vaccines new administration pledging take pandemic seriously, people Groups 1 2 point. spread misinformation. Yes. little fuck loves national spotlight attention getting. think need realize there's difference vaccinations case rates. Case rates dropping lag behind vaccinations, especially we're opening time.

This public health officials messed vaccine messaging focusing going still need mask/distance/etc vaccination.... emphasizing that's *temporary*, hammer bring cases quickly accelerate return normal. completely odd headline

Not odd, fear mongering. four coronaviruses! Many people get reinfected yearly! Given there's already strong evidence virus circulating parts Europe December 2019, surprise. put tamper evident stickers cups. Also, mine sells six packs too. Truly shock lot
Of people dismissed offhand Masks, worn properly, shoulder-to-shoulder scenario *is exactly situation show effectiveness!* Arrr lovely person, 13 million people care live die.

Gibraltar British Overseas Territory, whilst technically UK banner, essentially miniature state right. 

It controls healthcare, education etc. etc. links i've provided listed seperate entity (Look Falklands Bermuda examples this)

Funny, call us uneducated know territories work. news necessarily imply China lying. Many cases discovered outbreak, reviewing patients records testing stored samples. thinks 1000 cases Wuhan December 15% severe cases went hospitals might seen, subset correctly diagnosed time.

We must remember RT-PCR test SARS-CoV-2 yet exist, developed January. Cases December identified based symptoms, astute clinicians spotted cases among sea respiratory diseases, mostly 100 confirmed laboratory tests.

The RT-PCR test developed Jan 12, retrospective diagnoses. dream day hope you’re right I’m saying what’s happening it’s known fact foreign agents working cause chaos social media. Don’t believe everything see read internet. UK variant absolutely dominant variant US November. People act like there’s genomic testing US really there’s enough catch newly spreading variants. cases variant would shown genome testing. four common endemic coronaviruses provide 6-12 months immunity many get reinfected every year 18 months. 

Why everybody saying ""virology obvious, 8th grade science, duh can't get viruses twice"" much confidence simply wrong? every virus chicken pox specifically coronaviruses give us less year immunity. Maybe one different, seems like SARS1 might be, humble possibilities instead acting like bunch overconfident 10th graders. 

I'm seeing much overconfidence regard science here, painful watch everyone make fun people knowing ""obvious"" *incorrect* ""facts"" biology. lmaoooo think end goal is? Biden administration stopping / reducing testing im hearing lot people hence test numbers dropping 81% till weeks ago? rule adopted beginning British based early information April 2020. know rule 6 ft less 15 minutes without masks wishful thinking. Korean Chinese studies indoor flow/ contagion comprehensive accurate.

Other countries like UK changed rules knowledge progressing. US, never changed, otherwise people couldn’t eating indoors go school, offices pretty much one room indoor activities. countries windows doors need open ventilation. recommendations here.  Zero Covid Covid equivalent Green New Deal - radical idea supported small minority advocates. Green New Deal, whether agree Zero Covid pretty irrelevant. political make happen. couple blue checks, states Aus NZ. 

It's harder find wild US, exist. Smallllll minority though. think see minimal cases per day vaccinated, story may change. ""cheering pandemic"" look like you? Cases falling holiday past people less busy bumping other. change mask mandate occurred. entrance new strains lifting mandate time super bowl Sunday time tell. point open ended question.

Although awkwardly nothing persons part protect others would seem common sense. Time tell. don’t get you’re downvoted much. Even worst non-fatal cases/long term complications people like bring extremely rare. 

Be smart. Wear mask. Get tested. Get vaccine. get you’re 60 you’ll likely fine you’ll likely fully recover. Period. I’ll never forget phone dad saying “they 40 THOUSAND cases today.” terrifying. can’t wait 40,000 cases day Fuck Chinese government Iconic. We’ve much better. I’m proud Country ❤️🇺🇸❤️✝️ &amp;#x200B;

2030? evidence that? I've seen one make prediction advocated anyone I've seen.

The logic keeping protocol avoid rebound rates next months. I'm sure know, protocols relaxed virus always rebounds people die. 

But we're closing stretch. vaccinations better weather bring pandemic less deadly territory. question months, years. Yep vaccinations finish Yes, articles said 2023. seems optimistic me. year half ridiculously long time frame expect recovery. sure everyone piling article making claim. Dihydrogen monoxide kills people sharks vending machines combined ! Pretty much nothing half country lol think missed point. love vaccines booked grandparents appointment early January, already gained full protection.

What meant people randomly show symptoms whatever reason, even received placebo. someone gets sick vaccination, vaccination cause. BEEP BOOP COMRADE Significantly younger population. 4x US's population, 60% adults 65 (80M vs 50M). 75s, 40% (28M vs 20M).

France seeing baby bust nine months first covid lockdown

Feb. 11, 2021 8:30 a.m. GMT+1

SAINT-DENIS, France — France confined 64 million people one world's strictest coronavirus lockdowns last spring, widespread speculation a baby boom would follow.

“I thought myself: They’re stuck home, need occupy themselves. So, they’ll make babies,” recalled Martine Mabiala Moussirou, midwife coordinator main public hospital Saint-Denis, city outskirts Paris one France’s highest birthrates.

Nine months on, though, instead boom, France witnessing sharp decline births. Economic uncertainty, social stress cases anxieties virus appear prompted families abandon postpone plans baby.

The number babies born Saint-Denis hospital plummeted 20 percent mid-December mid-January expected remain 2020 levels least first half year. the coronavirus wards hives activity last week, lights maternity ward dimmed corridors empty.

“Usually, it’s bustling here,” said Mabiala Moussirou, chatting midwives next board showing occupancy status ward’s nine delivery rooms.

Only one use.

Other maternity wards France reporting similar trends, cities Italy. drop births is predicted for United States, well.

The unusually quiet hospital wards early sign pandemic may indirectly shape demographics. also one many indications toll women.

Some developing countries registering the beginnings baby boom, triggered part reduced funding access contraceptives family planning services pandemic.

But France developed countries, pandemic birth slump emerging, implications decades come.

A dramatic drop births

The full effect coronavirus pandemic France’s birthrate won’t known months. experts increasingly confident sudden drops hospitals steep, widespread abrupt coincidental.

“We’re seeing decline everywhere across northeast France,” said Olivier Morel, academic director obstetrics gynecology department university hospital Nancy.

At five big university hospitals region, births declined 10 25 percent January compared month last year, according figures provided Morel.

Those drops far steeper normal year-on-year variations, usually low single digits.

“Throughout career, never seen 10 25 percent decline,” Morel said.

Further south Lyon, France’s second-biggest metropolitan area, two hospitals said recorded combined 19 percent decline births January — drop attributed pandemic.

Italy experienced Europe’s first major outbreak first Western country declare a national lockdown in March. Births declined 21 percent across 15 major Italian cities in December, according report published country’s statistics institute last week.

By contrast, hospitals German capital Berlin far noticed significant downward trend, city hit less severely than hot spots France Italy impose level lockdown.

Why families postponed

or abandoned plans

Demographers aren’t surprised drop births health workers France might be.

“Fertility historically sensitive cyclical events wars, economic crises, epidemics even climatic conditions,” said Arnaud Régnier-Loilier, research director France’s National Institute Demographic Studies. “These events result decrease increase births.”

The Greek financial crisis, example, contributed baby bust.

Where children? Greece’s financial crisis led baby bust.

Sometimes, impact transcends borders. 1986 Chernobyl disaster, researchers noticed an unusually low birthrate Italy nine months later.

Researchers suspect that multiple factors associated coronavirus pandemic may depressing fertility rates.

Economic uncertainty big one. People thinking last spring whether baby may found work seen major economies experiencing record contractions. France, economy shrank 5.8 percent first quarter 2020, largest decline since record-keeping began 1949, according national statistics office.

Although France European governments quick offer subsidies furloughed workers, understanding supports would temporary industries might recover anytime soon. left many people feeling less secure.

The constraints lockdowns also may worked decisions add baby. families felt pressure older children home schools closed. couples may found constant proximity strained relationship. might calculated need shield older relatives would reduce support would get new parents.

Researchers also exploring severity coronavirus outbreaks may influenced family planning decisions. areas France reporting drop births also among the hardest-hit areas during first wave infection, suggesting possible correlation.

Under stress Saint-Denis

Saint-Denis place multiple stresses collided.

It one of France’s poorest cities, located region one highest excess mortality rates due covid.

Many 110,000 residents barely managed stay afloat pandemic. virus hit, city’s informal economy collapsed, leaving undocumented immigrants without income way qualify unemployment benefits. closure schools meant children could longer get heavily subsidized meals many families relied on.

In cramped apartments Saint-Denis’s housing projects, enduring spring lockdown — people allowed go day, essential reasons — especially hard.

Those conditions helped propel riots in Parisian suburbs late April — may depressed fertility rates well.

Violent protests Paris suburbs reflect tensions lockdown

The lockdown led surge domestic violence, said Ghada Hatem-Gantzer, obstetrician heads hospital-linked center women Saint-Denis.

“More usual, women came asking abortion because, said, ‘I cannot kids someone became violent lockdown,’ ” Hatem-Gantzer said.

But portion women citing reason increased last year, overall number abortions not, said.

MaMaMa, local charity set support mothers babies pandemic, hasn’t yet seen impact declining births. 15,000-square-foot warehouse, volunteers still welcome constant stream mothers coming free essentials, bottles, food clothes. financial strains bring women MaMaMa may also prevent future births.

Nogochami, 27, waiting turn MaMaMa, wheeling sleeping 8-month-old stroller. baby born France’s first lockdown, time family’s income dropped dollars day.

“We’ll wait long time next child,” said Nogochami, gave first name undocumented immigrant Ivory Coast. “Everything difficult. can’t another one now.”

Possibly prolonged impact

Mabiala Moussirou, midwife coordinator, said still hoping speedy rebound births, even boom, women regain confidence future. colleagues less optimistic.

While economy France European countries slowed less expected end last year, economists still warn double-dip recession. Meanwhile, resurgence virus fears contagious variants brought second third lockdowns Europe.

Initial findings a long-term study conducted Morel doctors northeast indicate pregnant women’s economic concerns grown.

“I really believe face significant drop number births several years,” Morel said.

And continent already dealing rapidly aging populations declining fertility rates, said, spark “serious concern.” deaths underreported too. Many deaths reported pneumonia stroke isnt sort better you’re aware right? cares nationality deceased are? something humans whole deal it’s really fucking dumb people still dick measuring contests fucking body counts
 
Edit: guy talking Europeans lost lives. It’s US vs EU. anywhere vs anywhere fact year still dealing mind blowing 3mo payslips might prove ability pay rent month, still need save first last month's rent, safety deposit, application fees. Move costs frequently 3mo's worth rent anyway. cases existed, there’s reason believe anyone knew anything. 

Despite constant memes, covid looks like cold flu almost everyone. would take months spread cluster hospitalizations would noticed. Yes... 775,000 humans lost still travesty despite larger population size. standing you! #together get ZeroCovid control! ones close. Im disease expert we’re clear.

Anyways I’ve seeing lot articles sub saying stuff like time build better natural immunity Covid, least mutates fight better.

Would eventually lead huge numbers cases, possibly 300k day since we’re bit better protected like flu? I’m talking years future believe number confirmed cases transmission frozen food packaging. possible that's contracted virus. June - read. empty homes homeless. dont think exactly care. June - read. June - read. forget /s first part...? expected exactly did. Actually I'm amazed got stimulus all. Colorado 10% people vaccinated. Nothing, everyone likes think something Trump leaving office. zero covid isn’t long term strategy

That's right, needed finish vaccination campaign. can't imagine voting Obama twice Trump twice. Like could see people really hate Clinton, Obama Trump would appeal person? Quaranteens? People 20's 30's primary drivers coronavirus. get vaccinated first curve flattened fastest. We'll see state local governments fall there's talk another wave (since seasonal). also makes smokers murderers, drivers might potentially involve someone accident... like might potentially infect someone virus.

Funny works.

We murderers! that's door, resume lives? Lol go Google cover Cuomo, you’ll see NYT articles appears several articles right leaning outlets. CNN doesn’t want article front page Google results.

This article posted r/politics got around 300 upvotes, meanwhile article ice cream Biden eating got thousands upvotes. suppressed goes narrative.

Just asked father constantly watching CNN impeachment never heard new allegations.

It may news, trying downplay it. thread hates idea ""zero covid"", makes sense, I've never actually seen anyone claim *support* ""zero covid"". Best advice I’d heard force walk outside. Hope feel better soon clarity, getting reinfected strain, ones different enough confound immune system? both? infections reportedly less severe.  

It's binary ""protected not"".  results Israel astounding wonderful. tend agree always going worse US, 800 US military installations located overseas, US headquarters many concerns global footprint tremendous number foreign companies operations US. 

Even could stamped domestic community spread martial law, would come right back simply much traffic airports, seaports, land borders contact tracing quarantines keep check. Source, “dude trust me” ""zero covid"" actually policy position worried about? definitely think horrible idea, everything I've heard politicians comes pure virtue signalling. mean seems even Australia New Zealand plan rejoin world vaccine widely available countries. really interested debating whether companies should, not, allow rollover, point everyone I've talked not. surprise b/c basically policy even normal they'd rather work every employee bone wonder productivity suffers.

? policy means people meant take vacation time year, store up. want police vacation day fraud, enforce via use lose it. already mild annoyance 

It’s called FLU. ridiculous. Hold presses!!!! Someone found 95% effective vaccine 100% effective!!! HOLD PRESSES!!!! know many grandmas working world helping support ailing spouses, children, grandchildren, biggest fear right death. loved ones would able cope without income. people lost jobs, societally meaningful scales, already lacked monetary benefits resources things done pandemic.

Oh please. saying minimum wage earners lost jobs? 100,000+ small businesses closed paid minimum wage? I'd like see evidence that. went making $100k/year $0k/year I'm far alone. can't 10% unemployment booming economy time, unless completely sweep people rug let rot die. Well yeah, executive branch federal government alone powerful. Things like real downside federalism. Never said was. I’m saying it’s crazy different reality situation turned expectations start. Everyone told we’d need mandatory isolation two weeks flatten curve, instead needed isolate months keep curve flat happens vaccine rollout states pull away others doses administered? Like Alaska WV keep getting doses demand drops off, get held back even rest states give states supply?

Just curious say awesome? statement chief medical advisor previously stated already booked holiday summer. turn around say one look book holidays summer. 

I want believe true, amount U-Turns government issued last 11 months insane. I'll believe see scenario. Whilst basically every area painfully slow reactive, vaccines ahead curve reaping rewards. joining EU scheme criticised time still eligible turned going alone better way. article month old! makes sense, statistics they're talking also January stats week behind. I'm saying disagree you. question is: spike start October? time, told something colder weather.  love grandma already! trust Trump administration’s handling pandemic?

“It’s hoax”

“It’ll go away soon”

“Don’t wear masks, doesn’t help”

“Drink bleach” Precisely! Even articles backed facts termed 'clickbaity', everyone absolutely quote websites beginning. Corrugated manufacturing northwest Indianapolis. Disease control WHO’s specialty fun dying spreading family Mexico. Thanks. Two masks bare minimum please. Guess never get back normal everyone vacationing. us worry soon really need vaccination effort succeed asap. definitely feel like lot people going feel way. way feel like I’ve wasted last year really anything, also got fantastic new job place. March 2020 woke every day hating job. It’s small win need keep reminding of. need redo US trial start thrown protocol serious adverse event UK took long explain FDA. People missed second dose.

And FDA interested adding literal random dosing timing trial protocol, accepting foreign trial come close specs.

 Since you’re criticizing article, point us ‘better’ source disputes figures? Agreed -- see term ""fearmongering"" tossed around way often, articles calling caution awareness. Highly sus.  “Rumors waning antibodies”

Is rumor? thought antibodies wane, it’s immunity doesn’t. [Also dumb. Really, really dont understand everyone said ""This behaves like virus does"" spoke side mouth saying ""You get re-infected, unlike virus's"" - one it? virus virus. hell would able get reinfected virus. Ok vaccine best recovered covid? 50% would likely represent offered everyone except children. point should’ve large moral responsibility keep large mitigation measures place. Meanwhile, Canada...

I wonder uniforms drycleaned. could aerosolise surface contamination. realized whom? US still registering 7-day averages 2700+ deaths/day significant community transmission. Goal posts moved, that's always bad. Never considered numbers good enough encourage indoor activities dining. depends whether cases/hospitalizations/deaths continue fall rapidly vaccinations continue rise rapidly (which doubts about), could see reasonably opening soon July/August. 13.9 million permanent residents US considered foreign nationals. allowed stay US long want. pay taxes US Citizens pay. really hope some, rather millions foreign nationals getting vaccinated US. called ""study"" used like 6mg zinc per day 800 mg vitamin C. call high dose? study done pharma plenty bias promote drugs. knock virus “normal” sickness. aware immune system vaccination might accomplish Meanwhile, US administering 4x *per day*. clearly building sarcasm previous comment. Silly assume people wouldnt need /s agree, know long natural immunity lasts. Along logic, also think two doses vaccine overkill considering could given twice many people single dose way less time, since enough hard data (for reason) efficacy that, feasible proceed way.

We enough data probably say ""if covid last four months *probably* immune next four, please refrain getting vaccine amount time"" would honor system likely. Adding many conditions need officially verified slow process more. Long haul doesn’t mean reinfection. Infrequent sub honestly don’t know wtf going on. It’s lot scare tactics false info thrown around. best thing could get sub That's... takeaway here. It’s France. Parents every night affairs Covid, babies nothing left try blow. Canada like 20.

The flu serious people prior pandemic trying beat people’s heads take flu seriously. It’s frankly something States stupid at, several countries wear masks prevent spreading flu.  Yeah, sooo even though that. doesn’t effect much decrease... random people go federal buildings like grocery store? Maybe like 100 people one building?! already “mandate” per say airplanes airports... sooo you’re dumb. 

Quit condescending thinking I’m ignorant didn’t google search every minutiae factor called 52 executive orders considered abusive Trump president. Get yourself...  outlier sure. Reinfection also broad term. exposed symptoms , congrats, immune system it’s thing fine, technically “reinfected”. telling anecdotally symptoms I’d either call liar, incredibly unlucky.

Basically touched surface immediately someone else. everything supports fomite also supports aerosol. Yes happen it’s rare. it’s incredibly rare get younger healthy, I’m talking about.  Without locking city, NZ. cases spread unless stop them.

If 80% people want get vaccinated hold 20% vaccinate will. horrible website experience. Every country keeps extending so-called lockdowns. Moreover, prime minister cannot unilaterally determine country's restrictions; responsibility provincial premiers. Also, scenario already discarded available evidence. feel sentiment. We’re one income virus’s impact jobs. enough funds plus one us insurance stressful. Good you, comparing raw case numbers country 25 million country 328 million immediately reveals ignorance. think worrying needlessly. article nothing new basic. already chronic lung conditions may susceptible. link posted people got severely sick. 

If makes feel better asthma lot allergies. rescue inhaler all. Covid hit October breathing wasn’t affected all. fever honestly. Yeah mildly annoyed fever family members go hospital, one (who would ineligible vaccine today) passed.

Who knows gave who, right, mildly annoyed whole thing. Honest question: health system coped amount patients caused COVID? get close collapse? 

Because I’m amazed amount cases US haven’t heard system collapsed, heard New York issues storages bodies early on, much else it. in-laws adamant can’t transmit COVID vaccinated. I’ve heard opposite - anyone aware article study discusses transmission? Thank advance!  I'm hoping masks become conscientious thing people they're sick something contagious. That's what's happening, developed within year  testing, hospitalizations/deaths, dramatically worse winter prior point. massive undetected spread we've seen similar hospitalization numbers. Wyoming sells sloshies (slushies alcohol) certain gas stations. pretty sweet. Kansas City resident here. Absolutely infuriating biggest population centers shafted compared rural counties KS MO. Lower density areas keep virus away inherently. anti-vaxxer that's think. logical thinking tells everything risk. individual make proper risk assessments. anything, crisis told lot people find difficult thing. It’s they’re country needs least right I've lost year life thing. think going footnote memory. Wow! people argue Trump actually work political theather mad actually pretty decent plan. deaths caused falling high windows ""accidental ingestion nerve agents"" wasnt mild annoyance.. awful, think bad flu worse. week. 3 months later still taste smell.. still easily winded, still exhausted. Tell mild annoyance. Yeah. going simple rebound like many think be. recover many closed businesses, lost jobs, fill newly constructed empty buildings overnight everything fine again. possible lot country follow mask social distance guidance land border airport questions always struck difficult address. NZ 3 international airports, US iirc. semi-trucks pass Laredo, TX day alone, pass US-Canadian border day alone. would somehow isolate truck driver passing two weeks rotating schedule optimum containment. 

At least seaport trade AUS NZ, straightforward divert crew change another country quarantine 50 crew members two weeks must disembark, otherwise offloading done crane. Issa joke kinda. keep extending I’m exaggerating comedic effect...  Vaccines save lives.

Not wearing masks put lives risk.

I'm sure smart enough understand difference. Wrong. mask mandate federal property, federal mask mandate public transport, international travelers show proof negative COVID test prior entering country. Defense Production Act invoked, etc. etc. least modicum research posting hot takes like this. Really?! I'm shook. kidding... surprise there. Ask yourself: metrics evaluating efficacy safety vaccines? come them? better metrics FDA?

How much longer would wait feel safe? Why? 

How many research papers published read assure you? number?

Since trust early Fauci vaccine take years, would summarily reject vaccines developed within year? scientists allowed change advices based new evidence? think that's bad, imagine diabetes. Canada locked 2023. insane? Strange apply logic vaccine manufacturers. Canadian here. prime minister determine province's restrictions, premier does. vaccine deliveries rapidly increasing vaccines soon approved. Uh. whole point many positions before. businesses closed. Lobbying probably?  

In Wisconsin illegal purchase alcohol retailers/liquor stores 8/9/10pm depending county. Bars open 3AM.  
This law exists solely Tavern League lobbied it. lumped like every known symptom together called terrible. younger healthy people won’t know Covid. symptoms mimic flu. sever flu, flu.

Those majority cases. aren’t younger healthy gonna get hit like truck. that’s terrible. I’m discussing  true, Israel ~9M people thin strip land US already administered 50M doses. like 10M US full vaccination it’s like we’ve already vaccinated Israel. really hope look back highlight disdain people want wear mask ""bEcAuSe lIbErTy"" Israel proper likely done one month less. back old normal. Keep mind tests lagged 7 10 days original exposure. good news dominant strain Israel recently UK one, Pfizer’s shot seems work pretty well variant, likely others well.  Honestly curious - Biden done affect this? Testing also wayyyy down. consider least something good came horrible outbreak had! Yeah, man, everyone accepts face value, make sense. Cases declining could attributed vaccination. ""post-holiday surge,"" literally every scientist said inevitable. Schools reopening states relaxing restrictions. 

Has anyone considered people believe situation getting better would less likely get tested? ""Oh, must cold. Covid cases declining, all."" cases, would experience Covid cold, since proportionally severe cases. time, fewer severe cases may develop vulnerable populations ones vaccinated first. logically follow Covid spreading--I think we're detecting it.

I'm suggesting nefarious plot anything. I'm suggesting wishful thinking getting way healthy skepticism. scientist, I'd definitely want concrete answer seemingly unattributable drops case numbers. seems like confirmation bias societal level. read article? implies CDC want recommend recommending would encouraging travel. It’s tradition liberals love government telling really not. draconian restrictions every often vs. reasonable restrictions mixed vaccines - I'll easily take second option. lmao, even question? shows Pfizer vaccine likely superior ones including Novavax probably including Moderna 85% efficacy senior citizens original strain focus getting Pfizer many places possible fewer mid-tier vaccines KINDLY needful cdc announced (fully) vaccinated (with caveats) need quarantine prior potential exposure. Yet, still need mask social distance. coward states dropped mask mandates when?

Obviously Montana Iowa last Sunday.

Do data two weeks date repeal mask mandates.

Also think would give like 3-4 week range. people process things.

That gives bit time contemplating stopping use masks make minds play implications heads. words already want wear mask immediately jump cease use face coverings fence take bit longer decide one way other.  Contact tracing mostly non existent. Outbreaks real, happened lot restaurant bar industry. Source: work industry, friends. Majority places don’t offer health care would support us? Woah, thanks update. Luckily vaccine already made popping blue flasks won’t anything 😅 wrong though, turned nowhere near contagious thought would be. expecting infected person went store they'd infect everyone inside they'd immediately infect families. actually turned mitigation effective could reduce cases near single digits, places might anywhere near 60% places like Manaus completely botched response let spread almost uncontrolled. ""everyone's going catch virus imminently"" angle incredibly stupid spread around given little really knew virus, probably level fearmongering media. CDC believes close 130M infections would around 500k deaths assuming 0.4% IFR. 

If India similar percent infection 0.2% IFR, would around 1M deaths. Certainly thank 500k. Could 2M. People countries get defensive realistic numbers get mentions. PPP

The putting multi unit apartment buildings least 60% empty.

I ask, many apartments vastly overpriced area?   meet new people date, many singles acknowledged 'digital intimacy' important pandemic. Let's honest... done UK end April. done US probably late May mid June. It’s lmao. don’t care you’ll likely give random people COVID? get yourself? spreading Chinese lies propaganda lol

Hard believe rock band suppose. Assuming every single one excess deaths covid death, puts fatality rate around .5 .6% Still pretty high every American gets hospitals overrun we're talking least couple million dead. that's Checkmarked users. Israel UAE still performing better currently, lower populations compared UK expect one finish first.  isn’t always courting biggest demographic group. It’s pleasing certain group help deliver political victory. essentially june BOOK IT.

this summer relatively normal general, not. 

However difference year 2 4 times year thrown around. I.e. antibodies last 90 days everyone needs booster shot every 90 days. Etc. fly me. Clearly means vaccine potential turn lightning rod. Sir, Madam; not, not, mean demean experience feelings. Yes, lot people unhappy borders surround them. government country, changed. wish India, China, Pakistan, Canada, nations, would become better places everyone. Alas, (humans) may capable that. 

I hope feel welcome Canada home now. Something better nothing imo jab. point year yeah burn baby burn. dad always said, life’s b!tch die.  Vaccines vaccines

He tried states, laughed. Eu? apologized (ironic) said eu first. I'm surprised still people willing teach shitty they've treated.  I'm impressed vaccination efforts UK, also course Israel UAE.

Are guys expecting get form normality soon? sure fuck calling morons

Can mods sticky this? sub full hopium it’s alarming. going back “normal”. beginning many pandemics. Canadian-Pakistani here, think Indians hate India, hate Modi politics. lie 279k corpses Ok. done everything Xi Jinping done wrong, got tweets people see.

Yes tweets, Chinese users use Weibo bash gov **there** time. (in Li Wenliang's case example). Also China much much better response US, much criticize healthcare system centralised China's, data collection COVID independent reliable. 

This false. China much decentralised may hink part due outlets like BBC banned China (and Hong Kong).

The bulk want care. “Just everybody”? live rural Wyoming? that’s experience vast majority people Really sucks women. hope get support need coming weeks, months, (hopefully not) years, especially given higher burden caretaking generally falls top work responsibilities. point keeps respawning. happened numerous times. Nobody acting like US, they're pointing even spite best efforts, keeps coming back. Canada even bigger population people European descent. That’s doing. wasn’t ‘secrecy’, it’s straight lies. find hilarious cool vid news like super positive lately

What Covid news reading? quarantine place you’re staying managed quarantine hotel 10 days arrive believe quarantine bfs place. Ok. headline says “mounting evidence” evidence. Saying evidence, evidence, good. Lol stupidest shit I’ve ever read. actually believe shit need reality check intelligent think are. completely false equivalency suggest AU NZ boat everyone else soon get case introduced. handled locking one region relatively short time happen less less often time goes by, guys want act like wasting time they've become US anyway whenever there's sub-10 person outbreak. Except Goetlieb perpetual doom gloom, especially compared Olsterholm. think big shift happen mid March people realize time ditch masks restrictions, think another month actually really feel see change.

In mind, mid April going start country wide party slow January 1, 2022.  Please see someone. (and always been) hands people. least vulnerable people vaccinated, 0 reason keep draconian measures place. no, 0 Covid impossible achieve people speak someone says something stupid reason keep measures place. Czech republic first close borders Germany? Proof indeed... see there. They'll vaccinate population require travellers vaccinated. Thanks link; that's interesting read.

Frankly, really disappointing scale testing cellular immunity. learned pretty early important antibodies, antibody testing much cheaper we've stuck almost research. Cellular tests exist, using enough start bringing cost encourage breakthrough make really scalable.

I seen anything authoritative, I've heard compared antibody test around $1 per person, cellular test would $1000. Texas frozen Thursday. Hopefully leads big dip. Worst winter storm decades. 12 billion coronavirus vaccine shots made 2021, rich countries bought 9 billion, many options buy more. inequity threat since result poorer countries wait longer vaccine, time disease continue spread kill people, said Ian MacKay, studies viruses University Queensland.

This argument seems like sort moral dog-whistle me. lay two scenarios:

1) vaccine shared equally among countries
2) vaccines go able bankroll vaccine trials manufacturing

In scenario 1, countries wouldn’t reach herd immunity years virus would mutate among population globally. scenario 2, virus would mutate poorer countries. virus mutate coming years regardless.

The argument might buy able vaccinate 65+ globally groups. would lessen death tolls overall equitable. entirely ignoring best vaccines highly dependent advanced refrigeration infrastructure found outside rich nations. question solely equity, feasibility.

Lastly, getting countries best able produce vaccines world back feet likely merit. I’m familiar enough area confident making judgement. Good know. Time optimism 2020 disaster. You’re making sense. explain Trump Daszak’s bias? constant threat lockdowns lockdowns whenever single case detected 


I’m sure would fly US Badass! 😎👍 vaccine received supposed 90% effective prevention, troubling.

How make sense? Like said 90% effective 100% troubling exactly? hope too. vaccine ready cause I'm giving vaccines people. matter time prioritising risk. 

Hold tight! Cant believe bad US public health messaging been... went masks harmful wearing 2 masks best... Johnson rNA technology. They're two separate pools people, two different gates separating them. need one statistic describe both. uptake point issue particular Orthodox communities although already virus may level immunity. course pretty far perfect probably enough control time being. largely going depend uptake we'll see. second possibility people get vaccine previously infected gives mild illness keeps hospital get reinfected. Either would allow general reopening even virus gone totally.  appointment vaccine week. Yup, took absurdly long fight Minnesota legalized Sunday liquor sales, entirely liquor store owners lobbied it. read comment, lost credibility implied BBC propaganda Chinese state media isn't.

Should also point Chinese TV channel banned UK state controlled (the BBC actually controlled government, gets funding directly TV License payers)? China banned BBC damning reports Uyghur situation. Devi Sridhar Scotland, too.  1.3% Americans die covid. talking Yeah read paper shocked much stretch go analysis ""it reduces transmission"".  always hoped people fake knows Sounds like making broad statements benefit narrative. Clearly you’re health care worker, lost family friends even work bar industry notice crappy people dining right now. Maybe he’s downvoted becuase said English government dealing well, quite frankly that’s biggest load bullshit ever. Israel probably done month. Remember need 2 shots currently 72%. ~160% done vaccinating adult population. Israel fair share antivaxxers too, nearly done. sub brigaded others subs sites since day one. subs sites wish collapse society build socialist utopia. 

The virus needs damage happen. 

That’s there’s over-representation people here. We’re targeted. first time half year. pretty simple, lock one area outbreak short time, know it, normal another half year even longer. Hardly even major event point. Man it’s almost like vaccinating lot people significantly helps Yeah article crematory ovens working day exactly referring cited possible 36k dead

And numbers given realistic ones supported sources, otherwise also say Australia 600 thousands deaths on... 

The thing United States among transparent countries true (unfortunately 50 countries 200 been), still failed count many deaths especially spring (for example New York) summer, also governors ""care much"" right numbers. end also United States tens thousands uncounted deaths, NYT keeps track since beginning. point view, least 20 countries counted equally transparent precise way US

And article says Russia could country deaths journalist chosen ridiculous title capable writing reading, clearly know (as admitted unfortunate health minister) 80% excess deaths directly due covid, currently around 300 thousand deaths 3 times official number, still lower US Respect India

Said Indian

&amp;#x200B;

Oh man even start... can't lie corpses, lot freedom manipulating cause death. assume type person likes staying home day, probably going run much. Even best vaccine now, someone totally immune certain. take precautions still due amount unvaccinated vulnerable people.

If people would’ve acted like total brain-dead morons start pandemic, would fine. are, cycle “oh it’s bad tee hee I’m anti authoritarian don’t wear mask like normal person tee hee” repeats. it’s Bo Jiden got elected woooo!!! Thanks Bo Wait till everyone wants gets vaccinated we’ll talk Multi-billion dollar conglomerate Google, used tens millions daily gutted find reliable. Hahahahaha. love first sentence Honestly every single Covid service improvement, curbside pickup stores, contactless “just leave shit door don’t make sign receipt”, even “buy random necessities Walgreens drive thru”...all need stay different poster... mention directly?   That's actually excited this. taken advantage far live alone really dont need fancy drink drink alone home. think really nice fancy date nights, picnics, etc. pandemic hang people again.  get bit idea 'Split Vaccines Administered' graph traveling tabby page Scotland. Even though Scotlands figures rest UK probably terms split.  think next weeks Oxford/AZ vaccine take majority delivered UK mistreated? They’ve treated way everyone else important role society - they’ve asked go work. like grocery store workers. like doctors. like nurses. 

They’re ones think right go work expecting everyone else to. think they’d accept couldn’t get treated covid doctors decided didn’t want work. think they’d go hunting grocery store workers decided didn’t want work? 

They necessary part society, society cannot stop functioning virus. unfair ask people work keep society intact. Maybe, maybe, beginning day end. Maybe finally ran stupid people likely weather believe mostly propaganda agents. really surprising. Reddit created brand new default sub world events. Ofc going get flooded propaganda.

It always funny see. R/coronavirus one ProCCP subs right now. seems logical it’s want hear. logical - fact, less - two scientific studies confirming higher death rate. 

But someone pulling random guess ass go data “logical” you. needed right now. States fine supply issues. India China making hundreds millions doses vaccines that’s shipped countries you’re mentioning now. Pfizer exporting EU plants countries too. statement correct, luckily. you’ll sure long-term issues reality.

... understand mechanism manifests, ***POSSIBILITY***.

&amp;#x200B;

and.. ""one year"" long enough?

***NOBODY*** much longer that.... know, typical shit Newsweek. government owns means production.. two states, liquor stores owned government True, guess I’m confused people didn’t take original comment seriously decided mine serious. Guess it’s hive mind work. hand know native Canadian moved Australia got married. visiting family happened stuck Canada whole thing. first started learning COVID, eight years ago 2020, saw comment Twitter Chinese University student who'd warned going Wuhan September due 'mystery virus' family got it, body aches/tiredness feel ok. Tested positive 5 days ago. taste/smell completely gone 5 days now. 

How long others wait taste returned? bummer.

How long symptoms subside still test positive? Thinking taking another pcr next week. 

Thanks Wonder much official guidance calling PCR Cycle threshold rates lowered... Yes, pro-China, thanks noticing. Twitter banned terrorists used twitter want give info Chinese gov them.

I'll leave regarding supposed ""lack leave mark long time various ways. Look 9/11, changes air travel still going strong nearly 20 years later. security ideas come pandemic stay around, main guess proof vaccination becoming standard thing international travel. No. forgot add world ""crony"".  also can't rule Pizza Hut origin either, mean likely.  Unsurprisingly sub always target propaganda. correct, end Jan 6.6 million Pfizer 3 million AZ, although shifting towards AZ quite rapidly. Nope eligible yet think May/June. Yeah... EW. often tell people point view plain BAD. deserve hear it! interesting article, wonder explains reinfections? best friend’s mom covid August February, also diabetic overweight, I’m assuming immune compromised comorbidities play role reducing natural immunity antibody titer levels 🤔 Impressive lack data COVID-19 pandemic- No, least West

COVID-19 nuisance- Maybe least  Doom good, go American's show world best super-spreaders! have, let’s make something bigger is. It’s Auckland, believe week two. true SA would get Pfizer. would wisest thing do, nope, rich countries satisfy needy people first even makes pandemic severe longer. Naaa, article actually says schools wont FULLY OPEN fall, meaning masks, distancing, etc. actually near end article, yeah, could miss that. headline BS usual. US money think went vaccine campaign Israel used vaccine developed Germany? happened me. fever, body aches went away day. Day after, taste went away. Came back week though. mutates enough Canada due lack vaccines vaccinated Americans moot point it? Good thing virus cross border America, mutate.

Vaccinating world counts race mutation nullifies vaccination effectiveness. ""Variant"" new buzz word. spelled HERPES wrong. Marco Rubio September? Maybe. think relies two currently approved. They’ll start vaccinating high-risk groups next week, NZ’s case working border quarantine hotels. they’ll even better time since there’s virtually way virus come in. Slovakia (EU) - today officially worst country world deaths covid. also country world constantly testing whole population AG tests (required work, nature visits, etc.) 

Nobody knows what's wrong probably UK mutation widely spreaded (around 80%). 

Some observations:
- lot people care masks anymore
- closed borders start check months late be.
- tried opened schools youngest children opened
- City mayors want participate anymore population AG testing enough medical employees that.

Our whole covid situation handled something called COVID AUTOMAT created virologist experts. basically huge table lot variables tells us must closed restriction based covid numbers. way allow us open something near future.

Hm, people frustrated light end tunnel right now. Vaccination super slow country. Covid around rest lives, however means it’s another strain flu. may masked rest year, nothing great extent now. must mercury graph proves point. Thanks. ? EU like 3rd 4th world anyway doses per capita, nothing complain about. whole world needs vaccinated anyway end. parents risks vaccinated wait longer tbh.

I’m early 20s there’s point wait see everybody till get vaccine doubt data. They’ve recently started vaccinating people 65. think current projections getting everyone vaccinated realistic? headline nothing actual article, turn nothing CDC guidance. word ""fall"" appears article, talks long takes viral particles fall ground. article rambles 6 feet distancing versus different arbitrary number, pretty much nothing CDC actually advising.

reason.com gonna get downvote one. CDC's tracker doses distributed reported administrations. link comment take Google spreadsheet updated CDC's numbers every day: highly unlikely government coverup. health system world routinely tests every sick person chance they'll discover unknown pathogen, would absolutely infeasible.

The story took one doctor Wuhan notice trend around December get suspicious enough send samples testing likely 100% true. 

Most doctors anywhere bat eyelash increase viral respiratory infections start winter. really understand someone see mounting evidence everywhere earlier suspected think reason China alone top things nobody else was. .....do know leases work America right? states really offer much tenant protection America. live liberal Washington state btw lol. article:

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  second dose, I’ll fully support elderly socializing dinner drinks.  much catchy name. UK won’t done April. We’re target everyone vaccinated September. 

We’ve given 15m jabs far, that’s first ones. 15m need second one soon. almost 100% certain. NC dropped 3992 1989. definitely feel lot less anxious knowing hospitals room lot vulnerable protection now. thrown way NY Times headline variants morning. I’m pretty tired cycle - read headline, freak out, read article, find it’s ambiguous, read actual data, wonder spent energy it.

What folks think behind media fear mongering? well intentioned efforts get people play safe? really getting clicks? Would interesting checked severe cases, variant had. mean I’m American make sense US would want vaccinate substantial number people giving vaccine countries. potential shortage vaccines America too. makes sense 100%. US expected give vaccines others vaccinate especially they’ve worst case pandemic world arguably. Also think countries inclined get vaccines country like India due ginormous vaccine producing capability cheap price think school poor ventilation supply medical masks students staff, that’s think solution is.

KN95’s easier wear lot cloth masks, someone wear cloth mask school, easily wear KN95. understand KN95 mask good enough compensate less ideal ventilation. I’ll wear mask grocery store make others comfortable. haven’t stepped friends families houses year, that’s literally want do. Also one downvoted this? Plus would you, I’m reason covid spread like wildfire America. That’s guys.  That’s good theory. Looking online 7.7% US vaccinated right now, don’t think that’s enough drop infection rate large margin.  They're right.

The world slept first year. going us years.

Astra Zeneca already pulled South Africa due low efficacy new strain, Brazil U.K. strains similar mutations.

This going us long long time. heck claim phd would say things? even providing anecdotal evidence. would anecdotal evidence even look like here? “Oh, saw mink coughing two summers ago”. Same. don’t live urban area. Unfortunately gonna closed long while. rest us urban areas country gotten back school. It’s fucking shame leaders don’t look data schools country. 100% need vaccinated. available data previous infection gives minimal resistance escape strains, vaccination (except AZ) gives pretty substantial sterilizing immunity.

The already-vaccinated surely get number shots everyone else since actually know are, presumably indeed actually need one. something like hard lockdonwn 5 weeks, vaccination firmly set appointments, people would target look forward to.

Can't that, EU signed best effort contracts. Omg power science people's confidence it. say wow know. Trump position PR well warpspeed kicked ass. Good stat. Hopefully supply slowly continues increase it’s rear loaded.  suspect coming people supported someone else like parents. still see it.

Then comments saying ""f stock market"", meanwhile working Americans 401k""s. burn hurt randian realises holds power outside echo chamber 😁 Silicone Valley help this? Like everywhere else, they'll scale logistics jabbing. Mask mandates mostly enforced private businesses peers, official govt presence. Even mask mandates dont ""officially"" go away, masks go away general public doesnt want anymore. dont see forever, barring extreme cases. could see staying medical care public transit awhile, places see sticking around longer spring/summer. 

If business attract customers dropping mask rule, they'll drop it. supreme focus public covid masking go away eventually. forget Israel U.S. money.  Actually, do. like everyone else. sucking trying deal like adult, victim making suicidal statements. daily thread overrun self-righteous, selfish, entitled victims think they’re center universe. website tracks deliveries? LoL.

500,000 dead.

""Great job!"" odds positive case already 94% lower vaccinated, apples apples there. PLEASE think vaccinated start ignoring restrictions. think governments comfortable majority global population vaccinated they're lifted. Also, many downvotes lol. really Russian people largely complicit Putin brought back failed state tbh also noted wasn’t possible determine magnitude infections state national level based samples mean never fully happen. Society changed. like never go back world like cell phones social media. BioNtech developed vaccine, Pfizer manufacturing it, distributing it, ran scientific studies proved efficacy. think it’s fair give credit both. seeing less masks nose days

What wrong people use masks? 

Both parents died, within 5 days other. fact anti- maskers contributed this. still evidence. Anecdotal circumstantial evidence still data even though generally regarded weaker directly observed and/or clinical data. paid U.S. money barely get test, much less vaccine appointment. take Sanofi vaccine made EU buy, leave Pfizer rest Europe. work? separately ventilate, cool heat room. manage able that, stop airflow? make sure room vacuum sealed?

Yes. total number vaccinated, number ended severe covid 92% less unvaccinated, like 99.5% less, since 92% reduction top 94% reduction.

Yeah, US banned exports. factories Europe supply countries world, leaving fewer doses us. Thanks lot. God crazy knife crime shift blame covid onto US might one successful propaganda campaigns.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  It’s ALMOST like news outlets run (after paying) stories associated press. ngl wish caught early got with. I'm sick living like this. good. one thing find follow guidelines cdc 3 months one. Anyone followup that? suspect we'll bombarded news new variants weekly frequent basis point run countries assign -or- public moves next bit doom gloom. we'll hear stories vaccines *may* less effective strains antibodies *may* less effective. course, none result peer reviewed academic literature. bit greyscale problem - vaccines already protect bit less new strains, virus mutate much vaccines work anymore would basically need new virus. really depends draw line. 

The good news nothing far bust aside maybe combination SA variant AstraZeneca vaccine. places back normal, part, summer. Limits mass gatherings mask wearing probably gone end year. happened husband. exposed work day getting vaccine developed Covid symptoms. sick week, evening fatigue couple weeks. internist told go ahead get 2nd vaccine schedule confirmed vaccine clinic. could check doctor though vaccine clinic timing 2nd shot based symptoms. 

The infectious disease doc said wait husband symptom free 2 weeks getting 2nd shot. That's ended happening fine, sore arm couple days. Good luck hope feel better quickly. kind logic easily demonstrably falls flat face comes things like infrastructure, known economics Natural Monopoly. many physical places put road leading house. pretty much worst country handling this

Any facts back editorializing redditor nothing opinion? majority Indians antibodies already infected report 0.8% population tested easy allow imagination run away truth biasthe news sources parrot prejudice? China’s harsh response constituted several things want government power do. I’m sure congratulating it. june Boooourns also dealing population fear government brutality. That's another reason. Many people hometown internet. services underfunded lacking. 

I briefly work home parent's house due covid, battling zero cell signal 3mbps Internet. struggle working call centre. Thanks clarifying, hope ok now! people UK tend preference vaccine get? supply evidence contrary people like follow up? doctor order quest LabCorp, order code … He’ll also consults iMessage/SMS/email :)

My complaint stopped taking insurance — though honestly, convenience worth me. (Of course, lab tests prescriptions still covered)

Unless really love doctor, might want shop around find one offers flexibility. country there's lot less testing, less chance faulty pcr test inflate amount cases? country way younger population (if all) west? country that's probably underreporting cases well?

Disregarding best still handful countries 195 'succesfully' contained virus. Context matters though, can't keep country locked forever. virus always finds way. Unemployment still pre covid level Germany wanted france tried push sanofi eastern bloc Stingy. Merkel co. dare act "",unified european approach paramount"". UK israel vaccinate german vaccine germany. Good job.

The US secured doses due their, rightful, claim. Pfizer offered important testing, distribution production capabilties and, hence, deserved them. know they're mRNA vaccines, basically thing? reason they'd percent different effectiveness?   think we'll get point healthy people living at-risk qualify get vaccinated? 5X larger outbreak actually lower estimate thrown around time last year. people would said least 10X. based Hospitalizations Deaths, Heard Immunity instead ? don’t know northern Italy city Prato (very close Florence) (in)famous amount Chinese workers making “made Italy” fashion products. see info ways transmission Chinese workers Italy dunno. doubt there’s way prove it. tell entire Po Valley (where first red zones Italy appeared) populated, interconnected important number commuters move different population centers region. No, that’s accurate. variant virus different genetic code. strain variant behaves differently way. new strains behave differently. vaccine efficacy varies product product strain strain.

The important thing discussion *any* mutation risks causing change affects vaccine efficacy, want keep transmission new mutations minimum everyone vaccinated avoid resetting effort.  mind me, chilling counting days allow healthy people 40 get vaccinated. proof vaccination policy could see working wouldn’t disenfranchise people person needing vaccine passport enter nonessential businesses without mask. 16-19 age group enough fully vaccinated people comparison. Even 20-29 group 10% fully vaccinated (one week past second dose).

Google translate works pretty well Hebrew.

And doubts comes Israel, three Harvard professors part study. Far know Pfizer Moderna still work variants. Feel like Oxford one seems issues everything. Generally, certainties outweigh concerns. like flu, people need stay date. Outbreaks pop unvaccinated groups like polio measles. Diseases viruses get deadly time, exact opposite. Things used kill us droves like flu even come close past. We’re already seeing many new variants, researchers keeping eye it. Thus far running lab tests shows vaccines work new variants Hell yeah! Hunker down, NZ. last leg race. Haha know feels uncle died pneumonia 2015 I’m wondering might covid iirc also got good deal return sharing data good real word demonstration. impossible. ProPublica owns large small media outlets. It’s political now. research!!! exact stories look up!!!  We'll see people saying ""a months"" months. predict will. mRNA vaccine, developed much faster traditional vaccines. Fauci talking long traditional vaccine would take produce. couple companies felt confident enough try produce mRNA vaccine, concept that's around long time, never really produced scale. That's development vaccine accelerated quickly. appreciate take, thank vaccines mutations, second shot? 🥅➡️➡️➡️🥅 I'd rather discussion early late tbh saw testing kids young 12. Hopefully goes well get ball rolling well.  Inject already gosh darn Palestinians occupied Israel. add this, people contracted SA variant getting AZ injection covid severely I've heard LOL, 500,000 though. Modi wants Trudeau please much better next time. draconian there's small harms costs add keeping mandate case make sense (even though want one cases high help control spread).

Mask litter problem (idiot people, also animals, wind, etc releasing trash cans). Deaf people struggle them. Things like that. really opportunities virus hopped first patients began spreading outside initial zone?

I far topic seems sort quarantine-breaking human error inevitable.

Would glad proven wrong. heard estimate 6 years world, probably different vaccines then. I’m seeing news outlets already pushing proof vaccination.

In opinion, it’s way early conversation, since shot isn’t even available general public yet. Australia close border state there's covid flare state. divided country semi-independent chunks reason. states play ball keep border closed them, like Australia does. Death taxes Thank god don't. We've destroyed millions lives protect baby boomers vaccines way young cannot sacrificed. thought boomers flying benidorm racist waiters rest us stay home working pay pension rises makes think covid opportunity mean, cool, fetishization ""to-go cocktails"" still one weirdest parts whole response. Thank service! Healthcare workers country’s true angels. can't disagree. sooner US gets pandemic control, sooner (Canada) reopen borders.

We still getting vaccine doses, although lead, middle pack.

Overall, important thing get much vaccine possible soon possible, distributed efficiently possible. Stopping exports bit bother, correct, US getting vaccination rates high enough, plenty doses getting exported. little easy. many died? many got sick? many got terrible side effects? 16 up. likely happen?  actually growing calls teachers bumped next list, 65's uk, Puts basically impossible territory. lab leak result large amount variants. Whereas vector human transmission would, especially happened repeatedly. Yes k95 seems doable. same. Damn *vaccines* maybe fact vaccines passing around holiday season ended

Not saying Trump plan Biden thing Trump, haven’t seen single actual difference today month ago term government response COVID-19 daily lives Funny Japan/SK access better ‘science’ West, wearing masks start. say that? Also, good reason would actually stick rather “just two weeks” situation? hard take anybody serious uses term new normal. want new normal, want old normal. Pfizer Moderna vaccines effective variant probably not. parents get 2nd shot week. really want go visit, seen year. CDC says takes 2 weeks vaccine become fully effective. 

How long guys waiting friends family get shots? get you’re saying masks it’s also important consider fact really haven’t shown help much all. across US, it’s clear states mask mandates vs without different outcomes, showing there’s basically correlation . It’s also important consider one annoying thing masks they’re genuinely harmful children still growing developing, kids need see faces. J&amp;J probably dominant global vaccines.

Congrats making least informed comment thread. Americans, people worldwide. amazed willing people push pause button lives year.

When else governments people throughout world agreed anything? probably never happened. time someone says new normal, instantly suspicious. Anyone thinks virus can't eliminated thinking small.

 ^Also, totally real, guys Well, even national news country Eastern Europe reported almost everyone quite afraid time even me. 

I still idea panic people like that. Fauci said June/July. That's say governors suggested, said. Yeah think big difference saying ""big company"", big name companies big size companies, often overlap always. think people hear names like pintrest (i think went remote too) twitter people axiomatically think 100ds thousands employees, truth.

How feel permanent remote work? course is.

If political factors could ignored fixed, would much better situation now.

Maybe Trump could still elected President.

But know what's going government knows know going there, know government knows know what's going here, nothing changed. Part probably vaccinations larger part big ass blizzards keeping people breakdowns efficacy narrower age groups? Like 20-30, 30-40? helpful discount anything American Conservatives say unless verified trusted source.

Sad, they're basically nihilist post-modernists point. strongly biased, group (vaccinated vs unvaccinated) looked 170k people 60 430k aged 16-59. Mortgages still cheaper renting though :) due respect, still getting glared wearing mask outdoors talked wearing one people private residence.

I favor masks public indoor spaces expected. becoming object used virtue signal. got call govermenmt grant - dont bear full burden. prices see Moderna Biontech - quite large space profitable in. product temperature wise rolled developing countries good place. Remember take least 1½ year world vacinated - drive doesnt end summer Think peasants letter generation name. got named millennium falcon. Lol 😂  real question? Lol think probably multiple trends. There's holidays, also level spread, variants, reportedly contagious.

The spread slow point. can't double every couple weeks forever. simple explanation virus simply ran people infect became immune.  depends ages you’re talking covid December, low key best/worst Christmas gift I’ve gotten. It’s nice live life somewhat normally mask, thing sucks small group fear mongering people saying matter get covid again. I’m sure I’d really like locking moments notice one case. initially admire NZ Oz’s response pandemic think might last able come pandemic doubt 100% populations vaccinated threat covid going remain world.

Combine fact israeli medical records digital last 20 years, relatively small population, agreement share medical data pfizer understand apprleaing pfizer start tested first time? mean, would they? Provinces somehow procure vaccines benefit everyone, end. let’s pretend MB’s recent announcement anything symbolic. time sees vaccines (if ever, since they’re still trials) entire country already vaccinated. domestic production. government care people think, sadly much walking ourselves. hour neighbors walk around neighborhood. one minute they're themselves, next they're passing one another, zero social distancing.  modern hebrew poor - english translation? enough fully vaccinated younger people make adjustment? Depends “building safety daily life means” could anything...he’s actually saying anything substance advocating “zero covid” U.S. got hammered virus terms gross deaths blame wanting save tens perhaps hundreds thousands citizens first exporting? said, would made exception Canada. 

Let Chinese export vaccines, barely deaths actual economic growth 2020. read thankfully that. U.S. gets enough jabs export hundreds millions doses world wide. got this! I'm praising think they've done shit job managing pandemic overall, I'm child like contribute worsening political discourse tribalism I'm also capable acknowledging they've actually handled something fairly well. I'm betting eхtreme weather across country either preventing delaying people getting tested. definitely correct!! 

Some would support it, would absolutely hate it, would maybe want little autonomy maybe concessions.

Ultimately though everyone trying live lives correct :) 🤔 remembered one time April 2020 Friend Germany said US robbed PPE Germany bought.

That truely broke cooperation think impression holding stick might different others get pop ups phone. bad strategy though! sound self absorbed - me, freedom me. wonder people family die covid would agree you? lack empathy fellow countryman pretty disgraceful. 

I'd actually stopped thinking covid last months - check latest MIQ positive numbers, got life. Enjoyed going good time. Lifes good here. We've total freedom travel, overseas included. small personnel sacrifice benefit everyone else seem draconian like make be. Lastly, comment young people fucked benefit elderly plain ignorant. mindset common wonder US shape currently is. poll meaningless. It’s easy say poorer nations benefit, much harder actually something (like hold government account make sure happens). Britain can’t even properly feed students rely school meals lockdown, forced something footballer home-cook brings attention it.....otherwise rest country would shrug shoulders move on. went alone?

Some recently gone got separate supplies apparent EU fast enough everyone EU part September last year EU finally signed contracts vaccine companies.

In fact UK opted absolutely blasted decision saying would lead vaccine disaster. UK could still joined EU scheme despite Brexit. Im sure, check website, seem Microsoft, Intel, Amd, Nividia involved others. Except Sony, would amazing publicity folding home came PlayStations help fight covid.  Yeah, agree. friends family community. personally give sh\*t anything involve Canada lol :) way believe less years time Science changed much mask wearing.

Depends much studying done. lot studying done.

Turns throw massive amount resources something, get faster results. Like Manhattan Project going moon. even resources across even countries. Charisma already know this

This happens hostile foreign government control man lent billions bet first time applying EMA. learn change? 6 years ago, 2 days ago? company also going full remote permanently. But, we're also huge. Always disappointed fellow progressives beat drum making decisions based science complexity ignore science convenient.

Also, kids person since august gone great. haven’t quarantine once. Things going great school. hype train gone... then? Somehow also gotten completely lost. normal year i.e. pre-covid, 300-350k people die nursing homes every day, almost 1000 per day. causes things like infections, sepsis, renal failure, etc.

About 40% Covid fatalities 200k occurred nursing homes. sounds like lot context matters.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Mine stayed up, got downvoted... Damn blindly follow anyone power says? People question leadership. know difference. Long haul real syndrome discussed months. listen Dr. Daniel Griffin week virology podcast. picked long haul syndrome patients long time ago urged physicians take seriously.

It’s unusual viral illness cause lasting symptoms. 

You dismissing concerns doesn’t help anyone. Restaurants never allowed reopen early without consistent enforcement confidence restaurants follow rules voluntarily. given restaurants sorry spreaders early on, I'm prepared give benefit doubt stakes even higher risk high ever been. Almost one getting flu normal flu deaths (part regular expected deaths) instead covid deaths year.

I plain suck.

I get COVID, get flu year!

(Obviously something unlikely still possible, since happened.)  We're getting hundreds thousands vaccines year.... looking prevalence B117 UK, first detected cases September 2020. surge B117 happened mid December. 

Thus far, growth prevalence -- roughly doubling week regions -- following UK trajectory. took longer two months surge manifest (about three months so). Florida continues along path (which far), cases eventually level increase. study accounts age, compared similar groups terms age, ethnicity comorbidities. Can't wait headline. ""The Covid vaccine increases chance getting hit lightning."" one shot strategy? UK giving shots 12 week gap (shown effective method AZ). France country going use single dose people. Also evidence shown AZ effective UK variant. might worse SA one study done far wasn’t useful regards information severe cases hospitalisations. Cases collapsing even mass vaccinations. It’s time discussions going back normal. Sorry scares 52,884,356 today

50,641,884 yesterday

2,242,472 dose increase. know go alone? can’t difficult.. quoted CDC updated guidelines week. recommend go hybrid/all virtual spread control KC.

Show study that's asymptomatic testing regular contact tracing... reading studies, right? 

This interesting snippet third link: ""While data encouraging overall, large outbreaks occurred apparent transmission schools. Israel, within 2 weeks schools reopening mid-May 2020, large high school outbreak occurred 2 students epidemiologically unrelated infections attended classes mildly symptomatic.8 Testing 99% at-risk students (n = 1164 eligible; 1161 tested) staff (152 eligible; 151 tested) identified 153 25 cases SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively (attack rates 13.2% 16.6%). Contributing factors outbreak included crowded classrooms insufficient physical distancing (eg, student density classrooms exceeded recommended values), exemption face mask use, continuous air conditioning recycled interior air closed rooms heat wave.""

That quote ^ recommendations like *don't return high community spread* *don't return many children crammed one place can't socially distance properly*. need read rationale guidelines.

From original point: schools can't meet CDC criteria re-open fully. Well, careful wish comes getting rid state owned liquor stores. 2012, Washington state voters approved ballot initiative end state liquor store system allow private companies sell instead. got overlooked Washington would end highest liquor taxes nation. (Or next highest, perhaps)

that said, state business selling booze. People act world's first virus world's first vaccine. known long time vaccines work, get immunity either vaccine getting virus, immunity lasting. Everyone stuck worst case scenario mode none things true.

Let's say true. vaccines work, control spread, immunity lasts years, including variants. end pandemic immunity vaccinations half people immune years. Source? Well vaccine desirable high efficacy.

South Africa already chosen use J&amp;J Pfizer AZ. 

But see plays next coming months. Remember people create hash tags get clicks followers... controversial idea, clicks get.

I sure someone going lock inside house scientists unanimously declare world free covid, might never happen. generally think big thing. could while. Hopefully kids approved vaccines. wearing masks anytime November next year?


What end goal? define ""local"" then... ""local"" someone who's contributing local government, i.e., paying property taxes I’ve given larger amount current data. 

The data supports fact certain precautions place safe go back school.

Kids classroom. Full stop. literally Trump-tier ""WHO = China"" bullshit think that's indicated data. all. definitely high level political pressure join EU vaccination scheme even technically possible EU nations go alone. Oh. Shit. gotcha. misunderstood part blamed solely underlying conditions. seemed obvious covid train say obesity stupidity running onto railroad articles I've collected, Google around find more.

[Vaccine reduces spread risk even 2nd shot, Israeli study showing Oxford vaccine slows virus spread Moderna vaccine blocks (87-93%) infections &amp; 91% (89-94%)  Hidden?? mean like “conspiracy theorists” screaming day one? mugs pretended government everyone’s backs gonna cool?

But way mandated every person indefinitely worth pointing - strongly biased towards older population numbers young people almost certainly better especially serious disease love username. feel like weirdly enjoy seeing bad news. Like terrible, kinda exciting. makes sound terrible. Maybe I've grown accustomed comfortable anxiety.

Yeah... feel like one gonna relate. lived whole life never bought land? never paid property tax? mean... get reinfected plenty viruses. Therefore, behave like virus does. find post discussing praise there. 

This accomplishment Tory party.  Meanwhile Canada sitting 0.05% vaccination lol. 

Socialized healthcare way, multiple layers bad bureaucracy isn't. coincidence? see nothing political here. :/ vaccinated half population USA barely vaccinated anyone. Wtf government doing? not.

Say 100,000 positive cases.

94%, 94,000, symptoms all.

Of 6,000 people *some* symptoms, 92% (5,520) minor ones. 480 cases (out 100,000) severe symptoms.

That's .48% cases, 99.52% reduction cases severe symptoms. They've done absolute bare minimum, UK completely devastated coronavirus one worst rates entire planet. 

We've literally year imposed tangible border controls airports.

the government done absolute bare minimum, first thing messed intervened with, we're supposed praise them? no. cases among younger people yet vaccinated. elderly vaccinated help illness death much cases yet.

Before young vaccinated think hard say. trend currently friend sure. Maybe 30-50k per day. like North Dakota back like last June, 85-100 per day. US 10-20k per day. uncle, lived Israel, died October 2019. mild car accident. old cracked sternum. went hospital treated, came severe pneumonia died. never figured exactly happened.

I wondering could Covid.  Well said. OP made nuanced argument, could good discussion it. instead get clickbait sadly got upvoted. Really? looks like unnatural comment I’ve ever seen Reddit. even kinkiest bootlickers would celebrating that. Yeah UK done mid April I'm guessing basically. US done July 4th basically real sense although vaccination going after. EU probably looking late summer. China difficult know they've gotten 50 million doses far believe might find [this article] Tablet Magazine interesting. Oh great! back october numbers Open masks distancing rules? schools truly ""open"" that's case. problem? Buy BioNTech. end Japan importing vaccine EU, US. 

Vaccine “Pfizer” name BNT162b2. Get first one possible, still 0 hospitalizations Oxford South Africa trial. like eliminating Polio worldwide. possible next 2 decades, huge undertaking needs coordinated response &amp; course, political will. Western countries, we're going re-open soon cases control. unlimited resources wait years &amp; years rare disease. Leaders convince public life taking risks, take additional safety measures crowds age condition getting covid may lead bad outcomes. I'm sorry loss, that's horrible that's one family catching rural areas enough spike higher cities

 US, Europe, UK, China done far sooner. !remindme 6 months need masks vaccinated? Yeah needs bodily autonomy Reddit run SF. event think recognize Silicon Valley metaphor tech industry. made world better place? course. Also Israel SA variant spreading, sounds promising Both. couple common types influenza (called B) theoretically catch single season. also catch strain multiple times, since natural immunity imperfect wanes time (e.g. catching common cold every year) Free market monopoly really problem, always start new company old stoped serving costumers well.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Let’s fucking go Yes, indeed I'd expect government prioritise people others. 

Judging post history, German. giving vaccines away, would probably impoverished countries short rather global superpowers already need order. Nah, wait try pick Taiwan. hell breaks loose. long. add this, COVID-19 similar SARS, another coronavirus outbreak years ago. Scientists MRNA vaccine that. create new one, look gene sequencing new virus edit bit existing MRNA vaccine. That's, part, mRNA vaccines quick get widespread testing approval starts producing BioNTech vaccine Frankfurt. 115 mln year. Yup. many people head cold get every fall “the flu”.

Flu fucking horrible! I’ve twice could barely function times. second time finals week second semester college. was... fun. Judging though, every country responsible detected early September-November 2019? wonder extra supply coming from. little cagey numbers last saw 8-12 million doses per week Pfizer Moderna, 1.1 1.7 million doses per day. We've past days, though guess days little lower.

Overall good news keep reading reports incremental improvements Pfizer Moderna. Moderna working something add 4 doses vials currently hold 10 would 40% increase though might take months. J&amp;J might come online couple weeks... children take another year school. must save every Grandmother possible Covid! I'm sure children able catch one day. That’s literally said comment ... maybe. I'm Manchester although I'm low priority (in 20s) found E week actually ended offered vaccine. given Pfizer asked nurse exact question. moment anyone vaccinated hospitals given Pfizer anyone community settings given AZ due fact kept ar low temperatures. community based vaccinations go up, numbers shift even favour AZ. Nurse say majority vaccinated Manc Pfizer vaccine


I know exact numbers hopefully helps answer question slightly!

Edit: spelling genuinely sure baby bust means there's lot new babies, new babies. Solidarity Allied nations? Compassion? UK? they've made us 100 million, line contract, we've jabbed everyone. might catastrophizing expect American variants years years god. Whoa, let's hasty here. can't jump conclusions. lightning striking individual may anything person's burns, smoke coming skin, general bugging eyeballs. needs investigation determine exact cause burning smoking. could coincidence lightning strike hit time. Remember, correlation equal cauterization, something like that. words, virus isn’t magic. It’s behavior within realm viruses behave. mind. Less facial tracking. Warm winter. shave work. Yeah wait. last saw even one shot gives 50% immunity. sooner better later matter what. funny masks acceptable piece wear Asia especially winter time. 

Fauci cautious like ahem good scientist would. evidence leaning towards normal summer, he'd rather cautious wait good evidence new variant would mess vaccination process. Suck months people. vaccine polarizing! Show me.  made great strides preventing death serious illness. made great strides treatment therapies sick. However don’t seem great understanding world looks like year more. reasonable signs point CV19 ENDEMIC routine annual semiannual vaccinations. 

I hope future pharmaceuticals discover way develop time release vaccine lingers body encourages continual antibody production. 

Otherwise.... sigh .  Vaccine whole world constantly. Ugh Nope! got downvoted 22x commenting one post one researchers refuting China fully cooperating. simply asked know wasn’t compromised got downvoted lmao interesting podcast waiting people blame Bil Gates that, post find one. getting next 5 groups goes 95% deaths far

98% actually, think. rate take year vaccinate everyone. China bots downvoting, course. admitted jack shit. asked looked data. also never said pose risk age groups, that's claimed. barely read. would even discuss anything you. audacity tell need educate myself? Educate exactly? back say; age groups ""poses significant risk"".

What even mean? virus beaten nearly anyone younger 65. barely cases involving children. Literally almost people beat shit weak ass virus. old complications, might different story. wouldnt call risk ""significant"" all. really low. virus dangerous highly contagious alot carriers asymptomatic. Like 30-40% dont even slightest idea carry it. Mostly young people. That's danger is, virus itself. born yesterday, aware this? I'm saying masks lockdowns arent needed anything, certainly are.

My opinion never irrelevant. got balls, give that. Horseshoe theory. crazies left right sometimes far apart. see actively cheering end society reddit quite frequently. Ohhhh thought trying say sort authoritarian system restrictions place. makes sense. Oh that's really unfriendly regulation!  Maybe, vaccine nationalism real thing freedom movement kind defeats point focusing citizens Memphis City Schools charter schools area closed. Can't speak rest state. Newborns unlikely able vaccinated fall earliest. going sound horrible think expectation really young kids get virus. I'm hearing AstraZeneca running trial age 5 plus. Full trials needed kids case seems. kids getting countries showing safety issues. pretty likely effective still verified Misleading title misinformation. I've calling anti-vaxxer pro-measles since least 90s Unfortunately many people work sick. Or, call sick, go doctor's office prove it, go that. good system. Jew? Yeah it’s long “two weeks flatten curve” don’t feel point complicated. see every day people talk big changes society go back normal. There’s normal go back to. “You can’t go home again.” 

Heck, even right see news headlines “history” record current events going world, I’m gobsmacked. fact people think talk history tells folk like failed you, failed badly. life going change far, far deal climate change ever COVID, message “let go craving now”. People going need get used life changing again. need dramatic. carry years. virus really gotten hold ten months ago. Virus cases down, vaccination rates increasing, restrictions already easing. summer looking promising. Gianforte choke slam Covid-19 submission. Uhuh US CDC page compares deaths hospitalizations. scale 18-29 year age range say (65 cut two age ranges, i'm going average them) 65 year olds 4.5x chance serious covid 60x chance death compared 18-29 year old, appears need move decimal point. know obvious.

That said, vaccines effective mRNA vaccines reduce spread. Half us masking socially distancing

Which already happening pre-holiday.

The user Pixxet said ""doing something"". I'm entirely sure changed. There's way mask mandate federal property *that* much effect. Okay sure cases bad across board. little difference states high mask compliance states low mass compliance. I’m saying expect happen based things currently handled. also depends entirely area. lost US states probably don’t wear mask right now. you’re LA County you’re going wearing one awhile. 

A lot people get angry idea restrictions won’t go away reddit randos decide they’re needed anymore. effect policy, especially cautious places. could well wrong, I’m guessing mask mandates aren’t going disappear lot areas least Q4 year. I’m saying might well prepared that. lot major countries obviously also higher excess deaths

Not much lol. Google it. true. 30 Million Pfizer/Biontech, 40 Million Moderna. I'll allow it. efficient enough airborne. Easy answer. mean, nobody really cares flu...eventually this. Chances many many people infected really pulls mortality rate dramatically. Last checked 85+ barely 1% mortality USA per CDC. said, I’m still wearing mask whenever necessary fear mongering stop think. *really* like wording ""being careful high prevalence seasons"". **To me**, looks like trying normalize lockdowns mask mandates flu season. Mrmrsmonk banned already No. anything tests harder come earlier undercounting. trump lost - stay mad They're going business

[Except good 9, 12, 15 months really matter face increasingly bad landscape mom pop liquor law expires July 1, sponsor, state Sen. Jeff Bridges, said plans introduce legislation keep new system. Liquor store owners retailers worry cut business. Australia scheduled immunised adults, wish vaccinated, October year,  Probably something 2.5 million people dead. damned damned situation. already saw happened hand sanitizer toilet paper. People already hoarding N95s without even needing told. Imagine happens beginning zero masks available. people forget hospitalizations, ICU admissions deaths also way measure COVID rates. It’s conservatives  informing context again. Low Power? must construct additional pylons! Minister Jacinda Ardern announced move urgent meeting top lawmakers Cabinet. lockdown first New Zealand six months represents significant setback nation’s largely successful efforts control virus. Indeed, Ardern Sunday planned attend Big Gay Out, Auckland festival celebrates rainbow community attracts tens thousands people. get ban New York Times articles? clear trying clickbait using obvious observations justify extremely low probability pessimistic scenario occurring.

It's silly think anyone pulse know variants/different strains United States way now. mean, COVID essentially “just flu” vast majority people age 60. didn’t kill older people extreme numbers, could probably ignore altogether last year. per capita? Let's talk facts.

And seen data variants? 

Vaccines keep healthy alive immunocompromised fighting chance.

The vaccines keep healthy population healthy. LONG time.

That's world need prepare for. acceptable practice Asia winter months highly urban areas. see big deal them.  I'm you. hard respond all. Get vaccine ASAP it’s going away People still getting EVALI (vaping illness) area testing negative covid. 

Source: theory also weird seeing lot severe EVALI cases young people. young people get severe covid. seen lot older EVALI sufferers underlying illness. Well I'm glad got vaccine first go play bingo. rest us continue suffer isolation take risks, instead actually contributing economy helping struggling restaurants, retailers, like. live Scotland, we've vaccinated 99% 75. elderly relative Oregon, they're vaccinating everyone elderly. sooo frustrating watch. 

They've turned vaccine political show, need vaccinate 'worthy' show good face, vaccinate certain groups they're pressured unions. follow science vaccinate people need vaccination else high chance dying catch virus. hard. expect least one person died. side effect vaccination. rate lower others good thing.  every american vaccinated might expect 4000 die ~~from it~~.  people want US at?

Like close running supply issues vaccine, yes started crappy, probably cant go much higher J&amp;J gets approved. pull head ass listen facts. fact relative western worlds, US distributed vaccine, far moderna pfizer, effective known variants. AZ never happen here, even JnJ fairly effective SA variant. months fine. I'm worried people gonna accept forever think ""minor"" matter never stop this. need face significant amount people masking public probably 2022

Great, people whatever likely mandated.

Not 2022 Spending five dollars hamburger small business doesn’t require masks instead bigger one mask mandate statement think is.

You think businesses mask mandates areas anti-restrictions *won't* people choose go there? problem lied beginning. creates trust issue going forward - telling truth now, lying again?

They honest right start masks would reduce spread, wanted reserve N95 masks medical workers. Tikes trikes. Well, go -- people plan ""definitely"" get said ever gotten flu vaccine. 

And add number get it, number responded ""likely to"" (didn't see number article), number change mind, ongoing vaccine education programs I'm confident we'll get well 60% eligible vaccinated (although, certainly 100%). I'v never worked hard make school work pandemic. exhausting disappointing people think we're zoom two week. knew much preparation takes. Тогда почему же они это не учли в статистике? convinced places think fine half ass electrical wiring. Albuquerque electricians probably thought fine many risks lowered-not enough plants fires, rain, wind, tornadoes, stable dry air maybe snow winter ignore rest comment answer this. consequences concerned about? Surely establishing much fact least risky solution problem.

It sounds like latest news whole boondoggle turned PR opportunity Chinese absolve blame, also cast blame onto others.

My point beginning nothing scientific advancement everything passing political football. Looks like that's happening. Country want hold olympics 4 MONTHS

word around campfire is, Tokyo Games get pushed 2022, canceled outright. large enough percentage people vaccinated summer allow mass travel Japan. 

Not mention, athletes sports besides ""completely solo"" events (like running &amp; weight lifting) missed months &amp; months meaningful practice. Tokyo 2021 moves forward announced, gonna astersk-ridden shit show article

 

Germany Sunday stopped travel [between regions east south country neighboring Czech Republic bid stop COVID-19 variants spreading.

The measures set remain place least 10 days.

Does anyone know incoming flights handled? quarantine?  care level precaution people took? extreme note, shame doomsday peppers prior COVID? Good Great info, thanks! You’re forgetting hospitalizations ICU admissions also trending down. word asymptomatic spread? plenty older people wants everyone keep living shut life. Manaus really tell us much we'd like.

This serological study done area almost one afford get antibody test basically advertised people thought they'd infected tested. Then, top that, adjusted prevalence almost 2x using demographic data, almost certainly also error. Basically, Manaus almost certainly far lower prevalence study claimed, really tell us anything variant. True, Amazon shady hell. See article linked above. Neither country capable holding stick  I’m pretty sure there’s like 5x many modern doses administered US Pfizer whatever say guy allied nations shit us brexit trying best make example us? India missed 99% cases numbers coming India junk.  delusional profoundly wierd people come from? 

Of course wait global population vaccinated. may problem. :( recently. people age 35 allowed weeks now... I'm 29 got mine last week allowed before. Italy gave shit ton China Italy got rocked China tried sell back BioNTech Pfizer manufacturing. defintion, techies moving Tahoe count locals clickbait title? It’s literally fact also huge difference “no claim” “reason believe opposite.”

You stepping far outside bounds evidence

The mutations make Brazil variant dangerous functionally similar SA variant. There’s reason think vaccine would work one LOL says one thinks every Indian poops street... What’s wrong jab? know sure vaccines reduce transmission? seems like it’s taking awfully long time get information, it’s making nervous we’ll continue wearing masks public health officials say it’s okay stop. Whenever be. US even better school year starts. Public schools make mandatory get vaccines MMR. Eventually, COVID added list, I'm sure. Exactly satire. I'm brutally honest. I'll take votes. family job still home?! ok UK using AZ vaccine vulnerable population. also getting EU manufactured BioNtech vaccines. stay EU least nursing home residents vaccinated. ""According Moderna, vaccine produced immune-system agents known neutralizing antibodies emerging virus variants tested, including strains first identified U.K. South Africa. But, Moderna made claim regarding Brazilian variant."" may surprise Americans beginning feel way myself. mental health time low finally decided look myself. would you/they? don’t get choice. vaccines good enough. sTiLl sOciAL dIsTaNcE mAsk EvEn tAkInG vAcCiNe! sure downvoted. PPP program America. own.v Actually heavy lifting Pfizer Biontech vaccine done Biontech German government paid it. Well italy work next Winnie poo talking you? Redditors?  thing. Like whisper DNA: Here’s kill invader. whisper may need repeated fall.

IMO, likely 3-5 years become new influenza combo vax influenza shot, Jab UK chaps.

We’ll get better influenza surveillance well.

Humanity continue, adjusted horrible scourge, taming hinderance most, protecting vulnerable.

Too bad society writ large gain humility horror. could inject that... well, easy. doubting good intentions, somehow comes ""you're depressed? be, happy"" read [Peter know State Department spokesperson Ned Price U.K.'s Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab ***not*** scientists WTO experts scientists. clear politicizing what. Please let raw data argument lead us slippery slope ruin. None vaccine study raw data public inspection either (""only provided summary"" Dominic Dwyer said). People going ask using argument. kind argument going help vaccination hesitancy? it’s shit show fair COVID-19 mutating constantly everywhere. what’s solution then? We’re churning vaccines fast humanly possible. went get moderna day that’s paperwork clinic said it’s pfizer shot pretty much crossed moderna form put Pfizer  That’s happened all.

History still written, China proven contain virus effectively. It’s immediate shut domestic travel clearly effective. Contrast effort limit outgoing international travel. Canada also taking vaccines COVAX, WHO’s program help poorest countries get vaccines. vaccine rollout. 

Israel administered 75 doses per 100 people, UK - 22/100, US - 15/100, Canada - 3/100. I've never talked someone thinks eradicate virus. Ever.

Try talking ""covid-zero"" people sub. still deluded it. Everyone deserved them. Healthcare human right. given fairly. Like media beat-up vaccine killing people Norway turned giving literal palliative care patients lol I’m 22, health care worker got dose two January 31st. brother sister law got week did. definitely lot data realize. Yeah, OK. assumed Victorian wondered thought we're now. people turning daily /r/melbourne thread self-selected biased group. incorrect. making assumption vaccine would 60 70% effective. 90 95% effective vaccine, vaccine distribution rest stuff really matter much. said great. strongly dislike working office personally, we'll save fortune office space I'll consequently earn less overhead (I expect last thing apply everyone going permanent remote though). though? Like news Virus circulating November even earlier US, one even knew. could stopped it? No, reason believe that. You’re vastly overstating connection. huge different “some number reinfections” “natural immunity nearly completely ineffective.”  there’s another huge difference “natural immunity ineffective vaccine immunity ineffective.”

You’re making mountain molehill Yes, millions Americans suffering without healthcare pandemic fucking hilarious. Covax scheme primarily Astra Zeneca given additional funding uk, surely relevant question - 

if gave charity help poor, found aid diverted richest places earth, would feel? pretty, believe me. EU failed getting vax rolled quickly succeeded keeping peace nation states. EU shipping majority vaccine production rest world. Look past year. honestly surprised?

If taken New Zealand's approach day one, could safe targeted reopenings last summer vaccines would worked.

But don't. prepare reality. came from? Aren’t closed? vaccine available since December almost like mutation already widespread already peaked something /s part questioning response must rely future vaccine fight pandemic

Is still relevant today? page needs amended deleted imo top spot Google keywords. emailed ask reply. 22 fully vaccinated (dose two two weeks ago) well can't deluded. 

Never seen anyone blame USA covid. I've seen people go Trump denying existed promoting bullshit treatments discouraging mask use, that's thing blaming US covid. already mild annoyance people.  vote totals sub arbitrary mess put stock them.  Well I’d like go Greece, college graduation may indeed plan meet another open country regardless. thanks unnecessary unasked input lol think states like Florida worse even though one highest death rates. We're unhealthy state lack lot access proper medical care. case counts bad (and likely would worse people got tested more) general rural, low cost living temperate climate easier get away people. less competition vaccine. enough yet course go really fast, long access internet book appointments easier get here. give props south MS rollout. Seems like doses come week spread following two weeks look worse numbers we're actually doing. Like everything involving MS tough here, silver linings make completely insufferable, That's distinction without difference. We've recent escapes managed isolation escape another part border control. border quarantine properly run, even whistleblowers coming forward repeated failures infectious variants.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yep downvoted suggesting might people make choice wear masks future cold/flu seasons. never understand mask debate. Nice! discharged 6 monther recently. sure. Maybe bad thing. think it’s time Europe takes leading role world make new alliances.

For sure increased military spending. reason said possibly ineffective number cases people Brazil natural antibodies (from Covid previously) got infected P.1 strain. reason believe imply vaccines would nearly completely ineffective. 
  Good think US hasnt used AstraZeneca vaccines.

We using Moderna, Pfizer point, J&amp;J approved soon, 3 vaccines give us enough vaccines entire US population summer. Lmao No. serious policy maker pushing zero covid AFAIK.

Mostly saying treat like flu - endemic, manageable *possibly* needing occasional booster shots. EU banned exports like US did, faffing nearly big problem trying save whole world everyone else trying save themselves. Yeah. honestly wasn’t expecting downvoted.  didn’t even think controversial argumentative. wanted add conversation. 

It’s tragic people think going away people ready change lifestyles."
