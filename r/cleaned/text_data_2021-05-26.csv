0,2021-05-26," serious question? Youre asking covid symptoms good bad thing?  It’s really bad people can’t normal OP,  
 
For Figure 1 
mRNA-1273 = Moderna 
NVX-CoV2373 = Novavax 
BNT162b2 = Pfizer 
rAd26-S + rAd5-S = Sputnik V 
ChAdOx1 nCov-19 = AstraZeneca 
Ad26.COV2.S = J&amp;J 
CoronaVac = Sinovac 
Convalescent = Recovery actual infection cousin who’s threatening mum (my Auntie) gets vaccine won’t let see new born daughter ‘shedding’ - know feel Seem like reality-based answer path forward. Already happening pretty quickly.

It still would nice people get vaccinated. 10+ million people immunocompromised US, likely underprotected vaccination. stockpiles?

I guess saving doses second dose, may higher proportion compared vaccines deliveries much less reliable. Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech consistent whereas AstraZeneca still large week-to-week fluctuations often changes schedule.

But demand clearly still outstrips supply. tens millions people EU would gladly take AstraZeneca shot today ability to. bad news media treatment (and laughable U-turn) solidifies belief others extreme otherwordly conspiracies.

Partisan media partisan science ashamed toxic sphere discussion created around topic, thrashing side COVID's story benefit knows who, particularly said novel virus' earliest known genotype already good infecting humans. I'm learning this, total game changer. Rather going week straight nothing 3 weeks, consistently go times week rest need to. kind like knowing *can* take day highlights fact really want enjoy it. love diseases whole family inevitable catches? worst aggressive stomach bugs, know everyone get clean puke soiled beds middle night. try isolate one parent enough everyone count simultaneously. joys parent. ? Thank you. I'd add immunity black white. possible immunity declines people ever get mild illness decades come. 

There good reason think level immunity last long time. SARS1 still showed signs immunity years later. 1918 Spanish flu caused signs immunity people last 80 years. 

One things likely made covid bad one level immunity. doubtful see enough mutation true anytime soon again. Thanks explanation, fixed googled vaccination rates Wyoming phone auto searched Wyoming vacation... thank phone 🤣😂🤣 Libertarian approach would positive negative incentives letting people decide want it. vaccine would probably cost money Right restrict foods obsess calories eat treats, enjoy weather, get great cardiovascular health, make new friends, reduce stress save money vehicle expenses? Tbf, EU stockpiles AZ using. bigger issue imo. Manitoban here. Currently rules outside anyone household, still go mall! sure yet, we're getting close - 67% entire population (75% adults) protection (prior infection + vaccinated) virus. Bicycling BEST. I've never found anything else that's brought instant joy awesome health benefits. Check r/bicycling, nice sub. Incorrect? UK get promised either, got pretty low fulfillment rate. took toddler daycare due covid husband homemaker. 2 year old diaper still wears mask go out. Why? lot selfish, stupid adults taking pandemic seriously want kid hurt them. We're also fully vaccinated still wear masks. And, I'm making up, kid wants mask on. makes sure covers nose, run around playground kids without it, even kids wearing masks. Yeah, we're selfish psychos trying protect precious human planet barely understood threat little longer.

But pandemic private office gone plane rides? Get f*** judging people sacrifice protect children . thought first, I'm certain kind infection point. hit daughter first, son, wife, me. daughter back normal everyone else seems recovering order. slight fever night, I'm feeling bit better today. I've still got congestion, though.

My wife actually used one tests daughter first got sick, since young vaccinated. negative everyone else got it, sure something. Wiping little kids' noses seems make odds getting sick increase whole lot. It’s based self-reported data, random surveillance sample, say thus probably underreports asymptomatic people need tested.

Many asymptomatic cases workplaces mandatory testing. Currently, cases semi-strict lockdown. double blind bit saying weird. placebo controlled bit. Placebo controlled means control group injected something nothing, like salt water. 

Double blind means neither participants researchers know who's control who's actually taken vaccine. people know who's control trial ends, prevent cherry picking stopping trial prematurely. Instead researchers stop trial reach predetermined number infections total, knowledge percentage infections control trial already ended. also means participants act differently depending got, knew sure they'd got real vaccine might reckless someone knew they'd got placebo. UK governmemt make decision? many VITT cases derived AZ vaccine doses fatal, percentage whole?

(If we’re relative comparisons) really important vaccine get doses, far many others.

That true.

But Indonesian healthcare workers (who mostly young) Sinovac 91% protection mild cases. Guessing mean UK? underdelivered everyone. ever know ""Long COVID"" like know Chronic Lyme Morgellons. weird alright. going get data older vulnerable people already vaccinated?

Being placebo group also means vaccinated end year. I'm helping science screw that. manitoba wonder fuck got here? know someone who’s getting vaccine wife nurse half doctors hospital won’t get it.  thinks doctors won’t get it, shouldn’t either.   bummer pretty much known point due whole mess Baltimore.

All all, even doses J&amp;J end goal would delayed 2 weeks-ish. little grand scheme things given dead middle summer viral circulation probably low anyway. assume doses delivered still. Funny Emilia Strong doesn’t see money used respond ongoing crisis. Getting people vaccinated far effective buying ventilators, etc. 

I think ridiculous people need financial incentive get vaccinated, lottery clearly positive effect. would like know Miss Strong thinks would better use money point, starts running mouth waste. vastly coronavirus there

That true year though. think people would like compare risk normal year going forward. normal year lot flu there.... still Covid there. really important compare 2020 2020 compare 2020/2021 Covid average flu year. Theory decades study maybe, hypothesis presently Yep, anti-vaccine aware vaccines amazing magic bullets support continued mask wearing public health measures reach much higher vaccination rates, much lower case rates, currently. Pfizer problems EU EU biggest customer

You misspelled Biontech True, mostly due Google Translate. I'd translate ""First shipment Turkey - BioNTech 120 million dose deal arrives""

30 million every month. another shipment Monday. Titles ""health official"" title instead name always suspicious. looks good, too, unfortunately manufacturing really task. think figures June. also circa 100k delivered April May, around 150k - 300k 600k Head CDC clearly said it. vaccines work. Cases plummetting 50% vaccinated. Indian variant bypass vaxx. head CDC feels comfortable telling Americans including everyone nursing homes take masks indoors, really want hear? want 0 spread going happen maybe years ever. Masks vaccinated safety blankets point. time look vaccinated covid vs activities realize we're anything 350m people going big numbers. know many kids get badly hurt soccer trampolines year? media ran graphic trampoline injuries 24/7 would never see one again. Life risk, vax ""finish line"" elderly president told country. 


ANTHONY MASON: Right. talked little bit, tell more. know people vaccinated? spread virus?

ROCHELLE WALENSKY: series studies looking testing people vaccinated week week every week screen them. rates asymptomatic infection really extraordinarily low situations. zero, extraordinarily low. also know vaccines real world setting shown 90% 95%, 97% efficacy.

Yes, occasionally seeing infections occur people vaccinated. we're seeing infections tend lower amount virus. tend asymptomatic. tend mild. believe lower amount virus really means can't give anybody else. Could different vaccine vaccination strategy. vaccines use Singapore? Seychelles seeing surge cases even 80+% vaccination rate. completely certain many cases contracted people 2 weeks 2nd dose, apparently vaccines Sinopharm there's suspicion much closer 50% effective 80% effectiveness Chinese government claims.   frequent symptoms described indicate virus harmed them. Fatigue, shortness breath, brain fog.

Because lot people getting vaccine here. really matter, effective preventing serious disease That's awesome. Glad able get vaccine early enough save remember gov telling people months ago going different place summer cancel August events going April. Thankfully, people listened already able attend outdoor music festival (which canceled last year). I've also gotten word summer festivals town, surrounding towns, going planned. understand gamble though. Thanks, that’s even worse realised I'm hoping continue roll second doses night help turn tide. First dose nicely effective Kent variant, one seems take two doses really stop spread. Luckily we're well underway that.

It seem like UK gets hit variants harder mainland Europe US matter do. 😕 lock hard enough last autumn Kent variant kicked asses. lock hard vaccinate fast one still causing concern countries like US fewer measures great. Population density, maybe? people using test like have. 

Even creator test said shouldn’t used way. Unfortunately died 2019. Also pretty sure guy hated Fauci. 

Its wild ride lol guess means doses produced Emergent Baltimore destroyed extremely delayed. already made 100M doses could one largest production scandals modern history.  don’t choice. invited government chooses one get. Experts seem agree transmission period usually 10-14 day window, times specific individual. shed others longer others. general guidance really address possible individual differences.

Though typical, people contagious months. testing never left area... Went doctor 5 covid symptoms, would test me... step daughter. agree. still can't give much rna once. discussed bit regards changing vaccines variants coronavirus spike protein changes would reduce amount rna variant combined single shot.
So far, mRNA vaccines seem need significant changes cover variants though. Misleading title, entire batch 120 million isn’t delivered yet. Article says 30 million end June 90 million end September. Largest single market US ends everyone vaccinated, obviously. highly effective preventing serious illness, although Pfizer/BioNTech bit better also preventing mild infections theoretically provide protection longer period time (due double dose). J&amp;J advantage single-dose, finished faster.

If get either one earlier, would say take one. available time, would recommend Pfizer/BioNTech unless really like needles want get faster. biontech clinical trial numbers somewhere, suggesting 96% infections symptomless vaccination, read article israels numbers february, think also suggested 98% cases won‘t light symptoms, mentioned another percentage similarily structured several classes symptoms, cannot remember, can‘t even find site biontech states vaccine mostly intended tested getting rid symptoms infection, making new number much good. hear you, seems cautious oversanitising destroying microbiome. made lab, make people likely get vaccinated? would coincidence come lab. Looks like R=1.1 need vaccinate people (like 10% 20% currently vaccinated) stop growth case numbers.

It's interesting B.1.617.2 struggling take hold Germany (it went 1.9% 2.2% latest weekly update), already dominant UK. Hopefully gives us enough time administer vaccine doses Germany. Fucking Wyoming

To fair they’re getting less 100 cases day nieces trapped home year sister’s controlling husband. refused let us see recently (when finally vaccinated), won’t let go store mask mandates lifted, person school they’re vaccinated, can’t play parks children playing. It’s disturbing me. ridiculous part apparently allowed play cousin attending school I’m confused allow barred us seeing past months vaccinated... certain sister’s husband girls far worse impact would getting covid. positive rate infection 0.3% although slightly increased still pretty low. They're ramping vaccinations areas variant present - sister got vaccinated yesterday, even though falls age bracket currently eligible vaccination. fucking cares? People dying. long, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years. end? rest world reopen move Australia still living fear. Wow, guess..? Haha! Pfizer problems EU EU biggest customer nice sideeffect biontech seems odd. I've heard people refer previously covid ""vaccinated."" misleading. ones forcing take AZ second dose.

What saying, scared, wait get satisfactory data options (2-dose AZ vs 1-dose AZ, 1 dose mRNA) making decision. you’ve said previous post, quote “data second doses sufficient yet”. applies aforementioned cases. unsure initial data 2 dose AZ, even unsure non-existent data mixing two doses. studies haven’t completed yet. Maybe reading, studies done prove No, get essential nutrients snack.

Just eating less seldom works, reason someone might overeat first place often didn’t meet nutritional requirements (even though might gone way calorie requirements) note this. Even virus escape lab, necessarily mean man made. could analyzation, could also natural virus modified gain-of-function (i.e. partly man made). Good point. think people would aware behavior pandemic but, alas no. Nearly everyone eligible never see high enough uptake maintain zero covid, even made mandatory. long virus still exists, unable reopen world constantly going lockdown. country scheduled receive 600,000 doses J&amp;J vaccine end June, best case scenario would 235,000 vaccines worst case scenario would 60,000. They're saying still get vaccinated regardless many people vaccinated. rely herd immunity get vaccinated. everyone relies herd immunity there's herd immunity.

It absolutely not. Kids would spread parents family members. looks like adults telling kids get really work out. Kaiser data seem differ CDC version? curious! vaccinated people told reason test, means larger number people tested represent much higher % risk population it’s targeted likely accurate. Yes fear fault yes worth losing sympathy over. may technically true, matter semantics. lay people distinguishing asymtomatic vs presymtomatic.

It's incredibly dangerous foolish experts orgs go around stating asymptomatic transmission happen without emphasizing presymptomatic (which did).

All results people thinking can't transmit unless fever, cough, major symptoms. Bad news. gets worse. I’m mid-30s lost touch lot mid-20s friends lower socioeconomic class. don’t time struggling frankly interests changed. Partying drinking isn’t enough 30s. They’re working struggling raise family DINK wife traveling taking expensive hobbies. don’t really want hear trip Italy don’t really want hear kids. forget Peru nice would save lives, aren’t going move kids required masks schools indefinitely. That’s going happen. going spread outside school anyway. True. science work. Theory proven.

Personally still find hard understand fragments DNA blood stream causes clots WBC I've seen rest look like almost motorcycle thickness tires, they're practical offroading I'll look “Now”? 7.4% bad, need test way find every infected individual try get ahead this. else start spreading unchecked community. Whoa, get load wry comments here. 

While happy pandemic subsiding places North America, Manitoba literally worst entire time.

But ya, keep glib, petty snipes coming. Australians claiming need vaccines give countries community transmission? flu. Look up. disagree statistic. entire family vaccinated. kids got since young vaxxed. passed around everyone. think another strain vaccine didn’t protect against. Going work something enjoy prepare next pandemic I'm high risk Roughly 1 7 (in studies even more) children w covid experience headaches, brainstem cerebellar issues, muscle weakness reduced reflexes. think made deal Moderna, course it'll long time delivered given late order.

McDonalds. Check FYI long bike ride easily 2k calories. Probably easier eat first place sustained activity burns serious amount calories bet youd different attitude family member died one highest fully vaccinated populations country, well world, something happy about. think many people really expected situation vaccines would stop symptoms allow rampant asymptomatic spread.

Really? remember stressed year vaccines guaranteed stop even reduce chances spread, months ago, many articles even said prevent spread.

Either way, sounds like ""COVID GONE"" crab rave memes coming sooner expected, so, yaaay Yes. Yes, fun taking care sick kid. 10 month old niece diagnosed COVID last week hardly sleeps coughing wheezing time. apparently brother SIL sick even though they're fully vaccinated, making taking care even less fun. would weaken fragile narrative Yep this.

Also, lot younger people vaccinations open. takes month half first shot fully protected.. got mine asap, got 2bd shot recently, takes 2 weeks get full protection

Just opened teens recently, lot wanted wait finals case made em feel bad day.

Some people middle switching medications, might medical issue e resolved time preventing getting it.

What old lady without internet smart phone? Places like pharmaceies require appointment. Sure theres walk big mega sites, 87 year old aint driving across state.

We arent number vaccinations needed yet either. stop ""forget you, got mine"" attitude.

Im 30s, workout, healthy horse. didnt wear masks get vaccine protect myself, protect vulnerable neighbors. Snow stop you. Get fat bike. Game changer. Funny ignorance confidence go together sometimes. single dose works well original strain variants circulating Canada. questions it’s efficacy variants, especially India variant, real world data behind concern. fact, England accelerating second doses communities India variant spreading effort contain it.

Public Health England says data indicates single dose Pfizer vaccine 33% efficient preventing infection India variant. data also shows two doses would agree single dose strategy proven better choice. doesn’t mean there’s nothing worry about. England’s cases rising metrics ahead strategy implemented here.

You know, it’s possible discussions good faith without childish sarcasm. people claim asymptomatic people spread virus.  I'm sure get kid flu shot. Hopefully get one covid soon too! ""full vaccination"" apply individuals received two doses Pfizer Moderna? efficacy one dose J&amp;J terrible. one ten thousand. bad odds. Exactly. many times already read several articles globally adenovirus lacks capability enter nucleus people concerned. One article even CAPS agree vaccines surpassed expectations effectiveness, awesome. think many people really expected situation vaccines would stop symptoms allow rampant asymptomatic spread. nothing else, really compute virus spreads. Fewer symptoms = less viral load = less spread. vaccines shown effective, always pretty much expected they'd make big dent asymptomatic spread well, even anticipate exactly incredibly effective really would be.    Lol. responding Fauci :) Yay better Pennsylvania. Glad bar ""better Pennsylvania's number"" Open yes, children attend person, no.    What's bad wearing mask? Cant get covid dead. Vaccine works!! risk parents/grandparents home prior availability vaccination risk kiddo bringing *home* Covid - everything black white... Thanks next   guaranteed true. We're testing least twice much right time last year, even though testing drastically declined past months. finding similar number daily cases twice testing pretty solid bet there's significantly less covid now. Hm that’s kind annoying, hopefully word spreads people feel safer Yep. 100% schools fullly open, right now, exceptions. Never closed. go egregious mistake recent history. daughter fucking 16 months old affected shit. I'm it. Yes thats stupid. minimize risk ending ventilator wasting resources could go immune compromised.  thought several million went Mexico?  That's better Pennsylvania's number. people running 45 miles week. doable, people. 1 mile generally 100 calories. Obviously, like said, depends weight. lot easier drop daily oreos, Obviously even better. stretched massaged first one think made worse tbh. doctor, symptoms definitely better symptoms.

In case, testing positive mainly means need completely quarantine others (in consultation physician). Gonna go back hardcore exercise ever loved shape next dumb animal someone eats.

I understand sentence, help clinical trials control groups- trials, vaccine 95% effective. surprising that, build herd immunity, vaccine even protective 95% people protecting you, top vaccine received.

And ways conduct studies without explicit control group. Yeah, thought. Thanks. Nice, time Oh yeah course, think considering serious phobia is, might best avoid it. want extra comfort, try get mask mainly protects since benefit others. 来てください！  week ends worked 7 day extension hit magic 14 days slow spread Well imagine small portion know lifted. Unlikely, underestimate things like self absorption language barriers. I'm sure know care, wanting keep others safe. might polite like mentioned. might want hassle confronted explain they're vaccinated keep track still wants wear masks.

I get side effects argument holds water, important things personally blame choosing cooperate get unlucky get bad Covid American comment seen lmao experts expected vaccines less effective turned be, asymptomatic spread prevalent vaccinated people turned be, vaccines less effective current variants they're turning be. Again, guesses expectations people fields, laypeople. helpful explanation, thanks!

I see distinction pre- a- symptomatic useful data gathering contact tracing.

But I've heard people literally say ""asymptomatic spread real, long stand face face someone actively coughing Covid, I'm good"". clearly hear care distinction pre- a- symptomatic spread, say, intisingueishable late. saying 3 quick-test station Taipei 811 test 7.4% positivity rate yesterday.  
AFAIK, quick-test need PCR-test confirm. 7.4% still good number. offend mean need shut up. still disappointed makes glaringly clear lot people need bribed right thing. mean knew were

I mean knew didn’t R0 measles didn’t infect outside. physically possible get big dose 99% time another human wind. That's live 45% fully vaccinated... used smart... Smh Mask reduce flu transmission well, know. misleading headline removed.

The relevant stat percentage people gotten infected vaccination vs control. 

This basically like saying 99% people don’t get COVID vaccinated. irrational fear. can't use logic defeat it.

I'm special Ed teacher rate healthy teachers vaccinated (pfizer Moderna) recently ALSO gotten covid, exceedingly rare small scope life, moderate big city US. like kinda high seems. department spread across two small school centers, outbreaks bad school considering canceled insular, ton foot traffic. One gal covid last summer vaccinated Feb, Pfizer recently tested covid positive close contact. mildly symptomatic
So numbers, talking like atleast 5 vaccinated teachers/adults like... total 20/25 teachers happening last couple weeks now. know two people total vaccinated also got sick, pretty bad couple weeks.
Kiddos I'm sure info shared outside sped teams. buildings quarantining now. Australia went AZ vaccine, local manufacture everything. blood clots issue hit govt stop giving anyone 50 make big late deal Pfizer. Pfizer vaccines arriving September later supply limited. deals Moderna vaccines far know. much stigma lack understanding mental health issues. initial reactions problems wrong centered (“but everything right!” “what people think?!”). It’s hard get away stigma instead face reality: gave kid lots love hell stockpile genes... manic-depressive disorder, OCD, extreme anxiety, depression, alcoholism, anorexia... kind laundry list immediate families. wrong think could “love” mental health difficulties like couldn’t loved scoliosis (which does). She’s amazing kid, eyes open complexities brilliance ways may need additional support life. I’m beyond honored mom, got initial rush guilt instead focused her, became much easier. I’m sure parents feel way. Florida’s daily cases 11 per 100,000… I’d hardly call “hot spot” sure? Where’s evidence people got severe permanent lung nerve damage didn’t enjoyed more?

Wut? tried analogy went nowhere lol. definitely seems way, long figure way avoid antibiotic resistant bacteria becoming huge problem! example, thanks mRNA research looks like we'll probably finally vaccine HIV fully approved end decade! western world consumed internal strife western world concerned actions Russia Holy fuck. Amazing sure? Where’s evidence people got severe permanent lung nerve damage didn’t enjoyed more? Currently: Pfizer Moderna. "" simply getting covid also gives long lasting immunity effective variants studied far.""

Where get idea? study done Washington U said that. said long-term memory cell stored bone marrow mild covid-19 patients.

""The researchers acknowledged study looked bone marrow people mild cases virus, asymptomatic cases, moderate severe cases. Ellebedy said age group participants relatively young, unclear whether older group individuals would shown immune response. participants ranged 30 69 years old.""

Dr. Sharon Frey, clinical director St. Louis University’s Center Vaccine Development, said scientists suspected presence cells, found viruses, like influenza.

The body’s response COVID-19 complex, Frey said, cells “just piece overall immune response.” still many unknowns long protection last, protective different variants may change amount cases total number deaths kids have, doesn’t change rates/chances death serious illness children. 

These studies look kids who’ve gotten covid, avoided mitigation measures, children got covid, tiny, tiny percentage gotten seriously ill even smaller percentage died. 

So looking risk serious illness, whole “kids masked distanced” rationale doesn’t hold since we’re looking specifically kids got covid risk severe outcome. issue federal side. wanted distributed GPs state health departments. they've fucked bad states started setting hubs still rely vaccinations feds. Calling ""failures"" unfair, lot people simply arguing covid cannot suppressed long term without vaccines. Therefore, robust vaccination programme, dealing root problem. duck trials bad? Something doesn’t add all. Two doses vaccines though? Yeah, confusion frustrating since bad faith anti-maskers point agencies like saying ""asymptomatic transmission exceedingly rare"" justification showing symptoms wear mask. Obviously, logic flawed presymptomatic transmission absolutely thing, indistinguishable asymptomatic symptoms show up. Which, point late since infectivity occurs days symptoms show up. 

TL;DR
For truly asymptomatic infections, transmission unlikely. impossible different pre/a late, keep wearing mask ya dummies. get vaccinated. one person 100 lies going spread to? employers still requiring regular testing even fully vaccinated. I'd imagine super common, one occasional employers live entertainment sector like this. may change soon. Germany AZ volontarily taken age (as long doctor agrees) take-up pretty high afaik. We'll think unused doses problem arises. Yes true good habits beget good habits! health (physical mental) benefits exercise absolutely support healthy person WANTS eat healthy foods. person suddenly surrounded healthy people communities inherently supports overall well-being. 

I’ve worked people nutrition front didn’t connect life components never sustainable. Changi cluster Singapore contradicts data. 108 cases 25% fully vaccinated (two doses).

-- authoritarian government face.

You may also want avoid *private businesses* still requiring customers wear masks. 2 wave MUCH worse 1. also vaccinated intend live life much possible, unvaccinated still wear masks, kids school continue wear masks, get level cases significantly.

We close vanquishing virus unvaccinated anti masked going keep virus us longer needed. Wisconsin, would kept status quo May 1st 2021, would bet would seen less 25 cases day statewide June 15th. recent changes pushed back month two. wish could convince dad get jab. irrational rage demand intellectual respect delaying too.  Studies vs reporting different things... Totally! phrase “everything moderation” really comes play. wipe grocery carts twice day? Probably. need whole apparatus drench disinfectant every 10 min? Probably not. admit going miss little bit time everyone masked washing hands sanitizing surfaces everywhere. personal health amazing literally cold since 2019 point. said sniffles freedom! China balls claim almost 0 cases since beginning last year, populated country world. Anyone see bullshit reporting virus been. Sure can.

Still useful program works. Name checks out. Seriously though, want? believe president head CDC, take off. want extra layer protection whatever reason(immunocompromised?) wear n95. cloth masks almost nothing. give 5 minutes ""protection"" vs unmasked. Dressing public make strangers who(sorry break you) care feel better way live. doesn’t matter think. Anyone brain dead isn’t worth energy. office work wants everyone back June 1st. really liked working home bosses prefer everyone office. I'm looking forward spending time money commuting lunch looking forward clearer separation work home. far know, even Moderna vaccine. think shipment recently, could wrong. 

The rollout vaccine bad say least. many eligible, 50 get Astra Zeneca one, essential workers Pfizer think. 

No one motivated, least before. Basically known outbreaks hotel quarantine breaches, another reason Asutralia unlikely open borders anytime soon. get tested weekly work regardless vaccinated not. kids going pretty rough cold right means vaccines actually 99.9% effective? still hearing 60-90% numbers thrown around then? Totally never going win lottery, irritating hear NYC Mayor say literally almost every week insurances/ immigration status didn’t matter, go list questions insurance / immigration/work status get code find vaccines available.

And certainly could used one 11,000+ weekly subway passes NYC gave ;) daughter turned two. got sick back nov 2019 really hasn’t sick sense. I’m dreading finally catching things things. Nobody apples oranges, didn’t even imply Covid risk kids, unvaccinated kids vector transmit virus risk. 

The goal us treat Covid like Smallpox, chicken pox, measles.

Why let virus linger close getting rid it? I've also reading quite lot also pointing JJ vaccine one worst, partially thanks single dose. forgot include 12pk Natty Light believe studies USA studies China?

Maybe perfect, best have... Well, misinformation got removed moderator, I’m going argue anymore. 

Folks, get vaccinated. vaccines marvels medical science provide tremendous protection COVID almost side effects. they’re free. seems well explained happened glass water?  long vaccination? takes Pfizer 2-3 weeks take full effect. Assuming vaccinated, blame anti vaxxers anti maskers. Wait thought study completely debunked last summer? Chinese propaganda. still know real numbers Wuhan.  BS, Pittsburgh coming spike Why? Rich people poor countries skip middle class people wealthy countries well. I'm ok it. people simply holding society back. I'm compassionate start harm others around them, last year year. Yeah. speaks character moves needle. can't sit complain people change minds change minds knew coming though right? always going get easier. Maybe availability open latecomers, like chances winning high. PCR tests cannot differentiate ""live"" (infectious) virus bits remnant viral RNA recovered patients continue shed weeks months recovery.

This ""false positive"". People test PCR-positive way absolutely infected previously. People never caught Covid would extremely low chance testing positive.  Ok, won’t read follow argument. I’ll put one sentence, use small words.

I linked study breakthrough numbers, claim efficacy numbers, rather claimed backs assertion risk serious disease death incredibly low vaccinated. actually assertion. position CDC reason states relaxing restrictions right now. 

So. disagree that, disagree CDC, fuck right off. clear enough statement you? quite likely IMO. fully vaxxed. coworker got sick tested positive, tested safe. Positive. Never symptoms. coworker tested positive never would felt need get test either. fullly vaccinated following cdc recommendation wear mask. worry anyone judging following science. OMG yes, healthcare workers :( Can’t imagine they’re ever going get trauma they’ve seen last year. point everyone misses. Kids isolated, many even going school person. can’t really compare effects Covid masked, isolated, socially distanced children flu free Petrodish normal school environment. Wait, what, thought supposed go normal channels (normal vaccine) autoimmune disease...

Looking correct I'm wrong could find quick Google able get worked him. Saying cannot try overdose Xanax due single kidney, reason might offer anything stronger

And really tried everything think off, really way suggest I’m asleep night, reason able Maybe want claim peer-reviewed running studies understand whether suggestions feasible. someone claims found potential reason blood clots, still needs treated bit scepticism. 

""Some scientists cautioned Marschalek’s theory one among many, evidence needed substantiate claims."" 
“There evidence missing show causal chain splice . . . of spike protein thrombosis events,” said Johannes Oldenburg, professor transfusion medicine university Bonn. “This still hypothesis needs proven experimental data.” China still claims around 5000 cases? don’t know trust reporting this. Well, yeah also there's still bound little outbreaks foreseeable future. I'd imagine like chicken pox today. 56 people dead sounds like lot. 
My sister got AZ vaccine, extremely reluctant so. option get different one instead, (that currently known major health risks) would smarter option. hand, believe people chances experiencing negative impact Covid alternate vaccine supplied greater chances experiencing negative impact AZ vaccine. It’s really tough call. AMERICA!! FUCK YEAH!!! absolutely insane narrative tossed around COVID successful countries ""failures"" enough vaccines. started East Asia Australia's getting treatment too. soon NZ gets much single COVID case, expect redditors start disparaging well.

Ever think country succeeded getting vaccine COVID successful countries let vaccine first?

It’s certainly contradiction normal world world vaccines children, effectively sum argument. Literally human garbage. Sounds like wasn’t pleasant could much worse research Ohio 1100 19yr olds hospitalized March-Current Covid. 

Nationally 46,000 age group hospitalized due Flu 2018-2019. Ohio 7th largest state, let's assume that's maybe around 2,000 Ohio kids hospitalized flu. 

So virus 10x prevalent, actually fewer hospitalizations Ohio kids Yeah, mind sarcasm.

Any single replication might one mutates wrong way takes us right back beginning every single mutation prevented might one saved plant, never know it. Allowing replication keep happening youth dangerous us. not. since either. think sending vaccine would result even paperwork. adding entire new country bureaucratic process, one paper-pusher.

Also, since Canada's current policy one-shot (with appointments second shots months away), they'd take vaccines give first shots. whole rush border precisely folks anxious get second shot addition first one. Honestly $25K day might bit cheaper even effective.  people entices bad math. seeing ordinary people could make believe chance.

No one's telling children take precautions risk existed shutdown for?

Hospitals getting many horribly sick people get overburdened forced triage patients leave could saved die? We're past risk. thought idea COVID damn scary every demographic shut one could get sick, severely don’t. want protection child, children, returning “normal”.

That's completely contradictory statement. asking beyond normal before. Sure, genuine concerns impact people rest life. like getting T-boned intersection able walk leg amputated. THINK it.

My daughter (16) actually positive via multiple confirmed PCR tests ""real quarantaine"" (Do leave house 2 weeks pay tp 10.000€ fine) whole family. 

I register loss taste wife time. never got antigen test positive PCR test. quarantaine ended testing clean via PCR.

&amp;#x200B;

I happy managed finally get real vaccine shot yesterday (Whole family except son age limit)  definitely good thing. main reason vaccinated prevent 'bad' symptoms (everything hospitalized dying), necessarily preventing getting virus. UK close 10 per million. risk UK AstraZeneca vaccine blood clot observed 262:30.8M (1:118k), specifically 1:90k first dose, 1:120k second dose. Haven’t seen many people mention it, even though wasn’t especially hungry, ate ton dose really helped body power things. don’t specific recommendation, get solid calories good balance protein, fats, carbs spike protein antigens way higher vaccinations. However natural immunity antigens spike virus cell theoretically better unlikely new variant changes lot spike still viable. audacity crying? Goodbye. Sure, genuine concerns impact people rest lives. like getting T-boned intersection able walk amputate leg. Won’t someone think children… wait. Looks like thinking children means letting act like children instead hiding homes.

Take kids park people. misc-c fear mongering please! Yes, without antibody test way know individual person robust lasting immune response covid infection (which, also may cold thought covid).

So, unless alllll people getting positive covid tests, also getting antibody tests months later determining need vaccine robust natural immunity.... then, know. “See look, told vaccines unsafe.”

Do disagree current studies/research shows vaccine induced immunity gives robust response?

Sure, one could quibble calling natural immunity length ""unknown"" length vaccine induced immunity.

But think headline puts much worse light actually said. see house number back. I've seen stories people get robbed winning lottery l. saying. Nope encouraged, body remembered it, that’s felt like got hit ton bricks. friends COVID felt way 1st shot.  friends (including wife I) didn’t COVID felt like second shot. hope throw book hard. 

The fact looks likes crying mugshot cracks up. “lab made,” research purposes, biological weapon. (It would make shitty bio-weapon; takes long can’t targeted well.) practical terms, specific origin, whether zoonotic research, doesn’t really make much difference. way seeding B.1.617.2 Germany, doubt. starting take cases US too, definitely beating B.1.1.7. inevitable happen Germany too.  No, understand infectious disease works. That's always case though. 

Take Ebola example. actually two different sinopharm vaccine? Lol, need ce different name then.

73, 78% good. fast make them? Lol would health official say something like that? someone ask health official make ridiculous statement?  case anyone thinks I'm off, [these unconfirmed cases exactly Sharkey trying get hook add **2 million-plus** people already COVID recovered it, natural immunity acquire that, already 70%.

Michigan 844k confirmed cases. literally know people squawking anyone crazy prefer vaccination natural infection telling people much dangerous vaccine is. people aren’t seeking COVID already (some parents still oxygen 3 months later). 

Sometimes point (this would never work reality) wish would declare 3 week COVID elimination party.  think you’ve never COVID point either get paid $250 first dose go number indoor fire halls mingle ass spend 3 weeks home family sort workers comp.  except antibody tests exist Yeah, I'd probably think differently knew thought covid hit hard previously. Hope relative recovers ends ok! attributing sinister motives people? phrasing ""push downplay"" assumes ulterior, dishonest intent.

In actuality real uncertainty degree previous covid infection confers immunity. vaccine rigorously tested much certainty.

The idea natural immunity unreliable myth pushed agenda - actually plausible thing needs reckoned with, opposed dismissed good mask like kf94 n95?
As me, I’ve fully vaccinated 3 weeks, slowly letting guard down. Learning really trust vaccine. Oh like car, headline figuring sprinted though already consider this... ""protest"" ""attempted murder""? Already read article. know proposed benefit articulated. pandemic magnitude inherently rare event though. saying escape lab, pandemics typically zoonotic viruses many examples exact right conditions happening human history. good news true, though we're talking study...

Also, clear study breakthrough infections likely new, concerning variants.

That's one angle. EU quite well time actually. far behind, cases dropping fast everywhere, millions vaccines rolled get blood clot first dose, would extra extremely unlucky get one second one.

If offered alternative vaccine second dose fine too, make sure get fully vaccinated. Italy Spain know coming, back February 2020.

Yet UK reacted slowly lockdown, resulting death toll similar Spain Italy.

Vaccinated people never infected likely need shots, however, minority infected produce robust immune response.  reports looked people exposed coronavirus year earlier. Cells retain memory virus persist bone marrow may churn antibodies whenever needed, according one studies, [published journal Nature.  study, posted online BioRxiv, site biology research, found so-called memory B cells [continue mature least 12 months initial infection.

Well, we've 0 while, guess want keep way. Also, vaccine rollout very, poor (that done Federal government, whereas lockdown done state government, quite good).

The difference genetic testing confirmed Indian double mutation variant. Last time took week hit 30 cases, time took 3 days numbers like 12 day. think really want kill variant.

But given quickly spreading, city 5 million, lockdown 12 day would seem better alternative. 100%.

This thread full Boris defenders trying equivocate Boris's shitty 'herd immunity' strategy killing thousands unnecessarily somehow much better COVID responses comparable countries like Canada New Zealand.

Conservative leadership fairly clearly correlated poor pandemic responses. individualistic 'everyone themselves' mindset conservatism poor one dealing like worldwide pandemic threatens us whole. got doses since original doses came trial? No. ""infected"" defined? imagine vaccinated person breathe virus, ""infected"", body fights damage individual gets sick. still infection? True, willing it. Many companies not. Sounds like BS. seem likely would made legal commitment way EU acting. proof relatively high efficacy particularly severe symptoms, large sample size. Canada much better per capita deaths UK three US, despite extremely similar cultures. 

In fact, New Zealand also faired much better. 

Progressive leadership much correlated better COVID response. 

There's lot false equivocation thread play defense extremely piss poor responses US UK Trump Boris.

Thousands died Boris's 'herd immunity strategy' one else Europe followed shit example. good fucking reason. 2 year old kids wearing masks? believe he’s mentioning title unclear hospitalisation part, people might spend time read article entirely. realise one people reads articles regurgitates things read here, subrddit everyone knows super pro lockdown anti sort plan looking possibly covid even vaccine would take 3+ years develope one.

How long term sustainability bad thing aim organization focused disease control well healthcare whole population, see obvious trend increased unrest throughout world people locked bored. extended periods half lockdown probably put whole continent back 2 years guess that's would rather whole country locked sneeze.   told almost year ago pandemic officially I'm nightclub without mask hanging friends again. happened last weekend first time year, good feeling. good chance killing parents grandparents.

Interesting. children significant drivers SARS-CoV-2 kid whith asthma kid heart condition... much likely die.

Interesting. Source? Murdoch. [Associated Press article News World Report link local news many articles think people get/got confused read there's proof slows transmission others. People interpret saying stop transmission. proof that's specific thing testing trials. One could assume likely slows transmission slows infections, can't say actual evidence. cases plummeting pretty clear slows transmissions well. Curious think Humira illegal. Vaccines reduce spread, statistic evidence that. random sampling. majority people getting tested seek test due symptoms. No, interpreted ""vaccinated people **may** still carry spread virus"", even symptoms. evenly distributed I’m talking people can’t travel, example musical festival Germany, American attends virtually Yes, admit screwed here. I'm proud planning taking steps better heath. Cheers well! problem it’s uncommon statistic. vaccine isn’t armor. saves you. fine. still spread it.

It’s interesting though! got vaccine passed science class. I’m vaccinated still wear mask care believe science. assume I’m one. makes us unlikely it. don’t don’t believe science tested aren’t vaccinated. 

It’s study vaccinated people.

Darwinism beautiful thing. I’m fine dumbasses getting vaccinated. problem. feel bad though. education system bigger problem isn’t really fault. dangerous it. die, it’s terribly sad 100% bad. option said no. That’s us.  Alternative title: Rich people poor countries use wealth skip vaccination line. Wonder would make sense us continue wearing masks. else vaccinated people possible carriers spreading viral load. work search latest NACI article said ""everyone take vaccine second shot"" article. idea success relative. Hawaii, public health perspective, success, cost heavy restrictions. Florida success sense remained almost business usual emergency system overwhelmed, deaths. 

Personally, would preferred live Florida throughout pandemic, knowing less safe daily life less normal. point is, everyone different metrics talk success. That’s crazy. ""The CDC report notes certainly underestimate breakthrough infections reporting voluntary many asymptomatic cases may never tested. Also, clear study breakthrough infections likely new, concerning variants.""
-from article studies coming say you’re absolutely, unequivocally wrong. mild/asymptomatic account large number long covid cases. mean, are. friend vaccinated ?

Great vaccinated people.
I really hope case, happens like future, reports advantage, I'll get it.

I would like add concern.
In Spain, people vaccinated 1st dose Astra Zeneca, asked 2nd dose prefer. (They suggest Pfizer)
Could tell science behind situation?
Is freaking untrustworthy government lets normal people without science knowledge, choose second shot, mixing vaccines.
It obvious enough Astra Zeneca, bought lot Pfizer.
How expect trust situation?   vaccine roll nothing government. vaccine roll led health care service. government made many mistakes like sending covid positive people care homes. Dodgy PPE equipment contracts put staff risk lost lot health care staff. Lockdown late, eat help basically encouraging people mingle.( vaccine confirmed) another spike September scientists said lock September late October goverment bother. many contracts handed dodgy friends, never successful track trace despite billions cost. Norris never attended initial cobra meetings. yeah might trend Europe lost lives have, health care services affected longer been. government friends got rich it. disgusting man hope investigation truly outs disaster country.

Currently, 22-day lagged CFR (while back statistical analysis saw found 22 days best correlation reported cases reported deaths) 0.9%.

Wasn’t terrible pleasant either. second vax got similar arm soreness similar fog bit fatigue. like body fatigue though. muscles weren’t sore felt like energy body. Might slight fever/chills barely noticeable might psychosomatic. 

Wife fine first except arm sore. less soreness second shot low grade fever achy bones body started 12 hours first shot lasted 16ish hours. Ended abruptly, took nap feeling like crap woke felt great.  Sadly, probably low efficacy since estimates strains wild shot dark year.

Still get them. Yeah agree need vaccines. time though, months ago, could video time Europe, US elsewhere got vaccines. 

You realise things change right? Time passes. time government sat hands put eggs one basket AZ. us waiting eligible get vaccine. 

But there's still support lockdown. mentally draining right thing save lives. Schools significant driver transmission closed risk people vaccinated. Yippy Unless new York yankees o.o CDC report notes certainly underestimate breakthrough infections reporting voluntary many asymptomatic cases may never tested. Also, clear study breakthrough infections likely new, concerning variants.

Pass. Next study please. Oklahoma reported 368 obviously backlogged deaths. like numbers much better. incorrect idea

This idea it’s study, way say “incorrect” study another study show study correct. scientific research papers also important note patients included severe COVID-19 pneumonia

Please read paper  hecc yeah! You’re acting like every every study ever done full population involved. It’s silly idea. 1% low hell. Make larger study might hit 10%. That’s still super low.

Let’s dive find random sampling means quadrants! Let’s pick one percent acknowledge obviously small number compared unvaccinated (which point) vaccines working well it’s 100%. Now, carrying isn’t harming vaccinated person much would weren’t. That’s different study.

Now logical argument would it’s low good number vaccinated people still wear masks. understand potential pass on. that’s logical point.

You aren’t 100% wrong it’s fruitless argument make. Science combination n dimensional hyper volume possibilities point doesn’t rank high. 

I wasn’t trying dick. I’m sick arguments science. It’s 1%. it’s damn low involved study. cell death results scarring. Cells constantly dying multiplying. slightly higher cell turnover major local cell death event, there's tissue structure living/dead cells. Muscle tissue better healing many kinds cells, sure got idea muscles scar easier. 
But idk. first thoughts. vaccine actually cause cell death? bike commuted years. highly recommend I'm going give tips

Start slow. Plan ramp biking much plan bike say 2 days week 2 weeks, 3 days 3 weeks biking everywhere

Know change tube, easy. Co2 pumps awesome little lifesavers.

You engine. heater. take little time sial outfits, getting hot, slow down. cold, speed bit (but careful getting sweaty cold out)

It rain. love riding rain. Get good rain suit. great waterproof shoes dress shoes big boots, whatever like. 

You uncomfortable occasionally get used commuting bike stick learn dress ride way work .ale happy

It's can't bothered, argument well founded first place looking excuse pull out. ""As variants, 69 percent experienced mild symptoms antibodies fight infections mutated strain South Africa six months later, 75 percent Indian strain, 81 percent Brazilian variant 85 percent British type, study showed. percentages declined slightly one year later.""

The 97% six month vs 96% one year original covid-19.

But 25% mild symptoms people six months enough antibodies Indian strains dominated near future. 25%, that's opposite long-lasting. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

When polio vaccine came out, parades people literally danced streets. breakthrough gets bunch people arguing internet. Hopefully, one day we'll look back thankful it. talking countries laughing vaccines thinking need them.

Every country world either purchased vaccines plan get COVAX. going pretend one second distribution fair? Every country wants robust vaccine program can't vaccine hoarding supply issues.

Countries like Australia/NZ/SK/etc. realize they've done well continue therefore country like India Brazil use vaccine more. Worst case scenario, finish vaccinations winter instead summer.

I'm pointing straight insane narrative flipped form ""western countries hoarding vaccine"" ""western countries ones smart enough vaccinate"" countries decency charitable pointed at.

we also assume vast majority get one shot follow up.

some highlights data page include:

7 states 60% vaccinated. Vermont first state hit 70% total population vaccinated tomorrow. 

8 states 40% vaccination. fact multiple states half Vermont's rate disturbing. Good luck finding people anti-vax willing participate CDC study. imagine authentic control group would hard set well. Given placebo vaccination, won’t day-after symptoms liabilities telling unvaccinated people go unmasked would be... incredibly irresponsible.

I agree you, data presentation could made easier chew. Reminds study showed mask mandates 2 percentage point difference cases/deaths. Percentage points different percents, yet people read percentage points percent.  cost 50 Ct per piece. hope fix used countries afford/didn't want pay premium vaccines 😔 Many antivaxers citing post-immunization positive tests reason vaccines work, PCR binary test result measuring presence absence virus, actual infection binary process, continuum viral load. current research evidence revealing viral load post-immunization positive tests?

Maybe go ask weightlifters, probably talking vaccine. disease expert , think depends mean ""need.""

Getting infected gave degree protective immunity, means re-exposed virus, body would *probably* fight quickly without much trouble. may still get sick bit, may still pass others time.

Getting vaccinated gives strong *sterilizing* immunity greatly reduces chance getting sick infecting others. antibodies would destroy virus chance take hold.

So sort gray area. Getting vaccinated still beneficial you, *probably* would danger without it. make sense? 100% adults, well near it. Spain reach similar numbers, safe home. I'm sure travel work you. might get tested instead, heard anything medical exemption part travel cert system.

You definetly one cases people can't get reason need get many others vaccinated protected too. single New York? They're far behind Pennsylvania metric, they're already ahead giving 2nd doses. Yes, worse that. cycles, less reliable test. Labs cycling 30 times creating false positives considered asymptotic infections.

At end April, CDC longer accept test 28 cycles vaccinated people (not unvaccinated) result positive. course going skew results every cycle doubles chance positive result. good move limited cycle count everyone. doubt vaccines work, germane note that, May 1, CDC apparently accepting ""breakthrough infections"" PCR test run cycle threshold greater 28. 

For non-vaccinated, cycle threshold remains 30s 40s.

The CDC also counting asymptomatic infections cases mild symptoms among vaccinated positive cases. hospitalization required, counted Covid case. among vaccinated. not-vaccinated still considered positive cases even they're asymptomatic present mild symptoms.

Had PCR tests used cycle threshold 28 everybody ignored asymptomatic cases cases mild symptoms, number people testing positive Covid would dramatically lower would number Covid deaths. Lord, home state Missouri won’t come anywhere close 70%. Lowered PCR Threshold genetically therapied 28 vs usual 35 40 Thousands schools open person since last August.

If math correct means odds getting infected Covid 34 times greater you’re vaccinated are. realize much impact. 

Someone please correct math I’m wrong. Might .02% test tomorrow. I'm fully vaccinated feel like tested positive back Dec. “They terk er jabs!”

Gerrrdurkereejeeeebs?! don’t agree. risk children minimal doesn’t change equation whatsoever terms wait vaccine. wait, you’re waiting send back world basically equal risk one it. math simple. 300 kids 17 died COVID. 44,000 causes. much worse things worry about, even preventable. read 40,000 American kids lost least one parent covid. 

And 600,000 (likely closer 1 million) people perished family, friends, employees, colleagues, throes grief. 

Then tack millions PTSD ICU covid wards, tens millions still suffering lingering physical psychological effects covid (and downstream effects that)

Caveat here, presymptomatic cases absolutely do, asymptomatic transmission EXCEEDINGLY rare. even several vaccinated people getting infected, ""missed"" infections asymptomatic likely contribute transmission substantial amount, even all. Asymptomatic, truly asymptomatic, transmission kind like outdoor transmission surface transmission. Technically possible, odds low something really even take consideration.

It's mentality 5 year old boy. I’ve already hit norovirus worst cold I’ve years. likely always (although stress can't say yet sure yet), virus remain endemic boosters needed.

I reckon maybe next 10 years people need coronavirus boosters, enough people vaccinated becomes rare enough one vaccination part ""entering school kid"" vaccinations enough life.

So all. Get shot. Yeah well life normal dead crippled affects. Yikes. **New Jersey Update**

Only 6 days worth data numbers likely fluctuate till tomorrow due actual uptake rate. Population numbers based 2010 census.

5.242 million NJ residents 1st dose - 59%

(5.217 million - 58.7% yesterday)

5.052 million 18+ 1st dose - 72.8%

(5.033 million - 72.5% yesterday)

89.5% 65+ first dose (89.4% yesterday)

At rate, first dose shots reach percentages dates. 

**Total Population Numbers(59% Now)**

60% - 5/30 (no change)

65% - 6/16 (no change)

70% - 7/3 (7/2 yesterday)

**18+ Numbers (72.8% Now)**

75% - 6/4 (no change)

**65+ Numbers (89.5% Now)**

90% - 7/20 (7/21 yesterday)

95% - 9/2 (9/3 yesterday)

7 Day Rolling Average (really 6 days) 26,086 first dose shots 26,363 yesterday. Like said might fluctuate next days due calculations based 6 days uptake itself. data anyone wants see different way presenting data lmk. Yes. 9 year old cold strep going around. I’ll take it!

As example, know fully vaccinated couple one child mask less daycare wouldn’t come outdoor gathering small group people(&lt;10 people, alcohol), 90% fully vaccinated. It’s like child going school indoors moderate risk, outdoor gathering rather small risk even stated CDC. rather properly cautious, stuck overly cautious world think people forever.

Why disease models modified since acknowledgement airborne transmission? 

Where aerosolization generated? really nasopharynx 80 square metres lung surface area nothing it? 

Is initial period asymptomatic lung involvement impossible?

When aerosolised virus inhaled, think magically sticks nasopharynx reach lungs? 

Why high load throat swabs great marker disease severity transmissibility? - particularly young kids - high loads throat swabs yet usually pathetic transmitting? ever hear superspreading kids?

Or maybe aerosolization virus myth?? (I think so)

The model virus first entering nasopharynx, proliferating later moving south lungs make much sense consider aerosolization. reeks dogma think likely way around many cases.

But I'm random redditor know.  It’s literally like order magnitude dangerous driving work, optics nice hopefully might positive effect vaccination rates (which would actually save lives) others probably right resources might better spent elsewhere much higher benefit.

I strongly suspect ""mild"" cases relatively common, enough people might want think twice going back work shutting unventilated offices unvaccinated co-workers. 

I know what's going CDC lately, recent cluster\*\*\*\* change guidance masks refusal track critical COVID case data, they're really negligent duties. Could wrong, way comment replied reads OP fully vaccinated, exposure somebody (their partner) contracted covid passed scheduled vaccinated. Boston pretty bikeable, bad biking thru winter, except days snows. Sadly know someone think way. care someone takes feel deserves  Try r/askscience. 

I’m sure actually answered controlled vaccine trials sure either way. I’d hate think you’re getting informed answer nobody could possibly one. lot guesses extrapolations I’ve heard follow really faulty logic inferences. Poor kids days. already get real childhood extreme nanny state live now. can’t even go play alone anymore. Now, pandemic idea come even slightly sane. **Massachusetts update**

Notes: 

* Population uses 2020 estimates, such, percentages slightly lag CDC data, however, percentages take account entire herd, higher 2020 population compared 2019's used CDC. Also note 12+ number available 2019 population values. Yea think 95% symptomatic COVID I’m reading right. Though understand I’m trying figure would difficult know vaccine that’s 6 months old mean, considering offering surplus vaccines countries anyway? cannot believe gabapentin rx’d kids. Wtf Right?! Read comment response guy. ABSOLUTELY obviously impacts positive way. 

I’m truly sorry you’ve different experience incredible plant.  Meh, I'm never going theatre consume weed least 5x/week without doubt major tool toolkit. way wouldn’t shame anyone taking antidepressants, coffee, insulin, pre-workout, meditating, don’t attempt shame people “using drugs” “cope life problems stressors”.

I quit drinking 5 years ago alcohol toxic poison negatively affecting life. Cannabis tool major blessing enhanced positivity impacted life (and turn, around me). change, I’ll reassess then. 

I’m wondering model “healthy” subscribe to. also mean virus damage overall gets killed right away? 100%. feel well, but, covid, cause I've vaxed, right?

Not sure right strategy, Michigan, numbers people vaccinated increase, overall numbers decreasing. 

I one, vaccinated, get covid test feel well.

Think time boosters. Man, good pair headphones oled tv already better. already hear British nationalists sub rumbling risk death % healthy population Maybe! even 10 20x that, that’s amazing think that's it. Omaha carnage captures imagination others; people talk Utah worry too. son still unvaccinated overweight always bad time colds etc. want return home visit. fully vaccinated Singapore Indian variant saw fact earlier week! It’s absolutely crazy. studies shown effective new variants though. 

A study also found vaccine even effective preventing transmission (viral load doesn’t become high enough shed practically every instance), fact every asymptomatic breakthrough case isn’t discovered less worrisome. people like article implies. don’t get tested, never know. 

Yes, it’s rare; person **ten times** less likely get infected Covid they’re vaccinated they’re not. it’s rare headline makes sound. Bruh that's like world right now. country people 60+ trying get vaccinated currently getting sinovac limited supply. devastated England's got good right now.

I'm gonna leave conversation there. possibility one never ending ones.

I appreciate taking time replying though. genuinely interested mean. Keep mind asymptomatic presymptomatic different things! mind mask mandate personally

Cool. body, choice. don’t impose views others. Asymptomatic spread = extremely rare.

PREsymptomatic spread = common Checking It’s though, even interventions 600,000 people died covid obviously much flu. 

Since we’ve 10x + amount covid deaths flu 2019, covid anywhere deadly children adults, we’d assume would way bigger difference 100 additional deaths even mitigation efforts. you’re talking noble cause “not profiting” AZ vaccine… that’s statement CEO. 

Since profit defined revenue minus cost.. could well give execs big bonus reflect that.

That “noble cause” holds little water… actually noble cause make vaccine trademark free… done so

So… quit “oh AZ earning money it!” Bullshit  COVID-19 fell 5% 3,969 week ended May 23, fewest deaths week since March 2020.

This seems like much interesting fact me! Masks, yes. Mask masks, no. style called origami mask. continue wear masks fear anti vaxer anti masker

Huh?

Also, purely social pressure. Masks weren’t supposed political right ?

Lol saying antivaccine antimasker political persuasion suggesting people afraid looking like things political. Legit, made political think China using Sinovac people. mainly using Sinopharm.  see. Well, continue parent best way know how. matter anyone stands masking vaccinations, one thing agree look forward Covid done with. Yeah that’s cream requested, honestly don’t know unwilling use 

But even cream really help, know pain beyond minimal one way smaller past needles, man, 

really given poor hand one, doctors helping 

Honestly way see I’m knocked out, seems silly allowed extreme cases, sure know need check side effects, that’s last problems

For going hope job/travel demand I’m really unfair situation think another part men die covid store fat. Men tend store fat viscerally women store fat subcutaneously. Visceral fat accumulates ceramides activates NLRP3 inflammasome drives cytokine storm see severe COVID cases.

So could similar BMIs type fat detrimental outcomes. 

Another point insulin resistance endothelium. Insulin anabolic hormone activate growth endothelial cells, totally normal process. circulating insulin high due insulin resistance creates overactive growth endothelium causing blood vessel walls grow much, narrowing blood vessel, increasing blood pressure thus damaging them. 

Which comes back sugar diets excessive carbohydrate causing insulin resistance. 

I'd highly recomend book called ""Why Get Sick"" Dr. Ben Bikman. whole book insulin resistance drives every modern chronic disease. love hear man. part, gotta let vaccine roll take course now. favour one country fucking economic bloc permanent? blame lockdowns (yes damage)

Nobody blaming lockdowns kids issues. We're rightfully blaming lockdowns school closures dramatic increase issues past year explained lockdowns school closures. I'm agreeing you, important recognize absolutely still spread vaccinated.

The difference viral load potentially pass others likely considerably less would've otherwise. dependent someone submitting link article CDC's update every day subreddit.

Occasionally post removed moderator rule violation (against data trackers).

There's usually thread sort CDC update daily discussion even dedicated post.  school staff could still die.

True, small number would pretty simple teachers staff distance they're concerned virus. Maybe could even made special accommodations at-risk teachers allow teach home students remain school.

Thinking must simply close schools lazy approach. now, early think covid serious mean isn't/wasn't.

* Population uses 2020 estimates, such, percentages slightly lag CDC data, however, percentages take account entire herd, higher 2020 population compared 2019's used CDC. Also note 12+ number available 2019 population values. Masks used indoors imo. everyone two shots. See Many epidemiologists advise last restriction remove already there. [over 305 million doses data seems date inclusive. That’s Pfizer efficacy data. That’s later study adults age 65. course higher risk. It’s coincidence 94-95 numbers similar. actual efficacy across age groups Pfizer 95% effective preventing infection all. health issues, underlying conditions, weight etc? things important know way. compassion old self (the one best could wound fat/unhealthy) also compassion new “fit” self. Think terms new identity. difference true, lasting life change inevitable regression. Interesting. wonder percentage people getting COVID second time without getting vaccinated? Pfizer. Unfortunately, oral versions long way away point. issue real something gotten nearly much attention should.

You say Xanax work overdosed? I'm entirely clear.  
There many drugs like Xanax also eliminate anxiety period time. get older, inevitable need medical treatment kind point, getting handle benefits vaccine.

I suggest seeing doctor connected vaccination work find right medication get this. 565 deaths per day 7 day average.

Compared last worst year influenza 220 deaths day.

There's seasonality considered, I'm expecting COVID deaths reach baseline month finally put par flu, extremely difficult make arguments restrictions within US, live risk seasonal flu without changing daily behavior.

Then comes epic battle convince state's governor that. comical watch vaccination reopening plans took weeks draft would taken months roll get superceded couple days they're announced either new CDC recommendations President setting new guidelines rendered pointless. point, stop caring. people get vaccinated, fault get infected. Wait fucking second, dude.

The US UK completely different level per capita deaths compared Canada. Germany level either. 

You're also comparing island nations trusting Chinese self reported numbers. 

This deeply false equivalency. almost trying play defense UK US's shitty responses Trump Boris. Actually CDC says Average 2-4 Days. Incubation Period SARS-CoV 2 still listed 14 Days infection. infectious disease higher margin herd immunity. Currently herd immunity appears work many places still careful restrictions lowers R. lower R lower herd immunity threshold. everything reopened R might high spread among unvaccinated stop - example - 60% vaccinated 90%. believes different disgraced conservative, obviously.

Not one, liar, guy trusted right hand man. 

Clearly he's trustworthy, disgusting liar right hand man reflect badly Boris all! people freaking social platforms. ""Yes want give life saving medicine free protect people life deadly disease killed half million people country even survival possibly life long consequences.... but.... WHAT'S ME?""   Conservative far right leaders particular. would thought hand washing masks would protect someone something besides COVID? basically saying herd immunity real?

Wtf? latest lockdown rests squarely shoulders fucking sycophants cabinet.
This 100% avoidable fucking job  one shot lovers, aware going need booster sooner rather later, likely earlier 2-shot vaccinated? really saving much long term, all. may be, always cranks he's misconstruing facts fit narrative.

Just there's indication people develop lifelong immunity circumstances mean given, especially since there's well documented cases people contracting disease twice. remember told go (solo, local) drives, since could take hospital bed got accident. spread COVID people getting gas pump. weird time. Thanks clarifying! “Weasel word” haha actually watched hearing it’s quite clear alarm bells sounding much earlier action taken. can’t give Government free pass comparing us countries who’s Governments likely failed too. compare us Germany exit pandemic half deaths per population competent Government understood risks. definitely surprising lot talk asymptomatic carriers. default assumption right asymptomatic carriers exist.

Here piece tries shed light issue: say Wuhan study done particular conditions *after* outbreak, PCR-positive individuals tested people latest stages infection. thus, rule existence asymptomatic carriers. Congratulations, Turkey! Despite fuck export Americans sure likes talk article outlines covid hotspot provincial administration known mishandling crisis. article also speculates mishandling. 'political' comment provincial conservative administrations Canada statistically worse COVID responses. 

It purely statement fact, relevant conversation covid hotspot. Reducing 'politics' reductionist serve community well. Aren’t guys opening soon? somehow feel like hit oh many issues producing cost doses.... Strange argument....

Something like:

I skip school Dick also skips school. fine. live slum that's norm here. great job! I'm usually huge critic Scott Moe tying reopening overall vaccination target rather letting people claim vaccinated obey rules anymore incredibly smart move. mean number infectious diseases infants risk even vaccines for. RSV one common those. fair it’s like saying know train heading brick wall gonna crash hasn’t crashed yet. don’t long term data right. preliminary data show people likely chronic effects recovering Covid. doesn’t speak Everton friend still hard time breathing recovering Covid he’s always super healthy guy. ran cross country track avid athlete like something you’d hear Mysteries Museum one day! 

“A pandemic novel virus, two medical miracles would prove game changers...”  Yeah, I'm sure true either, conceding sake argument.

Apart say, even assuming adenovirus vaccines necessary universal access due cost, like AZ went COVID-related know-how production facilities would evaporate. suppose someone would buy them, initial delays caused change hands, think likely would better. voted remain despised Cummings Brexit would trust Cummings Johnson every single day week. wonder idea clotting primarily affects young people women fits hypothesis. Clearly didn’t watch committee hearing Flu technically part common cold family, Covid. Wiping influenza viruses corona viruses would nice start. Rhinovirus tricky, unless new type vaccine circumvents normal resistance. don’t like Cummings way Johnson doesn’t look bad this. Either Cummings says true Johnson moron - almost sounds Trumpian asked Chris Witty inject covid live TV - Cummings lying Johnson moron ever hired defended baggage brought.

You can’t use trip Durham dismiss everything says, serious, serious questions answered here. Risk real though. Look what's happening multiple zero covid countries. Vietnam, Taiwan, Singapore simultaneously outbreaks going hundreds cases per day, point becomes open question whether trace everyone get back zero covid. Like Australia, places also low vaccination rates nearly everyone susceptible virus. 

That's Australia freaking handful cases. snuff stage, grows 400 cases day like Taiwan, might able contain it, virus becomes endemic country nearly everyone catch get sick.  I'm vaccinated mask requirements adhere federal state laws. That's did. wondering, Bangladesh.

The headline flair helping. Lumping together South SE Asia equals 2 billion people, way over-inclusive. Brian Pallister absolute disaster healthcare Manitoba. shitshow covid turned chickens coming home roost. logic never tracked given people become infectious presymptomatic phase. Clearly covid spreads perfectly well ways. Plenty reasons believe vaccines would least reduce spread, big one me.  awful whole pandemic revolutionize medicine. Originally vaccine thought take 2 3 years develop 60% percent effectiveness best. churned nearly billion vials vaccines near 100% effective 9 months. completely unknown virus taken within year. never happened human history . really medical miracle able accomplish this. Gives hope future pandemics also wish way track numbers; really want vaccine tourists included vaccine percentage numbers they're actually contributing local herd immunity numbers. get vasectomy ASAP. Someone stupid breed. would assume still fewer colds circulation say time 2019 masking distancing measures, no?  vaxx protect idiot anti vaxxers, covid...😆 I'm libertarian guess I'm making friends issue. still know that. Something adding up, clearly. We've giving millions things world Singapore one getting results. Wendocer Productions fascinating video: cruise ship industry, probably industry shut 100% pandemic, effortlessly bounce back time. Well, hope part family careful going public places. always wear mask protect vaccine spike protein toxic chemical shedding!

Also congrats first dose, select flair / badge nickname sub :-) believe they've lowered normal pharmacy fridge temperatures month. live Texas. Rangers’ stadium announced full capacity, remember everyone went nuts said terrible idea. 

Well... that.... 🤔 

Heck. remember time last year, people claiming world would never again. One guy claimed sporting events would become thing past esports would take main form entertainment. concerts never going occur again. 😅 Plenty water stay hydrated! maybe take nap feel little sick CNN ""many experts long argued"" ""\[COVID-19\] occur naturally"". remember, media-endorsed experts know ""argued"" thing recently intelligence report dropped. mind continues blown whatever's going COVID's origins. reach 70% adults nationwide states probably won’t reach threshold. silver lining would people get vaccinations practically immune Covid extremely likely get sick. people choose get it’s unfortunately them. really talk friends family fence getting believe anything China, bridge sell you. Great article, depth. Let’s get rid common cold we’re it.

And herpes. Fuck herpes. really think education answer people claiming vaccines microchips Bill Gates Anti-Christ? 

You really wanna go there?    Yep! Despite things opening back cases numbers still plummeting!! Proves vaccine works  bess two commonly reported lingering symptoms COVID-19 patients following discharge hospital.

The paper talks patient hospitalized covid, people *moderate covid* still feel symptoms recovered smell weeks/months latter I’m sorry hear grandparents. I’m praying us start donating unused vaccines. Thankful vaccine production exponentially higher  think Sputnik vaccine bad make sound. probably better Oxford/AstraZeneca J&amp;J vaccine theory, production quality quality control probably worse Sputnik. that's really trust Sputnik.

The Sino\* vaccines really great though. I'd agree best vaccines developed USA (Moderna) Germany (BioNTech).  criticizing Australia. jealous tbh. Here’s hoping July month. Seeing large crowds sporting events big plus! First off, Australia zero covid country, meaning shut 12 cases, trace all, quarantine affected, completely suppress outbreak. US, virus everywhere, different levels restrictions try keep virus manageable people get vaccinated, virus continue circulate. Australia really 2 level restrictions. time restrictions all, occasionally short periods strict lockdowns take small outbreaks.

Secondly, Australia (or zero covid country) done good job virus, almost everyone country susceptible it, new outbreaks really bad controlled early. like US probably 100 million plus people already caught disease another 100 million plus people got shots already. extra vigilant trying stamp small outbreaks population vaccinated. We’re getting really really close. think right 10 states 70% adults receiving least one vaccine. reach states would good shape. vaccinations going much better previously thought. Originally expected see maybe 50% population vaccinated somehow it. Things back normal July Covid done winter. 1 full year since started US do? 3 4 western approved vaccines developed Europe (with American support course)  ""The CDC report notes certainly underestimate breakthrough infections reporting voluntary many asymptomatic cases may never tested.

Fucking crazy bananas. guy posting good stuff. Well reasoned, good sources. cdc comes senses, small part guy.

Can't ignore NYT

I really like points overprotective interventions harmless. People forget that. kids summer camp. Everyone must vaccinated take test, stay masked indoors out.

They keep loosening things adults clamping teenagers kids backwards.

No one needs mask outdoors unless very, close. Let alone people confirmed covid negative going camp. trust people lie sick spreading germs indoors. There's lot COVID, cited ONE COVID worry about.....  cannot find job pays 25% want purchase healthcare

A couple years ago, heard job-negotiation workshop people recently able negotiate higher pay exchange added company health insurance plan. However, generally spouses stable jobs pretty good health insurance (e.g. spouse worked Microsoft) company health insurance going good already had.  23 years old, single kidney overweight chunky side

Don’t think that’s high risk thought offering laws live country *should* well way vaccination efforts sitting large stock twiddling thumbs. definitely group people really like best following rules. rules gone, sort lose part identity. know it’s accurate, might want delete post headline readers don’t get wrong idea. Ya cool , way you’re telling AstraZeneca aware trials saying blood clot 1 100k Astra , also incidents know of. holding Covid shot till issues get fixed, pandemic way would get approved. Yeah, point. Masks worn times indoors, regardless whether near someone not. post title relate article? I'm sure better suggestions this, recall seeing video doctor giving shot kid lot distract kid lot repetitive motions, middle applied shot kid none wiser. 

Now, doc (which can't actually remember specifically anyway), probably work you. However, maybe went friend, could something distract you. mean really distract you, like literally soon doctor enters room friend starts slapping face repeatedly, point even notice doctor he's actually give shot. 

That's kind ridiculous extreme, know, given phobia level action might necessary. Another suggestion maybe bring blindfold loud headphones, tell doc need keep seeing coming, tell warn least expect it. 

Again, I'm sure better options, I'm expert zero experience dealing this, ideas. OP 6000 20% 8.5 million? completely true mods take down. remember reading anyone wanted kids school deserved CPS knocking door, events like school dances people dying, stay home get it. year staying home, washing groceries, extremely cautious, got fully vaccinated March finally started slowly return normal. Guess lost smell tested positive week? Me!

Edit: details. feel almost entirely normal. took test yesterday sure allergies, I'm completely shocked turned positive. I'm taking follow test confirm. People Covid tend stronger responses vaccine. There’s chance might feel bad research shows it’ll greatly increase bodies response fighting Covid. read would recommend even though might stronger side effects Can? Nah. time. whole team takes off.  Thank you! know someone locks door exactly 12 times peace mind. Dumb question:

Don’t Covid tests check virus checking presence antibodies? would possible get false positive you’re vaccinated? entirely choice. However, actually could erradicated everyone stayed date vaccines. default status.

This what's happening Polio. essentially erradicated, nobody got Polio anymore people stopped getting Polio vaccine. people getting Polio again.

Same flu, people got flu jab every year we'd save countless lives billions. Flu admissions winter especially huge avoidable burden healthcare system pre Covid things go back normal. see happening anytime soon given I've seen people community coworkers. would get covid spite Cuomo. last movie saw theater pandemic ran wild Sonic hedgehog, enjoyed good experience with. saw Bill Ted 3 drive also nice experience.

I’ve terrible experiences theater years I’m bit “eh” going back, especially amount annoying commercials trailers movie even started

I’ve become used going movies honestly could go drive wait movie come online I’d totally fine People definitely even fully vaccinated. Catching nose still induce immune response, correct? I'm talking anti-vaxxers. Believe not, plateau hit soon terms many people get vaccinated. anti-vaxxers get least two doses Indian variant pose threat. One us, one us! I'm vaccinated person workplace. Still far 3 weeks came trials. I’m saying first dose rollout slowing since they’re focusing second dose rollout hence 34% fully vaccinated always risk. Covid going disappear. probably get less less deadly rare people get vaccinated. think we're going eradicate covid. 

I think that's something people recognize. Unless plan wear mask, sanitize, social distance forever, come level risk comfortable with. Obviously risk level going different everyone. people ok risks now, people ready several months years. would honestly say think return normal *zero* risk... might benefit therapy least serious thinking. get like little card something take doctor look see x employer provided health insurance?

Yeah. insurance card, sort like one get car insurance. generally say employer's name, name insurance company (like Regence Kaiser). give receptionist doctor's office pharmacy put numbers records.

Depending specifics insurance plan, may pay amount up-front doctor visit (called copay) and/or get billed office later anything insurance cover. ""Managed care"" plans generally cover amount plans restrict doctors network. similar car insurance, there's generally deductible insurance kick paid certain amount (per year).

Like job benefit, quality value employer-provided insurance plans varies lot. Good question. Considering high demand vaccines would get first one can. J&amp;J effective preventing hospitalizations death. still great vaccine Seroconversion probably another thing reference here. wish tests saliva. Catching Covid nose ever bloodstream really ""contracting Covid"" mind tbh Thanksgiving Christmas doozies, tho.

Yes, risk complications healthy children higher influenza, however ignores big picture completely. infection rate covid drastically higher, meaning unless take measures prevent spread, drastically larger number cases. individual risk covid VS influenza equal, population risk higher covid. cases equals complications equals deaths.

The whole point masks, lockdowns social distancing reduce spread. guess what.. worked. worked well single death child influenza. means drastically lowered infection rate influenza. Yet still nearly many deaths previous years influenza totals caused covid year, despite everything done sacrificed limit spread. 

You want keep comparing two trying muddy waters fact without everything done limit spread, would hundreds thousands dead children millions dead adults. teacher, kids shocked told stress wasn’t worth phone in. Mental health priority year. there's gaslighting, it'd you. say quoted ...you're literally changing said ability go back reread it... make curious we'll see obvious differences immune systems people newborn-3years pandemic. Religion, health reasons, list go on. I’m saying merit concerned children passing illness onto unvaccinated adults  Anyone link actual study? based study confirms expectations. reason assume opposite?  It’s still largely unknown I’ve seen. worthy research. Flu way known Covid. understand fear had, apples-orange comparison. Secular knowledge flu vs one year Covid, even Covid kinda ""well taken"" youngs, know way different disease adults elders, thus fearful. reasonable adjust risk perception new evidence brought on. 

I'm parent were, I'd much consider vaccinating kids 10 (or u14) flu, riskless illness.

Surely Pfizer available u12s, make sense vaccinate forget Covid fears anyway, power last winter. Well like CDC said, vaccine works vaccine.  Lol. strain US since early mid April, far failed make dent overall case count. Honestly, many people vaccinated, Covid already ravaged country, flat running hosts infect, regardless variant. Asymptomatic transmission, happens all, rare. Wuhan, study 10 million people found ZERO cases asymptomatic transmission. nobody vaccinated.

(Note cover PRE-symptomatic transmission, however, indistinguishable late) Maybe US - elsewhere isn’t discussion going AZ pity

You what? Sorry hear sound deafening hypocrisy. Cuz that's words amount to, considering UK's behaviour towards EU regarding AZ doses. Don’t gaslight. shared incorrect opinion CDC thinks vaccines “do literally nothing” stop spread COVID. admitted you’ve curiosity since January.

Maybe stop jerk spreading misinformation could dissuade people getting vaccinated. Personally, plan live life entirely normal I'm vaxed let community exposure keep immune system date. Since virus going eradicated, going default status basically everybody anyway, I'm going go way avoid exposure. likely imo although enough evidence say sure j understand confidence coming from. We're even year past finishing clinical trials. know immunity remain long term current strains let alone future strains.

The reason suspect may become endemic there's still significant anti-vax sentiment unfortunately. people get vaccines remain potential hosts virus replicate, mutate spread. would postulate likely mutate forms current vaccines innefective against.

FWIW, hope right I'm wrong literally point saying sure either way know more.  statistic covid deniers used say problem bad.

Yep, literally identical calculation point I'm annoyed moderators sub continue allow claiming allow ""not high quality information"" sub. Unless entire household pledges avoid *any* news source all, going able keep politics it.

That's new thing; vividly remember hearing Iran-Contra Scandal evening news kid. large majority people get first dose Moderna/Pfizer return second US, small percentage population taken J&amp;J. Yus! Good deal! I've relieved ever since got mine back March. Sure, I'm saying UK response perfect, take issue idea UK NZ similar islands. UK's infrastructure relies heavily lorries boarding RoRo ferries sailing uninterrupted taken tour COVID capitals Europe. NZ equivalent. ""These symptoms reported among COVID-19 – lingering collection symptoms become known “Long Covid.” However, current exhaustion reported among individuals never COVID-19.""



Thanks media induced PTSD. current consensus leaky gut? get wrong good diet great think something generally accepted. intent convey major delta existence always on, always devices imbued billions dollars worth research ""user engagement"", agree.

Humans problems, there's lots humans lots problems. That's nothing new, holy hell dopamine cycle modern smart phone paired latest apps just... wow. break you.   So, early days, evidence starting come in, CDC used words “can” “may”. scientist should. interpreted “the vaccines literally nothing”. 

Fuck, need better educational system country. use them. could ask UK question sharing vaccine doses poorer countries delivery that's even met yet. Yes, could. EU would simply give patents producers. Sucks AZ, that’s life.

Yeah, that's works all. 19 189 tested positive testing positive antibodies. Viral loads 10x less without previous infection. asymptomatic mild.

~19 people asymptomatic (it didn’t say many) proves test positive it. don’t doubt people study much smarter would argue tiny viral load without symptoms immune system working should. Especially since there’s chance virus body testing positive symptoms.

I’m always wary studies like catch symptomatic people testing regularly (every 2 weeks case) would never caught cases normally people don’t go take test every 2 weeks. similar baseball team outbreak vaccination recently. Easier distribute administer due less strict storage requirement. Also potentially easier make due much smaller mRNA dosage. concern sparked. Valid points, 2nd article also states flu deaths nearly accurate likely far underestimated compared Covid since testing universal new virus scantly used flu. 

Out curiosity, hypothetically CDC NIH reverse course say masks necessary schools would inclined let back school unvaccinated? thought entire country got 50% fully vaxed milestone actually think low positive % because, well get tested fully vaxxed? scaring yourself. Relax. fine. None things. constantly warm, understand it. wife fully vaccinated today! Two weeks since second dose! surprising. Asymptomatic different presymptomatic. 

Think viral load filling glass water.

Let's say body ""x"" amount Covid-19 viral load. miniscule enough get sick. become infectious. almost impossible spread viral load. (Think touching door handle someone cold, never catching cold.)

Let's say brief encounter someone sick get ""y"" amount viral load. 

The viral load high enough become **infected sick**. time takes infection showing signs symptoms **2-4 days** maybe. span **2-4 days**, infect dozens people close you. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem way determine whether someone asymptomatic simply pre-symptomatic takes several days show signs illness. Someone aymptomatic never show signs illness. second problem many people, signs illness mild small, notice sick. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's confusion makes useful general conversation make distinction. Fully vaccinated. Attending house parties, going out, hanging friends, pretending like life normal. 

For past year, I’ve lived life cocoon due familial situation radicalized views covid. since everyone vaccinated, I’m able take decisions able whatever want. I’m done letting covid get way. Mine considered essential, office, especially since moved new one last year. I'm hybrid model I'm 3 days home 2 days. Like UK limited 40 mean influenza undergo antigenic shift causes low vaccine effectiveness; well combined OAS. people family got mild symptoms vaccinated. tested got positive one help you, know. Anxiety fear nasty bitches. would say good candidate getting vaccinated. know shot painless side effects basically nothing, understand anxiety. cannot lash vaccine center. cannot tolerated. Mask up, wash hands, keep distance, hope reach herd immunity. elements influenza virus mutate much? may essential parts mutate much cocktail, may need change much?  Fantastic news. Glad see vaccine making visible changes normalcy. miracle modern science blows mind. Oh yeah course, there's much need now, since able use younger age groups.  brought wrong Texas Florida total miss. 

That prediction based 10-20% herd immunity theory... cdcs best move right shut up. drop protocols/recommendations CDC said would count breakthrough vaccinated cases anymore unless resulted hospitalization. moving forward, direct comparison using case numbers. heard anything different testing standards, since put advisory Jan 2021, possible labs reduced cycles. 

And also respond person below, article links Fauci stated anything 37 cycles high chance false positives article states US using 40 cycles regularly. seen reported elsewhere (the main report NYT paywalled). understanding it’s actually quite common. tested positive month initial infection true several people know. understanding test picks dead viruses pieces virus body takes long time completely expel. Based explanation, would seem rule rather exception people test positive infection ends PCR tests.

No, means never send school getting flu vaccine. position fundamentally inconsistent (though I'm way saying people, especially parents, consistent).

Your argument also logical fallacy accept risk accept double risk consistent. accept risk, consistent must accept half risk. Flu COVID risks add together, completely consistent someone might think risking one okay rethink risk both. glad Mexico got millions doses us. need help Argentina Brazil doses. want Americas clean covid possible time fall hits. fully vaccinated, exposed virus last week unvaccinated friend (that friend rethinking stance vaccination now). got first test back it’s negative!! going keep monitoring safe, far good.

What conspiracy regarding vaccines? who""s benefiting, ends blame?

What vaccine conspiracy? vaccines already given elderly, death toll third wave Ontario would crazy, fortunately wasn't, yes essential working class taken worst it. 

Overall hesitancy lower Canada vs US see experiment plays coming months years. Sooooo ""debunked"" information first place? 

Who fuck authority determine something misinformation not? 

Clearly right people. don’t know. It’s dropping fast. seems like last days straight, every time check Sweden global case rate chart CDC website 14-day rate like 100 cases/100000 people. Maybe isn’t dramatic, it’s pretty close! much meaningless complaining complaining?

Bruh  sent raw materials month ago actually problem. far tell, none conditions listed impact immune system, concerned that, appropriate thing would contact doctor. 

However, absence immune issues, indicators strongly point fully vaccinated persons able resume life without concern. natural experience anxiety given we've gone through, personal health, sudden change all. Reach supportive knowledgeable people necessary. Feel free DM I'd happy investigate anything further. 

Take care, sounds like going good time birthday party :) don’t disagree look actual hospitalization rate vaccinated people vs unvaccinated. It’s different. basically haven’t wave vaccinated people involved yet. tail end wave rolled vaccine. 

I think there’s plenty reason believe fall winter drastically different. Lots cases, lot damage. Yes is. Several papers topic. need make sure conflating Asymptomatic Presymptomatic. Presymptomatic spread absolutely significant driver. Unfortunately, lot people (even researchers) use two terms interchangeably, mistake imo. Asymptomatic mean never develop symptoms point. 

I'll give references. Study Wuahn 10,000,000 people. single case asymptomatic transmission Washington Florida study it. Secondary household attack rates, would highest chance transmission, show asymptomatic presymptomatic combined transmission waaaaay lower (18.0% vs 0.7%, 25.7 times less likely) symptomatic. even vaccinated individuals. again, 0.7% asymptomatic presymptomatic TOGETHER. means purely asymptomatic transmission even lower C'mon ... word coronavirus existed years.

Yeah agree. good thing people let know going could go arrest It'd really nice someone could figure true cause long-term effects could know degree vaccine prevents them.

By far scariest thing virus (from perspective, anyway) people mild cases still end organ failure blood clots later on. Like said that's works. I'm fine, dont head sand. Translation: Pfizer, supplier delivered lot regularly recent weeks months, less good news today: although company would double deliveries next week, company may able fully fulfill promise. extra deliveries suddenly become uncertain again. “Of 733,000 vaccines Pfizer would deliver coming weeks (compared 364,000 per week far, ed.), part 153,000 vaccines yet confirmed,” Taskforce said.

That said, I'm thinking matter either way, (massive generalization warning) wearing masks anyway change behavior, gotten vaccinated. seems noteworthy reactionaries spent lot energy encouraging followers run people like, made several attempts enshrine practice law.

I'm starting think people looking forward proverbial party forever scared ever take part. People still masked 99% time go store think that's going change dime mandates fully rescinded. **Asking providing medical advice allowed - includes speculating dosages, supplements, active ingredients.** cannot responsible health. need general information, please refer CDC's website need specific medical advice, please contact qualified medical professional area.

Especially chart hospitalized shows drastic 40% drop last month. portends lower death numbers future.  idea I'm epidemiologist statistician.

All know got Moderna shots, work amazingly well, I'm going crowded bar right I'm worried either (I would got Costco without mask everyone else one ""nobody wears mask"" Florida) want win million dollars, disclose status vaccinated, opt win million. That's fine. free choice manner.

That change point, is: coercing people reveal personal health information publicly creepy normalizing it. Good point. many varaibles get good idea going on. Maybe month things clear. Political show. Nothing, I'm going Trump rules. Wait, guy asked covid farts?  Another batshit crazy moron, know better everyone else failed running lives. drive house bulldozer yelling:

""No Jesus!""

And see feels. Official mouthpiece Trump GOP like consequences actions. Awww, pobrecita. So... zombies? possible increased spacing doses could similar effect? kids. I'm 33 struggle now. optimism future. reason get bed morning love parents need me. pass, quote Teddy Roosevelt, ""All light gone life.""

There optimism world. That's bullshit. What's even point getting covid shot get sticker? wonder there's blackmarket ""I got vaccinated"" stickers like record cards.  worst hurricane season past 20 years 2005 Katrina. entire season 7 US landfalls resulted 1,518 deaths.

sometimes people use word targeted instead amplified they're really get vaccinated. See risk vaccines way risk getting hit car. /s believe we're saying exact thing. original process, point, voluntary understand it. pull name voter records look whether they're vaccinated--there nothing original pitch asking you. get vaccinated, yes. think know “Dave” also. censorship bad idea.

Facebook, Twitter, Reddit etc deciding people can’t talk about.

They qualifications steer society whatever direction choose.

This bad bad bad idea…

(I’m conservative)  Funny Emilia Strong doesn’t see money used respond ongoing crisis. Getting people vaccinated far effective buying ventilators, etc. 

Also state would pay vaccine awareness ways like paid advertising, etc. much effective usage dollars IMO. friends, seven. max 4 persons per table restaurants.
(It 8 lowered 4 wave 2).

I mean point still stands. personal definition lockdown legally binding measures designed stop society beyond essential activities narrowly defined minimum activities keep society running.

The international press really released misleading stories ""lockdown"" Sweden autumn. distinctly remember walking quiet open restaurants phone Mom asked new ""lockdown"" Sweden heard CNN. surreal. Judging comment there's probably segment population believes Sweden locked even though true think probable. people think reading CNN articles, CNN make profit headline? latter demographic really trying target?

I’m denying saying true, asking think REAL motivation behind article. said, ***""all lives matter!""*** /s mean that's circlejerks work. even remotely ""purely"" political post. tangentially political. removal comment error. Please restore comment. ""Hey, lady, can't run people disagree using car. Florida.""  Hey get I'm fully vaccinated flair? 73% one called WBIP-CorV BBIBP-CorV I've noticed crap lot lately. Lying happened makes points look weak get wanting read article, trick make definitive statements get caught smh.

Stop giving away secrets, man. everyone able make well-informed statements without called out. 

Next going tell secret researching citing statements actually make coherent response support point view.

You're killing low hanging fruit response portion makes reddit cheeky irresponsible. vaccinate punishment forgive student loans make tertiary education free...should people able turn remaining cash scholarships actual dollars?

I'm asking cuz genuinely know interesting problem think about. Ok articles need cut shit. We're vaccinated. get fuck back normal society? Please? Stop fear mongering us. encouraging people get vaccinated get back normal. bullshit articles opposite even worse media entity butchers scientist health professionals message. know group susceptible bad information also going impacted headline-driven messaging. 

In fact, strength duration naturally acquired immunity recovered patients gave us confidence staying power robust, vaccine-induced immunity. least, that's perception based reading information published NIH. 

At moment moment know long either lasts refrain hard stances thereof. disagree current studies/research shows vaccine induced immunity gives robust response?

The current studies/research indicate vaccine-induced immunity works much better known emerging variants looking antibodies. 

However, looking T-cell responses, hard say. light, responses seem indicate staying power variants cases.

So think would say, naturally acquired immunity provides protection, sake optimizing defense, previous infection not, two shot series current mRNA vaccine remains optimal decision. 

Even probably oversimplifying somewhat. several immune system components play here. I'm saying careful messaging stick accurate assessment whole. 

I want mislead, either, all. Trying manipulate messaging convince anti-vaxx folks ignores fact they're willing rationalize anything find, distorted messaging convince them, confuses rest us.  vaccinated asymptomatic, current CDC advice monitor symptoms hold testing.

I 8 days cdc data compare week’s first dose shots last week used NJ dashboard data top (which tends little lower CDC data). Moving forward I’ll least 8 days worth first dose shots start comparing week week using cdc data changes 7 day average changes demand due issues data. data someone wants see different formatting shoot message. Oh no. people ask around stuff like this? Browsing board, lot people, literally make heavy handed comments feel people. least since maybe mid March obvious established path end. mind 5G, vax also installed Candy Crush. Calm bro. state's dashboard terrible, I'd use that! Last time robbed shit all. went talked neighbors course another neighbor. Told cops like 3 days fact. Know did? Walked guys house told said it. course buy illegal firearms protect cause wanted kill us. 45 carson fox disease   Oh, totally incredible number! like root number go every day. Every bit ticks means closer normal (kids mask, going back work without masks, etc.). rationally know can't go forever, cool watch fall every day. I’d like know lives works, bc want avoid place. She’s ticking timebomb hurt people eventually.  that’s reason vaccinating. Sure! 
There nothing preventing store discriminating class people legally protected. 
They can’t turn away person Asian example, could deny service someone wearing mask choose. similar long term effects flu common cold. People definitely this, narrative inflating many ton. 

There absolutely, 100%, bet life die hill, WAY people lazy need incentive get vaccinated. kind stuff works people. door door. Anything increase convenience. 

They're lying go places without mask - going PERIOD, ones probably even care wearing mask anyway. 

Most people coming weird complex strategies evade health guidance.

People boring uninteresting large. Nope desanasswhole helm. Member God's waiting room side effect Israel concerned about—myocarditis—is autoimmune response associated (in people) immune response vaccine whole. possible (perhaps probable) stronger immune response would also results stronger autoimmune response, means worse myocarditis.  Basically none. Don’t even bother masks either. You’ll fine without. Murica reaaaaly needs deal mental health issues 🙄 really weird seeing people longer wear masks. GF face timed show rug mask almost said something, though fully vaccinated totally legal.

Going take time adjust back lol. person ever facetimes stores mother, thanks chemo pancreatic cancer (she's one caught spead started impact anything, thank god sports hernia), wearing masks still reason people wore masks pandemic. Yup, it’s definitely possible, might harder/less likely. unmasked masked see, that’ll quickly plummet. comfort based ignorance stupidity. science clear, reason non immunocompromised person wear mask vaccination. mask means trust vaccine. don't, take it? could still lie employee. It’s hard duplicate vaccination card, claim lost it, etc.. businesses going fire employees bother hiring new person, especially harm “low.” (Sucks breakthrough Covid case unvaccinated liar.)  $275,000 cash award also included grand prize winner.    gets Xbox X Series finally, Microsoft go ahead chip me, lol. ain’t like I’m already tracked phone, car, tablet, laptop, &amp; Alexa devices yell ‘America’… hit Accelerator? long wait PcR test encounter one covid? 
Today counter lady lab told me, new variants best wait 10 days. can't find information backing claim; guys know anything It? Yupppppp...critical thinking skills lack skepticism, got it. Lmao crying mugshot? Life prison solution! LIFE! LIFE! hell need get stuff proven right way beyond me. really think antimisinformedbullshiters give crap. Oh wait right something nothing like 45 you? Envy world folks locked country, vaccinations doubt taking next year time rest world living some
Normality poor sods get locked down. judge antivaxxer? customer, might able employee. LMAO  Public health measures account everyone, including lazy and/or stupid. Ah see! EU, emergency approvals without data, absurd situation could approve astra older people switched older people day. could avoided would done study correctly. understand hesitant vaccinate older people isn’t study phase 3 beyond safety concerns measure efficacy? Won’t issue, European countries give mRNA vaccine second shot AZ.  got mine community pop-up, made appointments family CVS drove there, gave coupons thank gift. got much discount fancy chapstick. Yeah get CDC, all, trying push narrative Masks used unless really really bad.

If want businesses open, reduce distancing requirement, masks best tool regressing. 

Doesn't make sense all.  So, fully vaccinated, mRNA vaccines, much risk room someone unvaccinated? (vaccinated) wear 2 doctor 3ply masks (not vaccinated) wear mask. anything count total cases. positive test result positive test result. They're trying track positive test results vaccinated people. post total positive test results, affected change. news actually good, case numbers plummeting! Likewise, positive test percentage, deaths, hospitalizations, metrics moving downward. illusion caused methodology change, real! Fingers crossed! 🤞 r/NotTheOnion  Ding ding ding ding ding! infecting people deadly disease human right either!

I'm saying strip rights. I'm saying opposite, give rights back. Infecting people deadly disease, however, human right. consent invasive medical procedures sensible medical procedures invasive. Checking someone's pulse invasive, inspecting ENT invasive, administering medicine Socratic oath invasive.  yeah, flu mutates around current vaccines. I'm certain hiw dramatically vary though. common factor targeted, like spike protein covid, could chance knocking large number strains. Yeah, saw that. Crazy! even legal?  people lie say they’ve vaccinated ditch mask anyways.   Sounds like people ran car, banged window, told it, like 'No way guys that's crazy. better call one media' horrific logic; decline B.1.1.7 cases prove anything B.1.617.2.

/u/keagus, UK study showed dramatically lower vaccine effectiveness variant one dose, two doses mRNA vaccines still incredibly effective (they J&amp;J UK data there). ""Back square one"" connected reality. problem B.1.617.2 likely (though unproven) contagious, meaning need population get vaccinated stop unvaccinated catching it.

There eventually variants require booster shots, put us anywhere near ""square one"". ability make new booster shots overnight now. It’s crazy awful antivaxers look get arrested stupid shit. Yeah offered 2 grand, pfft put money mouth old man.  I'm diabetic, made fine. People like act death sentence Covid, not.

Plenty people without underlying conditions died too. Gurus India long tradition hucksters. British colonization tricks came out, like one pretend levitate using cane hidden seat covered robes. Ok I'm mid-TN see stupid shit time well. One old co-workers can't get shots due actual allergy posted FB ""Un-Vaxxed, Un-Masked, Un-afraid"" .. nothing protect already major medical issues. got Covid Pneumonia Yes, measures like masking.

If removed, bad anyone unvaccinated. old ""communism synonym authoritative government"" rodeo, ah yes. vaccine 95% effective, burden going fall *overwhelmingly* unvaccinated.

And things may spread open up! state one best far masking distancing. grateful that. first case US, locked hard, able stop lot spread. it’s said, random procedure saved life, vaccine. don’t really trust nytimes covid act now’s data set. sure pulling numbers I’ve tracking 7 day average using NJ dashboard it’s steadily ticking last month. Rate decrease slowed nominally percent cases fairly steady.

424 (today)  3 weeks enough time first AZ shot. cumulative incidence curve even change 4th week shot. 12+ weeks ideal, seriously doubt matters vaccine get second dose (though trials run them). claim made without evidence becomes plausible time doesn’t mean allow blatant misinformation run wild everywhere.

I wish could trust people take everything carefully consider validity based facts, it’s clear dangerously gullible large portion people be. Best believe, CDC announcement godsend. would take two weeks updated mask mandate us start seeing changes. Cross fingers next two weeks continue look good. It’s best place, obviously.

Why desperate make parents look like bad guys, here? TERRORISM get comment either. basically sticking nose saying ""people known better"".

That get people vaccinated, makes OP feel people. Statistically significant, enough make timeline significantly different. compare breakthrough cases number cases. population.  Ok. btw, comment get downvoted? Lmao going open risk next time.

Not US willing throw bigly amounts money next time, like time. myopic view.

Not everyone health knowledge have. people need motivation directly appeals them. That's public health works, deal populations people different levels healthcare knowledge motivations.

Your response helpful get people vaccinated frank, sorta patting back. Almost everywhere instructed dig anyone's story. might need either signature adult present, would quite easy get vaccinated little research. Ah good ole like either mentality splash attempted vehicular manslaughter. Classic. Yes, odd.

Well I'm bothering then. still get 5G though, right?  aware argument. contradictory, addressed anything I've mentioned. wanted contradiction, I'd talk 4 year old Please sterilize human waste. Definitely good idea. unfortunately years flu shot likely one less effective ones since don’t good data make educated guesses strains include vaccine. morons keep breeding... point then? wish become one bluetooth. mask working? Logically stop pollen way stops covid rite? still allergic reactions even mask outside.

Well pollens viruses know, made sense company said 100% terminate anyone lies.

They requiring vaccine, lie say haven't, they'll fire it. I'm sure company that. That's argument. never giving money away, marketing advertisement. Look much people talking Ohio doing.

One terms using ""monkey"" Kirill Dmitriev . 
The message campaign extremely direct - photos showed chimpanzee wearing lab coat, monkeys coming AstraZeneca tent, even photo British Prime Minister Boris Johnson head chimpanzee. 
After Times article, action condemned authorities University Oxford, director AstraZeneca Pascal Soriot, scientists politicians. Russia went stiff : “The suggestion Russian state may carrying propaganda AstraZeneca vaccine example disinformation. is, course, discredit Russia's efforts fight pandemic, including good cooperation established Great Britain area, ”a spokesman British Embassy UK told reporters. 
Who North Korean hackers sell data to? 
The tension grew closer vaccines entered market (this story European market). December key - end month AstraZeneca approved use UK announced would apply EU registration. known preparations Pfizer Moderna would approved earlier, vaccines beginning quite expensive difficult store (requirement low temperatures). much cheaper AZ Sputnik V vector vaccines better chance mass influencing market. Scientists worked fast possible. 
Another disturbing piece news appeared media December 2: ""North Korean hackers attacked least six pharmaceutical companies US, UK South Korea dealing Covid-19 vaccines,"" reported Wall Street Journal . - “The regime looking confidential information sell use. (...) North Korea also tried infiltrate British company AstraZeneca PLC. (...) "" 
Hackers attacking since August, presumably hunting data sell. know stole anything sold data someone whom. known, however, North Korean regime maintains friendly relations Kremlin. second half 2020, attacks took place, period scientists received data results clinical trials preparations. 
Putin's satisfaction 
At time, action thickens. December 11, media reported AstraZeneca decided officially cooperate Russians - testing whether combination Astra Zeneca Russian Sputnik V would increase effectiveness. trial program, later turns British tested various preparations way, fact cooperation important reported President Russia, Vladimir Putin . First annual international conference, December 21 special videoconference attended himself, Russian heroes Pascal Soriot, director AstraZeneca. Everyone happy agreement, Soriot fondly recalled earlier meeting Kremlin, one half years ago. 
Between first second conference, Germany came fore again. December 18, Health Minister Jens Spahn informed Russian counterpart: ""Germany ready cooperate Russia production Russian vaccines coronavirus."" Russia replied : ""In near future, Russian German experts conduct working talks try find production facilities joint production Russian vaccines."" 
Vladimir Putin's satisfaction December 21 conference clear. future seemed clear: Sputnik V conquer European Union, Germany produce it, British started official cooperation. Russian vaccine becoming real vehicle building political influence forces Europe look favorably eastern power. 
Russia celebrates cooperation, network silent 
It satisfaction caused campaign discredit AstraZeneca social media suddenly stop. According research social media conducted Alliance Securing Democracy (analysis tweets vaccines state diplomatic accounts Russia, China Iran, period November 9, 2020 - February 9, 2021), Russian narrative AstraZeneca "" clear twist following announcement December agreement test Oxford-AstraZeneca Sputnik V vaccine combinations. increase positive coverage decrease negative coverage AstraZeneca Russian diplomatic state media. "" 
And further: “The state media diplomatic communications Oxford-AstraZeneca revealed true symbiosis Russia's interests messages Russian state media related accounts. (...) October 2020, British vaccine seen main competitor Russian Sputnik V. "" 
The official partnership Russia brought immediate change. ""The number tweets mentioning AstraZeneca vaccine increased (...) significant number celebrated partnership, advertising prime example Russia's non-political approach global health."" 
And suddenly something went wrong. story second season series. Coming soon OKO.press. Russian ""prodigy""

 
The second hero, 42-year-old Alexei Repik, called child prodigy Russia. born Moscow, also studied, age 16 began studies, paying thanks job low position city hospital. dealt procurement distribution drugs. 2001, age 20, founded company, R-Pharm. Today one largest Russian pharmaceutical companies, thanks to, among things, state contracts supply Western drugs. 


 
Repik currently billionaire, wife (a famous model fashion blogger Polina Repik) three children live United States. oligarch permanent contacts Kremlin, including 18 official meetings President Putin. performs several functions Russian chambers advisory bodies. appointed Board Directors Federal Corporation Development Small Medium-sized Enterprises Prime Minister Medvedev, since 2016 member Council Strategic Development National Projects President Russian Federation, public Ombudsman Entrepreneurs appointed President Russia. March 20, 2020, Putin awarded order ""For Merit Fatherland"". 


 
It happens oligarch also interested American prosecutor Robert Mueller - Repik one six Russians present Donald Trump's inaugural ball January 2017. Apart him, Russian lobbyists whose links Trump campaign proven investigation, lawyer Natalia Weselnicka, accused 2019 US prosecutor 's office ""conspiratorially conspiring high-ranking Russian prosecutor provide false information US judiciary influence proceedings."" 


 
The two heroes American Russiangate, close contacts President Putin, today main persons responsible production sale Russian Sputnik V vaccine. Although always foreground, must remembered shadows. 


&amp;#x200B;

 
Cooperation competitors ... 
In vaccine race, Western companies could count contracts EU sell vaccines, Russians. known long time entering European market difficult. However, assumed Putin wanted much - would proof strength state, Europe's dependence Russia, expansion cooperation EU states, recovery economic political isolation. 


 
Rationally, however, vaccine race underway, Sputnik V would chance conquer Europe Europe option. competition failed. could work her.

 
In September 2020, Sputnik V registered Russia, media reported Russian R-Pharm preparing produce AstraZeneka - Russia, factory Germany. move main action place. 


 
R-Pharm Germany subsidiary Russian R-Pharm Alexei Repik - small pharmaceutical plant Bavarian city Illertissen. Repik bought 2014 Pfizer, 2018 Pfizer's contracts carried there, deal market own. vaccine production capacity therefore dropped top plant - R-Pharm announced invest EUR 20 million plant, thanks this, first quarter 2021 possible produce 500 million doses AstraZeneca vaccines annually. 


 
""Monkey vaccine"" 
Everything seemed beautifully arranged. mid-October another British news came - journalists Times identified Russian disinformation campaign aimed spreading fear AstraZeneca vaccine (which still clinical trial stage time). 


 
""Photos, memes video clips depicting vaccine made UK dangerous originated Russia, intermediaries trying to"" spread ""the material social networks around world,"" wrote Times. “The main motive vaccine, millions doses produced pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, could turn humans monkeys uses chimpanzee virus vector. campaign aimed countries Russia wants sell Sputnik V vaccine, well Western countries.

Yes, brought Russia behind black PR AstraZeneca vaccine? indicated numerous circumstantial evidence analyzes activity sources network (though hard evidence). main site Russian action probably Germany. fight influence European Union money EU market took place. 


 
In Poland, well countries, many people want vaccinate preparation British company AstraZeneca. recently reported Gazeta Wyborcza , 3.5 million doses AZ already reached Poland, another million waiting volunteers, vaccination centers order less less, patients want take them. 


 
They concerned serious side effects, especially blood clots. also doubts whether preparation effective all. Despite careful checking safety preparation assurances World Health Organization European Medicines Agency, distrust towards AstraZeneka huge. 


 
There doubt - result months information chaos preparation, decisions several countries suspend vaccination (decisions later withdrawn) disinformation conducted network. 


 
Where chaos come from? behind him, real situation experienced hard way? two texts this. 


 
The first one reading reconstructs events massive vaccination campaign began. story Russian disinformation, hackers attacking British laboratory, young oligarchs behind Russian Sputnik V vaccine, competes AstraZeneka, involvement Vladimir Putin himself. 


 
The second part - publish soon - picture great international clashes vaccine market - influence, power money. caused us, ordinary people, strong fear AstraZeneca? need for? really now? 


 
ASTRAZENECA DOWN. 


 
It's almost like series - medical-political thriller written episodes numerous twists, highest stakes saving humanity virus, hand - gaining power money. Events took place top government, among influential politicians businessmen, scientists journalists. 


 
The first season series ended December 2020 spectacular conference President Vladimir Putin head AstraZeneca, Pascal Soriot. spectacular actions kept season two, started 2021. Everything like series - really happened. 


 


 
Season One: Russians Monkey Injection 
It's summer 2020. whole world fighting coronavirus pandemic. Scientists dozens laboratories looking effective vaccine COVID-19. Great Britain, preparation developed scientists University Oxford seems promising. 


 
In Russia, experts state-owned Gamalei Institute working vaccine. preparation based similar technology British preparation - so-called vector vaccines. race time - health people decimated virus, also taking best starting position: first, offer effective, cheap, easy-to-store preparation guarantee income large part international market.

 
The scientists' work kept secret. Suddenly scandal breaks out. July 16, British authorities report: Russian hackers tried steal data. British National Cyber ​​Security Center announcement shows well-known Russian hacker group APT29 (aka ""Cozy Bear""), long classified services various countries related Russian intelligence services, attacked entities involved development COVID vaccine throughout 2020. 19 world, incl. Canada, United States United Kingdom, ""most likely intent steal information intellectual property related development testing COVID-19 vaccines."" 


 
The NCSC informed British Prime Minister evidence Kremlin behind attempted data theft, Russian president Vladimir Putin know attacks. goal UK two centers Britain: Oxford University Imperial College London. revealed whether attempted data theft successful. 


 
The next day, July 17, Russians responding British accusations. main characters enter stage. First, Kiriłł Dmitriev, president Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), finances work Russian Sputnik V vaccine. - says Reuters agency Dmitriev. - “There's nothing steal. Everything handed Russia. "" 


 
The second hero, usually shadows, owner Russian pharmaceutical concern R-Pharm, Alexey Repik. confirms July 17, company signed contract Dmitriev talks about. Interestingly, British company AstraZeneca declined comment. silent.

Young Russian oligarch ties Trump 
Let's take look heroes. new Russian oligarchs, 40-year-old generation, well-versed Western world. Kirill Dmitriev, 46, husband Natalia Popova, close friend Vladimir Putin's daughter, Katerina Tikhonova. frequent direct contacts Putin. born Kiev, age 14, parents sent California. studied Stanford University, Harvard Business School. worked largest American banks consulting companies (Goldman Sachs, McKinsey &amp; Company). Since 2011, managing Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), established Russian government. 


 
However, reported New York Times , November 2016, Dmitriev involved something economic investment. presidential campaign US, began looking contact someone Donald Trump's close circle. meetings Trump's staff members made Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller interested Dmitriev 2019 Russiangate investigation Kremlin's influence Trump campaign.

 
We know report Dmitriev managed get touch Rick Gerson, friend Jared Kushner, D. Trump's son-in-law. Together, work ""reconciliation plan"" Russia US (on Putin's orders). document sent Trump's trusted people: Jared Kushner, Rex W. Tillerson (US Secretary State 2017-2018) Steve Bannon (head election campaign, later Trump's advisor).

[The CDC, tries get actual date death states place backlogged deaths occurred, they're reported, they're showing deaths declined 674 per day mid April 437 now. bad ass would Governor like ""fuck it, 18 get vax, get free college""  question pretty useless. everyone prefectly aware surroundings times, especially place super chill routine. sad long time always supportive warnings. Almost everything new dangerous strains news last months ridiculous fear mongering though, hard take seriously anymore.  move around places life cheap? I’m there. anything I’ve learned this, it’s don’t take little things life granted. Pfizer mandates indemnity potential issue occurring India.

Now, India many vaccine manufacturers given exception.

If bow Pfizer 's whims, set bad precedent industry going forward. don't, people need wait longer getting vaccinated.

It's Pfizer dying help India India refusing help. No. read research MRNA vaccines aren’t effected this. need band aid longer like 15-30 minutes anyway. prevent drop blood getting clothes something. crazy, everything saying true regards health cheap food. Personally think best thing could put cooking lessons back high school. I'm foodie son celiac cook home almost time. steak potatoes home less McDonald's, healthier. know cook home cooking tastes terrible, aingle parents working two jobs exactly time cook let alone teach kids. 

And would still need vaccines get this. Look Europe, diabetes rates much lower, better diet less obesity still major issues. Yes higher percentage older people, consistent, older people volnerable. Brazil younger population, little obesity little social measures disaster too. 

So yes healthier population would saved lives, distancing masks save lives, vaccines might let us go back something like normal. everything like communism/socialism. wether actually isnt communism/socialism. already know half population slow babies. might need lotteries every state now. Nah. type mouth breathers wasn’t getting vaccine “nothing them” type would inclined see big $1m number go “that could me!”

You’re using reason lottery isn’t designed people like you. Idk, guys see people gathered Alabama title Buccaneers super bowl? category 5 hurricane recklessness day now!! Love seeing types idiots crying mugshots.  sure, took institute vaccines Paul Ehrlich institute, update data regularly. site probably English version too. 6.789.168 Erstdosen plus 202.796 Zweitdosen von Vaxzevria (ehemals: COVID-19-Impfstoff AstraZeneca)

This means gave 6.8 mio first doses 0.2 mio second doses currently. Bis zum 10.05.2021 (Montag, 21:00 Uhr) wurden dem Paul-Ehrlich-Institut 77 Fälle einer TTS nach Impfung mit dem COVID-19- Impfstoff Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) gemeldet.

this means 77 cases thromboses thrombocytopenia 10th March. currently stand 1 90.000, plus ones yet communicated.  Deputy Kevin Snider said saw SUV ""traveling high rate speed closed cone course enclosed tent"" ""exit tent continue drive recklessly cone dozen people working inside tent, Deputy Snider said several ran patrol car told SUV almost hit several people tent. 

Seems like people say anything, would let go. seem like saw anything inside tent even CDC says protection lasts least 3 months yet study claiming 19 people reinfected within 6 weeks??

It's not. misunderstanding study conducted.

Marine recruits come in. get antibody tests 3 COVID-19 tests 2 week quarantine. Test positive COVID-19 one 3 tests? eliminated study. take care concerns true re-infections without genome sequence. Seems exceedingly unlikely 3 straight negative tests suddenly come back positive previous infection.

The antibody tests could infection earlier [N=-2 weeks]. Could 3 week earlier, could 3 6 months earlier. guess passes Family Guy skin tone test. got vaccinated NYU Langone hospital months ago. even sticker. asked one nothing. PSA anyone thinks it:

The FDA approved cell test experts believe reliable indicator past infection antibody tests, antibodies fade much faster B cells. *maybe* sick year ago, antibody test could negative cell positive.

The bad news currently pay pocket it. People 50 may less likely die Covid still suffer term symptoms (Long Covid) serious. infection seriously flared up, India even see babies dying Covid. I'll see seven months raise eight parked outside tent, driver, unlike others, drove cone outline, tent, longer visible, exited tent, running ignore cones.

People inside tent told trajectory tent, saw enough suspicious already. witness statements inside tent, clearly endangered lives others. Drug company wants make money. Seems like market drying up, would hurry? obtuse purpose?

Serious illness vaccine nearly unheard of. infection. Cases dropped 40% Stockholm last week. going quite quickly country. Also, it’s like many rules (for individuals) followed anyway. Yep. picked stupid hill die on. scared. perspective, evil plan billionaires/whatever poison people come fruition, *working*.

Study Marine Recruits Reveals Imperfect Immunity Effects COVID-19 
  
 
So go get vaccinated. Don’t put much thought Sykes’ reasoning. It’s team based opposition, actual argument.  virus bad bribing people lotteries, food, beer? sickening understand things like make guys feel like we're midst dystopia. know high levels spread indoor ice hockey. sure sports.

This survey based onBS self reporting coaches every incentive lie. Lol tried go somewhere without mask first time. went gym Indiana (where mask mandate month). Person front desk told put one on. 

Failed experiment, guess.  going standard ""confirmed"" person infection sequenced strain, twice, different strain time. 

Very people done even one infection, much less twice. 

You misleading people trying use lack specific type rare testing evidence lack reinfection.  Delicious tears #delicious Wait, boss, got headline: ""Wacko Antivax Zealot Drives Car Vaccine Tent Attempt Kill People Protest Vaccines"" chortle realize designing vaccines, rare enough side effect come trials either. real-world use brought issue.  *certain headlines* drive vaccinating people

There's idea. Put J&amp;J vaccine blow-dart start sniping people it. LATE, VAXXED! Explain yourself. saying true, yet none justifies hesitation get vaccine, belief kind conspiracy lie it.  But, scientific hand, 6 plates, two bars, three sets dumbbells simultaneously using two machines bench. nothing censorship. You’re allowed editorialize headlines It’s guaranteed positive antibody test equals immunity. don’t know level titer makes someone “safe” quickly degrades individual. reason vaccines good create uniform, measurable response, studied whatever % effective (depending vaccine).

At time, basic understanding humoral immunity moderate infection produces symptoms create *some degree* adaptive immunity (the memory cells tell body fight future). cells harder measure antibodies, we’ve gotten habit using antibody titer surrogate immunity. it’s simple.

You could measure antibodies someone asymptomatic case one month ago, test two months antibodies gone. could test recovered patient find *zero* antibodies much time passed, ton cells hanging bone marrow ready go.

This variability it’s better easy tell everyone get vaxxed. don’t luxury presently individually study person’s present predicted immunity create custom protocol vaccination. we’re racing pandemic. another year would bet protocols change bit. Oil water definitely serve purpose. time Chinese cooking.

But that's kind besides point. point 2 fluids stay separate.  That's terrorism. deranged mind probably favour better run mind-controlled bill gates whatever insane shit people believe. Absolute cretins. get it.... people talk individual right choice people problems vaccinations, abortions, LGBTQ+ rights, etc, etc.

It personal right wear mask decided COVID over.

You cannot ways. screaming gov taking away rights lol Yeah censorship still reigns free it? question anything piece shit. way thinking needs die slow painful death. Yeah, that’s mentioned raises vaccination rates that’ll main positive effect this. right everyone get shot. making arguments people should. yes flow information huge problem, people really hard time ""based know today"" new knowledge comes people see lying before. wait data hiding something. 

Here link talking higher death rates much tbh Yay! People paying attention me! ants mew taints kill us all! zoonotic viruses must extremely lucky cross species barrier, virus ""spilled-over"", virus must extremely lucky develop mutations allow adapt new host species.

This rare suggest. think there's PR win that's worth cost.   Yes serves purpose, oil water repel aren’t useful. meta-analysis Lancet, asymptomatic carriers transmission rate 0-2.2%. That’s pretty low no? Close zero practically. level Wuhan study though. 

That said. Outside controlled conditions medical professionals, average person know asymptomatic. 

That’s asymptomatic carriers “assumed exist”. It’s impossible distinguish people truly infectious pre-symptomatic. gets taken NBC calling protest? PROTEST. terrorism. Nah good. metaphor works same. situation South America currently dire. [If look cases deaths relative population, many countries near all-time even begin factor cases/deaths getting missed due poor testing infrastructure. 

It's bit unclear seasonal virus tropical climate, likely align closely pattern Europe North America. Regardless season, situation night day regards number people vaccinated. many people expecting number cases explode fall winter 2021 countries high vaccination rate, Europe North America then. particles disappear. slowly removed kidneys. Shitty tests pick up. Works same. Pour oil vinegar together separate. Apparently anti vaxxers right man made virus we're silenced year social media. truth come gonna look like fans reds Pete Rose bet them. might. bunch certainly came around states began incentivize million dollar rewards fast food coupons. guess freedom price, knew Freedom Fries? terrorist atrack? still people sub think contracting covid immunization strategy. acknowledge lingering complications moderate mild covid cases later cause issues, including death. I'm college student assure remote learning make sleep Yo actually sick. raise red flags guys?  Yes it’s sarcasm lol Everyone mask lockdown get 150% drops. It’s way *sure* we’ve beaten thing. Safety first! weeks.  Yeah....

You're full it, mate. Negative PCR tests used place exit conditions quarantine/isolation.

If people always positive months after, would case hotels filled Australia NZ people can't test negative.

I think getting confused between: ""Some people test positive weeks"" ""Everyone tests positive weeks."" person mental illness likely fall prey type brainwashing created anti covid vaccine movement...

A much bigger problem mental illness poor/no education. issue younger. left home, joined military, talked worldly people, lived parts world got better education, found easier see bullshit like antivax.  live here, I'm fully vaccinated, I'm fine. Chill hell bro. people wanna get vaxxed fuck lives up, them. Stop letting put weight shoulders. proud state. Yep, unacceptable, we're def going hit next peak variants, need eradicate covid entirely happens. Time mask up, hunker down, close borders, change behaviours vaccinated!  don’t think you’re cautious. would good idea give neurologist call, though, see conditions could hinder immune system all. Dysautonomia affects people differently, depends type autonomic functions impacted relates immune system. get best possible information specialist, decide level risk comfortable you. I'm Philly, too. agree. Sheetz blows Wawa away. Royal Farms does, too.  lots plausible reasons. SARS effective biological agent kills quickly easy control. may looking something effective. 

Or may looking something benign could use track infection rates inadvertently created virus small death rate. 

There little evidence man made. problem good evidence alternative source ... isn’t. man made gets back table. wife worked skilled nursing facility covid unit. got vaccine almost two months earlier coworkers moonlighted medical clinic got earlier. never got two rest coworkers unit tested positive. got mine part Pfizer Phase III trial despite go jails, prisons courthouses regularly never got sick. works. guess ""multiple"" means ""twice?"" 
You know get covid vaccination also right? point immunity makes much less likely, less severe do. true vaccine virus induced immunity. It’s never good sign 4 names.  

Seize phone/computer. Go thru internet history look anti vax websites viewing fine fuck them. 

I kidding. 50% drop 1 month way low? Can’t tell sarcasm not.  Yup, 0.01% number :( last bit would help families like us greatly. 12 severe asthma prone pneumonia, several relatives teach elementary, fully vaccinated w mRNA (Pfizer/Moderna).

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide HI recovered covid months ago &amp; I'm hard time wrapping head around idea body may exposed ""lab-made"" virus.

The theory SARS-CoV-2 ""lab-made"" gained traction within circles conspiracy theorists.

The prevailing ""lab leak"" theory, countries want investigated virus emerged naturally within bat population studied lab leaked general public. must turk. Hang on, he’s pharmacist? works though? person next wearing seatbelt protect well not? /s Well select random group unvaccinated people rate infection would like 0.1% too. headline pretty misleading Ok answers question, mom dad already recovered covid scared taking vaccine keep reading side effects, news come convinced fine, wanted make sure would need vaccine. able get vaccinated refuse so, sympathy anymore.

I'd say looks like needed pretty damn bad shit creek can't get massive numbers quick enough prevent explosive spread unexposed population 4:20pm day exactly Cool, I'm either way. Still 80 needed, really happy that.

Everyone that... losers grand scheme wow  boy something .. thanks really want go maskless store, get asked put mask, pull uno reverse card aka vaccination card (2 weeks 2nd dose) mean bascically did. 1/3rd 1/2 US population probably infection point.

We basically nothing right, anywhere. Places put restrictions saw high deaths, places put restrictions ruined children.

To honest I'll take deaths stunting future generation entirely. turk believes turkey world, come surprise. never said need them. said places need more. great explanation tbh.

Covid mRNA target spike protein. Covid mRNA essentially makes spike proteins (and proteins) immune system creates antibodies recognise spike proteins.

And mRNA covid vaccines make spike proteins tricks body creating antibodies without risk exposure virus itself.

Also, spike proteins actually prone mutations. mutations spike protein generally lead new viral strains. lay people distinguishing asymtomatic vs presymtomatic.

Can even experts distinguish? small ones majority us support these. enough vaccines get vaccinated, us would rather small inconvenience loss life. saying start. painfully obvious anyone dealt early childhood education development, even slightest (and literally I've gathered grandfather professor early childhood education 30 years, much).

The damage done children last year far outlast anything virus caused people. Missing delaying year development certain age groups absolutely catastrophic later chances success.

Not gets worse across income divide, gaping chasm starting grasp. Kids could afford parent home, could afford good internet, decent computers better couldn't. In-class schooling great equalizer (in theory) threw chance window year ago. Minority disadvantaged students absolutely worse now.

And lastly, beyond education, emotional development peer interaction, especially K-3 group basically life setting. scary acknowledge, _so_ much critical emotional intelligence gained years interactions children, things like empathy compassion, missing like could mean massive problem next 10-15 years reach adulthood.

And boggles mind send kids back fall 2020. risks COVID compared risks children lacking education interaction _extremely_ well established. sat US watched frenzy panic misinformation dictate science.

Now pay price. done Schools shut enough students teachers able present due flu, worried spreading. enough students covid (unlikely, given mild/nonexistent symptoms kids), I'd expect thing happen. week two, like happens (rarely) flu. Good hear! I'm really pessimistic good! really doesn’t. even someone tried sue government, there’s something called “sovereign immunity”, government say “you can’t sue us”, literally can’t sue them.

New South Wales worse case scenario Christmas. virus bypassed hotel quarantine super spreader event. couple days later day 37 new cases.

NSW responded limited lockdown suburbs, reductions group gatherings, dancing singing group events mandatory masks indoor public places public transport (masks previously mandatory anywhere). 4% population Sydney got tested next week. Restaurants remained open (with reduced capacity) life went normal vast majority people.

The outbreak completely eliminated four weeks (the lockdown mask mandate lasted two-ish weeks).

I read Fully vaccinated people * Refrain testing following known exposure, asymptomatic, *with exceptions specific * Refrain quarantine following known exposure asymptomatic

but continue * Get tested experiencing COVID-19 symptoms

source: exceptions involve ""residents employees correctional detention facilities homeless shelters."".

Guideline seems monitor symptoms, test symptomatic -- tests likely fail detect infection immediately exposure. 

Your roommate definitely get tested quarantine/isolate you, though. man!
all got got vaxx back Feb lifesaving protection deadly global virus! Well, look like sharpest lightbulb. Bad bot ages quicker lengthens life span incredible extent.  friends family who've chosen get vaccinated cite ""unknown"" long term side-effects, even though virus observable long-lasting symptoms complications. recommend literature long-term effects virus vs. vaccine? P.s. thanks part solution! feds come people say, ""You reveal medical info general public get million dollars walk away nothing"" gets law suit territory kind coercing people. first Pfizer shot, nurse explained second shot might make feel unwell days, first shot 'primes' immune system.

When mentioned already COVID, said first shot might make feel unwell, immune system already 'primed' virus itself.

Sure enough, symptoms 12 hours first shot, felt pretty lousy 48 hours.

My second appointment coming up, question is, second shot also likely make feel unwell? 

I'd like know advance plan around it. Sorry clear. mean long term effects virus.  LOVING single tear drop mugshot.

I think majority COVID-19 survivors need know  city offers free testing, weekly financial burden. still get tested work every workday. course, make covid tests, it’s free us, essentially Looks like moving uphill state anyway. Thanks update.  [Better info law says ""state local government units.""
- Governor arguing applies state schools
- legal experts disagree
- wind decided court What’s point? No, antibody tests different PCR test. 'do covid' tests look signal comes virus rather looking antibodies. understanding vaccine efficiency generally evaluated based symptomatic disease. specific study also included asymptomatic infections. don’t really understand point remarks. Anti-vaxxers aren’t going get vaccine politician lectured them. Vaccine-hesitant people won’t either. latter group, least survey concerns try reach public health campaigns. misguided could questions cleared actual dialogue. haven’t cold since early 2020. credit masking, obsessive hand washing, and, well, seeing anyone. me! robust vaccination program starts access vaccines/the countries making vaccines letting leave country. 

NZ bought enough 4 vaccines vaccinate everyone twice months ago. supply sent us steady trickle til US UK/Europe etc taken want. we've happy allow happen everyone else needed more, bit maddening rubbed faces now.. wonder antibody test would offer clarity? See body developed vaccine? 94% efficacy number result controlled stufy, 0.01% purely observational. 

For former, calculation would Ve=(Cp-Cv)/Cp Ve=vaccine efficacy, Cp=cases placebo cohort Cv=cases vaccinated cohort. So, taking Modernas data get  (185-11)/185=0.94 94%. Essentially, number factoring negative control population order address factors cannot addressed simple observation disease prevalence non pharmaceutical mitigation efforts like behavior modification. Also notable fact endpoint study symptomatic disease, positive test. 

The latter simply Cv/Pv Cv reported cases vaccinated people Pv number people vaccinated. would 10,262/101,000,000=0.0001 0.01%. endpoint reported cases, could lead overestimating effectiveness vaccinated individuals much less incentive get tested thus probably missing breakthrough cases. 

This disparage vaccines all, truly incredible scientific achievement; told vaccine 95% efficacy would developed deployed year time 2020, would thought ridiculous. However, misleading statistics precisely deniers latching onto minimize gravity pandemic, need better that. know what's going CDC lately, recent cluster**** change guidance masks refusal track critical COVID case data, they're really negligent duties

It seems like decided vaccine ended pandemic. anyone 12+ get fully vaccinated work done here. want get vaccinated, that's you'r problem. want protected are. Kids 12 hardly every die Covid. Life back normal. end.

I agree you. Long haulers Covid related organ damage huge issue (lots people going disability/going bankrupt/unable function/hospitalized/need surgery medical treatment, bad everyone). understanding scientists know whether vaccinated people could get long hauler, based article seems like can. Transmission also major issue, means infections, long haulers variants (potentially vaccine resistant/deadly/infectious variants could potentially affect vaccinated people too). [""The opportunities virus spread, replicates – opportunities undergo ain’t Korea Mate claim long term mild cases common. severe cases, sure—-but that’s true severe pneumonia study, conducted 250 people ages 21 78, tested positive COVID-19 February April last year, 97 percent mild symptoms antibodies coronavirus six months infected.

But **not** thing vaccine used. Germany prime example this, many choose take vaccine lets cut line, much higher demand supply group. means doses *are* EU also donating lots AZ citizens willing take it. great world, get wrong. That's good thing, AZ's rep trashed EU.

Swings roundabouts suppose. procurement brings total amount doses secured US German drugmakers 44.8 million, enough cover 70 per cent Malaysia's population, Mr Khairy said.

Great news! Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine clearly proven effectiveness around world even face variants concern. companies done well fulfill commitments. Definitely good decision Malaysian government order vaccine.

Pfizer delivered Malaysia total 2.75 million doses week since first shipment February. Another 2.22 million doses delivered throughout June. 25.68 million doses received throughout third quarter year (~2 million per week!). whole order 44.8 million doses arrive end 2021.

Besides that, Malaysia's entire order 12 million Sinovac vaccines fully fulfilled end July. AstraZeneca meanwhile expected deliver 610,000 doses June 410,000 doses July. Malaysia ordered 6.4 million doses AstraZeneca.

Since Malaysia began vaccinating late February, vaccination rate remained slow stagnant throughout March April supply bottleneck. government continually insisted rate increase supplies come in.

Bc science says shouldn’t worried you’ve vaccinated. It’s even “trusting people” I'm gunna call BS unless provide proof. way base statistics. need convincing confirm bias antivaxxer crowd. didn’t use breakthrough numbers efficacy. I’m backing statement vaccines reduce odds serious illness death microscopic amounts. Well... yeah. That's basic farm animal science. limit exposure amongst herd keeping every animal separate pen let infect much random shit weaker die things would normally built regular immunity to. unrelated side note, wanted strong independent humans, would require drink every mud puddle walked through. Instead make sterilize everything they're resistant nothing. matter? study accurate randomized. We're testing ""let's see vaccines work severely ill positive patient constant coughs me"" effectiveness elderly females, particularly age 80. far Brussels, I'm sure. open younger age groups earlier. kind dumb comparison. It’s saying 200 kids died flu 2019 300 died Covid past year. they’re right? also shutdowns, masking, social distancing. would true toll let wash everyone? contagiousness matters. 

So like comparisons flu, doesn’t add up.

Not mention long term effects unknown point. Seems like US get ass distributing extras, ""rich people first"" rather allocating ethically. viral loads reinfected recruits roughly 10 times lower newly infected, reinfected asymptomatic mild cases COVID-19, according report.

The real issue wildly variable. asymptomatic infection makes sense body mount adaptive immune response, to.

If ""real"" infection (mild, moderate, severe) symptoms recovery, immunity. happens *every infectious disease*. Scientists cautious nature, like make claims backed observation.

The time passes measure protective immunity recovered patients, longer ""predicted immunity"" get. People recovered SARS 1 still active cells 17 years later.

Anyway yes, get vaccinated available, protection better less. still good news herd immunity. previously infected repeat infection, could happen vaccine?
Yes, obviously protective measure vs infection, BUT, may know, side effects take time known.

I'm saying consider safe enough me.
I think main goal vaccination protection human beings, would unique vaccine, ant pharma companies would worked together. 3, 4, 6? Different vaccines, thing, year.
Sorry I'm waiting.

Even more. live, still mandatory wear mask outside house. government said vaccinated people ditch mask, would consider it.  Anectdotal data here.
My daughter's friend got along 3 siblings couple months back (her friend teenager 3 younger siblings). One little ones got first neighbor kid, little ones good careful.

Their vaccinated parents - 1 get (tested negative once), one got symptomatic Covid despite vaccine. Indeed. AZ delivered relative terms Moderna Johnson Johnson. Nearly half country stupid take anyway, not? company seems already pre-produced several million doses partners... hope able contribute European vaccination campaign July.

Will able simply expanding Pfizer/Biontech Moderna? Ontario's cases skyrocketing April recent lockdown. Alberta problems well. Manitoba's trouble right now.  hard trials vaccines already distributed! would amazing turns true. stay mildly optimistic data comes  case pre-covid long one, really looking help one

so due extreme case Trypanophobia (that want) unable vaccine even though offered already called back believe issue's panic attack's around needles act discourage others getting (it's not)

unfortunatly panic attack's case's start getting violent caused harm other's, point swine flu jab security forcebly confine order stop moving gave theropist believe's one reason's Trypanophobia gotten bad

I already tried afew thing's order get state including xanax/exposure theropy worked well (overdose drinking reccomended due single kidney) 

I asked afew thing's order done could help get vaccine sooner rejected every time, including knocked (they claimed illegal) J&amp;J 1 done (which claimed expensive getting in) 

at point completely idea's getting sick chased people believe issue's fake easy get around, want vaccine want keep panic attack's hurt people get violent (have control state)

any chance maybe non needle version work's maybe? (75% protection) X (39% population) = let 'er rip, apparently. mean aren’t using them, not. Seems like net positive.
Plus might get anti-vax nutjobs jealous go get shot themselves: “They terk er jabs!” There's argument made even serious illness significant risk children, still makes sense try limit transmission within group since act virus reservoir increase chance problematic variant developing. hand, far unvaccinated adults globally point (due lack access) unvaccinated children US, seems likely dangerous variant would develop internationally imported travel regardless happens kids US. I'm glad experts taking factors consideration developing guidelines. Agreed however dont good idea lasting effects getting virus children. evidence suggest alters DNA lasting detrimental effects die contract virus real issue. tend focus death, issue kids. big difference: Children vaccinated flu Covid-19 (yet). take measures deadly adverse events

Still surprised UK committed booster shots tbh. less fearmongered entire populated rejecting AZ vaccine

Not fearmongering all. rational choice young person wait weeks Pfizer like. they? 

Positivity also really really people say Covid mortality rate .001% masks don’t work. Trifecta pandemic stupidity. symptoms everyone church also sick several hospital. right beginning shut down. church got one first covid clusters city. Since (the hospitalized ones tested positive) symptoms figured well behaved such. means anti-vaxxer, I’m curious research needs done here. month 2nd dose got REALLY sick ended emergency 104.5 fever. typical symptoms hospital put COVID “ward”. tested negative COVID three times next week. followed primary care, said sounded like COVID, even though tested negative. 

It sounded like preliminary evidence people getting COVID testing negative vaccinated. whole thing annoys much. saying makes perfect sense, real life know want travel need get absolutely unnecessary second shot, fuck nuance, indication far anything short two doses good enough international flights anyone saying cases need vaccination antivaxxer burned. single country beside UK recieved significant amount doses vaccinate enough people.

I'll curious seeing vaccines distributed, looks like Pfizer delivering AZ rate. AZ committed non profit developing countries forever. I’m still amazed EU signed contract without first done due diligence

So US, US happened get luckier Moderna American company. that. UK study found
 
""The study, took place 5 April 16 May, found Pfizer vaccine 88% effective symptomatic disease Indian variant two weeks second dose, compared 93% effectiveness Kent variant.""
 
That's 88% even symptomatic disease. Much, much higher severe disease death.
  vaccines work way essentially. introduce viral components body recognises potentially dangerous body ""learn"" fight virus. immune response.

The reason need new flu vaccine every year viruses mutate. mutates enough body longer recognises virus initiate immune response. body becomes susceptible infection new strain.

So flu vaccines use either live form flu virus weakened cause harm.
Or 
A form virus killed can't cause harm.


But live killed virus vaccines contain whole viral particles vaccine itself. learned actually need whole viral particle induce immune response. Viruses proteins surface proteins generally enough initiate immune response. may heard H1N1, H3N2 flu viruses. ""H"" ""N"" different numbers actually refer different types surface proteins.


mRNA vaccines code proteins themselves. create exact mRNA sequences, means actually design exact surface protein want generate response. mRNA introduce system cells make viral surface proteins none parts virus, proteins can't harm. agree. Intent counts lot view. intended show would agree you. mind though looks less deliberate that. companies also delivered along way supports view problems producing vaccine speed volume rather malice. Hmm send spike protein nucleus eh? scientists hold possible theory, yet ""scientists"" subreddit ripped anyone worried possibility, claimed even suggest idea idiocy ""that can't happen"". really think best way promoting Sputnik V? Uh know long-term complications flu exist right? ""The flu worsen long-term medical conditions, like congestive heart failure, asthma, diabetes."" Hypothetical question, appreciate health care worker could answer :-)My friend underwent PCR test 16th May came negative. However follow PCR test 25th May came positive. chances friend spreading disease prior 15th May? resources verify answer mush appreciated 
Edit: friend vaccinated don’t think that’s case all. I’ve specifically heard people online , Twitter , Reddit continue wear masks fear anti vaxer anti masker. It’s purely social pressure. Masks weren’t supposed political right ? two doses. Many people refusing get point.  would unvaccinated now? We're sitting millions extra doses. sputnik distributed countries tracking side effect vaccines either _perfect_ politically motivated ;) want be, vaccinated anymore That's good point. far tell, treat patients well, idea many coronavirus patients might have. seen information that'd indicate they'd lower risk becoming case, possibly higher vaccination rates, may may true.. It’s likely all. There’s literally way evidence support vaccinated, never get vaccinated life. Pfizer CEO says people need vaccine every year, people first trials still immunity vaccine? mention rare get sick COVID twice, never bought going need get many vaccines like flu. Don’t add carbon burden bring people potentially horrible future get personal fulfillment jollies. That’s selfish. life satisfaction isn’t important. San Francisco Giants announced starting June 25th (first home series June 15th reopening) stadium full 41k capacity! That's even remotely true.

How could true, given covid rates fluctuate?

Well US certainly seem rush that. refused lift ban export raw materials India. Serious side effects would cause long-term health problem extremely unlikely following COVID-19 vaccination.Long-term side effects following vaccination extremely rare. Vaccine monitoring historically shown side effects going happen, generally happen within six weeks receiving vaccine dose.For reason, Food Drug Administration required authorized COVID-19 vaccines studied least eight weeks final dose. 280 million doses US given long-term side effects detected. impressive. arguments younger, AIDS. lot people wanted AIDS victims publicly identified, placed mandatory quarantine, least banned restaurants water parks sports leagues schools. 

Eventually, society recovered senses decided public health gains would realized policies weren’t worth social cost. 

While strongly encourage everybody vaccinated soon possible, think coercive policies like one you’re describing cause problems solves, long run.

Makes logical sense (someone gets hit like truck day 6 obviously going get sicker someone who's feeling great day 6) shown. Members family gotten COVID multiple times. don’t wear masks, distance, anything else “natural immunity.” main person saying nurse, rest follow lead trust judgement. didn’t believe strongly “naturally immune,” might gotten twice (and subsequently spread whoever spread to). 

You still increased resistance COVID getting it, isn’t strong response vaccine. definitely get spread many times. people holding everyone else back ""normal"". got stop daily ""evaluations"" job unvaccinated person quit. companies realize this, going required. honestly moral boost, knowing every single one coworkers protected give crap. ""but rare"" Whether true not, censor discussion. dialogue important. mean, unless previous science turned upside down, it’s reasonable assume “moderate” “severe” cases would generate even adaptive immunity (barring immune-compromised conditions). It’s also reasonable assume asymptomatic cases would generate less, possibly none (hence rare cases reinfection). source 1 88k statistic? sources say it’s rare number rare. Natural immunity lower efficacy rate mNRA vaccines

Going need source that. source says natural infection effective effective:

Why three?

Also, Zoidberg? reason prevent vaccinated U.S. tourists others entering.

As we’ve seen Taiwan, Canada, Vietnam, can’t keep covid forever, point, vaccines way zero covid viable strategy. many people saying “Russia China killing US vaccine diplomacy!!!” 

China, yes. Russia nothing pushing PR itself. fallen way behind delivery, India Europe exported far far US exporting South America radically overtake Russian vaccines.

Russia failed vaccine diplomacy. understand it, there's basically 3 possible scenarios floated:

1. One viruses retrieved natural source, bat guano, study natural state.
2. virus #1 used gain-of-function research natural mutations, similar variants evolved. 
3. virus #1 genome altered see could made suitable infecting species. 

Where ""man made"" line falls there, idea. understand, regardless whether lab source outbreak, seems fairly undisputed #1 #2 occurring Wuhan. #3 little less clear.   Words like “robust” don’t mean anything.

A moderate infection triggers adaptive immune response give someone long-lasting *protective* immunity - meaning re-exposed virus, regenerate antibodies likely fight without issues. still time period infected, symptoms, spread others.

Vaccines create *sterilizing* immunity, means already high titer circulating antibodies, virus never gets chance take hold all.

In interest getting pandemic control, sterilizing immunity better. doesn’t mean protective immunity exist effect. It’s nothing.

If infected symptomatic, *very likely* cells confer immunity, *very likely* cells stick around years. infected asymptomatic, it’s possible adaptive immunity never engaged, immunity.

My understanding basic virology, there’s nothing magic COVID makes exempt. researchers wary saying this, don’t want give anyone excuses avoid vaccination, don’t want people getting deliberately infected avoid vax. dropping time now. vaccinations going well Why? gain function research lab.

Regarding people trying get pregnant *during pandemic*, that’s entirely different conversation regarding mental health, also managed get pregnant (speaking *as* person struggles mental health). Plus, millions kids already exist need loving parents. 

There good reason get vaccinated, people would effing research. It’s FDA approved businesses reluctant require it. Understandable liability reasons. Never said don’t take vaccine. Wear mask, social distance avoid gatherings. Simple risk assessment health safety others works too. don’t trust fellow man even that. Hence matter hypothetical use... sizeable demographic going get shot. That’s insensitive, that’s realist. unless shots become mandatory argue hypotheticals we’re blue face. 

However say much emphasis *treatments* disease vaccines... 

i can’t top every avant-guard study gets issued... information surrounding covid mountain properly assess especially since new revelations seem come daily .... fact check CDC think pinned 0.03 % difference mortality new variants. Please fact check that...

Also article talked possibility variant first identified South Africa arriving there, think AZ's trial results shows 10.4% efficacity variant SA government halt rollout AZ there.

One point, personal opinion, find covid cases graph article kind odd. new case number hovering around 30 110 Feb early May. would expect skyrocketing cases, peak, downward trend lockdown, stay home, vaccine rollout. countries graphs look like that. Could limitation testing capacity beginning? think quite African countries many new covid cases limited covid testing capacity.

Chile interesting case, peaked April downward trend early May slightly going again. personally can't figure why. First want point using Sinovac, Sinopharm. Sinovac supposed 67% efficacity Chile, slightly lower Sinopharm's. tbh I'd expect better result there. helpful Chilean shine lights here. festival, lockdown rule change, mask rule change?

I think look situation Serbia assess Sinopharm's real world effect. Serbia signed contracts almost major vaccine manufacturers one highest vaccination rate Europe. Sinopharm delivered contracted (millions) manufacturers delivered much, 70% vaccinations used Sinopharm. number new cases decreased 5000+ peak March \~400 yesterday. downward trend evident. situation Serbia changes, worry Sinopharm's real world effect. course hope happen. states?  “Bah gawd king that’s flu’s music!!” I'd love see follow-up interview winter.

Sadly, whomever company wants. problem much influence facebook twitter similar social media has. Even Reddit mods power threads able delete comments posts.  could still lie employee. It’s hard duplicate vaccination card, claim lost it, etc..

It difficult ask employee produce real medical records upon request. HR request protect privacy so. business care verifying status bother substantial proof quote full bit second part relevant first part - saying prisoners deserve horrible treatment. stating case true. 

As second part, feel you, first problem think devil details. would rather system guy gets free meals one know innocent people sometimes end executed. 

Aside question innocent people put death, think people death penalty know full well people - lack better term - evil. believe government sanctioned murder preventable (as opposed war), even circumstances. suggesting terrorist hero? Yeah I'm sure come quick tech fix stop severe climate degradation. /S

Maybe stop buying techbro bullshit. Climate change going fuck us go tavern/bar debate Ohio lower amount people vaccinated US whole, even though pace US weeks ago. I've looked lot graphs I'm seeing impact had. Neighboring states vaccinated Ohio well. Michigan like 3% population first dose. Bingo. volunteer one waning early May bump due teens even sustained us, winding down. Hell last two stores went free vaccine signage Martial law? martial law variants? asking? pick nose rub eyes! Good thing decades old treatments them. research saw three months ago know exposure date 6-8 days exposure range least false negatives. don’t know exposed 2-3 days symptoms start best. I’d volunteer study immediately. I’d also like see study asymptomatic positive cases among fully inoculated people see much covid person emits speaking/coughing/singing etc.

In terms variants... part reason Johnson Johnson vaccine lower efficacy trial done later pandemic. Something like 2/3rds positive cases vaccinated group variants iirc. Notably deaths among vaccinated population don’t think hospitalizations either, hopefully means vaccines effective preventing serious illness variants. decides information true enforces it? still going human humans still going bias, conscious unconscious. 

There's one way say ""immunity known last least 3 months"" still factual.  think Coworkers would POd find someone lied getting vaccinated.

I’m sorry hear that. assumed Canada restrictions announced.  good Uruguay, 48% population got first dose (including me), 28% got doses (we using Sinovac Pfizer, Astrazeneca smaller numbers) case numbers deaths still high. Several high-profile persons recently tested positive including representatives, major catholic church archbishop.

There still dumb people getting infected illegal parties.

Well, *would* build mass transit systems actually worked.

If lived Tokyo, bother owning car, least use car often.

I sort think cars COVID similar many ways, though many deaths maimings COVID causes immediate, easier get people respond.

Cars slowly killing planet gruesomely butchering tens thousands people every year, one wants anything it. Idk far hospitalization got world class care team/institution US COVID CFR 1.8% (606k Deaths 34M Cases). would 164k deaths annualized. Fauci picked 10k Case target starting last summer reason. value brings Deaths 65k -- line worst flu death total last 50 years. think want avoid potential allegation gave $5 million buddies. depends. There's whole spectrum COVID stupidity there.

Some people believe entire thing fake. people believe symptoms real, they're caused 5G towers. accept virus real, think ""no worse flu!"". understand serious virus is, think vaccines somehow worse.

So, super low. 

Population = 6.289m, 38% vaccinated = 2.389m

900 2.389m = .000376 x 100 = .0376% That's what's happening, though. elderly WAY vaccinated younger population. 

The real answer probably related delay death reporting (deaths winter surge still getting added). California splits death data reported date/actual death date, see quite disparity: look like one woman refused process homosexual marriage years back?  us already vaccinated, seems kind stupid make retroactive. like bribing get vaccine, providing right thing regardless. Forget jail, forget fines. gets full coarse vaccines. Oh yikes person attacking - LOT people (myself included) tired seeing ppl complain downvotes like that. Personally downvotes ppl stuff. person replying REALLY nice polite it. Please take heart!

I hope rest day good one friend, life's hard enough lot people. think used 20,000 patients one trial UK. would enough catch something rare. Btw, flu vaccines tested far fewer. [In results *The overall reported rates serious adverse events 0.7% vaccine group 0.8% control group*. So, noise. 38% population 2.5 million people. 900 2.5 million 0.036%. would consider major success, vaccine ever 100% effective. anyone actually said cannot take Pfizer first dose AZ?

Because haven’t seen anywhere yet.

That risk keep speaking known (as shown initial data) orders magnitude less risky think is, vs unknown interaction known safe vaccine one you’ve already taken, first dose shown safe particular case.

You cannot claim going data willing bet unknown. That’s works. Top mind right Fuck, 4 weeks still stuck slow ass 4g. 5g kick in? Jealous.

Also, work 5G towers within 300 miles me? words Jimmy James, free advertising kind thing can't buy.

A lottery seems way effective spending $5 million ""Please, pretty please"" PSAs. That’s awesome. point almost whole family vaccinated, minus 12 ones. kids went first day available get second shot next week. lot people really pissed lottery reason it’s “ discrimination “ unvaccinated people. Reading comments makes roll eyes hard get migraine.  isn’t, it’s better nothing

And yeah I’ve concerts, many tho involved commenting either bot lab virus

Sure, kid. Whatever say lol something else happened different threat sometime within next years quarantine another year two, pretty sure 90% world population would lose damn minds. know would. crazy taxi shit LOL  big brain IQ correlation beating virus.......that would immune system..... Science learns time. Dumptruck classified information. Still unclear real origin - need get snarky. Look up. thanked everybody. discussion. Nothing. One person answered “no vaccine take effect 2 days” , told read again. That’s all.

And saying that’s terrible? scroll far 2130107 people fully vaccinated. 900 people gotten Covid.

900/2130107 = 0.0004, .04% vaccinated people tested positive Covid. 

It’s extremely low number.

Now, day? week? month? Since inception vaccine? amount time also big factor equation. Ooooooh forgot ask real governor permission oooooooooooooooh! it’s male, tell ED people dealing husband, inclined believe pants fire big bump adults. can't remember exact numbers, I'm pretty sure least 30% bump adults since lottery announced.  She’s going go things. like site coronavirus data -- curves data cases &amp; deaths, shows bit describing. likely, data have, closer results get.

For example, February 15 average 7 day average number daily cases 86,705, average 7 day average number deaths 3,008. Yesterday's numbers 23,019 635 respectively, means 73% reduction cases 78% reduction deaths. 

If wait extra month so, there's good chance rates April 15th skew closer now. Looks like normal tourist visit.

/s It’s people (myself included) felt would unnecessary spike. 

Things leveling rapid pace, it’s hard argue results. Damn, sounds high me. guess math would low percentage, 900 seems like lot. hard find dude.

This study, really, good caused lot headache. COVID infectious right symptoms start right symptoms start. goes there. absolutely zero chance transmission 10 days post-start symptoms everyone? probably not, far far less infectious beginning 10 day count even started. Well mean live life however want live. Seeing people outdoors, especially vaccinated, scientific standpoint, lowest lowest risk.

But hey, you! I’ll continue base decisions best science available live happiest lowest risk life. also Chile probably different variants places. even close yet. don’t even know day date SVOD kills box office yet. personally vaccinated Dec 2020 front line worker, spouse volunteer nurse vaccinator, two grandchildren ages 12 14 vaccinated weekend  know downvoted stating fact. Take upvote. coming small number grifters

I used think firing people sun solution. look find would really handful people. spread SARS-CoV-2 realize infected. many people whose immune systems can't fight virus naturally, risk even vaccinated. think vaccination important themselves, ask think others might make sick without knowing it.

Also talk lots natural things terrible us. Arsenic natural. Snake venom natural. Natural mean good. smallpox polio, wiped vaccination, still spreading human populations, would let immune system fight without primed?

Then there's vaccine itself. creating spike protein naturally exists surface virus. process technically happening naturally within cells, mechanism man-made. Man-made cell immune response. body still mounting natural immune response... could make immune systems things natural, we'd able wipe disease quite quickly. vaccines still rely natural function immune system learn potential invader looks like. That's pet theory mine while, too. People might even aware subtle fears, know uneasy, know why. easier use something else stated rationale. bonus people afraid it, too, feel like weirdo. completely understand that, wore mask there. pointing first time tried go without, failed. 

And, matters, signs door throughout facility saying anything continued mask mandate. driving recklessly parking lot may empty arrestable offense. made arrestable stuff see. Neutralizing antibodies much stronger vaccinated individuals current recovered natural infections, too. like epidemiologist breaks complicated concepts digestible pieces average uneducated Using /s tags take fun lmao post right place?

Not quite sure disproves proves I/the poster saying.  Together surrounding countries like Nepal, Bangladesh Pakistan. Going interesting next years, hopefully rear view mirror moved lives. reoccurring booster shots needed sounds like already working that. 

Looks like antibodies last long time great Try reading article then. might offer insight? Individual businesses make rules!  news media buzz story really might come lab. surreal playing out

Which dumb.

Because latest news *still* ""We dont know - lets investigate find out"" Laurie Kilmartin great bit kind thing. I’ll try justice:

So far I’ve collected free doughnut. bad, wouldn’t mind entering lotto.

""Health Officer Linda Vail says natural infection create immunity, there’s that.

“How long lasts, robust is, unknown,"" says. ""There studies showing vaccine give robust response. That’s CDC, state, adding numbers.”

Vail points state Michigan Centers Disease Control use phrase “naturally immunized” describe people COVID-19. Vail adds also concern whether immunity would continue protect variants coronavirus.""""

She said exactly said. Read fucking article dude, jesus. reason people losing trust health officials people reading fucking headlines that's it. going get even remote jist something complicated immunity damn headline. 

Read. The. Article. Taiwan’s geopolitical importance chip industry enough reason put top list sending vaccines to. prolonged lockdown Taiwan much impact us Latin American country. also undermine support pro-US ruling party. Thankfully we're mostly reliant Pfizer. guess original comment worded quite right that's came off.

My hesitation get vaccine risk/reward analysis. currently know, there's little reward see aside public policies catering towards vaccinated people. risk taking vaccine small, QA professional, I'm always concerned reliability new products. Sometimes issues show months even years - I've seen happen. would like tell us one ever asks about? really think people going ignore lottery state pay cent ticket? Well starters get tested easy. Yeah fine follow guidance go uncertainty certainties. Get home test CVS something tell roommate go local pharmacy test susceptible blood clots Pfizer one? Fair enough! agree. Actually that’s part line work, taking complicated data ideas distilling general audience. challenging sure.  can’t get yet? Ohio? There's two conclusions valid:

If blood clot vaccines vs COVID, people get vaccine. risk blood clots small, risk COVID big, regardless age range.

Going onwards, better improve vaccine, obviously. 

People saying wait second generation vaccine, reckless stupid. get yet, well great, slightly less chance getting blood clot. held it, that's worth risking COVID another year endangering circle likeminded acquaintances.

Fwiw, OP recklessly peddling negation first conclusion dismissive threat COVID. watch film Contagion, Jude Law character type disinformation ""journalist"" who's pushing fake miracle cure investing secretly. know better now. 

Social media making far much money nonsense shut past ten years notable exceptions like Trump Alex Jones.  drops

So people died going start coming back life? Man, we're barely starting get past covid, let's leave zombies future apocalypse. 2.5 1.5 went Canada. still helped complete lot municipalities 60 population. systemic disease doesn’t result long term symptoms? least lasting less year

Wait second, called severe systemic yet dismiss media BS? know many people say flu 1% death rate never consider cardiovascular neurological side effects many cases presented long term? would n-th time listen scientists, doctors, engineers, even teachers? protection 2 days first shot. can’t wait one says, “See, went away like said would.” wonder New York reach 70% vaccinated. kinda doubt tbh Yeah, Cuz Government officials ""hip kids"" always worked past. third step reccomendation masks public transport lifted, could fourth fifth one? Never shake hands without washing/sanitizing soon after, bet wash #1.

I care (generic ""you"") pee hands, touched junk. doesn’t way suggest getting COVID “better” somehow getting vaccinated.

Just FYI. public health official much fighting person believes that. He's wearing bloody WWJD/Livestrong bracelet ""naturally immunized"" it.

Which, maybe need take tinfoil hat, given [prepared statement PR regarding COVID-19 positive test falsehoods it, dude happened go positive time needing public, serious doubts whether actually contracted COVID. bet talked her, she'd tell current President, President Donald Trump, get credits bringing vaccines American people. exactly reaction brought lab-leak theory last summer.  something addressed keep real numbers. stated another comment Baja authorities left doses fist campagin 10% population already gotten Us. Ok tis border state lot dual citizenship. would willing say 2 5% Mexican population gotten vaccinated US. also makes wonder much vaccine tourism impacted covid Mx going 18 straight weeks. Ohio, picture mixed. days state announced vaccine lottery, average number new vaccinations per day increased many 26,000, 15,000, according state data, bump experts described meaningful time declining demand nationally. Yet upticks come prominently rural areas — state’s biggest cities — campaign started around time adolescents, ages 12 15, newly permitted get shots, generating new burst interest. asking questions, right?

Sure, pal. know game. kinda weird using word ""aid"" Japan purchased them.. Apparently, spotted sooner. symptoms appear 5 10 days vaccination patient shows low platelet count possible scan clots areas giving pain. US exporting anything? Yeah, say able safely go drink last night brewery friends, us sans-mask, pretty good prize us getting vaccinated. geopolitical perspective, focusing places like India, Europe, Japan, South Korea, etc. 

Any way slice it, Taiwan doesn’t need aid places truly suffering. think nontrivial amount people opposed getting vaccine kind fence want contrarian think they’re smarter everyone else they’re gonna looking great we’re sterilized aren’t. Plus ton people dragging feet don’t think need it/it’s big deal. Requiring vaccine would probably push people finally get it, even though know hardline anti vaxxers never Except there’s need opinion! aren’t medical expert. 

That’s like African Safari Guide going like “Oh say don’t go river play baby hippos? saw YouTube video said fun!” 

The issue isn’t people saying. It’s listened all. would lead inevitable lawsuit. Someone wins want show proof, HIPAA rights, leads sewing. Doubt goes far still avoidable headache. hate people makes think people shoot people abortion clinics. TL;DR math back days low cost living area want closer 3 million basic ""good life golden toilets"" lifestyle.

Yeah numbers ago. order get ""set life, go ahead retire"" want much live expected lifestyle *interest* get letting money site somewhere - usually 3-4% considered safe.

For me, make $60k/year roughly. 60k 4% 1.5 million.

And *after tax* amount receive. taxed 40%, prize needs $2.5 million.

So, I, low cost living area, want continue life exactly simply working (i.e. house payment, groceries, etc, etc.) would need win 2.5 million.

Personally, think got 2.5 million prize, I'd continue working debts paid - always want lump sum (for example, mortgage rate like 2.9% something, investing returns 3-4% hold true, profitable make minimum payments). that, get point make double current yearly salary (so get 'nest egg' 3 million) *and then* retire.

I think got 2.5 million payout take long get after-tax $3million.

Obviously, high cost living area, want increase values proportionally. fair, idea disease “man-made” still remains realm conspiracy. likely scenario lab leak theory zoonotic transmission due poor lab protocol. words, might’ve studying bats natural COVID, bat transmitted disease human.

The real question Facebook arbiter this. understand it’s platform, aren’t reliable fact-checkers, agenda. Sure, there’s “misinformation” Facebook. fact-checkers seem full “misinformation” themselves. (This applies social media platforms even mainstream media fact-checkers.) I’m disappointed surprised. Expected something like happen... health conditions hinder immune system, good go, mask not. public transportation, wear mask, rules; however, safe overall. vaccines work, work well. individuals like vaccinated expected adequately protected due immunosuppressing medications.  take pain killers shot symptoms show help out. really big deal vast majority people protected covid well worth little bit side effects may monumental fucking moron, still made clear me, words even monumental fucking moron understand, OK take certain level risk mitigations developed (i.e., voluntarily undergo certain level risk, knowing mitigations failed, would taking even risk) yet, even mitigation needed assume similar level risk, OK that.

And yes, course medicine treat bee stings. That's point: sometimes medication fails kids still die. Without medication, bees would greater threat child COVID. 

The situation COVID will, hopefully, keep getting better. Even doesn't, risk still high need keep locked away excluded friends family; seem OK risk it'll make unreasonably anxious overburden anxiety, odds absolutely overwhelming anxiety benefit physical health whatsoever.

Incidence rate reinfection versus month follow-up show evidence waning immunity seven months follow-up. Meanwhile, complement cohort 149,923 antibody-negative persons followed median 17.0 weeks (range: 0–45.6), incidence rate infection estimated 13.69 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 13.22–14.14).

""do research"" coded language cherry-picked facts support desired narrative.

""The media"" puts experts TV says next nothing try avoid sued.  LMAO!! take step back, stop fucking narcissistic sociopath, apply empathy?

What empathy kids want live reasonably normal life, seeing friends, normal social interactions? go fashion 2019? 

Are going screaming parents children died stung bee, calling narcissistic sociopaths (because danger *exists* mitigated, yet children wear beekeeping suits leaving house?)

I dismiss loss someone whose child died COVID: would say blame themselves. would believe unquestioningly said could prevent it. 

As COVID case numbers decline, vulnerable protected, living normal life sin. issue argument sort draw parallel two risks similar, all. completely leaving post COVID symptoms, etc. equation. odds getting covid long term symptoms going much much higher getting blood clots vaccine. one arguing improving vaccines bad, way framed post off. Also Moderna, CureVac potentially Novavax, sanofi smaller projects well. need dangerous vaccines good safe ones. think astra zeneca one disappear within next two years. Mental break. absolutely that. could use logic math announce ""99.9% unvaccinated people get COVID"" correct take raw number divide different raw number make sweeping conclusions based it. Sure, false negative.  Yes.  Quite possibly. hopeful! Ok thanks, appreciate response. Replace Quack Fauci Rand Paul.  Ok thanks, appreciate response. roommate smart guy

Is really though? ex's brother like gave benefit doubt started talking things knew. realized full shit time, quite good projecting confidence says it. Oh ok, see, thanks! 2nd shot hopefully easier body. disagree. Daycare unavoidable working families. risk take order provide family. mean every less moderate risk negated endure moderate risk already. Every additional risk, additional amount risk. Additional risk necessary provide food shelter, pandemic, totally reasonable avoid.

None normal trying treat way, avoiding sacrifice try achieve comfort, harmful behavior. increased amount consequences maybe directly person exhibiting behavior, thanks asymptomatic transmission, unlucky s.o.b. three contact tracing levels away them. dying car crash isn’t halting slowing world economy trade. got 2nd Pfizer shot Tuesday night, symptoms day yesterday, today honestly feel fine. I’m little worried myocarditis...Iv read somewhere exercise days post-vax? true? really want least go walk enjoy fresh air (also helps anxiety) don’t want exert self/body...  Public transportation safe, since everyone wearing masks trains good rate air exchange. restaurant many times dangerous, since everyone unmasked ventilation often poor. But, fully vaccinated probably good go either those! makes wonder leads this? 

I get necessarily disagree. people like aggressive moron also victims poor education critical thinking skills. There's simply way woman getting ""facts"" anywhere else besides Fox, Facebook, OAN. They're literally dumbest among us think *they're* ones inside track *real* information instead recognizing propaganda really is. 

See also: January 6, 2021. much protect becoming sick first shot?  hilarious is, think get lot new following spite :) Wonder political leanings are? Europe prolong contract AstraZeneca anyway! 

And no, sadly afaik way easily find forming blood clots there, blood test would help! Yeah, headline's shit.

The actual statement fine basically says ""Current science seems show us natural immunity robust vaccine induced immunity.""  Except obese people also risk diabetics enough co-morbidities cover good chunk America.

Notes: 

* Population uses 2020 estimates, such, percentages slightly lag CDC data, however, percentages take account entire herd, higher 2020 population compared 2019's used CDC. Also note 12+ number available 2019 population values.   isn’t coercion though. Nobody pointing gun head saying “you **must** disclose health information”.

They’re saying “do want million dollars? must task”

I much harder tasks far less money every single freaking day. shouldn’t martial law?  Good responsible people looking this. assumed olympics, would without international crowds. 

Like Olympics version NBA bubble.

I see there’s risk, it’s countries’ Olympic teams don’t see much chance world changing surge. cases disruptions sure, spawning new vaccine busting variant? Depends prisoner

That's works. they're held prisoner deserve human treatment human rights. Period. think push death penalty. long society holding helplessness we're responsible care. shown solid immune response. Side effects necessarily quality immune response. lot restrictions high mask compliance compared countries. Come country truly want see sad state (no restrictions, zero mask usage). Yeah partner Southern Illinois near St. Louis wondering Maryville, IL ask knew lady lol Yeah, think masks identity-politics game something instead rational response unprecedented global pandemic. GOP idiots call anti-fa   Probably trump would pardon soon retakes office. know, kraken gets released democrats go jail. surely minute now... ""COVID-19 Breakthrough Case Investigations Reporting | CDC"" says ""As May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned monitoring vaccine breakthrough cases focus identifying investigating hospitalized fatal cases due cause. help maximize quality data collected cases greatest clinical public health importance.""

There info page. honest I'm totally sure impact specific numbers be, drive down. They've everything open time. masks, distancing, measures, little risk. lives mostly pretty normal, except occasional lockdown. I'm sure they're better many places North America (e.g. Toronto lockdown close year now). Maybe use incentive get people back work? better yet give people worked entire time use extra unemployment payments nice extra payment I'm glad brother safe. Thank sharing that, gives hope husband's safety since too, poor health. actually enjoy wearing masks now, pollen season strong love see  Yep  Yep, charge know easiest make stick, results arrest, plenty time add fact. important part beginning get arrest make stick. Everything shut down. expect parents do? old child? True, around 8%. math still pretty easy lot bullshit, including covid related bullshit, simply made spot. know guy got temporarily banned Facebook spreading misinformation last year claimed cough went office January 2020 actually early wave covid quietly ""burned through"" town resulting widespread immunity thereby making unnecessary wear mask. quotation anyone else involved. People must love you.  received vaccine getting infected. got infected symptoms. reason knew infected procedure. procedure would never known. *doesn’t want ppl get vaccine don’t die
*kills anyways “beliefs” would much rather 100 dollar COVID savings bond getting vaccinated 1/10000 greater chance winning million dollars. I'm also type person play lottery know odds favour. think level new mask guidance communicated vaccines work significantly prevent infection transmission helped sway people didn’t think would get seriously ill also didn’t think vaccine would prevent passing others. 2021-05-27 Vaccination demographics update

I think getting rid mandate obviously result cases would weren't, cases general still gonna drop. fine.

DPP anti-China KMT pro-China botched diplomatic effort US could easily enough swing next election towards KMT. Good see somebody stepping afraid show reason why.

Yesterday posted question country can’t choose vaccine get. people get Janssen, Pfizer, Moderna. AstraZeneca much anymore.

If get invited choose come, get back line get vaccinated later.

All asked was: wait get Janssen get Pfizer instead seems Pfizer effective (compare 94 67).

And mention downvoted found entitled. think made assumption there. wouldn’t somebody consider waiting mind one good people around them?

Another option explain somebody coming sub question effectiveness. could chosen nothing (also downvote). Perhaps better can’t really explain effectiveness. Makes sense. guess wait everything backlogged get accurate death rate. TEAR MUGSHOT?

HAHAHAHAHAHA Yes no. real danger wild blatantly false info spreading unchecked facebook. drinking bleach cures covid went viral facebook, real public interest stopping that. need room public debate well. should, aren't. think state provides much information beyond ""we received death certificates today."" Pamela's post, 1st world country good care, people surviving still ICU's. lot ICU beds spare, we're able keep people alive, could using beds months. 

I think collapse bit harsh. meant room influx ICU patients, major accident somewhere could difficult provide proper care lack beds. 

Thankfully Ontario's ICU covid use shrinking last weeks, able take patients Manitoba. surprised Alberta helping well. vaccination going far? gave vaccine. wish legislators would focus expanding accessible compensation route put good chunk hesitant ease rather offering CICP. legislators would betting low risk injury remains contentious worry hesitant. many people supported idea financial incentives increase vaccination, disgusted recent post worried father offered money daughter vaccinate things like rather expand VICP cover covid vaccines, would expand CICP compensate legal fees like VICP, seems like they're ignoring raised alarms amongst hesitant. zero ebola strategy ebola pandemic? zero bubonic plague strategy bubonic plague pandemic?

The aim get close zero possible, even achieving zero seems impossible. Instead devalue life accept avoidable casualties. remember particular evidence seriously debunked.

We proof either way, may never really know. lab theory still least likely imho.

But also realise tgat internets always does, point squarely Wuhan lab, regardless whatever evidence say. says use phrase, get sick twice.

Vail points state Michigan Centers Disease Control use phrase “naturally immunized” describe people COVID-19. Vail adds also concern whether immunity would continue protect variants coronavirus. 
 
Being infected twice rare, says, happen, lead life-threatening complications. ""man made"" aspect tacked on. part looking plausible.  CDC says discrepancies come various places using population numbers, 2010 census, 2020 census, 2019 estimates. know pretty well many shots given out, know less certainty many people total. also doesn’t help respectable media outlets like NYTimes pounce rare case COVID harming children broadcast far wide.  main issue immunity induced single infection highly variable, people little response robust one. Everyone adenovirus vectors seem trouble manufacturing. LMAO 11/10 know reality legally complicated, I’m ideal world would rather disperse excess vaccines countries need inoculate vulnerable population rush vaccinate kids here. awh man, got 20% coupon...

At least worked already-discounted Easter candy states already fully open. Illinois isn’t fully open law. fact it’s going one last states fully re-open. lived here, businesses following capacity restrictions. eased mask policies. cases still plummeting. take straight CDC: comment. excited woman won, also scared going hounded money even worse, ridiculed anti-vaxxers. wish anonymity this, like actual lottery. matter know not, credible.

Lol zero ebola strategy? zero bubonic plauge strategy?  percentage US adults received least one dose? feel like hear conflicting numbers swear everyone became expert doomsday hyperbole entire year. like reading Edgar Allen Poe every day. could put ""Linda Vail"" title, probably known would sounded silly.  restrictions Florida. here. cases keep falling. spread false narrative, hot spot Florida 100% successful, make goal? entire countries low vaccination rates beliefs vaccinations resources? One things fairly easy fix, however unpopular may politically.

Domesticated animal reservoirs obstacle difficult means closely monitoring agricultural, achievable? Thank you. Mental illness. don’t need biological mechanism say it’s uncertain point don’t perfect knowledge biological mechanisms possible.

It’s vaccines vaccines long term effects pop months shot. However case viruses. means you’ll fine, quarantine either two weeks+ phone contact doctors test negative twice row. avoid spreading asymptomatic. Yes push downplay protection prior infection get vaccine anyway primary reason I'm vaccine hesitant. covid feel like public officials like salespeople trying sell BS use for. caused it, occurrence rate something like 1 million. already issue unlikely worth wasting resources on, honestly. true.  That's anecdote. People crazy. There's ton disinformation, coming small number grifters profiting people sick. feel bad people buy it. truly end, may never know I'm blind... clots found caused vaccine? point contact tracing never going work place like US allow restaurants, schools, workplaces, stores etc operate mild interventions maintaining 6 feet distance.

If patron restaurant found Covid, contact tracers looked contacts within six feet 15 minutes, never going catch rest attendance breathing virus laden aerosol cloud. There's 0 evidence things. is, however, millennia evidence brothers pranks jokes brothers. brother proudly continuing tradition. Maybe censorship bad idea. Exactly say people ask kids still wear masks! know virtually doctors ton nurses aren’t getting vaccine. Apparently hospital 95% physicians (100% medical students) 50% nurses gotten vaccine. Yes. Hello. Yes. point. Life incredibly depressing, makes 100% sense people, even kids, depressed. 

There’s point lying though. 

At least take comfort fact people deciding reproduce, less traumatized hopeless children deal with. states pandemic. again, state said wear masks outside didn’t wear one, happens? many tests day now? positive rate? Maybe original definition written way original vaccines, interchangeable? hope malaysia Yes! remember many people making comments large sporting events, concerts, international travel gone forever. really believe them, comments stressed hell see! Wisconsin advertise don’t show ID Well one sign June/July see small spike states ease last Covid regulations. go back summer 2020 you’ll see small spike bunch states lifted first round lockdowns. Partly, think larger issue effectively ""debunked"" wacko conspiracy push came shove. Debunked with, surprise, zero supporting evidence (relative baseline zero evidence).  places got sick church (where everyone also sick) work (where we'd already several positive cases). Right, enough people got vaccinated we'd reach herd immunity. says herd immunity enough people gotten vaccinated people vaccinated protected. R/fuckyoukaren     visited 60 graves huge response, thought, ‘Something special happening here,’ ” said Domenech, former Pentagon employee lives Alexandria recently became senior policy adviser House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).

Friday Sunday, group place small wooden American flags gravesites 4,000 veterans buried Arlington, share photos social media friends family hashtag #TheHonorProject. incredibly lucky. like particularly safe prior vaccinated. Went restaurants throughout worst pandemic, wore regular masks.. sometimes. 

I've wondered myself. finally became eligible state JNj much available Pfizer. got jnj too. Waiting upgrade. Politicians role telling folks listen Drs, scientists public health officials, that? Yep, shut up! brother wrong. study. cannot get 100% get vaccinated. country come close. Yeah, free advertising promoting vaccine alone made lottery good ROI, especially since first state it. states following likely see smaller impact overall since they'll get less media attention.  That's precisely would get tested order notify close contacts information entered Covid tracking system everybody smartphone.

All works people get tested known positive cases registered tracing. Knowingly sabotaging sounds antisocial me, sorry. didnt claim anything scared go special ed class. brother said it. Animal reservoirs exist it. Entire countries low vaccination rates worldwide.

There thing covid zero earth.  would small inconvenience ban cars use trains. one leading causes death all. Also, hope fast food illegal Australia. Heart problems kill thousands every year.  feel like body practice fighting colds though.  got first dose Pfizer vaccine yesterday. I’m constant agony I’m waiting third day post-vaccination pass, that’s say news people developed ITP, condition seems happen randomly (unknown risk factors). scaring myself? last March isn’t it? remember it.

Also it’s opinion won’t last. Doesn’t fit criteria. aren't. Tons vaccinated people saying need keep masks restrictions kids get vaccinated. Would St. Jude's employees considered front-line health-care workers? I'm admittedly super familiar breadth work St. Jude's does, understanding primarily research hospital, right? regardless, expect treating whole lot covid cases, imagine heightened level exposure due treatment one major reasons front-line healthcare workers higher risk. I’m aware one. said studies suggest COVId-19 doesn’t look like man-made, also Fauci originally said I’m interesting learning that. 

Do know study like published, least discussed detail, anywhere couldn’t find? conspiracy guy, faucci labelled co blocker. remember correctly asymptomatic. one went hospital died, main function vaccines. highly effective infection cherry top. I’m week post first dose protected I?  someone refuses vaccine, know better, doesn’t care put others risk, don’t kids, won’t lose sleep it. Anything less extreme would probably bother me. 

Another thing consider widespread effective bad info internet been. like think smart enough overcome fall victim manipulation one time another.  - ""Within study, still waiting higher number Covid-19 infections."" However, said expects see study results timely manner. data in, Curevac ""will probably need one two weeks"" finalize marketing authorization application European Medicines Agency (EMA). normal process, spokeswoman said. -

I hoped would see Curevac approved early June. think unlikely.

The company seems already pre-produced several million doses partners... hope able contribute European vaccination campaign July.

After all... Europe needs every dose get world too.  Obliterate them. Bankruptcy! article shit.

No, understand 0.01% means context. *not* one person 0.01% chance catching vaccinated. 

It means given sufficiently large group vaccinated people, average 0.01% become infected they're exposed. may clear, using words like ""may"" ""can"" they're essentially saying know, we're extra careful. vastly different people saying ""vaccines prevent spread.""

They clearer knowing knowing doesn't, accurate statement could've made. me, seems healthcare workers likely catch covid general population. 

""In UK USA, risk reporting positive test COVID-19 increased among front-line health-care agree. get acute necrotizing encephalopathy flu though.  think sadly influenced people like Anders Tegnell think resistance futile best let things blow we'll heard immunity months time. get infected takes least 2 days infectious.

More like 4-5 days. takes time virus multiply enough become contagious. go test they'll ask believe exposed. less 4 days, they'll tell results going meaningful. That’s fair obviously personal bias still look back wish even handedness clear advice public policy officials must inkling (and didn’t that’s job).

...but I'm sure people end kind thing rational enough dissuaded potential legal ramifications. know get like it? coercion they're waving million bucks face. They're literally saying, ""We give $1 mil tell world vaccinated."" Also, states databases vaccinated individuals. executive orders several states banning things. even do, databases public. think we're sort right here. 

You're right likely saw Facebook, BUT, feel like half clips reshares pulled Fox. misinterpret study you’re correct.

I wonder happened got positive getting 3 negatives tested avoid contamination.

It seems really odd compare study 5-10 studies way lower reinfection rates 0.65% 0.7% instead 10%. Something seems off.

Id like know sensitivity specificity test. test 1,000 people already covid would suspect high false positive rate since likelihood reinfected seems quite low. sure spread quite bit likely would localized offset preexisting immunity. rational understandable response see, read, hear, world taken ""brown people"" ""they want take &lt;insert object Yes, problem low-effort people taking gospel media political masters want, real deep-core issue lack skepticism, lack critical thinking skills. that's masters want, dumb, controllable, fearful idiots. sounds like something Onion stay level headed medical professional antivaxers world. see increase asthma diagnosis post COVID?

Even assume 3x death rate 0.6% IFR that's 54k deaths, flu 24-62k deaths (big range know). However given vaccines reducing fatality risk likely recently approved antibody therapies EUA, I'd assume fatality rate going forward cases still dropping too. point disease year round constant much damage flu season, less, least that's seems based numbers I'm quickly pulling online. anyone insight I'd love learn more. numbers listed may fact think may 80%of cases asymptomatic mild symptoms. right extremely small sample size. small determine pacing opposed natural infection.

But point healthy people age 50 getting vaccine prevent getting virus. stop possibly spreading others potentially killing them. opinion, effected last year half quarantine. social responsibility get vaccine order end pandemic. complained even covid affected world. again, responsibility get vaccine order able complain it.

Even able link SSN something, would always issue counting people undocumented.

But I’m sure it’s close enough estimate get point across think people also considering we’re going using vaccines long time. It’s like virus going disappear.

We’re trying fight pandemic, need much strong, sterilizing immunity world create, means getting everyone vaccinated.

That’s kind separate thing scientists get nitty gritty immunity works, long individual adaptive response might last, etc. It’s cool know, example, found active cells recovered SARS 1 patients *17 years* infection recently found strong cells bone marrow people recovered form mild COVID19 stuff doesn’t really change policy. COVID big problem allow us wait around measure good people’s “natural” immunities are. Words like “robust” don’t mean anything.

For public health official talking public, think do.

In common parlance, ""robust"" going understood stronger. saying true, public ain't gonna understand use word ""robust"" describe vaccine induced immunity understand that.

You've got stuff back hip bocket really care dig deep, average joe there: ""Go get vaccinated even infected even safer."" far need go. understand something concerned exactly virus? compares risk AZ getting seriously ill Covid age group.

Ontario (Canada) allowing AZ aged 50-60 later 40-60, 60+ getting Pfizer Moderna. Then, three simultaneous factors 1) *rate* Canadians (specifically women 30 50) getting dying AZ-related blood clots rose, 2) number new daily COVID cases across province dropping rapidly, 3) imported shipments Pfizer Moderna went way up... government decided first week May use AZ first dose longer justified.

Supplies Pfizer Moderna high enough one week AZ-halt order issued, anyone 40+ could book appointment Pfizer Moderna, week anyone 18+ could book one (to fair, appointments weeks future).

Right. information useful someone already significant confirmed infection.

It doesn’t way suggest getting COVID “better” somehow getting vaccinated. COVID crazy #@&amp;$ disease want mess with. it’s even dying, it’s also long-term health problems seeing significant cohort patients (like me) younger side mild infections still trouble several months later.   Tennessee ... yeah that's arrested her. read? Yeah, that’s really low number, dude CDC even testing anyone unless people get ill now. CDC seems abruptly, someone quietly telling people get vaxxed get covid. Like, variant evaded vaccines reassess, currently don't. asteroid could fall house right now, moving chair. Get vaxxed, turn life position, realize million things bad worse worry about, lol. btw  always feel way big lottery prizes - numerous, smaller ones would better - data seems indicate big prizes draw big ticket sales, that's correct, psychology would least put good use ""ticket"" = vaccination.  2 months vax I've got flu. like remember sick! link says B117 (UK variant) mortality 0.4% strain mortality 0.3%. dividing two numbers get 33% higher mortality UK variant (0.4/0.3 = 1.33). simple, probably made demographic-adjusted comparison comparing mortality across age groups. likely people study infected B117 skewed younger. number came 64% higher mortality B117. would isolate people bunch different age ranges divide mortality age range.  like guy tried shoot cyclist head shooter thought dangerous cyclist kid child seat bike. people prison mental health facilities.   even worry it.

Of course none matters courts decided unethical jail someone crime technically commit. Lol anyone gets covid next fall 100% them. Vaccines fully distributed  I'm sure nothing change CDC tracking &amp; reporting cases. 25k cases flu day summer would unheard of. vaccines working, gotta keep pushing can. thread aged find odd Tennessee claims 900 breakthrough cases vaccine. 38% population vaccinated. sound right?   Yeah issues stupidly got disease got vaccine sucks can't fix stupid. Retroactive abortion would seem order. people dumb live.

For sensitive, please look ""hyperbole.""  iirc try administer different dosages, failed design study beforehand. led one group small variable timelines vaccines, wanted test one dose regime first switched.

No fucked dosage, measurement error Oxford leading overestimate concentration, original measurement Italian plant correct. figured participants fewer side effects expected. kinda tried mislead public documents published Lancet confirm error lay Oxford researchers. common emulsifier, polysorbate 80, used vaccines facilitate mixing, interfered ultraviolet-light meter measures quantity viral material, according documents. result, vaccine’s viral concentration overstated Oxford ended administering half doses vaccine, believing full Okay person know going afraid around vaccinated people due risk ""vaccine shedding."" Apparently thinks around people recently vaccinated make sick. 

I genuinely curious someone would come conclusion they've done reading vaccines work. Sometimes feels like people wearing masks show others rather health reasons.

The number people see wearing masks still feels higher percentage folks vaccinated be. Rather, ""knowing mean anything"" people wants clear CCP responsibility, good chunk world - particularly experts biosafety, economy, policy makers (along much collateral damage, i.e. 170 million cases, 3.5 million deaths, millions lost livelihoods) - knowing institutional Chinese action(s) led worst economic health disaster recent history means like don’t instances lab leaks country.

What about? I'm open exploring any/every possibility help prevent pandemics least impact.

However, remain skeptical *Lab leak* explanations simply I've heard every uninformed conspiracy theorist.

If makes want less true ever, that's personal bias need check. Hey, got second dose Sputnik, side effects first, small tingling around body ... Anyone share too. someone post mirror? access denied outside US. know used Sovereign example.  Perhaps thought 10K 100 winners sound fantasy-attractive million dollars?

Additional news also reported Process-related impurities/proteins taken care lead ""increase [in] safety type proteins involved “are known affect innate acquired immune responses intensify existing inflammatory reactions,” Prof Stefan Kochanek, study leader, said. “They also linked autoimmune reactions.” (Ulm University Medical Centre).

And is: Prof Andreas Greinacher Greifswald University Hospital claimed clots caused EDTA, chemical used preservative AstraZeneca vaccine.

I think information improtant put perspective Rolf Marschaleks report cited needs researched connection eachother. I'm really trying argue anything particular, using car crash analogy someone used say others worry blood clots show also used argue worrying Covid. Car crashes socially communicable. driving adding another car road could hit person, collide another vehicle, mechanical failure leading injury/death. 

I worry blood clots caused Covid vaccines think great thing vaccine available people now. defend peoples right worry health scientifically proven reason however. can't tell people pay attention scientific research goes want tell listen goes along want. point we're using tool instead encouraging people well informed. thing “no” risk. Even fully vaccinated there’s still technically tiny chance could hospitalized Covid.

Moderna Pfizer made efficacy claims based symptomatic infection, positive tests. used different criteria qualifies symptomatic. study cite shows seropositivity provides ~80% infection ~90% protection symptomatic infection. also 3 individuals symptomatic group previously infected, small sample. short, without access detailed data, think it’s hard draw meaningful conclusions comparing protection vaccines protection previous infection. issue anti-vaxxers. argument always ‘its body worry own’. Ok, lunatics stuff like people want vaccines. Whereas body drive vaccinating people. sounds like terrorism me.

COVID unmitigated, sure, kids *it's dangerous start with*. things mitigated started really, really dangerous become less dangerous we've introduced mitigations, I'm glad did.

I still think vaccination and/or herd immunity wider population good things reduce risk: study shows risk small children low start that, vulnerable adults around protected, worth worrying about.

You're right done; equally, long-term sequelae COVID children infected numbers greater endemic virus.

If chosen random, children 10-20× likely die COVID bee sting. COVID deaths skew hugely toward older children pre-existing conditions; data bee stings age I'm still willing bet waiting epidemiological studies confirm whether child safe unmitigated risk bees.

Also, calmly combat misinformation people blatantly spreading internet COVID vaccines? E.g, 5G bullcrap, Bill Gates microchips, toxic chemicals lipids, etc? personally bothers much get heated can't good confidence argue person believes stuff listed. Thank taking time read this, hope great day! You’re confusing viral vector vaccines mRNA vaccines. ones cause blood clots viral vector vaccines ones said can’t enter nucleus (and you’ve linked to) mRNA vaccines. Two entirely different vaccine delivery methods.   US vaccines effective India variant. variant responsible Michigan break April, cases plummeting we're along vaccinations.  That's often wonder. ""best case scenario"" thought here? Totally agree. 

Unfortunately still influential people trying push zero covid strategy undermining importance vaccines keep point. Thank link... read it... coincides unfortunate mistake typing 0.03 CDC actually 0.3% mortality difference viruses circulation.

It words... it’s transmissible? virus deadly? 

I thought rule thumb viruses become transmissible less lethal mutate. Would lab leaked altered genome virus complicate things? find please let know. 

But I’m virologist, geneticist immunologist. Finding non partisan expert fields probaly worst part especially people think things. reading facts studies are. study published released March. wonder mortality rate changed since then? 

If want say go get vaccine. Sure it! got mine beginning third wave Ontario Canada. work private avaition deemed essential due patient organ transfer contracts. Even two weeks covid patient transfers bunch workers opted due fear. can’t help question everything... even myself... I’m still waiting second shot Pfizer... always find questions answers.

I feel historians route firmly addresses everything covid related... can’t help think poorest, unhealthiest working classes hit hardest... work pandemic... hypocrisy different attitudes come contact regarding virus interesting say least... especially working classes risk everyday live paycheck paycheck. thinking personal experience. 

There correlation obesity, environmental factors malnutrition made death toll is... that’s systemic problem within western culture... firmly placed conspiracy theory camp amongst people... I’m thinking loud.  know place specifically, I've lived towns cop give citation crossing parking lines instead going lanes. parking space cross technically offense means get $100-200 ticket crossing 5 lanes.

My neighborhood safe, clean, reasonably affluent, uneventful. go nextdoor read local forums, notice pretty quick boomers especially huddled homes, cowering shivering fear. Occasionally one lash badmouth liberal complain masks, usually terrified babbling. hear helicopter, see brown person car, hear new bus stop considered, see child spoken anyone, big dog, hear firework night, start posting ""what that? that?""

Nothing bad ever happens saw think live, would think lived third world hellscape thieves, murderers, liberal death squads, hordes immigrants child molesters running rampant.

Once realize peoples lives defined constant white knuckle terror, see death destruction lurking every shadow, becomes lot easier understand they're irrational time. better society people would get mental health assistance need without slightest stigma way reach point.

Waiting this. know anything India variant vaccine effectiveness? person know lamenting variant going take us back square one and, much negative discussion last year half, want worry things worth worrying about. Seems like Astra Zenica. lost 45 year old man recently Ontario Canada.  Well, going general demographic those, strong test!! 
 
I'll wave them... shore... I'm watching TV goes old people line. something changed. photo also appear live say poor ghetto issues either. Oh, like new metaphor: throw book antivaxxer can't make read. numbers may off. Around 20% cases remain truly asymptomatic unvaccinated population. Severity remaining 80% varies. 

If use extremely small sample size Yankees base, vaccines still outperforming natural infection. 

Remember Moderna Pfizer trials researchers test participants nearly intervals Yankees tested at. trials reached endpoint prevented severe disease hospitalization, big effect reducing infection all. practice bunch people probably get virus mRNA vaccine trials. that’s fine insignificant didn’t even know happened.

It’s important remember end game here. Imagine US year deaths hospitalizations virus fallen levels can’t imagine today. useful Yankees tested consistently? useful argue vaccines don’t stop infection completely? There’s big difference incentive sanctimonious lecture. think it’s dumb someone would get vaxxed free beer, works get apathetic people shots, won’t complain. work on?
