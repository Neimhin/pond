Please link study referring to. Interested read true. There's nothing wrong making decisions based feelings. People every day. fact vaccines normally take years develop, one taking months. 100% rushed obvious reasons. didn‚Äôt know Polish President ceremonial position.  Well, mean, legally wrong? No. dining indoors far riskier dining outdoors, high risk depends locale. social distancing inside really help all. first full winter northern hemisphere coronavirus.

Its gonna rough.

As weather gets colder, cases deaths continue climb. seen anything yet. 

Whoever wins next election US likely sworn true winter peak. definitely overreacting. sounds like perfectly safe. Sometimes look around think ""am crazy one taking precautions?"" see news NZ remember like nice things. ability manage respond grown exponentially though. still fall! Same. I'm fucking ashamed response. Yup. walk first thing say.
Ever since 8.
It real adventure lining get 7shots blood draw basic training...I'm certain I'm story 5 people room. church gofundme open hopes winning moron-lottery 5...4...3... get people getting homes, brought home somehow. feel like ""home"" kind cop tracing. 

So let someone home positive? person gotten someplace else. everyone stayed home, nobody would ever get it. problem even late weeks ago Trump seeing COVID19 behind us turning corner, incorrect messaging making wearing masks unReplublican contributing surge Midwest.

Political leaders supporting masks, social distancing wearing masks absolutely critical reducing COVID19 infectious. never really lockdown, rich people hid working class people brought things. saw twitter think sums things pretty well. numbers reflect roughly infections happened 2 weeks ago almost action taken 2 weeks ago means even brutal reaction stop spread today numbers next 2 weeks would still increase. numbers already saying control scary upcoming weeks...  know mutation is? point proof people can't get re-infected. Claiming immunity proof dangerous lie. obese man already overcome it. many people healthier younger biden trump died? lot BS excuses tbh. think ""well see badge/ remember badge number strong jaw, grey stubble, thin flat nose..."" Kinda thing. Idk lot stress going on. I'm glad deal police I‚Äôm talking wearing masks think sick. buy masks, it‚Äôs forever always point on. COVID-19 never going away. COVID20 21 etc.... around corner moment. nation piecemealing whole situation. Wearing mask quarantining isn‚Äôt going fix anything. It‚Äôs help keep hospital beds open. 

On top facts, many people business usual vs rearranging life fit what‚Äôs ‚Äúbest humanity‚Äù.

By high density areas think first, New York, LA, Houston, Chicago, Miami. also pretty much town populated 500 persons. ya avoiding high density areas. it‚Äôs easy me. Natural herd immunity. really need stop calling ""let everyone get sick well stop getting sick"" herd immunity.  draw blood patients time learned ask clients ok around needles, blood, etc.. Tattoo artists worst üòÖüòÖ real thing. even news? there's change news?

Breaking News: Nothing happened! beginning. People act like Fauci hero, he's done beginning justify Trump's desire actually fight virus. follows middle-of-the-road actions though epidemiologists like gaming stuff like decades. knew going happen. knew get Trump listen. backed keep jobs modicum influence remained power, knew no-one sense would longer whispering ears charge strenuously argued Trump's so-called 'economy-saving' strategy. Meanwhile, instead using influence connections everything possibly could help, Fauci told us stay home wear masks *during important phase community spread could prevented.* abject failure epidemiologist AMERICAN. bad Trump.  Imagine cases per capita 3rd world shithole Agreed, young co-worker work told recently groups high-school students ""going trans"". stipulated students deciding change sexuality flippantly thought ""cool"" thing do. 

This one off, tried discuss like 10 minutes bring around thinking deeply it.

Unfortunately able to. 

I want come right say yeah that's bullshit would forced even ardent defense false premise. 

He's avid evangelist Rogan's podcast / show father. Maybe lot really shitty people world, whenever put people groups, gonna decent shot putting together shitty group. That's I've noticed. Yeah, USA scored high. study measure trust government policies. Period.  also reinventions chicken pox majority population doesn't. 

Inb4 ""but science different!!!""

Do know antibodies are? Killer cells memory? seen studies people coronaviruses caught covid much better outcomes immune systems recognized it? know lot it, comment portland part. feel like they'd use mask thing another way intimidate say ""oh jarvis"" idk there's probably solution somewhere. yeah fuck. presumed negative tests positive. story feelings own. mad edited reply again, bet lost weight since started shitting toilet country, exercise ever going get lol part NC get laughed wearing mask. stor/restaurants workers wear mask chains. odds someone mid 30s dying covid again? 5 new confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday.

The local domestic asymptomatic carrier detected Kashgar Prefecture. Kashgar Prefecture currently movement restriction full population PCR test way. Fauci must ""rebelling death psychotic"" too, since telling us risk minuscule wearing masks.   Yay us...!...? Yeah, helicopter air ambulance bills outrageously expensive. last checked, median cost one $36,000 2017. Medicare average bill $11000, still absurdly high.

I read story last year someone got billed $50,000 one, personally pay $11,000 even insurance. airlift cost lung transplant surgery did. (Edit - 2 - [here‚Äôs another someone billed $56,000 insurance covered $11,000 TLDR: 15 new imported cases, 0 new domestic cases, 18 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 1 new domestic asymptomatic carrier

Life stressful enough right Lmao. You‚Äôre stupid.  me, felt like jump deep end water gets waaaaaaaaay nose. Feels funny, sure, you‚Äôre fine two minutes later. Anyone wear mask brain aneurysm. Id dont wear mask reading this, hope everyone love gets brain aneurysm. adjust population increase. It‚Äôs almost comical putting tweet masking bites too! I‚Äôve saying since 2016. sides playing long ball harder ever. sides would watch country burn giving full powers. Everyone takes Vitamin supplements. 

Not sure ment, far everyone takes ""pure"" vitamin supplements. common food/drinks added vitamin though, like milk. possibility absolutely. absolute. Statistically even get still much higher chance survival death even though highest risk group. Trump high risk already overcome covid.

Keep reaching doe. US dozen cases March. mock time next year could 20 million reinfections.

It take long numbers rocket up. 

""it's flu, flu kills people year"" said, covid sprinted past. 

It's naivety caused covid get bad start with. it'll reason millions end catching twice people laugh fact people caught multiple times. shame early Fauci told Americans risk minuscule need masks, letting infection spread across population. Fauci still pushing flu vaccines back then, since, according him, flu much dangerous. joke. Yeah, hate one break governor, that's gonna happen. realize France US? Vasovagal response virtually blood draw IV.
My wife understand thinks I'm overreacting...tells man up. wish understood üòíüòí would tend agree you. addition, wanting know death certificate.

But, WHIO picture story dead student assume him. photo, look healthy. change many stories younger deceased Covid sufferers tell take care themselves.

Given time year vitamin levels drop loss 45+ degree sun angle. healthy people outcome death may become common. Thanks. Honestly go back forth lockdown. general stance things opened cautiously. Definitely shelter place orders, also don‚Äôt really think bars open. end day regulations federal government really it‚Äôs kind everyone choose tolerance risk. We‚Äôve seen clearly marathon, sprint, need find middle ground safe sustainably. I‚Äôm usually pretty far left don‚Äôt really tend towards centrist takes think need situation.
 
I personally don‚Äôt partake bars, restaurants, theaters, much anything really. say pretty confidently I‚Äôm stringent people point. visit museum September, masked course. Generally stay home visit partner twice week. first three months didn‚Äôt even see partner, literally leaving house all, simply could continue that. I‚Äôve literally lost friends refuse open circle anymore already have. probably won‚Äôt gathering friends another several months especially winter shaping pretty scary. Yes, it‚Äôs mentally hard me. extrovert honestly social distancing destroyed me. hate staying home, it. hate wearing mask, it. Always. Yes, vent thread. That‚Äôs part it‚Äôs for, it‚Äôs lot better constantly whining people IRL strangers online easily look posts. Yes working it, god year hasn‚Äôt perfect storm terms mental health getting bad. certainly don‚Äôt need asshat saying think I‚Äôm person pain, course I‚Äôm not. LOT people pain, think hard endless lockdown generally good idea. 

For it‚Äôs worth, blocked commander, hope me. upset pandemic upsetting simply don‚Äôt engage one another.

Sorry essay, figured I‚Äôd explain myself. 6 months longer many, honestly! friends son got married today met girl *4 months ago!* going headliner, we've listening warm bands. Metro population says like 860 Madison... surprisingly metro area Green Bay 320, Milwaukee close 1.5 million.

I‚Äôd compare Chicago metro area it‚Äôs 9.5 million, must include suburban town, even though it‚Äôs 30k doesn‚Äôt feel small. children school full time, 85% kids live Canada. people chose remote they‚Äôre exception (I never even considered quality instruction spring abysmal). 

And it‚Äôs totally fine. kids loving school happy back. We, like people live, weighed risks benefits felt mental health education outweighed statistically minimal risk covid poses.  end, vaccine allows burn mask go concerts it‚Äôs worth risk. It‚Äôll personal decision lot people...but people abandoning guidelines people waiting vaccine gauge that. kids it‚Äôs hard also work. it‚Äôs impossible I'm going bookmark this. Could happen? Yes. it, know. could everything gets control. People really getting used high numbers. 1000 deaths day normal life now. Many people care. sad. area Wisconsin, schools ""forced"" close opening back again. colder now. people inside. holiday comes next gets progressively family involved. Christmas, almost everyone celebrating families. boom! 2 weeks that, cases skyrocket already high baseline. January, even colder south too. Everyone packed little incubators. Rhode Island similar, think....huge increase testing since colleges came back steadily increasing positive cases since  mAsKs sHiT, sToP dEm prOpAGaNdA. ;) Yep, he's basically Mueller medicine. He's special interest fixer That‚Äôs neglect kids taken away. It‚Äôs excellent way avoid annoying in-laws. marketing campaign. control months. Also European countries much denser one would expect pandemic worse European countries. Oh racist, okay know lasting immunity? already confirmed cases re-infection. again, Trump supporters ignore science agree them. Yes simple copy paste makes mad lmao. Wow sure pwned me. Also forgot mention... Imagine cases per capita 3rd world shithole article already outdated? COVID Exit Strategy shows California ""Trending Poorly"", ""Caution Warranted"" anymore.

Edit: written 20th, explains discrepancy. Yes outdated, California worse along rest nation. Take note Americans implied much twice ""so still contract die?"" ""not treatments get outcome"". 

Playing dumb really work made attempt hide.  google ‚Äúmask studies‚Äù ‚Äúmask wearer protection studies‚Äù there‚Äôs lot good ones peer reviewed sources. It‚Äôs really interesting read yes pretty mad People armed resist arrest deserve shot police. if, possibly somewhere, someone decides self-medicate COVID-19? mild symptoms, hospitalization isn‚Äôt required, can‚Äôt someone quarantine themselves. People self medicate flu. What‚Äôs difference quarantining tested quarantine without tested? Speaking fellow Canadian, agree you. One part Covid fatigue, another part cold months ahead - going fall cliff unless stronger steps taken. ::rolls eyes:: LAZy want reward it. Fuck them. special treatment deserve punch nose that's stuck outside mask. grab go risky? Curb side delivery? could totally go good food. eaten restaurant food since March. :( wait get first birth certificate requesting long form one. like I've time travelled March again. back square one. hope deaths rise March levels otherwise fucked make sure take cough hand huge spikes undid it. undoing lockdowns restrictions leading spikes Yeah people demand schools reopen without mask wearing crazy. 

Universal masking way it‚Äôs even remotely possible school person, even community spread already way rampant much country. Lets open everything refuse lock even covid hospitalizations overwhelm . long can‚Äôt get treated broken leg let alone cancer due run hospitals? curious.

Do people really think refuse lock hospitals magically run covid?  ever thought possibility youre downvoted you‚Äôre ridiculous? trade Sams Club and. BJ‚Äôs Costco Trader Joe‚Äôs. **please** üò´ü§© 27% today iowa... shit show... everywhere, no. also cold now. full article case anyone can‚Äôt looked gut health?  tried sniffing glue?   Make business liable anyone catches COVID lack masks. It‚Äôd near impossible enforce, many businesses comply avoid hint liability. live wearing masks far many aren‚Äôt. Governor doesn‚Äôt seem bothered fact ICU beds full, Statewide shutdowns mask mandates implemented largest cities. Schools open State approaching 2,000 new cases per day. 

Fauci needs move past the, ‚Äúif‚Äù phase this. It‚Äôs time scream rooftops. pandemic treated like it‚Äôs nothing. understand everybody stay home. can't say ""the fearful stay home.""

That option lot people. ones can, need suck stay home. Stay home ones can't. past 1-2 weeks we‚Äôve Spain, France, Argentina, Colombia reach 1 million confirmed cases each. UK probably week obviously determined comprehend this.

Go look up. honestly would blame doctors straight quit let idiots deal rest themselves. think coronavirus exist something else making people sick? guess get get idiots elect. ‚Äúguidelines‚Äù ‚Äúrestrictions‚Äù?

The language headline article written make everyone mad. airport stuff security theater meant make Bush cronies lot money. 

A mask mandate actually saves lives. 

But agree you. thing start. fairly common people attack individual rather content called intellectually dishonest 

Actually attacking argument, you, argument presented nonsense. 

Claiming attack argument attack intellectually dishonest attacking person instead argument. 

Oh, hey, mister ""It's fairly common people attack individual rather content comments"" one said ""Yes reading hard""? mask falls somewhere jay walking already illegal, see problem wearing mask.

Not wearing mask illegal. That's problem. That's entire conversation about. People saying ""it mandatory wear mask"" someone claimed slippery slope. what? knows. seem agreement worse banning jay walking speeding.  Pink Eyed Pence?

no surprises Explain logic. not. sick people get tests, positive rate would 100 percent. healthy people stop scared quit getting tested, sick people get tests. rate positivity literally meaningless scare tactic. Healthy people get tests. Nice downvotes  Cleveland rocks Think past bedtime kiddo Mild? Look I've it. brother well. I've lost 5 friends 8 fucked even 6mo life. blame people like you. Let know mild someone care dies. Folks hate people kids tend forget someone else's kids once. way happens. susceptible population already hit pretty hard. immunity spreads vaccine becomes available, go even more. Fauci survived long top (36 YEARS!!!) without smart politically. knows good publicly get far President currently serving under. Knowing exactly done worthless power order it. Instead, Trump would fire install idiot like Scott Atlas. stfu dude. much don‚Äôt want win. Wishing death anybody terrible general. Colorado, whoever wondering. Near Denver think

Edit - Yeah, some. always research crap seller brand buy them. last pack bot seems legit masks bit big. Yeah pfft 1000 people day dying gives shit right? believe see read narratives thrown front us via media platforms. know, tough one. majority lost loved one. case, whole concensus would change. doesn‚Äôt matter Judy accounting bombs cubicle pass paperwork could sent via email coughing complaining ‚Äúallergies‚Äù cool story die guess. still proper prophylactic study

Lol

Maybe advise world experts studies 2 week old random noun random 3 numbers account already mask mandate  Thanks. Yeah, usually look brand too. one seemed legit Amazon $10 per mask. definitely cheaper. God answered: ""You fucking entitled prick, 8.7 million species earth."" Happy Cake Day! believe (because trust judgement know much provincial gov positions), 

The true state governments US strong center government hold things together awesome. 

Plus gotta love national healthcare. : - )!

It long ago Health-Care companies US killing people (denying coverage) profit. 

Or declining cover people would actually need care thus, cut profits.

 1 - 2 - Yes Ahhh yes, makes sense certainly right. direct rule open works same. I‚Äôm sorry? less 1% mortality rate. Bold say virus lasting immunity early little reinfections. Well, I'm ""reality check"". Unlike lot people, always think I'm right, think need compare notes will. know what, hope right isnt' big deal. hope one know dies winter. mean it. OC wear masks guy. Don‚Äôt let reddit source news  Tbh new tests also fucking terrible. hurt much, awful way - like getting paper cut inside nose...  Yep Says guy hiding behind screen. many businesses exactly?

*gets hospitalized covid gives family attends debate knowing hes infected (gets treatment tax payer dollar worth 900k)

Ok quack treatments cure corona like hydroxychloroquine? Thats also covid isnt dangerous.¬† Ok dangerous, experts wrong idiots,¬†  Might explain multiple gates. Maybe keep tickling Brain Well, that‚Äôs kinda point. Public health bylaws weak. Thanks  Can't. going write stimulus check family fed? want safe. want family safe. want? Notice trump got hospitalized covid didnt take quack treatments selling

No thats you, actually takes 900k scientifically sound treatment Hope grandfather feel better Biden campaign promised announce results every test took couple weeks ago. bet they'll continue election least. know live, major city, extensive contact foreigners people travelled often, Covid March. People forget flu also disease make feel pretty nasty quite while. last one went deep felt like checking left sinus via right. still people entering country, rest world still it, course going occasional cases, caught overseas, Probably won‚Äôt last either round infections Well yeah everyone fucking wears mean honestly person embarrassing. I‚Äôve gotten five tests, three brain pokey types. It‚Äôs fun, wore someone says test. relative guess still community spread throughout state.

And daily reports people right thing California.

Not quite selfish stupid Midwest something tho. We've little problem sending people prison smoking weed, fining people wearing mask pandemic somehow unjust many. doubt. One county highschools called ""Hempfield"" you, restaurants considered essential businesses, along everything else thing linked affected shut down. Furthermore, never commented iowa shut yet still plummeting economy. suit narrative ignore that? C'mon make reason I'm sure. It‚Äôs far far late. fatigue settled it‚Äôs beyond control. masses hit limits.

The anti-maskers great numbers. Social distancing window. Restaurants packed inside, 20-30 minute waits inside seating (in area I‚Äôm Texas).

I really don‚Äôt think average person even comprehend US facing come Dec Jan.

The show hasn‚Äôt even started yet.

I‚Äôm hoping least handful people actually read listen scientists media idea what‚Äôs coming best protect family. Nope. miserable 18 I'm happy 35  get meds friend, get better Canada informal economy New Zealand don't? outcomes different. Dude literally 2 months ago. related all.  disgusted this.

Things really spiral control fast you‚Äôre standing inflection point curve front graph going almost straight arnt wearing mask get 1200 dollar fine, easy geting parking ticket. threat taking someones money enough make wear mask. I'm gonna hope pantry, never know afraid death Britney? explanation neurotic behavior. mortal Britney. Accept this. Remember woman hung manafort jury thought reflected trump?

This exact thing, coached administration husband's parents going pissed.

However, avoiding death important us. get 2K without needing test positive. Although like idea needing get tested order qualify regardless outcome. seem recall articles researchers lamenting Sweden developed country left kids school spring failed keep solid data could use. had, could actual data go assumptions fall. Instead, not. reply me? they're vietnam good think south koreans proud response. wasnt even comparing ROK others region people think way control virus authoritarian capitalist state happens red flag. thailand Monday cases 40K range due weekend effect. However 7 day average dropped 40% peak.

We see 30k cases soon next 2 weeks. First wave said stays 20k cases 2 weeks. 

Overall infection rate nearing 16% think. didnt mean imply mental healthcare problems arnt there, im saying solution let virus run country without plan next 3, 6, 12 months; never provide additional mental health support. gonna (hopefully) one brutal years society while.

I dont think could coped isolation currently overseas, first half year fucked brutal. thankfully relatively normal since.

The mental health problems covid there, isolation much started seeing psychologist. I'm saying better solution squash virus pay anyone country 20 free/subsidies zoom psychology sessions get it. Californians aren‚Äôt wearing masks elevators . It‚Äôs pissing off.  mention wealthy is, great social safety net, large numbers able work home 50% folks Stockholm live alone!

We hard lockdown month so. mandatory mask compliance time. sucked. it, demographically old population, people knew would happen.

The lockdown stopped infections cold. implemented quarantine anyone coming region.

We near 100% mask compliance single digit daily cases, travel related.

It worked, imagine that?

This whole mess could brought control technique, people want that, claim impossible.

So infection spreads.

and spreads.

and spreads. time anything else Maybe he'd healthier think Agree  goes religions... God! There's zero proof. Therefore, wake help fight pandemic instead enabling it. Mitch McConnell knows what's lol. He's one takes seriously. He's evil stupid. coming Detroit right either, surrounding cities west side state. fucked. run COVID tests job often questioned nurses swab type use collection procedure 

The answer almost always nasopharyngeal (the deep one) unless person tested asymptomatic outpatient. Oh agree you. I‚Äôm definitely minority. like look mask like miserable-to-wear clothing item like bra, belt, high heels.  Makes easier stomach never get point  true give hope working vaccine since lasting antibodies exactly vaccine must produce. Fortunately, it‚Äôs true. Thats invisible virus barrier meaning covid can't reach satellite communities /s

I wish joking, ppl really seem believe it. Funny thing is, people saying makes afraid. people wanna wear condom. means definitely need one avoid them. look total deaths health issues over.. ever. solution might herd immunity, getting fast possible might best strategy. know yet. know retrospect. side that‚Äôs pretending isn‚Äôt happening comment favour churches open restrictions then? kudos you. personally don‚Äôt believe 99% people would hold that. wanted save live across America could also advocate universal speed limit 30 mph driving would save tens thousands American lives we‚Äôre it. noted North Dakota currently 737 weekly cases per 100k, highest state higher country, signs stopping. Masks make difference.

Staying home minimizing contact make difference. Masks help, also effect making people go much, they're pain.

Sadly, nobody wants make harder choices, curves go up.

South Dakota country, would number three world terms ‚Äúactive infections‚Äù. get feeling lot people USA (my country) wild-west fantasy want zero interaction control government, minute get sick they‚Äôd want medical care. That‚Äôs catch I‚Äôve barely seen mentioned people. forget whole time, issue hasn‚Äôt whether virus kill precisely, whether it‚Äôll overwhelm hospitals. It‚Äôs medical system crisis, Black Plague. issue never recognized people. 

The issue Wild-West fantasy radical individualism (while still following herd) eroded American government extent even leaders incompetent things would need chance. 

I mentioned someone, living foreigner South Korea time, feel far safety freedom would home right now. lockdowns, almost everyone page virus works contain it, care would cheap reliable catch virus. 91-year old grandfather died disease past Tuesday. religious wife still indoor funeral amongst community limited trust concept basic preventative measures. stupid.

Summer (June - August)

Autumn (September - December)

Winter (January - February) bad - mental health dark Victorians enough Yep that's exactly happened sunbelt wave - new case records set lowest deaths US since March - weeks later surged well, really damn obvious coming. Lolz 30mph. Hyperbole full speed ahead would argue since routines Stockholm eldery home horrible years, way virus got eldery homes little much society would lock schools restaurants. death toll would likely much lower total lockdown. India bad compare Africa Shortening quarantine 10 days without test (before everyone tested sometimes lasted 30-40 days due infections house) one two things we've changed - reopening schools - cases exploded Poland. Apparently Swedes ok sacrificing lives elderly still go bar shift care home ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è tests waiting come back negative (reported ABC News). Hopefully hear something tomorrow. rhetoric r/Melbourne seems forgotten original timeline. Thanks sensible comment! really compare Sweden countries though.

You one highest death count per. million **entire world**

Great logic. Compared neighbouring countries, Europe, Sweden‚Äôs strategy general approach definitely ‚Äúrelaxed‚Äù.  


You compare Denmark current situation. Equal number new cases per capita two countries (though Sweden significantly hospitalised). Denmark decreasing max number people gathering 10. Sweden increases 300. Yes modelled pandemic rate cases dropping seemed indicate higher level immunity population, indicated antibodies.

Its possible modelling wrong forms immunity top antibodies.

As governments fucked up. Western countries worse others. Five confirmed currently. Bad idea. outbreak Australia started kid went school day 10 11 quarantine tested positive day 11 (but day 2) really politics boiled to? really embarrassing. you‚Äôve killed many elderly smooth sailing. Congratulations!

/s matter fact, not. rare, ""astronomically"" low likelihood. goes death. willingness cooperate one part. seasonal effect spread virus another, spreading fast now. 

The governments wrestling several problems. One part people complying regulations. Compliance generally highest people largest risk, either health perspective economic perspective. people complying either lower risk, perceive risks worth mitigating. makes hard influence behaviour group. 

A full scale lockdown hit everyone hard. big impact people already motivated comply measures probably less effect people comply yet. impact people already complying, measures backfire reduce support government intervention. feel like punishment group, instead punishment group misbehave.

Another problem legal limits governments do. Really effective measures often impact constitutional rights. means new laws need created grant powers government specific situation. legally complicated situation, rightly so. 

Some countries successful fighting virus governments impose far reaching measures without right checks balances. benefit used fight virus, time seen work population situations.

The successful countries, far see, either special circumstances (e.g. close borders), citizens great trust government follow advice given, government much unchecked power.

And course, taking account, successful less successful countries governments. Errors made continue made. Mostly really tough crisis. Huh, integrity actual transparency, unlike ‚Äúit‚Äôll come two weeks‚Äù Trump. Laughs/cries UKs ‚Äòeat help out‚Äô scheme mutates. mutation mild. reason reinfections antibodies stay long enough. reason confirmed reinfections always different strain way confirm strain. accepting numbers. know much Singaporean government. testing? trustworthy? state city Australia recorded 1k day, fuck getting from? I'm Melbourne alone like 700+ worst day. Yes, normal work. work distribution centre agree. variable, risk wise, virus diffuse none covid there.
Given numbers doubt that's case. NZ's lockdown significantly strict Melbourne's fuckin' got it. Honestly kind fond memories now.

Longer - can't argue that, Melbourne one hell long lockdown. Much respect everyone there. Please see figure 1 anyone seen something similar, done countries ""excess deaths"" similarly clear way? 

It's often suggested consequences full lock severe directly covid related deaths.

So, would interesting see whether full lock restrictions have, not, lead significant increase ""excess deaths"" equivalent period countries.

""Excess deaths"" countries employed stringent lock measures, minimal deaths would make interesting comparison. never mentioned Taiwan tho.. overly negative anything many relatives well 60s older best health don‚Äôt want risk exposing it‚Äôs also possible someone else something else kill them. Ah, catch 22 seems like tv show now. surprise states support trump also ones cases  horrendous death rate Ok mostly elderly people died could go bar whenever pleased? October 21, Sweden stood 15th grim global ranking list Covid-19 deaths per capita, fifth Europe, Belgium, Italy, Spain, UK. tally 581 deaths per million people many times Germany, Norway, Denmark Finland. Getting worse confirmed case count 63 Saturday Malaysia, legal entries tested quarantined automatically. tourists allowed, inter province travel banned big risk areas. dinner Obama once. shook other's penises dry bathroom.

Then later found Obama. know what? I'm ok it. importantly % contacts finding? outside seems low % Yeah, second wave could easily twice worse first wave lockdown like yesterday. Nope. Sorry.

Yeah maybe. possible near number anyways, testing capacity asymptomatic people. Nobody really knows healthy people stop scared quit getting tested, sick people get tests.

Okay genius, know person healthy without getting tested? know COVID caught spread asymptomatically right? citizen Fascist States Trump, envy New Zealanders. \*pained smile\* Taiwan? Last Wednesday midnight lockdown brought in. allowed travel 5km (3.1 miles) home unless essential. 

Due last 6 weeks, November. Well, doubts Triage full effect several western countries go smooth ""oh well, old people dying, nvm then"" .... usually other, younger people attached older folks get pretty uppity loved ones left die, ""ICUs capacity"" means everyone fucked.

On 19 March government closed borders non-residents NZ. NZ residents citizens could return, 2 weeks self-isolation.

Eventually quarantine hotels would managed military, closely guarded prevent escapes second wave positive cases community would ordered go quarantine hotel, would close contacts. utterly blown away lack contingency planning happened El Paso apparently Abilene well.

I've lived NZ Norway frankly prefer NZ, including nature-wise, assuming cards order. poor New Zealand much worse situation poor Norway. possible. they're projecting crappy parent experience others, no? Masks final solution COVID problems. Neither Norway Finland mandatory mask wearing.

Tegnell saying stage make much difference. also said might helped used earlier, point evidence support it.

And no, force restrictions law, Swedes adults need treated like brats follow recommendations. Seems like something would work interest copper companies realise Covid March, right? New Zealand, South Korea countries people love cite islands. New Zealand land border country border South Korea Japan ... North Korea, guarded border, akin island.

That's true. Sweden failed. Many Swedes forums can't admit it. There's always new excuse.

But emergency care numbers! Oh wait elderly care homes used triaging. GDP! Oh wait nothing impressive. excess deaths!

Where Tegnellists try move goal posts next? \*Money whoring capitalism. algorithms designed perfectly considering system exist. society ok one group burning buildings cause create slippery slope. never tolerate anarchy regardless cause. trying normalize 800 people dying every day big deal? OC conservative cities moderate cities, liberal cities though (maybe except county seat). live moderate city mask use 90%. Wrong. recent comprehensive study says ~0.25%. Test capacity quite issue well due politics test labs. Every poll mask wearing shows 90-95% people wearing masks lines personal observation.

Wear mask. Social distance. Wash hands. Give hospitals best chance. 

Even shithole countries practice herd immunity. current wave driven small social gatherings. Restaurants. Bars. They're essential victims brings economy owners. 

No one pay die. differs greatly like anywhere.. know colleagues get tested find much hassle, general people get tested since incentive apart selfish. (Employers even obligated continue paying wages people positive waiting testing)

Tho, people symptoms get tested even contact someone tested positive. non symptomatic people strongly advised(practically obligated can't enforced law) self quarantine 10 days(again employers continue pay wages) ***Your mask may protect them. mask may protect you.***

This directly CDC website. Cloth masks meant protect others said. cloth mask may provide adequate protection someone wearing mask infected sneezes coughs you. They'll follow rules Bible, too. tattoo?

But focusing regulation only: 
Bans public gatherings 50ppl, closings bars night clubs (table service allowed only) halved capacity restaurants (due distance restrictions tables). Closed schools 14 including universities. Swedish restrictions (regulated).
*Effectively* regulation also meant closed museums, cinemas similar 

I‚Äôm sure agree Norwegian Danish ones much restrictive, especially practice. Yep, agree problem end day, ridiculous rhetoric coming White house others. Medical professionals scientists pretty much shunned away, reporters tell truth called ""fake news"" we've got situation folks clue believe.

I think virus could easily begin factory farm America. got challenge us vs mentality whenever possible obviously don‚Äôt understand happened Europe virus took US Fuckin priorities.

Bars gyms first foremost remain shutdown. 

The mask thing tough teeth it. Governor wanted though could actually allow law enforcement cite people breaching this. Hell, make policy bar owners paid (and required keep staff paid) proceeds mask fines.

I get base poisoned point trickier resolve. still think intelligent policy could occur try limit impact wide lockdown still helping. Like, retail business done mask need shut go around. No, ‚ÄòRounding corner‚Äô going back started. Masks alone anything, keeping virus ""in"" getting all. masks, important wash disinfect hands get home whenever touch rest body speak. That's shaking hands bad idea, even masks since times forget might scratch itch nose something similar.    

Of course better protected though, combination mostly make impact well.

The answer *right there* comment replied without reading, right beginning, clear day.

""not sex trafficking reckless driving.""

^ Right there.

Are antagonistic purpose honestly know ""victimless crime"" means? means crime either harms one harms person it, like using certain drugs charging money sex. include reckless driving, ignoring mask mandates, participating human trafficking.

I can't put simply that. droplet spread airborne. Droplet spread primary mechanism, airborne concern ventilators. Depends. live people weak immune systems? overweight/chubby? unable wear mask, use gloves, wash hands? answered questions you‚Äôve wasting time. Yeah sure, totally believable flu cases dropped 98%, illness also nearly identical symptoms keeps mysteriously flaring up.

If still believe everyone testing positive COVID-19 actually COVID-19, gullible moron. obvious flu cases counted COVID cases, either design accident. First infectious, ill. apart tracing isolation, selective pressure become less deadly.

Some scientists hope random mutations make less functional time, beginning scientific discussion.

As long people keep large-scale transmission rate 1, new strains spread. Yup. going slaughter Three shall number households number households shall three. Four thou have, neither shall two unless proceeding three. Five right out. 


Look, follow science (except govt makes shit up). closed dance clubs right Ferragosto, actually. Yeah right point out. imagine statement probably remains true fungi well many Kardashians America take hospitals completely overrun? Scientific data research isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe press‚Äù tho.  Ya learn read beyond surface good day you. problem desperately trying find good bad faith comment lol I'm border Otago Southland, t-shirts one weekend snow next... It‚Äôd better make claims without knowing facts. looking it, seems actually exceedingly rare. handful reinfections 38 million infections. 17% positivity rate. means actual number could 150 thousand cases, f\*cking Sunday. thought France cannot surprise anymore last days damn Like makes much better, still equivalent 180,000 US cases Evidence? What's population there, what's count deaths?

I maths Germany: Herd immunity would cost 440 000 used pessimistic numbers, 166 000 optimistic. Add zero get US. Yes image nice photo it. Another reason get virus! Infections can‚Äôt treated. China, Vietnam, DPRK, Laos, Cuba. great job protecting people. Big respect countries forfeit small bit economic growth favour people's lives. testing, laxer attitudes COVID, previously untouched parts US getting hit, colder weather causing indoor gatherings. meanwhile back country origin, 91k cases total according world statistics.  So, there‚Äôs that. No, positive rate hasn‚Äôt gone either, clearly enough. problem number positive cases means nothing compared number people tested.

So say 1 positive test yesterday 10 positive tests today. would think it‚Äôs spiking, right? Well told tested 100 people yesterday 1000 today? That‚Äôs spike.

People getting upset I‚Äôm saying coronavirus isn‚Äôt problem everything fine.
I‚Äôm saying reporting positive cases doesn‚Äôt necessarily tell us it‚Äôs spiking testing people. wish point unfortunately seems are. Hopen I'm wrong couple lame ducks right thing. 

Ultimately heavy hit states need buck begin admitting things done help curb numbers. 2,800,000 x 0.05= 140,000 *in terms confirmed cases only*

Death counts far better, really don‚Äôt know many cases could confirmed first wave since bound testing capacity. 

Just important context keep mind schools. pediatrician good data this. Please stop spreading far, schools seem stoking community transmission coronavirus, according data emerging random testing United States Britain. Elementary schools especially seem seed remarkably infections. Maybe vsauce wrong (likely) stay inside indefinitely easy issue strict lockdown year waiting vaccine, reopen, could probably eradicate virus.

The thing is, however, policy would practically enforceable. would people endorse it. humans, mindless survival robots. Lol. think first wave never ended. like Western leaders terrible giving shit 

Asia + NZ much better definitely havent wasted time far, much closer vaccine knows many lives saved vector. Also better treatments now. Candida auris bacteria - actually fungus. wanted mention sake accuracy. easier spread national plan americans proud wear masks. everywhere now, came matter point. went whole hog p100 respirator ($30), replaceable filters ($12/pair). Filters supposed last month. nice glasses fog up. Naturally, cover exhale valve cloth mask. first I'm hearing this, I'd love see source corroborate. Also China much better contact tracing western countries (where they've given up). bad joke lol winter holidays spread perfectly spreading virus. 1 month month apart. Perfect people catch one holiday bring next potentially. gonna compounding. Gonna rough winter. invalidate point? replace hand shaking spitting other‚Äôs mouths? voted Biden, casted mail ballot days ago. Hey long stay home another year max minimal human contact, especially live alone what's problem? :) easy cause averse issues :) It‚Äôs thing recession. current admin trying little possible let death wave happen right potential Biden victory attempt pass blame scary thing people won‚Äôt get tested. access free testing basically whenever want. take advantage frequently sure I‚Äôm putting anyone risk. Someone else know similar access basically refuses get tested. Guess one us goes (massless) friends constantly one us stays home. answer shock you. Wait, think calling third wave spin something?

Building sinusoidally 80k 30k extended period time textbook definition wave. experts said believed agency ask companies wait safety data. said agency‚Äôs current guidelines, require two months safety data volunteer received last dose vaccine, good enough. Collecting longer-term data would allow evaluate potential risks, whether immunity virus wanes months, whether rare side effects emerge.

You're trolling, quit behind. Cthulhu coming? I'm Germany idea closed borders yet.  Coronavirus viral family. strains. different ""species"" within family. 7 known species 20% common cold cases caused coronavirus (other 80% generally rhinoviruses). influenza virus coronavirus, orthomyxovirus, separate family separate virological characteristics way determine based flu seasonal due hidden variables (it's like comparing apples bananas). 2003 SARS virus could related, necessarily strain (the two could've mutated two different coronaviridae). MERS virus likely related per say developed outside China camels one vector different strain. Strains subsets original virus symptoms, undergo mutations. MERS would likely much different RNA sequence (including silent mutations) opposed actual separate strain COVID19 may SNPs reduce virility (that perhaps alter protein confirmations resulting subpar, functional protein reduced function). One way ticket. We‚Äôre hoping you‚Äôll stick guns deny treatment contract it. would believe china mishandled previous epidemics exact way? 

I'm sure referring here. anyone said believe China? authoritarian system government decisions take place behind closed doors without public scrutiny, facts narratives changed suit political current day. There's reason ""believe"" them.

However, look actions took, simply fact decisive action taken severity situation became clear. Wuhan lockdown sudden, brutal, outrageous, country world imposed quite level lockdown Wuhan authorities January. undeniably cold naked truth worked, allowed life Wuhan indeed across China return ""normal"".

I'm sure basing timeline - sourced? According [BBC local Wuhan authorities already aware ""pneumonia unclear cause"" end December. CCP officials discussed virus meeting 7 January, publishing genome virus 9 January. 20 January evidence human-to-human transmission observed confirmed. **State media first mentioned coronavirus public 21 January, Wuhan entered lockdown 23 January.**

In moment aren‚Äôt highest per capita, clearly don‚Äôt care. Well okay, population density entire countries often misleading then. feel like kind obvious that's talking friend lives Paris telling people still kissing cheek greeting. Like... think people would adapt. :) Many states New York New England states restrict interstate travel requiring self-quarantine people higher risk states. However, there's enforcement. government checking people state borders. There's monitoring. announce media expect people comply.

Just add: restrictions changed people's travel plans. change travel plan New England coasts RI got put restrictions list. know people cancelled trip New York state got put NY's list. honor system works everyone honorable. we've seen pandemic, large numbers people honorable. one drug resistant.

Drug resistant bacteria going become increasingly common next years Wow, think I've seen someone else recommend Ishmael long, long time.

I found book \~15 years old early 2000s really became lens understanding world truly entering into.

Hello, fellow Friend Ishmael! Get job grocery store something Both. Always both. symptom sure. little compassion top could help encourage others considerate may optimistic point.

Research shows truth say. look lots studies showing millenials narcissistic compared previous generations, contend mirroring behaviour encountered development. Society took hard turn towards draconian social measures 80s (when Millenials born). Hence push longer jail terms criminalization previously normal behaviour (and bigger jails accommodate influx). ""Innocent proven guilty"" joke, opportunities redemption disappeared society. laws Millenials helped craft 80s 90s.
The 80s also ""pull bootstraps"" re-emerged oft repeated phrase one imagine reality difficult own-- admit otherwise might obligate us share wealth opportunity therefore easier believe poor people responsible poverty. Nah. positive comment. don‚Äôt recall happening. Two months ago south outbreak spreading Midwest. Schools re-opened abroad April May. don‚Äôt remember cases taking across Europe - you?  Right, think biggest difference eastern western approach contact tracing. key containing virus getting low amount spread masks, social distancing, lockdowns necessary (only need gets bad west), consistent serious contact tracing quarantine measures spread becomes managed. Also, quarantine measures overseas travelers important too.

That‚Äôs South Korean approach whole time. issue USA (it‚Äôs I‚Äôm from, I‚Äôm sure Europe) people resisted contact tracing, masks, lockdowns, even international travel regulations. basically least one group time resisting one preventative measures. would say 40% Americans still think hoax election. communist utopias taiwan ROK handled well? That‚Äôs interesting (and sad) restaurants haven‚Äôt adapted. 

I‚Äôm Italy right now, never eat restaurants order out... except pizza, always has, still does, deliver. Delicious, Napolitana style. Right door, delivery guy wears mask. 

So 98% food comes store. Since recent uptick, we‚Äôve stopped family outings store (for exercise, get outside), instead, wife goes. We‚Äôre wearing N95 masks cloth masks. longer take walks centro, rather non-crowded streets small, historic town. 

We‚Äôve basically adopted own, extreme level lockdown protocol, mandated so. 

Also, packages delivered sit quarantine 48 hours open handle without masks.

Edit: also homeschool work home. Oh US... expect third (or fourth?) wave Halloween/Election day. Remember week ago two aides Kamala Harris tested positive, and... it. outbreak team apparently stopped there. 

Almost like masks social distancing work something. really think fearmongering. Lasting sterilizing immunity probably achievable. coronavirus. However reinfection probably result mild symptoms. virus stay, fearmongering say that. Interesting totally predictable ""Very normal cool"". I'm Britney fan soundd exactly like Brit Brit talking. Also person asked why: people required get work. get tested month per DDS regulations entrance work theres masks, gloves, sanitizer thermometer. take temp door higher 99.9 arent allowed in. Yep, stupid. Tbf reduced capacity seated tables 6 less, 'normal' operation. nightclubs either.

Pubs necessarily driving huge amounts transmission either. household/family settings mostly.

I know I've downvoted shit, hope I'm wrong, starts. guess wait see. They're hotspots... happen California, man led protests around country (seems posting name political enough get comments deleted) John Lewis two referencing. Pure selfishness. idea liberty means detriment others long standing badge honor many Americans. Cain's Twitter still tweeting virus never hurt anyone. 

lol post EVERYWHERE.....that 1st paragraph especially...well said~ ""Rounding Corner"" - yep... see it: contactless delivery (very low risk; zero airborne risk)&lt;&lt;&lt;(contact delivery curbside pickup)&lt;pre-ordered takeout&lt;takeout&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;outdoor dining&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;indoor dining risk levels, based primarily upon airborne transmission.

Yes I'm sure ""trip"" saw represented everyone Italy everywhere times anything where/how virus anyone know think cases arising from?

What matter somebody Reddit *thinks* cases coming from? value ""information""? Spring 2021 anything. infected COVID-19 May unknowingly interacted COVID-19 positive person week ago. got tested result negative. Idk immunity last long looks so. Feel better...sorry can't give answers ~ ...Nope. based [asymptomatic case reported earlier Kashgar Prefecture (as 2017) 4.5 million residents.

Also, girl tested positive hospital, fine, symptoms, close contacts isolated. 

Her case discovered routine testing, source still investigated. fucking support fucking federal government

Wrong country, friendo much days really. used provide detailed updates infected people updates say certain area dealt with. call text you‚Äôve place. past month two QR scanners use go large coffee shops, many places sign sheets use entering call you.

The phone tracking thing far mostly done major clusters people weren‚Äôt coming forward get tested quarantine, like gay club couple mega churches. offered free anonymous testing people wanted hide whereabouts families workplaces didn‚Äôt want quarantine situations. times remember government clearly coming saying would track phone data certain areas times. 

I‚Äôve South Korea since start say I‚Äôve never felt intruded anyone. Masks mandatory sign-in sheets fever checks everywhere, information every little detail government‚Äôs response made public every day they‚Äôve managed avoid even single lockdown. Still 400 deaths here. area around apartment Paris, quite bars tried offering plates veggies whatever fact shuttered, experiment last long. working class families tend conservative, believe Trump anti-mask nonsense, beyond desperate keep schools open literally cannot afford child care services.

this insane thing I've ever read lmao. think working class people US support trump? think know US working class looks like. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Another part divide covid. bigger houses suburb lives ‚Äúget away‚Äù gatherings far easily dense areas. work EREA, sort special needs school students difficulties kind (socio-economic, disorders, etc...). 
The current policy individual quarantine equally harmful students. One unable attend family tested positive, one member family intensive care. 
So schoolmates school, way learning anything since late september. important exam year, honestly fear bound fail due COVID directly.

And similar stories many students. one revealing inequalities.

Though agree would stupid close schools nothing else. one thing needs closed restricted, large shopping centres. ...... goes show

you can't L W F R E

of whatever germ comes along Yep. mean that‚Äôs mathematical model says least. say around 380 million people already infected virus India. Yeah, tapering antidepressants beginning 2020 asked doc put back pandemic really got bad. mean math? Seems like getting little ahead move. Yes, think too. way contain virus go first minute. wonder apply country Stop fear mongering. truth people comfortable reading.

Even vaccines effective, think enough people going take stop disease.

The world start going vertical part infection curve. 

Sigh. I‚Äôd willing trust government compared leader free worlds government guess think that's good excuse potentially get people sick completely unnecessary act. something family would ever able live ourselves.

Boha, ludia na Slovensku su totalne jebnuti. Ok take 70%, 140k dead youths virus that's handled way better nations far less prepared supposed be. that, like 46 9/11s kids?

Are fucking psychopath? may...once get enough spread community potentially mutates. people go whole island thing. majority international travel air. countries outbreaks illegal border crosses... First all, spreading virus unnecessarily certainly help businesses. importantly hurt people, front line workers, health care personnel overwhelm hospital systems. balance eating restaurant saving fellow human being...that seems like easy choice decent people. Second all, pay taxes...our government subsidizing businesses workers stay closed... whole entire point paying taxes is...and Third, must eat restaurant food, takeout...do delivery. pretty simple. ok spreading virus unnecessarily community. That's reason eliminated virus, never lot non-detected cases one isolated nation. example, locked march 25 50 cases/day growing around 90 early april. Compare quebec locked march 21 (indoors gathering banned date, gyms, restaurants, schools, etc closed much earlier) 42 cases/day 99235. \-Upto 3 months -check

\-upto 6 monhs - check

\-upto 7 months -check

next landmark- upto 1 year hopefully(well know march 2021). wearing masks choose mean""Give liberty give death"", means **are selfish stupid person.** mean that‚Äôs eventually happens virus like yeah countries (if all) took aggressive measures cases started increasing able contain virus (e.g. NZ, China, South Korea). sooner reacted sooner contained virus. Lets mince words. weeks following Thanksgiving, lot people going get sick. Thousands die. going get much worse.. hope I'm wrong. right meow It‚Äôs isolation facility need swipe cards access areas hence trace contact zones two people back specific area Schoolchildren returned school around April across world. data looking elementary school children reported China back March. paper Science Spring describing this. thing happening US every country world surprising. Eh, even limited opt-in system would better nothing. Every bit helps.

Also Korean one lot different Chinese version. transparent what's done how. yeah, privacy friendly even though names redacted people often figure who's who.  lockdown worth small percentage.  Cause trump going contest election (or steal outright) he's encouraging white supremacist supporters commit terrorism behalf. 

Also Putin probably go electrical grid winter, treasonous GOP help him. Except California stops education stated rules.

Thus households don‚Äôt decide eat outside distance whatever, we‚Äôre relying self select right. Yikes.

Way better directly educate what‚Äôs best everyone talk things better aren‚Äôt going follow along completely... going plenty people course. already see thanksgiving weekend photos packed airports airplanes... thought weren‚Äôt really restrictions. advice agree. I'm sure enough capacity take patients come January States start closing non-mandatory businesses. Yeah bad China's probably telling truth one asymptomatic case ü§£ 40 million Indians infected seriously doubt they're anywhere near herd immunity. CDC seroprevalence surveys found 10 percent United States population, 30,000,000 Americans COVID-19 still spreading like wildfire here. idea could explain India's falling infection rates. Yeah, people Sweden feel current restrictions strict. **States Religious Philosophical Exemptions School Immunization 50 states legislation requiring¬†specified vaccines students.¬†Although exemptions vary state state, school immunization laws grant exemptions children medical reasons. ***There 45¬†states Washington D.C.¬†that grant religious exemptions people religious objections to¬†immunizations.*** Currently, 15¬†states allow philosophical exemptions object immunizations personal, moral beliefs.

But infection virus merely matter *life death*:

It's one top 5 tourist cities California... someone works retail NJ fight people constantly keep mask let alone wear right. 100k cases day week next week. going suck Imagine living whole life knowing grandma died took mask school. absolute chaos would cause worth matter what. Biden still leader nation without sworn in, I'll take influence president elect waves domestic terrorism go support people want wear masks. support ppl don't. wearing masks helpful, people wearing masks safe. enough?

So small businesses die, big business suffer little, proportionally win gain market share -- family restaurants go bust, chains left standing, sort thing. stock markets looks good shape, actually -- constituents gained proportionally rest economy (and proportionally truly matters -- money zero value, especially even physically printed; claim real physical wealth, value always relational). 

Of course, overall economy thoroughly fucked, parts taking real hit measured stock market. 

But necessarily mean stock market measuring properly. 

The mistake people make (and deception politicians love push them) equate economy. fear mongering

(yesterday biggest single day new cases US)

Take care now!

edit - article applies you: somebody high risk take vaccine, they've made choice give shit spreading virus anymore. Masks soon vaccine available high risk folks. going ask they've done, even really power though? Trump could easily come ask cult wear masks. chooses to. Imagine that. say like government regulations impact public health. You‚Äôve invented imaginary person doesn‚Äôt exist. numerous reports medical professionals reprimanded even dismissed wearing mask work, deemed spread panic

This also occurred hospitals Canada US leading March weeks pandemic finally called. 

Most countries well early on. lucky. Makes question agendas leaders. believe due incompetence. takes three weeks get ‚Äúresults ‚Äú #defundthepolice  ppl refuse practice preach. talk compassion, none. talk helping one another yet continue selfish put lives danger. 

they christians. they're putting needs front protecting around them. joking? lot depression people experiencing right extremely situational. Yes, suppose something exercise stay social media you, many legitimate reasons depressed right one ANYTHING about. experiencing hell earth right now, everyone legitimately trying best, sorry, depression due fucking pandemic economic devastation isn‚Äôt something simply of. 

Yes, understand it‚Äôs frustrating people aren‚Äôt taking pandemic seriously, ‚Äúgotta live life‚Äù crew isn‚Äôt really i‚Äôve seeing complain depressed. people see talking mental health effects one following guidelines are, well, depressing. I‚Äôm sure particular grievance is? people general find pandemic depressing? assholes exist? don‚Äôt know, dude. that? There‚Äôs also parents enough foresight prepare earlier year learn tighten belts order keep children safe. everyone victim circumstance. virus highly contagious, beat early, really easy get control.

My guess:

* Heavy measures summer opened ability travel relax bit.
* Travel increased holidays. Limited restrictions cross-border travel.
* People got bit sloppy due low infection rates covid fatigue.
* Colder weather: People spend time indoors
* Mitigating efforts slow, various reasons

Predictions already Q1 2020 showed pre-covid modelling expected number peaks would continue vaccine introduces herd immunity. Vote too. Didnt DR. Farcie say masks needed wear them? Still trumps fault? Vote out.  metrics become useless become target. color?. White color know. course know dems left pandemic handbook tossed disregarded completely. one said anything ‚Äúwhat dems do‚Äù go that‚Äôs you‚Äôd like. Wow whole dozen millions infections... place opened schools month ago massive surge cases right now? agree extent. new vaccine platforms going work get virus demonstrates strong antibody dependent enhancement. G-d wills it. bars serve food shut down, ones serve food basically restaurants treated close 10, restrictions operate like restaurants (e.g. can't order bar must remain seated groups six fewer only, meaning dancing milling about, etc.). rather complicated I'm glad I'm industry right now, rules keep changing becoming restrictive complex continue (for example, three weeks ago requiring anyone eats inside provide contact information restaurant). again, article far different sensationalist headline. Yes, you‚Äôre white COPD, working grocery store still access. No, healthy person color working home white collar job shouldn‚Äôt get priority. much Europe locked-down, Sweden went different plan, data suggests country‚Äôs relaxed approach didn‚Äôt work

Pretty bold statement considering Europe right show much larger spread Sweden. Also, bit premature try crown winners losers beginning second wave. Question 

If test positive everyone household automatically reported positive. 
1 test = 5 positive reported Weird. I‚Äôm nurse isolation unit major city Florida haven‚Äôt seen positive month.

Cases don‚Äôt matter people get hospitalized, people get mild symptoms, all. Well everyone could wear good mask, would help COVID Exit Strategy map outlook gets worse every time look it. Nearly entire middle 3/4ths country uncontrolled spread / Red Zone category =/ anecdotal Im contact tracer last month id say 3/5 calls teachers, students, family students. 1/5 clinics likely rate new pathogens emerge increase, bright side vaccines developed SARS-CoV-2 (specifically Pfizer Moderna) use technology rapidly applied many viruses. mRNA-vaccines used humans before, prove safe effective (and far, looks OK), it'll greatly help mitigate many potential future pandemics. Live Utah, wear mask public, keep circle small. Got positive result today. leadership joke. general public joke. wife moving state spring due politics ignorance people state. wait day European Medicine Agency FDA approves Pfizer vaccine. thing worries bit time around fewer mitigations place people seem shutting yet hotspots. flip side, there's immune people around, may help limit spike states surge already. Generally hierarchy bad drivers is:

-	BMW
-	Cops Uhhh lol like using completely useless metrics guage anything least dozen Sorry, don‚Äôt know vaccacine is. vaccine, however, probably lot good. kept kid school year. Americans fucking crazy. Yeah, kids married 30 years. also part lock down, although spouse was. lock down, household quite pleasant. 

I also feel need arm go protest streets basic health precautions. 

But thanks playing. wear masks 3 million fewer supporters 2016. sure you‚Äôre saying here. virus enters Biden, thinks host dead leaves deal stuff already, would take time stop people walking telling put mask 29 Canada. got Flu shot week ago. 

I getting Covid vaccine available. Fuck Covid! cant wait mankind push back shit.  soon saw China erecting walls around Wuhan, knew something big going happen. Seven months pandemic, coronavirus spreading rampantly across much U.S. ‚Äî California notable half states fall ‚Äúuncontrolled spread‚Äù category, according data gathered COVID Exit Strategy.

Literally came grocery store three unmasked adults I'm tempted, currently working towards MS (online, working full time), guess view helpful short term. definitely want least fluent least 2 languages though, whether pick Korean remain seen.  Watching American youtubers public masks scene makes wonder Youtube's role pandemic. gotta around someone whos symptomatic upwards 30mins...  don‚Äôt want anyone get, Lord no. might takes people believe reality start taking precautions, admittedly, uncomfortable. visit walmart another large store basically guaranteed get exposed, know whom. need tested, would say yes. dismiss covid fuel health crisis, perhaps CA dismiss tax status. Based current case count, think daily deaths UK go back 1,000. enough information situation response UK make guess high infections go. predict based current daily case counts, daily death rate UK well reach ~400/day Nov. 15. new cases rise higher still, higher deaths follow.

I necessarily think immediately available, good options stop spread. I'm worried impact Covid at-risk groups. I'm worried health businesses impact them.

I think targeted, neighborhood-level restrictions make sense. start see infections increasing substantially neighborhood, ask everyone stay home. Require employers either allow WFH, temporary leave employees. Compensate businesses employees disallowed work.

Mask mandates group size restrictions. Actual enforcement orders, issuing citations.

Continue push widespread, rapid antigen testing, even perfectly reliable, isolated people testing positive. Get installed major employers, public spots throughout cities.

If good solution available right now, everyone would it. isn't. think metric minimizing cases, deaths. also protect people's livelihoods, education quality life. Pod up, evaluate risks

I think people drastically underestimate hard is. might pod friends see, best keep things small controlled. also family. Many family members pods. significant others outside pod, roommates. somewhat regularly meet couple separate pods. 

Bottom line, even small groups, still want exercise abundance caution. asymptomatic friend infect easily asymptomatic stranger bar. need vigilant make sure COVID hopping pod pod around you. I'm sure actually it. Seems strange cured like 3 days. tells everyone worry big deal. ""We know wearing mask outside health care facilities offers little, any, protection infection.

It's rest lives, till wake up, get grip situation, defeat virus.   shame memory. Canada population: 37.59M. Total cases: 213,959. Latest daily: 2,227

Australia population: 24.99M. Total cases 27,513. Latest daily: 15 cases. 

Australia's daily would 0 (locally acquired) one state people irresponsible. Economy took health care. That's happened.

Also FYI Belgium testing symptomatic people period one month, lack capacity. numbers going useless.

We fucked soon too. know, vast majority Sturgis-goers locals even SD, neighboring states people ship bikes large cities fly take rental car Sturgis. 

\-Lived 25 years. Closing borders makes sense countries question markedly different incidence rates. countries stage epidemic, closing borders make situation better - international travelers roughly chance contagious travelers across districts. crazy, they're approaching 5% entire population *confirmed infected*! Higher country world.

So midst historic public health crisis, want hijack CARES funds subsidize environmental-villian industry, also harming public health cleaning old fields intended for.

Utterly ubsurd somehow surprising. religion forbids masks: Donald Trump Death Cult. go quickly 7500 beds. certainly made good PR Trump infected, also challenge opponents try fault transparent following promises. I‚Äôm certain intention, wanna say masks 100% effective circumstance, social distancing used combination mask. federal Coronavirus aid, believe CARES act. guess state governments flexibility want use it. would think repurpose anything repurpose overwhelmed hospitals, governor wants everyone think control. Another side effect dramatic reduction flu related deaths much Victoria advice Premier flu like symptoms near certainty Covid issue. State coroner revealed slight reduction suicides compared previous year. One often remarked positives lockdown time spent families. we? schools refusing provide data covid districts. we‚Äôve known 6 months, schools merely reflect overall rate, drive rate.

Gross over-generalization, recent evidence suggests limited transmission young children adults older children teenagers.

Also worth considering mode schools opened - preventive measures Germany YOLO mode Israel Poland. Yeah covid test once, bad. continuing joke üòÖ awkward misread... Seriously, beautifully written response. doom gloom? miss information? idea solution spread happy lies instead?

and going help? keep telling day paper cotton masks work. one look news tell different story though.

not least silly clinging convinient lies really nasty consequences, least country. see people follow rules distancing wearing placebos really really well, keep blaming following well enough instead finding better solutions.

despite fact absolutely clear vaccacine change anything near future, keep repeating lie became truth. might work repeat certain lies become truth, simply fail soon people realize vaccacine 100% prevention quote take least two years best case administer it. really cant tell masses react point. certainly help maintain public willingness accept restrictions.

so call gloom doom like. call neccesarry overdue. Yeah. national population density irrelevant vast unpopulated areas population centred small space like Canada Australia. And, happens, also Sweden. 

Take look urbanisation metric instead. explains way more. heck?

Also might keep symptoms, like short breath, life. Taiwan Communist! still democratic elections.

I said communist, authoritarian. Communism range anarchist (without central government kind) authoritarian. Cuba, example, far democratic United States absolutely amazing practices electing leaders, still communist. Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms said oil companies hit hard price drop resulting pandemic, leading slow work state's oil fields.

Oh no, someone think poor helpless oil companies? US EQuivalent 495,000 cases, that's nuts Considering epidemiologists wrong, think submitting ground-breaking analysis Nature.  overriding commonality closed borders enforced quarantine reentry residents.

I walk flight anywhere world jump straight tube. long borders open contact tracing world still get overrun. anything, would magnify risk associated travelling early infection (unless test additional...). Either way, huge burden backlog (not mention bleeding funds) test processing sides Atlantic currently.

I get it, pandemic sucks, got suck up. lot people disregarding rules, SoCal masks worn regularly, least 80% (my estimation) wearing correctly. 

The reason lawsuits lockdowns California,  
because people/businesses know stay open blatantly disregard guidance regulations mandated State due little local state enforcement.

The offenses really egregious (they busted AirBnb 'party house' holding weekly mansion ragers almost year) warrant kind attention, even businesses/churches skate months action taken authorities. Everyone else sees this, exploits it. agree keep cases slip border think actually happen every 2 4 weeks since seems going last months. 11 August cluster, maintenance worker, Jet Park employee went gym, post-MIQ flight cluster, marine engineer cluster. Five times jumped border 2.5 months. 

However think likely need Level 3 again. think return Level 2 likely point though. Level 3 needed index case went 2 weeks without getting test, cases marginalised high risk community many overstayers would avoid testing all. much absolute worst case scenario. really disagree position (also 30s, hell, I‚Äôve covid already), think it‚Äôs super important people see perspective thanks least open. anti maskers anti vaxxers. really big freaking issues one seems growing wrong direction. 

What hear people feel low risk wait it‚Äôs rushed basically coming anytime soon again, first? rush it.

For me, it‚Äôs another low risk decision one gets life much closer utterly insane like things now. convincing either risks benefits certainly going big obstacle us moving ahead. alone (sadly).

The concept urbanisation seems going head. totally agree that, 12K seems lot lower 28K, current growing rate Belgium reach 28K (7 days average) 10-14 days.

I bet case stop growing now. strong (yet)drastic measures, testing facilities saturated, government announced test would allowed people symptoms. 

Doesn't mean hospitalization death rate stop growing, *test trace everybody* strategy fails due finite test capacity wrong. explained clearly Swedish press conferences spring ment talked herd immunity. said multiple times herd immunity S-curve threshold

Its fault read USAToday get absolutely none context. [Belgium reports 17,709 new coronavirus cases, biggest one-day increase Positivity rate: 20% (+1.2)

They keep saying 60-70% tops whats needed herd immunity. tons studies recently coming saying might 45% less.

49% would either end pandemic least slow massively.

Why moderating sub need source that?

That indisputable sign thoroughly disqualifying ignorance subject supposed regulating Dude said herd immunity might weeks away. He‚Äôs talking slight lower increment infection rates. He‚Äôs talking significant amount spread reduction herd immunity. completely word important figure US tested positive many things would change. USA, UK, Spain, Belgium Italy worse already. I'd consider developed Colombia. sub pretends politics policy unless somehow pro-Biden anti-Trump. nothing 40% Sweden may there.

Yeah says herd immunity. actually dug little deeper would understood talking infection rate slowing due +20% partial immunity. full herd immunity.

Something lot people seem understand herd immunity exists Tegnell said ""Stockholm herd immunity may."" said ""Stockholm help herd immunity slow rate infections, may"".

But guess quote article went with. Poland 20% lmao relevant context, 55.87% Denmark‚Äôs GDP based exports. still Swedens economy fared worse. countries reopened

Because, know, best never acknowledge thing aerosol spread.

Even though virus fact likely primarily spread aerosols.

And guidance WHO, make-believe regulations put people room distance ""safe"" Bay Area opened theaters, restaurants gym two weeks ago, weather starting cool week. think California hit hard states early November. know what? understand problem Christian doctrine (I struggle daily, worth), would hope cause hate without knowing me. health care system coping, deaths higher usual, economy holding relatively well.

Statistics show opposite assertion.

Example: 
""Results: first week April onwards, death rates ages 60 higher previous years Sweden. Persons age 80 dis-proportionally affected, men suffer higher levels excess mortality women ages 75% higher death rates males 50% higher females. Current excess mortality corresponds decline remaining life expectancy 3 years men 2 years women. Conclusion: Covid-19 pandemic far clear consistent effect total mortality Sweden, male death rates comparably Same, I've anything delivered year. go week buy enough keep going single trip. height restrictions UK unnecessary panic buying reduced availability things soon recovered.

There need hoard huge quantities food household goods, artificially stifle supply leads rising prices. doubt panic buying re-emerge would people last time seemed learned lesson necessary. would willing PM sauerkraut recipe attempt fermenting first time ever, sounds DELICIOUS. closely guarded recipe understand, happy cooking! Semantics. meant say non medical masks, people wear, helped staff. non believers go hell hate Christians C19 supposed covered even uninsured people. They're publicizing fact. Similar many places. (hk) live infections super low yet everyone hates gov everything including pandemic performance. Works countries overall tourism outflows, prime example Netherlands.

There's way countries like Greece, Croatia Malta cover loss domestic tourism. guess flattered called swarm even though I'm one man. pandemic obviously high risk situation.

It's ""high risk""

The word ""risk"" implies uncertainty.

There uncertainty regarding happens type situations. Got married two weeks ago mom took wife dinner. insisted convinced go! Cheesecake Factory exact. Everyone saw mask dear god crowded there. last time eat inside restaurant safe vaccine comes out. can‚Äôt risk sure hell don‚Äôt need moms catching pre existing conditions! think since reported cases deaths delay real peak probably higher spring. saw someone making calculations Swedish situation spring cases probably 20k/day. Since deaths less would assume Belgium case numbers lot higher 28000. families teachers would show symptoms

When multiple percentage points population infected, impossible trace anything.

And kind situation associated reopening schools. look statistics time get complete answer, I'm giving initial thoughts. That's probably support government all, actual government parties 33% seats lost popularity since election 2018. Oh see. wasn‚Äôt actually replying OC, replying another user still believe first hand accounts? HAHAHAHAHA course people detained. lot uyghur radicals went Iraq fight ISIS. tiny minority Uyghur people. Ethics Uyghurs victims US-made radical Muslim ROK suffered one mega outbreak encountered sereral big outbreaks, managed contain without lockdowns.

So prepared well, may still contain virus even first minute missed. Thank you. know difference. agree since August lot leaks despite tightening system great deal, outside world seems seething hotbed infection. 

We may lucky break first 100 days. maybe current period atypical. 

Either way, keep scanning hopefully avoid lockdowns Getting covid fetish? miss one drunk westerners. ""In places Latin America virus spread unimpeded, population ended infected."" sources that? Name one COVID outbreak anywhere traced back elementary school

You need contact tracing trace things. I'm sorry hear assessment wish well.
National leadership important times like these, hope sake national government steps plate. difference ‚Äúlockdown level‚Äù Sweden soft-lockdown countries (like Denmark Norway) almost non-existent.

Even though directly related Covid, one aspect noted: Hat-tip organizational logistical capabilities Slovak army, organized whole endeavor.

On Monday, prime minister still vacillating whether pull trigger. So, army hygienists Tuesday, Wednesday Thursday prepare - reserve venues, erect hundreds testing stations, distribute 100k+ tests, recruit, transport train hundreds volunteers, organize lodging meals, procure distribute PPE, coordinate dozens mayors, secure order, run information campaign, likely score issues. THREE DAYS?! That's jaw-dropping. Refreshing contrast overall dysfunction authorities throughout western world. 5.1 million people, two main islands 12th 14th largest world area. evidence mean life anyway. know yet.

I little faith left humanity care anyone themselves, make even trivial decisions modicum logic.

Fun fact: paraphrase line above, Indonesians accusing insulting country religion. Well, find quote word word made eat health minister said. Americans think leave better countries worry it?

None relevant. think China shit ton cases reported need able back something, otherwise hot air. dont vaccine. Thanks wasting 15 minutes time, yes, know conduct basic internet search. mention South East Asia Vietnam two links provided, mention higher mortality rate due vaccine TB, higher mortality rate general Asia. 

As matter fact, Lancet journal even states ""BCG vaccine shown reduce severity infections viruses structure controlled trials"". 

Moreover, first link provided explain argument partially BCG vaccine solve Covid-19. common sense lol, would even whole discussion? 

Thus, repeat, shut fuck waste time actually find something states outright: mortality rate Vietnam 1/6. US fast becoming pariah state.

Progress competition rather cooperation Officially maybe not.

But actions speak louder words Family members get upset control, even normal times. shame bluetooth tracking.

it like throwing boomerang comes back hits head. believe excess death mostly due Covid due lockdowns, two reasons. First, nations like New Zealand (good example mentioned, strict lockdown, Covid deaths) excess deaths, see (New Zealand actually projected *negative* excess death year, basically flu season) 

Second, like two months counties' economies bad, New Zealand's too. great chance recover though.  So, five years. Fake china. mean Li Wenliang CCP member died became national hero China? Nice, keep us updated! live? afaik everything functioning normally now, little limitations. big lockdown 3 months March May something.... Stop treating like swear word. Even though bad strategy, still want wish high amount immunity lot cases. Thank you! informative detailed.  Would year lost time bad? joined school year later many others never issues. guess measures slowly relaxed Summer September. workplace, WFH norm late September. I've seen huge uptick people simply coming work daily. Additionally, people take time Summer. Given lockdown while, surprised people usual. Schools universities (university college students also commute, even dorm students go back home Fridays return dorms Sunday/Monday) closed Summer. 

Based cases, see Summer started numbers slowly went again. shops bars open, large amount people back work, schools/universities reopening, I'm guessing made September/October even explosive. quote, Swede i‚Äôve managed find one case medical personell beeing reprimended wearing PPE work, stealing PPE personell working covid patients. places follow HIPAA well, cover asses. muh freedumbs!!! pushing people rice field drown water? time

It's good China able detect got serious.

Interesting many asymptomatic though. We'll wait weeks find many develop symptoms, worrying much spread without symptoms. think everybody missing points here. nice day. constantly try suppress native american votes. 2018 made people address could vote homes reservations addresses. natives scramble get addresses homes reservations. mixing antigen tests antibody tests. antigen anyhing makes body produce antibodies. 

Antigen tests detect virus. Antibody tests described. estimated seeing 100,000 daily infections towards start year, we're close level. complexity situation, Sweden fucked Swedes brainwashed morons. end. average though probably vary quite lot person person.

Average immunity 12 months still means almost 10% per month lose immunity, instance. Good enough buffer vaccine out, betting Coronavirus immunity seems like bad idea based relatives.

Translated (free version)  wanna know next weeks check what's goinig europe. controle here... jokes back increase divorces got started? Wierd China, Japan, South Korea killed virus beforehand.

For fuck sake stop blindly spreading FHMs propaganda, people fucking sick Swedes. countries succeeded suppressing virus either

1 : ) China. Authoritarian country hardlocks people house keep registry every building block. countries emulate that. US come hardlock someone's house might get shot.

2 : ) Islands quasi-islands (South Korea/Singapore/Japan/Taiwan/New Zealand) either islands akin island secure/closely guarded land border (Noth Korea).

3 : ) Country controled pandemic reaching 10.000, intense community spread (Thailand/Vietnam).

Other that, hard pressed find one exception.

So none examples emulated, unless like Moses split seas make country island time machine come back beginning spread.

Once intense community spread, chance suppress it. countries even reached 0 cases returning thousands opened borded (Tunisia). need realistic, sustainable solution takes consideration many factors : psychologic, sociological, economic, realistic sustainable. Congrats. Still worst decile world. much happy it. again? man, knew elaborate, second wave come, lock single city ~3 weeks. Early lock help life getting back normal sooner. no, see taking away freedom. quarantine follow guidelines keep thing check endanger everyone else. Sweden 7th, 17th. USA passed sweden 576 dead per milion, 578, usa nearing 700. Lmao dude. wanna go EU average instead using three neighbouring countries collectively make 100% culture, geography demography Sweden, minimum 5 times better Sweden? EU average better comparison Sweden rest Scandinavian countries?? either brainwashed point lunacy, extremely disingenuous. month numbers 2.8 million cases, even 0.5% that's 14,000 deaths! Crazy Triage probably NYC took seriously end. wish states cities. lazy look up, it‚Äôs completely possible ND never shut indoor dining. Looks like superspreader event me. course fines. studies average cost hospitalization Coronavirus patient developed world? cat never shits pants neglects online school

Only half true dog still easier human child. shit think Sweden needs face *severe* repricautions.

Its corrupt goverment many places. corrupt goverment brainwashed population. Make population desperate enough maybe wake brainwashing. Ironic fracking natural gas.  ... manslaughter/criminally negligent homicide someone dies.

If chemical test could perfectly show who-gave-who disease, they‚Äôd treat lot different now; blame spread across community ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt really know sure infected you.‚Äù

Even almost certain infected you, cases presence welcome, still hardly responsibility beyond people conscience know probably killed relative unwise contact timeline matches up.

The fact asymptotic carriers exist nobody truly sure infected driving way caution‚Äîbut people going business real possibility infected.

To different drunk driving, every excuse hollow‚Äîfrom individuals companies legislators. goalpost ""Don't keep spreading corona"". one moving it. So, they're retirees, matter?

I'm tired anti-life sentiment people them. 17th, 7th. It‚Äôs really frustrating. parents multiple degrees. Shit dad worked NIH taught everything know science he‚Äôs dining like it‚Äôs big deal. amount cognitive dissonance plagues society regular ails going wipe chunk country people can‚Äôt party/socialize/go out. Fucking learn new hobbies deal it. wrong, would put huge strain testing capacities. many places already difficult symptomatic people get tested timely fashion. seems rather naive think every country world could eradicate virus like countries like New Zealand did...  Vietnam say hi Better mousetrap. Daniel Griffin provides clinical report COVID-19, discuss Bill Foege‚Äôs letter CDC director Robert Redfield, false promise herd immunity COVID-19, secret blueprints SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials released, neuropilin-1 possible entry protein virus. stop asshole literally google stop spreading misinformation there's reason comment got taken even try defend it.  lol. Sure mate. Serum antibodies confer long-term immunity virus. something deeper going here. fucking hillarious see yeah seems like 100k day possible next weeks There's really inappropriate amount news New Zealand comes COVID-19. Guess what? Vietnam 2 waves already. everything normal months. Life before. I'm sure Taiwan last time heard, pretty well also. need keep tooting horn much. Weed smoker here. hook bong vape attachment; it‚Äôs fine. two people wearing masks, one infected, there's 1% chance infecting other. That's extremely effective. ""Mommy mean man came facts""

Enjoy chosen ignorance. Yes, people pack lives si easily? stop asshole research stop spreading misinformation there's reason post got taken one relief bills. Maybe cares act? Yep, 100,000 reported cases per day coming soon, even though ‚Äúwe‚Äôre rounding bend.‚Äù Linguistically? Sure
Culturally? Close enough
Geographically? Absolutely not

If instead go EU average difference much less, Sweden's 600 deaths per million EU 400. EU average increasing rapidly Sweden not. believes mask protects like it‚Äôs suit armor.

I thinking, maybe computer game analogy would work.

You would various items HUD, social distancing, vaccine, mask, etc. similar way game health, armor, etc.

Surely game would check armor 100% like ""I'm good go!"" health 7%?

There many things play role combination. think depends widespread virus summer. Also, hot summer be. hotter people stay inside air conditioned places virus spreads like wildfire. See Arizona Florida usa summer.... Yes it‚Äôs amazing. Sweden still last place world doesn‚Äôt really understand people without symptoms significant spread virus. rest world new February. Truly shocking it‚Äôs well understood yet. blame health authorities that. except body builders stadium day education important too. Learn basic math. Unfortunate Wierdly enough, Sweden may closest.

I mean completley fucked forgetting ""aggressive"" psrt aggressive meassures atleast idea consistent meassures. lined mask lead powder protect radiation also. wait, question again? You're* tend little patience people still counting conveniences like others count pennies times like must admit, objectively, stance legitimate mine case, yes. ~40% population thinks it‚Äôs fake don‚Äôt care. Another 15% ‚Äúso bored home‚Äù. Another 35% can‚Äôt afford tell bosses safer. works pretty well. folks fighting losing battle. truth overcoming propaganda party line Sweden.

Hi Biden campaign. ya doing? went ahead replaced bones copper tubing case. Early on, staff allowed wear PPE care homes. TIL doint whats neccessary save lives faschy.  Eating times rigid, lot places allow to-go like 30 mins open? It‚Äôs mess.

This, this, this. Italian culture rigid meal times, least compared Western world (can't speak rest world). everyone gather restaurants exact time smaller cities lot restaurants even serve meals outside times. even like avoid crowd literally can't. Also daughter boss man; least favorite daughter begin with. BMI BS. We‚Äôve known years now, medical community still insists using it. Can‚Äôt trust research uses indicator correlate data. donate income them? stop goes normal. whining! Ok buddy. Sure. ever say chef  true. surprising happens people grave risk serious complications/death. still sad, surprising. CCTV News, yesterday, Shufu County Kashgar Prefecture conducted regular tests persons tested, found 1 case asymptomatic infection new coronary pneumonia. asymptomatic infection found, local epidemic prevention control headquarters immediately carried nucleic acid tests close contacts. 14:00 today, 137 people tested positive, connect village‚Äòs ‚Äôfactory parents work . According expert diagnosis, infected asymptomatic.  think picking literal neighbour country 90% exact Sweden every way cherrypicking? second neighbour country, Denmark, 5 times better. Finland, another neighbour country 8 times better. 

Your wanna change opinion whole cherrypicking idea yours? Sorry people downvoting asking question. That's downvote button for. 

Looks like someone linked resources already. Thankfully, since I'm mobile evening. opened Vista Unified School District 10/20, classes full capacity, 38 kids per high school class. 

And still hear vocal subset people saying don‚Äôt live fear, masks harmful, it‚Äôs great first COVID positive case high school already it‚Äôll help herd immunity, etc. 

We‚Äôll see happens. NB Canada mask usage indoors places I‚Äôve strong 98% mandate. maybe 60-70% mandate. get 0-2 cases per day per 750,000 population. still spread it. Two coworkers high risk already got it. governor Dept Health really strict early on; dentists even really see anyone month restrictions. also lot people seemed accept mitigation steps (masks, social distancing, etc). Things actually pretty okay ""Reopen PA"" people started spamming social media stuff. see lot situations entire families wear masks less people seem willing comply previously. Yeah.... total 0.0001% people 65 died far US covid truly destroyed.  comical hope people intelligently stocking staples Overflow services moved outside cemeteries. immune disease. There's nothing stopping catching covid multiple times.

Having make immortal, vaccine either.

People really need learn basic science. Everybody seems think become immortal vaccine antibodies. Neither lasts forever. ""Polio harmless, 3 weeks nobody issues"" someone tell wearing mask anything unless n95. told knows tell works hospital.

She's nurse's aid next medical training.

I replied ""oh."" kept living mask life. need livestream baby gasping air dies people understand increases suffering. Something tells don‚Äôt young kids, don‚Äôt reason care whether attend person classes. think obese man never exercised better position Biden? getting surprised Alabama took big issue parents testing kids see example certain people never gain power probably seek therapy psychopath. Thanks genuinely couldn‚Äôt find Mr Duda need 'Polish' Health standard... Dumb, delaying inevitable maybe week so. send even asymptomatic kid school likely get someone sick people get tested get school close. whoever dumbasses families infect. high achievement 2020! mask hand washing? Anything could help reduce transmission better nothing. need convince me. I'll first line, soon age group/occupation/location allowed get one. Heck, I'd happily camp front vaccine distribution center get ASAP. soon get it, COVID me: masks whatsoever I'll visiting every single bar town hug many strangers can. Mexico pay it? Arguably though, Sweden sissified country days. quite way. One source says 675,000 USA little two years. Well fair wrong underside we're really screwed. I'm voting guy even earn party's nomination 1988.

Were alive then? enforcing strict obedience authority expense personal freedom

The Victorian government that. enforcing strict compliance rules, designed limit freedom, fight pandemic.

To imply otherwise call ""authoritarian"" every government enforces rules, speed limits, paying taxes, compulsory schooling (let alone prohibitions murder, rape, robbery etc). Money helps. rich idiots get don‚Äôt use common sense take precautions. See Trump example rich idiot got sick failed take precautions.  Imagine cases per capita 3rd world shithole 0.06% US died covid 0.001% 65.

How ever recover?!? work restaurant 10-13 hour shift. 
And see Japan, thing 24/7 people use feel nose bother people. becomes mandatory thing, like social conscious thing. many looking for? problem governments health organization ruined thrust tackle pandemic. still get headache first refused wide use mask still fight idiots like chairman (a radiologist) WMA still think work, halfass measures shit stop virus protect business.

I issues get yearly flu shots take Japanese encephalitis vaccine zero chance take first batches potential covid vacine, see fucked too. anchoring, well established phenomenon psych. Cooler temperatures less sunlight going help virus live longer. going interesting months. sad. children they‚Äôre burden? don‚Äôt children can‚Äôt kids due chronic illness &amp; breaks heart think someone would behave way (avoid testing) get kids ‚Äúout hair.‚Äù downplaying virus, telling people afraid it, promoting wearing mask, ‚Äògood job‚Äô??! spring wondered today's parents managed survive summer vacations. Yeah see cabin fever now, months ago. Personal choices come various consequences. Make choice agree crazy bill they‚Äôre get. Remember spanish flu second wave much deadlier first. Like, far. hope that's case mysticism denialism point otherwise. problem Kulkarni!! different reason. /s do? Oh post going get brigaded people saying tested positive YET also believe virus hoax. time Novosibirsk and/or Alabama right now? everyone could/can. Upset? Fuck suddenly concerned ass.

Standing roof vehicle moving holding BLM sign Santa Monica Blvd? Constitutionally protected. 2 weeks Mad? Thank understanding awkward situation find within. That‚Äôs point. ‚Äúfearful‚Äù? language definitely portrays stance fact matter free spirited uncle John, made peace ready turn lights, isn‚Äôt candle wind. He‚Äôs ticking time bomb recklessly take dad, grandma, waitress, two guys bowling club, spirit living life. Covid isn‚Äôt terminal disease someone chooses stop fighting live life. It‚Äôs HIGHLY contagious virus. I‚Äôm living life see fit personal choice...but cavalier attitude making choice everyone come contact well. Everyone entitled opinions, you‚Äôre describing personal choice sounds incredibly selfish, careless, reckless, short sighted me. would also contend people want get back things ‚Äúused be‚Äù enjoy life aren‚Äôt particularly interested checking early. describing seems like would fit incredibly microscopic subset individuals.

Side effects occur vacuum, require mechanism. Vaccines float around body forever, trigger immune response get flushed out. mechanism long term side effects? downplay well New Zealand handled virus, approach truly applied elsewhere. benefited low population density isolation, can't said Italy. Again, insistent arguing points make, damn it? Seriously. Again, slow roll use words wrote, make mind may say.

I tell difference tool, say one never defended US government's response single iota here. Lmao this. nasopharyngeal Covid test overhyped thing ever. It‚Äôs uncomfortable seconds it‚Äôs over. Unless lobotomizing swab doesn‚Äôt lasting effects. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre getting information from, make blanket statement Europe. counterpoint, husband‚Äôs 86 year old aunt Germany diagnosed late stage pancreatic cancer. She‚Äôs offered chemo. decided take another story. situation definitely not, ‚ÄúNice knowing you, Oma.‚Äù eating public, think removing mask bites make much difference. 

What outdoor foot traffic spreading droplets food? restaurants could shut like suggested.... that's much tougher choice.

Yes put millions work destroy thousands businesses... That's bad treatments dont equal outcomes medicine. See: literally everything. r/liberalgunowners would like word. act like badass, bro, people left anti gun. Many us military training, enjoy hunting, collect guns like Americans. you‚Äôre basing decision 2 cases many millions cases worldwide? Maybe people continue take seriously.  sounds horrible.

I believe that's wanted start.

It horrible, though, one surviving 12 put god damn 3M masks offer visit her. 

Did know virus implausibly fake constantly playing odds bedridden 93yo last grandparent laughably worth risk? big question. even trust shit amazon Agreed. Oregonian bothers Idahoeans decide wear mask, make fellow citizens sick, ship here. personal responsibility whatsoever non-mask wearers part work bar really baffle locals come claim it‚Äôs hoax don‚Äôt know anyone it. Like fucking course don‚Äôt one best responses virus entire world. people really stuck inside privileged bubble. FDA approves Remdesivir, shown efficacy, haven‚Äôt approved one? stupid would say are? Biden winning isnt going prevent people breaking rules? Unless mobilizes DoD actively enforce rules It‚Äôs got electrolytes! Ha, family dont live ivory tower. Well add pause/excuse payments bills without penalties. fair everything said basically joke none going happen people masking public partying private. It‚Äôs like mullet Covid precautions. announcement Trump (and probably will) still get Covid again. follow guidelines, it‚Äôs he‚Äôs President access care don‚Äôt even survived covid first time all.

There COVID cure yet. president immune. nasal pharyngeal swab doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúwear out‚Äù lol  No, information find breakdown first days response NZ Herald, unfortunately behind pay wall here's quote March 12:

"" point, borders managed sorting countries lists - effectively green red, depending whether outbreaks present. banned list growing rapidly, requiring new entries transmitted immigration authorities airlines. machinery filtering decisions beginning seize. list constantly updated communicated airlines. guess main difference way announced politicising it. thought fauci CDC said haven‚Äôt gotten second wave COVId yet. could seeing explanation working Canada too, twice Quebec seen greater growth cases compared rest country. winning, keep :) man black friday gonna insane. horse already left barn. Giving money people kids proven work. main reason people less kids shifts attitudes liberalization society whole. never attitude! Australia here. 21 cases yesterday. 21,000. 21. states 0. guys must suuuuuper wealthy!!

Nah, said ""Irish life like growing many siblings? 

Everybody lives near knows idea ""trying make friends"" alien concept beause friends trace back imagine it'd acreage farmland something like that?

What? extended family urban almost semi-urban rowhomes. suburbs.

Interesting thing note Catholics Jewish-Americans tended live close urban centers Northeast US. farmlands almost protestants probably real reasons make kids. Crown Virus message Florida:  feds less concerned spread COVID airlines. like around mom. hate around father wife.

In theory like around friends, too, making plans flaked without notice means I‚Äôm probably happier trying. :( absolutely nothing France. Spain's graph pretty dramatic: it‚Äôs ‚ÄòAmerica Britain‚Äô Bullshit^2 - First vaccinated high-risk groups, providing massive data months low-risk groups even think getting it.

With exploding numbers across autumn regions, percentile risk infection double digits, death risk shy many cases, double-digits getting crippled disease, life.

No vaccine come near even order magnitude given 50000 people without incident. What? Where‚Äôs covid? Well, spent money paying police fight them, repairing damages, cleaning... could see frustration. Good job. communist china done That. tranquil strolls humanity ever seen. lifted now, crazy it‚Äôs worse too. discussed months. imagine ones, less staffing Winning!? answered what?  Hey, vote Texas without wearing mask, we‚Äôve got going us. /s  Germany, me, always represented approximately best-case-scenario COVID containment non-island nation Western culture. basically proof imo elimination anywhere that's Taiwan, NZ, Iceland, etc... never option. Paris really gone far downhill 6-ish years? absolutely loved city, minus Roma. hospital military patients go Fort Bliss? imagine plan US approach go away. say shutting border enough, said US politicised closing border China rather setting criteria called xenophobic. Even government time said closing border China delay spread stop it. Also there's much wealth whole compared 50 years ago. Millennials smaller share overall percentage imagine they're still much wealthier age groups 50 years ago. Poverty, famine, crime, etc, way world backs claim. Hardly. listen Trump Faux News might end thinking this. loud minority making country look like know follow science, compassion, selfless.

I sincerelly hope so, impossible lower oppinion guys nowadays foreigners (even places like Spain lot similarities), due international media depict ""average americans"", sad. ...that really take seriously, anecdotal mainly fear sells. deaths significantly lower first peak? Surely it‚Äôs hospitalisations deaths important, since number ridiculous error margins doesn‚Äôt really correlate countries historical figures. 12-hour shift need two batteries 3M brands. So, $1700-1900 depending. Also don‚Äôt forget filters.  Lol joking US actually slots average terms deaths/million. Europe got hit hard testing widespread. Last Thursday (yes, 22 October), health minister said ""without new measures, would 50k cases/day two weeks"" we've already reached number.

They thought could control virus helping economic recovery, test-trace-isolate system already major problems. They're proposing authoritarian inefficient measures, undermining people's defiance towards health measures. support telecomuting (Macron said ""it isolates people"", yeah useful pandemic mate) low health protocols schools (to avoid closing schools). 

I hope they'll opt lockdown quickest possible, lost opportunity flatten curve before. hospitals ICU getting flooded COVID patients, tbf, may become worst March nothing done. last person wanna trust covid thank think part reason due news vaccines either going approval process getting ordered phase 3/resuming trials. people acting like gone realize there's still long way vaccine's current phase actually gets administered. understand (least US) get sick spend bit time hospital, getting hefty bill survive. visit via zoom scrolled articles. seems complete moron obsessed ‚ÄòAmerica Britain‚Äô think believes. grandmothers via zoom. Done done. Definitely, people becoming burnt long going real end sight, vaccine approved, change mindset lockdowns.

 People knowing wait vaccine produced enough get it, pandemic either turn endemic. uptick cases accompanied uptick deaths.

Deaths literally upticked 19 times daily toll end date chart Aug 11th (from avg 9 deaths day rolling 7 day period average 179). uptick deaths certainly *followed* uptick cases chart. guarantee number 50 times daily death rate end chart next month out. Unfortunately, burned enough hopes aspirations like this. 45 go fiery blaze gives White House, need go offensive change. layers less viral load. touches outside mask like rubs eyes nose sanitizing matter many layers has. referring US. know other, civilized, countries national mandates. also socialized healthcare, respect rights minorities LGBTQ people, believe science.

The US cancer world. ways one. treating old fat people unethical hospitals nearing worrying, evidence emerged many sick elderly patients effectively automatically denied access treatment, avoid hospitals overwhelmed. One March 17 FHM directive Stockholm hospitals stated patients 80 body mass index 40 admitted intensive care, less likely recover. reports describe sick care home residents administered palliative cocktail morphine midazolam, homes equipped administer oxygen, something doctors described ‚Äòactive euthanasia.‚Äô anything low quality? Damn. Coronavirus approves gathering. Get covid here. they‚Äôre turning assignments matter? Well, Supernatural ... church‚Äôs School Supernatural Ministry 

I bit superstitious, hesitant mock close Halloween. 

But knows preternatural medical skills have! Sam Dean segment something similar? Hang on, folks. could get ugly.  Australian, would much rather live anywhere else developed world go States. definitely going get stories families gathered Thanksgiving spread family causing someone die. family wonder could've happened them. people rude full micro-aggressions

There times Im reminded much like Paris. LOL

Sure REEEEEEEEEEEEEE u turbo nerds think we're witnessing [a mass extinction event amphibian populations [60% animals wiped since [90% large fish ocean [plummeting insect populations threaten collapse global [anthropgenic global warming increasing pandemics contributing skyrocketing rates infectious [Stephen Hawking said less 100 years move another planet order might sort societal collapse? 

That's dumbest thing I've ever heard. gut tells me, like posters below, everything normal, like forever we'd better thinking hard things reading past headline. know money doesn‚Äôt go unemployment right? clearly know nothing North Dakota oil companies here. mean bulletproof, pretty intuitive. Imagine room bunch clouds colored smoke. Would rather face shield barefaced? Obviously get leakage underneath shield eventually, lesser quantity take longer get there. simple diffusion.

That adds lower risk infection. Obviously zero, disease prevention adding many layers imperfect protection top create overall effect population-level control. Nope, travel barred worst hit regions initially: China EU. visa also closed, making difficult non-residents enter drastically reduced TSA numbers were, especially first months COVID. administration chose test inbound travelers mandate 14 day self-isolation requirements them, that's then. There's really excuse China managed so. FFS government idiotic completely failed us. I'm sure point trying make. Speeding kills far fewer people COVID does, yet universally illegal law enforced police. took mask wearing seriously speeding would handing tickets right left. irrelevant point I'm trying make.


My point even agree behavior dangerous, make illegal, law enforcement actually enforces law people still engage behavior feel caught. Speeding example. need mandate wear mask I'm idiot, feel like national mask mandate going effective. bother tried it, not. think would another law nearly impossible enforce fairly becomes another subjective weapon police use discretion fuck people. France got 52.000 today. don‚Äôt give shit cops feel like don‚Äôt feel like doing. job enforce law. Period. 

If ticket 15 55 zone ticket Karen maskhole demon refusing put mask Applebee‚Äôs.  No, you‚Äôre trying claim factor 10 difference deaths due specific errors. It‚Äôs not, zero evidence, data even opinion pieces support claim. That‚Äôs proud disgusts me. 

Again, feel free send anything supports opinion. Anything all. Please. actually think Florida may better winter rest country. People able spend time outdoors. best friend lives Tampa said, like Northeast winter, people really go outside much summer. hot humid. France population density 122 people per sq.km compared country 4 people per sq.km. Germany populated mean France too. Check Petr Ludwig facebook:

My opinion based Dr Fauci‚Äôs fear-mongering CNN. think there's arguments could made: 

&amp;#x200B;

* Kids going every house multiple neighborhoods - contact tracing becomes hard . 
* there's asymptomatic household handing candy kids, notoriously great impulse control, immediately eat candy/touch face without washing hands, etc. 
* Many people town going 1-3 costume shops kids trying costumes/masks on. 
* Kids sometimes go group friends 1 adult, leaving adults free go party, imagine lots places trying discourage covid spread, also typical halloween shenanigans send people hospital.
* Concerns people wearing face masks costume masks

Also, sure ways work around ... also feel young kids really care enough worth ... CDC's listed alternatives like candy scavenger hunts, think young I'd still stoked getting candy, carve pumpkins, etc. exactly keeping kids safe from? COVID hurting kids. Statistically, playground much dangerous. plan keep kids home every flu season since flu dangerous kids COVID

Perhaps haven‚Äôt bothered learn facts. hundred things likely kill kids COVID. go ahead keep spreading fear misinformation ignorant masses keep upvoting you.

You sicken me


Source: 121 COVID deaths age 21. 75% underlying causes deaths MVA. Perhaps never let child vehicle. sense lots snitching local busybodies! believe different types nasal swabs. One earlier versions went deeper nasal cavity newer versions/types. least, explained friend mine works COVID test site. He's referring moment time that's way pro-Sweden cultists sort argument. remember weeks ago argument cases now!! well they're still bad Europe!! Nevermind fact Scandinavian countries waaaay better Sweden. Imagine applying Sweden's strategy countries shit worker protections healthcare systems. know thing. happened blood draw. pass out, feeling like to. told doctor instructed lie couch. 5 seconds later, perfectly fine running stairs fetch x-rays. surprised recovered almost instantly. Maybe younger, 18, life already pretty much set rest life. future country. Regardless, death tragedy. It‚Äôs almost like Dr. Fauci science right whole time. Covid doesn‚Äôt care denial. mean tons countries locked severly longer time New Zealand still tons cases. Someone got mirror? It‚Äôs sort hyperbole driving conspiracies.  looks like numbers worse ours. We‚Äôve state send us nurses though many patients normal nurses covid. It‚Äôs total mess. Luckily canceling elective surgeries might help little bit.  definitely first debate. way got sick recovered less week. major criticism sum, study number critical design limitations lead biased toward null underpowered answer question interest stated investigators. Statistical insignificance and/or too-small effect measured likely outcome artifact study‚Äôs design, regardless true effect masks. Additionally, trial measures protective effects wearer, transmission effects individuals (source control). Source control hypothesized primary way mask work reduce spread SARS-CoV-19 basically narcissism. Parents want stay home teachers, parents want talk kids pandemic happening. Chris Christie also lung issues car accident. Yeah. would figure small groups trick treating already friends family exposed other. epidemiologists say need prolonged contact get infected, simply opening door, dropping candy bucket saying ‚Äúhappy Halloween‚Äù going get anyone sick. I'm East Idaho, fuck me. one situation like this? Like everyone around really think blessed closer God rest country, spread message sanity make stick? talking info leave dine somewhere. don‚Äôt want leave data. dumbass. definitely is.  

The said big 3 ratings agencies (in US) relationship big financial firms. get paid firms whose products supposed making non-biased rating of. 

No way could go wrong. - SMH never cohesive shutdown US United States America literally objectively never left first wave.   really thought ignoring problem, pretending didn‚Äôt exist gonna work time. Well, third time‚Äôs charm! Better title Google case asymptomatic infection reported Shufu County, Kashgar Prefecture, Xinjiang Naw wanna progress church? need paying wanna get married? wanna go temples? wanna take sacraments? tithing

How else going afford build Nauvoo? going say police force would ever enforce us anyway possibly China get executed hello usa make predictions anymore. since April 1st like 6000 deaths, said way we'd another 50,000 April. (We nearly 60,000 deaths April.) totally agree, man. It‚Äôs maddening. places getting worse florida getting better initial Facebook post asked advice feedback people could fight mask mandate. That's one parent responded saying received religious exemption willing share made frustrating Burns comments one parent doesn‚Äôt even mention faith reason, yet parents say use religious exemption anyway. replies gave step-by-step guide parents could request post read, ""since masking definitely Christian faith, I'm going use religious exemption fight kids return school mask free.""

Edit - also article says religious mask exceptions apply many school districts too...   Faith = believing want true. It‚Äôs purely emotional, impervious logic, facts, reason. say place elects Steve King Congress. Also Korea didn‚Äôt even mandatory mask rule literally month ago! Everyone assumed mandatory followed rules lol second wave hit White House. joke, Utah actually one lowest death rates. Hiding cases would make number even better. Youre right, Texas big state shouldnt made broad topic police Texas. reddit readers take every word 100% literal. apologize offending you. Yeah, say that.

Most idiots fucking dumb know they're idiots. claiming they're idiots exactly idiot would do. Mine already open (5 days/week) almost 2 months, significant spread all. I'm glad I'm missing memorable school stuff saying reaching failure state a... good thing? like every disease world

There one set way immune system responds ‚Äúevery virus world‚Äù. Maybe get infected protected life. maybe get every year two. Hell, viruses immune system never actually clear even though make huge immune response it. look northern states already. Montana, North South Dakota, Idaho Wyoming.

Its already happening there, even without holidays. rounding corner one, folks amount manpower P&amp;A well drop bucket compared drilling new well. Arguably CFR U.S. higher 2.5%, need compare deaths number cases result, total cases. We've seen estimates 500,000 dead end February, would take average ~2,000 deaths per day reach, we're far napkin calculations. Requires leadership  China detected identified disease first relatively early stage, number cases provinces outside Hubei low could quench covid-19 epidemic region quickly sparing medical resources sending medical teams aid every hot spot Hubei province.

China adopted strict measures restrictions early, also hindered export cases. boomer 'experts' years live. agree points, wouldn‚Äôt call ‚Äòdespicable‚Äô. It‚Äôs in-line companionate use Emergency USA Authorization. countries stringent safety protocols others. early phase data vaccines tested date suggest target product (spike protein) safe. vector also many people many years, also reasonably deep safety profiles. Putting together unknown, risk/reward calculation society needs make. agree US it, it‚Äôs placing risk essential employees vs virus instead risk vaccine. virus deadly, US would likely taken less conservative approach. Well, shit. fines pretty much useless everything depends personal responsibility again... current testing capacity allow numbers high? think might point one big wave. really see anything happening moment would slow pace. last wave people getting outdoors spread out, big states taking measures, even go last enough. US run ground Russian interests. Division always goal. Politicizing masks another step process. Watch got badass doctor posting reddit lmaooo Great Depression WW2 total lasted 15 years l. Major Corona restrictions last June 2021 population begins simply refuse comply. corona style life won‚Äôt last enough time cause major cultural shift, it‚Äôs clear seeing way population reacting permanently things differently anyways. pretty sure go undetected months. blows hits critical environment, like parties larger, socially active groups.

It rural communities many parties such.

And spreads factories youngish people working there, would think normal cold?

I think China work out, hope share findings.

Wuhan connected high speed trains on, easily come train. That's sad man. Hydroxycholorquine anything help. Well, also see many western states 'people' attacking first responders like ambulances firefighters (along police, obviously). 

People assholes, bad times amplify showing off. America. Jesus water there? SARS1 didn‚Äôt enough cases know sure. different different people antibodies undetected 12% patients 2 year mark. second wave people talking since March. difference world able tamp progress virus initial wave, US never did. we‚Äôre going phase two starting daily infections 40,000 baseline. 

Put head knees, shits going get really bad really fast. Pretty sure Dan Marino freakishly high mainly cause it‚Äôs ton old people countries like 10 blocks diameter.  They've nearly zero corona deaths months, total deaths literally lowest ever recorded. 

They're fine. 

This fearmongering trying say they're wrong. aren't. weather gets colder events start getting moved inside. shift happen overnight though. Reinfections possible prevalent previously thought. Finally.... wondering fracking would resume rounding bend straight hell. Except for, know, long term issues reinfection risk. let stop you. thought done last Easter üê£ Based post history it‚Äôs Melbourne Australia, least visited Unfortunately folks ones taking seriously since beginning. feel sad them. everything right, people around not. Sorry, actions speak louder words. r/worldpolitics knowledge fracking usually used natural gas, know used things like oil standard cases. article wrong. Johns Hopkins actually reported 84,000, know definition inflation? That‚Äôs literally I‚Äôm trying say. people starved vastly overinflated currency. thing would happen government paid previous wages half country forcing unemployed. It‚Äôs dumb strategy shouldn‚Äôt even considered even thought add honestly. knew people Canada say got lucky low population density many tests handed out? positivity rate. deaths steady around 700-800 day, way peak. Trump keeps winning everyone else keep winning too! Yea thats alcohol for

""The cause of, solution, life's problems"" Except Pence's staff tested poz. Good work right thing. Wish bring well Australia :( Im sorry ask. folks relatives died, taking seriously deaths? know of, considering number asymptomatic people cases see severe may second infection. use worldometer well fair, know accurate. convenient source aggregate data. It‚Äôs closer 1% overall (+/- 0.5%). zero reputable experts think it‚Äôs 0.2%. left population cases per population unit matters. Turns helps prove point. 

ND population 762k 2019. New Brunswick estimated population 781k (747k 2016). similar population vastly different number cases, wow. Offer suggestion wearing mask protection like carrying gun. 

Two things true once. r/boneappletea countries reopened safely think anyone dying time good thing.. conflating pandemic homelessness? aren‚Äôt even trying establish nexus two. Well. 

Even Europe USA easy detect it. slow spotting back March.

Because take build become really notieceable, also many people asymptotic get symptons resemble normal colds flus.

So guess place doctors would even slower detect it. Honestly winter north. It‚Äôs snowing right now. think ‚Äúsummer‚Äù rise reflected heat south, drew people inside. thing it‚Äôs colder spreading bad north. Where? Even neighbours north Canada never this, fact mask wearing seen good thing conservatives liberals there, result fewer cases total states America.  20s includes young children whatever reason less likely serious illness particular virus. average 18 year old would risk close adult. Tell EU, Middle East, many places world experiencing huge uptick cases right now. Record high cases around world. would better position, would ‚Äúout of‚Äù anything. 1100 cases yesterday look worldometer, states left yesterday. LA, CT, RI..also military, prisons, island territories. probably lower. Source? Even dads age, odds still much favor coming fine.

Best wishes friend! Good point. feel bad people MN. Well, since know relationship well, continue tell non toxic normally /s. I'm also public health field, insight doesn't. also nursing field 30 years. Masks final solution COVID problems. 
 
Neither helmets war. 
 Neither Norway Finland mandatory mask wearing. Tegnell saying stage make much difference. 
 
Sweden different stage Norway Finland. 
 also said might helped used earlier, point evidence support it. 
 
A doctor know use Precautionary Principle make type II statistical errors. Tegnell evidently didn't. 
 no, force restrictions law, Swedes adults need treated like brats follow recommendations. 
 
Does mean ebola-like epidemics would unrestricted field weeks Sweden. deaths actually rise. hey you. Keep head far ass can't see whats going world It‚Äôs 100% clear, 2.5% CASE fatality rate (CFR) course pandemic, including beginning diagnosing by, likely, factor 10 CFR back 6%. still almost definitely underdiagnosing infections, probably rate closer 2-3. confusing factor you‚Äôre dividing total *current* deaths total *current* cases, takes *minimum* 3 weeks case become death, [data scientists 6-9 weeks lag deaths cases due reporting delays. current CFR you‚Äôd need divide current deaths cases ~8 weeks ago. 

The *best estimates* INFECTION fatality rate 0.6% +/- 0.3%, assuming hospitals handle patient load (if not, number skyrockets). there‚Äôs basically guarantee 300-900 deaths per 100,000 cases we‚Äôre diagnosing cases (which we‚Äôre not). 

Based math above, current CFR around 2%, 100k cases per day lead 2,000 deaths per day infection+reporting lags occur. course, given testing increased since 6-9 weeks ago, I‚Äôm basing CFR on, probably capturing cases 2% little smaller, say 1.4-1.7% guess. Yes, know it‚Äôs going become endemic like flu. vaccine slow spread substantially. social distancing,masks, shutdown etc rn disease new, don‚Äôt really know treat it, natural resistance within population. However, vaccine increase natural resistance within population time goes on(mostly vaccine), measures necessary. People follow measures vaccine comes out. Hell, people going stop giving crap spring, right now. People substantially change lives extreme long term disease statistically speaking easy survive gives mild symptoms (Not trying downplay severe cases know occurred simply stating thought process peoples head) Step everything says call name.

Well done, comrade. ~Which says all. actually tried ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù going back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù letting virus run course, looking 30,0000,000+ dead US. It‚Äôs direct Covid fatalities, it‚Äôs excess deaths impossible strain health CARE system, complications (my BIL died drugs administered help Covid -sepsis-), also mutations re-infections.

Headlong destruction USA. suits far right, that‚Äôs typically seize control: creating encouraging societal distress, acting upheaval. patterns clear plenty historical examples. It‚Äôs happening right noses.

This distinguish right/alt right/far right rational conservatism. latter integral necessary component healthy democracy. say I, progressive liberal. Folks identifying Republicans voting Democrat next week won‚Äôt make Democrats. clear idiot trash normal conservatives get elected next cycle. ""Actually mean people commiting mass homocide real nazi""

Neat. like care people? Right. never going actually use money things like hospital equipment PPE victim relief first place. seems everyone arms word ‚Äúfracking‚Äù appears. coronavirus aid wasn‚Äôt going to...coronavirus aid...in first place. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Impossible! Trump said getting much better. /s Yes, actually that‚Äôs huge fucking difference. viruses contagious, you‚Äôd measuring mortality rate young people cases per 100,000. 

A mortality rate 0.2% 1 500. would mean least couple deaths reasonably sized high school. another 60 years go, relax kid. Learn cope maybe seek therapy trouble.  would good news though... would mean people going die year already died death toll wouldn‚Äôt get much higher. 10% infected, there‚Äôs still 90% population spread potentially kill. people like friend UK going parties without masks? Super reliable source there. fear mongering. numbers go election regardless voted in. 

Anyone read 12th amendment lately? Think vote counts? States don‚Äôt even hold popular election. electoral college decides, can‚Äôt, House Representatives decides. 

Let‚Äôs keep complaining two party system hoping vaccine invisible enemy, Covid. Ya rate coming down. young people. 

Still many. I'm debating whether visit 81 year old mother. seen year willI chance next spring. obvious 'no' already lonely feeling cooped up. worry going handle winter. visit may go Thanksgiving sister's even though sister refuses wear mask. problem wearing mask I'm staying house. Right. That's I'm saying. confused about? Matters - habits persist, even reason keep anymore.

If somebody starts dating postpones kissing avoid corona, get habit it, likely keep forever.

My grandparents instance kept habits growing great depression living WWII lives. 

They still hoarding stuff scarce period (like sugar) 40 years later lol. grandmother literally always keept 17 kilos sugar stocked up, like case got rationed like WWII.

I guess affects spend years figting able buy sugar, like hoarding stuff. Even absolutely point it. mean. basic assumes constant death rate time. obviously wrong. going down. super basic math like powerful ballparks arnt far easy understand assumptions made.

All give pretty good rough confidence interval 1k -2.5k. mean. Complex models could worse. don‚Äôt historical precedent herd immunity strategy virus degree. nobody MD Ph.D credibility endorse herd immunity. You‚Äôre fucking atrocious. It‚Äôs Covid related death young person. That‚Äôs significant. Here‚Äôs hoping scum fuck like gets experience it. Wisconsinite here, easily switched drinking home. Saved fair amount money instead going bars. I'm sure liver mental state suffering eh. literal question second infection less miserable, sadly already answered it. Shameful can't wear masks. been, however one group #muricans try drown out. Yes are. want compare Sweden Belgium simply makes Sweden look better failure. fucking disgust me. country 900 line :O citizens don‚Äôt even care! don‚Äôt know many people limiting activities anymore. you? Take page WW2. ‚ÄúUnited Win‚Äù. Make virus common enemy - maybe even throw Nationalistic anti China angle provide target frustration. Weekly counts/tracking make competition areas lowest counts...so on. Take NFL voter campaigns change PSAs mask wearing, hand washing sacrifice save country. tourism industry gonna get blasted matter did. Thanks strong covid response however, local tourism keeping alive.

On economy large, again, gonna get blasted matter what, small country vulnerable state global economy. However, two biggest trading partners (Aus &amp; China) also managed covid well, we're fine front. 

tl;dr: economy faring well other's time others said, can‚Äôt force nationwide lockdown. manages get congress pass good enough relief package keep people businesses afloat, states might willing lock down. Many resisting economic reasons.  it‚Äôs reminder around Trump literally poisonous. Honestly OC done pretty good, everywhere gone within county lines close 100% mask compliance. I‚Äôm happy people stepped makes think economy destroyed? talking one quarter budget included 6 weeks serious lock measures past 3/4 months minimal lock measures. lastest quarter numbers released.

Or 25 deaths longer contribute economy? I'd like know. I'm mistaken. People can't work whether sick dying can't contribute economy way. Imagine many birthday parties missed much people would spend gifts food travel that. lost lives moments happen destroy economy long run much short term.

I personally 3 domestic travel plans minimum summer flying parts country.

Eating couple times week. work team dinner past two weekends literally packed restaurants hugged working home team mates.

But man. math today. average new test reported today Colorado symptom onset ~10 days ago, corresponding infection ~15 days ago. last days, drop case growth CU Boulder ""temporarily"" moved online classes many students went home - September 30.

If testing turnaround long even longer, course. CO data onset date incredible compared ways visualize it.

Completely topic, also thinking lot delay cases deaths. Around say ""wait two weeks"" joke ""wait two weeks"". exact delay varies location time. compare deaths cases graphs worldmeters (7-day average best) get good estimate exact offset (assuming changed recently). France around 30 days, Wisconsin 25 days, Czechia 5 days. higher number is, better! faster infection people die, worse things healthcare. longer infection testing lagging, worse things containment. bigger gap better. Meanwhile US suggested tri-state area quarantined, governor NY called act war talk quarantine dropped, allowing travelers NY spread COVID unimpeded forever.

Unless somehow enforce interstate travel restrictions without people clutching Constitution dear life, USA fucked first cluster.  actually butthole steaming men.... .28 would roughly million people dead. Still possible! scary! New Zealand absolute last place Earth I‚Äôd ever expect lie it. exposed Trump first time, campaign promised disclose results every test takes, good transparency old man stands good chance becoming president. Religion basic global public health emergency? Sure makes sense. 'Let us pray'..... new record. Saturday places reporting. Mix n match. Sometimes I'll look... Sometimes no. really know difference them. said moment needle breaks skin I'll know. Tingle head, clammy n south there.

It's always often not. Right feel idea cause super spreader events whack. bar packed students college town trick treaters. 8 year old daughter got tested days ago made little nose wriggle it.  takes 3 nurses hold shot, really must bad. got bad right school started back up. I'm right - even Sturgis, less fine. school year started climbed climbed climbed. at... something like 12 active cases summer, autumn came shot turned 'round since. 

I heard confirmed case school shut one day starting back up. Buulllllllshit. want see birth certificate! *The long form birth certificate!* wouldn‚Äôt take far. masks help. somebody like Biden (I‚Äôm guessing) get‚Äôs advised dozens people daily, still considerable risk. 

It‚Äôs literally worst year imaginable 78 year old nominee. unlikely police department could match current salary, would particularly interested hiring someone 40s law enforcement credentials experience. 

Gee, imagine that. police officer gets pick choose laws mandates enforce bad judge doesn‚Äôt interpret laws impartially court. 

Is actually happens though? would failure criminal justice system; failed criminal justice system reformed replaced.

If believe rare hypotheticals common objective reality. Damn, opened back up!? work office one wears masks work. Ever. asked could work home, told could not. Help. You‚Äôre never going convince majority people take bunch measures inconvenient scientifically unproven possibly avoid getting virus 99% people recover from.

You‚Äôre never going get young, horny kids stop going bars parties possibly avoid getting virus virtually chance killing them.

People selfish. It‚Äôs dog eat dog world. Always was. I‚Äôm sure shock people. swear, feel like could IQ tests cold outside, make cold inside? did? Damn noticed Note anyone looking get tested: unless something changed, rapid tests much less accurate other. Unless need rapid result, would trust nose swab/spit tests. Obviously point dumb unconstitutional. Tread harder daddy government UwU Better none get two nose swabs nostril. flu, one covid. hurt.. Oh &amp; took two weeks get results back. came negative.  asthma fairly bad. wants civil war started, sure, attempt mandate masks. Americans ready take back country greedy politicians reaching government ASAP! Yeah, federal government handling things really well. Unfortunately can‚Äôt said provinces (specifically conservative governments, course). Huh. bout that. America longest running episode ""When keeping real goes wrong"". Thanks concern. gets reported everyday whether cases - sometimes people choose post  That's absolutely outrageous. selfishness without bounds. ridiculous reasons people give wearing mask, religion easily absurd. Stop logic Canada, you‚Äôre going make reddit implode. Lol what? realize Ontario Quebec shutdowns month plans open anytime soon? Quebec city yesterday 

Added amount ""open"" Sweden magnitude 2x 4x higher Ontario/Quebec even BC ever was. That's awful feeling. used happen lot teens, especially crowded, stuffy places. passed twice though, symptoms described, experienced dozens times. suddenly went away happened past 20 years.

Do watch needle going avoid looking? Would looking help? Muffin. Honestly using US reference useful understand numbers mean US numbers highly reported known Herd immunity comes fucking vaccines lmao. Thats people used argue. 

People champion herd immunity saying give everyone arent vulnerable covid develop immunity doesnt mean dick... young people middle aged adults die masses shit Also Massachusetts wife also teacher. I've fly wall strategy debates; consensus seems hybrid sustainable. Schools tried seem shutting down.

Also, based saying reading bunch letters editor, impression parents pushing super hard reopen childcare reasons claim socialization kids. regs separation schools negate lot social aspect, especially younger kids? husband works Hendrick well I've heard him, much detail. just...don't know what's going happen next. worried mad people city caring enough people wear mask stay away restaurants.

Thank do. That's inadequate, best cautious encourage people same. That‚Äôs second positive person camp today. Must standards! Must lick boot corporate gods cost! big money man says goes, matter what! lowly workers, literally keep business running, must live die boss, silly forgetting :) 
Again, argument bizarre naive. Workers right safety jobs. It‚Äôs batshit crazy lol I‚Äôm sure unions really grind gears huh? Workers rights?? like greedy assholes getting little uppity taste! dare think matter. countries lockdown failed significant informal economy people working day eat - NZ basically lockdowns occur without people forced go avoid starving hard believe! Aarrrrgh! nothing realistically control people listen. 

The thing try provide aid businesses/schools allow safely reopen. someone wants inhale covid infested air that's freedom so. Please remember keep discussion civil topic. Off-topic political discussion removed per Rule 4. Thanks! parent miss two weeks work over. (Not defending explaining - hourly workers often means income) 0.28% population, 1.4% infected. Remember, numbers we‚Äôve measured far! first cold Covid-Winter coming. Yeah, awful going work every day, going shopping, pubs, sports events, hanging friends etc economy around destroyed. Dat big mask energy medical exceptions largely BS too.

A recent study found even people severe COPD wear masks claims can‚Äôt wear mask religious medical reasons lying part. don‚Äôt want wear one. That‚Äôs Make Well know, made post think put entirety nuanced opinion matter one place expect get attention. Next time I'll sure include novel every post argumentative troglodytes.

Facts matter, indeed. vagueness lack dates detail belie efforts Fauci apologist. Fauci claiming back 2017 pandemic coming 100% certainty, said needed prepare, would included enough PPE hand it. sat atop NIAID, apparently nothing ensure prepared pandemic Fauci somehow knew coming 2 years advance. arrive, known highly infectious, Fauci mocked mask wearers, scolded said Covid-19 big deal. I'm sorry, make lame excuses Fauci day long, going behavior alone, one could forgiven thinking wanted spread could sell Moderna vaccine financed struggling get patented approved. Covid-19 solved problems. means playthrough plague inc failure. I‚Äôm sorry deal that. Thank do. don‚Äôt understand schools thought could contain spread coronavirus flu spreads like wildfire year year.   Probably become place discuss ‚Äúlong COVID‚Äù long term effects COVID general population. True, could try force state‚Äôs hands keep pulling card every time county refuses enforce it. course, approach horrific Trump brought states wouldn‚Äôt bow months ago would better Biden either (also, good luck getting Democrats Congress override veto).

States counties even cities aren‚Äôt full people exactly ideas. Parts Texas mask rules outdo parts California. Even places notoriously crazy, plenty people not. 

Denying people resources necessary community indeed day day life flat evil bold moves democrats win, trading one evil another isn‚Äôt one them. Certainly. Wikipedia:

""Minimally defined, authoritarian government lacks free competitive direct elections legislatures, free competitive direct indirect elections executives, both.[7] Broadly defined, authoritarian states include countries lack civil liberties freedom religion, countries government opposition alternate power least following free Iran demonstrated, elections superspreader events, that's another cyanide pill US swallow finally getting orangutan office 2021. So, kid feverish coughing y'all call parent guardian send packing right? Filthy fasvist every single time see comment like move day stop wearing mask one day closer reality. That's important Lol wut Natural selection. Lake County here. We‚Äôve pretty well masks. Rarely see anyone wearing one. seen couple anti- mask rants since spring. example. Wear mask set foot door. Tell family ""no"" get-togethers, make sure everyone knows why, w/ delivering message &amp; mom.  shit Sherlock! live Texas anti-mask sentiment proliferating. I'm also considering moving Canada seem government governing lot finely honed. 

Take minister Canadian Heritage instance -

Just badass Bye bye America It‚Äôs still better shape Trump son it? Definitely get point winter. Next week.... could see happening absolutely destroyed economy though. worth it? doubt Well yeah, that‚Äôs people ADHD stimulants. It‚Äôs adderall, et al calm down/gives focus, makes everyone else bonkers. early months pandemic, expecting swab test norm anymore, yet... religious proscription masks. made-up excuse.

Religion helped spread virus world. People around gone ""its hoax"" ""its big deal"". Unbelievable No, panic attack. familiar symptoms vasovagal response me... Ringing ears, red tunnel vision, drop pulse bp.
The second needle breaks I'll know I'm good not. times body react well... I'll get instantly clammy goes there.
The tight throat trouble breathing/dry mouth new 
I liquid food protocol 12 hrs too. Starting sound like broken record! March June, doctors still scrambling understand disease treat it. would imagine survival rate people 60+ improved since then. Specially better access testing, less crowded hospitals, medications help make disease less severe. Maybe switch worst upon us? 

Or winter coming! Dual meanings, true! (Kill me.) So? anything, proves America handled even worse thought. world virus get nursing home easier family home? Nursing homes taking double triple precautions. 

Ask Cuomo NYC. tell how: Americans care people. wear masks sure hell anything wear one ensure someone ELSE safe.

It's know gets trouble, know sure ain't so. No, China might better travel halloween election day? two options coming DC. Dangerous stupid. suppose celebration altar capitalism something simply cannot postponed. also clearly violating mask restrictions BAG public spaces. kind activities deserve fines organizers blatantly ignore public health regulations. see end story next summer. Infuriatedly watching local politicians passing hot potato til drops otherwise ok, thank you. Maybe Dark Knight version, one works Poison Ivy yells ""BAAAAAAANE!"".  China strictly locked Wuhan less strictly locked places, built hospitals quarantine centers, shipped food, groceries medical workers less affected provinces, announced unambiguously treatment covered government healthy people afford stay home, sick people hesitate get care, hospitals overwhelmed. also boosted testing, contact tracing PPE production.

Sadly Western country, except NZ perhaps, believe already late much destined late due current political atmosphere. media politicians wasted time attack China's response socialist, totalitarian undemocratic, governments citizens reluctant use tools necessary, non-ideological, objective tools work virus works. delay, community transmission everywhere nobody reinforce anywhere else, people longer maintain social distancing due lack monetary material support.

I'm sorry sound hopeless. cannot see chance ending Western countries frankly nothing done end it. Maybe there's chance vaccine comes out, US, everyone's mercy antivaxxers. American exceptionalism finest. live India. India everything open, people regardless that, colleges open yet. belong college, people come country. Basically, friends away me, likely stay like long time too. roaming outside restrictions there, sad/a bit angry people lower risk covid higher risk mental problems isolated, people higher risk covid allowed everything, even cinemas now. mandatory work home possible. little late I'm afraid. air contains oxygen. bar

Is freedom give come think of? truly sheltered. problem. Painless, accessible, widespread, free, rapid result testing already place USA. emphasized? people might also say economy = health levels compliance. one weeks, even NZ. NZ locked late March late May Auckland locked August. 4 day stays basement also effective. Nasty kids made nasty people, serves right.  Stupid sexy Flanders!  Ive never claimed ‚Äònormal‚Äô. say it‚Äôs recommendations. Advice. restrictions penalties fines jail. politics they‚Äôll sent home die drug-induced stupor.

Also lies Bew measures approved morning still shutting schools.
Too little, late.  Yes almost certain. I‚Äôm anti vax. kids normal routine vaccines, despite one kids allergic reaction one newer vaccines , chickenpox one think.

But reason I‚Äôm getting vaccine time army. army gives sorts unusual vaccines. Smallpox, anthrax, stuff almost one gets. soldier unit reaction one vaccines, went coma. eventually came coma survived, although medically retired due problems stemming vaccine.

I‚Äôm taking vaccine somethjng presents virtually risk me. I‚Äôm 1 million 30 year old preexisting conditions dies covid say told ya so. I‚Äôm vaccinating kids either Australia. Never heard seniors must remain isolated months risk lives leave house. 

Not true countries also NZ Australian sphere influence, take lead NZ Au, rely heavily foreign policy aid. Sweden also restrictions. Anyone claiming ""life normal"" happening Sweden spring shows absolutely zero clue they're talking about. Yes. Thank you, will! ‚Äúwe‚Äù meant Australia..you know one country all. ND one lowest population densities US. Outside major cities, *hard* get infected.  testing thing? Well wouldn‚Äôt first time Abbott breaks rules  got proxies like Tim Wilson Dan Teehan back May, Morrison never gets hands dirty.
This time around he's got Josh Frydenberg Greg Hunt harness. richest powerfully amongst worst world. 

Ironic isnt it? I'm Melbourne, area moderate number active cases (moderate Melbourne, anyway). actually quite interesting seeing everyone handling it. 95+% mask compliance, reasonable social distancing, on.

Online shopping pickups (click collect) norm, works mostly smoothly. Supermarkets normal.

It's pain, sure, 'first world problems'. IOW; we're fine. investing silver might. Ha! RIP country :( False positive shouldn‚Äôt high all, maybe one 100-200 positives.

Why? everyone actually acknowledges actually work, carries charade anyway. find odd. But, also sequence genome every virus see caught (each transmission virus mutate little). Even community get good idea people caught virus we've missed anyone. Ah see.

I've depressed since january 2020 social life, might've guessed, gotten better all. Without solution herd immunity.

Or, know, using normal circumstances loudly touted technological advances eliminate virus. 

Which eminently doable political it. 

Only problem hurt corporate interests. 99% covid deaths people 40. Africa's population extremely young. Uh duh, day mandated NZ (public transport only) 99% wore them. Short answer, no. Make sure attention details study research. Or, maybe, want shoulder burden worlds mistakes shoulders again.

But go ahead say ""less cooperative"" American People tired shouldering world's problems I‚Äôm actually amazed we‚Äôre demanding proof abilities every hour every day admit they‚Äôre charlatans  used love Costco, compare prices don‚Äôt deals.

Either slowly, 10 years, without overburdening healthcare fast resulting massive deaths completely overwhelming hospitals. remind American exchange student shared office with. Can't forget eyes turned widely open first discovered college student many countries barely pay tuition fees... Nearly 40% single country massive percentage. travel state state guaranteed constitution

It long discriminate done reasonable health grounds. think may politics rather constitution.

I agree fully states federal. saying that, real world, top downplaying virus makes near impossible state enforce.  Yeah, show good things election voters asked biggest concern - covid, economy, paying mortgage putting food table, climate change. worry medium long term we're pretty happy are. yet remains one safer areas. problem isn‚Äôt travel itself, it‚Äôs risk spreading/catching things arrive.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* either go elimination effectively pursue ""herd immunity"" policy. 

Those two stable outcomes -- virus everyone gets infected. [I'd think 5 cases 28,000 tests per day cult mean DJT followers since he‚Äôs claiming he‚Äôs ‚Äúimmune‚Äù restrictions. always masks. That‚Äôs inspiration  tests normal patients get sensitive ones used study. would economically unfeasible use ultra high sensitivity tests masses. colleges (after BC call outs) largely good job. said public schools zero testing plan. source? abiding overstep slightest. Ya, say... 20.9% nationwide positivity rate lead full blown shutdown. would ridiculously high. Pneumonia super bad deal. lot people take months recover that.

Look I‚Äôm super upset worried economy, too. government could lot lessen blow economy. one thing would improve economy getting rid virus. states didn‚Äôt lock still economically struggling. Getting rid virus cures economy too, see that? winter won‚Äôt fun Jokes schools still closed *cries*

(Note think schools still closed still heartbroken kids state family) crude oil turns effective cure?!? wait holidays Yes, students university don‚Äôt seem care. much close talking without masks. taking insult clearly insecure age envious youth, I'm spewing facts ignores fact astronomically testing 3rd wave first two.

I'm remotely suggesting (like will) case levels solely driven testing- especially %positive ramping back up.

But idea many cases actually existed first wave testing largely completely unavailable Idiots ""When someone shows are, believe first time.""
Maya Angelou done? require masks openly flaunted wearing it. create crowd size restrictions. enforce it. implement effective contact tracing. inform us right away masks. acquire enough ppe hospitals even now, 9 months later. go emergency production ventilators. get adequate testing. even test president country daily basis like falsely promised would do. wear masks test debate next potential president despite signing agreement would.

When state done plenty pretending done? still first wave. daughter remote learning. school 3 cases entire 1st grade class quarantined. We're 46 days in. teacher forgets mask sometimes close proximity kids. kids forget put masks on. Last week watched teacher put hands kids face teach sight, basically hiding eyes. I've started video recording moments.

It's schools. glorydays__bruce_springsteen.mp3 misleading. say officially worse based confirmed cases, second wave daily deaths wasn‚Äôt bad first. 3rd wave hasn‚Äôt exceeded second. Again, terms deaths. Increased testing people willing get tested course increase cases. There‚Äôs deaths actually reported less. There‚Äôs huge tick lung related illness deaths deaths compromised immune systems didn‚Äôt know covid partially related

Even half ass mask measures everyone sanitizing it‚Äôs still infected like 10 million Americans killed 200,000 them...

([More like COVID owes flu, killed flu could‚Äôve killed. worry guys. captain said ""if half testing would half cases"" LOL Yes! It‚Äôs exactly hospital worker wears photo article. tallied deaths like European countries, we‚Äôd 85,000-95,000 deaths. 

99.9% survival rate anyone 69 years age. Sometimes, facts hard swallow build narrative them.

The cure cannot outweigh effects disease. matters mostly Rt. Rt 1 Sweden, spring. Sweden losing control, spring. wonder one he‚Äôs talking about? Surely Phizer wonder Moderna caught up. also know internationally people looking Oxford I‚Äôve never felt priority US. I'm curious amount testing netherlands.vs us per capita.. know people believe covid US , several people family group friends (one friend test positive) getting tested going power want quarantine work .. one particular going parties too. What's like Netherlands people generally get tested symptoms think anyone's trying hide ? Equivalent 117,000 US cases Never got hit. Stop wave crap. ongoing issue. think people convincing risk risk worth taking tired restricted. People perfectly rational creatures. Unless believe statistics government conspiracy obvious risk actually still need try avoid care getting spreading it. Imagine mean edgy teenager thinks calling people old insults them. Sweden well

By immunity debunked

How think vaccines borders open want import infections countries

Which asked *when open listen anything cases

The horror! Speed limits smoking bans literally save lifes. moment, closing bars, working home, online education, distancing wearing masks. involve contact people thus potential risk infection, overwhelming healthcare system &amp; people dying.

I'm Italian also opposite far-right know people specifically curfew (the article mention masks like say), curfew prevents *outside* (low chance infection) even go walk, exercise, take dog out... absolutely nothing prevent spread virus authoritarian display power. small positive effect nightly curfew also far outweighed negatives IMO, decreased overall support far effective measures, unconstitutionality (at least Belgium), increased anxiety/stress, inability escape toxic family situations... Time tell. I'm *for* measures like gathering alcohol ban FYI, general curfew. great time compromised supply chain drugs antibiotics. Lock down. Two months. Go. Positive attitudes lead positive results Right. Nothing drastic first wave 

New York State still double death rate Florida based 2 months outbreak ‚ÄúSir, two wives already receiving treatment.‚Äù read Chinese learned open it. long ago came across discussion subreddit fact contact tracing system US(?) consider 15mins ""close contacts""? sure exact time something like 15mins. early year (Feb Mar think) China already reported transmission cases 15 sec time contacts. still living Europe back then. following news worried family China. local contact tracing reports every province. research done local CDC experts, broadcasted TV programs every local channel, every day. virus started Europe, disappointed pretty much nothing.... ""country highest standards"", namely Switzerland.... Cold weather drives people inside easier transmit virus (this see spikes respiratory illness winter). People also becoming complacent disregarding mitigation tactics often. Pray God virus mutate become virulent deadly like 1918 flu did. would create perfect storm we'd likely see deaths well millions US alone. I'm saying countries well, Sweden problems all.

I saying situation wildly exaggerated, painting picture place people dying streets society collapsing.

Sweden *alright*, nothing more, nothing less. Russia come vaccine months ago? How's things working Russia? People still skipping falling tall building windows? schools. cases infection coming light. Come coronavirus discussion, stay Frightened Rabbit references. Life free die really cute, fanciful slogan. people 2020 believe abstract concept liberty always prioritized tangible issues like public safety societal stability. Third wave? I'm sure ever left first. Pence tested positive yet? get it. Still rookie numbers. Look Belgium. rocking 18k infections. US get level would need 572k daily infections. Say Sweden, least public health experts calling shots. Wish could say country. Would better made numbers? Nope. get told often subreddit reopening mistake. 

Very people reopened without masks. vast majority people wearing masks. guess we're bound repeat history whenever pandemic comes towards us. Wow close elections too. timing is.... so...


also flu reporting 89% compared last year....


oh right. stub toe‚Äî covid
twist ankle ‚Äî- covid
get root canal ‚Äî- covid. 
car accident ‚Äî covid. removed user permanently banned sub. Yet school opening Monday here... trials ongoing. There's also dozens completed trials shown jack shit. We're rounding turn, ya know article Ontario. know party. /Merica much rest US. Positivity rate pretty constant also. Schools one major factors definitely one.  pandemic, I'd go place that! Shhhhh!!!! dare you. Never praise China name game. Doesn‚Äôt matter good good did. 

Keep China hate train chugging. Choo-choooo makes sense, although case I‚Äôd think we‚Äôd start see less growth places it‚Äôs mixers outside winter-I.e. Arizona, outdoor events happen October-April Honestly tomorrow isn‚Äôt improbable. People stopped giving little fuck used give relate, important factors consider choosing live... saying solution let virus run country without plan next 3, 6, 12 months

Like EU, then? Sweden's country far said restrictions meant last long needed, almost EU countries successful lockdowns rushed act like pandemic done soon lockdowns muh NZ, Taiwan, Vietnam, China!

You know countries *didn't* soon got COVID managed? open borders lift travel restrictions. Almost every time NZ gets case, another country. Imagine acted like EU countries opened borders tourism! drove West Virginia yesterday passed church. outside congregation single person wearing mask....such simple thing guess it‚Äôs still hoax 

Oh classic two old men sitting bench gas station people watching. masks one drug resistant. mask politics something major problem 1918 flu well. anything new country Y‚Äôall know science; unlike stupid ole USA. live amongst biggest morons planet; previously suspicion...now confirmed US moron-central, led chief moron, Donald J Trump. Fauci one said ""masks nothing"". He's asshat gave president bad advice start. Bro absolute rubbish. haven‚Äôt seen anyone getting tested near I‚Äôm numbers coming from? areas saw first big wave sooner others. still many states schools aren‚Äôt open don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs schools college 0.11% positivity rate Sounds like want entire families get covid lol 1) trust word coming American.

2) trust word coming American disease

3) trust American dumb enough fall 1 2.

Any gathering people infectious EXCEPT 30+ kids running around god knows mask protocol barely place considering country whole barely keep mask is?

Get clue, idiot. Sweden trying export model, American conservatives general anti-lockdown people trying import it.

There army mindless goons attacking Belgium either. Lmao what? Italy Spain two hardest hit countries early on. It‚Äôs even cold yet country. price pay schools colleges opening back up. haven‚Äôt even begun see bad going get. wait couple months... Well hot take is: lot people, won‚Äôt actually happen. bigger percentage population know people test positive symptoms people recovered quickly. Sorry, pure numbers truth.

Which constant ‚ÄúMask casket!‚Äù ‚ÄúYour gonna die‚Äù ‚ÄúYou crippled life!‚Äù Messaging actually backfires. Nah they‚Äôd rather put words people‚Äôs mouths. Instead saying idiots live ND, took people ND idiots. easy nuance understand yet decided ignorant outrage best. Sweden moved secondary schools universities remote teaching banned gatherings 50 people, effectively stopped sporting events, cultural events, water parks. correct left elementary day cares, gyms, hairdressers, drivers' license offices open. One wave, 3 spikes (so far) Nope. softly worded recommendation came April 1st, almost 3 weeks Denmark Norway announced (in march 11th b√∂r se till att personal och eventuella bes√∂kare h√•ller avst√•nd.

Corona seasonal virus. 4 perpetual strains show this. 2 strains died fast confirm. Covid 19 way confirm it. like herd immunity coronavirus colds. Oh? don't? Tens millions people infected every year? Immunity lasts couple years average? Womp. Mark Meadows administration give damn family lives dies. Vote. would normally agree 100%, live interesting times. line drawn somewhere, well truly fucked.  Fear dangerous virus itself. Overreacting bad underreacting. I'm france company forcing us 2 weeks come workplace 2-3 days week, we've working remote since march without issue. current hospitalisations relate positive cases 2 weeks ago.. worrying news. third (the netball) Friday. use AnaLED Beads.  mortality rate actually plummeted US Great! long keep up? long rest world like this, it‚Äôs always one incoming plane boat trip away. 

Our hope effective vaccine children adults (most people don‚Äôt realize current vaccines tested children) effective treatments. live morphine midazolam part pallative cocktail? de nordics does. Oxygen part pallative care also highly debated again, swedens recommendations differ nordic countries. Thats dumb question ask. test identify corona strain, wasnt made influenza, turn negative take corona test influenza. Boy, could possibly thought making 98 percent populace utterly miserable social, cultural, economic financial perspective 7+ months still end sight whatsoever would lead dramatic increase substance abuse mental health struggles? /s

Add extraordinarily anxiety despair-inducing presidential election mix, dark times indeed... kind facts buried propaganda ""there's plenty PPE, plenty tests, plenty hospital care.
They tell us fine print, PPE correct protection needed, tests give results 2 weeks hospital 600 miles away. Remind January 2 months.  close. can't use 10th amendment claim legislative power Article 1, Section 8 (which correctly cited) explicitly given power make laws. Therefore explicitly delegated constitution power make laws 10th amendment apply.

Last sentence Article 1, Section 8-

""To make Laws shall necessary proper carrying Execution foregoing Powers, Powers vested Constitution Government United States, Department Officer thereof.""

If argument correct, 10th amendment would prohibit legislature making laws all, clearly dumb free pass laws requiring masks. Congress free make national law.

That works. State laws governments subject constitution federal government. allowed violate constitution either. Again, supreme court strikes state laws unconstitutional time.

If national mask mandate unconstitutional, state ones. vice versa. Helio- send helicopter directly house? guess it‚Äôs threat point they‚Äôre increasing regulations masks know restaurants closed early due like mentioned.

Hopefully increased threats make people learn hasn‚Äôt worked well far extra 100k deaths unofficial covid deaths plus deaths due related issues? Yeah. ""[85% people got virus wearing claim comes from. ignores fact that, many people caught coronavirus wore masks *most time*, wearing wearing one caught it. washing mask Also, rude? heart condition reason pro athlete consider whether season worth it.

Lol.

You made emotional statement grounded sort fact. feel bad.  agree completely. Swedish culture seems lend well warnings guidance rather restriction, people simply followed government trusted, knew would provide safety net left work. situation totally different: it‚Äôs every man himself, many citizens simply forgotten left live squalor die, billionaires flourish. It‚Äôs become quite dark. We‚Äôre hoping vote darkness less two weeks! Wish us luck. need it. contract tracing methods countries would invasion privacy U.S.

Which part constitution forbids contact penalties defying govt health orders would also tough sell U.S.

Yeah, like harsh penalties endangering public safety. clearly laws US that. It‚Äôs done one school. make thing. leads us question good economic system literally demands death millions change? relevant allowed ask questions? Good lord. debate? 

My compassion really running out. American hope approach taken Europe. time wait perfect data. people die decision taken.

Delaying approval check long immunity lasts complete joke well. could add 6 months onto time period always monitor people vaccinated. gave award behalf you. :-)

I think important part original poster said desire thing that's keeping over. husband straight day jobs, also working band. canceled entire season year, regrettably gladly we're trying part get back playing sometime next year.

With weaponizing particular issue, skeptical actually happen. always going bad. never bad. Never. could google find out.... Swung folks‚Äô today discussed thanksgiving, they‚Äôll drop plate we‚Äôll give plate ours. We‚Äôre bummed can‚Äôt spend together, yet thousands people crowded stadium. Exactly. avg person can't process statistical exponential curve/growth. reason drove home drunk drink driving bad. know someone died even wearing seat belt proof seatbelts useless. üòê

I'm finding worse thing people can't think critically seeing people infected dying serious case. can't process 99.5% survival rate 330,000,000 Americans means still close 1,000,000 Americans getting ready die. see 1 2 people dying big deal. Little minds can't process it. Lockdowns 2nd week November incoming I'd rather not. responsibility lies partially media, put article article saying ‚Äúlife never go back normal‚Äù depressing shit good reason. idiots taking innocent them. something simply infects making poor choices. people make poor choices putting everyone around risk too. Interestingly Denmark higher new cases/day 7 DMA Sweden adjusted population. Drier winter air leads smaller water droplets, let virus travel further. wearing mask becomes important, whole 6 feet distance thing true anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

So together winter means virus travel further, live longer, people indoors together longer periods time. Kiwi here: Taiwan, Thailand Vietnam da real MVP time another leader give go.  Vote please everybody get vote. mean starting return normal though? Like live even though flu every year. going get worse worse effective widely available vaccine? It‚Äôs tested one school closed sewer system. doesn‚Äôt make thing elsewhere. Certainly city even neighborhood level. Unless figured that?

 think that's silly point make. Pride inner city living/ hospitals people affected MUCH greater rates

Fti: work hospital. Im aware covid progression. Rural hospitals top line capable least venting Finding artifacts areas climate changes usually frozen areas. diseases time. Exactly, even germiphobic people starting get worn lower guard. becoming numb all. numbers becoming meaningless day.. one day.. BAM! someone know bad case covid.  national testing contact tracing program

Unfortunately US, many idiots keep repeating testing useless fear 'govt control' means contact tracing poor. studies coming showing uncontrolled spread many states. Also saw story yesterday El Paso [airlifting patients hospitals El Paso [up 300% past  (Edit - see shiruken‚Äôs comment data!)

I hope stay-at-home order followed helps turn dire situation around. Yeah I'm definitely rooting states seeing continued tragedy. little sympathy reject science, loads sympathy reject science risk everyone around them. bad place hope people eventually wake reality literally everyone infected. Yeah, like regular flu Yah think?  worries. get bottom it. That's true, Utah absurdly low mortality many months define lockdown probably matters lot people using term lots different ways. 

Fully limited mobility regular enforcement ensure compliance? Significant restrictions people‚Äôs day day movement? Shelter place orders limiting work activities?

Despicable think French smarter us? know might sound trivial many elderly beloved relatives 80s 90s may never see doesn‚Äôt feel trivial. course overall skipping Thanksgiving Christmas 2020 isn‚Äôt huge deal greater scheme things. angry Trump administration completely bungling pandemic response. creating division country masks etc. sort political statement. mention lies vaccines coming it‚Äôs going magically disappear! didn‚Äôt like competent leader staff Washington. colleagues essential workers, don‚Äôt know is,‚Äù Mr. Caputo said call, recorded Mr. Erwin provided Journal. ‚ÄúI cannot wait tell president,‚Äù Mr. Caputo said another point plan. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going love Erwin said call: ‚ÄúSince would Santa serious favor, Santa would definitely Caputo said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in, Santa, you‚Äôre in.‚Äù

**Why Can't America Make Enough N95 Masks? 6 Months Pandemic, Shortages Oh, see. Thanks answer. Neither one super high risk since one person, never know. 1. pass whatever want. take ages courts get it. pass again.

2. stretch supremacy clause far want right arguments Supreme Court rubber stamps it. pack court ignore don't. 

3. Mask mandates fall public health general welfare anyways, ""constitutional scholar"" act pointless. 

If Trump done nothing else, shown us government whatever hell wants one stop it. voters stop it.

Thankfully he's finally agreed go hospital stubborn past week. way contact though, phone off. I'm going drop stuff tomorrow ask take him, hopefully they'll that.

I feel millions upon millions people family members suffer horrible virus, hope world moves towards view defeat rather giving people they're old.

When people say ""it affects old people"" clear they're disconnected. people well . Also many young people severely affected :/ days 7-10 generally days watch carefully. maladaptive immune response could kick in. Thinks watch for: extreme fatigue, shortness breath, oxygen saturation 90 percent range. shocking thing people legitimately thought people going follow school guidelines sick kids.

I mean, parents sending flu/strep/pink eye/everything infected children school time COVID. people suddenly think would change? bit insight one lab. We're 5th analyzer. 4 use UTM (universal transport media) meant virus swabs. ones go far back. ones use go nose inches aptima unisex swabs. fucking analyzer (panther) garbage try swab unless to. 

You know would great? fucking support fucking federal government.

Edit:

We waiting beast. stockpiling Covid/flu kits month still can't get damn analyzer. told shipped 2 months now. means tested positive yesterday, right? candidate atleast competent enough follow safety precautions disease he/she aims fight presidency. countries like Korea also rushed return normal life, difference continued actively monitor virus, take aggressive measures cases detected. Koreans taking aggressive measures 100 cases. European country same? Yes totally true still stay home. happened people get together friends family think got you. 

I brought anchor brought up. said South Dakota last state require seatbelts. caught recovered Covid, him. world revolves around alone longer virus threat all. Let rally‚Äôs continue! GA one wearing mask go. talking that. talking US non-private tests. Things might getting bit better states, majority pandemic, government (not Costco - government) failed provide adequate testing people.

I'm done thread: can't think way restate point.  sucks, hope gets dies! 

Why? That's horrible sentiment express. one couple days ago (the nose kind) swab nostrils q-tip. don‚Äôt even go far. Seat belt leads people believe mask wearer one danger realistically mask wearer sober driver vs non maskers drinking endangering others road. feel like it‚Äôs better way expressing thought. people extremely selfish say, don‚Äôt care.

I'm pushing lockdowns, since got wrong I'll tell want. would agree lockdowns solution.  People wearing masks make sometimes necessary.  countries used great effect.  America one March gave sabotaging response since then.

I'd like national mask mandate.  people like can't handle need fined locked down.

A universal mask mandate things like leader lie us time much ask.

I'm starting wonder I'm depriving reason. mean, know I'm interest public health hard see others able go care there's immediate consequences. That‚Äôs easy, national state mask mandate makes difference.

Compliance masks distancing always going slowly go away. that‚Äôs necessarily political thing. Bunch vapid Karen‚Äôs.  USA No. 1!!! Genuinely confused 5 ""Wholesome Awards"". sarcastic joke Covid good ol' fashioned 'Murican fun? What? expecting? Teacher here. Masks thing need go back in-person. school built 1960s major renovation 20 years. HVAC sucks. way going back teach room air move. school also located area one highest positivity rates state.

So far heard that. I‚Äôm sitting county Deep South one 20 respecting mask mandates catching hell 19 it. Fuck south. place armpit. Yes. stop crying send kid home, lile pre-Covid. Cuomo killed many people that. Answer question Britney...it‚Äôs true isn‚Äôt it? certainly case March July really isnt case anymore. teach IB AP courses mostly relatively well families (most wealthier me, upper middle class, truly rich, middle class like me, low income). fine online learnin and/or insisting continue online learning, staying home taking virus seriously. all, vast majority, higher numbers average area, I'd say (which already pretty good mask compliance social distancing). one trusts Florida's numbers. Yes. Parents school literally saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get tested. It‚Äôs magical.‚Äù video sums US 'turning really hope CA get similar point like NY, positive testing % 2%. Everyone basically wears masks am. Definitely gotten lax lately I‚Äôve seen &lt;5 people stores without mask since April Private tests available pretty much every country. another option. physical health. people done done beginning could normal life, like New Zealand. Instead people shriek rights violated act like giant babies. are.

I report businesses refuse enforce mandate. fault. follow mandate. lose business. refusing right thing. fact delicate offer polite suggestions infuriating. 

Ffs listen guy! bro ong bro. wear goddamn mask holy shit private tests available pretty much every country. isnt US thing Ironically, probably fine because, case, federal government stepped &amp; regulated outlet design order protect us citizens. Novel concept. I'm Singapore straight SGD $300 fine wearing mask places restaurants get thousand dollar fines forced closure practicing safe distancing customers. supposed save 10K HSA FSA exchange low premium. genuinely curious cases India going down. think testing going necessarily.

Nor Indian government population practicing lockdown social distancing. anything, lot people become indifferent covid quite opposite.

A shit load people get tested even obvious symptoms govt officials would either admit hospitals, stick notice house infection, stigma associated covid positive.

This may sound ridiculous, see significant portion population (1.3 billion) might've already gone virus. Well, aren‚Äôt acknowledging intertwined. eat food? last checked don‚Äôt grow enough food households. fact complicated situation. floors people don‚Äôt want admit that. Sure, people need stop cavalier best make smart decisions greater good, never said otherwise.

Solutions involve wearing mask , keeping distance, employee contact tracing, self quarantine period could follow rules we'd done thing month like New Zealand is.

My source inside CDC says achieving herd immunity take another 1.5 million lives. mechanism would allow this, could enforced?  Nz small island 5 mil population. Also even finished first wave yet hasnt even population. think expect stay virus free next 10 years ? would like eliminating flu cold, possible. highest deaths per 100k inhabitants world (except San Marino) noone talks it.

Peru officially higher Belgium

Unofficially, Peru 3X official deaths.

The real ranking per capita deaths looks something like this:

1. Peru
2. Ecuador
3. Bolivia
4. Mexico
5. Iran
6. Spain
7. San Marino
8. Brazil/Chile/Argentina/Colombia 
12. Andorra

Capitalism really solution global pandemic, one talking it. Really?? I'm going look that. airplane summer, god bless'er, one flight attendants *immediately* anyone wearing mask properly.

Now, doubt happens every flight, wanted throw parade woman. homie Tywin Lannister put ""Madness, madness stupidity"" mention cliff around corner though ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  ones loops go way around head. That‚Äôs good right?

EDIT: think see happened. website sells earloop masks ‚Äúloose‚Äù whatever quantity want, around-the-head masks packs 10. got 10 packs could get anti-fake code sealed packs. K true.

You lock hard, 3-4 weeks, doesnt matter population have, burn disease out, least point contact tracers mop clusters.

That could work France, UK ... US. police threaten shoot anyone streets without valid excuse - hear good that. testing 1/10th population 16% infected, I'm sure math Covid wrecked world particularly deadly, occupies terrible ""sweet spot"", mild enough people ignore precautions almost always OK, seriously enough everyone ignored precautions consequences would absolutely disastrous. 

You others right thing, difference right themselves, right everyone.

While world owns thanks carefulness, sacrifice wellbeing sake others, long legal area, relatively safe responsible ways enjoy social company, meeting friends outdoors masks/distancing outdoors possible. Take care best. someone catches covid.. let's say work wearing mask customers required catch it. go hospital suspected case, hospital capacity can't treat option get treatment air lifted another hospital, individuals fault, none is. individual responsible helicopter ride costs hospital overwhelmed caught covid anti masker. üôÑ Sturgis, boat parades, back blue, stump rallies -- beating nationalist rhetoric making enemies science educated working great.

They're apparently case study corporate innovation. film market died brink, leveraged domain knowledge processes (chemicals) enter cosmetics market, among things. taking precautions 7 months, might lapsed 2-3 times got tested positive Covid 19.

It's 6 days, constant fever tired. cough running nose headaches chest pains. woke 101¬∞F fever today. 

What's progression symptoms? worst yet come?

The virus care whether ""real online platforms"" not.

And closing schools fact single important thing statement saying ""Here's two people opposite opinions Covid, one got sick. elect one POTUS""

It might belong specific sub, still important Reddittor, like net neutrality posts would go around every year. Well sure, small, uncontrolled study show? honestly can‚Äôt see dependency food security mask mandates. talking friend lives (im US) ive known years playing video game... week shut everything down. jealous way county handling things. even drive fast food open there. could think , ""damn thats smart. hope everyone country takes serious."" now, almost quarter million deaths half year... dont want live anymore. said years, really wish could move. people say ""you dont want live here? Move away.""... Fucking how? gonna pay to, dipshit? Didnt think so. Also, doesnt even matter COUNTRY LET AMERICANS WAY HANDLED VIRUS!!!! boring fucking dystopia. think youre missing importance compounding people cancer covid time ridiculous. government can‚Äôt tell celebrate Thanksgiving house property. make recommendations course. 

No one following orders going enforce it. 'National' mask mandate unconstitutional. State mandates legal. course enforce them. state mandate NC go without one cops enforcing it. Mandates work, consequences.
Beaches closed July 4th weekend UCSB, yet children's surfing classes still held people sand. enforcement personnel sight.  mind do.  second Mormon silent? affects virtually one, we're going make China pay did! never let big deal happen! Also true. There's fewer atheists christians, liberals christians (or believe god). proud country Vietnam, government went beyond protect us citizens pandemic. sure it‚Äôs possible give nasopharyngeal swab? Sounds like mid-turbinate swab. Biden takes office (which hope does), force people wear mask? Even there's mandate, local governors overrule it? I'm actually asking.

And late POTUS suddenly say ""hey guys let's listen science"" previous guy spent months telling base ""don't listen science, know, know better""? feel like damage already done become political issue go away new president. mean look current President, still fight issues political (like climate change universal healthcare) think one available February, yes. signs indicate this. first wave went nursing homes caused lot deaths. many infections much fewer deaths. death rate dropping since younger people infected. Immunity population goes every time someone infected. February keep rate apparently 3x higher prediction saying, vaccine+previous infections easily bring population immunity 50% makes infection slow down. obviously going right continue so, I'm talking happen January/February. listening carefully.

It indeed health sector showing first though death toll per 100,000 Finland, Norway Denmark 1/6th 1/10th Sweden's. much doubt ever catch Sweden.

 Better compare Sweden's performance similar Nordic neighbors rather countries different cultures, demographic health variables, travel frequency, social distancing (Stockholm highest rate one person households Europe, also young adults leave parent's home 18, youngest age leaving home Europe). Honestly worry. I've gone times eat restaurants admittedly nowhere near much usef occasionally. Aslong proper precautions we're taken like social distancing etc fine. described seems like perfectly safe. safe like jam packed restaurants zero social distancing forgot ""Police refusing enforce mask mandates cities counsels issue one."" least stated Pocatello sounds like middle europe me. live see thing like said, lived first wave little problems, people started going out, like dont care still goes on. 

I mean, reckless people predictable second wave going worse, still wild see live this. Export?

I know increase flights India despite importing cases daily months. Stop reporting shot weekends everyone knows weekend results lower due available work force reporting sounds like got OPMT swab also tonsils - oropharyngeal-mid-turbinate. Mid-turbinate means didn‚Äôt go far nose. original intensively uncomfortable one NP - nasopharyngeal, feels like it‚Äôs heading towards brain. Ok, I'm gonna person. agree point American infrastructure needing overhaul. But, live Germany wanted correct misconceptions. First all, large sections autobahn speed limits, especially there's bridge, curves, downhill uphill, crosswinds, etc. really depends are.
Also, though true Germany much way cops checking speed autobahn (or enforcing traffic laws time) definitely rare occasions seen polizei side highway limited speed zones, although pulled over, police car certainly corrected accidental driving trucks-only lane. pretty sure would done something drastic refused get lane sped away.
However, yes, Germany much seem handle driving enforcement way equitable fair, mostly distance. one federal government. One pool federal resources draw from, one congress passing stimulus health care legislation. Restrictions ease domestic travel different international. lot reasons lens looking national perspective important. anti-maskers infected innocent people. totally agree vital get cases control economy. point can't shut economy without providing financial help people they're work businesses forced close. would arguably cause harm. ideal part would US government could get act together actually provide economic support lockdown would viable. congress seem lile capable need new plague. Studies stopped short involved Zithromax hydroxychloroquine due arrhythmias caused. Also current COVID guidelines state use COVID. early tests apparently shoved tip ...ahem... atheists liberals. mocking ""the biggest mask I've ever seen"" came bite Trump ass. wore mask. every time see little Karen snitches like get little bit closer NOT. work well get sick 1st month Yeah, supposed surpass USAs numbers fraction population.... Xinjiang people unfamiliar would really suck got next week though realize Quebec death toll higher sweden?Its relevant unrealistic even bringing Sask, Manitoba etc consideration-these sparsely populated regions world.

17th now. everyone said 10th world. Lets see summer 2021. Also widely accepted made mistakes early nursing homes. later even modified that. Im sorry rolling /partial lockdowns even shutdowns much failure downstream repercussions. I‚Äôm glad hear that. wish family would like you. Instead grandmother sent parody video ‚Äúwe rock you‚Äù ‚Äúwe mock you‚Äù wearing mask. I‚Äôm even US right now. blows mind. Homer's ""everything's ok alarm"" makes especially depressed, beyond said there, see reasonable way resolve it. ground sky, we're basically fucked mentality. 

Even 90% people behaved, 10% remains entrenched nonsense something completely screw attempt 'do better' collectively.

Worse still real issue much country unskilled even basic tasks like driving. 10% smart enough operate motor vehicle because, oh look that, passed test pity-points instead actual merit there's crazy person road (Canada's Worst Driver, anyone?) deal them. reduce everything lowest common denominator functioning society unfortunately that's becoming major issue within itself.

That breeds people legitimate reason treated exactly like everyone else, zero tolerance way society function many people either extremely selfish extremely uneducated (or both)...

Contrarianism, well sarcasm/satire born internet, two severe issues urgently need solve society. :X Two months ago 400k December 1st. I'm guessing estimates range, someone takeee highest number writes news story th Reddit highly promotes news. I'm sure went back folks making model would say upper ends range everything goes completely wrong . vaccine available February? data saying ‚Äúthe susceptible population already hit‚Äù? immunity even spreading? metrics indicating massive accelerations infections northern hemisphere goes winter. stupidity runs deep. get tested every week, go deep feels like wanna find virus personally, painful months say true, seems [NZ] excuse superpowers can't get shit together get somewhat controlled. Waaaahhh, we're big. blow stupid town? It‚Äôs flu. Went last Sunday wound bronchitis. I'd say whatever positive effects would cancelled people grouping together evacuation centers... whole economy damage nonsense. can't healthy economy 80k+ covid cases day. Shutting addressing covid benefit us. state power right now, wanted pragmatic would, right happen. would *you* want express sentiment?

Why emulate something object much? makes seem vindictive *and* hypocritical. Moderna says 1:1 - feels like we're back square one point. Terrifying part deaths end hospitalisations Two months whole population? lol. likely. always going tricky though anyone would lie say stopped deliver food something like that.  I‚Äôm voting Trump wear mask everywhere, socially distance see people. We‚Äôre like  many country getting test easy now. get tested within 2 minutes without doctors request reason. show drive testing. Alot us living testing March-July. would mandate exactly? Would fine wearing? Jail time? would enforced? really need unified message political leaders. close far hand turn around. take get us pass partisanship focus people? Honestly even Biden wins he'll sworn January point much damage would already done. second part people also take seriously listen regulations. still many people give shit. parent (and emergency contacts) answer phone. transportation rely bus kid get home. they're willing leave work come get kid. 

I've education decade. *half* parents come within hours kid pretty sick. 

When go back in-person, we're supposed put kids show symptoms ""COVID room"" wait parents. So, kid strep, might get COVID waiting COVID room kids showing symptoms. oh, yeah--you can't leave kids alone, administrators pressured ""volunteer"" sit supervise fucking sick room. time get 500k-1 million deaths, would least 7 figure number people needed hospitalized (and climbing). then, people either known someone died Coronavirus, likely, known someone hospitalized it.

If seeing someone near dear relatively young healthy considered high-risk group incubated put ECMO change minds, nothing will. ongoing thing. 1st outbreak likely frozen food overseas smaller 2nd maintenence worker worked ship overseas. Prior 102 days since last case. good contact tracing testing put small flair ups easily get early. We'd know cases there. certain flu high fever please save troubles. ER cannot anything flu.   Zyrtec Flonase kick don‚Äôt post nasal sore throat anymore. Normally one allergy symptom first sign ragweed season me. didn‚Äôt ragweed allergy sore throat would concern me. it‚Äôs airborne claim droplet spread masks literally almost useless that‚Äôs literally science says Sounds like watching fake news ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø  mask mandate really good enough, needs enforced. I'm southern California, first state lockdowns mask mandates, see people masks chins, malls packed packed people, people throwing parties time, among worst right (idk per capita) gaaaaaaah tuition. That's care about. Yeah, stick h*rd immunity Trump shouting coronavirus going away people getting sick 

Reality cruel thing Well pretty well known scientific theory. people think world overpopulated. Half country even go outside week. almost died heat exhaustion run couple days ago. nearing months perfect outdoor weather US population. actual healthcare professionals heavily criticized decisions included actively helping lot people. excuses prognosis ‚Äúnot pat back‚Äù justify that. 

Roughly many complained? Sweden employs lot people would classified healthcare professionals I'd surprised find people complain different ways implementing it. Mandating ‚Äúsuggesting‚Äù. There‚Äôs huge difference, clear point. 

That different ways implementing strategy though, take strategy ""flatten curve"". yeah, x6, guess wasn‚Äôt bad hahah. You‚Äôre kidding right?

Nope, number they're willing stand exactly point again?

I've already made point, one trying convince something ask question. Infection rates suppressed limited testing.

Infections growing linearly, makes sense. country grows like this, Trump explicitly said limiting testing. preponderance evidence .... 

Normally grow exponential hitting 100,000 per day would happen tomorrow. starting feel like infinity wave pool. love god please vote, states like North Dakota going keep voting punch face matter what. I've wearing mask religiously whenever go out, I'm hoping true masks go long way prevent people getting sick and/or mild case.

All stuff I've read say ""studies *suggest*"" ""masks *may* help keep getting covid"" know reliable is.

On top that, feel like death rate less known, obviously deady flu, actually reliable statistics many people die instead get lasting complications covid? think I've seen numbers that. Nha trang even area storms came. affected area regions Hue Quang Binh [you look picture see bad , supposed less affected area mountainous higher river delta. can't see point White House bully pulpit drives regional policies areas affiliated White House's political party, can't help you.

Did occur red areas hostile policies would contain spread leader instructing hostile? USA bad stupid Karen something COVID19 name disease. virus called SARS-CoV-2.

And novel virus, family coronavirusses constant subject study many years. Especially SARS outbreak, caused SARS-CoV-1. definitely comparable novelty truly new virusses, like HIV. think leeway now. Imagine scenario king-term effects debilitating. could entire generation become disabled unable work. Florida might hit hardest snowbirds elderly. Everyone coming Florida visit parents grandparents Christmas go back home infect others. I'm Florida social distancing rarely happens lot people still wear masks. 

Overall US accepted pandemic moving lives. Unless gets 5,000-10,000 dying day I'm sure people change. third wave? That's one second! 2% mortality rate (low end) that's dead American every 50 seconds... What's wrong it?

They many poor people flood Europe whites (who paying taxes them) dying out. ain't gonna sink battleship, way. Well they're testing everyone find can‚Äôt believe earlier year thought would 80-90 thousand cases max. get many daily. Donnie would say, ‚Äúit‚Äôs big number nobody‚Äôs ever seen before‚Äù. Anyone else surprised? scams include sale non-existent face masks, **bogus breeders collecting deposits customers dogs think they're buying**, fraudsters claiming offer cheap loans fast-track approval long fee paid upfront. 

What? understand linking fast loans, economical situation caused virus, dog breeders COVID? time tell. Unlike bacteria, viruses good job lying dormant. Getting shingles decades recovering chicken pox fun all.

I'm losing sleep it, still taking basic precautions avoid catching it. certainly want spread someone else. It‚Äôs it‚Äôs highly educated place.

Smart people try protect themselves. It‚Äôs even me. 

It‚Äôs rush. We‚Äôre great vaccines time test adequately ‚Äî every nation rushing one. 

We know vaccines like MMR lifelong health impact around 60/100k people. health impacts getting MMR outweighed risk. That‚Äôs going COVID-19. god I'm glad I've always introvert Yes, that‚Äôs unusual two teenagers miss friends. one high risk, extra careful. Kid #1 regular FaceTime calls friends weather nice sometimes hang outside park backyard wearing masks socially distanced. Kid #2 video games plays online discord voice chat. It‚Äôs perfect helps feel normal! death statistics different nordic countries deaths elderly home? Since Sweden ten deaths Norway sound weird death per million elderly home same.

Surely mean percentage deaths elderly homes same? I‚Äôm sure fought reduced fines. would entity fined significant sum money.  get article healthcare system get overwhelmed point doctors nurses take elderly patients ventilations make space younger patients, like Italy (personally, believe unethical way choose lives dies, that's beside point). Sweden's case could prevented (Italy got hit sooner, know coming bad going be, regardless way choosing gets live unethical worse Sweden's). something new came pandemic, think every country triage guidelines. Doctors kind decisions world, every day. also make mistakes.

Sweden may guidelines there's pandemic going guess rarely use significantly less patients. Clearly reason healthcare system got overwhelmed April pandemic. One thing really get Sweden's leaders keep claiming healthcare system never got overwhelmed? Clearly true. Please give up. taking things one day time (as much possible). Europe similar mandates Asia terrible also? Looks like china cares citizens western world own. see you‚Äôre person culture BBC article linked. treat people pat back saying could. fuck-ups, lack specialists administer oxygen instance (again, per article), even somewhat controversial prognosis ain't good extending amount time they're dying.

And actual healthcare professionals heavily criticized decisions included actively helping lot people. excuses prognosis ‚Äúnot pat back‚Äù justify that. aware strategy yes, I'm always bit confused people pretend countries dramatically different strategies. estimation countries strategy, different ways implementing it.

Not different ways implementing it. Mandating ‚Äúsuggesting‚Äù. There‚Äôs huge difference, clear point. gotta say interesting math study linked says peak number hospitalizations Denmark (Norway) would 133 (231) percent higher, peak number ICU patients would increased 107 (140) percent.

Irrelevant, nothing deaths, know talking about. sure well-educated 10 times higher would 1000%, 231%. Even study cited says actually read model also predicts 466 percent increase deaths, discussed refrain interpreting number causally due presence pre-trends.

Oh yeah, x6, guess wasn‚Äôt bad hahah. You‚Äôre kidding might wanna stop hyperbolic, exactly helpful.

I‚Äôm hyperbolic, I‚Äôm telling facts. Sweden deaths per 100k 58. Denmark 12, Norway 5. Sweden 10 times deaths per capita, article apparently agree shows that, Norway done Sweden, would 6 times deaths. 

So *exactly* point again? We‚Äôve established strategy Sweden chose caused majority 10 times higher per capita death rate. anything left discuss? Ohhhh... Didn‚Äôt even think that. would hilarious!

And sad.... NFL running back would setting lot time year. He‚Äôs 23 years old. it? many people run money able work summer? many months years interest loans avoided governments? shit fucked. There's absolute right answer long distributed vaccine end this. people like get elected? comparison cases COVID-19 countries cases COVID China useless since China refused transparent start. 

They didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcontain pretty well‚Äù simply **did contain it.**


Investigating every country every country investigating itself, except guess who? China. China refusing investigations origins virus. entertained? Karma üòê think many (myself included) still can't fully grasp impactful history

I really believe coronavirus biggest threat international order global security since World War 2. right, era-defining moment. hard grasp history entirety living it, think, one's personal individual life keep moving chugging along things seem almost routine banal. They're different endpoints. US never really left it

It... us along! (not) believe strong enough. That‚Äôs good way describe this. I‚Äôm will, I‚Äôm way. know me, weight doctor. I'm educated human. I'm also probably picture mind think ""obese,"" I'm short stature female muscular build. 

Walking fact great form exercise. say ignorant. thing would change need walk longer distances. lost baby weight (first baby) walking twice day. 

I lost lot baby weight second child, started pregnancy extra 10 lbs previous pregnancy. discussed doctor time wanted wait lose getting pregnant doctor told to, focus losing second (and last baby). gained lot weight second baby, like first, I've lost ton baby weight lost all, technically, weight height (I'm 4'11) classify obese. accept this, know need lose weight. 

But you, like many people sub, distorted view think obese people look like live lives. 

I've lived lot adult life thin person, difference I'm carrying extra weight take time get rid of, I'm sure probably eat general used eat 800-1300 calories day stay thin. probably eat anywhere 1800-2000 calories day. I'm short person, many calories body. math. do, however, healthy diet (as quality variety food consume). 

Literally point, obese, lose sight fact healthy eating staying active still positively impact health. obese person, assume obese person healthy aspects life. one marker health, important, marker good health. countries still struggling beat virus like Indonesia Philippines saw exports recover like Indonesia, Philippines continue increase impacted virus exporting commodities China like Indonesia virus little impact exports. Indonesia, manufactured exports increase 6% August year year. sides immediately flip Biden wins election. Liberals realize it‚Äôs big deal all, conservatives realize every death needs sensationalized Fox News. bullshit? McConnell openly admitted put vote. effect downside may worse read still first wave affecting different parts country. order ‚Äúsecond wave,‚Äù virus would significantly mutate, yet done.

The density Northeast blamed virus spread spring. Scary think virus much worse much less dense areas saw NYC April.  Oh see saying now, thanks source wave, rising roller coaster ride. I‚Äôll happily stay keep guns lack lockdown.  Germany. need juicy vaccine ASAP. Ideally western country. Damn discussion jumped sarcastic asshole? Yes Trump comments effect various Americans (and also effect people countries well) public policy mask mandates shutdown laws determined states, readily see states enacted stringently (like NJ, NY, northeast, etc) fared better places Absolutely. bout pouring trillions world? think effect whatsoever ? Yeah, distinct difference eastern Washington ( conservative area). Went 30%-50% (my estimate) mask usage 95%-98% (official estimate) week half state mandate stores started enforcing it. Stark difference. It‚Äôs like ignoring obvious.

When kids school got sick every September October like clockwork. Can‚Äôt second wave first never ends. Take Europe! Deaths follow. Asymptomatic not. Doesn‚Äôt matter scared media made you, fact surface transmission extremely unlikely. [Here‚Äôs *actual* supports fact wiping groceries completely pointless waste resources.

Relevant study authors tried mimic actual conditions surface might contaminated patient, viable SARS-CoV detected periodically disinfecting surfaces use gloves reasonable precautions especially hospitals, believe fomites contact infected carrier many hours pose measurable risk transmission non-hospital settings. Yes tracking wasnt done western countries March 2020 Apple/Google system stores less personal data current app would. understand saying, state live in? testing shows positive people virus, increase amount people virus. #The 88,971th infected reporting in! even report numbers regularly think takes much much devalue global benchmark devalue small medium sized country‚Äôs currency feel you. incredibly bizarre amount people know just...don't seem concerned anymore. They've moved along news cycle... Given mask mandates everywhere, things seem getting worse better. strange reason, higher rates mask use correlated higher infection rates. least seeing record number deaths, anything close it. Remsedivir neither Stats collected since March-April. Doesnt matter ad infinitum. endpoint. Maybe look around Asian Oceania countries advise? second link study ended patients developed cardio toxicity, known side effect

Nowhere say deliberately poisoned patients unhinged claim


Your first link broken didnt quote anything substance either


To add this, study supports trumps claims treats corona trumps cites quack discredited brazilian doctor give us much credit here. probably better States crazy right wing conspiracies like anti-maskers still manage make way province Depends mean. 

The US basically paralyzed end January. Cases rising, believe basically max compliance masks restrictions slowly fading away, states unable put additional lockdowns/severe restrictions millions work. 

So...depends mean. government gives money corresponding increase goods services, result inflation ‚Äî many dollars chasing goods services.

Guess what? Inflation record lows, decade. It‚Äôs clearly problem right now. Working class people losing everything problem. add, n95s alone still significant number nurses getting infected. really face shields plus n95s. looking like shield knocks aerosols air transmission covid getting eyes seems issue well.

Masks absolutely positively work, high risk environment I'd thrown shield well.  thanks prison eerh ahh. ‚Äúre-education‚Äù camps üëç Lol @ POT.. archie bunker? think devaluing global bench mark do? pray god sarcasm.

Otherwise probably get along really well gestapo, hitler, mao, stalin, nkvd, kgb, etc. also said wear masks one asking people spend time inside isolated, many things done ensure people socialize safely making changes interactions. opening windows allow airflow maybe fan windows pull air inside out, wearing mask. People fulfilling social interactions still limiting spread virus. also one situations somone putting risk putting others well live bubble.Though sympathize somone facing terminal illness chooses partake activities high risk without precaution, decision affect affects others well. affected would issue all. think miss representation people try follow social distancing guidelines fearful, fear, sense protecting others. really wish word fear would stop thrown around instance,. afraid somthing though covid 19. Im afraid ignorance lack caring general population.  chicken egg, South Korea went hard they've got close memory SARS knew exactly prevent it. Relatively speaking, SARS spread far general assumption Europe back February whatnot it'd burn need drastic moves.

I mean started Europe spread FAST. UK went general ""wash hands"" message locking country next week cases going roof.

Once virus hundreds contact points incredibly hard put virus back bag. I‚Äôm fucking depressed. Fuck this. America destroying virus watch Mormon church first formed encouraged reproduce grow church much possible. time best way many kids. also reason early church embraced polygamy. time became ""tradition"", sense. drop polygamy thing however order Utah admitted union state.  Why? We‚Äôre like two months away vaccine rolled places open tho restrictions. read articles refuting claim.  happen treatments help drastically. dad almost died January doctors legit couldn‚Äôt diagnose it. classified pneumonia confused. ventilator everything. came literally nowhere. totally sound like human being! /s It‚Äôs majority... lot people wearing masks. work retail rarely see anyone without mask on.

So majority Americans wearing mask certain parts country don‚Äôt believe wearing masks.

Big difference there... people receiving unemployment benefits they‚Äôre South Africans? I‚Äôm ignorant country‚Äôs system. doesn‚Äôt say whether legal immigrants not. Either way, food banks? guess depends are, neighborhood really many people ''crowded''.  Redirect first post: live Massachusetts Latin Black communities really listen lockdown rules. Agree 100%. RTFA, bottom. Australia things basically back normal too, besides universities, live music, fact ‚Äòsign in‚Äô every hospitality venue visit (no big deal).

Really mindfuck one places entire world seen widespread devastation, besides 1 month hard lockdown, *still* people complaining we‚Äôre living dictatorship.

Lockdown works, it‚Äôs proven fact. think bigger issue fact America doesn‚Äôt social support people even willing go lockdown. example here, immediately set financial support scheme, majority country got within weeks. say black communities less likely social distancing, masks, preventative measures, giving vaccine ASAP means everybody less likely say it, unpopular obvious reasons.

All available data shows black communities likely social distancing, masks, preventative say black communities deserves safety, healthcare, government assistance everyone else, unpopular obvious reasons.

And say need due socioeconomic factors?

That said, agree pretty weird. won‚Äôt find info support it, ridiculously untrue. sad scary situation. Stay safe, best can. Well, cleric much trouble resurrecting one falsehood post, yet get downvoted. Fauci cult personality sad. important matters people. Go Gaga Bieber something. Covid, think there'd lot potential people least work there... reasonable internet.

My grandma still lives grew up. I'd love go spend couple months her. work remotely. DSL speeds worse dial-up city early oughts. can't work that. There's cell service either. 

Until internet treated regulated like utility, rural areas *no* hope. fucking year.

The crazy thing is, used things there. grandma young, youth dances, church put sorts activities, things happened. population cut 90% since then. least need *some* people around make things happen. Many ‚Äôexperts‚Äô proven untrustworthy course outbreak. continue following precautionary principle endless ‚Äôappeal authority‚Äô attempts.

In summer employer allowed work-from-home due infection risk, even dozen corona cases city. 70 cases, employer wants come office, safe now. biggest skeptical question relates vaccine first Coronavirus history. sudden Covid-19, develop one now? Thats second wave. 
We need prioritize essential employees. 
It serves purpose vaccinate 58yr old preexisting conditions said person quarentine avoiding outdoors opposed people taking care mail, sanitation, sewage, healthcare, police officers 60+yr old. 
Second wave would kids, teachers people preexisting conditions. Third wave rest us healthy enough even catch it, pull through. 
Without essential personnel, u wont able buy food, ur garbage street uncollected, police officers firefighters wouldnt able attend emergencies less healthcare providers would mean less people take care hospitals.

In essence, people biting bullet point people preexisting conditions elderly going buy food essential personnel. COVID-19 infections spike uncontrollably across country, California turned brutal summer one worst coronavirus hot spots, populous state country touted success Hospitalizations down, positivity rates declined lowest they've been. 14-day positivity rate 2.6 percent, hospitalizations shrunk peak 7,100 late July 2,351 Thursday. coming, wait little longer. meantime:

In fact there's 15 party next door right Bars CA TX states shut again, yes. Others mitigations place, increasing impact mobility slowdown. y'all exactly arguing for? going ask even care, appears answer clearly NO. press charges? that's thought Seems strong seasonal variance Reff. Pathways transmission easier cold.

For example warm weather Reff 2. Social distancing brings 45% 1.1 10% population immunity get Reff sustainable point. However people spread winter give Reff 4. 45% social distancing reduction brings 2.2 would still need 60% population immunity bring infection rate sustainable level. Given actual deaths around 350,000 moment would incredibly lucky 150,000 deaths next 4 months. Ah, see now. Thanks lulz, kind sirs/madames! people colour wear masks?

That‚Äôs 1918 Spanish flu numbers I, one, wait know certain aren‚Äôt unwanted effects vaccine. bars restaurants shut region July spike mid west, CA, TX FL? im living Atlanta month would agree. dunno, depend. discounts people struggling. mother nurse, one thing told long keep bill current (like paying $10) cannot legally send collections. enter payment plan agreement hold you. everyone going get anyway, unfortunately. matter time realise genuinely tyranny looks like, right?  hidden administration. **The article match headline. POC singled group early 65 join frontline health care workers, residents underlying medical conditions increase risks COVID-19, essential workers first qualify COVID-19 vaccines Massachusetts, Baker administration said Tuesday.

No mention plan also outlines messaging efforts make sure people know, vaccine available, approved federal government safe effective,‚Äù Baker said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll also make priority reach specifically groups disproportionately impacted COVID-19, including people communities color.‚Äù

This means public information campaign strategically placed vaccine clinics. 

[This article Boston.com confirms vaccine priority groups Healthcare personnel likely exposed treat people COVID-19

2- People increased risk severe illness COVID-19, including underlying medical conditions people 65 years age older

3- essential workers.

**This response wrote realizing headline match article.**

Prioritizing people color group seems likely fuel anger partisanship. also quite match science.

We know black people, Hispanic people Native American people dying higher rate white people. three groups likely underlying conditions less likely reliable access healthcare. [About 11 percent white people went uninsured, compared 20 percent Black 33 percent Hispanic Black Hispanic people also far likely work essential industries service positions. [The Black population makes 12 percent overall workforce, 26 percent public transit employees Black. Hispanics make 17 percent workforce, 40 percent building custodial also issue people color likely live crowded housing. structural problems intersection class race.

There evidence sociological factors. racism stresses stress shortens life. 

If prioritize people color, white essential worker like grocery store cashier would wait vaccine POC work home office job would part first round. make sense. Vaccinating people sector health status would make far sense scientific perspectove cause less conflict. think underestimating many people wearing masks told they're required to. 

I see plenty people walking around masks around necks, people take one bag entering store. They'll mask time enter space requires to. second leave, take mask again. work several people refused wear mask building ""recommendation,"" immediately started became requirements. mask mandate would essentially expand many places become mandatory masks, hopefully lead people wear often. 

Yeah, probably get 100% compliance, that's necessary. Community masks one layer swiss cheese model. expected one measure 100% effective, every improvement effectiveness counts. work University Illinois sooooo grateful don‚Äôt get nasal swabbed every week. good twice week people test 3 times week. grateful work place get tested frequently. Villas? It‚Äôs November next week. South France even warm now? Seems Illinois needs enforce lockdown mask mandate.

China handled outbreak well, maybe follow lead. Native El Pasoan here. think it‚Äôs tough people still live acknowledge, ultimately poor unhealthy city. It‚Äôs beautiful wonderful love it, demographic going harder time virus due large number folks preexisting conditions. Poorer communities tend unhealthy. It‚Äôs unfortunate reality. That‚Äôs take given case numbers aren‚Äôt high compared cities US, hospitalizations high, percentage folks hospital put ICU also high. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs would factor. Great. Sea Pdx need extra patients. thought masking keep open capacity hospitals. take care people areas ""can't bothered"" wear masks. EXACTLY! tiny demographic people don‚Äôt wear masks even drop. It‚Äôs 1/10 grain sand yet actually entertaining politicians one, politicize said pandemic. Two, take full control strip freedoms. People think FEDERAL mandate act forced mask wearing, go away pandemic. Nope. acts takeaway strip personal freedoms forever. government good anyone except politicians. can‚Äôt believe people forgotten patriot act all-ready. lost personal privacy within 1 year name fake weapons mass destruction. Politicians slowly destroying country yet people think politicians best interests mind? It‚Äôs plain see politicians politicized pandemic people fell hook line sinker. Fools sides... don‚Äôt get churches fighting hard meet so, wear masks? attended served church 13 years. totally fine watching online. However, church‚Äôs behavior severely disappointed us sent family away.   There's evidence masking shutting bars restaurants helped. But, imo, big shift mobility went back people realized spread control. Nope. dont want live behind cloth rest life. know cancers contagious covid thats mess, yeah general population, person covid bigger risk 1 person cancer Paywall.

Can copy article paste please? Literally thought myself. Lots traffic sub lately month two ago well. Yes. types tend extremely arrogant, believe valuable degree better everyone else. There's huge superiority complex among STEM students grads. arent scraping layer covid cereal box jamming throat, risk covid transmission via groceries. Johns Hopkins said back May also. 
you likely get sick ingesting cleaner bleach wipes.  question u imbecile  seriously feel bad wife. worry elderly vulnerable population. remember (and I‚Äôm still sure it‚Äôs going on), scammers would call loved ones pretending asking money wired them.  That's happens kids ""duty."" Raising kids serious, crushing responsibility take on. *you* want it. family, church, SO, community. Kids great, raising cheap. easy. fun. Surging almost asymptomatic patients. oh yes idiots already complaining freedom asked wear mask imagine they'll forced wear mask reaction be. people get shot this, mark words refering.

NO! Compare counties percent positives. 

Of course cases, like 3 million people. Everyone trouble, city better places high mask compliance compared areas. Good bad sinner. Salem next. Oregon Fairgrounds standby.

The results possible President Clinton would exactly same. results possible President Biden exactly same. [A better map usual, going ""herd immunity"" virus confers lasting immunity. temporary pauses large outbreaks, might eventually come seasonal synchronization, virus going go away.

Having said that, cases India going real mystery needs answer.

Their seroprevalence studies suggest nothing like necessary conditions even temporary decline, certainly nothing like observed elsewhere similar conditions. 

In places Latin America virus spread unimpeded, population ended infected. self test Australia yesterday, painful, felt bit like sneezing. stick tonsil wipe too.  Well, current Polish government problem. See people aren‚Äôt going listen anymore. tired hearing ‚Äúyou stay inside another year!‚Äù live wild west people whatever want lol. Agreed. Working general public awful enough without throwing pandemic mix. Youre gonna ger downvoted youre right Ouch. completely missing point.

The high positivity rate means many infected people tested. think peak day get top -- ¬±150,000? Somewhat limited evidence, evidence suggestive study, showed closing schools alone could decrease transmission 15% (R ratio 0¬∑85, 95% CI 0¬∑66‚Äì1¬∑10) day 28 reopening schools could increase transmission 24% (1¬∑24, 1¬∑00‚Äì1¬∑52) day 28. acknowledged analysis, unable account different precautions regarding school reopening adopted They're still entirety Canada, they're still full lockdown even particularly arduous lockdown imo. point stands - lot countries, including own, full lockdown anywhere near it. 

Sweden may 'consistent', also rank 17th world deaths per million. think they're anything write home wish people would stop acting though are. That's all. Evidence would suggest held back politically.

Tedros accused bowing foreign Superpower announcing World Pandemic back February/March.

Around time, Professor Hong Kong University - expert Epidemiology (so actually knew talking about, World instead broadcast rubbish Doctors instead), telling people wear masks, showing apply work.

I guess political reasons (either internal external) Hong Kong Professor's recommendation National TV ignored broadcast rest world.

If higher risk, take extra precautions, aren't, probably low risk unnecessary. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve interacted people love love back. It‚Äôs quite bizarre circular logic is. awesome virus free night dude.

I'm sure feel good scared paranoid vast vast majority people low risk.

If come contact someone higher risk take extra precautions.

No one else responsible spread anyone else come contact choice stupid. definitely densely populated, would make sense places experiencing larger spread lifting restrictions.

He‚Äôs criticized countries. He‚Äôs said maybe mistakes wouldn‚Äôt change much went back past. still hasn't. Taiwan communist. democracy. Goodbye, Winnie. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre sarcastic. It‚Äôs like trying get regular hospital covid patients. called two children‚Äôs hospitals.. fever 38.5 3 days normally seek medical attention.. luckily she‚Äôs ok morning (so far). Yet likelihood happening astronomically low, likelihood death much much lower. believe mentioned something healthy, chances happening heightened pre-existing conditions, without virus barely risk We're pretty screwed here.
Reaction rising numbers wayyyy slow. country going back lockdown tomorrow, month late.

The curve flatten next week, can't sure right asymptomatic people tested, even close contact someone infected.

Hospitals gonna rough end year. could new Italy situation. Lol. 

How work Melbourne? Pathetic numbers. Belgium (11 mil inhabitants) going strong 15k+ cases daily (although 11k average last 7 days), postivity rate 18,3% much 850 / 100.000! really matter use resources that.

It's like China, resources 1.35 billion people funneled test city 6 million. Im stating planning for, others may may people around behave; control that. sure downvotes statement. too. Australia closed borders still pretty bad second wave act fast enough cases re-emerged. quarantine facilities also serious issues. seems like successful response requires combination strong border measures, reopening community spread taking aggressive measures quickly first sign resurgence. Tegnell said everything great Sweden?

I think might need prove that. Glad live oregon haven‚Äôt made up. He‚Äôs said Also KY. Teacher. still idea schools still going in-person. Another teacher friend contracted covid flu work. One state Australia second wave, rest country remained open there's crowd 40,000 expected tonight's rugby final Sydney. Second one absurdly unlikely. Vegas major city- I‚Äôm talking LA NY, travel hubs. Guest China? Unless Wuhan Hubei province, also unlikely. China large US know. Why? make kind hero reality much. understand time Chinese made hero outsider better critical thinking skills. took warning sent local hospitals lookout new respiratory disease, sent small group friends misinterpreted Sars, also asked everyone group tell anyone (whistleblower?) Unfortunately someone group listen put message much wider platform, maybe person could considered whistleblower.
 
For troubles li Wenliang called local police station made sign document saying again. That's bit stupid move local police, hardly massive nefarious situation made be.

Unfortunately poor man caught disease patient later died. Every death shame reality worse thousands others. Fortunately him, emotional response death classed martyr means thankfully wife kids well looked after. China minons sniff social media content, come mases abuse vote content speaks China, illigally occupied claimed territories. Wow, keeps going.

For impacted, extended timeline? hear friends family nearby? lot people choking breath control... one side supposed example herd immunity works nothing Sweden ever restricted.

And side like news telling everyone it‚Äôs great Sweden herd immunity almost rest world idiots.

I mean disinformation sides, weary Swedes middle going, ""but thats Swedes back Tegnell.

Yes people like make things said make Sweden look like hellscape. endless battle opponents trying make Sweden look like progressive heaven.

Its exhausting. exact reason kids still going participate Halloween. hardcore quarantining since March feel like holidays going safe Halloween probably safest one, going try best able keep normal possible. idea whit universal basic income.   
The top 1% 50% ( ) worlds wealth.    
It fine super wealthy people.   
As long one starving roof head test sick people end low positivity rate, argue virus widespread people getting sick something COVID.

A high positivity rate means ton people sick COVID, virus everywhere probably can't traced, testing inadequate. Well pandemic suck, Vietnam isolated whole world safety citizens . miss drunk Westerners wandering pub streets don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair say anything objective point. Unfortunately know things retrospect. fan Sweden‚Äôs approach particular focus numbers speculative used talking points without acknowledging lack empathy involved. Reports I‚Äôve seen say elderly people risk severe case covid Sweden terribly high rates depression anxiety due approach basically says gov‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt give fuck them. Doesn‚Äôt help get sick they‚Äôre old unhealthy, they‚Äôre told go die home save resources others live prevent healthcare system overloaded. 

Also quite sure you‚Äôre getting IFR argument from. IFR isn‚Äôt known yet often likely varies locality locality. Also, what‚Äôs point low IFR high mortality per capita relative comparable nations vaccines going available soon enough (like 6 months still that‚Äôs incredible) make deaths nothing. Herd immunity inoculation come far natural herd immunity. Honestly think it‚Äôs massive waste time (the prymula thing). need pull heads asses start acting reacting. 

I don‚Äôt think new health minister time good. ones going trust him.. sounds crazy ridiculous hope you‚Äôre right Move population small island thoroughly check incoming traffic? That's genius! Feelsfuckingbadman, imagine interacting idea remove suspected infectious people social circulation.

For medical purposes, one needs certainty establish treatment procedure, PCR test must.

For purposes mitigating spread, antigen test good enough. false positive, worst happen workforce week two (sick allowance paid period). false negative, might spread further, yes.

If implemented well, push R_eff way zero, removing vast majority infectious people pool. Also good keep mind rates false positives false negatives provided manufacturer, err side caution avoid litigation risk - reality antigen tests reliable predictor give credit for.  Well, neither rest world's it‚Äôs going happen.

Trump wants goes half states agreeing lockdown pushed to.

Congress almost certainly isn‚Äôt going pass stimulus goes ability others even consider it.

People burned doesn‚Äôt change anything, mean won‚Äôt get mass support it.

Until / unless things get truly dire, we‚Äôre reality see happen, mention impact would happen couple months would take really reach good spot.

So ya. Right forgot tuesday thats spike. fixed it. 7 days average cases 12K.

So Belgium expect 120 daily average deaths 14 days.

Peak deaths 1st wave 280 (7 days average). probably real peak daily cases first wave got 28.000.

Issue that, 12K seems lot lower 28K, current growing rate Belgium reach 28K (7 days average) 10-14 days. country that? know UK Italy testing much before. Maybe Germany, testing lot since beginning, increased much testing. earth getting downvoted this?! China trolls full force? culture thing true, good previously lived Williamson Co. 20 years knowing affluent red county is, surprise one bit. surprising part also lot educated folks live county know understand masks help minimize spread. fought hard remove oversight. article says first ""airlift"". Holland we've balancing first spike well. Difference ambulance. Since first spike mainly hitting southern part country, hospitals started hit capacity, patients moved northern part across border germany well.  Respectfully disagree. partner Taiwan, would strongly disagree too.

China largely Communist rule, Taiwan fought (successfully) stay Democratic. still different legal system big brother. Yes no.
Australia federation states 5 6 come well, 4 less virus free 5 low case numbers.
It got away us home state state government locked we're tracking well open low case numbers mid November.
Being unitary state helped NZ along outstanding national leadership Australia whole also done pretty well.
If political people follow. need lock contacts social circles faster impact. cut 3 month timeline down. Staying home seeing nobody 2 weeks easier lesser level lockdown 3 months.

The problem people following rules though, HARD lockdown. Japan place export, one flight 18 positives Philippines. 

It exported far many cases stop keeping track. reading one city city wide antibodies test, Taipei government forced city release result. Actually, flattening curve prolongs pandemic (but saves lives) . super spiky curve shortens (but kills people)  Clearly zero relevant educational experience, doubt make much sense waste time trying explain things.

But anyway, I'll still it.

If virus attacking immune system directly preventing formation memory cells -- fact seem doing, multiple papers appeared showing -- vaccine possible live virus things.

But antibodies disappear get screened immune system reason, forget vaccine. Ever. studies pointing direction too. mean ""second""? included Latin America article North America? USA + Mexico well 300k already many places people avoid testing know they'll force quarantined. actually monsoon caused high cases July , aug, sep, monsoon gone away, cases going down. kind effect also seen Europe US/Canada winter causing surge cases. weather human behavior that's causing seasonal effect. people gathering indoors monsoon India similarly winter Europe North America.  children first place can't deal them. can't bring terrible hellspawn reincarnate world, expect somebody else's problem.Deal STD called new life, would syphilis cowards. COWARDS!!!

 
(Spoiler: patience drugs course!!!! Like mix jesus cross regular evening ozzy osbourne's house ) Second wave usually hits place, think spike cases virus reaching new states maybe? Wow. niece's highschool soccer coach told get tested get shutdown. Utah Argentina, Peru, Spain, etc  stupid, selfish people. distroy everything done last months Probably? Airports already that. 

Not really sure possible get infected plane everyone clean getting though. government encouraging us go southern half country still, north going lockdown simply implausible to, places like London still T3 restrictions, town T1 still interview criticizer wants call ""It's over!; experiment failed!"", middle pandemic seemingly disregarding we're currently pretty okay, light restrictions imposed us, enjoyed summer almost spread.

What say experiments lockdown would preferrable, made difference?

(Then journalist regurgitates several fringe cases, misunderstandings mistakes. Beware case already well understood those.) got lucky getting tested immediately suspecting symptoms. New Zealand 5million people well 1 million currently overseas.

Either force behavior build comprehensive strategies acknowledge people‚Äôs resistance restrictions either adopting ask calculate percentage population fully comply time. 

Or, know, keep trying approaches wondering see pushback &amp; noncompliance almost certain worse drags out.

It‚Äôs ideal, all, it‚Äôs like first time facing risks people could collectively reduce relatively moderate actions (smoking, stds, drinking &amp; driving, drinking general, bad eating, speeding, etc) discover everyone willing so, leading us decide far want go rules &amp; education control modify behavior. strapping my¬†job¬†helmet squeezing down¬†into¬†a¬†job¬†cannon firing¬†off job land, course stupidity global phenomenon Good him. I‚Äôm wondering too. reason virus barely dented Africa, Pakistan , Bangladesh. Lower age stronger immune systems (potentially weather plays factor too) hotter weather means spend lot time outdoors).

From first hand information assure absolutely social distancing India (its feasible country 1 billion people). antibody studies seroprevalance high Indian cities. Initially overload hospital systems gone well.

This scene last week major cloth shop major India city(before went viral closed rural areas assume way enforce even this.

Age seems main factor virus.

Africa (median age 19) Pakistan (median age 22.8) India (median age 26). death rates proportional reflect fact.

The one thing im curious Latin America high death toll despite lower ages? Leads believe Immune systems much hardened South Asia Africa. don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre allowed leave, we‚Äôre plague rats don‚Äôt call North DaCovid nothing average, percent American Coronavirus PPE funds either went straight stock market completely unrelated fields via slush funds? good course forget Li Wenliang, strangest case considered whistle blower really wasn't. tragedy commons issue. Kind like fishery. However instead fish social connections. everyone abuses commons everybody loses. managed enforced well, people abuse take commons fair people trying good lose out. happens test positive arrival? add quarantine ward airport? still vote them. US, uk too. France, mix priority economic recovery (large resistance telecomuting among French managers bosses, alleviated health protocol schools close less schools, promotion holidays) failures test-trace-isolate system. (testing support rise cases, tracing failed Stop COVID downloaded population, isolating respected even lowered one week).

And so, test-trace-isolate system failed, government's rhetoric went full ""people's responsibilities"" (and especially young festive people) following BoJo stick (late regional curfews, Tier 3 model, Rule Six). think we'll soon lockdown. wore KN95 masks though. officials say want repurpose $16 million federal coronavirus aid spend grants encourage fracking instead using clean abandoned oil well sites.

Wait... covid funds originally intended oil wells? It‚Äôs okay Gardellseke it‚Äôs allergies try cough class missunderstand. pill look identical. shoot feel getting it.

The reason Swedish interest Swedes allowed case get hijacked right wing supposed example herd immunity works nothing Sweden ever restricted. Totally bullshit that‚Äôs going on. Tegnell like news telling everyone it‚Äôs great Sweden herd immunity almost rest world idiots. Swedes back Tegnell. thus contrast food fight everyday. fault ! first time disagree Fauci, merely point he's saying now.

It's wearing them, people actively saying shouldn't, wearing correctly, people selling non functional masks (and meant bullshit ""hur hur look mask"", mean literally masks shit), people wearing non functional masks friends kid exposed class shut 2 weeks. didn‚Äôt get tested either, kid quarantine EVEN tests came back negative... child abuse, plain simple. According r/Coronavirus: Yes. lose employment (or hours) permanently get 2k. nothing getting sick week two. fair, that's plants crave everyone confirmed negative boarding. Faced this, governments nervous imposing full-scale lockdowns, favoring instead array smaller measures hope stem spread.

And time see half-measures, though slow rise little while, ultimately useless goal keep numbers minimum. No, understand. There's like 50 confirmed reinfections. Antibodies useless might well throw away keys houses we're never going outside again. 


Snark aside, good (and really unexpected) news. important remember always going outliers produce antibodies expected also people get reinfected despite antibodies, like every disease world.  Yeah dogs pretty horrible comes dexterity. Uh, much I‚Äôd like rip OC, better statewide average. 4.6 cases per day / 100k 3.2% positivity rate vs overall 7.0 cases per day 3.3% positivity rate.

Certainly best even close still. think hypothesis point higher nose provides better place virus replicate hang it‚Äôs dry, it‚Äôs closer lungs, olfactory cells higher expression surface antigens virus recognizes potential replication host. reason loss taste/smell one first symptoms people notice 

That means you‚Äôll get higher concentration virus clinging onto collection swab could potentially catch infection earlier viral titers still low.

As even allow specimens collected nasally results less accurate I‚Äôm honestly sure. Maybe it‚Äôs logistical phlebotomists collect nasal swabs NP according hospitals policy Nobody likes told do, American trait. Taiwan exported cases Japan. No. Half people Stockholm live alone. Half *households* single.
If fuck simple task reading statistics, surprise also can't properly understand covid stats either. california good luck mild winters decreases indoor time keeps humidity, smarter/more compliant populace.

Still get hit hard inevitably, can't even imagine like midwest middle winter. Eventually people come terms reality really would like hear molecular details scenarios immune system would start working way unknown us before. 

Please enlighten me. already forget Li Wenliang? Shame you. matter everyone tests negative step negative stop off. Good you, hermit. say covid airborne disease. one *every* sense word.  Well, guess lines shorter ... that's nice. People able visit loved ones, conduct business, see world breakthrough testing capabilities? 

Yeah sounds like good news me. getting tested COVID done every point need show passport airlines open safely again. tightrope walk us Kiwis now. smash like new incoming cluster FAST get back zero without lockdowns contact tracing top notch.

On average probably get border leak sort every 30-60 days, especially since northern hemisphere going pretty stink Covid winter returning people flights ships infected.

If slow catch them, end go back lockdown get back zero. **need** keep using covid tracker app even zero, new one pops up, get affected isolation really fast.

That's gotta get vaccine, I'm hoping get nice clear christmas &amp; jan cos could decent summer holiday. get long keep using app, Kiwis.

Kia Kaha, mahi get treats.  Exactly!! Telling us Covid every day annoying really helpful news.  Population density low areas people actually live.
So gigantic forests hardly people. currently work contact tracer confirm. I‚Äôd say 15% less cases actually provide us known contacts w/in infectious period. Honestly, I‚Äôd actually reduce 10% less. county also large undocumented community unfortunately w/ rhetoric surrounding immigration ICE, many (understandably) reluctant provide information government agency (public health not). USA needs deal reckless ideologues place special interests public interest. pay picture. feel comfortable small settings people know, even without drink hand.

Obviously covid doesn‚Äôt care it‚Äôs stranger friend that‚Äôs many people react. Much like people don‚Äôt feel masks home necessary even though clearly people always entire household jointly exposed ways.  Lapsed taking precautions. Compared neighbouring countries maybe? Stfu Indeed. low data can't open site would mistaken thinking travel aviation industry news? exact groups would imagine pressuring Trump, Boris etc rush back ""business usual even bigger body count"".

Even industry site would swear what's happening, here... Daughter couple times recently.

Good space. Good mask wearing, felt safe. Nobody does, country's information network watertight frog's asshole. Nothing gets approved Winnie himself. really ""good news""? Ok. Think virus like invasive species. happens cargo ship afar carries infestation parasitic species series destinations never seen local natural predators? stop seeds places overall spread (and population) invasive species becomes greater new destination.

This virus invasive species. half assed effort contain everywhere. what? care think. want keep locked forever that's prerogative. live know anything daily life went restaurants legally open. 

You sound like anti-choice people decide since abortion one else able make choice one not. Yea see understand. predicted wrongly. let's ignore whole thing even exists. Done. Covid solved. Got. Seems somewhere advice restrictions. Thanks depends molecular details

There scenarios natural immunity short-lived vaccines work

But basic sane rational risk management strategy, assumption vaccines ever. 

And viable strategy ever elimination. Coincidentally, Chinese, intensely studying SARS-type coronaviruses many years, adopted exactly strategy. ever occurred ask is? Apparently not. 

And, course, directly follows anyone advocating ""herd immunity"" executed crimes humanity, advocating unnecessary deaths untold millions. 

In US means president, administration, leadership parties, governors, pretty much corporate elite, bunch sellout academics, etc. 

And hyperbole, dead serious. said done death toll likely eclipse WWII, entirely avoidable preventable, reason allowed happen corporate profits preserved costs (and death suffering many people fact cost it‚Äôs true.

Tell Iranians, early start pandemic, deal massive number reinfections months now, many severe cases.

And reinfections showing significant numbers Brazil, even US. hearing lot coming months. Empty beach town sounds like good place ride apocalypse. We‚Äôre walled medieval hilltop town, we‚Äôre set zombies come. 

Do know get spray bleach Italy? can‚Äôt find stores (Coop) Amazon.it, ordered Amazon UK. mean, Italians must use bleach, right? Except can‚Äôt lock years. Even said this. dumpster fire still burning. Thank you, first time I‚Äôve heard explained, makes much sense explanations I‚Äôve heard. take longer get vaccine rural areas. don‚Äôt even HPV vaccine anywhere near rural area live in. Reminds health minister Tunisia positivity rate 37% every day saying everything control. We've imposed curfews closed cafes, bars restaurants 3 weeks done nothing slow spread keeps refusing option nationwide lockdown even there's 30+ deaths day that's lot small nation 11 mil population. End now. Let know say you. probably boils money. Maybe NHS loads kits lying around. Obviously got mine free staff. pay yours? actually do? see staff carried (they paper work, swabbed myself) I'll ask well.

Best luck way. hate say it, it‚Äôs karma. Like Sims! US dealing big crisis like getting stuck deciding whether wearing mask important not, still caring human rights China. Man, tears every time. It‚Äôs okay virus knows you‚Äôre tired won‚Äôt bother you. Ffs. merit. Goes ways. Right now, sweeden used pro-lockdowners anti-lockdowners tool agenda Barring deus ex machina, i.e. effective vaccine widespread usage, everyone magically wearing mask staying home, 1,000,000 9 months good prediction any. I‚Äôm Louisiana. fucking ridiculous. Especially complaining masks. 

When school, daily uniform check. stand twirl. make sure school uniform 100% code. also raise pant legs show socks. make sure white. small emblem socks. suspended school week. started period blood pants. tied jacket around waist wouldn‚Äôt show. FEMALE principal threaten give detention didn‚Äôt take off. 

Louisiana one authoritative states country. tired people acting like headache wear mask. went kindergarten-12th grade dealing bullshit uniform rules. ignorant people wear mask another year. excuses ‚Äúincreased testing.‚Äù Weren‚Äôt people making fun saying reason US increase ‚Äúincrease testing?‚Äù Obviously draw line somewhere households number thing feels... strange.

3 households 4-6 people, 2 work least shop / go out, 2-4 occasionally, perhaps even school, 12-16 different potential exposure points.

5 households 1-2 people (1:4 California households solo half couples, young old alike) distinct clusters still far less people. 

Many states countries gone group size California always approach rarely explains logic behind (personal gatherings prohibited completely march update). Really? Hawaii going huh...compare us states comparable populations density see killing it...that happens good leadership Fuck police Sweden little better Quebec, disaster, nothing proud of. lmfao comment absurd general trust officials press. can't imagine getting plane right now. I'd rather drive across country days spend hours close proximity bunch people pressurized cabin. Well, famous philosopher said, hard make predictions, especially future. shoot stab fucks. Greedy ass parasites taking advantage people economic crisis pandemic. r/gmk6-4 told COVID lasti g immunity!!! mistake made, capitalists love crises makes richer makes assets want buy cheaper. Yeah, pretty aware got crazy places. One guy branch went BYU undergrad got PhD northeast professor, would always caution teenagers BYU ""oppressive hellhole"" wanted learn think live Utah least go U U instead. Take care, please!  RemindMe! One month know theres 57 counties California, right? really think asshats OC going skew states average much?? That's good. guess I'd say SARS-CoV-2 become endemic seasonal virus we'll vaccinate similar influenza. Perhaps eventually become another common cold coronavirus. Oceana showing world handle this. never this. Well, unfortunately, makes part problem, since support politician openly opposed measures, openly undermined state local government attempts implement measures. 

If support Joe Biden, vote Joe Biden. Vote third party candidate. voting Trump he's demonstrated agenda is, endorsing agenda. idea. Haven‚Äôt there. Yes agree unlikely Biden team doubt careful. shared experience, us still careful possibly still contract virus.  necessarily reflection whatsoever level care. case, medical professionals would getting it. one's tricky virus, sincerely hope Biden (and eveyone else matter) stay safe. USA population 220 million dumb? probably already, tested cases.  2 days row 80k+ cases. Even Saturday... Nope least would wear masks butts. democrat thing say. ppl dying, hospitals getting overcrowded. economy wide shutdown doesnt make much sense, targeted sector shutdowns help businesses affected (real help). Also Bozo tweeting virus isnt real republicans blocking aid would start. Oh yeah Ewing guy lol. professor, sure. professor anything remotely relevant covid/pandemic/epidemiology? Nope. cases go peaks people staying home something else slowing spread virus? world fucked up. Feel like whole thread filled dummies haha. often definition totalitarian üéµ God bless USA üéµ Spanish, French, mother English.  Purely anecdotal here, moderate persistent asthma, normal cold flu flare asthma lasting even weeks beyond infection. would also love see data it, best interest assume would similar severe experience covid normal respiratory infection. mandate wearing masks work easily collective Asian countries, right freedom individual sacrificed better society whole emergency times like this. Europe USA people value individual right freedom, forget it. is. 

I don‚Äôt think anything us Americans see vaccine drug next year.

Whether mandate not, won‚Äôt change anything, any. Right now, even getting mask country never difficult. go eBay, masks either low quality nothing hugely overpriced. ‚ÄúNice! virus kicking people dying! get couple hundred reddit karma points, could easily get posting cat pictures, posting link today‚Äôs death numbers.‚Äù 

-All us, apparently Sweden managed tarnish good name internationally. Huh? saying Trump's fault people created bad studies attempt prove wrong? Update. Make least 5 like good idea continue campaign schedule, though. normal cool. FFS, Mormon moms.. Even AZ there‚Äôs whole group Mormon moms this! find mental healthcare argument complete bullshit.

Our government Australia increased number subsidies psychology sessions people get 10 20. actual help alleviate problem. able see psychologist every week rest year, bi-weekly next year done wonders long term underlying issues.

letting deadly virus run country ridiculous mental healthcare policy imaginable. I'm kind glad say anything two days ago tempted post knew ahead time. decided posting Tuesday declare global emergency I've still mixed feelings can't easily identified point I'll let know /pol/ way worse told. I'll preface saying work finance friends family medical industry field, including CDC one close friend starters Ro (pronounced R naught) actually around 6, 3. Secondly slightly lethal current form, China covering LOT deaths passing heart attacks, pneumonia, kidney failure, sorts official causes hide real numbers. CDC highly aware this. also hear phrase ""confirmed cases."" presently thought epidemiologists China surpassed 120,000 cases Tuesday lowest; also possible hit 100k week ago. know sure China definitely minimum 120,000 infections high profile investors who've silently pulling ahead time. Travel tourism, hospitality service industries, immediate obvious. Manufacturing go wild ride. ""safe"" industries invest right biomedical fields plastics oddly enough. Virtually industries going massively hit anybody know trying quietly possible SHTF partly avoid insider trading allegations importantly start also CDC hiding it. far concerned, matter bad disease is, panic always going worse. also lot economists downplaying outright lying you.
in next year two. optimistic prediction point 60,000 people going get killed next months. highly infectious R6, probable chance mutations, infectious prodromal phase, airborne. reason already seeing thousands people confirmed outside China yet incubation period believe already talking ""problematic"" modeling Chinese response Western countries going be, first country want try Italy. begins large outbreak major Italian city want work Italian authorities world health organizations begin locking Italian cities vain attempt slow spread least develop distribute vaccines, btw need start bad scary case scenario fail contain also mutates South America. going far, far worse Spanish flu happens going completely crash global economy. concerned world health authorities ""only"" 20.6-7% probable happening however far they're concerned they're taking one step time start panic, estimated one five chance hundred million people dying next year. Redfield aware along top American CDC staff triaging situation situation according logic. Ask Kyle got chance. European health authorities seem fully debriefed yet far I'm aware numbers mostly originated along models. dubious article posted again. rule multiple posts article? Anyway... article says studies supporting premise, name link them. Many flaws, support ""man bites dog"" theme. I'm wondering low quality piece got Times.

Of course must coincidence covid rates went vertical immediately back school. Nothing see here... move along... move along.... assume everybody catch it. meant early locked relatively cases compared countries. virus got later 14 quarantine requirement also apply others help Australia avoiding second wave.

True that's Australia's quarantine facilities serious issues (e.g. contract workers [didn't know [weren't given proper PPE even properly second wave started quarantine facility managed properly.

Also, Australia waited second wave got really bad went back lockdown. NZ acted immediately (the country literally went back lockdown less 24 hours first community case), got control quickly. course. don‚Äôt save hardship crush economy via lockdowns first place. Originally small town Oregon - yes, Portland overwhelming you‚Äôre used you‚Äôve got sick family member big hospital you‚Äôre trying find place stay, store buy clothes toiletries left without anything loved one got transferred, food. done that. Sadly young people die different illnesses accidents everyday. Canada fine. Here's source research article European Journal Immunology anyone wants read Hopefully lease ends soon find new roommates places offer free tests public often inaccessible, especially without car. Insurance might cover part, certain inaccessible places one covered required negative flu test getting C19 test..which tests weren‚Äôt covered. sizable portion population US believe virus real threat.

The thing understand:  donny got sick covid, quoted saying dangerous...but lot followers STILL think hoax? wtf?! maybe remember clearly? :-/ Seems like first wave ebbed April 2nd peaked July.  Probably would cause whole lotta problems. Chuckle-Heads going disobey, mock ones following rules. get results within hours tests. Next time go I'm going ask specifics they're using particular method. saw headline thought r/politics second Getting quarter cow winter always good play, tho. Hopefully still loses election anyway. well depends things implemented, doesnt buddy? It‚Äôs almost wearing mask, somehow helps pro herd immunity narrative go away. Feels like first wave hung around going tag-team us second wave. Username checks  TBH think way economically sound, hard fast beggining hit general economy, (tourism aside that's bit special case). open quicker back action. Far better partial lockdown constant big mess. high Street hit far Europe USA. car, free. Cant exactly Uber testing site. Unprovable instances covid infections safety.

I bet touch face adjust mask multiple times per day. broken integrity mask.

The whole thing joke. basic rights one protect disease infection. family + inlaw families. 

Doesnt cover siblings join guess thay idea. primary point contraction home

Yes, people Germany *it is*. gotta pick job magical job tree 

/s Actually deaths per million Sweden still ranks low, covid deaths per million specifically yes. saying they'll covid deaths early others going catch up. gone 8th 17th still falling. see happens. Shit, guess I'm weirdo checking worldometers least daily, every damn day, since March/whenever discovered it. Tbf used check many many times day early heat things, twice afternoon/evening see day went. stopped reading articles/reports quite ago, find looking website minute two day gives great grasp data's continuing progression. Trump wrent't behind

Yes were

These studies happening trump claimed cure word stage citing quack doctors

Enough ""both sides"" manufactured neutrality wear mask everyday bathroom work take off, idk someone would unless throw suppose. have. live here. you?  closing borders racist. least that‚Äôs told January 2020. island major transport hub several cities located quite far away one another. much easier implement travel restrictions, internal external, allows contain outbreak bring cases virtual elimination. 

I dismissing results. saying something scale could done Europe America, everything much harder isolate. you? making stereotype generalizations Yeah buddy fucking sides. Great post. Truly excellent post. fine nothing them. salary cap $200 million year. NFL trying look like something. Titan's organization take (small) hit outbreak fine. yet see Gen Z person mask nose like idiot. seem take chances see people age older (40s.) went bowling alley yesterday, single person wearing mask giving wife strange looks wearing them.

This problem.

We felt pressured take off, instead, left. know closing bar restaurants early, altogether, solves problem. sarcastic, obviously clear Moving south know France bunch Trumps types headlines sensationalist meant alarm (also meant push ‚ÄúAmerica bad!‚Äù narrative edgy Redditors). 

Record numbers expected it‚Äôs good many people getting tested. Thankfully, medical experts understand treat Covid patients nowadays much better back March/April. 

I expect mortality rates continue getting better. would nice Reddit would give updates progress vaccine also many people recovering virus. Headlines ‚ÄúRecord number cases!!‚Äù makes people think people going pass away. That‚Äôs case it‚Äôs quite annoying see headline every single day. Best antivaxx propaganda obstinate austerity bickering Antibody study showed NYC 20% infected first wave. summer, 1 zero deaths Sunday normal. good. Ok fascist. mean sound like uncaring asshole: get it. I'm adjunct Big 10 research university teaching MBAs. absolutely maddening. class translated beautifully Zoom, slog adapt, sides (prep staying engaged learning). dorm situations sometimes comically irrational, far optimal sad. Trump GOP cruel assholes, school admin rock hard place, students ones getting fucked. absurd, best, exhausting.

FWIW, schools know, faculty definitely knows, we're thinking y'all every step. Unfortunately, there's way around it. Make sure tapping support networks cope, including profs (we get it).

Hang there.  sarcastic, bay area sf particular models anyone US Culture will. Something sharps people hundreds years gonna get away ""intention"". Yeah... French South Koreans... Breaking news.

It takes hundreds years change culture norm. Much modern world changed better worse Cold War Cold War Verily Republicans Leaders: ""Cant go vote peak Rona cases time election"" drug companies sell vaccine highest bidders. Yah, 15k week 1918-level deaths. That‚Äôll brutal, it‚Äôll inevitable result second term current admin, possible outcome Biden admin people defiantly don‚Äôt take precautions. Well, Utah twice population two Dakotas combined. /r/bayarea checking It‚Äôs partying family gatherings. forgot Boston globe article 2/3 attributed that. there‚Äôs around 100 cases students less 100 cases staff public school system. course, that‚Äôs counting colleges, several well publicized cases kind got quiet. ... accusing strawmanning went straight ""well *federal* government can't mandate it""?

No one cares *who* mandates it, required. every state union allowed walk around naked. every state union allowed walk around without mask. Whichever level government needs make reality point conversation. dont know, epidemiologist, idea big spread low want get numbers. bet three weeks least. Yay as? 700 new cases day back winter. saying community transmission exist Australia? don‚Äôt think US government cares common citizen either, oppose American government Chinese government. That's entire US. Europeans laughing US now? cases coronavirus mean proportionally higher amount people getting tested. many people flu like symptoms long everyone symptoms gets tested positive rate imply anything true number cases. That's Norway *well*. definition badly people dying due lack ventilators healthcare generally overburdened, mass panic among people, economy collapsing. I'm talking UBI makes work necessary. lot people choose quit jobs. Also divorce rates steading decreasing peak 80's, pandemic happened. Fuckin worked. Hats off. think months worth it. ""affects"", verb, ""effects"" noun. Mueller chose draw line, Congress chose draw line. failed us, People draw line ballot box. There‚Äôs something wrong country thinks kidnapping children way justified. 

No, don‚Äôt always make statements cannot proven... lived country basic level competency, we‚Äôd able trace virus start. lol Um definition *every* pandemic 'syndemic' - health outcomes depend social conditions, hardly news. Furthermore, need novel coronavirus show us inequalities societies. mass surveillance internment camps totally code ‚Äúwe care you‚Äù.

The topic China, United States. basically vaccine inject body weakened version coronavirus. body easily beat results getting coronavirus antibodies . ever catch real coronavirus line body already trained deal virus. Haha! we're getting somewhere.

Wondering many people dying ""obsessed dying covid"".

Why post many people dying average age is?

Surely reason we've shut economy? 

You really can't understand really really dishonest?

Sadly suspect both. importantly, kind! losing taste gradually feel like?

Edit: taste sorta started feeling held listerine long mouth. I‚Äôm tasting anything, kinda feels tasteless. So, COVID nah? really, I‚Äôm talking politics media. I‚Äôm giving reasons effective tactics used China low covid countries wouldn‚Äôt work U.S. yes deaths increasing. 70 per day avg Oct 1 170 avg per day now. People don‚Äôt listen government, state federal. see nearly every state. veterans corporate executives children, many people don‚Äôt think matters ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt happen me!‚Äù. Yet cases time high people can‚Äôt follow guidance already there. people can‚Äôt tolerate curbing selfish desires long. Still enough data tbh. admit first thing crossed mind outbreak one concentration camps. 

Then propaganda done job. **Everybody knows China virus Democratic hoax. one ever deal Democratic hoaxes like me, I‚Äôm best dealing them. Ask anyone...Putin, Kim Jong Un, Fauci...everyone knows one knows better hoaxes like me**  Best safest blanket statement make, even remotely reasonably. Kids falling behind, progressing growing socially, kids stuck abusive households ""safe."" possibly reasonably think distant learning best safe. Look statistics, kids spread less multiple studies shown, flu deadlier kids statistics show. Remote learning absolute joke, safe ways open (which already happening continue happen). think kids remote learn years virus continues linger parents struggle balance work helping kids learn go work figure watch kids. Remote learning furthest thing best safest. ‚ÄúIt affects virtually nobody‚Äù There's actually several articles following 2nd infection groups popping up.  Meanwhile Belgium... fair walmart  side hauling social media CEO's front congress week call elimination 230 protections. Dear Leader signed executive order calling rewriting it. There's good option here. Cases gone eveywhere world schools started. pretty clear. contact someone who's positive, get call pretty sure mandatory tested within 7 days. Hopefully trials continue safe positive manner viable vaccine near future.

Until then: wear mask. weather getting cooler, ‚Äúit‚Äôs hot‚Äù excuse anymore. safe, smart. Yup. That's I'm expecting big fireworks 14 days later ICUs start filling records breaking. think.

I think relevant compare countries see done differently. also think wrong compare Sweden Scandinavian countries. wrong think ""the same"". Sweden could learn much countries. 

Measures strategy also thing counts. was, different regions Sweden wouldnt totally different results. strategy all. 

I dont think Sweden would exact result norway same. think Sweden acted like beginning, maybe full lockdown aggressive. 

Finally feel misunderstanding Sweden neighbors totally different things. Swedens volontary lockdown Norways lockdown much similar Norways lockdown Spanish extremely strict ""housearrest"" type lockdown example. Well done. Please post Vietnam updates. People pretty salty good news NZ think it‚Äôs bc good news isn‚Äôt posted enough. absolutely contain it. plant -- distort distract party. first thought living middle nowhere, high Karmas acquired short time says pro political agenda.  Go argue someone else. better yet, find New York businessman agrees you. bunch ministrains covid-19, reinfection/sister strain infection well documented. Yeah likely. shit. I‚Äôm sick everybody forgetting willfully ignoring fuck happens healthcare system overrun. Jesus Christ. Get head asses. affects rest world too. Thanks lot America going ugly sure. That's money moved safer positions. stock market high anyway considering virus mess exploding right now. matter ""being wrong"" tried trying everything can, unlike country. French right-wing media giving free air time lot crooks. 
Remember hydroxychloroquine ? came France, Didier Raoult, Marseille doctor buddy traditional right-wing party. 

It's surprising, politics, economics, philosophy law. last months, many crooks said second wave impossible try undermine health policies sister works court Houston, one judges said virus hoax, law degree equal smart. LOL kalsarik√§nnit (drinking alone home underwear) 
 
TIL Finnish that‚Äôs like US 250k cases day.... Exactly. soon sit restaurant/bar office remove mask ineffective. obsessed dying covid? Deaths one part picture. already demonstrated, hospital capacity pushed limits, irrespective demographic people dying disease. Yeah would bad look Europe showed consistent decline.

But recent resurgence I'm sitting thinking wtf point manage.. Like leaders Spain, France, Italy, Belgium worse Trump Republicans people's measures? Lmao europe malding exploding worse US. plan visitors holidays? We're Florida sister bugging right now, trying come visit us town holidays mom risk really want take chance contribute spread happens come us infected taking super personally trying best come home I've praying miracle news, day day. Taking one day time. Ahh, yes. Chin diapers. hope eventually Americans adults wear damn masks little bit. real weakness allowing community spread wearing mask infringes fabricated 'rights'.  wont say exact name UC california. California one states u see none anti-maskers information discovered team researchers offered solutions magic MLM. AMWAY first edge marketplace, bet bottom dollar every flat earther America would telling truth Covid magic oil ward Covid, they‚Äôd selling masks monthly subscription right, don't. I'm sorry do! truly wish upon anyone. information suggest COVID could actually _cause_ asthma? far I'm aware we've never sure causes asthma all. know things trigger asthma _attacks_ causes people get first place?

Regarding children's potential disease vector. example page referenced, chart shows age distribution source patient. total number infected contacts, 0.3% (n=14) source patient age 4, 0.7% (n=36) source patient aged 4-11 years, 4.6% source patient aged 12-17 years. vast majority contacts became infected (94.4%), source patient 18 years older.

Going numbers, chances they'll bring home seem high. admit I'm really scared getting it. I'm relatively young healthy (and yes, know cases young healthy people biting bullet). I'm total idiot. social distance, wash hands often, wear masks going go groceries pretty much. 0.7% chance catching kids, I'll take risk, especially means lives semblance normal. That's decide. Maybe. areas starting get hit, downside hospitals aren‚Äôt prepared handle this. mean they're Conservative using money ""HOAX"" things like destabilizing lands get bit Oil money. making excuses lack leadership Federal level. Republican strategy determined Covid distraction desired agenda. despite tens thousands deaths double non issue strategy want viris non issue elections.

This requires conservative media throw static smokescreens confuse issues bring reasons trust science. includes sorts bullshit reasons wear masks.

Conservatives attempting hold onto power pile sick dying American citizens. Exactly. people keep acting like well need another week two count ballots... really many people sitting theirs? sent mine mail day go (almost 2 weeks ago) Jesus Christ, kill tired myth yet?

I extensive Chinese contacts. China. ÊàëÂèØ‰ª•ËØ¥‰∏ÄÁÇπÁÇπ‰∏≠Êñá. long term GF China father doctor.

China pretty much back normal since April. pretty par course east Asian mask wearing cultures. Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, etc similar numbers virus - practically non-existent. article linked mostly discussing triage/guideline document explains biological age means, DN format articles main one. yeah heard that. thing testing find testing feel like reading comprehension needs work. Oh coronavirus makes makes men infertile, well get cure two weeks affecting men affecting women minds. Damn dude winter? Yeah imma say that's dog. death rate young people extremely low, similar seasonal flu. italian here, never thought i'd say whole ""fuck everyone, live live die die"" mentality creeping head move foerward new stricter stricer restrictions.

the individualism spreading, look Naples Rome asre moment.

we're tired.  Actually 260,000 US equivalent cases--crazy Right, listing case total. stop reporting altogether. actually need many lab tests. pool together samples multiple people (for example 10). negative know 10 people negative. positive individual test them. Oxford volunteer died complications covid - placebo vaccination. areas yes see areas no. state state mandate decision unless made federal law much else done. mention Xinjiang far distant corner country, away major population centers bad USA country hide amount bodies. Exactly, antivax movement really big social media makes seem. problem corrupt drug companies. Even prior Trump large problem maybe english sucks understanding saying, ""survival species""? worldometers.info linked Useful Resources, data right 66.5mil people earth since January. 34mil abortions year. 7.82billion people. 1990 5.32billion. 846mil undernourished people, 1.7bil overweight people, 26k died hunger today. mean apparently China attributed number imported coronavirus cases chinese nationals illegally return country undetected via land borders. Huh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never voted won‚Äôt vote time.‚Äù 

Good her. She‚Äôs really showing us.  First all, economy going survive regardless. economy die live, exists. agree completely high mask compliance would likely improve overall economic outcomes measured GDP, I'm going use sensationalist language like ""the economy would likely survive"" implying apocalyptic scenario modern economy collapses. 

My point weaving tale evidenced-based. evidence masks help reduce spread (as well secondary benefits reduced viral load potentially reducing IFR reducing infection intensity). issue baseline point understand whether - - sufficient saying do. long Oh wow that‚Äôs almost exactly mind. Thanks! matter testing people. New rare achievement unlocked? [Yeah no](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/10/22/thanksgiving-2020-coronavirus-rethink-how-we-celebrate). I'm ""rethinking"" celebrate Thanksgiving. year might look little different people, ends *this* year. No, positive rate 20% March high testing severely ill people suspected it. government wanted people reproduce, they'd hand UBI.

1. Less need work, time kids

2. kids = UBI checks turning nightmare. Seems like every day another county area goes level 3. People complete idiots it. understand fatigue keep going sake others, can't people recognize that? article good job pointing costs restricting economic behaviour name public health (and great job *whining* them). offers nothing substance options. also makes patently false claims.

Basically - wah wah pandemic can't want no-one listening economists. brick wall... I‚Äôm sorry loss. :( exactly right, comment one sound nice there's truth all. course, everyone french kissing there. wonder spreads fast. condescending, quite get friends ones benefit human contact can't go back was. unless want everyone's children choking dust used river. WTF
  WTF
    WTF pandemic never fucking end. Could bad thing good thing? (Seriously asking) like could less deadly contagious? agree you. feel long viable theory virus arose China got humans via something like wet market, crowing China well they're dealing epidemic tone-deaf say least. Okay, real though, people kissing strangers fun something. Thats big ass number relative population. makes feel better, not, think would make big impact infection risk, based current evidence. One possible exception frozen fish meats, 1) know virus stay active frozen temperature months, whereas decay exponential speed room temperature 2) know frequent outbreaks meat fish processing plants 3) nations like New Zealand China reported local clusters may linked frozen foods, 5 6 clusters far starting become pattern. that's that's money too. paid taxes president did! mandates enforced? remind anyone else renaissance portrayal reported gatherings come one day Pennsylvania recorded 2,219 new coronavirus cases, record single-day high commonwealth. Centre County reported 89 new cases Saturday. People downvote. Poor herd following narrative bars restaurants.

Keeping schools opened mandatory masks pandemic CRIMINAL.  really hope France recovers this. wasn‚Äôt expecting get hit hard. Everyone knows doing... it‚Äôs clever. count flattening curve flatten 100k per day stupid. Spanish government opened borders European tourists restrictions July IIRC. 2nd wave took back horrors spring. expect? Yes, tourism makes 12% economy, controlled reopening. measures place make sure tourists importing virus back there's contaxt-tracing containment measures. I'm watching poxy fucking video. know difference coronavirus *novel* coronavirus.

Again. substantiate claim made. stop wasting time. Thats equivalent 200k USA good lord Pssst, never left first wave... China lies stats.

Easy press government controlled. people going visit families, law forbidding not.

This shit gone way long majority people care anymore.  fly Spirit. made abundantly clear 'corruption, dishonest, cruelty' specifically reference beginning epidemic question *how exactly disease thought wild bat populations ended becoming something could infect humans.* Oh it‚Äôs okay appreciate trying respond someone wrote think could survive isolation friends winter. given first autoimmune dx age 10. 21 years old, already mom, dx second. ill physicians told expect alive son reached adulthood. Since given three autoimmune diagnoses. son 50.

I giving need isolated while. think make winter! Please, 

Don't give up. ever give up. downvote much like.
The italian law says seated take masks.

Schools main reason people dying.

Enjoy second wave. Well looks like today good day ‚òπÔ∏è know adam eve kicked eden snake Satan tempted wearing masks!?!?  Excellent points.
 good egg.  that's case, 3627th wave. worst hit state 7 new COVID cases yesterday (community transmission) still hardcore lockdown.

My state lockdown months community transmission since maybe May, new cases people returning home need go immediate 2 week hotel lockdown forgot ""go work, meet anyone else go anywhere grey office""  held buying N95 masks first 3-4 months pandemic respect healthcare professionals needed assumption supply would eventually ramp (which extent has, help least government). 

I buy - $10+ pop - point enable safety. Especially someone elderly family can't ignore 18 months. asking/ expecting impossible. everyone wore masks would definitely stop virus tracks, probably see hospitals overrun economy would likely survive. middle ground best hope for. vice.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

God forbid close businesses save lives. New strain incoming 3... It‚Äôs quite simple Chinese population America 5 times Korea means many Chinese travel United States Korea. virus origins China much easier spread US due travel also jesus. mental gymnastics.

fuck me, irony!  Blah. Blah. Blah. type lot, yet really say nothing.

Mortality rate problem Covid. NEVER WAS.

The issue is, continue contagiousness, need hospitalization significant portion infected. 

The selfishness describe exacerbates problem. creates problems like seen NY, Texas, Kansas City hospitals get overrun.

I take precautions myself. take precautions others. want go eat? Yes. I? No. significant risk transmission, means could transmit infection girlfriend, brother mother, would likely serious. actually disease, likelihood catching extremely low. Yet, know possibility. take precautions.

But raised properly look others put myself. Agreed, even though 32yo rather little nothing spending however many years left watch struggling. Aside covid19 itself, idea hospitals starting overwhelmed make want take potential risk normally care (taking car get accident whether fault not, go hike get torn ankle broken arm fall, even getting regular winter disease like strep etc.. ) No. wont make difference. look frustrations. outright told cant work let businesses die.

 One cousins disabled husband work,alwaysy saying:""A woman's work neverr sone.""
 enjoy says this. Australian - absolutely given fighting virus.

Less 1000 deaths 25.5 million people. extreme lockdown conditions world.

Together NZ still fighting COVID-19 free Islands using every resource disposal it. anybody find true public release government website suggesting things? get Google click-bait articles. one big tsunami. build massive dome around america Im pretty certain stay alive. Yes, fundamental problem obstinate ignorance global ""mono"" culture. scientific report tread making sweeping statements limited milieu, rather short sighted perspective. we‚Äôre 100K new cases per day Thanksgiving, January it‚Äôs going look like zombie apocalypse. Time stock back ramen toilet paper... Kashgar de facto closed yesterday.

There's lot information weibo, flights cancelled, railways cancelled, highways closed people asked stay home

It's stricter thousands new cases day many Western countries.

I'm sure still handled. Chinese man.l handled. Chinese man.hinese man. basically talking lifetime type pandemic here.

That‚Äôs measurable all. You‚Äôre literally pulling opinions butt. Human life conditions involved pandemic changing rapidly. Conditions surrounding pandemic spreads 10 years ago vastly different now. want clear I‚Äôm arguing you, I‚Äôm trying give advice. teacher, held higher standards it‚Äôs blatantly obvious recent paragraph willing speak lot subjects know little about. info graphic thinking of. There‚Äôs lot pandemics. wonder many could dangerous worse Covid, conditions today. aware there's guarantee long term immunity COVID19? Seems like quite gamble. gonna kill grandma!!!!!

Very well said, agree 100% you. continue ro wear mask(properly) public. take unnecessary risks would rather catch cov, gonna hide house next year. Pretty typical trade secret protection think strategic political target anything. stop fracking defacto stop bunch gas oil development without can't get extraction want. making much worse good political tool environmentalists ends justify means kind way. Would depend are. New York got high cases I‚Äôd assume 2nd wave. Trace, Test, Isolate Hospitalizations increasing since September 26 US. Average death rate slowly rising well. Please tell metric using shows US handling better countries. Country Australia ara ""negative suzrplus deaths"" since covid protocols prevented flu spread (They spring now) Yeah idea OP talking Spain one highest deaths per capita handled pretty poorly early too. definitely dispute 99% 70s survive covid. 

But needing explain respiratory virus hitting new surge coming November country local conspiracy coincidentally dovetails parochial political obsessions, obviously weird eye rolling you, respiratory virus Northern hemisphere long expected, obviously extremely stupid. rightly dispute that.

It's matter spread currently increasing. is. Infants supposedly greater risk death young, school aged children. know infant mortality brings 20 fatality rate, can't really say that.

In case, according CDC, 19 50, chance dying COVID 0.02%, median 18 year old's chance dying would much less that. 24 hours, got morning thought going disappear like miracle. takes longer get rural communities spreads quickly there. Even someone wants careful difficult. often 1-2 shopping options forcing everyone poorly built (poorly ventilated) building. culture account resistance PPE social events like church weddings viewed necessary. Smear headline. basically said control contain mitigation. CNN front page huge font scare people, said nothing wrong. also medication costs $10 dose, charging $300 dose basic research publically funded? Almost 9/11 every day.

What embarrassment. entirely true. People visit regularly business gotten sick. I've never known wear mask since beginning this. wearing even Fauci recommended it. significant works one local emergency rooms. majority covid patients state always wear masks. That's anecdotal, none less possible glimpse. site ad service provides them. targeted here, everyone would see adverts. see adverts laptops sportswear look site right now. feel like people missing obvious wear mask u stay apart much possible. Hospitals people 100% mask compliance imperfectly distancing still distancing avoiding outbreaks.

If visit (I get it-loneliness particularly older people) least two things. might prevent infection make viral load less... We're fighting something can't see. me, bizarre. walked outside Friday, lunch. gorgeous day, cars everywhere, people everywhere. Everything seemed normal. that's lot people see feel. Unfortunately, people need 'visual' make real them. happen someone close passes away Covid complications it. People hear hospitalizations deaths, 'see' them. hear media. way really make pandemic visible per say, think would help. know how. Like everytime network goes commercials, Covid ad needs first one everytime. need billboards, etc. Hell imagine phones beeped every time someone died it. know that's impossible, think types things need. massive global PSA that's face 24/7. definitely schools. Schools open Ohio two months seen 0-3 covid cases per school district. Schools rules - masks, social distancing, cleaning, drove wedding reception place last night parking lot full. remember going disappear like magic Easter Belgium isnt trying spread garbage rest qorld army mindless goons. deceptive using selection bias. keep despite others showing errors logic. 
In parameters Sweden compared Nordic +Baltic countries. do, headed reelection rally Florida grandparents! /s Cases equal death. K find fascinating supporters disallow criticism things he's said. he's first president fully shielded accountability words say nation. Obama acted way acts, imagine fierce vitriol would be? farcical.

This going studied centuries. Good EU that‚Äôs nothing like laws countries permitting civil lawsuits  course people saying that. Every time something getting ready open open fully, subreddit throws fit insults everybody involved. That's true, I've heard even people like EU countries denying existence virus holding anti-mask rallies. ready 2nd locks America. might comfortable greater good. needs happen. Worse scenario america. elected moron president global pandemic hits. guy thought try disinfectant injections running country. know want trust Fauci grain salt this. trusted Mueller learn politically pressured alter statements. faith one man leery faith anyone associated government.  month numbers hospitals reach capacity death rate skyrocket. don‚Äôt buy ‚Äúfatigue‚Äù justification. people would get shit together act like problem, would sooner. Youd get bed first. always people run beach tsunami. It‚Äôs calm, it‚Äôs exciting, there‚Äôs lots free fish lying around. 

Pity lost souls seek higher ground. also remember, beach fun place someday. Good point, heard doctor get shoved bad angle scrape cause bleeding. Yes look stock markets point pricing return normal US consumers. least re-gift covid. Fair enoughüíØ don‚Äôt uncontrolled COVID outbreaks kind inverse situation... may entitled mask exemption based federal law, school locality willing give one, would assume stick. better hope successful vaccine developed record time, world-wide distribution effectively managed, enough people willing take it.

A national testing plan *only* way pandemic. vaccine save us without national testing plan. many questions efficacy vaccine rely one.

I personally know 10 idiots take vaccine. That‚Äôs works. lies Tegnell gang.

Sweden doesnt travellers part world neighbours. 15k Czech rep. It‚Äôs time introduce Zoom/Google Meet holiday family gatherings. still get yelling passive/aggressive comments, plus side get make favorite foods seasoned way like. I‚Äôd much rather stay alive RuSsIaN bOtS Well... 1 million deaths better 10 million. 

Your point invalid. appreciate honesty. personally think far much emphasis masks enough physical distancing. 

People seem think anti-mask people simply put masks everything would ok. 

If we‚Äôd educate people equation preventing infection time + distance. retail grocery stores haven‚Äôt vector significant community spread. Wear mask improve chance preventing asymptomatic spread. 

Masks don‚Äôt make bars, restaurants, weddings, funerals, parties, sporting events possible. primary objective lockdowns restrictions prevent hospitals getting overwhelmed covid-19 patients. achieved start pandemic. outbreak worsening there's uncertainty whether hospitals able treat new covid-19 patients. hospitals get overrun restrictions return, initially States controlled Republicans. already 100k day. Probably while. matter testing. unlimited cases especially testing sensitive. Yep. saw anti-masker day Walmart east Edmonton. police involved. 
The dude literally one store without mask though Cool possibly like them. probably jacked Google search. Even spread increasing, doesn‚Äôt mean virus actually large threat.

But is; know many people died it.  Schools factor, biggest source community spread. Social gatherings (house parties), mass gatherings (sports/concerts), offices, restaurants/bars greater sources community transmission schools. 

Schools closed less dangerous controllable government. Declaring birthday parties illegal requires lot patrolling. lock school up. perhaps followed advice strategy experienced countries. 

Yeah, would undoubtably led better results. course infinite arrogance could never admit east something better west. 

Rude.. start, lockdowns ended lot people stopped caring, and, least Alberta, school started basically requirements social distance use face masks. Yea makes sense. Sounds like needs known it‚Äôs reasonable say fracking must banned outright allowed without second thought. look sweden hospital capacity per capita US. answer question?

If could get level, sure need lockdown classified obese need lose weight, doubt, I've said sub before. weight measure health. yearly exam last week, gave tests, cbc, lipid, blood glucose, cholesterol, thyroid...couple can't remember. labs perfectly normal. blood pressure ""great"" best one they'd seen day according nurse. Dr. told I'm good job taking care (I also drink, never smoked take drugs kind) continue I'm doing! know need lose weight, especially prevent things turning normal age. wanted throw anyone avoiding Dr. thinks obesity instant ticket overall poor health disease. definitely lead it, exercising everyday (like do) eating like crap (I eat healthy) drinking alcohol, actually count towards overall health. Ok. That's all. wouldn‚Äôt week? even tomorrow? went 51,000 89,000 week. explain this, I'm living Netherlands. 


You know Belgian carried car door desert? open window hot. 


(Sjefkes ale @ me) big family, everyone COVID relatively young fully-recovered testing negative. 3 doctors family, can‚Äôt assess risks conduct thanksgiving want? week start Monday Sunday? laws 1920 laws today. Progress takes time. US move left, electoralism.

Been hearing 50 years now, see movement towards right undoing social safety nets time passes. 25,000 children die day it‚Äôs profitable feed them, long wait save lives? 

The illusion progress keeps liberals rooted awful ideology. Obama spent 8 years bombing poor people color little progress make towards good undone trump. makes believe leading towards something good?

Anyways, I‚Äôm rambling. Read Marx. explains clearly capitalism always fall towards fascism. don‚Äôt mean come you, product capitalism all. encourage read though, used stuck position. First summer fall...vaccine mean ends next day. need enough every one forget anti-vaxers get test results fast area?  Percent positive rate helps. Rate stays drops due increased testing. rising rate suggests real increase prevalence. North worse South close behind. Could go either way I‚Äôm confident North hold lead. specific type humans...

In country second wave, people 15 segment lower incidence. higher incidence 15-24 (highschool college) 100% this. I‚Äôm teacher Germany struggle teaching online. kids live villages rural areas couldn‚Äôt attend 1/3 classes internet connection. time kids could attend started poorly seriously like zombies lack contact stimulation. school district groups kids didn‚Äôt school week (but rather every week). taught zoom actually taught lessons using prezi presentations, know almost classes got online instruction (just busy work book). younger kids really struggled lot. Dogs might able contract too, that‚Äôs enough say thanks. Break her, dog deserves better. know max percent positivity rate height first wave Sweden also tried. Social distancing, gathering restrictions, visiting bans elderly care, closing schools etc.

For reasons hit hard? Sweden got notoriously fucked hundreds thousands people go alps every year, European outbreak one first major pandemic zones (before country anything). people brought back densely populated areas Sweden. weekends always lower? gonna lie pandemic Well it‚Äôs worth pointing people you‚Äôre seeing aren‚Äôt getting sick people getting sick aren‚Äôt people you‚Äôre seeing. Let's logical lol 90K bad compared countries. NL 10K day, population 17m.

People may try point finger politically US really worse Europe. 4 right turns you‚Äôre right back started! it‚Äôs personal belief. disregarded political posturing. That‚Äôs part I‚Äôm pissed about. Oh fuck guy know anyone covid. That's enough convince me. currently aunt induced coma due covid. Get fucked. Maybe not, testing much less first time round. first time round maybe 5-10x time maybe 1-2x? knows ü§£ü§£

Perhaps death two maybe, believe widespread community spread actually occurring China? clearly case. China's censorship capability good, good. 

I fan authoritarian governments like China, pretend like China school West terms contain pandemic - admittedly times ruthless tactics. 

The poster responded exaggerating. community spread form detected, China literally shuts cities mandates testing everyone. Even millions. 

China's economy mostly recovered - even hard-to-fake data like electricity production materials movement.  think NZ dealt like Sentinelese deal visits helicopters. Well watched documentary Parc Asterix tonight.

These reports coming months seems pretty much true, contested.. means lot old people tagged onto covid deaths probably die covid, might 1500 2000 deaths counted covid Sweden actually aren't

And second, like people commenting here, find perverse idea somehow keeping sick, 85 plus year olds tubed ICU somehow dignified humane. Artificially Preserving life sake weeks absurd burden emotional energy (for dying family) worst almost criminal abuse healthcare structures resources (a finite resource) reserved used save people real chance pulling one side actual life go back live out

Almost part knows beliefs bs. Ok where's ""here's why"" part? Crazy Swedish government loosens assembly limit 50 500 Nov 1 long 100,000 new cases one day?

A ago.

Current estimate 140k / day.

 Im area well white boomers young children wearing masks. confusing. Probably lower that. According [CDC 20s 0.003%. He‚Äôs says here. Stop sensitive people talk daily basis much worried covid-19 islamism... people produce [Memory B response COVID infection?

Those cells last decades rapidly respond reinfection. Nice know tested symptomatic get free. I'm symptomatic either. turned work told ""They testing upstairs. want go?"" I'm like ""why not, free!""

So let get straight. Neither us symptomatic getting tested free. 

Then (up now) quite fortunate may fortune keep blessing I. Masks make life expectancy brrrrrr must take multi pronged analysis questions like this: covid restrictions can't evaluated based covid data only.

Yes, yes, we're adding unrelated problems numbers moved pandemic: Traffic deaths (reduced road traffic), influenza deaths measures working covid-19 curb spread influenza well. Title post said ""Ch..., Taiwan, Vietnam"", replied ""The communist countries shining usual"".

I took mean including Taiwan?

If weren't, apologies. Yes please. long take get results back? Wait vaccine dammit! personally dont like way forced take test. prohibited going work unless take test. issue many people simply cant afford unemployed 2 weeks. Government declared getting test voluntary, effectively forcing poor people take it. linked recent outbreak WH says got elsewhere probably say used ""precautions"" still got it. could highlight age underlying medical conditions could even say would died flu caught it. I'm also unfamiliar Herman Cain got sick (was working WH?). seems like close Trump people. Biden never met Borat that‚Äôs Biology specialty. hated dissecting worms High School wish opportunity take courses online. Math computers liking.

My momma always told would get cold stayed long outdoors cold forgive ignorance. estimated 40% would herd immunity May.

So thought 40% would immunity may. (So context said april guess?)

And claimed said ""Stockholm nearly herd immunity.""

So thats another thing made make Sweden look bad then? guess others people keeping symptoms fake persons. thought wasnt worth effort stomp virus spring.

Now shittiest situation possible.

Who could predicted this? /s Ah yeah definitely. Australia - Victoria vs states specifically - perfect, text book case study proving theory.

It's I'm resigned huge, never ending second wave UK. We're going test bed herd immunity. intentionally think good idea, inevitable unless reimpose full lockdown long failing trace system. Exactly. That's confident fine, especially Pence. Yes, ignorance Li Wenliang blind acceptance PRC telling truth covid statistics suits fine, thanks. never said anything Taiwan tho.. Disagree what? never mentioned Taiwan..  estimated 40% would herd immunity May. massively wrong. criticized everyone else‚Äôs approaching including, closer boarders, closing businesses wearing masks. 
He‚Äôs said he‚Äôs happy Sweden‚Äôs strategy. guess doesn‚Äôt exactly say it‚Äôs great Sweden. I‚Äôll edit that. 
I‚Äôm looking make sweden look bad friend. talk unemployment office see quit qualify due this? Well, said big part. mean taken factor. Canada mixed bag comes political will. Atlantic coast, provinces done well even allowed transit among them. there's province recently moved government spine anything substantial. even frustrate efforts parents distance learning requiring doctor's note. make half national cases we've shut everything schools we're basically placing responsibility pandemic response children able follow protocols parents acting good faith, testing kids self-isolating, rather sending symptomatic kids school.


So we're basically screwed. TV saying like can't track anymore requesting help countries, like need 500 ventilators. 
Also something like worst case 70 000 cases per day. No. part managed system. refuse deliver sub par care. Trying say likely retire forced practice ethically. would wear mask outside? Agree this. high school teacher also teaches part time university nearby. husband two classes right now. One prof awesome job keeps cancelling classes without really communicating students. shit show students class prof husband show fine (we survey them).

Edit spelling Would fine without last line. Edit ask question :) Yes go ahead compare Sweden Colombia that's country bracket think belong in. also get best medical treatment. indeed statistically easily roll dice compare rest us poor schleps. agree catastrophic. Unless plan mass grave, would free whole lot beds. bad proven herd immunity thing this. Pence's strategy deal this, obviously working.

I'll keep wearing mask, online order pickups groceries stay home unless I'm coming work (security). bad many suffer inept government. Melbourne extended family ignoring regulations spreading disease across city. That's addition private security guards fucking.

Many want behaved like jailed long terms - fuckwits caused much pain, say hard fast shutdown - gaps. means companies close two weeks roads blocked, that's be.

And original problem Melbourne stay locked long enough join rest country zero cases. half arsed it. Hope time Andrews continues tell Murdoch suck dick job done. yeah. read liked it, first came across misrepresented version anti mask uncle's Facebook page. 

It talks providing alternative housing split multi generation houses, months paid sabbatical workers 60 can't work home, free n95 risk groups, sick leave younger people locked down, etc. 

It seems like good idea paper, though suspect implementation would fail protect poor risk people. falls apart false. SARS barely affected Korea all.

It MERS ""problem"" even one hospital fuckup caused cluster.

If SARS prepared countries pandemic, Canada best response ones got hit pretty hard. Canada maybe acceptably, definitely anywhere close best current trend pretty worrying. Lemme guess....

American? bad, people symptoms track traced going tests higher chance infected.

Czechs care, pissed restrictions. Otherwise meh whatever things also happened Sweden degree high schools universities closed, social life put hold, economy crashed thousands thousands lost jobs. There's evidence written second paragraph Thanks clarification. Ventilation indoors must active specifically targeted situation lots space makes little difference.

Fish mammals different. 
The chances virus jump fish mammals quite low ( impossible close impossible )

Keep mind we've exposed flu years vaccines it, yet many people died regardless. completely missing point, millions die lockdowns (if continue), businesses sources income utterly obliterated kinds mental health issues heightened extreme. mention, virus really deadly specific group, older people compromised immune systems, suffer sake. take proper approaches virus considering lives risk, also take appropriate measures prevent spread, like masks. something absolutely horrible forcing country grind halt unnecessary start, like said track damage virus ever would done anything. time go lives

Also, said 'if young gives shit', meant gonna affected virus whatsoever literally nothing worry (except possibly spreading it, could've done better job elaborating on). Anyways, good day Swarming reddit anything cure Sweden's tarnished reputation. Rather opposite. need take word it, [read That's good hear.

Yeah, medium term plans nz COVID app begin using Apple google data framework, currently based scanning codes, location data really seal deal effort required. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre limiting shopping malls max 10 persons otherwise it‚Äôs bullshit politics.

The Swedish strategy since beginning focusing measures accepted time. Nothing relaxed that. Look happens rest Europe now. Authorities going time numver restrictions, losing confidence people continue confuse people. meaning hard restrictions people don‚Äôt intend follow them. 

A months ago Sweden #8 deaths per millions, #17. Nothing relaxed that, people trying summarize effects middle pandemic. Good point... daily megathread. Actually pretty expected seeing protests rallied far right Forza Nuova. bunch idiots. Yeah, Sweden never eyes. expect magically happen summer?

The thing happened summer. Whether futile hope might work anyone's guess. Two unpublished preprints relating specific areas Brazil equate 'most South America infected'. 

Who ever said ""most South America""?

I said ""the areas South America virus allowed spread unimpeded""

And dismiss preprints, even disqualifying sin terms power moderate sub. 

Fetishizing peer review sure sign someone clue science works. please seal bubble Nov 4th? NZ economy isnt destroyed. Q2 results bad included lockdown even -12% GDP line OECD countries short term pain/long term gain means Q3 Q4 streets ahead countries seeing new waves surges. get right? UK -25% GDP lockdowns coming winter. Meanwhile business confidence NZ higher last year time. false narrative.  Thanks that. high urbanisation rate population density combination lot close daily contacts commuting, workplace schools course explain it. explain extremely sharp decline hospitalisation summer?

Did/do people work home able to? Switzerland talking about.

Maybe completely wrong understanding society, really expect them. Rhetoric /r) Melbourne daily megathread? Two different places. Deaths lag cases fair margin. Person tests positive Oct 23rd, enters hospital Oct 28th, dies Nov 7th. you. holidays coming may see really scary action death tally hospital systems overrun. already way regions state. big cities gonna get hit hard though too, going get ugly.

So yeah, bleak. Welcome 2020, guess. Contact tracing working fairly well British Columbia. Roughly 75% new cases traced back known exposure event. currently 4,000 people 14 day self-isolation close contacts known cases.

The disclaimer statement cases jumped dramatically past Thursday. don‚Äôt get updates weekend (although labs full day testing) wait Monday know numbers stabilized continued grow rate. it‚Äôs latter, might problem. admissions given day. [As 23th 5314 hospitalized 772 serious/critical condition. [As 24th least 755 ICU, 400 ventilated 13 ECMO, 24th data could slightly under-reported due delays reporting. thought gonna go that? There's absolutely way x happen anyone, happen personally.

\- logic Norway‚Äôs economy generates c.38% GDP exports fared whilst also providing stimulus sweden. 

I merely providing context Swedens economy performed poorly. Two unpublished preprints relating specific areas Brazil equate 'most South America infected'. Brazil paper suggests around 50% best.

Both papers yet peer reviewed may pass peer review stage.

Don't state preprints fact - shows really understand reading.

And second highest number deaths world really something hold shining example things?  researchers calculated rapidly coronaviruses degrade different temperatures trapping conditions, found temperature 90 degrees Celsius could achieve thousandfold millionfold reduction viral particles, depending final mask size. also showed temperature achieved running electrical current across 0.1-millimeter thick copper mesh thermoelectric heater, powered small battery. current prototypes include 9-volt battery, would provide enough power heat mask hours would cool air inhaled. Except reality doesn‚Äôt work way. unfamiliar COVAX - barely news - here's excellent explanation projected work - done (there still tons hurdles): Ah right, Uninformed guess. Gotcha.

The winter 2021-22 everyone getting again... Take grain salt I've taken similarly-sized countries account, might Belgium extremely small lot places densely populated. twice population Denmark, example. people work cities, there's constant commute heavy reliance public transportation -- also often fit social distancing. rush hour NMBS often fails provide enough compartments since 2nd/1st class split (which means one compartment can't used ticket holders), sometimes 3 compartments remain. I've seen trains full doors close.

Masks deemed useless months, people often want wear wear incorrectly. lot people also reuse masks wash them. offices, one wears masks unless common area.

In social situations, bubble guidelines often followed, people house parties meeting 5 people (I think allowed amount). Pubs restaurants also entirely filled reopened allowed meetups 10 (?) people. 

Kids deemed able spread virus, June kids allowed meet however many kids wanted, go overnight camps, hobbies together, go school. Masks mandatory age 12. 

Anyone 12 wear mask school, given pass secondary school way work say masks go moment leave walk home/to station one big group, really socially distanced. welcome present evidence support assertion. Schools opened months ago Europe, several countries said seen anything would suggest schools driving spread. study, aimed evaluate stability SARS-CoV-2 four different heat conditions (37, 42, 56, 60 ¬∞C) report virus stable 37 ¬∞C least 24 hours. Heating 56 ¬∞C 30 minutes, however, effectively inactivated virus preserved stability viral RNA human sera sputum samples. findings provide critical information regarding biology virus well practical way inactivate infectious virus potentially found clinical specimens.  Im happy see write this. feel regarding conservatives wanting nothing aswell, must frustrating see that.

Its crazy see Sweden become sort example them. Usually hate Sweden.

They totally misunderstood everything though, peoples lives changed alot. would try imagined do-nothing strategy US would end catastrophy. point looks like seeing 300 deaths day kind baked already...

Sure, domestic tourism help. lose everything, cut back bit - tourism operators good they're used seasonal peaks.

In NZ thought tourism industry big part economy turned domestic tourism could keep alive even prospered. Greece might like that, domestic tourism could go long way helping keep things going. Nah July part first wave. April first wave north West, July first wave south Trashing arbitrary reasons? There‚Äôs arbitrary apparently republicans think it‚Äôll disappear November it‚Äôs democrat libs plot remove trump. Infuriating. Why, kind information back up, guess? comes clearly worse.

Panic  Maine looks appealing moment. subreddit loves using New Zealand shining example good governance covid-19 emulate. Everyday news New-Zealand great.

What people tend forget that, except China, countries great islands. New Zealand, South Korea, Japan either islands akin islands (only landborder NorthKorea, secure closely guarded border world), coincidence.

How want emulate except ... making island ? mean island guarantees success, necessary sufficient condition.

If island, covid spreading country, absolutely chance suppress it. think long term solution takes consideration multiple factor : sustainability, psychology, economic situation people, existence idiots conspiracy theorists etc, lockdowns it. Export recovery. enough outvote them, though. Well rate certainly looking possible. confirm: live Idaho idiot.


But I‚Äôm big enough idiot believe covid doesn‚Äôt exist. That‚Äôs **dumb** Japan companies produce wide range products don‚Äôt share single resemblance nature. Agreed, multiple stories, front pages.  selfish citizens

It really nice surprise tbh, could actually feel entire country get little bit nicer understanding. Almost breaches first lockdown. kidding, would love hear BS reason wearing mask violates Christian faith! nuts many people unhappy parents can't stand kids around. good kid parents always happy growing up.

I think norm. think norm secret, parents cut actually regret kids. already flawed system UK since last month. husband needed isolate room 2 retired members household. Using bathroom kitchen mask. 10 days husband allowed go work. got symptoms day 8 stay home another 10 days. Rest family house 6 days after. test symptoms. Worst thing even told stay house wouldnt ""its long annoying"". üò∂ happen without school. School means happens bigger groups smaller rooms. risky much like. awards that.

Funny people confident opinions 99% times ones understand complexity situation hand ""since masking definitely Christian faith

I'm Christian know religious bar wearing mask pandemic. notion pure idiocy! People took reopening granted we‚Äôre screwed. seen packed beaches near Toronto. stuck phrase ‚Äúreopening? like reNOpening‚Äù  general, gov's response wagging fingers us make sure take seriously, except foreign worker dorm situation. yes, quite trustworthy. *Laughs Iranian* HA! Like ever going go away. lockdown get cases single-digits combined proper support people comply it.

yes that's easy paper, reality not. Even lockdown, lowest number reported Belgium 20 cases. Italy, lowest number active cases around 10k, even two months lockdown. lockdown till reach nearly 0 cases sustainable majority countries (probably still would lockdown), especially ones high numbers since beginning. problem would hurt financial interests current Western elite.

It actually hurting small family-owned businesses, consider 100% doable without considering financial situation thousands people, think actually doable actually know that. less countries communists competent leadership. countries head state could wrangle everyone government single minded purpose follow clear plan could protect countries. funny people trying use turn communist vs capitalist democratic vs authoritarian form government main drive success crisis. not. forms strengths weaknesses comes competency leading people. one idaho official literally said people stupid tmwear mask, gives up, going watch idiots die hope kill

[found Yup. we're getting first cool weather CA.  Covid likes this.  Well, dont seem much case. serious answer this, nutshell, yes.

Even putting aside fact Singapore government (as far aware) likely one least corrupt world and, especially elections concluded earlier year, little reasonable incentive lie numbers, compelling practical reasons trust figures. 

Consider Singapore‚Äôs size, population density, transparency reporting *each every case* (to detail critics may tempted argue privacy violations) relatively efficient nature Singapore‚Äôs healthcare ensures population largely healthy begin with. 

IMO, would near impossible single case unreported kept hidden amount time without exposed family, gossips, rumourmongers, media, (in couple weeks) natural COVID-19 spread. true. first China, virus already NZ, since spreads aggressively shutting borders alone enough. 6 week lockdown reopened new cases reported. rocket science, isolate virus dies. think tried protect elderly asking stay home, clearly failed (just like many countries). cases spike really hard control gets infected keep long term care homes. thing. realize engineering brought water drink, roads drive on, medical devices used hospitals

Correct, totally irrelevant. certainly mean every engoineer knows *use* them.

I think that's missed point. early enough. early enough successfully spread across world. Thanks China! That's true experience Still honest pr tlhentrump That's true, headline news, there's multiple articles it, every time there's update progress. Much easier masks hand washing, bravo addition everything said, many families cannot afford electronic devices needed get online, especially several school age children home, would need one. don‚Äôt kids maybe something done that, first heard online learning thing, knew families without wifi computer sort would left behind. agree fully states federal.

Why? IMO global. organisation could enforce emergency pandemic rules everywhere would fully support it. Can't life understand federal govt take charge federal top downplaying virus makes near impossible state enforce.

exactly sort unspoken belief hard subjects supersets easier subjects. reason happened UK European countries initially lock down. Italy basically first country Europe get hit hard know coming healthcare system overwhelmed. UK refused lock first decided take Sweden's approach keep everything open PM got really sick. thing Sweden kept saying healthcare system perfectly capable handling surge cases whole time used defend approach. Evidently system able handle surge. lol like 5 counting Everyone elder care. higher death explained that. I‚Äôm really sure point. I‚Äôm screamer though seems are. Btw reason infected nurses weren‚Äôt caught Tengell refused believe people aren‚Äôt sick can‚Äôt transmit it. Obviously wrong even seems reluctant recognize that. odd wrote ""millions never actually get better.""

I never wrote this. ANOTHER user. hard be?

Please stop accusing saying things say. mind thought ensure meal replacement shake came head , ‚Äú right ? that‚Äôs drink .‚Äù Thank Us shutting would catastrophic immigrant populations. shut country super harsh authoritarian measures early on, country really low covid stats. *sometimes* , usually Yes? situation get back normal needs done deal virus, people die never going come back. ND? prolly lot. ND wyoming pretty red. TX otherhand...

for reference ND 60% turnout national average. texas 51 Totally agree wearing mask arduous all. Depends mean socially distance...

A lot measures like WFH, avoid indoor bars etc yes definitely really difficult. 

But I'm going pretend people really going struggle seeing family friends months end.

I'm one herd immunity nutjobs trying excuse people breaching restrictions. let's honest lot people introverts struggle go 6 months without meaningfully seeing family/friends, particularly Xmas. I'd bet good money something government could wanted badly enough. calling anyone moron isn‚Äôt racism. especially POLAND POLISH. son airlifted twice medical problems Canada. times thing asked go ride keep comfortable. death rate high early high numbers spread retirement homes elderly care. happened infected nurses nit caught early enough, unrelated lockdown. explained numerous times Swedish authorities, happily ignored people like completely unable look past screams masks lockdowns. hope also means stop delivering democracy countries. Like usual. subreddit long infested pro-Chinese trolls bots. That's kinda sad think turn away business. 

So OK selling beer 12 year old? everyone eats places , goes churches. keeping indoor dining closed happened churches risky business. could have? originated China. vaccine? would wait lack vaccine? much cheaper mask mean year goes on? almost November. year already gone on. think money grows trees though. homeless people everywhere? way. doubt fully reopen students vaccinated. Seeing students probably last line, say Fall 2021 *very* earliest. Dude fucking stop, asian country hit hard Iran ""But despite comparatively high fatalities, testing failures, reports medical negligence nursing homes, Sweden‚Äôs Covid-19 approach still enjoys relatively high degree support amongst citizens.""

I'm again, somehow buy hoax bullshit 

It's faces, hoax? I'm surprised. requires tax revenue also affected shutdowns. study peer reviewed, look comments, gets attacked pretty hard.

I'd cautious believing something like case medical scientific consensus. Epidemiologist seem agree closing borders effective virus already widespread sides border. European countries integrated, many people living one side border working, shopping other. thing closing airports harbors. would closing ""borders"" places infrastructure go middle towns. got nurses following protocol set authorities. ignore facts. desperate attempt making Tegnell's fault zero backing facts, either knowingly lying stupid understand.

All would take would slight interest facts rather making things up.

But obviously interested facts. Considering every day new covid record somewhere USA it‚Äôs probably difficult keep coming headlines. mean people need quote chapter verse Jesus said wear mask pandemic! ridiculous even think that! know of. I'm EMT work medical field. lot friends also work medical field we've hit pretty goddamned hard. Med director one EDs vent 6 weeks. thought gonna fine. Nope strokes getting better come vent.

""See, ICU beds, worries"".

As case least 20% end die rest probably messed life experience. 

But yeah, ICU bed them, problem whatsoever... Republicans never want clear language money's used for. get wrong, democrats rarely do, Republicans never do. It‚Äôs got Tegnell‚Äôs lack understanding spread. refusal listen countries studies completed overseas. That‚Äôs fact schmuck friend. keep saying I‚Äôm supporting lockdowns. I‚Äôm not. Never have. either. Found idiots live. India people Africa Worst take 2020 award üèÜ

goes that‚Äôs right, LITERALLY worked thousands upon thousands times harder anyone else. Literally thousands upon thousands blood sweat tears anyone.

...this. Imagine thinking work blood, sweat, tears. Example: need fill buckets water river. cup hands fill buckets milliliters time. put buckets river. worked lot harder. filled lot buckets. clear, don‚Äôt think anyone saying hard work good ideas shouldn‚Äôt rewarded.

Yes, someone saying that. I'm saying that. Hard work good ideas *rewarded*, reward something someone decide on. things *free earn can*, gains punished. get tested every 3-7 days.

It honestly even bother anymore. Ten times worse Norway. Care comment that? think? That's amazing. know brought smile face dark time. like hearing stories governments treating foreign citizens well. math sucks alot conjecture point.

All said possibility exactly itl play out. wouldn‚Äôt surprised doesn‚Äôt get followed.

Yeah that's definitely going get special mention history books written. part ""caused period uncontrolled spread eldercare"" difficult understand? would changed lockdown, nursed still worked.

This explained detail. simply choose ignore facts support argument. I'm proud Sweden they've handled COVID-19, even though wish could've fewer fuck-ups long-term peripheral issues kept cool. demanded action sake it, required action sake it.

The result death rate 58/100k compared 12 Denmark 5 Norway. *And you‚Äôre fucking proud that?* Excuse I‚Äôm disgusted. brainwashed possible be? disappeared Easter, silly! /s think vaccine provide false sense security. Great explanation another redditor read said something like

Efficacy dependant vaccine also many people get vaccine. 

If half total population get it, 50 percent efficacy rate, would 25 percent protected short amount time... simple math correct

Which definitely shit odds considering itl spread back wears off.

Meanwhile everyone think ""oh there's vaccine I'm fine wear masks distance!""

Except that's shit works.

Even 70 percent efficacy rate vaccine would rough half population gets it. understand 70 percent would amazing. 

Beyond we'd vaccinate pretty much 90 percent population within whatever time frame vaccine lasts really stop spread. dont doubt record. backwards way say 2 days straight record covid numbers. almost like government trying handle thing new deadly phenomenon trial error, choose listen health experts business owners.  Unless teacher 70 risk regular flu.

Yeah, really, arena concert can‚Äôt 500 attendees?
Not mention ridiculous rules smaller venues follow, arbitrary restrictions restaurants completely erratic way mask mandate applied.

That's little bit terrifying, informative. would interesting see whether politician would actually seize powers unintended consequences would be, well whether they'd later agree give powers up.

I'm sure cyberpunk writers covered well... aren‚Äôt obvious cruel Christianity scrum licked top government down.

Actually, common diseases caused comparable death rates (the various recent pandemic flus), indeed infected millions matter months (ditto). So, no, that's nonsense.

And say develop vaccine speed unheard history vaccine-development covid *special*?

That also nonsense.

hey hey! slap NSFW label post gonna post kind hardcore stuff U gotta understand crashed first place know gonna go now

The Fed dropping interest rates March meant companies w interest rate swaps w banks post collateral banks. time, banks cap reserve requirement, needed sell bonds order meet cap reserve. time, none could bid cheap bonds = bond crash. lot financial entities lever eyeballs bonds bonds crash get margin called need sell stock too, add derivatives mix (see Allianz pension fund deleted march coz strategy involved selling puts never print except situation) thats crashed

W interest rates 0 forseeable future one lever bonds anymore rly money goes stonk actually right. people mask compliant. really gatherings creat trouble. people partying together little mask wearing people eating drinking. thought would share this. I‚Äôm currently South Korea seeing firsthand incredible handling virus. Firstly airport, husband go extremely extensive process bunch documents prove could even quarantine together. literally call family 3 times let us leave yellow taped area confirmed people picking us up. began 2 week quarantine, downloaded gov app tracked location 24/7 could step foot front door. input symptoms temperature 2x day. get Covid testing done gave us free bag tons stuff like sanitizers, masks, bags garbage burn quarantine etc

Daily life Korea, won‚Äôt see one single person without mask on. inside outside too. Even one around they‚Äôre walking alone they‚Äôre still mask. one wearing cloth homemade masks they‚Äôre high protection. People serious following rules ‚Äúappreciation events‚Äù like they‚Äôre covering city pink lights show appreciation caring others wearing mask. Everyone required download app scans QR code order enter restaurants cafes. way outbreak (due people taking masks eat) government track exactly building contact people interview make map places went. required law go get Covid testing done. Korea government pays entire Covid treatment someone even don‚Äôt many symptoms still go hospital get care. daily update system sends public alerts phone (like kind get amber alerts US) many new cases area, many, places people went. general Korean people government taking Covid extremely seriously. 

Korea extremely fast find positive cases immediately quarantine notify people. many cases group people tested positive Covid one two people kept masks tested negative. outbreak across street us funeral. 27 people took mask eat one guy kept whole time one didn‚Äôt test positive Covid. 

It frustrates much see many people say masks don‚Äôt work Americans continuing go act like nothing happening. Look many people getting infected many people die. Look country like Korea keeping numbers 100 day. Americans see this? virus speaks volumes US gov American ‚Äúme‚Äù culture well. Korean people wearing masks many many years long pandemic. wearing masks everyday hours hours. Guess what. one died wearing mask. Whiny Americans singing ‚Äúme me, mine mine mine, masks bad, boo, don‚Äôt give shit anyone me‚Äù need seriously stfu. 

Wish didn‚Äôt go back... Comparing continent country? Oh ok worst we‚Äôve seen it. don‚Äôt live big city don‚Äôt multiple hospitals take patients. I'm from, kids can't get tested without showing symptoms.

If kids 99% asymptomatic, testing seems upside me. People don‚Äôt understand always going risks associated living free society Hahaha even America. pandemic made finally accept majority humans suck. prefer freedom choice. wanna wear one cool, me. state experiencing ‚Äúsurge‚Äù, yet state-wide mandate wear masks, even outdoors. everyone wearing masks state, ‚Äúsurge‚Äù?
Unless masks don‚Äôt actually... Take upvote. So, speaking working soapbox out, following law, jury box help, can't shit elected official ballot box able removed, sort seems like box left ammo box. ‚ÄúKept son away family‚Äù 

‚ÄúQuarantined since March‚Äù

It‚Äôs insane statements like continually blow mind willingly people throw away everything life whatever government says correct virtuous. actually trying find good data show *why* CDC put outdoor, socially distanced activity like trick-or-treating high risk category. 

I found interview epidemiologist proffered people meeting families trick-or-treat large groups, that‚Äôs apparently something that‚Äôs done everyone, makes risky. said don‚Äôt that, stay distanced people handing candy fine. 

I keep seeing people say instead trick treating (because think it‚Äôs risky) they‚Äôre going party home friends it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNO. world?? think that‚Äôs better???‚Äù
I completely agree parties going main spread source Halloween. Minnesotan here. There's stark contrast Twin Cities (where everyone wears masks) greater Minnesota, people want pretend life normal. relatives rural Minnesota, think covid hoax mask mandates violate civil liberties.  Yeah, nice story. Thankfully don‚Äôt need advice internet trolls. fun. flatten curve, understand flattening curve means right? feel like somehow people got head flattening curve means decreasing number cases, means. means spreading number cases longer period time. exactly happened, I'm saying US well, far it, absolutely categorically flattened curve.

We literally barely caught Italy, Spain, UK France total number deaths per capita. cataclysmically huge outbreak, locked extremely hard. Europe back 200k cases day. flattened curve, spread past months, Europe flatten curve, two massive outbreaks.

And clear, Europe millions cases back spring. fact horrible job reporting cases low numbers good thing. took number cases countries mentioned back divided number deaths, virus killed 20% people infected according numbers. kill many people, massively reported number cases. difference quarantining tested quarantine without tested?

If serious, infectious period generally happening symptomatic. responsibility inform Health department trace contacts stop spread. Thanks linking me. read first one? appears cloth masks shown increase particles worse mask? interpreting wrong? obv contrary articles. Okay, explain us Britain quite countries facing issue PoC disproportionately hit? I'm curious since blaming trump dangerous covid rallies I‚Äôm saying ‚ÄúNo u‚Äù sound.... Ya know what.

You also find lots articles online ""long covid"" affects life ""survivors"" (I've posted two right above).

In 30s, according I've seen, likelihood develop kinds *possibly life long* symptoms much higher whatever side effects vaccines going be.

Logic fail. masks prevent spread infection well claimed, populace masked early would prevented front line workers refer seeing many Covid-19 patients. Fauci mocked Americans wearing masks, said risk virus ""minuscule"" spreading across country. Changing mind months later, spread already occurred hardly worth boasting about, considering Fauci confident pandemic would occur Trump's presidency, although he's never presented evidence show confident this. 

He also pushed US gov't buy doses buddies expensive, patent medication, Remdisivir, already unsuccessfully hawked Gilead treatment HIV, Ebola. Now, thanks Fauci, we've spent billions useless, patent medication. Don‚Äôt bloody sensitive

Idaho comments local health district reports people blaming positive results mask wearers uncited stats assume they‚Äôve pulled ass.

Urban young people usually liberal/ left leaning, therefore likely take precautions. Let say COVID positive wearing mask nose. spreading virus breath carrier don‚Äôt wear properly false least won‚Äôt harm people.

Without constant testing, way know carrying.

There zero reasons cover nose well asymptomatic carrying thing. course, one really tell spreading COVID.

Exactly, simply cannot tell, wearing mask ensures not.

Wear fucking mask.

Also, spelled ""breathe"". Looking worldometer, daily new infection rate peaked 72k dropped 30k, back 70s. Personally consider peak trough, understand disagree feel another metric better. downvoted?? probably would meant getting rid trump. ask Yes people American associate numbers better head. 

What fuck you? annoyed people attempting better process information?

Jesus. Wore out? Lol... brother twice week, doesnt complain. wears out, feel bad. Thank god. Makes sense you‚Äôre coming random reasons blame corona Americans hate America general. Everyone hates winner.

Suddenly Republicans decide virus real blame Biden it. push back, demand bipartisan bills something it. Nothing done. Yeah. Dads want get kids tested, Moms constantly vetoing. 

/s

Stop blaming women everything Great. states gonna send overflowing patients CA!! Camacho 10x president trump could ever hope be. punitive measures lockdown breakers potential virus spreaders.

Uh... still without lockdown. test trace aggressively quarantine/isolate every positive case close contacts. also quarantine arrivals (from at-risk areas, domestic foreign).

Even example breaking quarantine (arrival case iirc) instead general lockdown.

Also, point generally there'd far fewer potential virus spreaders begin *people* respond proactively, thus obviating need governmental imposition. October people US still saying ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù comes mandate. nobody surprised 80k+ plus cases last days. think complicated mix things, overly value ""individualism"" ""self-sufficiency"" America, comes good bad things. Glad there's people like you. That‚Äôs good, got tested July went wayyyyyyyy back Look, PA used frontier. really land west. üòÇ That's know talking about.

The relevant thing date, days since first detection community case--assuming testing capacity similar levels countries time (which may fair assumption). NZ, first detection triggered immediate move Level 3, planned move maximum Level 4 2 days time. Let's start Citizens United move there. money political regulatory process good move. Start dying much higher rates.

People quote death rate stat realizing that‚Äôs optimal conditions. soon patient ratio increases occurred Italian NYC hospitals, that‚Äôs death rates shot up.

My country decreted one longest lockdowns world, 5 months (Morocco), first Africa daily cases : 4000 cases daily 20% positivity rate. government even provide enough means population lockdown :a meager 200$ month people got. 

This subreddit loves talking listening science scientists, ""lockdown magical solution everything"" coming science medias. follow scientific news /r/covid19 see scientists agreeing lockdowns magical solution every place every context.

And warn lockdowns sustainable solution fight covid19 ? virus control, amount testing would reveal almost 100,000 new cases day. want know main reason spike is

People gathering private homes, friends family. days ago, Lori said bars restaurants big factor spread. sarcasm ND Governor wanting kill seniors reduce state costs. Even though people likely survive hospitalized, gonna matter hospital beds, staff therapeutic drugs left treat them. 

Seeing cases Saturday nuts literally nobody discussing shutdowns rollbacks re-opening. 

We're probably get hard lesson exponential growth coming weeks. far, actual science shown antibodies remain present 4 6 months infection. decent drop right recovery, seem remain pretty stable (for long test).

Disclaimer... people studied. course people lucky. Yeah surely 100% attributable masks. like closed society transit locked people homes, mandated masks, yeah masks definitely 100% effective. wear ever, surgically added babies faces ensure lifetime compliance - morons propaganda machine churning full speed Danish media. Sounds like Wisconsin. Funny, us upper midwesterners always prided ability drink party. came time stop months undoubtedly costed lives. I'd rather direct anger large corporate power abusing people. Yea borders closed serious virus til woolworth's still exists Why? places winters? US really big ones would called RV small ones tow behind truck called campers. Woo hoo!

If think that, wrong. clearly know either things assuming historical connection.

Zika example pretty directly affect reproduction. don‚Äôt know long term sperm counts eggs. 

We know stress also plays role. added distress surrounded death, overrun hospitals, sick general stressful. without considering economic stress half year without aid.

We also know Long Haul Covid thing one biggest battles chronic fatigue affecting *a lot* adults. ever tired can‚Äôt keep eyelids open it‚Äôs frustrating? Imagine that, time. Taking care children already exhausting physically mentally (and economically!) imagine chronic condition may struggling get day. Chronic fatigue also tends lead depression. pregnant trying birth baby condition?? would pass. Even PIV sex going challenging many depression meds also make erections/orgasms difficult. Living lives dying deaths. wild ideas, I'll give that. Hope I'll see none sanctions then! think Sweden's population sounds brainwashed? People tend forget tourism, hospitality, clubs, restaurants, many countries, highly essential tax income stream. Nothing ever easy seems. Im sorry rolling /partial lockdowns even shutdowns much failure downstream repercussions. 
 
Sweden effective lockdown Norway Denmark Estonia Latvia (not sure Finland). thing. would unacceptable...lolüòÇ Um, cleaning sites creates jobs too... Seems like bigger replay sun belt surge - records started set across region amid big surge daily cases, deaths nationally lowest since March. Quite obviously deaths surged significantly following weeks. 

The primary reason cases rising infections rising - positivity rates climbing etc. summer sunbelt surge, deaths obviously going rise that. 1/3 Americans pre diabetes diabetes. run can‚Äôt hide. don‚Äôt count Uk Japan islands, still massive countries - harder contain. South Korea functionally island pretty big population. Nobody ever talks Vietnam‚Äôs success. aren‚Äôt though. Part reason suffering bad bc acted totally normally summer.

So coronavirus, need cure both. stick nose wore lmfao come man, done 3x month bad refering to? could eliminate virus vaccine, herd immunity global China style lockdown least many months? Hondurans walk hundreds miles, yes, believe possible Americans also it. think that's vaccines bridge gap. Fingers majorly crossed. definitely sane... actually tasked prevention counterfeiting. presidential protection side mission agency I've also heard gonne different ways too. Like people die heart attack, corona &amp; get marked ""covid death"" (not sure thats true, remember hospitals back funding) virus (better conditions spread they're outside even) 
Yeah, would normally ask source buddy. nah, energy today. Like regulators hid others asses gotten used smell view. Here's latest ranking states total per capita Northeast states still top first wave. lots states rising fast. example, Louisiana #5 moving up. 

And here's states ranked 7-day per capita deaths. Pretty heat map list gotten better treating since initial outbreak that's good news. would keeping eye hospital capacity going forward. Thats whole point-Sweden done none on-off lockdown-on,lockdown moves. incredibly consistent pandemic. Toronto Montreal undergoing 50% shutdown. Sweden strategy aim sustainable way life next year till 2022 so. 
 
Norway Denmark border lockdowns (and for) Sweden. hope many things change, lived damaging unsustainable: Total layman, overall data reinfections, looks effect invalidating adaptive immune response, beyond 10-20% produce low antibody levels.

I sure hope vaccines something differently. Everyone's economy shot pieces (apart handful Asian countries). NZ shot shit economy, virus 50k people watching rugby match masks week. 
Meanwhile Toronto, economy also shot shit, can't eat inside restaurant 7 months initial outbreak. would pick? would pick restaurant owner? President PUBLICLY stated RECORDED INTERVIEW Johnathan Swan, Australian Journalist, ""herd immunity work"" ""not plan"".

It's mindset. I‚Äôll never understand politicize mask wearing. country this. say ""out mess"", definitely much better position. already well past 100,000 week take account people get tested asymptomatic. American Crystal plants East Grand Forks Crookston, Minnesota, too. That's ""North Dakota"" problem. country doing? Italy went lockdown this? increase infected people began exponential growth early October. September 30, national trend followed pace settling much lower value first wave epidemic. Intensive care hospitals pain. However, October 1st, exponential growth began clearly never stopped reaching much higher values ‚Äã‚Äãthan first wave three weeks, today exceeding 19,000 new cases infections per day leading saturation intensive care.

The event health system withstand exponential growth long clear. change trend epidemic one day next, event necessary suddenly changed social behavior millions people. event happened week October 1st, event involved Italy. September 24, schools reopened six Italian regions, including populous Campania Puglia. others reopen 10 days earlier, 14 September. 20-21 September elections: 9 extra school days, least 4 lost. Considering departure slow due Covid, fact school restarted full speed around 24 September suddenly setting nearly eight million students move - exactly takes explain data.

The data data Civil Protection also confirmed data available Ministry Education relating school population. week 26 September - 3 October, rate growth infections teaching staff rest Italian population, non-teaching staff slightly higher (about 8%), students 36% higher rest population. following week situation changes drastically: rate growth infected among students 2.65 times (+ 265%) higher rest population, teaching staff exactly double (+ 200%), non-teaching staff 1.67 times (+ 167%) higher rest Italian population!

The amplifier reopening schools acted powerful amplifier contagion, necessarily due defects organization activities within school. Millions kids started dating regularly school buildings, taking effects habits, sports, transportation, extracurricular activities social habits. probably caused formidable amplifying effect which, starting young people, affects, order decreasing intensity, teachers school workers, people live several hours every day contact them, well as, obviously, rest society. dealing happens school, forgotten everything happens young people outside school put circulation devastating effects. October 1st, epidemic began rise quickly, doubling every 7 days, exceeding, October 23, 170,000 infected: week could exceed 300,000, two weeks could rise 600,000, absolutely unsustainable numbers. Yeah kinda hate OP saying cold.. fully winter MN. can't get damn ice driveway already.  Nah...that's far much nuance reddit thread.

Also believe covid19 originated Wuhan rural areas around it. midwest winter weather going away according lot research, might become yearly thing. Even vaccination. things frequently maintain high immunity:

Ain't daisy. ""post-pandemic world"" - Something phrasing, scares me. compare phrase ""post-worldwar"", really shows magnitude entire thing going think many (myself included) still can't fully grasp impactful history Clearly obvious cause many aren‚Äôt willing acknowledge. 
Too many tests. 


Help Jeebus, /s necessary. China ass! people unprotected oral sex even though catch diseases nastier Covid way. rest world?

You issue Cubans US. last checked, Cuba thriving economy since Batista era. Like told comment above, says Post-Pandemic anyone starts yelling infection fatality rate versus case fatality rate... positive test part CFR calculation, Not's math largely correct. I've kind surprised easy spreading less dense areas North Dakota. I've I'm kind baffled COVID spreads place like that. I'm Canada although we're great, areas resemble North Dakota hardly cases all.

The complete stupidity certainly explains lot. Ooooh ouch! need treat people terrorists, are. I‚Äôve heard too- don‚Äôt see rationalize all. asked Catholic client said thought Vatican shut mess US? huffed left. mean, Trump Melania got it... still want pretend it‚Äôs hoax, people getting sick dying world, countries shutting (destroying economies), make Trump look bad? It‚Äôs insane. Yes, does, even though think meant affects - either would apply.

On hand, report gazing crystal ball? says Post Post-Pandemic... Germany. Everything open now. went Italy Greece summer everything pretty normal well absolute earliest would start massive vaccinations Jan/Feb takes 30 days build antibodies. fucked. prolong pandemic? shorten pandemic. faster everyone gets sick faster herd immunity. yes Back hate-mongering then? national guard deployed testing, enforce isolation positive cases, ensure enforcement mask usage local PDs.

The fact many people think good idea military enforcing absolutely terrifying. That's point. Dakotans go tenth Hondurans simply move hundred miles left.  Pigs trough!! Uhm, lag make sure accurate. problem now? reddit see winning rona race? /s 

Cities far apart. big cities south, either way, big cities worst hit ones. Stockholm alone line half deaths. Right high 800s people dying.

Absolutely. top that, 18th among states based mortality per million, average USA. chilling, stay safe people blamed democrats delaying vote day two dems attempted ensure money would used effectively want risk getting infected know worth :)

You think US good scientists?

I follow news many experts interviewed working US hospitals universities Chinese Indians.

Have scientists China given wrong advice yet?

I know US experts said repeatedly there's need wear mask, carry living like normal even community spread confirmed.

Hell, US surgeon general even warned wearing mask may increased risk getting infected czechia, 10mil population, 15-20k daily cases now. Masks mandatory schools work? experts agree closed/badly ventilated spaces close contact constitute optimal condition virus spread. one things definitely know virus. 

And i've linked sub find nothing experts study inform yourself.

And right, is. live that, comment it. Absolutely not. important discussion mortality parents partner long time comes. poster admitted selfish correct. Many people simply enough time left ahead put life hold 12 months, especially original plan 2 weeks.

Obviously poster parent going restaurant location dine allowed. evidence dining restaurant risky activity, courts countries ruled closing restaurants/bars.

For us vast majority countries, risk dying COVID outside care home setting very, low. 'long term' effects really much concern one considers greater risk contracting cancer, long term side effects much worse, believe me.

I encourage discuss parents allow evaluate risk. many you, never deal anything difficult, many us lived lot more, faced mortality already. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

‚ÄúGet rid kids permanently‚Äù  Really don‚Äôt want part .14% population dies! Big numbers scare me. tf expect people must go work protect take extra precautions idiots like üòÇ getting weirdly satirical point. Like I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve interacted people love love back. It‚Äôs quite bizarre circular logic is. awesome virus free night dude. definitely ""hard"" families though. Families two parents work full time. Single parents. Children parents simply bother ensuring kids get education online classes. mention, know hard believe, everyone high speed internet. son's school district using school busses mobile hot spots different locations around town, every district kind resources. impact children (particularly lower income community) felt years come. difficult you, mean easy everyone. pushing away people religion even more. know dont give away personal information, im sure least twenty people would willing fill online response disgusted watching someone pick cake without mask on, thought store managers would protect us customers canceling order, instead let wanted. 

""And im taking business elsewhere.""

Y'know, case wanna. bad Italy spring store bodies temporary morgues, think Italy would one places lockdowns limit cases would support. Guess not. add this, lack political will, also big legal obstacles way. there's always week two delay actual current state epidemic observe data, government wanted truly control epidemic would take action way seems necessary. Restricting people's freedom way seems unnecessary hard justify legal perspective. may like comparison giving freedom safety textbook mean like traffic laws?

No, like national reactionary policy virus. disturbing, dead on. 9% new hospitalizations NM (+35 today). That's horrifying-we're less 1% US population Nope. can't read. Same, I'd rather avoid test quarantine doubt. There's much bone sinuses, causes problems mentioned. nose general problematic, point almost sensitive touch. never understood people seem soft noses press hard. Mine feels hard ready bleed lightest touch, happened.  So... everyone else?  Lots people follow rules. Just... sure exactly many. family will. It‚Äôs religion infect/kill others?  place hand bible 

and say masks catholic faith.

no. problem.

&amp;#x200B;

they use shit avoid getting vaccines (for measles even). seem missed point.

The smug ones telling people live. exactly problem. Well, see truth months anyways. think many people getting sick religious buildings churches. pray away way... Stay tuned. Economy relatively okay, unemployment rose 4.2% we're budgeted come covid lowest debt OECD. traffic Taipei HK, one case, one broke quarantine rules went wandering little peak HK? Yes remember one. 

We think everyone trying gang us. track whatever reported back that‚Äôs all, turns false positives. isolate test contacts anyway. Note non contacts tested positive, either PCR serology.

TBH never really believed local transmission all; masks still mandatory public transport. It‚Äôs we‚Äôve manage keep far. There‚Äôs point widespread testing positivity rate lower margin error. PCR positivity rate rises we‚Äôll expand testing.

It‚Äôs actually hard get test days even rules written look complicated. Whatever. 5-10 times worse neighbors. It‚Äôs terrible. That‚Äôs end story bro one succeeded yet.

If far succeeded eventually fail, Western countries did.

When NZ China Vietnam get zero cases extended period time, shows again, exactly think came from?

It eliminated. 

1. Hard lockdown get cases single-digits

2. Population-scale testing lockdown find isolate infected

3. Continuous monitoring wastewater (but level water treatment plant, level individual streets apartment blocks) random testing catch potential outbreaks develop, testing everyone again

It 100% doable it. problem would hurt financial interests current Western elite. That‚Äôs exactly Bluetooth system works well, nothing leaves phone unless authorized user. People needlessly paranoid issue based misunderstanding tech. Agree. NY asking Californians quarantine NY mess weirdest power play. Newsom fan managed much better California. wish though California imposed quarantine incoming folks. remember spring friends traveling NYC SFO asking wanted catch-up üôÑ Hey remember sub started information hub Covid American centric political circlejerk Americans spam wank again?

""Tibet exist""

""no, really pandemic here, let's kill doctor tries say otherwise"".""

Source? Worldwide average ridiculous comparison know it, EU+UK average around 400 compared Sweden's around 600. people know already voted. Sweden currently deaths higher infection rate two closest neighbors Norway Finland, saying correct. It‚Äôs gods plan, god bless please pass cocaine ‚ÄúBullshit politics‚Äù! Yeah, that‚Äôs right. Everything ‚Äúbullshit politics‚Äù it‚Äôs approved Folkh√§lsomyndigheten.  


There‚Äôs remarkable correlation Nordic countries ‚Äúbullshit politics‚Äù Nordic countries 10 times fewer deaths per capita Sweden.  


And ridiculous idea measures acceptable without change years. Didn‚Äôt notice soft ‚Äúlockdown‚Äú Nordic countries place month desired effect? 


Meanwhile Sweden strategy sustainable lifted measures supposed protect risk groups. September case numbers lowest, right seeing exponential increase. anything ‚Äúbullshit politics‚Äù. Taiwan never lockdown, maybe that's looking inspiration. well take long, already back ""Trending Poorly""  Could result strains resistant higher heat? federal government messed testing (test kits) really badly spent months ignoring downplaying virus, instead preparing it. Trump administration bears responsibility poor messaging co-ordination early months (and through-out). 

USA deaths per population 160% greater immediate neighbours, Canada. third worst developed nation world per capita deaths. 

There part response world would like borrow. says something. Doubtlessly similar, I'd argue Darwin's better transparently racist.

That last part, ""inferior less favoured race"" would suggest filled disdain animonsity existence reproduction sole exception earth-shattering thesis natural selection process determines survival life. us, though. long people get tested feel sick people use contact tracing app. last time Auckland went level 3 simply people complacent. capability capacity control virus without restrictions people get complacent. Yep. Way better response, that's New Zealander's perspective. keeping track home: US less cooperative Iraq, North Macedonia, Venezuela. MI RiGHts Correction: barely news US. Virtually everywhere else it‚Äôs quite prominent. Haha excellent edit. fact think links way relevant factual goes prove little really know. hey, keep believing bullshit, that's exactly expect good citizens like yourself. imagine think Chinese brainwashed, certain degree, shit Western media puts idiots lap disgusting. happy get travel world. really try it. wear condom fucking hooker, thanks, good know Texas Eh, Switzerlands politics 'ZomG teH ecOnOmy' focused everyone else's, maybe even politicians rely support powerful lobbies afraid pissing off. reason major events several thousands people allowed starting October 1st despite case numbers rising steadily.

Becoming? Jesus Christ, shit. 

We get already! Stop throwing American dumb ass non wearing mask faces! self congratulatory pushed cases one digit numbers anybody went private parties. Also, coming someone lives central Switzerland, mindset woes problems world somehow concern us hence precaution needed. Mental isolationism you. Welll given Corona. Deaths per million:

* Spain
* Belgium
* Italy
* UK

France pass Sweden deaths per million.

Cases per million:

* Spain
* Belgium
* France
* UK
* Portugal

Basically countries strictest lockdown measures passing Sweden deaths cases, contemplating new round lockdowns.

Does make seem efficient you? Aussie here. constution must different US constution nearly state borders closed point COVID. 

Our two largest states states community transmission moment state borders gradually reopened. International borders however, stay closed indefinitely. correct 50 people rule. became quite absurd consert, example, could legal people ate time, illegal without food served. one reason increase 300 certain event.

Regarding friends, live Stockholm live different city. lived city guess would met sometimes. You‚Äôre really copper, huh? evidenced slew (mostly outdated) articles subject. Copper used lot places anti microbial. works extent instant, still need take precautions (distance, wash hands, wear masks, minimize touching, etc) He's lucky far, senile old plum pulled mask cough days people, idea wear use mask safely. Nope, remember two weeks flatten curve. it. NZ first started shutting borders countries based covid spreading community country. one country targeted based criteria. mean needs place store boxes, amazon boxes stored finest locations. New Zealand shut borders USA. 40 countries shut borders USA.]

Y'all keep talking border closure really useful thing Trump did. govt sat hands months.

Sth Korea USA got first confirmed case day. South Korea set mass testing contact tracing mobilised citizens action. took USA months get testing running. time downplaying severity. endemic. late. Game over. Well, DIY version putting mask oven 60-70C 30 minutes. Many since early days epidemic. Well darn would figured? definition, contract tracing system owned operated government, want software.

In China anyone openly disagrees Gov declares quickly disappear.

Its called communist dictatorship True, pointed previous comment. *is* significantly country  Complaining social media privacy, yep, that's 5000 IQ stuff! TIL Americans pay covid testing.

After reading comments: TIL Americans pay doctor visits... I'm sorry already excellently made reusable respirators kinds: full face, half face, voice diaphragm, drinking spout (from canteen tube dipped water glass bottle), two eyeholes (that looks ""military"" scary) panoramic visors. market right mass production lines already exist correct filters, provide 99.9% filtration. filters, depending designs may last 6-12 months 

So what's point yet another mask, need battery mounted either body, head face (explosion risk). obstacle using real respirators ""you must mentally ill"" argument. I've never thought Russia part Europe simply East border Pacific Ocean. tend think thing, quintessentially Eurasian thing.

whaaaa? read Teton dam collapse SL-1 disaster, Idaho fucked things pretty bad can‚Äôt. people that. It‚Äôs problem. threatening fine restaurants cross checking data. it‚Äôs becoming bigger problem bigger cities Take look Sweden's current numbers daily deaths suddenly seems must something right. time goes stay course look increasingly better neighbors statistically. Yeah, colleague sent pictures took flooded roads Nha Trang move hotel several times. know Vietnam violent storm, always perfect weather there. 

I used read Thailand subreddits lot expats expressing surprise got away without much illness. must admit people terribly careful, although riding around scooter blazing sunshine risky covid's concerned. Also Chinese tourists, hotels cater empty overall tourist numbers way Phuket time. go main hospital island ongoing medical issue SOPs careful, KL. Soon left March island pretty much closed down, still afaik. Last week discussion careful, one relative argued getting high numbers testing hospitalization low. (lol)  


This Germany btw. Oh, nice rule 1 violation. dunno. claim excellent student, top class? first test Biden's lied about.

Ba-dum-tsss government still injecting large sums borrowed money make people feel like actually income. Define ‚ÄúBS‚Äù I‚Äôm willing wager essential supply chain way realize. don‚Äôt think would trust vaccine made USA right now...too many hands kitchen. New Zealand cluster Americold, frozen logistics company, cannot figure came back that, perhaps final piece puzzle. Honestly numbers probably comparable adjust obesity. False. Learn history. Sweden's king famously demanded country allow Germany invade Russia Sweden Norway. might want learn Operation Barbarossa [Midsommer Operation Barbarossa, 22 June 1941 German invasion Soviet Union, sparked ultimatum government Nazi Germany Hansson's cabinet demanding military concessions (including German troop transports Swedish railways support German ally Finland). political deliberations surrounding ultimatum become known ""midsummer crisis"", (allegedly King Gustav V's threat abdicate concessions made) resolved favor Axis. reputation may indeed take hit, pandemic yet.

The problem Sweden awhile international politics: We're used cudgel, cudgel swing many different directions know use it.

I think reputation survive pandemic, reputation worth preserving. said Iowa island............. said state's economy dependent economies states, including countries. What, expect Iowa thriving economy everyone else's tanks? understand basic economics? Restaurants business affected shut-down (lock-down whatever want call caused economies mostly come dead halt). Look retail bankruptcies!!!! caused lock-down/shut-down. mall traffic recipe business failure. Amazon thriving? people shopping home. Covid-19 exists pandemic say is, economic destruction totally needless. Yeah?

Already gearing drought Canterbury, Auckland still pretty dry too?

I'll take word though, worlds weather mess nearly zero deaths. know there‚Äôs lag deaths, keep checking every day, waiting spike. Trouble is, initial enforcement falls cashier wait staff whatever business visiting. I've handful folks (I'm grocery) want wear masks, we've never called law enforcement it. use customer service voices politely explain already know- mandated governor can't shop without one. Sometimes people shitty, viral-video-level meltdowns. agree, Apple &amp; Google bare minimum seems, expect usual privacy pushback slowed response. think saving lives important reassuring endlessly paranoid data integrity, thats world live guess. ‚ÄúbUT iNfRiNgEd rIgHtS fREedOmS‚Äù countries catchup up? It‚Äôs still like 17th worst whole world. Out. 214. Still bottom decile. Wake gets spitting distance average. Ain‚Äôt ever going happen Haha, afraid what. Afraid saying fuck Winnie afraid saying ccp go hell. exactly think can't say.

Here's little bit advice, actually know talking maybe say anything. That's fall one limited categories travel Australia moment


Australia‚Äôs borders closed. people travel Australia are:

Australian citizens

residents

immediate family members

travellers New Zealand previous 14 Could result super strains? matches - takes bit time mask mandates see difference. It‚Äôs lagging indicator. mask mandates came effect weeks later, precipitous drop covid cases. Masks prevented massive number new infections. think ‚Äúderived from‚Äù meant basically grinding foetuses make treatment???

I seen exact take Reddit, every time headline hits front page, basically represented every top comment, attempt dig Trump conservatives hypocritical. 

But based objective cells used development treatment, mate; there‚Äôs 2 ways slice it.

I really really really need read link waste time again.

The fetal cells part separate experiment ***from 1973*** referenced - even necessity - point production Regeneron.

Read link admit wrong, reply again. Certain politicians saying supposed 2.5 million dead things going great! Yeah, 2.5 million dead one anything different, still going cruises packing stadiums wearing masks social distancing even local level, people dissuaded large number dead people overwhelmed hospitals stop going out. one also much larger started earlier, makes sense take get results others. Leadership counts, though. Trump promoting mask wear people would it. FYI, still happening across entire swath United States, med staff want avoid panic, patients disinformed point they'll go different doc. would anybody downvote comment? make law, people follow it.

Not teeth.

If punishment, reason follow law. mask, full conflict. consideration, I've taken liberty making sure regret it. uncle 74. caught family funeral back August. COPD, diabetes, heart patient. lives alone went days coughing fits fevers daily 100 range.  12 brutal days, without medicine hospitalization, fever broke he's fine.  Stay positive one mate. What‚Äôs basis exemption? borders porous Rochester, NY stake. Yes, read article too, said get reasoning. upvoted comment accurate agreeing porous border, illegal border crossing unheard of. Well, guess thing left study find HCQ benefit patient dies COVID-19.  /s wish. get every single thing want life government? No. always going satisfied matter are? No. never ever ever disillusioned, felt alone own, frightened angry involved, administration. 

What question? Experts say it‚Äôs unlikely poor air quality effect keeping case counts low.

I know rest state, Bay Area, weeks people staying fires. Maybe large effect already good masks, effect. Sounds like board agrees folks Idaho stupid live. 

So bother enforcing laws all. say Europe, said progressive ones. Nordics well northern mainland liberal attitudes towards euthanasia end life care. Without specifics Sweden cases (we know nursing homes got hit) doctor felt COVID untreatable, see issue palliative care. What? already 2000 day earlier year. opinion credible top doctors mine formed from. America first line can't comprehend willingness jump nosefirst somebody elses business like that.

And yet, are.  France hands down, even close. u/I405 would proud previous comment. That's convey sarcasm via text without ""/s"". context right otherwise person's message left completely open interpretation... got careful parent-level comments.

No fault anyone, nature text based communication.

edit: Hold up, realized previous comment good example. could easily mistake someone know fucking thing Poe's law maybe doubter who's lazy google. 

Without clarification everything open interpretation via text. sarcastic first comment Poe's law striking sarcastic accurate. I'ma cough face then. called consideration. matter think. can't consider me, prepare conflict.  opinion probably credible Ok, record, Illinois developed separate test - different enough FDA approved rn lol. done before, awesome. take test results within 24 hrs Ahh-gREEDD It‚Äôs unlikely police department could match current salary, would particularly interested hiring someone 40s law enforcement credentials experience. 

But police officer gets pick choose laws mandates enforce bad judge doesn‚Äôt interpret laws impartially court. 

Both would failure criminal justice system; failed criminal justice system reformed replaced. Humans virus. Nothing left wait til we're eradicated. They're supposed nostrils. also article : ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bible expert anything, Jesus kind loving generous thinks others advocate marginalized doesn‚Äôt align saying I‚Äôm going wear mask,‚Äù Burns said. Putting hospital patients nursing homes seems like big risk, even med/surg patients tested negative asymptomatic, nursing home population vulnerable. I'm still level obsession March April, definitely checking often again. nurse said this? Sheer ignorance  wins president January.  wtf fact Sweden ranks 17th deaths per million spite low population density small population size would unacceptable Sweden. know limited terms could also think could lot firmer messaging avoid anti-lockdown shills waving around example constantly. someone finished spout covid- please people get damn vaccine comes out. want go did. absolutely miserable still feel like never back 100% how'd get test scheduled? specifically since i'm gonna within month. Kinda sounds like conflict interest me.  in: sun warm, water wet. 11. Experts say positive rate closer 5% know enough testing capture good picture spread start knocking might reconsider consequences actions. Consideration dying I'll happy follow suit. agree that, need better. done better spring summer better now. I'm sick people suggesting gone low Europe literally trying avoid. want spikes, avoided spikes staying consistent. pandemic fatigue really going screw us though, pretty clear. Experts say positive rate closer 5% know enough testing capture good picture spread seem two camps among us Christians. cram megachurches continue spread virus, rest us shake heads try beg first camp stay home.

There's even verses Gospels Devil tells Jesus try throwing cliff, *surely* angels allow get much scratch. Jesus' reply? ""Don't tempt God.""

So that's Camp #2 Christians trying point Camp #1. Jesus said go around tempting God throwing cliffs/doing stupid things assuming get miraculously rescued. 

But no. God, country, 'Murica! 

Most time, get shut people like point formerly lifelong atheist (like kind slur) I'm also...*gasp*...a *scientist*...and use sort argument understand Deep State killing Church something, get Bible (that read). ever answer whole ""don't tempt God"" thing directly, though.

All say Christians home, social distancing, we're pretty liberal minded. Christianists/Christian Nationalist Evangelicals different breed (I know sounds dangerously close ""No True Scotsman"" fallacy, want know we're insane. :( I'm hoping get functional vaccine comes that. justthenews.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

They've two weeks deaths worth COVID deaths, total deaths 2020 among lowest history country.

To speculate whether particular strategy (or ""gamble"" call want make sound bad) paid yet entirely premature. choose, absolutely say Sweden's response among best.

Objectively, Sweden far better position country Europe now, since far larger portion country immune. ""high death rate"" also came significantly lower IFR country saw time period, every death brought closer herd immunity others. US shit internet access big telecom companies fought treating like utility fought cities providing own. R party helped.

Doctors COVID ICU Masks Work I'm sorry can't come terms fact states schools open well, states schools closed well, pointing schools open closed end many cases state has.

Seems like gotten panties bunch. would suggest getting riled up. [Oh look, Umair guy shit ever since May literally one listening point

anyway let's actually something fight climate change prove wrong agree you. seen large social gatherings justified okay attendees everyone wearing mask. think may huge problem Utah. 
Some counties hard-core anti-mask (Utah county) areas amazingly pro-mask (Salt Lake City). Large gatherings ended Utah .... cases exploding. Social distancing used sham. Sorry, know many sub saw panacea problem, one piece complicated puzzle keeping controlled. piece puts vast majority onus individual people, recipe disaster. look successful nations, like South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, people *freer* compared nations now. Why? governments stepped *other* interventions early on, able control without relying solely people.

Politicians everywhere, whether liberal, conservative, socialist, whatever, pretended handling situation patching orders simply do... nothing. March knew would never last length pandemic. knew people's wills strong. June, reason many people latched answer, blaming anti-lockdown Republicans instead continuing demand government actually *do* something. **The truth is, played yet elites tricked turning instead demanding outcome-changing action government. calls 20 million tests/day ended early April, colleges/private entities incentives stay open clearly showed testing large populations 1-2x weekly, mandating masks, establishing quarantining accommodations 100% possible.** posting memes people masks noses demanding governments establish widespread mass testing programs countries, mandate masks (and encourage use), build comprehensive contact tracing programs. dismantled economy cannot exist conditions repurposed economy exists prevent COVID employing millions people.

I'll say again, social distancing sham. get widespread vaccine well 2021, Americans Europeans simply willing stay put holidays. Winter actually coming time (fuck DD, gotta throw one last time :)), demanding dramatic action government take pressure citizens, frankly task. see ;) Thank God we've got enlightened centrist inform us American left Oh man, look beat they're born fast, they? broken blood vessels eye huge case conehead curled ears. also HUNGRY hubbub haha. thought may jaundiced eat; ran labs nope. pigged much want food almost day.

Does fat orange traitor know fracking means, millions dollars pockets/offshore tax haven(s) admiring admirers.?  Eighth place deaths per 100,000.

Plus, testing kids got quarantine symptom free (meaning quarantined roommate/close contact tested positive). ran isolation housing they‚Äôre sticking sick kids gym, equipped shitty little cot tablecloth blanket. 

Nobody even knows report problems to, either. See someone breaching quarantine? Get sick weekend student health center closed? one idea tell. It‚Äôs nuts. don‚Äôt know draw line university‚Äôs faults GOP anymore. 

Long winded way saying it‚Äôs around demoralizing. Everything, every single level, fucked. criteria, would require Herbert‚Äôs approval, patients getting worse despite receiving intensive care would moved first. event two patients' conditions equal, young get priority old, since older patients likely die.

Agreed. Sorry, Trump go source COVID-19 information. ""rounding turn third wave"" looks like, when, reality, never got fuck wave 1. ticked 250,000 deaths US COVID-19. good job Trump administration, they're handling matter exemplary verily assures re-election. 

/s

Trump take lash every dead American. want turn country shithole, going dealt such. Fuck Trump family, they're evil, complicit people care themselves. lot people got worried recent jump cases NZ meant they‚Äôd admit even NZ beat this. They‚Äôre going heavily push news ego reasons. We're lucky get highs 40s right great plains. supposed get 20s tomorrow see house jumping pass it. keep watching CNN chanting rEpUblicans bad. person history talking bullshit. need engage . baby born almost fast. came black blue barreled vagina. catch one handed came fast. 10 still slowed down.  I've wondered this. Thank answering burning question! Well, get group people properly bubbled hang out. problem one willing ""only"" see one two friends literally one else. Think family units. thing done people get social needs met well... people stupid groups leadership direct this... either seclude entirely say fuck it. doesnt seem between.

Edit. secluded group. Cause would rather miss friends year next year. year after. survive species. plan one individuals, too. warm liquid goo phase? next? think people done. Politicians literally take care people. There‚Äôs plenty blame sides shows failures two party state. difference Beligium Sweden Belgium herd Reddit warriors trying ~~protect~~ spread ~~glorified~~ misinformed, false ""Image Belgium"" trying argue 66% old people younger people died literally anything covid? Come on. Yeah. read reinfection rare. 2 months since recovery. country. Lately, lot cases reinfection even 1 month recovered. live Indonesia btw. 
So using 1 kn95 layered surgical masks effective?
I dont even know got infected first place. used 2 masks never eat outside home. mandated wear mask while.  –Ñ135 fine first offense, like –Ñ1500 second. sure third...of course actually enough police enforce it. ""The Republicans completely poisoned well this.""

Some, like OH governor DeWine, seem honestly trying bring people senses. right overall, there's really pervasive belief things ""that bad"" ""accomplished goals flattening curve"" good chunk conservative friends family subscribe to. sister-in-law actually posted incredibly optimistic nonsense day, basically declaring accomplished goals what's happening expected things moving back towards 'normal'. I'm normally pretty diplomatic person, let's say wife may slightly torched bridge lol. sister-in-law ""things fine"" train since April. Naturally person voting Trump pro-life. build sinusoidally... basing opinion fact, showed promise I'd little bit open changing mind.

Oh, like every neighbouring country way better it‚Äôs due obscure effects done absolutely nothing prove? Sure. You‚Äôre grounded facts. 

I believe we‚Äôre done here. want actually show evidence insane opinion Sweden hasn‚Äôt terribly compared rest Scandinavia, feel free. think clear anyone half brain need shut again.

And think, could done like us Korea avoided lockdown altogether completely inept politicians asshats citizens. takes 99%+ mask compliance proper social distancing. part confuses you?

Comparing cases deaths looks like uptick cases accompanied uptick deaths.

Also, see 80% cases virtually asymptomatic: Correct. Republicans refused President care.

That's lack leadership. problem system.  businesses means close indefinitely without going under. Close whenever starting prak again, outside able stay open precautions course.  anyone give ELI5 virus affecting infants blood type thing? Agreed. Utterly ridiculous. We‚Äôve established strategy Sweden chose caused majority 10 times higher per capita death rate. 

How so? linked study doubt read think draw conclusion. nothing linear regression makes assumption Denmark's curve hospitalizations, ICU patients deaths would followed Sweden lenient measures. makes attempt prove measures Sweden implemented account difference deaths. way around, rudimentary assumption entire paper difference deaths due difference social distancing measures implemented.

Need even add authors epidemiologists paper peer-reviewed? Children men I'll repeat ... 

Lockdowns alone point. supposed bridge increased capacity testing, tracing PPE distribution. countries succeeding. ones locked re-opened like suffering massively.

Even without lockdown, Sweden failed ramp kind surveillance institute widespread masking. compounded failure. think people think gone.

Here's think, worth:

People tired covid. want live like 2019. want masks. want see families friends large groups. want go movie, fly somewhere, travel, whatever. 

If claim gone, things, perhaps think people understand they're coming from, worst think they're ignorant. say ""the virus still I'm wearing mask anymore"" they'll labelled selfish piece shit. 

So better moronic ignorant? selfish piece shit? Fyi people saying ""it's schools""

NPR published article recently discussing little evidence school openings make difference. spain instance, they've seen change. also enforce social distancing measures much rigidly states.

The real culprit seems people giving shit able give shit government support efforts quarantine need feed families. cunty response. could stabilized curfews meaningful impact. Time tell...  decided weeks ago Thanksgiving Christmas would household family. decided early could break news everyone ahead time. Seems like made correct choice here. say largely aerosol spread, others (me included) say aerosols less 20%. However, Japan's CCC strategy looks bit like working (in different cultural context, though). course, would also curb fomite droplet transmission quite effectively.
From spectacular events, AC could play underestimated role, never confirmed large-scale TTI data, least knowledge.

There virologists claiming large droplets containing much virus, someone would cough directly someone, completely ignoring non-aerosol droplet production speaking saliva sensitivity PCR tests' cycle counts.

Fomite transmission likely cases (2nd known transmission Webasto Germany, NZ quarantine case, Chinese mall...), experts dispute significant role. Lab data place, known virologists claiming hours survival max reality, others seeing weeks room temperature, Chinese saying relevant frozen surfaces days.

Some virologists say large superspreading events drive epidemic, people infectious time. sparse TTI stats point large underground sporadic transmission family work, however.

Any effects require different strategy emphasis efforts daily life, one adhere measures attention, always tradeoff demands life containment rules. sure can't think least [one Swedish Internet Defence Force goes great lengths seven proxies back look like worldwide search results spiking lol, maybe still intensely butt hurt Sweden ^for^some^reason ordinary citizens Sweden care protecting image online. [Svenska that. Everyone trying support and/or family. case oil workers, making decision trade short term financial stability family long term instability hundreds millions families. may well include children seem biggest polluter countries get shit together time halt momentum climate change. Supporting family reason job exonerate responsibility end result job. 

The staff concentration camps families. soldier commits ethnic cleansing family. men ran slave trade families. Sex slave traffickers families. doubt many told things. 

""I need take care family job it. I'm bad person. Maybe personally anything people. Maybe think they're subhuman harming bother me. Whatever case, I'm following orders."" canceling Thanksgiving Christmas family gatherings year. spread right seems driven small family gatherings. 

The sad thing many vulnerable older family members - line risk getting sick year risk missing last holiday together age illness. saying done better, wonder population density affects infection ratios. Thanks. - found updated version that's missing merge data. Although, government response index somewhat arbitrary, could easily labeled ""fake news"". 

And, even simplified merge two, suspect already much data graphs bulk people digest dissuade erroneous views. Lockdowns alone point. supposed bridge increased capacity testing, tracing PPE distribution. countries succeeding. ones locked re-opened like suffering massively.

Even without lockdown, Sweden failed ramp kind surveillance institute widespread masking. compounded failure. good you? 3 generation households really common France. frequent contacts weekend are. childcare grand parents uncommon. I've read wrong... thanks data tell us smaller percentage people hospitalized dying - people defending Trump's inaction point support idiocy, good thing, continues spread people hospitalized still near 1,000 deaths per day end sight Also reminds certain RATM song beginning 2021 im pretty sure covid go third last wave.

id take oxford vaccine anytime now. even small risk, may way less covid itself.

though im wondering would happen someone already covid gets vaccine want life normal again, want able travel, rate one going let US citizens back country going perpetually infecting one another.

WEAR FUCKING MASK, HARD

If stubborn would've woods MONTHS ago God, depressing. Stupid, narcissistic people. getting it.

Maybe send entire global economy back Vietnam Era tens millions died starvation safer!

The UN food report says less 6 months global risk starvation doubled 125M 250M.

Last year 125M 10M actually died starvation. miss feel meals food insecurity like worst case scenario west. living $1.50/day actually starving. didn‚Äôt say anything different did. Never used word lockdown. Don‚Äôt bloody sensitive ones? could said Europe one point anymore. left Asian countries.

How governments adjust? didn't. firmly rooted culture collectivism mask wearing around decades. Businesses reopened couple weeks, Korea's GDP dropped percent 2nd quarter. need huge response people automatically. school busdriver online shared article said fauci could kiss something would ""caught dead"" mask on... somehow person serious poor choice words. think every American's warmonger? point China official, government-sponsored ways get tested?

Do understand difference? One government efficient also private tests side. government inefficient lot people, Costco test may first opportunity get tested without resorting lying get test.

If seriously can't tell difference two, best stop right here. Damn take people work together? Edited comments again? Mad? I'm sorry. Stay safe. It‚Äôs simple! kids, especially normal weight, healthy active kids, risk Coronavirus much better normal school. kids need socialization, education physical activity. feel guilt sending school. 100k monday bet 'expert' quoting take advise 'go away heat him'. [How feels right Looking various studies done spike depression people general, would say yes, Biden likely get exact drug cocktail Trump got. logic pretty flawed. Wow, state half ICU beds less sixth population. I'm little salty Idahoans refused follow public health guidelines hometowns, want send sick fill hospitals people sacrificed largely followed public health guidelines. (I'm also little salty bc cities host denigrated certain politics.)

Whatabout PERSONAL Responsibility? road trip Idaho zero people wearing masks, stopped gas even employees wearing masks. can't people put 1 1 together realize states highest covid rates lowest mask compliance ? Check Google trends BLM.

Its gone fast appeared. Odd. almost organic all.

I've seen paid advertising campaigns organic feel. know: likely far enough nose get proper result.

You supposed go alllll way back. Fyi Illinois test separate Yale test (it developed house U I) 8-yo daughter syndrome news needed read... Everything tells lockdowns wearing masks save lives. Yet US president done many things limit effectiveness lockdowns use face masks.

He rebels death psychotic. Honest question, isn‚Äôt kind terrible way kick road? business trying enforce code, ultimately going fall someone essentially wage-slave fighting every idiot member public. think lets folks employed enforce law easy. I‚Äôm grocery store employee, much agree mask wearing I‚Äôm trying get stabbed right-wing loony $8/hr CDC months behind almost every key recommendation start. shame ton incredible talented knowledgable people working there, they're clearly pressured politicians. Spoken like someone family depending livelihood lives ivory tower realize millions people edge financial desperation. really bit surreal seeing global numbers go up, we're single digit daily numbers (and states, effective elimination) glad Victoria bowing pressure business anti-lockdown people making sure cautious reopening liberals talked covid American. Straight up. mean real COVID-19 rapid tests. problem temperature checks sort unscrupulous parents give fever reducer prior dropoff, becomes school's problem. Lots schools daycares temperature checks dropoff prior COVID-19 super common way bypass them. teachers say ""Thank you!"" /s That‚Äôs instructions giving, would go that.

In clinic go much deeper. insert like way nose, level swab go back bit more. tell people: put swab nostril till make face swirl around times. worry, see turn around soon pretty funny see.

It reminds of: Trump fascist tyrant

Also leftists: federal government pass stricter gun control. taking blood test? reliable? would assume tested regularly. need daily update says ""no news."" I‚Äôm sure. People seized upon trick treating...a mostly outside, fairly socially distanced activity already...as main spread factor? would like see source well. Im sure physical barrier mask provides offers protection I‚Äôve always impression spread-prevention real benefit mask wearing. 30% seems awfully high that‚Äôd awesome true KN95s approved FDA EUA: come anti-fake test verify batch received made manufacturer. 10-14 days Thanksgiving going wreck lot people's holiday season. good news another reason stop, ticket possibly arrest POC. key wearing biggest mask you‚Äôve ever seen Thank God Then, wait months? wait 5/10 years really syre vaccines side effects? old lady escalade

Does ANYWHERE require masks worn vehicle? ""I feel"" problem here, though. read exactly long vaccine trials type vaccines developed usually take, long took now, difference length statistically means. would know, instead feel. trials already going longer six months (including earliest stage 1), another six months statistically mean much. think matter ethics, matter time. Long term studies effects vaccine impossible rushed.  i've mental health months ‚Äú goes away heat‚Äù true maybe 6 mos tops goes widespread. know side effects 10-12 mos longer road. also know long natural immunity might last. might make sense take antibody test skip vaccine altogether shows antibodies. asked question? doctors nurses attempted suicides take anymore.

I imagine like soldiers watch comrades die battle field... can't even imagine kind devastating psychological impact people. :( I've work recently places even care masks 2 meter social distancing, anything going right general continuing like normal surprised would assume

I'm going stop right  can‚Äôt afford too... clearly value money people. I‚Äôm done arguing. don‚Äôt care lives community, get it! Greed operate, matter human cost. Go angry people want stay alive healthy somewhere else. also.  One friends (big berly hairy guy) walked starbucks without mask on, intentionally totally spaced it. said never seen reaction people like life. employees huddled together creeped toward corner scared death! told wasnt robbing place wanted coffee lol. Biden can't even guarantee survival next weeks. short, people current US administration cares (the ultra-wealthy) could suffered. instead, swift inaction made even wealthier. Sturgis symptom people live states. took corinavirus seriously never would allowed Sturgis happen.


I‚Äôm sure correct many cases stem there. unwise think literally entirety global brainpower would willing collectively toss ethics window. Scientists make vaccines, appointed politicians. No, active last 2 weeks.

1 88 people 2 weeks absolutely insane. Honestly jealous people who‚Äôve go living normal lives. get tested once, sometimes twice week. PCR anterior nasal swab, administered myself. It‚Äôs totally invasive all. Put q-tip nose 1 inch swirl around times. daughter 14 gets tested weekly well. test too! It‚Äôs really big deal all. outdoor market veryone wearing mask certainly relevant problem. relevant enough posted here? friend mine also tested negative months ago. would fit better USA Sub wealthy people give fuck anything boredom

Not sure accept answer different topic. But, one blame I've frequently read members Extinction Rebellion (climate activists) exactly that, relatively well-off. bit ironic left demanding stricter mask enforcement by.... Police!

The police spent months saying hate Why‚Äôs always single individual? Anti Vaxxers exist long Trump. don‚Äôt go away even Trump goes away. Keep eyes news next 4-5 weeks so. get significant vaccine news Christmas I'd start worry right. 1 14, dear God. sounds horrible. No, transparent leadership looks like. fair even aunt biologist studies coronavirus mice said worry it. Ok think person rough.
I‚Äôve gotten tested twice done nurse like trying scrape brain. Even friend said tougher tests she‚Äôs gotten. Also q-tip much thicker second got done. feel comment. feelin march thought gag obvious: would hoax fool people dying en masse? Parents also avoiding going hospital keep numbers low too! So

ah. go great. I'll call name next time :) would like able socially distance intensely I'm currently family (some high risk) feel way, yeah I'll take fucking vax us choose get lives. I'll take fever, headache permanent organ damage Covid day. 6'?

The average height US men 5'9""

The pro mask people usually shorter average so... remember biking Moab &amp; shocked learn losing virginity cousin thing Utah. snark intended, &amp; likely, perhaps locals shittin‚Äô me. Countries ahead Sweden many quickly catching lol talking , it'll end prolonging pandemic

A lot people think far, apparently.   Honestly sometimes it‚Äôs hard tell. many people still cling idea it‚Äôs overblown hoax, ‚Äúfear porn‚Äù make masses compliant, something. know people *still* insisting go away right election. cancer rates going stay amount people roughly although might miss diagnosis cancer die it, let covid snowball control amount dying FAR higher, 

so even percentage lethality low 60, allow covid go unchecked small percentage massive base amount easily run total cancer deaths, plus keeping Healthcare workers safe huge priority,

Should also mention fact even pose lethality risk younger people still great potential long term damage them, leaving exposed possible risks road? could fatal left unchecked meaning repercussions could felt years later causing long term strain hospitals etc

youre saving lives long run allowing Healthcare systems collapse , theres triage Scientists charge anything buddy. They're advisors Tens thousands people less year worth study nothing compare billions people side effect 10-20 yrs road.

People need convinced risk getting COVID outweigh risk vaccine side effect Damn angry right must hard realize ‚Äúcivilized Europe‚Äù cases per capita ‚Äú3rd world shithole‚Äù. Lmfao dumbfucks. Aside architecture, really great city. Louvre membership find relaxing empty tourists. people rude full micro-aggressions, city dirty petty crime alarmingly high. I've visited lot places Europe pretty far list favorite cities. visiting week (like city) might enjoyable, live quite tough.  STDs never stopped hookup culture, would virus that's relatively harmless young people change that?

Relatively course want get covid, preferable Hep C antibiotic resistent gonorrhea. shit Sherlock That's kinda sad think turn away business. OK selling beer 12 year old?

Ahh yes that's thing! so? simplify. Half Americans selfish people fucking planet. ‚Äúfuck got mine‚Äù attitude rampant here. Imagine attitude WWII Americans asked sacrifice much home, war abroad. agree! Holy fuck, fuck morons!  hypotheticals? fuck about. news rife accounts Police Sheriff departments refusing enforce mask orders. 

That's like saying enforce jay walking parking tickets. 

Are cop? evidence plain day- even national mask mandate legislation, conservative communities won‚Äôt enforce it.

You seem think enforcible first place. widespread way.

You realize crime significantly many cities?

Why would police, spent months demonized leftists want become ticket writers masks?

That's tone deaf idiotic policy. Actually, no. vast majority people keep touch really accepted this. loud minority making country look like know follow science, compassion, selfless.

The lack coordinated response, consistent messaging leadership, support government states problems reside states. Covid fatigue set pretty hard across US I'd also say people still really appetite consistently go crowded places maskless behaviors enhance risk.

This winter going suck, states either maintaining case loads increasing we're getting colder weather holidays. crazy we're spending time country battling piece cloth figuring take care other. Also true Well hell. Imma go get Covid now!!! Don‚Äôt need kids... hahah Another 5 months we're Covid-19 gone endemic, especially rate mutation coronavirus.

Sorry, letting virus burn forest put fire, it'll perpetually burning fire. Yes need data make definitive claim one made. cannot make whatever want believe, even suits popular narrative. doubt much cover local officials order top report cases. ""Sunday"" anything it?

I'd guess they're referring fact lot places, case reporting spotty (i.e. fewer cases reported) weekends, especially Sundays. 

Although France, looks like that's case, lower reporting days typically Mondays. Saturdays appear 'peak' reporting days literally pay keep us safe so... really reason get tested everyone household gets sick....you know is. Lol no, means family support large gatherings, course requirements obligations get tested report health condition government; different?


I understand trying make sense confusing time statement several others wrong. know patients report infectious diseases they're healthcare provider test center report cases. Read information: true covid-19. Local, State hopefully federal government want know disease spreading. ignored earlier statement, spread happens know sick.

And hopefully drive home, sensible person get sick see doctor. doctor run tests. test come back positive doctor obligated report local health department. We're supposed sensible people do. true whether covid, measles blood poisoning.  They're ignoring rules en masse many states.  exact number? Sorry struggling this. government absolutely right tell state must require anything all. state always be. Comparing pants murder whatever straw think change anything difficult comprehend. Australia we‚Äôre still freaking keeping restrictions there‚Äôs 10 cases day. Across world, probably 2022. developed countries like US, probably spring 2021. I‚Äôve met many amazing French individuals. France, stay safe!!! 

Cr√®vec≈ìur üíî Trump backing science Fauci split people. Ofc going control pandemic. don‚Äôt know fomites vector all, they‚Äôre nowhere near efficient airborne transmission Yeah. Outside. Two weeks gonna really bad. Weekend numbers usually lower week days, thats mean Cdc, etc say droplet. getting airborne? said likely, means greater 50% please ask get bullshit? 
I Czech self deploying army againt citizens...

Yes,there buch idiots anti masks,but still army! knew would happen, people care collectively. already past verge. Governor Rona DeathSentence reduced testing reporting. Well hawaii small isolated island less third population NZ, Hawaii 7 times cases 8 times deaths. families traumatizing children ain‚Äôt bro. 

If come country illegally, kind thing happens. 

Hint: try enter country people brought virus country American citizens returning lawfully I‚Äôm sure understand point.

Do always make statements fact unprovable? True form, French surrendered virus. meant conservatives really believe coronavirus hoax things like happening around us. mistakenly thought clear.

(But thx link.) important realize chart combining 50 charts tell different stories. That's part clear ""waves"".

Waves would lot clearer everyone dealt pandemic equally (and hit everywhere time). state hit different times dealt situation differently. competition. find number staggering easy downplay 20,000 country 80,000 cause easy forget population size. sure quick anger. Deaths lowest since June Herman Cain? seems like case first person die horror movie Black guy Masks mandatory though througout US. don‚Äôt think people allowed go stores without wearing anywhere spent time living there, everything mentioned true, think issues moment. 

Imo issue Swiss governence conservative ( original sense word, favoring slow moving deliberated change ). Asian countries even fellow European countries like Spain Ireland fairly decisively instruct people live restrictions lock quickly - really Swiss way.

Trust individual responsibility huge deal, worked quite well Switzerland now. left difficult respond rapidly developing crisis like however Sorry person, March 23rd Boris Johnson said people stay home 661 five day average new cases

The number confirmed cases extremely limited testing capacity, people ICU tested. testing outside hospitals mid-may. Estimates place number new cases around 100,000 week leading l nice Never say ""white people"" around white people, bring race form. makes uncomfortable I‚Äôm misleading. topic though. surge hit Florida, large amount people sub insisting would pretty much Florida beat surge. comments suggesting otherwise voted down. promise different. Denmark practically closed (it quiet), could see Sweden open.

Wait, traveling Stockholm Copenhagen time? national level, Sweden dipped -20% movement Denmark, Norway Finland dipped -30% movement. quickly went Swedens levels (and Denmark even traveled normal).

But check 2nd link, Stockholm Gothenburg also dipped -30%. sounds like curiosity failure anything else. information, reasoning, science public information easily accessible. go ahead keep view reality. Can't wait see practical applications come fruition. need it? circlejerk anyone goes public place crowds indoors gets it. Everyone accusing misinformation throws studies either admit ""not enough data"" ""using CDC's data"" worthless horseshit me.

But whatever, go on, believe whatever wanna. I've it, kids fear irrational crazy me. honestly histronics thread, give fuck Americans do. What's trust? Everyone's daily life basically back normal people traveling sorts touristy stuff repercussions.  want tax dollars going toward medical treatment. know you, definitely want wait see doctor you, want spend money services family me. like better medical treatment, make money. problem difficult make mandatory testing European countries. Slovakia trying moment making test mandatory imposing quarantine participate. guess China asked test it. Luxembourg tried mass testing since June failure probably partly due incomplete participation rate. No, saying would rather live US somewhere locks 7 cases highly unlikely die. implication saying one lock down. certainly imply anything 50% mortality rate. sad likely die covid. said healthy demographic less .1% fatality rate It‚Äôs still first wave. also enough folks it, bound superspreaders Responding question numbers:
The exact amounts may differ depending source. It‚Äôs trends concern me, combined potentials, exacerbated Character-in-Chief. 

As Saturday night: 224,000 dead, 8,540,000 cases (WaPo). ~3%. 2.623% matters. don‚Äôt know real totals right administration OPEN efforts suppress real numbers (another right wing tactic -suppress information).
Add related deaths, ‚Äúexcess‚Äù it‚Äôs called, far insane numbers extrapolating out. mention well documented lingering, serious after-effects may well fatal cases.

So. fear mongering. Perhaps. face reality true Zombie Apocalypse upon us, combined studied (I hesitate use word conjunction Trump Co) indifference administration REFUSING anything substantive SAVE US!! ...commence string expletives... sure seem like making generalizations European countries this, failing containing virus. different approach, let‚Äôs hope works. beginning, Slovakia progressive European countries fighting corona, early strict mask wearing mandate saved lot lives. maybe something. I‚Äôm Slovak, live USA. wish Slovakia, seem handling well far. Fingers crossed, wishing best there. Land borders easy control airports.

China's northwest (Central Asia), northeast (Russia) southwest (Myanmar, Vietnam etc.) quite porous.  53 year old man died yesterday front biggest university hospital country due COVID directly, due able receive treatment kidney stomach ulcer problems hospital filled much virus cases :(

I go fight virus mask deniers honor man. forget him. need mandate anything people right thing willingly.

WTF fantasy pulling lingo from, haha.  also doesn‚Äôt help many us *don‚Äôt choice*. work two food service jobs right now, days facing public 12-14 hours. home rest time. would love risk, put others risk, government can‚Äôt support us think going eat important. evidence busy locations, given circumstances. I‚Äôm trapped constant cycle wanting anyone leave house *needing* make money to, ya know, survive. Automod seemed think reply ""purely political removed (????), let's try again. intentional misspellings dashes here, because... apparently said something purely political? Idk...

So, personal experience (which admittedly flawed way looking things). Wh-ite Evang-licals Chritians there, ones vociferously tie together politics faith. hear rest us we're causing problems, lol.

Then again, like said, personal anecdote. original point first comment we're crazy, mega-church attending, COVID superspreaders. us *are* sane trying *desperately* get superspreader types. working, we're still trying.

On note, sad use Jesus' words make point people... ignore it. J-sus returned ran current leader, they'd still vote Tr-mp. frightening. NY still downward trajectory. uptick. sure others. And, preempt misinformation spread, economic downturns always hit urban working poor hardest, areas particularly hard hit. disturbing. guess cross Paris bucket list now. replying thread Australia. funny think backward country lol. ‚Äú...an entire generation...‚Äù 

I understand potential long-hauler cases, understand potential long-term, chronic effects. don‚Äôt understand probability/likelihood entire generation become disabled due viral exposure. Assuming u/rebeltrillionaire referring youth yet enter workforce, evidence global concern isn‚Äôt considered world leaders? 

I elementary-age children. opted keep virtual January, rest friends community. take virus seriously. Without getting anecdotal evidence, understanding us either asymptomatic experience flu-like symptoms span around week. part flatten curve reduce spread best interest greater good vulnerability particular virus.

I glean information Johns-Hopkins, WHO, CDC order. want know viable data support valid fear, doomsday scenario little likelihood. 

I‚Äôm confused got idea hard time understanding part ""permanent lung damage, high risk stroke, heart disease, death.‚Äù What's hypothesis increase among latin/hispanics? mean leads another problem, causing next Great Depression? Interesting take, sadly full hospitals affect everyone. remember total global count hit number, sat wincing trepidation....

I would able wrap head around moment, is.  happening yet know about. know feral cats already giving people. much community spread hard pin people getting infected. really numbers time game point. enough people get infected, expose pets animals. Eventually become endemic native animals. necessarily mean evolve become deadly, infectious fact good chance becomes less deadly time. However talking evolution naturally random factor it. species basically playing Russian roulette virus getting control. let view reality shift ""political climate."" Perhaps error invoking Godwin's law, trying rationalize middle ground akin saying ""well gosh, politically untenable say people Jews heritage treated like Germans I'm fine travel employment restrictions draw line concentration camps!"" 

You're advancing anti-science view trying create false compromise.

The fact perceive comments - solidly *pro-mask* - anti-mask trolling ridiculous. Reprehensible. I‚Äôm pretty sure focus articles. makes sense me. guess follow question would be: don‚Äôt flu? hospitals maintain, don‚Äôt let military doctors hang stateside, utilizing military hospitals across country.

They getting hit admissions CoVID19 get control again. key everybody best, seems everybody least - people still fighting even that. exactly spring, tests. 

Keep mind numbers lag behind. take least till end coming week show effects restrictions inposed last week, Interesting considering we‚Äôve running almost trillion dollar deficits last years cause tax cuts lot world lives way cities towns. drastically harder spread COVID everything spread like that, compared major urban areas world works.

I could see spreading easily oilfield camps taken precautions. ended seeing post! going give either. Learning explore deepest depths heart isolation. Hoping something good comes it. Thanks again.  see official state statistics. true across multiple states. Private gatherings virus spreading most. Blacks hispanics holding mass gatherings wearing masks. They're hoping big check, pat head, free pass get vaccine first. think deserve it. endangering us all. man alternate universe timeline. We've told months months supposed get worse fall is. Yet, thinks change reality. genius, work?

Because can't stop virus anymore stop wind huge country large population elderly people 65 many counties total people? democrat hoax? But... trump getting it? think he's playing 4d chess pretending get it? Calm murifat, stroke corona gets you. maybe let local PD keep half fine would motivate them

also see anyone willing run next election sherrif pledging enforce laws ensure public health safety. He'll need continue tested several days feel ok honestly campaigning going on, debate risk. I'm happy taking seriously. Snitch. Nah, worked restaurant years. standards, guess. Correlation doesn‚Äôt equal causation. 

Show proof they‚Äôre massive outbreaks schools. I‚Äôll wait.  I'm friend! earth known 6 months?

Schools shut majority time since March. may right think I'm still going no. see getting covid vaccine least 6-8 mos released. feel like getting kind rushed obvious reasons I'd rather wait see what, any, side effects pop up. dude getting last nerve. like people dropping dead streets Wuhan? know comes China always credible.

Children dying covid exceptionally rare. weigh risks daily life. Driving child school isn‚Äôt risk free either, sports things do. defense Biden easy make fun of. tried, one running him. know shot dark, anyone know they're using perform tests? I've seen lot stuff rapid test kits, none completely validated yet. actually think likely certain states get far fair share based much likes governor One guy another thread actually making comment rushed vaccines writing Trump's name expletive lol small city * also feels lot smaller madison also 100k people. Honestly kind shithole. places like racine though. necessarily size, community evolving economically culturally. gonna great place live. Normal healthy people without preconditions wont take anyway mean ""despite""? know things getting bad BNO News national case announcements front page here. Even wins absolutely zero power another 3 months. US go winter plan üçä still helm, 0 incentive anything whether wins loses he‚Äôll never face voters again.

In words, it‚Äôs going long horrifying months US matter happens election day. It‚Äôs ‚ÄúScience Win‚Äù though. statement like simplifies many complications travel commerce union states. traveled world always makes shake head people compare policies countries/territories etc. one another apple apple comparisons. 

Yes, US middle dark time nation‚Äôs history, comparisons point chastising neighbor household isn‚Äôt run well mine (or vice versa). doubt need government support Stick fork power outlet? wanna see works United States also enjoy quote:

I'm one like 5 ppl wear mask gym, picking takeout restaurants ppl without masks even food there. Cash Rules Ephesians Around that's honestly take administrations while, different party gets ok lets spend first 2 3 years trying dismantle whatever last group put place. They're begging it. That's sad part.

It's kind sad logic like gun grabbing advocates: Trump fascist tyrant!

Also fun grabbing advocates: federal government ban guns flat wrong. link package insert HCQ lists cardiac side effects cause death approved 2017. ask. agenda appears mind say believe incompetence? leaders big Thanos fans or...? many people fought died freedoms? accurate Considering limited knowledge vaccine approval process usually works, I'm concerned whatever first one market be. taking vaccine first round. Maybe third, information available side effects. need Fauci, less Trump. Pretty consistently, see lot hate parents sub. Maybe average population skews younger/childless. countries seem care little freedom liberty? think use GMT (or maybe CEST) daily totals. long consistent, numbers good tracking cases. looking point view people believe virus deadly media said is. dont. think deadly cold dont feel need wear masks 98% survival rate kind pointless. sure aren‚Äôt projecting? dare say people would rather live another 10 years. Including dad, pretty sweet life set himself, retired living beach wife clearly loves him. primary reasons South Korea successful are; social acceptance, social acceptance rules, history social health awareness.

They literally opposite 'freedom' means stupid. Maybe? MAYBE?!?!? YA THINK? arrested jailed ignoring mask mandates states

Why? 

You think people want wear masks pandemic forced enclosed spacss? restaurant Huntington beach allow people wear masks? mention one‚Äôs seem enforcing mask mandates poor minimum wage workers fast food places gas stations. 

Source: poor minimum wage worker fast food place. Wait 2 weeks death numbers start catching up... people lost family members covid still think it‚Äôs hoax. realise that's anecdotal evidence right? Fucking thank you!!! One things pointed news first wave never ended exactly time build hospitals, rest nurses, etc....we're screwed federal government nothing lead us this. And..... Idk people say green bay small town. It‚Äôs got 100k people. 

Now don‚Äôt consider town small around 30k people that‚Äôs it‚Äôs surrounded bunch 30-40k plus towns. damn pesky rights freedoms. problem, right? compare deaths yesterday versus early stages pandemic. testing ever, hence higher numbers. Yet deaths trended since May. you‚Äôre fear mongering. 

Take care now! 

*(Am whole ‚Äúend comment snidely‚Äù thing right?)* That‚Äôs would watch Europe. There‚Äôs honestly strong chance approve something first. American, I‚Äôm envious guys!  No, pandemic, contagious disease, controlled months. don‚Äôt totally eliminate first lockdown, going run course. US Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Christmas, election day New Years coming next couple months.

Several points us make really bad decisions. Swedes believe conflict, famously pacifist. riot if... if... Nazis wanted use country highway invade other, peaceful nations. Exactly! needs aggressive. mean nothing else, body slam person, put headlock finally superglue face. Prospective homebuyers admire sort thing. Police enforcing fuck cares law can‚Äôt assume assert generalized stereotype?

Because speaking group people exhibit behavior. Specifically anti-maskers. Whereas comment directed me, individual. guess.... Everyone dumb you?

I never asserted that. Nice strawman. assertion come conclusions using primary sources talking heads. direct response accusation otherwise.

Any questions? done white knighting dude internet points? thirty years ""child"" suddenly develops lung problem asks mom ever childhood disease could related problem, mom say, ""I can't say sure. might covid, tested wanted school."" since one biggest countries really fucking comparison makes sense health organization corrupted Trump (like Canada EU) says ok, probably believe them. CDC FDA much credibility Jerry Falwell Jr.

But idea zero nonsense. Remember, herd immunity isn‚Äôt conferred, it‚Äôs function contraction survival. 

Vaccinating change this, course, Trump Co haven‚Äôt exactly supportive that. point comment clear path fighting virus right wing simply isn‚Äôt onboard.

The entire monologue herd immunity, letting virus run course, miracles, ‚Äúit disappear,‚Äù come right. that‚Äôs we‚Äôre dying droves.

If locked month would largely OVER. government resources directed towards: easing financial pain action.
Edit sp Normal 1, Sweden 2, Norway 6, Denmark 7, Spain 10. would make difference Norway Sweden/Spain same, that's asking.

I think Sweden Norwegian restrictions (Denmark also closed shopping malls):

All country's day-care centres, primary schools, lower- upper-secondary schools, universities university colleges educational institutions closed.

Cultural events, sporting events organised sporting activities, indoors outdoors, prohibited.

All restaurants, bars, pubs social establishments remain closed exception serving places food served, canteens eating establishments, accommodate distance least 1 metre visitors.

Fitness centres, swimming pools, water parks similar establishments remain closed.

Establishments provide hairdressing, skin care, massage, body care, tattooing, piercing similar services remain closed.

The prohibition staying cabins/leisure properties maintained.

All country‚Äôs driver vehicle licencing offices closed.

Please note restrictions recommendations. Hahaha common LOL  young. :(  Depends age school. best friend teaches kids Milan school doesn‚Äôt allow masks kids class ‚Äî passing hallway here‚Äôs dirty ‚Äúsecret‚Äù - someone uninsured gets care ER mandate, ends next year‚Äôs premiums. portion employer-subsidized health insurance went ten bucks week year, attribute COVID. 

For record, obvious post history, believe health care basic need basic right. believe covered everyone 100% basic care, it‚Äôd cost less. don‚Äôt even object paying share burden help less fortunate. object buried dirty accounting. NZ likely going accept transmission and, perhaps, mortality well, vaccine rolled out. far smaller scale world going moment. 

But then, living covid free life, freedoms, is, regardless happen road, far better alternative. source that? according argument 10 countries Europe

Thats still 7 North America! NUTS. would thought they‚Äôd record exactly 88,973 two days row? don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair say anything objective point.

We definitely know things going play out. two useful metrics: number people immunity, deaths far. ""ahead"" better. countries, compared, one ""win"" first metric one ""win"" Reports I‚Äôve seen say elderly people risk severe case covid Sweden terribly high rates depressio

I hear arguments US Europe. Nobody nursing homes allowed see anyone outside. Depression rampant. sucky time Also quite sure you‚Äôre getting IFR argument from.

IFR inferred serological data. Many people try manipulate (or intentionally) make IFR look low, done correctly. key recognition time frame. There's ~7 day median time infection seroconversion, ~21 day median time infection death, ~11 day median time death reported death. looking official COVID deaths, would want figure day sero samples collected add ~25 days count deaths then. would also want deaths counts pretty close. probably lot accurate use excess deaths instead tested deaths, Sweden same. Note excess deaths reported day death, 11-day lag gone. really wanted scientific assess ~90% confidence intervals gap, add get 99%+ confidence interval.

Anyway anywhere serology. back spring Sweden regularly. judged 0.8% IFR Stockholm 0.6% IFR nation-wide. think reliable sero-studies, they're something. places: 0.9% France, 1.2% Spain UK, 1.4% NYC outbreak. 9% dialysis study USA implies 1.8% IFR upper bound, done long timeframe could lower. believe cheating IFR's here. Reproducing Sweden calcs tricky, said think given weight Herd immunity inoculation come far natural herd immunity.

I believe case. believe Europe US herd immunity (along IFR's comparable maybe bit better) next couple months. use manipulated qualifications cause death standard existed nearly two decades it. mandatory school kids wear see me, punishment, kids eat together canteen. (This Nepal Italy completely ignore know masks implemented Italian schools.) get banned? Wait, help understand- almost 90k new cases one day??? covid, another thing going around. wasnt much nausea nothing going all. reason got diagnosed drs nurse exact symptoms spent 3wks hospital on. cant remember exact terms something along lines stomach paralysis epileptic type spasms stomach.

Exactly. think Sweden restrictions:

All country's day-care centres, primary schools, lower- upper-secondary schools, universities university colleges educational institutions closed.

All restaurants, bars, pubs social establishments remain closed exception serving places food served, canteens eating establishments, accommodate distance least 1 metre visitors.

It work. Mt (mi Michigan Ms Mississippi) husband involve himself.

I never understand many still think women's job take care kids household. 

And yes, husband full time job 2 kids. would involve myself? many patients, enough doctors. Christianity anything here?

Also, please keep mind Jesus cleansed temple flipping tables beating people whip. health condition lasts longer 3 months considered chronic (this definition doctor told diagnosed things Times). We're well past point lot people suffering post-covid health problems. Chronic conditions treated, likely go away own.

Unfortunately, we're still focused finding ways treat/vaccinate covid effectively. means lot resources going figuring post-recovery problems people have. It‚Äôs endless numbers studies come ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù conclusion schools major source spread! schools require masks minimal distancing measures problems. Thousands students teachers become sick coronavirus since schools began opening last month, public health experts found little evidence virus spreading inside buildings, rates infection far found surrounding Yeah, France, we're +45k today. I'm pretty sure that's lot case/inhabitants US. we've curfews populated regions 1-2 weeks now. shit said brutal, com-nist regimes history. care nobody else does, right? Yes lol

No not. You‚Äôre really hurting case consistently lying ass make point. Shortness breath consistently listed no/rare flu symptom considered big distinguished determine Flu vs Covid. found like 50 charts Google showing shortness breath Yes Covid Rare Flu. Weekend backlog? Or...for real? Either way‚Ä¶ üòü Stay healthy, friend. Can't grounds impeachment? think talking personality disorder haha countries like Italy done everything could second wave. 

Nah. mistake Western countries - reopen, let build back up. say Saturday? Could potential reason? (Honest question) Must coming certain parts US. case counts live, CA, fairly low. worst reality show. wow exact number two days row that's crazy Yeah. stat think came survey *hospitalized* COVID patients found 20% still lingering problems x number months following recovery. IIRC problems things like memory loss, fatigue, etc., problems self-reported, patients elderly. 

Aaaaaand turns ""20% cases crippled life!"".

What wonder much actually organic, much deliberate disinformation. Sweden losing control, despite wishes.

And realise come shock you, completely different diseases transmitted completely different ways completely different mortality, also different strategies prevention. Wow twice testing per million almost sure higher testing offset Something tells lot people going change tune see Republican governors shutting states, media hasn‚Äôt stopped bringing COVID-19 election. There‚Äôs sickening contingent country assumes it‚Äôs political happening election year isn‚Äôt coincidence. need wake think may finally mid-November. Pretty much everyone wearing masks distancing

Maybe virus constantly repeated slogans memes? Maybe spread simply distancing wearing masks? Even two year old help. surprised. Mormon family live across street parents. nicest, helpful people I've ever heard of, parents (in 60s) moved Mormon family helped unload travel trailer set bed furniture brought dinner first night. always around offering help.

They also greatest following Mormon rules, lots kids also drink beer coffee. Tut, tut. incorrect citing article May 20. Masks required central government state alarm measures elapsed June. time regional governments could set rules. time masks required. regions adopted mask requirements around mid summer. 

I'd hard pressed say mask wearing ""strictly enforced."" Jesus Christ, incompetent administration. Finally logic lol  like 200-300k US follows trends Europe. unfortunately see reasons wouldn‚Äôt.... Yeah COVID aside, nursing homes long way go (anybody remember articles 2011 jam porridge??). Hopefully there‚Äôs political momentum pandemic invest reform! That‚Äôs god damn right! countries third world hellholes US UK coming resemble option protect vulnerable live normal life

it's pretty cool blame people drugs drinking right now? never miserable life. lonely. drugs. even drink. understand people would. joy. take Advil PM sleep day away sometimes. wait 8th wave. make 6th wave look like child's play.

Bravo! sure fucking showed us gay l!beral sn*wflake f#minist pussies! course masks work! next time houses go flames, call fire department either, read FaceBook water ineffective fire! seeing sharp decrease number unruly passengers since 2nd stimulus bill stuck unemployment running out? much doubt people conservatives suggest don‚Äôt comment privy knowledge kind power impressive. one even make try. least there's criminal sitting behind Resolute Desk.

I noticed, one favorite upvotes Reddit accurately quoting people comments deleted, later seeing said comments deleted moderators. 

That imply quote passed moderation. 

Does mean I'm engaging hyperbole? Drank kool-aide? 

Not really. 

It John Bolton quoted saying ""I want anything drug deal."" There's shady shit going on. Well, fully expect keep going like everywhere, especially Sweden's hesitance impose stricter guidelines.

Sweden's positive test rate high moment also, may suggest undertesting. want nightmare over, especially since poorer disadvantaged family friends caught COVID. mother son okay, father going severe symptoms COVID, he's currently bed bound. I'm hoping recovers pass... indeed, Friday 10/9 (the peak week) 59,500 cases. reference, Sunday 10/4, 34,700. originated country restricted testing March, country largest percentage original virus mutation, country earliest cases half dozen country traced including Canada Australia, country death far, country notified NATO back November kept secret world, country who's president went record admit covered up.

But China open pandora's box, opened box called ""human life money"", forced countries take seriously, except, unlike China, outbreak festering far longer already late.

But worry, epidemiological evidence already pretty conclusive question origin, matter time US lose political power suppress it, humanity gets accountability deserves. French kissing sharing cigarettes Paris, quite shocking honestly. It‚Äôs fact everyone moves doors, everything do. - wear masks

 - hate everyone else, keen cross street throw stank-eye mask-scoffers.

I critical nursing homes run Sweden. ever word letting die strategy extremely ignorant. That's true big questions pandemic much role children play transmission virus. known get infected. known tend get sick die anywhere near rates older people. What's unclear much kids contribute spreading COVID-19 rest community.  found study children actually quite important,"" says Laxminarayan. ""They likely get infected, particularly young adults ages 20 40. likely transmit disease amongst themselves. unusual, schools India shut since March. clearly happening community \[level\]. also go infect people age groups, including elderly.""

You looking politics situation. benefits that? 

People live lifelong disabilities, die, want kids house. I'm really glad switched strategy original aiming suppression. done without pioneers like NZ demonstrating well pays off. weeks? days. Look Europe, numbers double every two weeks masks social distancing .... *‚ÄúThere‚Äôs real effort obfuscate pandemic, reasons beyond comprehension, sticking head sand doesn‚Äôt make go away,‚Äù said Dr. Aileen Marty, professor infectious diseases Florida International University Miami.*

This. cases rise, nothing. matter hospitalizations ""flat"". That's 250 people hospitalized day. Eventually hospitals able catch up. Localized lockdowns hotspots would stop this, enough tests enough tracers this. Additionally DeSantis says lockdowns. 

So let people die will, lasting damage suffer rest lives. almighty dollar. 

I hope over, caused deaths suffering brought trial, found guilty jailed. History tell tale. Whereas reality disagrees mortality rate coronavirus pandemic probably lower Norway's outbreak March-April.

It's odd, people suggested look Excess Mortality rather restrict comparison COVID-19 deaths, suggested may hidden costs lockdown measures Nordic countries. 

I provided data, showing increase excess deaths Norway Finland, large increase cause deaths Sweden (+59% Stockholm county), yet people happy. Sarasota., may difference downtown/night crowd though (of not) Inactivate filter. Guess inactivate part iffy?  Cheers Australia two professional league grand finals weekend meant serious response? You‚Äôd buy groceries stimulus money they‚Äôd paying stay home. Supremacy Clause says federal law trumps state law, place places Congress *allowed* pass law treaty. Necessary Proper Clause says Congress right law make enumerated powers.

Neither clause gives federal government right make whatever laws want whatever reason desire. Yup... I‚Äôm curious going here. NYC part New England. Yankees suck  point. Covid outcomes people severe cases linked prompt, good care. friend almost died Covid, went ok ok real quick crawl phone dial 911. certain get quickly, may died.

""Covid work like that"" response someone familiar disease progression. Sometimes fine sometimes need oxygen immediately. 

I'm hating country, live suburbs way crowded me. lived 45 minutes away ICU got Covid diagnosis, would stay hotel near hospital recover want hour away getting oxygen. *Just case.*


There's lot benefits living country city waste time argue better. depends lifestyle. I'm happy never get brunch mimosas again, care less shit. case medical emergency, can't say better 10 minutes hospital. Wah  Ok then! Every state God every state. know going happen.

America play lottery today. yet, top thread treating computer modeling, actual really mean ""this safe, effective vaccine"" (no mean lol know want believe that, read is).  I'm blaming Walmart. county less 100 positive whole time. beginning October walmart opened everything back up. stopped people outside making sure everyone mask coming in. news announced yesterday hospital full covid patients people go different hospital. 3 closest hospitals also capacity covid. Seriously months county low numbers everyone wearing mask, sudden 2-3 weeks ago everyone stopped. 1 5 wear mask, 1 5 wear one. clue changed.  That's like US getting 255,000 day. famine, crime, etc, way world backs claim.

The bulk China India, say much US That's case fatality rate, infected fatality rate. big difference know that. completely disregarding many asymptomatic cases cases never get tested. move goalposts. profound lack reading comprehension.

 *Add soccer players worldwide going since June, college football, baseball, MLS, NBA bubble, hockey, motorsports every sport world going lately issues like exceptionally rare.* 

You took mean I'm arguing thousands cases - provide data underscores original point.

 *I thought worth noting considering many people claiming athletes didn‚Äôt worry good shape.* 

They because...

 *issues like exceptionally rare.* pretty nice visit apparently.

It pretty safe go to. However, air travel pretty risky days flying 1st world countries. economy suffering simultaneous demand supply shocks interest rates remain tolerable. could apply argument making country implemented fiscal stimulus via deficit spending recession ever. possible effect delayed long enough us shift policy avoid seeing major increases inflation. Hospitals get overwhelmed death rate skyrockets. sampling bias there. Let ask this, better place wear mask? indoors, populated seen hygiene standards frequent walmart?? could wrong think could really transfer water (especially properly chlorinated). head water, obviously could still spread air. understand would pretty safe activity long still stay 6 feet+ people.

Again I'm expert may base here. dad works prison Boise casually noted 1,600 inmates tested positive. asked many inmates prison total, said ""oh, 2,200 so"". I'm sick death way covid treated like big deal folks. try fail one thing barely try fail different. pandemic downplayed. Florida hurricanes years never politicians downplay it. already know enough morons stay say big deal even category 5 aimed right them. 

There many things Trump fucked pandemic. thing actually tried good job would 20 points 9.1 points down. Found one. cases rising Europe &amp; many countries worldwide, daily deaths seem nearly bad earlier year

Why? virus getting less dangerous guess answers question asked, wondered people kiss strangers cheek France like know experience Portugal. get upvoted? incorrect Oxford vaccine is. Winter here. end, beginning end. maybe, end beginning. Italy strict lockdown went 2 months, try thinking vacationing safest place earth, fuck.. back basement...

That'd New Zealand Oh man winning! Agreed, gamble, shit show, need stop pointing fingers try best. We'd fucking boat matter president right now. Nothing, twice thrice or
.. That's Chinese vaccine works. vaccines developed western nations use different method.

It's literally first sentence linked Instead using weakened strain, small parts it, like traditional vaccines, Oxford jab directs body produce part virus itself

How type ""So basically [...]"" fail badly summarize basics article? Oh yeah people click links here. Nah, Trump really fucked coronavirus response. Wrecked economy, record unemployment, still cases deaths. size city, ease controlling influx people. really want sounds like dismissive. model would replicable western society. This. beginning third wave. First wave initial spread, deadly time due lack preparedness. Second wave summer lockdown ended things got political, infection increased deaths decreased. Third wave warning since spring happening right now. Yeah decided cancel. I've generally tried cautious throughout thing still somewhat fence. huge family would 12 people small townhouse decided good idea. lived warmer climate could still outdoors November might still opted way cold. I'm necessarily worried getting sick I'd hate responsible someone else getting I'm going celebrate year. Well, cases keep going way Europe, another ‚Ç¨200 billion half-assed lockdown soon. maybe another spring autumn next year? IMO they're dragging feet hope effective vaccine comes head 3rd 4th strict lockdown. rest world took China's approach they'd results. think people cared elderly country suited narrative either. also think people care mental health unless suits narrative. own. France know thing there, Portugal people sometimes greet strangers kissing cheek. I'm sure broadly southern Europe thing...

Can anyone France tell us there? serious question Americans, 100k people officially diagnosed millions infected sick people everywhere there? asymptomatic ones? Thank you, came say that, kind of, sure beat it. 
Thanks. Wow I'm Dutch, beginning februari baffled lack response, lack easily implemented measures, altogether denying obvious ways infections. 6 months time prepare, barely anything done. Mainly bacause guy charge denied second wave come based absolutely nothing. insane think urging countries take action weeks, China locking area size Germany, Europe completely ignoring it.  gain? fact Trump chosen religious idiots? That's it? Sure, testing rate rising factor 10x positivity rating rising 2x, still necessarily increasing rate spread. Crazy much virus spreading  That's looks like all. looks like saying virus might mutate benefit us, merely become less infectious less deadly. understanding. went lockdown 700 cases per day. looked data built model suggested we'd close cases 26 October. put us lockdown plan worked. 0 new cases today open up.

The model looks cases last 2 weeks single day think getting downvoted saying ""only 7 cases"". France 50,000 new cases last 24 hours. US 300 millions people, France comparison 70 millions. know there‚Äôs probably testing done France, comparisons might stupid, I‚Äôd lie I‚Äôd say didn‚Äôt send chills spine see European countries far away cataclysmic situation US. lives important? Got it. Silly me.

You engage strawman like talking lockdown Europe. African countries world social infrastructure support lockdown mean viable option Europe.

And honestly speaking, think people care lives 3rd world countries much developed countries suits narrative. flu also known cause ""false positives"" COVID tests.

This true.  virus might serious all. fucking proud. Im NSW legit appreciate sacrifice made much. Can't wait see ü•∞ guy said months ago trials could skipped anytime benefits outweigh risks. 

Not news: vax work, people still getting infected dying, yet ""medical authorities"" continue gatekeep vax continuing move goalposts. 17% positivity rate.. means 300k test per day... Man italy struggle keep around 170k. Actually italy test 100k **new people** per day, 70k tests check infected peoplel still sick. 20% positivity rate... That's scary. careful safe. No, Oxford vaccine adenovirus replication ability disabled. contains covid spike protein genetic sequence, contain weakened covid virus.  Stop frying brain Trump tweets well~ first never ended. sibling quarantine 2 weeks, see her? ways responsibly. Trump admin still call flu. I‚Äôm sorry hear that. live boyfriend high risk we‚Äôve staying in. It‚Äôs nice hear others following suit, sometimes seems like everybody else forgotten what‚Äôs happening makes feel crazy. guy cunt. Compared every northeast state absolutely didn‚Äôt lockdown anyone cite data effectiveness antiviral used prior infection becoming severe? far tell mostly used late stage severe cases sort defies know use antiviral used.

I'm kind frustrated this, effect recovery time severe cases curious effect would gave every patient hospitalized (the fact IV antiviral makes impractical outpatients). cvs philly 48 hrs turn around Oh no... Anyway... Spain even worse. 1M+ cases population 47M Dr. Fauci said wear masks beginning know extent virus capable airborne transmission lack PPE medical personnel.

If know, either kept quiet, conservative say ""wear masks"". 100 years figure masks, indeed, work. Either way, wrong lying.

That said, says ""oh, vaccines be/will ready""... know whether wrong, lying? maybe right time? would put $5 whatever says. much cost tested once? AKA alcoholism  science shows 2.6% USA Colder dryer air leads smaller droplets perhaps? Also virus may live longer cold. I'm sure we'll find soon. snowing Wisconsin, again... Stop commenting Reddit. literally nothing valuable say. comment history proves it. dignify toxic behavior further. Get help. else expect you‚Äôre testing thousands people day pandemic.

Old news. Hate break you, lay think one directly blame virus, fair, leaders certainly accountable responsible helping people. many done horrible job ought called it. That‚Äôs fearmongering, that‚Äôs simply calling situation is. advertised like that, maybe people would take seriously...nah, probably not. Yes...emergency/imperative health appts. only...1 family member, 1 neighbor &amp; 1 co worker passed covid &amp; high risk~ Yes correct encouraging. 

But states allow early voting vote mail. GOP vocal wanting make people vote person Nov 3rd. cause people consider line entire day vote, therefore exposing virus. Sunday too. 

Yikey Doodle Dandy. 8.69 million cases US confirmed thus far closer 3% 2% total population. I‚Äôve managed talk 2 mom‚Äôs 4 kids visit holidays. youngest sibling hold out. 

My mother two risk factors suffer severe illness even death COVID-19. I‚Äôve recruiting older siblings talking mother letting youngest come visit.

I‚Äôm thinking bribing mother youngest sibling. don‚Äôt see scenario mother hospitalized catches virus. 

My father died years ago. don‚Äôt want bury mother, sibling selfish dickhead. would peak then? continue grow get worse lockdowns reimplemented, see happening soon. 

NFL college football probably canceled, schools return distance learning except locales warm enough keep windows open. Churches, gyms, bars, indoor dining, theaters, bowling alleys (etc) closed. Much country never even lockdown, honestly none country strict one, may necessitate. Huge new stimulus passed lame duck Congress (which might mean stimulus arrives February).

So, think going take end November people freak enough actually begin curtail...then six weeks see peak. So, I'm thinking January 15th totals way uglier people contemplating.

Hope I'm wrong. Currently pouring one Victoria! Way potentially spread even diseases. vaccines work (only some), OP misstated one works. No, it‚Äôs list. Italy. keep forgetting religion it‚Äôs okay make fun Christianity $175 fine caught without seat-belt - likely enforced traffic stops reasons - simple karma killing stupid ones accident. take much longer going place giving anyone register shows up. That's quite possible. predictions assume toll 100,000 permonth. wish thing. would amazing. Glad reason stories like make news vast, vast majority churches US following guidelines closely. Lol!
I analysis this.

Might be. much. Maybe UK missing 25% cases. Still would France.

Current 7 days average cases (reported) roughly 20K (UK) 30K (France).

Current 7 days average deaths 163 (UK) 173 (France). Expected due 1% mortality (7 day average) cases 14 days ago 130 (UK) 160 (France).

France quite close. UK 25% higher expected.

So might underreporting (there might also myriad reasons explains difference) French cases would still higher UK ones.

That leads us question: UK death toll higher? Well... not. French 7 days average already surpassed UK one. ""that"" big yet.

And that's deaths count comes 14 days cases French deaths raising faster UK ones (as cases last weeks). 14 days expect 200 average deaths per day (UK) 300 (france).

25% higher UK underreporting cases. Must nice privileged enough politics doesn‚Äôt significantly affect life one way another. people dying millions every week, we'd fukt. tiny fraction percent ones risk, we're fukt believe we're fukt. think bikers came from? Really, read articles.

BTW, fuuu been? terrible education system helping them. Ah, well good ya then! stick fingers eyes, mouth, nose handling stuff. Common hygiene learned kids... keep saying running, mean? said radio head covid department uz Brussels. know zhich day tomorrow look numbers covid update UK things going continue get worse. government introduced tier system even severe tier, schools, workplaces, etc still open things travelling advisable.

UHHHH USA USA USA I'm opposed. (which accept), is, yet, Kuhn would call ""pre-scientific"" phase development. alchemists relation chemists today. Maybe depth study each, scientifically equally trustworthy. New vaccines developed different diseases constantly overcome issues like transportability potency. vaccines undergo set trials released. understand apprehension concept rushed vaccine needs put context normal obstacles weren‚Äôt present. tests passed it‚Äôs rushed sense skipped test phases.  I'm tired bro Half million cases day worldwide. Yikes! ok keeping infection high numbers low... 


THAT'S DEALING PANDEMIC WORKS!! North Dakota? Overall perfect metric, exist. completely irrelevant metrics exist raw cases one, cases per capital another (because cases function testing, population). key positivity rate actually substantial certain %, least identifying cases otherwise protecting vulnerable.

If say black communities less likely social distancing, masks, preventative measures, giving vaccine ASAP means everybody less likely say it, unpopular obvious reasons.

If say black communities deserves safety, healthcare, government assistance everyone else, unpopular obvious reasons.

The numbers consistent across country. Black people likely get virus, spread virus, largely due obesity, die virus. makes sense inoculate first, hard justify without coming across racist. I'm surprised they're rational thing all. would expected uniform distribution save face even evidence points fact inoculating black people first makes sense public safety point view. reading comprehension dying squirrel zero understanding this, I've already proven. CDC, among others, one giving numbers, NY Post. done NOTHING counter numbers. I've done job discrediting multiple times over.

Yeah I‚Äôve gone eat probably like 10 times since March I‚Äôve never felt danger getting covid. Tables spaced apart, employees (even cooks) wearing masks, plexiglass put close tables, groups 6 weren‚Äôt allowed. Even covid outbreak associated restaurant, took everybody‚Äôs name number intention calling tell they‚Äôve exposed. 

With restrictions I‚Äôm going relax enjoy eat delicious food without fear catching covid. Obviously restaurants aren‚Äôt following restrictions that‚Äôs different story, are, don‚Äôt worry. Cover-ups pretty core American society isnt it. Cover-ups projection would mean starting November we‚Äôd need averaging 3000 deaths day February. never reached threshold first two surges. crossed 2000 since spring. 

Highly unlikely. hit 86400 cases one day, we'll case every second day. 500 hospitalization day, peak even closer that.

In towns, 4% population tested positive last 2 weeks, they're even much testing (low lab capacity) nurses willing go presumably controlled outbreak potentially life threatening job front lines Again.

Seems like strange way distribute though understand intent. good strategy could deploy vaccine low income neighborhoods know affected vs affluent neighborhoods. I'd believe account seems overly obsessed wristwatches downplaying covid.

What slippery slope leading towards? Americans find fuckin hard wear mask? What's big deal cares would probably depend state city. People arrested jailed ignoring mask mandates states Except people refusing wear mask. problem fact think 100% eliminate transmission. going 100% eliminate transmission Lysoling groceries either.

You reduce risk, can't eliminate it. know fomite transmission exceedingly rare, hand-washing suffice reducing surface-to-mouth risk. means, Lysol groceries makes feel better.

That's everybody use one. research suggest even get exposed wearing mask symptoms less severe statistically significant degree. totally makes sense. much likely severe infection breath 1000000 viral units compared 100 viral units.

Socially distance, wear mask, wash hands. go long way reduce overall transmission. I'm going even address first article know virus spread indoors. That's what's discussion here, repeatedly stated. question efficient children spreading virus adults turn nexus surges we're seeing now.

The second article evidence specific outbreaks individual schools. Again, surges. advocating fact children still spread virus precautions still need taken schools.

""Risk-reduction strategies must implemented schools matter urgency.""

A scientist NYT article suggested thing, time acknowledging outbreaks, spread reduced safety plans.

Another fun fact: it‚Äôs editorial director Jeffrey Tucker, founding member Neoconfederate white separatist group League Sputh editor working fellow neoconfederate Lew Rockwell neoconfederate front group Mises Institute part team produced racist Ron Paul newsletters. (Source: SLPC) lose anti mask voters??? way ever observed often people touch things &amp; even washing hands frequently? Ever studied aseptic technique? Ever seen easily even MRSA Candida Auris spread healthcare setting? would rub skin hands washed hands often enough eliminate transmission. Trader Joe run Germans good enforcing rules Sounds delicious. Pepsi Center Denver: free drive-thru testing. isn‚Äôt going get better vaccine developed even then, morons refuse wear masks social distance resist vaccine. Russiagate q anon liberals Hahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaa Still? think Donald crisis actor?

I would definitely hedge quoted statement ""in locale"". general we've agreed thing exists. LOL fact even question people means doomed. Sadly weekends. literally entire states don‚Äôt report numbers!!! 80+ thousand weekend day real real bad!! 
Like REAL BAD!! Daniel Griffin says:

‚ÄúThings getting worse, Vincent.‚Äù

Patient updates: 
Pro bono remote advise patients throughout world. unpredictable disease. Coagulation issues starting week 3

New York - 1000 people day admitted sick people won‚Äôt go hospital according Urgent Care.

Moderna- fully enrolled trial good news.

Each state plan. hoping April start large numbers people vaccinated. American charged vaccine.

UK challenge trial starting using laboratory grown strain live virus. Argument able tell 10 weeks prove efficacy. using young, healthy people won‚Äôt know work others. 

When get efficacy data ongoing trials? check predetermined numbers infections see efficacy data. get data next month. case counts go up, able data infections.

CDC analysis school infections, etc.
1 5 deaths 65.
Majority people died caucasians. disproportionately affects African Americans, deaths Caucasian.

Excess deaths- aren‚Äôt counting Covid deaths. Largest increase deaths 25 -44. Why? lost 300,000 Americans. 2/3 confirmed Covid, don‚Äôt know rest.

Indoor dining holidays- saying *you* think makes difference, wearing mask? 

If so, congratulations. directly part problem. Grow up. They'll trying pump numbers up. elites found way curb population. Christians ... pretty liberal minded. 

Evidence? Seems like Republican base composed mostly Christians. win elections him.

I know Episcopalians Friends meet description, sure seem minority experience. Forget Thanksgiving. Halloween next Saturday night First-Wave: Surge 2: Episode 2

Brought Valve. fighting police proper reaction. worked many times past, right? Look thumbail? realize ocean waves ocean remains ongoing right? one saying virus went away, stop pushing anti-science. circlejerk trolls ridiculous. OP skeptic troll saying stupid shit Covid deniers circlejerk. like belive trump think it. Indoor dining theaters hard nope still. February 26: ‚ÄúWe're going substantially down, up.‚Äù - donald trump northern nj, spiking again? thought golden here. Sweden ten times worse Norway. That‚Äôs worth pointing out, that‚Äôs *doing alright*. thank god going away! oh wait... live people must sane.

Where live, people genuinely question virus real not, political hoax perpetuated Democrats.

I shit not. This. Follow money investors are. Yes, wits end, lockdown impossible economy lowest first lockdown. surrendered like Argentina. starts getting cold Iran too. US dollar global benchmark, it‚Äôs vulnerable country like Venezuela‚Äôs currency I'm sorry family's loss, number human loved. Don‚Äôt forget misreported deaths well. well 300k normal death rates attributing 220k COVID-19. Even adding half deaths CFR huge deal. still wonder country's original case death numbers earlier pandemic anywhere near accurate. amount testing July September. 

Why detect fewer cases September July? 20k UK 340k tests roughly 6% positive rate. 300 new cases/million day Without light (or moderate) slavery, socialism exact problem capitalism instance. 

Socialism would require people produce without reward people need nothing barter necessities shut producing things need bartered. 

It would require huge volunteer force unlikely materialize, meaning would force people produce will. 

Maybe that‚Äôs good thing you. Maybe isn‚Äôt. that‚Äôs reality. Sunday wonder big real numbers positive test rate rising. Anyone dies covid sucker loser like dead soldiers

-Trump, probably. Let's wait dust clears extent corruption/dishonesty/cruel practices China managed lead initial outbreak spread outside confines China. think streets packed 11, never Spain. regurgitating rightwing talk radio zero evidence claims

WELL SAID!! wasn‚Äôt poor COVID I‚Äôd give awards!!! Great comment. exact same

Of yea. fuck people ever said hoax gonna go away dont worry it. That‚Äôs really bulletproof vests work. They‚Äôre measured levels stopping power. stop bullets they‚Äôre capable stopping structurally compromised point longer stop bullet it‚Äôs rated for. isn‚Äôt like random 50% chance 9mm fully penetrates level 2 plate whatever. doesn‚Äôt work way.

So comparison falls apart completely still doesn‚Äôt explain rise cases vs fall flu cases. masks they‚Äôre recommending effective both. Many leaders politicans thought level March would never reached. wrong. gets even worse March. Im expert spotting trends, fourth fifth article ive seen today countries pretty well, taking aggressive action rates skyrocketing. one even agree virus real not;

Lolwat It‚Äôs people going inside winter. huge spike anchorage Alaska schools still closed. There‚Äôs also big spike Montana Dakotas. Certainly, value money one legally permitted provide service logistics teams bringing goods store. experience us wish have.

Declining number, green shoots hope? many people die signficant pandemic? realize one un-die, right? shit testing fuck COVID? It‚Äôll interesting ever figure big first ‚Äúwave‚Äù since didn‚Äôt really testing. would read much sort articles. People want gravitate back towards former lifestyle control. much Spanish Flu change society over? call averaging 4K cases day past week controlling much. thinking vacationing safest place earth, fuck.. back basement... even worldwide many countries except Netherlands, daily case curve looks smooth.  Perfect excuse impose tough-love lockdown measures then. space jails. Maybe mandatory community service beautify parks streets Interesting. South Korea already economic issues pandemic hit though. it‚Äôs pandemic doesn‚Äôt render basic Econ invalid. fact probably heightens validity. miss days could joke waves diahheria ones good getting efficient treating virus otherwise spike cases would much worrying. doubt it. vaccine history ever developed ready go year. make matters worst covid 19 relatively new virus much known it. vaccine record time newly discovered virus unheard of. I'd say obvious result poor leadership top might imply done design. I‚Äôm betting 100k per day 11/1/2020 North Dakotan, I've known someone (in 20s!) severely ill still claims numbers made ""friends work hospital"" told write Covid every death.

Others shrug say affects people die serious health conditions anyway. 

There startling lack empathy here. Interesting.

I kinda think China took world power 1 status corona thing.

Is obvious get things done fixed, whereas west countries messing around half measures really work.

So super rich wanted open chain restaurants, would better open China west, west like open close open close open close lol. New infections rate dropped half peak trough. That's plateau. Latvia? What's big plan? We‚Äôll 100,000 Tuesday. Guaranteed!! 

Headline: One Week Election US Tops 100,000 Cases One Day 


We‚Äôre rounding corner!! Yea dipshit. Cause going circles!!! ü§ûü§û  indication productivity dropped since people working home upper management wants everyone come back full time still aren‚Äôt sure productivity issue future. also said ‚Äòwell site 30 people 50% capacity hasn‚Äôt COVID issues, therefore site 500 people 95% capacity fine‚Äô. Super spreader donny going around rallies ain‚Äôt helping anyone. even get re-elected. spreading COVID more.  Oh yeah, Biden's going blamed every single death, including 400,000 already happened takes office January.

And thing he'll able point stop carnage call national lockdown. Way start term office high note. Depends want get rid old bat ;) assumed bias people don‚Äôt want answer it. 

*I declare question bias, don‚Äôt answer it!*  virus live surfaces days, headlines I've seen past months. Groceries surfaces. Clean counters soap water leave wipes something useful. incompetent, evil. trying twist words. never claimed UK fast lockdown, sure perhaps UK best example.

I also never claimed Sweden hard hit Spain UK.

But seems like we're sort agreement, can't compare death tolls, also analyze every country circumstances. possible learn power?  Pretty clear maxima/minima plot. entire corona theater take years. western world basically given fighting virus properly, letting spread rampantly. means take long time ""put fires"" even vaccines arrive.

Meanwhile, China gets leeway eventually become economic superpower Earth. Missed /s? Belgium.

Infections rising lot, fortunately hospitalisations seem much smaller % infected March would make sense we're testing lot more.

Still concerning though. They've said another 'full lockdown' restaurants cafes closed now. Still surprised schools operating normally. whole ""Democrat hoax""/ anti-mask attitude coming White House impact spread.

OK then! toilet paper panic buying thing US? germany started news report almost daily toilet paper. nearly zero corona deaths months, total deaths literally lowest ever recorded.

Bullshit... even lowest last six years:

  Number deaths period January 1 September 30

  Source: spreading lie. culture completely different United States.

Well, got one thing right least. cultures different, actually care people around them. ironic, Christians always preaching ""love thy neighbor"". Trying rationalize irrational behavior, it‚Äôs exhausting. I've changed careers 3 times last decade (I'm 30)

Finally found one fits me, found girl loves me, life good. decade ago miserable, fixed it.

If clinically depressed device help, need medication. otherwise defeatist reason. another new record new cases. would worry much it. family gone eat every Sunday brunch past several months. Masks required sit down, that. Tables set 6 feet apart although separated dividers staff wear masks time. Minister Giuseppe Conte said want impose new economically-debilitating blanket lockdown type imposed earlier year, pandemic gripped nonetheless expected announce fresh tightening restrictions Sunday**, could include reduced opening hours restaurants bars closure public gyms swimming north Sicily south follow Campania, Lazio Lombardy next week imposing curfews, regions expected join -- unless government first imposes nationwide refuse accept virus around one minute midnight next minute no,"" Forza Nuova leader Giuliano Castellino said [referring curfew], according AGI news agency. Serious question: expected right? Back Feb/March CDC said 60-70% us getting it. We've got long ways go hit 198 million infected. 86k/day we're talking 6 years go. CDC right, we'll seeing daily rate winter ... geez ... 5 10x now? even confirm many per day. know going life 18. 38 still least I'm happy ;) Adams County extends well beyond Denver urban area, yes. fear mongering, stop. Shit Sherlock New Zealand small island 5 million people. difficulties getting covid control country like New Zealand faced majority countries world. It‚Äôs based percentage covid patients hospital city. It‚Äôs state wide mandate. Everyone wearing masks wearing properly. People trying social distance almost impossible considering population density. plus side, festivals weddings scaled drastically. IQ tests often masks themselves. 2 weeks way short look thr amount cases get fast rising. Honestly really wanted lower cases dramatically we're looking month lockdown there's question damage would cause economy local businesses already finding tough. Congress damn useless can't see passing stimulus bill time help people financially we're go hard lockdown going say Trump's train uses air force one must Biden's Amtrak going win. /s France might reach state weeks, hope much momentum. Hmm. mean original post says deleted? poster that? 5pm. get pissed start shouting other‚Äôs faces Rambo kills people mistreat POWs; real, he'd hunting Trump. testing? think people voting going make jump numbers. Even though people NEED vote going get worse unfortunately. Nov 3-4 jump 100K latest guess Ithaca, NY? Yes, that's I'm implying. flu also known cause ""false positives"" COVID tests. get odd traveler *we eat them* Opening schools mistake. 

This growth going stop untill close schools again. One thing anecdotally say I‚Äôve seen record number people know get engaged married year. it‚Äôs pretty normal age group still, seems bit trend due virus/lockdown.  Outback lunch Randolph (Boston suburb) table 6 celebrating someone's birthday. Oh, normal bday celebration say? Nope. 92 cake. even joking. That's insane amount considering pop 66m Covid-20, 33%* infectious! Get today!

*As tested independent scientists vs Covid-19. Actual results may vary. Considering Phizer expanded testing children ramping production distribution...I think either data pretty good idea data be. 

The FDA won‚Äôt approve anything middle November make big public statement then? Yeah, everyone looks there‚Äôs reason see family opinion. like think maybe people appreciate things more, won‚Äôt take granted. Perhaps that‚Äôs one tiny good thing come this. know many things I‚Äôm going stop putting off. numbers spiking high weekend, reporting usually lower, suspect 100k day happen Tuesday Wednesday week. cold north December January. bad feeling lot states otherwise fairly well summer going rough winter. Keep mind ""you antibodies anymore"" mean ""you immunity anymore"", people. Darwinism action! Domestic terrorism spreading lethal disease happening EU, fake news media calling ""protests"" act spreading disease quarantine same, also deal same. I'm saying everything risk.

Can tell many people died covid today? tell ages?

The reason want know mostly people 90s already dying.

So real question lying?

Or stupid? Ignorant ppl say wearing masks violation freedom, complain wearing clothes. 
ü§îü§îü§îü§î live Canada. Much country like yourself. 

Where live however haven‚Äôt single new case 6 days 7 active cases total. 

It done. commit it. find ordinances require masks even outdoors, alone, woefully misguided. encouraged beachgoing, closed beach bar *interiors*.

The evidence date transmission primarily respiratory aerosols presymptomatic/asymptomatic infected, especially enclosed poorly ventilated spaces travel well excess ft/2 stay aloft hours. Children, teens young adults low risk life threatening disease, likely superspreaders older people.

So, simple measures like universal mask wearing (preferably (K)N95s) publically accessible interior spaces, encouraging outdoor dining/teaching etc possible, prohibiting non-essential business mass gatherings interiors community spread uncontrolled, pretty obvious March. French here: since covid, never seen single person kissing outside expect rare couples. 
It could related higher population density. 
The population density France 3,3 higher USA:  
\-France:119 per Km2 (309 people per mi2). 
\-USA: 36 per Km2 (94 people per mi2). 
In general Europe dense USA. read study? Yeah, I'm saying get tested. record, obeying guidelines, specifically things like this. Eh I'm still fan wrapping lol love cold I'm still young think matter putting aside whatever degenerated part brain refuses put mask it. know real time. They've saying beginning. reminding boy cried wolf. Yeah right That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening though far voting. We‚Äôre record breaking numbers early voting (Usually early voters tend democrats) couldn‚Äôt agree more. I‚Äôm sick doom gloom. USA USA USA USA USA !!!! fucking morons read study schools issue. sources? someone quick update 3D model Covid wih pair scissors ? Get COVID-19 drink Natty Light... jesus trend first wave due way cases counted.... Astounding shit needs explained ""people"": claiming Italy done ""strict social distancing"" schools omitting ridiculously insufficient rules masks extremely misleading, hence calling paragraph ""horseshit"".

Is clear need lower grade level? teach high school try. know other, civilized, countries national mandates.

Europe number infections: ~8.3 million

Europe number deaths: ~250k

US number infections: ~8.5 million

US number deaths: ~200k

For US supposedly everything wrong 'civilized countries' Europe supposedly everything right, things seem going much better there, homie. Yes, method would also work today.

Who cares 0.5% deniers retarded get it, till they'll never understand. Brand domestic terrorist organization open fire. people stopped caring stopped listening. That‚Äôs sad. Kentucky we‚Äôve got folks willingly wearing masks because, ‚ÄúHey numbers rising things don‚Äôt work! slightly inconvenience freeeeedum!‚Äù  addition opposing Governor every chance get vocally criticizing wear masks, questioning faith patriotism.  It‚Äôs disgusting deflating. That's Trump fucked up. massive way. trying blame someone else. listen guy lies, bullies, blames everyone problems? Many countries world given people cash kids results disappointing. 

The reality less people getting married, divorces sky rocketing, people prioritizing careers kids, less stigma kids kids fewer generations past. 

It's also lower income people tend kids higher income people mean money big factor. Well, Kashgar popular destination domestic travelers since waaaay far away eastern China. visitor Beijing Xinjiang usually lands Urumqi, 2400km away Beijing. wants visit Kashgar, would take another fight another 1100km (roughly distance New York City Chicago), even fact Kashgar Urumqi autonomous region (which twice size Texas!). No, that‚Äôs usage here. Rounding corner heading home infers it‚Äôs almost over. Going around corner means nothing. deaths also increased? Tell us please  never said thousands cases. said thousands athletes. fact there's 32 NFL rosters nearly 100 players count active roster, practice roster, IR, scrubs come workouts practicing playing together since July plus MLB similar scenario there's ~100 total cases 2 players (and total, probably &lt;10 among guys know arent household names) lingering effects, underscores there's extremely minimal risk playing pro sports. Florida‚Äôs also lying it‚Äôs ass deaths. Check pneumonia cardiac arrests Florida year notice much higher average. check. would remember it, especially end. First ""we know end summer""

Then ""we know mid October""

Now ""we know December""

I'd bet everything December rolls around ""we know March""  mean? talking ass. AZ lot things differently FL. Honestly I'm glad they're finally honest.

They saved bunch money said beginning ""you're own, we're gonna rush vaccine. Good luck""

It would sincere horse shit realise driving car kill you. Try understand risk. Currently understand realize driving car damage lungs cause brain damage, blood clots require amputation limbs unknown damage still learning about. die mean organs injured. ignorant view pretend like cars ""bumping other""...completely wrong.

You desperately trying correlate risk driving cars getting car accident risk experiencing adverse effects covid. effective.

You claim people sub emotional instead rely data. gave data, nothing say it. know intentions are. second lockdown discussed people keep ignoring basic things like wearing mask social distancing. means, go see family. one stop you. right right - everyone get tested gathering. Way better use resources. want Covid bad. tired bull. Congratulations, thank showing everyone else hard possible. gonna roll dice parents grandparents, know plenty people will. difference year year key. Possible reasons death could Covid related. ie closure soup kitchens, increase homelessness, children getting meals schools, domestic abuse unsafe homes, etc. would need see data deaths reported comparison years. Great article comparison show possibly many Covid cases reported. Nova Scotia, Canada. get odd traveler isolate work health officials avoid spread. happening Italy- people saying stupid stuff. seems me, based limited perspective, everyone taking really seriously Spring crazy rhetoric starting coming States everyone got dumb. I'm saying American living abroad. many/most places, labs runs tests open weekends, leading Sundays Mondays usually lowest number reported cases week. Yeah imagine coronavirus aerosols would problem moving 2 meter tall plexiglass barriers cavernous room. point survival fittest. half brain, wear mask. not, gg y'all. social distancing still thing west couple years I'll definitely try move Australia NZ First double donut day Victorians since June! We've earned it. Hoping get restrictions lifted today. sincerely hope sake around unbury head ass. danger people around you, ignorant realize it. mask inconvenience need child wearing one. 

You you, cupcake. hope understand gravity destructive behavior. stay fuck away me. Ah right. Sorry, read past that. percentages, multiply 100 percentages (0.003%, 0.02%, 0.5%, 5.4%- approximate overall IFR 0.5-1.4% based data China Europe prior May 2020). CDC‚Äôs website says numbers Hauser, A., Counotte, M.J., Margossian, C.C., Konstantinoudis, G., Low, N., Althaus, C.L. Riou, J., 2020, available percentages, 330M Americans 70+ years old, every single American infected, would 178k deaths. Hospitalizations give good comparison time believe. Peak 1 trough 1 almost identical peak 2 trough 2. Peak 3 yet determined, it‚Äôs well peak 1&amp;2 point Impossible, affects virtually nobody told??  true. hopeful national elections could help out, even Biden wins, looks like he‚Äôs leaving lot power governors comes mask mandates safety measures I‚Äôm sure hit head individualistic behavior.  fact final paragraph fascinating countries getting shit super hard right too, yet ""do right"", people like say ""how could leadership failed them??"" ""progressive"" countries re-surging? I'm pretty sure already know answer.  American media Amerocentric totally missed types crazies exist sides Atlantic. Exactly. People seem ignore huge sliding scale fully open can't leave house. somewhere setting leaves things open propagate virus. bother health system right? really. US 26.7k cases per 1M today, according Worldometer. That's top 10. Canada 5.7k per 1M. fact people legally prohibited rendering services ? yes sad truth -- u r right. long thing hardcore lockdown last? jak dlouho? :)) Im sure many others continued Social distancing summer.

Oh fucking boy worth anything fun people go clubs/bars/festivals/large scale religious events/foreign countries.

Meanwhile many flights Skopje multiple infected board apparently required testing quarantine isnt possible here.

Im fucking done. type yourself? 95+% nz success due geography. Nothing else They're still Santa thing? hell?????? üò≥ predicting 100k per day next Wednesday looks like might hit sooner. incorrect, however part Normal life resumes end pandemic Hunter‚Äòs nose probably destroyed coke blasted picked bad time stop. may occurred you

But body determine people bodies feel US alone there's 100 million people age range. 200,000 young people dying LOT years life lost. know really fucked up? can‚Äôt tell supposed serious not. Immunity news solid lately Yeah stfu possible literally forcing shut giving payroll subsidies. There‚Äôs enough money country bail every small business America. Thursday, said BS Thursday. Well, knew exact count wouldn‚Äôt undercount, would it? look global count 42m cases, estimates 750m true cases month ago. serology studies US show 6-24x undercount many people asymptomatic don‚Äôt get tested 10x pretty easy get to, especially gets high 16%. course don‚Äôt know France today, 10x undercount pretty consistent across world.

Also, using reverse IFR (number deaths / estimated IFR) France 5.7m true cases (vs 1.08m tested cases) IFR 0.6%, recent studies put IFR closer 0.25, would put true cases 13.8m. somewhere 6-13x number true cases vs tested cases occurred. Psst, that's still reading. told tense today it, tensed hard. unpleasant. Eyes got watery see. like.. painful, extremely weird sensation. Ended coughing fit afterward (in car, windows up, worries) fucked good 10 minutes.   want to/can encapsulate reason? rules broken protest though.

*yawn*.

Can rules also broken Hunter Biden? Naw numbers low Sunday Monday due decreased testing weekends. 100k Friday Difficult? No.

Infringing upon constitutional rights? Also no, people feel differently guess. Please don‚Äôt generalize, makes things worse conversation. Born raised Idaho. mask public practice distancing. Even quarantined supposed to. sure, also need promote support local businesses  ain't running president Yeah would I'm going remain optimistic. He's gone long without contracting it, what's another week. NBA successfully create bubble players, campaign create bubble Joe Biden.

Not everyone like NFL Donald Trump decide shit pass around covid like Thanksgiving dinner. I'm Christian.

I think stupid selfish bullshit. 

This people hate Christians. That's volunteer bodyguard, thing side effects covid-19 restrictions: mental illness, child abuse, domestic violence.

Was thinking this. glad brought up. 99% people either get Covid mild cases, underlying ramifications longer lasting severe. Unfortunately, fun people share articles random teenagers dying (often due to, part of, medical conditions) claim virus dangerous everyone. He's leader religious leader Iran, right?

Wouldn't first call action get everyone Iraq pray virus away?

I'm facetious here. clearly believe all-powerful God. dude best connection him/it. Surely would good time demonstration power?

Same US. people power ostensibly believe God (even Trump, lol). number one reaction, country puts much emphasis faith, make nation-wide prayer part top 5 strategy items? it‚Äôs light end tunnel (I hope). elderly, risk, front line workers get first hopefully restrictions ease steadily. Isn‚Äôt something Tracy Morgan already done? got test long ago. wasn‚Äôt casual swab test, tube went straight nose throat injected liquid slurped back took sample. Awfully gnarly. 

I asked swab test apparently accurate PCR test health entity adopted instead normal swab one. 79 deaths too, lot country 11.5 million. highest daily death toll since May. Take vitamin too. quoted directly Gates study said HCQ side effects negligible. decades experience millions patients prove safe. correct. isn‚Äôt. don‚Äôt believe said was, error. simply responding comparison Bermuda‚Äôs policies (and ability enact/enforce them) US. fair, super proud happy Bermuda hope US pull together similar fashion. 510,000 (assuming mean per capita equivalent)

Edit - also per capita equivalent France reporting 106,000 mean, it‚Äôs tragedy died shouldn‚Äôt died, you‚Äôre right things pretty shit. thank education system that. I‚Äôm saying agree them! saying heard parents say district-related forums. Bolsonaro Trump wrent't behind surgisphere study Lancet denounced (saying HCQ bad). also anything UK study giving toxic doses patients.

Yes, Trump twit, opponents seem hell bent generating fake news counter him. end worse knowing truth really is. mention Supreme Court strikes ACA next month puts millions Covid-19 survivors list pre-existing health issues Saturday? Tuesday Wednesday going brutal. never said okay die.  almost every social, health demographic measure, Sweden usually ranked closely Nordic neighbors worldwide lists. 

With Covid contrast tragically striking. country low density easy access healthcare. success story. high rate infection list. restaurants reopened too. Yeah, [it's like Man, difference. It‚Äôs still tracking. war, homes turned lights wouldnt get bombed. Food gets rationed everyone eat. pandemic, wearing masks reduces spread. Imagine saying someone wouldnt turn lights night thats constitutional rights next thing know they're gonna start taking more. Thats stretching hard

Its easy thing could save someone's life. ridiculous. making people sick, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs coronavirus, question asking is, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs making sick?‚Äô‚Äù

This just...just...I know, man.

Everyone entire world talking coronavirus. Hundreds thousands dead Americans. admit people getting sick, yet ""pretty sure"" one disease *EVERYONE WORLD* talking about. Jesus wept. responsible... What's mean?  locked later countries reopened sooner them. 14 quarantine requirement also apply others help Australia avoiding second wave. guys want use karma farming probably. country community case weeks one post almost daily like NZ. move focus things elusive two comma club (or period European) argument lock broader view public health focusing covid, rational compare deaths per capita causes year? society likely die better society likely die covid specifically? big conspiracy dude. every country, outside maybe Brazil, US, says low risk. 

Lets put different way. know Mexico? Kind fucked country, right? Wonderful people, great culture, absolute shit show full cartels practically owning country, kidnappings, beheadings. Nasty, messed shit. 

*They* saying America needs get act together. dont want *us* entering country, making worse.

And Canada? neighbor? Known nicest country earth? *agree*.

225,000 covid deaths. Thats quarter whole world's numbers. continuing rise drastically, everyone else pretty much beat. Soon, we'll country allowed go other, we're plague rats. irony Sweden worse economically neighbors liberal measures haven‚Äôt helped economy. Bro feels like they're scraping brain anyone give ELI5 virus affecting infants blood type thing? federal public health authority, CDC lot tools disposal. CDC published comprehensive Emergency Response guide. introductory section law.

[CDC CERC legal authority supersede constitutional rights. Right Assembly, example. So, regardless people claim, constitutional rights violated. provisions specifically public health emergencies.

Page 27 discussed restrictions personal liberties. includes quarantine may instituted. Social distancing measures. Invasion Privacy (contact tracing). goes say CDC Director impose restrictions efforts states insufficient. 

Unfortunately, document include word ""mask"" anywhere tool reduce spread. Business closures, quarantines, number cumbersome tools disposal. means things continue get worse, hospitals become overwhelmed, may choice mass quarantine people states enforce mask wearing. 

I'm taking Healthcare Law happened something read last week. work NHS. told testing today wanted it. said yes. swabbed throat nose. know tests reliable others boils money (obviously mine free) ie reliability vs comfort vs cost.

I told take maximum 3 days txt me. Early around March Bloods taken (anti-body test) said would take 3 days. txt'd less 24 hours later results. 2 weeks! forgot blm protests riots Anybody expects majority students succeed academics pandemic 1. head ass, 2. priorities line.

This year ""do-over."" honest ourselves, we'd call it, keep kids home full semester try put mess behind us. Well ""Famous Potatoes"" *is* state motto. least they're front it. losing ability breathe? that's patrons. science? exactly would see herd immunity becomes goal. death rate young people fucking zero.

I‚Äôm sick strawman talking point two reasons. First, ignores fact high-risk businesses open *at all* compromise, asking close early people can‚Äôt act irresponsibly isn‚Äôt thing fascism considering could closed altogether.

Second, shows complete lack empathy employees stick around cleaning places well closing, employees already much higher risk average customer risking immune systems harder work. two weeks substantially higher today.  OC resident take offense. wear mask everyone know. Don‚Äôt let people made news speak rest us. Remember 3.18 million people call OC home [a larger population 21 appreciate civil discussion. think fair points, point lead talk better handle issue. Regardless stat mention, still issue. agreed data posted true, let's discredit data media entirely that's dangerous talk. always think Matt 7:21, enough cry ‚ÄòLord, Lord‚Äô show actions begins protecting communities. 

The Christian order love God, everyone else, yourself. Missing church indeed painful believer, small sacrifice safety others.

This seemingly cases India going real mystery

There serology studies Indian cities showing significant population seroprevalence. India lot cities, lot people live near city. drop mean pandemic everywhere changing seasonality bring back. fairly descent good enough?

Also ‚Äúglobal sense liberal conservative‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make sense all. Would care clarify? think right. students though? lot Asian students they‚Äôre wearing masks even this. Let see explain clearly: get infected coronavirus, develop covid.

Therefore, to:

1) Calculate probability infected coronavirus

2) Then, probability develop covid

3) THEN, survival rate covid age/comorbidities bracket

So, CDC gives us number (99.997%) 3 without factoring 1 2. 99.997% even higher, real world.

If still understand, need take 'introduction probability' course man, seriously. basics 101, elementary stuff many think US retailers covid test gift set sale black friday? Half White House.

/Edit: downvote, math. White House 377 employees, 36 tested positive, 9.5%. Belgium 11 million inhabitants, 17700 tested positive, 0.16%. 9.5/.16 = 59.

Result: 
Actually sixtieth White House per day. links? news, water wet. brutal part additional deaths caused non-covid reasons getting hospital bed high tech equip available impossible. 


Nothing like considering people dying minor heart attacks, treatable internal bleeding, undetected cancer addition covid sober one up. 


So seem capable conceptualizing 2% hospitalization rates 10,000 people get infected 100-200 ICU capable hospital beds required keep survival rate high. I‚Äôm done country, too. I‚Äôve always toyed leaving, fell trap of, ‚Äúoh, gotta stay make better!‚Äù kinda abusive relationship shit that?? mom currently sick may pass next couple weeks. want miracle, whatever. that, dad reason stay here. Feels like 3rd wave US. Sheep go bahhhhh knew death hospital cases 

Take number hospital multiply 5 that‚Äôs symptomatic cases 

Take cases multiply 4 that‚Äôs infected Ooooh, Kardashian! Flu people wearing masks social distancing more? would fuckin imagined. anyway get enrolled online therapy? really helpful talk therapist every week, issues, course, also talk see someone zoom! fucking literally hate everyone right now, homebound-ish due chronic illness soooo fucking depressing. Hang there. Would rather get shitty subs ""out stock"" items? don't, covid least worries. think contagious warm mild, also contagious cold winter thought going away honestly. Nope, someone actually think. Comparing NZ European country (or american state) stupid stinks.

When there's sheep flu, gets around world... I'm willing bet Europe tackle far better NZ. Europe better politicians, better people healthier sheep. yall using track hospitalizations. i'm really concerned Correct! I'm surprised one started conspiracy like government wants old sick die pay less retirement medicare benefits States way third world country Lots outbreaks Alabama Georgia link. 

And ‚Äúproposal‚Äù first made back August ... since kiboshed. Santa's vaccines brainchild Michael Caputo, political strategist/lobbyist also appointed America's Health Human Services assistant secretary, according Journal. **But HHS spokesman tells Santa ""collaboration also get quote Ric Erwin, chairman Fraternal Order Real Bearded Santas ‚Äî called news ""extremely 12-minute phone call late August, Mr. Caputo told Mr. Erwin Santa group vaccines would likely approved mid-November distributed front-line workers Thanksgiving. ‚Äú**If colleagues essential workers, know is**,‚Äù Mr. Caputo said call, recorded Mr. Erwin provided Journal. [In audio call published Journal, Santa responds saying ""Ho ho ho ho, ho ho ho. love you.""]

... wtf ... That's best way it! idea anyone this.

I think 23 day offset correct though. People test positive days 3-15, basically. That's average ~9 days infection testing. infection death still median ~22 days want like 13 day offset. may precise either, point exponentially growing outbreak value make chart come really wonky, what's happening. Whereas flat case count offset matter. solution play around offset use graph stability ""determine"" best offset. know prevalence yet. Unless fully restrict travel, region locking limited benefit really. can't restrict travel anywhere US. best make inconvenient.

If selfish assholes going around maskless, house parties would dealt seriously would make much bigger impact virus. think optimist thinking get anti-masker thing (in fact, way get anything resembling enjoyable life universal masking). optimistic *can* get try follow programs done Asia. *not* optimistic wave end well. 

I think huge problem Americas many parts Europe government tries half assed lockdowns plan long periods time, much USA, people going get frustrated. Lockdown 6+ months realistic. policy looks like 6 week lockdown circuit breaker (AMD enforce it, strictly), using weeks build tracing infrastructure mask distribution faster testing avoid lockdowns. Pay restaurants bars stay closed. Etc. It‚Äôs lot effort, probably would save lot lives, also making future people safely enjoy large parts living. King tide storm I'm glad I'm person felt way. get rid dumb tradition already? Vietnam took straight serious day 1 soon news hit. Within week coronavirus task force ready, already rolling enforcement measures do. Understandably country much smaller, also far less resources say United States America. downloadable oxygen systems Charles county they're preparing ""phase 2"" opt-in in-person classes. Sounds fuckin' GREAT! .../s hope so!  Seems reasonable kids able save retirement spending money children praying they‚Äôll money retirement.

I good job project enough money retirement kids. Many people reasonable kids able save retirement spending money children praying they‚Äôll money retirement.

Humans fiscally optimizing robots. Humans wants (a common one children) needs fulfill regardless financial strain. Reddit minority strongly anti kids. That's fine norm. Yes, except isn‚Äôt. idiot ex teacher contracted socially (not school.) 3 kids live her. told quarantine home, isolate room. kids need stay inside house isolated her. times either one go back school based symptoms.

EXCEPT idiot school nurse misclassified kids exposed non household members according flow chart, green-lighted back school based exposure date. local Board Health called bus backlogged, likely won‚Äôt.

Me pointing school policy ex wife ended exactly expected, 3 kids back school, primed spread shit further. fucking mess. everyone man, I‚Äôm serious. think I‚Äôm kidding, people acknowledge exist insomuch they‚Äôll think chinese weapon common cold rebranded.

Feel lucky don‚Äôt live somewhere genuine thoughts half people around have. There's little indicate lasting ""immunity"" vast majority people. 45 million confirmed cases. going see every outlier imaginable.

If infected 45 million people flu (note, im saying flu anywhere near severe threat covid is), there's good chance small number could get reinfected within months even weeks. peoples bodies produce strong many antibodies. Chances people reinfected got biological short population, high degree individual variability antibody responses pathogen amount, type quality antibodies make.  people make many high quality antibodies good recognizing relevant antigen binding it. happens, virus rapidly bound antibodies eliminated even cause infection.  people make antibodies, they're effective binding pathogen. situation, antibodies provide partial protection: slow virus virus still cause degree infection. individuals usually exhibit symptoms shed virus longer period time.  also people either produce little poor quality antibodies. case, although people produce antibodies, immunity effective experience prolonged infection severe symptoms. also likely re-infected later point time.

COVID-19 very, likely special ability reinfect small percentage population. real trend here, would clear couple dozen even couple hundred; it'd million. zombie apocalypse begins... know talking to, needed this. Also autoimmune disease. Well pandemic going rough extroverts , people bad math people dislike conformity 

Call disease call affected community.

AIDS plague gays got general population consider similar pandemics? think last time pandemic that's really comparable 1918, effects economic turmoil muddled effects major world war.

AIDS affect lot people epidemic lasted long time, easier people take effective measures it. Ebola pretty drastic effects society hard-hit parts Africa, swamp world. original SARS seem much economic impact, less 9,000 cases. shithole country timeline Chinese officials reporting Internet. figurative dust settling happened couple months ago.

Maybe it‚Äôs America needs clear dust. Isn‚Äôt amazing China ‚Äúcorrupt, dishonest cruel‚Äù yet COVID basically over. Makes wonder much corrupt, dishonest cruel America must 2020 almost it‚Äôs ‚Äúrounding corner‚Äù yet another outbreak?

But yeah keep China hate strong /s Well Nebraska high tomorrow supposed 25 low 12, supposed get 2 3 inches snow point today.

That look place January kick expats out, least get look sitting plastic chairs day-in day-out? Less entertaining set, know... wasting time transferring take food cookie sheets reheating? wiping groceries? Ask whether Europe, Iran Russia well willingly sacrificing citizens sake changing American presidency. One 50 high ratio. many phases there?!? one, different time zone. looking good summer, getting winter, brings numerous viruses plenty sick people year. year, one virus...

For already mentioned - borders. Slovakia 1672 km border 5 different countries, battling Corona own, nutters... can, often must cross borders!

I presume wanted draw comparison Slovenia (where I'm from), 1080 km borders little bit sea, border 4 different countries, one Italy, another Croatia. would guess biggest thing us open borders Croatia. already prohibition events closed spaces Croatia, first spikes corona, night life full swing. want close live it. know goes Croatian sea summer - people Europe.

My point being, can't compare small island middle sea way populated countries middle Europe. Slovenia 2 million people 20k square kilometres NZ 5 million people 270k square kms. shut planes - make NZ people behave better? No, can't get anywhere even wanted to. came back Utah. may reason rates high. (Indoor dining open, masks) Can't hurt us. Yeah, people fall back line 'omg never ~said~ that', best Tegnell communicated extremely poorly herd immunity never goal, poorly hid was. also shows gaps shrinking time likely attributable worldwide transit supply chains, well limited ability record smaller scale outbreaks lost history.

The chance someone live pandemic also odd question. We‚Äôre living HIV lived ebola pandemics don‚Äôt much effect lives. high-quality sero-surveillance data, questions able answered certainty. possible biases population selection testing false-negative swabs due difficulties sampling children contribute existing findings. However, data far consistent across regions continue push evidence one direction. Sero-surveillance produced quickly despite ongoing studies due logistics mass blood sampling children global issues large-scale antibody testing quality control. meantime, schools remain closed policy-makers around world considering options releasing pressure lock-downs case numbers death start plateau fall. me? post this?

I'm sorry dealing own. kind days cereal pb&amp;j make bad mama all.

We've got this! ~~Nuclear~~Trumplier winter thanks Trump removing weakening protections would saved American lives. i'm still puzzled FDA approved Avigan (a similar antiviral) emergency use. recent study says even effective Remdesivir mild moderate cases. Given current 3rd wave surge fueled under-65 working population would seem better strategy administer Avigan higher risk ppl first find they're infected, waiting wind ER ICU week later. Illinois top 5! Let‚Äôs go!... oh wait. whole time...seeing  part no-mask  crowd initially. haven‚Äôt even reached winter weather

Where live? Lol Stop making numbers. 4% death rate. made 1-4% excess deaths statistic evidence. shooting hip scare people.

Countries locked month (or 4) massive resurgence. Trust me, lived UK lockdown. UK worse America now. place go purposefully get infected covid? methodology using cases, using ONS random sampling survey estimates infections community England Wales.

So accurate estimation IFR CFR.

I personally think seasonality could effect, know much research done  Yes Considering less fatal flu unless youre like 60+ (where becomes orders magnitude fatal) Id take chances Good thing holding freedom marches different cities towns!! That‚Äôll show virus boss!! Since I've watching numbers Germany, say numbers deaths/infection matched closely numbers got infected. long time ""only young get infected"", due fatalities low. reverting back normal, everybody bringing back families.

Unfortunately yet found timeline ages infected. **Your** post inconsistent ""basic Econ."" That‚Äôs country want live in. think confused. Western countries ones wanted grandma locked everyone else go spring break achieve herd immunity. weeks? Probably two. Halloween day superspreader events around country. largely due government advocating mask policy weeks ago. Saying masks minimal impact cause people feel false sense security. complete bs...

I mean false sense security really bs, especially many people also breathe nose, government trying educate people. masks PLUS social distancing. one other. too, grab 'em right draft pick good admitted election. Everyone vote! point retire wave metaphor. tide. 2020 script writers getting lazy. November 3rd 100k new cases 1k+ deaths.

actually hope happens lol lockdown. can't do, large events? What's open? makes huge difference. Bars? Restaurants full capacity? Even still voting independent/GOP back early 20's favor radical Healthcare reform.

We saw firsthand Grandma's last months intensive hospice care drained large part finances. i'm seeing 23k today worldometer, day looking at? FL relatively flat (although might change soon). outbreak mostly mid-west. likely reason school reopening keep failing inability make best choice child sad disappointing. stats, one player whose season ended.

I've barely left house since March flying tomorrow I'd miss huge business contract. 95% ... asymptomatic,.. real issue increasing ICU ... economic impact going last years US, definitely comparison made Great Recession.  There's plenty restrictions, especially large cities. forget football coaches making $10 million per year plus University supplied $500,000 houses. Easy keep borders shut, wait everywhere world burn ground rule world Australia. really think mask going make simply go away?

Do governors power mandate anything want? say I've said last weeks: time. waited election push change, are. Biden wins, even ambiguous within first days election, needs say ""I've won, given dangers administration presents, moving inaugurate now."" side made clear they're ready leave us dead. courts already ruled protections multiple states. wait January, facing pandemic rest decade. Yeah it‚Äôs accurate. know read? told check username still think person? thick be? think lifetime ban. confirm. One friends appendicitis vacation trip got air ambulance around ten years ago. end, received 50k bill. done 7 months ago. people start get used it. see people airports screaming freedom need take shoes   # cases important metric. Mortality rate (decreasing) key metric. 

I wear mask client facing close proximity strangers. Otherwise, forget it. I'm choking longer. areas NYC populations deal already burned virus. 

Hasidic Jews flare-ups last week, outside that, lot people skipping masks whether inside outside. 

That's countries understand Americans: much population assesses personal risks independent expert's decrees, like second opinion medical context. No. 

Because rest stores customers *wear masks*. 

Thats whole fucking point. Sorry microaggressions. realize would make impossible construct cogent point. low risk ins't risk.. given number people exposed one infectious person, chances one infected pretty high... granted mortality rate low, around 0.5% infected., one infected person easily spread hundred people. [ r rate 3, one infected person spreading it, infect three more, infect three more... takes steps numbers hundreds.]

This *why* spreading teh death toll increasing.

So, every infected person around mask.. kill two three people eventually. Biden team got tested regularly make result public tansparency. Reuters decided report Reddit thinks worth upvote. True specific situation could easily unfold west - ie. something packaged plant prepping frozen meals - staff plant positive virus gets packaging - packaging/food frozen virus - food delivered supermarket picked consumer  County seen sharp climb COVID-19 cases, two-week test positivity rate state‚Äôs ‚Äúdial‚Äù, tracks spread virus county, Safer Home designation three levels; Level 3 highest-risk level Stay Home measures week, Tri-County Health Department (TCHD), includes Adams County, announced new restrictions Adams Arapahoe counties.

Again, I‚Äôm NY, Cuomo‚Äôs made personal mission ensure positivity rates states. hear lot here.

Also NFL making part marketing? NFL branded masks gear advertising fining coaches don‚Äôt comply?

I feel like I‚Äôm missing something, might live.  ok forgive I've seen one man truly deserving medical exemption - nose replaced open wound caused form cancer! said fuck people trying find loopholes. Seriously. Women‚Äôs health backwards. Would shoved tennis ball man‚Äôs butt prostate issue. not, okay woman. point comment may poorly stated. said impossible Trump force states open. I'm saying possible cases already happened due lack federal support. even people symptoms necessarily high temperature.

Best luck you, read fuckin book once. sad. done since March? always headline. People value lives young people. gets again, mild symptoms, refuses isolate, spreads like crazy. Ahh yes, forgot like 800 people died location alone. Unfortunately, many Covid people also get hit flu time. Deaths rocket. I‚Äôve sick flu 12 days now, still worry pop ER again. It‚Äôs bad. Yes say one point time also said May Masks nothing..

From Politico wear reason believe effective**,‚Äù Fauci told CNN. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 100 percent effective. mean, it‚Äôs sort respect another person, person respect you. wear mask, wear mask, protect other.‚Äù

The complete opposite claimed said.

You left following NEJM quote clearly adds chance catching Covid-19 passing interaction public space therefore minimal. 

I'm sure honest oversight part. Even gave links since cant look whatever reason...

What even ""burden proof""? 100% wrong Dr. Fauci said masks. Shocking. Fauci ""What clear, however, universal masking alone panacea. mask protect providers caring patient active Covid-19 it‚Äôs accompanied meticulous hand hygiene, eye protection, gloves, gown. mask alone prevent health care workers early Covid-19 contaminating hands spreading virus patients colleagues.""

Not sure included Fauci quote since he's even mentioned NEJM article posted need point NEJM article pertains healthcare workers HOSPITALS general public? 

So ask, got link Fauci saying masks nothing failed tremendously first attempt. No, like national reactionary policy virus killed 200 000 surprised, like America known things protects lives citizens.

If say Nah like reinfection case would purely symbolic since would unenforceable 

Look federal government enforcing illegal immigration marijuana use Doubt it, I'd expect week Halloween superspreader parties, another surge inviting grandparents Covidgiving. level insanity Northern Idaho ridiculous. classmate lives Sandpoint. Young, decently smart, got engineering masters degree. Facebook feed turned pure unadulterated trash. know what's air area Meanwhile Illinois, 2 million less people, reporting 5k cases day. still study properly... covid uses cd-147 ace-2 proteins infect body. Hydroxychloroquin blocks cd-147 route ace-2 receptor. need take ace-2 inhibitor (high dose zinc example) conjunction Hydroxychloroquin. still proper prophylactic study using treatments simultaneously...

These 2 treatments conjunction effective SARS 10 years ago lab settings. never learn. Even getting Cain killed, press on...unbelievable unnecessary sucks, classes that.

Here's Braille.

.:..:::.: .:...::::.:.:  ok let put another way. put mask mandate place, people still wear yells Tyranny louder they'll think justified. still wrong, they'll point mandate go 'see, told you! Tyranny!' 

Well, yes, incorrect. telling people live, telling stop fucking killing people spreading infectious disease. seems point fail get.

Oh sweetie, vast majority people low risk. That's dramatic. Give two weeks. Thing is, everyone truly bought instead folks asshats, would brought levels far enough inadequate testing response might enough... could functionally like Europe.

Problem is, politicized folks scientifically illiterate, also message ""it kills old people"" delivered population includes younger generations primed anti-old folks memes (""ok b****r"") really good compliance distancing, ever.

It easy, easy, fucking reality face head-on understand means vector. Mask mandates, even legally possible, nothing address fact people live homes with... people. Many people often times.

Virus continue spread. There‚Äôs nothing anybody it. It‚Äôs like yelling rain. agree, i‚Äôm entirely sure high compliance would be. addition already doubtful would say ‚Äúwell institute now!?‚Äù another note, bothers fatigue masks starting get bad live, particularly people compliant want know ‚Äúwill forever?‚Äù think mandate happened earlier, don‚Äôt think reception great amongst good amount people. really hard considerate others? Four sentences gibberish, yes.

It's fairly common people attack individual rather content comments. 

It's called intellectually dishonest Wearing mask falls somewhere jay walking already illegal, see problem is.

So wearing mask.

Oh well. know. Walking house would count anything far quarantine/contact tracing. Even people virus likelihood contracting peice candy handled person minimal. Exposure seems low. areas country nice weather people sit outside leave candy there.... many ways safe way. Kids need go small groups pods already exposure with.

 feel like kids need taken away I'm sure college students 20 something's going party anyways....which WAY dangerous wear mask, one makes wear correctly. work retail pharmacy every single day people come nose, pull speak me, even take completely counter. don‚Äôt see point even wearing point, literally protecting? one. understand mean? strategic. Biden campaign saying ""Hey remember big dum-dum didnt wear mask half administration got covid? Well never got it. know, still dont it."" People close contact someone testing positive need test quarantine purposes. everyone gets test actually sick displaying symptoms. dumb article posted months ago Ontario modified Stage 2 hotspots, even whole province. Even article linked Quebec talks 'partial lockdown'. Also, contrary popular belief, Ontario Quebec entirety Canada...

Perhaps person different definition they're referring 'lockdown', experience people mean full shutdowns, everyone's working home, grocery stores open. Cheers!

Im sure that's OP using though Poland listed either. 

What also surprises extremely well handling coronavirus (e.g. Vietnam). look forward drunk drivers people enjoy randomly firing shotguns air apply exemptions permit endanger fellow citizens think that's invisible sky wizard wants.  shouldn‚Äôt pick much. Lots people unjustified fear children‚Äôs health.

We love kids fear mongers scared us fuck cares tests negative? fuck post here? They're way positive states! thoughts prayers effect. wonder they'll learn that's good thing. standards! Must lick boot corporate gods cost! big money man says goes, matter what! lowly workers, literally keep business running, must live die boss, silly forgetting :) 

It take big money business. 

It takes risk. takes drive. takes control baser instincts. argument bizarre naive.

Your boss seems agree right safety jobs. 

They do? batshit crazy lol

I'm idiot employees trying make decisions. sure unions really grind gears huh? Workers rights?? 

I really care like greedy assholes getting little uppity taste! dare think matter.

What great opportunity start business run things exactly want.

But people wearing mask much risk you, I'd assume risks required start business light-years beyond. r/iamverybadass post exhibits fair amount antagonism. indicates additional discussion beneficial either us. doesn‚Äôt matter, can‚Äôt say one group right protest doesn‚Äôt. Ohio too. Everyone tired/bored acting like went away. might get bored COVID, doesn‚Äôt get bored you. we‚Äôre posting huge numbers every day, county among growing amount ‚Äúin red‚Äù terms cases.

SW OH fucked. old boss texted bunch us go lunch, I‚Äôm like, dude case numbers spiking wanna go out? strategy fundamentally different Europe's, we've failed margins reasons entirely related COVID-19 approach specific. wasn‚Äôt Sturgis 2 half months ago? don‚Äôt get keeps getting brought up.

Maybe taxed religion people would stop using excuse total morons and/or bigots. everyone way, waaaaay many do. get point agree conditions potential scary outcome (especially since much likely death) . However, can't really state life-long conditions, cleared ~8 months since people began recovering. lack empathy unless affects directly trademark republicans. Politicians staunchly anti-gay kid comes them, think covid hoax spend 13 days icu, etc

I family member (die hard republican) rough patch making shit money paid time benefits kind. complains barely get never take days off.

Stopped talking told there‚Äôs political party fighting kinds things. Sure, need say 1000 people \*confirmed\* antibodies 12 months ago, order make call long antibodies last. best chance probably finding earliest people test seropositive Lombardy Wuhan spring, test Q1 2021. People test October 2019 even circulated, chance would e.g. blood donor samples - enough those. fuck ups issues. It‚Äôs picking wrong strategy, spite rest world, refusing it. I‚Äôm proud strategy nonetheless

Yes, that‚Äôs brainwashed. take account never get everything back way without controlling virus. elderly ""weak"" afraid continue usual. us caretakers people. would love get things say, kill loved one virus. 'cost' calculated time. cost lockdown would much higher. whole point overwhelm available resources. hospital capacity, every new patient untreatable. Whereas patient load spread out, many people treated saved (not covid, emergency medical procedures). that, vaccine development takes time, stagger cases many fewer lives lost vaccine available.

 Lockdown buys time. needs contact tracing measures like masks frequent testing. countries implemented measures well. lockdown completely within month two. Infact better contact tracing, wore masks diligently might needed partial lockdown achieve case load full lockdown. Think like filter, 6 layers filters better protection layer thick. US, layer lockdown (the messaging masks screwed + politicization masks). 

I agree you, full lockdown without measures work. happened lockdown + mitigation. lockdown measures worst response. One wanna kill millions, doesnt.

One protesting getting beat fuck existing, protesting resturants open 2 hours. can‚Äôt naive, you? Schools primary reason seeing recent surge US. 

There also heavily seasonal component virus,but school definitely reason. 

It took approximately 4-6 weeks cases build steam. Children went school year relatively cases, takes time build. First week 1 kid, second week 2, third week 4, forth week 8, fifth week 16, 6th week 32 on, pretty soon start see problem. 

Meanwhile parents rest community start show positive. 

You also lot parents testing kids don‚Äôt want kid one responsible class quarantine football game canceled. 

So infections schools begin take schools act pretty large reservoir virus.

This virus related viruses cause common cold, kids catch pass on, maybe asymptomatic mild symptoms don‚Äôt get tested, help spread virus. live cook county feel like surrounded idiots. would guess cause rural areas spread getting sick would pretty hard.. non whites get hit harder also rural areas white people. ""Herd immunity"" eeek Thanksgiving sucked pre-COVID, too. decent government take care everyone lost jobs, there'd homelessness BLM protests encouraged social distancing wearing masks. Meanwhile China, crowded restaurants, crowded tourists attraction spots, crowded streets, crowded malls, people wearing masks, everything normal.... pandemic over... there. percent people actually reinfected? find handful cases, results seem pretty mixed worse asymptomatic 2nd time. heres optimism Yeah it‚Äôs scary :/ Wow, denying encourage genocide Swedes either.  BMI absolutely fine assessment health risk long include bodyfat percentage factor. Without that, flawed.

Dismissing entirely 'BS' little OTT. Meanwhile, extended family gathering today event. They've taking many risks whole time, luck going run sooner later. That's population town live in... Every day. That's insane. plenty articles say otherwise. mean Tajikstan. Turkmen doesn‚Äôt border China Yes Rural Michigan ignorant cesspool. hate it. Right. Actually friend meant *30*. Think it. escalating badly Europe right now.. Grants encourage fracking! wouldn‚Äôt flood market even gas, demand long Covid rise? Election year early comparisons flu making people already question virus ‚Äúall bad‚Äù even hoax. It‚Äôs sad took. banking Trump bad time Covid (ICU bad) still making supporters could see virus isn‚Äôt something joke about, still continue experience possibly loved ones, it‚Äôs always moments 180s. feel last part may way people realize bad virus be, regardless many accounts damage certain organs. even doesn‚Äôt sway people least wear mask, don‚Äôt know will. We‚Äôre stuck plague-ship carousel there‚Äôs way off. worry winter üò¢ remember one time 1980s one day 50s high temperature sunny dry air cold front came man amazing. first day thought I'd like live grew up. think one group allowed protest spread virus agree you? like late October middle April winter lol Family members supposed unless patient 18. let one in. happen patient needs assistance front doors bed. Family members help us get bed wheelchair. it‚Äôs hands deck, Need much help get. kick family member out. takes resources people. Sometimes don‚Äôt people available. live Sweden, yes. keep repeating density naive sense (people divided area) useless measure, matter much forest 0 people country has, matters average distance people. measure thats readily available, ""level urbanization"" far better measure ""population density"" want measure density matters virus (distance people).

Sweden one \*urbanized\* countries world. is, live fewer larger cities, rather more/smaller cities villages. American way Assuming modest one percent death rate, there‚Äôs least 800 dead Americans day. fully expect see 1,000+ deaths day couple weeks. Evil Evil does. mean they've literally released details every case, think hiding? Bunch navel gazing.

People going stop dating, kissing sex. 
The human reproductive drive overrides everything else. 


I dated AIDS thing. blood tests unprotected sex. 


Actually college birth control pill AIDS. wonderful thing big blip 'how many partners had' quiz. imagine horniest life unlimited willing partners. I'm good looking anything. Maybe 7. But, Football team wins, get laid.  Frat party alcohol, get laid. Halloween party, get laid. wonderful time.  However one things passed mind day got married was: ""Yes! made it. Married STDs"" :)

Anyway, point is, temporarily slow down. urge mate cant stopped edit say intending? 3 million? Cases equal hospitalizations deaths. increased infections lead increases them, indicate direction virus going, sufficient rate break contact tracing/isolation systems prevent people getting sick dying.

For example, summer, July 6th US surged new records reported cases (over 50k 7 day average) precisely deaths lowest (about 500 7 day average, days 200s). 1 month new cases lowest since March, 7 day average 20k.

There two major narratives pushed time. One surge cases matter, result increased testing, relatively low death rate day showed things much better worsening, boasting lowest death rate world sunbelt hit large wave death mostly evaded spring. 

The second came people understood infections surging, low death rate reflected earlier low infection rate, lag cases deaths hospitalizations. Sure enough, less month later deaths surged 1100 daily average since deaths never reached lows early July. 

A surge cases vital sign happens next. Feels, 13k Poland yesterday :( anyone worried Worldometer running non stop Trump ads? like mexican wave covid doesn‚Äôt affect rabble. affects everyone. guess disproportionally killed poor black population more, couldn‚Äôt predicted that.

I feel like could another card play. Instead mutual win everyone (wearing masks, fewer people dying), wanted issue take stand against. It‚Äôs like agree disagree, except isn‚Äôt fucking children‚Äôs book. You‚Äôre always rounding bend you‚Äôre going circles.  think it‚Äôs waist height ratio considered better ü§î One side wanna kill millions, othwr doesnt. I'm disagreeing algorithmic social media significant impacts society, I'm disagreeing anything symptom fundamental problem. Or? They‚Äôre pumping numbers leasing back logged data make sure certain someone looks bad. Dude, lived PA moved NJ. hardest hit areas country initially. states know works doesn't. choose ignore based govt vote out. not, family sphere influence worry about. I'm going worry population largely indifferent society altering pandemic. Incognito trick stopped working...  boo. many people suffering dying right one wants anything. feel like I‚Äôm stuck wonderland it‚Äôs bizarre surreal. Never million years think would turn like February. empathy country go? :( UK here. We're pretty screwed too. USA USA USA USA üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ Used ‚Äúall thumbs‚Äù insult. Looks like could use more. also currently hit hardest rural areas right now, yes? Given communities negatively impacted healthcare hospital access issues likely rate would higher compared bigger cities impacted far. much idea attention span right figure sure enjoy thinking ways guestimates wrong. UK's suffering problem US - poor leadership conservatives! Rounding corner almost like Sweden danger litterally everyone, population brainwashed stop goverment something done schools. Winter help though. matter case? thought virus. Yes, thank you. context comment heard news today. That's largely due government advocating mask policy weeks ago. Saying masks minimal impact cause people feel false sense security. complete bs... we're flu season ü§íüò© point numbers mean anything anymore. companies lot pension payments laughing. literally said we've fucked up, I'm proud strategy nonetheless. would've preferable far issues did, I'm blind issues long shot.

Call brainwashed that's make easier deal opinion. incorrect. vaccine causes pain injection site placebo not, direct side effect vaccine. need know things full list side effects. covers company's butt keeps patient well informed possible.

It make sense compare another vaccine, vaccines varying side effects patients.

It's uncommon participants guess one got. people experience side effects, mean get real thing.

That participate, still need follow recommendations behaving without vaccine. Death option. people life long chronic conditions brain fog respiratory conditions. hey 5% people dying cool get right? think it‚Äôs bit different (I know sounds bit hypocritical) there‚Äôs religious aspect it. Like, guys already intimate living together agreeing get married that‚Äôs one thing.


But, Mormons aren‚Äôt allowed go one one dates (I mean vast majority friends including weren‚Äôt). go group dates get married, they‚Äôre allowed intimidated, god forbid move together marriage. So, usually get engaged prompted god (hormones). think that‚Äôs bigger recipe disaster experience. restrictions 1%

That number much higher 64 cases today. That's one worst days we've far. considered positive HK, confirmed twice row using PCR test independently. Sweden ban large events early March? Also no. 

Well, difference 2 weeks (15th vs 27th march) Norway Sweden. could make huge difference I'm completely agreeing Sweden quicker react here. 

This, like things mention together adds lax ""late"" strategy. example shutting schools older children. I'm saying Sweden anything differently. I'm saying massive difference neighboring countries, gradual difference. important areas Sweden acted quicker decisively many countries (For example, rules around sick leave support compabies, enable people actually *follow* restrictions). 
I'm arguing Sweden right thing al respects, I'm saying radically different, ""experiment"". reason republicans politicized promoting condom use AIDS crisis. desperately want ""the rabble"" die. 36 Seattle We're definitely rounding corner... Coincidentally, state highest positive case count yesterday well. top doc broke tears daily press briefing. county broke highest positive case count twice last week. math right, 

1 person per football field == 187 people / sq. kilometer

North Dakota: 9.2 / sq km, 1 person per 19.2 football fields

New Brunswick: 10.5/ sq km, 1 person per 17.8 football fields still know single person thing. Big nothing-burger lmao.

Also, still voting Trump. üòÅ  end.... screwed. Weird directly correlated opening things up. limiting exposure others something low infections...

Weird. source that? MD california? ND? Yeah. 

It's like firemen standing watching stuff burning house, go like ""we put fire got big really hard stop it.""

Imagine called fire departmen like ""floor 6 burning"" like ""call us 3 floors burning, nuthing one floor."" People ages getting sick. Obviously know they're personally. public though, rarely see anyone wearing mask. Social distancing seems followed part well. appear helping point. guess though. many tests? guess, combination incubation period last infected people lockdown infections continue within home people locked together. people infected home incubation time test positive. Add effects delayed reporting results places reduced testing weekends get close two weeks Maybe stop smoking much POT fear coronavirus way do. studies done summer surge, must much higher percentage now.

Nobody really knows sure, think millions deaths debunked, it‚Äôs like ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù on/off switch. could reaches...40 percent, I‚Äôm throwing random number out, slows significantly circulates years, slowing reaches 80 percent.

Also, people Reddit seem really agree herd immunity actually always say ‚Äúherd immunity never achieved without vaccine‚Äù. pattern described above, natural herd immunity never going ELIMINATE virus...although think eventually expectations set virus never ELIMINATED COVID doesn‚Äôt care you‚Äôre scared not, virus never gets fatigued. huge fan vaccines I'm getting injected trump fluid untill countries ok it. Belgium, Spain Italy hit early time prepare. UK tried batshit insane experiment Sweden backed out, sure I'll give US UK may handled even worse. France isnt almost higher all.

All countried faaar dense Sweden. reason delayed bill supposed provision (I forget phrase, something like 'closely related group people') 20% company, receive stimulus funds. idea husband (let's call Jared maybe Jr) owned 20% company, want transferring 3% wife qualify stimulus money.

Except somehow phrasing conveniently ""overlooked"" tye Senate version, supposedly due ""clerical error"".  Dems held signing -- hours! -- get language back in.

Also, note voluminous right-wing outrage wheb Dems delayed original stimulus hours. contrast absolute silence Republicans held back *months*. respect protection protect others? Neither provide adequate protection virus. Surgical masks work better protecting others since doctors use protect patients pathogens they're infected with. Hand hygiene also extremely important doctors practice. Oh I'm sure excluded lot things going forward. big army ever shrinking wealth enough make nations want handcuff lunatic anymore. relatively well. Surely now, sufficient PPE available restricted working (known) Covid patients Mayflower leaked, late fall, still crossed Atlantic. 

Either first American colonists crazy, Britain bad. both. 

It‚Äôs probably both. they're right thing. rest wlr√∂d acting like shit Was. reopened, school started, people stopped caring. dating subreddits full people still dating, albeit many taking sort precautions, ie outdoor dates only, zoom screenings first, ect. 

I found new relationship pandemic antimasker all. Relative US, yes! Rural iowa getting fucked right now, rural hospitals full transferring covid patients ICUs biggest cities I'm thinking can't find evidence backup claim 30 million deaths start see guns showing hospitals now. Even spread increasing, doesn‚Äôt mean virus actually large threat. 99%+ age groups 70+ band survive COVID. 70+ band still survives greater 96% rate. Yes great job stopping virus. linked article said much.

Lockdowns don‚Äôt eliminate virus, maybe don‚Äôt understand that? Lockdowns stop exponential spread need followed carefully reopening massive testing, tracing isolating cases. That‚Äôs addition social hygiene hand washing, masks distancing. 

Spain many countries states US failed reopen carefully. doesn‚Äôt mean lockdowns don‚Äôt work. I'm sorry think actual Socialism better system current one(s) delusional. comical likely 0 experience actual socialist/communist system born position people would trade instant think good option. think many millions dead due systems would heavily disagree. system good send tanks foreign countries enforce build walls cities keep people separated. 

And save ""not real communism"" arguments, one thing german said book another actually happened dozens countries. pal. respond something predictable like ""And great life living bubble scared."" 

Did that? sense empathy lacking skipping one Thanksgiving pandemic means complete coward.

First whos ""their"" 

Well count ever day last huh? Besides Thanksgiving Christmas?

Nah personality makes seem like cowards lol. Sorry - yes meant wear masks avoid gatherings people. agree hope ban fracking. Put solar farms. Bismarck, ND gets 1,000 yearly sunshine hours Munich, Germany, yet Germany utilizes ton solar power.

Why dig ground there's literally free energy falling sky day long? I'm saying confidence schools opening based reality. Take pick states. Since there's significant amounts virus running rampant countries, countries allow internal flights, guess there's reason allow international flights two countries. Thailand? What's TTI? Like personal information? One conservative premiers caught public numerous times without mask on, base province highly anti mask. anti mask rallies same.  information folks getting sick, mask use like people around them? yeah know. Politics always say *trust people* play rules even higher numbers keep saying this. todays weekend numbers 11k nearly half labs germnay send numbers weekend.on tuesday/wednesday guess we'll 20k new cases day. said 20k/day go lockdown. understand wait till reach number. definitly come. acting early? stupid sad Okay buddy, said, xenophobia allowed State Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms said oil companies hit hard price drop resulting pandemic, leading slow work state's oil fields.

This partly false claim. Oil prices tanked prior pandemic Russia/OPEC feud. pandemic kept prices low. manufacturer work negatively affected oil prices began end last year. Sierra Club, however, called ‚Äútotally inappropriate‚Äù put $1.25 billion state received coronavirus rescue package toward ‚ÄúA direct subsidy payment oil companies drill oil outrageous,‚Äù said Wayde Schafer, spokesman organization North Dakota.

Exploration won‚Äôt happen oil prices remain low. Subsidies aren‚Äôt going anything go directly oil executives pockets. European countries populations similar single US state. comparisons bit silly since even US states way hard hit others. Google 'us covid numbers' see graph. Looks like third wave however never recovered previous 2 waves. bottom second wave higher first wave's peak. opinion, death per capita ten times higher Norway? would statistically mean well 5 million die this. There‚Äôs difference fatigue pretending like doesn‚Äôt exist. nyc worse anywhere remain vigilant haven‚Äôt many noticeable outbreaks. would never want part gatherings. 

I'm 100% sure barley season food think salty.  Somehow makes sense nowadays less people dying Italy. hope North Dakota gets together soon. I'm Saskatchewan like visiting state. way, different guys. bars still open (they be) clubs starting outbreaks (surprise!), think provincial election premier might grow pair mandate masks indoors. frustrating I've stop spread stay home months, yet nightclubs open massive community spread going come those. 

Stay vigilant. Maybe leaders state province pull heads asses point. would much rather live US there. work(ed) live entertainment industry technical side, something I'd done almost entire working life disappeared, basically overnight. right gig bookings (big arena shows, theatre shows, corporate events) moved back year summer 2021 earliest. magic vaccine gigs scheduled happen get rebooked, events works *years* can't get replanned.

It's minimum wage part-timers sit around retail office things get 'back normal', middle-class level wages salaries disappeared. niche technical knowledge currently desperately retraining industries. rental houses selling inventory, supply chains folding. local gig venues getting turned Starbucks downtown theatres getting turned condos. multibillion dollar industry probably never look same.

So people moved office home never took paycut, never noticed real economic change life - Hell, might even *saved* money due commute every day - come year two wonder live entertainment gone there's nobody around put shows, feel single lick sympathy them.

This kind turned bit rant/tangent, really loved industry job think people realize screwed things are. please stop gawking quantity infections instead represent figures infections per million? 

The US still shit show, means nothing say ""90k infections"" without taking relative population. fascinates LDS church requested members comply mask-use social distancing church, yet outside Utah seems steaming hot mess COVID denialism. literally place else send people.... ""Cases"" metric mean much hospitalizations deaths. Case numbers increase without spike hospitalizations deaths if:

- Testing increased

- low-risk demographic makes bulk infections

- Treatment improves

Those three things CFR much higher April today. Daily case numbers relatively low April, agree pandemic much severe now?

Case numbers completely meaningless, also assume 1:1 correlation deaths. live area rarely, ever, see someone wearing mask. Numbers still keep going sharply up. Masks seem making difference sadly. Maybe everyone start realizing non-lethal COVID record high case posts. couple Journal articles topic read years ago inconclusive link earthquakes fracking. areas like Oklahoma strong correlation locations activities, mote areas correlation. could fracking caused it, could also local instability materials cracked present, combination local instabilities leading materials track combined fracking caused it. years since looking could date info I'm unaware of. found uncle everyone secretly wishes wouldn‚Äôt come thanksgiving dinner. Complete fearmongering? Really?

Tool mask wearer, surrounded non-maskers. confirm. Wow look smart person virus airborne- unfortunately evidence eating restaurants risky activity. citied CDC one riskiest activities. agree need ok risk assessments people make themselves, including parents- parents need ok concerned. Also, life doesn‚Äôt need put hold- take eating outdoors options less risky. Except antivaxxers small minority till media attention blew up, IMO. Irresponsible journalism (aka yellow journalism) propaganda disservice body politic. Yes many epidemiologists predicted seven figure death toll since beginning. It‚Äôs definitely question. Especially given don‚Äôt know long going last bad winter going be. Early signs pretty grim cases hospitalizations already started surge early fall cold season. Exactly, pandemic exacerbated existing problem, cause. virus push people poverty, decisions made ruling elite system people live do. thought Canada relatively well..? ""Let say this. need make sure proper mitigation factors, whether therapies vaccines treatments, make sure people die this. suggest going actually quarantine America ""No one's saying that.""

Also, reads like ""Narrator: "" memes

Trump admin: ""everyone saying...""

Narrator: "" one actually saying this"" states? America's shit bed state mean one amount average. coronavirus nothing flu, many cases even dangerous flu.

Substantiate us please? makes think flu dangerous COVID-19? Increasing positivity rates big one. lagging indicator see hospitalization deaths uptake too. China Taiwan: it! No, it‚Äôs here, power. do, like governor Michigan, get attacked politically almost physically. Last year got coal Christmas. year, Covid? Yeah, pretty wild much gaslighting going on. Keep doing. numbers lie. Right now, Malaysia Myanmar cases two. interesting see things develop there, hopefully get control. Belgium, Spain, UK, Italy higher death rate Sweden. Soon France well. I'd say open many Western countries regarding spreading takes place.

Where West fails: Spreading details TTI, TTI status, population cooperativeness, social groups high prevalence, motivation. 

All upmost importance population, yet try hide much socially tolerated - outbreak becomes large, go public, cases case numbers rough locations.

Also, proliferation details vaccine creation &amp; production promised, everything happens behind closed doors. researches &amp; production experts able learn others, looks, happen anywhere. There‚Äôs stupid, there‚Äôs Trump-Administration-level stupid. Stop. right side fence already. let see affect what's real. reality need take seriously, like December/January. Everyone, mean **everyone** needs mask social distance. need make every conscious effort eradicate pest daily lives. 

Anyone plague society. defining reason we're right now. refuse listen try protect around them. like people. Continue better. Please. Vote like life depends it. Yes Available numbers show miserably failed. European countries strictest lockdown measures mandatory mask wearing passing Sweden infections deaths per million. Oh will. airport crams us tiny planes. alone makes want stay home afterwards. ""Why get control the¬†pandemic?*¬†  ""Because contagious¬†virus like flu.""*

Newsflash people, disease contagious, contain it. name, see, contagious. Contagious disease cannot contained. viral virus disease transmissible, would try contain it. hope learned something.

*MEADOWS: ""What need make sure¬†that proper¬†mitigation factors, whether it's¬†therapies vaccines or¬†treatments, make sure that¬†people die this.""*

Ehm. Therapies treatments? Nothing effective point. Vaccines? yet, hopefully coming eventually. Make sure people die this? 784 people died yesterday, bit late party. thing left mitigation, want bother apparently. Even go 0.02% 20-49 year-olds still particularly terrifying *individual* level. That‚Äôs even better.

Although US response, maybe it‚Äôs surges end? actually stop disease *some* point get waves, right? recently moved Chicago Dupage County. Good Lord. many folks acting like exist. funny countries reactions become similar - exact thing Denmark.

Next step banning sale alcohol bars close, minimize number people keep partying afterwards. ""The evidence far conclusive, much research tarnished flaws data collection analysis. School reopenings much work progress.""

Ya like believing things, huh? Rounding bend right toward thick record infections. leaders continue grift avoid responsibility dealing pandemic. scroll bit comment...I wondering odds country reported 88,973 new infections 8:30 pm Friday 8:30 pm Saturday, figures showed, substantially previous day's 79,963.

Yeah, headline writer. That's works. GG assume existing savings mean we‚Äôll agree disagree suppose tell county (about 450k) getting tests. primary reason happening Europe too. GTFO. Okay. rich get richer,

The poor get picture SARS actually, MERS. SARS really touch us Korea (am long-term American ex-pat Korea personally) MERS nasty little cluster fuck 2015 good wake-up call lead start Korea's tracing system. Korea also took swine flu lot seriously lot countries good practice well.

As larger point, yes virus hard trace lot people infected somehow Korea managed it. NASTY super spreader cult Daegu spread hundreds sick cult members back February world nothing virus. bastards lied church members, went hiding, etc. etc. took real herculean effort put back bag took worked life mostly back normal middle March never lock down.

The specifics different tactics important acting FAST. Korea government started developing stockpiling tests January although taken guard initial big cult outbreak February moved fast contained it, even barely.

I think helped lot sheer panic. cult outbreak BIG, far far far away biggest outbreak outside China time scared fuck people (memories MERS certainly helped that) got people wear masks socially distance fast without real government enforcement besides suggestions lot cases. example restaurants ordered shut emptied shutter business six weeks despite never getting order (would've pointless keep open customers would shown up). We've playing wack-a-mole small outbreaks ever since two major superspreader outbreaks since then. take beat far good. Back one case per million per day moment hopefully stay there. lock up. Together Hillary Hunter Biden guess. reply *just few* aren‚Äôt thinking Nordics? planning coming back Sweden 25th place say *well it‚Äôs Nordic neighbours..*??

The point discussion people relation Sweden vent spite and/or frustration regards nations response, nothing else. since March, guess people home bored lonely lot godforsaken year. Might SK's main export partners some.. coronavirus issues. ? move decimal two places % ages multiplying. 99.98% = .9998 100% = 1. yes, .0002 correct case. much? No, 0.2% overall. much lower young people. Donny magically got better three days. begs question ever really got considering obese ass old age. Well total cases also way higher There's discrepancies two nothing lab noticed I'm aware of. honestly matter. Throughput king. swabs, reagents working analyzer test getting run. Sure, consensual.  Ugh swede dont understand anyone defend govts choices this? friends family here. got absolutely fucked compared denmark finland norway, zero excuse that. saying scandinavian countries catch belief, wheres evidence? arent getting anywhere close.  


My parents cancer heart problems lost least whole year maybe next year too, virus govts handling it. cant see people, see grand children, friends, travel, even go grocery shopping. Every blood test scans cancer anxious bc nurses refuse friggin wear masks. Ill never forgive L√∂fven buddies this. bad idea stock case, also think naive think leadership country inclination political impose lockdowns again. really feels like anti-science folks won.

I think cases spiking now, deaths spike 3-4 weeks. pretty likely vaccine candidate near approval point. Even though (1) vaccine efficacy may mediocre (2) distribution take MANY months that, news vaccine jumped justify shutting down.

And regardless outcome election, admin remain vocally anti-lockdown least January *possible* we'll peaceful transition power.

In short, governors local leaders active shutting far justification incentive continue business usual. believe family members, friends ""church friends"" end hospital? family friends hoax? Why? developing countries risking massive food shortages due global economic recession?

Oh, they're brown people white boomers, course care them. /s  got pretty bad spike back. Sucks learn things hard way. ever comment?

Clearly state actor troll working behalf Chinese government.

Your comment inspired remind everyone China commuting genocide. intake side, thing viral load. virus get, sicker get.

I'm assuming thing happens end? mere presence antibodies indicate numbers strong enough fight disease?

Straight counts would allow us trend project long last Stop second grade critical thinking reading comprehension skills. Population control, earth can‚Äôt sustain us. mention Hawaii? doing? Small island nation (nz size UK way...with 6 times tourists per capita UK...pre covid), Hawaii 1.4 million around 10 times ( even going mention deaths per capita) deaths NZ, difference leader USA orange buffoon legal restrictions number people gather. maximum number 50 long time. subset things (e.g. cultural events) recently expanded 300. 50 still general rule. law breaking take court. 


Beyond ""recommendations"", recommendations actually practice legal standing. restaurants ""recommended"" keep least 1 distance groups. break recommendation forcibly closed. Recommendations binding pertain businesses organizations.

Recommendations private individuals legally binding, generally seen restrictions. Personally met friends since february. What's safest way see family christmas? seen since last summer miss miss crazy ton too. I'm LA they're Kansas want reason get covid fly there, 2600 mile roundtrip drive four days driving. Flying round trip would $400 gasbuddy says driving would $270 gas would need hotel rooms twice cause 20 hour drive. Let's drill new wells instead cleaning ones already drilled promised we'd clean up.

G^eriactric O^ld P^erverts mentality way. People keep mind severity disease plays part. People got sick, longer lasting antibodies. People got little bit asymptomatic, couple months most. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm also sure led people indoor gatherings, people dining open, shopping, etc. 

Many people know Bay older apartments homes without benefit good ac keep temps (back super smoky also supper hot) good windows really keep smoke out. 

Hopefully whatever behavior sticks around enough get damn rain too. life turned shitty doesn‚Äôt mean well. well , CARE family member other's well . want indirectly kill parents , would ? infected mean doom , can't work , neighbor get quarantine , eveyone hate , eveyone look report people hide travel history harm Good judgy superior attitude. 

If people willing go restaurants apparently okay risk, concerned. high risk stay home. high risk live anyone is. area also relatively low rates covid. convince anyone wear masks? care covid. making news Pence's staff tested positive, probably like ok whatever. people statistically end surviving covid, Pence going get great top notch medical care. Nothing terrible happen staff. may even symptoms. WH pushing herd immunity, sort fits narrative go life, get get it, dangerous. anything, people get infected recover stray fewer wear masks take precautions all. going think ""immune"".  Winter time virus‚Äô summer time. going flourish cold. Idk. It‚Äôs unlikely it‚Äôs going change much. Certainly nordics hasn‚Äôt changed slightest. somewhere like India Argentina ends hardly changes things purposes discussion Oh, well...just ask! critique wipe down. Thanks, yeah I've following numuves' videos. Uyghur skateboarder's reaction hilarious asked whether would like sponsored. skating lol sure tired hearing this, sorry loss dude. sure Canada, Toronto region want talk whatever let know. using form SD Biosensor http://sdbiosensor.com/xe/product/7672 afternoon took family live rugby game pub curry pint. spent $200 pub packed. yeah, tanking economy... hope alright. lapsing 2-3 times mean? Poor Biden got rekt COVID-19! Wow. Nah, idiot. Vaccine masks different. 

If read link posted, civil rights lawyers believe mask exemptions basis religion upheld. DM want talk, nobody feel way That's crazy! think mean Sweden 30 years ago. neoliberal agenda politics almost 30 years lot unregistered people people multiple identities. Also people working slave like conditions. Many working nursery homes don‚Äôt education don‚Äôt know language. It‚Äôs impossible try contain infection situation.

Besides, death rates Stockholm 10 times high parts country areas death rates level neighbors. 3-4 months maybe 12-18 go. I‚Äôm wondering many people investing hard scoreboard certain change. care though. pushing herd immunity, well narrative virus big deal harmless. Nobody died thus far, even someone end dying, would spin say person pre-existing conditions something. don't, myopic idiot. guess... give 7 days celebrate envy nobody professional sports right lol going spin say virus big deal fine ignore get it, get it. likely fine (statistically speaking) they, like Trump, say mild symptoms grateful got could immune. WH pushing toward herd immunity sort fits narrative. Yup, Korea well whole thing well. MERS rest well.

Ah, guess wrong tracking info. following message alert spam recently days honest. used sign-in sheets constantly seen QR codes, although drink coffee...

As far specifics tracking second major church outbreak blocks (idiots spraying salt water other's mouth ""cure"" virus whole church got infected) terrified it'd spread local neighborhood like wildfire, especially people church bought groceries place etc. etc. even though many people church it, real spread outside it. I'm sure much due tracking follow-up know similar thing happened elsewhere could've spread place. Incredible. Yeah, much people like hate tech companies here, soon looking bad, tech companies went full: ‚ÄúWFH, travel banned‚Äù really really quickly. good see &amp; helped keep numbers really low compared could been. Look, I‚Äôm 100% taking precautions fact husband work kids can‚Äôt go school can‚Äôt go work, job refusing pay vacation sick time right people (managers manipulating hours) still unemployment say ALLOWED pay per unemployment office directions?!? WTF know! literally can‚Äôt afford take 2 weeks pay. Taiwan really proud. Despite next China, total number cases low. first thought, due experience prior outbreaks SARS. countries second wave seemed unable learn first one. sounds evil kinda got happy thought somehow boii Bernie gets president Biden dies?

Our health care system coping, deaths higher usual, economy holding relatively well.

How exactly failure? around March 2020 know Luckily you‚Äôre F1 driver, get tested every 5 days.. quarter state Mormon. LDS leaders (regarded prophets speak god believers), could issue statement saying wear masks.  

But nah, might turn devout Republicans make choose political party religion. $ that. what? 4.5 million ppl? morons keep saying killed strange camps LOL least still catch quarantine stop spreading people.

If 10 soon become 50, 400 within days pointless contact trace since spreading faster make phone calls. looked numbers lately? pretty sure ""choosing control"" ""cannot control"".  far, US government chosen control virus. bit complicated that; problem low Covid countries abandoned restrictions working high-Covid countries (relatively, time).

All tourists came infected locals compatriots, restrictions place, low levels first.

Open borders per se problem - there's reason German able fly Munich Hamburg Munich Zagreb, long risks tourist positive Covid mitigated way either end.

Likewise, something dangerous individual Munich ‚Äî dangerous Zagreb, too, even incidence lower - odds infected applicable based came from, is. Enjoy ban! theme Europe. Hospitals collapsing, people acting like problem all. Many things Covid kind propaganda conspiracy. I'm immunocompromised living berlin say demonstrations really frustrating. sit flat time go week groceries, hoping whole situation gonna get better may able see fiancee half year self quarantine, turn news see thousands idiots clumping area, believe disease already killed thousands think wear mask oh terrible. hate people like throwing away progress made, can't live mild inconvenience washing hands, wearing mask partying everyday, meanwhile cripple restrict sitting home, alone, want catch disease could easily prevented spreading people little empathy instead thinking time. frustrating, i'm thankful everyone adheres rules actually tries allow us people risk live. votes say otherwise. No. first suspicions, ruled  Earlier, New Zealand health officials said 12 new infections linked existing virus cluster Auckland, linked material arriving overseas Americold cold-storage  ""It seems clear possibility ruled investigation,"" Director-General Health Ashley Bloomfield  Investigations suggested virus come chilled services material arriving overseas Americold cold-storage facility Auckland one recently infected individuals worked, health officials said. sounds great......not Nordic countries obviously several similarities climate, culture, political system, count deaths etc. sufficient analysis explain different numbers countries. Sweden effected neighbours start. 

You still criticize Sweden, lot complicated comparing death per millions. think schools reopening definitely drives it. Kids socialize outside class. 

And like hey maybe let's go restaurant. People like little kids going school wearing masks. pandemic soooo over. government reopen safe...... Yeah, cases increasing past weeks AZ, yet temperatures gotten much pleasant time period. Cases went dramatically throughout July August, months people typically spend time indoors. Here‚Äôs article October 20th explaining crunch hospitals. effect local healthcare widespread now[Covid 19 patients swamp rural impact health care facilities workers much worse areas March. Yes, point view agree. seem care much people dying:

-They equate number deaths flu (in fact, Trump said flu kills people) 

-They state number deaths wildly overstated died, died ""with"" covid, ""from"" covid. According WH, hardly anyone died covid.
 
-They constantly compare covid deaths deaths (ie. x number people die car accidents year, people still drive. x number people die heart attacks year""

So yes, make covid deaths seem insignificant. live CA. okay-ish right now, can‚Äôt afford get complacent. virus shown time time let guard come roaring back previous hard work nothing.   think things go back March/April italy, us, mexico rest world? know cases going know I'm optimistic thinking simply know I'm kinda worried hospitals enough capacity many past crises, pandemic bringing people closer together and, despite exceptions, producing increase kindness, empathy compassion, especially U.S.

Shocker. :( Triage likely. Yes 10% infected we'd herd immunity. point full lockdown even harsher one back March might actually necessary, depending region region basis. choice hospital systems completely overwhelmed; parts Texas already verge total collapse, lots Midwest states hit capacity. laugh too...like take sexual turn? governor helping denying pandemic?

If told opposite thing would help if, example, house fire. kept telling stay inside worry got it. Would helping you? Dutchie, opinion us also drastically changed covid-response aware 88% Swedens population live urban areas? 

Also, seem know Swedens strategy keep overall health country good possible, keep covid deaths down. Shutting country would absolutely lower numbers (at least temporarily, probably permanently), mental health? sick elderly people dying 6 months earlier otherwise would (which case elderly homes - elderly take care get help home) thing matters look president actually see president already done. know executive orders are, bud? filling Supreme Court (a court that‚Äôs supposed nonpartisan) Republicans? know many things tax breaks affect? several billions dollars rich doesn‚Äôt pay they‚Äôre friends president - think US could‚Äôve done money? poor going pay trillions dollars debt? tax break money devoted giving people two weeks one leave house spread virus. could eliminate thousands potential new cases day. ever think that?

His indecision alone cost us thousands lives information deadly virus early stages, yet nothing months. president empathy would‚Äôve amazing definitely would‚Äôve saved lot people fucked over. Imagine president said WEAR MASK dipshits follow spreading virus rallies instead denying months actually got virus himself. 

I‚Äôm sick assholes like downplaying trumps role this. leader powerful nation world couldn‚Äôt shit say ‚ÄúCHINA VIRUS‚Äù give Biden shit wearing mask. Pathetic. ...and like four deaths, think.

Time rethink we're nation. gets control, daily cases could double every week. Happening Europe now. first vaccines likely stop virus spreading. We'll lucky prevent lower respiratory tract infections.

Therefore makes sense prioritize vulnerable. idea many cases actually existed first wave testing largely completely unavailable

The positivity rate used estimate that.

The higher rate, greater likelihood cases undercounted. cant take care people theres serious lack inbound tax revenue Except 72% say 'they always do' means almost 30% population literally wear masks cannot stronger wording can't force employers anything power. government issuing laws (like later restaurants bars regulate specifically operate limit people), governmental authority issuing recommendations. However, employers, employees working unions take recommendations quite seriously. that's hopeful. i'm reading comments fearing worst. i'm month life ruining sense distortion

covid test came back negative idk wtf going Meanwhile back China (1.5billion) 15 cases yesterday. Unreal possible? Yes, intentional. feels like could go back onto words anymore adamant masks work Great. still winter inevitable ""it probably hurt get together Christmas and/or Thanksgiving"" look forward to. true changing 50 300, also comes new restrictions (minimum distance others, seated places etc).

They also essentiella closing nightclubs. allowed stay open 50 people limit, crowding rules, seated serving etc essentiella making restaurants.

There examples, local recomendations Uppsala saying people shouldnt socialize new people. 

So making stricter less strict. 

But yeah agree total would say sweden relaxad relaxed people think. many past crises, pandemic bringing people closer together and, despite exceptions, producing increase kindness, empathy compassion.

Anecdotal, precautions we've taken family (reduced social connections virtually participation group events) made everyone household impatient, mean, hostile. new. previously quite happy almost time. suspect alone experience (based conversations friends). Yeah went pumpkin patch thing gf.. absolutely packed nobody wearing masking Oregon.

You'd see there, none kids were. Lines people 2 feet apart nobody wearing masks. may waited traffic hour immediately left. Absolutely disgusting likely rising.

Massive crowds headed farms run small families staff power control masking people. watched Hulu - good documentary, would definitely recommend. üëçüëç Newsflash: Venice contained plague quarantine travelers. go: tests much higher previous spikes confirmed cases. test, going find.

When daily deaths spike first 2 ‚Äúwaves‚Äù, believe worse.

Testing good thing. Finding confirming cases good thing. find, better IMO.

Daily Deaths: ‚Äúsecond wave‚Äù daily cases higher first wave, ‚Äúsecond wave‚Äù daily deaths much lower first. misleading. It‚Äôs early say worse previous. others said, never really left first wave. Wrong. sampling people across U.S. note, unemployment increasing places like Florida Georgia again, NY recovering. stay home order that's lifted months, assistance running out, McConnell punting extension assistance pres who, ironically, terrible negotiator. UK hard lockdown quickly all. Schools closed UK numbers went roof reopened June. Spain one first wave also badly prepared. You‚Äôre comparing Sweden worst examples, also much densely populated. comparison you‚Äôre making deeply flawed. rounding curve?? Watch Foxnews primetime :( next door neighbor threw huge house party last night. suspect won‚Äôt one Halloween party year. course do.... Sometimes I‚Äôm glad work hospital. Though surrounded Covid every day, least follow basic health precautions able adapt quickly keep science. Important note first second wave happened warm. first time US experience Covid winter virus spreads much easier. current compounding wave(because waves ended US) go worst. 

This said every rise cases since April, still seen regions US come close level death hospital capacity issues northeast spring.

Also really strange ever subsequent wave geographically isolated previous ones. it? Cool change anything wrote. We'll 100k/day Tuesday Rounding turn, right disaster. Totally agree feeling we‚Äôre side. point contention I‚Äôd assertion government ‚Äústubborn‚Äù

Case positivity rate is: 20.9% Anyone sick winning yet? Number 1! Number 1! Oh blocked me. Guess deal discussion. mature.... snowflake Ok, fooled title ‚ÄúNew General Advice‚Äù. 

However wording March 17th unbelievably soft:

‚ÄùThose employers possibility allow employees work consider this. could certain calming effect spread...‚Äù

This ridiculous. It‚Äôs like parallel reality compared seriousness convenience Nordics announced measures week earlier. that. enjoy cooking/baking every then, want give up! props found working setup! 

Just get bullied feminists - long voluntary decision! We've sequels film nearly 4 long, dark years. comforting think see worst may certain areas. However make desirable goal see many people infected. first hang bar/restaurant 8 months Friday. Nice outdoor area. felt great talk couple friends catch up. I'm NYC, we've lot worked hard allow limited amount socializing now. hope things get way wherever soon. Hang Definitely time go back work. Imagine numbers weeks election day.

Thanks. wonder hospitals use less virus friendly surfaces, schools kill somebody else indirectly, care lack empathy, belief anyone real person. Rationing another word corner turning vanishing? Bravo party Trump literally come said, controlling now, encouraging people wear masks. 

What every-loving fuck going campaign? Yeah, here. like March April ripped vulnerable population, we're minding carefully. (And, sadly, fewer left.) rollback federal level - states enough money it, can't go bankrupt + pandemic hurt revenue streams.

Basically, need federal government step guarantee pay/relief businesses stop operations close down. see happening ignauguration, earliest :/ It‚Äôs less labor 200,000-300,000 tragically die this. It‚Äôs also people leaving working labor pool voluntarily. 
Early retirement, housewives, etc...
Some people don‚Äôt want go back work experiencing life like outside working full time. 

I think main point difficult things predict that‚Äôs it‚Äôs almost useless speculate broadly. I‚Äôve Paris twice disappointed time. museums things made worthwhile. Paris always promoted Hollywood movies. places Europe lot nicer. Wo AI Beijing Tiananmen, mention pie young Chan? nice contribution think less deadly flu would everyone wore masks flu season. 

Covid 19 isn‚Äôt flu.  post responded directly showing graphs. oh. wrong. students zero connection team using game reason party. College kids going party regardless NCAA. anyone help understand specifically Vaccines going immunized?

We know yet.

Obviously, perfect world vaccine prevent people contracting disease. preventing severe illness considered ""good enough"" many. covid-19 reduced giving people cold days, make large difference already.

The trial protocols 3 leading candidates number symptomatic covid-19 cases ""primary efficacy endpoint"", means one main interests study. addition, criteria determine whether enough data gathered readout based count cases. Success failure trial based this.

Severe cases monitored counted secondary endpoint.

Note trials require symptomatic infection counted. vaccine candidate prevent infection causes resolve asymptomatically, could still result positive outcome.  totally avoiding points then? 

You hand ‚ÄòPhD‚Äô back believe four weeks lockdown would solved it. western northern hemisphere country managed even get close it.

And think answer simple four week plan. 

Delusion. TBH could get whole family quarantine 2weeks prior small apartment idea would much safer public... can't legally NJ NY closely connected. wouldnt wouldnt wish take part. bullshit part FDRs new deal issued IMF basically way tag cattle I'm completely against. dont want pay dont want part it. wonder reasoning behind that. I'd ignore r/science coronavirus stuff. mix small group actual scientists much larger group Reddit Scientists‚Ñ¢. Go r/COVID19 actual information discussion. Swift action mean closing Halton. Take Oakville! lookin Hamilton? want sit patio too? Don‚Äôt tempt cause action comin! preparing case becomes necessary. Utah currently one lower hospitalizations per capita U.S 105 current covid hospitalizations/million people. national average 120 many states 200 hosp/mil. states 300. Hospital capacity generally gets stressed around 400, surge capacity 1000 hosp/mil saw New York Northeast states March government intervention (furlough schemes, basic income etc) economic effects mitigated. course, less people able work, less go round - important thing ensure burden shared.

Furthermore, sooner virus eliminated, quicker economy return normal - NZ China. Fixing Corona fixes economy. fixing Corona inevitably lead economic pain. Yeah, I'm even sure best move. close schools, people even actually congregating less? like suddenly 8 3:30 pm school kids completely separated. Instead, they're going maskless playdates hanging Mom, Dad, Grandma day.

I almost feel like getting people spend *more* time controlled environments better move, least country individuals making effort own. realize driving car damage lungs cause brain damage, blood clots require amputation limbs unknown damage still learning about. die mean organs injured. ignorant view pretend like cars ""bumping other""...completely wrong. assume op's intentions behind question? Well ain't fucking good. Much safer without it. Corner, turned. time tell.

When first case noted 2019? already losing sleep it, still taking basic precautions avoid catching it. certainly want spread someone else.

Reasonable. latest heard (which admittedly... oh man, month ago) asthma (along type 1 diabetes pregnancy) weakly associated severe COVID risk.

Interestingly, COPD, sickle cell disease, cancer listed strongly associated increased risk. Pretty much I'd heard heart disease, type II diabetes, obesity (and hypertension weakly-associated list). 2/3 country curfew 21-6h. Mask mandates almost everywhere. that, much. usually need time close proximity catch virus, \*s like make harder stay safe everyone. realise driving car kill you.

Try understand risk. Currently understand risk. Cringe US politicised closing border China

don't silly, virus originated China, everyone planet shut border China. dont disagree banning things would save healthcare costs. public health emergency, everyone responsible keeping everyone healthy. Especially simple. Refuaing selfishness, pure simple. [insert rambling cognitive dissonance here] Cloth masks early would helped, even N-95 surgical masks short supply. know exactly connected post doc London finished PhD health economics, 6 years, (still am) researcher health respect economic outcomes...so knowledge bring table shittiest timeline lmao That‚Äôs price prolonged harsh lockdown without clear aim didn't? NY did... rural areas countries slacking months catching cases. quandary reckless fucking idiot maybe well assume saying option?

Those tested treated covid-positive, i.e. mandatory quarantine, denial entry businesses public facilities, etc. interned isolated home

Positive cases quarantined hospitals. Close contacts recovered patients quarantined hotels. Here's another graph illustrate said uptick deaths correspond uptick cases: people dying without lockdown? Yes, are. Another example person intolerant others opinions making decisions. intolerant, judgmental, unjustified superior attitude. evidence anything done hurt people know nothing me. People like make world worse, even though think better everyone else. stop obtuse? literally first search result google, could find hundred articles studies. argument here. 

If disagree I‚Äôll tell told guy: Give single piece evidence supports opinion. Anything. Article, study, whatever. Show evidence ten times higher deaths per capita *not* due difference policy. I‚Äôll waiting. exactly 88,973 infections two days row?

That's sounds like lucky unlucky thing. NYT entire story showing experts believe schools causing surges shoot pistol random air, bullet arcs back down, hits someone kills injuries them, responsible that. Even idea there. 

Ahh yes, wearing mask totally discharging firearm... someone refuses wear mask, spreads COVID-19, even asymptomatic know sick, responsible subsequent infections potential deaths.

But since that's unprovable, responsible. ethically least.. think law still playing catch this.

Ahh entire comment theoretical? 

You realize cannot confirm infected. Right?

You accuse allege confirm prove. already *knew* sick it, still refused take reasonable precautions prevent spread, also legally responsible happens. 

California reduced penalties earlier year KNOWINGLY transmitting HIV people. established Typhoid Mary.

It disease like covid acts like flu cold.

Covid typhoid, worse flu without existing immunity... Fucking same. point know. None Johns-Hopkins, WHO, CDC information mentioned original comment 15 months worth data. 

We model, work existing knowledge. new virus, far bodies handling well even die it. 

The bigger point despite huge gap knowledge, world leaders, least mine acting live virus see happens. 

There large unknown risk yet even addressed scheme global competition could ultimately wreck country. kind risk ought considered plan ""let everyone get sick"".

I think individual level, normal person avoid crowds, mask up, take vaccine something worry about.

That said, seen good amount parents operating guise letting kids catch better, give kids masks, fine disease vectors. Again, there's ridiculous fear telling people risks here. There's risk kid could die life-long condition like asthma exposure. kid care hated me, allowed expose vaccine out. asthma, made life much difficult care explain. years heard switch European social drinking culture, covid era, traditional kalsarik√§nnit (drinking alone home underwear) clearly smart choice  good ideas!

Nothing makes angrier knowing people living life without constant fear.  That's everyone's plan now. 
 
No, isn't. Many European countries lost control already could regain additional restrictions. Sweden Latvia close losing control, Latvia operating room Sweden's reluctance introduce restrictions. 
 
Furthermore, situation different spring autumn winter spring still due.  additional shut impossible without massive federal aid package. part people keep looking past. what's making fucking depressed lately. I've pandemic TWICE US response *worst* pretty much country besides Brazil.

I living South Korea early days virus left beginning March panic day two border closed US. thought virus would level MERS stay Korea, uncontrolled surprisingly lethal. 

I would safer staying there, COUNTY nearly double total cases entire ***COUNTRY*** South Korea.

All friends left Korea basically living normal life, masks really needed, hotspots small squashed due intense contact tracing. No? pointed out, uptick deaths reliably 1% fatality reliably follows uptick cases within 2-4 weeks countries posted graphs for. Hence France upticked 19 times daily deaths graph ended 9 daily deaths.

Of course uptick deaths smaller uptick cases, later, corresponds I've described, clearly completely false declare there's uptick deaths they're 19 times rate numbers cited. Whatever  Yeah, mortality dropped massively everywhere Europe summer. Germany actually done better Sweden across summer October. So: typical Reddit sub, then? üòú Yes keeps growing like get 2% population infected day icu capacity left.

Edit add: major city hospitals higher capacity, assume that‚Äôs air lifted closest major city. That's quite immunity works. 

Your body still memory cells recreate antibodies fight virus immune system detect again. always boggle mind many people gymnastics believe many circular, self contradictory ideas. Unbelievable.

It's believable. gymnastics voluntary, people manipulated ideas. big problem get restaurants businesses shut again. Either active cases 1 per 5000 people, shut we're 1 per 50 people hospitals turning away deathly ill corpses piling streets. US testing actually one highest per capita developed nation, though they've fallen bit recently, still 60-80% higher Netherlands.

Our poor testing beginning Trump actively curtailing testing keep numbers ""where liked them."" RemindMe! 6 months answered questions Another reason split NCAA colleges make standalone sports league completely removed higher education. 

They stay place, keep names, colors, way affiliated schools. 

Students still athletes, employer sports league school.  best thing use common soap, antibacterial soap antibacterial enough good except write ""antibacterial\*"" onto package (\* washing hands 60 ¬∞C five minutes).

For covid, may find good recipe Massachusetts went 2k peak 150 back 1k right now. point dramatic response people think need stricter enforcement.

Not wearing mask comparable speeding, comparable jay walking parking ticket. We're turning corner. rounding bend downhill March swear. keep getting positive results. 
But tested negative recovered. get tested positive 1-2 months tested negatives could support **current** opinion things bad believe is, supported evidence. I‚Äôll take literally nothing evidence. That‚Äôs thought. parts country experiencing true second wave. Massachusetts numbers 150 cases day. Last days 1k. Wow, deaths per day chart spiking hard 1 per day 1 per day zero evidence initial viral load anything severity infection. 

Maybe forgot add ""SARS-CoV-2"" ""COVID-19"" there. There's plenty evidence prognosis related initial viral load LOT virii. **Including SARS-CoV**. I'm acting superior? lol, person thinks highly little others can't simply get take out. Honestly, one's asking run mine field...this f'ing easy hurt people. can't imagine self-absorbed think leisure important. Hoax. Democrat backed study. stupid comments see facebook reddit ""Very clear"" matter perspective. one wave. never got control. Imagine line moving zooming out. Look stock market comparison small changes short period time give illusion different 'wave'.  


The US coronavirus graph spike leveling prolonged period time R0 'control' spread safe levels. got bored went back usual, overall slowing average spread without ever actually 'stopping' it. P100s already, wood working, picked extra filters them. They're hot sweaty, form air tight seal face (providing hubby shaves). need them, we'll glad them. Yes, confirm actually happening...our neighbors got bunch chairs umbrellas delivered yesterday guess party setting for. also still quite cold NYC March April huge spike. live Mass March, still heat years. Probably be, long haul. question whether accept learn change go kicking screaming. Love Ishmael. last one released politically influenced enough even rank ‚Äúindoor church less 500 people‚Äù.

Edit: nm garbage july 0 evidence back claim. Immunity definitely established short term. *probably* forever. accurate thing Trump said debate immunity could weeks could forever, one really knows.

However, evidence points least several months immunity, potential multiple years average (but we'd wait years find out). J&amp;J vaccine, works, could prove important long term. Unlike 3 front runners (Oxford/AZ, Pfizer, Moderna), J&amp;J targeting single-shot regime vaccine also stringent cooling requirements transport storage.

It much easier distribute administer J&amp;J vaccine, especially areas lack proper infrastructure (rural areas, third world countries). good point. Thanks highlighting. Definitely need fed stimulus bill hope time targeted small businesses + individuals specifically impacted.  Well, Moms Utah united send sick kids school schools stay open, chickens, flocking home roost. extrapolate based pattern indicative chart Dec. 1st we'll seeing \~40-50 cases per 100,000 residents. peaks quickly, it'll reduce possibly second wave levels month two that. matches degree increase pattern see; could well better worse that.

If someone run total number cases February, total deaths, I'd thankful. There's still lot water ocean waves going away. miracle. /s See prime example Americans seems lack literally critical thinking skills all. Dr. Fauci said wear masks beginning know extent virus capable airborne transmission lack PPE medical personnel. Fucking hell people genuinely stupid explain going El Paso? Thanks Got downvoted shit saying personally still tested positive 7 months. Glad scientific rather anecdotal backing. You‚Äôve gotta fucking kidding me. Look numbers yourself, cunt. Sweden 58/100k, Norway 5. dumb one think people arranging impression good anybody wallets. got it, I'd dead. 75 years old like 5 co-morbidities. lots young people co-morbidities too. relatives friends diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, asthma, etc?  got luck didn‚Äôt peak Winter last year Objectivity? Data? perspective thorough analysis???

Come on, lazy thinking part. see. Would difficult identify someone wearing mask, enough exercise, knowledge area, defensive implement (A super bright flashlight brief stun run one inadvertently cones face face), doubt cops much hinderance determined individuals. think people modify behavior like party? gets even stranger find Banks back ground.

France dense compared lot Asian countries/SARs, ironically fared pretty well. Macau, Singapore, HK, Taiwan, South Korea placed top 20 terms population density. Whereas France ranked #68 (just ahead Poland) still less dense say Denmark. point, problem longer simply population density non-human factor. simply country longer intention handle this. grandmother passed early 2016. Im kind glad able miss crap shoot past 4 years. least died dignity 2016 suffer though times. Good summary article, thanks.

One additional remark: Biontech/Pfizer tested 17 common variants including D614G, neutralised vaccine antibodies almost identical effectiveness vitro. Funny. Paris restaurants &amp; bars never full. businesses saved people whose definition ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù drinking overpriced beer freezing balls off. Sure, claim Sweden could done more. talking though. Look large spread infection spring. Sweden hit harder earlier neighbours. statistic available. influenza pandemic would easy compared this. tests, vaccines work, know spreads, tends symptomatic. I'm beginning think walking dead universe China new Zealand dealt zombie plague US unmitigated shit hole. specify. Average compared countries similar culture, risk factors, testing capacity. Keep mind many developing nations seeing tons deaths COVID register, undercounting massively, simply extremely young population resilient virus. Likely combination 3, compare apples apples, US pretty average. happy that. Funny, can‚Äôt there‚Äôs paywall *or something*; imagine posting paywalled articles crying people can‚Äôt read them

My statement still stands valid, get job stop crying *or something*; crying doesn‚Äôt solve shit anybody involved NEVER LEFT FIRST WAVE THIS!! fucking idiots! numbers those? know, you? *actually* look numbers instead reading biased headlines. aneurysm reading Heh... explain need new laptop. old one struggles minecraft diablo 3. never mentioned anything masks schools. What‚Äôs bullshit said? Scary teachers don‚Äôt good reading comprehension... Probably central asia (Kyrgyzstan Tajikstan), close Kashgar (the city outbreak is). China shares porous border central asia countries.

Are allowed without quarantining 14 days? European governments providing aid restaurants bars? fuck tuition whether Singaporean government trustworthy? fucking naive. bet truth would blow small mind. Yeah, no. one going look back 2020 fondly. going beat COVID, least deal enough return normal. vaccine effective enough get control. wave extremism 2010s appear getting worse right now, promising victories defeating it. problems mentioned likely happen, case there's reason anyone would looking 2020 good year instead reminiscing 2014 2015 instead. one wants hear pointless pessimism. Read third paragraph again. issues stem that. agree might right two past months, one end yet course raports complete yet. need wait long bit time till get proper view matter.


And add ""I feel like wrong relevance yearly deaths data"" list. *It important, statistic exist vacuum.* election, especially Trump wins. guys ever say Norway? right outperformed Sweden every metric far. 

I know meet ""anything nothing hard"" standard, look entire county less deaths little county live in.  B...but thought big orange oompa loompa told us getting better? hey, we're trying best hit #1 Ok thank you.  accepting numbers? know much Singaporean government. *actually* testing? trustworthy? Ok California middle pack per capita basis. 23rd best according depends region. Brussels, bars restaurants closed, homeworking strongly supported sports forbidden close space everyone 12. schools also follow, teens first. Nah, it‚Äôs faster train doom climate change. Italy summer, 90% people weren‚Äôt wearing mask properly, social distancing (as streets quite narrow, even it‚Äôs wide, many people), nightclubs definitely open. government may advised properly, people definitely didn‚Äôt follow properly. hope get come Seattle disgusting liberal doctors save lives. irony However, see people trying compromise everywhere, that, enough data. Also, people believe measures backed stats, explanations real-world examples.

Perhaps you‚Äôre overthinking little much.

‚ÄúPeople‚Äù aren‚Äôt scientists, there‚Äôs broad consensus among scientists, public health officials epidemiologists basic, effective guidelines mitigating covid-19 spread. 

We enough data come broad consensus. consensus informs guidelines people need follow. 

Picking choosing outliers essentially like using anecdotes try disprove rule point. Armchair quarterbacking quasi-scientific ‚Äúexperts‚Äù allowed tobacco industry play game decades. like ‚Äúexperts‚Äù don‚Äôt believe climate change ‚Äúdisprove‚Äù throwing snowball US Senate floor. ... know isn‚Äôt science actually works. 

Seriously. guidelines aren‚Äôt complicated. aren‚Äôt mysterious. Copious data support them. They‚Äôre determined broad scientific consensus worldwide.

e: autocorrect There's already 500,000 new cases month. could 700,000 month out. November going big surge deaths. hope France turn tide quickly. back stating 10 times fact sentence complaining lack evidence.

You've got interesting approach concept thought, give that. Remind - Reddit introverted. sub particular extremely introverted, borderline shut ins. automod. misspell words causing block.

Rich older people protect (they may retired, nice homes backyards help mental health get delivery essential goods). Poor older people using social assistance/still work Walmart survive? Yeah much. Canada, huge inheritance tax too, convinced government stoked realize ripped long term care homes. Cut elder benefits get taxes return? Win win shit governments. governments actually cared people would used lockdown create safe back work plans, made work from
Home right can, admitted it‚Äôs airborne spread, asymptomatic spread created safe work regulations strict enforcement new law officers hired, along lots contact tracers. Ontario, government trying make businesses liability negligence COVID consequences (to try save money already dozens million plus lawsuits regulators LTCH). They‚Äôve made pretty clear they‚Äôre fine elders dying, don‚Äôt want 50 something voter base get fucked it. accurate

e/ painfully Agreed. assuming overly optimistic view. Blaming 300k coronavirus gets anti-maskers huff didn‚Äôt want get brigaded lol Cases matter. Florida fired previous director charge informatics massage numbers.

Their death rate still high, half time high select new cases case counts rising again.

Positivity rate almost 5%

If open back covid magically go away. They're probably gonna worse Jan/Feb everyone goes holidays 'Florida good!' someone somewhere else besides US pointing younger kids seem drive Covid outbreaks. Generally age 10 considered age appear transmit virus, hopeful middle schools addition elementary schools would safer high schools colleges. People substantially change lives extreme long term disease statistically speaking easy survive gives mild symptoms (Not trying downplay severe cases know occurred simply stating thought process peoples head)

This can't emphasized enough. COVID weird spot serious enough take precautions against, simply deadly enough people really change live. simply Ebola.

A HUGE reason people comply masks/distancing they're told ""mask coffin up"" know several people got COVID fine weeks later. Kansas- people bars restaurants acting like everything fine. 

Would like add several friends covid, including one 'long hauler' still going bars convincing everyone like flu. thought friends contracted might start take things seriously no.

One girl texted us friend's dad dropping dead covid days ago. proceeded go clubbing get shitfaced last night. Btw forced move home jobs disappeared, there's risk. So, place beach want live that‚Äôs issue you? Yeah, owe explanation interesting link, thanks. Glad super smart anti mask crusaders months ago. SHOCKER!!! report‚Äôs 15 percent countries score highest tier public confidence 3 percent show commitment prioritizing services health-care workers become sick result participating public health percent countries demonstrate system dispensing medical countermeasures health emergencies. Boston I've heard.  Not...really? US 10th cases per capita deaths per capita, UK high cases per capita. theory really hold up. 

A thread threads one, sorting sub recency economy factor **FoHM** strategy. No, sadly didn't. hope manage get things less control least semblance normalcy close relatives Christmas season, I'm counting seeing many friends real life anytime soon.

We already planned virtual birthday party can't invite people over, sucks, necessary. Economy basically. lot businesses survive another shutdown especially without government relief package. failure early pandemic problem. going troll, least make sentences legible. mean tell one, two, three waves US A? Fauci said early nobody wearing mask, knew bullshit. seriously believe exactly 0 COVID deaths last 4-6 months China either insanely gullible deliberately ignoring likely explanations

China cooking books long time. onus prove otherwise, me. Might keep people totally safe transmission, reduce total viral load people exposed - key factor overall case severity. sounds like youre arguing someone(?) everyone agrees. Im disagreeing you.

I.e last couple months less deaths usual.

You dont think true? copied pasted annoying DM sayings love whip every Sunday? fact explain it, reinforces said. Stay NYC anyone actually believe numbers China provides? positive one trying. would like trying make rain.. happens raining. watching 20 kids outside house play football right now. We're fucked. 100% accurate. live North Carolina mask compliance varies vastly county county. started driving 45 minutes home shopping. Humans social animal. Going months without freely interacting others outside homes meant live. government intervention (furlough schemes, basic income etc) economic effects mitigated. course, less people able work, less go round - important thing ensure burden shared.

So full-blown communism inflation? took camping trip rural part New England. Popped mask outside convenience store grab something forgot. *only* one store mask on. Decent number Biden/Harris signs area too. Strange times. Wife visited SC last week, everyone wearing masks. Inside out, refreshing coming NC Ah, again, proving understand risk.

Common cold also ""contagious"".

What's important actual risk, scary emotional words associated item. Instead, positivity number skyrocket. likely last pandemic magnitude. People need remember - pandemic that's shut regular life since 1918. even then, bad is. There's reason expect happen next 50 years. Really? that? reason exhibit seasonality novel pandemic virus. long enough people susceptible roll on. Pandemic influenza H1N1 thing one seasonal influenza viruses. acute pandemic phase probably become seasonal respiratory virus. disagree. It‚Äôs matter time CA joining list. Drop downtown Palm Springs tonight place packed people fully masked up. one following social distancing rules. Good question. visited late September, saw thing. Religious mask wearing - like complete compliance shops/on transport lot outdoors. None chin strap shit like UK. People generally wearing walking around restaurant/to loos.

I'm Italian hit nail head here: mask wearing religious character, treated like observance whose absolution frees obeying Covid rule.

This observance requires masks always worn busses trains, shops, whenever sitting restaurant. that, good citizen done part stop Covid.

Social distancing? nope. Wearing masks workplace? nope. Remote working whenever possible? daft, bosses need see ass chair.

In schools, actual rule saying kids take masks provided desks spaced 1 apart. seems 101 cm magical barrier forms filters Covid droplets stale air 20+ people sharing hours every day.

People probably getting infected breakfast bar morning, no... they're getting infected co-worker one desk over, passing friends come visit, infecting kids go school breathe maskless 100.1 cm away students... Similar lesser degree Canada (specifically Ontario) early stay home, wear mask we‚Äôll get numbers low. closed mid April think got numbers hit hundred day sub-100 times sub-50. we‚Äôre hovering around 900 per day since Sept premier sad he‚Äôs waiting 1000 implementing restrictions. Restrictions mind include leaving restaurants open indoor dining, casinos open, school open, bars open. Pretty much everything open. think pity someone putting things perspective? Sounds like think sophisticated trash countries arbitrary reasons. I'd rather see world is. That's right thing really means. bigotry low expectations real. Lockdowns always meant way stop hospitals overwhelmed giving time stand massive testing, isolation, contact tracing programs. countries actually followed well. dropped ball not. Sweden done none detriment seniors must remain isolated months risk lives leave house. get sick they‚Äôll comfort knowing aren‚Äôt wasting space hospital they‚Äôll sent home die drug-induced stupor. amazing watch. count lucky moved Vietnam work. Vietnamese government great job containing waves. 

There compliance everyone Vietnam also better contact tracing. Also, interacted location someone confirmed case Covid was, declare government taken Quarantine Camp 2 weeks. 

Knew several people declare taken camps two weeks take three Covid tests well.  forget positive corruption Sweden one urbanised countries Europe, like neighbouring countries, count deaths accurately. easy compare countries. need negative test want go back school got flagged. (No mandatory tests anyone want get cleared contact, need test stay home 14 days ear loop Powecom KN95 masks bonafide fake. make statements like unless know WTF talking about. 

I would suggest subscribing /r/Masks4All subreddit anyone interested stuff. One poster particular, /u/coll0412, independent tests many KF94 KN95 masks given thumbs Powecom KN95s deom bonafide:

 least worry world underpopulated numbers. Imagine thinking borders Canada Mexico primary driver coronavirus US. would cool. Hopefully find something like though don‚Äôt think changes overall much. Nazis invade anyone sweden. German friends, supposed travelling Germany (essential, holiday purposes). anyone think lockdown close? Curfew set 17 October, Imo enough see effects next week around Thursday Wednesday go Hogwarths? 

What really mean? ‚ÄòAttacking immune system directly preventing formation memory cells‚Äô. Memory cells part immune system. would previously unknown way immune system work would also sort SARS-CoV2 viruses (including corona viruses) works immune system. course, links high quality studies peer reviewed journals?

But want real facts, study institution (not published yet) showing persons history previous covid-19 infection (typical symptoms positive cases close them) negative antibodies, 90% functional antibodies neutralization test. I‚Äôm sure you, excellent education, understand means. make anything less severe? India China double population, each. September government decided relax measures place, 

This sure take long spiral control :( Maybe me, seems like people lose fucking jobs enforcing... laws/mandates/rules... they're supposed to... enforce. 

They literally ONE job. study shown ~93% ‚Äúexposed asymptomatic‚Äù individuals cell response SARS-CoV-2, despite seropositivity 60% cases infections may therefore common, antibody testing alone may underestimate true prevalence infection population immunity. that's problem here. People quick make assumptions *a long-term strategy* use political tool. get quite exaggerated sometimes. lot European countries lot less strict restrictions compared Belgium. 

And weren‚Äôt nearly hard hit spring. compute me. perception paying people see low cases low deaths seems good.

But people forget Sweden small population.

The pandemic exposed lot people dumb completely unable read fine print. Agreed. state mask mandate sheriffs depts wouldn‚Äôt enforce. pulled gf tint high meanwhile like 30 people walking around group without masks. antibody test, rather vieus rna Yes lets pity-party richest ten percent humanity, hindered arrogance entitlement right thing.

It's real pity. worth risk. one needs eat out. pisses hear countries don‚Äôt political control borders, say well it‚Äôs easy NZ island. every senior lives care home. shopping etc among people dgaf spreading virus.  Depends district. live balanced (age, ethic distribution etc). shops people mostly water masks.
Tube though downtown mixed picture. always nose breathers people wear masks. Idk would annoying. Seems unlikely annoying Exactly. end pandemic. Saying Sweden's policy work Oct. 2020 like calling game half-time. still woods, Sweden's policy specifically stated long term... said, East Asia seems kicking ass... put statue jacinda ardern outside parliament. insanity September government decided relax measures place, instead counting common sense people, much dismay leading virologists. 

Instead allowed 5 close contacts whole family proof month, went 5 per person per week example. Also, pubs open college/university students returning school partying heart's content, got really nice chance spread.

You guess well went. Keep potatoes Idaho. Washington needs refuse transfers.  covid risk kill basically zero since im young healthy. Im around old people day day life risk infecting anyone weak slim. infections area low anyway. However vaccines could well side effects 1 10000 like lot medication. example painkiller relied damaged kidneys slightly 1 200000 chance instantly killing first pill. sister recurring probably life long migraines side effect taking one anti depressant pill one isingle time. medication vaccines joke. swine flu vaccine 2009 caused narcolepsy least 1300 people 60 million vaccinated, that's 1 45000. imagine covid vaccines Similar side effect vaccinated billion people. country 700 people allegedly died covid probably die anyway, however 1 45000 side effects would life long damage least 100 people. say side effects svine flu vaccine actually cause unregistered issues? europe nations keeping second wave like Danes. Well fair. T-Cell thing true. Stockholm might actually 40% immunity may.

How annoying would right? Meh don‚Äôt know anti maskers malicious people much stupid see lack effect impact cure next week think presidential shower like? got sense article Swedish officials lot people see elderly dying something soon anyway big deal. It‚Äôs quite jarring. 

I understand there‚Äôs different mindset end life locking seniors homes months end blocking access healthcare young go bars, movies parties cold blooded. lack solidarity confusing. Yeah. length quarantine period going manage much. probably biggest issue countries terms getting control.  Schools, public transportation, people care remove masks often not. acknowledge success trashing others that's success all.

Try acknowledging successes own. false success dragging others down. According www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com past 30 days 40.5% Reddit visitors US. Although majority, pretty large, considering next biggest percentage 10.1% (visitors UK). Since US one country makes sense put things perspective using example giving corresponding numbers European country. Hardly any, people make false names contact details, lots people claim Adolf Hitler Waves hello France. 
Cries. 
Looks 40k+ cases per day hospitals struggling, doctors trying cope, government listening doctors, people partying caring. 
Cries bit more. 
Realises I've isolating since February, losing final years twenties. 
Cries lot.

A total 8,568,625 cases reported United States 224,751 deaths, highest world absolute terms.

The United States saw record high number new daily Covid-19 cases second day row Saturday, figures Johns Hopkins University showed, warnings grew spread.

The country reported 88,973 new infections 8:30 pm Friday 8:30 pm Saturday, figures showed, substantially previous day's 79,963. health care system coping

Sure. people denied access care. higher usual

Fuck hate disgustingly fake talking point. Deaths per capita way higher neighbouring comparable countries. Sweden done terribly deaths. counties way average deaths, **and point compare different strategies, absolute economy holding relatively well.

Another fake fuck talking point. Despite failure deaths, economy similarly bad neighbouring countries way less deaths. exactly failure?

Let‚Äôs summarize - damage economy, way people dying. Absolutely excuses huge share deaths couldn‚Äôt avoided everyone else doing. 

Does answer question? Many engineer colleagues even wash hands. dudes drop deuce playing phone, wash up, use pull bar workout room. thing (technically, give vaccine population giving herd immunity). Although referring reliance herd immunity tactic kill virus, course different story. France island.

They never chance reach success islands (South Korea/Taiwan/New Zealand/Japan) either islands akin islands (only land border North Korea, secure closely guarded border world).

You compare apples apples. nearly perfected respiratory protection technology. Ok? works perfectly well.

.... NAMES!^butyes OH, works. Kids infect parents infect grandparents hospitalized, die, hospitalized long term issues infecting others... Great solution... see another peak horizon... tried conspiracy commit biological terrorism. Yes it‚Äôs Tegnell. Stop personal attacks. It‚Äôs rude makes sound dumb Close call how? 85? Literally every time drive car ""sacrificing lives others"" increasing risk traffic accidents, donkey. balance. Berlin failed state guess you‚Äôre True Christian, then. Turns takes two weeks see significant results reason I'm always surprised see shootings hospital billing staffs insurance companies. 

They seem evil.

Charging people much money aspirin, minutes doctor's time.

I'm afraid going take that, GOP certainly care financial hardships.

I read article even confirm headline... Simply grab largest kitchen knife let talking ya. anecdotes, point. Multiple news outlets reported confirmed reinfections. can't think country planned things better 
 
I can. 
For example: Latvia \#USA NUMBER ONE!!! dangerous right matters established authorities wrong.

Voltaire you.  talking victimless crimes

Which victimless crime that? Killing people roads killing disease?

I guess they're victims they're you.  Covid still lingering WH. actually hurting small family-owned businesses, consider 100% doable without considering financial situation thousands people, think actually doable

You get all

It currently hurting little guy measures need taken taken.

And measures need taken reverse direction wealth redistribution 40+ years -- poor towards rich.

Which exactly nothing done address crisis. policy called xenophobic, quote Trump generally made reference travel restrictions. Also border closure like NZ did, restriction still allowed thousands people enter US China Europe without quarantines. 

It took 2 cases slipping quarantine hotels Melbourne seed massive epidemic tens thousands cases now. travel restrictions US really never would effect all. 

NZ total travel ban countries since 19 March. Citizens residents allowed enter must spend 2 weeks govt controlled, military guarded quarantine facilities. still case slip every 3 weeks average need use widespread testing rapid contact tracing prevent another outbreak. people like whining, someone make actual decisions save us times. can't paralyzed ""empathy"" would let people die. intentionally think good idea, inevitable unless reimpose full lockdown long failing trace system.

I feel like countries headed point, sigh. regional/partial lockdowns seem imposing work unless act early enough. Pretending like Covid spreads fomites droplets aerosol based transmission dons't exist, work either. america first america last Finland Norways measures similar Denmark‚Äôs. Much Sweden.

In March Norway‚Äôs measures clearly even strict Denmarks. Fx made illegal healthcare personnel leave country restricted travel within Norway. 

Finland isolated Helsinki short time arriving travellers quarantine 14 days. also much stricter Denmark points. know American, say seems reasonably priced. one many reasons in-person school flat happening anywhere US.

Any state agent administrator thinks children follow protocols, use consistently use proper PPE; parents won‚Äôt abuse system sending sick kids unfit position. 

Disease tears though schools every winter, adds new one poorly understood, doesn‚Äôt yet vaccine, severe complications inconsistent presentation‚Äîand politicized.

The school boards state legislatures never given irresponsible dangerous parents capacity harm children school employees. 

At time, parents truly think school agencies decided open forced open state would transparent close (and potentially lose money) problem control also highly diluted.

There many bad actors sides equation anyone think dangerous situation won‚Äôt pop buildings 100-1000 students, won‚Äôt late anyone knows anything done it. 

Private schools (particularly religious ones, personally problem with) worse, taking danger government ones.

The whole thing disgusts me, retired K12 school employee retired college faculty.  Would charge patients that? fault many people. cases rising everywhere? world would trust kind link send me? thank you. quanrantee

I think drove there, once.  Best decision ever made. probably even wear mask public. simplest easiest thing people act like asking donate kidneys firstborn. Utah mistake. give back Mexico? information false. hospital forces airlift, responsible?

&amp;#x200B;

On deaths door would drive myself, paid $30,000 mild CV symptoms, ER capacity point US may become vulnerable... talking ICU death, matter much country testing? People ICU need test. unconstitutional... Ok? since last Thursday..

Bars restaurants closed 2 weeks though new cases hospitalisations started dropping go nations overthrow governments believe everyone able say ""Fuck tell me""

You overthrow nations' governments governments *you* told them. service rendered stopping coronavirus. want accept though. comes back doorstep, even started theirs. Yeah, could see that. Probally reason Trump ventelator, coma right now. achieved sheer effort 99.99% Victorians. easy, national government trying force us open earlier scientists agreed safe, Murdoch media everything undermine plan, got biggest outbreak country 0 new daily cases. it. 

The rest world: too! Wear masks, lockdown to, socially distance. California restrictions, New York, also widely successful. restrictions, spike, key Observe Smart Restrictions: flatten curve, open up, flaten curve, open again. Many made mistake impose many restrictions, seeing big surges now, even restrictions business, Florida seeing bigger surge Californian resorting minimal communications public. far far less affordable health care cronic health issues impact, Florida state starring barrel another massive economic disaster. young healthy facing tremendous two front battle covid Florida's terrible economics. It‚Äôs outside remote. 1500 kilometers Urumqi. USA USA Flu cases hitting hard year due social distancing measures Lol real? Ok. serious question, realize government never going end lockdown? first ""2 weeks flatten curve"". they're saying may still lockdown even vaccime comes out. I'm safe wearing mask, lockdown stuff bullshit. working retail, every right spend Thanksgiving family. I'm really sure, tbh. feel like state really done good job containing LA county trying impose fines people. live Irvine handling things differently even cities OC, pay attention OC board meetings stuff like generally lean mask/open schools side.

Southern California HUGE club, bar, restaurant, music festival community. Lots people used go time sudden anymore, people go hang others means increasing chance spreading virus. know, Ferrari Ford cars drive. totally different. call facts opinions wish true. world work way honey. True, think spring, states unscathed virus probally thought spared worst, let guard down. average age decreases

It decrease fast old people die off. Eventually strategy would work. I'm lockdown, 100% pro mask pro vaccine. Challenge accepted Ouch. Double whammy. Wow, thank sharing this, idea many people like this...it's eye opening. looks like American comment section. I'm sorry (et je sympathise, tout √† fait...) ""Starve Beast""

Our current government's strategy intentional failure prove government work privatized sold off. criteria end first wave?  watch. Come next Thursday becomes abundantly clear Biden election, Republicans shut things harder anything far. they'll spend first six, twelve, maybe months next administration pointing fingers bad economy many businesses closed soon came in.

Of course say Easter meant. done covid symptoms 10+ days passed still positive mean. linger system Schools aren‚Äôt magic indoor spaces aren‚Äôt great, still doesn‚Äôt lead conclusion schools causing spike even schools cause significant community spread.

The data seems point direction schools less risky thought based thought process mentioned emphasize, schools aren‚Äôt magic shouldn‚Äôt open, seems like may make sense open communities precautions.) voting 2016 nothing COVID. don‚Äôt understand point. Here‚Äôs comparison France US daily cases yesterday...


France 

52,000 new cases

Population 67 million 


US

85,000 new cases

Population 350 million invite Kiwis sold boxing day test? Oh yikes prayers guys interestingly unfortunate right thing mandated. Amazing efforts, long hard road. start slowly rejoin rest Australia covid-normal. rest Australia largley suppressed virus, cases returned travellers quarantine. Vigilance still key, know well Melbourne 0 turn 700 plus cases day matter weeks. Time move Australia! point seems ""it enough bother"". 

I know Americans defeatist like that. thing gun violence. People say, ""well restrictions/regulations guns get rid gun violence even bother?"" America become fatalistic defeatist? That's outdated view Chinese economy Chinese culture. 2020 cities developed American cities internal market become bigger world. unlike West keep developing country without needing deal elections democracy. least get COVID-19 test beforehand decrease chance taking COVID-19 home them. USA forgot get memo wave ends goes down?

Because going up. honestly don‚Äôt understand flack Newsom gets handling covid, including public figures influence like Joe Rogan saying open state anyone, even Kenneth West, would better. disagree matters, fine, know policies areas can‚Äôt speak that, solely looking covid seems like situation incredibly unpopular moment, retrospect people realize best. fact enormous number people large economy yet covid spread contained (relative rest US sets bar low), commend taking advice experts succumbing dip popularity. freebasing dried booger rocks name Stephen Cameron, newest article see [this nothing recent.

It says hopes pilot plane early next year, go lots physiotherapy.

I see flew Vietnam Airways, hopefully get job back continue :) medical knowledge thinking evil. Wbu? seem unwilling accept facts though. Wonder works? Yeah, know always cases since can't test everyone day, said 150k 600k? Note- added name enough letters post link. wouldn‚Äôt post without enough characters. Victoria, Australia. silly helps getting compliance rates up. know point is. republican president shut border, republicans, let alone current president, give two fucks people make big deal about. warm first wave, least northern US. hungry guy, too-- weighed second time weighed first! never actually stopped eating time, though... Swede highly disagrees strategy straight tell wrong. never policy, anyone think that. spreading misinformation. Czech guy here. agree, unfortunately. heading towards catastrophe number people think covid exist kind plot fuck economy absolutely mind boggling. clear moderate severe asthma. get lucky enough pass genetically get based parental decisions, I'd consider unforgivable. 

You've never experienced drowning sitting couch. 

I godson home schooled parents (age 4) he's fine. parents nurses taking seriously be. 

But situation. get lucky kids escape unharmed. also get unlucky, hope get unlucky. 

Although mention fully ignoring potential disease vector outlined many times. Even escape unharmed, still bring home you. Well since can‚Äôt skip work 2 wks family hated restaurant idea almost much people, we‚Äôre going scrap Thanksgiving altogether. Watching kid‚Äôs face every joyful occasion gets crossed calendar like torture. Counterpoint headline:No new cases COVID-19 New Zealand [People mistakenly perceive coronavirus grow linear manner, underestimating actual potential exponential implementing mass testing/contact tracing.

LOL

Stop embarrass even more. 24 reinfections noted. Nope. said incredibly unlikely. Add soccer players worldwide going since June, college football, baseball, MLS, NBA bubble, hockey, motorsports every sport world going lately issues like exceptionally rare. socialism safety net?

Also me, already place Europe. proposal recipe disaster. virus vast majority people even know had! We're doomed!  Yes, agenda get truth things. racist?  

To refresh memory, calling open borders trump called racist trying border control. Oh bad. Sorry. misunderstood sentences. thought got positive ‚Äúagain‚Äù long recovered. Excess mortality France still baseline: shaken hand almost eight months. Couple gloved fist bumps. Dutch strange people. Ive lived    close Holland life plenty experience dealing them. 

When tourist visiting country, come across friendly, smart, responsible open minded people around.

But spend longer period time facade often starts crumble. What's underneath far less admirable.   Tibetans think people need see overflowing hospitals dead bodies piled , like physically see eyes, take seriously. want happen would take people It‚Äôs unbelievably frustrating anti mask family. Like I‚Äôm college student taking online classes such, relatively social distanced. Probably much be, like compared family I‚Äôm considered 

The question point isn‚Äôt even ‚Äúhow deal pandemic degree distance quarantine‚Äù, arguments tend along lines ‚Äúis Covid even bad, statistics inflated, masks even anything?‚Äù. I‚Äôve started using excess death statistics instead Covid statistics doesn‚Äôt make difference anymore. people use logical arguments cite sources, often, close family like father brother succumbing confirmation bias. always cases actually reported, higher positivity rate suggests undertesting. actual number gave random guess seems appropriate Every single thread mentioning waves someone makes comment. get it, cases never decreased negligible level totally third wave know, never really though faking virus test global pandemic state national emergency, cant really tell. Yes mass surveillance internment camps totally code ‚Äúwe care you‚Äù. say died actually died something else, covid-19. say media hyping, sheeple believe. stay tf away people costs. associate liabilities waiting. Celebratory donut time.

I feel like we‚Äôve bloody earned it. Lol alarmist doomsaying finest. Bravo! Meh, like second wave, third wave bad - things average, really. worse second wave, sure, still better fourth one going be. 

;) Well....maybe stop denigrating moronic hillbillies they‚Äôd amenable listening. 

I get you‚Äôre saying you‚Äôre probably right. knowing that, approach conversation without turning making feel like view idiots? 

The number one reason projects fail breakdown/barrier communication. language communication style would likely penetrate consciousness might otherwise tune ‚Äúhigh falootin‚Äô talk‚Äù? adjust message make easier receive? trust data Vietnam China, two history flexible truth suits ""social distancing defiance"" constitutes visiting family holidays, guess I'm gonna guilty. I've working ass year others got sit home cushy homes safety. attending family gathering Thanksgiving person. Especially since lockdown end sight. government cannot prevent seeing family. don‚Äôt really buy sturgis rally answer everything 

Not many Philadelphians Bostonians attend rally‚Äôs lol

Like said, correlation equal causation probably referring Portland, (often demonized conservative media), article Portland, Maine... controversial city. split gatherings, everyone need gather one place? two-three households per gathering, depending size household. instance, Mom 3 kids that's 4 different households. one kid household visit Mom, two kids visit other. Seeing family important smaller gatherings thoroughly dampens chance contracting spreading COVID. idea ""social bubbles"" discussed months now, people still get it? Frankly, people started making holiday plans way point. Obviously, gather someone household ill high-risk. 

I grow big family gathering thing Thanksgiving/Christmas, can't quite relate. understand make holidays little smaller mean they're canceled. someone else said, *Candida auris* fungi yeast.

To add resistance note, strains found resistant fluconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin (aka ampho-terrible). first two first line defense systemic fungal infections. encouraging Candida species developed much resistance quickly since discovery 2009. need advocate effective measures

Also consider areas bad contact tracers telling people themselves. Masks would still work even contact tracers overwhelmed state hired enough people

Sounds similar UK, though even make kids wear masks school. One thing guess we're OKish remote work. people still (I since March).

I'm pretty resigned huge, rolling second wave. Herd immunity people going get wish accident rather design.  ***far right*** protest fascist lockdowns curfews. think it‚Äôs I've spent lot time Indonesia I've always enjoyed it. Unfortunately Corona response good example religion kept away politics. There's 9PM-6AM curfew live (France), bars closed restaurants soon follow.

That means dating, meeting new people, even friends evening completely question now... so, yes, restrictions quite arduous, especially considering government still mandating work home whenever possible...

Plus, there's instability measures : nobody even knows point restriction we'll next week, impossible make kind plan, situation looks like going last months That's choice. get make Individual choices. They're actually expecting quite wet summer. can‚Äôt. 
There lot cases people used fantasy names like Batman Mickey Mouse. That‚Äôs get fine catch using wrong informations. 
Problem is, bartenders staff right check identity. deny entrance service police ‚ÄúOrdnungsamt‚Äù allowed check identity. 
So reality use fake information long ask id. need stop saying 200k deaths covid. 6% covid main cause. rest comorbidities life expectancy. One thing COVID-19 crisis made insanely aware much people care *visible* action. Swedish ""experiment"" encourage change instead enforcing it, practical terms indeed work. 

It ain't visible though, ain't accompanied strong language ""banned"" ""prohibited"", accompanied policies mandating fines actions taken upon rulebreakers, must ""experiment"".

I'm proud Sweden they've handled COVID-19, even though wish could've fewer fuck-ups long-term peripheral issues kept cool. demanded action sake it, required action sake it. We've also kept politics *mostly* it, agency primarily charge maintained high public trust throughout. 

It gives comfort knowing cooler heads prevailed, anticipate ain't gonna last crisis experience time planet. way federalism flawed. U.S. constitution prohibits federal government issuing mandates closing internal borders. Yeah that's months (surprised long took develop first place). mean anything - data collected even says does. Exactly. OP trying claim weeks lockdown would stop virus. 

Melbourne lockdown hard many months, what, hundred cases day? still couldn‚Äôt. 


When Europe first going lockdown 150,000 day individual countries. 

You guys live fantasy land think lockdown would weeks would stop virus Europe Oh...... I'm sorry.
I understand now. know afraid imprisoned speak regime. Say more.

Hang there, buddy. Edited, got confused language. enabled default sure! heartbreaking see USA leader many wonderful human endeavours withdraw become nasty, selfish, squabbling nation. wonder totalitarian countries like China easily influence world policy US abandoned space? much hope right election result November destruction US' reputation reversed. misread it. I'm sorry. Rule 2: Edited titles

Is copper beneficial COVID-19 patients? Yeah we‚Äôre gonna good don‚Äôt got time energy argue considering made clear multiple times personal normalcy timeline even semi normalcy much farther people  also case HK Taiwan well. exporting multiple places make sense everyone trying gang taiwan. hell live?

 assure Europe everything functioning normally. thought America know enough culture counter argue, maybe care more. 

I'm horrorstruck news also care family. 

It's competition. don‚Äôt understand point. I'm English, live China. another point? Show Zoom hurt you. yea. agree. US states chance, far know contact tracing programs really didn‚Äôt get ground promised. Leadership failures, assume. Fingers crossed change mind next month. Millions never actually get better.

Reported misinformation. spread lies.  people getting pensions cost money? Wow, dont seem like they‚Äôre generating tax dollars.... We're indeed OK letting elderly terminally ill die alternative life sake it, life sake kinda context life rational person would want.

Somehow callous Sweden called still managed far higher average life expectancy countries world, including developed countries. care, we're sadistic enough kind dignified death policies we're sadistic point lunacy. countries ASEAN handling well, except Indonesia Philippines. Laos Cambodia seem OK infrastructure limited hard entirely sure. 

Thailand good job King rock star monarch, supposedly hiding somewhere tens women, sparked riots protests. Vietnam battling floods Central Vietnam far kill 3 times COVID did. happened UK numerous European nations went lockdown. Sweden place used triage. Sumeria, United States, 3 days ago

Warning: may cause severe disfiguring burns malfunctions That‚Äôs correct. people dying almost entirely retirees. **opt-out** default... think fair analysis. two things would like object to. 

1. one succeeded yet. early tell even things look really promising Asian countries. celebration bridge Czech Republic example quick things turn happen get complacent. 
2. OP said ‚Äúgoing‚Äù herd immunity actively promoted. hasn‚Äôt anywhere. Flattening curve approach means don‚Äôt aim totally eradicate though. 

Thanks! Honest question: person identified cases left totally incorrect contact information? fines actually enforced? 
I personally problems giving information help contact tracing always wondered concept really works Well, username may give away preference. highlight specifically like it, think economic system designed serve populace. Right now, humans serve system, think system serve people. pandemic hit, logical thing would everyone stay home weeks, expand food delivery, deal outlying situations could threaten quarantine. one worry food, money, safety. Instead, economic system requires serve profit times. extremely bad everyday life pre-pandemic, got really noticeable pandemic struck people chose eating contracting deadly virus. I‚Äôll finish saying don‚Äôt think system exists yet earth. level, nation serve profit moment. manage dichotomy better others, shows. (Compared Canada‚Äôs stimulus programs vs own, example). COVID app doesn‚Äôt support yet, mean capability OS, it‚Äôs settings iPhone enabled data captured. Weird cause live people taking things quite seriously, masks mandatory public places (indoors), covid numbers remain low. Makes quite proud actually. Sorry things aren‚Äôt area. Studies take while. debunk (if necessary) better. president what?

Reddit needs stop USA-centric views. /r/Coronavirus, /r/USApolitics tested, like everybody said still be.  know nations, China either lie numbers aggressive contact tracing, both. Every time new domestic cluster, announce names, addresses movements new cases, effort identify, isolate test everyone came contact them, fails establish chain transmission, test entire cities. cannot hiding numbers trying type public contact tracing, process transparent definition. mean ain't wrong, redirecting covid money oil company subsidies serves 2 purposes:

It helps hurting oil companies

It lowers population dakotas causes amount people unemployed lessen (because they're dead) none, red blooded 'murican's freedom...... Honestly way pandemic turned morbid competition covid deaths counts, helps explain ""Recent estimates also suggest 6,000 children could die every day preventable causes next six months result pandemic-related disruptions essential health nutrition services.""  rich people rich countries busy comparing numbers (Aproximately 250 people die Sweden every day, 2 covid) much worse catastrophy happening poorer countries.

This mean 2 deaths arent horrible. also mean lockdowns bad lockdowns scale. dont think lock Ivorytowers anymore thinking ourselves. 

This report UN paints similarly horrible picture.

‚ÄúThis pandemic already caused biggest global education emergency history, increase poverty make hard vulnerable children families make loss‚Äù, said Inger Ashing, CEO Save Children. ¬†

‚ÄúChildren lose education likely forced child labour early marriage trapped cycle poverty years come. cannot afford let whole generation children become victims pandemic. National governments international community must step soften fuck bullshit? compared bunch unrelated figures said Sweden's numbers ""ass"".

Do Yanks find rhetoric convincing? age specific IFR values also considered reverse analysis like know recently virus spreading young people. using average population IFR value like 0.6% 0.25% would also lead underestimate recent cases. fact China detected first mean China exported loads cases. Yeah, going happen families, least can't say warned. give type recommendation.  85% Swedes live urban areas. clearly know nothing part world. don‚Äôt feel like that. Makes proud people, live we‚Äùbe wearing masks part covid numbers remain low. 20 years old, absolutely ending sight, already wasted away 8 months youth point. brutally honest, reason going clubs bars right open. think safe assume never club bar event since absolutely ending. goalposts keep moving. mean there? NZ covid tracker support it. whole UX shit show. need scroll thru bunch screens see 30+ different apps heaps US states.

Plus GMail seems bouncing 2FA emails sent NZ Covid tracker. literally cannot sign use using Gmail. wants three years grandma /s

I almost see /s, intended grinded teeth thinking,

Oh course, mr noodles1972..... still headline happens rarely absolutely earthly clue, UK world reopened schools. deserve Yeah, agree that. still wash hands stay distanced! Considering fate nursing home residents places, course Vietnamese care family members more.  said, I'm pretty sure insurance heavily charged people bills. Source ""Tibet exist"" killing doctors? I've heard crazy shit China, pretending Tibet exist is...

Also, they've going hard covid19 since day 1, building hospitals, quarantining Wuhan, testing whole cities single-digit number cases, testing frozen food, etc.

I mean, they're testing frozen food... sign overstaying people Kiwis, can't send back home could death sentence, they're working holiday tourists kinda need people fill roles. reminds idiocracy's [opening hey, guys turned around.

Not me! visitor get back job China. think government generally done decent job, subservient sensible reactions public. big problems seem Sabah, get impression things quite organised wrt tracking, testing, quarantining KL still illegal immigration bringing virus in. 

Not Indonesia knowledge place, except they're well 'rona. I've Vietnam times colleague 'stuck' there, spent January March Thailand bit knowledge situation too, another colleague family Philippines says pretty bad. Privacy irrelevant data stays device. Alerts give user opportunity share contact data nz contact tracers. govt gets nothing without specific action alerted user. user tests positive, mostly get persuaded right thing, legal requirement. state dependent oil work jobs tax revenues, yes Aside application technology specialized applications (hospital bedding, mobile emergency hospital tenting walls surgical spaces, etc.) idea seems pretty silly. concerned fomite transmission virus clothing. opinion falls ""any way make buck"" category silly things. you‚Äôd risk shutting one businesses $100 loss product?

Sounds silly. person acting like child, threw fit couldn‚Äôt get wanted. absolutely put mask. kind behavior can‚Äôt tolerated enforced, giving reinforces it. resent use ""we"" lol. that's surprising considering told us drink bleach shove uv light ass. mean, maybe. already make masks antimicrobial coatings silver threads etc. Helps keep stinking guess. I'd still recommend aforementioned good practices though, right? Yep. slightly better worst worst. Congrats agree notion. tell factcheck website sys 220k died want. problem is...that doctors, er nurses, hospitals admitting every day padded numbers deaths get money states gvnmnt. countless people even state NY admitting back May...it ain't conspiracy. Melbourne 7 cases today. 

Lets compare shithole..... Western countries acted conventional wisdom western epidemiology cannot stop kind virus. plan flatten curve 70-80% ppl getting it. Ppl taking Asian countries seriously cure cannot worse disease talk.

Asian Oceanic nations tried impossible succeeded. either eliminated surpressed virus. Western countries rub eyes flattening curve proves much difficult previously thought economic damage strategy far worse economic damage successful elimination/suppression strategy. embarrassing.

Trump trying stop counting election night, people upset results sides matter goes, people going ‚Äúwatch‚Äù process, contested results, etc. etc. etc. Trump wins anything clear count, protests guaranteed. riots BLM, could happen again. prepared smart.

It‚Äôs think something happen (especially sleepy city), it‚Äôs year, think anything COULD happen. don‚Äôt trust 2020 right now. valid points, include COVID related factors widely ignored statistics, heart damage, neurological damage, long-term illness disability due COVID; people die COVID counted ""recovered"" despite fact millions never actually get better.

Edit: superfluous word Unfortunately, it‚Äôs accurate Utah places. Me, too! Didn‚Äôt realize 5 magic number.  light see tunnel coming toward you....that 18 wheeler covid 19 license plate. not? Coronavirus Corona nicknames covid-19.

Lol no, know first thing this?

Being infected corona one thing, developing disease (covid) throw away lives?

a) Lockdowns killing scores people too, especially children 3rd world

b) Sorry, gonna sell nanny state. adamant safety, lowering speed limit 15, banning non-healthy food, mandate daily exercise (see: 1984), etc?

The truth scared personal less-than 0.002% chance dying. give less sh\*t downtrodden (see point above), kindly bugger grandstanding thing happened WI - cold weather 

I telling you, post many times, hard catch virus outdoors. difficult 

Indoors people sharing air, especially recycled air, thats killer. Thats virus goes crazy. Bars restaurants churches prime vectors. That‚Äôs crazy, don‚Äôt mind asking? dems know ward somebody openly gay neverrrr would flown, church pretty notoriously anti-LGBT. remember horrified sister law nonchalantly told BYU ‚Äúcleared theatre department‚Äù aka kicked LGBT people 7 weeks ago day 25,000 new cases.

smh 26 million confirmed cases worldwide handful reinfections enough make question decades understanding around viral mutations? Even there's already evidence Covid-19 antibodies protect 5-7 months [1]?

You never 100% safe infection, even vaccine, massively hypocritical say assuming kind immunity exists ""ignoring science""

The mentally ill vote

But intelligent reformed criminal felony 5 years ago can‚Äôt.  i'd say would take many people involved conspiracy worthwhile. also high gamble since seems like ""it happened happen me"" people thinking right lol read comment focused justification ‚Äúif take dose everyone ‚Äú. missed ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not‚Äù part. Apologies. 

Ireland getting hundred thousand far realistic. point referenced article 

I‚Äôd say Americans haven‚Äôt clue ‚Äútheir‚Äù vaccines made assume it‚Äôs made onshore.  remainder, altruists selfish. I‚Äôd say current administration would higher proportion selfish likely incoming.  yes, would less likely share. believe advance purchased Moderna production. put efforts avoiding virus instead avoiding testing. stapled really hurts use fighting toilet paper! lie send kid school infect &amp; kill teacher? sympathy financial situation ends intentionally endanger someone elses life. 
 
Additionally, heres ‚Äòwork die‚Äô doesn‚Äôt work. Turns global pandemics affect peoples workspace, shouldn‚Äôt starve family that. charge comments make publicly. shocking headline date regular occurrence year goes probably make headlines much younger people catch virus. encourage people extort. made believe soul important possession whole life way save everything church wants do, it.

wanna progress church? need paying tithing.

wanna get married? tithing

wanna go temples? tithing

wanna take sacraments? tithing

of course, paying tithing get blocked every ""privilege"" church, everyone notices get ostracised.

i mean $100 billion ""rainy day"" fund hid years members would keep paying 10% wages every week.

that money supposed go people need aid countries.

if math member count working-age vs 10% average wage inflow money staggering, enough make sizable dent world hunger, use that, horde build massive marble gold temples world (which ask EXTRA donations for).

there's also missionary program, expected every male serve mission upon turning 18. save money first privilege going, still paying tithing, get part-time jobs saving giving away everything earn, highschool.

and get shipped ""MTC"" missionary training centre brainwashed 3 months environment lives breathes church, sent different country 2 years recruit members. meanwhile, young females church constantly brainwashed thinking need marry returned missionary lots babies.

oh time abstinence upheld (for majority) church slaps guys girls programs like ""young single adults"" within months every returned missionary married breeding like rabbits.

it's sick cult designed one thing, make money. actually really funny. seriously wonder people would react walked wearing mask holding one hand said ‚Äúhey tested positive Covid. Would like mask?‚Äù almost guarantee anti-masktards would grab fast run. Like think they‚Äôre invincible Covid won‚Äôt bad get that‚Äôs real reason won‚Äôt wear it. can‚Äôt physically see eyes, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs problem. May good time pick airlift insurance. I'm sure mentioned colder weather lack sunlight going lead virus live longer. Days shorter less sun due rain snow. mean generally think it‚Äôs pretty clear Europe European Union completely different concepts. One geographic region political economic organization. Like someone says North America everyone knows region made US, Canada, Mexico, etc... Slovakia seems like shit together, Americans banned still? actually still enforce 14-day quarantine arrivals even democratic regime.  now. Problem fall enough supplies helped beds ran out, causing choices made terms patients supplies. supply bit bigger now, eventually going reached lockdowns instituted quick enough, frankly seems like we're really close late. Guess time tell may never reach level death rate, still point got spring, we're headed way. Still know treat bit better now, knows. see ""wear mask we'll make wear one"" going well w/ crowd already wearing them.  government actually wants help population gives emergency funds ppl youre Canada, get tested get 2K month paycheque stay home instead. Eating outside relatively safer. isn‚Äôt option? Yeah really dont care anymore. know 20+ people covid ranging 18-63 years seem fine. probably point well. I'll wear mask I'm public, I'm still gonna celebrate 99.98 + 0.0002 != 100%

your decimal Exactly, million dead U.S next Easter. Like laughed at, called crazy. flu said, ignorance country staggering!! comment makes feel like pro-life narrow limited definition. Please that. see comments wishing harm others, report we'll remove ban offender. ‚ÄúTake it, nothing lose‚Äù Wednesday? Wow. [tweeted mocking candidate protecting COVID Thursday. Guess he's concerned.....maybe planned keep secret. Precisely! People need aware this.

As people USA strong united.

But nothing alone divided. need keep fighting good fight.

.... it‚Äôs getting tipping point think us sound values minds tested ways never been. 

It may get point life may laid line. together

I, you, us everyone believes another way.

Not us opportunity protest. us opportunity uphold data, reason science. ignorant loud voice- platform carries it. numbers don‚Äôt lie. go hate again. 

What sad existence must lead. Lol Foreal. People fucking soft. Obviously every one staying home. hard say. declarative predictions based extrapolation tend pan out.

i think get 100,000 new cases day soon... Still here! sad people would physically verbally assault someone mask. wear mask protect follow State‚Äôs mandates. someone else doesn‚Äôt want wear one that‚Äôs them. IMO, way cops would feel compelled enforce mandate would incentivize ticketing. I've heard many reports ""we beat it"" places cases rise again. Poe‚Äôs Law strikes... again! Anti Swedish propaganda.?? Hahahahaha like Sweden Swedes. think guys made huge mistakes (which admit) you‚Äôve made good progress. Much policies line countries. countries hopefully really less hard lockdowns. Hopefully guys bit wear masks. spread getting narrow. good. How‚Äôs anti sweden ?? Tennessee past week work. training employees business new computer software. state wide mask mandate governor. 

I watched one person purposefully snap strap mask training started. sitting across room jokingly said ‚ÄúAh, see problem me. Extra big ass head. causes mask straps break.‚Äù

His response ‚ÄúWell don‚Äôt work anyway!‚Äù

I said ‚ÄúCorrect, don‚Äôt work broken.‚Äù

He said ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt ever work.‚Äù

I employees express belief virus would magically disappear election. Still others insist it‚Äôs hoax Dr. Fauci lied political reasons. 

Near end week several employees tested positive COVID management tried hide us. found manager pulled job I‚Äôm returning. 

I took COVID test today I‚Äôm socially distancing wife, wearing mask inside home, sleeping different bedroom, disinfecting everything go near, generally worrying every moment every day test negative. 

There sizable portion population US believe virus real threat. people operating purely political channels refuse listen science. science doesn‚Äôt exist, it‚Äôs hoax. 

I careful cautious think family fine given current circumstances, beg take seriously take basic precautions slightly uncomfortable, may help save lives loved ones, friends, acquaintances, even people either don‚Äôt know, don‚Äôt care about, even actively despise. don‚Äôt know Italy Germany numbers rising people (even mask wearers) meeting friends family privately closed rooms. infections aren‚Äôt public. :( Mandate cannot work. Simply offer incentives help slow spread masking, like discounts testing chance get vaccinated first. know works NZ, China South Korea done it. dumb though. 
My number covid death rate, first factor chance they'll catch corona first place, corona turn covid, given.

Coronavirus Corona nicknames number way off

It projection sure, point throw away lives?  high survival rate accurate either especially hospitals fill start turn people away happen go nothing (herd immunity) reputable scientist suggests. feels like capitalism. sources say cloth non medical mask prevent infection? I‚Äôm genuinely curious optimistic you‚Äôre right - you‚Äôre saying seems consensus can‚Äôt find scientific study backs claim! Let know please! rigorous large-scale randomized, controlled clinical trial proving whether hydroxychloroquine effective **preventing** COVID-19, adding less rigorously controlled studies,‚Äù said lead researcher Dr. Ruanne Barnabas, associate professor medicine global health UW School Medicine. ‚ÄúThe additional data today provides strong evidence hydroxychloroquine offers benefit preventing people developing COVID-19 14-day treatment course.‚Äù

So anyone else wondering ‚Äúwhy still hydroxchloroquine COVID studies‚Äù, appears study intended see whether prophylactically taking HCQ *prevents* COVID developing first place, doesn‚Äôt. 

I think studies evaluated whether HCQ effectively treats COVID already developed, doesn‚Äôt. least wears mask.  French daily deaths/day 5 summer US 800 so.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* hope alright! I'm sure ok decades cocaine gatherings Uh huh, rhetoric information slanting cause 300,000 excess deaths far US... Frankly orange menace unlikely still contagious point sarcastic, right?!?!??! Oh right, room plague people. Oh hell no. work retail see someone wearing mask stay hell away them. I'm risking life (or life immunocompromised parents) job I'm treated like sacrificial lamb instead human being. nothing. hadn‚Äôt politicized Trump people might stood chance least mostly early days. 

Everyone remember Trump failed us again. Amongst downvotes - person contribute sources came conclusion couldn‚Äôt find anything preventing infection. lowering viral load. still confused happening lol actual forest fires CA had, won‚Äôt anything left burn next year! /s Pump little more. basically...corticosteroids. Fauci, among medical personnel, operate basis available evidence. beginning pandemic, yet clear airborne. seems entirely appropriate reserve masks likely close contact lots sick people. Every single time too, I'm glad he's continuing come back negative Humanity corrupt. guarantee kind thing happening everywhere virus is.  way guys! Saturday gives numbers Friday first encounter. obvious don‚Äôt understand Swedish culture anti Sweden bias. pushing anti Swedish propaganda. seen contact trace data Italy. US: Los Angeles County Health Department able trace 65 70% positive cases . those, majority, 55%, gathering/events.The Health Department specify events' settings ( indoor / outdoor). second place, 17%, places worship. 6% childcare, 4% schools, 3% colleges, (education mostly online LA) 15% unspecified. http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=2760

Data UK: top four workplaces, educational settings, nursing homes, food/dining. Page 16: couple points: describe people *think* got infected, nessecarily really got infected. open/closed region matters lot. I‚Äôm sensitive all. lot people are. try defend rationalize everything. It‚Äôs quite amazing specifically designed limit freedoms order fight pandemic. That's literally entire point laws.

If able provide alternative definition, I'm ears though.  news No, think America great. testing situation bad claim. Quit trying put words mouth. It‚Äôs news first debate said they‚Äôd release results every test. Every piece news doesn‚Äôt important thing world. would one stock election? Yes, happens take pandemic seriously. El Paso? that‚Äôs supposed current hot spot state. not....well figures published rubbish barely worth response.

Kids get it, spread it. That's enough reason. Yeah, r/angryupvote Key peele Obama anger translator bit real Obama.  busy making normal masks give away need mandatory negative covid tests sports athletes

If incentivizes faking, put huge ass fine proven lie covid results. 

Pretty much method left since seems like want put table instead.  Wisconsin way. local police never wear masks themselves. saw officer approach car without mask person refused roll window crack big enough slip ID promptly roll back up. cop mask went back car. 

Enforcement would impossible national level can't happen local level. Oh boy! Guess I‚Äôll stay inside hope best! There's less sun due northern hemisphere pointed away sun. Less less daylight regardless rain snow. That's charge Thousands people gathering streets shoulder shoulder screaming shouting... totally okay. Gathering church, even socially distanced masks? literally killing people.

Funny people still playing cards here.  said hoax convincing people become ill.

If sarcasm obvious, interwebs pretty hopeless. Even right-wing wingnuts saying that. state. spring patients weren‚Äôt really coming hospital people still scared covid. furloughing staff didn‚Äôt patients. everyone coming hospital everything elective surgery patients occupying bed helpful.  2 hours everybody use bathroom...  start remove mask saying, ‚ÄòThanks. know, don‚Äôt symptoms tested positive.‚Äô understand part, question is, someone bringing home, got outside home, getting from. mean agree completely statement, people take different aspects think makes stand out. 

But reality, kids going parents en masse saying, 

""You know Mom Dad, think supposed born woman (or man) , go ahead get sex change operation""? 

What trying say kids taking labels certain way. identifying certain group going ahead, trying not.

But actually getting together changing genders like flipping switch. really doubt kids getting together saying group friends saying "" Hey y'all, lets change genders""! 

I see common thing. 

I'd love see research articles info kind thing : ). Hard avoid surge they're major travel hub middle can‚Äôt assume assert generalized speaking group people exhibit behavior. Specifically anti-maskers. Whereas comment directed me, individual. 

That's impressive mental gymnastics. guess.... Everyone dumb never asserted that. Nice strawman. assertion come conclusions using primary sources talking heads. direct response accusation otherwise.

But nobody else does? questions? done white knighting dude internet points?

Did hear CNN WaPo? Yeah that‚Äôs good point ‚Äî study probably set motion several months ago  Mine same, oh record numbers?
It's OK mask ""the lords protection"" go church, eat friends maybe unnecessary shopping hours, walk around coughing without covering mouth face. No, really die! quarter million Americans far. Probably half million February. never great Georgia, still visit mom stepdad monthly. Like me, go grocery shop doctor appointments. Well, go every month haircut, visits I'm quarantining seeing them. make 3-person pod that's fine level risk. affidavit mean oath?  Frail? 


I think projecting problems onto others. people stupid selfish politics too. opend allowed much early police even send high fines someone breaking rules. hit us hard enough scare people wave do. sad first things need happen people recordnise what's going anyone done ""I'm tired winning"" reply yet? Yes, really hopeful going get better. it‚Äôs shit show. Idealogical subversion. folks follow drool every word conditioned decades institutions created. set actions flames fanned wish us fail. moment ran office, entities knew would able sit back watch divisions country grew day.  Sorry, lost 'IDK' üò≥ Holy smokes bars still open Italy? really feel lucky live pandemic. town high proportion well educated people shows. would super scary live city rn, especially USA. Stay safe! mind, he‚Äôs nascar lap surprisingly well considering advocating mask-wearing (in stark contrast Germany live), think finally come bite them.

Germany great either, number new infections per capita still significantly lower countries Europe. China's pollution actually skyrocket baseline got disease mostly contained, industry started playing catch-up? read right german news article another anti-corona demo planned 5pm Berlin organizers registered 10k people.

What find interesting pensioneers disabled people among protests. people protesting government tries protect them; can't protest virus away, virus gladly jump onto chance gets. definitely places capitalism missing regulation.

Holes muffler, speak lockdown illinois. Numbers going head winter. good **Estimated** IFR. That‚Äôs existing restrictions, course. Also based estimating total infections unknown number. Even that, death concern. Getting sick severe illness. Yes, survive brutal infection causing high fever, hallucinations, vomiting, diarrhea, trouble breathing (!!), COMPLETE loss taste smell. People even report shitting pissing themselves. hell would want go that? would OK family going that? It‚Äôs like saying come get shot leg, it‚Äôll hurt bit long doesn‚Äôt hit main artery you‚Äôll 99% survival rate. one wants accept kind pain suffering life, especially knowing could give people care about. You‚Äôre basically arguing fucking Tide Pod challenge. Come get super sick feel worse ever take like 6 months back normal lung capacity you‚Äôll live though! Schools.
7 million students classrooms 20/30 spending 4 5 hours day 6 days week MASKS. think reporting standards different Saturday/Sunday reason. numbers always weird weekend. colleague US tested positive. kids get tested though 'didn't want get nose-swabbed'. win federal government gets shit together passes something people.

That would require caring people themselves. Sweden still higher foreign debt Denmark.

Denmark borrowed money ready needed (they almost free money current ultra low interest rates).

In numbers Denmark foreign debt 95bn kroner, 170bn kroner ready Nationalbank. Denmark wanted, Denmark could pay foreign debt still money bank. Mentioned couple times - I've got friend works NHS made clear three weeks ago there's lot confidence we'll able roll frontline workers 80's around Christmas. They've already got full roll plan established vets, army etc. 

It'll spring we're comfortable zone imagine, we'll see massive dip death rate Jan/Feb get vulnerable inoculated quickly. guess offering control group masks interventions. Good luck. child go quarantine exposed school? parents quarantined child go every day? Same. Lately scroll thru friends‚Äô stories IG/Snap, actually start wondering Ive (or am) hallucinating pandemic. guys promising make sure vaccine safe release right? Hilarious. I'm envious you. Even people complying mistakes Toronto lead spread. 95% people wearing masks taking simple precautions small town kills odds much community spread. hasn‚Äôt Uber conservative time pandemic, don‚Äôt know appeal authority fallacy would effective Well receive $765 million Trump administration make ‚Äúdrug ingredients‚Äù course bullshit like tsunamis! Feel much. family cautious still feels like one else is. twin‚Äôs grade, less 1/3 parents chose distance learning kids. haven‚Äôt eat since February desire to. don‚Äôt gather anyone outside neighborhood bubble feels like exception rule. It‚Äôs kind depressing alienating. constantly remind rational reasonable.  say it, declared it. spending lot time excusing homicidal behavior.

That's is. zero excuse homicidal behavior. send biological weapon public place matter reason. I‚Äôm US, one seems giving shit college cases here. It‚Äôs infuriating end.

They‚Äôre 19 years old might breathing like elderly asthmatic rest lives, sure, Dean Shithead, it‚Äôs ‚Äúmanageable.‚Äù 

Two months ago everyone figured colleges would shut two weeks handful kids got it, wouldn‚Äôt they? Turns couldn‚Äôt possibly give less shit us. comment spot on.

BMI works great people easily accessible people. cheap tools measuring body fat percent accurate either. really need get hydrostatic weight test MRI accurate number. Export recovery. 100k day election bad headline Trump. Many restaurants dine in. Carry only. it‚Äôs biggest jump cases we‚Äôve far?? hospitalization numbers also increasing couple weeks probably record numbers too

‚ÄúScary‚Äù good talking virus that‚Äôs killed people 7 months EVERYTHING else America except heart disease car crashes... People wearing masks outside walking dogs responsible spreading ... crowded bars churches indoor restaurants. I‚Äôm SoCal, it‚Äôs spreading uncontrollably too. takes time wave new infection reach us, it‚Äôs like close borders people coming going. Winter tough California, Covid fatigue full force fact matter lots people still don‚Äôt get want over. 

This article won‚Äôt age well. US testing per thousand people Italy. definitely positive cases reported, almost definitely rate. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rounding corner‚Äù Yeah guys def somewhere between. Could reach first world status decade rate 1) Stand right front them. Try awkwardly position space. 
2) Make eye contact. 
3) Take mask holding eye contact. sure you‚Äôre seem like sad sad life Antigen tests, meant find currently infectious minutes, cost dollars home. China able scale production population level, make mandatory. that, society robust spread larger outbreaks, even without vaccines.

Over Europe, use nursing homes hospitals, sell view care. Germany, fight lobbyists allow counter sales. personally two email threads people, arguments pure evil, coating ludicrous rationalisation attempts. Indeed. I'm laying even supplies everything preparing emotionally mentally very, tough winter. Throwing potential madness around election, can't even imagine country going look like weeks; know we're soon going reach point going - anything - might seem like bad idea. 

I'm worried family friends, I'm worried community country. countries gotten really right every area, U.S. seems uniquely awful incompetence, deliberate abandonment science comes formulating policy, attitudes many citizens themselves. üòúLikewise. seem letting soon!
üòúMe: Keep telling stay positive!
ü§™Oh, we're talking now, we?!
üòúOh, get stuffed! School year observed 90 per cent people detectable antibodies seven months post contracting Sars-CoV-2 

So no, 10% decline per month. sure. Gotta stay vigilant now. party going lockdown whole country, cancel rent various debts, provide things like free healthcare, testing paid sick leave, everything else needs done make virus go away?

What world living in? There‚Äôs covid spreading parties campuses sell plasma party money. MildShock.meme

I‚Äôd joke ‚ÄúkillmeplZ‚Äù that‚Äôs honest fear now. 

I hate everyone politicized this. really hope die excruciating deaths. know lot people community wear masks public, still dine small gatherings homes without masks. think that's what's driving spread. well , know well , can't really call country first world country , ? Technically he‚Äôs wrong. past point ‚Äúcontrolling‚Äù long time.

But still mitigate best practices (masks , social distancing, hygiene) testing tracing. I‚Äôm one spewing opinions said dogs could contract human virus? Ok think birth rate Kevin Bacon away anything matters.

Making babies easy. government really decided needed to, could subsidize it. always pour gas fire easily.

If individuals make choice fewer children later life keep resources themselves, okay? 

It's kind market, human lives worth used be, ethical way deal allow (never force) people conceive less less often He‚Äôs nearing 60 he‚Äôs also facing bit age discrimination. think whole Western neoliberal project death throes, wholly incapable managing major situation coordinating people government accomplish kind change response. pandemic cause problem, pressure puts already strained creaking establishment reveals worsens cracks forming since least Nixon I'd say. 

The binding social connections intrinsically collectivist cultures like China totally absent individualistic yee-haw Reagan capitalism everyone living utter delusion self-sufficient lone wolf, working class solidarity dead buried working class interests brutally silenced perverted corporate elite, old cultural bonds tied people together along ethnic cultural lines obsolete, project Liberal individualism always corral ostensibly self-contained individuals work together towards common goal, become untenable there's social contract bind anyone together anymore. current society made bunch atomized, solipsistic individuals constantly holding guns other. free every person society profoundly indebted everyone else, yet concept collective common good dismissed communist subversion. like house cards cards constantly fighting there's concept greater whole. bunch ants incapable working together anything none acknowledge live existentially indebted society that's much larger themselves. Fucked part antibodies likely gone soon youll able catch again. next wafe going tsunami. roll deep (infections) take much goes back (deaths) heart goes Maine... Massachusetts...

How go you? Hope better! 
My sister currently experiencing persistent, intense stomach pain last couple days. rarely sick overall healthy person, ordinary. didnt mention anything nausea though. guess could anything, still really worried. know stomach pain without fever symtoms could covid, hung family event weekend.... older relatives present......

She described pain coming specific spot ""everywhere"" stomach, also comes""in waves"" like ""stabbing"". you? ever find was? OK now? still October, gonna shitshow January. Yeah let's pretend initial post political Don‚Äôt give up, friend. could try walking running outdoors even winter, insurance may cover light box doctor prescribes it. Fact: virus neither living dead. didn‚Äôt know that, maybe hold making inane comments viral pandemic. downvoted provide sources claims. We're calling 'surges' since apparently 'waves' indicative actually stopping something restart.  zombies always come basement. Lock basement door. economy generates c.38% GDP exports

One word: Oil. Costco.com selling frequently lately (but need membership) Yeah. curve looks like Belgian one. Portugal wasn‚Äôt hard hit spring, right? I‚Äôm afraid, I‚Äôm worried. I‚Äôm worried family members end hospital it. We‚Äôre morons, we‚Äôre cautious that‚Äôs difference.

Hang on. Vietnam third world, countries economy growing superb rate, poverty rate reducing like 5% every year, last time went 2018, people poor part almost everyone roof something eat. Oh yeah that's true forgot people rural areas want wear masks love church. God country gone crazy. would think cloth face big deal literally killed 220k+ people cause stupidity. really STOP TESTING!!

Man, people easily. toil misery unfathomable. Well, imagine want keep power, need make citizens happy. guess what? citizens would happy millions deaths.

It‚Äôs also China best environmental policy among environmental policies far. people went streets voiced displeasure past 20years.

Do ever ask don‚Äôt free speech? last almost-revolution 21 years ago 1980. Back Jan, pointed communist mess up, done, suffer fair Ceasescue. Apparently, communists party knew well. 

So reality, communist party deathly afraid citizens. bet don‚Äôt know tens thousands protests every year. Half concern environment air quality. world back white led believe. determined, though? around two seasons world. months ago Sweden #8 deaths per millions, #17. Nothing relaxed that, people trying summarize effects middle pandemic. 
 
Sweden better stats Estonia 2 weeks March. USA test 10 million people single day? that's way positivity rate 1% countries virus control have. Learn math. Yeah. idiots live here, too, whole family taking seriously, fortunately, employer. We're planning anything holidays. I've wearing mask, actively avoiding businesses require them. 

It feels weird see people throw whole state bus. Last checked, Belgium czechia actually surpassed north Dakota. yeah, ND still ravaged. Probably thing flu shot does. Keep getting sick sick (which lessens spread)... get every year (or more). probably get actual ""heard immunity"" get COVID make millions sick quickly. We‚Äôve already started hitting 1000 deaths day again. We‚Äôd lucky 14,000 deaths next month. Thanksgivings Christmas going superspreading events. factually correct. questioned herd immunity might reached Stockholm, Tegnell answered might case. However, way Swedish government mentioned herd immunity goal ambition. Contrast Australia.

If somehow manage get (the borders closed, still thousand arrivals per week), you‚Äôre escorted armed guard airport specified hotel (also armed guards). won‚Äôt leave room - you‚Äôll tested around days 1, 7 13. -ve day 13, leave. : you‚Äôll stay longer.  You‚Äôll pick cost 3,000 AUD single traveller. 5,000 AUD couple family 3 4. won‚Äôt visitors!

If you‚Äôve contact someone who‚Äôs tested positive, slightest symptoms: you‚Äôll get tested. whole household self isolate negative result. 

Bearing mind - UK almost recorded many new cases 1 day, Australia recorded since March! (27,520), daily country 25 million people getting 10-15 new cases per day (almost all, hotel quarantine: imported).

If Australia comparatively good position, still taking quarantine isolation seriously, UK really ready relaxing (already extremely / too(?!) relaxed) stance?

I know wheee I‚Äôd rather be. Hondurans also left belongings behind, good comparison. context. Always.

Yep. Hospitalizations deaths obviously lag cases clearly rise again. obviously testing like crazy. Remind 4 weeks. one weird headline trick increases clickthrough rate! fella?

... cat called last line. Looks like famous Sweden-hater user back again. time, hate big think starve die.

What this? fifth account? Bummer validated pooled testing national level months ago. We'd saved much time, money, precious limited testing materials. fact October still pooling tests blows mind. beginning, going winter months almost 100,000 new cases day. going troubling winter. Peak Republican, know is? Awesome links. Thanks sharing! article? click link information? won‚Äôt anyone help learn read? far transitioned back full-time due parents complaining. end well, fear.

That's true think. read somewhere Belgium Netherlands highest?

That's correct. SARS1 lasting immunity. Can't believe third world country could overcome ,honestly. it, god, Melbourne city six million gone 500 new cases day months ago less six day average last weeks.We doubt eliminate entirely soon Sydney bigger city less cases Melbourne .Every state city Australia already elimination. dead end February

Give break! idk, know many people UK throwing parties without masks going offices etc. seems like europe thought beat that. Ah, meant that. yeah, bye pal. Surprise Surprise, another rich racist GOP knows make stupid/misleading COVID tweets. Let introduce thing called ""shopping internet."" people gotten twice one states forget exists reminded.

Also, see comment need corporal punishment appalling stupidity ignorance.

A credible source ? UK coming you... ever heard ‚Äòcovid brexit winter‚Äô got trifactor. Gaston County get wrecked ~~rally~~ superspreader event. 20k people standing shoulder shoulder hours. Gaston already hospitalizations Mecklenburg, Mecklenburg 5x population. really state, governor refuses make mandate leave county mayors. one August September, quit mask mandate. Even stores ""required"" mask usage went way down. surprise numbers went roof small county got national list highest infections per 100,000 (we number one, top 15...). mandate end year. County mayor getting tons flack anti mask folks, yesterday wearing them. anywhere near everyone, more. Fuck North Dakota. actually live Norway, italian schools crowded another level compared Scandinavia. lot schools also downtown older buildings public transport reaaly crowded. Anecdotally friends family telling people following rules day go night noone cared anymore God bless you, God bless everybody. let people move people like yourself, everyone needs global China style lockdown least many months?

plus testing everyone Yes, good clarification make. exposing complete inadequacy? Postive attitude sky‚Äôs limit. Philippines consider would probably interested covid South Park episode. üòÇ Oh, made another account Dm still got it. Sorry. Didnt know would happen. Keeps Doctors bay hear need control spread starting think government mandated measures might counterproductive US. 

Bizarrely opposition NPIs become symbol tribal allegiance ‚Äòright wingers‚Äô various stripes. Attempts mandate government fiat actively resisted significant portions population state (WI). 

Without large scale adoption measures like social distancing mask wearing effective, becomes self-fulfilling prophecy opponents. Yet costs still borne adopt.

The Republicans completely poisoned well this. Biden wins, stubborn opposition become stronger, thereby sabotaging government efforts control pandemic. 

What needs happen somehow convince paranoid interest adopt measures, laws mandating it. 

The lockdown strategy work anymore, it‚Äôs costly imposes costs totally unfair ways. 

The way forward public health officials convince many people possible adopt mitigation strategies. Especially convince Republican officials get board strategy *recommendation*. requires ‚Äòde-weaponization‚Äô public health measures tools political advantage. 

Just current thinking. Again? ""we starting"" different question ""we starting"". thought ""turning corner""? Guess we're turning corner straight up. bullish independent peer reviewers informed us Surgisphere would transfer full dataset, client contracts, full ISO audit report servers analysis transfer would violate client agreements confidentiality requirements

Ok malicious all, claim 

but issue confidentiality one myriad studies showing 2400 mg first 24 hours 800 mg day 2 day 10. 10 day course treatment total. quite high doses make sure blood levels got high enough chance killing virus.

Which say even try kill virus need toxic levels drug, testament inneffective itself

Again, deliberately poisoning patients claimed study halted




And two studies, others show evidence well treats corona virus trump basely claims. [Again trump bolsonaro rely quack brazilian doctor claims works evidence] yes sound like youre repeating heard talk radio trying fabricate issue study dissmiss studies showing thing ......... Okay must talking bot. I'm done. I'd proud European response grime recently. Londoner, thought responsible went gym yesterday. person wearing mask whole place, changing rooms, walking around etc, one person full. wife's workplace biweekly testing sent email stating 30% American employees getting tested, 90% European employees getting tested. They're offering 10 paid days employees test positive testings.
Edit: Employees tested positive outside workplace testing also getting 10 paid days off. implying like protesting higher numbers Impossible know since time frame elapsed. Oh hard let's even try then. like republicans climate change. could believe numbers would bad. numbers Inflated make political statement. 

I call fake news. guess would march april. major european american nations approve vaccine see multiple countries latch onto one start vaccinating people. stockpiles building places waiting approval, imagine distribution fast begins.  shows know they're losing election they're gonna burn country Biden gets in.

This way, gets office say ""From day 1, Biden's numbers Covid infections deaths X higher previous administration!"" I've powering VRChat valve index since covid, I'm huge VR developed phantom touch year spending much time it. talking about? said masks alone enough. world imply support wearing masks? fully advocate wearing masks consistently worn mask since mid-March. Outside household members, person seen mouth person since March dentist month ago. 

When pretend like masks solve everything, **you're** one discrediting masks holding impossible standard magic solve-all. fail completely solve everything, gives justification anti-science say ""see? masks pointless!"" course is. comapring using various metrics still good start. agree 1984 sentiment \*ing clue side argument since OP scrolled offscreen. numbers keep increasing real death toll half million people end year. people wear fucking mask social distance number would much lower. administration bury real numbers already said they've given managing pandemic. Snowflake slave mods likd truth particular country. true words country, removes post. treatment posts. I'm making claim ""third wave"" worse previous. Though certainly surprised becomes worse second.

I'm also claiming true number infected currently higher July. We're testing ~1/3 back July. Unless crack 100,000 cases per day, comfortable saying daily infections. 

I also know mortality look like. Though worth saying deaths lag cases weeks complete picture event mid/late-November. 

What saying decrease daily infections July September. I'm claiming despite similar levels testing, 50% fewer daily cases death peak second wave (hit mid August) since abated. think reasonable extrapolate say, although may bad July, cases US rising September.

I think that's bad. controlled properly *could* become worse.

I would define ""wave"" increase infections time decreasing infections. think fair say 3rd wave. think bad wave 1 (early April peak) terms deaths. willing claim pan compared wave 2 (mid July peak).

Wanna meet back month reflect?

RemindMe! 1 month. did, came back slowly 2 week quarantine ended went back work. can't understand given access efficient N95 masks. wrong system? beyond broken.
I never felt hopeless future general life particular. much misinformation one comment. 

1. think serious leader/expert thought virus beaten summer. country fully opened back gone back normal.

2. infection rate 10x first locked down. around 42k new cases UK per day estimated 100-150k cases per day locked down, number number cases per day increasing slower rate. ‚ÄòRounding corner nicely‚Äô know live there. better way would haveing smaller classes online classes messed online long time ago see this. opinion schools spread virus families...

*trust people* work last months still hold this?

the next two weeks, maybe next forceing lockdown.

take care stay save enough stupid people around Lmao can‚Äôt average 30k cases 8 months call second wave get 80k. freedom die street going debt healthcare costs endless pandemic state cannot control. recent post parents understand get kids tested don‚Äôt report effort prevent schools shutting eyes ‚Äúscrewing everyone over‚Äù one encouraged by...  LOL! hypothetical? Only-children school age exist. Thousands them. It‚Äôs world - reopening + pandemic fatigue + people partying/gathering = resurgence.

The places seem control places focused - buy-in population - PPE, distancing contact tracing proper border control like Asian countries like Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore like. places massively hard lockdown virus eradicated time being, went heavy contact tracing testing, mandatory, supervised quarantine border, locking ever new outbreak detected like NZ China. 7x 500 3,500. Would love numbers low. Yeah, care poor corporations instead minimum wage employees lose jobs. anyone vaccine topic?

What timeline talking realistically vaccine widely available across world? Bugs patched later DLC well. estimated 299,028 excess deaths occurred late January October 3, 2020, 198,081 (66%) excess deaths attributed COVID-19. largest percentage increases seen among adults aged 25‚Äì44 years among Hispanic Latino persons.

That sad horrifying. You‚Äôre playing fire there. states remove self-defense justification using weapon instigate conflict. Unless there's mandatory testing students every district every day, believe low school numbers especially reports ""mom code"" Utah parents want get kids tested stay home. Corona virus 7 strains know of. 2 sars mers. 4 known long time now. One also cause flu, though major cause. 4 seasonal. SARS mers short lived see passing seasons. Stood reason similar virus would also seasonal. take office end January wins still alive. pretty conservative guess. Infection numbers lag, emergency measures show start showing results ~10-14 days implemented. USA would go total lockdown would still see least 80k*10 days = 800k new infections days shitty thing drug resistant bug may susceptible others, too. admitted hospital couple years ago multi-drug resistant staph infection ended acquiring C. diff there. was... Unhappy. :/ Got get fracking transitioned out. governments often hide

How ‚Äúhiding epidemiological reasoning‚Äù? It‚Äôs highly contagious. 

From Health officials targeting nightlife partying main sources latest revival infections. That‚Äôs specific number cases occur two days row. not.alone,most people it.
I also talking myself. I've always 
talked pets,so strange. fucking course body makes immunity it. people recover, without gaining immunity it. suffer cytokine storm essentially body's immunity overcompensating killing you. There's nothing new learn videos.

&amp;nbsp;

And *still* substantiate claim made. 

Try using words explain ""The coronavirus nothing flu, many cases even dangerous flu."" maybe? Curve officially flattened 15 minute rule counts Germany too, least use corona app. Almost edgy screen name.. lol. #epsteinhasher Ah, OK. Thanks clarification. thinking terms immunity uncertainty long lasts. can't say immune forever recovery, figured say condition would last forever either. Well, North Dakota top country, sit wheelchair, bundle up, roll downwards. Duh.  Infertility covid side effect fear least. thought cases Suffolk county still going up? stopped paying attention, depressing. work hamptons get vacationers. want strangle them. No, cannot directly compare death rates countries, can't claim Finland higher death rate v's Sweden worse year. 

The annual death rate varies widely country country, there's rough correlation annual death rate proportion elderly population.

For example, death rate 14.74 per 1,000 Latvia 1.298 per 1,000 Qatar (20% 65 years Latvia 1.5% 65 Qatar, due lots guest workers). Similarly, 22.14% people Finland 20% Sweden may partly explain Finland higher average death rate Sweden (fewer elderly).

So compare country itself, current year 5 year average, see there's excess deaths.

Sweden lower average death rate Finland last years:

5 year Death rate (2015-2019): 

9.7 per 1,000 Finland 

9.25 per 1,000  Thanks lot! realize one reason GOP refused give funding state local governments that, universities little choice split hairs (some) close doors good, pissed schools?

You're aiming anger wrong crowd. design demonize education. really uncivil? Huh...  Xinjiang north west really cold right now.  since whole thing started, I've wondering higher use sanitary wipes, hand sanitizer, etc everywhere. coronavirus, remember seeing need cut using hand sanitizer we're creating ""superbugs"" would resistant sanitation treatment.

If excessive cleaning/sanitizing everything becomes norm, allowing dangerous germs develop? This. 

At least America seems can't admit schools kids need stay home, means parents stay home can't that.

Can't admit colleges, kids enroll America's for-profit education system goes can't that.

Can't admit airborne close schools businesses can't that. Don‚Äôt know, obviously within sample size millions cases you‚Äôll get examples re-infection, consensus seems case viruses. everyone‚Äôs immune response same. point try it? point seems ""it enough bother"". see that? virus novel virus, like every year novel virus. Watch videos.

There need panic created measures taken. even novel said is, body makes immunity it. 

Watch videos please share others. ran mental numbers internally rationalized it. 

I ran numbers me. something 100% risk giving Covid, it‚Äôs likely kill riding motorcycle 7,500 miles happily summer. I‚Äôve heard people say they‚Äôre wearing mask get go hospital anyway. exactly bad reason wear mask. 1,300 cases El Paso TX yesterday... city less 700,000 residents... NRW even sent students school tomorrow without measures. Packed busses classrooms, need open windows regularly (tomorrow gets cold again). start fall/winter. Mass shutdown coming. saw news people must test negative pcr quarantine 14 days upon entry China. National foreigners.

Thats curious shocked new. Either dont apply actually somehow cases manage get thru. really scary means safest way isolate country completly months. Considering one state mask mandates overturned state's court system, power, absolute power idiots overpower common sense country. wittle babies want drinks inside god dammit!!! happy get travel world. really try it.

I did. That's hate China. know well.  mean point unaware ot operates aswell. literally locked 1.5 million person city. lockdown whole states aus. see side, whole island thing really isn‚Äôt big advantage. 3.8 million tourist visited 2019 compared 5 million population that‚Äôs including locals also traveling. pretty similar gdp per capita UK, shows freight traffic compared population size isn‚Äôt proportion still means contact ports. That‚Äôs lot air travel lot cases could come initially. It‚Äôs response times (closing border 100 cases) geography. Freight never stopped though Case point, unemployment actually increasing Florida Georgia U.S. again, spite 2 states among least restrictive. 200 per day Finland. ends case, great. Yikes think leave, problem... want go business contract reason (one exception), think super strong restrictons borders lot people working Vienna... 

You randomly tested borders autogene test maybe good idea work contract someone want validate it. wrong, weigh areas means managing pandemic? 10k infections mean NYC compared location?

What good do? Places getting ravaged right places probably another month. 

Wear mask, avoid crowds. government intervention world anything people follow two pieces advice. exist! joke checked saw comment it‚Äôs low $65 year airmedcare don‚Äôt know legit is. damn 5 million way controle virus. new report Center Disease Control throws sharp light effect Coronavirus Pandemic United comes 2,486,273 Americans died first 40 weeks 2020. point 2019, 2,181,385 people died U.S. -- showing increase 304,888 Jumps big normal. 2018, 2,182,135 people died first 40 weeks -- difference less 1,000 compared following year. Ok, around 60% houses Stockholm single current prevalence one-person households unprecedented historically. highest point recorded chart corresponds Stockholm, 2012, 60% households consist one person.

I'm native speaker understand nuance initial sentence, said households. Thanks :) I'm high risk. work emergency response. fuck supposed stay home? also comparing country 7 times less population US. agree though Asian countries accepted masks culturally many years ... what? 


Some deaths per also question. So. hell could last several months deaths usual year *(that, dare mention, consist months)* record high number deaths? Dude isnt impressive all.

There plenty countries well laud - california done slightly better states like one eyed man kingdom blind. wanted let know downvote agree. sure who's downvoting contains coronavirus‚Äù

Where? countries world? could China ‚Äùcontain‚Äù something spread across world? agree /u/lilith_fae. ""Here's Why"" enticing thing title. 

As mention here, makes think article mention either, I'm less likely give click find out.  Lying again. wrote wrote. retract misinformation spreading stop trying cover arse. wish south east asia used example often. 

Perhaps EXACT emulation responses desirable, way saying densely populated landmasses surrounded countries deal pandemic, nobody else really excuse. sister's kids school (SC), posted days ago already contracted bug. 2 people commented asking sure covid... said thinks normal start school bug school make test.... days later they're eating indoors restaurant üôÑ fucked winter. I‚Äôm talking parties.

Only one party understand basic logic: respiratory viruses travel moisture expelled mouth/nose asymptomatic need PPE social distancing.

The borders matter now, earlier tho. NZ, like US covid inside it, grows uncontrollably **unless take steps control it**. Research on? wasted resources delaying real adoption solutions off-the-shelf available. 

We nearly perfected respiratory protection technology. Ok? works perfectly well. Well, perhaps find way wear Type 3 suit tropical weather pour sweat boots end shift. Wage subsidies extended September, changed name still injecting amount money. many waves. Covid-19 like flu. mutate. Every year need new vacine. Thanks china forever. like biochemical weapon. Trump said intelligence prove realesed China. purpose another question. count immunity. wear mask shops. work wear unproperly. Others wear all. cover nose stinks, lack fresh air glasses covered dew. noone got ilness far. get usual cold. month ago. recovered. dudn't got temperature. Maybe asymptomatic covid, maybe not. I'm Lithuania, Vilnius. early stage cancer I'd rather get COVID know let go undetected 6 months.

It's ok admit lockdowns mistakes. immune.
1) 3 months, antibodies wane subject re-infection. 
2) composition Pence's staff static. time, immune people leave, non-immune people enter. 

These reasons herd immunity possible population long term without vaccine. Thank you, appreciate information.

I hope world learn lessons Russian rollout vaccine, good bad.

Plus hope public understands vaccine available everyone immediately, we're still looking many months/years this. first thought was, ""oof nasty bill"" get masks infringement fUduRrMenkal LiBBatEE's ""no shoes, shirt = service"" around years nobody fazed it. Pretty sure uncontrollable classification means even everyone listened orders, dice.

I show similar news titles, ironic one, mocking urging behaviour, discover 2 weeks later *quite* simple.

Sigh... Yes imagine also going different depending political culture. many communities take seriously, think hoax/overrated, feel like trying control virus much shows lack faith God. Places caring getting Covid considered ""panicking."" completely untrue. rewriting history excuse Sweden‚Äôs poor performance. examples numerous significant differences Sweden nd Nordic neighbours:

&amp;#x200B;

Did Sweden ask everyone arriving riskzone self isolate two weeks since early March? No, not. people symptoms. 

Did Sweden ban large events early March? Also no. 

Did Sweden force entire educational sector distance teach study mid March? Absolutely not. 

Did Sweden force public employees possible could work home since mid March strongly advice private sector same? Nope. came later. 

Did Sweden ask close contacts known cases self isolate? No, contacts symptoms. Though changing degree past month. 

Did Sweden close restaurants, bars, hairdressers, dentists fitness gyms extended period time spring? all. 

Did Sweden hurry getting sufficient test infrastructure running fast possible? No, happened much later political pressure. addition behavioral changes mentioned others, also seems virus stays viable longer cold, humid conditions (which, instance, meat packing plants got hit hard). others getting though? Someone brought home. mean, don‚Äôt know you‚Äôve school recently know people school recently, groups teens ‚Äúgo trans‚Äù ‚Äúgo gay‚Äù ‚Äúgo bi‚Äù ‚Äúgo whatever cool thing think makes unique‚Äù constantly. 

It‚Äôs part growing up. 

Perhaps you‚Äôre older. are, it‚Äôs way groups teens used ‚Äúgo goth‚Äù ‚Äúgo grunge‚Äù whatever decade. 

Because things openly accepted stigma non existent gen z, teens associate natural confusion go ‚Äúbeing trans‚Äù ‚Äúbeing gay‚Äù even though aren‚Äôt, take identity. Blood test tell antibodies. won‚Äôt antibodies yet beginning infection. Yeah. pretty much doomed fail start considering administration. Expecting 300 million people comply pretty sudden serious restriction america stubborn individualist akin leaving kindergartner alone plate cookies expecting choose spinach instead. needed regulation, didn‚Äôt happen. There‚Äôs lot people won‚Äôt make even small sacrifice greater good, unfortunately, we‚Äôre stuck mess there‚Äôs vaccine pandemic ends way. Don‚Äôt jinx man! live CA!! Oh argument? Well, guess northern hemisphere getting cooler, southern hemisphere warming up. virus may well warmer temperatures, thus increase cases? There's like COVID fatigue general apathy well. working/working home choice people. Pump jam! hate accuracy. Angry upvote. obese. may end hospital. young, unlikely suffer much Chris Christie. strange disease people sometimes get better, sometimes start getting worse. Probably doctor also gave recommendations, would point taking Vitamin immediately fairly high counter dose place start.

Well technically indecent exposure. legally wear clothes public. Also, someone else perform anxiety inducing. feels like someone stab brain.  No, latest evidence shows brain swab style test isn‚Äôt necessary. Anterior nares swabs fine. one done official state testing center. tell us nothing people may think testing all. Wait 10,000 people live South Dakota? know. Right? system made impossible Trump force states open makes incredibly difficult Biden close them. 

Even broad mandates require getting someone enforce it.

By time Biden could come in, better hope we‚Äôre turning corner behavior solution. Cancelling order rude customer taking away anyone‚Äôs livelihood. higher risk, take extra precautions.

For 99.99% aren't, go life doesn‚Äôt anything left vs. right. don‚Äôt think anyone could argue 8m+ cases record breaking numbers daily government didn‚Äôt enough slow spread. Yup. We've already sacrificed lot give advantage--we'd lose custody stepkids outside likely recover financially for, like said, full decade. big leap everything move here--if sell right we'd underwater what, stay home kids even here? Education? education? Nobody cared education before. Schools set-up keep kids/teens busy parents go work 10-14 hours day. sounds beautiful pretend saying ""education children important""

Yeah right, 80% people numerical illiteracy, absolutely zero idea exponential growth is. Simplest mathematical concept. Millions know breathe mouth nose, asymptomatic mean uninfected.

Great education, yeah.  lived China, even use words.

China uses provinces, counties townships, even use State

Please assume living China, thank you.

Foetal cells used development treatment, mate; there‚Äôs 2 ways slice it. Rugged Individualism finest get tested month. gnarly early tests. go deep tickles little. problems antibody tests-- hate needles. many people going catch cold get sniffles outdoors several hours late November? depending county (and possibly city) sites. Pima county 65, Maricopa 100. Mostly CVS Walgreens, they've roped bunch urgent care chains even smaller clinics too. need actually enforce proper wearing masks.

My county mask mandate place. Sure, people show store wearing masks, half covering nose, wearing shitty bandanna found back sock drawer, maybe (shout-out sniffling lady let cloth sit nose called day). wore mask properly god knows many shifts, end day, still got COVID brought back roommate (probably) exposed one asshole wanna cover nose five minutes store.

[Here's Bloomberg article referenced Pretty sure looking confrontation, yes, said rephrased. Good talk. Well wall nonsense nothing I'm saying. take virus seriously?

Not seriously sports ""***FREEDOM***"" Sure, is, still allowed tracing people breaking rules, private school, kick shenanigans. people live aren‚Äôt wearing them. Whenever go see people masks. I‚Äôm almost thinking wearing mask problem isn‚Äôt true lol didn‚Äôt score high. Scored medium. Sweden scored low. It‚Äôs survey citizen thinks policies are. buddy worked health inspections.

Even restaurants highest standards violations shut downs happen regularly. beyond stupid.  never really lockdown, yes, rich people getting Amazon delivery part it. always, least around midwest, steady stream business continued going defiance supposed lockdown. first several weeks took rare drives around, felt although 1/2 usual traffic, everywhere went packed shopping plaza packed shopping plaza. banks, mattress stores, restaurants, retail, everything open full customers (no masks time). nuts disheartening quarantine knowing almost waste was. much complete lockdown, much shorter, government support, allowing people, say 1hr grocery shopping every days, would so, much better. I'm going estimate middle December see 80 thousand daily cases mean freedom harm society insisting selfish cunt? can't really answer cause remember war fought reason.  That‚Äôs fair! quickest engagement knew 12 days couple met!  Elderly family members generally live family homes.

In US, vast majority deaths elderly people, nursing group homes lot common.

Infact largest number deaths, especially early weree nursing homes, notably NYC. obviously missing point everyone deserves parent. Right goddamn brick wall misguided effort try save lives front line workers shortage equipment. quickly changed course recommend way back April.

What‚Äôs Trump's excuse still mocking masks October? what's solution protecting vulnerable then? found especially disturbing Stockholm hospitals non-covid patients would badly got covid, like anyone BMI 40. southern states population BMIs 35+! We'd civil war implemented that. think Sweden's policies would work many countries. don‚Äôt know many people *calm down* cocaine, usually take amphetamines ADD/ADHD instead ‚Äì really hard get right dosage blow. worst screwed IV line 2/3x procedure water. like allergic reaction felt like throat closing up. 15 mins gasping air, wife next telling stop eventually getting sponge wet mouth.

Imagine cases per capita 3rd world shithole  looking confrontation reading much things. 

Long term immunity possible. can't tell novel virus year in. U.S. also government sponsored ways get tested. lot CARES act money went states could set testing &amp; presumably states would figure best way work health departments make work. state that's screwing fault state government. think recent debate infected one. Plus, transparency always good thing. first debate, Trump likely positive, normal see ‚ÄúBiden tests negative‚Äù headlines every day. wasn‚Äôt expecting see headline today. We're two weeks behind peak currently infected, give take. another 5 weeks average expect fatalities show up.

We've done nothing, pooch long since fled hills. Funny enough, lived two blocks hospital old place. also appointments prior COVID. saw noticeable difference handling since COVID. added security check asking questions wiping everything including elevator. know staff, go hope leave 30minutes. I'm bit tired stuff. like Ontario - everything fine weather got cold, things went shit fast.

 Let's see things hold month two, recent COVID surges around globe, find increasingly hard attribute success policy things tested weather conditions. 1 7, reporting. got tested first time last week. Really wasnt bad. kinda felt like gonna sneeze couple mins. feel like didnt leave nose long enough twist around long enough lol. long, citizen. long all.

Case point: Reddit moderators arent moms. Karens. We're flattening curve, relative y-axis! Utah makes shit head news again. Sorry, rest country cultish, whack-ass ways. We're mostly bunch inbred dipshits. Interesting know this. pregnant women, women, everyone? It‚Äôs unlikely males since sperm regenerate time right? think empty platitudes like one reasons many people seem think immigration policy based poem statue written foreigner. anyone know details? much close contact he‚Äôs Pence lately, symptoms timeline, severity, etc?

I haven‚Äôt found much else information it. hasn‚Äôt even hit r/news yet agree. thinking, isn‚Äôt opposite news? Faith reliable path truth. reasonable Christian I've met conveniently disregards large Portions bible due barbaric nonsensical is.  That's called tyranny.

Generally America whole like sort thing.

I understand people want demand people pledge alliegence King George American revolution. realize right uncivilized could opt-in though. there‚Äôs problem can't ignored. European countries still kinda stable political economical situation. long run worth lot too. used verb rather adjective.
That issue with. still seen strategy rather result strategy. test positive diementia? also assumes masks ideal condition though. in, sweating cloth masks. touching mask, etc.

The way Biden shakes mask around, hopefully put different one face. using optics, that's alright. look like knows hell he's doing. going work.

Elementary schools going back full time person Fargo tomorrow. ""kids can't get virus."" Stop defending Sweden fucking goon.

Why sre like this? people fucking sick Swedes son brought home school. got sick first, grandma 2 days later. like two years they‚Äôll Heard immunity, that‚Äôs still somehow thing everyone gotten mean... ample evidence Moon made cheese. fact cannot think tells yourself.

For example, low temperature, cheese fragile sustain constant bombardment asteroids would scatter pieces.

And, cheese would evaporate unhindered solar radiation.

Actually, interesting think these. Think little, fun. Coronavirus. haven‚Äôt seen lasting immunity coronavirus encountered safe say won‚Äôt well. vaccine available, however, think would need receive one two jabs per year. High amount asymptomatic carriers mean caught outbreak early stages, that's good sign.

But yeah that's big one. Second big one Xinjiang too. virus win them! gone Easter know UK, superspreaders came Europe (particularly Alps) rather China. could e.g. one case came China Europe, multiple cases fanned there. problem many cases seem asymptomatic means tracking actual journey infection going extremely tricky impossible. Disenginius.. shoot pistol random air, bullet arcs back down, hits someone kills injuries them, responsible that. Even idea there. 

If someone refuses wear mask, spreads COVID-19, even asymptomatic know sick, responsible subsequent infections potential deaths. Morally ethically least.. think law still playing catch this. However, already *knew* sick it, still refused take reasonable precautions prevent spread, also legally responsible happens. established Typhoid Mary. North Carolina still relatively well. They're 39.88 deaths per 100k, compared US per capita average 67.34. ranks North Carolina 34th per capita here's latest case/death charts *parents* told *Friday* they've going church *singing* masks every week. small church 65 yo parents youngest people there. showed story washington chour 100 participents, 30 hospitalized 2 dead aftet single choir practice. rapid growth cases Illinois.

WTF mom dad! cares? death rate? Yes, countries taking care are. One best flight schools country, best, UND Grand Forks. So, don‚Äôt count everyone idiot there. said beginning 80% symptoms. China going win fight rest world slowly paynfully dying fight virus enough... sad rest see really works poor south american countries yeah.

I'm assuming mostly genetic susceptibility combined person's general health ability survive traumatic ordeal, maybe past infections vaccines also. Here's case/death charts Adams county, running 7-day case spike looks bad, deaths moved yet.

Adams county currently 49.48 deaths per 100k, less US per capita average 67.34.

Protip: best ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù cook better food. specialist topic, see reason 

\- Government relaxed measure (at moment curve started rise again, people would expected hardened measure). 

\- School re-opening clearly helps virus, cannot keep school closed 2 years, like 8% kids *skipped online school* Mach-May lockdown year would basically sacrifice 8%, acceptable

\- Belgian weather sucks, september march raining, people back inside appartment/house/bar rather park/garden/street. one friends sick whole group get sicks. theory rule 5 contacts, many people play friendship *battle royale* 

\- Belgium high density population, central location Europe, people related European institution travelling also 1h border, one neighbourghing region infected (like Germany's NRW Northen France) virus stop border 

\- surprised find bigger countries regions bad march, well Belgium size one region many countries Swedes cowards never protests anything.

Nice try tho No. Boomer parents hurt, come on! certainly saved.
Not vast majority back work, least Denmark, much costly society people unemployment support.

Also actually think pays society? fairy godmother? private business private business alone. government generates money own, one giant expense, be. soon need every business contribute much can, can‚Äôt supported. People find something else return. think society without cultural entertainment restaurants good society?

And going engage debate seriousness situation. Comparing WW2 ridiculous.

I don‚Äôt know country reside in, Denmark restrictions worked well every critical point better feared. Please stop defending Sweden. Tiny Hands 2.5 months sabotage Biden‚Äôs plans.  Again, Vietnam stopped spread REACHING 5000 cases. 1200 total.

"" countries succeeded suppressing virus either

1 : ) China. Authoritarian country hardlocks people house keep registry every building block. countries emulate that. US come hardlock someone's house might get shot.

2 : ) Islands quasi-islands (South Korea/Singapore/Japan/Taiwan/New Zealand) either islands akin island secure/closely guarded land border (North Korea).

3 : ) Country controled pandemic reaching 10.000 cases, intense community spread (Thailand/Vietnam).

Other that, hard pressed find one exception."" flies getting tested. Yeah 7 today still lockdown.

What even mean world? wish people die what? know names people fairly publicly known, well close staff like couple WH housekeeping staff. idea example many Chris Christie may passed to. This. could buy alcohol blast music home half fun meantime think experts predicted recently too. also predict half million deaths February things don‚Äôt change. Capitalism? island necessary, sufficient condition.

All chicken 2 legs mean everybody 2 legs chicken. Here's latest charts Arkansas, running 7-day currently 59.12 deaths per 100k population rising fast. They're ranked 20th per capita Gj poor countries South America went past death count.

Sweden still fucking disaster brainwashed goon. quote, may contact moderators. lung exercises? Why? seem buried behind paywall North Dakotan here. Indoor dining changed ""reduced capacity"". far could tell real guidelines done. restaurants mostly blocked half 75% floorspace shoved everyone corner. went restaurants summer section restaurant sitting would crowded always. Staff use masks 30-50%, noses hanging mask pulled talk got table.

I see videos friends bars weekend ND. bar packed way around tables elsewhere full. think rural bars.

People still think virus myth. know downvoted, coronavirus ultimate litmus test, idiots always die first. Thanks saying this! sub become Biden circle jerk? least third time I've seen article top sub Biden testing negative. extension r/politics Winter bring 100k/d ‚Äî also known ""Fauci's Nightmare"". risk downvote, know isn‚Äôt constituency wants? Looks like pharmaceuticals needed machinery vehicles pandemic. 

A look [government also shows this: 
Sweden debt: 1.10tn SEK 1.21tn = 10% increase 
Denmark debt: 614bn DKK 823bn = 34% increase

If Danish government would increase debt more, economy would fare even better.

Not economy factor FoHM strategy. Winter coming. likely combination complacency cooler weather (people congregated outdoors indoors causing easier transmission).   Shouldn‚Äôt year savings?

Maybe learn code... really? still question? dumb people be? check what's goinig coutries infected you. check europe, shit controle even germany pretty good beginning lost everything done before. way better job guys wave tsunami you. 

take care follow rules wanna save others lifes believe president says. look worked countries follow rules. reason cases lower.

god bless americans god bless really hate her, guess... elaborate, Vietnam never 5000 cases.

It's one thing stop virus beginning, another suppress thousands cases everyday spread everywhere. need freak know keep safe. u stupid misleading way describe Swedish nursing home situation. smart, argumentation sophisticated, kind argument. said patently, verifiably true. point Peru particularly telling, dark moment winter everyone finds masks necessary sufficient. Yeah, that's idea yet collected fifth worst coronavirus death rate Europe. It‚Äôs still 3% population that‚Äôs it. virus mutate faster get herd immunity. Herd immunity doesn‚Äôt work they‚Äôre worst East Asia literally watched people (here Spain) greet people bar elbow bump, take masks off, hug cheek kiss France also small country population size lot people live large apartment complexes everyone touch door get top due high costs rent share apartments people. Sweden moved Gymnasium remote learning. That's people aged 16-19. term ""secondary school"" English usually means ages 12-18. thinking same. interesting see outcome is. someone still get covid even use 1 kn95 masks Layered surgical masks (two masks used) face shield?
I friend needs shop lot mall. 3 times week. job. 
Its pretty hard social distancing condition. 

She infected around september. used 2 cloth masks still got infected. i‚Äôm thinking uses kn95 layered surgical masks use face shield. protect more
Or way job get infected again?? Deaths (which op referring to) fairly flat last month. probably statistics really ""this many cases Sunday"" ""within reporting window last 24 hours...etc""

but yea, imagine utopia kind global coordination properly report manage information could actually compare across arbitrary boundaries thing spreading? FFS...So how's vaccine coming? think deep care. different American nonchalance ""muh freedumbs"" instead ""r freedumbs"". bulk society keeps liberty seen insignificant sacrifice majority population. Yeah Trump saying we‚Äôre rounding corner. Friday saw highest number new cases entire pandemic. late October. flu season. time prevent deaths. I'm saying vaccine coming, Jan-Mar next year need 3 months suppressing virus get instead giving running record cases, hospitals already becoming overcrowded.

I mean, CNN breaking story, interviewed Meadows, they're god-damned primary source. Come on.  number deaths see today got infected least 10 14 days ago. Two weeks ago, 8000 infections per day. think happen two weeks now... get sick Idaho, may go Seattle hospitalization. 600 miles. imagine taking 600 mile trip sick? That's pretty scary. think even international approval there's going problem radical leftists refusing get vaccinated. I've seeing often age cohort. There's idea can't trust vaccine capitalist governments pharma companies care safety want money dumb hippie bullshit. younger people going ger vaccinated there'll significant campaign challenge kind extremism since popular college students right-wing ""globalists putting microchips vaccines"" conspiracies. Upgrade ventilation schools, acknowledging covid airborne, instead spending months worse nothing pretending covid touch hazard.

Once kids inevitably exposed schools, what's plan quarantine period possible illness besides get whole family sick? spread further?

How actually fine people flout mask mandates? We've done Jack shit given we've known, we've known it, reasonably ought done. 

The fact people think we've done lot part problem, we've half assed easy things like masks done 0 hard things hoping goes away.

Theres Lancet published study talking SARS-CoV-2 variant 382-nucleotide deletion ORF8 region, made less severe.

edit: link:  I'd go mate. live north (not major city tho) people wear masks yeah, major cities (aka virus everywhere) need lockdown yesterday morality rate 0.5% 60

It significantly lower younger age groups.

You talk many scenarios want said dramatic effect fear.

There's reason everyone trying make big deal ""cases"" college despite hospitalizations deaths. Fear paranoia.

Despite one lowest risk groups.

If grandma, take extra precautions.

If young person, take reasonable precautions go life. Hospitals sometimes police parked outside credible threat made. üòî(North Texas) Yeah, he's cool guy, first store wear masks months ago. listens another co-worker ""yeah well heard doctors saying virus real."" Sort thing sometimes. Locked poetic license. Going meet people taking proper precautions and/or may infected better.

Yes, responsible people go bars restaurants. irresponsible people problem. can't let people make choice without consequences consequences others death.

EDIT: worrying, evidence emerged many sick elderly patients effectively automatically denied access treatment, avoid hospitals overwhelmed. One March 17 FHM directive Stockholm hospitals stated patients 80 body mass index 40 admitted intensive care, less likely recover. reports describe sick care home residents administered palliative cocktail morphine midazolam, homes equipped administer oxygen, something doctors described ‚Äòactive euthanasia.‚Äô infected big deal. body organs forever damaged people even get brain damage. lungs damaged well.   yet friends keep telling go bars them. Everywhere go people wear masks(I‚Äôm Florida too) exception would outdoors. stay distance. 3 restaurants I‚Äôve everyone spread usually quarter capacity. guess really depends area FL you‚Äôre at. Can't seem find source, link another comment? Look El Paso... Nah, immunity depends antibodies (which shown go away while). chronic conditions come effects virus body.

As example, strep throat bacteria end spreading body treated correctly quickly. eventually cause damage heart joints, leading arthritis heart problems. could recover initial infection, still arthritis heart problems. great corner wouldn‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs round.  Absolutely. I've gotten sense people kinda feel like ""over"", seeing people without masks public places lately. Curfew city. neighbors friends round 8.55pm 6.05am. french tradition skirting round rules problem authority going kill many people. They're still right though. Denmark tests way Sweden, anyway. Sweden always infectious neighbours save weeks start September. literal fuck ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è end coming week would assume  testing. stopped testing, cases would go down! time record low flu cases time year! Doubt it‚Äôs correlated... Another idiot thinks world ends Washington DC #FreeShkreli East coast getting 50s, maybe 40s night. Yeah, get called fearmonger receive abusive PMs posting state level stats, even automatically downvoted one. tourists. Look recent pics Salem. anyone reading planning trip Halloween, please come. want here. Yes arguing virus spreading I'm one civil?k goggles! 100% reasonable place government society somewhat works people them. work got $1200 live months months. keep feeling like idiot seeing parents showing newborn. time, I'm happy knowing I'm going one stories whole family infected party. Yeah, think that. Here‚Äôs even scarier one, officials setting coronavirus policies long short labors, shorter way better. I'd rather extreme pain 30 minutes extreme pain hours/days.  Record HERD IMMUNITY confirmation!! border get closed spring? Uk resident here, unfortunately, father one friends believes too. British, US elections zero relevance us. (Maybe zero, get sentiments) Regard le graph: flat despite cases rising. Hello friend! still hope one day world 'Leavers' planet again. Perfect.  faster gets population better. Heck many people know - almost none even symptoms. Need get past ASAP  timing mass Thanksgiving exposure going lead wave dead grandparents right around Christmas Day. immediate family staying home year traveling. parents pissed I'm going fly 2500 miles bring deadly virus picked airport.  things certainly issues depending country, Luxembourg offered good support. would paid full salary duration illness. Healthcare free. Also every job two months notice period full salary make sense fire someone sick week two, particularly something they're definitely faking

 Still, even 50% participation rate tried test population. Many people Fauci completely right said 100k coming back July. Holy shit, almost 90k...

All huge segment population want stay inside weeks wear masks go out. real. hours told schedule induction, ""there's way he's coming out. He's chilling like villain."" 

Well, plans lol. born fast enough beat doctors there. slowed since. ""If count countries barely function, U.S. great! mean long arent looking maternity deaths wealth disparity, quality health care dont compare us wealthy countries we're top third!"" Well least worry 2021 anymore. New England we've well, people taking seriously fall soooooo many tourists think special come visit loooove Halloween. I'm pissed. fact increasing, gotten better preventing people hospitalized dying - progress end, regression everywhere else miracle like suddenly nowhere covid goes home. miracle would probably visible effect series measures taken before. effective, would starting show now... far nothing.  Upvoted replied guy used bigger word don‚Äôt understand. /r/ubhrttogauabwtidu feel like I‚Äôm cafe eavesdropping two, I‚Äôm enjoying conversation actually think vaccine definitive date renew peoples dedication mitigation efforts. lot easier something hard know end starts. No, they're not. removed entire chain uncivil toward other. Testing whole also compared spike July. Think testing ""enhancing"" ""resolution"" issue. less clarity situation July yet still cases now. Please wear mask, use curbside pickup possible even though restaurants open, try get takeout dine patio area. small inconveniences help save lives. Crazy, US couple weeks behind Europe's explosion. wonder quickly accept usa 100k cases daily norm even low number... Well, unfortunately cure stupid. Protogenesis win! also know internationally people looking Oxford I‚Äôve never felt priority US.

US invested Oxford's actually Yeah that‚Äôs point - left Denmark since didn‚Äôt support argument. Yes,I read yesterday,pretty scary folks realize really going world,and stop taking things granted!

My hospital approximately 15mins away,I work special needs children every day work fear stressful conditions, absolutely fun whatsoever work day. sad. Ok little bit hyperobolic still given proof big claims, shows making up. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof provided none. say ""it strongly recommended"" making gradation recommendations giving. one important less important then? mean ignore less important one follow higher priority one? Cause that's rationalization goes person's brain start making ranking.

All daily (at time daily) briefings repeating part - situation extremely serious, situation health care extremely intensive everyone must take responsibility part lowering curve curbing infection levels. elderly ill person's decision make without excluded care discharged bottle pain pills?

Previous results guarantee future performance case performance appears lacking. metrics many people visiting Time square? comments extremely civil. Yay got kind sketchy measuring healthcare workers patients... people constantly exposed virus ... 7 months seems completely arbitrary go period time without exposed...

This suggest antibodies detected regular population much less time Yup, lot neighbors seem 3 generations living household. also know huge amount families nannies housekeepers. I'm sure help exposure. Monday lowest, Sunday second low put federal no-fly list. America top usual. Gonna shit show holidays cold weather coming up. We‚Äôve gotten better keeping mortality rate little, bu hospitals overwhelmed lot places holidays. anecdotal accounts better your... complete lack statistical anecdotal evidence whatsoever.

The numbers consistent similarly cultured countries. people China going lives entirely normally, basically pre-COVID behavior.

Entire cities shut everyone tested even minuscule cases detected.

No reasonable person believe China secretly harboring substantially higher case load they‚Äôre stating. isn‚Äôt consistent know region Chinese people government behaving. really talking monotheistic idealism. Let say glad placing trust Yahweh, whichever dichotomy deity believe in. world black white. Sweden level Denmark weekly cases know. mean Third Stage First Wave.  need worry reinfection now. antibodies months, even then, evidence far pointing reinfection relatively rare. countries island eyes virus borders closed. said PEOPLE WILLINGLY RIGHT THING
Some people stupid realize island stupidity (not wearing mask ignoring social distance suggestions)
effects people.
I give shit autonomy, free illusion. think bigger problem people gatherings family friends home nobody masks. baby start finish 30 minutes

Speed run strats. observational study done (not strongest evidence, probably best possible) showed weather accounts 7% variations infections.

I think confirmed infections hot dry states like AZ. People took seriously enough August fucked us over.

 Government absolutely want keep economy going want go another lockdown. Also working home enforced possible, working place still making us come 2-3 days week. Best comment I've read while. Yeah. that's Kim Jong Jacinda enacted tyrannical lockdowns literally 4 people positive. 

Whose economy hurt most? Theirs.

Think economy. people die economy gets worse. lot die China virus. say wrong? frustrating rationalize, it? understand people seem think us everything properly LIKE happening? literally want die cause others die. hard understand? europe seeing massive cases deaths surge kept deaths cases pretty low

This simply untrue. Sweden 5th-worst hit europe, spiking right like everywhere else. France though Shutting social safety net great idea.

America failed state provide aid. Everyone own. federally mandated shutdown, many starve die.

I‚Äôm saying shouldn‚Äôt - that‚Äôs complicated question. serious drawbacks lockdowns Ignorant here, restrictions France currently has? Thx Imagine stupid much giant asshole vote back in. isn't, Germany far smaller population. number beds have...

You're really stretching here. wondering Florida's numbers looked low. Granted, significant number people get infected traveling states get counted FL stats. Cases severely under-reported though, growing basically without control. it‚Äôs much unlikely month get 1 million cases day. Yes that‚Äôs happens wasn‚Äôt federal mandate  Please ever reproduce, insufferable idiot. It‚Äôs like onion headline real! WTF!!! Idiots live everywhere, worst outbreak earth happens ND. News in, NOBODY responsible keeping healthy YOU.
Otherwise companies able sell cigarettes, alcohol, sugar, fast food would banned, public car ownership would outlawed able buy kitchen knives without background checks.

In fact, banning cigarettes alcohol sugar would save hundreds thousands lives every year billions healthcare costs. nearly zero corona deaths months

Most Europe almost deaths summer. Sweden spiking like rest them. yet hope never come that. doubt legal frame that.

But doesnt matter anticovid activists call ""hard lockdown police military forces involved""... Wow,your right map sad look at. Havin one way conversations darkness mind, talkin cuz I‚Äôm quiet kind agree. hand.

That said, war science education country going back Vietnam, minimum. undereducated American populace purpose, make easier control. conspiracy theory, fact. seek information knowledge outside school, obtain higher education, mule going whipped.

That mule votes told to, want get whipped again. rounding corner. keep rounding corner come full circle.  Whether talking hummus hot sauce, I'll assume hot sauce plug awesome fermenting things is. 

Get air lock main jar lids, worth instead burping jars. weights sauerkraut pounder (Also called champer something?)

My fucking sauerkraut INSANE, much like sauerkraut making myself. (Protip: cabbage, carrot, green onion, apple, caraway seed, mustard seed, keep chunky, could serve shit rice incredible) 

And fermented hot sauce whole world bruh. always make mild one, sometimes grilling first, always adding carrot, stuff. 

Anyone wanting lighthearted intro fermentation check Alive, show YouTube Bon Appetit network (owned Conde Nast going drama nevermind that) link math gets 23k, appreciate it! favorite argument make wasteful spending I've using 15k make point. look up, sweat it, I'm probably going anyway. Spiking cases, hospitalizations deaths college age individuals extremely low risk. really stop that. Make mandatory testing condition school attendance, problem solved quickly expand testing rates. im 8/11  France schools re-open May increase cases reported. Oh. talking sat hands late due wrongheaded belief fighting virus keeping economy afloat either/or choice. That's incompetence mate. Sure won‚Äôt look manly /s ridiculous concept, ask age transmission become kid adult? virus hidden capability determine host age transmit adults visa versa, illogical hurts. disagree people take seriously definitely culture thing. Americans like told do. love minimum wage employees think know happening.

It reminds everyone opinions. article:


‚ÄúWhy rural surge?

Ehresmann suggested could stem fewer people sparsely populated areas wearing masks, maintaining physical distance following public health guidelines slow spread.

Other health experts suggest rural Minnesotans influenced example neighboring states public health responses, mask mandates, haven‚Äôt aggressive. there‚Äôs possibility people border communities, La Crescent, could become infected travel Wisconsin North South Dakota.‚Äù New Zealand one places Earth consistently helps restore faith humanity. No. saying take basic precautions, surprising get sick. Yeah pretty stoked see Keloland pushing back. main ancher even started latest mask piece sigh conveyed feeling ""God, can't believe tell people shit - basically seatbelts 2.0 last get line back too"". crazy even issue. nations put nationwide mask mandate place half year ago least months ago, people it. need worry getting police enforce it. Remember though once-and-done kind things. don‚Äôt sustain consistent contact tracing, border control, measures, situation still get hand quickly many European countries see now, effort goes waste  still contract die? happen trump American? odd monolithic way looking things. Swedish people aren‚Äôt less pacifistic nationality. name nationality prone conflict? Since one gave straight answer legit question - abstract study. Almost reputable studies list thier method selection criteria part it.

Methods: conducted retrospective, observational study patients showing neurological psychiatric symptoms context Covid-19 seen Department Neurology Psychiatry APHP-Sorbonne University. yet people still go maskless want get hate/be put spot really want know message Here‚Äôs link source study also anti farting anti gay laws? Like said before, we're scared anymore, absolutely exhausted now. realize engineering brought water drink, roads drive on, medical devices used hospitals....you either missed point entirely purposefully obtuse. Laws effective, followed correctly. 

Are murderers?

Are rapists?

Are robbers?

Yes? they're effective. might well away entirely then, right? following logic here. what? Wanting guinea pig? There's way going go know long term side effects vaccine deploy it. Wow. see happening nothing keep virus spreading. mention kids getting sick. 

Do take virus seriously? patients airlifted voluntary decision made patients done limited basis, needed, 20 patients airlifted 24-hour state Texas sending three four fully functional tents staff equipment help Covid response. Yea you‚Äôre right dude, COVID hasn‚Äôt killed anyone! young healthy people like don‚Äôt unknowingly spread vulnerable people ever!! safe sound. Silly worried health safety pandemic :))) I‚Äôm sure mostly elderly population serve strong enough fight off! anyways, cares aren‚Äôt!! :))))) Probably yeah. It‚Äôs anxiety thing really, mental health pretty lately. I‚Äôve eating bunch since like May/June, it‚Äôs always outside. understand indoor dining still pretty risky even distancing given airborne transmission thought work, don‚Äôt know degree ‚Äúrisky‚Äù scenario. There's universal evidence effects poorest societies, yank otherwise, we're dealing issue Britain, plus rich make accusation president holds public rallies (I've looked spaced wearing masks) remembers chimera molecules specific drug caused pregnancy disasters like people born without arms legs? Thalidomide?  spreading ""uncontrollable"".  spreading controlled. 

The problem is, measurements depend recent control actions. measurements depend control actions (or lack them) taken number weeks ago.  time delay.

If rest country started wearing masks careful social distancing, whole country would largely controlled thanksgiving. No. ""Those fearful stay home"" bullshit excuse. say hear ""but WANT care people!"" Actually Sweden low public support gov policies still public mask mandates start protect employees forced interact people whether want not. Plus protect can't afford pay everything delievered elderly high risk must buy groceries, get gas go Dr etc.

also private events 100+ people going way grocery stores will. Imagine many people sick clerk infect vs birthday party. used enforce untill one employees physically assaulted (she punched face) another threatened gun verbal assaults common. enforcement period. come without mask employees allowed say anything it. lives important mask mandate. government wants enforcement need send police stand guard buisness hours think value lives friends, family countrymen right put something face ""...etc (edit: plus effective January 20th Republicans start caring numbers pretending going magically disappear one day....even completely blame Biden enough past year turning around first week). ""

You really think that's what's going happen? idea deserve votes. speak medical research, added life isn‚Äôt boiled that. Sad times... People want make money. Taking action stop COVID would prevent making money. Admitting COVID even problem prevent making money.

In case masks, believe mostly re-election finding ""enemy"" potential voters rally against, money. would second agenda.

Ultimately though hunch comes back climate change impending economic devastation looming us. admit science useful things say COVID opens door take lives stop making money next decade three. Agreed. prefer ""mayhaps"" Heh, lot ex-Mormons happy Starbucks first time :)  spreading ‚Äòuncontrollably‚Äô much U.S.

This hoax convinces lot people get sick.

EDIT: would appear well sarcasm. south rise again. Wait... facts. care feelings. also say makes highly effective.

If worn correctly. 

Do adjust mask? 

Do touch face? 

Do wear face shield glasses everywhere? 

No? they're effective. Health even second, paying medical bills you. end long term organ damage they'll end extra products sold. know what‚Äôs stupid sub? Obvious idiotic comments like can‚Äôt get called otherwise mods automod nuke comment also change breeze. It‚Äôs self-appointed/freelance thing almost like shitty people need forced right thing.

Are talking people shot resisting arrest police another group?  Haha fair, least guys never made attempts, got false hope...

Canada half measures, none follow through. feel like time, things don‚Äôt rapidly change, could similar situation guys. shitty thing child Somebody paid bad mask policy? Whitehouse also wrapped small study recently showed hydroxy prevent infection. really think you‚Äôre overreacting, there‚Äôs nothing wrong enjoying time long follow rules. Especially struggle mental health always tell ex-mormon still always-busy work ethic 35 bragging drinking beer. living state absolutely miserable. people dumb read primary activity kidding young reactionaries seem do? absolutely wore masks public pandemic sick, smh. flu beginning 2020 anyone even really talking COVID, ended hospital bad, followed advice wear mask anytime house contagious. nothing benefit me, didn‚Äôt want anyone else get sick. It‚Äôs 100% protecting people, including yes, zero effect wear one big effect everyone around don‚Äôt. kind attitude people think like masks, isn‚Äôt control yet. said you‚Äôre angry people intrude life, yet don‚Äôt understand angry someone comes place work at, yells coworkers trying job enforce city stores posted rules, goes way put people risk high risk time. Self preservation coexist empathy people. anyways, I‚Äôm far less worried health, since I‚Äôm young mostly healthy, concerned people life risk asthma, diabetes, old age that. yes avoiding high density areas, haven‚Äôt?? $$$ Turn fucking dust happen. It‚Äôs easy don‚Äôt resources, manpower, economy so. China‚Äôs large population one-party authoritarian regime means essentially cut rest world implement drastic measures without severe economic political repercussions. Uhhhh sir...it‚Äôs pandemic....  ~~Years come~~ forever   /u/slyweazal Hi Think news bit old. infections rates jumping significantly medical advice changing advising caution. Stay home, work for, home avoid public transports etc. it‚Äôs really different. difference let huge number people beginning. never change. European Union higher cases per capita US sad. Also let‚Äôs forget euros fat fuck well. bet you‚Äôre obese. excellent reason vote early. Im dumb af says 250k google metropolitan area huge neat. Hello US. Hope y'all staying safe :)  Fuck off, creep. understand anger...I wanted fly home see elderly parents winter looks unlikely now. hate leadership without hating country. still love USA hoping (and voting) brighter future. sure people move Singapore China think liberty freedom problem.

Oh wait maybe they're hypocrites like freedom sometimes others. It‚Äôs almost like can‚Äôt control something like virus instead need try best protect vulnerable fight way toughest parts. Get done quick possible. 

But instead let fizzle around society, cycling lockdowns opens... You‚Äôre idiot Thank much reply, really appreciate it! Would support idea recording standard in-person classes automatically uploaded kids want access outside school? Considering they're less accurate blindly taking constant deaths 2 weeks period, I'd say that's awful job. (same source before, need check data) What's person's name? Smug opposing authoritatian decisions?

That's called smug buddy... counted, corrected, know they're now. Over/under 90,000 Monday hand people start boycotting places like Starbucks, might better overall public health. Oh really don‚Äôt worry much churches finding common ground them. Bethel rebuked, disclaimed, openly mocked orthodox Christians stripes years now. grave soaking, glitter vents ‚Äúfrom Holy Spirit‚Äù, Christian tarot cards, kenoticism, arianism, terrible thing tried raise baby dead two weeks... they‚Äôre mess. even megachurch much flat cult. must young, lol. Awesome subreddit. Thanks helping find it. don‚Äôt every one coworkers, families, customers, families health history, one knows real risk involved people get sick ignorant individuals care take precautions. manager baby weeks ago, husband sister work me, sincerely hope nothing brought home newborn mom. coworkers parents young, people know someone close asthma, diabetes, health issue puts higher risk. don‚Äôt percentage risk whatever ‚Äòproof‚Äô you‚Äôre looking for, doesn‚Äôt mean safe smart. Arizona 890 new cases reported *just today*. 6000 people died state this. People disposable me, far many deaths already, number could hell lot lower people didn‚Äôt fight masks damn hard. It‚Äôs sad think $100 isn‚Äôt worth going beyond lady runs massive corporate events doesn‚Äôt wear masks them?? (Her words, mine) get paid hours put every day, catering order. again, worth putting people risk little money. thriving local bakery three locations, drop bucket. people happy comply, turning away people necessary.

Hell I'm American; look like I'm shooting school you?  wish lucky whole life ahead :( kid's school comfortable sending school (private school, maybe different rules). love kiddo, loved home, trying get house. take temp soon gets car morning kid fever allowed campus. send negative COVID test month starting November going entire school year (we got back school, would first month). messing around taking seriously. wish schools same. know many Orange County, CA moms thing. may come case, currently social distancing etc. getting tested Monday. legal penalty wearing mask

Which need mandate. know countries passing Swedens deaths per million right? think that's part it, also think unwise ignore fact we've also applied higher degree rigor previous vaccines. u know sometimes people car crashes still die even though seatbelt on, still good idea wear seatbelt?

if u wrap ur head around that, im sure u figure answer ur question cached image link shows Oregon ‚ÄúCaution Warranted‚Äù live site shows us ‚ÄúTrending Poorly‚Äù üò≠ Agreed!

The desire make money cost long-term security is, itself, extreme incompetence.  local Pharmacy's free are? Poe‚Äôs Law strikes federal funding police rescinded enforce mask wearing, I'm sure mandate would help. I'm sure there's departments special ways raise funds would ignore mandate, many would hate money upgrades overtime. Imagine grease coming pores right now. Keep seething. USA 3rd world shithole lol people say truth. collective governments sacrificed health many people tourism dollars. try enforce illegal entry people scream bloody murder. Vaccines slow develop politics. one wants invest billions dollars disease widespread transmission severe symptoms people. testing entire nation, contact tracing much easier. need face random pop cases nowhere. Went trunk treat kids, almost one wearing mask. crazy. joking think fine imposed small stent jail time say 3 days week offender keeps offending time fines increase Sorry kind idiot. nothing less customers boycotting. violence toward staff. We've physical assaults employees, verbal assaults common even gun flashed protest wearing mask. Clerks mask police comes shoulders enforce it. Low level employees (Csr's managers) lives put danger mask mandates. worried volunteere time local store enforcing mask mandates. wont last four hours. think came month two this, it? Anyway, disagree less initially thought, feel like arguing it. Lets say lockdown reduces peoples life quality 5%. 

5% life quality lost x 330 million Americans x 6 months (so far) = 8 million years life lost 

Now compare life years lost COVID deaths

230,000 deaths x 10 years lost per death = 2.3 million life years lost COVID deaths.

You adjust numbers desired redo math. still show thing. cure worse disease. 

Last years life valuable valuable. COVID deaths old unhealthy people whose quality life already far perfect.

Now back 5% number quality life lost. debatable. guy likes working home playing video games may loss quality life. Kids pulled friends, education activities suffering massive loss life quality. don‚Äôt get second chance senior year high school.

You think asshole caring COVID deaths. think opposite. think others assholes forcing cure worse disease. limited time earth. Wear mask, limit exposure, wash hands, hiding basements waste. 42 million sounds like big number, realize less 1% population world.

If virus continues spreading according ""logistic"" function, still lot spreading left do. notion ""herd immunity"", needs discarded, costs millions lives. **Oct. 25, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

At moment less 100 active cases, they're well, rest states essentially back normal! We're even organising travel bubbles states even new zealand, makes sad countries refuse follow rules though :/  paramedic worked said hospitals full, transferring patients Tucson, Phoenix Albuquerque, 3-6 hrs away.

Even cotton mask reduces chances getting virus. high concentration environment like COVID ward need N95, low concentration environment cotton mask still helps.

Here ramping several months thing. exhausting waiting. piss though? Right, masks alone solve problem, they're *major* proponent solution well social distancing, proper ventilation, personal hygiene.

You could say seat belts alone save lives car accidents, also crumple zones, airbags, anti-lock brakes, etc., important factor.

This also article May conservation masks use health care settings important due shortages. mention article specifically concerning healthcare workers, average person much less significant exposure passing also adhere social distancing, cases masks alone *will* make much greater difference.

Are intentionally obtuse what? Stop nitpicking wear damn mask. there's handful choices. hopefully least one first generation vaccine works. presumably second generation ones work better Hmmm....

And yes, global pandemic I‚Äôm government telling country minimize spread inspect deaths pandemic causing virus.

Unfortunately wrong. go walk family day. high impact. probably burn less 100 calories it. eat healthy, eaten healthy habit 10 years. lost baby weight. lose weight requires calorie deficit, put work meeting. maintain weight. entirely possible.

Just look Japan Germany counterexamples ""easy"" individuals make choice fewer children later life keep resources themselves, okay?

This forced choice economic circumstances thrust upon people government. hardly free choice. good thing aging first world kind market, human lives worth used be

Never thought I'd hear r/coronavirus ""one death many"". guess human lives worth huh? Great numbers, best numbers. USA!

US\*cough\*A!

U...\*cough\*cough\* yet Utah keeps reporting barely deaths. 

Makes wonder reliability numbers. Calling 3rd wave kind misleading, outbreak single wave hitting different parts US different times.

T cells produce sterilizing immunity. still get infected, immune purposes herd immunity. 40-50% people asymptomatic. That's additional 40k we're definitely 100k. many people symptomatic getting tested? another 10k? going win. We‚Äôre going win much...We‚Äôre going win much, **you‚Äôre going sick** tired winning, you‚Äôre going come go ‚ÄòPlease, please, can‚Äôt win anymore.‚Äô You‚Äôve heard one. You‚Äôll say ‚ÄòPlease, Mr. President, beg sir, don‚Äôt want win anymore. It‚Äôs much. It‚Äôs fair everybody else.‚Äô

Trump right said 2016.  We're tired sick. Also lastly, mutated animal so, opinion? Money Swedens case, oppurtunity kill costly old people. Without Fed support people unable work lock down, simply can‚Äôt one US: state afford without Fed help cavalry‚Äôs coming.

We‚Äôre own. Follow public health guidelines. keep hospitals getting swamped. Wait vaccine. best Melbourne friend, thank good right thing there. Respect. managed tarnish good name internationally.

The world finally sees Sweden Danish eyes. People say things without data back live Fargo, I‚Äôm willing bet huge factor culture around drinking here. Think read ND #1 alcohol consumption, there. many social gatherings pre-covid. Also still activities outside getting belligerent high-functioning alchohlics‚Äîie majority population. pretty line initial shutdown, everyone went bananas reopened, sign slowing whatsoever. Even smart ones stopped taking precautions social life, making half-assed effort masks work/errands. I‚Äôm fairly optimistic guy, looks like things already hopeless. ‚Äòrecent‚Äô mean April May... actually 3rd look graphs.

The US never really reduced like everywhere else brought social distancing. reduced initially phase one, climbed again, reduced bit, rollercoaster ride continues! provided source

anyone knows anythong ICU beda knows tbey kept 80% capacity, meaning easily overwhelmed. 
This means given Swish hospital might 10 beds away ""overwhelmed""

However valid criticism Fauci spreading falsehood is, actually saying end ""never practice strategic rationing."" actually really unethical, would introduce bias people existing disproportionate risks. goal medical science harm reduction, goal science general mitigate remove biases, completely unreasonable expect ""first come first serve"" approach rationing PPE pandemic, times, instead allocating people need most. could straight tried criminal negligence attempting ration harm-reducing supplies time crisis.

And play devil's advocate, rationing strategy was, start june, based analysis of, mostly, previous influenzas masks primarily useful frontline workers, reasonable extrapolation since covid yet known airborne. Further, read first sentence link (the discussion section, link kinda broken), reason less state things June 01, paper published. links except twitter one posted June. twitter one interview 10 days paper published. almost like sort event led informed decision made later date.

Also read USAToday article closely, bordering edge lying said. clearly advocates mask usage, surprising advocate mass blanket usage healthy people A) shortage B) evidence would effective previous influenzas, which, again, data based on. Youre fucking lunatic dude. post hour early earlier ever day. way never time. birthday Thanksgiving year!! Unfortunately big dinner year household maybe cake! China government asks something it. Everyone‚Äôs seen happens people defy government. ones getting optimistic therefore complacent getting right ass. 

I dont like this, getting colder out...  one said everyone going die severe effects, permanent, it. die. I'm really jaded use word ""strong."" It‚Äôs 12 alarm fire burning control can‚Äôt help watch much done put out. It‚Äôs sad virus seems spiking many places now. President said great! I‚Äôm betting even something right now, Pfizer executives would still delay releasing election undermine validity vaccine results confirm. Heard friend producing vaccine since months release anytime now. Hope right hope safe Good thing children immune. neighbors Halloween party yesterday. outdoor party, still party. 

The COVID virus die fast colder fall winter weather opposed heat humidity summer. really lot transmission October way next summer. holidays get togethers full asymptomatic kids giving COVID others. words, can't tell I'm wrong. lockdown earlier longer get better economy.

That's exactly do.

You lock hard, early, order stamp virus fully open without restrictions.

We performed half-assed lockdown prolonged virus. people still afraid virus, going use purchase goods service, causing massive unemployment. 

Not mention refusal mandate mask wearing decrease democrats blame economy.

Of course are. claimed made successful economy world history. gets worst unemployment rate since great depression.

His wild incompetence handling entirely him. democrats would done matter that's make-believe hypothetical. reality Trump fucked supporters need that. What‚Äôs ‚Äúcontact tracing‚Äù? /cries European think young people care boomers people age (late 30s). Lets get pandemic, people, get this. though slow counts affects deaths Cases Sunday Gotta love put disclaimer end, risk voted hell lol. 

Dissenting opinions welcome here. Zero COVID strategy works. Well done Victoria. Seems strange ""Spikes"" happening made aware recently election approaches. lol No, referring anecdotes handfull people bbc found article. find couple people saying opposite, actually send sick person hospital, right then?

There still policy let people die. obvious answers lack knowledge elderly care well insight Sweden nursing home situation. 

There relevant criticism regards elderly care Sweden worked pandemic. currently investigated. fail comprehend random googling third hand sources. lot vaccines already produced ready high risk groups upon approval. First wave third spike. I'd define wave clear start end. Best we've gotten 50% spike another one starts. much winning went away Trump even need anything! He's incredible. ^^^^/s ^^^^ofc Im one words, rhymes Room.....and canceled. Big thanks interstaters actually supported Victoria day one - guys rock! Taiwan also constantly export cases despite claiming zero, aka Taiwan lying.

So let's meet half way, Taiwan China communist. cite DPRK literally clue reality ground there?

We know ultra deadly mutant SARS-CoV-2 killed 2/3 population would know Kim Jong Un single handedly developed distributed perfect vaccine everyone perfectly safe healthy. Yeah think Trump thrown towel now, imagine loses. brother works lab tests. told bosses get 75‚Ç¨ per test(everything included). √éle de France, France. yeah, they're making bank. sure lot *Sunday*. months old barely use since leave house often Remember people said masks anything March? Pepperidge farms remember. People selfish. think they‚Äôd spread even know fact it. Look STDs. That‚Äôs universal mask mandate useful buffer arse holes. I'm currently relying lady win bread. know that's bad thing. It‚Äôs free. go doctor pay it‚Äôs 100% reimbursed. labs don‚Äôt ask anything upfront. didn‚Äôt close restaurants üòÇüòÇ that‚Äôs one town. Literally one. Town, even county state. dying. Like honor, reaching. Mask not, pretty dumb go indoor activities. Cruises always stupid, even without covid. wonder what's point? talking lockdown Europe. Things Australia pretty damn good still people too. They‚Äôre everywhere think ""The western world basically given up""?????

We Canada given up, ever. uptick lately, getting control again. country-wide, areas. know fix it. Science works north border.

The Canada/US border remains closed, long time. live Canada, years. old it? distance Kashgar capital cities surrounding countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, etc) actually closer distance Urumqi. Oh. Great. relax now. Venezuela ‚Äòcure‚Äô. schools? schools area closed. mostly wearing masks? whats up? Enough minimizing!

I would like word ""fearmongering"" banished English language. Tired exactly? Tired attending fewer parties? really dont get bad behavior adjustments supposed make. key thing mask wearing indoor &amp; outdoor public spaces generally speaking high. Mask wearing normalized months now. People really got serious summer numbers really started climb SF around state.

Most social activities occur outdoors least right now. Office workspaces indoor dinning banned recently. Stores require mask people refused service. local grocery store paid security help enforce it.

We still 30-40 positive cases day positive test rate 1% weeks. certainly like really successful countries. Things could always better terms raw numbers people's personal behavior. economic costs small store businesses high. significant number shops closed good. city going significant revenue short falls coming year two. dire forecasts harsh mass transit cuts example. Wow, thank much suggestions! love idea trade less popular preferred chores other. could work really well. Again, really appreciate suggestions response. know people tired it, virus doesn‚Äôt care feelings. Stop bullshit makes others susceptible. Oh please. one cooped Switzerland long. never even full lockdown. amount bellyaching unreal. Several reasons.

1. Deaths lag. takes several weeks people go infected dead, sometimes month get death confirmed reported.

2. Testing. true number people got infected March/April huge, enough tests back sickest people got tested large portion died. tests confirm milder cases. (It estimated missed least nine ten cases then, still missing lot, probably closer three four.)

3. Demographics. people getting infected right younger people getting infected spring. gotten better protecting vulnerable. Deaths stay relatively low healthcare systems overwhelmed, disease prevelant shielding vulnerable longer feasible.

We know virus gotten less dangerous. Covid coronavirus genetically stable, typically mutate speed 10%-25% influenza viruses. disease severity perspective, known clinical differences existing variants. However, treatments also improved since spring positive impact mortality. ‚ÄúIt depends‚Äù 

But reporting, right, don‚Äôt. one should. can‚Äôt accept reporting dismiss reporting B. media China lie cover Uighur situation, example, obviously can‚Äôt trusted anything else either. It‚Äôs simple. regime *wanted* cover huge outbreak, would. don‚Äôt know do, probably don‚Äôt - can‚Äôt trust media operating controlling regime like theirs, even topics reason lie about. Trump fumbled coronavirus sure.

But, part makes fucking laugh democrats blame economy. work democrats advocating would shut earlier, longer. 

If Trump's economy garbage, democrats economy would even worse. Unemployment? Even higher. 

You lockdown earlier longer get better economy. thought second wave? fucking race... argh, Americans China blew whistle, virus starting spread Asia, Vietnam benefit relatively fewer travelers west others region. Communist government i.e. one cares people.

It's global scale, amount COVID death country (which less dependent testing) highly correlated integral number arrivals place virus actually started in, place covered March tries blame country found first. It‚Äôs like putting seatbelt. actions actually affect others too. It‚Äôs ultimate selfishness. I'm glad selected speech Smith saved us Aliens fucking matter. supreme court strike anything unconstitutional, federal not. strike local state laws time. strike executive orders too.

Please point section constitution amendment believe prevents government legally requiring mask. going wrap constitution like super spreader patriot, least read right? it. Quote part think says government make law regarding clothing masks. American. understand Supremacy Clause Necessary Proper Clause. Per capita, California okay relatively speaking.

They're 43.41 deaths per 100k population, ranks 28th per capita latest case/death charts, running 7-day !remindme 6 months guys win. Also, Swiss media never in-depth exposes like US newspapers conditions hospitals, portraits died, etc. remains abstract it‚Äôs difficult empathize care enough change behavior. Downvote oblivion Strokes / heart disease / sudden death likely, IMO. People already stressed cardiovascular systems heart attacks strokes, without presenting typical covid symptoms

There LOT stories people dying alone apartments due covid early on. need make america great realize there‚Äôs lag weekend, isn‚Äôt worst Sunday yet terms cases?  think precise opposite happen. believe that, soon many Americans hear vaccine approved, cease whatever half-hearted precautions taken. Many decide hold getting vaccinated bunch people long time without killing maiming many them. see variant 'free-rider' problem. Many expect others bear vaccine burden assume herd immunity keep safe. time tell plays out. expect steadily worsening situation winter. Infections may slow warmer weather returns, number people infected point likely mean higher rates infection, hospitalization death summer 2021 seeing now. Alright Clay. Spain masks schools mandatory. help leader country can‚Äôt give clear message save life ours.

Maybe message change. Instead deaths, talk overloading health care system medical problems treated.

If reports came accident victims, heart attacks, strokes, surgeries, illnesses, etc. wait turn...maybe would work. Another Alaskan here, living Anchorage. mask mandate lax enforced, even opened schools yet. it‚Äôs year hope one ever live again. sad. look forward detailed report *why*. wait. means first wave ? Europe second wave 2x worse first. US 80k cases day, would mean would closer 160k ? SHit. Good luck americans friends death rate asymptomatic infected 100%

Well I'm fairness, 80+ demographic probably likely pass without pandemic piling on. wear mask/refuse quarantine willing spread shit everywhere yeah, care much. complicated.  look deaths, 100 deaths today month ago discovered 10k cases. 1% CFR. 

They'll hit 500 deaths day soon. Although Spring death peak like 1k day. Honestly people kind given up. company started approve business travel again, got email Southwest Airlines saying allowing people middle seats December. wouldn‚Äôt surprised let go vaccine approved. Right? feel well, yet everyone claims everything everything. tribalism sub obscene. Ok, get sentiment like shut fuck saying there‚Äôs going one left vaccinate.

Yes, COVID bad nothing take lightly get mindset everyone going die. It‚Äôs healthy. large amounts coronavirus spike protein produced great accuracy,

They seem confident this. üòÄ focus shift distribution politics all. biological warfare. Like...literally? lol cmon, it‚Äôs like others aren‚Äôt even trying I'm sorry, aye, live fantasy land difference Norway Sweden approach COVID-19.

That simply means perfect comparison, mean bad comparison. study designed specifically research difference lockdowns made cannot commit much increased actual rates death, far lower numbers suggest terms hospital admissions, perhaps need stop arrogant enough think know better sources relying on.

After time still understand distinction I'm making ignorance think I'm brainwashed, not. I've repeatedly said Sweden *HAS* fucked up, living illusions fact, can't accept treat nothing equation I'm either you. Combine petulant need throw insults every comment tells far immature meaningful conversation topic pandemic management. Yeah, I‚Äôm annoyed I‚Äôm getting downvoted. look, it‚Äôs clear federal government failed American people. But, statistics without level underlying analysis useless. Googler broken? God. selfish piece shit you. can't imagine 30 mindset toddler. surprising all, buddy got week, work crew got (he works pavement crew) county hardly wears masks even really required. tells worst thing get. think meant use mask over. Use it, put laundry get fresh one next day. need supply cloth masks. LOL. like work government covid know I'm talking obviously don't. party? I'm neither Democrat republican. many assumptions. resorting ad hominems counter argument. think we're done here. Lol plant. I'm starting think ""plant"". projecting. I'm countries deaths much much lower first wave. peak first wave rolling 7 day avg cases peaked 400 cases per day. time deaths peaked 51 per day. current 7 day rolling avg cases around 1400, 7 day avg deaths today 13. concern mostly influenza. way raise animals world creates perfect environment viral transmission. raise animals way before, putting humanity risk want LOT cheap meat.

Also, 3rd coronavirus 20 years given us problems. SARS, MERS, SARS-2. 

You can't look like 100-Year flood happens like clockwork every hundred years, one means happen hundred years. also changed things 100 year floods happening much frequently places.

 Stochasticity something might want look understand frequency events better. France like 1.5 times California 

California never even hit 20k day Way go! know one it, get spread others photo one parents grandparents. That's Fall spike. Sickening!!!  emphatic YES keeps going, too. (And I‚Äôm introvert)  I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs federal prohibition US Treasury Federal Reserve federal agencies, there. Melbourne today: deaths zero cases 700/day couple months ago. hated lockdown overjoyed now. 7 months bit misinformation STILL masks stolen. local German officials mistaken. Read article Pfizer's preparations. spent billions logistics - distribution fast far reaching.  First, lots misconceptions article. example. say nurses can't performe oxygen threatment without doctors approval like something bad? course something doctor prescribes.

The article says that, opinion one health professionals interviewed, *either* sent hospital *or* nurses able give treatment. pretty telling try twist article like that. guideline said patients automatically sent hospitals got sick covid. strange att all, probably nursing homes work countries. provide care nursing homes well.

The care provided insufficient many thousands died. countries hospitals full old people. Since Swedish policy send elderly hospital case Sweden. mostly young middle aged hospitals apparently.

Edit:

Also, read article see information UK, National Care Association says believes care available Covid-19 patients ""**no matter old sick**"" Association German Aid Elderly Disabled says **every patient coronavirus symptoms seen doctor single patient received care needed**. cases, **entire care homes** moved hospitals. **Many homes also keep emergency oxygen **The Danish Nurses Association says patients need oxygen currently sent hospital.** could reviewed shortage ventilators, although age would affect future guidelines.

Thats policy decision. defend happy letting 60s die annoying pretend never happened. know happened. beliefs. precious. It‚Äôs corner, points said corner many deaths 88,973?  honest, Europe still 150% cases per capita average though. 

However, cases saying fast Sweden still bad many European countries. üëå advanced pandemic plan place SARS, working feds another department time certainly lot cross-border discussion. another doubling go election day. 

5-14 days. person voting would quite dangerous. People voted early smart ones. research government provided us would indicate children play negligible role spreading virus. no, that's particular concern mine point. spreading around like crazy, course I'd care. mean can't base actions sort hunch would spread around research indicates opposite?

There whole team scientists people probably far smarter myself, continually evaluating assessing situation, deemed safe keep schools open point (with measures they're taking, allowing parents school grounds, increased ventilation, hand washing you). stubbornly keep children home, they'll bored, lonely, learn nearly much? benefits that? nurse agree. replaceable. cares us. aboot forth wave?!? üò≥ Why? It‚Äôs like curfew making difference. addition positives found protocol, also players contracted virus civilians teams recovered issues well.

Original comment - nobody arguing zero risk, really small risk. provide single scientific paper. done wasting time? really, shifting burden proof?

I think problem understand complexity situation. Countries wildly different outcomes wildly different government interventions, hard draw conclusions regarding death rates stringency government interventions countless factors play mention role timing pure chance. 

If Nordics comparable, come large difference terms flu season fatality between, say Denmark Sweden? [Denmark saw 60% excess mortality flu season that's Stockholm covid peak April. flu season, Sweden [barely strayed mortality **Everyone agrees nordics completely comparable differences deaths due different strategies** 

Oh, yet another sweeping statement possibly can't back up. Dude, arguing good faith. even admitted cherry-picking scientific studies support bogus claims. expect anybody take seriously point? USA CA. It‚Äôs almost 8 months. anybody else still staying home? certainly smarter us, yes. Correct. lmao that's read rural, conservative counties people give fuck anymore. mask wearing, etc Heard brother recently, said Trump win, resign understanding forgiven (taxes, etc.,) go jail. Biden takes control begins taking measures Trump refused do. 

It's interesting idea. brother clever mind, wrong guessing affairs state. would certainly stop Trump's followers protesting destroying property. end, would Trump's saving grace, allowing retire FL home peacefully. 

Dunno. think? mean essentially he‚Äôs right. Money needs represent least something real, else inflation. don‚Äôt think US government cares common citizen either, oppose American government Chinese government. 

You also support one opposing other. That's also possibility. Spending 99% time opposing one government saying support initiatives opposing ""both"". want sound like hypocrite. Anyone point government say something agree with. reasoning? none fancy shit goin' here.. I'm Paris seen six months. Oh, see. I'm sure China able accomplish without American universities. still highly dependent send students West, able recruit university faculty West well. unfortunate side effect anti-intellectualism decades ago. going roll eyes correction, saw username.

Thanks! Spread correct grammar around :) think virus spreads easier low humidity, happens winter

Edit: also Commonwealth form government organised states mid sized populations large amounts autonomy. Perfect controlling virus. fucking morons would shit right like two months would many fewer deaths fraction cases. He's either spreading intentionally misinformed unintentionally. Foreign press (especially across pond) terrible covering Sweden number areas; politics, health, economy etc. literally right now, highly doubt it. Similar superbugs common hospitals virus. great. ? Like fact performing arts scene allowed work NYC. Fines. Make anti-mask folks revenue source. Pitch paying hospital spending, push money towards covid supplies hospitals. rest cities keep fill budget hole trump recession. suspect Sweden might got something right (though getting many things wrong too) - sustainable restrictions. people adjust new normal. Banning indoor dining/hospitality (and tourists) would good start. coming. Starving, violence, depression take lot longer develop.

I heard people starving lockdown. Global food supply still pretty stable especially affluent countries. 

Depression violence usually multifactorial. Lockdown exacerbate existing rifts would sole cause. time, sounds people want promote idea depression would happen lockdown happens opposed letting pandemic run uncontrolled killing people left right.

There people devastating stories parents dying outbreak leaving alone world. nie m√≥w tak brzydko think lot people think that, he‚Äôs going able anything substantially different. don‚Äôt anything him, doesn‚Äôt miracle button magical phrase. 

Lockdowns unsustainable catastrophic numerous reasons. time might make sense completely eradicate disease, similar New Zealand China. Outside they‚Äôre complete waste money lasting consequences. Even said stop them. 

Trump keeps talking vaccine, that‚Äôs going solution either. enough people going take make difference. 

Try mandate war. literal war, people sides aisle already saying they‚Äôre going get it. 

I don‚Äôt think people going accept lockdowns either. 

Hard say exit strategy point, know story going regardless who‚Äôs White House.

TL;DR - personal strategy follow that. That‚Äôs we‚Äôre doing. fine matter what. Well seem pretty informed thank feedback. consider better informed country now. Thanks! ever trying? mean among white house staff? think information scientifically available yet. Still researching. think know exactly people point makes numbers even scarier, 50K positive chose get tested 1st place. think French intellectual worldly? Well Trump gave us crystal clean air water ever, can't Covid either them! excellent news! Kudos scientists working day night make happen. Times like really make us realize real heroe are. going back here. 2000 Cases one day. Flu season arriving, NY shutdown again, I'd put money it. Lol - documented say well documented definitely would say.

Confirmed cases reinfections beyond anecdotes high, something follow sure right understand enough virus confirm reinfections commonplace cases outliers. 

The changes COVID-19 documented well enough find least 3 different papers right different academics state mutating rapid enough pace concern. mostly benign changes. I'm pretty surprised came right said like that. mean that's obviously strategy along I've never seen one actually state directly camera like misdirection excuses anything it. course print money long like, functions currency debasement. expand money supply, note money based real value. Increasing supply without increasing what‚Äôs behind increase inflation. Fine short term. Potentially disastrous long term. don‚Äôt need go examples Third Century Crisis Kipper und Wipper. Increasing money supply combat budget shortfalls primary causes behind those. It‚Äôs ludicrous you‚Äôre going assert many countries right isn‚Äôt exactly Yeah, fuck people. feel like it‚Äôs majority. make fine point, we‚Äôre still first wave. They‚Äôre tracking estimated cases back March hospitalisations. Hypothetically exactly per capita March (were curing far though). current rate hospitalisation estimate 100-150k per day back March ride been. seeing deaths rapid incline? 200,000 deaths since start pandemic, would assume exponential death toll would increase increased infection numbers? US isn‚Äôt country world thought sub virus general already know deaths covid largely affect older age groups. People like latch onto single dimension data try use primary basis argument wanting restrictions lifted, hasty generalization.

People ages demographics hospitalized. real risk is, always been, overwhelming hospitals. happens, people younger age groups require hospitalization may able receive care need survive. people non-covid illnesses may able receive care need. Subsequently, death rate goes up. logic really simple. Fewer restrictions = cases = hospitalizations deaths. bad.

I pay attention much national data, source that. Here's state's data: Feel free analyze yourself.  Ueu lot people over. means shopping enclosed spaces rest us.  shit human being. sorry woman selfish didn‚Äôt take safety consideration. hope don‚Äôt it, know guess testing best bet. don‚Äôt get idiots like that.

I guess Biden makes major reforms mitigate climate change subsequently following administration reverse actions. make much difference though. Businesses requiring masks anyway. Europe actually worse US right per capita basis, argument valid before. area old folks home? Remember CDC said masks relevant made difference, lol. That's good work there. recognize effort. probably did, took generational change seat belt compliance rise become mandatory. FDR went say bank failures economic derangement would go away really soon, like miracle, try anything all.

oh, wait 18-24 demographic I'm talking about. young children. situation really sad. seems like wearing mask minor temporary inconvenience really save lives people won‚Äôt it. I‚Äôm sure why. It‚Äôs possible 

1. Humans fundamentally selfish thought. 

2. political discourse toxic people oppose wearing masks simply doctors, academics, democrats say should.

That‚Äôs enough slow epidemic alot, especially considering many point ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù himmunized. We're two weeks sub suddenly deciding accept it, worry. parents get quarantine tomorrow!! Can't wait finally go home!! Non-british amateur data analyst here:

Answer: probably France currently worse situation UK. 

Analysis: 

Population similar numbers compared directly.

7 days average cases 20.249 (UK) 29.472 french.

But reliable? 

UK cases might slightly underreported:

Countries measure cases deaths correctly tend 1% fatality rate 15-20 days ago cases (7 days average cases).

(Example: today 20K daily average cases, 14-20 days 200 daily average deaths).

This compliant know COVID lethality might local deviation myriad reasons. 

UK average deaths today 163 expected today death rate due 14 days ago cases 130 so. suggest undercounting 25 % cases.

French average deaths today 173 expected 14 days ago cases 160 so. even 10% so... believe French cases 14 days ago quite fine... feel free add 10% daily cases analysis feel need to.

Extrapolating (which need correct) leaves us somewhere arpund 20-25K (UK) 30-33K (France).

So France worse situation.

This compliant fact French daily average death count raising faster UK one (on day 15th october UK passed 100 deaths per day average, France day 17th. 7 days later French data higher UK one).

UK averaging 1000 deaths day peak. predicting going back 1000?

Same France.

I add though, know someone lives Toronto, whose mom lives live come stay due people apparenty wearing masks Toronto's public transit sytems. seem harder enforce mask usage trains, subways large buses often one enforce - except bus driver buses, hard alone stop person back taking mask. early Sept, can't say public transit mask situation now. Common sense. Simple common sense.

Here's latest case/death charts state, running 7-day curves. Relative states Kentucky done okay terms cases deaths, curves never really flattened.

The state 32.88 deaths per 100k, ranking 36th terms per capita effective treatments play role.

Have seen spike fatalities? No. exactly problem? Sure, STDs usually harder spread. 

It's one thing jeopardize health partner (who agreed unprotected sex), another jeopardize health every person meet (and potentially people even meet, spreading surfaces). mean seeing rise NJ plenty restrictions place, like Florida trending significantly worse lot places.

Right see something similar US kind see map too... New England currently well comparison everyone else. known reserved ""unfriendly"" (we touchy feely keep ourselves, misanthropists whatever). cultural behavior might bigger impact people think.

And worry, realize states good viral meltdown sure follow delay. Sweden Nordic countries likewise high alert this, living isolation people places high transmission. saw herd immunity /s say stock market might really well. there's that. Half American People. mean, least contract acute respiratory illness 99.5% survival rate. great they've able validate mechanism targeting production spike protein seems working.

I hope enough clinical events soon start pulling together initial trial results. That's story I'm waiting for. COVID-19/Influenza Run? think means masks nearly 100 percent effective since many locations still don‚Äôt wear masks. like countries ""real"" shutdowns shutting again.  r/im14andthisisdeep downvote dude asking legitimate question. 

For lesser cases seem like cold terms symptoms. heard lose smell taste, tired, coughing, runny nose. similar flu symptoms.

The worser cases people ventalied can't breathe. 

Honestly, cold symptoms would get tested similar would want catch early possible know sick flu sick covid. Please mister president, can't take winning. much. What's crazy insane amount money diagnostic labs make this. Like would laughing way bank. Name them. see would low efficacy rate. virus barely mutated. I've heard would something would hard find effective vaccine like flu hiv constantly changing. fair also recognize federal government can‚Äôt magically print money never-ending quantities (like it‚Äôs doing) cant believe news Next Easter. unless get another wave next fall. Easter 2022.  Im tired I'm really selfish piece shit. explain think am? 

I said I'm pretty sure die covid response someone saying ""I prefer live you"". Based science data, true statement. called loser claim think know better medical experts, done anywhere. asked medical experts disagree me, call piece shit. providing evidence medical experts I'm allegedly disagreeing with.

Also, online calling idiot piece shit, gall say I'm one toddler mindset. That's pretty rich. 100k pretty much since beginning. Common estimates true level infection 4x (conservative estimate) 10x (aggressive estimate) amount catch testing. could pushing near million day right now.

This is, without question, third wave. fetish fear pain simply enjoy something interesting life, it‚Äôs scary admit we‚Äôre well pandemic.

No, sorry, (figuratively speaking) see person purposefully walking toward edge cliff (while yelling insults try stop threaten take one cliff edge try stop them) I'll call stupid, face even, willingly risk lives.

To coddle baby solves nothing. hope prevent harming others. Pandering 'being nice' solves nothing, person like that. :( 


Don't think true factual information blatantly anyone easily see, simple easy understand reasons, anti-maskers would smartened now? I'm saying give trying get people see truth, actions shown 'deserve' civility, show none others. Isn‚Äôt headline number cases get tested? 2% number might accurate? read article Salt Lake City Tribune likely begin rationing care ICUs. Well, we're boned.

Trump resigns, Mike Pence becomes President, Joe Biden. Biden become President January 20. 

Mike Pence could pardon Trump, protect Trump state charges.

I think Trump's narcissism would let resign. 

There's one way Biden could become President prior January 20. Pence could nominate Biden Vice President resign, making Biden President Biden's appointment VP would require approval majority houses Congress see Senate going along. Latest studies show fomites (virus found surfaces) major source infection. Instead aerosols/droplets spread this. keep washing hands avoid shaking people's, best bet avoid avoiding indoor areas strangers. indoors, good fitting mask (or preferably respirator like N95). control indoor environment, work ventilation keeping windows open cold, using HEPA air purifiers. Also humidifier may come helpful, low relative humidity seems increase virus' ability spread. 

There studies suggest mask wearing may lead less severe infections. Depends whether viral inoculum dose impacts outcome, that's contentious. masks face coverings protect degree lower odds infected. quality mask, fit, long exposed infectious person, amount infectious virus emit play role. mainstream view virology/epidemiology single viron infect you, probably better think terms probabilities. better mask, better fit, better ventilation, less time exposed, less virus person emitting increase safety. thought lives Matter? Apparently lives matter. give fuck. know supposed spread faster winter, understand why? infections spread easier warmer weather and, also, people likely stay indoors away others wintertime? hope people remember vote. 'second wave' thing crazy. real? Please real everyone would let glorious leader cancel federal testing, would hardly cases! Eh depends city. feel relatively safe DC city worse gets. forgot /s apparently... also cell vs b cell response. Seems cell response may play important role long term immunity. tests harder perform. Money token goods services distributed government, concepts contradict Interesting. Thanks response. correct, good understanding nuances Islamic faith.

Wow. crazy see parts USA like this. feels like covid world DC. best area country actually wearing masks üëèüèª agree. Japan South Korea alright too.

Mall santas locked up, hmm, down. Deaths are, been, decline so.... I'm expecting way full lockdown too.. sadly job deemed semi medical continue even truly necessary people seeing bad boss keeping us employees safe..  government primarily relying herd mentality. 

Not brainwash people thinking government great job, convince people virus sniffles mall Santas, retail workers, grocery clerks, meat packers, fruit pickers, clothing manufacturers accept lower pay despite elevated risk. 

And even portion knows danger, idiots don't. fill space cog smart ones drop out. 

It's genius.

So much winning...

Maybe. Perhaps üòâ countries actually done robust contact tracing, risk dining low. RKI daily brief findings virus spreads care homes, places work like factories slaughterhouses, group living situations, family gatherings.

The spread restaurants, trains, planes virtually nil. countries actually strong contact tracing found same. policy changed saw domino effect people wearing masks, first stores. nearly everyone wears one. may true people able work home (and receive maternity leave first place), jobs can't done remotely? even among jobs move home permanent basis, lot stuff we're seeing suggests home-based work automatically afford flexibility. chance high level remote workers benefit long run, suspect group small. Asia using masks long time.

We bizarre lunatic US made things really complicated waging campaign them. Holy shit, thought bad Europe. fuck?  Please give up. second point make worries seem matter say 200 thousand people died.. say numbers real sick something else would died anyway. assume real numbers much smaller. upsetting treating people pre existing conditions somehow expendable deserve time left even week months often they'd fine without covid ""something"" well covid..  type Swedens deathrate per capita year? week 1-38 ~668 compared Finland ~719 extremely deadly virus per se since IFR 0.8%, extremely contagious virus that's dangerous.

An extremely deadly virus ebola death rate 50% something deal every fall think you‚Äôll know difference allergies covid.

Idk that. many people asymptomatic mild symptoms. people wildly different symptoms people.
My coworker tested positive recently headache slight sore throat. thought allergies 5 days lost sense smell. 

I take Allegra, use air purifier home salt water rinses neti pot, sometimes enough. also condition effects digestive system occasionally get sick stomach arthritis joints randomly flare up. happens I'm sick viruses too. 
It's pain ass people chronic conditions lol. bought avocado toast they'd money hand.

I understand using money help jobs prop oil. Invest wind there. policy called xenophobic. Pelosi also urging people eat SFO Chinatown. NYC health officials (all Democrats) encouraged mass gatherings Lunar New Year shouting ‚ÄúGo Wuhan‚Äù. wonder NYC mess. death rate may way high, every estimate pushed way low.

And people can't fathom things like covid mutating worse way, made probable lackadaisical attitude.

If covid enters, say, difficult infect host, evolve infect said host, transfer back humans, could bad situation. happened minks Norway, example. endemic diseases sometimes work. 

Letting covid run wild increases odds zoonotic derived mutation. Things always get worse, better. unwavering basic need people things get better mean will.

Want hear scary words happened yet? Avian covid. two weeks deaths worth COVID deaths, total deaths 2020 among lowest history country.

That's bullshit claim. (if all) nations could say thing mortality decreased across board last century.

The fact is, last six years period January 1 September 30, 2020 seen highest mortality.

  Number deaths period January 1 September 30

I think appreciate true numbers. are. prove really, statistically, deadly sick old. Yes outliers. always are. likely case. Wales here. We‚Äôre full lockdown again. Everything shut bar essentials. 

Feels bad man. call ‚Äúthird wave‚Äù first wave longer people‚Äôs attention spans. even 10% hospital beds occupied COVID patients. ICUs different story. 50% occupied COVID patients without taking account sort upscaling still take place push comes shove. Yeah almost 89,000 cases day scary even scary positive % way up. waves, surges. We're third surge expected worse previous two ones because, seeing cases rising 40+ States and, winter upon us, people spend time indoors close contact.

Be safe people: Wear mask, wash hands often practice social distancing. measures make difference. thought Kentucky bad. like twice awful. dont know guys wearing mask reminds careful, seeing people masks reminds need wearing mask too. need wear mask every time leave home. taking walk bring along case, need wear nobody around. Gamify! kids, anything made game competition. fun everyone week's Cleaning Olympics, better.

According 2020, \[Titan\] franchise **value** amounted around 2.3 billion U.S. dollars.

$350,000. Yeah, that's really going sting. Vietnamese government understood pandemic contagious behavior would fucking destroy population government's legitimacy let sweep over. tons states ICU beds entire country Vietnam. such, coordinated serious effort national level way local level.

1) locked borders, one in, one out.

2) ensured resources properly distributed despite lack medical resources Vietnam general

3) setup strong quarantine measures; half ass self quarantines. tested positive, government picks forces quarantine government facility. strong quarantine good testing policies, able stamp almost immediately ever got rolling.

4) general, Vietnamese understood deadliness pandemic they've experienced it.

5) lock happened, true lock down. Barely anyone moved weeks. tested much possible, forced quarantines upon people. contributed able keep virus control. lmao.

Infact though general trends fashion uk gets 5 years usa 10 years eu countries.

Before issue looking bat shit insane trends usa past couple years kinda worried. Agreed. It‚Äôs time rise occasion way Greatest generation did. accomplished whining infighting. Lol. argument friend. wait til find like 8k people die every day US regardless covid. scenario happen regardless. Georgia including rapid Covid tests numbers. yes, US probably 100k day.  Thats fair - although hour first date lay conditions marriage yeah, even think hilarious actually worked out! defense, intend see wanted date go movies with. explanation witchcraft.

Seriously though, get saying. personally think intimacy marriage good idea takes learn yourself, let alone another person. 

Which leads favorite comeback ever writing group, older member opined ""easy virtue never attractive,"" replied, ""really? worked me!"" I‚Äôm aware strategy. I‚Äôm talking outcome. course I‚Äôm aware Sweden‚Äôs population distribution, that‚Äôs exactly comparison UK, Spain, Italy US completely stupid. Compare similar countries see badly Sweden doing. Might sign unsubscribe people talking about. 

Every time show numbers, especially putrid republican human scum part time bioterrorists, pseudo comeback - well death rates down. idiots dont realize infected numbers go (drastically) chances virus mutating go exponentially. One wrong mutation fucked beyond reprieve.

These uneducated, illiterate bioterrorist human scum going kill us all. Hm, yep. first post looked dude who‚Äôs staying home since february, finally girl sex, also home since february, everyone telling look symptoms again. Give break, people need actual help. gonna something keep since start? It‚Äôs insane. work Walmart Michigan, fucking reason, MANY customers walking store masks on, despite masks required. live big college town well, it‚Äôs like small Walmart store. 

It‚Äôs like American population giving day don‚Äôt like it. Yes people died sucks, response country far perfect, locking seven cases day reasonable. America's land borders closed sine March. 

Key: *land*

Flights stopped, far know. thought border Canada States *was* hardlocked friend informed could still *fly* there. That‚Äôs second layer joke. still say months ago: dear mods, would possible reconsider automatic post generated? currently generated 2pm UTC, means Europe, day already passed, usually sticky post previous day date.

Older children teens, yeah. probably capable making busy, adhere schedule take care needs.  Healthcare workers absolutely 1st. vulnerable occupation amount virus exposed to. also seriously need help treat rest us, covid non covid related ailments. mall Santa gets vaccine healthcare workers one, travesty. respectfully disagree case anymore, still limited testing capacity (5 times March), extensive search trace contacts test everyone suspected. Right real estimated cases based discrepancy identified cases new cases correlated ones found previous days aswell datas.  nothing. even bother? virus originate may ask. conspiracy theories US spread silly. China released pandoras box upon world lied downplayed seriousness, continue lay blame China disaster people sociopaths. full lockdown regions? exactly closed opened? still little evidence reopening schools drives COVID spread

COVID cases spiked everywhere since school started. That's coincidence. 

My state alone, allowed hybrid full person learning, broken daily case records, multiple times, last weeks. 

I guarantee schools opening huge factor increase cases solid evidence next months. happens 11 years Facebook Coincidentally, wave equal human attention span. opposite mormon family stereotype. reasoning would acceptable ""individuals"" reasonable treat situation.

‚ÄúThings getting worse, Vincent.‚Äù

Patient updates: 
Pro bono remote advise patients throughout world. unpredictable disease. Coagulation issues starting week 3

New York - 1000 people day admitted sick people won‚Äôt go hospital according Urgent Care.

Moderna- fully enrolled trial good news.

Each state plan. hoping April start large numbers people vaccinated. American charged vaccine.

UK challenge trial starting using laboratory grown strain live virus. Argument able tell 10 weeks prove efficacy. using young, healthy people won‚Äôt know work others. 

When get efficacy data ongoing trials? check predetermined numbers infections see efficacy data. get data next month. case counts go up, able data infections.

CDC analysis school infections, etc.
1 5 deaths 65.
Majority people died caucasians. disproportionately affects African Americans, deaths Caucasian.

Excess deaths- aren‚Äôt counting Covid deaths. Largest increase deaths 25 -44. Why? lost 300,000 Americans. 2/3 confirmed Covid, don‚Äôt know rest.

Indoor dining holidays- 
Most SARS-COV-2 transmission close contact. Indoor holidays- indoor dining usually close contact. Outdoor dining bubble create indoor space.

9 recommendations:
1. outdoors
2. 6 feet apart
3. Exposure time cumulative 
4. Open doors, windows improve ventilation 
5. Wash hands 
6. Get tested 
7. Zoom holiday parties 
(That‚Äôs said missed numbering)

Treatment drug updates:
Repurposed anti viral drugs - little effect Covid-19. (Remdesivir, hydroxychloriquine ,etc)

Prone positioning helpful. careful prone position people.

Unnecessary antibiotics- 10% infection almost everyone gets antibiotics

Patients early ICU get lungs filled thick, jellylike substance. It‚Äôs hyalurune.

People don‚Äôt get COVID. long term effects last weeks months.

Daniel working 30 doctors around world publish consensus stages virus treatment made appropriate times. Yeah. really fucking telling much West cares feel like many comments lately topic, it‚Äôs minds household. school wife teaches small rural community. school decided open fully without enforcement masks. kids talk shit openly disrespectful toward teachers wearing masks. sent principal‚Äôs office, get sent back. Originally, teachers told (preopening) send kids office happens enough times l, would put independent study. Numerous parents teachers stated get tested symptoms. little way safety precautions backup. admin pitting faculty mask issue. There‚Äôs going large outbreak. It‚Äôs inevitable. good friend also teaches school opened earlier. given time, there‚Äôs dozen kids ‚Äútwo week independent study.‚Äù knows actual numbers actually like. 99.997% also based 100% diagnosis rate. must much higher percentage now.

Its not. alot people U.S. take while. like 3rd phase first First two paragraphs thinking sincere. Good work worked exactly 1 day bossman called offer hazard pay coming scanning sending mail. took it, thankfully, next day receptionist came answer phones, third week in, chick came cuz bored home bossman gladly welcomed in. two people share office started coming regularly. summers end, office manager coming month, second attorney started popping semi regularly.

Now, days 8 people small office building. People bring office snacks, like motherfucking communal popcorn tin stick nasty ass hands live long day.

Oh top that, receptionist meeting people DL, bossman's knowledge, even though supposed closed public.

these people talking holiday dinners potlucks since motherfuckin' May. fuck that. 

I'm trying go back school get CA teaching credential next semester, hopefully let early take zoom class, another legit reason quit. change number people actually died. Good. Fuck Florida. believe escaped lab Wuhan I'd absolutely get vaccinated soon available What's take ""grades go up"" policies? Unfair system encourages truancy, acceptable method account lockdown disruption? difference obese morbid obesity. Lol yes. covid like least concerning thing catch. change hookup culture  fuck? publically admitted heart skipped beat misread title. Dodged President Harris now.  higher rest Italy, region around Rome affected. good map Europe scroll think China contained it? 1.3 billion whatever Chinese 250 active cases? invisible enemy. stop 1,3 billion people getting bitten dogs something virus. 50 players tested positive.  What? didn‚Äôt really math? testing available first peak second, know really cases deaths ratio then. I‚Äôm sure agree Norwegian Danish ones much restrictive, especially practice.

I promise different. Denmark practically closed (it quiet), could see Sweden open. actually considered Spain ""success story"" US (I doubt that) talks US Spain. I'm spanish nobody would call experience pandemic ""success story"".

That said, lockdown back march acted late choice Healthcare system brink. lockdown worked intended. 

Then state alarm decayed, Healthcare went back Autonomous Communities. So, different strategies descalation, pretty bad. tracers, enough testing political bikering central government, besides lax enforcement measures bars restaurants oper doors tourists. Now, are. don‚Äôt get curfew thing. Aren‚Äôt people going spread day? (I‚Äôm serious. I‚Äôm sarcastic. Yeah false talking point people want believe... like virus gone summer...or virus never leave china...etc Sure, exclude millions Mao killed others died due CCP profiteering. Doesn‚Äôt surprise all. work small town. Literally everyone seems related marriage friends other. Everyone knows neighbors. Contact tracing much interconnection add two week delay conservatives hide virus embarrassed since think it‚Äôs hoax plus church. spreads easy. 

People small towns seem hang lot larger areas (like know neighbor two houses couldn‚Äôt pick lineup). Shhhh much logic. state idea two digestible preferably catchy words? Like ""fake news"". What's big plan? cases rising exponentially everywhere Europe? learned anything pandemic CDC incompetent real jurisdiction. unpaid college interns trying secure ppe. Try again. influenza go? ""There clear cases COVID-19 fomite transmission found literature. "" go describe possible cases, nothing surface definitely culprit. Granted, surface lead transmission really hard track, reasonably common seen least one confirmed case now. also hospital researches swabbed surface around positive patients, found viral material, failed grow viable virus lab. See ""Low risk SARS-CoV-2 transmission fomites real-life conditions"" /r/COVID19/comments/j2dvxk/low_risk_of_sarscov2_transmission_by_fomites_in/

There recent statement made China latest cluster caused fomite spread via CT machine, PR statement, academic study, I'm sure much stock would put it. Overall, seems virus spread easily lacks direct access lungs. oil companies fuck workers

I'm first one, know second. think lot blue-collar oil workers trying make money support families. clean energy jobs area, I'm sure many people qualms switching over.

Like, it'd weird say, ""fuck poor people drive old, inefficient cars,"" could afford Tesla, I'm sure would. US irrelevant, Sweden

Yes no. 

A. Every discussion Sweden's covid response always colored ""should *we* (whomever are) something similar""..

B. weak safety net argument lockdown. quote Lancet independent peer reviewers informed us Surgisphere would transfer full dataset, client contracts, full ISO audit report servers analysis transfer would violate client agreements confidentiality requirements. such, reviewers able conduct independent private peer review therefore notified us withdrawal peer-review process.

In France Soir article Dr Landry quote 2400 mg first 24 hours 800 mg day 2 day 10. 10 day course treatment total. quite high doses make sure blood levels got high enough chance killing virus.

This far excess safe recommended HCQ dosages, widely considered toxic levels. Even acute malaria cases dosing recommendations call 2,000mg 48 hours. Landry dosing 2,400mg 24 hours 3,200mg 48 mg salt (620 mg base) orally initial dose, followed 400 mg salt (310 mg base) 6, 24, 48 hours initial doseTotal dose: 2000 mg salt (1550 mg really. YYG 16% beginning October. math. work. would lockdown affected degree propose, especially voluntary lockdown recommendations already encouraged fairly significant changes behavior?

It's simple... people work elder care facilities far less contact rest population, dramatically reducing *their* chance exposed virus, affect dramatically reducing chance infecting vulnerable people care for.

It's number contacts. employees little interaction general population, much less likely infected. general population isolated other, spread infection slows dramatically even brought halt, like New Zealand.

No spread infection general population means chance infection spread elder care facilities. That's New Zealand suffer thousands deaths elder care facilities. study Germany August trust government, social cohesion mutual helpfulness actually increased since February: study undertaken conservative, usually rather solid think tank; apparently people already 'lower rungs social scale' agree least trend. Unsurprisingly, study also finds existing social financial discrepancies exasperated. care. cases rising. know rising.

Masks - especially low efficacy masks like cloth masks - one many things need followed order reduce Rt virus. evidence says yes, masks help reduce spread, foolproof lot noise data. 

Had industrial effort dramatically ramp production high efficacy N95 masks summer (realistically combined eyewear) widely distributed free every US household mandate wear I'd agree sentiment.

Stop lying. never said driving car risky covid. never said covid risk.

What's happening making things attacking them.

*What's wrong you?* get virus personally know someone profoundly stricken. numbers high enough spread first-hand belief, time gnashing teeth. 

I doubts two positive tests two weeks crippling fatigue showed truth. Countries people could flexibly adapt behavior serve greater good. Even US states like Numbers mean nothing without context. asymptomatic virus many. need know actual infection rate. many positive/how many tested? second picture, wow that‚Äôs lot people tight quarters! Winter make worse. Plus US holiday season coming better believe alot grandma's insist everyone comes Thanksgiving. Might stupid question, Biden wins, see notable shift numbers? ship sailed? It‚Äôs every school Well still week scientific perspective, absence better models, Nordic countries Sweden, Denmark, Norway Finland ‚Äì culturally, economically, politically geographically similar ‚Äì may, serendipitously, represent powerful intervention Compared neighboring countries, Sweden taken less drastic measures prevent spread coronavirus. Nordic countries closing down, Sweden kept borders open members European Union. Schools younger children, restaurants, shops, bars remained open Nordic countries applied Finland, Norway, Denmark implemented lockdowns line nations, severely restricting movement people closing schools say outcome Sweden's strategy best compared countries, given similar demographics, culture, political 5,500 people died Covid-19 country 10 million. one highest death rates relative population size Europe, far worst among Nordic nations. Unlike Sweden, rest chose lock early pandemic.

I mean, keep going. world disagrees you, poor, brainwashed Swede.  Masks super important. social distancing even critical. Stay 6‚Äô+ around you. Try avoid sharing air people around you.


The CDC adjusted recommendations from, limit exposure maximum 15 minutes, cumulative maximum 15 minutes per day. Nah Europe heading back Dark Ages well now, that‚Äôs cool! Exactly thinking. Scary stuff. Imagine everyone US tested weekly could get tested easily, free, moment felt symptoms.

On average, even without *any* initiative people get tested early disease course, catch disease within 3-4 days catching it. Now, instead spreading 7-14 days asymptomatically, spread 3-4. also catch decent number close contacts. people spreading either, likely catch people prevent spreading even earlier date relative infection.

With R0 lower 1, catching cases driving further. can't stomp completely like this. tests perfect would miss positives. However, population level, positive test would prevent hundreds potential infections. current setup, people get tested feel symptoms. Even then, usually days symptoms, sitting around making sure ""real"" rather making big fuss getting COVID test.

What sustainable, spending tons money COVID tests requiring people get tested once/week, spending trillions trillions keeping economy shut year wait vaccine?

Even complete success, could *more* open testing contact tracing. pushing ""tolerable"" level openness towards normal, exactly want keep control effective vaccine developed. saw one long ago Texas. Shit wacky, could harness bound zealotry good.  main factor weather, I'm sure.

Try outdoor dining Miami Minneapolis fall. may notice difference. number infected gre 10% every day, entire US population would infected 88 days ‚Äúwe‚Äôre still first wave!‚Äù 

People want spell doom gloom like we‚Äôre going die soon. normalized % population? Fair, death rate much higher isn‚Äôt government-level data. cases widely-respected academic institutions. Depend are. enough. want coffee shop Pugh good last week 10 people sitting inside, none masks on. Idc never got rid first wave nation wide... stupid.... Melbourne already enough, want us come crush guys?? 

Kidding though, want borders open Aussie brothers miss you! 0 new cases Victoria, Australia countries dire trend moment. Italy, Belgium, France, Czech Republic, others seeing insane growth. quite level march yet, think nothing substantial done next 3 weeks deaths compare early days. difference hospitals bit capacity readiness, mean saturated patients sent elsewhere. US upward trend well bit slower countries far. nothing done end November going look quite bad lot states. fear mongering close election. working! Go vote make sure counted legit way. #trump2020 going saym Wife working home ended office instantly dragged back in. Numbers statewide going wrong direction again. Everything open even mask mandates ending. people work may servers bartenders. even lots places defying limits packed full Except beginning can't think surrounding state full lockdown. Limits full lockdown. One can't technically visit wait bit longer. seems like locking isn‚Äôt option want economy go toilet. numbers keep going up. I‚Äôm sorry seems like actively going outside interacting people everyday. odds you‚Äôre bound catch virus sooner later. doesn‚Äôt help good chunk people got ‚Äúle tired‚Äù pandemic.

Anyways, last MLB testing results posted, 57 total positive players season. let go find NFL. NFL 47 total positives monitoring period. 100. ‚Äúthousands‚Äù like claimed. 

That better data you?  get fuck out?

If can't give shit country, get fuck it, country would want you.

Everyone wants 'make America great again' ... better get line army uniform forced vaccinations, mandatory testing, fines wearing masks like 1908 established dedicated mask courts punish people wear them, average life expectancy 41.

If that's greatness people want, need lead example stop whiney pussies today sounds like ""I want take minor inconvenience complain compare brutal lives ancestors fought give privilege's for""  


American ancestors fought life hard labor without fair wages, safety living house without give harbor soldiers, quasi-equal treatment usually white people, lack representation institutions created laws represented them, genocide murdering peoples, fight barista got venti mocha latte warm someone asked us wear mask fucking grandpa die.  


An entire generation entitled pricks. first part non sense. That's covid works. second part, yea sure. get that. poor sucks. Well sure interesting read! I‚Äôd quote key passages, it‚Äôd probably get automodded. I'm even bothering hanging anyone-no matter do, somehow covid finds way. believe made educated guess, maybe better explanations 

I say antibody testing early outbreaks showed actual cases 10x higher official numbers. Hopefully better now. 3x seems like good guess many unknown factors really know boyfriend leave ND early April job reasons, Fargo, many places shutting closing early spite actual shutdown orders. 

The last two weeks there, none usual places go food allowed indoor dining, got take since would last time able solicit places long while. crazy us bad things now, definitely visiting home holidays year. :( wonder previous record Saturday/, Sunday mean lower infection risk, course cant always protect 100%. better nothing. cant find right , chinese study well wearers glasses lower chance getting well. country people wore masks corona sick people wouldnt object wearing masks time. kinda makes sense eyes important vector virus well. Well end october lol  Yeah idea why. Seriously. understand people believe numbers know inaccurate read post history. He's one learn live go get Grandma killed types every pregnant teenager swears *always* used birth control. fetish, stop projecting. 
 
Sweden afford tough virtue signaller behind backs Finland Baltics, comes expense solidarity strategies contagious. love comments. would done different fix problem. NC mask mandates 6 months cases still rise. virus viable vaccine nothing done stop 300 million people staying isolated home. IMO, we'd better made less convenient Americans thread getting brigaded daily science deniers conspiracy theorists. think clear anyone half brain need shut again. right, politicians kicking road shit spirals control.  Everything open couple days ago. Well, actually remember closed dance clubs September said thinking it. course strong regulations sports events, always cameras there. Crazy person alert. sure classify similar past pandemics. 1918 initial outbreak eased dramatically summer end first wave, came roaring back vengeance winter months. 2 waves 1919 1920 less severe deadly strains virus died away killed host quickly.

COVID worked way, go away hot weather, tends kill people likely spread (young adults). US we've 2 distinct large regional outbreaks, first northeast second sunbelt, stretching California - Arizona - Texas - Florida.

The current phase different -- current outbreak far widespread includes much rural midwestern territory previously seen big surges localized ones around prisons meat packing plants.

Globally, clear still initial wave -- spread increasing unabated since March 2020 we're close 500K new cases/day. Hi all,

I live gf tested positive Wednesday experiencing symptoms Tuesday. self quarantined room since Tuesday contact (I‚Äôve living room). tested day came back negative. also tested yesterday make sure yet results back. far I‚Äôd say we‚Äôve handling isolation best can.

My question supposed tackle surfaces she‚Äôs touched? high risk touching, say, bathroom stuff door knobs might touched? False positivity rate 0,32%. positivity accuracy, large sample size around 50%. Thats 2 rounds(3 worst hit regions), among things. That‚Äôs point Dr. Michael Osterholm keeps making. Yes, wear mask, says, don‚Äôt let make complacent are.  way expose anyone. see would problem. data almost 200,000 kids 47 states last two weeks September revealed infection rate 0.13 percent among students 0.24 percent among staff. That‚Äôs 1.3 infections two weeks school 1,000 kids, 2.2 infections two weeks group 1,000 staff. Even high-risk areas country, student rates well half percent. sound like need take econ course buddy. making excuse US government unable support people pandemic, foolish. regular times, sure everything saying makes sense. regular times. Money isn‚Äôt backed anything anymore, meaning doesn‚Äôt inherently require good service exchanged put circulation Totally agree, another example number people using VAB (paid time work care sick children) double 2019, highest ever history. children sicker instructed stay home slightest symtoms. Yea, that's immunity works. haunting us years come.  Pfizer Moderna similar timelines. Oxford J&amp;J also restarted US.

And US certainly interest Oxford's, largest preorder US money invested it. thing need get covid 19 survive get Coronavirus antibodies. really want risk biscuit? WHATTTTT worldometer really boring whole summer europe, August surge spain. check daily changes dramatically. that‚Äôs confirmed cases. probably many cases never confirmed. Well, certainly attitude. I'm queens, near epicenter was. 30 mins away times Square train.

Cases increasing see 2nd wave. Manhattan soon see since majority working force queens usually work Manhattan Either two - 

1. went get car's AC fixed. Even though contact fixing it, shop owner took test ride me. wore mask AC full blast 10 mins check. 6 days prior onset symptoms. 

2. got haircut (first 7 months) home. Called barber home, wearing mask gloves sanitized everything. took mask 5 mins (I have) fixed facial hair. 3 days prior onset symptoms. 

I texted test asked get tested ghosted. government isnt contact tracing guess.  president gets vp vp incapacitated, amirite guys? Exactly. probably didn‚Äôt really social life pandemic. MERS contained origin country? Spanish Flu? Ebola? No. origin. contained pretty well considering first major outbreak, sequence genome short time, develop treatment protocols knew nothing virus testing knew asymptomatic rate. Despite this, major cause spread around world. all. one talking origin conspiracy thread. implying done better job containing look objectively hell good job, hence US source spread around world even regions received tons Chinese travellers.

To address initial question first major outbreak identified Wuhan, China. However, fact discovered cases France indicative community transmission around time frame also discovered wastewater Italy also around time frame two cities. Experts also looking southeast Asia true origin. Tldr origin still  data almost 200,000 kids 47 states last two weeks September revealed infection rate 0.13 percent among students 0.24 percent among staff. That‚Äôs 1.3 infections two weeks school 1,000 kids, 2.2 infections two weeks group 1,000 staff. Even high-risk areas country, student rates well half percent.

Same cases identified school settings suggest child child transmission schools uncommon primary cause SARS-CoV-2 infection children whose onset infection coincides period attending school, particularly preschools primary schools.  appropriate physical distancing hygiene measures applied, schools unlikely effective propagating environments occupational leisure settings similar densities people.  conflicting published evidence impact school closure/re-opening community transmission levels, although evidence contact tracing schools, observational data number EU countries suggest re-opening schools associated significant increases community transmission.  evidence also indicates closures childcare educational institutions unlikely effective single control measure community transmission COVID-19 closures would unlikely provide significant additional protection children‚Äôs health, since develop mild form COVID-19, any.

 Albeit concede schools may underestimated children often asymptomatic thus less tested. nytimes really good map  It‚Äôs one giant wave fuelled stupidity I‚Äôve seen many call ‚ÄúWave 1: phase 3‚Äù also test results late work week. They'll likely dip bit Monday Tuesday, come roaring back.

That's want use 7-day averages meaningful numbers, there's weekly cycle numbers.

...not helps much. LolüòÇüíØ Extremely. pneumonia need hospital care get it, death rates rise.

The cfr falling better hospital treatment protocols. hospitals full....

Utah says need ration care within two weeks 

Wuhans mortality bad partly know treat partly hospitals full.

Pneumonia something fuck around with.

Iirc hospitalization rate 5-10% covid. without medical care unlikely would die, cfr would likely double triple least. Yes, another thing separates Sweden countries pretty big part population spring vacation Iran, Austria Italy corona getting big Europe. Southern Sweden spring break one week dodged outbreak could big reason situation better Enjoy stupidity mention person voting going country. election day boot coming up. Due pointless lockdown effect stopping virus spread either, delays surge. Deaths lagging indicators guess need see month. What??????? It‚Äôs scary, isn‚Äôt it? ü§® Well, guy clearly never took Macro 101. Shhhhh, can't argue someone thinks Fauci represents authority. 

In seriousness though, vaccines wheelhouse people experienced him. word holds way weight others regard. would true Trump isn‚Äôt president? He‚Äôs one basically saying survival fittest. wasn‚Äôt president, maybe there‚Äôd LESS mindset. frustrating basically politicians essentially unwilling roll back reopening. least wait anything election. run away train brakes. see anyone altering course states currently risk. That's lot assumptions based two comments. see wanting locked understanding little risk Covid means lack empathy. take precautions get others sick. Please less judgemental. GOP talking points? No. need take Econ 101. Really, death fetish boils resentment conscription?

Seek professional help man. Same. pathetic people WANT government lock up. Stay inside scared, don‚Äôt demand participate cowardice. favorite name I've heard Kim Jong Dan. Hopefully announces something Tuesday like said would worry okay, always friend need gather children send non voluntary stay camp months /s True, it‚Äôs statistic, needs considered saying truly worse... 2 cents. believe infected people running around need identified hopefully right thing stay away others. believe testing getting smarter targeted before, allowing increase confirmed cases relative daily deaths. good thing. virus joke! issue economy country, virus gonna kill many people destroy many jobs.  also really trust statistics china puts think need start using casualties.

Dead/disabled/severely impacted. number covid casualties dwarf dead.  (Inbox replies disabled don‚Äôt see people acting like overweight means deserve die.) Phase 1.3 good way describe it. time single phase actually subsided close starting point phase. can't really say ever even overcame single wave. 

And phases therefore starting already heightened place community spread even frightening. Public policy mostly determined states tell covid strategy good (according reddit):

Good strategy: low prevalence covid beginning. close borders som sort lockdown, right circumstances contact tracing testing keeping numbers low. See example New Zealand.

Bad strategy: Swedens, read think piece article containing third hand informationen anectodes. said Sweden strategy also actively killed elderly.

Irrelevant strategys: strategies besides Nordic ones New Zealands. can't compare Spain country like that. actual evidence back claim speculating? think it‚Äôs hoax, there‚Äôs nothing susceptible to. Honey get offended, I'm American. (It's even dig, whole ""I'm offended"" concept American).

Body positivity joke hides behind concept would think means there's beauty every body. really motto trying pretend overweight woman healthy, fuck everybody else.

Just doctor low standard polite say anything else giving participation medal exercise department make right. Standing shift alone like many jobs require burn ten times that.

You would gaining weight ate even caloric intake already much. eating 4000 calories day stabilize 300lbs mean eating right way gaining weight. Nobody saying get cube cheese diet. caloric intake point, would slowly surely get healthier range weight. 

It's really strange mental gymnastic pretend calorie intake good weight stable. work way.

Edit : yes, walking day already makes big difference... compare nothing all. low standard. scary today tested people reflect infection dynamic week ago. what? Life comes grounding halt Americans? long? manufacturing deliveries? Money means nothing logistics don‚Äôt work. Even funded, trust funds dried long ago. Meanwhile Gov DeathSentence Fl discussing releasing daily numbers tsunami point... token goods services rendered? Lol 

Parroting GOP talking points cool, country completely collapses see real looting violence. Stop living bubble. Every advanced society plan place support citizens. point government ""every man himself"" crisis? 

And economy work people money spend ""goods services"". say problem much Danes went Sweden. wonder say that? literally visiting higher-level infections country returning home. 
 
I literally wrote problem coming Sweden. stayed Sweden would problem Denmark countries. 
That school example shows problems quite well. 
 
Yes, different levels border permeability point whatever restrictions border imposed neighboring countries, Sweden.

Zero Sympathy. want one helmets much cost see Colorado really cold right true. hand, CFR go resources staff overtaxed ICUs, worse, care denied due hospital overcrowding. I'm sure tons variables, constantly changing, pull rate down. none much simpler point: fewer tests earlier exaggerated CFR compared now. testing robust, we'll start get better understanding.

It's almost need. No, I'm you. sure questions downvoted, they're viable questions. viral load affect symptoms? quick search reveals article says but, less viral load, less infectious are, somehow. interesting see actual studies this.

In context article, assume masks would prevent viral load. (This article recent, in-depth study terms viral load well, science different types masks. cannot find one say masks prevent infection. conclusion masks prevent viral load, infection. Less viral load makes less infectious limits Masks may still limit probability infected, can't find viable source. Hopefully, someone supply information.

March/April lockdowns quite successful allowed people live fairly normal summer. inevitable cases would rise again, governments slow implement new measures. time, people lax sticking guidelines.

On side government, little political reintroduce restrictions rolling back 2 months earlier. side people, pandemic fatigue kicked stopped scared disease.

On top that, unproven, suspected environmental conditions. respiratory viruses spread much easily cold weather. Whether true SARS-CoV-2 yet determined, there's little reason assume would different coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, influenzaviruses, etc... cases started spike weather shifted, quite rapidly, warm dry cold wet. Restaurants make wear mask seated what's point? Makes sense essential workers, instance. Vaccines may lessen severity illness too. forgot /s tag.  people think illegally entering US jaywalking wearing mask even less problem. tru yo Sports. one kid team gets sick whole team quarantine.

I feel like idiot, I‚Äôve always seriously struggling like suicidally depressed last couple weeks really needed blow steam meal could enjoy couple drinks. Lol know even close thing requiring someone wear face covering comply federal law. Seems like places suburbs operating full capacity. feeling might change soon Can‚Äôt see article, keeping flat, especially folks Orange County won‚Äôt wear masks? prediction Trump wins , Biden wins think 250.000 tops thats much I‚Äôd suggest reading news Reddit that‚Äôs thought. yet cases Arizona going bare minimum Courthouse wedding guests.

We're kind saying thing. thousands upon thousands small churches good pastors nothing friendly people. sub likes say Christians delusional, selfish bloodsuckers. I've told things called names multiple times Christian. Wait, time USA tell (and tell mean creat law) citizens wear mask public? Death rate still far lower spring. don‚Äôt know come conclusions.

That stop generalizing people disagree getting information media companies.

Why can't assume assert generalized entire time family two steps ahead virus official recommendations state media.

Let guess.... Everyone dumb you?

I've never seen reddit before... Whoa, straw man much? argue anything said, slow roll fella.

Plenty people China elsewhere (not America) bought private tests. pointing out, uniquely American dystopian thing. fucked lot shit up, let's focu fuckups rather making ones up, ok? They're convincing they're factual...  do, lot don't. get virus often. even shows statistics. primarily spread private events. group get special treatment refused follow rules put us danger? hear Texas lots churches ministers ""are powerful Lord"". let pray away virus. I'll even send donation money ones prove much ""the Lord them""! Yeah seems like in-person school self-selects families likely covid. still six months winter get through. 

Lots countries ""doing well"" summer. say governments fine adjusting demands pandemic.
It‚Äôs failure certain countries governments government general. thought Europeans much smarter stupid Americans control?  mean, bump might calm folks down. I'm aware, big problem people understanding extent death along. Yes terrible big holidays really cold weather forcing everybody inside poorly ventilated rooms.

Winter 2020 covid hell states. There‚Äôs plenty individual kids died covid. could link dozens articles going way back February Wuhan. Yeah, no, get it! speaking specifically idea Biden might weather better we'd think. immunity** (also called **herd effect**, **community immunity**, **population immunity**, **social immunity**) form indirect protection disease occurs sufficient percentage population become infection, whether previous infections, thereby reducing likelihood infection individuals lack immunity.

Herd immunity *through infections* work COVID-19. Herd immunity *through vaccination* will. people praise criticize ""herd immunity"" usually refer *herd immunity infection* gives term herd immunity bad name. end everyone wants herd immunity; matter cost. Personally still lean towards backwater area Yunnan, seems conducive environment, including bat caves. Although I'm expert rule anything out. 

The problem antigen tests seems time problem. Already almost year maybe many people enough antibodies left come anything conclusive. Oh shit. Oh shit well whole 18 000 Yes it‚Äôs sooooooo risky. 99% survivalrate age group point lockdown would **possibly** worse practical sense.

If actually question, lockdown way go. probably better use term ‚Äúsocial Darwinian‚Äù, since natural selection term relates changes evolutionary timespan, thousands years per unit. Tried move Australia covid. Really wish worked lol Schools. one beautiful moment almost forgot Brexit thing. Many would die getting reinfected doesn‚Äôt seem anymore common viruses yet likely share something. Look details case provided here. know people get infected China Korea, initial small transmission timeline study first German cases, looked hundreds Western studies now.

All rest mere speculation, T√∂nnies Heinsberg studies especially disappointing lack inspiration, creativity academic rigor. Australia actually 27.5k total cases think significant part ‚ÄúCovid fatigue‚Äù. People around world simply sick hearing it, even though logical thing adhere mandates help lower risks transmission, people thinking short term.

Being impulsive rebellious might feel good short term it‚Äôs going prolong even more. Like post said, reduced chance catching 30% also reduced viral load get sick. perfect solution, also socially distanced, provide protection greater protection would otherwise received. Nope. ""Free market'll sort out"" Deaths trail cases, know? Like... People die day catch corona. Give 3 weeks..
 Deaths spike again.

Death bad outcome. cases see, worse economic outcome. People lose jobs, etc.

Medical bankruptcy pretty common country... horrific healthcare system. healthcare attached employer, stupid that. Lose job, lose healthcare. test like crazy? keep increasing cases matter test not, testing help all. right, March April, October, way worse, get better next summer. least article facts straight. think confirmed symptomatic people assymptomatic people realized getting friends family sick. could still 100k people day assymptomatic know get tested. less got states acting like it‚Äôs blown over, spending aid funding ONE commercial promoting tourism another state wants spend aid fracking.....stay classy America. /s (/s last part) here, pinhead gov. Nothing done right way pandemic look, death zone worried fracking. Good job ND protecting people. Positivity rate peaks, going since beginning month: 

Excess mortality still [10% (note excess mortality rate actually accurate 1 month delay, number past 3 weeks inevitably rise mortality). Still sure I‚Äôm getting downvotes innocent question. republic representatives hear hear people tired virus focus want jobs makes sense. increase polarizing society, guess terms female roles we're seeing everything else. covid affects though, economic situation imagine play bigger role long term - headed way anyway. happens pandemic sped quite bit(or probably anyway), pandemic willl trigger, cause own. 

I said started, pandemic go history huge trigger event kind social economic upheavels(of course social world much impacted influences economic situation system people live under). People go 2020 worst year ever, think 2020 prequel expect coming years decades. dread think manipulations people fall terms reponsible economic situation answers are(but already know 100% happen happening already awhile now). right walking Berlin city center police powerless. Police watching shit show minimum forces. Yeah thanks. Lies Cool 6 months go. cancelled Thanksgiving event home annually, family nice still wanted plans Mother Law said host instead. 

Then Colorado tightened restriction gatherings 10 people TWO households. usual brings five households together, even us declining four. mandate expires couple days Thanksgiving now, I'm trying warn extended spend money stuff.  Really? Let‚Äôs see source? least describe background/qualifications? talking communist countries Great means herd immunity. think understood context. saying heard news like, tomorrow, would reasonably good news. means whole bunch people got it, never even knew, death rate massively stated.

The issue he's understanding context fact, we'll hear news death rate massively higher already. assuming never get again.

If make 2 huge failures logic, makes perfect sense. Ohhhh. Lmao. According news article read part Stanford University, 10% Americans tested positive antibodies. 230,000 deaths. mean spreads 70% 80% looking millions dead? likely antibodies last long 10% American population actually already infected? East Asia bought lie? well makes much sense...thanks It‚Äôs true response might different killing people ages like Spanish flu. giving data help point Depends ... 95% negative people genuinely thought covid forced take weekly test get back work ? asymptomatics.
There clear link positive rate ratio detected cases vs real cases, varies lot culture (some consider mandatory tested risky situation etc...) can't really use numbers one country another imagine dating general barren desert moment, unless anti-maskers. going away folks. never said kind bend going around... world scarcity, disproportionate allocation scarce resources fundamental. Past attempts remediate, often different forms governance, demonstrate empirically likely irremediable. uncomfortable truth, like many things life. Currently Summer Spring peaks, going again. \*asian countries Hell no! Yup, also look charge task force, Pence. Pence, seemingly running task force herd immunity strategy. IMO, came stated strategy. strategy, everything shut essential work, concerted effort would going protect people? 

What's going on, POV, idea ""hail mary pass"" hoping herd immunity work. think intentionally saying one thing, actively enforcing tactic. think one said something Sweden working out. working Sweden, regret it. 

Winter going savage. USA USA USA faith/trust leadership. Cite ‚Äúcomprehensive‚Äù study then. nomenclature tells likely haven‚Äôt clue you‚Äôre talking about. imma let stay. It‚Äôs improvement. go look see pretty sure baby everybody I'm one would seem statistically unlikely.

Most US spikes continue private gatherings, religious idiots, certain demographic people believe masks. agree, BMI doesnt work literally every single person world, Bodybuilders normally BMI that's Overweight even obese category, let's real, average person isnt anywhere near bodybuilder level muscle.

So yes, using BMI good way figure estimated % people actually overweight obese. pretend want rational discussion. pretend you‚Äôre looking facts. it‚Äôs nothing else. sane person would discount every Scandinavian country done least 5 times better Sweden. People gotten re-infected worse symptoms first time. change mind authorities change policy. pretend always knew masks work. one think fine plan. Every state follow suit. fracking state donate money military industrial complex since always need more. question masks. better: cloth face masks medical like polypropylene masks? Stop hitting America. Wow what. canada masks pretty much required school work (with work done home business capability.) constant testing. think there‚Äôd lot less people overall.... get I‚Äôm going that. haha schools one wants say schools would get lynched politically. change policy countries turn purple also. AFAIK China place situation like immediately test everybody isolate positive, beat down.

In country Denmark, 2 cases say school, test entire school find cases - send home pupils figure contact, miss freak infections 15 year old kid gave 7 year kid played football together whatever. can‚Äôt ask questions around don‚Äôt like ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è There's much Sweden's position WW2 simple quote even Wikipedia page convene.

However, need wait two weeks see death rates match current upward trend. Right tells us two weeks ago. need one shot 2? plain EVIL. EVERYTHING run mining execs there? It‚Äôs insulting it‚Äôs truth. Curious whether got shot protection covid? husband went Rite Aid got MMR beginning August heard could protect covid. husband early 60‚Äôs late 50‚Äôs figured least would protect us measles. wonder need get second shot. Yeah, complete lockdown 2 weeks away suspect. Maybe already next Sunday. Probably lying. India's poor population contact government except get extorted judges police officers. cases recorded among poor.

I sincerely doubt Dalits even allowed enter Covid testing centre, example. That's 200 million Indians right there. Republicans do! Tegnell followed available science. apart Asian countries mask wearing already daily practice years, country time recommended it.

And interesting use Ebola example poor attempt discredit person responsible limiting 1995 Ebola outbreak Zaire leading work it.

Tegnell random beaurocrat dragged streets. one world's leading epidemiologists leading global work curbing infectious diseases decades. Uhm no. It‚Äôs literally parents aren‚Äôt getting sick children tested. That‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt SEEM like problem. forget children poor insurance. can‚Äôt afford test definitely can‚Äôt afford miss work. deliberately faking studies make trump look bad

Well, one study definitely faked (i.e. Surgisphere Lancet, called citing incorrect stats Australia refused share data). Another study gave patients toxic doses HCQ, either utter incompetence study designers purposeful show HCQ harmful. that's two studies.

I idea motivation malfeasance is, certainly legitimate research.

For record, single well designed study show HCQ useful Covid either, that... nursing homes already Covid patients. take ambulance runs it‚Äôs uncommon hear ‚Äú86 year old male, housed Covid unit, coming shortness breath‚Äù it‚Äôs already there. can‚Äôt keep people hospital weeks time.

First, many people entire family livelihood state. easy even worth many move political reasons alone compared that. Many farmers would leave basically inheritance, family, job/life love. Further, there's reason basically every border city Minnesota bigger ND side - taxes everything else cost living cheaper ND side time.

Even still, perhaps biggest problem can't expect real change occur everyone different political views moves away separates. Instead, liberal, encouraging like-minded people stay even move help make changes instead making even echo chamber no-one dissent important issues. Fuck truly starting feel like I'm irrational one trying safe side. seriously starting question reality right now. Depends location. I'd consider wave 2 NJ since fairly well one point state declines cases consecutive weeks. see. appreciate clarification, think others too. can‚Äôt imagine anyone would disagree. 

All trying say think original comment thread saw downvotes ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù times COVID unfortunately become synonymous ‚Äúlet everyone get sick‚Äù.

But again, thanks clarifying. (: hope good day friend...good luck best. Ear loop = mask

Super sketchy.

I like kidneys much ready part yet. chip in, lick rats. According Wikipedia NZ first case Feb 28th go level 3 lockdown March 23th already 102 confirmed cases

In Ireland first case Feb 29th went lockdown equivalent NZ level 3 12th March 70 cases (and last day office March 6th). 

Fact early response broadly similar, NZ got lucky whatever reason community spread really taken hold stage like Europe (and presumably fuck nursing homes like Ireland) good question...

Honestly things would lot better could get someone crack it‚Äôs election year ain‚Äôt happening.

There‚Äôs articles stating Covid circulating Europe/China early last October/November. first case US January 2020. freedumb! don‚Äôt get this. 

There chance, albeit small one child catches covid inflammatory response need ICU end lung damage. Children.. entire lives ahead damage virus avoid catching keeping home.

Yes it‚Äôs hard times, wished could go back school. locked bathroom cried felt like hurting children‚Äôs development one occasion. want nothing go outside play say no, yet.

I love children dearly would never forgive caught put back school got hurt. don‚Äôt understand called moms would hide cases. They‚Äôre little disappointment. democrats win fault? ""we looking 30,0000,000+ dead US"" 

300 million lot deaths. many people arguing masks. doubt another lockdown Go ahead, get whole state repopulate free. There's probably lot cost-benefit analysis behind this. E.g., costs country ‚Ç¨500 billion hard shutdown destroys hospitality industry, ‚Ç¨200 billion institute half-measures allow disease spread running ICUs 80% capacity hundred thousand old people die, government probably going choose latter. I'm trying say ""herd immunity"" ""let everyone get sick"" thing. One side says ""let everyone get sick achieve herd immunity"" side says ""let everyone get vaccinated achieve herd immunity."" Herd immunity everyone's goal, method reached contested. know, make loud declaration ""over it"" ""ready get back normal"" ignore rules benefit others right thing. indication contexts people getting virus? restaurants, schools, church, gyms, outside? prevalent responsible case growth? guess helpful verify scientific predictions take necessary precautions prevent get worse.

And far, scientists mostly right. people listened earlier, things get better sooner. I've long today, read last portion comment ""it hard get fucked""

Yesterday, 16%. government asked volunteers vaccine testing, signed up. point, care grow third fucking arm head, means end shit. [Look daily new cases 
Rt 1 Sweden, spring. Sweden losing control, spring. 
 Well, Denmark, fit narrative. 
 
Denmark higher population density. Denmark (and neighboring countries) led Sweden also early phase 1st wave. 
Over past 2 weeks Denmark even Sweden. 
 Norway, Finland selected Balkan countries worse. 
 
That's Baltic you. 
And selection based assumed amount usual travel countries. Stockholm Helsinki Tallinn quite connected, ferries air travel. lesser extent also Latvia. Lithuania somewhat less connected Sweden. 
 Fine, focus Rt. Damnit, Sweden actually worse others either. 
 
Neither initial phase 1st wave. Sweden better either. 
 Oh shit, even ones want compare spinning talking stricter measures again. 
 
And measures countries regain control faster Sweden. time 4 extra winter months Sweden cope with. 
 sub sort fetish wishing people would dying Sweden, unfortunately fetish fulfilled. 
 
No, problem Sweden Tegnell whitewashing strategy hopes countries would take over. 
Just dropping mandatory conscription. Citizens neighboring countries like virtue signaling. Good luck  Someone linked paper [in think Back April, vaccine 12-18 months away.

Paraphrasing, he's saying around December 1, means he's halved amount time estimated April.

That, estimation, makes uber-conservative. agree completely. son's (9) soccer club continued practices games like nothing happened. son stopped playing back March return over. ""solution"" limit contact soccer clubs (how help?). Many parents upset team local scrimmages playing clubs. I'm paying hundreds dollars infect kid possibly whole family fucking soccer. one ignoring data, people simply analysing it. look cases Sweden accelerating march-april clear Swedens covid spread larger neighbours. Low spread countries Finland much larger possibility get control spread faster. large hit countries can't keep testing spread tracking way. Look att example really hard hit countries UK Spain - tooks months even hard lockdown.

You course compare things nordic countries good argue Sweden copied them. ridiciouls assess success different strategies looking death per million. cold today! dog yard means walking around green lake anyways. Yep. Everyone called two weeks ago.

Third, everybody knows vaccine mean ends next day regular folks getting Spring optimistic Deaths three 9/11's per day inside month.

Lol working office, that's March 2020 Fucking pissed pretty well. bet schools. mention news local outbreaks completely suppressed!

source: relatives China. China never claimed virus-free country. That's keep regular testing find hidden cases. problems? fuck talking about?

Only 6 positive cases quarantined infection rate 0.01%. federal response spearheaded Trump administration expansive expensive. early Trump convening coronavirus task force, Pelosi handing impeachment pens. Trump restricted international travel, press politicians calling xenophobic. People say hindsight, ""If locked earlier!"" forget Fauci said February 29th Americans change behavior. Multiple relief packages signed. federal government forced General Motors make ventilators. 

Where federal government faltered early little Trump administration would tripped president due customary way things country. [Reuters reported ""administration President Donald Trump tripped government rules conventions, former officials public health experts say. Instead drafting private sector early develop tests, South Korea did, U.S. health officials relied, customary, test kits prepared U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention, proved faulty. Then, sticking time-consuming vetting procedures, U.S. Food Drug Administration didn‚Äôt approve tests CDC‚Äôs Feb. 29, five weeks discussions outside labs begun.""

Any president would listened experts familiar process would experienced problems. 

States handled mask mandates types behavior-modifying restrictions. best level that. enforced, necessary, local level. 50 states rights reserved states, country's spirit impose sweeping federal mandates every little thing. 50 states broad differences attitudes, beliefs values. 

Countries amenable tighter restrictions better worse. appear consensus X country bad country well. Countries everything right still second wave. countries little came badly countries. secretive countries trust assessments did, countries poor record keeping know sure did.

Plenty done unlikely president would done better based country always been. Yup. knew White House settled herd immunity strategy...and withholding federal aid, forcing it.

It‚Äôs easier working getting kids involved. three older kids boys I‚Äôm trying get clean rooms. know sounds bad, housekeeper cleaning. since March I‚Äôm training clean least pick themselves, vacuum, bring laundry laundry fold etc. baby steps!! Sadly completely agree. agencies let us big time. Probably good people already quit ones left smooth brained koolaid drinkers part plan, top Trump administration official wanted Santa performers promote benefits Covid-19 vaccination and, exchange, offered early vaccine access ahead general public, according audio recordings. perform Mrs. Claus elves also would included....
  
That sounds crazy 'kind of' get reasoning But.. respond. anything substance, know none. still did.

The hypocrisy stunning though. 

Blocked. Yet NYC avoiding least postponing new spike now. Flu people wearing masks, washing hands, avoiding contact, especially sick. flu less contagious Covid-19 measures take significantly reduce influenza infections. 

It's spiking fall, expected, spike seen countries too. Vaccinating entirely wrong, they'd still spread smearing corona one children lap. also asthma even harder tell Based posted assumed don‚Äôt wear mask. probably right won‚Äôt admit it. 

75 deaths 75 many. Doesn‚Äôt matter percentage. Attitudes like enabling virus get another foothold winter. Slowing past spring way kept death percentage getting high. new cases start outpace healthcare system‚Äôs ability treat patients symptoms, death rate climb. 75 pale comparison.

Edit: it‚Äôs already happening explained regional uniform.

But US unified political entity also viewed perspective, public policy primary determinant virus proliferates. 80s? Really?

I expecting volnerable group like get vaccine, current test populations. Trump: ""We rounding turn.""

Half Mike Pence's team contracts it.

Mark Meadows: going control ""because contagious virus like flu."" (It gone pandemic endemic, handling.)

Don Trump: ""We rounding corner."" Good job, conservatives. America's death cult.  much higher positivity rate. situation likely worse unfortunate truth many aren‚Äôt willing discuss, really.

The whole ordeal country really pathetic consider political become.

And one even agree virus real not; swear people Dark Ages sense people rotting inside plagues hit.

God forbid plague magnitude today. million dead Americans. reap sow.... Yeah, masks work. government stated true PPE gear works, that's reserved medical personnel. stated non medical masks, also offer protection. government stubborn Ragweed sufferer too. Every September starts start daily Zyrtec Flonase. something deal every fall think you‚Äôll know difference allergies covid. Covid symptoms resemble flu symptoms. flu B January obvious wasn‚Äôt allergy flare up. Yeah, could specific defining healthy eating--there misconception healthy eating is. actually eat much, Im actively lowering caloric intake lose weight. eating ""too much"" would slowly gaining weight. gained extra weight two pregnancies. 

I classify walking day exercise, doctor did! actually discussion him. terms overall health walking day still makes difference, even calorie fat burning way--I would assume BP would higher habit. told important continue. 

I've thin long period life before, mystery me. 

Everyone gets offended idea body positivity, funny. 

Not even said. Please go back read words. Obesity healthy. Exactly. also encourage children report violations masks unauthorized gathering people either teachers police fine hold accountable. Maybe even give mask unauthorized gatherings violations jail time? US cases one day countries total year. Haha, okay, glad you‚Äôve clarified aren‚Äôt taken seriously. yet still here. Stupid old man lol spell disaster Sacrifice. middle tsunami meant didnt want grouped people didnt believe virus big deal even real matter. social distancing listening experts since March. Quarantine always voluntary Nordics, since legal obligation know sick, far understand, enforcement. One cases reported bunch students went organized (not school, students) trip Sweden, returned days school (Denmark person classes already, end May maybe?), became known this, sick, entire school went back remote learning tagged lot people contact them.

Earlier Malm√∂ describing rather weird behavior large portion people attending sport activities indoor (climbing clubs, etc) danish people, traveling able that.

You say problem much Danes went Sweden. wonder say that? literally visiting higher-level infections country returning home. Spead like butter Excellent article that, showing transparency. Trump caught it, Biden already tested fairly regularly. Since came-out Trump tried hide Whitehouse outbreak, became apparent probably would tried hide case started showing symptoms, Biden's campaign announced would release test result. way know Biden's negative, catches able hide we'll either get test know something's test result released day. know third wave worse second, far worse first, cases peaked 9.7 per 100,000 April 7.

The US 2nd wave (assuming even call different waves - I'm sure first one really finished yet unlike Europe) cases, less deaths. 

The first dip deaths finished around early July, deaths first wave would continued that, that's somewhere 130-150,000 deaths. total, there's around 230,000 meaning somewhere 80-100,000 linked second - start 3rd - wave.

It's highly likely lot cases 3rd/4th/nth waves US winter, certainly possible deaths period far. But, like predictions, far early state ""We know third wave worse second"" Depends region. Trying define wave huge area uniform mistake Feels like people recent years Well sound like one superb comunication skills. king yet....god knows he's trying though See that's wondering .. China imagine there's ""news"" there's actual news probably harder honest investigative journalist US vast country, geographically dispersed.

Virus arrival dates vary widely across country, differences timing regional policies impacted spread.

It's fair say US regions localities one wave.  whole, US ongoing virus dispersion since January really began gain traction March.  specifics consistent.  soon. Yeah, state afford another shutdown without major amount federal help, happen. idea motivation malfeasance is,

You regurgitating rightwing talk radio zero evidence claims


Hence cant link proof agree. stuff kids division labor since stay home mom works full-time, that‚Äôs goes. Kiwis ! insane. I‚Äôve holed months months COVID worse ever been. point it‚Äôs hard wonder we‚Äôll ever get rid I‚Äôm wasting time isolating. Spaniard , success last word pop head last 8 months. Unless mean Spanish translations (√©xito, suceso) used mean death medical parlance. 

Where get idea? Onion‚Äôs really getting creative articles. needs informed criticism ain't seeing lot of.

Almost everyone complaing Sweden still stuck April. Sweden Italy high death rates early lowered considerably several months? one countries constantly gets past thrown face. family baptism multiple different families attending next weekend. tell can‚Äôt go it‚Äôs like told go hell something. gf nurse. closer proximity covid positive people 99% population hasn‚Äôt gotten it. 

How could be? Perhaps fact she‚Äôs fully PPE‚Äôd time perhaps? Masks work * COVID fatigue
* Politicizing things
* Schools back session
* Fewer lockdowns
* Surge midwest
* Colder parts country
* Upcoming winter shopping, combo stockpiling seasonal shopping
* Possibly increased access testing? that, perhaps similar levels infection earlier year, getting test like finding $100 bill ground. messaging CDC masks bullshit too. told US wear early political pressure keep enough masks healthcare workers.

But messaging should‚Äôve clear beginning. don‚Äôt need n95. Save hospitals. Use cotton masks. End story.  anti-pandemic-measurements protests. german slang anti-corona protests. Sounds like try yell scare virus away, yup; really protest government's actions pandemic. protests infiltrated kinds far-right/neo-nazi/freeman/tinfoil groups. italy no. think island going much difference-maker early stages. countries closed borders cases community spread; like new infections coming hordes people sneaking land borders. Also borders open, cases largely introduced international flights, island make lot difference. probably impact country low international traffic general. [That's good news, sir, really announce locked Ireland numbers Italy bound go up. next weekend likely control Oh yeah trust poll lying eyes think lot legal system many work extremely unresponsive situation challenges standard procedure, lots jurisdictions cannot guarantee safety anyone courtroom going back physical trials half assed safety procedures everyone knows won‚Äôt work. large portion sub sees report single person dying immediately downvote go rage without understand context. hate coming here, give decent source Covid news. Oh snap. bad. little sleep defense! suck even now. traveling New Hampshire. fair motto, saw everyone NH wearing mask, distant, using sanitizer, etc. important all, believe COVID actually real. 

Then returning shithole Deep South top ten infection state, two-thirds see wear masks, distance. fact, claim virus hoax; infection numbers sure argue logic here. like making middle aged people realize age get sad, funny especially put fight prove much mind age lol Cases mean anything without proper context. That's CDC looks percent positive, hospitalization rate, percent deaths, etc get good picture whats goin on. reason seeing cases ever testing ever. scaled testing level back March, daily count would ~10x we're seeing went positivity rate ~2%.

These numbers discussed. sad sub hoists click-bait articles tabloid websites political purposes. clear, triage guidelines intended followed hospitals capacity (that never happened). actually used happened still question many ongoing investigations trying determine were. 

The BMI 40 comes early study suggested people overweight increased risk virus. later shown risk factor. true Nothing, free healthcare here. 

Whats wrong you? Yea, Pfizer stated:

""So let clear, assuming positive data, Pfizer apply Emergency Authorization Use U.S. soon safety milestone achieved third week November."" think jack russells getting tired walking room explaining things aswell. Soon may ignore together. Update Italy 2020-10-25

NOTE: Calabria reports 179 new positive cases today, 3 identified migrant subjects. I'm going visit 69-year-old dad first time year, driving (about 8 hours) staying couple nights. hardly goes out, though girlfriend comes lot. I'm going covid test quarantine week driving there. We're going wear masks inside, though. makes furious. dreadful situation. Yet, selfish people refuse wear mask acknowledge dangers damages virus. Disgusting.  Yeah, agree. Sweden deserve criticism number dead, needs informed criticism ain't seeing lot of. 

Ultimately fact simply we're still long way vaccinations commonplace enough drastically affect COVID-19 spreads, regardless anybody comes issue simply soon tell. waves confusing, know third wave, know still first wave either. thought brief respite revving true second wave. care responding? probably declining every invite, actually shaping nice quiet holiday season. Nightclubs open summer. Dumb question, referring unfunded mandates? impression funded mandate via one relief bills. absolutely ridiculous this. Fracking though villainous people make be. good planet? No, worse normal mining. 

A state caring Rona. already desensitized, ridiculous.. Well, that's unexpectedly high mortality rate. Hey ""were"" walk abound Hoboken Jersey city, know pandemic. wrong you?  Increasing reinfection cases meaning tiny number proven reinfections?

The test masses, comes back negative, likely mean person enough antibodies donate convalescent plasma. might take longer die Yap. don‚Äôt care. We‚Äôre fucked He's not. always hear athletes bodybuilder example. funnily enough everytime heard someone pretending BMI BS, someone clearly obese. they're giving up? Unacceptable. know already give up, literally admit disgusting. literally implied it. 
have compassion. Check graph. Flu like illnesses usually start ramping week 44. Let hope like Hong Kong mask wearing bends curve hard.


  starters, wouldn‚Äôt call 1% effective all. That‚Äôs much large margin. 
Secondly, could give source that? wanting start argument, wanting gain information. 
I‚Äôd assume would take account things like (like person said) mask handling, amount time you‚Äôre contact someone, whether anyone‚Äôs coughing, etc. 1% chance every time come contact someone? Every hour spend together? 15 minutes? 
Last heard CDC revised guidance social distance even wearing mask. USA winning! USA first! Montana. Sorry can‚Äôt put location title. Well, Donny certainly won‚Äôt it, even loses, Joe won‚Äôt power least January. expect winter pretty ugly, don‚Äôt see possibility federal lockdown it‚Äôs basically over. Passengers may even know they're scanned. look like fever, immediately snatched street confined hospital 10-14 days whether want go not. exceptions.

Do source Chinese government policy? simply anecdotes odd case there, evidence government policy. 

In America, example, police officers killed black suspects arrest. would silly conclude US government policy simply based isolated incidents. toooooo Back May desperately tried explain concept fish husky. there‚Äôs whole entire world wet thing bowl, animals live there, don‚Äôt legs never ‚Äúwalked‚Äù. acted fish swim everything. avoided like 3 days that. ""Terapie intensive e ricoveri"" see number ICUs hospitalisations also ""Il trend di terapie intensive e ricoveri"", see trend ICUs, hospitalisations people isolation   better nasal rinse Listerine. everything make sure confirmation goes forward schedule. Disgusting Droplet linger longer cold, less vitamin lack sunlight, people grouping indoors....basically factors flu....

....including one cares get pass on. Everyone seems burnt feel like since Trump fine big deal. Well, obviously they‚Äôre saving us getting autism microchipped China flu hoax. need act bold decisively 5G activates chips. 

/s public. ‚ÄúYou walk office, you‚Äôll see judge sitting right there. There‚Äôs barrier.‚Äô‚Äô 

This happening... Many court systems states figured conduct business via Zoom telephone conferences early on. highly doubt *literally* pulling opinions butt. Sunday reduced testing. numbers good all. Wow, really goes show seriously taking compared elder ass lol  Bruh fucking close, jesus Christ. based getting covid first time mention many people life altering consequences die im months symptoms covid like clots.

Also source adequate.

If cdc link mac daily. won't.. statistics side fine act like bubble long sight mind hundreds people dying daily inconsequential live Netherlands people give fucks. 

There's mandatory mask wearing public places, still maybe 1/5 people see store refuse wear mask. hear people still holding parties shit, there's rule 3 people congregate one place. ridiculous.

I get Dutch much personal freedoms, live care-free life style, shit, unacceptable. 

I wish cop check-out aisle big stores fining every person wear mask. They'd probably able use money off-set tax money going support companies struggling due covid.  Shocked! People need Betty Croker cook book. Bunch twats. Stay home wear masks.

Edit: Cook. LOL ever thing high school teacher decides side argument stand make groups? could see people getting really riled even though didn‚Äôt viewpoint stand it?

This America pandemic. group selected whether consider liberal conservative. went 38 200.

Obviously good thing since cancel elective care facilities. Yeah, I‚Äôm surprised responses too. feel like fairly simple straightforward point making. Thanks understanding. Trump's king, throne. Holy shit. Nearly two percent population got it?? always knew ""H"" ""Hasidic"" silent! healthcare staffing resources taken regional level Sweden, although national guidelines suggest elderly patients, whether state privately run care homes, automatically taken hospital treatment.

In BBC article linked. treat people pat back saying could. fuck-ups, lack specialists administer oxygen instance (again, per article), even somewhat controversial prognosis ain't good extending amount time they're strategy, aware it, since you‚Äôre praising it. 

I aware strategy yes, I'm always bit confused people pretend countries dramatically different strategies. estimation countries strategy, different ways implementing opted minimum, voluntary measures. proven lead ten times higher death count Norway. 

I gotta say interesting math study linked says peak number hospitalizations Denmark (Norway) would 133 (231) percent higher, peak number ICU patients would increased 107 (140) percent.

I'm sure well-educated 10 times higher would 1000%, 231%. Even study cited says actually read model also predicts 466 percent increase deaths, discussed refrain interpreting number causally due presence pre-trends.

You might wanna stop hyperbolic, exactly helpful. end eventually. Probably. Yeah, effect noon time bar binges, college parties...

Logic needs start somewhere China hasnt. found 137 cases. see daily case numbers America, like 2nd 3rd wave stacking top still first wave.

You also see trough (The lowest point wave) 2nd 3rd higher first wave.

The examples think kind wave stacking happen tsunami rogue waves, subsequent waves use earlier wave boost height destructive potential. Last heard Phizer Moderna pretty much neck neck could referring both. know Phizer ramping production distribution start ASAP EUA, Moderna seems little cautious*

*but Phizer expanding trials children, leads believe confident. sub better used be? remember looking back April/May pretty doom gloom support sub. mention extremist, remember someone suggesting hug partner shower curtain absolutely must see them. actually increase cold flu season becomes prominent ideology thought process many itching throat running nose, slight fever shifts ‚Äúmaybe Covid‚Äù ‚Äúahh it‚Äôs temperature changing‚Äù. 

I imagine so. already thought process I'm super allergic ragweed mold. feel like shit every fall idk I'm supposed determine whether allergies/sinus problems acting covid. - complete disregard rationality wanting turn argument morality. 

Oh goal posts shifted 1) overwhelming medical system 2) waiting there‚Äôs vaccine 3) circumventing death together. Oof, last update July! keep head cool tin foil hat? Luckily COVID 99% survival rate. Question: 94,000 88,000 Saturday U.S.? numbers top sub, via different newspapers, attribute figures JHU. don‚Äôt know still case Italy think beginning testing people came hospital. would massive discrepancy confirmed total case numbers. states it‚Äôs much easier get tested I‚Äôm confident still discrepancy don‚Äôt think Italy best case extrapolate Sociopaths cause pandemic last longer crippling outright killing neighbors. shunned. shut tho No, not. claim others moving goalposts?

Compare Europe. No, Europe, closest countries. Well, Denmark, fit narrative. Norway, Finland selected Balkan countries worse.

Well, would Ebola treated way? Shit, naturally not, let's drop one.

Oh shit, even ones want compare spinning talking stricter measures again. Fine, focus Rt.

Damnit, Sweden actually worse others either.

So what's next? Regions instead countries? Sure, Norway Finland looking multiple regional outbreaks control. they're good either.

This sub sort fetish wishing people would dying Sweden, unfortunately fetish fulfilled. first two? update advices already place. announcement earlier month official crisis information website compiles measures recommendations given : 

17th March change link news FHM actually goes update recommendations posted 16 march : describes recommendations elderly last paragraph also describes advice employers working conditions. arbetsgivare som har m√∂jlighet att l√•ta anst√§llda arbeta hemifr√•n kan √∂verv√§ga att rekommendera detta. Det skulle kunna ha en viss d√§mpande effekt p√• spridningen ‚Äì och d√§rmed avlasta sjukv√•rden ‚Äì synnerhet Stockholmsregionen.** Ok? dumb response saying certain airports terrible. Source? wrote got downvoted.

It wasn‚Äôt me. Lol, stupid football take look excess deaths, covid. 
Try get informed instead sticking head sand. reason believe susceptible? bar Italy exactly elsewhere. Bars Italy include basically Cafes. Well, normally honest find plenty packed places 3am weekend :) thanks, good info misleading, parameters Finland Norway quite similar Sweden. Furthermore, Nordic cities towns less sparse countries city states. leadership administration. can't eradicate thing overnight try limit spread. administration want try anything reduce transmission.

They issue national mask mandate (states abide least tried). lock could try national curfew non-essential businesses close certain time night. However, thing matters administration stock market human lives.

Relying therapeutics treatments may delay deaths prevent them. need plan, something administration seems incapable coming with. There's really medical care needed mild cases kids get. keeping kids home. true. also might undermine belief death rate lowered. common refrain less deadly now, numbers, treatments improved. may may true: data can't tell us. Yep, Italy's bad numbers today US equivalent 117,000 cases, still nearly bad Spain,Belgium,Netherlands, Czechia,France, Switzerland Almost 5 million tests weekend. Damn. fell love Netherlands visiting would often say want move there. response COVID definitely changed opinion them. says nothing Spain example contact tracing outbreak. Yes, deserve credit stopping outbreak NYC. thought making different point. 

Where Spain July says nothing summer. So, take 17700 Belgium 305 400? logic, Belgium 2.63%, 0.16%, White House 3 time worse, 60 time worse. oh hey too! pretty well, it‚Äôs shame US kinda fucked lmao Yeah also think many people keep it.

But say 10% people keep it, big change 0% it.

To really like festival enjoyment sit bus without mask on, like cherished experience WOO HOO MASK LESS BUS RIDE OH HAPPINESS!

 easily without experince order minimize chance sick week flu - really hate lol. Here' anecdote colds. New teachers get sick several times first year teaching. However, year ot two, get sick year. observation. Eh, rural areas mean everyone goes 1 2 grocery stores. live City people pretty good wearing masks, recently visited family rural area mask adherence terrible. mention people largely overweight health problems, closest hospital hour away quite small. already 110% ICU capacity cases rise. [Masks strictly enforced Spain long Since May. required public indoor spaces, public outdoor spaces whenever social distancing possible. brother NYC ( Manhattan) says it‚Äôs basically done there. pockets Brooklyn Queens overall said Long Island Manhattan there‚Äôs hardly corona. Everyone fatigued general consensus seems we're going live foreseeable future, people getting things. means literally ""we"", american people, administration. dispute possibility controlling it, refuse to. abdicated duty. So... proof then?

And record, Dr Li warning (to alumni group way, public proper chain report up) said SARS, know, factually wrong. ‚ÄúRecent data Santa Clara County health officials suggests people catching virus work carpools spreading others home.‚Äù Christ almighty ... guy one dumb (and callous) motherf---ker.  wonder half Americans hesitant taking vaccines. It‚Äôs antivaxxer skepticism, it‚Äôs distrust Trump administration‚Äôs politicization process.

Technically, existed ***l9ng prior*** Trump. ""Shocking"" We're rounding corner!

/s  GETTING CLOSER 100K LETD GO USA KEEP PUSHINGGGG sure. Probably depends stable ground given place result fracking. Maybe it‚Äôs situation 9/10 sites don‚Äôt cause problems, 10th issue. Ugh, know comment this!? Yes, selfishness US. rich get richer, poor die. Fuck POS Like college football stadium. We‚Äôre talking two MLB baseball stadiums.  ***Winter coming....*** Self quarantine known work beginning, strange West countries still rely it.

You need isolate positive 14 days facility. watch netflix there. See ‚Äúthink it‚Äôs fake don‚Äôt care.‚Äù People like problem. Progress never enough. less halfway pandemic likelihood encounter biggest spike yet.

It little late, I‚Äôm thankful high profile Republican willing sacrifice reputation tell Americans take shit seriously go Winter. read one article said third wave...but I‚Äôm confident first one ended. Let‚Äôs see it. Make America Great Again! [WHO Pays Tribute Spain COVID-19 July.) Well consider OC bigger midwestern states terms population. impressive indeed. 

The key Newsom started planning early Feb. , especially contracts PPE. gave Trump benefit doubt March played nice. 

So CA wasn‚Äôt placed Trump‚Äôs shit list Biden selected Harris. Head COVID task force (Pence) close contacts turned enemy (virus). Ahhh dreaded silent treatment.

I 4 young children, dog husband take care talk long friends hobbies. household help pandemic it‚Äôs everything. Meanwhile, Trump admin CNN morning saying aren‚Äôt going try control spread.

Source: would think repurpose anything repurpose overwhelmed hospitals

Nah, they'll ship sick people state, make someone else's problem. wonder half Americans hesitant taking vaccines. It‚Äôs antivaxxer skepticism, it‚Äôs distrust Trump administration‚Äôs politicization process. Exactly, chronic conditions hardly contained elderly. 

I'm early 50s. handle idea dying, facing next decades unable think breathe. That's keeps home point. a, say, given age overall health, 1 200 chance dying otherwise I'd absolutely recover totally, I'd willing risk health (although obviously anybody else's). 

When finally this, whenever actually turns be, dust settles, think we're going facing massive crisis formerly productive, disabled workers. 

As point somebody else made, know they're actually chronic conditions yet, true. perhaps say - I'm willing risk 8 months able think breathe. Avoiding alone worth every moment isolation. Someone get guy medal! Damn.... Orange = confirmed cases, blue = real estimated cases.
This Italy, imagine every profession sacrifices others automatically socialist? Police, fireman, military, healthcare workers. can‚Äôt see forest trees. really educate difference socialism, sacrifice. first one 48 cases so

What? talking Qingdao? 12 cases.

There single case Guangdong quarantine hotel worker Qingdao, case caught time thanks periodical testing spread. Maybe aren‚Äôt worst every measure. US worst western wealthy country  bet lot actually believe that. Meanwhile Canada we're 2k per day now... Weird countries northern hemisphere coincidentally experiencing country needs explained local conspiracy ties parochial political obsessions. respiratory virus hitting new peak heading October November? Inconceivable! Low SES directly related health part food. Healthier foods harder low SES access, education, time money recourses inversely allocates wealthy, doubt it! zero flu infections, imagine that. maybe first lockdown much, no?

As countries taken different approaches like Sweden shown us, number surges going equal number lockdowns plus one.  good lose weight, go it. obesity covid death sentence, covid obese, examples well. guy infected me, runs marathons needed treated hospital hit hard. 

I definitely plan lose weight I'm bed since many health quality life issues attached obesity. Covid one little part. average time testing positive death WAY less 8 weeks. WAY less. work Covid icu see daily. Twitter thread linked addresses average time *reporting* positive *reporting* death. course math thread heavily influenced Florida, reporting notably slowly finally brought back indoor dining NJ, saw spikes. half restaurants even offer due staffing issues wanting murder customer, people eaten indoors. cold snap today though, things could get ugly fast. ""smart"" president told sheeps afraid virus let dominate them. cases rising? would thought that...I'm surprised!!?! really. rural area spread out, sure. still live communities. people still get together church grocery store, gather others houses. though people country automatically hunker hide passes. did, cases surging across country right now.

The reality people need ***mask fuck up***, ***social distance*** .I'm tired saying it, I'm tired people ignorant assholes putting us position first place. What's source 100% fact? Sweden well, herd immunity debunked. NZ borders open want import infections countries. case load small internally many places business work opened US. mention South Korea, Vietnam even China large country large population. best response literally response US would great best non-response. think getting surge? favor search ""us coronavirus cases"" True, bear mind mortality rates still heavily depend age. It‚Äôs weird number people getting Covid 19 hit 150% previous high election üôÑüôÑ


The coronavirus nothing flu, many cases even dangerous flu. Wake up. Exactly party hard af vaccine feel safe again. People act like it‚Äôs God given right party get drunk prove that, supporting evidence dishonesty party. 2nd wave. still lots ‚Äúexperts‚Äù saying it‚Äôs little flu overall hoax matter?  America worst. You‚Äôre still first wave. Learning something would require admit past mistake. world stronkman Trump one *ever* admits mistake. Good luck want hurt actual goverment reinstall fascist goverment. try strengthen reichsb√ºrger movement right wing party. uniformed teen. Grow learn denier kiddo protests cases rise high fuck next weeks. Europe bad
... Fascists mostly upset ""goverment control"" doesnt exclusivly target groups hate. He/she probably respond something predictable like ""And great life living bubble scared."" sense empathy lacking skipping one Thanksgiving pandemic means complete coward. haven‚Äôt found source that. some? love visiting North Dakota, different Saskatchewan, live.

But lot way, world different. 73 new cases yesterday Saskatchewan think people starting feel anxious. 300,000 people North Dakota.

They around 1,000 new cases day. 

Hooboy. fracking caused earthquakes already happening thing worry about? ND 12 earthquakes entire history, recent 6 years ago. countries, like Brazil India, surpassed US *daily* case counts? basically seems US pandemic. Pretty much state local government willing able significantly lockdown roll back restrictions. seems like country, mask wearing social distancing peaked, gradual decline. matter hard mayors governors beg people two above, stage don‚Äôt really see much effect.

Am correct this? thailand? That's bastards want. Trust yourself, trust science. trust entertainment companies thrive controversy people they've snowed. Yes‚Äîit‚Äôs literally explained right 3rd paragraph article. won‚Äôt last another two years, mean restrictions.

Well. people relapse, happens virus goes exponential again, get new freak hard restrictions.

Many people seem think option ignore - really. happens, crush health system mean death many people even covid, countries allow fuck without condom first date sometimes

They lot yes, much case back HIV really scary disease. see habits change, HIV less talked dangerous, people never lived dropped condoms accordingly.

Habits change fundamental thing. Way back I'd also arguing people thought condom habits would stay forever, think January 2020 dating habits stay forever. 
 
People always think world know cannot change, past stuff thing nobody gives af. know Reddit seems like everyone shutting it‚Äôs going like while, fact matter young people don‚Äôt give af, people done it, people want lives back.

I know also wrote first post here. course depends carefull are. young people seem think much catching corona.

The kissing stuff applies people care, obviously. 9%, effect.

If say people whatever want, virus grow big countries get shut - Spain starting introduce martial law - also change people, they've experienced martial law country.

It really matter plays - crazy stuff happen, give people new experiences. 

If live say 3 month zero hospitals country, also think make people apprehensive stuff. 

Say best friend cuts finger accident, hospital deal it, need handle yourself. That's also something think would affect you. Spain lockdown months ago March til June. reopened quickly open summer. Yup, we've turned corner - right oncoming traffic. know. ""exceedingly rare"". idiots everywhere. someone wearing mask, would get elevator them? ‚ÄòMURICA!

FUCK YEAH! It‚Äôs bad right. girlfriends family Macomb County anti mask Trump loving it‚Äôs sickening. might break soon cuz seems like she‚Äôs choosing dog. sucks Thanks conspiracy non science laden Covid19response White House, beloved holiday celebrations 3 generations canceled year. germany. Berlin stoped contact tracing counts people self quarantine never work. lost controle germany really start lockdown stuff beginning pandemic, last week would've even better. like said lost controle...üòµ like first wave third surge (midwest) republicans politicized promoting condom use

It's true! talk condoms sex ed 7th grade. Self isolate get home please. read Twitter thread linked OP, directly addresses older populations. yeah arguing false choice - capitalism vs socialism. think know root problem bit complex.

Look laws 1920 laws today. Progress takes time. US move left, electoralism.  you‚Äôre waiting socialist revolution US - that‚Äôs happening. fact far right revolution far likely. covid equivalent Billboard's ""Number 10 bullet"": It‚Äôs worldwide trend, it‚Äôs many countries. think time... Place scale ‚Äúno one leaves home, even children swings outside building‚Äù one end, (a 10) ‚Äúnormal 2019‚Äù end (a 1). would put Norwegian/Danish 4-week
Shutdowns would put situation Sweden April? mean Sweden obviously lower dk/no lot closer either Spanish ‚Äúlevel 10‚Äù. Say 4 5 (for example). think US government failed miserably. it‚Äôs disgusting people selfish wear masks. 

That said, think truth, however misguided, idea people getting tested. I‚Äôm sure someone point right direction, wonder rate asymptomatic positive tests gone significantly. I‚Äôm speaking anecdotally, get test returning work. came back negative must people testing positive. Whereas people getting tested good reason believe contracted virus. 

All said, obviously hospitals starting get overrun clearly there‚Äôs spike serious cases too. guess point whether cases, opposed deaths hospitalizations, really best metric right now. called duality Americs gotta keep number 1 spot Brazil India tail. Europe also starting second wave second wave top 5 could change future. state, El Paso already first peak. undoubtedly happened many places already continue happen. I‚Äôve sewing cloth masks since February, Reddit member.

2 layer high quality cotton recommended. don‚Äôt want see candle it. Adding additional layer add small amount higher protection start getting less breathability.

I 2 layer cotton mask add pocket filter desired.
The school kids seem fine them. Send clean mask lunch. Plastic zipper bag dirty masks. Paper masks fine get expensive, prefer them. 
Be safe wish headlines reported infections, especially superlatives like 'record' 'highest', auto-bot reply current positivity rate. Reporting record infections sets shot 'but low chance death' every time. Yep, pretty much figured. Sad hear surprised. Christmas going kill thousands

But going shopping, going worry, sending people school essential things wont?

That‚Äôs true. seasonality caused prior immunity levels decaying, it‚Äôs caused improvements conditions spread, primarily includes increased time indoors, also cooler temperatures lower levels UV, protect virus degradation. Beligum small country really count. barley country /s 

We heading towards exponential growth Spain. It‚Äôs coming bad. going get another full lockdown next month. Deaths hospitalizations lag time person infected. Daily case numbers closer what's going right now.  Tyrants ruining lives idiots scared. Sweden force public employees possible could work home since mid March strongly advice private sector same? Nope. came later.

Actually, wrong. Public employees (and government agencies) switched remote workplace soon became FHM official recommendation middle March. However, Stockholm, major outbreak was, region Stockholm already mandated public private employers least week earlier. previously recommendation stay home symptoms report sick leave needed, sick leave made entirely paid (unlike before) extended time two three weeks without needing doctor's certificate. Oh really? one times Tegnell **Each country reach ‚Äòherd immunity‚Äô** \[when high proportion population immune infection, largely limiting spread people immune\] one way another, **we going reach different way.** published April 21.

Here another time let real underlying strategy continued interesting decision: ‚ÄúI believe strategy Public Health Authority achieve herd immunity, many people possible infected thereby become immune, without seriously ill.‚Äù hand, Annika Linde‚Äôs successor, current state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, doesn‚Äôt agree idea:  least happen quickly possible.** \[We\] must calm, slow controlled healthcare system manage \[the coronavirus\], **we rush.**‚Äù

That published March 16.

Without openly stating it, Tegnell made clear ""Swedish Strategy"" ""herd immunity"" strategy.

Put simply - strategy allow controlled spread virus would eventually create herd immunity without overwhelming hospitals cases.

He much comfortable admitting early on, thousands deaths caused strategy. pretend never part equation, without explaining actually expected outcome strategy be.

Think it... intended slow spread virus rather stop it... outcome could expecting? herd immunity. want admit it. lies. sub wants mask wearing. Nothing else advocated much that. people wore fucking mask, wet going tiers. could things open certain measures. 

It side sees middle ground, want everything open without measures. open schools complain masks, class size class hours. Nothing help us. even federal mandate. Everything getting worse worse crybabies stay inside wear mask outside. Pathetic. ""it'll bring economy"" oh yeah, things looking now? geniuses want explain helps economy? Gotcha, fingers crossed indeed.

Here California, similar drawn approach early on. Hard restrictions (many still exist recently changed), knowing worse. It‚Äôs easy predict ya, thinking next week different makes real hard it‚Äôs real hard plan ahead either. saw dark humor couple weeks ago:

god asking angels: So, guys, events planned 2020s?

angels: Ooohhh, *twenties*?! Woops. guys test many? country stuck 4k many months since that's max capacity. Personally im ok this

I trust fix Thanks perspective mate. Stay safe. nothing! smart listening scientists (rather trying undermine like current president). maybe party ask huuuge sacrifices like...everyone wear f*cking mask public awhile (until vaccine arrives).  wish America would take seriously like China Oh, thinking moral greatness; type greatness cares masses. No, US racial economic religious greatness; kind that's used oppress masses. I'm worried rest country fuck guys. mean, problem ""patchwork pandemic"" response country has. predict get better affordable vaccine works accessible everyone. People keep reinfecting other. Yeah, noticed too. Admissions per day decreasing days now. hope it‚Äòs fluctuation. point, much conflicting info, corruption, fraud, etc really can't determine anything.

There proven cases people positive results despite showing swabs. proven cases motorcycle accident victims counted covid deaths. PCR tests suitable testing COVID pick even slightest trace. puts question even thing asymptomatic cases people enough virus trigger PCR tests, enough actually infected. Since people positive negative results, we'll see possible second infections know they're ACTUAL second infections first time false positive. antibody strip tests witnessed first hand bullshit, gave german made ones someone 3 weeks PCR confirmed covid infection actually sick (tried several, came back negative). told masks shit, wear masks. get fined wear mask here. There's much money made virus nothing believed anymore. year we'll vaccine, 3 years we'll see tv commercials saying ""Have loved ones experienced negative side-effects due covid-19 vaccine? Join class action lawsuit"".

We know many people it, many died it, much role played comorbidity cases, anything.

There's really nothing live life normal, easily get wearing mask washing hands religiously... flu doesn‚Äôt cause shortness breath

Yes Look, even death rate zero, literally one ever died it, I‚Äôd still feel exactly way.

I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs insane. consequence disease you‚Äôd feel uncomfortable while, we‚Äôd never shut anything down. saw dude claiming 20% Covid cases become crippled life. sub nuts hahaha According announcement [Ministry Health Care personal care businesses, gyms, pools, fitness centers, food service businesses accommodate social distancing closed. I'm Norwegian could certainly mistaken, take mean could still go places like book stores, clothing stores, toy stores, etc, could still eat indoors restaurants? definitely seems stricter Sweden, seems far less strict many countries. shit. That's narrative pushed trump administration. Yes. least state. We're huge increase cases state, health department said main cause college students come back. biggest increases come 18-24 year old age group. night time Exactly. point one thing CANT happen millions people getting furloughed again. Basically lockdowns happening, matter bad things get. Well controlled, covid overload health system, simply enough beds, doctors nurses treat everyone. 

That's works. 

This happened Italy back April. happen many places winter seems. According announcement [Ministry Health Care personal care businesses, gyms, pools, fitness centers, food service businesses accommodate social distancing closed. I'm Norwegian could certainly mistaken, take mean could still go places like book stores, clothing stores, toy stores, etc, could still eat indoors restaurants? definitely seems stricter Sweden, seems far less strict many countries. Yep. Hitting 32 Upstate New York too. Starting wonder turn heat on. Yes White House give testing amongst them? highly doubt it. line drawn ago. incentive act incompetence past days, new cases hover around 1600-1900 Slovenia, nation 2 millions inhabitants.. Complete lockdown imminent. turn stadiums field hospitals america? Create new things do, like whenever sunny get walk, make hot chocolate home. Get sunlight possible. Maybe Vietnam China often multiple generations living house, often careful old people children living them. 


And people afraid wear masks, quite common even covid appeared due polluted environment sun ray.  Wait comment get removed? said death rate down, positivity rate total daily deaths down? Shouldn‚Äôt talked about?  Yeah small businesses already teetering edge even first stimulus. second lockdown without one would massacre basically every business that‚Äôs owned megacorp country. yet hospitals tripled beds spring. almost surge capacity something hospital system plans for.  Yikes. logic, anyone follows religion (i.e. Jews, Muslims, Hindus, etc.) also stupid. correct? 

I know think figured out. Nobody tell nothing. trying? really know. math way off. 0.05% would 140,000 deaths. contact tracers saying? Seems like want push hope survivors enough immunity keep country together. Ur plague rat nuts need hit 1000 per DAY additional restrictions. Especially since we've restricted testing appointment testing capacity stuck 40k-50k.

On extreme, China detects even 1 asymptomatic case routine testing, tests entire city (millions) within days quarantines close contacts.

Eradication (not mere reduction) lockdown followed rapid response new cases clearly best approach long term economic public health. flu doesn‚Äôt cause shortness breath, total loss taste smell. You‚Äôre literally trying downplay covid. Covid way severe flu causes way damage body. Also you‚Äôre correct I‚Äôve pretty much never flu get Flu Shot every year. interest getting either.

Look, even death rate zero, literally one ever died it, I‚Äôd still feel exactly way. fact 230k died adds fear anxiety. thanks! I‚Äôd anything avoid getting covid protect family it. Congress pass another stimulus bill comes that. Clarifies election pretty well, doesn‚Äôt it? Fight give it‚Äôs hard, incompetent/corrupt anything useful. two gets vote? I‚Äôm CA, still wear masks, even conservative areas coming around. county divided liberal south conservative north. North triple hospitalizations. south major university, college kids fucked spiked rates, add whole county. may go back step college kids C'mon now, needs health jobs pandemic? Right really need get everything going lowest bidder. Guess you‚Äôre right, literally conscious decision treat elderly, lockdown care homes (though lockdown way later countries). ""They told us send anyone hospital, even may 65 many years live. told send in,"" says Latifa L√∂fvenberg, nurse worked several care homes around G√§vle, north Stockholm, beginning pandemic.

As strategy, aware it, since you‚Äôre praising it. Sweden tradition voluntary measures infection control based recommendations, emphasis individual responsibility. pandemic, authorities‚Äô recommendations stay home sick, wash hands frequently, keep physical distance limit travelling largely adhered to.

Sweden opted minimum, voluntary measures. proven lead ten times higher death count Norway. lockdown Norway successful reducing pressure healthcare system. Norway would followed lenient Swedish response, peak number COVID19 hospitalizations would three times higher. They‚Äôve convinced ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù work, without idea whatsoever herd immunity works. care people. Period. Social virtual reality. tricks brain enough help fill pandemic void. live alone still decently good enough spirits thanks VR, dine-in restaurants bothered lot physically near people. Well, excess deaths Finland large increase excess deaths Sweden, particularly Stockholm County, many people live. Excess deaths 2nd quarter 59% average, 5,952 died. Transitional seasons notorious inhibiting immune systems, winter alone isn‚Äôt reason.

Now combine upcoming holiday season people congregating indoors instead outdoors boom, goes dynamite. weren‚Äôt discussing that. fact discussing population density sucks metric countries like Sweden. stories 12 Americans left jobless due pandemic.

Oh god...

This sub depressing fuck....

Is people go die?

Edit: Oh new york forgot went full dictator mode.Yeah would suck knowing cant work dictator leader allow it. like one friend could hang with, honestly friend hasn‚Äôt super great lately. They‚Äôre also mutual friends person cut things with. Like supposed friends thanksgiving, person going there, don‚Äôt want go around her. lot people like mix together things read Facebook wherever reality, example someone Facebook forwards screenshotted meme health department told that, concoct false memory *they* heard health department. 

My friend's anti-mask sister claims doctor told masks ineffective, actually Youtube ""doctor"" told that. never said anybody lockdown America. I'm saying Jake Tapper wrong significant portion subreddit broader left would like either lockdown close businesses. Sweden considering lockdown right cases keep rising yeah keep using data that's outdated 8 months. getting 100k cases day soon US. ton Midwest states cases rise, even rural areas now. many rural areas, least state take seriously yet they've relatively untouched.

And course TX FL putting half new infections together day. sound like youre upset youre swearing, Hell, wtf etc. 

Doesnt matter, still dont understand disagree about. 

He says less deaths last months seem think aswell.

Im referring question. 

""I also question. So. hell could last several months deaths usual year *(that, dare mention, consist months)* record high number deaths?"" *pan*demic already means global. It‚Äôs literally name. point usually people shout ‚Äúglobal pandemic‚Äù aren‚Äôt thinking critically they‚Äôre saying Yeah, hit hard early on. data gathered spring across world. one district US relevant point here. Taiwan pretty nice visit apparently. Hey I‚Äôm little loop cases Covid spreading test more? born czech republic live still... life come fast many many people realize upcoming months harsh truth. already late now... time bs. Hehe, sorry. I'm echoing something one colleagues waffles every day hopes finding answer ""conundrum"" adamantly presents us. always leaves speechless. Read article something comment got downvoted support microscopic, many people feel ok one group commit arson types crimes certain cause. like crazy anti maskers, anti vaxxers people extreme bubble really see nothing wrong destruction property fits agenda. Unless stable testing regimes consistent standards, selection criteria, tests testing site testing site, time T1 time Tn, way knowing positivity rate telling you. need independent proxy tell progress disease community. we‚Äôre back start - you‚Äôre proud country kept it‚Äôs cool, resulted ten times number deaths neighbouring country, evidence kind due reason. you‚Äôre even trying find evidence, want opinion. 

Yeah I‚Äôll keep insulting you, that‚Äôs fucking insane. know sure that. put dry place, preferably front window, virus germs might reduced that.
Using mask day avoided.
Washing reduce mask's performance.

They designed discarded. people can't afford that.

I printed mask 3d printer, cut-from-surgical-mask filter touch skin. feel confident using longer time prescribed. S01E03_ 1080p.WEB.H264-CoVid.torrent Florida well, flattened curve, restrictions left place, economy recovering, role model states doing. say like huge difference age demographics. not. Even compensate ~2% difference people 65+, **0,4%** difference people 80+. 

I'm laying judgment Finland specifically, think great country, article commenting one many pointing fingers Sweden sacrificing old, statistically year less likely die countries earth. *partial* mitigation. still easy catch it. Wash hands, avoid close indoor contact people. iamverysmart material right here. 

You read ‚Äòresearch‚Äô like, nothing real life bares opinions. 

I really hope you‚Äôre lying phd otherwise it‚Äôs pretty scary you‚Äôre coming shit. Yeah learned lessons SARS, closer neighbors Asia rest western nations. Genuinely far prefer that, aside petrifying creep China even dumb that.

Oil industries less well pandemic. People traveling less, traveling significantly less.

Because that, product (oil) selling much.

If wanted money actually bail-out industry, could see that. Money pay workers, instance, evil version, cover costs give executives. would least make sense.

But response product selling well to...ask money produce product.

Worse that, Bakken oil field want build practically already peaked production. new well going diminishing returns.

The thing think makes make sense someone looking skim CARES package make buck constructing new wells, actual profits production damned. China communist practice also direct democratic elections/voting local level indirect voting levels gov top.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* perfect set ingredients mess. Pandemic + leader prioritizes economy public health + election year. missed cases Mar/April. caught much smaller amount caught later thus case fatality rate much higher time. (Hospital treatments improved well)

As pointed out, uptick deaths reliably 1% fatality reliably follows uptick cases within 2-4 weeks countries posted graphs for, including Spain. cases hit 3k day start August, daily deaths 30 day 23rd. cases exceeded 8k day start Sep, daily deaths (all 7 day averages) 100 day within 3 weeks. 

So uptick happen, correspond pretty robustly, albeit lag, course much lower case fatality rate Spring. someone make test negative even positive? thinking rinsing nose saline solution mouthwash alcohol mouth.
It work right ? Lol imagine thinking epidemiology based mathematics. Even he's right employees productive they're dead, hospitalized, breathing impaired post recovery Full lockdowns super harsh remotely strawman. Things totally fine NZ. Shut borders, get people stay home couple months, things calm right hell down. citizens antisocial need martial law though suspect Yes? would care ebola pandemic happened Africa Australia wether want kiss someone time?

Edit: fixed time better explained parable. work directly testing different european country (mandatory rapid antigen) see, approx half detected positive cases report they‚Äôre asymptomatic.

Have point roughly estimated observations purely anecdotal. seen much rationalisation respected people crisis, can't dismiss claim anymore, unfortunately. Wrong. Masks always compulsory public spaces, indoor. beginning October made mandatory even outside. Super big cities generally don‚Äôt super friendly people. Something living close many people kills niceness. I‚Äôve never really bought rude French/Parisian stereotype. would put Paris solidly middle pack big cities I‚Äôve terms nice/polite are. 

At point France/eu going address Roma problem. Thank you! wrote basically comment minutes you. barely several weeks entire year. Probably. example, Spain rolls weekend numbers Monday realize countries exist world re/opened schools, extensive testing elementary aged children, robust contact tracing efforts place - right? swear thread acting like one two countries exist world one anywhere else world ever thought test contact tracing programs look schools origin mass outbreaks. It‚Äôs one else world technology common sense. true, would anyone young want contribute society know future society throw bus they've spent lives paying it? awful headline, right. article discuss implications beyond year. Cases, deaths. Thankfully deaths stayed low, don‚Äôt get daily case rate down, won‚Äôt hold long. Yeah, chances many us look back 2020 fondly. It'll likely years beat COVID, ever, climate change going bring pandemics. political landscape looking scary extremism rise. Hundreds millions people displaced famine severe weather, go somewhere. Clean water scarcity. Food prices skyrocket. things already taking place, they'll get worse. 

""Hindsight 2020"".  FINALLY. I've saying weeks. Schools open around Europe. 1-2 months later get new wave we're pretending exist. I've observing kids European countries. masks, distancing, fucks given. know bad kids tough parents honestly idea could done. Ignoring ain't though. wrong. major EU nations, including France, higher mortality rate US. think obvious virus become endemic stage. taking vaccines new mutations like flu years come. economy factor FoHM strategy.

Fuller quote:

Ekot: ‚ÄùFirstly questions regarding governments announcement week increase number participants public gatherings 50 300. happens right spread increasing. logic this?‚Äù

Morgan Johansson:‚ÄúWell, first one say measures install time included balancing infection control economic consequences. 

And important every situation, say, find measures enable us manage balance.‚Äù

[About one minute *angry upvote aren‚Äôt talking math here, we‚Äôre talking waves pandemic, many experts said didn‚Äôt recover enough end first wave. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è know I'm hearing is; ""But *care* else gets infected maybe dies, wanna wear mask"".

Just shut fuck man. thing bothers articles need acknowledge testing shortage first wave front.

The true number cases orders magnitude higher reported.

I nearly ""I think need call 911"" level sick mid March get tested. criteria asking italy china iran. go school here, trust me, even trying anything pandemic. requirements masks teachers wear closer 6 feet student. feel bad teachers, especially one special needs child breathing problem, special needs child got covid, would probably die. then, kids literally coughing direction teacher. Screw state. Maybe southern Idaho better, go school, Priest River, probably something productive society like moving Antarctica bring guns ""pRoTeCt uS EvIl BiG PhArMa."". Ill probably end emigrating here. Thank goodness ill able emancipated 16 probably. safe everyone. would done different fix problem.

Have ramped testing March, shut borders travel mandatory quarantining upon entrance truly needed get country, hired many contact tracers possible. That's pretty decent start.  covid live still mask mandates. reluctant wearers, wear know action taken, mostly people follow distancing bubble rules gone months without community spread. Yes-and asymptomatic means body mechanism fight off. virus threat anyway asymptomatic. get stronger infection years later? Possibly. like mild flu 2010 guarantee mild flu forever. maybe time future immune system may weaken become susceptible due health issue get possibly stronger viral load.

But Vaccines drugs bridge gap then. 

The immune system complex-I understand insane obsession ""antibodies , virus protection "". Antibodies decline EVERY viral infection. asymptomatic means body whatever virtue mounted strong defense virus. angry. Wtf talking about. correcting obvious false information last message, need angry that? Things getting pretty bad can't tell real administration satire. Doesn‚Äôt help leader country can‚Äôt give clear message save life ours. case Starbucks, somewhere South Korea. employees didn‚Äôt take masks uninflected. patrons second third floor got taking drinking coffee. employees wearing KN95s. see else cause uptick. anything, deaths down, partial lockdowns limits spread diseases. people say lack cancer-tests cause higher deaths future, would still take time evolve. like 5 years ago Yes absolutely am. Especially it‚Äôs $16 million dollars. ND can‚Äôt even contact tracing doesn‚Äôt enough resources. People community DYING aren‚Äôt enough hospital beds available. Dying community members getting sent 5+ hours away time tell families goodbye. communities don‚Äôt adequate infrastructure, schools can‚Äôt protect themselves. yes. angry.  Americans tend friendly, superficially. thing kindness. Even stupid Dakotas? possible? can‚Äôt afford shut unless there‚Äôs large-scale bailout measures taken. one, Democrat Republican, office seemingly interested passing. can‚Äôt lose house. That‚Äôs much bigger concern millions others getting sick almost certain recover. Exactly. Best strategy keep head down. simply dont understand mindset test cops. That's putting TON trust person dont even know... purportedly distrust! Gah! frustrating. Netherlands, Australia, China, Ireland, Germany top head, extensive testing testing contact tracing found nothing going back Spring. many thread think talking US like center world. Since testing contact tracing effort part exist last spring US, I‚Äôm (obviously) talking data gathered US. mean completely totally utterly obvious I‚Äôm talking data gathered US.  That‚Äôs 50 million people

What selfless things help thise small business? wearing mask encouraging everyone else to? social distancing? made mistake going big box hardware store weekend. Way many people without masks. I'm ready hunker stay several weeks. People area also preparing trick treat. bad combination. start third peak STEEP! EXACTLY experts predicted dumbest powerful people country said would behind us end April 2020. 800 died two days? Crazy, right? engineer left train, must‚Äôve bailed miles back ... we‚Äôre read comments KSL, find situation go worse. topic geez wish stuck old colours. affected start less. virus magic. minimal risk disease, considered able fully understand consent. something goes wrong, PR nightmare.

So Biontech/Pfizer must pretty confident safety BNT162-B2, really nearly sterilise vaccinated. Also, confidence fast production ramp-up, age group last get it. read research (and mean all) , reviewed much modelling done econometric integrity, done support opinions? Evidence half claims largely touted weak. 2.2 million potential deaths modeled Imperial College London repeated here, I, MD/PhD student studying immunology, kept saying sort shit study used data China populate parameters *and* made bunch poor immunological assumptions.

There clear evidence study shit. Even Bill Gates said so. However, Trump's #1 talking point COVID along closed US China. Every debate ""over 2 million deaths!"" can't even deny left clung hard start. countries are. Gah! frustrating. Netherlands, Australia, China, Ireland, Germany top head, extensive testing testing contact tracing found nothing going back Spring. many thread think talking US like center world. Since testing contact tracing effort part exist last spring US, I‚Äôm (obviously) talking data gathered US. Oh, infections going down? Honestly many French people expect much second wave life went back normal May on. Colleagues mine still downplaying week ago. bottom graph mirror top right side left? 

Of course lag, count weeks. regular year somewhere 85'000 95'000 people die year Sweden, we're damn near November right we've still broken 6'000 COVID-19 deaths.

We're going OK, still think I'm arguing something I'm not. Sweden has, probably 6th time now, indeed fucked Norway Denmark patently handled better overall have, pandemic factors well country region fares *nothing* national COVID-19 strategies.

I'm sorry believe binary opinion required work like that. I'm proud Sweden we've kept cool, picked genius strategy handled flawlessly. can't get distinction keep insulting me, prove right I'm sure. theyve done nothing theyre ideas  start calling second wave third? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Certainly. statement way construed suggesting wearing masks. would idiotic suggest. Yeah, seems 1.25 billion dollars gone plenty places North Dakota. $66 million apportioned Department Mineral resources, allocating $16 million $66 million fracking jobs. unhappy 1.3% CARES funding ND gone department?  I've since March year... Yes correct since then, slightly less deaths. july, august september less died. 

I dont understand angry. said last couple months less deaths sounds like also think that? one wave. never got control. 

Is criterion Imagine line moving zooming out.

What if, instead, deal actual data? Waves different amplitudes. That's basic mathematics shown data already have. Here's grift:

Florida, current administration, says everything fine control virus actually rages control.

Then, next President comes power, Florida says ""OMG administration anything Florida, look bad numbers are!""

Then, new President gives ton money aid Florida used bunch private stuff squandered Desantis there's never enough restrictions aid given states (see also: states using Covid funds fracking). helpful all. =\ Chinese citizens banned though, US. foreign citizen China transited China could enter NZ unless spent 14 days another country first. Chinese people could come NZ, spend 14 days Singapore transit location boarding flight NZ.

Not ICU's, ICU, singular. people said need lockdowns hospitals getting overrun demanding Utah lock down? Oh believe know! DAP like 1000 feet house! read part NZ thousand cases day UK ~150/200k day?

Where London global transport hub one busiest airports world NZ middle bum fuck nowhere way bum fuck nowhere. 

Completely comparable situations. You‚Äôre totally delusional think weeks lockdown would sorted it. 

And fuck even right ... guess thousands lorries per day arrive France, Netherlands Belgium biggest outbreaks Europe right are. would bringing people virus carriers every day. 
The virus endemic Europe. 


I don‚Äôt think realise connected Europe compared antipodean backwaters. bad Idaho. Oh, think Florida thinks real. look Florida pursuing *herd immunity* strategy. Even explicitly say it, policies say it. far I'm concerned, states governor interfering cities counties prevent mask mandates, etc pursuing herd immunity strategy. say make so. Anglo-Saxon descended cultures Maybe immune , said was, false ""not much else done"" definitely. I'm looking graphs posted seeing corresponding uptick deaths match uptick cases.  Lol like Americans anything like Hong Kong. Americans mess constantly raised view individualism collectivism led irresponsible, dangerous, embarrassing behavior see daily people refusing wear masks, throwing tantrums, overall acting like spoiled brats thinking they're ""fighting freedom"". 

America going far worse nation January following trend beginning pandemic. 1 40 Americans infected already 4% worlds population close 25% deaths. That's selfishness causes! 

To top off: 

USA cases: 8.876 million. 
deaths: 230,000
Population: 320 million 

The next 2 highest counties India Brazil:

Cases: 13.29 million
Deaths: 275,982
Population: 1.597 billion people. (5 times usa) North Dakota dumbest state union? Sure, wait 2 5 years proper postmortem.

I doubt I'll remember, remind me. new world, never go away Many countries used strategies would either unconstitutional create huge backlash freedom loving Americans link shows perfectly well entire month June *Sweden deaths usual period.* Damn, USA always #1!
While Europe lagging behind 2nd wave. I'm pleased live exception country people seem getting kinder thankful communities grateful neighbors right thing. Problem: ""Warp Speed"" ""Sputnik"" supposed skip steps trial respective countries. strains

Poor handling natural disaster not, imo, invalidate entire, largely successful, method governing. Widespread adoption sort governance led many good things, including massive acceleration technological advancements made life something enjoyed rather tolerated masses, something never experienced human binding social connections intrinsically collectivist cultures like China

While China handled COVID better US Europe, would rather live? government would rather have? many lost COVID, China's ""collectivist"" nation, truly extreme crony capitalism state picks winning companies (or establishes itself), killed many fight homogeneity. Americans realize deeply racist authoritarian Chinese government really is.

In US certainly waned last 30-40 years, imo since stagflation brought Reagan economics, ended Reagan era instead persisting onwards leading wealth disparity see today. However, sweeping election victories away re-establishing decent course, headed rapidly towards democratic socialist form government baby boomers start die young people come voting age. Stay course. overall dip, trend still upwards.

Do need correct course? Absolutely.

Is decline last 50 years poor handling evidence need entire rehaul political system something similar China? Absolutely not.

The liberties enjoyed spoiled us, ultimately end game. look bigger picture. *want* liberty. *want* individualism. *are* end game. sometimes need curb sake working towards common goal, curbing sake curbing goes human nature strive towards self-actualized destiny. Testing fairly good US point. US testing per capita basis small handful countries. absolute terms, US routinely performing million tests per day.

The positivity rate US 8%, clearly testing needed. positivity rate far higher across Europe. France, currently stands 28%. offering treatment could ethically saved ethical, no. California New York absolutely happy keep restrictions reimpose necessary. Shrug I'll take maybe dying next pandemic moving city. Draw straws see gets room. Start evaluating higher chance survive giving priority letting weaker patients suffer die. It'll get pretty grim healthcare workers.

It's even stated 6 month study results six months cross-sectional study show classic pattern rapid increase antibody levels within first three weeks COVID-19 symptoms and, expected, reduction intermediate levels thereafter,‚Äù added.  Driving car necessary times...and actually, we've cut back lot too...but going restaurant isn't. complete act leisure one needs do. frankly, really much sacrifice cause harm others.
The intellectual dishonesty really ridiculous. Me, intellectual, knows still first wave, worried atrocity time traveler future came back warn us third wave... point I'm glad border city decided Christmas markets year. past huge tourist attraction times go hear people speaking French, Dutch even English something need year. welcome! Again, opionion like opinion experts, plenty experts opposing opinions.

Have fun scared rest life, never going away. learn live  never attent gathering again. Guys. know feel like it‚Äôs really T‚Äôgiving/Xmas without big family gathering, especially that‚Äôs you‚Äôre used to, cooperate agree keep holiday celebrations small limited household family members year, probably significantly reduce likelihood post holiday spike. 

I also tell experience family best holidays life husband decided family tradition travel holidays (except rarely). low-key relaxing celebrations home. still call families FaceTime, it‚Äôs SOOOOO nice long, quiet, lazy holiday hubby kids. 

And new way celebrating holidays year. don‚Äôt change every holiday gathering forever going forward! *this* year. Humans creative nature I‚Äôm sure come ways still celebrate see loved ones without physically gathering year. 

On top COVID year still flu season don‚Äôt know like season. Let‚Äôs pull together make small sacrifice everyone‚Äôs sake. makes sense exacerbate already difficult situation. Agreed. everything reopened, especially restaurants bars, wearing masks gonna work well. bad US doesn‚Äôt enough test, good contact tracing, strict quarantine. Know someone got Covid-19 still went Alaska vacation. said uptick deaths. clearly false. want make point high cases vs relatively low fatality rate discuss activism deal governmental imposition surely make without resorting false claims. Remind Trump keeps saying cases going down??? actually reinfections though? Even keep testing positive mean reinfection, initial infection leaving residues. 
I'm denying there's reinfections current ones confirmed lot people claim reinfection never sick first place. town seen cases last week saw March June 30th, schools still open. really known, China quarantine positive cases medical observation normally housed two per room, rooming together cause conditions worsen significantly expect someone would noticed now. anecdotally, hospital hasn‚Äôt overwhelmed since first wave. think nursing homes/retirement communities forced get shit together. first wave tore area that‚Äôs drove hospitalizations. vaccine? troll farm worker? might misunderstand youre question but, Sweden large excess death april. Since june negative excess death though. 

So essentially used people normal died, since june slightly less. 

Its youre last link. Distinct waves regions, whole phases surge background burn.

First phase = NE

Second phase = places adjacent coastal states

Third phase = Midwest (center country) joins in, everyone comes along party.

No one saying No, VA hospitals veterans, Fort Bliss on-site hospitals active military ENFORCE mask mandates. also distancing options complete lockdown, know right? mention better access testing, treatment, contact tracing, PPE. ZERO coordinated response federal government, pretty much anything would better they‚Äôve done although like racist tones quote, seem underlying truth describes natural reality way.

See, disagree points.

I love racism because, despise Irish Catholics seeking sympathy massively exaggerated, century-old plights, fascinating find passionate example profound mind. Even though runs contrary axiom transformed world with.

Also, negative tone. secret even Irish Scots spoke dialects shared second language. call ""Saxons"" wildly inaccurate, reeks modern attempt say, ""But X people different. They're actually good ones"". Stop drama queen. 

Already treatments better death rates per infection reduced learnt better treat symptoms.

If *none* current batch vaccines works, (which looks extremely unlikely stage since stage 3), would simply let virus spread managed way possible aim getting herd immunity. 

But later time *we choose* time prepare medical resources use effective treatments developed reduce fatalities. 

We would control circumstances would possible be. 

And ask vaccine herd immunity, whole species trouble, NZ. missed cases first peak. France may conceivably 100k day back (and treatments improved).

Hospitalizations deaths also increasing lag cases. Fatalities pretty robustly 1% detected cases within 2-4 weeks expect France hit around 500 deaths day November more.

Case surges leading indicator coming surges hospitalizations deaths - end all, clearly spread France control hopefully avoid peak 1,000 deaths day back April. recently rural eastern Washington pleasantly surprised see 90-ish% people wearing masks. sort places people pretty conservative politically bet lot think COVID BS, least law-abiding.

Idk sinosoidal, look cases graph see three obvious waves. It‚Äôs even accurate obvious look hospitalizations chart far?  plausibili translate plausible (or possible) cases? so, worst case, likely estimate. Didn‚Äôt Florida government withheld Covid statistics? Denmark definitely tests lot Sweden... focus mortality though, dropped like rock summer beginning autumn Sweden. Hopefully stays low! Meanwhile podunk town they've Trump parades every Saturday last 6 weeks. meet biggest parking lot town socialize maskless drive trucks main drag Trump Thin Blue Line flags fluttering truck beds. virus fake numbers low really numbers low none jokers get tested even get sick. local nursing home lot Covid deaths lately care that. maddening. moved years ago peace quiet want get away Trump sycophants. really brought exposed absolute worst rural America. might mutate benefiting us too, knows though. got friend. high risk. lost it. thinks hoax again. tried help him. son tried. dude give sht zero evidence initial viral load anything severity infection. probability actually get infected, yes. body actually gets infected, irrelevant large initial load was.

Not mention there's zero evidence masks actually reduce viral load anything protect wearer. Masks protect others, you. sub constantly screams ""trust science!"", sure lot nonsense floating around here... Thanksgiving-Christmas gauntlet over, gonna get bad. be, far evidence seems show pretty rare. 14k tests? read right. way behind testing, need least 50k day. testing fallen last months. tests Covid-19, flu, no. thing right wrong eh?

You seem pretty sure RIGHT that, you?

&amp;#x200B;

RIP logic train Fuckin' left-wing reality, always trying make Trump liar. guess becomes little bit math problem, masks 90% effective, making number, there's 10 times number active infections today month ago without mask 10 times likely someone would catch 1038 ND yesterday, like 1/10th population MA... made comment suggesting everyone‚Äôs going die corona l. giving statistical facts. course take serious make false statements guess die false really. Cases up, testing up, deaths down. Wearing mask political. part problem. We've tried nothing we're ideas.

he's entirely, president help bring worst best people, especially mindless followers. would encouraged people take care other, wear mask help need, think difference would make ""lol masks, idiot! weak dying anyway! pussies!!!"" trump supporting assholes feel *empowered* openly assholes

quite different tone Yes trump rushing vaccine Europe Canada, need wait longer least Administration could done:
Not say virus version flu basically big deal.
Not sugar coat things say would fine Easter, summer, say would vaccine election day.
Wear mask. Trump's anti mask behavior means lot followers believe them.
Not interfere CDC collection data.
Not confiscate masks states.
There much more. mind, paying attention. Probably. corona. Maybe heart disease   fit suggest?

What peak/trough difference looking distinguish waves?

Do think ""third wave"" vs ""first"" spin?  Also notice southern states worst summer like Arizona, Texas, Florida states people spend time in-doors summer. hot go air-conditioning air-conditioning. Yep .. 30 days restrictions lifted bars restaurants. Halloween coming up, followed Thanksgiving Christmas .. gonna cluster fuck lovely FL. governor wants STOP reporting cases daily bad winter tourism. Meanwhile school school closing due infections we're stopping.
When passed us come Q2 next year vaccine, every politician put money first people's lives tried manslaughter. gross negligence criminal. Yeah it‚Äôs getting bad Europe Trust me, totally understand perception global landscape right great. 

90% people see grocery store runs work masked generally respective people maintaining space. really dealt restaurant bar scene many years can't speak much that. people want go work, get supplies, stay safe trying really hard even they've become worn so. point accept certain number stupid people behave recklessly endanger others. It‚Äôs hands don‚Äôt care anymore. Time get better friends! Yes may seem bad, need test Children, way administered children eventually, great spreaders virus school.

Plus, goal vaccine go herd immunity(through vaccine), people physically cant take Vaccine protected virus cant spread. dont vaccinate kids, people cant take vaccine arent going protected. Theoretical, now.

But viruses cause respiratory disease spread easily winter. Right now, there's real reason assume SARS-CoV-2 would different. Given pandemic ongoing nine months, tens millions confirmed infected, less five people known reinfected, think evidence extremely strong lasting immunity Covid.

In US, eight million people infected since March, single person known reinfected.

We know exactly long immunity lasts, think evidence overwhelming lasts least six months. think we've UBI made people work. Here's game plan successful countries used:

- Mandatory 14 day quarantine anyone traveling country.

- Temperature screening airports/ports/train stations. catch people showing symptoms, it'll catch are. little bit lower R0 counts.

- Mandatory masks crowded public spaces especially public transit. Fines jail refused.

- Contact trace cases, especially clusters. Quarantine connected cases.

- Make sure healthcare workers protected, give best PPEs front line fighters.

If follow program, pretty much wipe virus begins. Look Taiwan, Vietnam, etc. Even South Korea, never even fully stopped Chinese tourists visiting, dealing orders magnitude better us.

With US, current state, #1 step mandatory mask. Yes, means fines/jail refuse. game, we're looking hundreds thousands deaths winter, freedom show us ugly face supersede lives many others. always thought could hamdle pain went labor. Holy hell. pain world. Epidural FTW. I‚Äôm one ones what‚Äôs right going continue holidays. I‚Äôm going celebrations. read per capita bit right? stated tourists...that inbound citizens travelling returning..it biggest export earner cut sake health people...that real leadership does. situation totally comparable, whole world locked 6 weeks (like did), proper lockdown...not shitty partial lockdown did, would situation NZ in, hospitals cope contact tracing mop random cases occur. headline absolute garbage! Makes irrationally angry. first wave judged hospitalizations, ICU visits deaths. Positive cases USELESS metric testing extremely limited early months, cannot used basis comparison. intentionally misleading irresponsible. long directly hurting someone fine

quite literally boils this. majority people fine far, America alone, 220,000 people died fanned assymptomatic people spreading wearing face coverings generally socialising. turn assignments? Yet still ‚Äúdon‚Äôt lock us muh rights‚Äù...


This heartbreaking. thoughts ethics board, doctors end forced make decisions fly. one wants potential (probability) cause huge mental health crisis among healthcare workers. surge NYC something none colleagues ever forget. Although theoretically protected ethics boards, reality slow codes, etc. think every day rest life. 


I‚Äôm sorry country state in. people would wear masks social distance, wouldn‚Äôt issue. people weren‚Äôt damn selfish greedy wouldn‚Äôt issue. wish governor would lockdown since people clearly aren‚Äôt able make right choices themselves, result many trying right thing, including physicians, going suffer life altering consequences, many lose lives. sad.   messaging 1 day [**2020-10-26 20:15:09 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-10-26%2020:15:09%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

There‚Äôs mandatory testing know people get tested week want know. people know personally gotten tested someone they‚Äôve met gotten positive result notified everywhere they‚Äôve met etc. Doesn‚Äôt sound good 

I mean headline, nothing article That's everyone's plan now. countries appear completely failing deliberately misleading

...what? gonna go away next summer, hot weather. *its going miracle* experiencing surge deaths. Definitely flat, definitely free uptick, robustly 1% cases follows within 2-4 weeks. Much lower CFR Mar/april course testing nearly many infections.

All three countries higher daily average deaths whole EU August. rise three coming weeks least. people dying lockdown ? source? stopped putting much effort SARS vaccine virus killed longer threat. time dozens different efforts make vaccine basically experts agree vaccine within months. 

If vaccine NZ would wait world achieve herd immunity, would likely 2-3 years previous respiratory virus pandemics. Well alternative hardcore lockdown, lets say hope last die  Duh That's nothing. Spain, reached 1 million days ago. Population: 47 million. makes 2.12% population. France 1.49%.  Literally nothing you‚Äôve said contradicts epidemiological reasoning supporting recommendations OP link tho. 

And literally none details mentioned ‚Äúhidden‚Äù ‚ÄúWestern governments‚Äù imposed things like curfews various social mitigation mandates. 

Social mitigation guidelines include multiple steps **for reasons**. 

Air ventilation, close contact, singing v speaking, inside vs outside, covering coughs &amp; sneezes, length exposure, isolation positive patients, different masks different levels exposure risk, quarantines exposed close contact, even handwashing properly disinfect different surfaces. 

Most respectfully, don‚Äôt appear familiar purpose public mitigation guidelines, one important, mitigation effective multiple mitigation tools layered simultaneously.

Wear mask social distance. 

It isn‚Äôt confusing. 

Those two important social mitigation points. It‚Äôs literally *the least* anyone do. one ‚Äî both. Maybe I'm crazy, feel like strains somehow intensified contagiousness moving Europe. lot cultural differences, hard explain Japan way. hard explain stark difference somewhere like Germany (that basically everything ""right"" least right could given circumstances) somewhere like Vietnam. Neither island advantage. coordinated aggressive responses.

Even South Korea, they'd super spreader events clearly spread beyond contact tracing capacity several occasions, without even shutting able contain again.

Maybe governments really way, way better prepared, also think may dealing somewhat different disease. Sweden Sweden 17th deaths per capita? Who's seeing big uptick aswell? point 2k cases today comparable 2k cases even June whenever testing really started getting better. real stat look hospitalizations positivity rate. bad Utah is, fairly well run. pioneer spirit definitely lives on, there's room shit job Granny can't keep wagon gets left behind. Mormons weird, they're competent. Upside: person would come over.

Downside: might get coronavirus. 

Idk kind tough choice. Cold Flu season. tests picking inflating numbers now? really see danger millions gathering indoors hours, eating, laughing, etc. cases rising? saw spike Memorial Day, states reported spike Fourth July. different. hand, still possibility masks reduce viral load exposed to, may mean less severe symptoms.

This proposed (but afaik yet unverified) self-immunization effect mask wearing may help reduce mortality/hospitalization rates covid. many people still get covid, less severely. china already vaccine since january february. want could buy china. Spain we've hit 1 million cases population 47-48 million. fucked. Correct - masks work, false positives still keep rising. bug...these always happened, abnormal death counts...

...put quarter ass - played yourself. Yes, like duty protect country 9/11 lack imagination found cause. Susan Rice claimed nobody could foreseen events despite warnings. charts show case increases vs deaths: 

Spain: weeks, months. Winter hasn‚Äôt started yet Covid combined flu equals disaster. No, schools. read article one major newspapers mentioned two things: 1) Covid-19 seems survive longer lower temperatures, based studies, 2) people tend indoors (where spreads easier) colder. maybe something else forgot. links handy anymore, maybe someone else post them? anecdotally, know huuuuge group Chinese people decided visit Xinjiang national holiday year, want go crowded cities. might something it? village far outside touristy locations?  Ha! What? thought Covid19 can‚Äôt spread formites  0.05% 1/200, 1/20 calculation indicates. 

Your maths equivalent finding 5% 2.8m.

Let break down:

2,800,000 x 0.5 50% 2.8m, hence 1.4m

2,800,000 x 0.05 10x less this, 5% 2.8m, hence 140k (the calculation made)

2,800,000 x 0.005 10x less 5%, 0.5% mentioned OP.

I tried explain maths may shoddy way explaining hope clears up!  mutates infected people due random copy errors. infected people, chances mutations happen, including make less lethal. mutations reducing infectiousness good chance spreading reached people, chose keep transmission rate 1 (except countries). That's specific problem Covid19, people spread virus getting seriously ill.

Let's look average deaths per 100k inhabitants January September:

* 2015: 76,9 (0,79 %)
* 2016: 74,5 (-2,36 %)
* 2017: 75,1 (-1,57 %)
* 2018: 75,2 (-1,44 %)
* 2019: 70,3 (-7,86 %)
* 2020: 76,3

The average 2015-2019 74,4. However, things note. 2019 unusually low mortality, deviating noticeably preceding years.

This low mortality also carried 2020, January February even lower 2019, March near normal average. April (in particular) May exceeded normal mortality (102 April vs expected 76, 83 May vs expected 70).

June slight excess (72 vs expected 67), July September average. Oh yeah, random testing Britain America! Really two countries trust honest shit. Holy second wave batman. Hoping take quick drastic action get control. easier spread proven theoretical? refuse wear mask nose. enforcement masks. enforcement anything really, someone get offended. Agree.

Is chin? good news based observations. chin bad news. wonder got Right France definitely experiencing rapid surge actual infections. definitely expanded testing - deaths rising, hospitalizations rising, positivity risen substantially. time next month we'll ballpark level mortality current cases.

France may hit peak 1k deaths (they missing cases March April) might - even suffering around 500 deaths day likely coming November finishes, even peak cases start dropping tomorrow. (Up yesterday 7 day average daily deaths 179, 20 days ago 7 day average daily deaths 70 new cases around 11k).

Deaths going surge substantially across Europe too. surge infections hospitalizations clear that. Maybe high April peaks, significantly higher today (just 2k day last days, vastly higher summer, European cases typically 400 day EU deaths 150 day months) post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Actually seems false choice. People studied 1918 pandemic found communities quarantined earlier longer came ahead economically years later. amazing many similarities pandemics 100 years apart. Pretty much tools available now, masks social distancing.

/s focusing available resources distribution production, sooner get higher risk people healthcare workers less people die. 0 today earth talking about? I'm seeing old people walking alone street mask city. I've seen couples walking hand hand, clearly date, masks! dare you? Maybe surrounded assholes, maybe seen another living 9 months, fucking dare put everybody pot. people upvote kind shit.  Lol look European stats. MASSIVE spikes around. go ahead continue anti American rhetoric

E: France, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Italy come mind. Im sure many involves killing virus, nearly so. starve it, hospitalizations go down. highest deaths 2.5x many cases average compared UK.

Yes last days, - weeks likely 2.5x thereabouts many deaths UK consequence well.

The point people dying similar number corresponds fact cases similar number getting infected couple weeks ago (France little worse others compared - indications much worse quickly). Thanks, Sherlock. really idea proper way fake it.

For test come empty stomach, without using mouth wash, toothpaste disinfections. smoke beforehand, blow nose cough times.

Maybe help evil mastermind schemes little. Trump goes it. That's people called xenophobic used attack, Misleading again.

First, lots misconceptions article. example. say nurses can't performe oxygen threatment without doctors approval like something bad? course something doctor prescribes. 

But anyway.

The guideline said patients automatically sent hospitals got sick covid. strange att all, probably nursing homes work countries. provide care nursing homes well.

The critique Sweden guidelines strict cases people could actually benefited hospital care oxygen threatment. Yeah, unfortunately occured weeks ago well. problem is, even educated, smart part society thinking way. Including expat friends went best schools States elsewhere. I'm hard time coping days. mean I‚Äôm giving exact examples. many nfl/mlb players think tested positive? acting like number 1000s. It‚Äôs quite lower think. EU hard lockdown, boost testing capacity contact tracing. Plus, everyone mom borders open tourism. hard lockdown without steps is, we're seeing now, waste time goal actually suppress COVID. really, really hope American. 

Mask laws would purview states, neither enumerated implied power Congress. Well, countries testing limited number, symptoms super widespread, *majority* tests could return positive. 

We kind saw effect early days. nightmare scenario could go 50% tests positive country spread actually goes full exponential without effective measures slow it. 

I‚Äôm sure France approaching it‚Äôs test capacity yet, current trend lines don‚Äôt look good. wave looks worse first even allowing massive underreporting first time. idiots still claim lockdown legally go yo restaurants, bars, gyms Even go shopping mall ir wish.

All idiots started crying cannot go out, since end July activities allowed cry babies. Boo hooooo poor little victim, born wealthiest nation earth prosperous time history really hard. would wrong. Take look indecency laws require pants. None struck supreme court. Makes sense. I've avoided gyms since started. getting cold live half state repealed mandated mask wearing probably avoid safe. Going find something home exercise. Vaccine always going option. Links government showing government honest? understand logic here. think smart. Who's one emotional here? Also, exactly arguing? There's inherent risk everything life, mitigate risks depending situation. cars, seatbelts, covid wear masks social distance.

But, analogy driving car amount risk getting covid stupid wildly illogical. example, driving car risk pushing hospital systems brink capabilities, obviously bad everyone.

Overwhelming hospitals real possibility. state published data predicts putting hospitals considerable strain reverse current upward trend.

I know want pretend covid issue live life freely without regard anyone yourself, actions real consequences affect people. past, lame-duck administrations still tried govern even anything long-term. doubt Trump loses, nothing address situation, he'll actively make worse. Ok? disagree people. Sigh drove DE/PA border day go empty office seen inside since early March, going Wilmington Philly, two decent sized cities (in blue swing state)... saw many Trump signs, drove past mini roadside Trump rally guy waiving confederate flag one end... anyone France‚Äôs hospitalizations / ICU graphs (for whole pandemic) hand? imagine France also seeing massive spike hospitalizations, I‚Äôm curious see compares spring wave.  people say demonstrably false multiple countries stopped widespread community transmission?

Edit: Unfortunately alot people sub saying complete seriousness. example, see dumbass responded islands. cancer patients going doctors nurses overwhelmed covid patients? get covid die they're immuno compromised? Sure thing need ramp-up production vaccine fast Obviously there‚Äôs nothing back up, that‚Äôs actually really interesting hypothesis haven‚Äôt seen heard anywhere before. Pretty unusual point see novel speculation virus isn‚Äôt along lines fake, precautions nothing, safer media makes be. Yes - many thousands athletes.
Again, ""this one guy, one guy"" data. Oh man. bad. read wrong. thought 50% soap 50% alochol. bad. 

I think produce 3-5% soap fine. start August, approximately 200 people Portugal (pop 10MM) testing positive day. Today 2500 new cases.

Well done Victoria seeing through. Lockdowns work. Lol I'd die next pandemic sort emergency event 45 minute ambulance ride shitty regional hospital compared 10 minutes away best hospitals world.

Also despair can't drive I'd completely isolated. suspect Americans change much thanksgiving, things change probably amount much. God I'm tired shit. Every single thread. new surge.

""IT'S FINE. KEEP SAYING 2 WEEKS EVERYTHING FINE"" Followers Penn State football able overlook horrible things long football happens? brand new thing them.  
No offense students parts university connected past administration allowed horrible things happen, unpaid players get injuries hurt loved ones life. yuck. We'll forget like forget tragedies past month. Remember Beirut explosion? Aussie wildfires? We've building towards this, next year next year. 

Climate change barely reared ugly head. U.S. election, either Trump win get 4 years insanity 4 years humanity digging grave bit deeper, Biden winning. see monsters come woodwork last 4 years eager go back hiding. They've much fun. I‚Äôm sure goalposts effortlessly moved yet  France highest deaths 2.5x many cases average compared UK. Maybe young people beginning infected. think gets prevalence France eventually gets wider community, means deaths, unfortunately. mean... US? look heart issues mlb handful- that‚Äôs large sample size. 

One best pitchers MLB missed season heart issues due Covid- know players missing major time myocarditis weren‚Äôt quite famous.

Yeah well get point already failed. county? honestly like one better. Well done. comes close last lockdown

The scary thing end October, there's 5 months harsher weather ahead. understand want impose harsher lockdown again, good population two months lockdown surely lead another surge Spring comes polls showing Cox easy victory. much change pandemic front, unfortunately. best estimates INFECTION fatality rate 0.6% +/- 0.3%

What's source that? I've seeing [following best estimates IFR years: years: years: years: 0.054 They‚Äôve months, yeah. many people wearing masks time Alaska, observations? Doctors actually even wearing consultations parts U.S. avoid losing patients. Finally fucking good news, think need sub. Bad headline. Given number catastrophes unfolding, Covid-19 likely remembered test readiness willingness adapt, test many nations developed West failed. Shit, ""wave"" going bigger earlier, started goes pretty much anything UK gov touching years. Good luck Brexit. would've different political message something like ""Wearing mask Patriotic Duty combat invisible Chinese enemy."" even give shit politicians labeled Chinese long people rallied together save America. Americans! freedoms. rights. Wearing mask shows patriotism greatest country world - United States America.

FUCK inspiring type. Address points presented please try obfuscate poor analogies: majority current infections less 50 IFR far lower, good job isolating elderly. simply early course pandemic call country success failure. past week two showed.

However still say certain countries absolutely worse. US serious issue, example, see second wave ramp like Europe seeing now. serious issue.

But it‚Äôs appropriate sign success failure pandemic over. disease hasn‚Äôt even really got going yet Haha. Tried kept falling refused talk days endüòúü§™ Problem many kids get it, show symptoms. still pass though. 

I assume many picking schools going home parents. I'm truly wondering it'll get anorher lockdown it'll local responses instead. One towns near Hotspot mayor implementing capacity limits everything. Right? I‚Äôm sure Minnesota won‚Äôt mind extra earthquakes result fracking next door. They‚Äôre understanding. Closing resturants making people wear face mask isnt ""fascist"" lmfao. Ugh fuck. white collar type office job pretty much 100% job involves emails zoom meetings. 

But boss, boomer, thinks ‚Äúpeople work effectively office‚Äù every day put mask, go office, sit office replying emails meeting people zoom. 

It‚Äôs fucking stupid done home problem. takes fly Shanghai business, straight family member:

Final covid test 2 days end quarantine lol dude same, neighbors think im crazy WANT like Czechia? America's land borders closed sine march. Mexico Canada also handling COVID better. What's argument? know american area somehow referenced football field attitude. Doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt. don‚Äôt want control it.   countries even worse? deserve sanctions well? I'm curious, from? Also, 1 day old account. Nice. agenda Could please specific? [Spain going back emergency six that's strange... thought Spain supposed *success* story US.

Precisely problem comparing countries others terms well handled pandemic. in, ""Country better Country B."" Many European nations, notoriously Italy others Spain well, used considered examples successful contact tracing, i.e. role models US. rhetoric died recent weeks, however, owing resurgence cases countries, even though locked fast hard. Exactly 88,973 two days row? Impressive.

(I realize that's headline means, saying) Round round go, never moving forward. (C)opyright Trump Company I've bought genuine 3m N95s elastomeric respirators ebay. I've bought genuine KF94s ebay.

There's fakes, yes, buy legit gear smart it.

Frankly judging post history think comment may self interest. Yes, United States fell apple tree fall far, definitly must gotten brain damage fall. ‚Äúfascists‚Äù opposing fascistic government overreach? Holy crap majority Swedes supprt batshit experiment.

Sweden corrupt core. goverment, citizens, every part society. Halloween ? people partying

Waiting election night gonna like season eight again. want bring everybody make feel like yourself. miserable bitter loner that's likely never close woman (or anybody matter). going die lonely poor.

Assumption.

I'm sure English works whatever miserable hovel probably live in, speculation.

I also took liberty reviewing post history generally antagonistic, I'll go ahead end conversation. tell people get help mean it. think safe say adamant mask-wearer feels like surrounded idiots US. crowd density bar wilmot North Dakota awful high compared bar Manhattan people go looking entertainment.

Gay men north dakota used drive OKC hit gay bars 

I know people western dakota would drive minot Montana look fun able see gran wanted (she's lockdown conditions across ocean) Facebook messenger least still check in. Lol idea would imagine I'd decline invite well. great life. much New Zealand give federal monetary aid hospitals Covid death? People definitely still wearing masks China. Everything else true though. MN sugar ND though, feel bad us ND sending hospital overflow us since managed keep filling up. Dude nephew travel sports team usually big tournament weekend November. Everyone staying hotel, parents partying together, etc. shocked told still happening, definitely going year Ah good old ""they arent members defunct national socialist party germany arent nazis"".

Right ""fascists"" then. Happy? remember right, one shot... awesome! right way. great! Well, daily cases easiest-to-measure leading indicator serious problems. significant percentage daily cases turn hospitalizations (within week so) deaths (within month so). better treating disease (which pushes percentages some), point medical system gets overwhelmed deaths rise.

Plus, cases beget cases geometrically, unless mitigating measures place. Lol guy thinking winter. 

Get back January I've started full conversations myself. need human contact point soon. agree. Windsor. never report 10 cases day here. Hopefully stays way. lot early mostly longterm care migrant workers. cleared patch yard play dogs, there's new snow today. definitely could predicted it, ton people did. virtually public health crisis like this, poor people pretty much always higher risk crippled killed diseases like this. goes double grand ol United States America, people die heart attacks home, knowing hours what's killing them, expensive take ambulance hospital receive life-saving medical treatment. 

A lot people would rather take gamble whatever disease they've got develop life-threatening territory instead going doctor save themselves, go, they're saddled thousands dollars medical bills, even (and especially) suffer grueling hospital stay. states, die, families get medical bill funeral costs. numbers go election regardless voted in.

Umm lets ignore stupid posted focus this. Numbers go election, *regardless* elected. someone wont elected election... death rate bullets brain 0% ignore everyone who‚Äôs ever shot. 

I would absolutely dumbfounded IFR entire population, cherry picking, ended outside range presented. Sure, ignore groups people (like entire population age 50, did) likely contribute IFR it‚Äôs going ~0. new me. forced shut down. yet tell single business actually shut down. list, can't see single one. aware economy collapsing everything closing. But, yet again, due shut downs, there's pandemic people dying one wearing mask. hate admit keep referring mythical ""shut down"" cause, when, fact, nothing shut down. Again, reiterate, agree everything closing economy dying, mean ""shut down"". literally every economist public health official predicted would happen *DIDN'T* shut down. that's precisely happened. want shut well fine, one. guess what, everythings gonna close anyways that's happens stubborn want stay open let everyone get infected. going magically keep coming store option stay open. mean ""shut down"". means pandemic responded poorly too. Even strict lockdown, right? forget states like us Wisconsin Governor Evers trying keep virus bay stay home order, mask mandate limited capacities indoor facilities GOP controlled assembly Senate fought overturn them. like we're one worst states country right infection rate anything. yes good job even worse beginning. germany politics take time. already time another lockdown. start act like beginning pandemic we'll never get rid virus even get little bit controle back become endemic? Here‚Äôs science, combat ‚Äúhoping‚Äù vaccine. Stop hoping take action regain control lives. actively relinquishing civil liberties hopes Schools remote MD (at least counties bulk cases) cases still going rate similar states. Many European nations, notoriously Italy others Spain well, used considered examples successful contact tracing, i.e. role models US. rhetoric died recent weeks, however, owing resurgence cases countries. assumption riven children they're largely asymptomatic really catch it.

I‚Äôd say 99% people sub already knew coming. 

I went pick food day. walked bathroom people looking like insane mask on. call average ~800-1000 deaths per day way down.

So might 1000 hospitalizations per day. many people major transmissible pandemic life time. Yes, AIDs definitely major pandemic transmissible every day life. Theres reason always compared covid-19 Spanish flu. reason weve never anything similar time period. anything pandemics like Swine Flu Sars taught us arent big deal live life normally, backfired case assumed covid-19 would same. basically talking lifetime type pandemic here.  Yeah never heard that. Everyone sees failure. literally worst numbers world. Travel London....seriously!  likely right side history present choices. party really hard make over. Lol right!?

averafe time testing positive death way less 8 weeks. states aren‚Äôt reporting weekend could 100 k Tuesday reports catch lost 3 family members covid19 complications. Thought bible reference second üòÅ Dude single people absolutely shat last 7 months. shame people socializing, shut every social venue, gave 3/4 population fear strangers. people rightfully say they're lonely, they're told ""deal it."" Rounding corner 1...2...3.... prevalent? France 7 day average daily death 179 (up yesterday). Daily cases 2 weeks ago averaged 16k (again 7 day average). Highest deaths reported month 298.

UK 7 day average daily death 151. Daily cases 2 weeks ago 14k. Highest deaths reported month 251.

Spain 7 day average daily death 138. Daily cases two weeks ago 10k. Highest deaths reported month 261.

Spain's daily reporting erratic death rates broadly similar two.

Poland outlier cases death - 7 day average daily death 118, cases two weeks ago 4k. Italy, 7 day daily average death 106, daily cases 2 weeks ago 4k.

Of these, France highest daily average total deaths, surely going surge ahead significantly coming couple weeks least. course could turn tide quickly someone else could catch fast. get mine 24-48 hours usually. count deaths cause covid -- even difficult. people want hear indirect causes give excuses claim fake. true would mean initial stage hence caught time. outnumber every large mammal. many us causing climate change possible mass extinction event. epoch named us it.

Well dont know false positive. recently country. many reported case reinfected 1-2 months recovery. 

You got reinfected too? Welp. Get well soon Good. Shame plague also found countries year (although happens regularly believe). Westnijlvirus also discovered summer Netherlands. can't imagine would happen really shitty turn events we'd deal 2 pandemics üòÖ starting see evidence schools actually aren‚Äôt bad.

In case, trying say infected birds cause concern - seeing bird flu pop seems perfect fit godforsaken year. Chicago released statement saying 2 3 new cases social home visits. New Jersey Converting freedom units.

In last message diasgreed 2 things. First ""since June"" Sweden less deaths usual. Graph link quite clearly shows true. second thing link proves less deaths even July later months. data period link.



I also disagreeing phrased messages general, emphasise many deaths less actually seen, reality minimal explained various ways. also point extremely many people died months happened ""couple"" months speaks of. Statistics used propaganda spread false ideas adressed. beside point guess. Ccp never lies. eighteen years since SARS. Covid SARS-CoV-2 versus OG SARS-CoV-1.

You failure. tell truth everything right? bad true. Sweden policy let people die.

That policy. Im sure people find hard believe.

All kinds crazy shit happening. England policy sending people hospital *to* nursing homes even good chance infected. England one countries Europe performing worse Sweden. Thats kind nonsense seeing.

Macron surely knows going lockdown soon. Since promised would able avoid second lockdown though waiting last minute, hospitals already overloaded. cost 10s thousands lives wont save France penny pride massively outweighs whatever instead conscience. France may yet overtake Sweden deaths per capita. kind immoral fools leading Europe moment. already cancelled christmas. hard. pandemic yet. 8 9 months. Hopefully things continue get worse, time tell.  huge cluster yes can. Even stretched resources low testing one event driving 100s 1000s infections figure out. Look quickly even press figured meat packing facilities driving local outbreaks back March. We‚Äôll need flash, even strained health department greater testing tracing ability back Spring. Agreed, rest assured, public space without mask since beginning, set company 100% remote end January, meet enclosed space alternative.

However, see people trying compromise everywhere, that, enough data. Also, people believe measures backed stats, explanations real-world examples.

I'm alone this, one four large German research societies quite harshly demanded ending lack reasoning addressing public. desperately need data efficiency.

It might well be, described listing, highly effective single measure, thirds aerosol, direct droplets, fomites, work, home, leisure activities.  ...Which exactly something federal government could do. Second this. People gulf coast completely ignoring now. even catch careless one give fuuuuuck.  Saying $1200 meant ""to live on"" ludicrous Republicans saying Biden's healthcare plan socialized medicine.

That stimulus check. stimulating economy, largely failed large percentage Americans *didn't* lose jobs make solid paycheck simply pocketed money continued on. make $36K grad student even that. relief package +$600/week unemployment, actually pretty decent deal lot people.

I understand people going talking point we've got congress refuses pass *actual* second relief package despite CARES act benefits expiring long ago. Driving car contagious requires license prove capable. Coronavirus contagious infect anyone. That's fucking distinction, wise guy.  Germany idea closed borders yet.

You anyway quite significant transmission within borders, cases abroad make difference, making life harder people living close border, anyway probably low terms % infected. ‚ÄúSome may die, that‚Äôs price I‚Äôm willing take.‚Äù Lord Farquaad, Shrek 1.

AL multiple huge outbreaks whether kids school not. I‚Äôm familiar TN thought post Memorial Day surge (when kids weren‚Äôt school).

Not mention saw cases surge - kicked bang college students returning. craziest thing students state kicked 1000+ person case count. pretty much undergrads living within 1-2 blocks campus. surge nothing elementary schools, nothing, nada, zip. Eventhough university major supplier student teachers local elementary schools , still nothing. Even local businesses undergrads frequented weren‚Äôt impacted. pretty much self contained parties late age teenagers/early 20s attending without masks. risk kid could die life-long condition like asthma exposure. kid care hated me, allowed expose vaccine out. asthma, made life much difficult care explain.

Yeah, clear actually kids. offense, really, allowing go vaccine arrives? Good luck that. two kids, aged 4 6, spent two months quarantined back March schools daycare closed. Sure fun games first end, miserable! Kids age need around kids age, need play, need learn. keep seeing people mention long term effects COVID _might_ (and yes, have, unfortunate people), seem mention psychological effects quarantined. I'm grownup handle it, kids, especially brutal. 

Obviously take virus seriously, act know. data research point seems indicate that:

* Kids sometimes get COVID, 1-5% people diagnosed covid children
* get less symptoms, less severe symptoms adults
* They're often asymptomatic
* Very, guidelines ""CDC"".) 

Basically, kids aged 12 so, seem much cause concern point. do? keep kids home possibly many months come, seriously hindering development crucial age slowly driving everyone family closer insanity time passes by? risk point likely there? send school socialise kids learn valuable skills, knowing small risk might catch COVID chances developing serious symptoms, all, very, small?

I mean, sounds easy, keep home! actually situation. suddenly choose lesser two evils.  jobs pay enough one person able feed entire family. systematically castrated make shit wage, do. never able afford kid.

Hard say. Financial pressure may force open. Abilene got contingency plans. We‚Äôre sending everything hospitals. can‚Äôt fly right winds nasty cold front heading in. Plan take local nursing home (NH) hallways Med/Surg patients. shunt OB away OB nursing float Med Surg NH. currently full divert surgical. Pre-Op Post Op becomes second ICU try transfer out. There‚Äôs talk mobile site set National Guard assisting, thankfully aren‚Äôt yet. 

We hospital Covid tests. accepting hospital run give clinical diagnosis transfer based that. shouldn‚Äôt affect us PPE perspective aren‚Äôt intubating patients. lose lab 2/2 people sick overwhelmed point care tests only. goal transfer, transfer, transfer. Preserve staff hospital care local residents. hospital added additional name tag coded security doors ER, keep visitors out, provide us protection family members get violent. 

It sobering plan. NY too! NYC, live upstate. Although urban area upstate. sure it‚Äôs like rural areas. Monday give numbers weekend. Might lower. Agreed. question become whether ability deal match pace virus. results far, around world, encouraging. completely agree. 

You could make effective convincing case getting past cultural wall, like trying pole-vault mine field. 

Prosecutors want try case work cops regular basis depend different ways.  go r/conservative kind bat shit crazy theories upvoted daily basis.

If truly intend something sarcasm try using ‚Äú /s ‚Äú, otherwise way telling crazies. Wonder anything side-effects. first emerged possible cure, apparently concerns causing birth defects. following news though. Well, least next day two better weekend slowdown! mean, typically is, maybe we're new territory now. Yeah masks better others. Please remember keep discussion topic. Off-topic political discussion allowed per Rule 4. Thank you! Lmao one saying follow rules, lazy looking handouts outrageously racist positions liberal gun owners? Sure.

Is common? much. idk read thread masks Driving considered privilege.

Just human - ""Nice job, we've turned corner too.""

US turned corner alright, set daily record nearly 84k infections one day...well done.../s

I'm sure record hospitalisations deaths follow soon. Fucken embarrassing Sounds like prime candidates taking extra precautions. 99.99% true Hours argument makes sense. assuming school closing inevitable. It‚Äôs not. Also asymptomatic spread extremely unlikely. healthy kid beaten COVID goes back school, doesn‚Äôt pass covid anyone chain transmission broken. likely scenario. It‚Äôs science man. Honestly family probably Covid now. ducking way would get tested, especially since everyone cares cases, cases, cases. believe black hispanics ability follow rules races have. racist believes blacks hispanics smart enough follow rules. see bunch metal staples help covid know mutation is! Thankfully mutates slowly. Unlike influenza mutates rapidly. 

Guess gonna ignore whole part immune systems recognizing based exposure coronaviruses. mutation virus would also recognized.... Yep... I've lost friendship too. would probably lived Ohio long still know many people. locked nursing homes went full isolation time... think August 1 reopened them? Gov made pointed announcement proud ""we could see elderly again."" wise decision. must fundamentally misunderstood cell line is, link points derived cells cultured human foetus lol was, time, short-term bout depression toward end last year. anti-depressants months, ended right February felt depression.

Then came COVID like movie Airplane, ""I picked bad time stop anti-depressants!"" Oh, get ready Florida, still multiple super spreader events coming too! Halloween, college football rivalry games, thanksgiving, course sun set really early, meaning people less outdoor activities, instead opting indoor activities like going 100% capacity bars restaurants. Next weekend current rate. 

Let's say 1% die. means every day thousand people's death sealed in.

Iam sure mortality days. Probably less? Historical precedent. epidemics one way another. No? Well, here's thing. (Vietnam) share border China infected case quite early. community spread second wave. However, also take really seriously find quarantine every point contact found. one's country take grain salt wait spread around, fault.
I understand hard position others economically. could 3 weeks intense lock done it. they're stuck rock hard place already butt hurt laws. declined take precautions seriously. Shut Swedish goon.

What get defensive? No, every disease world like that's part getting. go look bird working see pretty sure baby everybody I'm one would seem statistically unlikely.

You're confusing common viruses like chickenpox get immunotherapy. Even flu strain get particular flu strain immune life, flu vacates faster almost anything else that's keeps coming back. coronavirus antibodies drop get virus again. that's coronavirus's way making sure get easily eradicated since usually fairly genetically stable. Can't wait headline: ""Short Lived""  Try shift blame someplace else. I'm shocked found way something simultaneously communism cronyism propose straight face. Yep, sadly lot people going die. say get rid dakotas call Montana make PR DC states. touching mask constantly, changing frequently way less effective. Also air conditioning anecdotally moves virus quite well, keep mind malls etc. come UK/Ireland failed poorly? 


And makes wonder Hawaii shut airports. Swedish ignore him. brainwashed goon. Exactly three, Taiwan particular distinction impose lockdown citizens ever since pandemic started, democratic society boot! want point man literally charge covid taskforce. Vietnam Thailand stopped spread reaching 5000 cases.

Read 

"" people tend forget that, except China countries suppressed virus START, even reaching 10000 cases intense community spread , countries great islands "" So, everyone going while? Eh, need spend time entertaining sites. Loeffler‚Äôs team would provide names staffers, date positive tests displaying symptoms illness. office also say staffers direct interaction senator Loeffler planned take additional precautions. Swedens number ass, stfu swede. Dont grandma kill. wish shut ones neighbourhood. They‚Äôre super crowded every single night. People even drinking standing there‚Äôs seats available. Zero social distancing course. Wow 137 tested positive, that's worry. know Dakotans, usually dislike parents, stick nursing homes, wait pins needles inheritance. many people talk inheritance constantly parents nowhere near dead. imagine many people salivating thought. Swedes brainwashed morons know.

Thats need international consequences them. Force Swedes snap make something. It‚Äôs everywhere. Absolutely everywhere. I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs happening I‚Äôm numb. live Chicago lost restaurants. Took extremely immunocompromised father law vacation home Wisconsin April rode summer. it‚Äôs hitting Wisconsin family. Aunt medically induced coma 3 weeks due Covid. uncle apparently got doctor prescribe hydroxychloroquine he‚Äôs handing around family. don‚Äôt know fuck going anymore. Buy supplies stay home 3-4 weeks protect family close loved ones. Christians thinking verse everything abso-fucking-lutely bonkers complete joke way go living morally. That's interesting. Sweden prevalence covid among people various professions investigated teachers actually underrepresented among infected.

It's likely either cultural difference Sweden Italy makes schools dangerous open there, something else entirely driving schools opening coincidence. It‚Äôs like little column little column B. legitimate reasons China this. No, Americans won‚Äôt understand, unable comprehend country different social problems do. also things China legitimate, bad.

Usually happens USA (and reddit) people vilify China wrong things. Like, yes - ways super awful - ways CCP awful reality quite different portrayal west

My experience always Chinese government far negligent ineffective give credit Technical said put UV inside, maybe oral opportunity created, less fun generally accepted long teleworking protected international law, pandemic continue. PERIOD already seen cases, Utah, parents refusing kids tested keep numbers lower really are. truly insane. think good chance might mutate houses, reading virus appears mutated oddly transferring bats way lets fold proteins differently previous coronaviruses means outcome may unpredictable method fires using innovative usual. Hopefully winds meaning there's also easier way block entirely antibodies. Gj Sweden killed everyone vulnerable early. 

Why Swedes fucking like this? brainwashed are.you? Mormons famous procreating double standard around caffeine. also president acting like doesn‚Äôt exist rallies governors like kemp, desantis, noem, abbot etc say won‚Äôt anymore restrictions muh freeedomsss There's cases many Australian states... NZ get attention? Well yes. I‚Äôm happy well. area neighbors. That‚Äôs good directly responding claim coronavirus deaths help unemployment rate, isn‚Äôt true since vastly disproportionately affects elderly working-age persons.

The culture basically forces together said. 
I also think it‚Äôs interesting notice phenomenon people like around other, that‚Äôs might normally congregate, trying distance? example, went walking along beach small seaside town. walked 10km total. everyone stop relax/enjoy beach? Literally one cluster. Spaced properly, granted, think it‚Äôs interesting. whole distance, tiny spot. sort notice bit lack creativity finding less populated places, desire around others. Sweden doesnt count accuratly, rediculous lag shit. yes Sweden may urbanized cities far eachother. Again, secondary cluster. first point contact virus *outside* home. initial person working safe environment PPE universal mask usage social distancing, might exposed virus. would prevent people home getting it. noticed going something like this: 
it's Chinese virus, concerne us.
It's Asian virus, concern us.
It's Italian/French virus, concern us.
It's Tessin Romandie, concern us.
It's big cities like Z√ºrich, concern us.

Guess - mentality Corona hotspot Muotathal places! Yes period numbers keep going too. exactly news. try flatten curve never going stop spread infection true developed Nation. PAPR

Powered Air Purifying kit. Freedom comes cost. uncle's ex wife passed morning think covid morphed less lethal less contagious version. good friend mine someone come stay house (he pick girlfriend visiting summer). coughing lot asked tested covid, said had. 3 days staying small cabin, girlfriend asked way home really tested, said no. made get tested got back state positive. girlfriend ended getting mild case. friends, literally coughing hacking home 3 days PPE (since said tested negative) never got it.

edit: friend husband quarantined two weeks multiple tests done. tridemic! COVID, flu, C. auris. link: coronavirus reached heart White House more, less week Election Day, scorches nation president‚Äôs top aide says ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going control pandemic.‚Äù ...

Pathetic. sister daycare, one kids tested positive sent everybody home quarantine. late tested positive day later. 100k must corner referring to.  analogy, comment bulletproof vests work. 

Then don‚Äôt compare two things operate entirely Ballistic Limit metric designed specifically find 50% shots specific velocity would penetrate armor. 

Yes create CLASS armour described. Congratulations know google. still doesn‚Äôt make analogy make sense. point measures kind work severe problem often work well less severe problem.

If social distancing masks work, rise cases? Perhaps it‚Äôs masks don‚Äôt actually work? still chance infection everyone one person wearing mask. reduces, eliminate, chance infection. entire reason also lockdowns, social distancing regular disinfection, layered defense secure.

This consideration 99% people catch Covid live, generally, survival rate actually goes depending age. isn‚Äôt Ebola, bad cold. bad, suggest is, come co-morbidities make large amount deaths? Covid deaths? Well ask yourself, number bigger.

But see complicated require degree critical thinking understand people hard time it. understand  peopke talk living fear, etc..., etc... Fear response right drive reproduce cokes survival species.

""This review obtained clues basic research viruses understand novel SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 virus might generate pathogenic effects male fertility. highlighted male fertility might highly vulnerable SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 infection. Infection novel virus seriously threatens individual's overall health, also might lead male infertility."" mean, we're 800,000 cases day we'll herd immunity March. less now, moment next President sworn numbers highest they've ever Republicans say ""Biden's handling Covid worse Trump's! Look high numbers are!"" wondering thing. It‚Äôs cheaper Remdesivir it‚Äôs available tablets well. Im really interested wether contain it, Xinjiang really cold now, almost winter like conditions.  im sure completely honest results /s tool roughly estimate chances contracting Covid-19 given variables location, activities (taking bus, getting haircut, etc), precautions taken (masks, handwashing, etc)? people seem agree say mostly back normal spring USA Well, they'd probably slack can/slacked young. probably projection. said started ramping couple days ago. demonstrates disingenuous whole political discussion travel bans.

Banning individual countries basically work due nature international air travel, get tourist visa stop third country, skirt country ban. way stop disease coming set quarantine airports make mandatory.

If disease already present communities, what's far important ability control internal movement like this, localized outbreak contained full power public health system. Countries like Canada got better internal firewalls, whereas USA south governors screaming bloody murder act war states started talking restricting interstate traffic. possible fact impossible regain smell? Ive lost 95% taste smell...My wife cool im melting lol. uptick US spread. Considering tourists get Florida coming eventually. Even uptick currently know Winter going really hurt Florida year. I'm confused. Based article (or that's took living people ventilators, basically killed them, make space patients). Please correct read wrong. using google translate read article. Hi, yes I'm SK... official article slovak restrictions (use google translate) shoud leave SK without problem, depend citizen visitor want go back day not... Otherwise expect negative test.  Wait. country going herd immunity? Conveniently forgot mention Denmark since they‚Äôre facing second wave atm lol... invested trashing one country specifically? It‚Äôs we‚Äôll likely see many countries jump around stats coming 6 months! reports usually weekends I've heard

And see what's going slow momentum next months You‚Äôre wrong, weigh areas means managing pandemic? 10k infections mean NYC compared location? focusing opening locking numbers? answer somehow:

1: massive test based communities. urban areas, local communities ensure residents get tested. rural areas, periodical tests taken week. find positive cases.

2:Once positive, sent covid fever clinic get free treatment, that, contact tracing find get virus, quarantine people closely contacted, matter positive negative. Positive cases directly sent fever clinic get cured negative cases quarantined specific hotel 14 days. 

So, 10 people tested negative quarantined individual hotel room 14 days, day 1 day 13 extra PCR tests make sure still negative.  sounds like reasonable chance vaccine (or maybe one) pass muster December. would welcome. start, expect healthcare workers, first responders vulnerable seniors vaccinated first. Production, distribution general use /and patient uptake take least several months. 

Because America's current administration continues choose work toward controlling virus's spread, things going get much, much worse get better. 500,000 dies COVID complications February. yet seen estimate going say June, probably earliest vaccines might sufficiently widespread use slow pandemic meaningfully. people dying surge infections coincides flu winter. saying vaccine coming winter? We've coronavirus before, silly. common family viruses. *novel* coronavirus concern limited prior immunity it.

&amp;nbsp;

Either way, substantiate claims made post above. Please read article. wonder many people getting re-tested initially testing positive. know time go health department test spell name wrong plainly spelling getting birthday wrong saying slowly loudly them. close borders, people went holidays summer lockdown(did true lockdown). helpt all. Curfews means nothing. Virus spreading poor ventilation. Could work, restaurant stuffy home multiple generations. Take vitamins, wear mask, wash hands, social distance. Good luck. understand. cannot ‚Äúnormal‚Äù without vaccine effective distributed efficiently. 

Just people continue go eat, shit mean ceased activities concern suddenly return. 

There normal vaccine arrives. Everything else panic band aid fixes. economy continue bleed shed jobs goal vaccine acquired met read 4 separate strains before. I've heard potential one Europe, way determine actually separate strains sequencing. source? evidence support that? making assumption extremely limited data. Masks help, unclear exactly much, especially seasonal shift. 

It unlikely masks plus lower natural Rt due warm weather summer indeed sufficient prevent spread. unclear still case seasonal shift. 

Peru - exactly notoriously cold climate outside Puno Cusco June/July/August - mask mandate since March relatively compliant population. realize make news subreddit much Euro-American sphere, still highest death per capita non-city state countries despite - means perfect - ""everything right"". 

There course structural differences US Europe relative Peru terms base level hygiene maturity healthcare system, point clear masks alone sufficient control virus. two studies showing effective. trial run company part approval process. Based studies submitted company approval, drug benefit. literally every drug ever approved. Time new ones guess. /s kept bars closed would bars anymore would bancrupt. Yeah... Like 99% get care... rationing dont space care... Well hooe got covid early enough spot... Otherwise enjoy dying home hospital hallway gasping air.

May deadly peak resources... deaths start stack start needing triage deserves air ventalators first Oh god president failed miserably waves phases now. Masks reduce transmission something like 70%, relies everyone it. South korea got virus around time US did. less 500 deaths compared 225,000+ america. 

Americans boner individualism, see actually means lift finger bare minimum help fellow citizen. Love customers work get face pull mask ask stupid question. Fucking idiots. Sad though China probably still safest place pandemic. really said ‚Äúfuck it, it‚Äôs hard‚Äù  infections deaths get vaccine, people die need to. Holy shit really?!?!? üòÆü§Ø get teeth checked twice year, get vaccine, too. question vaccinated first.

You need care Trump, he's one rather deny virus deal it.

I looked status maps. numbers seem low, restrictions soon reduced / lifted. I'm Germany, one worst spots people still want stop spreading it.  all. questions?  feeling 45 bail country clear lost *bigly*, wait January 20 ceremoniously hand keys front door. Pence also stick around? feeling also prosecuted Trump's crimes humanity, might bail taking fall T. leaves Pelosi office till Jan 20. insane ok! Companies don‚Äôt give shit health need work done Remindme! January 1 read someone knows downvoted read rosenstein limited scope Barr limited time.

We experts lending credibility processes stating things facts. possibly something unsaid behind statement. 

I trust nothing government every time believe expert later find work windowless room filter input data.

Edit. Clarity referring Mueller investigation found later controlled politically. chinese ppl still traveling across globe, business pleasure. Remember, pcr &amp; rapid antigen tests lag time, window 3 6 days viral load low tests register. Unless government requires foreign travelers test &amp; retest entering, forced quarantine wait, going miss emergent asymptomatic cases. Thank you! Same, self-report high risk continue work home. am. They're requiring wear masks desk. guess viruses can't cross imaginary boundaries something? also can't meet anyone person use zoom. there's really point anyway. peopke take living fear, etc..., etc... Fear response right drive reproduce cokes survival species.

22 September review obtained clues basic research viruses understand novel SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 virus might generate pathogenic effects male fertility. highlighted male fertility might highly vulnerable SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 infection. Infection novel virus seriously threatens individual's overall health, also might lead male infertility."" He‚Äôs talking excess mortality doughnut. Nobody‚Äôs denying lot (6000+ fact!) people passed due covid, look excess mortality year months following early summer much lower overall deaths. 

The economy aspect harder judge - mean, we‚Äôre export focused, economy going hit matter what. Comparing us neighbors also runs fact economies different. Picture likely won‚Äôt clear spring 2021 - [Moodys example thinks Sweden outperform European neighbors, it‚Äôs finalized also pretty laughable judge strategy based false assumption ever economy - FHM don‚Äôt deal economics economic factors aren‚Äôt even part models lmao. Judging fish based ability climb tree? France: 40.000 ...

:-/ headliner, we've listening warmup bands. hospitals doing? getting close capacity? capacity?

Yes Suspend coach game. get teams attention. brink overflowed many places. Based picture article, people lining get Covid? numbers aren‚Äôt really shocking... agree you, government media addressing France. used make Covid disappear days, fact broke 40k cases per day day President said need get 3k cases per day went easier. 

I personally dislike religion. preys week needy, causes wars issues. France let fester long. need something sure, difficult, replace Covid narrative, going cause terrible winter us. Sounds relatively mild, hope stays way. Interesting fitness tracker thing - mean heart rate oxygen something else? 

I bet Apple/Google/Fitbit could track spread bio data changed behaviours. reason stupidity health district boards. positions appointed county elected officials and...get this...THERE QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS!!! idiots appointed wackjob buddies got elected county commissioner position probably can't hold job week.  Ska fans like You‚Äôd both. 

Bring healthy kids testing, avoid testing sick kids. 

That said, states aren‚Äôt using test positivity rate though, they‚Äôre using cases per 100k. even pushed positive rate 0.5% positive case would worse. Well take precautions surging that's great way stop surging first place.

So problem people cautious? US worse, right? 8 million+ confirmed cases 330,000,000 people puts us 2.5% read study showed temperatures 38 degree celsius humidity 80 percent significantly reduce time virus contagious air surfaces. Virus likes dry cold conditions. places like northeast, I'm NYC/ northern NJ, really can't look case count true barometer. first wave got absolutely hammered testing total shit. days walk multiple urgent cares day test sites get day results some. Back March April beg test unless dying (exaggeration course) case numbers alone depending region deceptive. infection better. think can't control virus anyway way handled. infections now, less later. ‚ÄúWe rounding corner‚Äù

This admin couple months ago. get downvoted saying reinfection rare wife's grandmother got point felt done everything needed life decided done taking precautions. want die, going avoid things might put risk. 

You father might also place mentally care, might cognitive dissonance.  easier pretend everything fine, explain care die. question though contain something idea unknown science? 

Interesting question, except case COVID-19. known local government China even early period. afraid reporting central government national reporting system disease control, something put place SARS. reported, action central government taken later due international attention. severity downplayed. Travel restrictions China advised China... preventing countries critical time protect CCP-virus. 

People even doctors silenced ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù speaking epidemic. 

Why would believe china mishandled previous epidemics exact way? SARS epidemic claimed CPC struck suddenly nowhere. Except CPC knew early late november 2002, yet chose report late february 2003 afraid losing face covering spread regions forget Chinese authorities grasped severe was, locked city 12 million people time country considered it. 

Even AP says Chinese officials knew China facing serious pandemic early January 14th, chose warn people 20th January. Critical days people traveling en-masse lunar new years massive banquet held Wuhan days.

So many coverups incompetencies. many dead hands Chinese Communist Party. Yes, wish folks would learn etymology word ""quarantine"":

40 days' isolation, minimum, virulent asymptomatic spread. People science subredit saying starting go back normal 2-3+ years vaccine works getting 300+ upvotes, even saying 2025, people insane, fuck businesses right? fuck economy well apparently, people live bubble. baseline

We returned pre-spike baseline. first spike (max \~32k/day), settled around 22k/day. second spike (max 70k/day), settled around 40k/day. we're heading new spike, new single-day records 7-day average verge surpassing previous peak (67k/day right now).

What happens peak gets lot coverage, ""it's going down"" gets lot coverage, there's follow-through political keep things going get back zero. cough bunch Trees Except is. tried ordering several restaurants weekend case bad proven herd immunity thing this.

The numbers herd immunity absolutely insane. Herd immunity estimated 70% (likely higher actually). also unclear it'd give immunity strains currently spreading countries (they may differ enough - like annual flu).

----

If 1% population gets COVID per week, it'd take nearly 18 months hit 70% herd immunity. USA, means 3.3 million people per week would need get COVID week ""done"" easter 2022.

**That would involve 90k deaths/week 18 months** (2.7% CFR 3.3M cases per week). Total deaths would 6M deaths (70% 330M 2.7% CFR)

We set record cases 88k. *That means needs get nearly 20x worse hit herd immunity two easters now.* That's fucking insane. Curfew means nothing. Virus spreading poor ventilation. Could work, restaurant stuffy home multiple generations. Take vitamins, wear mask, wash hands, social distance. Good luck. 9000! it‚Äôs going away. 

This sub 2 months ago. Wtf read. China version covid actually less potent second version one europe deadlier first version.

Covid actually China. ivy league article it. later edited wording implicate Chinese people europe propaganda reasons. never locked though Yes. Yes am.  mean, caught swine flu '09 fresher's week moved uni abroad (and neon orange snot week - marginally amusing thing that). Whatever people bring runs student population like flash fire, covid absolutely exempt. Portland receptive audience non-progressive ideals, protestors definitely aren‚Äôt wasting time essentially yelling brick wall anything I'm arguing anything, I'm literally listing stats. Last time helped work pickup Kroger, could choose one four terrible options computer offered. could say ""out stock"" get reprimanded leads. time stop discussion better worse. We're different timelines. going long winter. also fed printing money pumping stock market months end? that's happening. fair never supposed stop spread, delay long enough us get collective shit together. still havent. Wow. agenda push misinformation school age children advocate school closures? serology studies children actually pointed direction! Also know immune systems work differently even exposed quickly attack virus. risks causing long term harm children far far outweigh benefits keeping schools closed, that‚Äôs general consensus among epidemiologists pediatricians. possible? strict checks people coming China. Like PCR, quarantines more.

And somehow 137 cases. Mainland. How!?

Either scientists know little nothing virus yet totally honest covid.

Like virus test negative MAYBE sometime test positive infectious, starting loop again. Yep, probably close. Bars around bad. Yes, incoming travelers must spend two weeks managed isolation. Went long ago. You‚Äôre met airport transported hotel you‚Äôre vitals monitored daily tested covid days 2-3 11-12. Bro shit never end  school district kids required wear masks desks, horrifying, nobody taking seriously still It‚Äôs reality. We're closing 55% millennial women mothers already youngest millennials still 23 (this percent going 2.5+% every year atm). generation surely fewer parents last strong majority likely parents time reach 40. reality millenials hold 4.6% wealth country boomers held 21% wealth age.

I agree wealth inequality huge pressing issue (a big reason anti-lockdown lockdowns mass wealth transfer young, poor millennials old, wealthy boomers). Though imagine older generations always hold wealth wonder say wealth disparity boomers 30s Greatest/Silent Generations 60s/70s. imagine less still significant. lived pandemic lol number people refuse take seriously astound me. 

I live near Placerville, California San Francisco Bay Area Lake Tahoe Highway 50 El Dorado County. first wave Lake Tahoe got locked pretty hard high number cases. even allowed unless lived or, property (vacation home rentals) needed emergency care. Yesterday, Tahoe return traffic Placerville heaviest seen since COVID. three traffic lights Highway 50 Placerville slows traffic coming town. Usually, adds 5 minutes trip town. Yesterday, took half hour get many people traveling Tahoe. low numbers county right (6 new cases last week,) travelers Bay Area Sacramento almost assuredly spike couple weeks. (R) Taiwan also island three living SK? can‚Äôt get straight answer - I‚Äôm living Bratislava need go Vienna work next week. mandatory testing occur. train station outside district, able travel? We've seen recent increase online censorship response outbreak. potential president promoting idea criminalizing fake news, could huge impact COVID reporting future.. temporary. It‚Äôll bad memory eventually. whatever society get make painless possible lasts, I‚Äôm it. Wait want people acknowledge evidence large gatherings people don‚Äôt spread virus? It‚Äôs even discussion. know diseases spread. FFS. Yeah that‚Äôs helping argument. Although know one best pitchers MLB missed season heart issues Covid. 

Not great consider much better shape I. I'm talking healthcare system. Wow, that‚Äôs crazy. really believe that? like trump much afraid Democrats? hard time processing this. mean, us social. like around friends, around family, going things. lot country, spending holidays family huge bummer. Cases lead hospitalizations deaths. see clouds horizon starts raining.  That's million every 10 days. lockdown kill virus, bring hospitalizations reasonable number. Pretty sure that's in-game purchase. come base game course, mutation likely (not certain, likely) make less severe. take logic, it‚Äôs idiots might save us all. told political issue, despite may hear, public health issue.

You also point every country world Trump president still major issue. Europe spiking spite him. would advise symptoms come suddenly, within couple hours. may get feverish even light-headed, conditions could affect ability drive safely. We're talking short 2-hour trek. really want recuperate brother's, best limit solo driving 3 4 hours distance. ask brother meet half-way &amp; caravan back place. way fall ill help. \- people already build immunity begining ""pandemic"" !!! building natural immunity make profits big companies !!!

Because big business lied.... care home work, started getting truck loads PPE late June we're quite stocked up. Since early July we've ordered use IIR face masks times within 2 meters patients. 100% is. ordered couple packages Amazon get Christmas saw toilet paper shelves running low. Yeah, it‚Äôs ignoring social distancing masking guidelines mall shoppers pay commemorate Junior‚Äôs exposure Covid Santa. 

Just time seasonal family gatherings! ;) pretty sure have/had it, don't/didn't want bother test. going around several coworkers' families, 1st one confirmed one else bothered getting tested. got sick, while, carried on. remember flu cases 98% since COVID-19 emerged. think hard that's even remotely logical, stay terrified economy collapses entirely beyond repair. exists? saying, course does... situation too. Grad student, teach undergrad labs. Last week third students newly isolated. school defines positive cases university impact, super narrow definition means close contact fifteen minutes without mask. Seems disingenuous me. planning semester, concerns Dean met basically teach person lose stipend. school hurting money they'll sacrifice us keep thing afloat. They're even talking whole university 75% open spring. Sounds like hopeful madness me. Either way, feeling pretty fucked regular basis. \#winning

/s See... can't say stuff without identifying reason behind words. never anti-mask. Back March April, global shortage PPE health professionals really needed it, afraid people get needed general public hoarded critical supplies. EU hitting 230k+ cases day, US 90k+ day.

Western civilization really best huh. Uh, we're probably using reported deaths. That's extra +11 days offset (according Sweden anyway, maybe UK). 23 right ballpark.

Still think correct play around offset see chart looks different. summer wave much higher countries. point think learned stop counting chickens hatch.

Europe well terribly now. thing waxes wanes. long game even halftime. Exactly. It‚Äôs easy people hypothetical death. long kids keep going school hundreds thousands bringing home parents relatives, going see slowdown all. 

Parents simply want acknowledge can't afford means childcare, they're willing send little disease vectors school every day. Holland arrest deniers put large common detention facilities? normally dinner around 9 pm here, thus parties **start** 11 pm older 30 1-2 younger 30   kiwi reading this: Currently mandatory government quarantine enforced returnees ?
They achieved commendable feat. I'm curious plan keep cases zero. sure would super comforting 1%. zealots left Europe come America form extremist cult colonies Everybody joking bad 2020 overall downhill climate change. Where‚Äôd get biology degree from? üòÇ Schools open every state that's spiking.

Superspreader events held. Churches meeting again, people getting lax lazy. know states steal website, metrics, everything else New York using control this.  think math wrong.

The risk contracting COVID-19 still quite low, even child contracts Covid-19 relatively low risk disease. 

The impacts childhood poverty known far prevalent. look China reports flu, it‚Äôs CHINA expect lol Who.

Cares.

It's.

Just.

For.

Poor.

People. Restaurants can't fully operate ""social distancing"" requirements. yes, restrictions absolutely affect business. expected *competence*?  Kid 2 participated hypothetical made kid seem like he/she affected school closings he/she not. agree, major flaw report. Would interested see changes different offsets. think assumes lot things agree with. 

If successful vaccine, would birth rates drop? could argue opposite people decide value family lives work. marriage. 

Another aspect drop available labor people decide work less immigration drops. 

Less labor = better pay people actually available work. 

The last pandemic 1919 saw decade relative prosperity right it. workers gaining rights (and power) course next couple decades 1970's trend reversed again. Thanks. guess would‚Äôve tempted risky behaviors age well. country reported 88,973 new infections 8:30 pm Friday 8:30 pm Saturday, figures showed, substantially previous day's 79,963.

Wonder impact everything. giving new WINNING? Quebec plateaued implementing tighter restrictions beginning month, hard see Ontario following suit. bipartisan decision

Don't fall good cop/bad cop routine Checking NJ too. Completely agree breed super strain virus here? Let's nothing let people decide. Aaaaaand we're defeated. What's lunch. countries spiraling cases covid pressure approve treatments vaccines. Given usual approval process take couple years, expected. 

People ignore countries like America approved, look countries covid control doing. 

What medications New Zealand, China, Vietnam, Korea, Japan, etc., approved? countries covid control, hence, governments less pressure approve medications. ~67 million people France. ... ~45,000 new cases day new record there.

~330 million people USA ... ~81,000 new cases day new record there.

Approximate maths: USA 5 times amount people, twice new daily record compared France. means France 2.5x amount new infections per capita day USA has. Third There, excess deaths Finland, far. excess deaths first 36 weeks year (719 per 100,000) slightly lower year 5 year average.

‚ÄãFinland's death rate 718.36 per 100k period last year (weeks 1 36 2019), 736.39 2018, 722.6 2017. It‚Äôs true. Keep indoor bars restaurants closed, limit/discourage family gatherings preK-12 run without problems kids wearing masks strong cohorts. 

All coronavirus seasonal due time indoors specific link school. Sure, almost everyone exposed strain nobody left kill. Spanish flu pandemic point ‚Äústopped‚Äù. Nobody‚Äôs dying particular strain today. Right window arm arm sanity. lol chicago suburbs couldn‚Äôt care less covid reasonable disclaimers.

Nobody saying totally safe open schools, far least grade schools opened correlated increased community spread 

It's important focus attention activities causing spread. internet media didn‚Äôt exist people would forgotten virus. always done. wish could like NZ seeing absolute insane Europe infection rates 20-30% makes realize Canadian provinces pretty good job.

It's pretty clear coming, people listen mask literally easiest way stop this. hope keep infection rate 5% aid hospitals health care systems. Sturgis initially spread infection regions low mask usage continues spread rather contained. honestly bad, people need learn deal alone time improve themselves. affected working remove life.

People complaing we've lockdown since March haven't, people complain everything, security guards fault sex tourist (not true), BLM protest (it wasn't), blame government, blaming everything. That's head in. 

This time need come together positive help one another. street live we've dropping meals neighbours, cooking comps, scone cookie bake off, started group chat Facebook communicate honestly us fine, following COVID safe requirements. 

Then news social media see loudest people complaing masks measures undertaken, ex-friends mine talking economy collapsing got slightest clue (people complaing job seeker/keeper). digress, think positive! least it'll dark see full shitshow! know zero Australia New Zealand really flu season winter. Covid contagious, spreading much way, (flu hits R number 1.3 without mitigation meadures) even measures slow Covid without stopping spreading (say bringing R number somewhere 1 2) make nigh impossible flu really take bringing R number zero average flu case.

NZ less deaths flu Covid combined year normally would flu alone. excess winter death rate negative. Wtf. hit 1M day? March 2021? We're going see 2k deaths day November understand that‚Äîif remember correctly, article speaking USA whole. agree different regions see waves independent one another graphic showing major year gaps pandemics especially top. question you? think going another pandemic size covid next 10 years? Also mention I'm teacher quite low blow. I'm elementary special ed teacher. I'm teaching pandemics.

It's actually 300,000+, test outright lied others. 70,000+ Source? I'm glad muddle- middle, compromising,I'm sorry Canada. he's honestly asking question. entire comment underlying bias someone 60 miss family something awful really appreciate want safe. ""Hold vodka."" -Russia far know Victoria still australia. say case US Vermont barely cases. Waves propagate. analogy still fits. Still first wave bouncing around map, like stone dropped rubbermaid bucket half filled water. Schools. Welcome back, 2-day-old redditor strong prejudiced opinions entire swedish population. get banned again? understand can't both. great about? think talk USA whole. states better strategies others. ending first wave virus started others. second wave, others still first. understand. thought guys brought things control. going again? province I‚Äôm hasn‚Äôt community spread months yet everyone still wearing masks indoors. It‚Äôs really big deal. Full China mode, lock whole city test everyone per case Time dethrone administration. failed Think responded wrong comment? state testing more, positive tests still 1%, whole time. People freaking tHeRe‚ÄôS pOsItIvE cAsEs EvErrrrrr! virus democrat. hard time believing asymptomatic parents 1 case infected 137 people every single one cases also asymptomatic. article say whether masks used factory infections occurred evidence mask use make asymptomatic disease common (although much common stretch), masks indeed used 137 cases. like assume China lying, seems weird. Whoa dude Capacity always issue. Even normal times. peak moments sometimes demote 1st class 2nd class hanging decals doors. happens far between.

They created app gives commuters real time advice available capacity e.g. ""next train peaked, take one that"".

Add extra trains? possible railroad network already saturated would create safety issues. Upgrades network happen anything infrastructure related, quite literally, tends take decades.

There prevalent 9-to-5 mentality. Kids workers expected time schools workplaces. WFH far popular among employers. So, despite calls leave either early late, people rather huddle together commuter trains rather face repercussions job school.

Finally, historically, urban planning created sleeper towns major urban centers (literally called ""center cities"") meaning day millions commuters commuting 50 even 100km work car train. Fun fact: employers give employees leasing car part salary, subsidized tax break.

The net result there's loads mobility among regions creating even opportunities virus spread. It‚Äôs schools one say so. do?! people waving Reichsflaggen, wearing cloths nazi quotes, nazi tattoos... stop trolling inform yourself. Remove office. failed. Um.... EU pulling 200k cases day US 80k. learning Chinese term ‚Äúscoreboard‚Äù. Whats New Zealand‚Äôs plan vaccine doesn‚Äôt come next year?

Stay closed forever? bunch scruffy lads Britain told us 50 years ago thing coming around bend Satan. 53% county‚Äôs cases, unknown became infected.

This would really need comment reasons: TTI work overload, lacking cooperativeness 
or casual unrelated infections public fomites/food people walking by? Every single doctor nurse I‚Äôve spoken told numbers inflated. States health care systems get money every case diagnose. get every death. literally guy decapitated car wreck attributed COVID death. 

Meanwhile local university 1000 corona cases, student deaths maybe, rumored, one hospitalization. That‚Äôs statistically significant sample size. 

This virus nothing. Don‚Äôt let run life

This comment removed high quality information. Agenda??? read article? ‚Äú‚ÄòThe data see, comfortable children not, fact, driving transmission, especially school settings,‚Äô said Brooke Nichols, infectious disease modeler Boston University School Public Health.‚Äù

Obviously qualifiers evidence. evidence far shows schools generally source spread. I‚Äôd much rather trust evidence completely unsupported statement blaming schools spreading COVID. I'm 100% sure barley season food think salty.

I prefer salt pepper barley. friends Switzerland seeing posts social media, acting like nothing different. bizarre since Switzerland close Italy. Apparently things closed down, concerts cancelled, would still see people hanging large groups drinking, masks ever visible. wondering Switzerland seemed effected. people pretending thing? current Administration plan, need get way need put someone place feels 500,000 dead Americans bad thing. US CDC‚Äôs current recommendation use cloth face coverings. N95s, theory, provides protection... flaws: created equal, many don‚Äôt truly pass standards tests, valves allowing wearer spread virus. Also don‚Äôt properly fit it, actually becomes useless.

I would go CDC recommending: cloth face coverings. notable public health figures even likened cloth face coverings vaccines able build immunity reducing viral dose low levels, allowing immune system react. healthcare US free all?

Not healthcare free would helped much -- hospitals limits -- still, plan ""mitigation"" advanced therapies rich, palliative care triage everyone else. It‚Äôs irresponsible comment common sense thinking would suggest that, actual FACTS DATA say categorically FALSE. 

Do reference? don‚Äôt. guess what, many school districts nationwide watching kids classrooms carefully, kids tested positive tests traced isolated, guess schools consistently MUCH lower almost non-existing levels infection compared community. 

Where contact tracers find cases? primarily family gatherings original outside sources indoor bars restaurants. 

Garbage assumptions like millions children, shockingly actually mostly follow directions much much better adults young old, suffered much unnecessarily. Yes, school age children, wear masks, distance, listen, seriously, take seriously places nationwide actually allowed go school, works! IDK? Could count 3rd wave coming early? USA major flare-up summer period countries lull waves 1 2 (and USA hardly said lull sort) tricky count. live Ontario town 4000, nearest sizeable city 200 km away, people careful here. Mask compliance least 95%, almost cases. small outbreak one local school, closed school week tested everyone. Seven cases found end outbreak. Belgian here. issue mostly politicians listening scientists. listen lobbyist groups keep caf√©s restaurants open long possible. Also, still think keep schools open everything go back normal. 

In august stopped listening virologist altogether created new advisory committee focus ‚Äúliving virus‚Äù much like sweden. real translation said! still listening idiots committee instead virologists. members committee (most notably lieven annemans) still want relax measures today. say virologist reacting won‚Äôt. live world long deny responsibility, followers believe you, know, anything otherwise fake news. think treat whole USA talking waves. USA big, size population wise different states rules lack thereof. comparable EU state comparable nation. states finishing first wave virus barely reached others. intubated patients seen sure heck makes masking distancing easier. People negligent misfortune hits family. smart. Yea abbot labs crank PCR spins up! rookie numbers, need CASES hand, rise ‚Äúwork home‚Äù culture mean good things long term women/mothers balancing home life work always extremely challenging. 

They likely return maternity leave sooner, take days care sick children, leave work early pick kids school.

Could short term pain long term gain situation women (particularly mothers) workforce. Bullshit lockdown, cops giving fines outside another person park. That's ridiculous me. place live community transmission month effective lockdown, competent governance continued covidsafe plans. Life pretty well going normal here. Lol. Chinese love Las Vegas. need think outside mainstream media friend. We‚Äôre watching thing spread like crazy think started Wuhan stayed there? üòÇ FB post question got many replies. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs 100%  doubt started 2020. Meanwhile, comparably developed nations call shutdowns (limited full on) case counts reach 300-400/day.

Eg. Australia

Meanwhile, USA taking 1960s ""salt tablet"" approach safety. Original cases seems unlikely made difference 9 months later. Acting faster also related strategy - Sweden notoriously slow anything all. less privatisation health care also seems unlikely made difference. 

These three factors seem quite weak me. Especially considering second third point directly related strategy. lot retirement homes hit **due insistence government mandate lockdown**. 

Do really think three things mention enough cause x10 difference deaths? want daughter applying American colleges next year. would argue third wave. second wave happened July, post-protests. virus dramatically affects young healthy people too.

This said anyone Covid-19  serious actually ignorant? basically don‚Äôt acknowledge retarded enforce mandatory masks something less deadily flu? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è man.

This beginning end surely. exactly *needs* **federal** law mandating masks **right fucking now**.

In many ways doesn‚Äôt go far enough however, often even people wear masks wrongly. fault own. happens. reason task force specialists monitor masks worn correctly. spread communities work.

As part that, people willfully put fellow citizens danger need identified. obviously includes anybody voted Trump. people special insignia masks identified authorities sake public good.

Their children perhaps slightly less conspicuous symbol masks ‚Äî something identify real risk result raised enemies society science.

As part new nationwide emphasis public health, citizens encouraged identify people ‚Äúenemies‚Äù progress. identified, individuals given chance repent change ways. progress course need monitored government, third type insignia masks, ease identification.

To facilitate compliance new public health measures, new agency government created. task force mentioned easily adopted work. individuals employed federal government identified such. help gain measure trust population. jobs keep files individuals within purview, update files regularly track progress.

Obviously people willingly violate new mask law separated society ‚Äî good society, well good. dealt humanely fairly. like Nazis. individuals simply separated families society moved safe place time being. perfectly humane fair. safe places seek educate evil ways harm world. re-educated returned society. course repeat offenders dealt little harshly. 

But benefit. Eventually individuals proven menace society danger security state, permanently removed. done humanely, key done good collective whole. system really space individualism. selfish attitude exactly got us trouble first place.

So selfish activity controlled aspects society, especially economic realm. Individuals allowed hoard cash. progressive tax policy course help redistributed, aid less fortunate. cash hoarding outlawed, banks reason exist. probably done away first. People run banks identified enemies state placed camps see error ways returned society. course allowed enter advantageous position, somewhere near base, reduced manual tasks help greater good. Needless say also special insignia masks identifies part dangerous class individuals.

Business owners stripes receive treatment managers banks. course understanding welcome opportunity make amends society. However will, protection, removed society.

There measures taken vis-a-vis bourgeoisie brought much pain unto country. tackled later.

**The important thing 100% fucking law leave house without wearing mask.**

Frankly require wearing even home even you‚Äôre alone. simply strictly outlawed public. Anybody caught flaunting important rule dealt harshly. Penalties enough. Imprisonment, indefinite period (at least year, five even ten years) first time offenders. exceptions, appeals. Second-time offenders sent top secret camps permanently. camps degenerates repeat violators laws. security reasons limits small group security professionals special clearance. Red Cross international organizations allowed anywhere near premises. make sure harmful individuals kept sight mind. fair, correct, proper measures taken people willfully go public without masks. Tell us something known months, Mark. Allez, France, je crois que √ßa suffit maintenant... know. Thanks! Lol. According NYTimes 
U S. Deaths: 
July 4 - 261. 
October 24 - 871 fact CNN blocked allow random right wing blogs downplaying threat ridiculous. think large gatherings COVID bad idea wrong. think kids it, magically immune. sure us needs proof, here, are. Muslims pissed France defending free speech includes drawing funny pictures warlord prophet. Yes l fully appreciate sentiment! l impression number infections sited post somehow death toll. actually Slovakia, so... Calm get sub.

Covid 19 serious US Government terrible job running it. also 99% survival rate.

This something people take seriously. it‚Äôs end world. It‚Äôs 95%, it‚Äôs 55% argument. many complained Norway Denmark people denied care? Zero. That‚Äôs many. Infinitely less Sweden.

Had heard phenomenon COVID-19 hit? standard operating procedure Sweden, investigating find handled well certainly worth expect find systemic issues.

What I'm saying Sweden focus lot people find willing microphone talk to, Norway Denmark receiving kinda focus. it‚Äôs not. Sweden‚Äôs strategy ‚Äúflatten curve achieve herd immunity ASAP‚Äù. That‚Äôs strategy. 

I hoping one people believe crap. Herd immunity *is* goal Sweden, everybody else, vaccinations course, it‚Äôs secondary outcome analysis, probably rigorous. see raw difference deaths per capita, actual difference going x6, likely more. 

No, read study say pre-trends, i.e. Norway technically trending _BEFORE_ effect lockdown could've noticed. believe corrected manually regards hospital admissions, dude. You‚Äôre pretending you‚Äôre basing opinion fact. Yet keep ignoring neighbouring countries vastly better outcome. point. you‚Äôre making fool yourself.

I basing opinion fact, showed promise I'd little bit open changing mind. Show fact check article says otherwise. Remind 4 weeks. Sick new high score, America wins again! know, people can‚Äôt tolerate cooped 8+ months something ~.6% IFR skews heavily towards exceeded average lifespan. It‚Äôs almost humans social creatures suffer isolated... people want live bubble want hide homes beds government cut checks every week. feel sorry bubble people. Silver lining, good climate change. population earth far great sustainable, continuous growth accelerate that.  likely see complete effect testing staff overwhelmed.

The interactive map looks pretty scary consider communes realize infected damaged lungs cause brain damage, blood clots require amputation limbs unknown damage still learning about. die mean organs injured. ignorant view pretend like cars ""bumping other""...completely wrong. hell even mean? great sacrifice staying home couple/few weeks testing tracing supplying masks would need? look America. Look South Korea, Japan Taiwan. lost game too. We'll considering they're getting full, they're full rural iowa... Lot people gonna die preventable shit well overloaded hospital system Wow, can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs almost year That‚Äôs overly concerned area, % positive rate remained within 1.5% - 2.5% since lockdown lifted. University, might ask?  I‚Äôm familiar France like US normally Sunday numbers lower rest week? Pretty much. like couple hundred years ago. Even household, often live close see daily. people would want take free covid test know whether risk family loved ones. rational thing do.

The reason people reluctant take test worried might happen tested positive. lose job self-quarantine? continue get paycheck? afford medical bills? on. 

So question whether testing mandatory not, rather kinds support system place tested positive. know kind setup China place, America, support government. sporting arenas less third capacity. Children back school regularly tested strictly social-distanced,

Horseshit. I'm teacher Italy, children literally allowed take masks sat desks. Curfew might counterproductive, even. Look France Malaysia schools nightclubs closed recently, seems sensible me.  2 giant packages Costco TP ready go. Yiayia‚Äôs nursing home Canton hit. Around 50 residents. 11 positive today. live Chicago wait horror read ‚ÄúNoem News‚Äù wait updates family. FFS Sodak, stop voting people killing neighbors/family total lack leadership. reward playing living normal life right wish knew many asymptomatic uncontrolled spread situation. end year prevalent masks protect since N95 still unavailable non medical personnel civilians. low humidity virus travels 100 times easier. Like said, that's covid survival rate, first factor chance they'll catch corona first place, corona turn covid, given.

So number way off.

Also, like someone else commented: decimal point off. 276,000,000 x .0002 = 55,200 Except whole notion ""herd immunity"" commonly discussed assumes get near life long immunity natural infection. know that's probably case COVID, re-infection happens like coronaviruses, like coronaviruses probably get immunity something like 3 months 2 years. simply possible achieve permanent ""herd immunity"" natural infection like outbreak chicken pox measles. whole pandemic handbook around years though? 0 new domestic cases country almost billion half? got tested wore least mentally

[You need harden fuck thoughts! also got email early school year saying need get kids moving every 15 minutes keep virus bay. better pandemic response available haven‚Äôt shared it? Simply leader unambiguously supports mask wearing wonders compliance. WH spokesman tweets useless would also help greatly. 

Even nothing it'll vast improvement. I‚Äôm glad person responsible got tested *immediately* suspecting symptoms. People Northeast coastal California seem take seriously whole. See, racist part everyone seems board wearing masks keeping distance. It‚Äôs simply conscientious good citizen getting quickly painlessly possible. weather‚Äôs still unseasonably warm (hello climate crisis) easy small gatherings happen outside. know American think, ""How people pay that?""

He took short-term position want anyone think anything negative going on, downplayed it. weeks thought could gain advantage taking (semi) seriously. giving daily press briefings, remember? made look like idiot stopped went back full denial.

And since controls base denial started ""I know old lady swallowed fly"" chain events, gave cover Republicans might wanted way anyway. That‚Äôs good hear! elected 2016? still weakness. This. right sums everyone else thinks people sub forum complete morons. Millions healthy, relatively young people died. That‚Äôs waves ended came back.

Did disease *stop*, though? Hard say. I'd guess there's least three factors it:

* got bit luckier fewer original cases. remember comparisons late spring states US massive differences COVID-19 deaths infection rates without stark difference call ""strategy"".

* acted faster did.

* *probably* seen less privatization elder healthcare particular. I'm uncertain point, point large part domestic criticism towards Swedish response. spurred political promise (so take will) scale budget next year.

Why, think? I‚Äôm post I‚Äôm sure lashed people working home end, there. It‚Äôs fault happening. assume that?

In state, parents aren‚Äôt even required notify district fucking child Covid Even crazier:they decided remove nearly restrictions 3 weeks ago (mask still obligatory, everything except clubs bars business usual) Herd mentality  You‚Äôre correct.

Still, sucks perspective all. they're talking bringing people back office work safety precautions except masks. quick temp checks nothing. believe employer afford it. Isn‚Äôt strange nothing changed terms virus itself, transmission, mitigation options, yet perception completely changes behave toward it. Like right probably dangerous time entire pandemic many places, yet less fear caution ever. Humans something. Millions healthy, relatively young people died. That‚Äôs waves ended came back.

The disease stopped spreading like wildfire world literally millions people, young healthy, died. Cities took freewheeling approach higher deaths, longer periods economic stagnation.

Let's forget Chinese authorities grasped severe was, locked city 12 million people time country considered it. easy forget outrageous idea seemed time, yet touted viable way preventing spread (leaving societal economic concerns). 

There valid criticisms handled early stages, realistically see could stopped spreading globally, given known attributes mentioned above. said ‚Äúthis still first wave‚Äù. nothing regional. said look regionally determine waves, strictly US whole. jumped throat reason apparently saying calling regional originally makes sense (reread comment stream) Military health professionals, before.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Swedish Government routinely measures trust agencies (not Public Health Agency) last one published 3 days ago showed this.

""In survey, 81 percent answered confidence Swedish Public Health Agency. many 43 percent answered high level trust. 6 percent respondents little confidence."" 

During year trust gone never 70%. probably high right Sweden ok survey done though. Unfortunately cases going imagine trust go again, depending course everything Well know better than. Sorry haven‚Äôt paying attention. ‚ÄúIn past three days, France registered 139,000 new cases, 132,000 cases registered two-month lockdown mid-March mid-May.‚Äù wrong. movement opinion sub absolutely wrong this, wrong lead poor decision making, misinformation, thus, outbreaks. admit wrong.

You‚Äôre silly lived whole life. think entirely possible, depends testing. level positivity greater say 3-5%, aren‚Äôt testing enough missing cases. If, ‚Äúdraconian criminal system‚Äù, mean enforcement strong, true. context COVID-19, Singapore little tolerance idiots insist flying face common sense e.g. breaking quarantine (personally speaking, can‚Äôt say much sympathy spare said idiots either).

However, doesn‚Äôt mean lack transparency oppressed populace seem imply. Neither true. said would near impossible hide cases, meant wholly practical level; case long concealed country small yet holding population large. Neither anyone silenced, largest proof pretty much everyone access western social media.

For it‚Äôs worth, think shouldn‚Äôt downvoted original comment, since qualify don‚Äôt know much Singapore government (and assumed Singapore itself). assumed asking good faith. 

I *am* Singaporean, anything assured least know country reasonably well. hope least keep open mind despite may already think. Children superspreaders.

Match map schools opened areas exploding... Lol üëçü§£ [Biden Panic buy food toilet paper!!! It‚Äôs gonna long winter inside Restrictions lockdowns. even close.

Having masks mandates place, social distancing guidelines, contact tracing, etc. necessarily hurt business unlike forced closure. Presumably, don‚Äôt *want* start rationing care, *have to* inadequate resources (space, beds, staff) due pandemic. Plus prosecute likes dr. schiffmann Covid deniers risking lives spreading lies tests masks. Yeah, that's I'm saying. Individual areas whole time. Many counties US seen single death. really make sense look US aggregate varied inconsistent governmental responses pandemic. wouldn‚Äôt over, would much safer manageable possible contact tracing work. doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúend‚Äù vaccine available administered across board. still take awhile. you‚Äôre right everyone needs follow protocols actually want mass deaths end then. Yeah right, got mixed there. attacking something completely irrelevant posted. above. look around see the, ""we going month 7 2 week lock down""... see lot masks around, people otherwise sick lockdown going back normal routines. What's ETA making 10M rapid antigen tests per day US?

Unfortunately, one balls make tests mandatory work schools. 

So, instant infection public largely myth failing TTI, America split diseased ""who cares"" group nearly sterile elite. Lol. bit!? Paid big time, europe seeing massive cases deaths surge kept deaths cases pretty low, people still many things want. best choice western countries. would second grader school. cloth masks obviously hot made first week ok. paper masks much lighter cooler, want effective. Netherlands around 9,000 day 17,2 million people. Apparently places Europe worse.

The USA worse seems.

Edit: **USA 328 million people. apply numbers USA would 171,000 day.** reporting Sunday‚Äôs numbers it‚Äôs Sunday right now, aren‚Äôt even half way live results Verifying it‚Äôs false 
She said that‚Äôs health department told her. tried telling misheard misinformed went ballistic 
At point I‚Äôm tired correcting false information They‚Äôre asymptomatic now, cus testing done early. think start develop symptoms days fair think trials whether prevents hinders infection still ongoing. 500,000 deaths February might estimation. difference ‚Äúlockdown level‚Äù Sweden soft-lockdown countries (like Denmark Norway) almost non-existent.

That simply true. serious. don‚Äôt mean argumentative; I‚Äôm trying open-minded possible. 

Whether get tested start quarantine immediately, don‚Äôt test still follow EXACT quarantine tracing procedures, problem? absolutely obligation follow correct procedures, obligation get tested. It‚Äôs like knowledge proper protocols available got tested. severity mild, proper tracing, proper quarantine protocols followed, completely reasonable don‚Äôt get tested make government happy.

Now, people don‚Äôt want get tested probably people also don‚Äôt respect protocols, even legitimacy disease. doesn‚Äôt mean people follow properly. 

Again, trying argumentative. views thread little radical. requirements obligations get tested report health condition government; different? let get straight. state whose entire livelihood depends commodity exports else citizens would live abject poverty, think governor trying help people ‚Äúevil‚Äù? wave propagation technical term? 'Stone dropped rubbermaid bucket half filled water?' ü§î Thats true.

In Europe Belgium far worst one.

Worldwide plenty worse ones (most South america).

If taken comparison current performance Spain actually quite well, similar bettwr France, UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Poland, Czechia, Ukraine... naming few.

If consider perspectives Spain one countries Europe exponential growth. making difference.

Let explain: Spain linear growth cases 1st July (with flat even decrease cases) European countries almost cases early October started growth exponentially.

This really important means Spain never outbreak control (they might badly controlled, want) European countries do.

If Spain manage keep performing since 1st July, smoke clears example follow.

What mean?: take Belgium current case/deaths (which worse one Europe) 17.700 cases 78 deaths.

When moving figure Spain would compare 70.000 Spanish cases 400 deaths.

Last Spanish numbers 20.000 231.

On side note: people bad understanding bad quick things get exponential growth. Swedens deaths soon skyrocket cause still havent learned freaking anything. saying make point. course care deeply people. people risk health need support, equipment pay.

My point looking selfishly one aspect pandemic, willing sacrifice others see weak. everyone acted like perspective. 

Point made. whine. GOP strategy action. Make shit worse blame Biden. always. indoors, whole crowd would probably hospitalized like lifting restrictions it‚Äôs ‚Äúbeen while.‚Äù America sad. That's expected political strategy. ""The left"" fears virus. Make seem like dangerous vote... Solidarity trial open label placebo control showed effect. also interim read peer reviewed. 

There three randomized double blind placebo controlled studies showed effect.

Earlier year whenever positive results covid drugs everyone clamored saying trials randomized double blind placebo controlled, take grain salt. suddenly study limited design enough show effect? It‚Äôs already happening lol swiss mean Switzerland sweden wasnt, please shut stop Sweden defender This. hospital staff currently dealing lot uncertainty flu season year. really. restrictions preventing Americans entering tier 3 zones UK (aside quarantining)? ‚ÄúIt would stupid close schools nothing else‚Äù 
This case US states. schools sporting events/concerts closed. 

My little brother special needs hasn‚Äôt real human contact 7 months. refuses join pathetic online school probably drop HS senior year. hospitalized threat self harm last month. school closures literally killing kids yet stay closed despite 0 evidence schools drive spread. It‚Äôs disgusting. Ooo edgy. Denmark borrowed money ready needed (they almost free money current ultra low interest rates).

I'd also say #2 related strategy, that's matter speed implementation. #3 also outside scope COVID-19 strategy, public health agency responsible elder care home management. wanna include generic domestic policy non-crisis times guest, that's specific COVID-19 strategy.

Can point differences Swedish Norwegian strategy? According CDC animals contract it, doesn‚Äôt take genius look up. Okay, think important note rapid rise cases, also remember record levels testing. understand positivity rate remained constant, states actually risen points, good sign. said, larger case numbers quite DEFINITELY result record testing, also seen drop positivity due testing. I'm waiting someone statistical analysis 5% positivity 80k cases 20% positivity 28k cases per day 2k deaths. think complicated math really understand what's going on. know third tsunami coming think numbers past weeks also result states reaching record testing numbers. think need statistical analysis really figure going on. would rather prepared us overreacting ""artificial"" surge. also recognize hospitalizations going up, time, flu making comeback north. think media researchers need dig deep numbers figure going October ""surge"", February surge gonna 200k cases per day. good thing anything summer prepare this. i'm pissed. never reopened schools. üßê.....ü§î.....ü§®idk know, right? get subreddit negative vibes. mean dangerous make sound like it‚Äôs end world. last thing want crisis community negative people. virus slowly working easy metro areas rural towns affected months...

Earlier year read couple papers written last 10 years - one expressing concern massive reservoir coronaviruses bat colony Yunnan cave system, another reporting blood testing performed local rural populations nearby. found populations unique antibodies seen humans before.

That's correct. others express bodily autonomy concern. 

It's fantasy tyrants bootlickers. you‚Äôd risk shutting one businesses $100 loss product?

Why risk? Even employee catches covid need shut down. silly. person acting like child, threw fit couldn‚Äôt get wanted. absolutely put mask. kind behavior can‚Äôt tolerated enforced, giving reinforces it.

/s say fake news. think weather outdoors much it. 

Here city Ontario, hit low cases July. cities brought mandatory mask laws, province started opening business - made case counts go up. August September nice weather people outdoors, disease spreading again.

It looks like opening business, especially ones like restaurants gyms, makes disease spread fastest. Resident CCP agent Temstar course save face. covid news articles bot generated. Search 894 new covid cases, number matter. see random ‚Äúnews‚Äù sites bot generated content. Americans going walking, though, right? Cmon. biggest fake anti-China/communism propaganda: ""Anyone openly disagrees Gov declares quickly disappear.""

No, work like that, especially latest technology, since things like social networks helps spread news blocking it. unlikely happen facing pandemic - gonna think government claims nothing happening people near become ill one one? Blocking information leads backfire causes harm government releasing it. That's Chinese government learned early mistakes covid. It‚Äôs isolation can‚Äôt maintained. Humans require socialization.

And, record, staying home masking. gonna Halloween. see. described eating healthy exercising. 

It sounds like you‚Äôre definitely making positive changes great, idea healthy behavior coming reference point previously unhealthy behavior.

I would recommend counting calories week. It‚Äôs shocking experience most.

Combine walking lower calories you‚Äôre right track you‚Äôre actually eating healthy incredible Go ahead free. But...no school kids least person, work unless online shopping person either. freedom stops point infringes someone else's. Freedom ""life"" first freedom. thing 'evidence' focused fact schools superspreaders virus. articles talking K-12 schools, schools. Also, articles say can't proven opening schools negative influence COVID cases many variables consider. UK mentioned clearly spiking opening schools, Croatia (which popular holiday country) cases summer. That's surprising.

They also mention social distancing masks considerable influence spread virus countries rules score better circumstances. Meanwhile agree people high school college age vulnerable cases age groups rising schools opened.

You make outrageous claims comment fearmongering, closing schools significant effects gender roles, asked evidence provide 10 articles say ""according global analysis looks like opening schools might effect infection rate, can't say sure countries amount cases definitely risen since reopened schools.""

Also, playbook says closing schools 4 weeks enough enough time control spread bunch rules measures. Obviously US (and basically countries mentioned articles) followed playbook shape form, moot point. 

Could provide evidence outrageous claims please? politicized grift. 

First, democratic states getting trump ilk happy that. worse nothing, actively tried make worse saying masks nothing. 

Second, trump cronies gave government contracts millions buddies. Businesses 2 employees revenue got millions PPP ‚Äúloans‚Äù fired watchdog tasked monitoring funds going. 

They politicized reasons everything, try win re-election enrich themselves. Idiocracy longer fictional movie absolutely right. somebody needs take clozapine US country never virus control. got ""under control"" 25,000 cases day. around world countries got 1,000 cases day decreased periods.

What wrong? looked countries see decrease spread? Wait, forgot leader thinks he's smarter scientists everyone else. bought coffees, slackers!  I'm American fucking dumbass Yeah, surprised positive reaction got this: I'd say Caramelldansen Speedcake remix. would drive fucking insane. Yup. also friend doesn‚Äôt believe quarantine anymore 5 year old wants play soccer he‚Äôs suffering bad. Like.... wot. That's peak Netherlands though, year they've averaging 1000 cases. US 20000 cases pretty much every single day since April, peaks 50 70 thousand. will. Biden going push people wear masks

So claims (Even does, impossible science 

Vague confusing buzzword mean thousands different things depending scientists talks too. 'the science' close restaurants keep things (grocery stores, schools etc) thousands infections happen, mandate masks every (All Federally funded transportation good place start).

If it. chose weird time draw line cause use adblock Correct, somehow managed escape Spain/Italy style healthcare disaster Spring, I'm sure things pan time. Cafes/restaurants near seem mostly empty, maybe people seen numbers distancing more? seems like Portuguese generally feel together (whatever 'it' may be), things like mask mandates respected. South Floridian here. bars clubs back pre-covid levels occupancy. It‚Äôs insane see social media posts people ‚Äúwearing masks‚Äù shoved bar like sardines drinking. 

I understand exhaustion. do. sucks everyone. goddamn really underestimated dumb people are. Sure, scarcity resources. city size Dallas, already underfunded staffed police department, doesn‚Äôt resources police several million people wearing masks. understand there‚Äôs different mindset end life locking seniors homes months end 

Senior citizens locked homes. misinterpretation. allowed *receive visitors* homes. could course leave wanted to, nobody could stop that. however difficult practice sick dependent help staff anything. blocking access healthcare young go bars, movies parties cold blooded. lack solidarity confusing.

Not sure happened way describing it. I‚Äôm pretty sure restaurants bars mostly unused spring even nominally open, however cinemas closed entirely.  actually 100 million, test outright lied 99 million+ Anyone else get anxiety reading this? joke, sad everyone numb,to numbers. I'm scared,I'm concerned, please stay safe lets part control all... need start fucking tazing people fucking listen, fucks sakes really physical distancing. People safely socialize. look super promising we're relying manufacturer sensitivity specificity tests.

I'm sure they're pretty good I'm skeptical 97% sensitive 99% specific accuracy they're claiming. Abbot claimed 15 minute rapid test like 50% sensitive 90% specific real world usage. heard mental talking about? comment thread viruses meeting typical definition life.

However, waiting death's door go doctor can't afford it, things going worse you. know Swedish government recommendation travel (even EU countries) middle July? Way later neighbours started opening countries regions Sweden. mention neighbouring countries closed borders citizens visiting Sweden, reported multiple places Danes visiting Sweden get services can't locked Denmark spring. Sweden trying capitalize, literally strategy. travel recommended, international travel insurances valid, deters people traveling. anyone see? I‚Äôm Christian Europe. There‚Äôs far less COVID denying churches round here. pastors sensible services online. likes Bethel church said really read Bible more. Jesus respected hygienic measures restrictions time we. It‚Äòs convenient it‚Äôs simple. never heard Spain talked anything total control failure lol. 

Them Belgium worst places Europe since like late April early March. Sounds like thug Omg, shut up. Parents kids play sports are, generally speaking, worst. little tiger going best nerd going stand way achieving ultimate glory family name Think wave 1, version 3. 

But seriously, look graphs, first wave go peak never enough *reasonable* person would say ""yes wave ended"", shot second wave. second wave also go down, still higher first wave's peak, declared ""second wave done.""

The keyword reasonable. Many country not, comes Covid actually could help explain it, thank you. far protesters 200

The article deliberately cherry-picking one example.

It might well good pinning bad people now, continue longer leeway. Hospitalizations looks slowing though. Philippines hairy months it‚Äôs back control since late September.

The Philippine subreddit media whole hysterically anti-government keep trying make situation lot worse is.

The issue Philippines balance act reopening. Every time ease restrictions, see spike. issue new guidelines goes two weeks.

We‚Äôre ‚Äúaverage‚Äù case. didn‚Äôt sterling job Vietname, Taiwan, South Korea did, very, far fuck America experiencing. new cases graph, select ""7 day moving average"" get better view.

The ride started. 

Please keep arms inside ride times! Basically. see graphs (further down) compare: Europe went first wave recently, US never really left it. cant talk country that's nearly 4 million square miles broad terms meant Easter 2030 like call third surge since imho waves end next one starts nothing ever really ended. social distancing try accomplish impossible. Yep, glad they're cutting 11000 AHS jobs, outsource 9700 them. /s It‚Äôs uncomfortable truth now. much better! Don‚Äôt give hope always struggle better tomorrow No. Herd immunity means 80-90 percent people developed natural immunity.

At rate take years get level, along millions deaths.

That's assuming possible all, know long immunity even lasts.    Don‚Äôt trust idiots. confident understanding. Mask wearing reduces spread viral load upon exposure. Lol they're forgetting they're slaves.

 Imagine grown healthy man millions told lol. Reject science say, phrase speaking science religion. There‚Äôs science different respected health officials world, one even noble prize winner saying what‚Äôs done crime humanity. guess reject science right? People trust guys like fauci proven way handled HIV scare he‚Äôs corrupt. helped pushed medicine shelved dangerous cancer patients somehow perfect HIV. Well medicine ended killing thousands people. Also think close 30 billion given cronies create vaccine still hasn‚Äôt made. People say sloganeering terms like trust science absolutely clue science actually is. You‚Äôre mindless NPC‚Äôs repeat media buzz words ""We‚Äôre going win much you‚Äôre going sick tired.""

He got last bit right. infection rate 10x first locked down. around 42k new cases UK per day estimated 100-150k cases per day locked down

False.

On March 23rd Boris Johnson said people stay home 661 five day average new cases. Today there's 21,226.

I mean, guess right, there's actually 32x increase.

Nice try gaslighting. back putting antibacterials soaps causing bacteria mutate form resistance it. Alcohol acts differently straight denatures proteins cells. Can't mutate resistance they're dead point. could post archive link would great, thanks! 

We can‚Äôt see Europe ""do dull thy palm entertainment"" they‚Äôre trying force way home though, threat large knife ready enough deter people. Wbt Australia mate? NJ, specifically northern NJ, starting increase though. We‚Äôre seeing 2k cases day NY hits double population. You‚Äôre gonna get COVID, hope enough tubes breathe. Florida doesn‚Äôt think COVID-19 real. Well thing hard know. Keep mind surveys 1/4 NYC April. vastly undercounted there. bad, calling worse seems tad premature (esp far deaths then) Oh really? case numbers today? think boils education. doesn‚Äôt take governmental level corruption, dishonesty, cruelty virus become potent humans. Really boils human consumption diseased meats. That‚Äôs America tight controls hunted deer meat. American deer population carries potent disease infests organs proven highly fatal. transferred humans said disease disastrous. Think back H1N1 swine flu 2009. one immediately jumped onto ‚ÄúAmerica biologically engineering pig viruses‚Äù biochemical warfare bullshit. abundantly clear evidence yet China engineering propagating COVID 19 anymore America 2009. answer simple. America hates China using global pandemic spread hate China.

I investigating origin COVID 19. It‚Äôs also unfair accuse entire country foul play concrete evidence. Opposed non-global pandemic? Ah, yes, let's talk two countries used masks part comprehensive response including (especially Singapore) extremely aggressive widescale testing, contact tracing, inbound travel quarantining addition mask mandates. think proving point me. 

Let's also note Singapore's lowest record temperature record 66¬∞F much Vietnam similar climate.

If I'm troll advocating wearing mask - even things hard - golly, I'm troll. mean lot places are. like Florida cares acting responsibly. vaccine distributed regular occurrence. hope test negative, sorry friend dingus. went friend wearing mask came drop something last week. couple days later said exposed (exposure saw me, ultimately tested negative) saying call 15 odd people saw two days said exposure. she‚Äôs ‚Äútaking seriously.‚Äù Worst part, dad, day found exposed went dentist appointment without telling anyone might it. people don‚Äôt care. 17% positive rate high numbers, many cases certainly missed. True infection numbers quite likely 100K+. Sweden clearly European might bit demanding, talk lots people clear picture infection risk (me included).

So ""some main sources"" cut me.

For example, German cities forbid eating walking main street now. clue prevent people using eating excuse wear mask, found something else. hear Denmark danish industry comprised inelastic goods swedish one relies bit elastic consumer goods services. danish industries know getting work corona. looking like Pfizer first Moderna Astrazenica far behind. J J, works, months behind invite over?? BES? paying attention sub couple months ago. exactly roomates got it. 2 3 got it. didnt bother getting tested. scary part previous upticks seemed super spreader events behind them, absent repeated events May July, spread calmed returned baseline

I think incorrect assumption basically Trump logic. pretty likely current outbreaks caused super spreader events, contact tracing efforts woefully inadequate. super-spreader events contact trace them, know them. virus' spreading patterns magically change months. 

The problems contact tracing actually gets even worse break geographically well. heard NPR morning Harris County (TX), half patients called contact tracers fully cooperative (e.g. say bar party 30 people, divulge names), full quarter patients called straight hostile them. Good luck identifying super spreader event conditions.  Yeah think fair bet replying someone known getting great grades Legit like people charge afraid seeming rude vs staying safe keeping people safe. American glad banned travel us cause I'm like, good we're idiots let us spread XD Good thing he‚Äôs speaking elderly gather crowds. Fuking hell, there? mind-boggling numbers.

Also, wtf people replies saying ""Good see"" ""Great news""? Hopefully! rounding turn boy country getting stats from. vaccine program! middle pandemic! There's big difference toppling Saddam Hussein helping deliver vaccines! Especially getting rid virus worldwide completely America's best interests.  I‚Äôm scientist, thinking bit different. virus keeps spreading like would change mutate? It‚Äôs great success. feel like really gearing big announcement sooner later Fauci obviously knows talking about. Fantastic! investing rural / suburban real estate going good choice while. part ""permanent lung damage, high risk stroke, heart disease, death"" hard understand? fair, think country get worse US per capita basis California fewer deaths states hit ""wave"" (NE, South, upper midwest).   Yep. It‚Äôs schools workplaces. Neither open failure gop provide support. Parents fucked right now. Single parents especially. Americans died result Covid died combat wars we've fought aside WW2. phrase three first phase. guess Russia  basis? study implies false reporting you? Agreed. digressing OG comment. Masks dangerous. indeed become much political. must exhausting constantly see meaning writings even author didn't. seem overly sensitive. work that.  states New York New England states restrict interstate travel requiring self-quarantine people higher risk states. However, there's enforcement. government checking people state borders. There's monitoring. announce media expect people comply.

Because enforcement considered act war. forget Cuomo behaved shit first I‚Äôm powerful assholes get karma like plenty innocent victims included ‚ÄúGeorgians‚Äù helpless stop idiocy pols didn‚Äôt vote neighbors can‚Äôt control. under-reporting, under-counting all, many numbers might know even little look data set, still extract usable information.

To particular piece info positivity rate. Govt reduce number tests, random testing positivity rate expected shoot high cases. Fortunately witnessing small positivity rate. seeing result holiday, result virus current policies. covid completely control. result r0.

Guess what's coming tho?! Holiday season! We're fucked. thing Indy. Except I‚Äôm partying much getting faded home girl Darn tests huge number deaths due suicides, drug abuse lack screening conditions. young sacrificed 85 year olds already critically ill anyway. Laws land. US follows different rules better worse that's can't simply strong hold tell people  I'm going use alcohol expensive, effective viruses 70% entire point using soap effective cheap. There's problem using produce. Rinses easily. know 10% enough not. arrive percentage? You‚Äôre totally right. nations Europe adopted strategy mass-testing eliminate low levels cases summer. Could stalled second wave we're experiencing. Good see Slovakia it.  one them. know look stats prove exact opposite this, right? NYC we‚Äôve holding steady 5 months *insanely* low metrics. spikes incredibly insular religious communities. initial hit 80x worse reported since hit us tests even thing people luxury able like, ‚ÄúI flu, gonna ride home.‚Äù didn‚Äôt spread continued bit, January March truly control damn near everyone it. Serious question. constant mass testing positive numbers coming people feel sick get tested Dr. Office hospital? Anyone know? France recovered multiple ass whooping (early) modern wars, France whole recover, concern many French people not. may true. New Zealand eradicated virus

Yeah. even got *zero cases*. Only, soon reopened, even tight border security, cases managed leak anyway.

You can't keep virus ""suppressed"" unless remain shut off. simply inevitable. sure they're definitely trying.

Contrast certain first world democratic country leader mentioned something cases testing i.e. test = positives. country whose leader championed drug work, said bleach UV cure, wear masks, masks become political statement. think bigger liar? :: Thinking Guy Meme :: ""Can't overwhelm hospital systems send people home die!""  Sacre bleu love going night specifically quiet many people around. im forced go time people do.... Logic 100  hope still stay safe.

My stepdad doctor's appt fourth county went red/critical.

Scares me. better Belgium Czechia awful low bar though, lol. Europeans killed economy bungling virus response order save economy.

Twice.  country, Canada.

I chaulk generations people never really hardship, get bored. 100 deaths, stores toilet paper due hoarding. Now, 1,100,000+ global deaths later, entirely boring. 

Its like homer roof meteor impact. ""Whats taking thing long?""

My work making massive push send everyone back offices. People 100% work home. Why? need many middle management work getting done home?

Middle management going literally kill people justify job.  That's infections, many deaths? Sorry. think. You‚Äôll another healthy person state virus control. deafness, nose blind, heart attack, strokes, sticky blood flu? Please cite source that. new norm middle/upper middle classes.

Poor folks kids going dealing higher risks. someone mentioned below, rate actually much lower. last peak took month top out.

We‚Äôre two weeks in, already worse. saying crowing coming China well pandemic managed - best - tone-deaf given likely origin (and indeed 'wet market', type thing illegal country - say animal welfare countries across board West high). Temperature checks really effective stopping spread. like secret sign carrying covid, fever, going know quite right. nothing detect asymptomatic carriers. nothing without vaccine. People taking chances. That‚Äôs people do. Holy moly! That‚Äôs like 250k cases USA. Great, that's exactly need right now, sigh. none people actually follow news?

Because early spring us watched South Korea put clinic control virus without widespread lockdowns lot less time prepare it. Good know, thanks. 99.75% care life. college student's road. 
 woman forced shut small business road. We've severely impacted different ways, trying protect 15% population. anything, we've selfless. system designed, happens cities stop taking transfers?  it‚Äôs done NYC large, Manhattan much clear hot spots well. yes, it‚Äôs primarily Hasidic communities here. subways made shit like 80x worse reported months January April that‚Äôs haven‚Äôt seen spikes really; ran us exposed us insanely fast ran people infect part. get want safety data there‚Äôs thousand people dying day. 40% country fallen prey disinformation campaign tells masks work virus danger. everybody busy election anecdotal accounts really help.  China huge country cases could covered up. right life largely back normal mean problems gone away. Oh yeah. Forgot that. Ahhh. Got it. Thank you. One important difference people France actually get treatment number deaths stays relatively low. Please stay NYC. enough New Englanders never left last year. 

ThankYouVeryMuch. I'm non partisan essential worker never took day this, watched media freak crash economy, people make unemployment do. 

Way get topic btw, pent watching much media. preach hate days, chill screen go drink water. Conservative states know people concerned virus reluctant go vote people conservative think flu vote regardless. Covid politicized weaponized since pandemic began. sad reality hit wave, tsunami. 

Good luck America. product extreme conservative movement mostly ignored past decade. must learn expendable. Go vote! Young population (comparatively) low obesity rate surely helps that. Mississippi West Virginia getting hit hard... good lord. yep that's reason. shools spreadding virus differnt families goes link evidence? disregard age distribution fact far better job isolating elderly spring. majority infections occur less 50 years age. 

As group, less 50 IFR 1/8000 0.0125%. 48X less 0.6% number using. Whoever described Spain success story? They've bad since beginning. I've seen lot things even dumber here. 

you need put /s else people think one many idiots here. holy shit. live Ontario, city 350k. 10 day, even 70 week. got long term care migrant farmers control, rather quite far. aren‚Äôt nazis unless waving nazi flags endorsing nazi ideology, call ‚Äúfar right‚Äù want resorting calling opposition ‚Äúnazis‚Äù argument. doctor detained giving people warning approved state. That's evidence. strongly need address this. Yes, 7 Melbourne Australia. lockdown 7months now. Yes, locked whole state opened regional city still lockdown. went 700 cases 7 previous day 1. small outbreak believe control. mandatory masks there's fine. curfew since lifted. worked. politics ridiculous people literally comparing premier Dictators, like Hitler  Genghis Khan. Saying killed people contracted virus mix fair isnt clear still. im greatful par UK one stage. matter side. Nothings ever good enough. goodluck It‚Äôs totally choice want wear mask rest eternity doesn‚Äôt harm anyone I‚Äôll tell rn it‚Äôs required wear mask health others finished lüòÇ CAN'T TASTE ANYTHING Pick pick pick Christ, overrule 1st class compartments 1st class paengers pandemic? Sell regular tickets spread passangers better. Obviously we're coming 2 different realities. Actually I'm amazed supposedly American citizen, yet seem quite detached what's going on. New York City turned ghost town. commerical real estate market collapsing store-owners either can't make rent closing good!!! national eviction crisis moratoriams expire back rents come due. new you? Give 48 hours. Yea, fuck shit guy gotten. Literally everything he's said taken context. going get idea we'll see two single doses. either way okay awhile. Shut dipshit I'm proud strategy nonetheless. would've preferable far issues did

Uh. issues *because strategy work*. still proud? get this... happy nontraditional thanksgiving. Mine Cthucku, duck, crab, octopus. one else likes meal plan besides fiance I, protect people quirky meal. Netherlands hot either: 10,202 cases today, equivalent 198,000 US cases best testing!! still fucking morons Canada. mother laws (lesbian couple) two them.... think there's another strain cause reinfection. starting again. think put work, 100,000/day totally attainable thing causing across world, schools reopening. Border needs stay closed till US gets shit together virus first Sturgis many months ago. attributing issue exclusively Sturgis gives state local politicians easy out. merely providing context shows factor explain Sweden performed poorly Nordic countries.

Also depends type exports talking about. exports impacted way lockdowns domestically abroad. Third. Wave 1 April, 2 late July, 3 now. Population density one misleading stats surely know yourself. ignore almost entire population lives area third total? giant forests north surely keep people stockholm infecting other, lol true germany going way I‚Äôm sorry assumed assumptions made.  idea enough people living North Dakota even 737 weekly cases per 100k.    Actually can, nazis shouldnt allowed protest cause fucking nazis. little late. March? 7 million cases 250k deaths time say ‚Äúhey take seriously‚Äù don‚Äôt know strong evidence. sources? duh, nothing life involves 0% risk. Many things happened implement excessive, reactionary shutdowns promote fear mongering 7 months. gender roles part especially. There's still little evidence reopening schools drives COVID spread, there's ton evidence remote learning reverts women's gender roles back 1950s. Hopefully mayor. asked question. sub weird. checked. British Airways BA 1506 flying New York London. news about? yeh should. start acting like beginning we're lost won‚Äôt last another two years, mean restrictions. People simply going stop following rules. really think good chunk people won‚Äôt kiss first date cause this, crazy. People fuck without condom first date sometimes, hell would people, especially young people, kiss someone first date fear disease age group almost certainly kill barely even harm them. thing is, it‚Äôs like people kissing right now. thing nobody gives af. know Reddit seems like everyone shutting it‚Äôs going like
that while, fact matter young people don‚Äôt give af, people done it, people want lives back. Wether good bad spread disease (Which imagine bad, people would die obviously) irrelevant nobody gives af. Believe mate, 7 months self-isolating pretty much laugh anything everything. ü§™ü§™ü§™ Yep. Well that's reach. Less control measures leaving individual states, cities counties = tyranny fascism? Alrighty. We‚Äôre much better treating people, enough hospital capacity. See argument rests idea people get covid tests. ‚Äúmom code‚Äù real basically everyone know agreed get covid tests unless gravely sick admitted hospital. won‚Äôt pressure schools close covid detected. Anything indoor, poor recycled ventilation Never thought I‚Äôd say words damn proud Chris Christie. got ICU made sure get national television tell many republicans would listen need masks shouldnt political.

It take near-death experience nonetheless. Hunker can. like zombie outbreak, instead regular zombie movie it‚Äôs brain eating meme disease. America totally *that* kid guess schools work long know keep safe, need hide world. serious situation long continue take seriously, alright.

Whenever put mask take mask off, santize hands first could touched something god forbid gets sick touching face. also get tested regularly. every 6 weeks peace mind. I'd rather able tell people I'm positive gets hand wait I'm gasping air tell them, yeah guess I'm positive. No.  Thanksgiving coming up, millions people country seem think ignore virus everything OK, Trump continues downplay pandemic handled skill grace bag dead cats, turn listened said millions...

I'd bet every dollar name going happen people continue bleat ""the flu's dangerous"" patently untrue blitherings. First snow today Salt Lake city... pretty cold carve pumpkins inside. transfer patient may ultimate destination. transfer ER ER right now. gives receiving hospital option transfer again. helps nearest receiving hospital getting full. yes, point run space. made several assumptions subject's character based nothing comments thread anonymous internet forum. world shitty fucked one would someone believe ""the truth"". psychologically consistent hours? know eat get reddit first thing morning, real diva.

Perhaps seek help. Yeah don‚Äôt think would smart going see elitist ""As American, hell going there!"" bullshit saw way around three past months wrt europe? many times worse per capita america? still doesn‚Äôt mean said false. 

Schools cases spiking. Cases spiking weather getting cooler, fewer outdoor gatherings, indoor ones virus survive longer transferred easier. People let guard around friends/family obviously don‚Äôt wear mask social distance. 

Unless schools, want count colleges, again, spikes traced back mostly house parties, aka gathering privately. inability people practice self control biggest factor rising cases across entire world, honestly. possibly developed remote village Yunnan someon travelled Wuhan, pandemic erupted.

Do think there‚Äôs chance originated Wuhan Institute Virology? course year doctors learned effective treatments, able save patients. since you‚Äôre seeing total number cases go up, numbers deaths staying show percentage survivors increasing number deaths decreasing. comparing excess death numbers reported ones?  That's strange... thought Spain supposed *success* story.

Precisely problem comparing countries others terms well handled pandemic. in, ""Country better Country B."" True. Potential life chronic conditions. Thank you. Genocide harsh word. Swedes stop brainwashed fucking something situation caused one die.

If not....well thats falut isnt it?

But would really fucking nice get smug asshats way aswell ngl.   never thought stupid phrase is. Corners pointy. That‚Äôs also big cities 

The real question per capita rate per borough  Exactly saying. Everyone went indoors spread virus around June July got hot. spread like NY Feb, March, April people outdoors. I‚Äôve similar close calls far haven‚Äôt caught it. hold breath maneuvering past people though, sometimes squeeze eyes shut too.

You fine. learn relearn lesson exponential spread every single time. death rate goes way down. 137 people may fine. Winter coming... played league, lets say quit. I‚Äôm at. We‚Äôre praying vaccine June 2021. think millions people really estimating possible/effective might be. 

It‚Äôs possible covid ends pretty vax resistant. It‚Äôs guarentee get vax works. It‚Äôs possible virus mutates becomes yearly infection like flu. 

We passed point return like May. vaccine hope now, don‚Äôt think people realize scary Noooo can't bring question idea society might fundamental flaws disabling handling effective pandemic response, young people! young people parties tide pods! They're cause this! Belgium mask mandates ignored idiots cover nose. Masks help, wonder bad would without country.

But high population density might explain high. know like people offices rather own, people house parties, seeing relatives, etc. 

And schools? open? 2.6% Americans it.

I'm literally going high school tomorrow full trains mornings evenings since SBB also loves putting reduced compositions rush hours. ""We're everything avoid second lockdown"" ass. way mitigate virus, perhaps small piece cloth worn part body something. Yes exactly? Go shopping milk eggs without mask 5 minutes? Spend whole weekend clubbing kissing randos dance floors? wondering level action think could led getting sick. Turning corner, turning corner, turning corner. Honestly that‚Äôs better Christian doctrine. Christians never, ever come single rebuttal problem evil. haven‚Äôt tried 2000 years. . . Ty! Westerners going tell ""this true look Europe! Trump!"" Asia done really good job across variety countries variety income levels widely varied government types. possible achieve 80% normality well organized government response, instead fluctuating 0% 100% open. think us thought Ford OK job implemented new restrictions Thanksgiving weekend two o‚Äôclock afternoon Friday long weekend. (for Ottawa GTA) him.  He's dumb, he's job explaining position administration ""Why start trying now?""

It's great put significant effort behind vaccines medical treatments. ignoring preventive measures working tracing quarantine measures idiotic. Hey don‚Äôt want engage fracking either, lose money $40/barrel Yeah starting stand Fort St John too. like scene Blazing saddles preacher said ""I'm leaving"". New York done 1.5x many tests Australia though. Hard compare total case numbers. Even neighbours north Canada never this, fact mask wearing seen good thing conservatives liberals there

Mostly. still fair amount conservative resistance Canada, mostly drowned halfhearted widespread support. informative. rare see TTI organisation actually willing share meaningful data get grasp people infect others.

On hand, quite sobering seem started backtrace cases now, sporadically. Explains lot. *heated* mask? something wear I‚Äôm stating see increasing posts people link article proceed push agenda comments. Usually anti lockdown bs. It‚Äôs really frustrating. testing done, long eclipsed.

Guys. Please vote. cannot imagine US, one powerful countries, educated country, science deniers. cannot continue. need make sure proper mitigation factors, whether therapies vaccines treatments, make sure people die this

Translation: monoclonal antibodies afford them, palliative care dying home everyone else sounds scary empathy, but, sorely tried complete lack good exhibited deniers. know compassion anti science proponents fall ill covid tainted justifications karma pandemic. fear feel health, poor choices last 50 years likely mean poorer outcome optimal. vigilant contract this, but, still work. wish well, even deniers, hope get pass me! I'm using example lack awareness average person. Even family get all. virus brown skin spoke Spanish, would get attention Trump administration. Uhhh predominantly Mormon state. doesn‚Äôt seem Christian me. Remember get lot help Denmark, people maybe realisere case places. Okay $40 barrel lose money turning shale wells. fact come online massive production anytime oil rises towards $50 enough keep OPEC countries producing cheap oil indefinitely means fracking already effectively dead virtue price oil. *Did* say contain mitigation? 

Or say developing treatments? Yes?

IIRC, Denmark deaths people given ventilator. didn‚Äôt jam tube every sick elderly person either. Loser internet thinks know better medical experts. timeless classic. American following ""freedom fighting"" anti-makers northern BC, Canada. Many us take seriously too. think lucky far, low population densities. numbers low right now. I'm sure fare winter, 20-30 weather monthes end low sunlight. update, right time 7 day average dropped posted, 18 days later 50% higher. right now, clusters mostly University students congregating outside class lot classes online. sounds like virus works.  Ok. probably reduce least 10% soap 40% water 50% alcohol. I'm sure alcohol water mix. using packaging ok. using produce that's still way much soap. 

The way soap works chemically binds oil water. soap bind oil virus break up. binding water washing away. water mixture I'm sure washing away not. 

This swallowing tide pod stupidly dangerous. tide pod concentrated soap. someone swallows it, binds oils/fats waters throat ripping apart destroying it. basically punishment then. nothing NFL team worth 2.3 billion. joke. exactly *needs* **federal** law mandating masks **right fucking now**.

In many ways doesn‚Äôt go far enough however, often even people wear masks wrongly. fault own. happens. reason task force specialists monitor masks worn correctly. spread communities work.

As part that, people willfully put fellow citizens danger need identified. obviously includes anybody voted Trump. people special insignia masks identified authorities sake public good.

Their children perhaps slightly less conspicuous symbol masks ‚Äî something identify real risk result raised enemies society science.

As part new nationwide emphasis public health, citizens encouraged identify people ‚Äúenemies‚Äù progress. identified, individuals given chance repent change ways. progress course need monitored government, third type insignia masks, ease identification.

To facilitate compliance new public health measures, new agency government created. task force mentioned easily adopted work. individuals employed federal government identified such. help gain measure trust population. jobs keep files individuals within purview, update files regularly track progress.

Obviously people willingly violate new mask law separated society ‚Äî good society, well good. dealt humanely fairly. like Nazis. individuals simply separated families society moved safe place time being. perfectly humane fair. safe places seek educate evil ways harm world. re-educated returned society. course repeat offenders dealt little harshly. 

But benefit. Eventually individuals proven menace society danger security state, permanently removed. done humanely, key done good collective whole. system really space individualism. selfish attitude exactly got us trouble first place.

So selfish activity controlled aspects society, especially economic realm. Individuals allowed hoard cash. progressive tax policy course help redistributed, aid less fortunate. cash hoarding outlawed, banks reason exist. probably done away first. People run banks identified enemies state placed camps see error ways returned society. course allowed enter advantageous position, somewhere near base, reduced manual tasks help greater good. Needless say also special insignia masks identifies part dangerous class individuals.

Business owners stripes receive treatment managers banks. course understanding welcome opportunity make amends society. However will, protection, removed society.

There measures taken vis-a-vis bourgeoisie brought much pain unto country. tackled later.

**The important thing 100% fucking law leave house without wearing mask.**

Frankly require wearing even home even you‚Äôre alone. simply strictly outlawed public. Anybody caught flaunting important rule dealt harshly. Penalties enough. Imprisonment, indefinite period (at least year, five even ten years) first time offenders. exceptions, appeals. Second-time offenders sent top secret camps permanently. camps degenerates repeat violators laws. security reasons limits small group security professionals special clearance. Red Cross international organizations allowed anywhere near premises. make sure harmful individuals kept sight mind. fair, correct, proper measures taken people willfully go public without masks. It‚Äôs already started states. Yeah 0.001% population bodybuilders! can't simple measure also includes them? :/ Excess deaths nations deaths relation previous 5 years, super relevant metric, especially since countries define covid death differently, actual deaths / capita year tells likely citizens die pandemic IMO relevant metric use attempting evaluate quality public health.

To make rather stupid example, take Usain Bolts personal best running 100m compare last 5 years would see decline performance. might even see rather dramatic decline percentage. compare decline last 5 years, probably would lot better numbers him. says nothing fast running 100m though, would rather silly make sort negative judgment Usain Bolts running getting faster getting slower. would still run circles around me.

This find bizarre selective outrage Sweden, journalistic moral hit pieces towards Sweden people dying covid, less people dying total per capita year even Nordic countries (not Norway though remember correctly). Especially since argument lock broader view public health focusing covid. Jesus christ serious That‚Äôs true. difference snow won‚Äôt last much week.

Some snow lower temps isn‚Äôt abnormal late fall weather 

Albeit little odd year, enhanced climate change. full winter. snow doesn‚Äôt leave.  modern medicine, would probably less dangerous. figure outdated, covid-19 probably killed million people already. Interestingly, speculated Russian flu also caused coronavirus nowadays one common cold coronaviruses. Richard Horton, editor-in-chief world‚Äôs respected medical journal, Lancet, last month provocatively titled column ‚ÄúCOVID-19 pandemic.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe must confront fact taking far narrow approach managing outbreak new coronavirus,‚Äù wrote, noting virus interacting array non-communicable diseases ‚Äúclustering within social groups according patterns inequality deeply embedded societies.‚Äù

Rather pandemic, wrote, COVID-19 syndemic.

What syndemic? set linked health problems interact synergistically contribute excess burden disease population. Merril Singer, medical anthropologist coined term, notes syndemics occur health-related problems cluster. Last winter, baby start finish 30 minutes. Even sounds better winter upcoming. Australia reporting in, 140% population Netherlands 21 new cases yesterday, gigantic island surrounded water helpful, we've also locked pretty hard non essential business closed late March / early April re-opening early late June depending propose prevent students skipping classes online? Ooooof - I'm sorry giving unsolicited advice. hate people already damn thing they're suggesting. Hope make feel worse. Please hang there. know thoughts come nowhere, seems worth stick around see come terrible nowhere dark time. dare express measured viewpoint! /s It‚Äôs possible asymptomatic point. Studies place, minimum equal number people don‚Äôt get symptoms compared positive cases. 

It would take couple antibody tests confirm aren‚Äôt accurate. Americans want believe fake need be. numbers real means US failed non-white people succeeded. never overwhelmed sense people denied care\* severely ill, read case someone removed ICU give spot someone else. ICU capacity doubled (from 580 1200 included bed, ventilators equipment staff). example, field hospital built √Ñlvsj√∂, Stockholm never used, first operational week 140 hospital beds 30 ICU's last March, finished 540 hospital beds 100 ICU beds mid april, de-mounted June. 

\*One reason might course big mess medical evaluations site elderly homes ordered palliative care, would probably never get ICU treatment without triage anyway, widespread still investigation. That's studies work would think using death date occurrence.

Here data sources anybody interested would, bit hungover spreadsheets would make head spin. Population density one misleading stats surely know yourself. ignore almost entire population lives area third total? 

Population density misleading. really complaining giving correct population density number. Population density depends area; close 0 seas, high urbanised areas, low rural areas. Good question. Perhaps could relative wave people going back school testing even slightest symptoms. son tested couldn‚Äôt taste Mac n cheese one meal. fine. Tested negative. Many schools sending kids home symptoms, requesting test clearance? Colleges? really don‚Äôt know, could possibility. thoughts this? would love hear counter argument ‚Äúthird wave‚Äù worse previous based data presented far. there's lame duck, anyone voted incentive anything, sets opposite-party successors failure. Curfews means nothing. Virus spreading poor ventilation. Could work, restaurant stuffy home multiple generations. Take vitamins, wear mask, wash hands, social distance.

Serious question. go lockdown again? point enough going enough? wait n hope new president something? governor put restrictions place nobody area following them. Even coworker test positive last week. didn‚Äôt shut inform public. sure, I've lived year. get outside Paris, nicer people are, necessarily fair put French Parisians category. Republicans would rather burn country ground allow PR DC get voting representatives Congress. would kill chances power all. They'd something horrible, like change party platform fit needs desires American population. possibly that! Wow Thank kind comments. support much appreciated! One largest obstacles facing schools right often ratio hundreds kids one school nurse. school, 600+ kids one nurse. busy dealing day day injuries, severe allergic reactions, diabetic students, seizures, girls starting periods first time, flu shot clinics, etc, enough go around deal COVID crisis too. Many feverish vomiting kids stay class parents answer phones even worse, phones longer service due lack money pay bill. schools barely hanging there, folks. desperately need guidance support take better care kids.   don‚Äôt know, don‚Äôt regularly criticize women post naked online least going me. get infected spray eyes, smearing hands aerosols. Masks protect you, protect others. Even did, likely wear correctly.

I forgot bookmark random claim: SARS 1, people wearing multiple masks likely get infected. One mask, one face shield better off. scientifically tested, obvious me: wearing masks; likely take off, breathing heavily lifting mask face.

Also recommend gloves. notice touch face wear some. Medical gloves worn long time, may increase vulnerability.

The art mask wearing currently 90 % guesswork, take personal opinion, fact. doesn‚Äôt get graded fail class? aaah got basically lets ignore whole pandemic thing move lives really we'll probably die shit. task force something. ""Why care virus? higher chance dying car accident!"" kick rocks. School re-opening super spreader event time. current military members go VA hospitals? Sure, people die. I'm saying over. 

What would say, though, case number paranoia unwarranted lead life-destroying restrictions.

Someone coined term, ""casedemic"" what's going now. Tons new cases, 80% virtually asymptomatic, due tons testing. Huge numbers used scare everyone accepting whatever governments throw them. lol No, ""hope"" us fairly low positive rate.  One emotional social distanced Christmas yet. Terrifying brakes people willfully refusing use them. Oh, lol, thought talking ethics trial lol. Putain de merde!  virus circulating countries already, closing borders make difference. leaders smart, dealt well. paid there. several superbugs. chain medical supplies treat same. It‚Äôs state Maria (MA) Nobody guaranteed 10-20 years. Older people realistic know risk falling seriously ill, dying, little notice.

If actually talk people older generations, may surprised. Mine gone wars aftermath, like economic ruin, homelessness, refugee, rape occupation forces, etc. COVID one thing lives, like bad flu years late 1950's, recent years. survived much, seen many families die catastrophic things, major them.

My fear dying Pershing II much real fear dying COVID.

It's similar terrorist attack, many Americans ask cancel holiday Europe. western Europeans remind we've dealing terror attacks since 1950's, cannot let stop us going life.

I really encourage conversation, building resentment sides.

As dying isolated alone, many many elderly people done year COVID. able see family due restrictions. deteriorated much child could visit, parent already mentally gone forever. know many situation said would rather see loved ones risk death. Suit yourself. I've definitely hooked people whose name know. Ahh. hoping. I've seen enough people mimic words seriously never know anymore. Lol America trying really hard let India get top. like winning y'all. Numbers record like even weekend, scary. inspired news [Scottish COVID-19 patient kept ventilator 68 days later recovered. countries would given long, admirable. 

It touching hear many Vietnamese people volunteered donate lungs published news patient required lung transplant. think shows Vietnamese people selfless generous.

I visited country tourist, amazing - taken friends Vietnamese restaurants try Pho. can't wait visit COVID over. getting worse long? Australia second outbreak sub 10 cases couple months later, yet US seems like control whatsoever half year Ya testing properly probably really bad feeling Hawaii reopened tourism. Especially outer islands healthcare capacity handle outbreaks. correct. Proportionally, that's somewhere around 2x worst day new cases US. think we're month behind guys terms opening schools. plan also included Mrs Claus elves, intended use the
actors mouthpieces encourage widespread vaccine usage.  Talk kids get parents vaccinate.

Sounds like spitball brainstorming session got recorded. isn‚Äôt death rate declining?  

Of course doesn‚Äôt fit fear mongering narrative, we‚Äôll ignore fact. take issue women staying home. Jobs pay well enough new norm. Schools still critical daycares parents work. That's reopen schools first place despite danger it. value human life. always sneaking suspicion Trump president whole thing would considered ""survival fittest."" hurr durr America dumb Europe teh smrt

&amp;#x200B;

/s 731 cases Japan 10 time population Netherlands 1/2th US Next week though. can't imagine ignorant standard living much world.

Also bad place live, many immigrants risking much come here. person obtuse worthy response. hoping add another number somehow make awkward. Yes. party nominee would listen experts. Experts like said virus airborne, don‚Äôt wear masks travel bans. fact recently 2 weeks ago, said lockdowns shouldn‚Äôt occur. 

The party would resulted deaths. Look many people infected swine flu compared coronavirus. got lucky fatality rate lower. could refer resulting conditions ""lifelong chronic"" virus even around year yet, long term studies? Also, may realize effects happen [any extremely rare. France: Hold baguette Well currently convenient US. thread generates 2PM UTC, means 3PM Central European Time (most European Union), 10PM China Time. China, two hours correct date, rest day, sticky post date yersterday.

A thread generated 8AM UTC would convenient Europe US, kind ok Asia. 200k day Europe, it‚Äôs US thing.  *it hurt confusion* ;) Thx.

Yeah big west. Hardly. Europe worse.

In Czech we're seeing 15k day would 500k US. Third wave yup, gonna say! 100% agree actuality daily cases US probably around 250K per day higher. schools. mean colleges? k12 schools open state seeing surge. colleges thier problems (freaking fraternities). small towns college influence also seeing surge. They've done plenty. countries like Italy done everything could second wave. Meadows correct. mitigate cannot control this. Yeah, think Canada admit there's serious bifurcation big city rest country. doubt much urban density either - probably behavioural sociological difference. already said elevator? They're** /s think second wave officially ""start"" around Thanksgiving/Black Friday.

Massive amounts people gathering together, grandparents sitting Thanksgiving table grandkids school.. 

Colder weather creeping up.. Week Thanksgiving going wild. ... ...uh what? many countries exist vaccinated all? Russia ? Oh okay. there‚Äôs also fact nobody seems give fuck virus anymore. town, even waitresses cops don‚Äôt wear masks. Based data Johns Hopkins, never left first wave. turning tsunami. Yeah way expensive. completely unrelated note, many trillions dollars stimulus spend 6 months? correct. Chris Christie part Trump's team helping prep first debate Biden. He's part problem (not user reddit calling like commenter implies) amount fake pleas apologies make believe he's suddenly good guy way. shit Obama hurricane ravaged New Jersey. loves playing centrist convenient get speaking gigs. Sorry I‚Äôm gonna forgive guy spending six months downplaying virus spent week ventilator change heart.

If anything proves opinions absolutely worthless incapable understanding anything doesn‚Äôt directly affect him. 

He fuck shame, Republican going listen anyway. they‚Äôre still going anything mitigate I‚Äôm sure point is. first wave Spanish Flu end? successfully ""stop"" virus? 200,000 weren‚Äôt lucky Right?? People SHIT. Idk agree 80% I've seen. I've stuck working I've drive though La, valleys, I.E orange county I've seen large portion people disregarding masks. Including businesses lax enforcing mask rule. 80% true, wish could see it. yea state way lackadaisical comes enforcing anything. beaches packed people without masks one says thing. nations simply don't. mental gymnastics insane west. Fake news, latching old outdated statements masks, adamant wear mask oppression freedoms. least responsibility individuals I'm afraid. Due scarce jobs, see many cases single family member feeding whole family, even extended family members. put stress family relationships. New Hampshire justify lockdown motto ‚Äùlive free die‚Äù? say Titans fined instances failure comply requirements wearing masks insufficient clear communication regarding workouts outside facility. individual -- including Tennessee general manager Jon Robinson head coach Mike Vrabel -- face discipline. despite 24 positive COVID cases contributed multiple disruptions league schedule, Titans avoided severe punishments league threatened calls memos clubs, forfeitures lost draft picks. team told escalated discipline instances COVID-19 protocol violations. can't believe he's saying need control spread vaccine coming. Vaccines go healthy people prevent becoming infected, meaning would useless everyone gets sick now. test cases. Duh Source? reason conversation suddenly Sweden neighbours, opposed Europe? sporting events county. Went less 30 cases almost 300 like week half. thing is, concept ""social distancing"" hard define. like we're carrying around metersticks yardsticks everywhere go. also like ""six feet"" ""two meters"" magical numbers virus. general guidelines, all; makes six feet acceptable, five feet eleven inches not? know definition inflation?

Yes, 

(A) assumed inflation becomes hyperinflation. EVERY nation inflates currency, hyperinflation scenarios rare

(B) completely ignored difference printing money give foreign governments, printing money give poor people country peak America's future country... Hey thanks, really appreciate kind words. I'm West Coast, BC, support grief counsellor like... 2020 epically shitty. Universities almost certainly bad. high amount mixing occurs university populations people go classes distinct groups people. Additionally, universities often make hard get assessments postpone them. Repopulate Africa? Africa one main places population control implemented? dont think vaccine comes out, mean even europe cant get virus control. what's causing spread there? restaurants bars opened up? People wearing masks much? there? I‚Äôm concerned environmental standpoint simply don‚Äôt seem know enough long term effects. seems like generates insane amounts waste water quite destructive land. think it‚Äôs reasonable think 15-20 years road far enough alternative energy development production fracking least road obsolescence? way, fracking temporary necessity? ""Spain"" ""success"" phrase? thanks, made spit drink lol ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve done nothing we‚Äôre ideas!!‚Äô White elephant (in room) I've calling third surge first wave, depends region. Well doesn‚Äôt work harder pull poverty? /s get saying. I'm speaking broader viewpoint. community, small, large city. small enough connected others way another. people traveling outside area. see masks distancing used, case counts keep going dramatically....something wrong. countries scrambling tightening restrictions losing control. Unlike Sweden.  test looks like Thanksgiving gatherings become super spreader events showing positive cases 2 weeks passed since long weekend. Except lot worrying reports people getting infected twice, infections happening months apart. Immunity guaranteed. 

Also ignoring fact DIE COVID19 mean one 20% end crippled disabled life. Given ND currently worst hit state, think? Idk getting at. like Italy lax particularly troubling return COVID Italy country done everything experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci advising. Face masks public places compulsory months, social distancing strongly enforced, nightclubs never reopened, sporting arenas less third capacity. Children back school regularly tested strictly social-distanced, yet, second wave seems completely unstoppable.

There many variables play cannot say X, Z, problem solved. entirely intended outcome gaslighting: make question experienced believe. guy wants country shut good, fuck go Ontario... Keyword: Few

You‚Äôre talking edge cases.

I‚Äôm still concerned, personally. yet, definitely start it. hope long lasting effects.

I feeling bit cardio lung training lung capacity come back, still worries me.

My boyfriend also sick end February describes feeling. breath faster months ago also feeling getting much air lungs could.

He tested antibodies yet go doctor next week ask could test him. test anyway antibodies, also. McHenry county checking in. Same. think depended neighbourhood (ie stick fundamentals). neighbourhood always pretty empty night staying away kids easy. I‚Äôve come slide contraption deliver bagged candies tons kids (if show year)  Key part social distancing possible

it's upon people judge situation. seen far good general public determining such. reason people screaming March heading back dark ages unless get pandemic control. Well arrived Dark Autumn GRRM'esque winter coming.

I never forgive republicans this. Mr Trump right doctors inflating number covid cases.

you charge medicare $70 cold flu patient.

you charge medicare five-figures corona patient. ‚ÄúWe flattened curve‚Äù 

Classic  Camacho wants _listen scientists!_ can't wait see happens careers affects whole permanently. extremely dangerous deadly virus old sick. virus dramatically affects young healthy people too. ain‚Äôt flu, it‚Äôs SARS 2.0. don‚Äôt clue you‚Äôre talking about. 

There‚Äôs reason, like said, whole world reacting way. 

The saddest part this, you‚Äôve bought propaganda rich elites saying middle lower class sacrifice lives health get it. sucker! You‚Äôre parroting baseless propaganda manipulated. Right wearing mask largely prevention, protection. mask keeps little safe, keeps everyone else much safer you‚Äôre sick. It‚Äôs question wearing masks public, it‚Äôs question whether every person interacted also wearing mask - guess no. Completely agree. friend mine going vacation Mexico, others planning fly home holidays, husbands friends planning group trip New York January hang out, I‚Äôm starting feel like insane one wanting stay home keep distancing people! We‚Äôre seeing friends outdoors I‚Äôm really worried winter. course miss friends normal interactions really miss fam (who live different state) can‚Äôt pretend everything fine I‚Äôm bored safe! Ding ding ding. Lockdown go door door?  
Government members contact tracing?  
I remember watching Japanese doc post Covid Wuhan scan barcode restaurant.  
So know been.  Yeah hell even start second one?? Unfortunately much politics vivid. Utah red staate, lockkdown.

Misspellings prevent damn bot. Oh yeah. already were. it‚Äôs confirmed. reinfection risk absurdly low. 

See page 8 this: Obviously not, dont obtuse... start pandemic, knew would over, creating vaccine. knew thing changed learning aerosols - thus masks.

Trump et al. lied would far-in-the-past, warned believe them. goalpost funded rocks, even sand hot air balloon. still follow laws regulations, no? Even though technically restrict freedom? Lol Actually, intricately connected ending war exacerbating gender imbalance ""lack men"" resulted, could argue Spanish flu fundamentally altered society, least accelerated change already underway terms women's rights jobs. plague pretty famously upended serf system massively changed economy political system worked. 

In case, pandemic likely permanently killed 9-5 5 days week office jobs favour days wfh flexibility, greatly increased online purchasing. time over, society likely condensed changes might taken decade two year two childrens' schools open phisical attendance yet. Due uptick cases, even gave another week intersession sort stuff kids chose go phisical Thoughts?

They're gaslighting us accepting grim fate conservatives care live die. barely care family/friends getting it. That‚Äôs favorite thing Fauci ‚Äî disappointed read March vaccine would take 12-18 months (from January 2020) since I‚Äôve comforted least take everything Fauci says face value. 

I can‚Äôt wait see light end tunnel.  problem encouraging children citizens report parents fellow citizen violations police? Russian trollism. numbers close enough. folks think 1,000,000 330,000,000 ain‚Äôt bad border sociopathic. UK bad government basically nut-jobs US.  speak flourish.

And look resurgence: NZ, Korea, others near zero, able respond quickly. well loosened spikes, locking down. US shtheads like DeSantis. Even Pence won‚Äôt quarantine, staff drops like flies. Great role models...
Edit sp analogy, comment bulletproof vests work. Also Ballistic Limit metric designed specifically find 50% shots specific velocity would penetrate armor. really right either. point measures kind work severe problem often work well less severe problem. 

There still chance infection everyone one person wearing mask. reduces, eliminate, chance infection. entire reason also lockdowns, social distancing regular disinfection, layered defense secure. Possible unlikely
