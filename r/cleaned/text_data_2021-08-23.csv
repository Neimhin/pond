My guess need 8+ plus weeks booster far effective.  Moderna higher dosing level longer interval. Link (Covid-19 Maternal Immunization Tracker) 

At time, shows 44 countries either recommend pregnant women vaccinated recommend exceptions. 

72 countries either recommend permit 32 countries permitting qualifications.  seems that, people, message be, like, ""formatted"" exactly right way, process it.

Like, sometimes get customer complaining something absolutely power change know change, matter whoever else tell it. But, course, pass complaint, even knowing change thing.

Then, tell customer: ""Yeah, pass complaint, change anything."" seem hear dismissal complaint go can't drop it. tell them: ""Yeah, change anything, pass complaint."" They're like ""okay, thanks"" over.

Exactly message change outcome way, apparently end statement sounds like want hear, feel acknowledged. Weird. April 21? That's right around became available. include ""only"" that? .02% according Israel male teens.

UK people waited 12 weeks get second shot. means many fresher antibodies US. couple months: data shows 6th shot protects everyone better first five Congrats! That's big deal. would upset lived masks mandatory school.  worth noting metric ton data, links myocarditis found ~170M+ doses in.

Goes show one age group exactly best predictor another. fully vaccinated, matters. Personally mind it. sways even hesitant, could save life someone innocent (child, immune compromised..) hate pits people though... people already doubt vaccine want another reason feel ok refusing get it. hopeful enough flood unvaxed. almost universal vote mail nearly every service mentioned done online. real stick blocking access entertainment, shopping social gatherings. Anti-Vaxxers scum Earth doctors still legally duty bound treat ill.

It's crazy getting downvoted. Alabama. 36% vaccination rate. Nurse. Already daughter.  

Get vaccinated? Nah.  Mother unborn child dead.  

This incredibly sad. happen again, again, again. always GoFundMe page. Exactly. regardless, doesn’t change fact fully vaccinated people allowed live almost completely normal life.   mom issue, fine now, felt tired good month two J&amp;J. long since shot? went bunch checkups make sure something coincidental bloodwork pick anything up. pretty sure COVID before. Oh shit brilliant It’s proven safe pregnant women. one point, 3 million vaccines per day, limited supply. Right now, we're 800K. administration expecting huge flurry first doses. That's going happen.  seems like Onion title. wasn’t trying say people going die year two anyways close life expectancy. trying point many deaths occur people already closer end lives. picked 512 Americans different age health demographics results could less depressing saying 1 every 512 Americans died Covid. know Canada UK call every ""shot"" ""jab"". normal term. Delta spread vaccinated people still replicates upper respiratory tract (and antibodies get point). intra-nasal vaccine stops taking hold first place.

The fact people would less resistant nasal spray helps, too. 

We might even able get herd immunity way. least one expert said way pandemic. looked database? There’s plenty kooky stuff there. yet estimates 30% vaccinated. Think vaccine like kevlar vest. need law enforcement, provide critical service. Get vaccinated!!  know aren’t same. hasn’t cancer attacked targeted scientists way covid was.?  started job Walmart currently aren’t mandating vaccines location.  people got vaccinated different country? clickbaiting pieces shit. concerned sharing them. haven’t read enough research them. def making jelly thinking glad getting vaccine feel it’s safe. Planning vax cool  Wow - totally forgot Hep B 3 shots. Sars could well 4 shots (or more) know yet. That's good. lazy read, already requirement non-unionized employees. Why? U mean people get vaccine save ICUs, IVs respirators fear needle? missing something else? Alright well ya that's kinda point then. could give emergency authorization kids well right? first, can'y say ""Mayo Clinic"" source. Please cite link.

Second, even know infection means? think infection means disease transmissibility? vast majority vaccine like MMR Sabine Polio vaccines protect infection. protect hospitalization, disease, death transmissibility (also called ""spread"" virology nomenclature). ""infected"" test positive qPCR mean person showing symptoms disease infectious (transmissible people).  I’ve read, interval doses Israel way short, like 3-4 weeks. Focusing first doses waiting 2-3 months second seems like best long-term strategy. surprise nobody, people got restaurant ownership petty tyrants also yell loudest things go way. Welp, that's gonna Facebook 48 hours.  do, bet still want everyone rushing time, especially could possibly impact first shots, higher priority.     LOL, Holy shit one rolling.  know they’re hiring testers?  call Pfizer Australia. 

Shame Prime Minister declined extra doses offered back things still control. seem understand ideal time roll vaccinations age groups 60 health care workers. said race trying get vaccine eligible. Delta suddenly every adult allowed vaccinated. crazy ride. I... could actually see someone using irl. Come on, Kentucky! Make Colonel Sanders proud get vaccinated. chicken.

Those us vaccinated people watching tragedy come rely excellent bourbon order get sleep night. It’s quite high mighty assume Sammy Jesus caan get FDA vaccine new York? fair I’d probably quit teaching also, different reason, probably easier sell plasma deliver pizza, similar money. countries pregnant women offered vaccine? Everything I've heard pregnant women particularly urged get vaccine.

How life matter selectively people incredible me. timelines either delta specific vaccines results 3rd booster shots?

BUT, technically, mask order issued department health part emergency powers times crisis. law passed state legislature; therefore many (if most) police departments state flatly refused enforce mask order, official law according proper government procedure.

Less 0.001% fully vaccinated people died covid 88% breakthrough infection deaths occurred people aged 65, 70% hospitalized age non-fatal people disproportionally end hospital, get care need, 70% survive (for vaccinated).  
 
It looks like, average, 0-29 age group shorter average length stay hospitals Looking (and likely abusing) data, average stay 25 y/o (very roughly) 5 days, 65 y/o 9 days, could practically treat two 25 y/o every 65 y/o.  
  
One might argue hackneyed saying 25 y/o whole life ahead them, whereas 90 y/o lived full life. Push come shove, knows doctor might decide triage situation. summarize, really want triage. Triage bad. go back queue order early pay more, that's is. 

Countries took gamble strategy, NZ like others region decided wait see real-world results, pay less, choosy vaccine got, hope zero covid would allow luxury taking time it.  

There's upside downside everything. New Zealanders able live much unrestricted life quite lot places. hand, delta get hardly anyone's vaccinated, shit hit fan fast. There's two planes, carrying 100 people x amount Covid 19. flights distance duration, one fully vaccinated, not. observe unvaccinated flight produced 20 Covid infections, vaccinated flight produced 1, vaccine could said 95% effective.

Though order apply 95% effective means day day risk assessment, can't merely think ""I'm 20 times less susceptible covid given situation"", number study. everyday people, thing number means vaccine right single biggest preventive measure currently take keep loved ones safer. still pay attention local situation, keep new data order make best risk assessment make. wish cut dry, is. don’t think it’s necessary wear mask you’ve vaccinated  make petty point said anti-vaxxers

You obviously idea doctors nurses dealing with, mention people cannot get needed medical care mass stupidity. reality anything *but* petty. They're filling Korea, catastrophically. Yet.

The immunization triage idea freaks little, yet receive first shot. scheduled, like many others, vaccine available places. know they're talking US, decision makers everywhere wacky times. Like local leaders encouraging people vaccinated non-existant vaccines. 

How would prove availability place shipments vaccines repeatedly delayed? devastating desperately want vaccine doses go waste US kne wants take them. Even reach 85% vaccine, masks, ventilation social distancing still beneficial. Comirnaty sounds like something Medea would call neighborhood.  covid triage?

“The hoarding Covid jabs rich countries also rolling booster shots “makes mockery vaccine equity” pledges, Africa director World Health Organization said

Matshidiso Moeti African health officials, including Africa Centers Disease Control Prevention, warned booster shots recent weeks less 2% population continent 1.3bn people fully vaccinated.

Moeti noted latest resurgence cases across Africa levelling vaccine doses finally arriving continent, “Africa encountering headwinds” rich countries like US UK decide roll booster shots.

She pointed rich countries average administered 103 vaccine doses per 100 people, Africa six, AP reports.

Earlier week director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called “unconscionable” countries offering booster shots “while many people remain unprotected.”

Sorry don’t know post link Guardian straight here. Reasons personal health include could still get it, get seriously ill even die, long term symptoms, yes. Also, want hospitals full end car accident something.

You could also consider empathy altruism ""for you"" - personally want people around die, even stupid misinformed. Obviously, there's much help them, need figure course action depending epidemic locally. 

For personally, wearing mask go crowded indoor spaces small sacrifice. skip activities, stuff want outdoors pretty easy me. bit hard compare countries different stages pandemic. Looking graphs, Israel appear approaching peak 4th wave, many European countries starting see beginning it.

Also Europe many younger people recently got second shot meaning peak immunity. 6 months, Europe similar position Israel, waning immunity combined restrictions. It’s like cases found day 1. Always take weeks weed point NZ point drop covid zero policy they'll ""2 weeks lockdown"" still 2030 rest world moved on.

Additionally, ""2 weeks lockdown"" might longer enough Delta, especially get many simultaneous leaks. Victoria Australia showing right - locked right away soon found new cases, yet 3 weeks they're losing control (also) keep importing cases NSW. Acting like reason cautious pander antivaxx idiots insane. cautious cautious. Especially since involves childrens’ health. Would rather due diligence shoot hip say “fuck it, dose’ll probably work”? I’m sure many reasons things consider comes children, probably wouldn’t even comprehend. just? according pharmacies I've called. tell conditions, say immunocompromised, can't get single day 8 months dose.  Absolutely exceptions. Dad call Doctor today, expect roughly answer.  kids sent home school quarantine exposed sick classmate. kids strep tested negative Covid day 6, post-exposure. Thursday. Saturday, (vaccinated) husband started feeling sick. Today, tested positive. carefully quarantining since kids got home, explanations kids’ negative tests incorrect - infected pediatrician’s office. stymied one! Yup, I’m sticking rules here. I’m Auckland CBD. lockdown seems working daily numbers still pretty low. replaced 1.5 hours commute time walking dog. dog I’m office day. Never going back. Unfortunately screws approximately 30% hospitalized people vaccinated.

I’m recovering well thankfully difficulty breathing except phlegm upper respiratory tract occasionally cough lungs like I’m clearing throat. long think infection last, days?

Wear masks people. can, wear KN95 something better surgical masks got infected work. However, exposed long duration time throughout day. isn’t say surgical masks aren’t effective, higher quality protection, better IMO. we've never vaccine forced upon us whole fucking country 19M less 30% vaccinated. mention we're also donating / selling unused vaccines?

crikey indeed first time mRNA technology used large scale; however, technology developed 20 years many experimental programs cancer treatment vaccines infectious disease run.

The applies vector vaccines, even though claim new technology, never used large scale. fact first vector vaccine Ebola approved 2020 month approval Covid vector vaccine.

On balance, feel lot saver mRNA vaccines mRNA volatile side-effect appear shortly vaccination. Fair? broadest sense, yes. hospitals triage according set rules. vaccinated..often obvious someone brought ambulance wanders in. would treat vaccinated patients? safe effective? dont know situation Italy LOT (like really MUCH) people revolt restaurants, pubs, bars etc asking ""green pass"" (this name vaccination proof Europe)... Yea symbolic messaging. symbolism, messaging. that's enough you, reduce chance getting breakthrough infection, risk seems increase.  I'm much symbolism. Funny opening schools want parents able go back office, offices’ openings post poned whereas school pushes onwards. shows care community. Yeah I'm starting think we'll actually lockdown Ontario devastating people. cases unvaccinated actually bad thing since they'll still fill hospitals icu beds dream people wearing white asked labor day sighed relief. cannot wear white labor day Hello fellow Arkansan! Sorry, trying asshole anything, genuinely interested why? use Moderna, AZ JJ? What's reason? assume Pfizer best want anything else? vaccinations provide high level protection (at least delta variant). Moderna focused pretty much exclusively US market late last year. NZ made deals Pfizer, J&amp;J, AZ Novavax 2020. waited data see best. initial data showed Pfizer far superior AZ J&amp;J. made decision go 100% Pfizer, couple months blood clot issue AZ popped up. still potential supplies others use back-ups people can't Pfizer boosters. Stil, friend tried rent office space 10 case someone wants it. 30 company work home.

The companies tried rent stil wants sign multi year deals etc. 

They ended buying house one set business. Nope, let unvaccinated deal choices own. I’m amazed didn’t infect wife son Covid. around way got symptoms tested positive. even same
 house sick. Except times accident unpredictable illness like cancer. everything right still buried debt survive. 

I've counseling sixteen year old girl dying family can't afford health care condition. someone love, fine let people suffer die can't make enough money?

To this, provinces cities must prepare accommodation patients equip oxygen supply, medicines, medical equipment personnel, wrote. extended social distancing periods must immediately establish mobile health stations ensure quick treatment COVID-19 patients. 
 
Medical personnel gathered, trained distributed localities high number new severe patients. Human resources equipment public agencies private enterprises mobilised facilitate COVID-19 treatment. Patient classification transfer must done quick exact manner treated, especially severe patients. 
 
Massive, rapid testing utmost importance identify, isolate, classify treat COVID-19 patients. Social distancing deciding factor limiting spread virus must strictly implemented prevent community infections. 
 
The Government continue promote vaccine diplomacy get COVID-19 vaccines people earliest opportunity, call transfer vaccine production technology vaccines made Việt Nam, dispatch reads.

However, depending situation, authorities also attend socio-economic developments important works, also must based solid COVID-19 prevention foundation. — VNS I've separated European partner year half. see hear raise glass something strong general direction. “I wish need happened time,"" said Frodo.
""So I,"" said Gandalf, ""and live see times. decide. decide time given us.” lol, actually seen said schools vaccine mandate students quarantine states counted absent, means count attendance funding. mean get wear masks, distance

No lmfao calculate way, vaccinated incredibly protective well, since vast majority unvaccinated people gotten hospitalized COVID either.

Which show numbers misleading. ""Jab"" British term. ""Shot"" sounds weird ""jab"" sounds us. wait 5 year old children get vaxxed go nuts. It’s specifically interacting children, it’s even 1 link separation. updated models many people immune state? Youyang's seemed like accurate...but judging recent surges must underestimated. I've seen couple models estimate fifty percent infection fifty percent vaccinations places like Florida/Texas...which even think overlap/breakthroughs...those surges must slow somepoint? aren't.

after 18 months...are semi accurate population immunity models?  last one Florida turn lights?  ate?   think mean indoors, it’s long period, without adequate ventilation, distance masks less effective concentration virus air builds up. Distance doesn’t matter happens, even N95 masks aren’t 100%. well fitted mask might 99.x% efficacy… well you’re room high concentration infectious viral particles hours… love?    Hey can't get words this, saves taxpayers money people vaccinated vs strain medical system things. ""The Stand"" documentary. think learn live corona forever. 

In band, learned play Stars stripes forever. Propagation vs selective pressure.

This event could seen harbinger. Virtually every outdoor event beforehand negligible, immeasurable case counts. there's outdoor event measurable case count significantly higher before. Something different, percentage cases state delta variant. public health perspective, mandating masks - cheap effective precaution - right better waiting next 5 outdoor events larger case counts stress hospitals even further. masks prove ineffective, we'll know soon, we'll start canceling events.  medicine, wide variety physical signs used diagnosing.

That bit longer explanation since expressed interest :) let know unclear brought up! source that? I’m curious cause haven’t seen anything  think missed point. Influenza leading cause death pretty big threat lot people. sends thousands hospital we're advised take vaccine every year nasty. world think deadlier virus spreads easier wont bad worse? critical patients whoever? It’s great sign aren’t testing enough people. Jedi council would approve vaccine Pretty sure people heard  Go Dawgs, spread it! *cough! cough! cough! cough!*

🙄 Lot West Texas towns names people: i.e. Sanderson, Burkburnett, Harrold, etc. railroad stops popped pretty quick come names rapidly, they'd name local figures. Yep, California alright, even considering ridiculous population is.

The areas struggling rural areas low vaccination rates. 

I’m SF life going relatively normally. high vaccination rates mask mandate, things going well. Cases still going up, given infectious Delta is, hospitals aren’t overwhelmed.

I keep point people areas entire country isn’t overwhelmed covid. Areas strong mandates currently still keeping damage check.

I’ve able make sorts normal appointments doctors, many also starting live life little normally too.

A high vaccination rate makes biggest difference extreme infection, masks help stop spreading first place. wonder many national guard get deployed working hospital. 

""Frank, thought leaving NG."" 
""It's Sgt frank now.""  Oregon resident here. I’m wearing mask outdoors. state truly thinks making vaccinated people mask outdoors slow surge, completely delusional.  Yes, getting confirmation bias  paid 65 dollars 3 cans Lysol Ebay! least big cans lol. whatever algorithm throws next. Like, researching shit YouTube. Mindless scrolling, guarantee it. talking global, talking US US article. reduces chance variants. Wow! Thank ! interesting. I'm curious area well. Going look info provided capture data appreciate level detail provided here. 

Is huge learning curve get stuff captured recorded like describe?  Ugh, right. really need realize vaccines effective enough strict. Vaccines won’t stop pandemic, they’ll control it. critics issue hospital beds, unvaccinated people taking up. know data I’m ignoring? fact vaccines prevent hospitalizations. don’t want bring vaccinated fiancé hospital get turned away dies unvaccinated ignorant asshats taken beds something completely avoidable.

Vaccines won’t prevent pandemic, they’ll slow spread prevent hospitals overwhelming. That’s war. Something that’s fun hit “save” comments pandemic over/this horrible thing won’t happen/the numbers never get bad/etc, come back later petty fuck it.

It’s activity *proud* of, think it’s good let people see dangerously stupid shouldn’t trust stupid things think trying make decisions. reason possibly downvoted outdoor mask requirement. recommendation part might referring private gatherings. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown announced new outdoor mask requirements go effect statewide Friday, Aug. 27. Masks required public outdoor settings, regardless vaccination status. 
The new rule require masks people outdoor settings people different households cannot maintain physical distance, large outdoor events. One friends worked nurse cruise ship said level shit saw stupidity would blow mind. e.g.. guy turned family find became critically unwell 12 day trip. nurse found needed dialysis every 3 days keep alive. family declare thought dialysis included board ship. airlifted survived.

I thrown headline read whole thing. Approval great all, October date matters parents want kids protected. pretty pretty big problem. Also big . looking like 30% hard it.    exact experience college. day shut college one class day favorite professor. always say front row seat every lecture day exam next day studying hard decided sit back class study. professor knew studying since sat back. I’ll never forget tell “see two weeks” left lecture said “good luck exam tomorrow” asked exam preparing for. One biggest things missed formally saying goodbye him. still makes sad thinking it.  job tell American people mitigate virus.

Such wearing masks He's doctor long time.

Yeah, got lot people killed early days HIV well.

I’m going stop reading there, can’t imagine gets better Public health laws exist. Use them. lived. Didnt CDC instruct testing facilities count positive test vaxxed, hospitalized fatal, Otherwise counted? 

Defining vaccine breakthrough infection
For purpose surveillance, vaccine breakthrough infection defined detection SARS-CoV-2 RNA antigen respiratory specimen collected person ≥14 days completed recommended doses U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized COVID-19 vaccine.

Identifying investigating hospitalized fatal vaccine breakthrough cases

CDC monitors reported hospitalized fatal vaccine breakthrough cases clustering patient demographics, geographic location, time since vaccination, vaccine type, SARS-CoV-2 lineage. Reported data include hospitalized fatal breakthrough cases due cause, including causes related MSM reported this, nice data numbers, turning blind eye key demographic numbers really dont mean much.    I've heard people catching vaccinated thought catch it. Nobody CHOOSE get immunity risky infection naive immune system, infection lead large degree immunity, comparable gained vaccination.  Total idiocy. there's way numbers sniff still even now. 🌷 **that'll final form.** 🌷 Yeah probably never. Certain circumstances I’ll always wear it. limit amount time I’m willing stay one room can. Sounds nuts, it’s difficult. That’s thing projections. They’re made assuming certain criteria external factors. factors aren’t met, projections going change. Fauci wasn’t wrong projecting better results long people got vaccinated, stayed safe… people didn’t hold end deal. Frankly entire system work.

You can't competitive capitalism hospital legally obligated treat show near dead doorstep price services argued later, hospital third party services complete.

The ideal solution would vertical integration, hospital insurance company entity, thus becomes internal matter hospital, clearly problems, namely tied one hospital, course leads big guberment medicine. Think that's wishful thinking. Tbh. Hope right though. friends go great time anyone know Florida's deaths seem included worldometer daily updates anymore (even though cases are)? That's true. We've virulent delta strain break every mainland state Australia mostly locked 2 weeks burnt out, without even going full New Zealand lockdown.

Unfortunately largest conservative state's leader spent year mocking states acknowledging virus real short term pains worked long term gains, let get completely control weeks ago reinfected whole country (most already eliminated delta again), state already hit hardest eliminated delta got infected hard stuff like removalists infected state driving it, struggling get control 6th time. That's like saying we'd homeless people decided share housing.

100% true - yet, unlikely. cousin lives there, two shots. told weekend got felt pretty ill days still sense smell taste. problem US messaging inconsistent politically driven. going become endemic driven variants concern. rate unvaccinated leads something worse delta emerging. what? They've already lost control, one go lockdown, one wants masks anymore. Inconsistent messages politics removed possibility containment public health standards. Yup. two herniated disks pressing spinal cord 3 months ago. debilitating pain mostly lost feeling/function right arm. Ended getting discs removed fused metal plate screwed onto vertebrae two weeks later. Apparently considered elective surgery, even though could ended paralyzed. Thankfully got done delta started causing havok. Two weeks flatten curve ""learn live it,"" means ""learn die economy."" right, must missed that. Good Alabama Auburn Oh question. like lot things Texas, many things hurt brain. Stay safe! Ceot people vaxxed vaxxed they're poor, largely poc. That's never Healthcare. discrimination. IMO, middle school sucks way high school. High School drama real, also exaggerated bit popular culture, makes great entertainment (you adults play high school kids get away titillating stuff).

But middle school? That's real nightmare. Take bunch kids ranging elementary school starting puberty, throw together big building, see works out. could possibly go wrong? unlikely event hospital one remaining bed, individuals need enter ICU time - vaccinated 70 year old receive care. higher risk mortality took preventative measures. receive service first.  hard data, anecdotal evidence medical threads vaccinated individuals dying rate unvaxxed. apply individuals comorbidities though. Dems absolutely want top issue 2022 election cycle. eventually recover, hospital bills harsh. Vs taking free (for now) vaccine Texan, wish could say wrong can't 🤷‍♂️ They're convictions, they're government's convictions. obviously vote someone Could something small fraction cases deaths?

Possibly, know else people differently. EG; need get CO2 measuring devices enclosed spaces, people know ventilate more. libertarianminded government anything that.

We're sort interesting control group here, cause basically everything wrong, except vaccinating, fairly well society. 29 January 2020, Finland confirmed first case covid. 32 year old woman straight Wuhan sought medical attention Ivalo (a location north Finland, popular tourists) tested positive SARS-CoV-2. cooperative quarantined Lapland Central Hospital Rovaniemi. Back then, sure covid would impact Finland except one odd case. old excuse white people using ages justify skippin line front black brown folk. everyone totally isolated might right. even small household could bounce around several weeks - never mind failures isolate, persistent cases, lack knowledge supplies led infections within hospitals. Man, that's kinda sad. respect it, makes sad read it. wife vaccinated live well vaccinated area. made 3 full days kid tested positive. fucking joke people. Fuck no! Treat whoever sickest first. national thing. capacity vs need thing. hospitals beyond capacity start making uncomfortable decisions gets limited resources, things like likely survive taken account. like US (or individual matter) suddenly decided stop treating conditions. I’m going make bold prediction… Really going go limb here…

This pandemic control spring 2022. Tell delta comes around neighborhood, see much cares. done that, would muzzled spot. eventually was, anyway -- disinvited briefings HQ rage fake treatment. 

Dr. Fauci *opposite* politician. statements straightforward evolve facts ground change, lack usual spin filter skilled politicians employ couch bad news bad developments. People want BSed, Dr. Fauci roll way.

Anyway, Fauci CDC that's ""moving goalposts"". virus. ""It also nothing triage patient"" - you

The simple answer is... mandate vaccines end this. know ideal, know legit issues it, million strawman arguments. However, people want end, likely way.

Patently untrue. Makes make large difference whether vaccinated unvaccinated. Whatever safety got vaccine, mask multiplies nobody wears masks Netherlands. It'd probably help us little bit, also kind annoying summer.

In general looks like standard two shot regiment 6-12 months effective anti-bodies. body relies long term memory cells means still get infected (but body able build antibodies quicker).

In order us get ""good control"" pandemic 2022, means larger percentage population already vaccinated today need total three shots. seems like order achieve.   2 weeks flatten curve  Contract tracing completely pointless disease levels high currently are. “at least 400,000 deaths 2020. retail N95s got medical professionals lies? simply available point anyway demand China wildfires (in Australia West Coast). tracked carefully. delayed allowing use industrial N95s (90% market) anyway aka ones stores (I wait donate).

Hahahah got second paragraph hamster brain tripped fell running wheel. read like book already starting make argument head even read whole response. Oops. 

Anyways since good points let’s talk first time someone choses drugs then, it’s still choice unaffected addiction. Obviously can’t become addicted something you’ve never done, it’s choice risk addiction. can’t long term health effects caused drug don’t use drug. can’t forced brain working sell possessions body feed addiction never give addiction chance take root first place. warnings risks everywhere. Schools. Doctors. Commercials. Looking outside window seeing homeless addict stumble street. least me, choosing use drug knowingly putting risk issues more. 

So back vaccine. Everyday someone choses remain unvaccinated chose put risk (at least we’ll agree anything else haha). Everyday someone choses continue using drugs same. Every time person uses addictive drugs chose take risk losing control addiction. still fail see line would drawn refusing medical attention unvaccinated using harmful substances. CFR appears low due delay deaths.

It’s still 1% Delta FL, see readily looking last weeks deaths vs cases 20 days prior (20 days time takes case resolve prior waves). excuse don’t need it. Lots people like know immune system enough deal one covid immune It’s age group thing. It’s certain group gets “news” entertainment sources.

Without knowing grandfather’s medical history, there’s way us say died. someone terminal heart failure, end stage COPD, multiple organ failure, getting vaccine doesn’t mean it’s impossible die now. vaccinated died covid several co-morbidities. lot seasons, too. watched way TV. Life happens, miss bunch years, behind many. approval changes nothing regarding lack long-term safety data. FDA granted approval despite clinical trials set finish 2023!

This directly FDA approval (emphasis FDA conducted rigorous evaluation post-authorization safety surveillance data pertaining myocarditis pericarditis following administration Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine determined data demonstrate increased risks, particularly within seven days following second dose. observed risk higher among males 40 years age compared females older males. observed risk highest males 12 17 years age.

Hope things look up, us die. Dead people can't go anyone Indeed. There’s four letter word ends “unt” call mom’s sisters isn’t “aunt”. Sorry losses. get frustrated. can't know either way strongly suspect people rejected vaccine would still rejected it. 

""They follow normal approval process, I'm taking it"". argument. Yes! annoying see people overly dramatic calling ""the jab"". shot like dozens shots people get throughout lives.

I literally told math somereason I'm called liar lol. substitutions going stock covid virus alpha variant. result immune evasion strand. substitution guarantee something ends less affected vaccine antibodies, factors play.

The issue Delta spreads far rapidly body people end higher viral load. specific mutation allowed Delta replicate much faster thus shorter incubation time.

Anyone help advice? it’s not. fact doctors picking people vaccinated ones haven’t treat medically. get used this. you’re dumb ass won’t protect help you? mean side effects? said symptoms, confused covid. It’s generally believed 2 weeks period time side effects show not. Teachers wife's school quitting left right vaccine mandate. school probably better  No. current vaccines contain live virus cannot increase viral load. vaxxed unlucky enough die Covid, two likely reasons. first strong immune response vaccine. uncommon elderly weaker immune systems begin (and elderly given priority right boosters places outside US). second comorbidities make susceptible severe disease, things obesity, diabetes, heart lung disease, etc. Almost every single vaxxed patient died fallen one two categories…many fall both.

I sorry loss. Please talk doctor concerns vaccines, vaccines general work immune system. tested literally hundreds millions people. found safe, effective severe disease death. Sometimes maniacs energy best suited putting foot life-threatening issues people use feelings flimsy defense. sad come points actively prevented everyone.

So unless global vaccine mandate sufficient supply willingness enforce mandatory vaccinations populations want vaccinated, rate transmission mutation rate always result new variants possibility defeating vaccine.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  getting 30% number? can't seem find anywhere. Unless read actual stats. Kaiser Permanente insurance, sync Apple Health iOS, shows vaccine status there. live Oregon. lot hospitals also cancelling postponing elective surgeries. may sound like big deal, elective surgery cosmetic surgery. defined surgery immediately required save life. happen like guy Houston shot 6 times needed surgery repair shoulder, getting time soon. subjects lol hope kid doesn’t die get sentiment, never make healthcare political cog, least never make part political machine. 

Refusing service medical care based view/stance/politics/religion always fought against. 

This hurts too, absolutely hate least thoughtful empathetic medical system patients need system... make sure also get care. 

Grin bear it, hope fuck learn getting care need easy envy prize, forget; us took vaccine might unknowingly dodged early deaths, prevented death loved on.

Can't put price that. Nope. data modern oral vaccine. Page 149 http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/254399/WER9112_145-168.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Bruh.. they’re going understand terms. Also pointed it’s ‘Murica, don’t learn others think evidence immunity infection actually higher vaccine. friend idiot kids get weird diseases time. non covid times random 102 fever kid usually means “Here go again. Let’s go doctor real quick confirm whether need antibiotics”. UFT's estimation (speaking 80% figure). DOE started requiring members week half ago verify vaccination status (in response prior policy vaccination weekly testing) they've started gather info vaccinated outside NYC. Distancing works great short term contact, long term exposure amount distance need untenable. Masking works well infected one wearing mask, access medical grade masks, getting high levels mask compliance goes long way, especially overcrowded schools are. better point. alas wishful thinking end. Shit rough. :(   Plus never wore mask. 

""...Everyone photo tested positive COVID. None vaccinated.""

Zero sympathy. Definitely another excuse week Hep B vaccine 3 shots six months, confers immunity lays 20+ years. WTF yammering about??? Kick Kelowna, ship the, back Calgary please. UBC students stay they’re vaccinated.  I’m debating right now. got covid-19 vaccinated. Twas delta. Boyfriend me. haven’t left apartment past 2 months. 100% sure got though test negative exact symptoms me. tested 2 days felt better thus think negative.

He wasn’t vaccinated. Still isn’t. Wants get pregnant. I’m telling tonight 3 months get vaccinated he’s out.

There’s proof immunity COVID recently would stay hell, even got any. work veterans hospitals don’t need dumbass give final decision whether something, fucking curiosity

Jesus Christ imagine actually stupid read still snarky replying to. Looks like Pfizer/BioNtech starting clinic trials month, results expected fourth quarter (Bloomberg article: Pfizer partner test COVID vaccine targeting Delta variant month). 

If three shots shown provide decent protection, may end weird spot there's quite enough reason justify whole new less-tested vaccine (even still highly tested safe) replace current one. Especially new variant might replace get Delta-vaccine.  didn’t know wasn’t National. feel like option New York several months essentially Premier Gladys Beryjyklian treating New South Wales like Governor DeSantis treating state Florida

Understood, fam. I’m sure we’ll see lot early onset dementia neurological disorders future. *que even mass shootings US* Deathcult good luck! people, media bubble, like Fox Facebook, world.

And that's part trouble. yet MH Kerala states least undercounting factor

UP Bihar highest btw… go bhakt they're ugly inside though low grade fever Moderna 13 weeks pregnant. nurses concerned actually happy getting temperature meant immune system responding. said, time reproductive endocrinologist highly stressed waiting second trimester get shot so. Maybe fever one concerns first trimester. noticed evening health insurance offering $50 upload copy vaccination card. hadn’t seen advertised surprise. Trying determine it’s $50 per household per person... used healthcare stuff (copays, example) I’ll take it. 

I think us got right away missing “prizes,” wouldn’t change thing getting mine eligible. 

Whatever takes.  However, could go back time and, magical scenario, also convince Modi take seriously take precautions, might avoided Delta virtue India getting completely wrecked COVID. point polio vaccine actually cause paralysis yet whole world took it. Covid vaccines cause severe symptom whatsoever, including paralysis. point measurable danger two diseases vaccines prevent different. Covid vaccine far safer high chance false negative rapid tests, no, don’t think cold would trigger false positive. took clear photo vaccination card phone. Easy enough.  little…  Good. Grease flour?  Oh no. vaccinated prior infection, best immunity all! Hopefully antibodies kick soon feel better. KN95, immunity, would thought person situation would reasonably safe. proves schools open. variant contagious.
Take care better quite soon! took online courses college went well, however designed online. Trying hybrid online/in person recipe disaster. could, arguably have, retool teaching methods online, summer cases free fall. weeks new COVID hospitalizations. Delta changed everything we're back shit, brief moment over. mom live quarantine. quarantine too? I'm vaccinated. That's say they've waiting for, they'll find new plot land goalposts clog medical resources treat results 'main character syndrome'. $100 bucks Wisconsin today. There's incentive ridding folks believing bad, politically charged information though.  Please, Sean, stay this. can't take another decade smug asshattery matter 0.0% anti vaxx crowd unfortunately 🥴 many crockpot MD PhD holders. It’s incredibly frustrating. ends severe covid consider screwed Winter coming... really jus outdoor portion. article says ""linked"" could anything bars restaurants nearby, trains people took, surrounding hotels. someone else mentioned, also 50,000 people attendance. 4,700 ideal crazy either. likely unvaccinated. learn? Probably never...  FDA corrupt full child rapists /s It’s hard admit, adults need do. Doubling mistakes isn’t acceptable.

Empathy isn’t going change either. That’s part us stuck mess- largely we’re extending empathy lack ability understand empathy themselves. best(worst) part debilitating conditions weigh heavy medical system, they'll *need use* government disability assistance despite hating welfare basic income, wandering around long-covid mind fog. Yaaay!  heard fact another news source tonight said ""3 10 unvaccinated Likely get vaccine FDA approved""

This much weak statement says ""More Likely"". ya news may always best. like read study itself, news headline.  Knowing source matters! Lmao  international travel good while. many hotspots. Could've even ""lover's quarrel"". :| grease pan?  Wait people military find don’t get choose vaccinations!  Oh wait.  already don’t.   many shots get deployed Iraq? Lots... Look GOP got you. People stupid. Dump her. could someone knowing they're literally killing kids grandparents?  Jokes aside, anything happen him? I’m confident directly related… AMC place anyway, would call coincidence.. mean test positive automatically 10 days. Thats Vaccines came idk now. need third shot. Need something Pfizer history books. Lots leaving. 
I want shambabazoola named one Moderna, gives good indicator. immunocompromised, dont mind asking? Everything said holds true, young time, generation real hope better world future (and right there). Man would want 30 years younger staring what’s front right now. changed? Someone mentioned Reagan crack, hope one party decided destroying country planet power better (mad respect GBI, recession 90 response correcting damage Reagan did, coming debt hose cut right thing letting work through, economics work, whatever nonsense pulled 2007. sacrificed second term best country (after increasing taxes substantially wealthy). Wonder we’ll ever see again?  They’re getting flak either way. Antivaccers who’ve saying vaccine rushed screaming FDA took long, must safe. They’re never going happy.

It would better allow emergency authorization kids soon possible, there’s reason cater lowest common denominator. Actually chance getting struck lightning 1/15300, exactly CDC estimate. Talk coincidence.

But aside, chance getting struck lightning entire life comparably chance developing side effect two weeks.  can't wear piece cloth fucking germ holes minutes protect child they're straight pieces shit. two ways it. disagree whether masks effective end day low effort thing makes massive asshole. What's worst could happen, wore piece cloth face minutes nothing? Oh wow ruin life! We’ve got great group science minded parents working tails sending emails calling everyone can, sending data requesting information schools. aren’t going give up, certainly feels like uphill battle week left school starts. Stories like give us encouragement!! would agreed, internet full people talking getting first dose today. people really waiting FDA approval. Probably see covid infrared vision. Dude probably blinded visual covid crowd  Lemons something whatever. share similar beliefs. honestly could date people believe lot different things me. can't handle information set includes facebook posts. enough hours day bullshit. 

So yes. 100% pass dating screen. Lol. go, they're ask invasive questions medical history afternoon brother-in-law walked Memorial Hermann Cypress get care heart problem. daughter EMT Montgomery County told sister drive meet halfway. met we're riding together became non-responsive car give chest compressions bring back life.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Something like 85% nurses pro vax. daughter age, gleeful get vaccinated. number one fear pandemic would lose someone loves. poor kid going grow without mom sister, mom thought knew better everyone else. even back getting vaccinated. talking CNAs, nurses. Near office used Much less. less likely yes still lots vaxxed hospitals...I'm vaxxed still go like pre-vax mask everywhere....still totally anxious time virus eager keep getting booster booster. FDA approval literally zero reassurance safety efficacy. think options like Sanotize's Enovid far UV lighting utilized rather vax, clearly working. Epidemiologists predicted disease would amenable vax yet Trump Biden insist trying get back normal vax way go. colossal murderous fuck up. got moderna booster felt bad 2 days couple days. Pretty much like 2nd shot  read article, curious staffing situation whole.  cons metaphors show up. use makes general message clearer layman, consequences misleading notions considered enough. contact state department public health able direct get official vax records located always clear many peipke infectious given drastic variance severity depending risk factor, mention vaxxed people likely infectious long. possible rule thumb could multiply 7 day daily averages 10 20, depending conservative want regarding undercounting untested cases, divide relevant population.

But many cases per 100k, many people covid decide go grocery shopping.  mean nowhere? company work ~~at~~ shut offices everyone WFH indefinitely. prioritize liver transplants non-alcoholics? think anyone saying get treatment available, prioritize due insufficient resources, negligence count something. Dude fine. supply perfectly stable, everyone wants one going get one probably get one Good point, cause end, ends. always choose death skills later Plague Inc EvEn FDA ApProVed!!

People alot willing try something start breathing problems. Active cases fraction percent given day. chances good one hundred. bullshit response. aware saying people wear masks correctly right. aware person's body different right. Con-fuckeng-gratulations, handle it, others can't well. want applause?

No every person wears mask wrong breathing issues it, are. point is, talked bit more. mask suck, talk better designs masks like Project Hazel  No, least put OG card. things really tracked level think would be. example, plenty people moved second shot there's way state moved records state used live   ‘More mandates’ sexiest thing I’ve heard year.  Gov Texas asymptomatic. really relevant hospitalization stats Kids minimal risk long term effects, thank right field day saying stupid shit every day, matter what, decisions made toeing around delusional thinking I’m teacher two toddlers home. They’ve exposure daycare I’m terrified I’m going bring home them. instead bought conspiracy theory misinformation bullshit vaccine effects fertility. 50-person class. really work well. worries, likely family (and town) right behind compliment also thoughtful measured response. stop treating anti-vaxxers put tent minimal care, medical care back. Nurses doctors losing sympathy too. can't jobs safely well numbers, nobody wants work hotspots. soul crushing. close coming this. study China last month (on /r/covid19 i've never able find again) claiming average genetic bottleneck 1-3 virions.

There's reason believe there's ""minimum infectious dose"". probabilities always make bigger dose likely infect you. Unfortunately breakthrough case…but I’m still amazed (and grateful) didn’t infect vaccinated spouse. Da Bears  They're recommendations, hard fast rules. breaking law means. supply US fine, taking third shot away someone's first. able get third shot physician knew third shot  There's long list extensively researched approved drugs FDA later recalled drugs causing worst side effects imaginable. Extensive testing mean shit. US medical insurance system repugnant get mRNA booster 3+ months. Finally someone else noticed it. thought secretly tin hat person, almost gas lighted becoming anti vax. know someone else sees funny rhyme I'm convinced weird name say Fuck yeah! glad got badass SpikeVax come-here-naughty. Pfizer first get EUA data pool Israel makes easier case prove safety. Moderna won’t far behind. J&amp;J fewest arms take longest get approval. It’s locations allows us reassign staff Memorial Hermann locations help critically needed. also eliminates need transfer patients main hospital admission, necessary. Even without vaccine, properly wearing well-fitted high filtration mask offer excellent protection. would worry. Can't believe get people get vaccine. Wow.  local school board meeting, guy said speaking six families “down south” vacation.

Holy shit people…vacation elsewhere, you?! It’s locations allows us reassign staff Memorial Hermann locations help critically needed. also eliminates need transfer patients main hospital admission, necessary. Yes, likely. might attest immunocompromised, US plenty supply, taking away anyone. got third shot couple days ago Bazillions, duh. US, absolutely yes. say vaccine yet insurance, golden. parents best friend back late July zero issues.  deciding help someone. allocating limited resources best overall outcome. Triage based feelings. I'm saying lot RNs doctors fed unvaxxed prolonging pandemic endangering children, that's unvaxxed lower priority hospitals start using mass casualty triage. There's really nothing traditional J&amp;J vaccine mRNA ones. J&amp;J method actually almost new mRNA vaccines. first time approved use 2020 Ad26.ZEBOV Ebola vaccine. Instead ""traditional"" inactivated virus vaccine, viral vector vaccine uses unrelated virus deliver spike-protein DNA cells, cells convert mRNA, used cells make spike protein trigger immune response.

I'm saying dangerous improperly tested, still new technique.  good long covid vaccinated individuals breakthrough cases. Sure! Definitely problem Im gonna waste time worrying about. Haha. 

But can’t sell it, they’re less likely let employees work remote. Yes makes monetary sense leave empty, sunk cost fallacy seductive…especially middle managers already looking reason force people back office. guess…They might

Does one read articles all? It’s short one it’s right locations allows us reassign staff Memorial Hermann locations help critically needed. also eliminates need transfer patients main hospital admission, necessary. Covid affects may permanent too. Simply put, yes. That's great breakdown. personally really thought sounds like composite covid illuminati hahahahaha. I'm already vaxxed still seems like easy like crazies make. Ugh. putting wife future child risk decision, demonstrated article you’re commenting on.

Vaccination pregnant new. See, e.g., TDAP. mRNA vaccines, particular, live viruses change DNA. 

Yes, listeria (a big reason recommended food restrictions) concern fetuses. deadly virus. It’s odd follow doctors’ guidance soft cheese protections global pandemic. 

I pregnant pandemic. understand adds extra layer stress, you’re going find much empathy decision vax thread fetus dying COVID. *Only immunocompromised unable mount proper defense.

Even boosters, still far less frequent oral medication people take without checking labels. Maybe we're going wrong. Anti vaxxers often go ""oh risk"", rather ignore perhaps take seriously.

Who judge another human believe 1/1,000,000 risk high. Rather feel sorry poor souls every day undertaking activities carry far greater risk even know.

As society believe moral obligation protect people activities, they're unknowingly exposing much risk. Driving, instance, can't people driving around exposing 10x level risk they've identified much. starting point revoking licences help avoid activities identified much risk.

For less dangerous activities like walking footpath must insist take adequate measures protect manditory helmets, shin elbow pads. goes without saying must always wearing mask, safety googles around others. must help people live risk free lives demand. rest population considers kinds risks negligible we'll also need sort identification others know extra careful around them. Perhaps bright yellow vest ""Please careful, need remain risk free big black letters written multiple languages society identify people easily ensure they're exposed unnecessary risks.

This start, also need protect dangers alcohol, unhealthy foods, dangerous activities like going swim beach God forbid smoke vape. work together ensure poor souls live monotonous miserable bubblea extreme safety deserve. us, protecting us them, puts offside. Instead need take additional measures protect respecting choice live life free risk. Indeed, worst name ever. awesome approved, yay?  honest, really exist either. contraindication previous anaphylaxis vaccination, since two types means given one receive. getting downvoted totally right, work district precautions undone 30 minutes lunch 400 kids cafeteria bc nowhere else eat Moral gymnastics. Ha! know. thought read it. BMI bad, BMI best measure. waist 36. last time sick threw 2014. bad immune system. started corporate job March already burned corporate culture. guess I've watching Joshua Fluke much. ""it rushed""

""if safe, test rigorously?""

""the FDA corrupt""  baby idiot. stuck idiot rights make idiot decisions regarding child’s health also, 18 years. rude trust lol Thanks reminding work more.

All say next time see ""injection site pain"" symptom, I'll take seriously. (My original viewpoint ""It's needle going arm. expect?"" Little know would last while…)  True. add context. Cause sometimes say antivaxxer someone say well can't get vaxxed real yada yada. even bigger reason everyone get vaccinated. still think everyone needs watch Contagion. get multiple notifications that’s cause auto mod took original post. edited version think get past auto mod.

I trying defend antivaxers here, personally don’t blame them. effectively brainwashed bubble. news see, information see social media, information get friends family creates sense government saying one thing everything else saying another. 

That doesn’t mean don’t blame, it’s also blame tons various issues society, typical bubbles surround in. religiously track cycle. got second dose period February. continued normal every cycle since time. haven’t noticed changes. social network Teams, office. cant speak CONUS Naval Stations across globe defiantly mandated vaccinations contractors. Still deadly making kids sick though  Evil yes, dumb, much. teleconferences employees office. know... hell going dates? can’t get within six feet anybody. many wealthy people around? amount people medically exempt getting vaccinated small really worth mentioning. Pizza delivery also dangerous job. cab drivers. company pretty anti remote work prior covid, I've trying years, Covid I've office like twice since April 2020. also got notice come clear desk I've moved permanent work home, even covid. much nicer working home. [this recent delta outbreak Guangdong province, includes data breaththrough infections people predominantly innoculated inactivated vaccines. Sample size rather small limited outbreak. guess they'll probably bigger pooled study data gathered current outbreak point. guesses how/where sustained exposure COVID enjoy sore muscles, complain workout. know, there's evidence China besides feels.  ""I'm retired lawyer, I'm telling - TOTALLY legal take shit roof someone's car."" wonder many still think know lot go motions actually treating patients, even really know theory behind it. false sense knowledge leads taking speculation seriously without solid medical background correct wild guesses. Err, definitely made decision spend money procuring vaccines beginning confidence handled absolutely factor. Giving countries first main reason, outcome decision.

I'm coping fine though thanks, could asked directly. going protest medicine entire job based around medicine. lol cite doctors say ""vaccines witchcraft, covid flu, mRNA rewrites dna shed dangerous protein spikes infect people"". Well, shit, mean enjoy getting poked. I've met dumb wealthy people. would shame waste opportunity!  GUYS HEAR VACCINE DANGEROUS Looks like 2021 covid deaths line duty causes combined. promise shot 100x better actually getting thing prevents.  hope so! would say take whatever get. important get vaccination numbers wait around specific vaccine. Random question child care help?  getting annual flu shot since 1996, never missed year. yes, would absolutely boosters, even annual vaccines. i'm sorry, thats awful high demand. Update LinkedIn search remote companies. things are.  That's good, I'd prefer everyone get vaxxed well.  think I'm motivated get shots general? care mumps flu, sucks regardless. decided search ""Base Rate Fallacy"" duckduckgo, ""suggest"" autocomplete, 4th result article base rate fallacy results Covid vaccine... Interesting.. tend speculate way. he's healthy, probably really big concern. Wasteful unnecessary, doubt suffers medical consequences.  Good man, awesome. Facebook? Fuck that, report hospital works at. went back work great. really decide stop treating unvaccinated patients find new career. Ohh

No, treat people, probably would prefer they’re vaxxed  both? We've spent billion public money manufacturing. done lot year ago make sure capacity now. Even best time plant tree past, still now. total economic impact virus trillions continue grow long new variants popping fail control current variants. 

People partial vaccination (1 2 doses depending vaccine timescale) also breeding ground variants evade vaccination.   don’t see big deal. treating covid medical condition now. Oh diagnosed bacterial infection? bet not. can't nice things. Cause covid enough. Let's build super bacteria. know mom going give kid full course. know tell. hospitals weeded shitty employees don’t actually care public health. It’s win-win. *two-time jab + boosters loose effectiveness/for varients hapoens vaccinated staff quits? saw bunch comments doctors treat unvaccinated thought that's walkout about. ""It fast, despite following rules ""they're biased, say ""Figurehead like supported it, therefore scam""


The goalposts already running side field. Absolutely ridiculous. working healthcare. Sorry asking (I know really happening USA but, yeah, also real), ...

What willing vaccinated specific brands (e.g. avoiding Sinovac / Astrazeneca willing get mRNA ones) ? Numbers mean nothing USA capitalist health insurance system. So... billions? Yeah. Less advanced countries actually handle covid better advanced countries. Perhaps part reason population actually understands society easily go shit people don’t follow rules times. Thanks! able put mind another year good enough reason motivated second. sound like douchebag tbh. “Overweight I’ve always healthy” uhhhh sure one He’s guilty, doubt. putting words mouth? I’m defending piece shit. 

He committed crime charged, call terrorism would mean went clinic goal running people giving vaccines stop people getting vaccinated. 

All I’m saying don’t know it. article states got argument incident. 

Do know argued about? Probably not. 

If intentions [like yea it’s terrorism. 

Why fuck jumping conclusions hard concept people days? Want fill us why? available binder excuses must getting pretty thin. So, think anti-vax crowd ""I'll take FDA approved"" bluff called? Maybe area sucks general population science doesn’t exist it’s impossible catch speeding without going hunch still patients K-12 teachers central Florida still get vaccinated. can't wrap head around it. difference ""authorized"" ""Emergency use authorized"" time. 

Now time ran course. understand argument isn’t first post “I hope get fired”?  Israel’s ability vaccinate quickly absolutely insane Jesus man, sorry going that. primary outcomes (effectiveness safety) finished months ago. secondary outcomes, duration protection 2 years, still ongoing. can't know it'll last 2 years 2 years Good luck, hope feel better soon!  That's opinion Bloomberg article writer, opinion Chinese authorities. Two paragraphs up, Still, China proven ability keep pathogen bay, vowed continue safeguard people, regardless effort expense. Health minister Xiaowei told state news agency Xinhua August 16 authorities planned even stricter measures intended spot incursions virus abroad quickly. health minister also reiterated Covid containment priority provides strong guarantee economic development sound investment environment. vowed resolutely contain outbreak spreading strengthen hard-earned achievement China Covid control efforts.

The Chinese saying prioritizing safeguarding people's health, believe that's path China's long term economic development. 

In comparison, Bloomberg business people represent worried port temporarily closing cause supply delays affects quarterly numbers certain companies might impact stock prices next month. That's care about. stock prices stay high Wall Street, cares dock factory workers getting sick China? Yea something wasn’t sure about. I’m fully vaccinated vaccine 95% effectiveness virus mean time encounter virus would caught 5% chance catch it….. mean people get vaccine 5% still catch covid? I’m currently breakthrough infection curious unlucky 5% person situation around lot people keeps rolling 95% chance time eventually it’s going come 5%?  I'm immigrant seen family 2019. probably see 2023. I'm fine that, immigrant friends, come huge range countries. parents tell regularly they're glad I'm NZ even means can't visit person. 

So open? vaccinated age groups, including children 12. least 85% preferably 90% coverage over-12s 95% highest risk groups. guaranteed supply booster vaccines. 

And even need keep MIQ high risk countries multiple border tests low medium risk countries. I'd expect medium risk still require self-isolation arrival (meaning isoltated alone fellow travellers, family friends) passing day 3 PCR test. 👉🤚 case closed  flu.  (/S) I'm sure worst: medical science guide that, moral judgements. certainly plays big role, like age, severity disease, pre-existing conditions. still rather otherwise healthy 45 year old high risk death without treatment unvaccinated prioritized fully vaccinated 110 year old stage 4 cancer, severe heart disease, diabetes.   There's precedent. waiting liver alcoholic, must show abstain alcohol period. Help willing help themselves. ...they dead. gone CovidBgone Protexx ... know, marketing It’s control thing. think find employers start implementing finer grained hourly reporting tools required fill constantly make sure we’re walking dog sleeping sofa. Fire incompetent asses then, make apologize patients, also plants trees wasting oxygen work hard produce. Nothing article make think anti vaxxer. likely likely someone get vaccine.  Yet FDA approved natural people sceptical.  ""Go ahead, downvote me.""

""WJHGahyyyy downvoting Sounds like dispute got hand according article. odd watching USA outside. Aussie here, know anyone died covid. even know anyone that's it. Iirc single death state year. 

Vaccination supported sides here. antivaxers nothing like sort issue guys having. need hire help all. expect cook child care, you? Well apparently pissing cornflakes strawman argument. Please re-read entirety posts again.  Yeah, government put there. I'm saying China good right (why said good ill), there's reason compare Florida way.  everyone knows they’ve lottery. never turns well. immunocompromised last place want go care unvaccinated. Could get linked source 13,000 deaths caused vaccine? Dog keep trying flex I’m jealous poor scavenger, keep energy come clubbing boston sometime might identify Well argument getting vaccinated deliberately killing child. kind amount abortion. Tourism 6% economy, turned need it. record low unemployment 6th best GDP growth OECD pandemic despite losing it. 

NZ wealthy country, cost nothing it. govt made agreements multiple vaccine makers 2020, became clear Pfizer best changed strategy March 2021 bought enough Pfizer everyone committed single provider. 

But result big order back queue Pfizer could deliver big shipments late July. public rollout began August. Currently age 40 plus get one, opens 30-plus tomorrow 12-plus 1 September. people even know virus works, going school rest us? hubris. know made numbers, ironically shows inability evaluate risk.

A 1% chance vaccine complications 1 100 people, quite high.

A 1% chance dying covid also high, didn’t include chance getting covid first place. Plus young healthy significantly reduces risk death.

So scenario, personal risk level, might indeed better avoid vaccine.

That said, numbers accurate, fully vaccinated.   Willfully unvaccinated either go back line get black tag sent home based resource availability. That’s stance months.

I’ve well. FDA approval giving hope future Cringe away. cry healthcare workers need risk health people can't use hospital care becasue selfish assholes, go ahead cringe. unvaxed go fuck right off. fell Edgar Cayce astrology, get it.  two, northeast TN. fucked. husband 32 years get it, would living elsewhere. NZ rely tourism. myth (happily supported lot tourism operators) that's laid bare COVID. Turns out, normal year foreign tourists contribute around $11b directly economy, flipside Kiwis travel overseas spend around $11b countries. closed borders two cancel economy one least affected COVID globally. sectors (like construction) bumper year driven Kiwis nowhere go renovating kitchens bathrooms. 


My hope one major learnings stop investing tourism low wage sector degrades environment, invest money productive sustainable areas. Wait they'd prioritizing vaccine unvaccinated? 

My understanding child would included unvaccinated group would not?

 tell child good luck one bed 60 year old existing health conditions vaccinated we're going give even though they're going make it. dude 5G hotspot. start taking higher doses drug run risk severe side effects. probably fine, risk went significantly this. thinking less Darwin would pay  Thanks. Corrected. Also scary time 12.  “embiggened” echoing head, thank it’s entertaining looking worse Afghanistan point Mostly okay, bit nervous restrictions college may have. outside world pretty much completely open (save mask mandates vaccine mandates there) college isn't, gonna feel like prison. know he’s selfish. needs get tested, two ways it. Protect everyone would later come contact with. somewhere could stay won’t get tested wait out? she’s long gone buddy!!! Get vaccinated :) Considering risk severe covid long covid already known high, literal billions doses vaccine already administered data available, would receiving experimental treatments hospital anyway keep alive, risk assessment ability atrocious.  even trust movie theaters days. reasons virus Anti-vax not, don’t ghost people. shit hurts   Praise Cheeses    anti maskers arrogant self centered well. Man come stuff?! Dude. Read damn room. except masks optional outdoors outdoor hallways. Kids take passing periods everyone crowding halls. Good.
I want always option work anywhere.
No 5x location discrimination. Well what’s point vaccinated?

I’m fully vaccinated I’m done pandemic point, though continue wear mask. I’d gone Zinameran . (I love sail) Yeah, shit. Reasonable, somewhat intelligent people want date selfish morons. vaccine prevents severe disease death, many vaccinated showing oxygen ICU, prognosis grim they're probably going make anyways vaccine clearly work them. 20 people one vaccinated would likely 60+, immune compromised possess illness exasperated covid. 

In unvaccinated group there's likely someone would better prognosis, would hate deny healthy 35 year old treatment unvaccinated even though better outlook vaccinated counterpart. use resources know they're going make difference since they're limited. Here's question.. us get vaccines, need third booster shot? would late get one? Delta taking  Vic’s excuse now? know sure vaccine? Correlation always equal causation. Either way, consider asking doctor tired. actually app called ""Donald Daters"" (seriously) major security issues [was hacked within hours (back 2018). Part may also wildfires unvaccinated people moving Germany also going 6 months boosters, eases mind. don’t think ever intelligent first place got sucked load BS  almost every business leases space unvaccinated patient would take ICU bed ventilator 4x long vaccinated patient? words, could save 4 vaccinated patients time resources needed save one unvaccinated? Glad I’m one flustered that. There’s convincing antivaxxers don’t understand theater forcing expanded trials vaccines longer term data experts agree historical data childhood vaccines amount data date indicates 2 mo follow period safely conducted. 

I tried getting kids trials full near me. exit point here. Look graphs, everything going vertical right now: infections, hospitalizations deaths. Numbers lie.

Who trying impress rationalizing intention part problem? Google EUA educate yourself. Despite 25 IQ, seem least read. That's ridiculous lol. Protest like, follow law too.

What there's riots murder happens protest. ok? Op trying downplay report, like see masks useless. purpose. likelihood it’s fine, don’t like putting random drugs/treatments kids without specific evidence won’t harm (especially long term). 

It’s vaccine approval 16 12s big deal. Sure protests take many different forms. there's good reasons 1000s people close proximity, choose another form protest. idiot simply brain-dead. FUCK anti vaxxers, wonder people INvoluntarily unvaccinated :(  wait, putting bodies lol Well, vaccine slow spread ways. yes main reason stop serious disease/death. r/cornavirus people seem think they're immunologist something follow think vaccines supposed do. course, there's factors likelihood survive, age. Thus, unvaccinated 25 y/o might better chance surviving 90 y/o vaccinated. even though 90 y/o might done everything right might've survived care, triage situation might get deprioritized.  
Point being--triage sucks forces doctors make hard ethical decisions. No. terrible idea. don’t get sick. Plus end long Covid even vaccinated. Alright completely fine without normal social interaction outside family. Congrats 1% fine that. stop forcing rest thank you. Maybe isolated pov lost sight majority world's population wants live lives. many young people's best years school ruined virtual example?

The exit point already here, part getting vaccine. you. fine seeing anyone person enjoying meal actual plate served fresh, fine. want kids see friends daily create memories, decision. know normal view life measuring 'average' person thinks. Forcing upon others think fine egoistic.  friend, healthy vaccinated 20 something year old. Tested positive covid, mild symptoms (congestion, low fever, taste/smell) 

Guess doctor prescribed her? Antibiotics. 

Maybe doctor knows something don’t. mean that’s probably case. still can’t fathom you’d that. hear people say it’s prophylactic don’t get secondary pneumonia infection. strikes extremely unnecessary someone like her. least finished didn’t stop early. 

Also somewhat doubt prophylaxis argument HCQ new miracle treatment, zpacks -which got- also investigated treating covid specifically. find news articles scientific papers discussing that. Surprise surprise, doesn’t improve outcome unless you’re hospitalized secondary bacterial pneumonia. necessarily question doctor, undoubtedly knows do. I’d least asked he’s giving need take them, rather blindly it. Immunity infection 100% wane time well, new variants never really ""get with"". live life. think need hazard guess I’d rather know someone not. Yup, false negatives quite common (relatively speaking), false positives extremely rare. 

Kinda opposite people used to, guess. realise countries, Australia New Zealand, countries South America, etc even able offer citizens 18+ even 1 vaccine? know fact NZ ordered paid beginning NZ small pacific islands get vaccines. available vaccine stock appalling. Given AU always US’s beck call every war enters in, would expect US help AU vaccines. 
The inequity appalls me. need whole world decent shot getting vaccinated everyone safe dumb virus quit mutating. 
Sorry, bit outspoken here. It’s definitely rant. feel better - even hard lockdown NZ. Delta kicked making merry unvaccinated people. Desperately everyone trying get shot (except anti’s!) they’re given surprisingly commonly people covid. 

Antibiotic overprescription, fun! so? Even everyone vaxxed, covid ain't going nowhere. keeping manageable. 

Probably true mutations began. Now, objectively true. ""living life normally"", i.e., without bothering protect family masking making effort, pretty much equivalent taking shit driveway. Sorry, no, worse stink, kill. Exactly thinking. CDC publications frequently victim Science News Cycle, they'd publish something explicitly designated preliminary based incomplete data... way speculative estimates get reported Science Settled, Facts Need Know... highlighting whatever gets clicks shares.

That sensationalist reporting unfortunately becomes basis ""fact checking"" subsequent updates data models begin conflict ""facts"" corrections get suppressed misinformation. Tinder hinge options vax status would ex boyfriend me. girlfriend vaccinated, not. knows opinion accepts that, NEVER argue it. never really talk about, sometimes joke like ""they gonna arrest put camp"" ""we living black mirror episode now"". problem holiday, causes lot issues vaccinated, work way around it, gonna go road trip lot camping nature. :) comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

It sounds like people saying COVID stat, true 30% cops vaccinated, doesn’t surprise me. It’s evident political &amp; social leaning cops tend be. I’ll stop there. sadly probably true. SpikeVax sounded legit people hesitations Moderna Pfizer..  Answer:

Those people refer “willfully unvaccinated.” I’m talking people can’t get vaccinated actual medical reasons age. 

At point we’re basically MCI/combat triage. don’t time resources fool around people need stop coddling them.

So think answered easily.  FDA (F—k Dat Ass) approves vax 🤣 US EUAs additional vaccines need full approval going forward. prevent countries approving Novavax sooner.   ontario published vacc vs unvacced cases/hospital icu would u like look? current cases Melbourne people break rules.

Most cases syndeynis spent weeks shops open people allowed work offices.  Difference getting sick COVID gives decent amount immunity reinfection. good vaccination, decent. Replacing liver give new liver protection alcoholic. Instead adds complicating factors transplant. Depends estimated assumes UK US right wrong. Lots countires lots cases de tha may autopsy dead person check covid died not.

There also countries report death covid death unless covod direct cause. example, person heart condition gets covid dies: countires would report death due heart condition, covid there, would report covid death covid there. 

If two countires slightly different reporting standards estimated countires number would used standard. 

The world confirmed 4.44m deaths covid estimated actual covid deaths 2-4 times depending made estimated data used. something something help people help etc perfectly reasonable. consideration many medical procedures, vaccinated higher chance survival. stupid place teaches facts choose ignore Turkish Delight! fun finding new jobs. poor decision maker bad medical professional.

People still get covid they're vaccinated, risks lower. 


I curious though - would person vaccinated contracts Covid become even immune dealing it? Would act kind like booster shot? think details strain faster regular one. become contagious within 24h getting delta contact trasers fast. save antibody starter next loaf. it’s 30 year old unvaccinated person underlying medical conditions vaccinated 70 year old multiple co-morbidities? Triage won’t always simple unvaccinated vs vaccinated. Yes, course.

The risks known. Japan done jack shit control pandemic, besides nearly universal use *surgical* masks. really something needs look closely. never done proper lockdown. current one standards. quite behind vaccinations. Even home office prevalent. 

Sure, certain societal behavior probably helpful, still.... Covid-19 averaging 100 day across UK, according official data, scientists warned case rates jump millions pupils return schools next seven-day average deaths within 28 days positive test stands 100, figures released Public Health England Monday show, number last exceeded 18 vaccination programme means deaths far peaks last winter – highest daily total 1,248, reported 23 January – notable rise late May early June, consistently single figures.

It's heavily qualified statement.

Mind colleges aren’t even trying fight it. ones cities mask mandates (before banning them) said “it doesn’t apply us won’t enforce it”. (Side Note, supposedly professors quit one. Lol). 

The grade schools god knows what. believe education boards *are* allowed set mask mandates within county public schools (it’s bit unclear), far know one two done so, they’ve met surprisingly vehement counter protests. It’s constant headline state/local news. “Schools shouldn’t decide medical procedures child needs!!”. Fuck. masking too, vaccines. brainlets actually audacity present wearing mask “medical procedure”. interviewed high schoolers said “we don’t wanna yearbook full mask pictures” one kid said something like “My brain can’t get enough oxygen masks get worse grades” (or something effect).

Then again, threats enforcement might insight craziness actual hard enforcement without diplomacy pandering everyone's wants needs...

 know, I'm simple citizen limited information background processes involved making giant political decisions. ask questions bc I'm genuinely curious anyone better game plan what's currently play. city 74% 12-16 vaccinated opened two weeks ago. Pretty good far. Finland.

Almost age groups 80-98% except 25-29 reason. Second dose majority well mostly done month.  clickbait. He’s talking full approval. EUA come much sooner article states. next line full FDA approval likely several months away, Pfizer's vaccine could cleared emergency use earlier, possibly October, submission trial data.

the ""end year"" full approval. EUA could come much sooner, 16 older.  2 short years flatten curve, swear. Darkest Timeline great article today. Long story short, science works.

[The U.S. Getting Crash Course Scientific That’s crap exemption request. God gave us healing powers via one effective vaccines ever made. Get fucking vaccine. new variant evolves developing nation low vaccination rate vaccine resistant   Holy crap 103-104 F fever??? sounds unbearable. without antipyretics. boss! I'm wimp comes flu like symptoms definitely taking Tylenol motrin around clock starting around 12 hours post shot cuz want taking time work either. def get right recommendation take antipyretics shot, I'm allowance antipyretics post shot myalgias fevers suck ass. also know ever fevers last time beyond feeling subjectively hot Tylenol wore 6-8 hours later since kept medicating (within recommended daily dosage frequency ofc)

And yes reassuring shitty side effects positive sign antibody production work successful 👍🏽

Did get Pfizer Moderna curiosity? glad CVS carried Moderna could personally stay vaccine family. pop clinics sponsored state health department around carry Pfizer moment. 

Anyway congrats getting boosted!   One kids, sure. hospitals full, vaccines, school starting back up, lot absolutely unspeakable things happen whole lot children country. already saw footage four year old girl wearing chest-vibrating harness keep shit building lungs much choking air. 

The CDC absolutely knows what’s already happening much worse it’s get, they’re thing job apparently control diseases, sort run PR campaigns keep people thinking negatively diseases. goal keep economy going keep Biden’s numbers up, disease control even proposed. Conservative stupid mutually exclusive. Versailles, Kentucky, pronounced “ver-sales.”   gotta put year “May” now. lot scared. It’s easier believe story want believe acknowledge mortality. 

Stubborn scared. Dress code polices women's bodies: a-okay

Mask mandate reduces spread contagious disease: dare importantly - Florida, Arkansas, Mississippi, Georgia…. 

Worse countries within border   Well first one disagree entirely, premise all. anti vaccers likely think COVID conspiracy something along lines, saving world mind control, whatever (not saying logic obviously - doubt it’s wanting people get infected and/or dying). Also, even were, don’t think hand kind justice hospital.

The second one good point however. that’s reasoning behind prioritizing vaccinated people, get coming from.  hate kids huh? really mind blowing 2021 rapidly approaching conclusion. feel like 2020 inched along, especially added turmoil protests happened US last summer everything leading past election, feels like 2021 flown by. really hate living kinds historical events, real bummer covid finally rear view mirror, everything else relating climate change going next crisis live through. Shit kinda sucks tbh Yeah there’s basically nobody “can’t get it” tiny minuscule amount people allergic something it, even amount people would allergic something 3 even minuscule.

It’s possible someone’s doctor may recommend individual basis, personally I’d skeptical that’s case, skeptical doctor were. Oh oh got one. There's small suburb Cincinnati called Delhi, pronounced Dell-high   anyone Googling wondering is, think typo ZIP code. Google Maps shows 116**97**. Actually, reason wanted get trials fast possible short period doses helped that. There's plenty time research optimal period since then. Perhaps making people things ought doing? That's I'm hoping full FDA approval Pfizer allow, legal precedent established. changed Delta variant. Viral loads significantly higher vaccinated unvaccinated persons, meaning amount gets dumped air crowded locations positive higher, heightens chance significant viral load carried air infecting others.

We've already seen happen. Oregon's Pendleton Whisky Music Fest led outbreak despite previous outdoor festivals since lockdown ended failing lead outbreaks - thanks delta variant. 3-5 days recommended amount time wait exposure test. friend wait another day two possible. test negative then, there’s real reason get tested. testing today would almost pointless. Russia, Ohio? pronounce Russia head? guarantee think Roo-She that's fucking pronounce it. Yeah, learning pod really same. starting come shell year preschool pod two kids, one cousin already knew well. feel like missed lot academic especially social stuff. We've trying supplement outdoor play dates tutoring, really nice class. I'm pretty much board, leaning pretty heavily person even mask mandate tbh, wife wreck worry. mask mandate really helps anxiety lot though, we're person side now. Yes does, wasn’t pandemic wouldn’t need covid vaccine first place. seriously, hazmat suit? think people go get like loaf bread grocery store? get mask easily though, I’m sure problem too, clearly don’t care anyone else’s lives exemptions actually ok call study all. scientist charge this. akin sending 6 water samples lab, finding giardia 6 trying say city's water supply tainted. adults act like kids job tell American people mitigate virus. He's doctor long time.

He's perfect obviously wrong. pandemic never-before seen virus. tried get people listen sides Aisle. One loudly protests type effort save lives costs anything short-term, however, convincing people purpose.

The virus give shit Republican Democrat. kills without discrimination. trying save Democrats Republicans, broken record point. man made mistakes end we're human. like playbook virus knew immediately would work wouldn't. Every country experimented solutions control spread including China quarantining possibly killing infected stop spread. safe never seen publicised like anywhere. look like made justification all, kept silent. mean would they? exactly make look good, demonstrates intentionally lied. Making something like make sense.

It always pretty damn obvious masks work least little bit prevent infection. Doctors using hundred years. literally reason call efficacy masks question reduce demand. +75 day last week read phrase ""and monkeys might fly butt"" came mind. would even mention serious side effects? censor those?

Use brain. Yup. days went level 1 2 great! pretty much normal apart scares Auckland... week ago  lot overlap Disney vacationers anti-vaxx Karens. Anybody played plague inc. knew fucked... getting downvoted? gave good laugh need start pushing vaccine released every age group

We need data first. studies underway. way accelerate them. also need acknowledge COVID-19 particularly dangerous illness children.  it’s months Ever heard gas gangrene ?  Maybe call doctor ask booster.

I third today doctor recommended it. sign form vaccine clinic stating taking immune suppressing medication (an injectable biologic), nurse call boss look CDC list approved meds third booster shots. Dumb.

National guardsmen come within borders.

The doctors nurses activated extremely likely already working Georgia hospitals, covid hotspots country travel doc/travel nurses.

This pure political theater. cost...? Think commerce happened result borders closed year half. Businesses affected that. government subsidizing businesses, that's tax money could gone education/infrastructure/research/etc. There's cost associated saving lives scenario. forget that. Seniors, kids got sent home early spring break March 2020, husband got furloughed, got sent work home course like 2 days. time came pick (unbeknownst me) ambulance office started panicking overload thought something bad happened much happening/changing/crashing once. CDC's recommendation wait data made sense time. fact said data already available bit failure, that's fault Pfizer moderna able recruit people original studies test waning immunity boosters couple months advance boosters necessary general public. 

The problem seem boosters needed. solid data boosters effective Delta Delta+ (although data coming past week) also supply limitations. 

Unfortunately, CDCs messaging probably going come back bite like masks needed messaging.   I'm group, lagging state vaccinations (yes, drawing right conclusions) problem getting third last Tuesday. one setback large hospital, minor clerical nature first day available hard feelings. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just posting say problem exist everywhere even state where...even state plenty people ready willing help. Yeah same. parents got vaccinated, started seeing friends going events, etc. Ive one best summers ever actually.  They’re okay people martyrs, second they’re sick hospital it’s “i need prayers” “how happen?” infuriating. They're implicitly saying consider emergency kids they're going take damn long review it.

I know think *is* emergency states reporting, children 0.00%-0.22% COVID-19 deaths, 7 states reported zero child deaths*

*​In states reporting, 0.00%-0.03% child COVID-19 cases resulted July 29, total 358 children reportedly killed COVID-19 U.S.**

So, kids need shot? Yes. great health community health get it? Yes. EUA granted vaccine response *hundreds thousands* deaths. Almost [1000 kids died 2017. think CDCs perspective, 'emergency' held higher standard. I'm impressed well Mississippi able reduce (reported) case count one simple policy!  Wow. seriously pissed LSU fans right now... love it!

This be. freedom choice, consequences.

My take: get shots. Right. still enough resources handle overwhelmed pandemic, regardless whatever preventable measures put place. Whatever happened “two weeks flatten curve”? Maybe, maybe, it’s time stop listening guy. He’s either frequently wrong deliberately misleading. also segregated ""religious"" people refuse vaccinate. People also don’t wear *bicycle helmets* Netherlands. Forgive don’t follow lead safety equipment either. get point nobody complies anymore. people stop complying, mandates disappear. kids special needs absolutely suffered without person learning. one size fits every kid ... least lane split california... Certain stares can. 

And screw rest. ###[We're gonna get COVID Yep. Thankfully hospitals Chile ever overrun. Seeing people Ecuador dying streets heartbreaking. 

I remember following live counter cases deaths China, also showed friends kept shrugging asked fixated lol. Probably word ""ole"" Texas discussion, automatically read comment King Hill voices:

Boomhauer: ""Good ole Iraan...""

Dale Gribble: ""It's gas stop that..""

Bill Dauterive: ""I drive alot.""

Hank Hill: ""I actually surprised anyone vaccinated.""

All: Yep, yep, yep, yep. Yeah April.. little late, NYCs big surge peaked April 10 confirmed infections.

The time could maybe helped prevent massive unchecked spread late Feb/early March. Old joke...

Dr happens die?

We clean bed next patient. Lol Lockdown last weeks done, recall. Ah, days. (edit) Oh forgot, never lockdown. How'd work out? one denying there's spike cases. issue there's communication would warrant removing requirement. [x] number days without increase? certain number cases specific point [x] number days?

I think that's particularly hard. Give people goals targets they'll accepting. particularly frustrating vaccinated people we're given normalcy vaccines meant achieve even we're contributing majority spread.  Imagine scientific advice follows emerging facts political agendas. unfortunate, entirely preventable mess.  events

[I've seen movie before] people really still listening idiot?    Never said was. won’t play well supposed “independence virus” July 4th didn’t happen. downvoters: I’m obviously vaccinated take test fly EU another return America. There’s much safe, feel 100% safe harming anyone. 

Not everyone going sit home avoid risk years end. us travel work. ration organs never enough. you’re alcoholic generally won’t make transplant list liver. health bad. decision made ethically money status I’m okay it. covid preventable. 98% ICU beds taken people don’t give shit. Drunk drivers same. someone needs ICU put in. ration everything according what’s available. 6 week wait see surgeon, 5!days see doctor. Morally maybe it’s wrong. every day people taken life support hope recovery. Yes, I’m frustrated here. wave need like even people vaccinated. mean, think would aggressive send agents/officials/officers people's homes test see covid hiding it. actually communism. 

 think likely post commented meant ""at home test kits"" typed weirdly?? going far late lot kids country. Uhhh get point opinions SCIENCE generally SCIENCE conducted. one point earth revolving around sun considered dangerous “opinion”  he's posting videos purporting ""cure"" vaccine victims. appears adapted existing antibiotic toxicity schtick vaccines. Well good thing that's fucking intervention, said ""2 weeks slow spread"".

The intervention was: stay home, goddamnit. people that. intervention was: vaccinated, wear mask indoors consider staying home. people that. still it, point absolutely inconceivable reason, many people think score points make *illegal* mandate wearing masks slow intervention works innoculate every eligible person planet (some will), mention animal reservoirs may harbor virus within 14 days allow mutations 

That's works, that's works. Mutations happen happen. issue ""GET EVERYONE VACCINATED WITHIN 14 DAYS ONE ANOTHER PREVENT MUTATION"", ""get enough people vaccinated mutations possible people end sick covid can't spread widely"".  Geaux Tigers post history reveals lot shitty opinions. also quarantine two weeks. Oh wait... word vomit  refused get vaccinated, though. anti-mask Florida Woman sent six masks lab tested. 

Where masks come from? Unclear. 

What masks prior sending in? Unclear. 

You could wipe ass mask, send lab, get results and: 

MASKS FECAL MATTER THEM!!1!  explain willingness take horse dewormer treat covid? Would lot shorter everything actually shut rather half-assed shut America (the one nearly everyone could classified essential act like nothing going on). model predicts ~25% first 60 days ~40% 90 days school required masking.

This came from, page mind projections knows model making rounds far.

As parent share worries. health officials want reinstate measures mask mandates, fair also provide thresholds point removed. Continually changing what's acceptable without transparent decision-making process good compliance public trust. guess that’s hospitals overflowing people non Covid medical emergencies waiting hours ERs open bed. far know Norwegian one this. also require everyone get tested day board, makes much sense Carnival others require test within 3 days boarding. could done flew utterly worthless.  Arbonne national vice presidents currently conference too. great, large groups people think crap products make invincible! officials really need start clear transparent targets they’re going reintroduce mask requirements.

What clear current vertical spike cases? ""Big Bunk"" Moreno, California father two stepfather three, intubated ICU month. Known big heart helping anyone drop hat, told sister-in-law, Marisa Sanchez, wished would family members getting vaccinated hoping others same. “Seeing condition he’s in, that’s what’s making get vaccine,” Nicole Cordero, Moreno's girlfriend, told ABC 10.

It's shame takes seeing loved one suffer people right thing. guess that's takes 50% population. lecture day long dangers fire, believe burned it. Ah yes, second stage, military deployment. beginnings possible shutdowns. Hold butts! going authoritarian religion, least use force good. certainly take.  tell personally exactly people ""irked"" him. least people I've talked work ect.   single infectious disease expert projected though.  saw videos first thought joke. second thought gets US, prepared. expecting that?

2 years always estimate fastest turn around vaccine. beat that. 

But getgo clear going disrupt life years best.

Sadly US huge pockets people love gorge obvious propaganda never assume best case anything again. sadly though, new variants still mutate. unless US border closed Spring 2022 everyone coming country vaccinated tested...same goes migrants....either way mutate elsewhere vaccines available still end here. Effective EARLY treatment symptoms appear. already feeling like death warmed over, help you. mean bother arguing person.. types get people reacting them. Recommended doesn’t mean required. ignore them.  enough keep everyone safe, keep outbreaks. safely like Norwegian, 100% vaccinated zero exceptions exemptions, everyone tested day board 3 days prior flew like Carnival does, cruise again. 

This shortsighted going hurt long run. Let alone protect crew passengers. Half-ass measures enough. Worse kids starting school. KG supposed learn school about, kids missed lot development. blanket definition opinion, literally say climate change ""opinion"" mate.

She's expert explaining took FDA long. Remember pre-existing conditions could jack health insurance premiums get denied coverage entirely? different? would imagine taking vaccination status account determine treatment eligibility would discrimination unethical. ethical, would like see unvaccinated required take vaccine part hospital treatment. Also give vaccinated discount hospitalisation required. read heart dropped. love vagueness this. “Good control”, “more Americans”. gay something cannot help. No, repercussions that. They're higher risk getting HIV heterosexual couple engaging unprotected anal sex. 

Being fat though, say someone that's overweight, absolutely incur higher premiums. smokers, not? *lifestyle* choices result higher medical costs, pay more! (And specify CHOICES. Someone that's overweight thyroid condition instance pay more.)

Getting vaccine something choose costs nothing. refusing causing greater risk yourself, others well. absolutely consequences. I'm saying denied care, foot bill it. Getting people vaccinated easier stage, spring, vaccines likely approved (and mandated school attendance) people 2-12, already mandated multiple states adults working numerous sectors. school district this. can't change elections end semester, around January.

There's probably lot districts choose. problem that, parents bandwidth school kids top work. get wrong, possible albeit much suffering -- 2021 schoolyear virtual us burnt us fuck out. fulltime nanny youngest makes option possible us compared others added support. think needed something simple clothing companies make masks meet demand public push government mask up. conversation/request white house manufacturers. obviously nothing simple administration. Fun fact: town’s name pronounced Ira-Ann opposed Iran fly medical emergency mom. happy it. Still at-home quarantine masked around family get test. 

If voluntary travel, I'd avoid flying personal choice. research seems indicate get covid vacation airport, contracted vacation spot carried home. follow flight protocols keep isolated location, might fine? 

Unfortunately, there's definitive answer get. Sure, right comment fact, multiple lines evidence suggest expanded vaccination coverage could reduce rate immune escape, providing additional benefit dose sparing beyond immediate impact disease. beneficial effects hinge assumption vaccination provides protection variants SARS-CoV-2, or, words, vaccine effectiveness variants zero dose-sparing regimens.""

This article written dose sparing mind. makes even better, since full vaccination, virus even less routes escape. Basically, goes back numbers game quoted before. Yes everything hindsight painted broad brush. time, know infectious mainly droplets airborne. N95s/medical masks already getting hoarded. need strain masses buying masks. healthcare worker happy CDC kept telling people wear them/buy them. time, people told isolate home go unless needing essentials, makes masks useless public. mean, anything, treated last. Vaccine supposed protect difficult illness, least that's we've told. harder cases always first triage, right? That's goes, right? You’re creating false binary. Even case breakthrough infection, amount replication virus going lessened. reduce probability mutations. It’s also important note primed immune system adaptive. respond better mutations arise body. plenty discussion actual qualified people r/COVID19 Dunning Kruger quite something. Yes yea would triage scenario. Don’t waste resources likely live. taking away sportsball gets Texas come around, means cancel all. things Covid. literally agreed analogy without realizing production distribution challenging part writing good book, means, universe. 30 year old single parent? understandable. surface callous far truth.   Luckily child 12 fully vaxxed. recently stocked kn95 masks plan wear everywhere now, want protect selves point. it; everyone else figure out. Yes quote (the first one) shows vaccinated people get covid less unvaccinated, covid can't spread it. Hahaha ok buddy. Good luck there! change behavior based responses? Eating healthy diet exercising good things they’re guarantee won’t get severe covid infection. You’re vaccinated it’s less likely healthy diet exercise help keep immune system strong. could also get exposed large amount virus system difficult time fighting off. love repeating Biden's CDC director says suddenly makes anti vaxxer...

At point look vaccines working exceptionally well,"" Walensky told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""They continue work well Delta, regard severe illness death -- prevent it. can't anymore prevent transmission."" Yea totally.

Hell, PCR test addition vaccinated, problem all. discussing reality triaging care hospitals full. useful information levels - wait later share world? boosters global pandemic, point risk outweigh benefit you? even know incidence risky side effects boosters, already concluded much risk? I'm sure reasoning way conclusions Here's [the article, Yahoo I'm sorry, I'm going live I'm fully vaccinated (as friends family). live country almost 80% population least 1 dose. continue pretend I'm still 2020.  Flu's crushed covid protocols. expert, quoting article saw.   visit Texas then, mate, half dine restaurants round like that. lockdowns guess. 
 
Consider fortunate blessed enough live area worry things like that. Um, asking question… 

Look, point, seems simple questions difficult you. didn’t know simple thinking troubling - hope days gets better! triage. literally aren’t enough resources take care everyone. 

You scream healthcare human right much want, won’t make doctors appear able take care everyone. go CDC chief says.


I link ""Fox News"" anyone relation Trump. 


In black white CDC chief says vaccines working exceptionally well,"" Walensky told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""They continue work well Delta, regard severe illness death -- prevent it. can't anymore prevent transmission."" Maybe meant Easter 2022... sure right place ask who's benefiting promoting antivax? 

There's Jenny McCarthy types genuine believers trying make money it, they're evangelizing crazy. There's Tucker Carlsons know vaccines work able make money giving confirmation bias crazy. 

Would third type stands actively make money prolonging pandemic? Everyone currently free go sit eat Applebees.  punitive like proposals always are. Yeah, assholes get vaccine able to. However, far likely complications catch it. fact ""perinatal period conditions"" (babies dying due premature births, infections birth, hypoxia birth, etc) top 20 list really sad. occurred west Texas, I'm sure would legal route could taken I’m hoping, too. Spring 2022? Fucking people.  dumb one even stupid. 

So know happened you. Vaccinated people still less likely contract spread COVID unvaccinated. Blaming fully vaccinated people COVID surges completely irresponsible false. Hospitals full vaccinated patients. Yep! Florida tech employees train replacements get severance package. Disney moving entire engineering department California Orlando, likely thing again.  keep mind case think conspiracy, doubt competency vaccine. Russia history cutting corners afford property abroad. ACA made insurers can't drop medical conditions. 

And that's good thing. move freely country like entitled vaccinated doing, part long term suffer effects possible long lasting effects vaccine... things little unknown... florida releases week fridays download doesn’t even proper ssl certificate browser balks every time. go figure florida would fuck up. Hard disagree. anti vaxxers put everyone else position. selfishness last people get treatment.

Honestly issue hospitals designated percentage beds unvaccinated people, got. Keep rest open emergencies. hmm yeah coincidence like 5 companies able ""produce distribute"" mRNA vaccines time. Like trolling  Yes people less likely survive get triage. It’s common practice. think hasn’t already happened covid, you’re mistaken. Hospitals don’t advertise fact making decisions.

Now seems non-vaccinated people less likely recover. get bed person car accident? Happy March 542nd, 2020.  Ontario reported additional 91 hospitalizations today contact tracing, extent. kid Covid positive, child within 6 feet must quarantine parents asked keep classmates extracurricular activities two weeks. also mask mandates, although teachers don’t care let kids wear chins. I’ve already fighting oldest kid’s teacher couldn’t care less. thankful precautions realize many kids thrown wolves areas. blows mind. Ah OK. Well kinda also answered question got votes bonus ^^. 

The governments dont seem care, people also dont seem care, vaccinations slow, recently oxygen running Egypt, even worse, Syria supplying Lebanon oxygen. 

The lack care people due media coming things like drinking tea eating lentils protect people corona start pandemic. 

At time can't blame people dirt poor might hang imaginary solutions social security fall back. 

Sometimes think horrible tea stuff worked placebo real help might caused deaths thousands false information. 

Who needs Russian bots Arab media No. dumb take. pointless needling. people refuse get vaccine also downplay covid think cold flu, they're smaller category gotten around it.  People tend swallow pride ignore much hypocrite every breath feels like they're verge suffocation  Interestingly arguments UK would perceived racist due vaccine hesitancy greatest BAME communities.

Vaccines work, yes frustrating significant vaccine hesitancy. cannot dehumanise remove rights feel 'self inflicted'. equal right life. Oh covid deniers...I still can't believe people exist. family friend ventilator near beginning pandemic friend double vaxxed careful caught Delta variant. I'm Canada way better. many getting sick. haven't. You’d surprised. close 60% atm kids 12 make roughly 12-15% population. made mandatory schools would massive boost numbers right vaccine reduce spread it’s self needs combined. 
While agree partially said please see medical community says 
“While vaccinated people spread virus get breakthrough infection, odds getting sick first place far lower unvaccinated,” explained.

At meeting, Dr. Anthony Fauci, nation’s leading infectious disease expert, reminded reporters breakthrough infections “expected usually asymptomatic.”

So yes vaccinated people symptomatic spread virus like anyone else.    Sorry - indeed bad assumption part. “don’t trust government” nonsense pervasive US neglected consider consider might here…     15 cases go 0 Right, average person self centered, therefore general consensus fuck immunocompromised. see alone votes here, bunch self centered people want die. Ultimately, said stands hopefully id way implemented. vaccinated person immunocompromised person bed, vaccine effective anyway really putting willfully unvaccinated back line, capacity hospitals enough previous two categories. like said, people argue bunch nonsense people immunocompromised offer value recovery potential self centered bullshit armchair doctors. I'm okay standing front mob telling no. care. brain still tired misread last line ""some people made bad choices"" damn accurate too. Sounds like we'll less Mormons soon. Maybe joined smarter made belief system. know taking vaccine, paid Federal government, another way Bleed Beast? Reddit hell I'm sorry hear that. family like wife's side. guess hope lucky enough get it, do, asymptomatic, keep telling get it. wild it’s easy Americans go Europe.

There “vax negative test”. Vax needs mandatory, people aren’t getting need privileges taken away. 

And reciprocity. Vaccinated Europeans able come easy go there. reason worry Moderna FDA approved too? ""We need top issue 2022 election cycle"". fine, emphasis misleading part. that. realized CDC pressured Trump administration? Trump officials bragged it. Trump administration pulled funding programs monitored lab Wuhan.  Dr. Fauci almost got fired times last year publicly disagreeing megalomaniac. depends circumstances, cut dry situation. would save whoever going actually make it. think people learn mistakes? people told lies someone trusted believed it. anger leadership reaching people properly. enough disinformation. medical professional job save patient. judge, look past decisions decided person deserves treatment. job healthcare professional help patient matter are, color are, political views are. 

I've read articles many gotten sick turned views around. I've sadly read articles people got sick begged vaccine make it. I've read articles people getting sick last wish family vaccinated. proper information made choices had. leaders fucked big time beginning pandemic, we're still dealing repercussions now. 

Annoying hell yeah is. people self centered dicks. lot aren't, lot could swayed proper information hit loads disinformation everywhere turn. someone coming covid, going know get vaccinated, probably going much patient, purely deciding lives dies based bias without even understanding made choices made. wrong unethical. 

That person legitimately believed getting vaccine would harm them. person legitimately believed get sick. sad truth probably like Trump get say flu, health advisors consistent instead flip flopping masks safety protocols. looks bad them, undermine integrity. drag national averages down, except stuff like teen pregnancy, drop rates, drugs, incarceration.  disappointing game made worse loud obnoxious bills fans sitting rows front us. could super petty reported behavior let go. professor Harvard wrote op-ed like March April 2020 said believe 2025 would realistically put covid behind us actually still bit unclear. I’ve heard 2-5 come shortly crossed! 

Would Fair Treat Vaccinated Covid Patients First?

Last week, Texas health care policymakers discussed taking vaccination status account Covid triage. It’s larger conversation ethicists bracing for.

￼

PHOTOGRAPH: HOUSTON COFIELD/BLOOMBERG/GETTY IMAGES

IT’S ACCIDENT that people describe something that’s calculated, cold, unemotional “clinical.” Taking care people’s health isn’t emotion-free means, clinic physicians nurses make life-and-death decisions time pressure—including patients go first, kind care get. resources like, say, ventilators, intensive care beds, oxygen, staff, time scarce, decisionmaking called triage. last week, The Dallas Morning News reported that Texas hospitals considering massive change it. question play: Would make sense take account vaccination status Covid patients? ICUs filling severely ill Covid-19 patients shortage beds nurses, clinicians (all things equal) care vaccinated people before—or differently than—unvaccinated ones?
Now, hasn’t happened, probably won’t. idea came memo North Texas Mass Critical Care Guideline Task Force, regional organization physicians, nurses, stakeholders, developed the procedures for hospitals follow rough times like pandemic. team wrote memo rushed say weren’t pushing new policy, trying talk out. “People burned out, they’re exhausted, they’re angry. one questions that’s coming is: consider patient’s vaccine status we’re making triage decision?” says Robert Fine, physician co-chair team wrote memo vaccine status. “No decisions made,” Fine says. “We urged task force, ‘Please share triage ethics committees clinical care doctors continue discussion.’”
The memo Fine mentions “Come on, we’re thinking it” school talking points—which good thing! would’ve troubling change, say least. Emergency rooms legally required care everyone, matter sets decisions got there—it doesn’t matter you’re innocent cyclist seat-belt-eschewing drunk driver crashed them. admission, hospital’s care guidelines define treatment patients get. Texas doesn’t statewide guidelines critical care triage, means caregivers left local organizing. tough times like ones brought low vaccination rates Delta variant require reexamination priors. fourth wave Covid hospitalizations differs others, almost everyone severely ill also unvaccinated. In Texas, 12,800 people hospital Covid-19, 93 98 percent unvaccinated. It’s tempting blame wave virus people didn’t get shots. “This bubbling up—this anger, frustration, fear, worry. Every day, we’re seeing ascent curve. it’s steepest it’s ever been,” Fine says. “So leaders task force, decided, know, numbers looking good. questions coming up.”

Sure. get it, right? “I tremendous empathy doctors particularly nurses there. It’s terrible situation they’re in. They’re working hard can, great stress, patients families often lash they’re grateful,” says Bernard Lo, director emeritus Program Medical Ethics UC San Francisco author of Resolving Ethical Dilemmas: Guide Clinicians. “It’s really hard take care people thinking could done something simple: Get two shots would avoided this, overwhelming majority cases.”
The problem, Fine Lo readily acknowledge, that’s really triage supposed work. It’s complicated medical ethical issue, plainest version effort goes people likely survive. That’s always easy to determine advance, places hardest hit pandemic, triage always tricky, disease differentially affects poor people ethnic minorities. Triage guidelines keep clinicians unintentionally giving biases, make sure treatment equitable and ethical ways disease society not. Worse, if resources unlimited, don’t triage—so clinics less money have triage they’re also, dint locations populations served, also likely see people affected disease.

Around world, hospitals clinicians have broadly agreed that Covid non-Covid patients triage principles applied, care shouldn’t first-come, first-served (because differences accessibility), primary metric getting greatest number people leave hospital alive. Cultural values sometimes come play whether consider subtle prognosis: quality life, years lived, or, like, person somehow valuable, was even calculable. (And triage isn’t way divide vaccinated unvaccinated people; fact private insurers are pulling back paying Covid care seems like pretty good repudiation idea forgoing one’s shots.)

One thing ethicists clinicians come back avoiding “categorical exclusion criteria,” attributes knock someone triage running. example, widespread availability vaccines, elderly Covid patients died much higher rate younger ones. nobody wanted exclude old people treatment, right? That’d monstrous. Or, team Swiss ethicists argued last spring, might distinguish “first-order criteria,” like demographics, “second-order criteria,” subtle stuff that’d come play tiebreaker—two patients, alike every possible way, similar prognoses, similar diagnoses. deciding differences take account is very tricky. it’s health status, assess that? might socioeconomic status influence prognosis, account equitably? ethicists Texas task force floating is, essentially, whether vaccination status might second-order exclusion criterion—even though, clear, one task force’s main points vaccination status could not, itself, categorical exclusion criterion.

In part, that’s whole idea comes caveat size of, well, Texas. Yes, far fewer vaccinated people get severely ill. one knows severely ill vaccinated people better outcomes—more survivability—than severely ill unvaccinated people. seems likely you’re sick enough hospital, you’re sick enough hospital. far tell, published data exists. “I personally sense data I’ve seen, preliminary data. peer-reviewed study showing that,” Fine says. “So one careful.”
Careful indeed. big part rationale triage guidelines consistency, individual doctors don’t rely intuitions. “Covid taught us lots things, certainly there’s lot implicit bias within health care system, certainly Covid outcomes,” Lo says. “And want make worse.”
Plus, much might understand empathize rage frustration health care workers—emotionally drained, epidemiologically risk—whatever blame might place could well misdirected. “We know people frustrated angry, that’s basis decisionmaking,” Fine says.
Vaccination status, Fine notes, complicated anger might allow. “I think really careful saying someone chose vaccinated. people do,” Lo says. “But still people difficulty making appointment, aren’t internet-savvy, don’t speak English first language. lot people work jobs don’t time off, get even day adverse effects vaccine can’t work, pay gets docked.” would clinician trying triage based vaccination status distinguish among groups, even allowed to?
For matter, even people resist vaccination think they’ll never get sick, a horse deworming drug will save them, vaccines contain magnetizing 5G antennas Bill Gates turn werewolves (They don’t!

People disagree one?

You guys better solutions?   pets. idea. may higher NYC? Two people died early pandemic hitting hard here. could avoided infection death masking distancing think. Maybe areas south people dying? “We don’t know vaccine does!1!1!!!!1”

“The vaccine kill within 3 years!1!1!!1!1!1’1!” think tough year ahead Yes, sorry. Textbook. Everything I've far exactly like normal cold. person talking about? talking general. personal situation.

So oh please what? question many lives (or willing to) save.

The question is, save many lives, *which* lives save?

It's like we've got bunch livers lying around give people earned it. 10 livers 20 people need them, decide gets them? situation, alcoholic bottom list. 

Similarly, we'll treat everyone covid, questions asked... right enough resources able treat everyone. tough choices made gets limited resources have, doesn't, start asking tough questions. choose get vaccinated get reinfected infect others. Sick people sick people ...

The point triage (or be): severe likely survive.

As far people knowingly endanger others: deserve least (or nothing) politic.

Guys, it’s quite *insane* even single iota anti-vax thinking first world countries 2021 21 century. grasping straws holding onto dear pride ENTIRE YEAR 2020 FUCKED 75% 2021 much better. Wake fuck up, get jab move on…. Or, get back damn line behind everyone got vaccinated heathen.

It’s harder come solutions.  stop admitting unvaccinated people hospital? Let hocus-pocus homeopathy essential oils save instead.

Doesn't seem rare all. Florida midst third wave COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations fatalities, Broward Health Medical Center Fort Lauderdale acknowledged Saturday forced set temporary refrigerated mortuary space.

In statement late Saturday afternoon, hospital told South Florida Sun Sentinel, “We, like health systems across region, use temporary mortuary coolers, unfortunate result loss life experienced past months COVID-19.”

The question whether portable facilities use, brought precautionary measure went unanswered Saturday.

On Friday, Florida-record 1,486 coronavirus deaths reported week (212.3 daily average). those, 29 additional deaths people 29 younger.

Dr. J.J. Rajter, pulmonary critical care physician, seeing patients BHMC 15 years. heard portable morgue Saturday, hardly surprised need one.

“What happened across country presently, massive spike admissions,” Dr. Rajter explains, “This worse point pandemic, opinion. Hearing truck whatever ... part surprise all. ICU overwhelmed.”

Last week, cases increased 16.6% Broward County, 17.6% Palm Beach County 9.9% Miami-Dade County, according U.S. Centers Disease Control &amp; Prevention.

The seven-day trend new cases dipped past three days 20,134, though number still 28.3% higher previous record (15,691 Jan. 10′s data) existed July 29′s report. record seven-day average daily cases 21,788 Monday’s data.

Because state releases number new cases deaths dates occurred rather date reported, numbers likely higher CDC releases.

“I don’t know using anticipating need it,” continues Dr. Rajter. “I personally feel difficult times. seeing large numbers people who, whatever reason, don’t get vaccinated. [They]become sick instead seeking medical attention … linger home. finally seek medical attention, dire circumstances.

The statement Broward Health Medical Center goes read: “We join families grieving loss loved ones even dedicated caregivers everything power care COVID patients.”

The Sun Sentinel still contacting regional medical centers see others bring portable morgues.

JFK Medical Center West Palm Beach responded using temporary morgues “at time.”

Neither Delray Medical Center (in Delray Beach Lake Worth) St. Mary’s Medical Center West Palm Beach, managed Tenet Health.

Do think situation mine closer norm people?   spelled “People choose remain unvaccinated” wrong part do, thankfully. US universal healthcare. one time i'm thankful don't. idea. Look, you’re talking morality action, first step *intentionality*. thought behind action? throw brick window kill someone, morally better *intentionally* killing someone brick (assuming random innocent person cases). cases you’re fault, morality action changes mindset time.

In case intentional action: getting vaccinated. *dangerous* action, leading spread proliferation illness kills people one time fifty. particular action root cause whole problem running space hospitals.

Given that, would put equal standing someone right thing? prioritize people whose actions intentions *cause* problem, things equal. guess I’m asking is, since I’m fully vaccinated still caught Covid., recover safe assume vaccine wasn’t effective preventing catching covid (though symptoms mild) keep mind going forward. effective keeping catching it, happened get unlucky got hit 5% chance? official recommendation regarding booster shots? got J&amp;J, wondering necessary..

The thing said countries public health insurance. Better respirators saves. kill people, increase deficit, neglecting promotion respirator use. 


Learn huge human cost stupid (if criminal) anti-mask recommendations done WHO, CDC, USSG, on, resulting economical impact. That’s pretty crazy infected fully vaccinated *and* masked.

Can ask situation was? eight hours work sitting beside someone infected? Thats wild able double salary one jump, must feel somewhat offended former employer got away paying half worth long. think younger generations open talking much get paid (my folks never liked this) another good way keeping wages growing fair rate effective early treatment, noted, mass solution.

What NZ Covid absolutely correct response them, can't compare situation response UK's. type vaccine works since 1995. found new application fight covid, tech studied analyzed decades hence approved quickly rushed.  

The reality even still safety concerns need theoughly researched benefit vaccine outweighs everything else. global pandemic could taken global economy. Trying picturing every single country struggling feed citizens everyone either sick dying. dark ages came bubonic plague. want another dark age?

Also, ever looked side effects widely prescribed medications? Lots dangerous side effects benefit outweighs cost. seems massively privleged position wait 2 hours highly expensive effective treatment inaccessible majority world.

I’ve known moms friends friends parents grandparents growing up.

In simple explanation, healthcare

And agree chronic issues presented could (and should) reduced early prevention treatment education, it’s stressful system since cases patients don’t pile ER ICU like covid. Especially if, example, diabetic patient could easily take proven safe vaccine almost guarantee hospitalized disease. already stated plenty times thread: 1 get livers 2 don't, high likelihood keep drinking thus die anyway.  


Triage deciding deserves medical intervention doesn't. Regardless stupid one decline vaccine, thought denying people care ""don't deserve it"" real icky vibes. real next step Walmart McDonald's dissolve cease exist. People shop locally dine locally. need shove thousand people day awful businesses ever order believe this, must believe entire international medical scientific community giant conspiracy.   vaccines meant lower severity symptoms come virus…then would say prioritize unvaccinated since might severe symptoms. course patient vaccinated experiencing severe symptoms…then operate person sick. don’t think set precedent picking patients based weither adhere doctor/nurse values. One places don’t need discrimination hospital. I'm sure physically possible.

I'm sincerely relieved better &lt;3 people close me. I’m counting people like friends aunt uncle got infected church Georgia last year. already ill health problems intensive care month.

So guess different meaning word ""close me"". using definition know two people died virus. using loose definition pool getting people grown 150 well tens thousands. don’t know anyone infected post vaccine.

Me neither. know anyone who's adverse reaction virus bar friend got bit fever. Thailand dont even allow indoor dining numbers still climbing. Next time bring line thinking add patients likelihood leaving hospital, getting infecting three others unvaccinated. I’m sure don’t use medications all, always refuse drugs rest life consistent, since medications dangerous FDA approval doesn’t mean anything?

Anti-vaxxers sure didn’t take long move goalposts… Sadly military can’t massive 1-2k medical deployments anymore.

Too many states need, militaries hospitals well local civilian partners getting smashed covid.

People really need start taking seriously. Maybe it’s southern state, one large, local hospitals SC released Covid stats yesterday them, it’s closer 14% hospitalized Covid vaccinated, 11% ICU, didn’t disclose vaccinated status deceased. caveat, didn’t go detail vaccine used Pfizer/Moderna used, patients required two doses versus partial 💯. see READING news, literally ZERO breakthrough cases...meaning nobody vaccinated gotten Covid-19 (SARS-Cov-2). even crazy case one person got it, bad symptoms would impossible spread it. actually thinking, context, Europe lol aware vaccinated people carry viral load unvaccinated? Going maskless definitely part problem. 4,400,000 deaths counting.

That's idea anyone reasonably well-informed would ever suggested going quick controllable seems outright intentionally misleading me.

Now, people considered CDC end-all-be-all experts somewhat justifiable distrust them, ascribe distrust **all** experts.

 Hope get see episodes Covid/Vaccine deniers. Yeah, think person saying it’s “every man himself” ideology developed United States large part due capitalism. “I got car leaving gets pulls next me, near entrance store,” fired multiple rounds, Valdez told news station. “As soon got shot driving away, thing could think saw blood pouring everywhere son wife.”

Safe assume, given context. Additionally, survival statistics mentioned normal conditions, ICU capacity, important surgeries flow without pause. weird headline referencing Raleigh clinical research site running ENSEMBLE2 looks like. vaccine barely anything doubt this. welp, like “The guest almost certainly contract COVID ship, assisted expert medical care board ultimately evacuated Belize provided resource family."" theoretically possible highly unlikely. None current variants demonstrate ability; mostly transmissible. Thanks correction. cap Declare national emergency mandate vaccine. tolerate kind ebemy assistance Pearl Harbor, millions people assiting Japanese invade mainland... there's little difference government fucking corrupt Well, Pfizer 3 weeks shots many countries consider 1 week 2nd shot fully vaccinated, figuring data release mid September, approval mid October, kids fully vaccinated mid November. 3 months.

Anyhow, I'm arguing schools 100% virtual, seems silly worse situation kids year last year's peak, vaccines close, many schools 100% virtual last year similar much lower case rates even offer virtual option. kids well, many poorly virtually. get. offer option? would offer dual benefits allowing kids test positive seamlessly continue learning remotely (instead totally closing schools) well simply reducing number kids classrooms, making safer all.

I stopped trying understand though, people made bad choices. New York Times podcast “The Daily” predicted thing late January early February year. remember thinking “Holy shit. hope wrong.” I'm ER doc treated 97 year old weeks ago covid. also vaccinated came mild symptoms thinking possibly sinus infection. responded news test positive chuckle said something light-hearted like ""oh my! Well never would guessed that"". remember staring monitor spoke full, unlabored sentences, seeing oxygen percent 98 99% room air realizing surreal moment was. One year ago exact patient would likely come either dead, intubated, ready intubated. Hey, give health care system credit. pricing lot people able get medical advice doctors turned internet medical information (because free) know can't put something online true.  None officers area wear masks control brains? shortages come, I’m sure. Logisticians getting fair share work pandemic. math, 50 60% efficacy would 2 2.5x less likely infected fully vaccinated. round 3? rounded up. ""3"" came prevalence figures 1.21% unvaccinated vs 0.4% fully vaccinated. sure question. occasional breakthrough cases mean insurance can't drop coverage willingly unvaccinated people. proportion vaccine refusers need change minds order achieve “good control”? Whatever number is, would like see CDC’s plan achieving sure doesn’t feel like we’ll ever get there.  worried since beginning pandemic, cancer survivor otherwise fit healthy, vaccinated. get sick someone else age, vaccinated cancer history, probably ain't getting ventilator.

Yes know chances exact scenario happening me, personally, extremely low. chances happening *somebody* growing day, especially hotspots like Florida. Well example: I’m currently danger gotten exposed anti vaxxer. I’m probably fine, I’m staying home get negative test results. It’s fucking annoying unfortunate reality remember calmly typing social media platforms January 2020 I've reading reports concerning coronavirus specificity stated avoiding alarmist, time pay attention would likely cause pandemic. ridiculed many people comments, people know care about, admonished putting people risk panic would kill people virus. knew day never going get contained immediately. Yeah, same. got Pfizer, spouse got Moderna. (Different days county center -- guess rotated due ease administering next appt. freezer planning.)

Neither us would turned J&amp;J, either. happy get vaccinated.  true. reddit

shockingly, people like around people. find fascinating group says ""let want"" shames people want office (not particular, general sentiment around place) think would quick tbh. would disastrous short term collapse healthcare system. Likely drawn possibly mutating every year like flu say that. Delta came India, largely unvaccinated time.

Virusses evolve like everything else. chance mutating whenever make babies, mutation useful survivability, persevere.

Now, Virusses make babies? Inside hosts. hosts shortest time, all? vaccinated. proven trying persuade people facts logic makes dig heels. Kring lets quietly fester spread. Therefore really make sure know rest society mocks ridicules decisions. *second chin  Blessed cheesemakers. correct answer. would mostly back normal missing like 3 million people US alone.

Edit - oh variants would cooked might infect us much, would probably kill millions extra across globe. Yes older people sure vaccinated cause scared shitless . It’s younger people think fine get Covid problem .   No, want wear mask anymore. want go class without mask look people's full faces see facial expressions. want sit library day studying wear mask. want wear contacts every day dry eyes glasses get fogged mask. want greet friends class fist bump, handshake, hug, worry it.

It's especially frustrating since I'm vaccinated healthy. I'll sick day two get Covid, I'll good boy take every precaution. I'm worried anymore, there's solution it. Oh yeah, university requiring vaccine still wear masks. Great. vax mask need come solution isn’t mask 100% time, distance 100% time. many businesses events put hold due those. simply cannot move society we’re requiring limited capacity, distancing, first reaction restrictions. need solution isn’t go hide home. breakthrough hospitalizations deaths overwhelmingly elderly people pre-existing conditions. Vaccines 100% guarantee get virus, like birth control 100% mean get pregnant... stack odds favor. Get vaccinated. symptom much larger issue: first generation humans internet  UK simple home testing packs. think might covid apply test, gets delivered test pop back post. 

No communism required. Like miracle.   it’s full vaccinated people what’s exact issue? pandemic Missouri right almost bad ever, cases soaring ICU beds filling COVID-19 patients. Axios: latest update painted pretty grim picture state COVID-19 outbreak area. finding success holding forums different physicians stand hour answering questions. There’s sub Q injections now, IV.

These big clinics almost certainly sub-Q. That's long wait actually. Pretty impressive. little glass vial??  can’t make profit providing health care, fewer people provide health care. Back school gonna really, really messy. Agreed. lot people want hear this, majority country social end pandemic already here. People either vaccinated care anymore, never cared begin with. Everyone know, even people unvaccinated kids, mostly back normal terms going etc. masks mostly non-existent. would say back normal too, exception large events like concerts. overabundance caution anything, yet gone one. fully vaccinated Covid 99.999% likely minor inconvenience, even that. Get vaccinated, let's move life. know people read get upset, reality learn live this, vaccines way out. Get vaccinated. author doesn’t seem take seriously either idea

The author one knowledgeable people vaccines - I'd trust pretty much anyone else. Lab made antibodies EUA status made using aborted fetal cells. Pentavaxed must've spent 10 minutes staring keyboard coming sick burn, well done! Yes mandates work better people mask social distance right cause know need party open everything back up.

Remember early case NYC commuter traveled worked Grand Central? alone would exposed thousands.  hopeful projection. hope working home still option. you’re late teens, early mid 20s one know normal summer. myopic *only ones sub act like isn’t 95% over* honestly laughable. Seriously, paying attention?

Moderna ostensibly better Pfizer, etc. People ask brand got stress would've taken could get hands on. happened Pfizer. 

All talk antibodies decreasing time stuff seems premature well. think lot ways measure overall efficacy, symptomatic cases mild job still accomplished?

Ugh talking Covid??? we'll treat everyone covid, questions asked... right enough resources able treat everyone. 

And that?

Staffing finite resource, we've learning hard way they'll get burned leave.

Having treat everyone *now* means we'll less treat people tomorrow.

Listening complaints, upset going hell people wrong things making lives worse, ease burden, time, give people who've least tried right thing. forgetting many variants might emerged spread unchecked. yeah would lottttt dead people ones left would probably lots long covid thought different strains break cases myth say shouldn’t exist.  Sure, illnesses vaccines 100% effective stopping sickness transmission produce variants, plus animals can't catch them. None true COVID, makes different. Even 100% people double vaccinated, still spread. need vaccine passports think doug ford eventually cave. rest suffer idiots choose get vaccinated.  know answer one! Absolutely, ethicists worried.

I'm assuming rounded 2.5 3 headline. I’m vaccinated wear masks going out. know plenty people whose kids testing positive. It’s ludicrous say parents kids kids literally cannot get vaccinated. pathetic argument. accept huge numbed Americans idiots without outside help encouragement. personally think situation like given priority. might unvaccinated goal herd immunity protect individuals medically unable get vaccine.

The great part it? super easy fix! get vaccinnated! Unreadable word salad. work COVID ICU Florida. number people see struggling breathe regret getting vaccinated, getting intubated exhausting. It’s story.

Simply neglected warnings doctor gave me. Thank taking time respond. Healthcare states different practise. Though it’s many years since worked ITU junior.

(see pages flu virus different strains every year, often multiple ones. best predict new strains catching upcoming season months ahead time, occasionally whiff that's get ""less good"" flu vaccines target wrong strains. Covid mutate quickly, great news else point original vaccines would nearly useless, course change time new vaccines likely eventually necessary. think serious issue cluster vulnerable unvaccinated people. It’s similar huge outbreaks unvaccinated counties. Personally I’m seeing lot brain trust shifting “the FDA approves food ingredients illegal countries! trust them??” usual healing crystal crowd rightoids Anti-vaxxers denied access hospitals catch Covid. Period! dichotomy astounding. 

There’s nowhere country people likely help neighbors, tell protect vulnerable getting shot it’s like asked kick mother twat. 

We’re living volunteer state status. I’m sure U.S. countries U.K. treatment reserved people likely poor outcomes… boomers.  government paid ~$40 front, that's good thing. Cool story bro. tell Hunters laptop. agree unvaccinated people lower triage list? removed ICU patient better stats arrives? knew masks effective. That’s point. attempt preserve enough masks healthcare personnel instead speaking masks, created messaging 100% lies knew pushing it. gutted credibility, helped fuel mask debate doubt, cost lot lives. 

I’m saying healthcare didn’t need masks more, blatantly lied general public. shortsighted. 

Then again, also question intelligence people saw important doctors nurses wear masks heard CDC say don’t need masks thought “ya, makes sense.” Far worried variants may come areas vax rolled significantly... selective pressure favor variants defeat vaccine protection. towns likely get hit next. 

Delta coming town visit family, nothing it. Except one little thing... You’re correct even sub doesn’t agree. Either way constant barrage doomsday prophecies numbed people galvanized position. Essentially longer care feel nothing changes either way. mention political parties hijacked human message point dissolution. best bet educate compassionate approach anti vaccine crowd make end roads vaccination rates.

My comment meant slightly funny, understand sentiment. ordering in-home test instead getting going get tested sending someone homes test see people owning actually COVID hiding different. 

I think may misunderstood comment though. need clarification. Who's homes send test people? misread it? make much difference, probably real answer.

Almost nobody wears masks Netherlands. It'd probably help us little bit, also kind annoying summer. Outside worst-hit Western nations, vaccines still relatively scarce rest world.

I blame Federal govt lot decisions, late secure Pfizer, NZ boat. reality - early days, seemingly even secure doses quarantine staff.

The US total export ban remember (I'm assuming lifted now), India - largest vaccine manufacturer - banned exports wave, even Europe, saviour rest world stage, held back least one shipment us basis need.

Basically, they're abundant US due export controls, much anything. Beyond that, impossible jump queue due loud countries would object, IP rights limit capacity big names say produce.

What *did* secure always back loaded, 10mn+ doses/month October. Something we've known since around March, iirc. then? relative trickle. professional athletes are, blatant actions, CLEARLY less likely follow medical advice.  missing point. bunch vaccinated people age arrive exact time, he'd absolutely behind line. punishment, consequence.

It sucks, sucks everyone dies prematurely. Still good see. think us worried loved ones oneself.  I'm vaccinated precautions. worry family. me. seem like agree vaccination status definitely triage list, vaccinated individuals get care first (all triage concerns equal) since much likely survive. 

For unvaccinated people, cause compounding issue filling ICU beds spreading virus community leading ICU space consumed. reasonable require unvaccinated people get vaccinated condition treatment Covid-19? precedence hospitals policy hospitals could make? dad child old enough reddit, already comorbidity age. Yes policy ought cover costs got vaccinated.   say happened grandparents? Flu? People complain live long day we’re given “timelines” “things benchmark against” when… that’s exactly is. 

That’s exactly headlines are. Setting aside it’s kind ridiculous try put virus timeline, reason keep shifting goalposts “really run pandemic ground” whatever term week enough us able get vaccinated otherwise use common sense pandemic choosing blowing right past arbitrary dates. tired. I've completely normal summer, children 12. choosing restrict yourself. stop thinking way it.

At core, people cowards. much hide real reasons wanting vaccine behind excuses.

So lot real reason wanting ""because f that's why"" ""don't tell do"".

But cowards knowing deep inside selfish individuals, hide behind excuses... ""it's FDA approved!""... ""the approval rushed!!"".

The result is, going find next excuse move on. point wasting time them. Right know Israel, said ""most"", nations? wonder positive step towards rescinding European travel ban, lot Europeans Pfizer.  Still way less military spending budget wish Smart Health Cards (which CA uses) would support wallets website. It’s incredibly easy thing code. may bring one coworkers it. trust before, know mandated stated mandated anyway hold last second rather getting getting go places without tests on. 

Not greatest reason get it, take get terms people getting vaccinated. Oh yeah, forgot that. Strange bedfellows, apt saying. *does* happen viruses! fused cells called ""Syncytia"" 

RSV - Respiratory syncytial virus. even name! really common one probably before.

If why, mean ""how"", partly virus particle fuses cell, outside virus becomes part outside cell, ""leftover"" spikes fuse adjacent cells.

If ""why"" mean ""what for"", complicated. anthropomorphize second, virus go cells via particle formation, that's much riskier joining bunch cells together making bunch virus exploding once. Like, there's less risk particles formed. virus ""think"", even metabolism, alive, useful think way sometimes. wonder positive step towards rescinding European travel ban, lot Europeans Pfizer.

Without herd immunity, vaccine alone protect *eventually* infected. good news makes much less likely infected, case infected odds severe case dramatically decrease. would defined long term then? Anything past year?  Fuck everybody 30, right? arbitrary age cutoffs make sense. Pretty sure anybody 40 realm low risk pretty easy make. thing cuts QR code screen shot throws wallet. Well something spreads faster like delta variant makes fair amount population vaccinated enough hinder spread, provides pretty good selective pressure vaccine resistant mutations proliferate. half bodies virus encounters immunity, virus evades immunity spread twice many people outcompete mutations can't proliferate effectively vaccinated bodies. vaccine resistant mutation develops country small number like 5% vaccinated, mutations strengths vaccine resistance may better overall vaccine resistant variant noticeable advantage small number people encounters.

Vaccines work best majority population inoculated infection trouble spreading new hosts. Every new host extra potential mutation factory. dozen people community get sick, easier track virus changing make booster shots targeting worrisome changes compared 100,000 people community infected serving new virus factories. Scroll top page read headline FDA approval. Exactly right, it’s pretty scary willing people follow everyone else research grill people - waiting time, research made sure ready, I’m booked - issue bish, same. vaccine doesn’t stop spread.

Great news nonetheless! I’m getting mixed messages here. likely happen, based latest info:

(A) Pfizer released 5-12 data September FDA issues EUA weeks. 

(B) Data released September, FDA requires 4-6 months follow-up, EUA “mid-winter.”    Haven’t gone depth approval process, picked info recent vox article, “For vaccines, FDA grants emergency use authorizations reviews least two months follow-up results clinical trial participants received actual injection. full approval, known FDA-speak “biologics license application,” agency wants see six months data ensure widespread problems detect adverse reactions. reviews examine safety efficacy”   excuse what, even live States double vaccinated weeks. sure keep acting like know talking don’t see eye eye I’m guessing there’s lot won’t agree cut loses say. influenza known Coronavirus.

Oh agree, breath whole idea ""religious exemptions"" counter productive even thing. Historically never ""thing"" recently something introduced nefarious reasons nothing religion. waiting J&amp;J? Pfizer FDA approved *right now*. Also, Moderna back April May - literally side effects except slightly sore arm day after, sore arm get flu shot. yeah, makes complete sense. Safety first. physical earlier year vaccine access still based age groups vulnerability, doctor let know qualified letter saying extremely vulnerable one pound overweight BMI range. indefinitely mean permanently moving one ultra conservative place another reduce culture shock. 80s 90s???? 

I remember Aids, fighting middle east, NRA, dot com bubble, corporations running ads Clintons. Rush Limbaugh Newt Gingrich. Ronald Reagan messing taxes. early covid symptoms December 2019. tested bronchitis, strep, influenza, tests came back negative. could tell ""an acute respiratory infection lead pneumonia known Coronavirus."" shortness breath caused go doctor. fatigue lasted forever, fact noticed cleared second vaccine shot.

Things changed.  Mild correction: charge everyone across board, can’t specifically charge individual due pre-existing condition (Covid otherwise).

Two big problems Victoria. first possible continued incursion virus people entering NSW border, seeding new cases hiding contact tracers know they'd fined massively least. Secondly lockdown simply may tough enough, complied enough bring R-rate 1. 

The NZ lockdown restriction Level 4 much tougher Victoria's terms shutting economy. Far fewer workplaces allowed operate NZ, reducing potential contacts. Level 4 last year dropped R-rate 0.4. believe highest restrictions brought 0.8.

A combination factors, superficially compelling none really substantive start scraping away paint. 

The biggest driver always pure, deep-bone fatigue; people wanted over, year spent amidst crisis seemed like quite enough. better way return normalcy summer fun relief?

The sense possible bolstered strongly apparent initial successes Israel's vaccine roll-out. Many hopeful observers saw appeared sharp decline cases dwindling almost nothing long anything like majority people vaccinated. can't count number articles threads pumped great things going early 30% fully vaccinated, 60% partially vaccinated, threshold seemed extremely reachable without ever get messy business combating obstinate anti-vax community. collapse Israel's infections, hospitalizations, deaths, etc. came amidst expected seasonal downturn seemed lost far many, many people instead chose believe vaccines silver bullet would end nightmare good, fast.

In Ontario, specifically, many people looked back experience summer 2020 -- things far uncertain, given still early stages whole thing, lots still unknown, anyone's guess would ultimately turn out. Nevertheless, summer 2020 saw Ontario reach almost unbelievably low numbers new active cases. province 14 million people days increases measured double digits. virus could driven powerfully even virgin field scenario vaccines present, surely next summer -- better understanding virus, better medical interventions, course vaccines -- would see us reach triumphant conclusion last.

Of course, worked way all. Ontario's public health measures calamitous hodgepodge under- over-reaction every step, too-early reopening second wave took province right throat third, we're... here, wherever is. Even comparatively high vaccine coverage, 500 days' worth experience draw on, whatever seasonal benefits summer gives, Ontario poised enter fall winter plausibly 10 20 times many active cases going part 2020, time apparent conviction running schools much public life normal perfectly fine. Add virtually far cases much infectious variant, *not great*.

I'm guess I'm still ""reality bites"" gen x er. Doctors abide oaths, matter frustrating is. Please tell everyone southern border. What's point build long-term immunity avoid getting covid, get covid naturally (one times) build good immunity? Yes, getting booster might less protective natural immunity, could possibly hurt long run, answer ""the young could/should get covid anyway""? 

The vaccine perhaps reduces chances long covid 50%, safer way go, since doomed get covid one way another? least get it, partial vaccine-induced immunity?

Or saying keep getting boosters, spoils chances ""proper"" response natural infection, let natural infection happen sooner? I'm UK we're around month behind Israel terms lockdown. (afaik) similar vaccination rate us, similar population density (however, London really sways things odds).

~15-25x seems right me, that's damn good actually. Even 10x would great.   I’m missing negative aspect this. Someone help here. peak, bottom barrel either. honestly know would done husband getting vaccinated. 

 Thankfully, idiot make choice. 

But that's part compatibility - two people agree something important basic vaccination, they're probably good life partners. Speaking chiropractors, come one goes can't breath virus? thought could enable body heal anything? provide basis claim? 95% hospitalizations unvaccinated people, Ontario, vaccinated people 86% less likely test positive. last year? makes absolutely sense.

This stuff hard.  Right, like somebody dropped nbomb date i’d realize fucked head. dodged bullet. Move on. Hippocrates oath doesn’t force doctors work lmao     fact *started* testing year ago mean actually tested entire year. Longest clinical study Pfizer month long. Someone work saying thing. literally made appointment. Glad see push people get it! lotteries looked open everyone got vaccinated whether lottery created. 

I kinda stop looking though could didn’t… Hope healthy single life!   Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* question here, would take convince them?

How about, starters, completion regular clinical trials? FDA approved vaccine despite clinical trials set completed say vaccine came mRNA vaccines thing since 17 years ago? Correct I'm wrong here, I'm genuinely asking.

What mean ""have thing since 17 years ago""? mean development long? so, right that. mean ""have use since 17 years ago"". wrong that. never approved mRNA vaccine, either humans animals. lack vaccines currently used get EUA six months satisfactory study completed emergency use authorized? further, 171 million people fully vaccinated largest ""study"" ever done vaccine?

I would agree mass deployment vaccines EUA provided large sample size evaluate short-term/immediate efficacy safety vaccines. short-term/immediate efficacy safety one piece puzzle. 

Regarding short-term safety, found? CDC/FDA's VAERS system shows 13,000 vaccine-related deaths US last week. almost certainly lower-bound number, since VAERS self-reporting tool therefore prone under-reporting. 

But even taking number face value, mean regarding short-term safety least 13,000 vaccine-related deaths? really comfortable hand-waving away saying ""well XX million doses, 13,000 deaths bad"", currently done?

The second part puzzle course long-term safety efficacy. Long-term safety complete unknown. simply data. clinical trials Pfizer's vaccine going complete guess understand hold people saying ""it's FDA approved therefore safe.""

There process drug approval followed vaccines. FDA using expedited process. confident safety data, government feels benefits outweigh risks. feels bit like Lord Farquaad Shrek, proclaiming ""Some may die, risk willing take"".

Many individuals, particularly young healthy, share risk assessment. could way reason delay promised results. Like dog ate homework. covid can't report results promising months. /s sound like maybe covid IQ dropped little. would look that. Would able offer discounted rate vaccination?

My position already sufficient data know even everybody hypothetically vaccinated still exposed significant risk, fairly easy substantiate credible data getting easier time new, increasingly worrisome reports keep coming in. example, Delta plus Lambda variants already increase, great concern.

And besides extrapolating conservatively current situation, also real possibility mutations arising current vaccines little protective effect. current time control situation, lower risk becomes. means must act every means disposal wish minimize risk far worse situation today, already horrible deteriorating rapidly. Even 73% eligible population already fully vaccinated. terrify paying attention. terms matters, safety, they're Wait out. They'll remove problem eventually.

Edit: that's we're US least far year. going pretty well. 50,000 far. tools keep Delta check

This isn’t problem obviously Think MRNA vaccines (Pfizer/Moderna) like wanted poster picture virus it. Without wanted poster, body’s immune system basically freaks infected Covid can’t mount effective effect. MRNA wanted poster, immune prepared recognize invader responds way would coronaviruses, like common cold. Yes, might get sick, that’s immune system works sees familiar virus. fact, exposure earlier, pre-covid, coronaviruses actually explains people get mild illness Covid instead serious one. 

I little hesitant new type vaccine learned work. instead worried, amazed cool benign MRNA vaccines are. example amazing scientists far come dark days 100 years ago didn’t even know viruses existed. kind ironic, viruses around lot longer people have.

No.  buy military tanks small police departments see pandemic new variant crossing overseas public health strategy martyr nurses, blame pandemic sick people’s life choices. unacceptable I’m disgusted successful scapegoating campaigns destroying morale accomplishing absolutely nothing else Hubei, lockdown total.

Yes, mid-February mid-March definitely stricter lockdown world. 

Initially, comparable Spain's Italy's. People could go supermarkets walks, masks far (mostly due supply issues). tough lockdown total like became later on. people use term ""medical field"", know. Look are.

There’s handful military hospitals hot spots, MTF’s serve AD guys, families, retirees, cases civilians. transmission lessened base due relatively high vax rates, staggering work hours, mask mandates, still community surrounding base affecting admissions.

No DoD doesn’t report HHS site, DoD hospitals sealed bases plenty retired anti vax keep busy (retirees often flock areas large military hospitals free healthcare, much many times BRAC military hospitals clinics stay open even base shuts down. Oh no, majority experts say need proof. must wrong something. /s

I'm gonna side experts one lol. like along covid vaccines. Thanks! heartily support vaccinations, source number. 

Myself family fully vaccinated, got soon qualified first trimester pregnancy. vulnerable I’m also looking getting booster. think would long adults medical reason vaccinated. Obviously children treated priority regardless whether vaccinated fault parents stupid old enough vaccinated yet.  Lol country they’re ICU beds across south 600,000 died? That’s hilarious. country even full neither vaxxed unvaxxed. traveling future. Thanks 4 vaccines unlocked power.  held standards Hippocratic Oath indeed noble quite limiting one allowed consider patient care. It’d like Michelin Star chef held standard must feed diners satisfactorily even one picky demanded chicken nuggets. Sorry situation. hope everything turns well possible family.
Ultimately think (schools) focused getting kids back person Covid us taking back seat plan. Yes, many schools masks ""deep cleaning"" place distancing, vent measures help. Staff prepared it. time goes by, feel people general, let Thier guard even more. mandatory vaccines include children (along boosters) battle going drag on. thing get booster ASAP best protect yourself. pretty much every one keep safe, point. US “I told whole life take experimental drugs""

I remember ever conversation growing up. Easter, next Easter. Easter claim always hogwash.

This year’s Easter claim could almost true didn’t country made 35% adult toddlers. teacher friends Florida told me, every kid florida school use full-time virtual school, means can't ever go actual school. Basically, either enroll kids virtual school go in-person school, going back forth. Covid, told me. reason they're delaying, though? pander lost causes? sincerely doubt it. 


If approve vaccines without absolute guarantee safety, bunch children come adverse reactions, that's reputation vaccine, every vaccine thereafter worry about. need children vaccinated litany diseases order maintain health society we've grown accustomed.  


As parent, really frustrating FDA taking time, consider fact AAP lobbied FDA swifter approval cautioned off-label use. Safety important greater good, appease blowhard anti-vaxxers. Totally agree - would never advocate voluntary exposure. previously infected (pre vaccine era) excused. goal immunization (natural vaccine). medical literature blatantly clear this, thank god is. everyone country vaccinated we'd still pickle. Fewer dead pickles though suppose both? could lot vaccinated-yet-asymptomatic-carriers there.

Finding would also help slow spread. 🤣 Florida sure … Darwinism finest.   little high compared UK think blame southern states low vaccination that. However ALSO means Northern states much worry wave eventually comes  go get tested, want rapid test require get PCR test well rate false negatives. 

We colds nonstop house last 2 months. one tested positive covid, son husband fevers, chills, symptoms seem Covid like. LOT going around right now. husband vaccinated, mask, WFM/stay home mom. But, son goes preschool brings home everything us. That's working clip. said joking save face initially asked ludicrous. asked Dr. Birx way inject UV light cleaning agent body looked into.  saying Jan/Feb 2021 Delta took off?  seat belt thing equivalent all.

If ate lunch together, started driving home died wreck wearing seat belt, mean going die going home wearing seat belt.

If ate lunch together covid positive, infected me, potentially die.

Whereas vaccinated, breakthroughs, odds we'd never know it.


Antivaxxers chosen fate, Saruman famously said: chosen death. Might well add 2 years case   Yes. going say way data recorded. leads biased viewpoints. doesn’t mean vaccines working way CDC collects data include enough detailed information breakthroughs, likely bigger issue leading on, effect messaging proper response? 

Everyone going say vaccines weren’t designed stop transmission blah blah blah…. BUT….

That’s led believe happening CDC everyone acting case. That’s back-peddled vaccinated people wearing masks indoors, saw data countries going Delta surge. least open beds /s mean cover health conditions related even allow potential surcharge coverage. 

And marketplace plans allow weight based surcharges like employer based ones can. parents stressed past breaking point. Many us worked home took care kids time year more. Many parents rely schools childcare they’re work. Something give. school districts least trying safe it, (requiring masks, best implement cleaning, requiring vaccinations staff, etc..) others pretending there’s pandemic going on. 

I know I’m alone say this, spouse didn’t want send kids back daycare unvaccinated. went far try get vaccine trials. recalled back offices weren’t given much choice. Let give kid modicum protection throw back wild. 

They’ve running tests kids months. least much data adults gave EUA, given millions adults taken vaccines they’ve proven safe effective, it’s highly unlikely there’s going massively adverse affect children. Difference choose ""live"" it. There's still real cap hospitalizations pretty much everywhere hospitalized persons persons admitted intensive care unit, median age higher among vaccinated persons (median = 64 years, interquartile range [IQR] = 53.0–76.0 years; median = 64 years, IQR = 54.0–76.0 years, respectively) partially vaccinated persons (median = 59, IQR = 46.0–72.0; median = 65, IQR = 57.0–80.0, respectively) among unvaccinated persons (median = 49, IQR = 35.0–62.0; median = 56, IQR = 41.0–66.0, respectively) (p&lt;0.001)*


I feel like important note comes breakthrough infections *are* seeing. think fat people deserve treatment, drunks, drug addicts, car crash victims without seat belts, people smoke, eat unhealthily? enemy war?

If treat based lifestyle historic choices line? sure move? care chose wrongly, deserve treatment human. Doctors decide gets right life. goes oaths take.

Justice blind. Alright im going get downvoted this. time frame literally waves covid. Delta widespread US time, Delta really picked early august. Hop google sec look graph LA. study done timeframe would inclusive current state things true Username checks out. idea lead poisoning concern bullets left in. assume major due fact often leave bullets said.

I think j&amp;j care they're basically really wanted many countries they're putting dollars research? Impossible unless China Yes. Generally speaking appears true infected vaxxed folk tend lower viral loads. Yet, still high viral loads making transmissibility much problem infected unvaxxed individual. Hence, prudent action keep masking close proximity others, even fully vaxxed, still crucial mitigating spread. numbers people person infected Delta passes onto ranging ~5-8 others. Compare Alpha variant. ~1-2 new infections every 1 person infected. Delta whole different ballgame, need recognize fact, else fail.   mean care provide argument mine instead saying you’re right I’m wrong ? 36.5k deaths year disease sounds like lot. sure compare flu respiratory infections.   It’s kinda thing considering people transplant lists… Agree--I actually went cruise July (before major rises Delta) safest I've felt. knew 100% employees interacting fully vaccinated least 95% (but rumor actually 98-99%) passengers fully vaccinated. guarantee can't get land-based outing.     vaccine *does not* open myocarditis. Myocarditis generally presents 10 20 cases 100,000 persons, that’s normal rate sans vaccine. Thats .01% people. Myocarditis reported .0006% vaccinated. look numbers think taking vaccine “opening up” myocarditis??


The “99% survival rate” compelling. killed decade’s worth flu victims one year America, unprecedented lockdowns safety precautions. Without precautions would looking millions dead. 

The vaccine approved FDA. finished faster vaccines guess what, every virologist planet working problem, sharing notes, backing every relevant government, essentially infinite demand. really can’t understand able year things mind??

The goalposts haven’t moved dingus, vaccine always provided 90-95% protection infection, 80% protection infection delta variant. yes: absolutely help prevent getting covid, huge, painfully obvious margin. Like obvious I’m flabbergasted typed words “it won’t help getting Covid”. rare event breakthrough infection, yes greatly lessen symptoms. 

I feel comfortable calling anti vaxxers idiots. Again, looked good faith, you’d understand ridiculous talking points are. I’m giving benefit doubt assuming you’re troll don’t actually believe you’re typing single sentence devoid logic signifies definitely left decent conversation started.  US's death rate also much lower previous waves. It’s much important Governor look like hard ass. Florida. Smh back-dated. deaths recorded date actually occurred. see low number today yesterday, that's death happened day reported given date. look week back get real sense daily death toll Young people consistently think indestructible. matter generation.  really. Delta insanely transmissible. Efficiency vaccines keep dropping. 70 60 40. discussing boosters.

You like 99% dying covid vaccinated number super spreader events I've seen individuals vaccinated, vaccines seem to, best, give 30% chance avoiding catching virus.

The studies I've seen indicate viral loads noses vaccinated people get delta breakthrough infections high unvaccinated people. I'm sorry sake actually getting pandemic control Biden needs Fauci resign. controversial figure think anything says cause many opposite. capable botching messaging eroded credibility point hurts helps. like many position power narcissism makes think one person job obvious. many people could job less controversial. triage, hospital limited resources help one two people, prioritizing person likely survive treatment makes sense. assumes life threatening situations. mean, they're reporting 90+% covid patients unvaccinated.... see lot people continually bringing obesity, drug addiction smoking somehow comparable choices willfully choosing vaccinate.

As formerly morbidly obese person comparable. health issue morbidly obese person osteoarthritis knees contagious. Health issues obesity impact anyone obese individual. Covid contagious puts others risk.

Losing 175 pounds healthy bmi neither free easy. co-pays therapist dietitian visits gain control disordered eating. OOP expenses bariatric surgery insurance covers 90% andIhave high deductible insurance. developed complications gastric sleeve revise gastric bypass OOP costs testing get insurance approval surgery itself. Moderna shots free easy get. 

I experience addiction personally common sense easily obtained knowledge would indicate addiction far difficult recover getting covid vaccine.

Hospitals overwhelmed issue could easily prevented getting vaccine since know vast majority people needing medical care covid unvaccinated. Comparing complexities overcoming obesity drug addiction asinine.

I anti vaxxers lower priority right now. saying deny treatment treated punishing patients need care favor anti vaxxersm think they’re going they’re going regardless anyone said. people live vacuum.

We hope they’d change minds, will, I’m also expecting much anymore starting think minimize effects stubbornness rest us.  really hate constant blaming hoarding supply chain failures. hoarding help toilet paper situation? No, toilet paper 5 months. Commercial residential toilet paper stuff. lockdowns started massive demand shock nobody going offices anymore manufacturers refused change tooling meet new demand something deemed temporary. Hence get toilet paper 4 months every store everywhere made impossible hoard large scale. Diseases tend become less lethal time, that’s virus survive replicate. Hosts also build immunity well, making cases generally less severe.

I want clarify yet. Planes actually quite good ventilation HEPA filtering. planes significant vector spread, we'd know now. Add everyone wearing masks flight people flights vaccinated actually seems like relatively safe activity, counter-intuitively. 

Indoor poorly ventilated spaces people talking unmasked seems far highest risk. results expected? anyone Florida actually care? charts TX, TN, AL, GA, SC still shooting straight up.  natural immunity exists robust, durable widespread? medical community denying that: Nature swath literature showing it. Policy makers refusing acknowledge it. I’ve things.  Actually, funny mention that. something I've thought about, forgot mention...

If there's one positive bodies going full emergency ""MURDER INVADERS!"" mode vaccine, least reasonable evidence immune system built decent amount protection Covid able fight effectively run wild.

That's one reason I'm \*that\* annoyed feel like I've hit bus whenever get vaccine... know immune system taking seriously.

Suddenly, everyone anti-vaxx  argument I'm hearing currently trials finished, FDA approve it? anti-vaxxer, someone answer me? vaccinated, hospital bills doubled Quick question regarding anti-gen tests. common cold, caused cronovirus rhinovirus cause false positive?  


I'm currently going textbox cold tested positive via home test. friend said common cold trigger positive result. plan still getting PCR tomorrow morning, curious.  


I've done googling idea, find stuff saying common cold can't cause false positive, say type test. find one article japan seemed indicate possible antigen test come back false positive common cold though, find findings. don’t need rigor kids adults. School starting. need kids vaccinated prevent massive outbreaks, especially states playing politics student safety. Covid would come sooner later anyway via MIQ leaks. Even case bubble MIQ bubble closed travelers forced return via MIQ. not, girl planning quit smoking year together.

Now, instant nope best call already quit.

And even worse, interested former smokers, damaged goods already.

Planning X I'm jack shit still want benefits someone valuable. now, wait. get one others, even another J&amp;J, would probably totally safe, want information efficacy. trials going right completed soon, recommendations soon follow. doesnt hurt monitor regardless can. Key points unexpected cases transmission happening within households. Samoan church largets sub-cluster 58 cases. modelling shows exponential growth stopped cases peak within next 2-3 days. good signs. 

Also record number vaccinations yesterday 1.2% population vaccinated day. incredibly sad. 2 year old might even remember Mom. stupid ones are. unreasonable need talk doctors risks getting covid like pregnant much worse vaccine symptoms.   wife’s family wife sister didn’t want too, got vaccinated worry future damage… handle that. estimates many people actually covid infectious one point time? Maybe multiple reported cases? example, walk local grocery store 100 people, many people actually likely covid infectious, given local reported cases data point. Steve Jabs   Lol. Exactly. totally market manipulation sort. Damn, antibodies antibodies probably toast bread point. perish thought already wear improperly? want make sure. stupid they’re requiring data kids studies.

With Pfizer fully authorized 12+, government private sector mandates rolling force people get vaxxed, rates actually climb. rush it, FDA knows anti-vaxxers conservative talking heads absolute field day incidence side effects even *little* higher kids. comes Covid, answer resounding emphatic yup. moved bc landed job one larger banks Bank City. Siesta Key Sarasota always least felt like home away home. Originally Michigan.

I think itch keep getting closer ocean, prefer gulf side.

Edit: NC great housing market insanity. bought two years ago list 225k purchased for. Insanity. Agreed. couldn’t get kids trials either. one message community: get COVID-19 vaccine.

This problem. ""Or what?"". healthcare workers oath job, they've leverage let vaxed unvaxed die alike. can't tell patients apart get hospital even faced unvaxxed person do? condemn painful death ""ignorance"".

Smokers **not contagious**. smokers option taking protective vaccine, wearing mask protect others. **We laws prevent smokers causing others harm smoking.**

That true, original quote, though somehow morphed opposite.

And agree 100%. I’d like “...oh. 

So, wanna get married?”

Perfect response. 👌 You’re absolutely delusional. doctors aren’t putting people there. people putting there. medical community said get vaccinated. patients don’t listen, following medical advice time exposing doctors harm well. 

Anyone doesn’t trust vaccine, trusting doctors either therefore going treatment.

Don’t trust modern medicine? Don’t trust doctors saying? Don’t go treatment. Faced unvaxxed person hospital overwhelmed, unvaxxed tagged low priority. happen mass casualty triage conditions, causing resources allocated likely live. normal conditions, resources allocated sickest. Hospitals hot spots operating normal conditions, unvaxxed need vents likely live. need triaged better chance, hospitals overwhelmed. what's best greater good. punishment, have. enough. anything. pharmacies vaccinate you. Call local pharmacy see it. could avoid overpaying withholding. 

People handle tax withholding properly barely get tax return. get tax return means gave government 0 interest loan year.  Agreed   Either take appropriate measures virus force lockdown. Welcome natural selection Thank saying so. appreciate it. We’ll great can’t unsee pick place near office astounding little media, even center-left, willing use T-word

Yeah, there's anything I've thought last 20 years, little media willing call things terrorism rile people up... sucks bad. 

I'm working career change now. Herman Cain Memorial Tent. Fully stocked essential oils Veterinary meds. would tend agree, think refusing medical care based factor (other need) could potentially damaging society. Aside many obvious ethical implications, could reduce trust medical system medical professionals.

I would argue however, vaccination not, itself, political issue. Vaccination Covid-19 became politically charged particular context pandemic US. treating matter personal community health rather politics, case vaccines, maybe medical providers could make anti-vaxxers reckon pointless political opposition vaccination is. 

Also, think may reasonable less harmful ways disincentivize unvaccinated, increasing health insurance premiums reducing insurance coverage Covid-19 treatment. might even less direct way triage unvaccinated patients differently, based odds survival likelihood hostile uncooperative. 

On latter point, reading stories nurses, shocking kind abuse patients get away with, little recourse hospital staff often seem have. circumstances overstretched resources pandemic (including staff burnout), hospitals change policies clamp kind shit?  get it. way chair board school wife said feels like voices weren’t heard said ya well feels way getting way. Like we’re children crying something. admin area also said weren’t going masks said kids weren’t hospitals covid doesn’t affect kids. 

We ends wife felt ill half time thinking it. school also board parents speak across grades unanimously voted masks worked later. Keep hope come senses bosses afraid of? Improved productivity job satisfaction? Well good thing got Moderna then. like symptoms covid even unvaccinated. even need that, friend went around ""doctor shopping"" go far, GP gave note saying he's perfectly healthy severe health risk he's vaccinated. good enough HR manager exempt works fortune 100 company. long version *literally any* minor trauma trigger it. technically, brain predisposed it, yet... yeah, vaccine could trigger it. could flu vaccine, cold, spraining ankle. ""Comorbidity"" wish teachers would walk probably trust FDA regardless we're pandemic not. little research they've approved throughout decades. OP, said they're Texas. almost certainly ""masks optional"", given ban mask mandates. 

My heart breaks kid parents. Maybe see PCP order holter monitor potentially echocardiogram. least try rule Afib, severe arrythmias. Maybe reach back pcp tell going go symptoms determine plan care seen cardiology. referred cardiologist already, id recommend calling office nurse triage see least start basics like monitor things recommended potentially get right away. Hopefully nothing critical. apologies. confused different poster. applies unvaccinated people only, complain, vulnerable mercy right now, incur massive hospital bills supposed seems ridiculous.

For example, work office anti-vaxxers, mask wearing. fact, there's coworker mine posted sign ranting people wear masks. know immunocompromised people there, last wave COVID killed someone's relative virus went office, I'm pretty frustrated right now. Hi everyone, wondering anyone else gotten vaccinated period, I've heard getting vaccinated flow cycle interrupted intensified, irregular three day period body weird while, today second-ish day got Pfizer im gonna documenting changes see anyone else ? according website, frontline healthcare worker treats covid patients regular basis almost certain get covid, even n95 respirator. That's going vary wildly dependent location age, I'm vaccinated usually wear mask bars/restaurants/comedy clubs/etc go often never locked never mask mandate, even employees. millennial gen z, frequently go places cater demographic state like Texas Florida never pandemic everything fully open normal. places also least likely enforce kind vaccine mandate given bother mask mandates. Bahamas
Haiti
Kosovo
Lebanon
Morocco
Sint Maarten there's recent research floating around (sorry, handy, look like) shows natural immunity 2.5 times likely catch Covid vaccinated.

The natural immune response vary person person, likely dependent severity infection, whereas vaccine evokes pretty standard response people. vaccine top immunity natural infection similar getting booster shot, improve resistance future infection. know, I'm pretty sure reason AMC stock went cat horked huge hairball. mean, timing there, it!  Trying get job median salary $75K decent job security. lot them, job, believe science Subway employee believes eating fresh. attitude? said thing people got sick vaccinated, aside rarity.

I feel bad anyone took precautions. think deserve care give. get free care everything right universe mean.

I feel much strongly people get sick nothing, *now*, absolutely deserve fruit efforts. one paying keep safe willingly get hurt. Good luck! barely feel needle. freedom prioritize others. Surgeries rescheduled. immunocompromised partner spent 9 hours waiting ER yesterday covid upon covid patient piled waiting room, covered blankets oxygen. zero sympathy people outcomes have. They're clogs system point, doing. Lol medical insurance companies experts subverting ethics morality make bucks, I'm sure they'll figure out. Reminds 'topin' Onion YouTube video  Yes. asthma pre existing heart condition. doctor agreed vaccine may tight Yeah, people probably wanted double kinda got stuck. ""excuse"" get it. least they're it. wish earlier second best time now. THANK YOU!!! Currently Spravato treatment 😒 right cause people hospitalized end emergency room anyhow

Right? think I'd start risk calculation (# COVID pts) / (# people coming vaccine injuries) decide get vaccinated pretty much immediately. “I immunocompromised can’t...”

Poor dad daughter left trauma ;( CDC recommends following

""...fully vaccinated people come into [close someone suspected confirmed COVID-19 tested 3-5 days exposure, wear mask public indoor settings 14 days receive negative test result."" Yeah nursing culture needs wake call ordeal. 96% physicians vaccinated vs like 56% nurses. huge speaks volume. worked hospital city (right border northwest Florida). Sadly, ironically, interestingly… whatever… hospital mandated vaccines employees right went hospital. 

I know nurses staff hospital anti vax. held protest weeks ago vaccine mandate, personally know growing around anti-vax this. can’t imagine understanding healthcare still something like taking vaccine. Sorry losses. Thx info!  I'm pointing likely got outside hospital work.

Frankly, blame shitheads spreading disinformation discourages people taking reasonable health precautions, like getting vaccinated. Paywall website.  Also Walmart employees don’t give shit job

It’s happens pay minimum wage

You get minimum effort Rough stuff. 96%+ physicians vaccinated nurses something like 56% (LPN/RN) numbers even lower aides 45% (CNA, medical assistants etc.)

They need better. apparently much culture nurses thinking know better everyone else. numbers get better nurse question highly educated (bachelor etc master etc) still pretty poor compare physicians nurse practitioners.

r/nursing talks constantly they're preaching choir unfortunately. It’s Texas, already know suck making good decisions. need better vaccine 85% immunization, ""or"". use r0 estimate 6, need 83.3% immunity. Two doses vaccines cut infection 1/3rd may small effect transmission. Even 100% people vaccinated, still would give maybe 75% effective immunity. Without measures, Rt would still 1 virus would exponentially grow. 

Given reaching 85% vaccine even get perfect vaccine, masks, ventilation, social distancing going rest work. 

Of course previous infections contribute towards immunity Delta variant, believe much. concern Delta provide less immunity original strain Alpha. cases mean risk variants evade natural vaccine-induced immunity. Counting infections contribute much getting past covid grim prospect... Yes, wouldn’t someone?

I get flu shots yearly. don’t see covid booster different.

And there’s chance may necessary. vaccines require 2-3 boosters, spread time, order reach full effectiveness. There’s always chance that’s what’s going happen. got vaccinated Friday felt terrible Saturday, still got period Sunday expected! despite vaccine/busy immune system unaffected. still carrier virus I'm negative spread people? reference, I'm fully vaccinated Moderna recently recovered breakthrough infection. Yep, shots arms once. least use thigns anymore: http://hcvets.com/data/occupational/munji/toc.htm That's filthy disturbing. Tell more.  way better PREVNAR Yes it’s fault.  FDA given major statements risks ibuprofen acetaminophen taken billions people. Yes, given enough evidence risk outweighed benefit would change approval recommendations. first time covid vaccine FDA approved. like Reddit echo chamber much better YT comments. Rebuting anti vax gets tiring Secret Squirrel Harvey Birdman: “has anyone seen nuts?” I've pointed one family want vaccine. 

I think people understand absolutely enormous number 1 million absolute infinitesimal amount complications, much less HUNDREDS millions. damn impressive. Maybe try sleeping night...? aren’t many vaccinated people choose from.

Maybe COVID-19, people health problems stage 4 cancers, etc sent home healthcare center ""full"" particular time... due idiots. vast majority, yes.  Please don’t give medical advice don’t know talking about. Vaccine doses children aren’t weight compared adults. It’s age developing immune system responds. can't seem find picture online, swear got anthrax vaccine, like four needles attached one syringe. Imagine trying persuade general public take that.  that's heros do!   Landscaping dangerous terms deaths per 100k.  dramatically reduces *but eliminate* chance infection, almost completely eliminates risk hospitalization death. Oh. know. Lose lose them. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

I'd still recommend vaccine anyone everyone. relative vaccinated die last week. Next big step Walmart McDonalds. mandate pave way everyone else. much viral load

The vaccine virus increase viral load. extra faculty teach extra students come from? simple increasing class numbers, stuff patients ICU number nurses. ""open up"" medical school, build school. show don’t know FDA works. Drugs routinely given approval data shows risks weighed benefits. FDA continues follow drug post approval, sometimes incredibly long times, looking post marketing data safety, data could never gained clinical trials. long term consequences discovered, FDA either forces notifications public (NSAIDs cardiovascular risk) recalls drug (most recently Chantix fir serious contamination production line labs). 

If you’re looking reasons anxious unknown, always unanswered questions. you’re looking actual risks vaccine, they’re clearly outweighed risk COVID-19.  amount caution data going convince die-hard anti-vaxxers nothing FDA ever going good enough conservative talking heads act like reasonable f***ing people. 

Delaying vaccines children vain attempt pander people perverse. 

The trials started March, hadn’t required 6 months follow-up data (unlike 2 months data adults teens) would vaccines school started. FDA requested double trial size. going require 6 months follow-up new study participants authorize vaccine? keeps getting pushed back. 

They need least EUA higher risk kids - pronto. case mRNA vaccines - fragile. two weeks, present body - completely gone. antibodies still there. So, anything going happen, going happen rather quickly.  someone served (but combat), tell many guys mentality ""it'll never happen me,"" surprising would underestimate risks COVID well. See Merek’s antiviral pill antiviral Pfizer making Ah yes, magic age range 20-29 year olds. Keep narrowing goal posts requesting statistics exist completely irrelevant. Wait data coming weeks CDC recommendations people got 1 dose J&amp;J. share opinion. Michigander, isn’t really something sits well me. think uncommon occurrence. Saw patient ED couple nights ago obvious, albeit mild, pneumonia CT, looked like COVID pneumonia too. PCR test done time, negative. Called ED physician seem shocked, said viral load presumably still low figures next day repeat test would come back positive. Even negative test, ED physician planned offer patient Regeneron, said works well. Apparently already administered around 150 doses one patient ended getting sicker treatment everyone else recovered.

I think way back beginning pandemic, Chinese CTs suspected patients even negative PCR results. see looks like COVID related pneumonia CT, make diagnosis even without positive test. What's joke? call person graduates last medical class?

Doctor.

I imagine there's corollary nurses. makes sense, feasible solution worldwide scale owing differing cultures mindsets, well geography. People cultures simply defiant. Geography limit ability military force matter well, certainly snarl logistics rural areas. 

For US particular, you’d probably required take drastic measure instituting communications blackouts resuce widespread coordination, hope little military presence deter rulebreaking, stomach likelihood troops shootouts armed civilians, government actually prompted this. US geography also immense widely varied. US armed forces strong, strong could maintain sufficient presense everywhere would required. 

While concept sound, success really tied solely citizens choosing abide quarantine rules (which would eliminate need force cooperation anyway). don’t unanimous civilian cooperation, trying force mass quarantines Fool’s Errand doomed spectacular failure. That’s disinformation antivaccine crowd. throw everything wall see sticks.

Instead normal humans getting vaccine. given choice job “jab” choose joblessness. 

So basically predicting premeditated outcome design. large groups lose job businesses suffer. Honestly it’s fucked since, again, premeditated outcome. simply get vaccine instead refuse, get bit, blame normal, reasonable people something did. 

Aren’t people great? school system failed greatly. Personally blame Bush. ID doctors agree mean recently recovered? test negative (which test)? Disney even open gong show? ICUs full Disney World open? seems wrong me. article explicitly quotes saying would still need study. need many people. Annual flu vaccine studies, example, use 100s-1000s patients, instead 10,000's like original trials used. Given much know safety efficacy vaccines, makes sense aim try make studies efficient, adapt quickly continuously changing pandemic. 🤏🤏 think wouldn’t vaccine. would ended hospital.

I've gotta rephrase it, apparently automod almost sensitive you. 

Your personal freedom ends starts killing others. 

The division started terrorists started lobbing bomb threats people ***actually*** trying solve problem. 

You zero position speak this. up, takes personal responsibility, keep around safe. triage conversations, *someone* going get lower levels care care all. 

Other questions may discuss are: chances recovery old they?

But even vaccinations matter. vaccinated 50 year old likely recover unvaccinated 40 year old?

It’s sticky question, vaccine status absolutely role play conversation. don’t see issues that. hospitals starting remove people organ recipient list refusing vaccine, that’s fair mom RN (registered nurse) 45 years, 5th pandemic. tired, body falling apart deal anti-vax people coming ER ICU, coughing face shouting hoax can't take anymore, scared. going disability mental health can't treat patients anymore.

My point health issues literally can’t properly wear mask, don’t need pandemic, even vaccine available people proven they’re stupid, obstinate little shit-burglars can’t trusted fucking anything right. idea they’re vaccinated they’ve been. *vaccine  Despite aware troll, law diminishing marginal utility applies think term looking "" greater good"" you.  know what's incvil?

Check automod behavior. Better sun  really surprising hear. good news! “I trying save them!” - guy probably. Israel US stopped poster children while. fell far behind overall vaccinations trouble getting younger people vaccinated we’re getting smarter world getting dangerous alarming.  Great counterargument!  tell child go home beds they’re taken adults could vaccinated chose be?  guess “first come, first serve” truly first commandment society. Followed “you snooze lose”.   correct statement. think prioritisation fair enough (all things considered equal, severity illness, urgency etc, access) However way present argument prioritisation different “they don’t deserve medical attention” comment responded above. people supposed compassionate getting vaccine “save” around us, sure seems like lot people want “opposite side” burn stake ""Chinese citizens exactly.."" uhh seen videos oh people getting dragged house? Welded apartment blocks? People banging pots get attention mom died 2 days ago can't get apartments door locked outside hypothetical is, ICU 1 bed left 20 people waiting ER, factors used determine person gets bed. Assuming longer treating sickest patient first, since 20 equally sick, deciding may likely recover, including vaccination status may play part. There’s lot confused physicists right now… gov track pretty entrenched part American culture. E.g. US national ID, closest Social Security number, groups (e.g. Amish) get near adulthood. Theoretically, family live fully grid, get away all. 

It perfectly OK American culture big corporations track though. love it! Depends health age. got Regeneron treatment moment tested positive, so, hospitalized, still medical treatment ($$$).  UK believe similar temporary approval place. Bruh 3 months? states could pick vax 7/11, shit... they're easy get days. vax sites closing cause enough people going them. 1 week maybe. Rejoice, means higher demand restaurants closer residential areas, options close home. 8 months might give significantly longer protection 5 months. point; everyone testing works.

I’d prefer wait 8 months means stronger longer lasting immunity.   guys handle anti vaxxers say FDA commissioner also board Pfizer getting paid reason got approved teach Phoenix, Arizona. 105. one opening window. fact, outside college classes, never attended worked classroom windows open.

The good parents (usually older) paying attention kids teaching manners, money handling, actually answering billion endless questions visit rarely one two.  could care less. personal choice. understand get it, still outright reject someone fucking vaccine. Calm down.

I get flu vaccine year, hope get rejected! Comirnaty. It’s name we’ll know soon.

But since ICU beds (or bed general even) aren’t covid cases, it’s fair rational people given priority chose get vaccinated.

Yes vaccines help prevent people ending ICU, otherwise hospitals would start getting overwhelmed even saw vaccines. everyone decided get vaccinated, would collapse system there’s simply enough doctors, hospitals deal many cases once. 

So getting vaccinated, lowers chances needing hospitalised, thereby overall lowers amount people ending hospital, benefit you, everyone hospitals. mention also definitely helps stubborn emotionally stunted grown ass adults still refuse vaccinated.

Marlee says thank :) vaccine ***is*** safe effective though, I'm sure point is. see logic comes from, actual numbers showing that. also surprised way around effective vaccine That’s exactly fair anyone wants vaccine get one. Ehhh might want look UK start spewing nonsense.

You obviously even actually looked statistics coming vaxxed countries. might explain lot responses. 

I'll give statistic prove wrong are. current number cases, UK would seen 1500 deaths day Alpha wave, far 100 day. tell 'scarcely' changed no-vax Alpha vax Delta? 100 number includes non-vaxxed even.

T-cells see variants much better antibodies stick around much longer. OP's idea deliberately getting sick terrible idea though. 1930 anymore, kid.  works. People aren’t taking it. Also, people get hospitalized reasons covid.

Of course overlap unvaccinated gotten infected talking realistically less 20% population either gotten infected vaccinated. Fully acknowledgement would one people telling overreaction point (granted, ridiculing you, expressing disagreement) 

I following closely curiosity (and also travel plans China 2020) certainly believed dangerous disease, believe going get far last long. 

I think biggest mistake thinking this: fully convinced would good detecting showed up. might face small yet tragic outbreak, would good contact tracing, quarantining areas outbreaks, etc. keep numbers low enough changing weather could eliminate virus entirely. 

At point, expected realm possibility could outbreak American city similar original SARS virus Toronto 2003. even like ""it could happen put money it."" believed possibility 'a sad thing see news' something would affect people's day day lives. Basically expected similar order magnitude first SARS epidemic. 

I absolutely expect something would affect every single one us personally. absolutely right concerned. next phase going explosion fake vaccine cards. already seeing college students. unvaccinated think covid real mingle like people

This. People still unvaccinated almost certainly socializing people aren't, meaning chance eventually one get infected spread even measured percentage. foregone conclusion thanks Delta. man Westchester?

I remember first case suspected community spread one day, next day family neighbors tested positive, several tristate next day, confirmed community transmission, week later thousands people flooding hospitals NYC greater metro area.

It hit damned fast.  live Alabama? people city back office go fun, wear masks public indoor spaces. I’d say good 80-90% mask indoors, people still wear outdoors too. happened unless people stupid mask get vaccinated ""We need kids back school cost!"" Cool, wear mask. ""No!!"" agree, context could come way.


What meant delta variety infected, still could passed along. 


You absolutely correct vaccination decreases chance infected. Even delta variety per latest CDC guidelines. window doesn’t matter think equivalent not, opinions aren’t allowed content here. She’s justifying decision made. Yea, lots regional variation. weird see comments masks distancing since live back normal since April. think everyone realizes many places stopped worrying ago. aside [not doctors actually take Yes contains important principles medicine generally, necessarily adhered literally. ones care do. much govenor population selfish idiots here. got vaxxed soon could, haven’t (thank goodness weed video games) mask every single time I’m outside. sure happened Come WA then. income tax rate attractive, lot less stupid people (on West side state least).  actually believe simply possible meet safely many school buildings. Packing kids cant get vaccinated cant wear masks correctly tiny room poor air circulation 100 degree heat recipe disaster. Yes, collectively country failed accomplish that. Blame neighbors  still think 'just flu'. Since flu vaccine mandated, guess understand covid would mandated.    long since second dose?  remember “we” yes. also distinctly remember experts saying would least two year ordeal. hope different vanished sometime April ‘20. Learning live COVID means learning live regular vaccinations, fix hospital capacity issue. think mostly due early days pandemic CDC knowing much virus now. It’s easy say “why didn’t recommend masks?!”, still didn’t know main cause transfer. used think touch too. time, numbers spread far less, due us waiting results around country. recommendation masks weren’t necessary based low numbers along Essential workers demand masks. moment scientists across country realized air, CDC recommended masks. recommendation combined high numbers sudden pouring in, led mask mandates. 

All isn’t meant talk down, want us focus response happened way did. Also, general misinformation multiple parties early days didn’t help either feel like happened, sales fake vaccine cards increase.     hope since people got small taste “universal” healthcare via cost-sharing COVID, *maybe* people finally realize messed health insurance otherwise.  hit end alphabet, what's next, naming like hurricanes? always, angriest people *reason* still problem. It’s like they’re protesting firefighters, angry fire still raging control. people didn’t hold end deal.

num nums gonna num... Yeppers.. Texas native whole lot stupid days., figured saw Florida moving per capita deaths rankings 1-5 listed death every day  something cherish gone, also something mindful of. Ugh, that’s bummer. friend got 5 year old enrolled calling around, willing drive hours, since lives small town anyway. Vaccines help reduce transmission rate well. Absolutely still carry vaccinated immune system actively fighting off, keeping potential expose others higher viral load per droplet vaccinated.

What saying literally fact, bullshit. well established best protection cannot get vaccinated achieve herd immunity protect physically cannot get vaccinated. antigen at-home test's (like BinaxNOW) sensitivity increase duplications done time? ie getting 3 negatives informative 1 negative result? Fine examples! Drunk driving, crashes without seat belts, STD spread via without protection, people irresponsible flu, etc. 

As war comment; exactly mindset Japanese, Germans, Soviets prisoner war camps. uncompromising mindset dehumanises people. Fair treatment all, even enemies, even battlefield.

And question begins spring mind; reason question receives uncompromising mindset politically motivated? Antivaxers deemed enemy...? deemed Republican? What's difference reddit... 

In UK BAME community sadly biggest antivax problem. wonder arguments would exist Republican edge it?  Well, based knew time advice wear masks probably made sense.

They know asymptomatic spread, easily virus could spread airborne. told us mask up.

I also suspect initially trying go easy knew would resistance measures stop spread, want advise/mandate anything unless certain. Partially political pressure, partially avoid immunologists/health experts cried wolf never listened again. even year data yet.

This untrue. data clinical trials. even 1 link separation.

This solved public masking masking places children might be. stifled 45, statements knowingly false, never gave up, speaks truth subtle allow unvaccinated catch up, need led like batch chicken, good him. Pretty… prettyy … prettaayy good control That's stated top comment though.... Turd time charm! Long-term six months. OK getting myself. Other's understand that. Fuck u thoughts 2 months covid going 5 year thing. things started “ normalizing summer, couldn’t believe happening thought good true. lol. dude survive ice storm i’m sure survive this.

I live oklahoma . Sigh...so *lost* another year num nums...  understand it’s 93% IT’S STILL SUMMER, right? Looks like Utah slightly US Average according NYT. 18+ US 73% one dose, 63% full vaccinated. Utah 71% one dose, 61% fully vaccinated.

So bad, great either. Wow lot sickness. hung quite you. second vaccine March 25 kind along timeline. I’m leery right now. started ordering groceries online. Don’t want take chances. yes I’m sure wonder outcome would’ve without vaccine. I’m glad didn’t hospitalized.  They’re surrounded teachers friends, lots good options hand-holders cases! kids scared shots. enough data delta. talking data like year ago. seeing huge increases pediatric cases.    forced vaccine good? 

Yes.

Government regulates mandates things time people want benefit. Car insurance, primary education, etc.

Vaccination different except there's bunch anti-vaccine crazies would rather take horse dewormer idiocy treated kids gloves long. anything technically approved fast, even year data yet.

But think made unprecedented number doses delivered. get second shot? Nothing like hearing people warned January say June “No one; even trump could see coming” really fam? Cause drunk ass Queensland gives finger delta May/June. Also article linked dated July 20. Well get vaccinated people!  Biden administration froze scientists said Biden’s vaccine approach bad idea. look what’s happened. Gee whiz, isn’t people voted all. ALRIGHT I'll let go 30+ year hate Tigers beat Padres World Series. Health officials really need start clear transparent targets they’re going reintroduce mask requirements. worsen trust health bodies lower compliance exit strategy “get vaccinated” doesn’t end resulting normalcy.

COVID isn’t going away, what’s end goal here? People won’t accept types mandates indefinitely.  isn’t case average office worker? made lot points I’m sure one you’re addressing. achieving things difficult, yes, *if were* achieved much likely happen personal interaction coworkers happen whatever firm work for. simply facilitates ability advocate higher wages, less hours, paid maternity leave, etc

Now order must converse actual projects isn’t enjoyable way meet somebody. Water cooler chats feel extremely superficial, similar “get together zoom calls” everyone seemed beginning pandemic. Nobody going randomly run someone overhear conversation. important things we, social creatures, function best with. Putting already anti-social 20 year olds environment entire life could undoubtedly lead negative impacts. makes sense, biggest two complaints online work missing social components teamwork inability collaborate fly. couldn’t care less “productivity”, think significantly improve life workers whatever expense productivity. believe problems permanent remote work outweigh positives. no, wrongsay, downvote! HAHA! Fuck Ron Desantis! like it, right.

Suppose town 1,150 people, 300 go one church 250 go another church priest/pastor/reverend/etc. preaches Covid tests devil's work, government stick swab nose commit sin.

Further, suppose 550 people friends another 200 people convince position.

Now 70% people willing get tested think life imminent danger, - want get tested merely potential exposure. Sure enough, positivity rate going *way* higher. mean pre holidays would better post holidays. Also late fall weddings attend. Isreal got mostly vaccinated still problems.  USAso behind, can't see believes this. People disturbingly cruel sub. Lol barely better people taking horse dewormer attitude.

Wait research. experts know shit convinced yet.

Don't ever say ""listen science"" please, science yet tell us vaccines safe young children yet convinced know better. another ""dO ReSeArCh"" person right now. Nailed Sad. hope get vaccines soon. nation almost everyone masks, goes show hard get virus control. probably help almost everyone uses public transportation there.  statement says ultimatly us (the CDC) really setting bar all

Ngl handled messaging everything terribly. first masks, needed masks, needed two masks, ok vaccinated people go unmasked, ok vaccinated go without masks, first told reach certain threshold restrictions could end, told maybe possibly restrictions might end CDC decides. never got dogpiled Reddit repeatedly telling people, summer 2020, every data point shows past coronavirus outbreaks, SARS, maximum immunity year 2 Covid-19 going humanity forever, even vaccine came out, also would require new vaccines doses every year so.

That year ago, government still completely honest reality situation. Yeah feel like getting pre holidays public benefit waiting another month two. doubt supply constrained last time given ton doses available now, booster dose moderna may smaller, everyone currently vaccinated want booster.   saw writing wall. Sorry people ridiculed you. deserve that. I've learned throughout pandy people saying ""denial one hell drug"" awfully true.

Besides which, chronic conditions strain systems speed extremeness COVID does. obese, smokers, etc., simply put people severe risk room left treat like unvaccinated COVID patients do. slippery slope circumstances make two entirely different questions.

Nevertheless, doctors always going know reason someone unvaccinated certain (for actual valid reasons!) right point deciding prioritize, think difficult people seem think factor decisions anyway. think bigger issue going insurers start unwilling pay for--smokers particular already get higher costs, see largely going direction ""unvaccinated nothing personal choice"".

This get making comprehensive preventative health care national priority long time ago, instead something occasionally pay lip service to. (I say feels like US *loves* brag high tech ways find treat extreme medical issues, ignoring efforts solutions unsexy chronic problems making people sick, like poverty, mental health, exercise, access quality food knowing make part routine ... etc.) Would paid $100 get vaccine 6 months earlier did? Probably. I'm arguing it, unfortunately gives uncrediable sources information, grounds spew shit. Kinda like can't nice things. Could've reached clothing manufacturers coordinate product push

This Defense Production Act requires executive action coordinate. CDC authority. Trump refused use first several months pandemic, option. 

Biden invoke Defense Production Act finally got office, also used military vaccine distribution.  case, could gone virtual  first months school year? know kids need get back school never option?   China knows enforce quarantine least could, said immunocompromised. want play rules, wait hit 8 month mark. Same, I'm going Maui September. trip booked long time. I'm vaccinated, always wear mask, cautious. We're getting Australian covid sub they're constantly new reddit accounts identical posting histories slightly rearranged propaganda phrases like that. obvious sockpuppeting campaign, weeks constantly spamming even getting downvoted, regulars starting echo starting upvote other. scary well constant propaganda works. created illusion great idea repeating resistance wore out. clip works. Maybe previous one regional restrictions... cause YouTube. :/  Stop making shit political. Dr. Fauci trying help Democrats Republicans get re-elected. He's trying keep Americans alive. regardless. hospitals fill up, that's major socio-economic issue. people dying. people bunker again. economy slow again. 

If hospitals fill area, know even want get car drive work. want end accident treated hallway waiting room staff burned out. that's pretty similar gonna district then. Pick person remote, pick able switch end semester around January.

Of course we've benefit able see shitshow unfold month make decision. Oh believe me, know. IC mother got tested today get results \*\*Thursday\*\* site pickup 2x day testing.

Mumps still goes around tear communities pretty quickly. honesty Delta major presence Los Angeles mid-July county re-issued indoor mask mandate. study covers couple weeks Delta surge. NJ's week-to-week data probably accurate. Yesterday's Governor's data summary showed 1.8% who're fully vaxxed wind hospital, versus 9.4% who're un-vaxxed partially.  sing happy birthday party?  Canadian, specific US CDC, impression lack willingness speculate ahead, even cautiously. understand. Specifically wrt masks official messaging early seemed ""We direct evidence masks *will* help preventing Covid spread, remote possibility *might* cause harm, recommend *against* widepsread public use makeshift masks.""

Which technically correct, *mountains* evidence masks work well source control (outward transmission) wide vairiety pathogens, evidence even poorly made makeshift masks significantly reduce *amount* pathogen spread area contaminated, although speculation masks *could* correlated bacterial contamination, perhaps poor mask handling *might* correlated increased exposure, evidence it. guess cautious wrong way.

During early stages Covid crisis, whole bunch unknowns, seemed completely unwilling play odds, even ample non-Covid specific evidence (say case masks).

Here Canada, believe finally figured early stages vaccination. Public Health Canada came recomendations allowing mixing matching vaccines, pushing back second doses first doses offered everyone, breaking established protocols original trials. unproven time, first doses reasonably effective (pre Delta), everyone single dosed would better half people double dosed reducing overall spread. time criticism amounted big experiment Canadian people, was. Yet experiment seems paid off, evidence emerging mixing vaccines doses spaced undermine efficacy. vaccines behaved wasy past, seemed safe bet.

The whole early stage pandemic, declaration pandemic, optimistic. We've dealt before, SARS MERS. Contact tracing, quarantine isolation, stop *before* gets hand (q.v. New Zeaand). becamse obvious time going play different. Lol Reddit see people arguing first amendment... certainly bringing average intelligence country. I’m one breakthrough cases. hate raincloud here, antibody titer COVID wanes roughly 6 months. natural infection vaccine. We're going get pushed booster 8 months second shot, starting September.

Why short immune response? could actually get PhD trying understand it. 

Some vaccinations last life (MMR, polio, smallpox, etc) last decade (TDAP), SARS COVID produce immune response lasts less year. 

Add new variants we're terrible job identifying tracking, we're long haul. 

18,300 Americans died past month, we're busy arguing whether need wear masks. collective heads buried deep sand right now. ""if"" lot heavy lifting sentence... I'll admit read article. 

But many people need get vaccinated, get control?  statistics agree perspective. school district sent masks mandatory email. fence sending son, kindergarten year, think moved us fence. We're still scared pretty poorly last year home instead preschool, point benefits seem outweigh risk. Ugh, parent 12 kids sucks right now. That's fine; time buy keep hospitals unburdened wait better treatments/antivirals, better. 

We may always periods mask common good; that's way now. sense laying red carpet mitigations help deal surges. really nasty kids say that... highly infectious airborne respiratory pathogens beyond practical ability control?

I'm sorry intervention *only works* innoculate every eligible person planet (some will), mention animal reservoirs may harbor virus within 14 days allow mutations that's useless intervention seen estimates % looks like *with* masking? 

Just desperate parent hoping school’s mask mandate help keep little one safe. What's scary want government punish them. many steps away gulags? Santa Barbara county one think  Again, let sign waiver then. least much data adults. Expanding additional 4 months bureaucrat overly cautious. 

If think pediatricians aren’t going start using label, you’re wrong. Better grant EUA scientifically tested dosage numbers kids doctors start giving using educated guesses dosages.  Around 70% eligible people vaccinated.

Additionally, fraction total population least one dose gone 3% (from 58.5% 61.5%) last three weeks. slow, making progress.  I’m hard time believing lol assume blood disease virus vaccine like HepB works like respiratory virus vaccine. There's lots non-respiratory vaccines work effectively despite much less immunogenic COVID mRNA vaccines.

If looks studies lot blood virus diseases seropositive alone confers immunity. Respiratory virus diseases seemingly require quantitative measures correlate immunity.

I think better analogy would RSV, get hit hard first time (often children/infants) repeat future infection much minor we're repeatedly exposed life. Yeah live northeast, 90% older adults vaccinated I'm somewhat conservative town still got vaxed read thought: gang gets control pandemic. need try optimism. know things seem bad bad people can't fix it. part enjoy life least let enjoy it. soooo much positive about! Try making list things make happy. going take big employers threaten termination vaccinating. enough push ""on fence"" people get shot. we? government official elected leader?  wrong application knowledge suggested son law would reduced chance transmission vaccinated. 

You're either extremely obtuse arguing bad faith.  stupid cool you? Got it. frustrating, especially timing return school. close schools 2020 keeping kids healthy priority? asked drive kids last school year others could social distance school buses? wanted make big deal 18 months we're going drag feet? cases state time last year, yet we're supposed pretend like everything normal, virtual schooling option, send kids hope best?

Every parent feel completely jerked around right now. Fair point. feels validating know there's others boat, emotionally in. son born January 7th first covid article read day. famed Dr silenced, can't remember name ended passing. Face, meet floor high velocity. Here's interesting time capsule confusion early April 2020: allow fans instead natural immunity make Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J money....therefore counted towards ""herd immunity"" right though large portion unvaccinated people US covid natural immunity/antibodies. timeline may look little less bleak people counted. reading comprehension much? people prone clotting advised take AZ. doctor? getting offended choose take vaccine that's safer them? Get high horse realise people different situations choose vaccine best them.

And bet US AZ vaccine even available always Americans first complain people choose vaccine AZ. first push people take AZ even though options available. 

Making choice different types vaccine anti-vax people like got stop treating equally. Ask doctors. America now, see general practitioner, get physical, let tell you. listen internet. Man sounds awesome! I’m arizona good day maybe 40% would masked store. Maybe! Realistically probably 10-25% time. miserable high school. dropped got GED year half would graduated. Still happy decision 12 years later. think issue vaccines essentially 100% effective. Nobody gets Polio, Rubella etc here. 

These vaccines diminishing effectiveness (and pretty quickly) akin see seasonal flu variants/vaccines. Like said she’s elderly autoimmune disorder, we’re worried didn’t fact mount good immune response first two doses (especially since she’s type person almost get hospitalized reaction flu vaccines symptoms COVID vaccine). + upcoming dose steroids humira could deadly. say that? 50% population already fully vaccinated. increase time. Case Fatality Fate delta well 1%. It’s unlikely hundred thousand Florida residents die COVID end pandemic. That’s huge (potential) tragedy, isn’t existential threat state. 

Whether functioning ICU system whole question. expect doctor nurse burnout going increase time.  So, cause fda approved, is??? Where's common sense hmm yeah coincidence like 5 companies able “invent” mRNA vaccines time. Like trolling 2 weeks bend curve! Thank you, really appreciate that.

Your question likely rhetorical, genuinely curious, think important include compassion every conversation.

By using compassion, turn argument discussion. so, use ""bridge"" technique. find are, create bridge position yours, help across chasm. thing Netherlands, ""testing entry"" work. Imagine born 2003-2009.

You'll lost high school experience thing. Now, adults know high school sucks, nobody deny incredibly formative person's long term psyche.

I fear long term mental health everyone, especially kids. Someone extended family refused get vaccinated got sick covid saying thought going die, etc. antivax daughter's response dismiss mom's suffering... got covid months later made exact complaints mom. socialization need vaccinated pod friends family. mean could put charge things start leading prognosticating. Holly fuck threads bring dumb swiftness.  going go away warms up. completely wrong. Unvaccinated people make 99% hospitalizations. 

I live relatively high vaxxed state. Everything fine. Case numbers up, hospitalizations flat. think there’s hospital crisis South?   Yea, work Industries/jobs, many I'd does. 

Maybe telepresence robots could fix industries. (Obviously all)

Although I'd love next meal prepared robot remote controlled authentic Japanese sushi chef living Japan. - much authentic could get? (Besides using local japanese ingredients) “rest world” part important. can’t keep putting boosters close borders forever. temporary mitigation. priority get world get vaccinated least one shot ASAP. hope countries collaborate work war like priority. One variant drag another 5 years. hope attention shifts anti-vaxers poor countries soon.  Hopefully she'll get vaccinated soon.    love quote much real question rank currently vaccinated entirely legit reasons (allergy, immunocompromised) vs antivaxxers. Thankfully American partner able fly 2 times since whole shitshow started, seen family since January 2020 now... 

I missed funeral, birth sisters twins can't wait see (and year old already...), thanksgiving christmas far.

Having spend Thanksgiving Christmas completely alone something want again. Situation different am, lot families concerned kids schools. Masks stay (in fact mandated again)

Also even vaccinated, chances covid causing serious sickness definetly much higher 0.001% stated. make numbers. It’s also Florida, one worst places country right games governor’s playing. Imagine breakthrough case thinking, ""Gee, sure wish vaccinated, I'd much prefer suffering more.""   Spring 2022… two years started idiots trust Facebook posts scientists It’s Florida, it’s certainly Delta. Fortunately symptoms worse head cold far. Rybolt added least one Iraan resident airlifted out-of-state care lack available ICU beds Texas. said: ""It could 12 hours (for coronavirus-stricken people receive bed). could 36 hours. never know long going take.""

That's pretty scary. People get covid sometimes get worse quickly. Traveling sick Iraan-Sheffield Independent School District Superintendent Tracy Canter said public statement school district shut five days classes one quarter staff 16% students either infected exposed coronavirus.

That lightning fast completely predictable governor Abbott seen coming. probably happening towns too, happen school postponed – virtual classes – Aug. 30, city council buildings closed, high school football, town's lynchpin, hold. 

Texas loves high school football, disappointment them. friend works pediatric ICU says beds getting filled unvaccinated adults. grown ass people taking beds away small children able get vaccinated yet. applies COVID, it'll get applied everything else, unfortunately.  Yes.

And fact, hospitals keeping number beds available non-COVID patients, even means willfully unvaccinated sick COVID patients get care. fair heart attacks, appendicitis, cancer, emergent illnesses/injuries suffer resources used idiots. think big cities multiple hospitals one hospital COVID-free, order handle normal emergencies caseloads. Smaller cities rural areas percentage capacity reserved non-COVID patients. This. Covid stay countries great containment see spread “novel” considerably longer countries.  Yeah, watch apologists come people say HEY FATTY GO BACK LINE disease, control! etc. etc.

Few willing see slippery slope here. Triage completely different trying pretend thing ridiculous.

Doctors help based need worthiness. Otherwise replay ER episode drug-dealing gunshot victim say... yep, Dr. made right choice there. kids can’t vaccinated yet moron. 

And don’t @ sErIoUs kIdS - I’m done talking idiots like you. Antivaxxers different people beat kids. delta variant contagious is, surprise sadly. Thank you, means lot what’s point vaccines use reduce symptoms we’re still getting worse variants deadlier symptoms anyways? correct? often discussed r/covid19. know actual scientists. suggest digging declaring fully understand issue hand.    Unequitable care NO, higher insurance premiums YES. Unvaccinated higher risk. Attach risk health insurance possibly life insurance. Ether exemption coverage, higher premium copay. Can’t get covid you’re dead Glad wasn’t one read like “what?”

Or 

“Twenty-two teachers one school Covid exposure” sick might well stay home take chances

No. dangerous message one healthcare pushing year now. Delaying care needed happens regularly, happened often since covid, serious consequences.

Thank do. would thought number serious cases amongst vaccinated would low conversation would pointless. Well, blame want. way allows avoid considering quarter people given country actually evil. nice thing blaming them, blaming people end point, means find solution. way means naturally move past punishment towards finding way fix problem, obviously things good now, maybe changing specific things, improved.

Anyway, fine want things way. church threw lot Republican party accept consequences decision since party overrun conspiracy theorists..  Mild clinical sense felt terrible. Chills, loss senses, fatigue, body aches, headaches, congestion, coughing…not fun all. Blood O2 went low 91 couple days. I'm impression healthcare workers strike face possibility licenses revoked, means can't work field again. go school Florida schools AC except 1 new wing prayed classes Well time. fact useless. many ppl crying ""they lied usssss"". Well fuck ofc, shortage toilet paper hoarders. Imagine CDC told people yea use masks isnt nearly enough even 20% population. health care workers treating people needed masks, essential staff. Masks useless 20% population wear them. Especially n95s, need fit tested. whole rhetoric needs die. Yes dumb lay people need lied to.  Unvaxxed think possibly endanger others getting vaccinated complain endangered others way. Classic “centre universe” complex This. People crazy. sub Reddit America focused. many countries world don’t access vaccine. Nobody wishing death rationing care based vaccination status. 

All people don’t understand worms years progress prevent thing insurance companies. Remember lifetime max? do. 

What’s next - don’t help people HIV bodily fluid contact? Don’t help flu patients didn’t get vaccine? 

All sentiments vaccine mandates going adverse effect slow vaccination. saw yesterday - ani vaxx like toddlers telling know giving ability dig feet in. Mother law came low fever yesterday, got Covid test. came back negative assumes flu. 

I personally find hard believe spreading flu preventative social distancing masking we’re prevent Covid. 

Is possible test wrong? rapid test got. Go polish gun. also means shouldn’t blamed whole problem part it.

I’m implying problem.

I’m emphasizing primary reasons many people, including kids, sacrificed year life. don’t seem feel obligation return favor. certain areas Deep South massive vaccination resistance drag national average down, like it’s now. asymptomatic. That's challenge. impossible. vaccination really good preventing serious cases pretty good preventing transmission. 
Contagiousness isn’t binary on/off switch. Even kids spread vaccinated adults it’s much lower rate unvaccinated. Spanish Flu infectious, killed people lot faster. could fine Monday night dead Tuesday morning, spreading virus around long. COVID nice long incubation period spread around DAYS knowing sick. said burn down, whole concept unsustainable, forget competition  I'll mostly kids get vaccinated.  incredibly cautious responsible seems like people really dedicated getting covid. guess family protected, do?

I still worry hospitals able care non-covid emergency patients though. Remember. bad nature care expected. accounts US though. fair, ramping testing especially bad summer. yeah lot cases missed. Sweden test lot, done much mitigate early on. unknown rate far lower us. Yeah maybe. Delta nasty enough unvaxxed everywhere (even liberal states) cause problems short periods time. vaccine protects 100% although vaccinated rarely get bad Covid-19 end hospital possible, non-vaxxed filling hospitals brim I'm sure it'll right October 1. Pfizer said they're submitting EUA ""late September"" FDA said they'd make review high priority. time early October reasonable bet, might October 1. People always like this, unfortunately. Look popular “natural” “holistic” medicines - people want think know something masses don’t.  cruise industry dead. California law making crime knowingly transmit HIV repealed driving testing rates STIs. idea person know positive passed HIV another charged fewer risk people getting tested. tricky situation India basically went herd immune.  “Delta ravaging population”. Honestly man, keep up. couple posts back.  Yes, minimum reap sow set tent parking lot kiosk internet access supply horse dewormer let unvaccinated people figure treat themselves. know better doctors anyway I'm merely discussing principle matter vaccinated flooding hospital though. even then, scenario they'd one better prognosis. Mandates already rolling out. news morning.  Wrong assumption, live Russia Sputnik V made government. point I've stated permanent measures applied.
 
Given full FDA approval one vaccine 16 years age older came week - likely approvals similar vaccines near future come well - steps make permanent certain standards, especially relates services involving public accommodation, begin earnest. I'll take you, then. wanna go back home. [Summer

""In part, that’s whole idea comes caveat size of, well, Texas.

End of. truly fucked system everyone saved nasty prioritisation based liklihood treatment net beneficial, effectively save bother can't save, make comfortable... pray never end situation like that. takes true failing levels rich nation end situation. Pfizer got approved, fuck mandates roll out? impatient, someone needed vaccinations still work mask probably Oct. wedding fucking mask mandate (heaven forbid Chicago's leadership vax mandate) correct. main thing shows testing way people accurately determine prevalence. Lemme drop bars.. I’ll keep us warm 🔥 🔥 Lol sad getting voted cuz super depressing, comment wrong. you’ve moved NYC, may notice much emptier city is, even August. required vaccine mandate new, I’m sure consider new measure. I’m sure happening WFH, companies pushing back September openings January later. Different situation, remember middle school school district added new vaccine requirements. offered free school make easier families. Covid whole issue, It’s like it’s *never* done before.  Also note April. assumption back 2 doses would effectively prevent infection. changed delta waning immunity. late February, 2020 right Wahn, initial outbreak, said Twitter 4-7 million people would die pandemic --same thing

4.4 million already dead ain't long shot.

Holy crap see one coming /s I'd take step say hospitals kick unvaccinated covid patients *out* beds favor anyone else. Part triage identifying best chance survival focusing limited resources them. That’s even covid vaxx thing, it’s emergency medicine works.  also litmus reduces number people worst careless selfish type care many infect. Texas hospitalization rate unvaccinated .2% unvaccinated overwhelming hospitals brink. Thats one example unvaccinated making hospitals staff buckle pressure.

How medical professional went school, learned viruses ad vaccines; witness flood death devastation daily still everyone getting vaccine? 

This like soldiers active war zone protesting mandatory body armor. frustrating part whole ordeal complete lack metric strive achieve. 

We bother taking account previously infected / naturally immune. 70% adult US population one vaccine shot, CDC roughly estimates 120m Americans infected. herd immunity = vaccinated + naturally immune? county \~58% fully vaccinated people 12+ 78% full vaccinated 65+. 18 confirmed cases per 1000 students already. knows many infected home quarantined exposure, tested yet.

Nearby, Fort Bend County (also Houston-area) 7 cases per 1000 they're 70% fully vaccinated 12+. thought could get without masks mandates today, clearly that's case. 12 course can't vaccinated, may big source infections. That's fair. lot people, seems, think they're better people say things sort annoying. performative. 

I mean, I've already Delta. I'm mid-twenties whole work career turned around twice. career wanted ripped I'm one really like. Meanwhile, social life eroded. 

It's fair, right, number us continue living restrictions place big toll mental healthy economic well-being. 

Like said, socialize safely, avoid contact unvaxed people elders. point time accept endemic move such?

The Spanish Flu waves 1920s, time, people moved on. Im vaccinated wear mask it’s needed I’ve also basically normal summer. I’ve vacation. I’ve beach. 4th July party. Baseball games. Hung friends family. 

Life basically back normal vast majority people. I’m saying shouldn’t it’s truth  There's difference can't get vaccinated. New Zealand-like approach can't done interstate travel federal obligation. Per state leadership, 2020 version Safe Travels system (14 day quarantine proof negative test) back unless CDC revises guidance back negative tests all, including vaxxed individuals.

Additionally, Hawaii propped tourism hospitality kinda need *some* level tourism, since fairly cheap travelers shorter options opposed pre-pandemic summer, everyone's going Hawaii state getting slammed transcripts going ask sub five seconds? Yup bounce back forth different causes existential dread... pandemic invariably, undoubtedly virus keeps giving form new exciting variants, increasing certainty entire planet burn wiped floods next decade two. many things bring extinction. little time contemplate them. point is, wrong that. certain age group - country operated things ""back normal"" summer. whole store got flu. feel bad state health director. seems like pretty reasonable dude. governor making announcement. 

I can't imagine policy enforced MS cops. We've seen kinds people, disabled people severe allergies conditions between, get vaccinated. doctor right mind tell get vaccinated there's much data proving good harm matter condition.  Na

Vaccinated + unvaccinated real medical reasons willingly unvaccinated. sorry hear ❤️ statistics consider important?

I’m looking stats % hospitalizations children.

I hearing lot “if haven’t vaccinated, deserve catch covid” “if you’ve vaccinated, don’t worry anything” even sub. seems totally overlook child cases I’m curious much hospitalizations children- would expect number rising. Look, concerning, title completely misleading.

50 119 *tests* came back positive. test people randomly - people got tested thought might Covid.

What know 4.3% people Iraan tested positive. that's *lot*, unto itself. Making notion half town Covid unnecessary, misleading. One former coworkers Indy 5 school age grandchildren age 12.

School session little week 5 covid. Vaccines reduce spread though, still possible spread mean likelihood. Logically vaccines help fight infection quicker, prevent getting altogether, would definitely cut spread lot fair, zeppelins pretty safe. Thousands trips people without incident, Hindenburg happened film particularly histrionic radio personality broadcasting killed industry. 97 crew passengers, 62 survived. Much better odds surviving nearly plane crash. industry allowed add couple straightforward safety measures, kind accident would prevented happening again.

Also, might still using hydrogen zeppelins high altitude balloons today instead wasting Helium. point, mandates going way bring rest populous around. guess person living US kinda does, sadly 😅 CDC published data event Barnstable county showing significant spread even though majority attendees vaccinated. Anti-vaxxers latched onto ""proof"" vaccine nothing stop spread. fail account actual event party gay dudes lots indiscriminate sex. course lot spreading.

Overall, someone vaccinated infected may likely spread disease someone unvaccinated infected... odds getting infected much lower vaccinated. (Infection defined testing positive Covid, versus diseased defined actually developing symptoms) might assume worship altar capitalism. Fine. vaccines developed manufactured corporations. Feel better now? Go get vaccinated save you, loved ones, society pile pain expense. Kids young rarely develop serious illness. I’ve got two kids 4 I’ve got tons friends young kids. Quite gotten covid, Delta. single one got anything worse regular cold. don’t alter lives time prevent kids getting cold, makes sense covid. someone explain “focus therapeutics” crap comes from? avoiding v-word, calling shots “preemptive therapeutics”?   That's horrible - I'm sorry deal that. coping? Hawaii state island though....

I mean Canada Maritimes prevented non-essential travel, besides PEI Labrador, share land border  makes want scream heavens frustration. can't imagine must going through. 

My mother vaccinated. long standing fear/hatred kind medical anything, specific vaccine. Runs family. grandmother died treatable heart condition insisted need go doctor.

I'm living relative. I've told visit gets vaccinated. I'm less convinced see again. You’re right mark. virus slim chances mutate significantly it’s getting attacked immune system moment enters body. unvaccinated people much likely contribute variants vaccinated people. expect breakthrough infections keep hospitals busy death rates years

Breakthrough infections currently future keeping hospitals busy. Doctors frustrated literally walking hospitals nearly patients unvaccinated.  fully vaccinated Covid 99.999% likely minor inconvenience

This totally wishful thinking. data around delta variant support all. TIL Regeneron drive-thru's thing.

Also, wow Florida really God's waiting room isin't it? anti-vax would see “next evolution” conspiracy designed stomp refused take shadow org toxin make second world citizens, stripping rights, etc eventual genocide. UK much vaccinated. society 100% vaccinated deaths hospitalizations would vaccinated. Plus vaccinated oldest vulnerable first. CDC say there's restrictions that! Talk doctor, imagine would likely able take roughly simultaneously. frustrating. covid nov curious, talked about. I'm seeing vaccine breakthroughs reports it, silence reinfections. 

Sucks caught previous infection vaccine. literally safest still got it.. Yup don’t think states allowed that. end putting one on. Didn’t seem happy it, though. think main reason even requiring 12-17 group Bahamas regulation guests 12 vaccinated cruise ship can’t stop there. Without new rule I’m sure cruise lines would’ve required vaccines minors all. Hold up. suggesting something unvaccinated people causing surge overwhelming hospitals? Yes. already triage people based risk time limited resources (ie organ transplant). Vaccinated people likely survive unvaccinated. resources become limited, shouldn’t even debate. Vaccinated people take priority. Well he’s definitely gonna catch it. Hope doesn’t spread rest us.  I'm concerned one closest cousins, teaches 1st grade. School started today. immediate family pretty much extended family vaccinated. can't vouch select few, however. I'm Michigan.  although known cases people asymptomatic infections, think we've found cases transmission asymptomatic people. love attitude, that’s true. legit excuses get vaccine.  norovirus once. wouldn’t wish upon anybody.  Remember two weeks slow spread?  *”It approved”*

Ding ding ding, think identified new excuse! doctor tells get vaccinated, find new doctor asap.

Absolutely despicable. many doctors, yes, lot nurses ancilliary staff.

Yeah right, claim Remind talked future long term strategies. 

But past: everyone NZ would possibly pandemic already. Instead fucked us (delta). please point source NZ long term strategy is. stupid strategy I'll first condemn it. That's saying want blood extra steps gotten one Janssen en Janssen, Dutch vaccine.

Best wishes friend, sounds like they'll need em. mortality rate 50-97% covid patients put mechanical ventilators Yes , ago ( feels like close year). believe Governor blocked information like daily new cases ( weekly updates ) , death counties can’t release daily death tolls either. do. 😏 may feel way, definitely options. know number people (5) died many ill, didn’t need deaths tell need vaccine health. take evidence vaccine work.

They see headline hospital full vaccinated people dieing due vaccine make vaccine look better going kill unvaccinated. community = communism! policy sounds like extremely effective discouraging testing. fact that’s obvious likely side effect wonder real intent! Zero covid impossible arrest data scientist trying release information blocked? constitution release data that's imperative public health/Safety. Yup. Beds ain't problem anymore. always intended zero covid goal would end vaccine rates allow it. 

I hope so. sub however realize everyone still fangirling whole think vaccination rates 90% reasonable given seriously people take 

That's dead last among OECD members assume.  based doctors &lt;3 Claim kr misdoubt information. u/Citronella made claim provided evidence. safe Redditors. limit even avoid consequences simply getting vaccinated. made calculation wouldn’t happen her.

Yeah, hear you. people sceptical vaccine. they're worried something may happen get vaccine think anything happen get virus many people seeing people getting sick dying? US hidden away hospitals.

I'm neighbors, friends family. know dozen people got virus. None died. One them, guy 70 smoker, suffered quite while. think that's typical people around world. ""experimental"" EUA treatment?

Crazy, use FDA approved medicine like Pfizer vaccines.  Sober seatbelted people die car crashes time. mean drunk driving without seatbelt safe mind check ""facts""? article(s) US Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) refuting? posts anything except obvious. always intended zero covid goal would end vaccine rates allow it. course point they’ll reopen tourism flooded infections overseas. think vaccination rates 90% reasonable given seriously people take (the guys point) won’t problem. Treat last. might always policy everywhere, universally enforced it, would see vaccinations increase. anything makes people get vaccinated, better. Carrots sticks. looking forward seeing Florida’s course makes sense data blocked. totally are. also espionage work here. well documented. context. Anti-vaxx + COVID doesn’t cause brain damage/abusive behaviour anymore COVID non-anti-vaxx brain. Also doesn’t explain behavior anti-vaxx subgroup doesn’t COVID. Well I’d say it’s getting people vaccinated (which think help) it’s actually lowering cases deaths amount (I prefer zero). Vaccinations means end. guess problem current messaging end goal vague lowering deaths/cases. think would really helpful way determining success failure. No, we're mask mandate (thankfully) rare much let know widespread side effects age censorship would easy control.

but line take jab, dont expect too.   24 (Reuters) - Hawaii Governor David Ige urged residents visitors restrict travel U.S. state essential business activities amid surge cases COVID-19 islands. governor highlighted restrictions restaurant capacities limited access rental cars said choose visit islands able enjoy typical Hawaii holiday. latest request comes governor re-imposed COVID-19 restrictions earlier month limiting social gatherings, Delta variant coronavirus pushed cases hospitalizations United States six-month high. run another question: 


Your patient 16 unvaccinated. parents antivax, caught whole family got sick. remarks wanted get it, parents it. get lower priority care, parents stupid? aware status may cause get lesser priority, lying? 


What multiple health issues, quality life NEVER going great? 


Regardless anyone stands, I'm glad I'm one make sorts calls, hope we'll give mental health support do. 


HAHAHA KIDDING. US. won't, we'll call pussies. Australia's fault :) statistical unlikelihood due breathing lol. Cant blame blokes we. man Ashley likes say ""the virus problem, people solution"".

I'm really one havin heroes looonnggg dead, therefore scrutiny. hes kinda over.

I hope guys get good luck good management, get back shitting rugby, league, whatever shit bananas game play wasteland :) entire post future?

Because started post writing could never understand people could talk 2 weeks lockdown handful cases

People talk NZ NZ seem realize locking handful cases sustainable long term strategy seem another solid plan. may set dangerous precedent. 
Do remember anti-dumping law? 
In pandemic makes sense reserve care people benefit most, follow guidelines ensure safety others, etc. problem access medical care limited, opens door barriers placed.
Not agreeing one way other; concerned possible future repercussions.  think New York California states this. there’s money involved. Tracking donations, policy decisions, potential negligence, there’s plenty might come back haunt him. Well sure that's end, countries like Australia, China etc get lockdown hell vaccines. need (mild) infections topups. me. limit even avoid consequences simply getting vaccinated. made calculation wouldn’t happen her.

How many people seeing people getting sick dying? US hidden away hospitals. Mine innaccurate first (only included second dose listed first) fixed month even without contacting them.

Keep checking. People make responsible choices get treatment first. ones purposely made shit worse fuck right die. Absolutely awful idea. getting infected doesn’t get with. No, kills 5000 years medicine kind thinking  obvious answer ""yes"", I'd go one step further: person willfully decides vaccinate comes covid receive help mEDiCaL eXPeRTs internet trust much shoddy tent parking lot, freeing valuable healthcare resources rest us realize do, indeed, live society mutual obligations other. Fair enough, bad here. We’ve spent pandemic free lockdown. trips back exception norm far. hit vaccine goal, plan open much like Europe doing. medical infrastructure weak allow virus run rampant here. don’t ICU beds cope right now. get sick too, spread people able get vaccinated yet.  Tiktok that? recent Mayo Clinic grand rounds - speaker told story man refused vaccination hospitalized said wanted every treatment known science, wish could figure out. think society doesn’t put lot value humility. takes humility admit don’t know something. often see people making stuff fly don’t admit don’t know?

About 20 years ago learned important lesson: person thinks know everything refuses ask help look information credible sources dangerous type arrogance. spent entire summer answering IRS letters lot tax returns coworker (who thought knew everything) prepared… I'd say people still refuse vaccine point mental issue. Absolutely not. face consequences actions someone selfish need treatment. remember Polio. QR code CA vaccine record website. Hospital treatment unvaccinated.

family doctors need take anyone list vaccinated.  vaccines aren’t enough (even 100% vaccination), don’t copy China (lockdowns + contact tracing + mass testing) stop spread. saying question give up? may photo group I’ve seen everyone good mask wore correctly. Proving earn degree *and* complete fucking idiot.

I never needed go anti vax prove folks make look easy. supposed able save android phone get error message every time try.

I made screenshot it. woman statistical anomaly. chances 30 year old ending like unlikely.

If seeing people around dying getting sick months jot gonna convinced people. care vaccinated not. last things need saddle people medical debt give power insurance companies. things hurt us.

Even passports doubts we'll avoid lockdown hope I'm wrong I'm prepared worst  No, (or, least, fully) still get Covid vaccinated. Look breakthrough infections.  Typical Canada vaccines still work organ transplant recipients, less well. reported 40% antibodies second dose, 68% third.

Also, people got vaccinated *before* organ transplants almost certainly better immune response people *after* transplant, immunocompromised time vaccine took effect.  always thought triage included primarily tending patients would likelier chance survival. also assume would infected vaccinated.

Don't pretend altruistic gift world. system place currently.

If actually know 5 people close died disease either extemely unlucky living new York old folks home. didn’t need deaths tell need vaccine health.

Again, hear I've explained way thinking different people vaccinated. Considering vaccinated patients are, there’s even fewer ventilators, wouldn’t really impact Covid patients unvaccinated.

Unless mean treat vaccinated cases (not Covid cases) town size roughly. 37% (under 20 12%+) vax rate, start school next week (masks choice).

My district covid plan. think over/never started. area 7% ICU beds remaining. 

We fill regular teaching jobs, main subs far covering. means even sub shortage now. quarantine plan. 

We're giant breakfasts together school (teacher staff in-service), pot lucks houses, huge meetings staff vaccinated (and definitely masked). Sadly even state South.  Let give slight caveat continue. say zero covid, mean nearly zero covid practical elimination like case Black Plague, polio, small pox, tuberculosis, others.

So yeah anyways tell it’s impossible practically eliminate covid like diseases. would love see stats  mean, done mask, supply toilet paper, waste want not....

..6 months stay home order later. Completely agree pre-existing Influensa protocols highly criticized many infectious disease experts, also differ significantly countries masks given importance. reality little high quality information Influenza actually transmitted. lot ways studied COVID transmitted significantly detail Influenza, think settled matter all.

Personally feel that's be. Mandates result arguments, drama, etc.. respect people's choices everyone gets along. agree valid reasons point time disallowing people getting vaccine?

According CDC, people autoimmune conditions may receive vaccine data exists safety vaccine minority group. disapprove hesitancy get vaccine. 

What people life support comas may able consent vaccine?

Regarding religious exemptions, dependent upon State it’s interpretation additional laws surrounding Title VII Civil Rights Act. 

Even legit reasons get vaccine account .0001% population, ethical deny medical help don’t vaccination?

I argue, no.  kids went school neighborhood. found started locking probably weeks everyone else. understand cloth mask mandates reinstated like March 2020. kn95 readily available now? thought wear cloth masks protect others masks protect available. Wish CDC emphasizing N95 people worried getting covid anxious people expect everyone else wear masks point seems like sets people angry everyone, could wear N95 protect done it. guy say vaccinated people likely pass virus unvaccinated? C'mon CDC messed up. Canada's reporting says complete opposite. Almost cases Canada fully vaccinated Agreed Yeah that’s true logic applied every vaccine that’s existence right now. I’m saying doesn’t need excuse, wanting get whatever reason perfectly ok Yep. I’m willing bet locked country completely two weeks we’d much better off.  HORSE PASTE noticed [CDC different vaccinated/unvaccinated individuals test known * People fully vaccinated get tested 3-5 days exposure, wear mask public indoor settings 14 days receive negative test * People fully vaccinated quarantine tested immediately identified, and, negative, tested 5–7 days last exposure immediately symptoms develop quarantine.

Interesting window differs

* Vaccinated 3-5 days exposure
* Unvaccinated asap, &amp; also 5-7 days exposure

I'm pretty much done... you’re casting assumptions. comes simple reality, people vaccinated, harder time virus spreading, fewer chances mutate, likely pandemic ends. 

As UK isn’t vaccinating kids, gist find (as linked story below,) kids lower risk want data move I’ll play guessing game. Maybe another reason UK cautions kids clusterfuck faced AstraZeneca vaccine (which US never approved.) Or, maybe call hold kids vaccine availability. US walk nearly drug store they’ll least one 3 available vaccines choose from. appointment needed. possible UK? saw poll 15% said get vaccinated circumstance. 15-20% vaccine-hesitant waiting things like FDA approval, etc...

Here's info you: we’ve decided can’t wait 3 months vaccines kids 

3 months? would require approval September since need bit month protection full. That's ""end year."" already looking full semester lost. that's stick timeline. happens push again? (I remember hearing Sept/Oct back spring) Missing school negative effects we're already 18 months substandard education many. Tell know guns... hear ya. got MBA last December, 3 years night classes working full time sales org expects call making pitches deals 60 hours week. damn near destroyed grinding out.

Then one day March 2020, walked business building campus 9:30 class, never returned. still gone back building. never even bought graduation robes. graduated oxford shirt. visited Smart Final, Party City, grocery store near brother's house, hobby store, mostly near PCH. might Walteria, right next Torrance. don'tknow boundaries are. said “start getting back degree normality” next spring. Idk you, live one restricted states country life pretty normal since June. Great way reward bad behavior :( Thanks this, way read felt entirely *Iraanic*  never got this, exploding Southern Hemisphere time, fucking summer…. learning live hospital capacity. 

This issue outside specific locations long time. would love see mandated masking again, several states mine made schools cannot mandate masks. ""highly recommend"" it, know lots parents send kids masks to. 


Anecdotally, conferences kid's teacher. quarter staff masked, one family saw masked, desk distancing classroom...his teacher masked said be. absolutely rough families actually concerned covid right now. Um yeah, mean *don't take them.* means important take them. Peak new cases expected rest week declining there. expectation South Island get go level 4 (100% lockdown) level 3 (90% lockdown) weekend, still another couple weeks Auckland outbreak concentrated. I'm saying cat go vet get spayed week vaccinations, let unvaccinated pet stay clinic without them.

This considered appropriate pets one bats eye. school going to?  sure. yet know rates long covid breakthrough cases. There's evidence least vaccinated people gotten long covid breakthrough infections. 

I live medical condition that's similar long covid incredibly disabling. I'm lucky enough able hold job live relatively normal life everyone can. Post-viral illnesses like long covid poorly understood basically incurable. get anyone would risk it, tbh.

I'm vaccinated, I'm tired pandemic too. we're going keep wearing masks taking many precautions can.  many ""booster"" jabs though? Yep. part public health requires public buy in. don’t see outdoors mask mandate gets point. Especially bars clubs packed brim. early pandemic (in 2020) heard someone interviewed NPR say might take 3-5 years things go back normal... seem far fetched point. shitty public health official believed anywhere near 100% people would get vaccine.

Half fucking job understanding people's response.  would agree, it’s Texas Tech. doubt anything gonna make school shutdown. saying don’t think should, fact pretty upset lack proper measures prevent spread here, higher-ups aren’t going shit Honestly need mandate vaccine masks able bodied Americans. Enough enough wishy washy “I can’t hurt feelings” bs. matter national security fucks sake. That's hang around peanut butter know bread guy *that summer everything changed* Sorry one got today technical af published one last week. data/publishing bit slow catch up. infection rates even alarming suspected weeks ago. tallied injuries, include neck wound three gunshot wounds left shoulder that’s need surgery: “Everybody really surprised I’m still bed week later.”
Valdez confirmed Monday afternoon still awaiting surgery contacted Washington Post, declined interviewed record.
At Ben Taub Hospital Valdez awaiting surgery, intensive care unit 103% capacity Monday morning, 33% cases related covid-19, spokesperson Harris Health System told Post. Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital, public hospital Harris Health System, remains similarly stretched 94% ICU capacity, 54% cases covid-related. many people unwilling vaccinated FDA approved vaccine willing take treatment still experimental use authorization? seems willfully unvaccinated take great pleasure fact disagree desperately trying control unable to. source empowerment enhanced feeling freedom. 

This clearly quickly headed towards continued accelerated levying rights freedoms unvaccinated non-physically force comply. verge getting far dystopian. 

What find interesting seems falling wayside CLEAR STRONG distrust government around half Americans, sure countries. It’s clearest sign lifetime reform needed, though sadly never happen without uprising. abbot outlaws it. sure submitting emergency use authorization maybe hinting submitting full approval. I’ve heard rumors full approval, takes longer review. parent, would love EUA, healthcare worker, get full approval means schools start mandating (which another worms don’t want touch. think masks contentious, mandating vaccines kids straight dangerous). remember 4pm March 12, 2020, leaving work 'practice work home day"" Friday 13th. cube neighbor shared conversation way crazy people going blow I'd see week two. seen since then. First time I’ve seen statistic adults. wonder accurate breaks age group. Governor Kathy Hochul says working COVID-19 vaccine requirement school personnel New York, teachers staff need take shots agree weekly testing. team also pursuing universal mask mandate everyone must wear face coverings inside school buildings. people vaccinated open one obstacles access. mainly POC, they'll probably find another way rich white people punish oppression. fuck can't kids act like responsible adults???

Since cases one day likely even coming days exponential growth.   zero reason think vaccines prevent variants. one gives shit anymore. seriously doubt college make year without lockdown, even fully vaccinated. adversary gotten much powerful.  Three GSW's ""left shoulder"" mention 3 are. mentioning life-threatening, *possibly* they're joint they're slated removal.

And main post illustrate mundane matter is, sure sucks that's life thanks people parts. don’t issues, being overweight. 

And *not being* vaccinated. good Lord it, that’s it.

Or maybe medical care allowed go home regimen vitamins zinc. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, would *horrible* thing come home to, sure always ifs wellness check Tuesday, etc. well.

&amp;#x200B;

Doggos least survived, though sounds like barely. Well, sort move around foot, want say body knows they're supposed care enough big immune response slowly get pushed toward surface sometimes pop like zit. incredibly satisfying also gross haha. mostly hang out, foot gets cold faster feet get swollen reason, foot ache bit even get kindof itchy. insight going two dose trial? remember January alluded results would come spring (like April/May). Obviously didn’t happen. hit snags? Results don’t support moving forward? Obviously don’t know that’s fine, figured I’d leap chance ask somebody who’s actually insights beyond radio silence I’ve able find.  Antivaxxer get care attention left literally anyone else sufficiently cared for. understand. sorry. bit open ended. 

I believe full issue though people simply deciding stay home, wear masks, get vaccinated, avoid crowds/public places, mind six feet, etc, get sick may sick. Many even testing covid care. tough out, go work, go parties, maybe lay bed days really need move past it. treat like many people treated cold flu pre-2020.

I think idea great interested safe &amp; staying home believe chance may Covid. awesome! sure staffing take testing house calls large scale would nice. think even home test kits person come 100% work accurate. drive-thru testing sure good. 

But people causing issue discussed care things. they'd get free vaccination we've offering 6 months now. thought suggesting send officials door-to-door testing people catch caring lying covid enforce new felony. Like, see someone looks sick follow home party test prove spreading something.  get it. SUPER frustrating parent. **SUPER** frustrating. Remember said November 2020. July 2021. I've seen that.  10 years. that's enough.  see HPV vaccinations. ass backwards way thinking.

Clean water commodity many parts world. mean be, okay Go report Israel... can't leave cliffhanger like that! Bend curve knots pliers! likely. Everyone screams delta comes questions. really good data suggesting delta effects vaccine significantly transmissible.

But yea, unvaccinated people put vaccinated people harms way they're infectious get sick. lots discussion age “would rather” posts. wanted point time age factor triaging involves children. Otherwise, age direct factor consideration. It’s often indirect factor (people tend comorbidities older age), part equation used determine likelihood survival. Here’s good read anyone sincerely interested decisions That's thing. get sick, evidence says vaccine vastly improves chances. enough oxygen 2 people age one people vaccinated, oxygen go vaccinated person. even moral, ethnical political reason. Triage states save lives possible amount care provide enough everyone. vaccinated person needs oxygen probably survive get care, best way use oxygen give patient better chances.

I'm favor punishing people, everyone get treated resources. unvaccinated know event health care crisis, give care someone better chances. anything asked about, doctor make decision gets one ECMO that. doubt many parents protesting children wearing masks Boomers. may wrong, Guam maintained certain amount independence governance structure, perhaps go additional review council/governor. idea American Samoa. could apply standard people receiving medical care though. would think high percantage people hospital due poor personal decisions, whether it’s condition caused smoking, drinking, obesity, drugs, etc.

There’s still hippocratic oath fulfilled. bet progressive crowd calling measure would singing different tune doctors said gay aids patients won’t treated failed use protection. figures, stats, data. Somehow sub went ""follow data"" ""anecdotes support anxiety need data"". mean basically patriotic duty mercilessly, relentlessly mock anyone know fucking braindead works. 30 year old guy takes care developed heart failure due congenital heart defect takes priority obese fat guy 70’s. Alcohol addicts drank liver death low chance getting transplant. reality they’re probably gonna drink one death lot people liver failure didn’t deserve it. 

It’s don’t deserve care life saving resources high demand low supply, decisions made. 

Just like people personally decide weigh more, small risk side effects vaccine real proven risks covid. made decision conscionably refuse vaccine potentially take away resources needed immunocompromised individuals vaccinated still need help especially risks serious side effects vaccine aren’t real proven yet.  13% New Mexico 🤷‍♀️ Straw man - stop moving goal posts.

If don’t know straw man is, go look girlfriend's family planned Hawaii vacation two weeks advance. get back Wednesday. people spontaneous. personally like planning far advance. guess naïve would pick one likely survive. literally happens already think know 2500 people math work. Although that's probably bit less living NY. Either way, death seen normal reality vast majority people. wonder loud... wonder month would like like still shadow... 

An alt history (present?) movie might interesting... agree anti vaxxers. spread kids 12 can’t get vaccine.  even worse? teams get cuckolded; essentially imported H-1B's forced American teams train them? fucking time Greece?  unpopular, kind division media exactly ended divided country first place. talking head, left right, mainstream platform mocks countrymen pandemic.

I swear people celebrating lack unity collapse US. \*beaucoup Maybe updated info yet time zone difference. triage point view isn’t common put priority likely survive? update vaccine kids? saw estimate, I’ve also heard much longer estimates. (Dec/Jan)  we've vaccinated large majority population there's much else do? went music festival week. Tested negative, got covid pass, went festival, regularly tested finished. Ok... ask break cases pros vaccine?  vaccinated protect themselves. kids missed year lives protect them? Culture war masks important keeping safe. Think will, certainly people chosen get vaccinated, probably many others option available. happens major groups gotten poorer. could see legitimate moral question, could easily another veiled attempt discriminate poor people. really don’t think true. People get vaccinated. I’m disagreeing all

But know lot vaccinated people don’t anything help health. don’t take meds they’re supposed to

Meanwhile know unvaccinated young people great shape eat super well. Hell professional athletes aren’t vaccinated

It makes hypothetical scenario easy throw blanket statement group it’s true   full FDA approval would say no. FDA approval happened I'd say debate. sure stand it. highly doubt it. Don’t kid yourself, bottom line save insurance company money. start, first step treatment ""heres vaccine shot"". Refuse shot? Great, refusing treatment, go die parking lot.  Oxygen dont refuse treatment.

Deny covid? Thats fine, cant treat something say have, might get sued, go die parking lot. Oxygen covid.

Once hospitals arent overloaded go back luxury treating idiots. that's first word headline true.... so... I'm betting getting from? see Guam listed see Micronesia map. see USA listed full EUA site likely flux. Exactly! wonder u/atomic0range realize he’s acting like child. 

Okay. read words post order. Now, answer question! might minority there, definitely correct Well, article everyone said hadn’t gotten vaccinated.

So sounds like vaccinated people long lines suffering consequences choices unvaccinated. blame POC hesitant get vaccine government conducted programs like Tuskegee experiment? No.

Well, hang one second there. I'm blaming anyone, agree justification hesitancy early on. hundreds millions billion people races, creeds, colors, etc. taken vaccines, whole ""what experimenting us"" thing really hold water anymore. another silly excuse people using scared. I’m SWVA/NETN too, would willing share urgent care make sure avoid? They've really (not) killing it! One poorest, rural areas, still figure get ahead this. impressive work! get narrative ""all horrible people America horrible making feel bad horrible, stop they'll great""? stupid. There's precedent anytime there's shortage medical supplies care, triage basically ""either plan responsibly happens randomly."" district thought moving kids around every 14 minutes avoid close contact(6ft/15min) good idea. left dead bodies streets little bit instead immediately hiding morgues/ice trucks/etc, would probably take covid much seriously even without symptoms.  submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Ok question can’t seem find answer searching next logical thing ask people smarter Reddit. vaccinated feel everyone be, however vaccine passports restrictions like don’t make sense me. fact Delta, vaccinated person catch spread virus easy unvaccinated person ever stop pandemic? vaccine always said keeping alive hospital preventing transmission restrict unvaccinated people risk other? definitely understand push get vaccinated overwhelm hospital workers who’ve busting ass long tout get vaccinated end pandemic, unvaccinated people continuing extend pandemic vaccinated people thing. think message unclear think many mandates based case count wrong since vaccine isn’t intended stop transmission, hospitalizations deaths. Thanks anyone helps clear heard thing last spring 2021 several risk calculators, including ones online. correct vaccines offer substantial protection, constructed dilemma vaccinated person several risk factors death.

Whether 30 year old idiot come play. unvaccinated person idiot drunk driver crashed, ATV rollover trauma, COPD patient smoked lungs destruction, heart attack overweight, underexercise person. Many adults end ICU arrived part choices. still take care them.

When see unvaccinated person COVID, think victim propaganda, fear, stupidity. deserve healthcare much us. compartmentalize whatever frustration anger job. Weird. Ontario never got rid mask mandates. bet drive without seat belt right? Let kids look dogs play road correct? look ways crossing street? answer yes, get vaccinated. Taking reasonable precautions save others peoples lives isnt scared. using common sense based information available. Triage unvaxxed back tent dumpsters might 74 million idiots varying degree fairness anti vaxers experience probable doesn’t matter. I’ve quite vaccinated patients (not Covid reasons) already frequent fliers hospital don’t comply medical treatments all. someone got vaccinated doesn’t mean they’ll things people also 10 kids 20 grandchildren doubtful  Get shot, *make antibodies* - **BOOTSTRAPS** ! actually. distinctly remember January 2020 seeing reports ""unspecific pneumonia"" China month. Something China locking whole city, something like that.

My thoughts time were, ""The next 5 years going suck.""

I still hope proven wrong, far we're still track next 3.5 years still suck due pandemic. one gaslit. *were* pretty normal summer things *were* looking going beat pandemic. Delta changed everything.  reality medical. Paramedics roll scene mass casualty incident find 5 year old kid alive breathing, give black tag keep moving. 

Right now, many beds many ventilators. It’s slippery slope think we’re point. Especially place like texas zero ICU beds right now. can't find read/heard that, probably disregard that. Israel released news effectiveness preventing infection day, imagine concern relevant anymore anyways. mentioned would mean 1 week gaps even questionable, without source could remembering random commenter reddit without real source brain bad thing associated whatever real source read before/after.  Talking oxygen, wife's hospital past maximum capacity oxygen use, wall oxygen lower pressure needed. break canisters oxygen move patients relieve load. remember correctly, mask mandates implemented cities/towns understandably lapsed vaccine made available Covid numbers tanking. right now, schools and/or school districts mandating masks even surging Covid cases children.  Ty! Dang kind depressing though indicates delta breaking often. control, mitigation.
 
This virus, like many it, simply endemic.

Something tells defaulting trillions real estate debt obligations may cause issues everyone.   that's rub--in triage consider likely survive. answer vaccinated.  link data collected state Masschusetts. appears interactive I'm guessing updates intermittently today click ""Hospitalizations"" read ""On August 22, 2021 530 patients hospitalized COVID-19. 530 patients, 155 reported fully vaccinated COVID-19 contracted COVID-19."" punched numbers calculator, 155/530= .29 29% sleeping asses air. •• Looks political landscape

Yeah, good luck. They’re really. active alcoholic isn’t getting liver punishment alcoholic. aren’t getting they’re less likely live healthy years afterwards

An unvaccinated patient could deemed better recovery possibility vaccinated patient. That’s they’d going instructed state police unlawfully seize scientists electronics leaking actual covid numbers year ago. He’s criminal jail.

He also violated first amendment’s freedom press restricting bill signing(s?) available coverage Fox News.

He also violated Florida constitution extending judicial appointing privileges past date required submit (or would go back judicial nomination committee). precedent power so.

These authoritarian acts, I’m opinion repeated violations law power grab go unpunished.   guess report know. likely tough hold court. 

It come times back kids work spitting stuff grocery stores etc... sickness, likely mild asymptomatic, also near someone else gets sick later? might ""know"" played general, where's chain evidence one? know contagious care test? person definitely get someone else?

Overrated. There's non-insignificant carbon costs growing potatoes raising cows climates meant them. Oftentimes outweighs additional miles traveled.

Obviously, want green, avoid eating beef. like, ain't got nothing localness McD's. 


And NEVER get locally sourced ingredients price McD's offer. Farm table restaurants cheap. They're even really competitors McD's. Indeed  can’t believe pandemic might dictate lives next 4-5 years  Perhaps it’s matter population density? That’s speculation though! agree villifying mocking people political beliefs. agree calling people stupid opinions based fact backed science. tend stick Reuters, anyhow. Pretty sure went Lahser HS That’s totally untrue medical community says. seen discriminatory poor people, agree obesity heavily taxed. Great, kid ends hospitalized public school system refuses mandate masks claim bankruptcy. Cool cool cool. think people obese correct BMI refused medical treatment. obviously refused science suggest overweight bad health. allowed hospitals pandemic over. strain resources people really care health begin with. 

Hey what's difference? philosophy. can’t find much vaccine preventing getting ill delta, works really well preventing hospitalization death. think that’s mask mandates everyone back people still contracting Covid high rate even fully vaccinated shedding virus even rate agree whole-heartedly decisions ""whos covid infection worth treating"" would never easy based information gathered triage situation, however think issue becoming is... yes, Covid patients need treating, long really drain hospitals overall resources willfully ignorant (or easily misled)?

* 100 beds hospital,
* 20 ""Covid patients"" (because different considerations need used Covid vs not).
* 19 Covid beds filled unvaxxed, 1 vaxxed...
* 10 unvaxxed Covid Patients come in, theory make room 80 beds purposes...

But 10 less beds/resourses people Covid, happen stroke, heart attack, get accident... things could (easily) prevented like Covid infections unvaxxed could (for part... admittedly completely even vaxxed). issue. 

How much room keep taking willfully people (mostly) preventable contagious condition, chose take easy steps prevent it? Kinda wish could ""unvaxxed Covid-only hospital"" (maybe good place utilize nurses/staff choose remain unvaxxed?) vs ""regular hospital"" take vaxxed covid patients well... practical either.

The whole situation sucks, 100% morally ethical move.  lack critical thinking skills great projection. Super topic 17ish worked camp counselor summer one kids named ""Johnny Fives"" always thought future superhero name. ""Johnny Fivejabs"" destiny thought went club got infected. careful. We've done trips decide day go long weekend. depends guess. Delta, low vaccination rates allowed people get really sick. Canada watched US open take away masks scientists knew whether vaccinated people could spread virus, delta strain, understand it. Even high vaccination rate, unvaccinated people getting sick filling hospitals. fact everyone North America vaccine access virus still shutting hospitals largely rate unvaccinated. understand children can't get vaccinated, lot sick people right children. hard country we've shut nearly 2 years, many us raced get vaccines people want them, need lockdown again, people need cancer treatment can't get ICU crowded. I’ve bought plane tickets day I’ve left before, within week tons times. work media schedules change hot fast - I’m typically going book personal trip weeks advance job could come in. drop dates fast, go.

Also Hawaii ton media work. Announcements like cause jobs get pushed later dates. We’ve tons rescheduling summer due delta surge. I'll damned wait another 7 damn months see family US.

Better lift damn travel ban vaccinated Europeans.  Probably written prior information coming light. (I posted reply another comment I’ll repeat here) Yes hospitalization rate total population vaccinated still extremely low! Data hospitalizations looking like many people vaccinated total population. 

However think people cautious delta even vaccinated much transmissible. Especially mother getting sick long fever 103. happened pregnant person, would really dangerous unborn baby. moms partner didn’t really get sick tested positive 18 days couldn’t work. people without job security would lose jobs might able pay living expenses lost wages.

There sorts negative consequences less severe hospitalization death also impactful one’s life.


On top this, vaccinated people transmitting delta people can’t get vaccinated children risk. especially relevant family moment since children go daycare right even though it’s scary could exposed. That’s fair. I’ve also seen plenty abuse industry - everything big box retail auto manufacturing. risk reduction elimination. still wear seat belts seatbelt laws even though people still get hurt killed car accidents.

Please elaborate think would case oligarchs said, want money! Hah - first comment regarding COVID article unknown disease Wuhan. Someone saying antivaxxers blame said pretty sure vaccine 
“mystery virus”. 

Well, ain’t mystery now, vaccine, antivaxxers ever, much blame. 

I cautiously hopeful US much world reach “we live it” phase relatively soon, based apparent herd immunity UK - Delta spike petered unexpectedly early 94% population antibodies. think one way another happen US within next months. wish vaccine kids expect breakthrough infections keep hospitals busy death rates years, overall COVID finally checked. 

Then look rates vaccination poor parts world (particularly Africa) think there’s still plenty sorrows come. worry non-negligible possibility new variants evolving new levels immune escape pathogenicity.

Just, ugh, sorry deal that. unvaccinated far higher chance spreading vaccinated. I'd prefer impose vaccine requirements let conspiracy theorize comfort homes rest us go lives. Yes see, I'd get COVID become naturally immune... think I'd rather effin' *not* that.

Real talk. I'd rather 7 billion people B+ COVID immunity, let another several million drown phlegm get A- immunity. ""Well normal me.""  didn’t take long. got email work saying “Get vaccinated submit weekly testing”. Evolution work way. can’t think things relation time pertains get virus control.

Now let's take downvotes bots together, friend. wanted know care matter affiliations vaccine status. 🤜🤛  Agreed that’s makes ticked everyone clearly sees hospitalizations going virus going magically disappear vaccine. 
People still wear mask gathering oh well long vaxxed good that’s true. intend things like indoor dining clubbing vacation, fully vaccinated cruise almost certainly less COVID-risky vacations. said, may depend COVID situation visits. vaccinated act unvaccinated still practice social distancing, masking rest... punchline deliver, seems obvious: decide vaccinated unvaccinated; (at moment anyway) really moving needle much unvaccinated, moving needle potentially dramatically vaccinated. smoking gun proof article FDA’s sloth warranted back 50’s wasn’t slow approved polio vaccine killed 11 people. author doesn’t seem take seriously either idea proceeding slowly may improve safety product idea lengthy approval times cause loss life.

We also allowed 5 sick days 5 absent days year else they'll report state board. There's wave stomach flu going around now, kids tested negative covid far, can't even stop that. we're week 3 school.    simple triage mass casualty event. Vaccinated patients higher survival rate, get treated first. 1 respirator save number people use it, unvaccinated taking respirator longer poorer results, sadly waste type scenario. resources low 1 respirator could save 5 people used stabilize 1 person cannot recover, amount time. paramedic years mass casualty triage mass shooting, explosion, 15 car pile 28 serious pts, different.


I hate think way.

 hate think like this.   Taiwan's strategy would worked like 1 2 access points.

Europe countless access points dozens different countries different policies interests. Many countries implement travel restrictions late January, nowhere near enough (obviously).

Honestly, outbreak Europe inevitable. Geographically logistically probably worst place pandemic. Maybe US could delayed start, sooner later they'd needed lockdown too.

Yeah, sure, isolation bogus argument despite single powerful weapon pandemic. Plague Inc material, rocket science. happened every pandemic before. Countries isolate fare better.

They absolutely level China outside Hubei, even Hubei mid February.

Spain one point allowed people get specific times day depending ages. brutal. - alternative (the one used every serious illness) effectively removing society. Ya know - don’t see accepting small pox, polio, measles way life everyone needs get sick diseases. mean people get vaccine 5% still catch covid?

This. worth noting figure *symptomatic* covid. Lots people still contract virus, show symptoms, spread around (albeit lower transmission rate someone symptomatic). like 12? think hospitals full right unvaccinated people extremely low almost impossible chance hospitalized? history violent, life-threatening reactions vaccines. can't get doctor sign getting vaccine, even though would give anything able get it. apparently crap shoot likely kill -- vaccine, disease itself. worry this? kids never get sick? dont blame Australia outbreak NZ. positive cases Managed Isolation, including delta ages. one things. People wanna blame people, sorta natural suppose.

Some unlikely shit happened. That's all. really unlikely scenario courtyard. We'll sort soon enough. Hopefully many people get sick, that's matters. claim New Zealand one isolated countries world.

You must missed post above. Canada shares long border US exceptionally well controlled. shut exactly much wished to, theory practice. puts us exactly level field New Zealand terms isolation. TLDR: keep hearing bogus argument, least compared Canada, easily exposed bogus. think stupidity peak, bad news you. Timing everything. followed Taiwan’s lead. wouldn’t even need local lockdowns. travel restrictions, testing tracing. medical community request anti vaxxers go triage tent instead emergency room. medical professionals anti vax man tents anti vax family. goes every profession/jobs think of. mean it’s there.

I’m happy hear  Italy Spain strictest lockdowns world China. 3 whole months still manage eradicate it. let's even talk poorer countries.

I even think people outside China realize extraordinarily lucky China first wave. locked Wuhan virus yet significantly spread outside Hubei (despite control inside it). made infinitely easier eradicate within China. Northern Territory pretty good job. new Zealand fairing better us every state plan. try time everyone forgotten corona shite dodgy pollies vote back Mass testing available every country.

The reality boosters natural (infection) immunity, things going normalize October/November timeframe even though may run counter expectations around seasonality. live Scotland ask nurse administered vaccine getting said BioNtech slip I’d never heard it, haha.

“It’s Pfizer, don’t worry” said. Deaths basically flat, means AZ designed. end pandemic exact scenario: People get sick rarely seriously so, like cold typical flu. yeah, eventually rest world follow pattern, something like it.  North American Balding Ape...with chin?  sources numbers, please? 

I conversation young redditor claimed much lower death rate age group. 

Thank you. 4. US alone, [205MM doses administered Emergency Use Authorization.

Doesn't figure include vaccines like Moderna well? find very, hard believe ~50% US fully vaccinated Pfizer alone. true I'd expect adding Moderna data would get us least 80% fully vaccinated unfortunately case.  Top comments good news: bitching name. gawd. again, name vaccine brand names ? ""flu shot"" ""chicken pox shot"". thought poor people less likely come back second dose? J&amp;J gets protected one shot. Ah. Got it. Protests never result jail time.

Never.

No exceptions.  indefinitely

indefinitely: unlimited *or unspecified* period time. troll?

Genuinely understand appeal. I’m really struggling understand logic here. still wide open barely hospitable capacity, shut last winter/spring hospital capacity reached 300???

Like worst point since Pandemic started less ever since whole thing started? 

Is plan keep asking people get vaccinated? mean hell difference make non-Covid illnesses injuries happen hospitals still full? 

Shut shit little bit help hospitals case loads.. it’s hard think temperature checks epitome. least understand people thought disinfecting would work, immediately obvious everyone temperature checks make sense. Good luck! hope feel better soon too, it’s huge adjustment eh scomo lock protestor, going show scomo pissed off? Collateral damage. Whether collateral damage worth different discussion.  Sure, mean, 12... ad company created girlies Plus never got shot. Chances catching Covid prison: high Delta ravaging population? Looks like market opening anti-vax hookup site :

""EnTwoBate"" : ICU better two! completely point pronunciation, good job! Mandates.  Anti-vaxxers need excluded society greatest extent possible. Brit here. Sorry, could someone quickly explain big deal? saying Americans vaccinated non-approved vaccine? thing hear people saying ""well may never get covid get vaccine know running risk. would like saying need never get flu rest life make gamble worth it. like admit it, long live normal life span, probably getting flu point there.  true?   least testing required even site testing. Inconvenience people enough eventually get it. 8 months probably dumb messaging CDC leadership. Fortunately, US health system dysfunctional really enforce anyone getting vaccinated 8 month “limit”. Many states would outright refuse federal government would take point. probably decided 31st. 

But ACIP took extra week reauthorize J&amp;J vaccine blood clot issue surfaced - emergency meeting, committee members ready vote asked data, met week later point voted reauthorize vaccine new guidelines.   getting vaccinated?

[2500 covid deaths 18-29 year anaphylaxis mRNA yea dumb shit, thats opinion, everyone downvoted comment, yall dumb shit Available 5 months out. literally state affairs 2010. don’t suggest going back that. I'm sorry misinformation. vaccines cause myocarditis, noted side effect. However, comparable rate general incidence myocarditis, less actual COVID. scare anyone get vaccine, perhaps take next day feeling super well. even read comment replying to?  Germany France planning boosters dont know time table. countries get hit hard India, UK Israel. can't think cormorant.

*corvus marinus* Something something consequences actions. 

This reminds story awhile ago Trump admin staffers hiding work history people would ghost found worked him. even make ""Conservative tinder"" type app (that immediately major data breaches)?  live Tempe student apartment. roommate wear face mask believes vaccine protect him.  reminds zuPOO ad YouTube. “Did know th average human x lbs ToXiC pOoP?!” parent’s neighbor outside day parents started talking him. two girls, one four one six. told parents wasn’t getting vaccinated one reason another parents asked would happen children got sick, hospitalized died responded (gesturing them) “that’ll problem then, mine.”  Yeah but... That's rationalizating bad behavior. sympathize putting ego kids health. Check health dept. county giving boosters think would qualify.    may keep cutting cost outsource work low cost region. perfect pilot test types work outsourced.

Hope wrong... Also make unvaccinated pay every cent Covid treatment.

Why rest us subsidize stupidity? No, exactly. However, confirmed ballpark calculated later October, think was. referred paper much wider dataset used calculate 5 10000 mortality 70s generally, range based factors. There's certainly need change low figures here. 

Cases literally detections SARS-CoV-2 disease Covid19. useful track spread virus, never overshadowed really important figures deaths serious illness. UK well important figures long time. one can’t believe wasn’t already thing? waiting anti vaxxers move goal posts wonder one day we’ll single vax STDs sentence says 18 schools across Ireland excluded students staff testing. case ""excluded"" means ""did allow in"".

 Essentially, 18 schools went full lockdown everyone tested. u r living dreamland bro oath make doctors slave. phrase way. I'd say something like ""Hey, I'm glad going go get vaccine approved! chosen place go get yet?"" love username! exactly what’s happening. Commented elsewhere buddy moved morning. good talk friend nurse dosent yesterday. Meanwhile House Abbott Built poor bureaucratic schmucks nothing like horizon. agency’s leadership strongly recommend masks vaccines since Der Fuehrer prevented requiring either. Yup. vaccination card says ""COMIRNATY"", everyone talks ""I got biontech vaccine"". Ermehgerd comirnity! it’s don’t know long term effects. Ain't seen door greeter Wal-Mart younger 40 whole life. actually seemed gotten older local Walmarts since pandemic, ironically mother currently fighting covid Oh no, staggered lunches lol. 4 lunch sessions 3rd period classes. outdoor seating, we're one wettest regions Pacific Northwest works half time. totally makes sense places.

You sure? experience matter are, may call certain meds generic name brand name. 

In US example, usually say Tylenol, usually say ibuprofen. example involving Europe, usually see people say ""Estrofem"" whereas medication usually called estradiol estrogen US. given Emergency Use Authorization - EUA, basically thing, there's time component ""full approval"" happened yet. FDA approval, United Airlines pushed date employees need get vaxxed get out. end September. Hey, country opened vaccinations 35 Friday, give people days leniency!   10% country covid. supposed poster child everything. want 7,250 lbs muscle, fat.  mean, that's bitch really. given EUA - Emergency Use Authorization, basically same, extra months approval. ones waiting approved going find excuse get now. news makes difference them. think comment deserves downvote. Look happened teachers nationwide. vaccinated? I've seen anecdata people getting Covid-related loss taste back getting vaccine. sounds weird, much Covid stuff is.

A vegan court case getting flu vaccine upon time line someone tested animal. self-aware sound like smart person. That’s blessing curse!

Haha, thank you! often is, back high school friends would describe self aware robot. see NJ area low wage crap. good remote jobs get hundreds applicants 1 opening. It’s ridiculous.

Same (Denver metro). Hardly anything pays decently, even tech mostly help desk (need ask friends, hear often miserable). open jobs slammed applicants, basic legal assistant jobs 400+ applicants one job, cringe think industries compare, something tells across board. like school may best bet multitude reasons, especially health.

Thanks I'll best! Based what? sounds lot like baseless fear mongering   What...Vaccine ""Maximalist"" pretty dumb.

Boardmasters website, festival goers aged 11 asked demonstrate COVID-19 status via NHS app allowed enter.

Looks like strategy worked really well.  People get brain poisoning kinds sources. 

At least ""I problem formally approved"" fairly mild poisoning, far goes. Finally course not. Doesn’t mean people won’t make fuss they’re idiots don’t understand governments broad legislative powers comes issues public health. Yep, didn’t say same. point didn’t even try stop one, despite knowing how.  Lincoln could seen party become, would saved Booth trouble. isn’t happening aren’t many vaccinated people choose from. Get vaccine Friday afternoon. Side effects never last day two. You’ll fine Monday. “Unvaccinated” isn’t protected class (or whatever) charter. would named FreedomVax, AR-19 Tactical, Jesus Jab.

“Are vaccinated?“

 
“No.”

”End triage line then.” Canadian visiting FL here, strange seeing place living Canada. majority people don’t wear masks indoors public places. downright hostility towards elsewhere considered evidence based public health. govt release basic things like positivity rates. went get covid test border checked three places, say 3-5 days get results. feel sorry people hospital dead peoples stupidity. Yes, doesn’t mean couldn’t stopped. means would effort SARS. knew nothing. Nah God made ICU beds. Fucking bravo lmao government takeover healthcare? Right flu worry whether Pfizer, Moderna, etc.  work better home. couple coworkers case opposite--one internet connection that, whatever reason, like office's VPN, really slow, GF usually work work time ends distracting him. returned office ASAP. one downside shifting WFH see impact many local downtown businesses areas office commercial zoning. fault lies directly city lack residential areas cities. Downtown areas like Manhattan massive residential population fine, cities like Houston massive population commutes start seeing streets empty unless apartments get built replace office population. Staff quitting? I'm surprised already illegal doctors walk-out there. Given people's lives depend doctors, something figure hard time passing pass similar laws teachers strikes. I’m going go Wikipedia article sampling. point should’ve tested everyone Auckland before. Moriarty Big Slugger ? don’t understand why, example, Maine public health officials don’t look across river say, “Hmmm…what different us guys there? 400 people hospital 1?” defies logic.

And much think CDC made mistake, especially given transmissibility Delta variant. mentioned says vaccination rates town available.


In words... one vaccinated. think we'll one perfect vaccine foreseeable future. We'll get every year like flu. got answer someone else could get back you. So, same? Oh thought meant like, total since vaccines opened all. seems like reasonable number also kinda heartbreaking bad, misspelled ""flu"" Sorry, can't read. surgical mask evaluation looks low end (&lt;50% filtration particles) decribed study ""a typical three-ply blue pseudo-surgical mask"" ""a polydisperse distribution particle sizes mean diameter approximately Linsey Marr's study, filtration level described top two, surgical mask ∼50–75% efficient size range [0.04 1 μm], falling range reported surgical masks previous studies (Makison Booth et al. 2013; Oberg Brosseau 2008; Zangmeister et al. 2020; Zhao et al. 2020).

It takes lot volunteer work. Every community, every village organizer, doorman, contact, nurse. time, necessary ensure transportation living materials, workers' protection, vaccination sites queuing system.The whole country must mobilized war.

I'm extremely concerned peds ICUs filling up, first thing throw graph peds infections, COVID hospitalizations.

Then bury this:

Pediatric hospitalizations still represent tiny fraction overall totals, climbing every day. already children’s hospitals, less flexibility adult hospitals, make space COVID patients.

The fine print got 1 2 kids there. data showing PICUs filling due COVID serious hell problem, PICUS small nature, date kids hospitalized. actually cut factor 10 LEAST allow vaccination. (and assuming 100% vaccination hahaha, happen course). 

But article, help all. Vast amounts people dead mean sure glad done classic American move killing others freedom ;) Damn, got SpikeVax‘ed 😎  Society interest population getting vaccinated. want get vaccinated, fine. free want be, but:
NO ACCESS PUBLIC BUILDINGS LIKE
Schools

AND IMPORTANTLY
Polling Places VOTE ELECTIONS.
Now let's see say voting mail.  Relax homie, I'm double vaxxed myself. I'm vaccine. I'm saying China's method lockdown works better vaccines comes suppressing virus.

Just look country high vaccine rate, virus still running wild China superior mRNA vaccine, yet still able contain virus using zero tolerance lockdowns.

Amazing, absolutely wonderful job China! Lol remember shirt shortage total slow pants sales start WFH lol Article literally say... useless article. think change mind attending reason science, anyway...  whatever want live US. Vast majority people think care covid anymore. Wasn’t ready twist end. Wew. deep irony fewer restrictions dependent vaccine coverage. vaccine hesitant anti-vaxxeds delay people talking protecting individual freedoms suddenly businesses right employ unvaccinated people. It’s almost like stance completely disingenuous hypocritical. believe line somewhere around 1-2 years depending ask Would able offer discount getting vaccinated nah?  Even though America great job forcing Natives abandon cultures assimilate American way things, one thing persists lot Native communities idea acting collective good bad thing. sometimes slow, available. detailed daily breakdown find English. Yeah, hate subreddit sometimes. Lambda already died out, least CA. Peak cases March hundred cases, couple cases past month. Can’t believe took pandemic… extent good. Maybe finally move let Gen X us Milennials move ladder. Damn, playing COVID Pokemon  it!

Hopefully empty office towers become apartments Approval formality really. really situation may may not. forget bleach! Even then, I'd imagine government lie vaccines, especially since vaccines' developers separate organizations, it'd govt's best interest get many people vaccinated deadly disease. could plausible they'd lie it? least, teens'/20-year-olds' point view? Source: overwhelming majority serious cases unvaccinated:    Wait, different vaccine got?  Imagine giving job vaccine. never understand people. Plus, there'd almost reason go multivalent vaccine; flu shots quads. me, worst chills I've ever progressed 3 days, sort stopped got better better. sore arm full 3 days well. parents took Pfizer, neither experienced side effects. friends taken JNJ report have, others reported feeling thing. wish luck making best decision   A) already 6+ months follow data Can’t spell “Reddit” without “pedantic”! Many ready give lives. sign hoping survive.  First, young people meant 18. specified that. think 30-somethings young, higher risk COVID get vaccinated.

But see anything comparing Delta variant previous variants. seems look people already hospitalized COVID opposed chances they'll even hospitalized first place. big driver increasing hospitalization 18-34 compared older people is, simply, old people either already COVID (and died built immunity), vaccinated. Young people vaccinated much slower rate, partially age-based rollout, partially they're high risk death. young people becoming *more* susceptible, old people becoming *less* susceptible.

There still 3500 hospitalizations &lt;18 350 deaths. That's nothing. Citation needed. ho lee fuk

At last job $20 per pay period! Hope feels better soon military care one bit people feel. people felt like follow orders? think military relax order-giving scenario?

Of course not. run successful campaign giving whining babies. Oh Christ. I'd laugh sad. else sociopathic, laugh absolute idiotic fear greed higher ups, racist enablers streets lead shit first place!&lt; mistake, judgement call. Everyone knew going 3-4 weeks pretty much absolute minimum spacing necessary get reasonably good immune response, even longer spacing would better long term. also unclear single shots would provide much protection all, especially patients concern like elderly compromised immune systems. going tested shorter interval fastest way get people ""fully vaccinated"" status.

People generally compliant comes masks, subway example required mask up. 

Their average attitude towards Western response, conversations I’ve taxi drivers colleagues, general incredulity. get sympathetic looks say I’m America questions like, “Is family ok? government responding poorly.” Things like that. 

Vaccination rate low started delta outbreaks people started getting shot. starting see vaccination requirements places hasn’t widespread doesn’t public support, might change though. propaganda campaigns running full speed now. general though, people committed COVID zero opinion. new nephew (third one) days ago, couldn’t care less BIL Qwife anti-vaxx Trump conspiracies. want nothing now, guess that’s shame people’s eyes.  There's virus vaccine.

So yes, contained zero cost, thanks.  live US. cannot kinds things. exclude society, jail jail journalist reports anything. Bahaha, upvoted. effective couple months ago. Lots people sheepishly pulling masks glared. Now, yeah, zero fucks given.  labor delivery nurse too. Pregnant women vaccinated never reason think would harm baby. unvaccinated knowing young daughter would leave motherless. 

I wonder got infected hospital? Republicans there? wannabes? many people year Covid kill. much money raised stop Covid? 

How many people cancer killed? much money raised time since Covid started cure cancer? drop bucket. It’s even CLOSE urgency cure cancer. 

Sorry dad. No, we're comparing UK country. OP claimed deaths UK flat, not. That's demographic hesitant take vaccine. name help accept shot. Also within. It’s reason Ebola thank god doesn’t go far people don’t move much lack infrastructure. tech job outsourced covid started. I've UI ever since. saved enough really retire decided semi-retired (50s).

According every site checked claim pregnant women high risk coming illness ring true.

Reread lilcrumb's link, saying pregnant women likely become infected. saying thing UK studies. said would 3 day lockdown period 🙄 instead thinking isolate whole country rest world implementing strict lockdowns foreseeable future focusing vaccinating population.

Raveendran et al 20,
OR = 2.5 Severe vs Moderate

Sadre et al 21,

I think going like sars-cov-2 variants, new annual Flu 2 vaccine, time drastically lower chance drowning fluids.  Oh guaranteed. anti-vaxxers die, may indeed approach 90% vaccination. ""oh fuck, here"" moment Northern NJ/ NYC Metro Area happened damned fast. 

It late February Early March seeing happening Wuhan, Iran, Northern Italy, also seeing sporadic cases pop across states thinking we're still clear... 

Then one man Westchester tested positive known contact affected regions people thereof... family next day... neighbors... several people tri-state area known connection tested positive CDC confirmed community spread active region within week. Two weeks later, NYC entire tristate shut down, hospitals overrun thousands new cases deaths day, virus spread way middle nowhere workplace infected dozen people killed two. Somehow lucky enough avoid whole time. one original variants virus, far less contagious Delta today.

With long incubation period ability spread asymptomatic carriers, time first people start showing symptoms new community, already probably spread thousands late contain. I’m cheering on. admit lose bit empathy, bothers feel way. see many afraid. you’ve bought notion government evil, media working them, news article make feel safe? FDA regulation make feel confident? people afraid vaccine may them, misinformation get makes seem like vaccine worse virus. afraid wrong. idea everything based on, many case due politics, wrong cannot get subconscious (and doesn’t happen Republicans). possibility wrong would mean wrong this, else wrong on. cases, leads anger, violent outbursts.  roadblock public services vaccine mandates work. Born 2002 ;) two months ago, CDC director saying vaccines prevented spread vaccinated could mask go lives. seems reinfection probably common expected now.  2 weeks flatten curve. What's reputable? totally forgot people south AC. Exactly. choice take/approve treatment always comes weighed risk of
doing nothing.

It makes sense bar lower treatment baseline risk higher.

People instead seem view “safe” “unsafe” absolute terms. would enough never speak allow family function every again. Maybe wife too.  article also archived Angeles county one first, perhaps first California (perhaps USA?) put mask mandate face delta.

There's also rather high vaccination rate (I _think_ relatively high):

http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/vaccine/vaccine-dashboard.htm

  Residents Vaccinated
  Age 12+ least 1 dose

This _may_ coincidental! know two kids (different families) 5 perfectly good health one died one severe health complications covid personal anecdote reassuring all. could open doors lot things. Could imagine Christian Republican MD able refuse treatment anyone that’s Christian Republican? refuse treatment someone LGBTQ? refuse treat obese diabetic eat McDonald’s? cardiac patient eat much red meat? like links agree them, however expect types papers swept side govs going listen big boys like CDC like they've past year. first vax recommended people risk covid complications, US already started mandating vax certain retail establishments. see booster going direction imo minor inconvenience compared risk infection it, passing someone else potentially killing them.

I live Florida wearing mask 95+ degree heat 100% humidity crap, possibly worst case scenario whole country. Gotta gotta protect everyone though. Thanks, yeah, today noticed bit improvement strong scents, that’s encouraging. Considering they're throwing vaccines nobody wants level martyrdom seems kind unnecessary. Hahahaha Looks like I'm one misunderstood 😅 unvaccinated punished recklessness. risk suffering get simple shot, easy out, refuse want believe ridiculous conspiracies. 

I simply can’t sympathize people they’re compromised health direct result choices, shouldn’t pay price actions. I'm trying keep 1st grader class moment. (School full mitigations, saying enough I'm hoping helps. would homeschooling.) kind definite date kids protected seems air. 😔 reputable source believe sons would alive today shot. insanity. specifically talking review Pfizer submittal  point USA border millions trucks crossing thousands crossing daily work means canada anyway geographic position NZ. 

So closing border tightly pursue COVID zero strategy would likely mean US Canada border would allowed open till 2022 even later. Greece announced restrictions unvaccinated, requires proof vaccination enter places 9/13. 

It seem like huge change vaccinated. shit ton breakthroughs happening would benefit well. set Disney fastpass lane vaccinated people... Florida way. [I gotta say might prefer Fauci saying it. That's significantly different 99.8% we're spiking like this. three states NYT dashboard showing 98+%. could accused playing semantics (and comment downvoted assumption I'm denier something, I'm guessing) better strategy underpromise overpromise--with latter, people eager doubt data spread information something incongruent like periodic infection rates outright deception make us distrust experts even more. Even 80% would extremely good, diminishing returns showing rosiest sample/context vaccinated hospitalizations extra percentage points, trade-off fewer people trust numbers get vaccinated. stupider arrogant think smart. people know stupid, stupid people don't. UK vaccinated almost nobody 18 yet. overall high vaccination rate. Almost nobody does, unless pick subset population exclude.

With Alpha saw cases start dropping people 20-40 allowed get first doses. pattern held everywhere. pattern different delta, tipping point same. Maybe it'll boosters, 5-12 vaccination, both.  Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

Most kids could gotten vaccinated least one dose going back school.

But instead 2 months data, FDA wants 6 months.

So fatigue still play sports professionally? Come on. people public announce personal sickness, need study. anecdotes useless, 20 friends likely long term symptoms told you.

My anecdotes useless self study looking like median age 57. know 57 year old suffer fatigue?

Suffering depression anxiety! Imagine that, living lockdown suffering depression.

You really think they're caused directly 6 months acute infection, COVID-19 survivors mainly troubled fatigue muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, anxiety depression. Patients severely ill hospital stay severe impaired pulmonary diffusion capacities abnormal chest imaging manifestations, main target population intervention long-term recovery


The thing that's interest patients actually suffering something actually seen measured. know age. I'd willing bet they're side 57. Nope. like anyone going entertain conspiracy anyway. never then? endemic now. seasonal like flu.    Society cannot held hostage pro-vaxxers, either.

There's lot out-of- season RSV going around too, may SARS-COV-2. yeah, mask + prior infection + vaccine give best protection. worst 24hrs life fine Interesting mental gymnastics go trying somehow justify letting unvaccinated die choices. 

Free people choices. Every choice comes risks rewards, choose balance factors appropriate us. vaccine _probably_ won’t horrible long term side effects, that’s risk take, knowingly willingly, getting it. unvaccinated _probably_ won’t die COVID, that’s risk they’re taking, knowingly willingly.

The idea “zero” “let rip” case. understand small fries 12 infected, therefore potentially infect vaccinated kinda useless. 

Ships floating Petri dishes locking ship bunch people isn’t great idea. stupid stop...   philosophy ""I'll get mine, care anyone else"" shoot foot again, predictably, cause shortages, drive costs leave two choices - vaccinate take super duper dangerous black market drugs they've told take con artists. Disinformation symptom much larger issue: lack critical thinking skills, symptom much larger issue: defunding education system, symptom much larger issue: neoconservative ideology. Taiwan China beg differ. People act like unions fight get workers work less let lazy something. They’re workers protect abuse protect jobs. demonization unions country absurd.  [The numbers Breakthrough cases make fraction total cases. Deaths 94% unvaccinated despite fact unvaccinated minority country. hell gap ""needing hospitalized"" ""a minor inconvenience""

there people debilitating long-covid symptoms never entered hospital Religious exemptions granted people use modern medical facilities required provide ample theological evidence foundational sources specifically related vaccination. Also exemption covid vaccine willingly taken vaccines. required take extreme testing, precautionary quarantine measures granted religious exemption. variants would cooked might infect us much, would probably kill millions extra across globe

Idk, far variants become dominant adaptations make infectious without significant reduction severity. Test came back negative yet still putting situation blast? plenty reasons outside covid symptoms. Ok I’m tri state hopefully policies aren’t different across state lines. positive way look vaccination cuts chances hospitalization covid factor 29.

This possible century ago. took lot hard work lot people get defend ourselves.  Nothing always 100% gotta use layers true many things life layers defense add closer get 100% mark. Reinfections almost always mild / asymptomatic. Makes sense. beat before, body remembers. antivaxers end hospital... law probabilities. give direct equivalenent percentage chances complicated let's pretend similarity. 

How car crash victims, deprioritise seat belt? (that equivalent). cannot arbiters directing gets live die. 

Sure might 'fair' people fall pray hubris, sure fuck withhold healthcare them. Crazy everyone like you, wild world living health department charge Would imagine. lifelong smoker non-smoker need lung transplant, gets priority? convictions change they're struggling breath. enforce it? Agreed. middle school mean girls came 13-14 year old girls assumed high school training material. miserable. got high school upperclassmen shut antics real quick.  also children pre-existing conditions affected viruses like influenza? I'd like see long-term risk C19 also compared viral agents. specifically remember driving work, song came radio. remember song. remember song triggered realization going take months. going take much much longer. pretty much life now.

I broke crying car day. Sure. fat, moved lower list. Smoke? Lower list. Lots casual sex? Lower list. carful psychopaths wish for. People needed help things besides covid couldnt get treatment before, even cases low, hospitals postponing ""elective"" procedures wanted decks clear covid surge many places never materialized.

I'm still outraged mother, battling cancer 2nd time, treated.

At point expecting smart rational behavior ludicrous healthcare system seems like exercise futility. Delta first detected October 2020, many months one believe timeline actively working it, actively working make timeline believable? maybe ideal start one shot J&amp;J wait 6 months get Moderna booster. really unclear everything pre covid public health people made major booboo regards aerosol transmission 60s TB. end result nothing believed airborne threshold airborne very, wrong. I've heard story somewhere before. Wonder turned Holy shit. imagine missing chunks large(prob multiple times) semester. Oof.    Joy rides, fire rescue, sporting events, weather stations, policing, ferries, air cargo, efficient albeit slow travel. Oh wow. flight got Bahamas august 21st…dang that's really BIG IF.....

like peace Middle East, democracy Afghanistan, stopping climate change...   Aragorn would definitely wear mask. Yeah, reason Spanish Flu abated within two years less virulent strains influenza better able infect new hosts deadly strain 1918. 

Granted, strain behaved like many modern strains influenza, likely infected far people first thought since modern influenza strains known 40-60% infected asymptomatic, case 1918, possible burn reservoir people susceptible less severe seasonal strains became dominant due evolution around preexisting immunities.

&amp;#x200B;

The warning Spanish Flu gave us could happen without warning. takes wrong bird meet wrong pig another incredibly serious flu epidemic. 102 years pandemic, scenario play out, coronavirus rather influenza virus. people Los Angeles County five times likely get infected coronavirus 29 times likely hospitalized people fully immunized, newly released data California show.

Just data showing effective vaccines truly are. no. Two weeks flatten curve! Sticks carrots plenty carrots moment feel sticks ate coming. FFS basically rolling dice every fuckin day get vaxxed ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) w x n e ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) unvaccinated people question CHOSE way. help people help themselves? lot recent studies also shown immunosuppressed people often great response vaccine future protection. Best stay safe get immune system recovered some. latest vaccines idea day would see FDA approval affect numbers?  demonstratively false. amount people vaccinated died thus far small. Unless secret trove data want share. 

Also - i'm interested views selfishness. I'm vaccinated dont wear masks stores require it. wear one business requires government mandates it. selfish team? Big true sadly. wasn’t expecting then, idiots did. believe say, say bad faith. want vaccine they'll say anything reinforce idea, regardless believe it. Previous infection almost certainly provides better protection vaccines, 6x going real world data Israel.

I'm looking single study shows real world data higher percentage reinfections previously infected breakthrough infections vaccinated, would justify repeated, hubristic statements vaccines better natural immunity. Oh please. would happened Florida didn’t happen Thanks proving point again. stop digging now.  People still listening dude.  think desperately trying reduce demand masks general public ensure enough left medical professionals.

Somewhat understandable act desperation time, considering collapse health system due sick workers would catastrophic. long term seems like horrible idea. basically nothing going change. Good luck convincing GOP far right well anti vaxxers conspiracy theorist Without better treatments, would decimate world, given long term effects caused. There's also building evidence vaccines greatly reduce rate infection, still unacceptably high rates hospitalization delta. need control numbers get better treatments. accept everyone getting eventually. Ugh, spent junior senior years college quarantine. fucking dread graduating without connections internships could had. getting ready 2nd job fair shit started.  Ok kids sent back school surge transmissible delta? colder months numbers gonna go anyways people spending time inside? peoples’ protection transmission afforded Pfizer dropping like sinking stone booster shots won’t available every age group weeks possibly months?    agree you! math part brain went ""Well there's less beds available people yes eventually decision one bed left"". Sorry nitpick sometimes think ""That's wrong"" feel like pointing out.  actually shows good governor. hard bring back power give it. arent enough vaccinated patients hospital matter. vaccines great job preventing serious illness. Arent something like 85% hospitalized patients unvaccinated?

If matter triage, vaccinated status definitely considered. makes difference. I've seen studies showing vaccinated individuals suffer breakthrough cases need hospitalized fare better.

Of course factors age, obesity, diabetes, etc would considered well. likely young unvaccinated individual would much higher chance surviving elderly obese individual got vaccinated suffered breakthrough infection. 

If trying deny treatment people punishment morally unworthy, that's deeply unethical violation human rights I'm dismayed see people suggesting it. forget WHO, essentially lied avoid run masks... run masks would probably better politics surrounding now. Easter 2022 one Trump talking about?   ""they're paid actors"" believe tpr 30%? Also keep mind covid cases take bed months time France using physical restaurant want serve them, could input personal ID app access gov server check person vaccinated not.

This current system allocating care like survive better fine. deprioritising treatment antivax. someone 30 unvax better chance survival 50 year old diabetes receive treatment.

It struck odd one thing common people. Well outlandish symptoms. They're going see local osteopaths handful different ones spread country. one guy. 

I know he's newest thing promoted antivax crowd connections powerful people circle. Right. Stupid stupid does. Spent lifetime learning that. pandemic, endemic selfishness closely correlates death rate according data available me. Something antivaxxer getting priority double lung transplant irrationally angry. I'm big fan ""the body temple"", find alcohol rip exemption spot. remember told quiet restaurant used work owner saying wear masks loud didn’t want customers hear.  wasn’t expecting months. original estimate April 2021. That’s optimist lol    depend virus becomes long term though. flu makes feel sick couple days, every decently healthy person expects full recovery.

""Long covid"" lifelong lung issues going different impact unless morphs something mild. I’ve seen HIPAA one used stores require customers wear mask. anti-vaxxer claim medical condition prevents wearing one, can’t ask condition violates HIPAA. (It doesn’t, they’re bright enough know that) 400 600k deaths kids. small percentage. Kids going concerts. Let adults go  saw commented r/science, already taken down...

COVID-22 EXIST ARTICLE BAIT.  necessarily, say children using masks school problems learning emotional facing reading, could possibility.

Now, read study, actually says work reduces contagion 21% (although personally counted 36%, I'm sure). masks children work, sample small.

But question asked indeed legitimate. Yeah. pissing extroverts everywhere. cannot stand around people even isn’t serving purpose. Haha Ok, thanks!  100 deaths per day, quite high country size. one arguing winter wave significantly worse, was. Losing 1000 people day horrific. 


But cannot argue deaths flat they've gone 10x past two months. Deaths currently higher historical flu levels, highly vaccinated country. Saying fine things horrifically bad winter seems absurd me. Thank you! :) According CDC last year, masking substitute social distancing. delta variant, CDC recommending masking social distancing? science changed delta variant makes distancing longer necessary? Technically, classified abortion?  Yep, reserves, guard active duty fall set standards comes medical requirements, expect reservists getting vaccinated next couple drill weekends. worn properly, highly likely keep safe. even fucking comparable bad faith comparison used show know nothing diseases listed.

I'm understand mRNA vaccines complicated due fundamental difference traditional vaccines, thus elements general mRNA research (12+ years) applicable specific ""offshore"" speak.   know heard lady NBC news say get vaccine QOUTE ""It approved"". People still get it. people want? vaccine approved ten years?? “The Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) currently monitors hospitalizations deaths, cause, among fully vaccinated individuals COVID-19, breakthrough infections, stopped monitoring May 1”

This copy pasted article. aren’t even monitoring anymore.... data says unvaccinated people higher rate infection tainted since numbers don’t include vaccinated infections... it’s straight manipulation numbers.

I’ve seen someone die emphysema close personal. know it’s thing I’m coming within country mile fate help it. understand frustration work around damn things. barely go week without wanting rip communicate someone.

I would say atleast par delta's infectivity rate.  professional dealings Logan found good speaker competent field. admired guy building company scratch largely-self taught. knew religious fanatic sad hear crazy Q-Anon supporter. idea. New York already variety state occupations health workers. Still better guessing. problem public media can’t accept, “We don’t know yet.” “We won’t know months peer reviewed studies done.” Imagine outcry said that, would truth. People always say want truth, really want answer stated firmly true. different parents toddlers.  Ugh. Sorry. COVID zero may possible, COVID zero nations pursued containment measures aggressively. Keeping cases control allowed sequencing test samples, allowed smaller clusters identified. next days easy, it’ll pay cases go down. less common diseases, trials take longer. baffles much Florida. Wife really leave house go grocery shopping. vaxxed wear masks. see many couples store 1 wearing mask. work?? significant wearing mask basicslly wearing mask. someone deal that?

Ive wife almost 8 years now. covid popped said ""nah, real, I'm gonna wear mask get vaccinated"" relationship would “Half states (25) report data COVID-19 breakthrough events (see Table 1). Twenty-four provide data breakthrough cases, 19 hospitalizations deaths.
Fifteen states regularly update data, often weekly basis. rest use different frequency, one-time reports, stopped updating, unclear reporting frequency.”

This get data? even stopped reporting? 15 states post reliably?
That’s 30% states, mention leaves states...

None thorough all. states aren’t recording hospitalizations deaths?

Why isn’t cdc tracking this. It’s job. states clearly aren’t good job. populations sizes states? states stop tracking? bs  lied I'm betting mine soon! lot “it won’t happen me” jfc, doomed  Exactly general. AntiVax like smoking. get big fat surcharge anything health related. Sounds like medical school open get more, better health workers. Demand health care shooting response be?

Rest world? Really? first day approve it

Great! here’s thing: already happened back **December 2020**.   don’t public school anyone everyone it’s called indiscrimination  Mass protests one best ways get rich powerful cave demands. shame friggin come first place. leave and, hopefully, get paid double somewhere else! gonna extremely heartbreaking, mainly could preventable. poor, future deaths children. Really gone grim fall. Jail life! hey, capital punishment. Think act terrorism deserves death? think so. Congress pass law making illegal health insurance companies pay COVID-19 related medical treatment unvaccinated, excepting medically unable vaccinated. Mumps took 4 years.

The data submitted FDA end date, efficacy shown. next step Republican ovation playbook usually outlaw walkouts.

This crowd said Obamacare would force doctors work want work, right? Schools literally require proof vaccinations k-12. Also done multiple times sure. governor told schools FL they'll lose funding salaries mandate masks students. Seriously called blockbusters continue poorly delta variant concerns. Studios aren’t expecting big returns next Bond Dune even though would big moneymakers time. better worse streaming new way consume content, best IMAX large event films may still prevail 2021. Shitty article.  bunch nut jobs digging heels in. Today local facebook groups I'm part of, organizing stage another protest school board meeting examining mask mandate. new argument masks is, ""It's giving kid anxiety attacks!!""  Terrorism implies premeditated. sounds like got argument, lost temper, tried run over. nurse, could one first vaccinated, shots even conceived second child Comirnaty....hm. Kinda rolls tongue...
 
...and thuds floor. Yes. mean alcoholic chances liver transplant great. smokers pay higher insurance costs nonsmokers. 
Also, diabetics effecting others actions. Pharmacist here, January Ape. 

FDA approval nothing us crushing today :) 

Make informed medical decisions.   didn’t see Canada? There’s plenty crazies too. Spikevax got that’s ballin name Slow vaccine progress million fully vaccinated, concentrated elderly, chronically ill healthcare workers. 

Another large contingent one shot, 60,000 plus jabs given day. 

So we’re vulnerable, it’s still better 2020.

Edit add, NZ 5 million people. answer started ""Yes, support full mandates vaccine everyone get including people good historical reasons mistrust government Black individuals. also support full deprioritization antivaxxers receiving treatment. I'm also willing go far nurses doctors collectively breaking Hippocratic Oath refusing treat willful antivaxxers apparently that's ruthless position take. I'm firmly camp means justifying ends long cost means exceed benefit ends.""

That's real position, apparently even sub consider extreme answer probably ""Yeah definitely gotta safe. Wbu?"" gauging position. I'm sure feel honest. one hand really think getting much world vaccinated possible quickly possible other, selfish hand, really would like 70 year old, high risk mother get booster. sure, minor contributor COVID see matters. matters properly locking using masks, people refusing actual reason deranged ignorance point. asking patients whether vaccinated act accordingly. I'm pretty sure whoever wrote knew that, agenda. Well that's personal choice. COULD please choose to, that's view world. Governments mandating things comfort peace mind happened me!!! hooked girl pre-covid thought cute, come find year later she’s Anti-Vax. ignore texts unfollow social media…I feel bad cause parents brainwashed her.  every country world secured borders

The US really. People cross illegally time. Many cities even offer sanctuary it. Tell recall covid. Serious question. fda approval publicly say Pfizer vaccine marketed “prevention” covid-19 disease individuals 16yrs old older. It’s already proven still contract spread virus vaccine lol. Btw antivaxxer vaccine. don’t underhand fda state something scientifically proven true? pretty sure decided go Panama City  Oh yea ""success story"" UK is. point idc is, muscle, fat, car? fucker pull Gandalf nobody getting through. /r/nottheonion enough nursing students fill current positions let alone existing ones. hospitals 50% 60% vaxxed nursing, short 20% nurses already.... Antivax? think mean pro covid. dodged bullet! possible long term cognitive impact. 10% significant amount!  So.... rather take chances disease killing people hundreds thousands shot makes fatigued day. increase risk spreading disease others, continuing pandemic indefinitely, know blame outlier?

That sounds really smart Beats me. 

Can't speak her, God gave two doses vaccine, courtesy brilliant biologists, engineers, nurses. Plus quality N95 KN95 masks way several high tech factories producing reasonable cost (and skilled engineers workers involved supply chain). I'll gladly pray protection, also give thanks I've given far. I'm glad ceo employee like you, ""BettyDrapersWetFart""! appreciate making sure kids dosages like sorted granting EUA, they’re way cautious. Inb4 idiots saying don’t trust FDA   Honestly, got vaccinated feel extra fatigued everyday now. don’t blame people getting vaccinated, hate see people don’t respect personal choice someone else. 

Go ahead, downvote me. Pre-Delta, fresh Pfizer vaccine pretty close Moderna, even may slightly worse effectiveness. really matter original strain though, like 1/3rd infectious Delta everyone fresh vaccines. Even alpha, controlling spread enough would probably pretty uncommon disease now. 

Now vaccine efficacy waning Delta, differences vaccines starts show better. may different dosing Moderna's dose much much larger, Jesse Jackson wife, mention gov Texas.
If vaccinated need boosters, may end hospitalized. Yes agree, majority probably unvaccinated, think rare. little discussion. every country world secured borders. classic straw man, distract policy really major reason they've controlled thing. know got virus too? did, regionally locked stopped spreading.  good luck finding healthcare workers then. Many millenial healthcare workers know can’t wait pay loans switch careers already. Healthcare sucks Wow. Lots instant judging. one complicated that. Let share experience. 

My wife also nurse. vaccines came skeptical. could something made fast safe? looked explanations worked decided eager get them. eagerly waited available.

Then found pregnant. Pregnancy complicated. woman's body changes lot. lot drugs fine take without baby, ibuprofen tums, discouraged. Many foods discouraged well. Look up. crazy.

So light that, considering everything pregnant woman's body goes through, also considering vaccine brand new type vaccine, pregnant woman get it?

The doctors asked...kinda refused answer. said unknown, boiled personal choice. birth classes took women talked eager get vaccine...after baby came. Birth instructor also refused give clear guidance - exist yet.

My wife encouraged get vaccinated, got shot first day available. drove 2 hours get it.

I'm seeing reports suggest vaccine kill babies. Great. affect brains? affect muscle bone growth? period time growing fast, stem cells turning incredibly complicated systems comprise human body, anyone confident babies completely unaffected mRNA vaccines? I've seen. I've seen ""baby die get vaccine.""

Maybe fine. mothers decide get vaccine, wish nothing less happy, healthy baby.

But maybe not.

So please, reconsider judgement family. going terrible tragedy. need hate top it. maybe unvaccinated patients get unvaccinated doctors nurses, vaccinated get vaccinated ones... might motivate people get vaccinated! substitute salted butter canabutter? Asking friend. hope measured resulting antibodies record. wonder got infected hospital?

Nowadays, usually outside clinical settings, protocols greatly improved PPE sufficiently plentiful. study December showed health care workers infected outside hospital, or, infected hospital, non-clinical areas (break rooms lunch room particularly bad, PPE comes eat). Despite saucy name, Gettr Twitter, Tindr Grindr agree, anti-vaxxers waited FDA approval going move goal posts something else. can't use *this* excuse. old doctors recommending this??  Sorry but, overall intelligent, especially fell dumb shit like Q. Blaming unvaccinated citizens ... groups eligible vaccinated yet. really popular people Ontario + Quebec come Florida vacation. really ""tropical paradise"" vacation spot directly drive to. Unfortunately, question means settled. example: [Neurologic Involvement Children Adolescents Hospitalized United States COVID-19 Multisystem Inflammatory ""In study 1695 patients 21 years younger hospitalized acute COVID-19 multisystem inflammatory syndrome, 365 (22%) neurologic involvement. Forty-three patients (12%) developed COVID-19–related life-threatening neurologic disorders, 11 (26%) died, 17 (40%) survived new neurologic sequelae."" Sorry see live Texas, stay safe  might enough subs make week 3! subs quarantining along students teachers!  vice-versa I've noticed. I've seen one Tinder profile read ""swipe left vaccinated we're going vibe"" thanks filtering selfishness idiocy out. 

I good chemistry going nurse matched found anti-vax. first exposure nurses exempt COVID-denial. 🤦🏿‍♀️  doctor choose resign like job, esp 'muh choice' major thing folks like parrot.   #I’d call it: Pfizer CoVax. So, near-wasteland? business-heavy area, and, since many forced WFH mode, many restaurants around shut permanently. makes think case roughest crew while.

The patient nurse worked times since COVID nurse. roll room get her. heart starts going bit crazy send us tell us come back hour, take ICU stable enough yet.

We got back back hour. anymore. send us operating room.

This nurse butt naked table, surrounded coworkers, balloon pump now, unconscious, intubated hooked defib. shock twice still operating room. wheel team 5 people. pushing drugs constantly, shocked another time back. chaos, remember lot.

After done looked record. 39 years old, medical problems all. last time admitted hospital 10 years ago, giving birth kid.

That's floored us right there.

This woman 10 year old kid sitting home body absolutely wrecked disease. one said COVID yet, there's lot reasons perfectly healthy non-smoking woman gets blood clots like this.

It's 7 months since happened. COVID. still well enough work. lungs might never regain full use heart lost 20%.

That might user reaction did. Ultimately, internet hard place discuss sensitive topics like lot lots communicate solely text, misunderstandings commonplace Well, it’s worth, hung with/spoke face-to-face m/took drink dude tested positive next day. 

I Never got symptoms, never tested positive. Maybe wait long get infected_pussy checked tho. Thank you, tired anti nurse rhetoric. Lots us shots.     Full approval giving people year without approval. Amazing  Yes, virus actually eradicated like polio was, one way another. otherwise simply means total pain, death disability long run. should, major red flag    parts world like parts Asia continued use masks regularly

People masks Singapore pre-COVID sick. Singapore also stance CDC Fauci initially regards masks pandemic first started. also reversed course within week CDC evidence asymptomatic spread. difference political leaders Singapore implemented mask mandate immediately, took time effort explain needed led example via wearing masks themselves. also national campaign (multiple time actually) give masks everyone. 100% compliance within week mandate.

Point is, highly underestimating deleterious effect previous administration mask wearing. think polio would fuck up, Covid didn’t though. logic applied every vaccine ever made actually you’re selfish one don’t every single vaccine *Nearly year ago Rock South two weeks ago, Trump rally last weekend Depot days month.

my HS dropout friends facebook know WAAAAY pathogens fancy *doctor*.


(obligatory /s) Yes, testing plateaued.. Cases likely much. Wow 2 years pandemic second wave worse? Man wonder heard I'm surprised dogs start eating him. I've heard pets that. Hell even humans get hungry enough. dogs must really loved 💔 know Canada went 12 weeks first reduced 8 weeks (and 7 - 4 weeks). interesting see immunity works also vaccinated around January - mainly 85+ health care workers.

Canada also one places allows mix matching - AZ mRNA pfizer moderna.  week! That's even long enough decline infections. cases still pre lockdown. That...doesnt sound bad me? people get vaccine want  doctor know read understand English. Go ahead, cite exact quote consider lie.  What’s Florida?? Tylenol knocked mine like nothing.  data collected end 2020-june 2021. Making data set pretty robust. numbers (% vaccinated hospitalized) likely higher since there's cases vaccinated. data rings true vaccinations prevent COVID-19 hospitalization death significantly.

Recent CDC data shows there's 25 fold decrease hospitalizations death vaccinated people.

CDC  Good hear! 😋 look figures current hospitalizations included article. 

Pretty wild still see people downplaying vaccine efficacy here. 


“As Aug. 23, Alabama 2,721 adults 41 pediatric patients hospitalized COVID-19. adult inpatients, 84% unvaccinated, 4% partially vaccinated 12% fully vaccinated” [America solves pandemic life saving vaccine spring sorry hear passing. saddening hear mindless behavior leads others passing. offered some... *intimate experiences* people would kill get 10th shot know, Singapore initial recommendation CDC Fauci preserve supplies healthcare workers. Masks initially recommended one knew prevalence asymptomatic spread. declared strong evidence that, CDC/Fauci Singaporean changed stance within week other.

The difference? Singapore 100% mask compliance within week via mandate. That's leaders held national broadcast explain masks needed followed policy ensure people wore masks.

The fucking stupid take one's political leaders exact opposite.  politicized before? politicized minute decided politicize virus. people fall politicization already entrenched team. Fauci alienating thst already alienated point? That's licenses; pulled need be. Sounds like guy needs find new line work. heard one before... ""documentaries"" mean found Brookyln 99 Jake goes jail gang leader wants Ramen ? thread found accuracy it. False, like shortage ignorant assholes there. cheering results. shows way protect oneself society, actually simple. would much worse studies showed little protection vaccines. 

Having said feel pain, hope parents safe. square stuff like this... guess specify uptick Covid (though obviously implying it) else would lots children suddenly going hospital? guess I'm jaded. let die already? (I know answer, spare suffering doctors etc - people really feel (aside idiots vax)). Also trial. 1st dose slightly sore arm (less flu shot). 2nd felt like bit hangover next day. able provide CDC card. Ask give one!!!! Yep, we're thankful. wearing mask asshole move, period. shamed, act like ""doing right thing"" assignment, humane considerate thing cookie giving COVID others. anything news bummed more, really hoping would now. Another year crap gonna brutal. CDC suggesting outdoor masks. evidence wearing masks outdoors ever anything all? think so.

I would suggest interventions centered vaccination, considering Rt value Oregon suggest surge peaking 

Getting people vaccinated so, much important absurd outdoor mask mandates, wasting single minute dollar promoting enforcing outdoor mask mandates finding new ways get people vaccinated. remember mom texting January/ February thinking oh it’ll like SARS really make here- somehow graduated degree public health year beginning, epidemiologists saying would never end entire world free it, voices drowned freedums

Yes, stupid people hand control rights non-elected health officials.  don’t understand fines work anyways, cruise ships go somewhere, location requires proof vaccination (Such Bahamas) Disney fulfill requirements without it?  way much wanted say something, refrained would escalate everything point. Plus wife cared would following basic CDC guidelines. Nah Maybe, we’ll see though. don’t think faculty super harmed, almost gotten vaccine  Honestly, none. point, additional interventions use backfire.  vaccines typically given otherwise healthy individuals, generally subject regulatory scrutiny medical products, including prescription drugs. Full approval means Pfizer vaccine carries FDA’s strongest endorsement safety effectiveness. We're pretty much already we? Nothing closed far know.

Also, still 1 million people getting vaccinated every day, think everyone made minds vaccine. bad? Patient over-exaggerates wound, nothing new. Also GSW neck would said so. study (a Danish study, one extensive one), found 15% reduction infections masked people. However, difference statistically insignificant percentage can’t concluded based it. 

Also, study masks protecting bearer, stopping infecting others.

They arent treatment literally kicking road get actual treatment.  Ah good old TB, last summer deadliest infectious disease world...

Wuhan shutting big ""Oh fuck"" moment.  Robbing Peter pay Paul? National Guard troops fill NG health care positions usually full part time civilian health care jobs. two developers report supposed back country March 17 2020 (had gone back home visit.)…yeah stuck. Somewhere, somebody's uncle reading comment saying ""but vote democrats"" yes, Florida/Mexico border according DeSantis. live South want vaccine mandates people standing way Southern politicians.  disappointing. never truly pandemic kids get vaccine. Without &lt;12 vaccinations Delta going completely wreck schools semester force many shut in-person classes again. last year's virus, precautions took work well time. entering uncharted territory here. considered mild medical sense - didn’t need go hospital - sucked/still sucks. Never fever, pretty much everything else. Chills, body aches, headache, sinus pressure, back pain, extreme fatigue, coughing low-ish blood oxygen (lowest got 91%). first two half days worst, I’m 21 days post infection still cough, post-nasal drip, fatigue/weakness zero sense smell (about 60% taste though). received second Pfizer shot early April. Based everything I’ve read personal experience, I’m wondering outcome would worse protection via vaccine. Recent bugs discovered pushed release back 2022 Here’s free hint consulting firms Biden administration wasted millions failing come with: pay people tax vaccine. $250 first shot, $350 second. gets $600 missing $2000 checks Biden promised “day one.” 

I’ll accept cash, card, even cashier’s check. You’re welcome, America. Oh, *proned.* Thanks! Thank this. ICU beds always 90%+ occupied anyway. ICU beds dynamic, amount changes day day, even theres pandemic, based need. learn hard way; others never learn. can't afford get tested real numbers actually known (Kaiser, UPMC remember right) OK magical. 

Prob need big gov cheese thing.  rate going, catching realistic outcome point unvaccinated. matter time complete hermit.   someone early 20s, thank you. It’s obnoxious people trying make living lives taboo, especially vaccination. beginning pandemic ny boss died like three days contracting covid, cant imagine terrifying waiting amount time treatment live upstate NY, well away tragedy happened “early days” pandemic. Late January paying attention reports China. Late February decided sure shit going down. gradually increased grocery shopping, extra box bag staples there. Extra pack meat freezer, bag rice hand couldn’t get dog food, stuff like that. March 13th told coworkers we’d shut end month. got laughed at. Scoffed at. Told crazy buying fear panic. Last day non essential operation exactly week later March 20th. aren’t laughing now...luckily one personally know died, Delta fear worst yet come. It’ll definitely interesting boosters. Especially considering CDC currently goes US saying isn’t recommending people get boosters. I’m sure change guidance soon antivaxxers going cling initial statement We're still lot supply chain issues across every industry.

Things normal. arent included anymore FL DOH decided change report deaths.

Question - make change now?... Like time goal 100,000,000 vaccines given bidens first 100 days?

And course that, no, 200,000,000 doses instead Could've encouraged people make masks supply increased.

They though. very, beginning pandemic, distinctly remember using CDC website make cloth mask Star Wars material laying around. definitely encouraged that. wish websites would stop saying “Our European visitors important us” It’s three years now. lmao  Depends live. Ontario, Canada children need parents permission get vaccine. activities entire month? doubt needs exactly 8 months.  AFAIK, ACA allows health insurers raise premiums smoking status. However, insurers employers could offer discounts wellness incentives - change premium, would pay less vaccinated individual unvaccinated one. Man college still like 100% online :/ taking many classes online learning isn’t worth me. disrupted hell schedule graduation it’s whatever I’ve never rush. estimates based everyone pulling weight. FDA approval weeks, like age groups. unless insider data weak something, take long, assuming Pfizer submits approval end September. actual numbers, would brainer take vaccine dont 100% getting covid.

But actually like 0.01% chance bad reaction like 0.01 10% dying based age groups factors.

I think young people look numbers see even unvaccinated hardly chance dying covid that's one thing, elderly people, vaccine could TEN TIMES dangerous currently think would STILL orders magnitude safer taken vaccine. supply crunch masks prioritized medical staff.

Made sense then, still makes sense now. Who's ready 2021 Thanksgiving Christmas case surges!? placed stomach hopefully recruit lung area never wrong ... knows everything ... 2nd cumin' something like totally agree! group effort effects every single person country. can't people part others. Im many mandates resturants, events, ect make difficult live normal life eventually get vaccinated. allow someone smoking walk public buildings continue smoke, effects health around them. thing. want part get FDA approved vaccine saves lives, get privilege going certain places. Businesses every right deny someone based wearing mask vaccinated. rights taken away.  mean, would mainly people copying pasting news articles calling Nostradomus.

A interesting hilarious subreddit would people saying big deal back then. Can't US end situation states zero deaths per week COVID start acting ""other"" states problem? That’s lie tell “there always time” Yep - China lot vaccines sending out, people less enthusiastic (partly due Western media fearmongering) really matter aren't, fact protesting vaccines...they're protesting vaccine mandates. call stupid, heavily implying understanding comment.

I also know tons people vaccinated supportive mandates. everyone thinks people disagree held forced to. ZERO scientific reason treated differently someone vaccinated. forced placate people like can't sack move life? 

I'm lower risk every vaccinated person going work walking bars restaurants infected previously. someone really stupid see non-sensical. Again, calling stupid implying it. hope little nibblings live south. Florida Alabama. stressing fuck they're surrounded reckless people. guy fucking insane needs fired ASAP. Taken context seem implying vaccine nothing reduce spread that's true.

Infected individuals contagious regardless vaccination, infections less likely vaccinated. Angeleno good point! really focus cases beginning week July 11th, since that's LA County Health realized Delta escalating brought back indoor mask mandate. two weeks! Absolutely kind thing shifts culture. Makes people realise important them.  Yeah wait 2 hours get covid test LA june 2020. would worked actually though. problem didn't. Back february major challenge model disease progression use really fancy math account disease ""pods"" randomly dying out. systematically crushed pods came would never gained foothold. Wild type *THAT* infective. something reproduce point, would worked. Delta's breaking vaccinated. Even large portion infections asymptomatic mild symptoms, still replicating. means opportunities mutations affect current immunity, via vaccine natural infection.

We hear lot worries mutations arising among unvaccinated, bouncing around vaccinated, too, likely matter time Delta Doubleplus whatever decide call it.

(And anyone misconstrues I'm saying, yes, go get gd shots already haven't, still best protection we've got right now, gets better layering additional mitigations strategies like masks, distancing, washing, etc.) wife processing cases Anthem (high paid, RN, manages team 30 RN's) they're used normal hospitalizations.  


She's said thing. People arriving ER dead even initial claim processed. They're basically open/shut deaths. retire spring 2022 win lottery. Turned onto stomach. told 'em hoard toilet paper? people right thing got vaccine ASAP missed $100? Yeah that'd suck planning go Hawaii November work remotely -- made plans friends June book anything. anything, think planning trip Hawaii year advance exception.  elaborate mean work way 💀 sad can't really grieve trivial (very valid) things dying never stops. Hahahaha *Alabamian  heat caskets, smh could also get control student loan debt school cheaper, it’s Immune system primer! Yes, that's trying say.

The difference remember early stages COVID-19 fewer countries numbers based 'tests' 'diagnoses' unless cases (then could expensive testing. China's early numbers based testing. 

I agree fair appropriate adjust numbers select countries. important keep mind early data probably skewed lower numbers later data. “Two weeks stop spread “…my God young innocent. Unfortunately, need hospitalized heart attacks, strokes, get simple operations diagnose cancer getting care need due high numbers covid infected, mostly unvaccinated, people hospital. Unvaxxed people siphon health care people really really need. live florida texas, heart attack need medical care, God help you. Comirnaty sounds like name Sherlock Holmes villain. ""back zero time"" ... fuckin' liars mean, Spanish Flu dropping healthy young people left right, flu still brutal virus catch (not sure you’re getting feeling sick couple days, mean common colds? flu knocks ass flat feels godfuckingawful), long term aftereffects associated it, decent amount people still killed annually. I’m sure wouldn’t able get similar place corona time learn develop more/better treatments. What’s day job? Example actually moving goalposts?  It’s hysteria. It’s literally scientists saying. completely uninformed guess valid people phds field? count seeing awhile. variant specific boosters are, far know, still early testing, even then, Pfizer. Moderna investigation see worthwhile last heard.

On plus side, mRNA vaccine engineers chose target wisely. spike protein targeted mutates slowly, all, since mutation generally reduces virus' ability either spread, infect/infiltrate cells. Neither conducive variant's survivability. simply boosting immunity spike protein still pays dividends current variants concern, even Delta. arguing this, literally asking questions I'm sure answer to:

1. FDA approvals postmarketing requirements/commitments like this?

2. knowing long term impacts even stress believe vaccines benefits far outweigh possible negatives?  ""We can't pretend extra special..."" That's done failures slapped face. One benefit full approval many places (including large employers) feel comfortable mandating vaccine. non-vaxed person risks losing job likely get jab. incredibly rare  Fwiw Jesse Jackson's wife vaccinated. Might? Won’t. Wellness plans give modest incentives vaccinated

So...Hike rates $x, give $x discount vaccinated? It’s dangerous feelings, seem get hurt quite often trivial shit. Where? fair, original approval date couple years now? studies found vaccines safe pregnant women. followed 35,700 vaccinated pregnant women, rate complications normal rate complications unvaccinated pregnancies. largest study, half dozen smaller studies found result.

It inexcusable official sources like FDA FAQ still say ""there evidence vaccines pregnancy"" pages. true 2 months ago. evidence. vaccines safe. officials poor job targeted fighting misinformation, people paying price. 

For people concerned post-vaccine fertility: ""TL;DR: **Yes people phase 3 trial got pregnant vaccination. difference rates pregnancy vaccine placebo groups**. one vaccine group trouble pregnancy course study. also tested female rats find problems, either fertility pregnancy.

The Pfizer vaccine FDA report give nice summary like this, report 23 people became pregnant trial. report 2 adverse events related pregnancy, placebo group.

Both companies say continue monitor pregnant people. general, know reason vaccine would affect fertility. believe ever before. mRNA technology new-ish, radically different would reason believe fertility would affected. hand, growing evidence covid-19 affect fertility.""

Wfh thing makes tolerable.   got Covid antibodies, waste vaccine them? goes show although Florida gets absolutely ripped on, miles ahead alot states (including Alabama) terms vaccination rate. Florida 51% fully vaccinated.  I’ve pulled times covid officer mask on. top this, actually asked take mask told covid didn’t exist particular sheriff’s town.  Okay. find fault nurse/mother baby died? There's shockingly high amount anti-vax nurses. 100% speculating here, based I’ve read, much seems type and/or level antibodies virus / vaccination. Beyond gets real sciency 🤷‍♀️ waste shots people just
 acquired immunity?  agree. point view, though, they’re making money hand fist thanks unvaccinated. someone plans lose weight start exercising: completely right.

Do, not. ""plan someday."" They’ve already saying it’s “not vaccine”, whatever hell that’s supposed mean. don’t believe word comes mans mouth me, honestly, yeah, quite bit worse. mean, think going die anything, certainly... 

Still, pretty much immobilized discombobulated initial fever must have, points, reached least 103-104, around 8 12 hours. strange thing, second especially third shots, fever much higher normally reach even actual infections...

Anyway, even that, still felt like garbage, low grade fever overall body aches lasted least another 8 12 hours. Low grade body aches continued beyond awhile, 32 36 hours finally back normal, mostly. Even gotten shot 2:00 PM EDT Saturday , arm still hurts injection site, that's pretty much expected, honestly bad...

Note take meds (2 x Tylenol tablets) well high grade fever resolved, mostly I'm little paranoid medications impacting immune response vaccine. Even then, took work stuff avoid Sunday night. willing take Tylenol earlier, fever likely bad you.

On plus side, like mentioned earlier conversation thread, immense immune response vaccine least suggests immune system takes seriously, well prepared fight Covid wild...

Regardless, best luck! Gonna tough year dems happens. FDA approvals, insurance companies going crack whip. Actually bad analogy, I'm surprised. man knows Dreamworks Animation movies, respect that. Religious zealots bet. That’s unethical. 

Should gay men denied insurance higher risk HIV? fat people denied fat? 

It opens huge rabbit hole. *if* Yes I’m sure you’re right much data children adults approved it. also collecting data covid hospitalization death, finding children much less risk age group. obviously death one child many deaths. found young adults, specifically males, often experience heart issues related vaccine older adults. I’m sure they’re cautious ensure risk doesn’t keep going age goes down. 

I wish best family. Stay safe there. hell bullshit.


If take immunosuppressants, get extra vaccinated. called non-sequiter.

Obesity contributes comorbidity rate, nothing contraction disease; ability citizens protect others following advice medical community.

An educated populace essential battle misinformation, America clearly lacking department. Notice start misinformation delta transmission affected vaccines switch another talking point since shown wrong groupthink let take new information learn it. Yeah I'm shocked anyone expected otherwise people lacking self awareness empathy.  means more. There's also rather high vaccination rate (I think relatively high):

71% 12+ US 1 dose, consider 73% high long plan wait going back normal then? likely COVID stay. wait another year? 5 years? spend rest life home? Personally, draw line point vaccines available ages everyone opportunity get + time takes shots fully effective. nurse, second vehemently . they're protesting vaccine mandates, protesting 2 years ago employment hospital almost certainly mandated host vaccines? discover love freedom? Or, perhaps onslaught misinformation calls self-identify ignorant ideology caused change.

If intelligent enough good job (or even not), likely forced show proof vaccination eventually. worry though, nothing afraid of. going okay, big guy. Well, plan required mayority Americans trust science behave cared lives people course never gonna work. sound hear 102,000 LSU fans slamming car doors going get vaxxed.  Hold bit. ill-informed rural simpletons dying off, ironically, might make america great again. POOPY PANTS eh? many people vaccinated control COVID. Things moderately normal even Delta. keeps moving goal points.0 Remember everyone blamed Trump's incompetence able fix Covid?

Then: Trump's fault

Now: Trump's supporters fault   Meanwhile:

[...as many 80 percent elementary-aged kids haven’t COVID gotten vaccine catch virus schools don’t regularly conduct COVID tests require students staff wear face 80% next 60 days. majority stupid get vaccinated. I'm saying understand clinical addiction fundamental level feel like trying educate reddit post. Addiction choice -- chronic disease. 

Now going try argue initial act taking drug choice correct, addiction takes hold, longer case.

But still going pretend addiction petulant idiot refusing take vaccine proven safe, proven effective keeping one overloaded hospital system. frustrating. Sending kid ‘mask optional’ school week kid-sized KN95. hope keeps safe. y’all wonder people won’t get vaccinated. said lied make us relax, lying “for greater good” never ends well  speculating. wasn’t “announcement”.

I’m gonna hold breath waiting everyone get page. think part excellent medical infrastructure.  grew Utah live next door Nevada.  Utah generally cases Nevada fewer deaths.  

I think resources treat patients. Well less education quite extremely unhealthy individuals America. 


The amount people obese obscene. reason obesity celebrated among many made hospitalizations deaths covid much much worse.   can’t wait majority people vaccinated. Q people go “people get vaccinated suddenly covid stops? Coincidence? deep state conspiracy?”  kids got expanded pfizer trial jabbed 2 weeks ago study people asked said 2-5 study part bigger 2-11 think vaccines approved data in, 2-5 data also ready. would October later. schools starting really wish 5-11 would approved soon data September. Nothing patriotic seething contempt fellow countrymen /s. Even New Zealand going gravitate away ""zero COVID"" vaccination numbers high enough, they're delusional. Children likely able receive vaccines time, even reason start move away zero COVID. Lol   sense, period history generation always look back on, similar way World War II defined period. Attitudes, culture, art, psychology, lifestyles, much immutably sculpted stupid fucking virus. Fuck this. beginning. March Fauci nightly news scoffing idea general public wearing masks.

Eventually yes came around recommended people make find buy revisionist history pretend started that. shows good initial antibody response. says nothing best time point giving booster. Many studies looking that. California overall 22% ICU capacity compared normal non-covid yearly average 25-27%. 


California seemingly learned due lag time implementing measures results, aggressive positivity rates go up, completely destroy hospital system. venting. Fully vaccinated went movies today NJ.. sign door says “masks recommended” another patron yelled needed mask. 2 weeks ago went movies person wearing mask (even workers). Fuck shit. I’ve done right things, real tired it. Shaming people masks recommended really pretty shitty parent two teens, believe pre-Delta legitimate risk/reward analysis couldn’t really judge either side. heart inflammation side effects (particularly teenage boys) still present, numbers showed overwhelming majority cases manageable symptoms.

Delta’s emergence definitely changed that. don’t care old fuck says. vaccinated people end icu. literally get floated icu every day see every time walk work documentation says vaccinated. also worked first second wave state high compliance vaccines like Florida even Delta variant, vaccinated cases nowhere near bad first wave. clear causative link, correlative link, vaccinations reducing likelihood ending icu/needing vent/needing serious medical intervention.

Vaccines help reduce severe symptoms true vaccines decades. new fact either. long established.

The accurate point emphasized unvaccinated people particularly anti vax nutjobs. lot also immigrants people poorer neighborhood. There's decent demographic black people never trust vaccines anytime soon either they're convinced institutional discrimination completely gone long stories people refused treatment given poor quality treatment keep surfacing, bet skepticism stay.

Doesn’t matter we’re entering deadly wave pandemic, it’s hurting right people. Uh, Detroit Tigers baseball team. post college football team Louisiana. Hello, Fully Vaxxed (USA). However frustration eternal rise cases reaching near limit. I’m saying is, pandemic ever control. Considering high number unvaccinated constant emergence new variants require booster shots (of anti-vaxx won’t get) feels like we’ll stuck forever.

I’m sorry I’m exaggerating I’m plain frustrated we’re back mask mandates stuff. antibodies antibodies 

Yeah [actually Covid definitely want. How??? Vaccinated Unvaccinated still spread virus.  Yes sure. never really stopped wearing mask went places. didn’t go much. Basically grocery store like post office ship something. I’ve always nut washing hands wasn’t new routine me. nothing fool proof point. Going everything avoid it. Good luck hope continue improve. Ya think? way, ha.  ""If Americans vaccinated"", good luck that... Imagine graduating med school pre-pandemic overwhelmed bullshit. Biden administration pushed insurers deny coverage unvaxxed encouraged states triage them? *laughs SARS-COV-3* live stupid, inefficient capitalist system insists one anything outside profit incentive. people, translates needing get paid get life saving vaccine. others, means $100 helping offset loss taking unpaid time either get vaccine sick day effects. 

Don't hate player, hate game. think 2020 longer entertain opinions anyone follows opinions ""You'll see!""

I've heard much last year always trailing weird conspiracy nonsense. Look uk variants concern data then. address mental health children anti vaxxers anti maskers parents. visit r/FloridaCoronavirus every day believe me, lot people care. lot terrified families.

Highly recommend people visit sub get real picture what's happening there. PCR test results taking 7 days even find test. Testing pretty much capacity reported case numbers much lower probably are. Urgent Cares overwhelmed. really bad. Written pre-Delta... OP saying want wear masks social distance. Please, want neg it. I'd like hear side decide neg comment.  virus mutating 2020 vaccine that's viruses do. vaccinated bodies hostel viruses. Unvaccinated bodies breeding grounds. Think well equipped fortress vs trailer broken door. 

Listen I'm gonna convince you. I've lost alot people virus. alone terrified, went quick, caught much worse before. Like know, choice, loved ones consequences purpose third dose immunocompromised many didn’t mount good immune response two doses. already made immune response two doses, would need booster recommended interval anyone would get. planned 8 months vaccinated earliest, details determined ACIP meeting next week. Like said, still early tell. therefore can't make proclamations time everyone accept going get masks/no distancing. weekly vs daily updates big deal?

A part job deals looking local covid data help company work plan coming months. daily data jumps around quite bit... weekly data far useful us.  I’m sorry loss. :( we're lucky remember piles articles said masks work, get one, stupid reputable sources. 

How much damage did.  It’s always toss up, it’s true odds toss land change based immune health. Mine too!! made happy see this. would fair. person made choice vaxed, fitting honored putting bottom list. socially, yes. 

Is covid less contagious vaccinated? signs sadly starting point no. 200 400 Texas hospitals reported data federal government fewer four staffed adult ICU beds given time.

There's lot tiny hospitals Texas, appropriately, since large area population sparse places. Usually overflow gets sent somewhere else nowhere else go. Everything full, sick might well stay home take chances.

There chart middle article showing spike end worst spike pandemic, things worse ever Texas before. refers hospital beds full, case count death count, 30% January peak rising.

This dangerous spike pandemic, lock restrictions, less half population Texas fully vaccinated.

If Texas acts like India, Delta form sharp spike drop quickly rose. peak rapid descent. Let's hope peak happens soon people suffering.  Sane people see wrtiting wall
Vax needed work school travel
Get keep card safe
Wear mask around unknowns
Ignore fools there
Until rest world gets shot covid stays get stronger 
Survival fittest now
Vax mask distance others protection viruses 
Check mask blow lighter candel double up
You help others refuse listen science 
As said strong survive world madness witness People choose get vaccinated make conscious moral choice care others well themselves, instead choose themselves, themselves, matter may affect people around them. 

If front two people, age, basic health infected COVID-19. One vaccinated chose good reason (actual medical reason like immuno-compromised etc). save one them. 

Do choose one made moral decision take precautions least try protect others around them

Or choose one made conscious decision ignore safety others good reason? It’s FDA approved excuse!!! (Unless doctor tells get ofc) Great work Doc.  

I’m sorry Americans spoiled. earliest days fight vaccines appointments sat computer getting doses elderly neighbors even obvious difference would make. Keep good work. It’s slippery slope. What’s next? two patients heart attack one obese? Diabetic patients don’t take proper care themselves? decides worthy care isn’t? guess Easter 2022 whole time.  know communism bad Vietnam done really good job Covid overall? good thing isolate stop spread? 

Of course good isolate stop spread. simply telling people say home going work. live alone, need go buy food? medication? everyplace delivery service. happens need pick child? what? everybody support network near live. 

If want people stay home, state needs provide support. Something like number call, state sends someone provide help. Otherwise, worthless simply tell people stay home. 

This course, challenging do, countries decided set quarantine facilities people isolate. still built different. Wtf ""ethicist""? We're making labels everything huh? Lots ofnplaces open. fact, shut everything country dies. go ""essential"" businesses get supply chain messes, recession, worse...more small businesses dying. exactly like good choices here. frankly, Disney employs lot people...people would need supported Disney closed. shut downs really work shut everything. really good answer pandemic take care, get vaxxed, keep pushing forward.  …and none changes fact vast majority country living nothing happening. statement state right correct all. stated majority country living normal poster pointed out. Okay, know sound like really dumb question COVID doesn’t change know body’s immune system. I’ve heard much conflicting information months brain fried point.

I’m fully vaxxed five months ago. Could anyone ELI5 daily boosting immune system (i.e. staying hydrated, taking vitamins, etc.) make difference preparing body better response somehow exposed COVID? kind toss-up point body react regardless state immune system?  got Moderna. would taken anything personally preferred J&amp;J one shot. effective ask for! 

There still think 5 billion people without access isn’t cool get sad about. think FDA take whatever data getting account, including hospitalization rate 12 crowd county climbing. vaccine 12s adults -- reducing symptoms break throughs, reducing hospitalization rate break throughs, reducing deaths break throughs -- benefit public health approved.

On side, I'm desperately hoping Pfizer Moderna J&amp;J others working delta-tune increase effectiveness vaccine. could get administered single shot booster, could minor enough change authorization simple bridge instead full fledged study, would huge. argument argument still need prepared cautious people vaccinated not. 
They running around like illiterate back normal may never be. 
So understand point view every one actually seeing that. reposted updated thought, nope, last year 3/4 unfriended anyone spread misinformation verifiably incorrect, especially left corrected comments. patience ""well opinion"" fact opinion, incorrect. level stupid one got something like this. Medical professionals triage time. limited resource (ICU level healthcare) people actively taking steps end there, triage them? know say slippery slope-but literally happens day day ER's.   dark path want go down. Exactly, hate posts. Like surprised vaccine supposed right peak antibody production. Let's wait see data third-dose efficacy February 2022. That's data wanna need shot every four months, going long, long haul get end this.

People want get doses. every single dose, fewer fewer people vaccinated. key problem booster idea. Even though vaccines safe, while, risks outweigh benefits, least me. Man, remember dogpiled reddit saying maybe wear masks, narrative useful general public (thanks CDC). magical idea on-line learning December 2021. teachers get vaccinated Pzifer shot children 5 11 come everyone go school safely majority kids vaccinated full immunity. Even OP admits so…  really like word low.  Another person lives longer vaccine  ultimate problem people give shit covid ER

&amp;#x200B;

How delusional wear mask even risk dying 100% beyond me. laid bed bit. Flu like symptoms. still bad congestion. Could've much worse vaccinated! annoying unvaccinated husband gave okay couple days. do? like constant variant chase? Absolutely can’t due age medical condition, unvaccinated absolute back line. Treat dead last.  Except delta variant mattered son law vaccinated. yeah, us right now. 50 cases per day 700 month half. shit's hit fan. not. instructed state police unlawfully seize scientists electronics leaking actual covid numbers year ago. He’s criminal jail.

The question is, state federal courts see way?

You rando cry illegal acts, unless legal authorities say illegal open case him, he's going charged shit, much less come within sniffing distance prison precedent power so.

These procedural guidelines, criminal law. face censure impeachment legislature then, approved actions government.

Don't get wrong, loathe DeSantis fanatical following attracts, let's illusions actually hold account. people government willing mount campaign dispose him, possible. supported people people impotent. Yes. Further, CHOSE go unvaccinated; CHOSE ride virus (if caught it) let immune system handle it. take medical care away CHOSE protected, protection failed them.  yeah mean entirely predictable. pandemics always end socially end scientifically. thats without vaccines. United States far higher share seniors without full vaccine protection many wealthy countries, key risk factor driving serious Covid-19 illness death, Times analysis Delta variant torn across country, America’s pace vaccinations sped months relative stagnation, full federal approval Pfizer vaccine Monday could extend momentum. half Americans fully national averages mask high rate older Americans remain deeply vulnerable. Older people still account Covid-19 deaths, many counties, especially South Mountain West, seniors without full vaccination make 10 percent total swaths populations counties healthy Americans, 60, vaccinated,” said Claire Hannan, executive director Association Immunization Managers. “These people extreme risk, don’t realize think job inherently dangerous even don’t die. cop goes whole shift doesn’t die doesn’t mean car chase accident scene busy highway wasn’t dangerous. Firefighters also nowhere lists since don’t die often either, wouldn’t say running burning building isn’t dangerous didn’t die day.

Edit: wether someone dies factor job dangerous not. It’s literally insane think that. many things taken account. It’s personal risk tolerance. Case counts Clark County seem peaked time tell. using NPI help stem spread. would go without hesitation things stand today. I’ve flown several times pandemic didn’t really problems. 

Nobody tell though it’s comfort level. others travel party think? Dude I'm one turned virus political...im getting vaccine running restaurants bars ""save"" economy make employer rich...  true. also means shouldn’t blamed whole problem part it. 

And blaming vaccinated highest vaccination rates country unfair. 

Blame Boomers actually done done; there’s plenty material work with. COVID vaccination rates aren’t one them. Comirnaty sounds like high school gym coach. 


""OK LISTEN UP! NAME JOHN COMIRNATY WE'RE GONNA GET THINGS STRAIGHT..."" know, thought 12-16 released like oh wow 11 year olds hit middle school year it’ll cool 97% old enough vax 2% 11 year olds ok.

Then district sends cities vac rate ages 12-16 62% vaccinated.

So surprised assumed eligible kids would get it, area hig vac educated whatnot.
So hope 12s get approved it’s widespread adoption it.  It’s easy though: 

Antivax, etc people irredeemably selfish. wish reap benefits society without responsibilities.

If won’t duty, deserve helped.

Inductive reasoning baseless speculation. big caveats go along article: one schools study spent $1,400 per student Covid measures. That’s exactly $1,400 vast majority schools US able spend. 

The school mom works rural Oklahoma isn’t anything all, except telling kid stay home they’re sick. Students don’t quarantine family member sick; come school, questions asked. mask requirement, either. 

While don’t believe schools *have* super-spreaders, it’s near certainty many WILL.

(Edited remembering read hard) great news, free country there's requirement organizations let take part.  Australasia like 20 - 25% fully vaccinated, fairness they're trying suppress spread instead, lot plausible remote. collected nationally, states localities tracking cases vaccination status.

VA: Diego County: , page data last month

VA give purty graphs cases per 100K vax unvax, gap vax unvax obvious. San Diego, combine vaccination data get this: quoted things Trump said turned false wind repeating everything says. Hmmm, must something else offer everyone likes. Let get back that... learn million times faster efficiently good online courses

Then what's excuse? Dr. Collins wasn’t making statement fact. Based context, view. would get better 5G reception bonus! ..Ok it’s even fun anymore joke. bet someone would actually take seriously say “see see slipped up” No, reasons legitimately . even give vaccine people allergic. hospital, give IV Benadryl epinephrine ready, doctors ready intubate monitor hours. husband ER doctor done patients' allergists multiple times already. Rheumatologists recommending lot patients still get vaccine. Pregnant women, American College Obstetrics Gynecology Society Maternal fetal Medicine stated pregnant women absolutely getting vaccine. 12 age group still waiting on, can't get it. able soon. true reasons one can't get vaccine. Religious waivers rejected states schools. *revised* positions based new information, like increased transmissibility virus new variants, studies show asymptomatic transmission. He's making shit expediency making shit later. feel like i'm one thread care stuff. never went graduations. graduated college pandemic wanted degree. even celebrate. wanted move on. agree, think forever life changing disease world going live with, several years. one wants admit  point decreases chance transmission. people getting high viral loads doesnt change affect general population. person using data pre delta. piece shit article.  Vanilla caramel swirl day, stingy caramel. add little chocolate swirl chocolate bits too.  Sounds like good place live. approve third booster? But, actually that. Infants start getting vaccinated soon 1 month. continues adulthood. Hey I’ve seen one before! Georgia fan, disappointing. thought would smarter this. time could maybe helped prevent massive unchecked spread late Feb/early March.

The Pandemic declared March 11. amount time we're talking couple weeks maximum. feel like that's *pretty* near beginning. like comment somehow null void.

Moreover, think already agreed screwed initial messaging. say ""Could've encouraged people make masks supply increased."" happened false. That's exactly did. encouraged people make masks supply increased. Literally verbatim happened. Wow lived beautiful places! Thank sharing experiences. agree fires better hurricanes. hope family safe sound whole summer! there's technological advantage invent can't made inefficient dogfuckers slackers. live rock? Lol. Everyone needs prepare stories kids dying getting hospitalized parents didnt want get autism vaccine. vast majority parents reasonable people definitely insane. wonder time bring new CDC vaccination card bar code could swiped. would alleviate concerns people cell phones could weed fake cards seconds. Maybe bring booster shots. India terrible 2020 did. Police officers patrolling streets question anyone breaking lockdown protocols. would never US *muh freedom* peoples' lives. Even now, US leading pack terms cases, hospitalizations death despite China India billion people each. Granted, can't know exact numbers coming China especially I've heard India may underreporting well. we've gotten point even children dying, hope anti maskers anti vaxxers satisfied they've done. wonder there’s something unique New York makes especially vulnerable infectious airborne diseases? assumption yes, America higher childhood obesity rates obesity tied less positive results Covid, well health conditions make individual susceptible it. felt like safe assumption, assumption none less haha. 

You’re probably right health issues AstraZeneca leading caution UK. availability UK four approved vaccines significantly higher vaccination rate US. Walk vaccination sites also set available 18 appointment necessary yes.  Yeah point n95s protect others cloth masks protect others. thought flimsy cloth masks options last year. though. 8 year old cancer can’t get hasn’t approved children 12 seem update numbers every day, sometimes looks like 0 deaths per day. Yeah trump said it’d done Easter, whole thing shitshow infuriating part even getting long haulers. seen data that, would think splits would similar, even extreme long term complications. people get zero shred sympathy me. recommended ignore them.  “good control” sounds right 3 people infected last week job. people worst can't WAIT vaccine mandates. I'm tired shit. is, Walter Sobchak would say, element. Hopefully mandate dominos start falling, need bigger stick go carrot . Full FDA approval going lead school system immunization requirements, corporate requirements, insurance requirements. last one big stick. told Covid related care won’t covered unvaccinated, dropped coverage might lever needed help move percentage up. point benefits seem outweigh risk. 

But...isn't risk mitigated masks? saying there's really way children kindergarten trusted wear masks properly/at all? Who's third person? actually think Madison county (where Huntsville is) highest vaccination rate Alabama, it’s still 48.6% fully vaccinated. idiots. love optimism, I'm getting hopes yet. think force many ways conduct study published:

1. clear chain custody proper procedure guarantee sample collection.
2. separate inside outside masks

As stands, just.... sad. pandemic end months two years. questions long take, many vulnerable people die time. largely depend many people get vaccinated, quickly, measures used control spread meantime. even vaccinations control measures, vulnerable remaining dead couple years covid become another infection goes around, like flu, albeit fairly serious one. hand, get nearly everyone vaccinated quickly control spread meantime, would died saved, we'll return relative normalcy much sooner. unvaccinated decide.  gives people far credit do. since testing reduced 25% Agree! J&amp;J bad rep media (a lot deaths associate 2 ofc J&amp;J going get clicks scandals. nonetheless, don’t think there’s anything wrong vaccine. wouldn’t suggest anyone might type contraindication associated adverse events reported. Lol South Bay nowhere near Los Angeles. live LA county masks everywhere indoor public places. Lol…. Right pretty hard someone even badass real life roles played movie career, pull effortlessly. kind thing *should* make people realize what's important. 

This time last year people covid parties. many shits probably maintaining mindset? many people nothing seems matter *too* much (not enough proactive, anyway) personally lose access it. unfathomable me. Outdoor spread nearly negligible entire pandemic, even among unvaccinated. IMO true policy failure undermines real/more important public health measures backed data. US outbreak literally started hour live Kirkland retirement home. told people there's way contained there, nearly everyone knew called alarmist believed it'd handled. 

3 days later Seattle reporting cases, 1 week later NYC confirmed outbreaks. 

You really wonder better national leadership would done us first weeks. work small, poorly ventilated bar seen single mask since started working again. 

I'm hoping shots getting COVID twice already given power fight new nonsense. 

Sure miss days staying home worry infecting mother quadruple bypass newborn nephew. Yikes think close 1/4 yesterday's deaths? Btw time China shituation news hit social media. already knew America habitual rule breakers deniers.  would fucked prior governing body. Sadly. Nothing means shit unless happens you. There’s tons care it’s vocal minority Ron desantis makes good headlines get clicks 11 month old gets second jab tomorrow pfizer. Doc said thought would January-ish approval given. would piss royally. wear mask makes sense to, otherwise I’m wearing it. Really sorry that. Hang there. win lottery guess right numbers. both, thank   Damn can't wait address pandemic whole season. Oh trust me. Patients that…. Nobody cheering it, really hard lose much sleep people refuse one simple, free, safe thing protect around them. probably people protested lockdowns, refused masks demanded in-person schooling. solution requires 1 2 trips pharmacy still it. point, throw hands air let get sick.  Yeah that's traffic. jobs always road. People usually think get robbed. That's cause death. There's one thing love high school football that's Freedom!! Freedom protect COVID happening then. Ah, yes... issues vaccine adoption fauci's fault. course can't blame people downplayed covid throughout constantly spread disinformation. wonder could blame that?

% already vaccinated: Dems 86%; Repubs 54%

% definitely getting vaccinated: Dems 5%; Repubs data collected start vaccination campaign end 2020-june 2021. data points around June (since dramatic rise cases then). ***money*** catch part article. answer question, thanks.

I ""downplaying vaccine efficacy"" though. still rewarding bad behavior. care missed $100, care people going hold back doses newer vaccines know they're going get paid wait.

Who cares anti-vaxxers die? body, choice. rule hospitals clogged, anti-vaxxer COVID gets kicked make room someone make choice refuse vaccine. son went kindergarten last year, masked. vastly improved life. made friends, saw outside sporting events unmasked properly socialize, etc. 100% worth glad went. Definitely consider sending him. might well shut up. people would listen already vaccinated, people think he's literal demon deep state lizard something. Nope. expected least year. figured vaccination process would bring end worst this. turns way mark. start mandating vaccines public entry anywhere, go beyond 2022. pointless restrictions total lack exit strategy criteria pointless restrictions becoming absurd kinda scary. Ugh, sorry. hope mild better asap.  imagine everyone got vaccinated wore mask, people dying. What's that? app store thought guess still applies would rather take chance virus ""risk health"" getting vaccine. getting covid risking health lol. else expect stupid? messaging 4 months [**2021-12-24 20:36:16 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-12-24%2020:36:16%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

Thank Lord medical professionals scientist/virologist dedicated lives care others. I’ve never seen school year start Texas metropolitan school district many open teacher positions, we’re short 10% school staff already.

That’s conservative mantra  knew fucked saw video Chinese locked inside homes hospitals built night.   Big brain time. Agreed. response OP.

My hypothesis turns correct. numbers game end vaccinations reduce number possible replications turn mutations. See Nature paper exact recall, variants seen far came areas pandemic ran amok beginning - India (Delta Variant), Alpha (South Africa/ Brazil), since virus lot opportunity ""experiment"" infinite number host bodies. See article selection Ok variant would need outcompete delta otherwise won’t spread. Go look many vaccinated people extremely old and/or immune-compromised end hospital get back me. vaccinated disease almost certain little minor inconvenience may even may never know it. Yup. Opinions flavor ice cream best (chocolate coffee combined, way... come me), cannot opinions fuckin SCIENCE. Jfc hate usa wanna another year? Let's 2022. Wanna keep going? Let's 2023. get need toughen upcoming climate wars.  agree college vastly superior, start college 22 need still 95% experience - give high school back  virus, like many it, simply time start accepting reality situation learn live/cope, cling denial fantasies.

Historically, meant [codifying mandatory [forced things rolled back generations.

Accepting serious, communicable disease endemic means moving temporary measures permanent measures. thought reached point summer guess much prefer r/COVID19 don’t put statements like actual scientists know talking about. Boomers aren’t ones refusing vaccines. It’s overwhelmingly people 50. son law jail.

I actually did, hypothesis turns correct. numbers game end vaccinations reduce number possible replications turn mutations. See Nature paper exact recall, variants seen far came areas pandemic ran amok beginning - India (Delta Variant), Alpha (South Africa/ Brazil), since virus lot opportunity ""experiment"" infinite number host bodies. See article selection idea many Americans already infected? likelihood catching Covid, reinfection already extremely low. also nothing triage patient herd immunity, covid contagious vaccines leaky stop community spread. Important note studies Viral RNA. actually know corresponds \*actual\* amount infectious virus expelled. They're assuming higher. corrected it, anyone trying right thing do, part science medicine supposed work. dogmatic followers turn save face gets people killed, thankfully core tenet science reassess data available, toss outdated wrong ideas develop better theories, treatments, preventions explanations. Vaccine band aid prevent spread Covid. 
Band aid prevents injuring wound prevent getting another one like vaccine prevents getting ill prevent spreading virus stop it. 
Mask social distancing still required hence fact people like believe everyone vaccinated virus goes away not. sad. They’d done good nation collectively stopping COVID tracks, that’s possible Delta. It’s different bug gets even single hook it’s time putting seatbelts. 

Maybe happy got unrestricted long. kind feels like best us (Western nations) succumbing, slowest-motion train wreck countries know well unfold.  No, isn't. supportive something still support idea *forcing* everyone agree.

I think vaccines great proven effective preventing serious illness at-risk populations. also think healthy 30 year old pre-existing conditions, already recovered COVID, mandated get vaccinated. Statistically low risk spread ""taking bed"" anyone vaccinated (realistically much lower many people). can, would.

Mine elementary school heard already 2 high schools district kids knowingly positive showing class mass quarantines.

District next door already four staff members die.

I absolutely hated pulling mine young vaccinated BEST CASE, even personally get sick, in/out 2 weeks 10 days time disruptive her.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* people can’t take vaccine took one shot adverse reaction? fit in?  many hospitalizations latest wave resulted in?

And deaths? (Spoiler: answer zero).

We live covid leading hospitalization death.

Also, vaccines substantially reduce spread covid by:

1. [Preventing infections. breakthrough infections high viral loads, vaccines prevent many infections altogether.

2. [Reducing length  Vaccinated people clear virus faster aren’t contagious long.

3. [Even Ct “viral load”, vaccinated people less culturable virus actually *less vaccinated much likely survive

Do source that?  person acutely ill higher chance imminent decline deserves highest priority designation triage situation. vaccines limit severity illness, vaccinated given lower priority, higher. history violent, life-threatening reactions vaccines. can't get doctor sign getting vaccine, even though would give anything able get it. apparently crap shoot likely kill -- vaccine, disease itself. worry this?

I think people talk ""the unvaccinated"" refer people able get vaccine refuse due moral political objection. fair punish someone physically cannot get vaccine (like kids) people vaccine could harm. Depends. Church party never really cared evolution…  No, believe covid Okay I'll look it, dense read. people really consider victims kids teenagers whose parents threatening abandonment worse get vaccine. there's plenty stories /r/qanoncasualties like this. they're young scared want cut parents - understandably so. they're real victims here.  sub people antivax relatives? Taxpayers article. aren’t mine Thank you, heartbreaking left us soon, comfort married 70 years, long eventful happy lives. often joked one passed would right behind them, definitely proved right. wish years did. Lots people anyway without vaccine Thanks this. I've come realization people take whatever ""fact"" want accept rhetoric supports it, logical fallacy not, yell people longer effective. move next piece rhetoric, again, logical fallacy not.

There hope people, IMO, way thinking completely backwards. observe things find correct. decide correct bend everything observe match it.  Vaccines band aid, masks social distancing are. 100% effective preventing infection spread mean vaccines significantly reduce chance either. mandates cause way people get vaccinated see massive impact cases deaths happened grandmother earlier year... not, took week die injury. I'm glad better result. horrific. I'm sure party personal responsibility fine cases people charged attempted murder disclosing HIV positive knew were. 

At least, assault charge could potentially stick someone tested positive still acted recklessly without consent others even without proof infection came someone assault threat, actually committing act violence.  church get tax breaks expect party take culture war science. find difference viral loads comparing unvaccinated individuals vaccine “breakthrough” infections. Furthermore, individuals vaccine breakthrough infections frequently test positive viral loads consistent ability shed infectious viruses. results, preliminary, suggest vaccinated individuals become infected delta variant, may sources SARS-CoV-2 transmission others. Norovirus Always fire analogies trying say I’m better, I’m grateful immediate family good spot.

It’s black white though, still socialize safely take precautions. No. Healthcare human right. End discussion. Nevermind that, given choice I'd take college high school. Imagine born 1998-2002. would say vaccination status play role shortage medical resources. vaccinate made choice endangered health life people's well. contribute hospital ICU bed shortage suffer consequences. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 30 year old unvaccinated requires ICU care, they're likely 7 days. 70 year old patient, 1 day. worth deny next 6 people access ICU care prioritized 30 year old antivaxxer 70 year old took preventative measures? describing acutely temporal problem.
 
In US, much chagrin many redditors seems, medical collapse forthcoming. ICU wards routinely run around 70% capacity largely fewer beds highly specialized equipment personnel even minor influx lead ability write ""alarming"" headlines surrounding capacity.
 
This virus endemic. reality left must live fact. rate accustom reality us. CDC definitely flubbed messaging public. Easter 2022 right? 


/savant everyone get vaccinated.. 30 year old unvaccinated yoga instructor problems likely survive

No, fuck them. deliberately chose get vaccine. Even they're likely survive, I'd rather resources went saving cared enough people around society get vaccinated, selfish twats driving fourth wave. Correct. vaccine $40 jab, whereas antibody treatment $1.5K per infusion, many people need one infusion. spring 2022. still would be. Covid still surging Iceland despite highly vaccinated population.

The vaccine leaky stop community spread. can't even argued anymore.  honestly wish say things like this. know whatever bar sets country, we'll fall far short it. opposite actually. whatever keeps dignity intact fine me.  basically said loud, everyone locks 2 weeks, virus nowhere go over. Woof. points raise argue? Fuck. hope baby recovers quickly rest stay safe.

Pulled mine less week prior starting we're right behind cases SC. plans it. Yes have. I'd say even Premier league alone 100 players tested positive.  setting wrong goalposts. pretty simple concept send study? I'm disagreeing all- fact want study back exact argument unvaccinated family members. rephrase said words? 

You’re arguing points people aren’t making. want argue strawmen, take one conservative echo chambers. It’s like you’re customer service bot picking vaguely related lines script. would waste time? unvaxed son-in-law remorseful all? Once, again:

1.	It possible get infected vaccinated risk way less individual unvaccinated.
2.	 vaccinated individual get infected way less likely infectious compared unvaccinated individual.
3.	 vaccinated individual get infected becomes infectious amount time infectious greatly reduced compared infectious unvaccinated individual.

The science crystal clear. best option far get vaccinated.

That said, vaccination shouldn’t tool arsenal. still wear mask indoors, still avoid crowds, still take care protect vulnerable people. makes sense keep things remain vigilant long still pandemic. Idea! Reuse facilities GOP used detaining illegal immigrants. know, abandoned Wal-Marts stuff. Treat necessary, deny science medical advancements anyways. right.

If variant comes evades vaccines, makes sense come vaccinated people. host environment one competitive advantage escaping vaccines significant would cause outcompete everything else easily.

A variant unlikely (but impossible) vaccinated individuals host significantly smaller number virus cells (both individually aggregate), meaning significantly fewer chances mutation. son law went around knowingly ill without disclosing around friends tested positive covid.

IMO sue wrongful death/have charged criminal negligence.  Overweight people smokers back line. Yeup, line shoot. Can’t get 30% Americans get even one shot dude gets 5? 🤦🏼‍♂️  That's accurate interpretation. lines still going up, clearly process levelling off. - actual body articles rather headlines. whatsoever fault messaging, fault media, people bother consume headlines.

Media narrative spinning problem, I'm speaking media all. many government officials policy makers whose statements contain sorts ""this subject change conditions"" suggesting omnipresent.

One example that's close mind many school districts screwed messaging upcoming school year. Lots school policy decisions made June longer supported data August. messaging right first time, would included declarations conditions could cause policy change ways. officials struggling walk back, often making things fly, parents rightly pissed off.  taking OTC fever reduction meds like ibuprofen? I'd try first, make sure stay hydrated. extent yes, believe society need get beyond ""what's me"" stigma happy steps finally taken (And working) combat misinformation uncertainty surrounding vaccine. I'm sorry. :( guys really rough time right virus weather! would reasons me?

You you, suppose.

First, 1) wearing mask 2) going much two different choices. Either, neither, both.

Second, many point, fuck anti-vaxxers me. care happens them. protecting sorry asses.

There also can't get vaccinated legitimate reasons. care still get get long haul symptoms?

Or get acutely sick yourself, degree. course, less vaccinated all. thing is: there's way know affect could get spread others?

Yes. Again, depends much care people.

I think us duty fight virus, maybe reasonable degree, given individual circumstances. huge sacrifice. remember guy getting slammed AITA asking wrong sending kid school mask early 2020. times changed.  wholeheartedly disagree. Two doses still extremely effective hospitalization death, essentially things preventing us returning normality.

If people want boosters--and even though think offering one, I'll take one!--they them, help prevent even milder infections. great carrot stick. stick would way go work tested weekly prove positive pay test pocket.  Yeah wonder it’ll change full authorization it’s capped that.

Edit: 30-49 actually highest group city. 50+ 78%.  Nope, said infected delta varient spread it, vaccinated stop thst. Consistent latest statement CDC. continue ignore fact. Correct I'm wrong, standard procedure there's limited space triage based expected survival rate? two patients, one likely die even medical intervention good chance surviving, they'd admit one likely survive? that's case, vaccinated improves chances surviving, it'd generally result vaccinated people higher list, course would still exceptions say, healthy unvaccinated patient much older vaccinated one.   so... That's happening sounds like Tom Clancy novel.  almost new information comes light recommendations change based that.

i tired people railing ""experts"" ""contradict"" themselves. things change, delta exploded decided wasnt wise unmask anymore. 

its ok change opinion presented new information, that's sign intelligence. No, definitely not. trials supervised giving label not. Go supervised trials first. know kids generally lower risk, heard reports young adult males experiencing side effects higher rate groups. said, none new unexpected info. ThereMs thing 100% safe medication. Hell, Tylenol used improperly kill you. point enough data know best doses 12 age groups solid idea side effects expect. able get done school year started year. overcautious take going end costing lives long run. family lucky we’ve somehow managed avoid catching entire time. don’t want effort gone waste bureaucrat careful.

 Best family well. Stay safe there.  There's reason think three week interval Pfizer recommended first second doses way short, much longer interval second dose booster extremely beneficial Peter Hotez, MD, PhD, Baylor College Medicine Houston, said CNN Monday night 3-week interval first second doses Pfizer's mRNA vaccine, instance, may enough time spur extended immune response, initial shots acting primary 8-month lag, hand, could boost immunity significantly, Hotez said, potential yield high levels virus-neutralizing antibody immune response ""really ""That may while, may need annual boosters,"" Hotez said. ""This could third done.""

Lmaoooo  10 11 year olds look 12 pharmacist happens masks come off? Vaccines sustainable option. Masks delay infections delta wait out. wouldn’t bad, you’d still breakthrough infections since kids 12 can’t get vaccine, would still spread like crazy got schools.

There’s realistically way effectively police kids bus. Lunch/Recess/Gym would also ample opportunities spread.

Note LA County data also includes pre-Delta period May, June &amp; first couple weeks July. could socio-ethnic occupational reasons LA residents require intensive medical intervention, even Delta prevalent. demonstrates hospital resources never distributed evenly based pure population numbers dealing covid.  majority breakthrough infections occur elderly otherwise unhealthy. CDC’s reasoning booster shots waning protection catching Covid time. Couple fact elderly first receive shots would say vaccinated elderly people might still end bad spot get covid. love you. absolute moron hahaha New Zealand going makes sense judging actions far, means using every means disposal.

I’ll try find link article- Yes, does, health insurance. one exception ban pricing plans according health: smoking status. even raise rates 50%. even Congress could persuaded amend law, many states also outlaw things independently.

Life insurance different story, may end establishing higher premiums unvaccinated there. Counterpoint: yes simply say immune suppressed. Isreal shows +250% antibodies dose 3 6 months 8. say ""social components teamwork"". see ""socializing work"". Lots people love socialize, that's fine. need dress up. jobs require lot collaboration, remote work obviously ideal. people social enjoy chatting others randomly, also obviously ideal. many people, cost benefit analysis themselves, prefer permanent work home, seems think know better them. could negative impacts many people basement dwellers? could positive impacts easily giving people time freedom work. never life heard anyone praising western office culture amazing, fact entire life observed exact opposite. opinion let people decide value, rather presupposing issues knock effects difficult impossible quantify predict. remember days. also remember hope things would ok vaccines rolled out. wrong. 2022 seems overly optimistic without big changes. So...there's still space?  /S EDIT: saw comment yeah 103 cut-off. feel really bad, especially breathing problems, head ER. Better safe sorry here.

not doctor, symptoms experiencing? breathing?

love American clarification btw lol. country sucks.  This. Vaxxed plus masked works. fun safe protect  pumping message “get vaxed, resume life” nonstop, putting new message like interpreted as: “on individual level, there’s undefined amount additional work done afterwards,” counterproductive imo. can’t get double vaccines arms make stubborn idiots, can’t put twice amount masks make people don’t wear can’t lockdown twice hard idiots partied spring break throughout previous peaks. reward good reward punish bad. work still needs done local leaders, hospitals setting policy, companies setting policy staff, etc. 

pivoting “get vaccinated, resume life” “get vaccinated, require vaccines ready resume life, resume life” seems like easier, actionable pivot “get vaccinated, hope dumbest lowlifes catch eventually maybe next year get live again, stay tuned.”

on community level, could require vaccines/proof negative tests participate “normal” life sooner, think hammering message would incentivize individuals looking things nationally/globally. good luck getting crowd already done everything less right quarantines, mandates, etc. continue paying attention watched bunch hicks bury heads sand, cancel progress continue stay tuned already sacrificing year life. know it’s complicated, seems counterproductive spend time also highlighting spots country succeeded able normalcy already, balance national/international gloom doom stark contrast cities communities done right. 

look florida’s deaths currently surpassing deaths previous peaks LONG VACCINE WIDELY AVAILABLE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS (e.g. 99.9% people die covid). look cities reached 70%+ fully vaxed music festivals outdoors burden hospital capacity (except highly risk begin with, nursing homes healthcare education) apart slapping mask uber grocery store, already back normal. 

it (supposed be) team effort vaccine available risk, many never participated actively sabotaged, others part. vaccine majority population majority older folks gotten it, isn’t going one-size-fits-all approach individual: qualifying vaccine, vax rates individuals community, co-morbidity, occupation, contact (or lack contact) at-risk groups can’t yet get vaccinated, realistically play role much “normal” get have. 

the broader context necessary, it’s increasingly hard sell healthy vaccinated populations continue buckle seemingly endlessly life insanely short. community done takes makes sense send message group followed marching orders wait lowlifes florida catch maybe u get normal. we’ll getting boosters get faction morons vaccinated, fuck em. probably grateful got vaccines free back spring, didn’t pay $1000 one, given normal expectations hellish healthcare system. Sorry, closed files without saving imgur blocked work. hard recreate, got data Wikipedia Worldometers.   mean, probably. financially benefits spread antivax bullshit knows it. hopeless? Maybe enough antivaxers die covid problem solve  two months ago, CDC director saying vaccines prevented spread vaccinated could mask go lives.

Centers Declining Credibility. 
 
If follow foreign news/media, consistently month ahead. US CDC's political arm whoever's charge now. $100 cost effective stick carrot, especially given ungodly expensive Covid hospitalization society. ""2 weeks stop spread"" turned this....I bad feeling matter Covid around long time.   Weeks already obvious done. delay caused spike much steeper?

Next, mask mandate schools. inevitable, delay inevitable? Man, gotta careful. Without /s ignorant people gonna think serious. That's terrible. I'm sorry.  People don’t want believe don’t silver bullet usually spend 6 10 hours location usually enough get couple interesting sites see area. Sometimes stay night days, depending location.

It's popular hotel follows see 3 5 different places week. always return, meals included floating resort free entertainment. 

I've ton them, keen anymore since burned covid make go regardless us.

That said, money, bad way travel.  care. homeschooling, wearing masks, vaccinated, traveling. kids suffering it. Governor local leaders apathetic happening. never get mess without change leadership take lots time maybe even morons still vote wrong people in. That’s chance willing take. actively desperately trying get jobs state. enough criminal case stated - would know Covid begin mount case, even necessarily cross threshold also prove knew putting people danger.

You make civil case literally anything want life, anybody sue anything. saying would really tough case cost pursue would large. Nevermind fact there's massive family element play particular case.

Not defending guy whatsoever here, things never simple. Headline: “Brazen attack”. 

Reality: knocked tables brushed worker side view mirror, didn’t need go hospital.

I’m saying wasn’t attack workers, also may asshole didn’t want wait anymore trying maneuver car away. I've read recent assessments, world delta, state eradicating humans still possible. claimed would easier polio harder small pox. Congratulations upcoming bundle joy. wife decided split duties much possible make sure manage life. daughter first child, sure first... is, faith abilities parents, it. really really really tested us lack sleep. wife breastfeeding department really assist, changing diapers, bringing water snacks, anything get sleep mission. 

Work life balance exist. pandemic proven that. wish best.  think too. forced vaccine good? Would better us? Maybe...

I honestly like idea forcing people put foreign substance body want to, war covid vaccines primary weapon. war, people make sacrifices. Getting jab better sacrificing life. ""it"" means planet Earth really dislike flu comparisons. Flu leave chronic cardiac, pulmonary, renal issues. COVID brought ""under control"" way Influenza, we're fucked. long COVID impacts something sweep rug. someone vaccinated, point CDC start incorporating statistics people natural immunity previously infected virus. people least likely SPREAD virus - huge component ending 2 year battle. Again, talking getting infected, I'm talking spreading virus. Well, Trump can't even control monster anymore [and tell get I'm going assume ends history's slowest, dumbest apocalypse. infections Hawaii due community spread travel related. still true today. Mom 10 days passed. get shampoo. didn’t even patients. buy gift shop. Here’s woman nails done ignore need shampoo. know it’s resource many might well bandaid station. really surprised people jump planes short notice, I’m curious people honestly. me, much line go vacation (family schedule, air, rental car, accommodations, employer leave, etc…). seems pretty awesome life circumstances allow random jaunts Hawaii, need channel shit. Refuse vaccine costs dollars. Instead get $1500 IV every time get COVID spook.

You get monoclonals get breakthrough case too! 9 months flatten curve Interesting! graphs would share? I'm kind data nerd :D bad gauging consequences estimating probabilities, apparently. going trust: experts decades experience, youtube/tweet/facebook post. He's moved goalposts multiple times, including mask importance constitutes adequate level 'herd immunity' proof, kinda feel government handled things here.

-First 80 literally 80 could get it.

-Then moved 60

-Then arbitrary group

-Then another group (while still leaving people co-morbidities completely unless old homebound)

-Then another group... particular time, went online... basically anyone could actually book appointment. actual restrictions. category ""other"" job type, long worked, could get (in theory... didnt actually ""that"" many start also think went rout). kept ""appearance"" scarcity would make thought ""eh, need it"" actually want cus taking long go list criterias, truly worried, would still book appointment found legit ""jumping"" lines. study actually sensible timeframe results based data Los Angeles County May 1 July 25, agency said.

Not one ones date way back late 2020 nearly 100% hospitalized unvaxxed nearly one vaccinated.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Could tell little breakthrough case? severe it? don’t feel like sharing understand. It’s nice hear perspective. ""The world perspective completely normal must normal everyone else too"". Thanks Joe Rogan brilliant optimism. won’t **god**, wish would. NNN (no-nut November) people? Hah, best I’m seeing 40% masked days, including store employees required mask again. mask compliance excellent said could take off. Pfizer knows, data good enough, submitted end September approved October.   mean, doesn’t need reassuring. course every death tragedy, especially children. chances (while non-zero) absolutely minuscule. Society decided long ago risks children dying flu every year small enough manage every winter, need start thinking similarly covid. honestly think vaccinated people protesting? sound either stupid dishonest. 

You low risk would vaccinated. employer, would insist lowering risk pose others - especially worked hospital. Brazilian ok? Save me, jeebers! promise ignore teachings, treat fellow man like total shit plead demand miracle deathbed! way shambles instance Fauci get good control deez nuts  we're still talking mask mandates vaccine passports then, issue whether want be. Man that’s scary. seriously cannot another fucking year Qcumber amateur researchers setting fire community primary-and-mentally-challenged governor dumping gasoline make everyone forget nearly froze death homes February. can’t. I’m … idk I’m out. don’t any. 

So can’t imagine docs/nurses feel. teachers. Elsewhere thread someone extracted comment end linked article. basically saying working dark comes whether vaccination improves chances ***if*** become severely ill, lack data outcomes severely ill vaccinated vs severely ill unvaccinated.

The one thing seem sure vaccination dramatically reduces numbers people getting ill, daresay reduces ability get data make comparison first place. Perhaps time goes collect enough information able say. took around 30 minutes get vaccine. Seems like much better deal me. know else causes blood clots? Covid 19... much higher rate even AZ's worst, much worse outcomes, since fighting single symptom, entire disease time... tried calling instead signing online? I’ve heard people success getting kids calling. anti-vaxxers die thanks sheer stupidity. Texas passed law that. outlines plaintiff prove establish liability infection pandemic disease. possible. see opinion data, data? require letter religious leaders church letterhead. Students reminded found perjuring official forms subject expulsion. Obviously need something like 20 billion odd doses said done, FDA EUA 12 big deal. FDA either second cautious regulator world (NRC one gives run money). coincidence western countries mix matching vaccines delaying second doses US getting irate walgreens giving pfizer 4 week delay rather trialed 3/denied J&amp;J first clinical trial enough US representation. countries use FDA approval proxy drug safe apparatus expensive run FDA incredibly thorough anyway. major disease carrier able get vaccines big deal regardless live. Yeah NZ control this. whole country strict lockdown virus can't spread uninfected households. didnt get walk Masters degree. Still upset it. Please call write board nursing give information links screen shots. He’s safe nurse. don’t care personally opinions are, nurse he’s dangerous violating oath harm he’s spreading dangerous lies. Please report him. Ehhh varies lot. I’ve tube rides recently pretty much everyone wearing masks. drunk wreck someone innocent absolutely victim prioritized. they're basically covering asses. criticism they've received rare myocarditis side effects cropped teens they're extra cautious. epidemiologist news show mentioned FDA consider negative impact approving ""unsafe"" vaccine kids, pertains release vaccines come future years. They'd rather sacrifice hundred children today preserve trust future vaccines tomorrow.   many confounding factors, they're still strongly correlated. high positivity rate indicative many unconfirmed cases still there. 42% among highest I've ever seen.

Calling baseless ridiculous. I'm Canadian, luckily educated populace run problems scale guys do. moment saw CHINA problem virus, knew US screwed.

If authoritarian regime cant stop flu chance have? Mf told us would good control virus 6 weeks quarantine.

Just accept point, corona going away lot years can't solution, know even 90% vaccination rate would miracle. situation expect 100% people exactly want? Also US vaccination rate moot new variant rip India make way here.

What **should** advocating 90% **global** vaccination rate, even unlikely getting 90% US.

In comparison India vaccines ugly 3-4 months case rate fallen cliff 2/3 population showing antibodies. Ie herd immunity. Sweden took care at-risk population let young healthy go lives good results. still believe Sweden approach ideal.

Natural immunity provides protection, even allowed discussion reasons guess at. least they're outside. Worse things happen every day US. sense always worry this.

Triage make difficult decisions like resources strained. they're strained thanks shitty vaccination rate.

I'm sorry worry it. make sure hold correct people responsible.   think demonstrate selfishness correlate pandemic death rate please try it, good amount people vaccinated died thus far small.

[‘It hit like wall’: it’s like breakthrough case book going way part solution kinda playing along good guys. So, c+ government certainly got bulk pricing. Sounds like vax campaign really

*sunglasses*

cookin' Oh yea worst. didn’t really start get worried mid feb 2020 tried tell people coming people laughed. remember day announced first US cases point knew late considering long incubation period international travel covid already wide spread US. guess people really thought would able contain like Ebola.

Worst part didn’t want right this. don’t get satisfaction “I told so!” course people would act like always knew coming.  unvaccinated people took mean to. agree theory, ethicists decide triage based likely survive, may people like lumped ""willfully unvaccinated"" may denied life-saving therapies. Exactly.  Kind based take really Pfizer approved, mean places get start charging vaccine now? that's case, end terribly Probably explains CEO stepping love hysteria, almost like want see success story. Mutations going stopped now; however live adapt one. UK primarily delta variant really issue. combination vaxxed, naturally immune younger, healthy population worked here. There's reason believe new mutation dealt developed immunity have. I've often wondered done entirely wrong thing allowing immune society continually update individual mutations, thus sparing combination mutations could eventually dangerous. Get PCR test. 

Rsv also going around. well bugs. vaxxed brother teacher caught cold first week back school. Tested wasn’t COVID. Ah yes Saruman, chap good guy great moral guidance...

In eyes still pretty equivalent whatever, examples days.

Fine let's say drink driving crash you, hospitalised. longer deserve treatment? instead treat need? hate antivaxers cannot debate human's right life! do. care great deal duty vaxxed, staying home trying spread word anyone listen same. Sadly, sometimes words fall deaf ears. I'm losing faith quickly.  “proned” mean?  Keep attitude, watch blowback next election. 👍🏻

I'll take help people want give. Continue politicizing this. Yup. kids get vaccine, I'm 100% going back normal. mean technically probably could open everything long people masking indoors know severely reduces spread. fit many idiots FL, that's terrible. We'll get attrition. I'm really, really sorry. whenever read headline says ""Fauci says"", can't help think public information films want vaccine kid. data Delta concerning covid classic point. What's unclear much worse is. eventually run hosts, assuming immunity gained infected variant different help reduce viral load spread future variants. Maybe take another year.   except case, time target gets hit, vaccination efficacy starts wearing half population. Everyone got vaxxed March, April, May past year need booster, otherwise we're back loop again. 


It would closer accurate boosters needed. understand anyone still say vaccines answer news like [New York Times coming Israel. 

The concluding sentence ""The vaccinations supposed solve everything,” said. “We understand vaccines enough.”

Are going ignore data pretend vaccines stop pandemic? end? Southern Baptists we’re borrowed time soon founded. 66% significant reduction 91%. way could ""boost"" 66% number back up, somehow. Oh well, guess there's nothing could done, even is, let's wait month something. like there's shortage frontline medical workers, big deal bunch sick there's nothing going right might keeping medical workers busy anyway. guess treat like data Israel Mayo clinic system interesting anecdote really used anything, really. Aside that, there's cautionary note data, fine, nothing see here. remember one coworkers like “hell yeah dude get like three weeks must stoked” telling isn’t going three weeks. Nobody going enforce lol. living dark times co-workers indication, find unlikely. latest gem “people who’ve fully vaccinated still getting sick covid.” It’s vaccine, cure. I’m tired trying explain basic shit people used think much intelligent this. nearly well couple really bad select individual counties here; click Risk Level (the map defaults  Ffs  is. I’m Philadelphia suburbs, pre-vaccine rare see someone without mask. Post-vaccine probably still like 60% people see public wear them, that’s vaccinated county state want people go Susie definitely one.  plane load per day. Bullshit. already good position. county live 80% vaccination rates still mandatory mask mandate place far, I've personally known 2 people tested positive vaccinated. got tested one coworker test positive. symptoms even less normal cold, sinus discomfort couple days. working yard whole time out. sister works rehab center people who've falls strokes, type thing. people test positive vaccinations, one person hospitalized far asymptomatic. people already poor health generally older. **one** hospitalization since vaccines. mom works nursing home, deal her. positives, they're either severe asymptomatic. Lol McDonald’s breakfast you’re from? remember them? would like add course do. two children young get vaxed, immunocompromised sister battling cancer white blood cell count low danger unvaccinated. better well believe care, I'm everything turn tides.

Remember DeSantis small margin victory; lots people terrified stressed sucks.  see that… also us paying attention would fail piss event fire, due disastrous mishandling every step this. tend well vaccinated group. need stop making excuses pick game. ""Rethink"" implies actual thought begin with. vaccine statistics town. nice case study, matter Abbott I'd sure happy see full-time, robust online options middle high school students become permanent result pandemic. kids learn better without navigate social stuff teen in-person learning environments or, point, they're able go pace. certainly right every kid every family situation, right enough I'd love see it.  So, Easter. Well yeah can, that's called triage nurse. HIPAA prevents explain anything patients. decisions made behind desk. one ER knows they're waiting bed. 20 minutes some, others 20 hours.  Ah yes, obesity, highly contagious condition everyone knows safe effective vaccine for. Well, drive like maniac one. 😂 “No one gaslit” sounds like gaslighting, ironically Honestly, anti-vaxxers anti-maskers pretty much conspirators mass murder point. knowingly willingly spreading false information that's costing people lives. treated like anyone plotted homicide.

Thanks much!! don’t really see anything besides allergies prevent saw headline time last year, stomach would drop   others outcompete get seriously learning tricks.  shit obviously political, pretending isn’t won’t help think better. Part Fauci’s job right say gently encouraging things make sound like someone charge nobody actually is. I, too, irate.  rude complaint? doesn’t sound bad all. vaccine job. can’t imagine wearing kn95 mask work 9 hours 5 days week, way. wear go grocery store shopping hour that’s it.

What crazy world fact even private residences got brought up, even ""recommended"" ""mandated"" asinine own.

Entities subject ADA must continue comply law. EVERYBODY GET VACCINE!  pathetic people bribed this. ship field hospitals available.

The USS Comfort designed intended take covid patients. designed take critical non-covid cases release hospitals non-covid cases.

Field hospitals designed long-term, convalescent care infirmed. People nursing homes high levels daily care -- eating, bathing, using restroom require help. That's field hospital designed staffed defending this?

Two ~~weeks~~ years flatten curve may mentioned article/ may told part ""decomposition"" saw. one wants look dogs think ""you ate dead husband"" There's assumptions reply far out, worth arguing over. aware within world immunology epidemiology there's certainly universal agreement many things.
Anyway, wish best.      Yay! guys. taking Americas cup still done schooling America. I'm happy someone else get $100 means ICU bed get bad car accident.  fda fact sheet: cdc guidance: exact thing happened me. First year college online remote too.  It’s perceived risk. Childhood diseases days there’s perceived risk. Covid sees kids getting mostly mildly sick perceived risk compared great unknown. 30-49 year olds see adults getting sick tough time perceived risk. 

Also general, people way conservative children themselves. give up. idiot give shit anyone themselves. I'm waiting Spring 2022 bunch morons realize getting vaccinated good idea. Maybe...MAYBE end August I'll cautious, point I'm done carrying weight bunch shitters want play mortality roulette virus. wore mask. took vaccine. fucking part going theirs, get kicked play care one bit. I'm actually fully favor ""Unregulate everything let Darwin sort out."" there's many lost causes. Might sooner health care system collapses vaccine holdouts get fight covid thoughts prayers. (I like hospitals want path) I'm voter. right. guess cancel out? Yeah trump. COVID taking anti-vaxxers right probably helping too.   Really feel like lost something 'Nam...

Well believe not, every disease world causing pandemic moment. Covid is, it’s global health issue. part stop it, selfish.  None happening state honest Either get goddamn vaccine stay fuck home.

Stop coddling people, stop giving vents treatments, send back line send home lie bed they’ve making months. need learn hard way happens fuck around find out. way. Unmasking vaccinated NEVER good idea point introduced. person let Doctor know CDC announced it, read decision CDC waiting room seeing them. Doctor visibly shaken news, begged continue wearing mask spite vaccinated high risk. still wearing mask. oh case clear meant ages 12 online

ages 4-11 like babysitting + learning combined Good bot lol Okay, argument everyone get vaccinated safety can't get vaccinated dead now, considering vaccinated still spread virus at-risk unvaccinated. 

Considering people can't get vaccinated (the immunocompromised allergic) still reservoirs viral mutations (which vaccines may may protect against) - proposal. 

Let's done start. Gather risk put protective quarantine virus mutated safer, manageable variant.

Then, go ice cream.  even considered people there?

Logical fallacy. Red herring. topic people thus point germane subject. aside, know I, outside topic, concerned ""those people""? Presumptuous happen know vaccinated individuals hospitalized due underlying immune issues.  65 vaccinated hospitilized exceedingly rare.

Again, irrelevant. someone vaccinated hospitalized possibly 65 mean undeserving consideration. Lastly, individuals 65 breakthrough cases hospitalized. I'm going exert effort -- easily Google cases, age patients discussion concerned. NCL policy. rest take 12. possibility phone might spontaneously burst flames pocket kill too. 

And possibilities much less likely probability Covid19 killing disabling you. 

Honestly, trust vaccines much lithium ion batteries. 

And bats. think administration fire Fauci chance getting opposite whatever says back right minds. Basically sacrifice. I’m sorry fed lie. Canada, told start likely least 18 month ordeal, probably longer. hard pill swallow, long term certainty greatly reduced anxiety felt, didn’t get hopes unrealistically wave peaked. joke entire movement people going “natural immunity” social media. 2020's also going remembered decade many horrible diseases mankind finally beaten, possibly including cancer. dictating lives free states. data saying four year old vaccinated. alert can. Oh, great treatment, idiots getting simpler easier cheaper preventive. like getting great bionic arm instead putting bandaid infected hang nail. total death count Florida passed 43,000.

So 22,000 less deaths California? mean, I'm happy incentivizes people get vaccines, fuck. That's really telling shitty prison system ramen pack enough bribe someone. Yeah, likely many people good reason, still, treat people poorly, there's hope rehabilitation. that's far sighted goal prisons anyway... sigh, fuck US  Media going prolonged pandemic hurt Biden Dems midterms. that's case beyond f'ed since severity extent driven largely behavior Right.   remember March 2020 panic buying dozen cans vegetables case whole virus thing went bad...

DCL Royal opted go fully vaccinated cruises recently change Bahamas requiring fully vaxxed order come port. since changed policies line that. Before, Carnival actually going 95% threshold better DCL/Royal doing. saying was: clear relationship vaccine uptake trust government. Thus, Western Europe higher uptake US (US famous among Western countries low trust government). Eastern Europe lower uptake US. Russia low vaccine uptake, becuase extremely low trust government.

Baked said also: Dictatorship generella low trust government. relevant Russia. 

But agree Putin specific point taking vaccines COVID-19 good thing. course fully vaccinated since while. take booster when/if available live. especially since probably allow excuse stuff like measles. Who's ""we""?

If talking boomers, I'd tend agree you, born gravy train biscuit wheels. world handed crashed car anyway.

Instead obsessing righteous worthy healthcare, need figure better get vaccines poor communities, assholes refuse vax, save vaccines distribute developing countries. absolutely shameful conversation happening imo. De Santis looking like paper tiger. feel worst people college right now. Zoom equivalent person learning. mention connections stuff jobs. 

I also feeling sorry honestly last years youth I'm single hell prospects. RA immunosuppressive treatment time vaccination gives risk anyone age vaccinated time. It’s disease- it’s treatment body working mount primary immune response. 

Talk rheumatologist. 💜 thank you.  Due poverty history poverty dating back civil war Secret, public, get vaccinated.  breakthrough cases also experience long covid like unvaccinated cases? Definitely rationale pragmatic approach. focusing hospitalizations deaths. Zero Covid going happen. need focus energies increasing incentive get vaccinated. point it‘s matter time, wish sarcastic. multiple variants immune-escape properties (Alpha (UK) Beta (South Africa)) variant highly increased transmission (delta, maybe even lambda). 

It‘s simply matter time either one mutates fit delta, one unlucky person catches time result fit delta. 

So yeah, either politicians one day going realise can‘t get away without vaccination mandates partake public life, we‘ll casenumber-rollercoaster forseeable future (florida shown even 50% vaccination rate restrictions simply option long term). 3% higher normal 90% occupancy? Looking Alabama's heathcare system crumbling, I'd say treat unvaccinated people show hospital (unless actual reason get vaccinated, children immunocompromised people.) made fucking bed, let die it. people waiting get icu bed heart attack beds taken anti vaxxers who's luck ran out. Why? I’m sorry, Fauci backing corner keeps putting messaging allows anti-van crowd use words him.

**

Thanks source. . Second last paragraph article. Emphasis mine. appears overall many. agree following guidelines health recommendation punished. think overall small population would find support need federal, state, local programs. states counties completely given contact tracing? health department going able investigate contact trace meaningful way upcoming surge need ideas expect may happen innovative ways get people stay home nothing political triage, fuck BS. nothing helping people possible positive outcomes dealing limited resources.

You'd know preexisting conditions, life habits patients decide. Evidence points vaccinated 70yo better possible outcomes 40yo unvaccinated person. such, people hospital equivalent current disease progression 70yo gets it. Also, ICU beds nice all, would prescribed treatment course regardless type room in, ICUs lower nursing patient ratios standard floor ER patients usually wait. 

This also coming 40yo Paramedic, Wildland Firefighter Army Medic guy. Personal feelings matter triage. Would fair say vaccines work? jesus steps diseases vaccines effective preventing disease mutate like COVID. Unless plan locking forever, gonna repeatedly exposed COVID.

Its Fantastic US preparing booster shots, large developing countries even 1st shot mutations continue flourish. probably isn’t one stat paint whole picture. 

If you’re looking children specifically, would keep eye number pediatric infections, percentage severe/critical cases, percentages subgroup comorbidities. far local statistics I’d watch local total case rate (county citywide) weekly rolling average determine risk level. Locally kids, look school outbreaks, percentage pediatric beds open ICU/floor, rates viruses (RSV surging right live) take consideration looking beds available.

Mask mandates punitive vaccinated people , unpopular opinion around here. Mandate vaccinations negative tests let’s move on. risks outweigh benefits, least me.

What kind risks? 1 get livers 2 don't, high likelihood keep drinking thus die anyway.

There two reasons people without vaccination get deprioritized. Let know one disagree why:

1. intentionally gave people Covid. reason ICU full first place.

2. higher probability returning Covid point, dying future (after they've saved caught again).

If intentionally give 5 people Ebola, ICU 5 beds, greater chance survival fifth victim, algorithm let last victim die. (There also vaccine Ebola refuse get.) fair arrive hospital alive bullet wounds likely make worst usually then. I'd want wait bullets inside either, giving perspective healthcare providers position. May offer punctuation trying time?

In June cases low, EUA December/January looked likely.  Tennessee: fucking absolutely mobilize turn droves help neighbors displaced floods. give even though hardly anything give. buy food grocery donate. risk life limb save you. Hell, even cut arm give need be.

Also Tennessee: aint doin shit prevent children, family, friends, neighbors strangers getting sick. I'll rescue kid tree nearly drown process day long, fuck wearing mask. incredibly worrying line thought...

Following logic would reduce/deny help smoked, ate unhealthy, minimal exercise, drunks, drug addicts, etc. 'fault'. dangerous topic discuss right live die. resources truly stretched breaking save best chance survival treatment (use treatment highest impact, irrespective landed there) make comfortable cannot help.

My kids' school held vaccine drive back May approved 12-15. Held second one 3 weeks later too. rule depending live. sure already triage. Careful, might bright enough unload first. PCR tests, yes, cannot distinguish viable non-viable viral particles. Yeah, probably easier idealistic UK little bit less extreme. Makes easier think best people, I'm sure.  Eventually plateau arrive declare prediction right along. /s  IIRC Hydrogen even problem, rather hull coated thermite, name suggests highly flammable. That's caught fire. burned through, ignited hydrogen inside make even spectacular failure.

I mean, liquid oxygen petroleum distillates highly flammable too, use fuels rockets jet engines. they're protected behind numerous failsafes. see reason modern Zeppelins same. We've learned lot safety since 1930s. delta changed things. people gotten vaccinated, delta may emerged all. There's hiding Covid. Everyone catch eventually, New Zealand finally learning that.  Nobody believes timelines anymore. Yes agree said agreed doesn’t mean less equals none. 
We still aware vaccinated people still get infected thus need continued mask use social distancing. 
Everyone needs get never going go back normal. “Everything fine” motto pandemic. hope stays fine, millions unvaccinated even northeast. Trust me, I’m pro Covid guy. mandatory vaccination. Really? That's interesting. going SARS, swine flu, Ebola, avian flu thought bad. indication media January bad schools around windows screwed/glued/nailed/painted shut. time mostly virus mutating.  kids back schools spread going get worse. No, really. Even breakthrough cases virus replicate lower rate, thereby reducing chances mutation. Additionally, primed immune system adaptive B cells churn variety antibodies better deal changes spike proteins. Selective pressures don’t work way vaccines/viruses bacteria/antibiotics. lot discussion r/COVID19 qualified people. 99% people hospitalized dead delta variant unvaccinated  Uhh - first all, writer journalist, subject matter expert. Secondly, FDR approach *was* EUA. every comment argument disagreement, though may feel way. Anyone read discussion informed.  It’s absolutely horrific boarders open vaccinated people. said get vaccinated. I’m missing family god damn much I’d rather die wait another year seeing family. absolutely reason Canada open boarders EU america. SICKENING. administration failed others family different countries.   Add proof vaccination I9 (employment eligibility verification form). jab, job. Either take shot homeless hungry.  must really wild regional variation this

There absolutely is. obese ones taking icu beds thinking admit day. exactly anti-vaxxers wanted. 

Did believe brother's keeper? brothers sisters keeper either.

Don't trust doctors? research? Want take personal responsibility healthcare? intubate lungs start filling fluid get vaccine. Honestly point get vaccination, wear mask, live normal life can. Don’t let keep away things want bc likely safe way get immunity time catching wanes months. I've heard people catching 2nd even 3rd time thought catch again.. said misinformation. something read news. course, many times news disinform, intention inform authoritative information.

But issue, place needs place inform people. ok intelectual resources understand comprehend. read directly paper understand it.

Not everyone has, attitude helpful people fence. pushes people towards disinformation.

This culture war conducted such. real life death issue. Downvoting make sense. effect me, behaviour naive confused person without intelectual resources dangerous towards health health people around them. Feels good back loop. 

Shoutout anti-vax, anti-mask, deniers, NNN folks keeping us stuck here. Appreciate it! unable read critically.
 
They say cannot prevent transmission, aid preventing transmition.

If 1 10 vaccinated people get infected Delta 10/10 unvaxxed get infected, vaccinations prevent spread 90%.

Conditional probability hard people guess. wish billion dollars today supposed first day back campus in-person classes since March 2020 (technically semester started yesterday dont classes Monday) course, get emailed morning saying building power outage and...we're back Zoom today possibly tomorrow depending school gets power back. *sigh*

I honestly known better past year half actually expect things normal man can't keep this. Especially supposed first day gonna slow process getting back groove things. Definitely would mind lazy Zoom day every semester starts wearing deflated energy excitement back campus damn much.

Legit 2 years ago would day Zoom. fucking sucks  Yep, they've weaponized stupidity dying it. Hilarious 18-30 demo really slacking. coming someone it. believe small town medical staff believing covid. aunt died Friday covid went hospital nearest home sent home without testing symptoms clearly sick. Three days later rushed hospital ambulance, tested positive Covid 19 died two weeks later ICU. vaccinated cancer. misinformation literally killing people tried best, aunt wore mask, got vaccinated still couldn’t shielded effects anti vaxer/ anti covid nut jobs. literally nothing left people point. far I'm concerned, perfectly justified punching guy face every time see rest life. What's really interesting people imposing restrictions, shutdowns actions associated economic policy, ones afford sit back worry next paycheck coming from. make ton. Neither lot friends. bracket among hurt sanctions. 

We've seen inflation go up, cost goods housing skyrocket, many us furloughed still. restrictions caused us great economic harm. likely suffer decades them. many people, decreased upward mobility, furthered economic divide rich poor. 

I know call privileged. now, effects shutdown almost worse effects virus comes harm done young people. worth it? Hell, want lose another paycheck save person get vax, old person stay home. 

Look much rich profited this. time change. tell us lumber crisis . honestly believe every day anti vaxxers genuinely believe vaccines harmful/more harmful covid. often angers antivaxxers SM sites allow misinformation amplify echo chambers. people don’t believe stuff overnight.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* GOOD. Let medically exempt unvaccinated folks first line, everyone else waits.    Republicans yet find problem try fix prison. easter 2022 also shop PetSmat? think one thing add there’s going requirements get vaccinated. 


I hope require vaccinations air travel next  time, know infectious mainly droplets airborne. 

Seems like good reason Center Disease Control shoot hip then, it?

The CDC made unfortunate errors taking human behavior account. important point mistakes learn mistakes repeat future. Giving pass mistake makes likely they'll make similar mistake future.  title misleading, 42% positivity rate ludicrously high. real number infected way 4.3%. Please sir, downvote. earned it. There's difference triaging patients based expected outcome hospital getting full turning away unvaccinated patients principle even they're putting serious strain system. Yes sad.

Anyways, obviously vaccinated shed vaccine particles landing hospital due DNA permanently altered /s  talk cousin Covid elderly? Start picking night take fema camps. Make stay receive doses. release them. remember telling friends university countries worldwide cancelling classes, headed direction said obsessed virus lol now. remember seeing leaked China videos people dying moment... short 2 minute video, 2 people died, that's knew shit going get real :(  Spreading misinformation based feels. would def move states like asap. mean im saying California clear winner, something level headed neutral nonsense. state affairs get worse especially Delta mutates gets stronger. Florida’s economy heavily dependent tourism. Yeah, understand triaging based vaccination status hospitals full (after all, people vaccinated likely survive), like generally types people rightly criticize corrupt terrible healthcare system trying give power hurt people, 'right people' hurt (for now).  19

Edit: they've got hospital visits, overnight stay, death. big difference three. also need know percentage over-50s vaccinated. Exactly. many officials wasting time mask battles when...jury still effectiveness basic masks people wear wear them,. Save mask battle energy vaccine mandates. obsession masks ends spectrum ridiculous. interesting thanks! promise. Agreed. pick right live die. deamons discussions never stops.  shame school systems underfunded crowded. proper funding thousands children's deaths could avoided.

But 🤷 hand taxes higher, Jeff Bezos might able afford spend 5.5.billion flying space 20 times instead 40 times. would true travesty 🙄 True. culture politics United States make possible use strategy mentioned. *whose 

You chOoSE get vaccinated, choose cover healthcare costs vaccinated. 

Funny cHoiCE thing works ways. optimistic man world. Keeping spirits up. Februaey 2020 believed experts saying expected severe disruption least year half.

These days still believe experts say expect disruption another two years now. approval comes better understanding cases rare hold giving vaccine emergency situation, could cause concern less urgent scenarios.

It's like people forget E emergency.

""Why rush that?"" 
""I trust it"" 
""We need data""

Yeah, well, we're one world's impactful pandemics. Hence EUA. EUA allows us use vaccine, FDA gets breathing room evaluate risks depth, hence took longer. Remember next time people want government handle everyone’s healthcare. Determined draw attention considered critical question answered order prevent future pandemic, Chan took Twitter, mastering art tutorial threads gathering “worse shape” before

That's usually trajectory things take decide bring controversial topic Twitter. YES!!!  heard several parents vaccinated wait say going consult doctor kids get it. said risk brainer. concerned vaccine kids. them. some. Move goal posts? said fam would forgive son law nothing could do. 

I linked study shows scientific method wrong, vaxxed would likely saved grandparents' lives son law moron.

What think claimed? vaccines 100% effective preventing transmition? Gtfo fragile ego. care morons entrenched positions, I've long past cared dragging dumbest across finish line. fault read news article come wrong conclusions. did, different definitions minor inconvenience. Losing smell weeks huge inconvenience me. Getting fever days isnt minor inconvenience. Look numbers that. get benefit doubt? 

Yes. everyone. far common immediately jump conclusions without real evidence back it.  poor people, “inability run 5K” could easily translate people physical disabilities certain lung conditions, etc. totally get frustration around people unvaccinated occupy hospital resources time, think probably half usual cases end ER directly indirectly related personal choice. people choose use motorcycle get crash? someone speeding ran red light? start asking often eat red meat hot dogs end getting colon cancer?

I would really get worried slippery slope start allowing insurance companies adjust rates based arbitrary personal choices. Wrong operating idea actually know masks effective though. 
Aside completely disrespecting Chinese medical experts doctors telling everyone airborne virus wear masks, common sense masks help prevent infection. think doctors wearing masks hospitals COVID? 

The decision CDC made prevent people stockpiling masks medical facilities fully supplied production could boosted mention, they're refusing take experimental vaccine willing take even experimental approach covid treatment?? There's bona fide treatment course established. still trial error. Almost hospitalizations (or deaths) children. hundred under-18 deaths course pandemic, possibility hundred more. Every one deaths preventable allowed kids get vaccinated adults chose vaccinate, still high number. Even vaccination, over-50s much higher risk.

In Colorado 20 pediatric hospitalizations day average 1 day. Pediatric something like 2% total (from several posts /r/CoronavirusColorado). Simply activities scheduled, booster 6 months would preferable booster 8 months. 

Any chance wiggle room getting one here? think sticky. post Reddit someone going ER number days ago. arrived 8AM, update 8PM still seen. thought may appendicitis.

I think perfectly reasonable form go hospital basically says need treatment Covid symptoms unvaccinated, priority may given non-Covid patients. Almost every expert subject disagrees you, mass evidence showing reinfections came out. plan also involves tons extra deaths tons extra chances mutate. West Texas landscape probably wish insurers would stop paying covid treatment non-vaccinated people (obviously excusing people legitimately can’t take them). miracle available chose take it. consequences decision. would stickier question unvaxxed straight nasty treated, bring upon willingly. put different line, sorry sorry. patient 16 unvaccinated. parents antivax, caught whole family got sick. remarks wanted get it, parents it. get lower priority care, parents stupid?

The point triage punitive, looks outcome. one bed available five people could make intensive care, immediately resigning four people death.

So look 'are felons' 'do families', 'are vaccinated', 'what age' 'are obese', latter factors important terms treatment. would stupid hold info that’s outdated “just already said people remember it” literally EVOLVING VIRUS. things supposed change.

Arguably biggest problem covid messaging part message. ""you need wear mask get vaccinated"", little wiggle room future policy revisions. indication policy would need flexible evolving conditions. wait want ten years research vaccine??? time take long? want? Polio era vaccine roll out??  That’s fair discussion also Who's choice be? DNI (do intubate) form file, immediate access MPOA (medical power attorney) surrogate decision maker tells us to. 

Intubating someone severe respiratory distress standard care, regardless age, prognosis, etc. Unless explicit instructions that, default. would grounds major lawsuit states. 

Having said that, often inhumane prolong suffering age. enjoy especially obvious futile family member wanting us it. 

Having said though, seen 90+ year old people come ventilator. tricky. 

The ethics medicine get grey pretty fast. ""flood death devastation"" hyperbole like really subjective extremely misaligned reality vast majority people seeing around them. news throws terms around sew distrust.

COVID extremely contagious, particularly dangerous HUGE majority people. led hospitalization death application tiny probabilities huge populations, change near certainty benign illness person *individually*. Vaccines effectively prevent infection spread, argument ""doing part"" moot, especially recovered people actually *less* likely spread virus vaccinated people. 

People risk vaccinated. healthy, 30, recovered COVID already, give scientific reason forced get vaccine? Statistically, far less likely take hospital bed spread COVID tons vaccinated people. I'm sure article mentions it, according CDC following older adults received least one dose.

75 older - 88.6% 
65 74 - 93.6% 
50 64 - 79.4% she’s still symptomatic, even negative rapid test, get accurate PCR test. vaccinated people life threatening emergencies(strokes, heart attacks, car accidents, etc) receive care unvaccinated difficulty breathing people? know... unlikely is, immensely larger odds vaccinated discharge same.

""It also nothing triage patient""

Agreed...  However specific article exactly slightly alerting triage calculus include vaccination status patient. Therefore current triage run exactly ""win"" think is. read Curb Enthusiasm music started head.  38M confirmed cases.

Maybe 2x~3x times actuals. Depends study want go with, time frame study occurred, area live (FL undercounting say Boulder, CO). Fauci always politician first doctor second. Real medical advice would telling Trump he's wrong said stuff like, ""it's going zero soon"" back March. Generally sexual penetration exchange HIV, generally people stay attached genitals therefore sometimes possible meet evidentiary burden X caused contract HIV. 

With respiratory virus, many ifs, ands, buts, air. could gotten person Z unless prove self quarantine time except one contact, easy truthfully say also could gotten anywhere else, back data. yeah taht mf real blaimed patients. washed hands, used hand san, wore mask, wouln't get sick then.

We've heard  mean *We* expecting anything.

The orange Red White House saying would Easter, little reds believed him. every expert basically said prayer done then. Maybe let faith healers open pop hospitals them.  Overused argument sure overused... ICU wards routinely run around 70%

Well they're running 100% people waiting get in. I'd say closer collapse make seem. messages people need hear vaccines. remember seeing shaking head. told wife flew face logic. course masks would help, since N95s would block aerosols. immediately ordered several boxes N95s. said stockpile food, went Costco stored enough beans rice spices last years. See herd go opposite direction. California absolutely boneheaded public policies around taxation zoning damn weather legal weed sound nice. Shit’s getting expensive Texas it’s like I’ve got ocean, mountains leaf make it. 

I’ve sort come accept ship big turned around life time. Try best get turning future generations rate wanna able smoke able ride motorcycle year round without freezing dying heat stroke, kinda limits west coast maybe coastal New England (still chilly snow packed inland NE). several posts social media account nurses know arguing vaccine mandates unfair them. wish unfollow button satisfying.    Let’s worry actually happening. Patients get triaged time. go ER get triaged. It’s nothing new it’s dangerous threatening.  avoid penalizing small number people can't get vaccinated? collateral? take time check medical records see valid reason? ""Delta double plus good"" variant. 

For love Big Brother haha...that cute hindsight. hard know people think I'm sure everyone's risk reward changed lot past year change. aren’t parents though. give stats entire pop? Like 35-49 something? Massachusetts one vaccinated states. probably many vulnerable unvaccinated people anymore state (and bulk unvaccinated 12 crowd) hospitalize.

Bayes Theorem work. That's happens limited resources. parent 10 yr old returned school, constantly scanning updates vax. point time, can't blame FDA, waiting Pfizer submit data, still collecting. understanding 5-11yr old dosing 1/3rd 12 up. soon close trial data show vax effective - scream FDA get EUA approved ASAP!! now, FDA holding things up. sidenote, 10 yr old smidge bigger, would tempted start asking ""off-label"" vaccination 12 &amp; dose EUA removed. definitely 11 yr olds neighborhood 25% larger 12 yr old already fully vaxed!

If anyone better accurate info - please link - I'd love better informed. creating hot bed vaccine resistant variant develop! Don’t see that’s supposed positive. loads high enough keep 1 r0 vaccinated, eventually another variant. somewhat agree that. Hospitals failing year pandemic. piss poor planning. Politicians planners held accountabile. think mistaking punitive measures unvaccinated people ""refusing pay covid treatment instead"". insurer can't drop getting covid certainly raise premiums refusing vaccine. government can't force needle arm without lot groundwork private company choose business clients. Ironically nationalized health service (the thing people resistant to) would leg stand on. interesting look age demographics also, seems like young state  work healthcare specifically told administrators prior pandemic can’t wear mask patients scare them. THNAK YOU. I'm vaccinated ffs. Sometimes feel like minority actually reasonable smart vaccinated people... 🙄 Nice actually authority something Funny article I'm sorry. That's horrible. Maybe offer combo IV treatment / day pass Disney? phonetic spelling isn’t even good. clarified easy syllables…

Is *mir’* pronounced like *meer* mirror, like *mər* *mur* mirth. really effect vaccination rates?

I already notice lot propaganda twitter full approval, another emergency approval. based real information based dynamics virus changing circumstances. waning immunity mRNA vaccines vaccines low effectiveness beginning everywhere now. responsible health organization we’d tracking breakthrough rate know likely is. Real Alabamamian wrote headline. \~4.4 million officially dead. Pretty sure excess mortality far higher. Would surprised end year, actually past 10million mark. Looks like least end December, estimated underestimated deaths factor nearly 2. there's good chance already past 8 million mark. think Delta? White House mandated vaccination regular testing federal employees. Hopefully straight mandate vaccinations. yeah, right. Please feel free ignore time talk this, idea son-in-law handling coming terms fact straight line drawn irresponsible actions deaths?

I ask unfortunately becoming common, seems like many unvaxxed ""not problem"" mentality first place, I'm interested seeing whether mentality evolves realize impact (in)actions close them. Seriously. Allowing vaccine mandates, mask requirements etc bridge far, felony record a-OK. Never mind deleterious effects going criminal justice system… Something something bootstraps. Something something big government.

Edit: Thoughts healthcare beyond take covid seriously. may missed things. exposed mail? relevant consideration deploy medical resources patients hospital? ""Fuck anti vax crowds, they’re reason problem, rot stretcher hallway.""

As vaccinated person myself... one deserves saying this. Yes, vaccinated done could protect others.

Unvaxxed people risking health risk spreading others.

There ethical dilemma consider unvaxxed person clear present danger everyone, still treated, survives. idiots think mRNA vaccine going change mRNA. peace Trump. doubt, Trump. literally made 30k false misleading statements presidency alone. significant minority still follow word gospel. know people vax would pushing 'hospital fast pass' work.   Blame Canada!  
Blame Canada! know lot parents vaccinated weirdly cautious vaccinating kids. don’t really get it. long apart 2nd 3rd doses?   ""Are diseases contagious and/or could possibly kill maim (exponentially many people) individual?""

I like go-to overused argument people refuse vaccine. Vaccinated btw. entirely wrong Emergency Room situation. treat people order due severity issues symptoms. Vaccination status merit here.  COPD pt Sats low 80's short breath, Asthmatic sats low 80's short breath, treat COPD pt differently even though decided smoke 2 packs day 20 years, whereas Asthmatic smoke. right care judgment. help people pass judgment.

This ER situation say basic clinic.  get choose. Car accident one person drunk driver mom way home work, get treated injuries present, even injuries, treat both. opinions might something totally different that's job treat patients. would trash doctors. soon. New home construction slowing DIY almost standstill. Tree harvesting South increasing many mills increasing overall production. Wait, wouldn’t want treat non vaccinated first? Unless doubts efficacy? Seems kind backwards. fact lowers change severe symptoms would make less priority. 

Or using logic topic?  reaches point fear may joke... God help us start saying right life death. Could've encouraged people make masks supply increased. Could've reached clothing manufacturers coordinate product push time. focus specifically around N95 masks time. Missed opportunity. called ""triaging""? try save all, save many prioritize better chance survival. case, vaccinated. Nope. What's benefit Zeppelins means transportation? slow get tossed around sort wind. like covered wagon sky. Yes has. You’re naive think elderly people weren’t removed ventilators favor younger, healthier people. me, can't trust people willing get fake vaccine cards. know thing.

All takes one person, even vaccine, get enough breakthrough cases.

Well there's problem. Stopping spread high priority, obviously. “Almost got fired”? How? whom?

So sorry grandparents. 70 years person love sounds wonderful. think international travel messy quite time take get vaccines everyone every town/village/province/country, along variant boosters universal vaccine. Perhaps red/amber/green system place travellers. Worse relative. Getting variant immune escape lot less lethal still win. ridiculous. Doctors Asia talking important masking criticizing CDC lying. told general populace make masks - exactly many people numerous countries did. sad part ""a bed becoming available"" usually means someone died.  way allows avoid considering quarter people given country actually evil.

 argument rests assumption people cannot truly evil, otherwise arguing percentages.   It’s good. It’s good example accurate data collection important. personal experiences useful, rarely show whole picture. That’s significantly lower 700 cases reported last Friday 630 reported yesterday. regions reporting cases cases dropping??  jobs start requiring it. that, insurance start.

Correct, greatly reduced rate everyone gets it, much harder covid spread. That’s great, gives shit Sean Penn’s opinion?  ages previous infection, risk low. Infection mediated immunity isn’t quite reliable vaccine immunity adults, kids’ immune systems tend adaptable adults. studies done, wouldn’t surprised childhood infection good.

Yeah, especially quickly bringing case numbers down. herd immunity, could actually short-term policy, something rely basically forever avoid rapid outbreaks overrunning hospitals.

Even SD enforced people turned away point COVID goin like common cold, going get it. sure even debate. shouldn’t matter vaccinated not. always simple ever worse condition gets treated first. whole vaccine thing becoming way political.

AAP many experts, including Dr. Offit (inventor rotavirus vaccine), said FDA’s requirement 6 months follow-up data doesn’t make sense.

Quote: Dr. Paul Offit, member FDA's vaccine advisory committee, said can't understand FDA requested data. ""The longer follow safety make sense. really need two months,"" Offit said.

He committee part approval process even doesn’t agree delay.

'its recommend' 'its mandatory' like first 2 shots rolling out. Yale medicine CDC say boosters eventually needed, I'm sure forced general public soon. makes sense start boosters immunocompromised people, see quickly shifting 'we can't end pandemic unless everyone gets booster' new science showing vaccine looses effectiveness time/how Ineffective varients.

People trying right thing take priority So... administrators practically tried kill avoid upsetting patients? 60% TOTAL US population least one dose. Meaning it’s probably closer 70-75% 12. almost guarantee many mandates come fda given full approval. Fauci hinted couple weeks ago.

I think biggest boosts require fly require schools. Especially 12 gets approved sounds lovely. Great parks there.

I'm Ohio school starting next week. data places yet school boards stubbornly refuse see going mostly mask optional approach (which everyone knows masks). US said people make masks simultaneously anything guarantee supplies pre-made N95's, KN95's etc medical professionals front lines, think people would do? 

Make masks cloth spare time, run Walmart Home Depot panic buy many KN95's possible? someone explain proof vaccination go restaurants (specifically LA) means? 
My dad getting second shot month LA sure he'll allowed restaurants go eat food (we USA, he's already double vaccinated Coronavac would technically 4th shot know US never approved chinese vaccines) even though he's already fully vaccinated, worried he'll denied entry certain places I've also read illegal so, confused, would single shot pfizer enough allowed inside?  totally thought sensationalized news big deal back Jan 2020. feel like idiot. fair us idiots, we've never pandemic like news habit blowing things proportion. really first study this? incompetent be? Yep. sucks, really does. way seperate race/poverty issue fringe Qanoners, it'd different. can't triage people's beliefs, motives beliefs.

There far far fewer black brown folk havin vaccine, even group, lot people thinkin back times white people forced medical procedures black folk. beginning covid, black brown people dying really high rates. wonder government gonna Guinea pig vaccine. anxiety, oppression based anxiety, contrasts heavily white antivaxxers want excuse threaten intimidate communities. Extra bodies would guess, second question, would like know well previously occupied... can't many medical professionals unoccupied days. like staying resort basically 1.5 months school starts? Yikes.  Choosing get vaccinated increases risk hospitalization death. Drug use increases risk hospitalization death. tell personal choices different one another context deserving receive medical care. Extremely hard say. Recently browsed dozen studies get answer this. One study found particulary good one below. focus symptoms present continuously extended period time (and checking present present time infection) include control group. Around 10 % seems plausible according this. knows, estimates really place. clear though many studies: a) Lingering effects happen even mild cases (this usually means: requiring hospitalization) b) Probability lingering effects goes sharply severity initial covid fact got see something good er doc makes happy. I'm sorry mental stress past year brought. understand training still .. feel like nothing could properly prep Yes 80% difficult fda approval flood mandates could see forcing people get due sheer inconvenience vaccinated. think percentage much higher 12, especially becomes required education I’m young enough remember trump said control would away Easter. wouldn’t mask cause made look week. riled base question legitimate virus even is. say gaslit I’m specifically referring previous administration talked handled covid, compared administration. It’s conflicting even basic understanding science. leadership failed miscommunication, freedom Facebook spread misinformation, current situation.

My opinion fact anyone gets butthurt. good point! Found it. could submit data Food Drug Administration review end September, Collins said. But, added, ""I've got honest, see approval kids — 5 11 — coming much end 2021.""

I certainly hope wrong. frustrating. want return normal life kids myself.  That’s article said, name two women. think might right here, though. long back he'd mentioned end 2021 80% people got vaccinated. Pushing months knowing vaccines slowly upticking everyone else getting infected seems pretty realistic. Also fits roughly two-year timeline 1918. true. mother age 68 conservative. one Moderna shot (I surprised even got that) last winter felt enough. Last time talked her, said she’d prefer take chances Covid second shot. mentioned would FDA approved soon, said didn’t put much stock FDA approval either. known Covid exposure last week asked see kids week go lunch me. explain I’d like wait two weeks forgets. She’s sharpest tool shed; gets medical advice Bible pastor…then, actually sick, suddenly doctors God’s work. people real it’s insane! fuuuck That’s next year election year. conservatives point “terrible job” Biden administration combat covid they’ll win votes voters don’t look past want hear. conservative leaders don’t care people die, fact, they’re hoping crisis gets worse win votes next year. That’s awful conservative politicians are. know parent pulled kid grade school due mask mandates. 


Parents problem. Bro, medic also rotated hospitals base. could lot shit nurses do. Insurance denied aren’t vaccinated, purposeful chose overrun health care system easy out. knew risk took, can’t complain consequences. completely disrespecting Chinese medical experts doctors telling everyone airborne virus wear masks

Tbf, stage pandemic CDC made claims, science still whether virus airborne virological sense. IIRC, late spring 2020 definitively knew fact spread airborne aerosols, common vector many viruses including influenza pandemic response plans tailored for. Awww. That’s awful loss. Im glad went together though. I’m sorry. Maryland discussion gone forever regarding things. example, drunk driver runs sober driver, injuring both. sober driver given priority drunk? receive equal treatment?

Now clear fired reason. later arrested? specific reason accessed government network fired without permission (if memory serves used messaging system try convince former coworkers leak data public).

Florida state claimed hacked them, technically true, also tad misleading. Apparently everyone access network used single shared account never bothered change password account fired data scientist.  still doubt enough people vaccinated then. ""Only 2 weeks flatten curve""

Places 0% vaccinated; 100% everything unvaccinated. 
Places 0% unvaccinated; 100% everything vaccinated. world said sports stars long covid? might, probably do. 

But people public announce personal sickness, need study. anecdotes useless, 20 friends likely long term symptoms told you.

Which study looking superior.

And like still shit take  Disinformation, particularly anti-vax kind, always around. problem institutionalized spread disinformation. notable people disingenuously ""just ask questions"" capture proven massive audience, third country. money, lazy, deadly. surgical masks. cloth masks either. 

They're KF94, equivalent N95 South Korea. late January 2020, Korean government sent military help production KF94s Koreans could access them, helped control outbreaks. 

Numerous public health experts US, Ashish Jha, uses recommends use KF94s general public, shown incredibly effective Korea. specify country then

This /r/Coronavirus. global know  Oh, bad. 108 214, Officers died Covid cause combined. rocks rub energy.  stars metric want?

By hundreds, thousands NBA professional soccer players come disease. 

If trying convince 60% infected suffering long covid surely percentage lot too. 

I'm saying young healthy much worry about. telling differently introduce sports stars, group people know come virus, dismiss why, they're fit? fit healthy matter? somehow better small sample size? 

It's something think about. anecdotes.

Yeah, anecdotes much again, claim 60% correct seeing anyway, no? mean, clear hierarchy sources exists. personally, find sports stars personal experience lower actual study.

I know. think study relies self diagnosis information weight small sample size good enough put warning us all.

I don't. fam.

I me, one else will.   Sounds like agreeing me? plenty people saying treat unvaccinated people moralistic reasons.

SEOUL, Aug 24 (Reuters) - People infected transmissible Delta variant viral load 300 times higher original version COVID-19 virus, symptoms first observed, South Korea study found.

But amount gradually decreased time - 30 times four days 10 times nine days - matched levels seen variants 10 days, Korea Disease Control Prevention Agency (KDCA) said Tuesday.

The higher load means virus spreads far easily person person, increasing infections hospitalisations, health ministry official Lee Sang-won told news conference.

""But mean Delta 300 times infectious...we think transmission rate 1.6 times Alpha variant, two times original version virus,"" Lee said.

The Delta variant novel coronavirus first identified India Alpha variant UK.

To avoid spread Delta variant, dominant strainworldwide, KDCA urged people don’t feel badly it.

You want punish people declining vaccine touted cure, seeing isn’t really affective.

Now goal posts moved numerous times battle cry today “Get vaccine - won’t help keep getting Covid lessens symptoms”.  battle cry tomorrow?

People choice due checkered past government sterilizing people, running “tests” people color, lying virus coming lab Wuhan - understandable distrust exist.

We know long term risks vaccines inarguably rushed.

So stop hating people making logical choice.  like numbers? lets talk survival rate get Covid.  survival rate 99%.  

So, start bashing people selfish stupid maybe math explain healthy, slim person underlying health issues astoundingly great chance surviving Covid complications open myocarditis possible death?  Doesn’t add up, it?

And decide going start penalizing people declining vaccination need start penalizing people selfishly irresponsibly become morbidly obese put major strain healthcare system, driving costs us healthy folks.

The obese drain country financially. Obesity starts cascade health events situations like diabetes, needing hip/knee replacements, claiming disablement can’t haul fat asses around anymore, etc. Seconding person said calling messaging primary care doctor, I'm sure could prescribe something phone/internet. could also try going walk urgent care clinic available nearby. might holter monitor available, explain trouble getting care COVID I'm sure they'll understand.

source: pretty bad palpitations years back turned benign required pretty thorough workup Yeah, experts saying it’d go away soon. Pseudo scientists politicians trying make claims. way virus gonna slow everyone board masks vaccines. long idiots think they’re refusal participate Covid prevention measures exercising freedoms, virus going linger. Maybe get norovirus covid time, illnesses battle other, leaving essentially symptom free. go well. died freedom…  would be. I’m talking *long term* here. th future, won’t always middle huge wave, case numbers modest, longer delay might huge deal. Nah well dealing Theta variant point. months? thought 2 weeks. Boy dumb least dumbest. got shot.  lots things going around COVID. toddler flu-like symptoms right tested negative several times, children daycare. stand corrected. friendly site mobile use. still, 100%. heard interview doctor NPR summer part panel. saying hw would wait vaccinating 12-16 year olds children. delta became widespread, listening interview assuredly ""moron"". dehumanizing. allocating valuable medical resources likely survive. tried buy sewing machine make masks Spring 2020. None found anywhere. Vaccines work. Get shots people! mean NG medics able work hospitals time crisis staff themselves?  Thank you! I’m pregnant first husband work home pretty flexible jobs. Really interesting hear two balanced managing schedules. actually think might way us same… hadn’t dawned possible!  College pretty awesome pandemic got tested every 3 days could party wanted testing contact tracing emergant cases got quarantined real quick.  wouldn’t people vulnerable gap shots? Clearly first shot gave modest protection - need second shot quick protection maybe third long lasting protection. HEP-B doesn’t spread fast. later submit application. even here? gambling website probability based people betting. WTF?    Even get half 12 population, that’s another 7-8% total. 

Think ~80 might reach eventually, full approvals kids government/employer mandates, etc etc. Many unfortunately infection. guess hypothetically, came one bed available b/w unvaccinated case breakthrough, discussion triage would look weigh giving preference vaccinated individual due higher chance survival.

Is mean?  tough love antivaxxers missing. Wr done CRAP Yep, (grad) student Texas, really feel you. thing school, supposed person let us know *this weekend/this week* (the first week classes) be.

It’s unfortunate media politicians voting public don’t know interpret graphs I’ve kinda accepted year wash hoping boosters + mandates return next year normal.   respect Fauci feel generally done good job circumstances, wish would stop making blanket statements like this. Delta taught us anything nobody really knows end conditions change rapidly. Fauci makes prediction like gives covid skeptics ammunition question him.  LA hospitals level point. even read this? understand it? say anything claimed. Maybe, learning live hospital capacity. We're fucked point. live LA County - tell normal life like? miss it.  heads up, basically affordable parts California definitely die heat stroke ride kind protective gear/leathers summer. eligible booster 8 months got vaccine even work Influenza spread droplets coughed sneezed infected land peoples faces, hands, surfaces \[fomites\] touch proceed touch faces.

This 4th time read passed weeks.....Living pandemic giving glimpse people went World Wars....I need get poster house.  first-take-correct anything yet? Serious question. Remember, guy said COVID risk United States “minuscule”, first said masks useless one bother wearing them. feel like current narrative true MAY true still really know yet.  Pediatricians experts seem somewhat divided whether Delta actually dangerous kids really different way kids getting infected.  sure seeing showing week 93% occupied mom extremely Catholic Catholic church says must provide care, regardless suffering causes mind.

Yeah, that's church says. Mom also extremely Catholic, I'm way ex-Catholic funny. came time living wills, go whole 9 yards treatments would accept. However, ALSO Dad made medical POA decision maker, knew Mom's views significantly differed mine. relieved one turn bipod. And, BTW, hospice nurse time retired nun, there's that.

Anyway, whole long thing Vatican published last year end life care euthanasia. 

What church says patient obligation receive extraordinary disproportionate care. Ordinary care, yes, extraordinary, no.

So care reasonable chance benefit include excessive burden (including suffering) patient. patient allowed renounce treatments ""only provide precarious painful prolongation life.""

I great love church, helps deal Mom, felt pass along. Also, get living yourself, name someone agrees medical POA. people’s experiences getting 3rd dose immunocompromised US? elderly mother rheumatoid arthritis they’re considering putting steroids/other immune compromising medications. obviously want see vaccinated third prior that. show proof?

Reasonable people need make voices heard stop pampering delusions neurotic people. developed countries can’t think anyone would risk covid save one shot ( especially kids able vaccinated). 

The upside saving 30$, downside covid. pedantic bunch equivalent opinions.

This writer actual subject matter experts highly respected followed comes vaccine trials. Hell, seen breakdown Brasil vs Sputnik. ""opinion"" *this* topic worth 10x David's. doesn’t change fact norovirus rampant many non-cruise vacation destinations. you’re worried illness, avoid crowds general, don’t need demonize one form vacationing others bad. 

Additionally, cruise ships required report outbreaks disease hotels not. Regardless, hotels make news quite often norovirus outbreaks dozens even hundreds people. simple google search pull plenty them.

Reddit loves circlejerk cruises bad, meanwhile Disney Vegas packed brim. makes little sense. Clearly analyzed deeply reasoned everything come conclusion. 😂 false. Modern ammunition may steel copper jacket, bullet within still made lead. Every person get vaccinated risks mutations escape antibodies vaccines. Every person get vaccinated risks infecting people immunocompromised vaccines less effective. Every person get vaccinated risks taking hospital bed could used injuries accidents acute medical conditions need timely intervention.

Not getting vaccinated still fucks people. Smoking eating personal choices, related health conditions still covered. high risk physical activities.

They say get medical coverage fell bike broke arm.

We want go back insurers ability pick choose coverage based medical conditions. think that, I'm going guess never lives old system. Bro we're single handedly holding rest country comes good bbq Well always projection, time politicians media focused “best” case scenario, involved everyone getting vaccinated following health protocols without resistance guess would breakthrough cases. 

Here Florida, DeSantis changed reporting COVID deaths reported daily count death certificate filed day died. Otherwise, waiting backfilling deaths days weeks later. Example: Monday official death count 1 dead COVID-19. total death count went 726 deaths day. Florida recorded 726 deaths due complications COVID-19 weekend. brought state's overall total deaths recorded Saturday Sunday, may occurred previous weeks reporting method, charts always look like deaths Florida falling. propaganda less intelligent eat like high fructose candy.  tough one me. Every fibre anti-vaxxers whose willing ignorance prolonging deadly pandemic. said, I, moral grounds, also like rule rescue think offer care people regardless choices. instance, I’m sure think someone get less resources public health provision they’re obese alcoholic smoker even though could argue personal choices akin getting vaccinated led health states.

I know triage conversations bit different deal chance surviving think that’s fair. hypothetical, philosophical sense, we’re essentially asking degree people’s individual health choices impact obligation them. It’s tough question despite hate anti vaxxers I’m genuinely sure there’s strong argument allowing personal choice change owe one another. feels like slippery slope Spicy take: Schools vaccinate children FDA approval under-12 comes out. Parents flip shit sue whatever. suck up. There's old line Grace Hopper ""it easier ask forgiveness permission"". school still open? I'm asking disease standpoint, staffing standpoint. 22 teachers go still enough staff available subs need lose classrooms?

In school, run tight lose 2 maybe 3 teachers we're trouble.

That's I've used Oakland Fuck treat people based needs. unethical doctors given preferential treatment people make poor medical choices     even conversation wtf. vaccinated. ever ducking dying needs help simple that. 

That’s like saying someone showing hospital doesn’t eat healthy doesn’t exercise deserve immediate care someone exercise eats healthy. Literally take rite aid say booster immunocompromised. refuse. There's no, ""well immunocompromised really?"" questions/challenges anything. infectious, estimated uncontrolled R0 1.8 half infectious original first wave strains Covid, even less Delta R0 6 9, still contagious average seasonal flu R0 1.3.

You correct killed people far quicker Covid far shorter incubation period (1-4 days infection) still contagious pre-symptomatic individuals. like modern flu strains, also likely 40-60% infected people completely asymptomatic, obviously ways test back then.

Ah, finally found really matters people. WTF? Would fair? thing that's *right*. well known, well understood, deadly global pandemic. point, people refuse try protect fellow man given medical treatment unless literally one else needs it.

If willing believe follow basic medical science protect others allowed take away medical resources treatment have?

People willingly refused vaccine yet seek treatment covid turned away hospital *compelled* quarantine home. Let God, spite ignorance save them. Fuggggg Shouldn’t payout *after* someone got second shot? collapsed healthcare system COVID deaths would much higher. We've 1M deaths functioning healthcare system, without would much higher. Sure, we'll treat skinny white males first too. many bullets shot start worrying? months back feels like decades ago now. trying nitpick much, mathematically speaking would still run people left one bed make decision around end though. No, lied masks. Full stop. add on, think messaging problematic clarified properly, reasoning initial advice was:

'""I saying everything knew coronaviruses point told us people likely spread asymptomatic. science time suggested high degree asymptomatic spread. learned more,"" said.'

This case countries actually evidence asymptomatic spread prevalent. Lol lying. time legit lived occasional boiled egg breakfast, plain corn flakes bread. rest inedible, partially food partially bc depression. Lost much weight public defender eventually ask straight meth addict. :/

Fun fact: try use Get Jail Free card Monopoly game provided rack time, guards honor lol  Wanna see x-ray?

I grew Montana fires always thing. years good, years bad.

If live anywhere metro area West Cascades, going immediate threat. Worst smoke comes fires (we got lot bad smoke days California/Oregon fires Canadian fires) makes air quality terrible. Like, go outside without protective masks terrible.

THAT SAID, personally threat annual hurricanes vs. forest fires, would take fires day. read article?

There’s already mandate indoor public places Oregon, right? applying mandate apply crowded outdoor spaces makes sense consistent guidance coming CDC. words, following science.

I hate intellectualism! They’re tempering expectations like always. lockdowns mostly abject failure.

Compare NZ per capita death rate covid last 18 months 1st world countries think again? NZ saved 1000s citizens lives would dead right per capita death rates UK USA. GP's know ton medicine used Russia. Still said vaccines likely hurt way. Weird Russian doctors said 6 months earliest. think insert opinions medicine lot. wonder much additional month two waning vaccine efficacy (especially elderly/compromised) would changes would associated excluding pre-Delta data. Meaning, could much factor Delta itself, etc? still medical professionals argue airborne. wild! Oh, wants good control alright.  That's we've got keep masks schools. inconvenient uncomfortable times, masks hope approved younger crowd. mandate 12's, finally put tragic period behind us.  child still running fever 2nd day, need go another test. first likely false negative. Many urgent cares pushing antibiotics people knowing full well person likely covid simply get door. Pretending difference brand new vaccine virus survivability decades old vaccines much lethal viruses again, dishonest stupid. 

To clear, *I* personally think reason scared/nervous vaccines, I'm habit taking medicine unnecessarily. Vaccinating someone like sole benefit making people whipped irrational hysteria comfortable, care people inability think critically. 

I great job doubt corner getting advice lawyers, order cover asses idiots would sue. When/if day comes, I'll get it. I'm far caring enough die hill. Simple work around: Approach problematic communities front get sick. Either get vaccine accept lower prioritization future.

The “ma freedoms” mask nonsense supporting people like current governor also risks kids’ health. kids already sacrificed slow COVID boomers probably ever will.   given.

 Take UK: high vaccination rate, island border controls, public health. cases worse US, current rates slightly worse Missouri. 

 hardly isolated example. France, Israel, Spain - countries vaccination rates comparable vaccinated American states - problems COVID. *THIS THING HATES HEAT*  Yeah unvaccinated adults acquire immunity old fashioned way seems.

Honestly, buy good percentage people, like think addicts inherently bad people. still treat people become, think important place lions share blame feet actually responsible parties.

Refusing vaccine, unless good medical reason (severe medicine allergy, condition may make taking vaccine threat life), also make conscious moral choice disregard wellbeing health others. Willingly risking lives others.

Ahh yes- ol “do happen” never happens. Efficiency vaccines [delta] keep dropping. 70 60 40. [...] vaccines seem to, best, give 30% chance avoiding catching virus. 
 
Do sources numbers? That’s GIANT “if”…  would disagree it’s everyone’s responsibility look one group. understand vaccines help also produce side affect confidence thinking back normal never turns brings us back beginning wear mask, social distance wait go don’t need to. 
I’m vaccine works isn’t flu chicken pox polio new virus don’t completely understand treat such. challenge becomes available resources.

Prior COVID average ICU stay 1 day, patients COVID median length stay **7 days**, often more. worth deny care 7 patients needing ICU care take care 1 anti-vax patient? Well, yes. Selfishness frequently seems one defining traits Boomer generation. people would rather let schools close wear mask.

And complain awful NTI schools close, kids quarantine due exposure (which apparently thing require masks). Cool. lot us don’t. doesn’t make better us — it’s way things are. many unvaccinated people even us get vaccinated constantly barraged virus close work environments? mention CDC reversing mask recommendations fact Texas run idiot panders idiot base. never happen United States. couldn’t even get folks agree wear mask. We’ll ride unfortunately. Literally figuratively individuals.   even vaccinations matter. vaccinated 50 year old likely recover unvaccinated 40 year old?

I’m sure national rate, varies lot state state. California, COVID death rate unvaccinated cases 58 times higher (5800% higher) vaccinated. Texas, 78 times higher. Oregon, *only* 8 times higher.

So yes, vaccinated 50 y.o. much much likely survive unvaccinated 40 y.o., else mandate pretty meaningless mandating something already done. Finally someone understand real problem, Unless poor countries get vaccinated least 25%+ end year good possibility new variant emerge Many people go crazy paycheck delayed day sick leave. Many work service job puts high risk infection, gives little sick leave pay enough save. Many going get tested mild sickness going go work sick. 

Unless pass law giving full pay 10 days, mostly going make people get tested. Even someone plans quarantine, there's risk getting felony charges go somewhere reason. risk mild case. need hospitalization, they'd probably test benefit testing positive. 

The plus side, fewer people test positive, claim cases going down. Imagine ""not realizing"" risk.

Overreactions. Note applies Disney World employees; many Union employees across globe. also gives exemption religious beliefs, making worthless. Hahah happening dumb Americans 10/10 Oh yeah, university requiring vaccine still wear masks. Great.

Same. insane. moving bar impossibility crazy unwillingness accept clear endemic future.

The 75% taking single GSW's excerpt Carl Freeman Trauma surgeon. 

A guy knows lot operating GSW's either us.

My initial post stating arrived hospital likely make &amp; super imperative cut right away. Especially care taxed enough is. I’m guessing, maybe data review. adults teens FDA 2 months follow-up data. younger children required 6 months data. US getting control virus.... Outdoor mask mandates arguably pointless mandate is, unless it’s specific situations outdoor concerts. 

No one gonna enforce outdoor masks randomly public, police don’t seem care masks sure won’t enforce public. Plus, Covid doesn’t spread nearly well outdoors. 

This Governor seems putting mandate in, make look like she’s something, even thing largely pointless. FYI details Cook Islands' Covid-19 response vaccination program found TLDR: vaccine used Pfizer sourced via New Zealand. Cook Islands also operate 4-level alert response system. Although still always Covid-free, Cook Islands currently Alert Level 2 (social distancing limited-size gatherings) due current community outbreak NZ.  Breakthrough cases happen frequently lot spread. people vaccinated, less spread is. Vaccinated people cause spread, population-level vaccination significantly reduces Rt. *everyone* vaccinated, Rt would likely 1 almost populations (outside special cases like military ship). 

There far fewer breakthrough cases Massachusetts Georgia - community spread lower people vaccinated. vaccinations important all, self. 

Unfortunately without mandate, 100% vaccination happen. Ergo, spread happens level high enough create persistent cycle breakthrough cases. 

Don't ignorant. Even break cases... taking horse medicine FDA approved vaccine, mocked. People eligible vaccinated vaccinated treatments paid for. people hospitalized Covid hospitalized Covid? We’ve couple vaccinated patients came something entirely different tested positive little symptoms Alcoholics rarely get new livers drink their’s death. thing people kidney failure due non compliance medication. 

It already happens whether like not. Couple Hungary. Lol degree normality talking about? Life US 100% normal since June exception masks states.  look like n95 type masks. work way ""10% time"" medical professionals working infectious patients wear them. 

And even shitty fabric masks worn 100% compliance work 10% time decent job keeping droplets reaching someone else's respiratory tract.

But even 100% compliance followed 10% deaths prevented would least 450,000 lives saved globally. Seems worth me.  Exactly. said that, Delta lit 5 alarm fire vaccinate globe… far see not.  think obesity addiction something stopped single shot covid is. mom youngest 5 (living) siblings. 4 got vaccinated. aunt Liz decided wait see. Welp, guess who's hospitalized covid... strange feeling worried loved one simultaneously angry af brought upon herself. coworkers family members gotten shot can't engage. I'm basically avoiding interaction emotionally can't handle malarkey. That’s police officers unions civil servants protected status also less rights certain areas. It’s places like Germany. working stressed hospital someone coughed face don’t think could stop hitting them. would make Chef Ework. :) Yeah, know someone went culinary school went way, specialized baking pastry, makes custom wedding cakes. 

I hand, known sometimes cook ramen eating it.  true. vehicle proven ready (lipid nanoparticles). modify payload target soemthing specific ready mass produce. I'm arguing extremes all, I'm saying would accurate say enough research data Coronaviruses time make declaration asymptomatic spread based examples SARS-1 MERS alone.

Using research two viruses make blanket statement coronaviruses irresponsible since clearly enough study done human coronaviruses make claim. really feel bad 5% deaths vaccinated. deserve this.    It’s odd 30-49 crowd 78%, would parents deciding kids. It’s odd.

Now left field. I'm guessing LA mandated figures needs well.

This happens governor clue office replaced previous one gave kickbacks girlfriend.

Between her, Cuomo, Insley, Abbot counting Biden Trump obvious leadership goddamn clue. feel like point never over. point people vaccinate done outside stragglers areas available. going continue drag solid half population, kicking screaming, every inch ground. Eventually everyone else get sick, time recover virus mutate we'll start over. fe er ls incredibly hopeless times. think realistic option straight leave th er behind. Every single good service need ls come 'no vaccine, service' qualifier. Name shame. Make sure future employers see much liability are. NY deaths, mostly first wave far smaller amount January (although equally sad).

Florida three death waves, biggest yet. entirely preventable. figure I'd post data point one ever seems talk hard metrics EMS activity county level. I'm East Texas rural county 60,000, monitor police radio traffic recently switched EMS rise Delta.

Here county EMS area, past 11 days, 244 EMS dispatches total, counting patient transfers, 45 calls COVID-related apparent COVID-related, total 18% calls. calls evident (generalized shortness breath) scientifically accurate anything, think numbers pretty close, within 5%.

Our hospital ER (Level IV Basic trauma facility) busy appear backlogged. However CANNOT verify what's going walk-ins, that's radio. one instance 18th three EMTs waiting ambulance bay patients 30 minutes rooms available.

The EMS vehicles currently authorized transfer patients county unless ordered hospital, appears become new policy put effect last week presumably keep vehicles county. One two patients day transferred Level II trauma facilities. often clear transferred for, sounds like mix various conditions.

Sure would nice got people kind logging work local areas. need $25 SDR card, receiving software, patience learning setup. especially like DSDPlus offloads transmission WAV file, named time, talkgroup, radio ID. listen live, go recordings end date log text file. Municipal cities likely heavily trunked may need DSDPlus Fastlane Unitrunker (neither I'm familiar with). Many cities use digital systems (mine uses NXDN96) cities may using encryption. I'd suggest going /r/RTLSDR forums.radioreference.com learn more.

In case great way seeing kind picture local area. big city likely going impossible figure what's going possible keep track everything. Also radio cover COVID walk-ins, I'm sure there's proportionally them, many probably go urgent care well. one case dataset yesterday 57 yo COVID patient visited family doctor hypoxia 72% O2 sat, call ambulance. legend. Sorry unclear. people going homes test people probably situation first place smart decisions would made. 

It seems reactionary rather proactive. South Bay LA county... (and we, mean me) boudin jambalaya, but... I'm sharing. number people alive comes down, it’ll meet number people vaccinated coming up. Like flu. lol study stopped collecting data delta thing? See attitude realized can’t get ICU get car accident appendicitis. there’s negative beds, I’d wait. live Alabama. employer requiring come office despite able WFH.   one lockdown April nothing.

Oh humanity! NO. Reddit wants WILLFULLY unvaccinated GET FUCKING VACCINE. know that’s minority. would vaccinated person need treatment nurse, it’s embarrassing

Well lot respect nurses, people---- let somehow missed science lessons make feel embarassed.  fault.  


Patients (customers) health care facilities, etc. need refuse around un-vaccinated HCWs, esp. small exam rooms, etc..   


I practice recently exam room, door shut. Alone, nurse. admitted vaxxed, (I ask, volunteered info) though wearing mask.  room small door closed well window.   


I politely removed exam room, paying customer, take business elsewhere.  


And.......I did.  emergency visit thankfully, choices.  practice acctually needs non-emergency patients, business survives customers...... look elsewhere them, one them. Good enough China, good enough us.  blame POC hesitant get vaccine government conducted programs like Tuskegee experiment? No.

How much longer going bend backwards POC community reason. Times changed, vaccine given millions already.  vaxxed. honeymoon booked paid Maui. I’m going feeling bad it. I’ll bring negative test. 

The fault lies anti-vax local Hawaiians large.

While people getting vaccinated means less variants easier mitigate control.

Canada might different laws allowed that. understand correctly constitutional protections guarantee free travel states US locking Hawaii would federal law even though island totally different/separate rest states. What? don’t think devastating right way put it. Perhaps “could pose risk” vaccinated close correct cry hard, reported yesterday time health authorities expressed confidence got control.

Like you, sad get away them. yet. “We’ll home Christmas!” vibes Yeah, don’t want children sick hospital,  Theres always going new variant, keep shit little dying going living hell years. 

People vaccinated dragged people chose take risk getting ill, that’s them, us. ethical philosophizing required, straight triage question. arithmetic issue moral ethical one. Misleading title - actually one story, repeated 21 times. That's even factoring toll virus taken parts world limited abilities keep track deaths. Hopefully, many areas isolated manage avoid serious outbreaks, takes one person traveling asymptomatic case sub-Saharan Africa instance trigger outbreak could kill tens thousands alone...

I think full estimate total killed Spanish flu decades pandemic ended, doubt pandemic take long us make estimates for, could definitely terms total killed. Wikipedia's list pandemics, already #8 terms deaths. fault lies ~~anti-vax local Hawaiians large.~~ tourists showing fake vax cards, breaking quarantine, etc.  You’re right, obese unvaccinated people Yeah announcement today, NIH director part shon't people understand? really need least make exceptions family loved ones. getting really cruel point. Especially even idea end let alone sort roadmap date roadmap... completely dark. Almost issue currently happening family. deaths yet (knock wood) I'm already furious. long hospitals overwhelmed can't learn live this. functioning health care. can't run hospitals full capacity room. 

The virus care hopium. hope means 130 students requested exemptions. That's number given dropped, skimming article could tell requests there.

If so, hopeful exemptions may prominent fear. (hopefully) 130, denied that's pretty small number students receiving them. Sadly, know many educated well-to-do people aren’t vaxxed think know medicine doctors do. Go get one others… one else seems want lol , you’ll probably save discarded second semester nursing school last day spring break, noted state would lockdown. number students sense gotten license downplayed before, downplayed after, still so... words. No, would unvaccinated. First loads going USA go deep USA already huge shortage truck drivers.

You live fantasy land forgetting tens thousands workers cross daily essential workers.

And biggest fail point canada test anyone entering America Covid till Jan 2021.  it’s worth, KY Democrat gov state legislature state Supreme Court whatever strip authority. 


For example, mandated masks schools state Supreme Court ruled doesn’t authority mandate masks via executive order ended it. rip Yeah cause that's slippery slope  guess people don’t read newspapers listen news. Covid killing people, it’s sucking medical resources  extent critical care measures cannot administered. It’s like happily living Ignorance Island without care world. like ""oh no! hoped one country right!"" noticed old news, 41 new cases reported yesterday. first wave take bite not. Western pa instance spared 1st wave.  1st huge surge winter NE effectively working 2nd 1st way deadly learning fly. Right third shot thing. believe approval process booster targeting new strains. Hopefully soon. give much better immunity.   I'm going play devil's advocate point ""just"" making antibodies complicated step that's fully understood. Empirically, vaccines work, believe hubris assume understand human body molecular genetic level.  Median age 31. Youngest state country.

This something people take consideration looking overall vaccination rates. Utah higher percentage people eligible vaccine (under 12) states. Back July governor announced 70% Utah residents eligible vaccine received I'm sure higher know find data. Percentage eligible people vaccine better metric total population determining well vaccine received though. I’ve never cruise ship always found funny swimming pools everyone already surrounded water. Also, what’s point going one you’re visiting one city couple hours?  Good luck going Facebook. non stop anti-Biden, anti-mask, anti-vaccination America run ground liberals. get handle social media, nothing going change.  Obviously difficult situation, considered rapid testing immediately seeing and/or masking? hate see families torn apart this, sometimes practical solutions even face irrational behavior. extremely high bar. He'd realistically tested positive Covid knowingly done something somebody high risk infection.

From brief description, feeling well around Covid positive people likely going cross bar criminal negligence. without going struggle lawsuit. Mississippi public schools got 6,000 cases 20,000 people quarantine two weeks.

Granted places America shitty vaccination rates, going different version story everywhere. unlikely event hospital one remaining bed

I mean, exactly kind situation we're talking here? refuse someone care? job loss also health. One central reasons unions exist ensure workplace safety workers getting killed maimed job. Ensuring everyone vaccinated also workplace safety issue especially working indoors. imagine spring 2022 people vaccinated boosters, Covid (and posses natural anti-bodies). course would month everyone got vaccinated.

But current conspiracy vaccines poison everyone gets one dead 4 years.  wife argued years stepson going back school homeschool. He'd developmental issues made early school difficult working got much better time advocating return regular school 4th grade. wife said she'd let return 6th go it.

I pretty upset felt like missing ton socializing skill building school. Things like getting school, getting to/from school, ordering food school lunch simple things really happen homeschool way.

Anyway, wife finally gave attend regular school 8th grade loved it.

Then, Covid hit end 10th grade year. He's virtual ever since graduate high school without going back school.

I remember wife telling ""There's gonna plenty time still many years regular school."" -_- saw posted work. 

The problem world stupid people full confidence, and, smart people full doubt believe it? vaccines stay US till we're triple jabbed. time next year he'll saying spring 2023. 98のに対して、私は送られたものthe を添付している98ののためにaを添付a couple Maybe look delta spread close 90% vaxxed countries. view selfish selfish, stupid. like anti-masker. one those, sorry offended delicate sensibilities. I'm foreman, avoid talk radio etc company truck. I'm driving job site, apprentices truck listening local music station. news comes on, announcers says, vast majority hospitalization state unvaxxed. one apprentice, starts screaming, bullshit. Scares hell everybody truck. live special reality, that's sure. awesome info, thanks adding here. Much appreciated!  Looking around online, I’d say much depends restaurant. I’d call ask directly rather asking here. Living thought given much perspective read stories people living dark periods history out.. Unfortunately thats case Oregon, mask mandates active. still bad time attend throw social events public spaces.  COVID? likely infected likely incubate new mutation am. *am* reinfected, extremely unlikely disease would severe, fact probable outcome would *less* severe (initial sickness par standard cold).

I'm sorry saying completely unsubstantiated. triage, treatment would also based vaccinated person's age comorbities well. elderly overweight would likely get passed someone 20s someone shape.

It would likely first come first serve. unvaccinated person arrives first they're going care vaccinated person comes four five hours later. What's stopping you? people moved on. That’s good he’s spot everything far….cough cough Fauci, Feb 2020, saying threat minuscule masks needed. week, maybe 8 9 days. Yeah get winded quite lot, heart/lungs hurt physical long, get tired quick Yeah, sequel hit market hotter original. Yeah older family member stage. Definitely can’t understand feeling. suppose it’s process get point. New York requiring attest immune issue order get 3rd shot, requiring doctor's note etc. sure universal states though. http://katytimes.com/stories/memorial-hermann-closes-3-stand-alone-ers-in-greater-houston,4650 Yeah, skeptics like children. hearing want. ""You said going McDonald's lunch. lied!"" No, said cleaned room, could go McDonald's lunch. room cleaned. delta spike really peter UK... big spike around euro 2020 final, followed weeks lower cases, rise now. Scotland opened schools cases immediately rocketed upwards. 7 day average deaths 100 climbing gradually, look ideal weeks school university reopens. sick gonna get better We'll likely hear similar stories happening around US soon. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Yes, got point agreed it, though disagree ""not anyway same"" hyperbole. similar easily closing border tightly pursue COVID zero strategy would likely mean US Canada border would allowed open till 2022 even later.

If could replay whole thing looked future, guarantee yhou exactly would done.

One hanging thread: essential workers crossing border? Simple, choose one side stay there. necessary, pay Canadians stay home, cheaper hospital costs actually paid. America take care usual loving care attention. mean, definitely fuck anti-vaxxers people actively spreading misinformation. They're hook. too. actually one best summers ever had, except everything costing money...but hey working class America always gets shat on. Same. I'm sure next press conference...
