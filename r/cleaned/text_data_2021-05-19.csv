Beyond that, there's fact internal spread significant issue. result, spread comes outside - future tourists/traveling business people/ppl crossing porous border yunnan/warehouses import stuff (most earlier outbreaks traced imported frozen seafood). Surprise surprise, prioritize vaccines locations exposed risk factors. case flu vaccine numbers average reported incidents approx 25 year period. That's range is. COVID numbers actual reported incidents/doses administered time pulled, something like 2.7 5 respectively moderna/pfizer. think he's trying upset them.

Another addition sources I’ve provided. 

I already committed sources provided bullshit accusations claimed support provided none counterclaim, 

If you’re questioning anythive said point counter arguments amount “teach can’t bothered,” right denying reality, 

Notice you’re specific anything said wrong. overly vague deflecting misrepresenting bare minimum sufficient. 

What misinterpret? Please specific. addition haven’t backed claim previous administration way competent. 

And you’ve backed claim were. point times lied you’re genuinely interested learning more, again, might point vast resources fingertips. 

I clearly pointed wrong called outright attempts lie.

If you’re claiming anything saod wrong specific quit cowardly I’m done “arguing” appears bad faith. 

So, you’ve reached point you’re entire argument exposed BS must arguing bad faith?

Could point single counter argument made incorrect bad faith?

Probably right. happy us don’t suffer longer previous administration’s botched handling.

But pointed wasn’t botched current administration hasnt actually done anything different regards vaccine roll out. Kids sacrificed entire year school, sports, parties friends keep adults alive. read idea? think vaccine passports terrible idea. think wearing vaccine card lanyard dumb.

Why conclude that? made statement clear, lifting mandate vaxxed effective lift mandate all. assholes need go hide home keep fears themselves. afraid get vaccine, fine. choice. Stop trying infect others diseased thinking. Back time village idiots stayed village, laughed ignored.

Nowadays Facebook spread idiocy village idiots. No, wrong equating policy decisions made March April 2020, vaccines general lack understanding treat COVID, now. ton vaccines available cases going go down.

You're wrong failing note last year time positive acceleration cases, negative acceleration cases. FaceBook curse humanity. risk flu every year never arms you? exporting 100m doses sucks :(
There clear timeline Canadian government. Border measures arbitrary closures popular way win votes unfortunately doubling that. That’s works. 

The efficacy ratio placebo vaccine groups. threshold required 50%. saw higher efficacy rates experts talking needing 70%. 

Also isn’t taking account evidence breakthrough infections viral shedding greatly reduced. 

So it’s simple.  keep us suspense. go back 0 last Easter? did. read multiple times. issue seems u either aren’t aware there’s massive vaccination campaign going that’s already administered hundreds millions doses u don’t think vaccines work. longest time, goal “flatten curve” prevent hospitals collapsing. done that. It’s time start moving improve vaccination uptake. find Monday saved shit hole. Ready comment, genius. I’m cool don’t think it’s going happen. realistic measures? seems like actual point post want vaccine passports, different discussion issue “should CDC issued scientifically backed statement fully vaccinated people safely unmask.” Couldn’t agree more, well said! u talking about? people risk able gotten vaccinated.  Wait, stockpiling vaccines? people use vaccines? They’re going expire time. Hospitals cancelled cancer treatments make way coronavirus victims protect cancer patients. getting treatment protecting cancer patients. Cancer treatment optional fun. federal reserve literally printed like 1/4 total US dollars circulation year... brought much logic radically biased cursed place AKA Reddit also given like 600,000 doses 16 days ago. would better used elsewhere.

Also kind misses point dont think vaccine put extraordinary said was. booster possibility exactly I'm rushing it. starts sound like booster help variants next months, wait.
 
There's bit guilt associated thought well. many billions people unable access vaccine all, I'm sure feel going getting two them.. EPL starts back August, stadiums going filled again. “We witnessed levels stupidity didn’t expect think possible. choosing keep mandate.”

“This can’t nice things.”  ""we're keeping hospitals protect immunocompromised"" ballshit (like already got comment here?). I'm immunocompromised, need cancer treatment much avoiding COVID, everyone told apparently getting treatment surgery good... know talking science changed. science consistent non-vaxed people risk. CDC said it. also said would honor system--a thing social science public health science shown us, repeatedly, something Americans broadly abide by.

But ok. lmao nobody said like May last year  100% agree this. someone interacts scientists there’s never confusion part communicated. 

Turns Fauci fantastic scientist researcher severely overestimates intelligence humanity large portion American public. I've never fan unwalkable communities employment system endorsed government forces us buy drive cars roads people drive buildings. think dying necessarily, think every time go work risking (at best wearing out) expensive property it. already crappy largely accepted reason even though relatively recently even impossible require cars. I've thought, though got J&amp;J would looking one others. However, also suspect they'll come boosters, might best wait that. Almost like even 50%yet  Wow, almost like vaccinations control virus prevent spread. know, one thing make US economically competitive vs China is... full vaccination.

Guess we’re going way irrelevance. moderator bots shit. don’t understand feel need dictate people talk Covid. Let users talk however want, politics ends dominating discussions it. It’s people’s platform anyway. 

I vote get rid bots. heard Dr. Fauci day say winter surge would unlikely. never responsibility, OK Jan.

I feel like missed point post. Yes, totally right May 2021 March 2020 absolutely comparable. Nothing like vaccines readily available way information disease happened last year. hopefully stays way. 2 turns 4, 4 8.

We've I'm waiting South Korea open take twice postponed trip think people overestimate effectiveness vaccines directly protecting you, underestimating overall effects vaccine's protect (which include lower spread). 

People think makes practically invulnerable catching symptomatic COVID. That's true. besides direct protection give, high rate vaccination community greatly helps chances lot less likely even come contact virus. 

The vaccines important. Unless really specific issue (like currently chemotherapy), get vaccinated. There's least **some** indication combination mRNA vector based vaccines provides stronger protection either alone. say infections, constantly reporting new cases reporting contain it.

Of course vaccinate population, borders effectively closed, mandatory 2/3 weeks quarantine. situation can't maintained, need open back up, every country closed borders. thing pisses see someone mask they're driving themselves. know triggers me, otherwise mind masks would continue wearing one deterrent work situations reason. We’re Endgame everyone.

Fact! That's factually inaccurate. Mask protection effective infected wearer utilizes it.

No inconsistency. thing cdc saying months. Try again. compare US UK. Yeah, thought same, bump mentioned month ago. sort proves point. many people vaccinated back still much surge. think we'll see another wave significance point. Certainly enough stretch hospital resources. say probably wait extra shot Novavax better Big oof Yes, has. American living province Quebec. I’m back states now. states feel months ahead—Quebec *just* opened vaccines general adult population, people waiting months second shot. Canada’s approach matches, like glove, healthcare system. Want see doctor? Good luck. Quebec you’ll wait four years assigned family doctor. I’m crossing fingers start letting people get second shot, going create long time “until X% fully vaccinated.”

Canadians think Canada’s healthcare system far superior US simply living reality. Congrats rational neighbors! Vaccine cards.

If worried unvaccinated people lying vaccinated, mandate vaccine cards show proof vaccination. think unnecessary, I'm completely fine it. Yep. Still vaccine hesitancy parts Europe, play Reddit Twitter. Exactly. headline try scare everyone. variants. vaccines completely dominated variants. Rob government get shot/killed/jailed 1000 years. 

Government robs us, understanding. Jfc 😂 Ok. Sorry. tired anti vaxxers downplaying effectiveness trying dismiss fact vaccinated safer going event driving it.  Thought one them. Yeah, may well. Yeah guess depends definition. local amusement park 'open' limited capacity reservations only.  soonest could book reservation three weeks means me, effectively closed next three weeks 'open' day closing another set period time. That's far would consider open. JCVI even employed government civil service. day jobs professors etc.

Are suggesting would undermine academic integrity please Boris? thank don’t even remember situation murder hornets came about. US absolutely crushing Canada comes raw numbers. suspect it’s much difficult hit higher percentage increase total number people, space people live in. 

Canadians like define “not americans,” truth America far better job vaccinating it’s citizens Canada ever could. Canada depends US, it’s quite simple. don’t open border, lose lot money US tourism. 20 hour delay fetching comments.

Is kind crap American thing? companies first world countries allow pull kind sh\*t? least cash incentives life saving vaccines. Exactly. Colleges requiring make big difference. jobs requiring mask vaccinated. don’t know, it’s north Raleigh far Cary. didn’t see notice walking announcing change mask requirements. I've personally known lot people finally getting first week mask summer. dont really understand it, fair number people waiting incentive mask enough. let rip going happen earlier. think South Africa got spooked disappointing early results decided worth collect real world data. shots administered today, reported. could given time report, lag times varying lot depending data flows. Here's [CDC tabulation administration  link one instance: Google search. mean bring crack inner cities, give black people syphilis, slaughter native Americans, etc it’s unbelievable person functioning braincells

Not sure we're going constructive talk here. Take care dude ends end June apparently Teens care lot others think. super surprising § 18.2-422 (the mask law) waived since March 2020 waived length public health emergency declared COVID. I’m wondering long health emergency ended considering would end mask waiver. Tbh I’m surprised didn’t amend law last session. really think fly? grocery stores restaurants? That’s way less likely happen going back universal masking. 

Don’t get wrong I’d love happen there’s fucking way gets implemented. exactly . agree soeren you. 

there another problem looking back way started : least Italy find origin 2 tourists. course conditions optimal virus again...2 individuals able infect almost entire country.

now vaccinated big help, within unvaccinated spread variants too.

let's say point infections spread unvaccinated unvaccinated still get scary number.

there ONE way: vaccines

no way. they’re idiots. Ask difference EUA approval. $100 says don’t clue. Visiting Bay Area everyone masked. take sign community cares it’s wonderful. Mandate ends soon knows happen. Today great. Well certainly changed habit finding ""best people"". mean China USA? China does. Western world knowledge anyone information whether AstraZeneca vaccine effective South African COVID-19 variant? source could find 2 month old study efficacy 10%, seem right see recent studies challenge it. folks know 16+ rate dropping! We're seeing bit boost 12-15 age range. We're 550K over-18s 737,424 day last week almost exclusively adults since approved 12-15 yet. I’m concerned heard Oregon lifting mask mandates requiring businesses check vaccination cards - business cannot effectively doesn’t want to, everyone wear masks. 

I sinking feeling CA way lift mandates capacity June.... anyone else thoughts? look supply numbers paint picture get administered early Good thing “poor education” doesn’t exist Canada. goal posts moved. anything moved goal posts. 

Look, don’t want hold government officials accountable bad policy making you’re either extremely partisan idiot. tell one? Try projections mask use removed. Possibility another wave September? actually good point, though know relevant since widespread covid vaccine doubt manufacturer would attempt use again. Masks offer protection wearer. protection may vary it’s there.  fucking shit CDC fucking stupid. think gonna happen? 8 positive tests per 100k people.................. evidence lab created?  oh, trying spread kids.... well, make sense. Thankfully mild symptoms?

thanks link! Sometimes kill exactly ! must protect children convince anti-vax get vaccinated. Lockdowns reduce deaths don’t anything “beat” covid. We’ve seen time time Hospitalization concentrated deaths, though. vaccines, someone 85 10x chance 30-something hospitalized, 200x chance dying: even high elderly vaccination rates, possible overstress medical system, nevermind possible complications getting bad case matter young. That’s right! knew something power really lazy bother looking (I spend evenings looking things enough husbands random questions me, didn’t care I’m app already).

But yea, 2 serious high numbers, too, right? They’re excuse hired contractors something, weird. lol say Trust Science complaint people saying trust science? assumptions cover up. 

For example, cite allowing international flights sign cover up, reality, even bans, flights allowed citizens recalled, nationals FLY get back countries. 

Imagine someone like would say stopped Westerners leaving.  seen ""good solution"" made mind repeating again.

I threw strict vaccine card requirements letting vaccinated people maskless. like idea, despite fitting requirements. Mine already had. CDC said small groups vaccinated people allowed indoors together, let us take whole department got vaccinated. five department did, we’ve mask off. Thank goodness, air conditioner hasn’t working well lately, marks miserable it’s hot.  Literal ""tribes"" living land hunter gatherers medicine men trust vaccines people. Maaaaaaan don’t mind new ones, old, boxy D90s beautiful. one Cary Morrisville quit washing grocery carts two months ago. Immunibooty, will. Got vaccinated Monday, fixed appointment 2nd dose September 6 way take sooner apparently agree, saw comments wrote thoughts UK going learn lesson Israel US learned. Young people: Teens 40s main spreaders. get massively reduced death older populations vaccinated little 40 vaccinated leaves opportunity spread wide open. Israel US cases kids started going regulations relaxed people resumed normal life. seemed stop 20s 30s started getting vaccine. hospitalizations deaths there? zero would guess.  Thank you! Happy join Pfizer fam get back little bit normalcy second shot (definitely still masking though!) know work needed vaccine ASAP.

This say.

Apparently, COVID-19 nasty symptom inducing goldfish memory segments general populace. Mexico substantially worse US, [estimates 600,000 Even best case scenario official numbers accurate, Mexico got 1,697 deaths per million US got 1,809 - pretty similar numbers even though Mexico much younger population. draconian lockdown first wave. suddenly, people thought Indian subcontinent special resistance, reopened massive, massive gatherings predictably huge superspreading events. Religious festivals major importance millions attended went home quarantine. Paywall, could please post link full text. Still, kind disheartening makes feel like got vaccinated nothing, even that's really true.  *variant first wave die quickly without kind widespread death? know simple answer variants, really entire story? hospitals still space good metric run I've India, must say Westerners grasp populated India is. Mumbai people entire Australia. I'm even Westerner. risk repeated injections Adeno Virus Vaccines due Vector immunity

Would mind enlightening heathens please? try search come much Yeah, I'm asking really. seems like there's lot talk passports real action outside NY HI. think they're going become moot point another month two. everything. South Asia actively shutting down. Fuck Oregon's government that. know read something concern regarding whether single doses transmissibility reduction might high enough depending much contagious Indian variant ends being. 

Once two weeks past second dose ability infect others notably lower single dose. could difference R0 1. No. COVID levels low variants aren’t competing hosts. Rather growing/shrinking different rates. 

So started 100 Kent cases 100 Indian cases, current U.K. conditions, might expect 80 Kent cases next week 150 Indian cases. competition needed. not. still waiting.   guess? seem skeptical. Why? New variant, infectious. fragile others. little surprised actually last long. *Shocked Von Der Leyen face* CDC lost credibility couldn’t create test virology grad student could knock day. remember botched repatriation flight testing people base California.

It’s wonder getting new leadership. ordered tighter surveillance rare fungal disease hitting COVID-19 patients, officials said Thursday, piling pressure hospitals struggling world's highest number daily infections novel coronavirus. Mucormycosis, ""black fungus"" usually infects people whose immune system compromised, causing blackening discolouration nose, blurred double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties coughing blood. hospitals crematoria overflowing health system overwhelmed, widely accepted official figures grossly underestimate real impact epidemic, experts saying infections deaths could five 10 times higher. States implementing getting at, even though thats means practice course

Just talking discourse around Masks like ninja.

Ninjas wear masks too. Cases localised areas Indian variant identified rapidly increasing, areas doesnt affect national figures yet. vaccine looks holding though 95 percent 50s vaccinated, really matter doesnt translate hospitalizations deaths COVID started, first thing said ""India FUCKED""

Im sad see right :/ That’s cool I’d like first dose please Pretty much better US. considerably poorer. Plus, Mexico's one country even fatter US. vaccine-passport debate (not travel, every-day activities)

Have states apart NY HI actually developed vaccine passport? HI one seems focused avoiding testing/quarantine requirements inter-island travel rather everyday activities. couple dozen states actually passed laws outlawing them. I'm assuming 1.8 billion extra doses used boosters, since EU need many extra doses vaccinate entire population. press release says ""comirnaty"" EU buying, original vaccine. doubt would name original vaccine booster thing. say, ""The CDC would jobs better"".  But, depends ""their jobs"" are.  

Is ""the science"" thing CDC do?  rather doubt it. lots university departments ""the science"". research faculty, laboratories, grad students.  And, grant programs fund them. 

The name CDC gives away. Center Disease CONTROL. CDC supposed ""control"".  name Center Disease Research, Center Disease Science.  CDC supposed make publish policy, public communication policy. 

Part science might properly include psychology communication.  get people actually things need do?  scientific finding (e.g., wearing masks reduces transmission), might drive policy (e.g., people wear masks, places times transmission likely), good without communication. So, another science question is, ""How communicate policy, people actually comply ?"". indeed, dude way off.

There one shipment 250k doses, intended Australia produced EU warehoused Italy. AZ tried hide shipments' existence EU, Italian authorities found blocked shipment. two months ago. freaking rocket launcher. Covid weird, takes ramp certain areas. Africa largely spared comparison west really hope stays way. Mixing boosters fine. risk repeated injections Adeno Virus Vaccines due Vector immunity (though seems like least 3 doses ok). Unless EU also signs booster contract Moderna likely get BioNTech booster. Can’t blame they’re previous primary mandate mostly food safety inspections restaurants. Yes. pays lifeguards, upkeep, bathrooms, boardwalks, etc. 

NJ beaches much cleaner most, facilities well kept. Nice platitude. one read article? scheduled November factory problems dating back October. It’s clear cut “he scheduled it’s fine”. - sort of? Emergent powerhouse YEARS managing government programs CDMO manufacturing. Wish stores would put ""No mask required"" instead sign all. Seems still ambiguous.

It literally term spread disease, encompassing symptomatic asymptomatic infections likelihood infect another individual. 

Symptomatic infection matters individual, transmissibility matters population level. Colorado, even see county county basis shockingly clear correlation vaccination rate Covid case positive rate. 

  Unlikely. countries still need those, least 2022, boosters turn needed sent there. ianmsc

Ah, non-scientific twitter analysis. Got it. 

Or eyeball justify preconceived notions. Also great. 5% read source. read 68 unlinked cases. read earlier Taiwan given contact tracing asked infected person contact contacts. Taiwanese said surprise world 0 local cases 2 weeks (said 6 days ago published newspapers.) said making vaccines nothing would government give money too? Good boy Pfizer BioNTech committed continued development

Seems leave open type doses delivered end. anything CDC got right?

Testing close contact someone china. get first case Covid-19 US doctors lie say nursing home residents went china.

Mask needed.

Two dose vaccine, instead first dose first. Still want know many lives cost.

Mask requirements vaccinated people. donated doses would distributed COVAX. Earth accessed Unicef’s COVID-19 Vaccine Market Dashboard May 18. According it, 12.1 billion doses vaccines secured around world. these, 4.06 billion distributed COVAX. However, 68.8 million vaccines shipped far. Ah - data. Got it. Thanks time. I'd seriously love see something. studies referenced across multiple time points, multiple states, provided nothing. Yet keep projecting onto I'm interested learning. Sure sure bud. I'll still data support ideas. mean extent passport, guess Id fine short term - however always Im wary longhaul passport whatever use may stay estavlished yet? AFAIK companies still testing boosters variants nothing written stone yet.

They mention ""continued investments research development aimed adapting vaccine address new emerging variants"" earlier talk booster orders include adapting new variants needed, likely contract addresses that. stop there, keep increasing new sensational number. amazing politicized is. *Oh cool story tribe sharing vaccinations neighbors* turns US won’t share vaccines, Canada great vaccines, Canada sucks vaccines,Canada AK-shully better vaccines US, Ak-shully US much better vaccines Canada.

I don’t know want .... mean don’t want misinformation go unchallenged. It’s also cool get full picture ... every story. Every time. freakin’ exhausting. kids get lawn. sure having, let’s say 60-80% vaccination would prevent cases variant getting in... 1st doses per day. 2 million per day total doses, 1st 2nd stop people entering check see go maskless? way, forget vaccine proof prefer show it, mask up.

IDK, I'm fan vaccine passports general, understand we're weird transitional period right now. lot testing required travel media. I’ve taken tons covid tests since getting shots travel, events, production. rules haven’t updated yet. Part issue burden PPE. Masks, gloves, surgical gowns short. preserved use COVID care couldn’t spared preventative/routine care. non-elective surgeries still happened, staffing/surgical teams restricted part minimize exposures also conserve PPE. Less hands deck leads many downstream effects. 

There also shortages surgical instrumentation kits contain disposable equipment can’t autoclaved - part factories shut ill workers also shipping restrictions internationally. ORs US feeling shortages January/February 2020 COVID even hit here. 

There many logistical infrastructure aspects limited preventive/routine care whether hospital beds empty full. healthcare workforce ultimate limited resource strained overworked infected... part limiting routine care also maintain personnel. issue also led specialists “re-deployed” general medicine, emergency medicine critical care. Many don’t read EKGs intubate/manage ventilators practice, years removed seeing medical student... terrifying involved.  ask fair put dogs risk contracting covid 19. There's big difference ""less effective"" ""not effective enough"". vaccines work obese people would definitely know now. start spreading right now? dont think theres lots social distancing high density areas whole pandemic. also element pre existing immunity infection play considered here. Seychelles little cases prior vaccination.

The UK using AZ reduced deaths lot also prior immunity addition vaccine induced immunity. actual document mentions 78 times. talking thing? Nope, ""so many people already it"" really explain it.

Yeah, tell also prevents missionaries.

Win-win. Indoor mask mandates still place. Outdoor mask mandates fully lifted. Dogs amazing. early estimates somewhere 10% 50% contagious UK variant, probably towards lower end. 

The high numbers due demographics population group (they tend live close quarters multi generational homes vaccine hesitant) India delayed added red list (mandatory quarantine hotel) political reasons potential number people bringing India thousands. 

The majority people testing positive hospitalised fully vaccinated despite age groups meant offered vaccines long enough ago been. 

The scientists numbers working much biological much social take time data. Bingo Probably turn waste money, better safe sorry. It'd interesting know much RNA integrity suffers that. probably tolerable officially announced this, keeping least regular freezer instead fridge feasible guess. Definitely well, actually get logic - variant transmissible, inevitably end cases, therefore symptomatic cases

it issue everyone vaccinated asymptomatic, everyone vaccinated, even young people get ill. get many young people infected, least end hospital die. get enough infected, lot get ill die. I'm saying happen, UK modelling suggesting 1,000 deaths/day worst-case scenario summer, within realm possibilities, pessimistic end. idea reasonable accommodations want society, want people fact ""studied issue"" tell people studies shown almost zero risk spreading covid wear masks.

This completely unreasonable. need accommodation employer ask them. Call EEOC feel reasonably accommodated.  yes u get sick chances hospitalization low? Oh dear. Who’s going win race? 

Fear. Fear win race.  Regarding vaccine-passport debate (not travel, every-day activities); people saying people free get passport thus able enter establishments requiring therefore passport isnt mandatory bad faith argument 

Of course mandatory one bars every-day tasks activities. even commenting merits passport, argument mandatory, free get one (and therefore get bared enttering society) simply oxymoron Yes, thing younger teens received vaccine dosage adults reported side effects, mostly sore arms flu-like fever, chills aches signal revved-up immune system, particularly second Candice Robinson, medical director Chicago Department Public Health, noted last week sore arms similar common side effects associated vaccine common younger populations receiving vaccine, said concerns far Wear mask says 2nd Amendment. one say shit ur fully vaccinated fine, worry still waiting shot. Since I'm feeling bit lazy, least steer towards put Public Heath Ontario. note, use definitions did.

Their source peer-reviewed paper, sure able read without academic subscription. SC resident here! also first discover B.1.351 US too. health dept, DHEC, one advanced whole region, proactive sampling, etc variants states. variant certainly places too, maybe discovered. Right, can't require workers vaccinated? vaccinated, get gig. “Better expected”

What expectation? 

I know parents main fear (especially getting vaccine) kids getting covid. parents might cautious children lower risk Covid. seen vaccine hesitancy polls/graphs/maps US adults kids. 1 week tell it’s better expected? appear majority deaths counted India right - say nothing COVID specific deaths. US cases likely (positive negative) percent. think quite likely order magnitude India. 

I think people understand exactly large, dense India is, desperately poor parts are, exactly bad government failed last decade two. 

Remember India China spoken breath? Modern India China. cool! :) I'm kind surprised places thing. What's going change june? Basically everybody get vaccine want one today. Basically anywhere United States people realistically get vaccine appointment within 24 hours. that's case long time.

The hospital system overwhelmed. not.

I'm giving amount people vaccinated overall decrease spread including people who've already infection, extraordinarily unlikely hospital close overwhelmed again.

So guess question keep seeing type post every time something like happens people keep wanting wait longer longer. waited till June people saying wait till august.

At point allow things start returning normal data shows safe so.

That's CDC spent long saying vaccinated people.

But covid covid always going deal fact going people around public places may healthy going know overall health immunization status.

Here's problem. want convince undecided people get vaccine, good job keep telling matter they're going keep wearing masks.

I say I've talked lot fence people doubts vaccine keep seeing people advocating wearing masks understand people saying vaccine beneficial nothing ever going allowed change.

I'm pro vaccination. I'm also goal post continuing moved. They've moved enough Wait conversation get here? started describing transparency China vs US, *better*.

Unfortunately seems like “small government” applies “small government” agrees “slightly larger government”. “slightly larger government” sees “small government” going rogue, stomp down.

Trying talk way that’s civil won’t get deleted hard ....... access pfizer?? heard someone else India giving vaccines away countries. supply pfizer?? Thanks linking. exactly I’m talking about. seems differ interpretation use study argue point. However, presence high viral loads infected children increase concern children, even without symptoms, could readily spread infection others. Given prior track record, he'll probably hour late conference, it'll end announcement upcoming announcement, still - there's tiny chance he'll actually present carefully prepared plan. (As opposed last time, cronies decided shut children's playgrounds LOL)  I'm currently 14 basically friends already gotten shot. went school get vaccinated probably 200 people waiting line I've heard assertion lot, talked people reported family members got covid two shot vaccine (typically AZ). crazy thing India approved mRNA vaccines.

Disagree, Devil’s Advocate (assuming speaking mRNA vaccines): it’s fair say still learning differential efficacy, also fair learning differential (and long-term) safety new class vaccine? people wearing well fitted N95s. like many indoor areas full people wearing masks properly.   What? virus fake. 600k+ people dead USA cause virus... dumb? don’t love children. not.

People want wear one wearing one anyways. They're continuance wear one despite vaccinated mean misunderstand mask guidance. regard anyways. Connecticut mask mandate ended yesterday everyone still wore one even outside. I’m bartender popular restaurant yesterday three people come without mask. people talked didn’t even know mandate ended said planned continue wearing mask foreseeable future despite fully vaccinated. affluent, liberal area 80% people least one vaccine dose. think common attitude Northeast next months. 

That said chose wear mask behind bar one said anything one seemed uncomfortable. feel bit weird I’m staff member who’s post-two weeks second shot everyone else still mask up. Utah would time change law things change fall, unlike Iowa law effective today! US gonna same? guess y’all missed part said “certain” Americans Seems like line kinda fuzzy though.

What happened trust science experts around here?   thing really bothers whole debate people bring evidence concerns valid, say concerns policy implemented based them. Nothing fear based policy, akin USA establishing law said every building America built bomb shelter could get nuked.

Could people lie? Yes, course. Could still get COVID-19 vaccinated? Yes, course. Could mutation form current vaccines issues with? Yes, course. fears happening alone justification policy established based it. Make fact based policy decisions. carve disappear widely abused. Also reasonable accommodation could well include carry option restaurants mask requirement patron.  concern, one arguing shut travel country?

This *is* concern enough yet travel ban needed.

And restrictions India Indian variant.

Not sure trying use argue fewer US restrictions increasing chances mutation definitely even chance low. mean plenty people time warning looking much figure, lots people jumped anti AZ bandwagon disparaged it. remember trials took place unprecedented speed global pandemic, can't expect perfection Oxford AZ team managed get data win approval around world well vaccines 2 exceptions, Moderna Pfizer.

Exactly. antivaxer/antimasker crowd never stopped do. stores places relaxing rules means avoid can't risk exposing unvaccinated child it. everyone wear masks that's different. everyone vaccinated somewhere that's different. wild west right want vaccinated people relax go play unvaccinated honor system (of none). baby vaccinated. go hell last year half give expose now. sucks right thing feels like punishment burden.

""At University California San Francisco, Monica Gandhi colleagues found HIV patients seem produce fewer antibodies average, optimistic amount sufficient protect people.

“With antibody response blunted, T-cell response not, may mean susceptibility mild infection, likely severe disease,” That’s good reason get vaccinated. doesn’t really respond comment article though. shouldn’t afraid unvaccinated vaccinated. aren’t vaccinated aren’t exactly afraid anyway. actually afraid contracting disease vulnerable affected others choices. overwhelming majority people happy go back normal life point. stay self enforced lockdown without forcing rest community.

There evidence benefit given early though requiring oxygen, could potentially harmful.  might useful answers efficacy doesn’t matter: add-on, lack confidence causing slow approval vaccines. Pfizer approved far there. Im way expert read people experts arent business getting clicks/views this: vaccine targets spike protein. spike protein attaches cells infects you. covid become vaccine resistant, spike protein would need dramatically change - likely point could longer attached cells anyways thus issue.

I'm also 15, finish sophomore year. got day fully vaxxinated DAY summer starts us 💪 kid happy, friends hasn’t seen person since March 2020, vulnerable parents. still severe lockdown (Canada).

It’s devastating. also super eager school start again. Fingers crossed June. discrepancy?

No. deadly Spanish Flu intensive immune response triggered. stronger immune system likely die Spanish Flu. Covid it’s opposite main reason older people aren’t making quite many deaths countries prioritized vaccinations. infected 1000 old people 1000 young people Spanish Flu young would die more. Covid (assuming unvaxed) old would die more. I'm pointing doesn't. seems really upset folks lol  “It’s reasonable concerned variants” 

-Dr Paul Offitt, advisor FDA. Theoretically anything increases spread coronavirus result resistant variants emerging thriving, would speculate effect dwarfed factors like percentage population vaccinated, vaccination appears significantly reduce spread even vaccine-resistant variants. fucking hate terrible Canada this. think may become fairly common situation school extracurriculuars start requiring vaccine. That's good hear, thanks. Looking vaccination rate obviously seem working well. S-curve seem deviated lottery announcement, % vaccinated numbers look particularly better similar states. No. They're trials kids young 2 point - may get sooner expect. thing made mask-wearing effective prevalent sight everyone else wearing mask.  became (after year struggle) social norm.

If many/most people *not* wearing mask, social pressure gone. People going think ""oh, look, people must vaccinated!"", they're going think ""oh, look, people wearing mask one enforcing mask wearing, damned I'm going wear one!""

This rocket science. Another great (Reuters) – district northern Thailand launched raffle campaign vaccinated residents win live cow per week rest year, bid boost local COVID-19 vaccination next month, one lucky vaccinated villager Mae Chaem district Chiang Mai province randomly chosen every week win young cow worth around 10,000 baht ($318.78). course not. misinformation intention think purpose emphasizing effectiveness vulnerable populations leads less guilt getting vaccine. 

You also post factual statements instead opinions masquerading facts future, especially important topics like this. Depends far Canada progresses vaccines next month, I'd guess. number I've seen floating around 70% Canadians need vaccinated they'll comfortable reopening tourism - I'm sure mean fully vaccinated first dose. 

Only way could see compromising countries agree sort opt-in vaccination verification system, would take serious effort establish get working - imagine would bit wait due verification process itself.

Fingers crossed though. I'd really like see bf summer :/. Many people categories get vaccine prioritized many places. mother's cancer patient got Pfizer. may *effective*, still tried. asked: reason they’re worried mutations Covid?


The answer vaccines “do preclude possibility newer variants resistant vaccines emerge -- highlighting importance widespread vaccination global level.”. agreeing trying add onto comment. said cdc said it’s safe wear masks you’re vaccinated. call end mask wearing. keep ignoring that? There’s difference what’s safe end needing do. end needing depends local authorities businesses.

Why don’t care cdc said unvaccinated need wear masks? That’s big problem we’re faced now. Athletes easily separated 80,000 people small number consider number events. Covid spread outside that's many events (Track/Field, Tennis, Soccer, etc.) take place. without masks schools? Implying AZ vaccine somehow socialist? AZ private company Government funding obtained taxing individuals businesses capitalist economy. 

Capitalism defined gouging hell everything whenever can, even that's often turns out. I'm saying variants something keep tabs all, that's something booster shots align with.

I agree ""Vaccinated Person Caught Coronavirus"" headlines pointless, unless going print overwhelming amount people didn't. long someone gets point across fuck cares grammar perfect. Aww thanks, showed thread, he's non-plussed, I'm shock Thats correct. effective? articles ever say? Republicans private property rights?

Are pissing street public too? Maybe misread, seems like prohibiting future. 

A mask hurt anyone, currently 12+ vaccinated, kids schools likely ones get it, spread it. Sure, maybe less danger them, spread gotten chance get vaccine can't take (cancer treatment patients). 

Hell, could even say ""masks closed spaces all, masks outdoors lunch.""


There harm done currently, bill preventing future mandates (when could needed) that's bad planning. Frankly, give two shits anyone else thinks reluctance relinquish medical privacy tough agree basically every industry seen major setbacks delays.

But even setbacks resolved, can't people honest? Stop saying worried everyone getting sick admit want commute again. difference reporting zero deaths reporting deaths.

That difference big deal sometimes. even follow basketball lol, one best offenses time 2 superstars. literally must watch team Ya I'm waiting go Philippines. seen fiancée since parted ways Romania. See comment made days ago. experience second dose pretty crummy, I’d still get booster heartbeat meant protection. Wow, godamn, depressing amount mental gymnastics contradicting yourself. safe stop mask mandates 11% vaccinated isnt enough.

Obviously rolling back significant part country vaccinated given ample people build study confirm suspect meaningful. 

The bottom line vaccinated, protected virus. ignored every point made continue insist discussing US. Kinda weird.

I'm discussing general facts vaccine.

I'm disputing statement wearing masks unvaccinated right.

No shit live area almost 90% unvaccinated, going recommend keep wearing masks.

But mean 11% people vaccinated unprotected virus. simply smart thing make sure people continue get vaccinated reach larger, inconsequential percentage vaccinated adults. think so. thing I've found, news article published isciii Pretty much every vaccine basically protects entirely this. Even lower efficacy, still getting extreme protection serious cases. Basically third dose necessary 6-9 months second dose? reading correctly? Thank you, awesome kid lucky Btw I'm going take down. sub insane. Attacking quote CEO BioNTech. Sweet. confirm! Adenovirus 26. There's 3 adenovirus vectors:
ChAdOx (AstraZeneca)
Ad26 (J&amp;J Sputnik V)
Ad5 (CanSinBIO Sputnik V) literally Reuters article lays said. using google translate count Reuters.

We got correctly translated description, google translate telling incorrect. SA variant mostly contained SA? Even pulling plug, we'd seeing SA variant infections people AZ doses countries effective, right? love Iowa City. great college town top-tier hospital. never regretted visit.

I also flew 2008 flood flight San Francisco Chicago, remember people audibly gasping. hope better flood prevention measures implemented. Tell vaccinator nervous around needles sometimes feel like going faint. know do, stuff like lie getting vaccine giving snack appears preventing *infection*. could still prevent 75% symptomatic disease. opinion CEO Pfizer. Maybe he’s right, maybe wants sell vaccines? idea opinion Elvis Mars. Ugh, can't stand people use ""up to."" sneaky marketing words.

The article contents say expected (another tricky word) 70% 75%. I'm really confused posts pointing Reuters article said getting auto-modded saying ""you contribute high-quality information"", mistranslation still left up. Freedom! Freedom tell do! translation match posted? various folks attacking including full quote, includes 25-30 percent number CEO literally said. 

I rudimentary understanding Turkish, translation seem excessively off. Yes arm small. ask…?  good day Monday. slightly yesterday. Getting super hot people moving inside AC. lot friends got vaccinated sadly. hope improve numbers more. won’t stop, people seem made pandemic whole identity without noticing . I’m sure aware enough. 

Oh well looked way care needles much. saw sign pcc said need “masked vaxed” - thought good way putting Thank much  Bingo. Think much energy, money, &amp; time saved people cars highways &amp; byways hours day year-round. mention environmental impacts people becoming conscious climate change discussions lately. wonder much percentage person's salary typically spent commuting via bus passes extra fuel/car maintenance. saving alone quite freeing people. time saved better spent family, quality time kids &amp; school otherwise. Even jobs 100% remote (probably most, really), parts done remotely stay way still impact. I'm one lucky who's job fully remote continuously since mid-March 2020 got rocky start probably case everywhere, new system place built make online appointments &amp; using Zoom &amp; another videoconferencing platform sessions. get clients never would've able visit us in-person pre-COVID due distance. office work stay fully remote, maybe still case made week visits rented office that's used one day hours rather company renting year buying huge building millions. 50/50 perhaps. overtake US first dose today/tomorrow, 4 percent second. 

If second dose ramp starts mid June would bet another extension three kids. Two old enough shot. Brought third one along us day approved ages state. 9 year old happy wasn’t getting one too.

Our health department drive thru shots. Back got first dose, two stations waited half hour get shot station. took kids, drove right in, one station open line. Anecdotal, maybe whole bunch adults already vaccinated. reflection you. Google translated myself. Came say exactly that! hope studies/releases chorus ""but variants"" voices start getting quieter. 

In every thread new CDC guidelines inevitably bunch people appalled openings think phantom variant hiding around corner waiting knock us head beer bottle. yet indoor sumo arena half full today.  Outdoor spread nothing point Olympics requires tremendous numbers people arrange, support, put safely. logistics mind-numbing, require staff public servants facilitate. Olympics happen vacuum. I'm even worried athletes since reports vaccinated area 80%. faceless people behind scenes never get shown TV work make happen.

I seriously doubt anything scale done pandemic.

This trivial undertaking. here! much fun audience void! states article it’s protection asymptomatic infection could easily solved blockchain. Give every vaccinated person token proof use QR scanner scan QR code. Done done. contradicting yourself. safe stop mask mandates 11% vaccinated isnt enough.

Also ignored every point made continue insist discussing US. Kinda weird.  point article says ""25-30% fewer antibodies binding virus would case original coronavirus""

I think that's source misunderstanding. reduction 25-30% efficacy, means expected efficacy 70-75%. think person posted article misread mistranslated believed efficacy 25-30%.  Almost vaccines work!!! 

All kidding aside, fantastic news!  1100 fewer cases today Florida vs. last Thursday. Amazing news! kids swim school?  book appointment? ask recommended gap increased 12-16 weeks. Cowin, 42 days counter updated 84 days counter. matter month 2. exception see international travel. Numbers plummeting one going worry vaccine cards. Now, come October kind bump surge maybe large events might ask vaccine cards even thin go away. see point. like point. going gain much traction sub. love born. fully immunized person, find paying lot attention well vaccination prevents hospitalization, long covid, transmission. wish common issues discussed publications/articles. tell nurse don’t like seeing needles.

Once distinction needs made forcing anybody wear mask, still wear mask. Others forced so. makes sound lot better. reduction 25-30% miles better reduction 25-30%. translation indeed misleading then. one person’s relative subjective feelings safety preclude others engaging lives?

The option stay home one felt unsafe existed long COVID. Loosen means wearing masks indoors crowded situations? It’s like I’m calling shutdowns anything. Well can’t loosen anyways masks still required everyone mass transit, hospitals, schools, prisons. step daughter turns 12 two weeks bio daughter turns 12 August. Cannot wait get vaccinated.

Aside baby belly, everyone fully vaccinated house August. Baby get antibodies hoping best :) Iowan, agree. least there’s Iowa City Take. A. Picture. Keep phone. Visit local office depot/office max, copied laminated card free  need vaccinated then. WebMD: effectiveness flu vaccine average, it’s 40% effective, meaning it’s prevented illness 40% time. Since health officials 2003, effectiveness varied year year, ranging low 10% 2004-05 high 60% 2010-11.

For perspective Let's go goats!  Awesome. mom teaches elementary middle school said students excited anxious get it. Kids believe science! severe disease hospitalization appeared study. feel way Oregon. updated guidance vaccinated people maskless (must provide proof vaccination + everyone vaccinated order anyone maskless) essentially renewal mask mandate name only.

Good see countries helping, really wished dumb government reminded people time time Covid appropriate behaviour, gone silent Diwali 2020 festival around November till April 2021 lead people thinking everything normal(look government warning us &amp; opened everything up, Covid) kept minimum lockdown approving importing vaccines done earliest know country fucking 1.4 billion people. Add underreporting cases. Families getting destroyed, families losing sole breadwinner, toddlers losing parents. losing spouses. ever end? need wait end year something person kid? Cases everywhere, declining daily. Also, risk children particular age group comparable flu think important wear mask maintain social distancing community spread greatly reduced (if eliminated), demonstrate given vaccines protect variants circulation. 62.6% 18+ NY least one shot, could see number reaching 70% end june. makes complete sense since can’t immediately test new potential drug humans. looking help talking loved one Saturday. believe seriousness COVID-19 much less vaccines.

They have, however, acknowledged, sources best open serious discussion see go vaccine not. tendency distrust sources general, conspiracies, reasonable people, conservatives, pro-choice, pro inclusions, equality, etc.

They simply unfortunately worked government hospital environment incredible many admins, docs, rns getting vaccinated beta/trial drug, enough data, they're healthy, fit, etc.

I know lot might want say, ""it's worth it, listen"" please send messages. personally feel worth it, really believe consider want genuinely try.

If anyone could help compiling nice list reputable sources, arguments, points, cases, studies, etc. would really appreciated. currently going what's subreddit. advice direction would wholeheartedly appreciated. There's reason call Covid Kim round parts. I'm pretty sure fought hard mask mandates partly it'd hard suck Trump's dick wearing one. hard better now. kid back K everything friends.

The two states lockstep entire pandemic, plus minus couple weeks occasionally. asking data equate worrying? There's nothing wrong wanting stay educated speed new information. Right on!! I'm glad FSU well this. really hope daughter's friends start getting vaccinated soon. think see vaccinated people getting sick. Ya idk people don’t get 

In country, Canada, stopped using major supply issues. idea rest contracted doses arrive. Plus addition clotting disorders made bad vaccine continue using. doesn’t matter it’s highly effective (it is!), it’s gonna effective doses administer. Adults Let guess, covid point. heard King County, WA retaining mask mandate everyone regardless vaccination status well, unlike NJ two thirds adults vaccinated. bode well NJ... Finally!
I one worried downvoted sayinng know variants vaccines.

I breathe easy now. kind study hoping doing.   link one actually read?  That’s total population. DOH site doesn’t number anywhere find [this article says % adults least one shot 68%. light keeps getting brighter brighter :) Why? things likely harm child, Covid probably number 853 list. base statement observing past years. Democrats actually like policy Republicans completely abandoned engage culture wars, anything get power us NYers already vaccinated? Okay, never said otherwise. think really relevant either way. 

Using personal information harass people illegal. putting information not. guess last year lot ppl adopt dogs pandemic Yeah wisdom teeth rough. give topical anesthetic injection. could still feel one mine keep going back novocaine. Right idea long term affects human body. everything prevent infection. Also virus works asymptomatic spread happen without either parties knowledge. unless children tested weekly really rely numbers ones got bad enough died. Wearing mask pointless everyone vaccinated. point take chance. seems like mask thing parents freaking rather children. Sure probably find child problem mask far away better policy avoid together rather take chance congenital problems road. Everywhere forever? whole family too, virus house hard contain? 

We expect immunocompromised people take extra precautions. should, however, also expect everyone else follow basic hygiene protocols decency (like, staying home they're sick). 

And willing cases required make accommodations, especially right now. one even willing conversation put entire burden right back vulnerable person. malnourished timely medical care try treat self cow dung totally believable.
Kids get sick- Mum Granny look kids.
Mum Granny get sick- Dad Grandad get sick.
Everyone gets stressed - people get better die Covid. Secondary infection sets bacterial pneumonia viruses bacterial fungal infections due lowered immunity Covid.
No medical care = death say better start planning revolution assuming failure. build right infrastructure, use structures like DSA mutual aid networks, radicalize labor boards councils, unionize workplaces, prepare.

Massachusetts 70+% eligible people vaccines Call skeptical don’t think reach mark anytime soon 70% population 70% adults? That's OH, though (announced NY believe, today impact numbers yet). There's way Ohio alone could bump much. Wow that’s lot drawings! hope Virginia something similarly Doxxing effect person targeting. family members choice (such children) effected.

Anyway paper found at: [http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.12464.58880](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.12464.58880)

.  Hey look vaccines work. need put much less stock upvotes/downvotes. don’t matter. ohh see long needle isnt long getting wisdom tooth pulled fine guess! maybe I’m misunderstanding something, explanation (small numbers still zero) getting vaccinated 0-11 age currently? counting kids currently trials? doubt they'll stick around NY reaches 70% vaccinated. Unfortunately exact mentality got us here. likely vote Dem out, blind vote. People need vote based best candidate them, one R next name. silly, maybe wearing vaccine cards lanyard would help lol. I'm honestly considering volunteering one feels uncomfortable around me. what... even talking another one falls reality. Yes. Also, tech companies paid good money massive campuses, new buildings, amenities, etc. way they’ll downsize. Maybe WFH common, want bodies offices money wasted. Sure hope so... Corporate tax complicated, there's lots room legitimate debate best tax policies multinationals.

But people complain multinational corps paying little nothing US taxes -- well, stuff like one big ways accomplish worst part cognitive dissonance get fact literally 2 states implemented plan lifting mask mandate anybody. 

So see New York Michigan longer requiring masks vaccinated people think ""oh big deal, pretty much everyone it, CDC all"", hear explanation like Murphy's actions think ""oh hey, sound reasonable, guess really can't tell who's vaccinated not, better safe sorry suppose.""

I guess maybe states *should* taken time lifting masks, maybe setting dates *future* come (e.g. California doing), moot now. imagine chaos would ensue states go ""whup, looks like read CDC guidelines closely, back everyone wearing masks again!"" Would make good image *either* politically public health-wise. states already could do, NJ HI probably end buckling pressure neighboring states instead forcing neighboring states buckle themselves. That's actually true though. reason experts talk herd immunity vaccines 100% effective. That's people get effective are. Pfizer Moderna vaccines need 65% people vaccinated reach optimal, still perfect effectiveness. Considering vaccines kids yet, ways go. Wearing mask grocery stores hard. Unless medical reason, think that's tough thing do, kind significant sacrifice probably lead privileged ass life.  disagree. Ebola transmitted fast-moving fearless maniacs: actually come contact another person's body fluids get it. rocket science, really. yet keeps popping Africa, killing thousands people - that's entire world chips help them.

Soooo, slow-motion virus stopped hazmat suit (and touching dead/dying relative) kicking asses, fast-moving virus carried fast, angry, fearless person (where single blood drop infect you) definitely take world. guess circle back 6 months see Biden administration done punish company. still remember people sanitizing mail groceries food delivery boxes. It'll take little time soon enough people view wearing masks fully vaccinated way view stuff today. (more western nation)

Is based survey? We're changing way life 4% population immunocompromised. susceptible diseases coronavirus. 

Are really going continue advocate restrictions find narrowest subgroup people would still vulnerable? newborns! management warn drivers shitting bags. Events London, Liverpool Sefton, correct? accurate data infection numbers 5-14 days relevant events?

These ones don’t look promising. there's 2 more, 6 total: second, less known one sinopharm another one approved days ago. far know vaccinations first Sinopharm Sinovac. terrible analogies. disturbing parents want kids stay masked. 

Kids currently can't get vaccinated. [While children less affected COVID-19 compared adults, children infected virus causes COVID-19 children develop severe It’s ~10% every reliable study I’ve seen. (Including CDC’s study).

The part really irks announced they’re dropping mask recommendation within day saying couldn’t ascertain number breakthrough cases they’d count end hospitalized dead, suggesting actually certain absolute risks breakthrough cases, revocation mandate based around population polling data suggesting dropping mask mandates would encourage vaccination. things though lol. understand saying though. Trump far concerned image among cult anything else. I’m person replied to, two weeks toddler’s second dose sounds good me. 40% also second dose, moving along fine. give us cite _your_ claims?  Right, meant fungus us default. Walking Dead universe, everyone carries undead virus default. die (gunshot, bad case flu, heart attack, etc) come back zombie.

So, point could happen us immune system powers down, that's real nightmare fuel. really time judge? Seems like would better everyone smile nod. documentation first **known** infected person. nowhere say 100% certainty nobody else exposed prior that. Thanks ammo backing everything I’ve already said. people confirmed COVID-19, antigen tests correctly identified COVID-19 infection average 72% people symptoms, compared 58% people without symptoms.

Those tests far wishful thinking. 42% dangerous (i.e. asymptomatic) spreaders pass undetected. See told you.

Might bad though. Looks like calling people nefarious motives frowned upon here. wonder misinformation gets passed around like blunt bonfire. Sort - feel like they're looking risks rationally. risk kid even getting covid adults around vaccinated small. Even get covid, risk sick long term small. far less risk stunting kid's development.  point guidance CDC mask indoors ok vaccinated people, unenforceable people lie it... except lying work going get shot. realize asking parents take kids store.

Are confused fact unvaccinated kids allowed fact follow guidance must wearing mask? Masks work directions. Sometimes stumble solution. Yeah, shocked saw study showing flu drastically increases chance heart attack stroke decades later. pretend know long term effects COVID kids

You do? hopeful long term effects right win argument? like life death thing matters

Maybe I've make actual sacrifices country, think wearing mask public places reach herd immunity big sacrifice. source mythical N95 fits three year old? Separating immigrant/refugee children families indefinitely losing track 100% exclusive Trump admin policy. Ask architect plan, Stephen Miller.

Nobody rightfully blame Trump admin fact there's violence holy land. happen watch failed brokering peace Kushner move Israeli embassy Jerusalem merely added fuel fire. blame also credit improving situation. similar Trump success/lack thereof North Korea. Fortunately clicked posting history. Bye.  hopefully   focus children needing vaccines ridiculous. 287 children died Covid 19, that's ages 0-17.

And drill child deaths find mostly kids stage 4 cancer, immunocompromised, morbidly obese. That's minimize tragedy, healthy kids generally dropping dead Covid way healthy people 60s are. really need lift mask mandate time go Shore July. Also offers breweries wineries May? 95% trials mRNA vaccines. Lower J&amp;J.

95% efficacy means 20 unvaccinated people would gotten virus, 1 vaccinated. variants, 4 1. J&amp;J, 3 1. 3 unvaccinated would gotten it, instead 1 vaccinated does. 
 
Obviously, protection counteracted vaccinated people start things raise chances compared unvaccinated (going crowded bars, etc). vaccines lower changes 1/20th, 1/4th, 1/3rd, stuff that's way likely expose virus, risk even go up. specified ""early April"" timeframe, that's timeframe data from. There's nothing ""dishonest"" highlighting declining numbers within timeframe. is.

What's dishonest spreading misinformation without data support it. Sure pass contact info. call one afternoon. Neither issues began Trump either, sure seems get blamed lot. dont think point  joke Kimchi contain high amount vitamin K helps make four 13 proteins needed blood clotting. NYT posted article NYC re-open, wrote this:

“But vaccines offer 100 percent protection, half people region fully vaccinated. result, epidemiologists continue recommend following golden rules coronavirus safety. - Despite new guidelines, many experts still suggest wearing mask indoors eating drinking.”

“I wouldn’t go back gyms, anytime soon,” advised Dr. Brian Strom, chancellor Rutgers Biomedical Health Sciences New Jersey, said would consider gym mandated vaccines. “I think gyms high risk.”

I’m cautious, could please compare risk vaccinated person wearing mask getting symptomatic Covid risk getting car crash? people understand “high risk” means experts? extremely low chance getting mild case Covid worth going gym exercising? worth living fear? comment section filled fearful readers, mental effects go away easily. Boy, sure like format lot - really can’t read, ya ? 

FIRST 

FUCKING 

LINE,

bro.   **TRY AGAIN** 2020-2021 flu season, CDC reported one pediatric death nationwide, Michigan Department Health Human Services reported 0 pediatric influenza deaths. sure getting 5 pediatric flu deaths statistic. drops dead 💀 sitting next Would honestly prefer lie get engage security theater? Cause that’s is. Vaccines better mitigation tool masks. vaccines (particularly mRNA ones) highly effective preventing infection transmission. safe vaccinated people stop wearing mask. lie? need make vaccine passports hard fake. waited people vaccinated June July scrapped mask mandate entirely once. 

That's fair point, think CDC guidance scrapping entire mask mandate coming sooner people think. Probably mid June. Heads explode happens think CDC trying incrementally prepare people.  Data statistics make decisions. people make decisions messaging guidance understand implications messages stay blaming keep making things worse. Well got vaccination, remember assuming responsibility ""making sure asshole anti-vaxxers wear masks"", exactly see that's problem. verify aren’t vaccinated?  I'm gonna love seeing badly triad ages country basically 100% wide-open restrictions masks seen July Even early pandemic, obvious government economic policies — much less guided partisan ideologies — would much less post-pandemic recovery public’s confidence health protected. lesson 9/11 — civilian domestic flights grounded 48 hours attacks, air travel didn’t fully recover nearly three years.


TL DR - gov funded recovery, gov could lockdown could provide safety net, couldn't

 people made choices stay home patronize businesses felt relatively safe. like rollercoasters say ride weak neck heart condition. one lie go die fault estate can't sue. case, that’s bad. I’m putting lanyard taping forehead lol delete want see get homelessness that. in. prove nobody covid nobody get covid Oof point get people vaccinated get wear mask. That's 2020. dont to. liability isnt anymore though - go work/recreation without vaccinated could turn catch covid die, itll fault.

theyre ending restrictions means dangerous people unvaccinated, theyre going continue walk eggshells. Can't focus summer now? Yeah. I'll get booster advised, problem that, that's it. Variants bad murder hornets..... Tell wear masks. don't, add penalties wearing masks. Done, easy. Montréal post pandemic fun place anymore, unfortunately. became police state tries enforce policies scientific basis. enacted highly brutal curfew supposed “shock therapy” 28 days. actuality, curfew extended nearly 5 months. 

People like Montréal, think, activities summer (and winter). Right now, activity go park hope cops don’t storm picnic. 

Canada going really slow moving suspect. 2 cases per day, 100% 1 case per day. Therefore stop lockdowns 1 case per day. get pandemic serious. amount people died fucking bullshit. better chance dying cancer covid left help. say don’t allow tourism?

Yes. literally said want wait German people vaccinated returned normal allowing non-Germans tourism. That's called ""not allowing tourism."" diagnosed thyroid tumor. 5 months waiting, countless weeks scheduled procedures days, wait get results weeks labs backed up..... gotten see specialist. oncologist still labs thinks malignant so, odds good. back logs due Covid. took almost 6months instead 6 weeks get get answers/treatment. couple friends still sanitizing 😐 told help much, like ""you never know"" little disease studied past 16 months. it’s comment directed one replied too, didn’t find uncivil. That's MeDiCAl CaRd ~~amazon~~ ADA says. think might something broken brains honest. work allowed masks vaccinated individuals starting today. walked without mask bit anxiety. Felt better saw people without masks later day noticed started silently judging people didn’t masks (as literally right without mine). Like said, brains broken. Why? protect better? mix them? Part return ""normalcy"" includes things may ideal. lot people, work situation actually improved, either working remotely deal random people person anymore. two layers normalcy, think people board changes making work hell again. daily. 500 day terms raw numbers may seem lot, lot consider PA 22k cases day peak pandemic.

It's pretty minimal. propose ensure unvaccinated wear masks? different 600 37%.

Thats pretty big difference. get physical paper card, widespread restrictions based vaccination status, someone sells fake ones. Well, yeah. don’t think they’re looking objectively, also get *why* it’s hard objective kids. fear isn’t rational, still sympathize. BiswasIndia correspondent Spanish flu came right WWI. generation ""recovered"" pretty bad stuff. U.S actually saw surge came April similar happened across world. zthe difference surge severely stunted Covid vaccines. article month old, completely outdated period everything rapidly shifting increasing vaccination decay daily case counts  OP spamming outdated articles suggest doomsday scenarios? daily numbers? whole month. latter, hahaha ha yeah no.

And former, difference actually pretty big. asia getting hit harder mini third wave, interesting see asian countries handle given previous measures able halt spread, got right lol. lunacy think vaccinated would make sacrifices protect group refused to. seriously unfortunate people can't get vax will. Probably least partially can't see vaccination status. Exactly. Everyone get vaccinated, unvaccinated wear masks anyone gotten vaccinated wear masks. seems though we’ve entered nonsensical ridiculous stage accompanies near end pandemic. hard government control that’s dominating people world continue oppressive, perhaps far longer needs be. reality, vaccine rollout high enough, governments need ease restrictions dramatically quickly. border control becoming nonsensical. anything, Americans hesitant Canadians—the majority *fully* vaccinated—from coming in. Canada benefits tremendously American tourism. ridiculous. US sees flu deaths 60,000 seasons particularly nasty strains. correct decision, even work here. 

They made deal vaccine companies, could afford start building factories ramping production ASAP, knew vaccine would approved not. had't done we'd still waiting vaccines, money wasted nothing compared cost letting lockdowns etc. keep going months longer. far Australia one countries handle pandemic well bite ass later like India.

Your government still needs get guys vaccinated ASAP seen quickly get hand. Countries actually contact tracing found zero incidences transmission asymptomatic vaccinated people. That’s say it’s *definitely impossible,* nobody managed find case happening. authorized potty breaks. That's close US plateaued. Would hope China hangs longer given cultural political differences US.  Well, then, CDC failed stop that. Probably depends climate client interaction. know half workplace vaxxed, next time someone brings covid, half team quarantine. rest suck up.

Or dealing public. Never know cats gonna drag in. walking street one mobile vaccination vans RIGHT THERE. waiting.

Still, takers. high platelets! variant California since least 4/3 - Oh say that

Article nearly month old, ancient rapidly entire status quo changed last weeks another surge isn’t going happen. didn’t happen florida spring break didn’t happen texas big baseball game, didn’t happen easter, didn’t happen cinco de mayo, going happen memorial day. counties seriously lagging behind. San Joaquin county Stanislaus county 42%. watch helpful video CDC Hoffman's also quite reputation best Syracuse area, sure Wegmans would carry far south though. Upstate way conservative though 50% going lie, I've fully Pfizer vaccinated, I'm strongly considering going different place getting shot J&amp;J another weeks. We've several full capacity events US cause bumps positivity rates anywhere near people afraid think pretty safe fully open concerts festivals stateside point mask mandate state qualms using mask everywhere went public. state recently removed mask mandate (NY) vaccinated people. vaccinated go public places without mask. I’ve getting glared scoffed wearing masks.

The science stated mask mandatory last year mask vaccinations moment equal footing me. people rejecting one ? Get country vaccination path. arguing something say.

Efficacy comparing vaccinated unvaccinated. measurement vaccinated person (or unvaccinated person) getting virus overall.

I compared vaccinated unvaccinated. example, reduces chances 1/20th compared unvaccinated person....  20 unvaccinated people would get symptomatic COVID, 1 vaccinated person would.

Notice explicitly comparing vaccinated unvaccinated, rather saying overall chances vaccinated person catching virus. accusing saying something never said, arguing made-up statement. Article almost month old Masks act desperation. tools mitigate spread public, unless course continue hard lockdowns. Vaccination goal reason. comments people believe masks better, that's silly, course. comments pointing premature lifting mandates. Due states rolled vaccines availability general public many people yet fully vaccinated. first dose, awaiting second. Others quite 2 week post shot effectiveness. removing mandate vaccinated people essentially lifting people. **that** crowd going keep wearing masks to. amount susceptibility could saved short extension. 

Some would say **those people** already wearing masks. honestly, change gym going population gym last week week quite drastic. highly doubt influx new gym goers vaccinated. were, probably already would attending. Especially since (largely) cardio machines. awkward lift mask, really bad. agree running one annoying. Last week 100% masks. Monday: Double lasybweeks attendance 50% wearing masks. Wednesday: even higher attendance, even fewer wearing masks. 

A small anecdote, sure, could applied wider situations. Follow science.

That used motto around here. lots folks want throw science right window. even worse consider masks 15% efficacy rate. course without vaccines every little bit helps, mind boggling much people overrate effective are. Like people forget brutal Winter Surge many countries faced mask mandates? didn’t CDC message emphatically vaccinated people

Show following recommendations think CDC clear  You’ve Fully Vaccinated**  fully vaccinated**, resume activities prior pandemic.  vaccinated people** resume activities without wearing mask physically distancing, except required federal, state, local, tribal, territorial laws, rules, regulations, including local business workplace guidance.  vaccines effective protecting getting sick. Based know COVID-19 vaccines, **people fully vaccinated** start things stopped pandemic.  recommendations help make decisions daily activities **after fully vaccinated**. intended healthcare settings.  Fully Vaccinated?**  general, people considered **fully vaccinated**: ±  weeks second dose 2-dose series, Pfizer Moderna vaccines,  weeks single-dose vaccine, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen vaccine  don’t meet requirements, regardless age, fully vaccinated. Keep taking precautions fully vaccinated**. thanks fact-checking research regarding vaccine news S. Korea. way much misinformation exaggeration there. went Disneyland. weird. Mask compliance nearly 100% nose, social distancing everywhere, lines fast, nearly food required mobile order hour ahead time. sure go back things return normalcy.

Positive note: got go Rise Resistance first time. Party Pants Chuck E. Cheese Boys Anyone remember old CDC director (Redfield?) saying masks effective vaccine ever could be? wonder message got taken heart folks. Yes, don’t get either. scream ‘vaccines aren’t 100% effective’ yet never say thing masks. Like what’s rule? Since say vaccines aren’t 100% effective thus must wear masks, mean rule ‘if X 100% effective more’. Can’t apply masks? Masks aren’t 100% effective get COVID test anytime go out. Oh COVID tests aren’t 100% accurate double mask. Oh wait double masking isn’t 100% effective gotta more. Like end? seems arbitrary. wondering border closure factors Albertans attend clinic given exemptions quarantine 14 days. line cars, drive loop takes across border, receive shots window, monitored 15 minutes return home. Crazy respectful people photo. It’s possibility sure. One try avoid vaccinating many people possible letting unvaccinated go unmasked everywhere now. “100% certainty” — phrase didn’t use

The point made: Florida didn’t suffer high casualties later Seattle, New York, Massachusetts.

Another point made: people dying every day Florida almost state size.

You:

“OMG clAim aBSoluTE knowLedgE eVerY vIrUs eVar?? cAn’T pRuVe dIdn’T sTaRt FlORiDa!!!!” people? remember reading tweet (That sadly removed twitter ""controversial"") European doctor concluded proper mask usage 15% efficacy rate, could never substitute social distancing pre-vaccine Covid mitigation. makes mask wearing far less effective J&amp;J vaccine, also making symptoms far less deadly infected covid. 

If want data this, damn near every country World mask mandates still suffered brutal winter wave. better yet, bring Japan currently, country many people disciplined wearing masks, horrible vaccination rates. country able bring curve this. prolly lawyers enough money get conquences Cross species dna conversion utilizing RNA breeding - saw YouTube someone board certified comment said that. Point please?

You said dont want unvaccinated friends children impacted weeks simple protocol.

If remain masked socially distanced impacted change policy either they're things they're impacted. Pick one. get logically inconsistent call people trolls. think people underestimated amount vaccine misinformation people aren’t opposed them, I’ve seen many people Twitter argue shots keep hospital basically nothing prevent getting Covid. true all, they’re extremely effective preventing covid.  started talking year ago, sub told cruelly cancer contagious

I'll favor never participating discussions again. last comment sub pandemic ends sub dies. got first dose Pfizer today! expecting similar flu shot, didn’t even feel needle go in. complaining though lol. arm itches really bad hopefully go away (they said wasn’t allergic reaction thankfully). absolutely misjudged eager people drop restrictions vaccinated. mind getting blown daily. change fact unacceptable knowing inevitable excuse. medical system whatever hell called screwed badly. Nah I’m good People forgot Puerto Rico power contract already ? going uncovering Trumps trash next 10 years. That’s efficacy works. There’s already non-100% chance you’ll get Covid near someone affected already. take low risk 95% chance top that. there's lot place too. Hong Kong. responded well wearing masks refuse vaccinate due anti government sentiment. got ridiculed getting vaccine too. Kinda feels like that's determined. Literally point going back there's couple weeks left. state. 30 percent. rounded up. assume meant reply u/powerupyo10 keeping masks vaccinated people reason, reason remains.


There good could lifted masks vaccinated people January first people fully vaccinated.

That's exactly done. Vaccinated people forced wear masks public health disaster. indicated public government trust vaccines effective 16 comments four visible one deleted…. Yeah, it’s easy wear mask shopping, movies wouldn’t wear one outside factored CDC guidance masks initially ? That’s what’s completely strange Today’s raw reported metrics:

- Tests: 931,682 (-225,799)

- Cases: 27,494 (-7,011)

- Deaths: 585 (-137)

- Hospitalized: 26,262 (-642)

- ICU: 5,679 (-212)

(Tests/Cases/Deaths: +/- = change raw count day last week)
(Hosp/ICU: +/- = chg yesterday’s truly incredible much everything continues fall. Unfortunately, votes, people think, ""no way pass"" neutrals sense, show up. Wolf=H1tl3r yard signs, show even really know they're voting for. Proven living NC similar anti gay rights vote. 

Can't let illegals vote!! Yeah, know that's ballot, but.... That's people think.  According family another part low AZ supply due vaccine hesitancy. Prior surge AZ stock expire end month one wanting it, understandably government big rush order feel children suffer significantly worse mental health issues adults problem unvaccinated people seem ones wearing masks. societies best understand. 

I'm sure 50 100 years, descendants look Covid responses archaic misdirected. Yeah strongly doubt world balls anything. Sad. r chinese people using toilet paper ?? Wherever are, presumably decent number people unvaccinated unmasked. rational assign modest probability unmasked person see unvaccinated. Since would prefer anyone I'm interacting suspect me, even low probability, prefer wear mask fully allay (entirely rational) mild suspicion. I'm making comparison.

I'm 100% commenting information posted above.

If look precovid number 2880 June, higher lower current?

Higher. That's positive acceleration based information provided based whatever imagine I'm saying. We're currently around 1600.

So relate last year? doesn't. stop making random nonsensical statements.

It's literally data suddenly want discuss it. Nice work get it. family told well. low vaccine uptake AZ shipments point government begging people get expire. Part vaccine hesitancy, part thinking risk blood clots outweighs risk covid near 0 environment.

Understandably country big hurry get orders AZ anytime soon. recent surge like China huge surge vaccine demand. Unfortunately well stocked vaccines depleted quickly little stock incoming Yikes. know difference *total cases* *case rate*? India, world you. yea probs know whats goin Bad bot Unfortunately gets cities countryside, enough infrastructure test people, treat them. aid maybe make dent urban outbreaks, silent rural outbreaks even tabulated fully. I’ve lost faith cdc Fauci actually tell us truth make sound decisions based anything resembles reality. kids can’t vaccinated rescind mask suggestion now. too. amount daily harassment deal with, anything meme worthy majority customers outright difficult argumentative passive aggressive dick noses needed frequent reminders pull mask. hate them. thought people good     
They aren’t. vaccinated thank god. close people job 70 percent people state vaccinated mask mandate now. concerned variants interact closely people every day. It’s crazy assholes allowed endanger everyone.  origin clear. implications becoming official, fragile point time, trouble everybody. flu kills amount children COVID, vaccine Flu, isn’t indication impact Covid children less severe flu? Even vaccines, flu kills many kids Covid. Sadly, babies children Brazil included memo. :( ""A group scientists."" group name? Anywhere read peer reviewed publications? name gave Lord Ridley, far tell never studied COVID-19 virus (while science degree worked science journalism, appear conducted research since finishing doctorate pheasant mating 1983). happened stumble long time ago. remember reading New York city used 'hospital' poor people sick communicable diseases. Lots people forced go never came alive. bad might think put everyone together. 

 
So yeah what's asked people nothing compared THAT. right one, we've seen left one one wants ;) [These people actually care science health, emotion Money Grab. keep kids museums restaurants another months.  Hopefully approve vaccine younger kids soon. Heard coment vaccination rates went vaccines would paid June July onwards. small town coastal provinces. Plus news outbreaks surrounding countries would encouraged undecided take vaccination. think consequence sickness worth caring death? mean measles kill MANY people, cares right? cares people went deaf, etc.... go illnesses vaccines prevent? care death. care quality life.

Our society values ""hard work"" health, big thing us reconsider.

Listening Queen Magicians scene. fits well.  tell happened gym: people refuse wear mask suddenly began show up, updated policy. people didn’t want around unmasked people staying home.  It’s guna feel great! actually want current two weeks. presented idea. I'm discussing it. think want law beyond me.

Man , reaction needle blood drives insane. I’m normal adult male, health problems, consistently work out, really afraid everything, needles, blood, holy shit. body completely shuts down. It’s wild. 

Nothing mentally prepare fix it, really frustrates me. 

It’s possible feeling kind light headed might low blood sugar. eat vaccine?  silly sounds, maybe try Ohio-style lottery idea get unvaccinated adults vaccinated. I’m 26 delayed getting mine unfortunately I’m surrounded anti-vaxxers kept triggering anxiety misinformation. got first dose Pfizer yesterday!  Europe forced AstraZeneca export covid doses Europe rather distribute amongst Australians natives actually produced vaccine. Europe felt covid cases much worse therefore warranted use vaccine low covid australia.

This isn’t Australian problem it’s global political problem countries competing gets vaccinated first. That’s works though. suffered US enough us idiots. post taken trolls think pressure Harris Teeter(Kroger) Whole Foods last holdouts area. Publix, Wegmans, CVS, Costco, Walmart/Sam’s Club updated policy within days announcement. Publix changed within hours. 70 percent people state vaccinated. So, majority people see wearing masks stores. definitely not. following science. Yeah that's husband reacted first shot, reacted second. really, happens USA ban exporting vaccines manufactured country. end actually use, others enough fulfill demand. really issues needles though. mean, like I'm bothered them. give blood often. medical issues require regular blood draws. bad veins too, so, often miss get try again. Except first time gave blood decade ago, I've never passed out. Lol forget farmer March? said I’m “looking down” them? I’m simply observing what’s happening. Canadians let weakness government’s vaccination program getting hand-me-downs US tribal lands due largess generosity federal government. Canadians also getting vaccinated parts country, eg walking CVS. Canadian government made special accommodations vaccinated Canadians easily return. Thanks link! Thank you! states best vaccination efforts country clinging mask mandate dear life?

You're asking best run states making best decisions? Pretty self explanatory. Half, eh? source this? term vasovagal syncope, atleast me, even site needle feel like fainiting. 

When happens, blood pressure drop heart rate slow down. 

In case, sugar always helped this. could purely psychological, I’m health professional don’t know. 

Every year companies yearly blood screenings either pass 1-5 seconds come close passing out. thing helps sugar. I’m going research see sugar legit helps it’s made ritual created brain help cope.   thought post meant American children?

Oh comments got downvoted? Sorry loss Dude. Sure. looneys far end, plenty reachable folks middle, even rational responsible groups. Except cast majority (like survive keep spreading BS around. That's fine, experience lot introverts simply going, also resentment extroverts want almost exclusively kind public activities. think community based. communities, probably won’t get sniff covid Winter. may bunch communities get major outbreaks. numbers rapidly going down. It’s 1348 now. take consideration. It’s going anywhere close 90k.

Also philosophical, it’s job anymore. Every single person country age 12 get vaccine 95% effective. chose get one that’s tribe currently 95% fully vaccinated. Aw shoot, think test that! Wanting follow cdc advice says tens millions unvaccinated people need mask isn’t crazy. wanted point kids still risk know adults lying can’t trusted.  scared. 
You don’t wear mask around them, figured might realized impact decision.  still choose unmasked around little kids, freedom that. kids 6 months get fucking flu shot.... dipshit. 

And yet COVID deadly kids. 

Also, many kids actually get flu shot? Willing bet numbers low. much healthy society would norm wear mask bad cough.

That's fine, I'm staying home sick. However, people asked/forced follow restrictions even they're perfectly healthy. You’re really surprised people want move past this? Really? Yeah, people risk unvaccinated people wearing masks unvaccinated people people unable get vaccine medical reasons.

The first group gets get. second group going vulnerable forever selfishness first group.

Vaccinated individuals done part. Whether it’s today three months now, scientifically significant portion population likely unvaccinated. Vaccinated individuals shouldn’t hook nothing actually help. India 60% adult population vaccinated. good them! They're morally correct thing, people like u/xantharia look them. thought ""beat"" Covid back February got way lax. Combined overpopulation politicians actively encouraging large crowds. isn’t correct all. They’d still subject whatever export rules, etc place, different state, sovereign, subject federal rules. Notice couldn’t give vaccines away Canada, administer within jurisdiction. look this! Thank lagging number deaths earlier cases, essentially baked point. look this! Thank   It’s still considered tourism it’s domestic. EU countries.  
 
We haven’t even incidence rate nation 100 week, domestic tourism hasn’t approved three days. think prudent re-open slowly, allow vaccination program continue opening *global* tourism. meh. want vaccinated youve got now, soon. youll get Covid, mask no, likely. seat belts air bags lot laws...... sure compare apples assholes INDOORS t-shirt picture vaccination card it. 

That's brilliant! BRB, setting etsy shop. mean similar flu like illness numbers previous years compared covid numbers?  research. people caught Ebola Africa big outbreak ~5 years ago got close contact sick relatives, especially cultural tradition bathing cleaning body loved one funeral. entire family-wide clusters.

...you're proving point. cultural habits describe opposite quarantine. 

It's grave choice make, but, situations decide giving one family member save 5 10 better thinking virus spreads silently without aware, that's HIV.

Funny say that. shown Ebola transmitted sexually habits associated sexual acts, also remain latent transmitted years later seminal fluid. Given know HIV rates throughout Africa surprised Ebola move silently populations. is? Disney gonna much fight FL government. like Florida lets basically whatever want. WDW practically tiny sovereign nation. Especially compared Disneyland whole resort barely bigger Magic Kingdom parking lot stuck middle city leading lot rules follow.

Disney gonna make sure stay FL's good side least ready stage #Magical Coup take state military force. never claimed reliable source? asked sources unbiased facts That's terrible, fully vaxxed going gym party Saturday, others even started... Why? choose accept risk *""The ministry noted that, patients requiring hospital treatment,80% vaccinated and tended people co-morbidities.It added “almost all” critical severe cases requiringintensive care treatment vaccinated either. date, noneof patients died Covid-19 fully vaccinated,it said.""* So? People choose unvaccinated get sick. Well criminal past alone makes untrustworthy. screw criminal charge, pattern lunatic behavior. Hardly someone would consider reliable, single uncorroborated source national news stories. Dropping loads. Yes. Remember blue flame medical? republican consultant immediately dropped clients started medical supply company realized bad covid would be. want know much money made.  Remember used stadiums (that went empty pandemic) set overflow? year turn functional covid units. Build hospitals, etc. instead shut hoped cancer heart disease would chill year need may production, one hell lot closer countries vaccine manufacturing capability. We've reopening now, gradual. Went Disneyland last weekend, pretty hard consider things ""still closed down"" point. doesn’t tell story. finds interesting characters involved story lets tell it. Judges telling can’t looks like overstepped boundaries one. say came lab? Read headline commenting on. *Look came from* mask bit longer inside public places bit longer study everything, since it’s simple easy protects people? Makes sense Wouldn’t mass protests act catalyst outcome? 
Didn’t watch USA go thing? Huh? science isnt following? Guidance ""vaccinated people dont need masks indoors"". People, intentionally unintentionally, took ""no mask mandates"" real way back normal life. Yeah went grocery store first time without mask since state store dropped requirement fully vaccinated. I've fully vaccinated almost 3 months now. still felt weird. I'm sure awhile, felt like anti mask asshole. Really feeling one first people wear mask beginning whatever. Yup, choose vaccine mask, tears funeral. wouldn’t take anything says fact either. I’m sure guna call someone fraud using National Review column evidence. Imagine caring *that* much random stranger's opinion you.  e.g.? It’s kind crazy amount people blaming virus opposed governments hospitals stopped seeing patients virus. could found way Why? real-world data natural immunity (probably billions) millions already year+ infection millions upon millions vaccinated people. study people. study gonna show increased antibodies levels know really matter companies gonna use way sell vaccines. better drive anywhere. Cars crash sometimes. need production. talking 1.4 B people. Also India donated 66 Million vaccines poorer countries till April. state? curious. national US database. state, territory, DC database though. could make things tricky dealing 57 entities rather one. CVS done yet? Operation warpspeed, argued helped speed along vaccine production, massive taxpayer funded giveaway pharma companies Like “reputable” Rebekah Jones ?

I’m playing around ok hear probably right thing do. interesting hear someone goes gets one everything available see happens. sticking Pfizer personally though. Biden admin absolutely nothing like Obama giving golden parachutes criminals responsible financial crisis

thanks Obama  Sadly, we've probably even seen highest death tolls pandemic yet. World-wide, going get worse gets better. It’s possible extremely unlikely. Furthermore gives damn unvaccinated bums get covid? India 1% vaccinated surge. Nowhere near 50% number! Dammit that’s convenient  I’m sure cases still big decline state. trend continue  Every article see cites national review columnist source. I’ll wait reputable source report really big fan base yellow fever deniers though. :)     pharmacist fill yellow passport vaccination paper got COVID shots vaccine  hope it’s enough  evidence says she’s fraud? unbiased facts speak of? Ah reputable source Man, can't wait. Working home year killed soul. stop letting media feed us opinion instead facts. 

This real problem general, unfortunately lot people become obvious run something conflicting enough register radar, typically outlet historically trust. disagree. Priority vaccines given countries need it. borders closed otherwise fine. countries people dying. anyone dying covid moment. enough vaccines coming last quarter get everyone. meantime, go slow. benefitting vaccinations also potentially undermining them.

In words, believe vaccines effective despite data demonstrating are. Well yeah. They’re stupid. I’d close border US except vaccinated people. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

And take comment anti-vax. completely vaccinated going two months point. sure hope so. shocked hit India. late game thought massive death tolls.  Based estimated prevalence though, B.1.617.2 cases doubling weekly among unvaccinated population. certainly possible never another surge, every previous country think (see: India) wrong. Virtually everyone critical CDC past year - either they’ve cautious cautious enough. school reopening example, got science wrong students distance 6 feet - since corrected guidance. slow walked easing restrictions largely last weeks announcements masks

The way see make decision point.

Yeah, he's fantastic scientist utterly unequipped face pandemic response like tasked with. know communicate average American know offer consistent messaging. made one cutting full size n95 mask halfway, folding itself, hot gluing seam. found tip online worked surprisingly well.  dangerous though need hyperbole.

lol Basically, yeah.

They abundantly clear messaging greenlight start unmasking applied fully vaccinated people. 

The anti-maskers vaccination took greenlight unmask bother getting vaccinated choose ignore it. clear Astra Zenica good mRNA vaccines, knew already.

Pick poison! virus responsible mental health toll, since staying normal whole time would mean countless deaths greater strain hospitals.  Saw quote Fauci variants vaccines CNN wanted share here.

*Fauci also said Wednesday variant-specific boosters may needed.*

*The wild-type non-mutated strain virus.* vaccine cure means it’s over. Covid dustbin medicine another random nothing-special infection. released, even outbreaks viewed serious strep. Maybe even less. sad thing official numbers way lesser actual ones.  So... racism plan along? Well, least you’re honest it. 

Also bit strange mentioning US’s closest ally (besides Israel) trying spin that. Even better one major shareholders guy giving away contracts Trump.  prime minister chief minster appeared full page adverts invite people ""kumbh mela"".

Health minister appears godmen touting quack snake oil cures like ""coronil"" cow dung

Govt jails people complain lack hospital facilities oxygen shortage

Its shitshow think fine say 'most' situation calls it. mom stuck waiting full FDA approval No, based anything except fantasy. Remember Krusty asked Riblet sandwich made pig? responded ""Think smaller, legs"". Well, think dumber, lies. They're uncomfortable get way social interaction - impossible read facial language on.

Look, trying convince masks fine dandy normal Asian societies wear time - bother. put mask moment CDC said got vaccine soon could. CDC says mask come off, suddenly ""why feel way""? We're year people still spouting nonsense? 


Do wonder doctors nurses crying PPE? Yes, slow spread, they're dealing infected patients worry PPE nothing? 

Yeah, wear more, good mask first line defense them. wonder many problems. Don’t masks social distance measures follow?  Meant say fraction idiots.. whatever millions ppl participated religious gatherings, political rallies group events.. true. people know lockdown means? means country deem suddenly essential don’t work work home. means unemployment, businesses closing (some permanently)

This pure propaganda others said. borrowed printed trillions dollars don’t last year name Covid relief - point pay back sympathy anti-casers. Spread whom? Everyone age 12 get vaccinated.

And even thousand hospitalizations likely we're going get herd immunity. Covid part world now. Get vaccine time move on. Back normal. bothers people wearing masks? (we) seem cowardly, something? find physically uncomfortable? sense society ""abnormal""? something else? ""unpatriotic crybabies"" caused boycott already, remember?

Now, high school college sports conferences required vaccines attend games, could get LOT rural communities middle America general. nature 32 pro teams hundreds colleges thousands high schools, sports much larger reach (especially areas lower population density, rural communities) India democracy. percentage mean least 50%. mean theoretically one could getting tested vaccinated whatever reason. get shot, however, clear fully vaccinated. go without saying conversation become get vaccinated wear mask? whole goal get herd immunity vaccinations natural infection - estimates around 70% population. cant stand tone messaging right - masks shouldn’t main focus argument - vaccinating people should

When tell someone get vaccinated else wear mask face - it’s exactly conversation starter. address reasons don’t want get vaccinated. people never convince whole mandate vaccines don’t live life public going help anyone tribe There'll always *something*. New Jersey saying weeks. saying months.

Nah, people done. Life inherently risky, explained someone hesitant AZ blood clots - likely die car accident getting clinic actual vaccine. Korea's AZ sold Taiwan couple people died Korea batch. crazy want take vaccine.  70% seems thrown lot. personally think end goal kids vaccinated around September. No, sounds much reasonable. black white like think. I've explained unhinged theories like past reflex-banned trouble - twice. would say google like simpleton find source. someone living country without vaccination rollout plan, still feel like America scarier place right now. I’m saying completely follows science statistics. vaccines work. 

There nuance argument. infinitesimally small edge cases overshadowed cold facts statistics don’t comport feel. Sure thing.

Just pet peeve mine someone tries ""correct"" something another mistake.

At least turned reasonable 99% people here. Vaccination rate can’t drop unless they’re dying That's ok. I'd report someone. OSHA? County Health Department?  MEANS Calvinist, Christian, find potentially heretical borderline offensive someone purports Christian would suggest action choose take could somehow prevent God will.

To say actions could interfere predestination would imply God omnipotent, claim would treated heretical mainstream denominations Christianity.  safe people vaccinated, maybe. problem still lot anti-vaxxers there. maybe share wear masks see others wearing them.

Let's make sure thing really stamped drop everything, know? Think awful it'll vaccine-evading mutant strain explodes population keep ""cheap"" measures like masks months. mask mandate removed suggested non vaccinated wear mask? still ""required"" to?

Just weird different casinos serious 21+ casino floor, clubs alcohol get nailed check 21+ . remember casinos making move 21 checked id 21+    People concerned everyone still masking don’t believe follow science, guess think world whole almost breaking point virus. People tendency want around people - suppress long getting pushback. 

I think that’s part reason countries well months Covid struggling Nah, got point fine. interest accommodating feelings basis reality, I've done need covid risk.  strange fuck, that's reddit distancing.

Don't see crowded areas India **1 billion people** country? Social distancing slightly harder advertise free plane tickets India antivaxxers help recover.

Even though hate them, that's eviler. Even you. Purposely misunderstanding misrepresenting point dismissive manner barely even disagreeing legitimately trying converse you.

I think I'm going continue conversation, good one. rate really appear like US executive branch open revolving door offers highest bidder demagoguery.

I asking doctors informed issue give hassle ultimately try direct wrong antibody test. need information able make informed decisions protect since nobody else seems give damn whether poor outcomes. numbers poor early studies suggest asking given additional doses vaccine attain reasonable level protection. 

Until known would much ask grocery stores, pharmacies, essential services protect us requiring masks anyone cannot provide proof vaccinated.

Employers make reasonable accommodations restricting high risk activities immunocompromised workers provide adequate distancing co-workers provided proof vaccination. possible ventilation improvements made workspaces accommodations cannot reasonably provided vulnerable employees permitted work home better protected.

And generous estimate walking completely unmasked crowd yesterday cried. expecting reaction myself. First all, lowest number cases UK ever 2,000 per day. it’s 2,200 per day. Stop trying spread panic. Also India big population todays income tomorrows food - isolation work home really option many dare talk non stop 24/7 around 5% world wide, number goes op massively finish line isnt sight. Maybe partially, temporary, virus mutate way easily 90% world isnt vaccinated. kids seeing type side effects adults th vaccine? wondering time buy last year dropped. They've gone back since then. Thank saying better could. Cutting corners produce end producing less doses 🤦‍♂️ fair, Nepal also midst brutal second wave, (recorded) death figures twice high India, per capita. also need vaccine viruses dont simple ‘cure’. virus extremely small easy target. treat symptoms help recovery, it’s like bacteria develop antibiotics kill bacteria. Also, time give someone medicine patient might already spread it. looks like EU wants major vaccine production hub Europeans, people around world.

So boosters become necessary, likely ""EU first"", doubt we'll really need 1.8 billion doses next years. also heard expect order even doses manufacturers play safe I'm pretty sure need them.

I hope redistribution surplus doses managed way makes fair transparent instead purely geopolitical decisions. Good. way stupid virus mutates getting one time fully vaccinated life likely enough. Booster injections needed. Philippines, parents finally got vaccinated. Can't wait things open couple months.

I'm still vaccinated cause they're still 40+ group up. oh worries, still worse terms per capital total death.

Although India's data likely massive under-count. could show us. 

And what's market it? buy get free Krispy Kreme donuts? What? Im talking people India suffering. it’s anything like Last Us, real. even point? go again. Okay, kids hospital covid reason hospitalized data makes look like reason. huge deal. know kids low risk adverse outcomes.

Well dammit can’t find source read originally now. recollection shareholder sold positions prior given contract. protection hospitilization, 85% death, single Pfizer dose. highly effective. real world data definitely supports widespread rollout single doses moving second doses, UK doing. 1/3 fully vaccinated, surprise. Well say anything wearing mask get slap jaw. remember good days people minded thier fukn business kept opinions themselfs Single dose gives strong protection, particularly serious cases leading hospitilization death. 80% reduction risk hospitilization astrazeneca Pfizer. 

Yes, second dose better, population basis, two people first doses better one person Lol, ""it's okay lie us people stupid"". 

This complete antithesis science ethics. truth pursuit, shaping world want not. Honestly, it’s generally fine. Using word “less” speaking actually common people understand you. pretty good explanation. count many something, it’s Fewer, can’t, it’s Less. C-Suite, Board, Majority shareholders...

All need end penniless, powerless, sad share press conference, way. US, time people got access vaccine winter surge starting drop think lot people aren't/weren't bothered whereas Canada started vaccinating everyone middle surge helps motivate people. definitely explain difference can't ignore We’re pretending natural immunity doesn’t exist vaccine refusers sheltering place masked since last March whatever reason.  US pretty good, I'm 100% sure reach herd immunity coming months.

I'm worried EU though... Poland 31,3% population vaccinated 1st dose (12,6% fully vaccinated), first time interest vaccines saw slight drop week. Since May 9th already every adult wants eligible get vaccine, since days ago people age 16-17 register too. 

Numbers looking good mid-late June eligible people still registering (you choose vaccine, one seem want AZ.

Lol ok. People tired wearing face mask 10 hours day 5 days week. shocking? 9.2% COVID-19 patients dying disease, Mexico highest case fatality rate world.

How know highest fatality rate lowest testing rate? India new variant developed that's contagious variants like British. public events (one highly visited spiritual festival voting country) perfect starting point new outbreak. lockdown downplay government get this. still undergo trials (especially novel virus) case chose wrong target get Antibody-dependent Enhancement. know way around that.

As mentioned people's replies me, study produced inconclusive results.

Where's data says AZ effective preventing severe cases? shut world year people mild cases COVID-19. Ok think we’re differing I’m reading right taking account way effectiveness reducing spread. don’t believe E calling efficacy preventing disease defined trial. CDC seems assert even breakthroughs spread reduced. issue. They've found they're higher effective variant. concern would among unvaccinated population increased transmissibility makes vulnerable. 13 year old got shot. works modified viruses would amazing. None antivirals currently available even approach kind effectiveness. weird wiped mainstream media since weekend.

It's horrible, new guess got bored. 3000 cases variant Vs 170,000 first dose 324,000 second dose yesterday alone

I tend call future supervirus ""Marburg Measles"": contagious measles deadly Marburg virus. 13 yr old kid side effects first shot.  got nailed second husband mother not.  crap shoot.  Neither 17 20 yr old kids got hit bad second time either. masks need public health alongside personal measures. Today finally two weeks since second dose!

Tokyo can’t cancel without incurring huge penalty. 
IOC f*** give locals 6 year old thinks it’s cool too.

That's matters Nah, they'll require vaccine, take secret publicly decry vaccine I'd probably take CDC's word point, especially considering yesterday. Even get EUA September, going like 12+. modify doses younger children suspect FDA review process substantially longer age group. Realistically probably going closer year end September actual shots arms. First off, given underreporting they've much higher time. Second, beginning. India become much much worse.

A Times investigation found Emergent exercised outsize influence Strategic National Stockpile, nation’s emergency medical reserve; years, company’s anthrax vaccine accounted much half stockpile’s budget.

The investigation found federal officials felt company gouging taxpayers — issue also came Wednesday’s hearing Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat New York, demanded know much cost make vaccine sold for. Mr. El-Hibri promised supply information later.

Company executives also view coronavirus work one “prime drivers” 2020 revenues, according memorandum released Wednesday committee staff members. executives rewarded company’s board called “exemplary overall 2020 corporate performance including significantly outperforming revenue earnings targets.”

Mr. Kramer received $1.2 million cash bonus 2020, records show, also sold $10 million worth stock year, trades said scheduled advance approved company. Three company’s executive vice presidents received bonuses ranging $445,000 $462,000 each.

Sean Kirk, executive responsible overseeing development manufacturing operations Emergent’s manufacturing sites, received special bonus $100,000 last year, addition regular bonus $320,611, part expanding company’s contract manufacturing capability address Covid-19, documents show. Mr. Kirk personal leave.

Emergent officials “appear wasted taxpayer dollars lining pockets,” Ms. Maloney charged.

Mr. Krishnamoorthi asked Mr. Kramer would consider turning bonus American taxpayers.

“I make commitment,” Mr. Kramer replied.

“I didn’t think so,” Mr. Krishnamoorthi shot back.  kid putting mask walk dog today. said “It’s optional now, shots.” said, “I don’t want people elevator think I’m anti mask. don’t know shots.” Confusing times. 4 things back full swing, youth outdoor sports unmasked now. great.  [4]

“You reputable company done yeoman’s work protect country biodefense,” exclaimed Representative Mark E. Green, Republican Tennessee, adding, “So gave folks bonus incredible work.”

Emergent skilled working Washington. board stocked former government officials, Senate lobbying disclosures show company spent average $3 million year lobbying past decade. two pharmaceutical giants, AstraZeneca Bristol Myers Squibb, whose annual revenues least 17 times higher.

Democrats pressed Mr. Kramer Mr. El-Hibri contacts Dr. Kadlec, previously consulted Emergent. Documents show Emergent agreed pay $120,000 annually 2012 2015 consulting work, recommended Emergent given “priority rating” contract could approved speedily. Dr. Kadlec said negotiate deal sign it.

“Did Emergent executives speak socialize Dr. Kadlec contracts issued?” Representative Nydia M. Velázquez, Democrat New York, asked Mr. Kramer.

“Congresswoman,” replied carefully, “I conversations Dr. Kadlec this.”

The government far paid Emergent $271 million, even though American regulators yet clear single dose vaccine produced Baltimore plant.  speak stores visited Raleigh,NC. still require masks social distancing requirements longer. [3]

Hours hearing began, committee staff members released confidential audits, previously reported Times, cited repeated violations manufacturing standards. top federal manufacturing expert echoed concerns June 2020 report, warning Emergent lacked trained staff adequate quality control.

“My teenage son’s room gives facility run money,” Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat Illinois, told Mr. Kramer.

Mr. Kramer initially testified contamination Johnson &amp; Johnson doses “was identified quality control procedures checks balances.” questioning, acknowledged Johnson &amp; Johnson lab Netherlands picked problem. Johnson &amp; Johnson hired Emergent produce vaccine and, insistence Biden administration, asserting greater control plant.

The federal government awarded Emergent $628 million contract last year, mostly reserve space Baltimore plant vaccine production. Among things, lawmakers looking whether company leveraged contacts top Trump administration official, Dr. Robert Kadlec, win contract whether federal officials ignored known deficiencies giving Emergent work.
Mr. El-Hibri told lawmakers government Johnson &amp; Johnson aware risks.

“Everyone went eyes wide open, facility never manufactured licensed product before,” said. Baltimore plant “not perfect condition — far it,” argued facility “had highest level state readiness” among plants government choose from.

For Republicans, including Mr. Scalise, Wednesday’s session became vehicle defend Emergent Trump administration, raise virus-related issues: unproven theory coronavirus leaked laboratory China, “lies Communist Party China,” mask mandates Biden administration’s call waiver international intellectual property agreement.

The data supports vaccinated people really spread COVID, vaccines work well prevent COVID infections kinds, including asymptomatic. breakthrough cases, sure, CDC would reversed masks way significant concerns vaccinated getting spreading COVID. Vaccines work, plain simple. 

Aside vaccinated, also include millions people country COVID, recovered immunity. least among people know, Venn diagram ""People COVID"" ""People refuse get vaccine"" almost one big circle, wish people would still get vaccine, least take comfort knowing likely strong immunity COVID therefore potential source spread. still catch covid 95% less likely unvaccinated person. Indeed published case series vaccine induced thrombosis mostly concern females many birth control pills hormonal therapy, known risk factors venous clots. yes, think would theoretical increased risk thrombosis female birth control pill elect receive adenoviral vector vaccine JnJ. would simply choose mRNA vaccines like Pfizer Moderna. poor predictor getting clinical blood clots. 2 patients mutations FV Leiden, one would asymptomatic without ever blood clot, may 2 blood clots legs, one lungs, stroke.

I'm also interested seeing data course risk DIC (disseminated intravsaciular coagulopathy) entertained severe COVID pneumonia. far seen 5-15% COVID inpatients described classic DIC. Unless person given adenovirus vaccine (i.e. JnJ) within 2-3 weeks, risk VITT. Giving enoxaparin standard prophylactic doses considered standard care, higher doses. also people already covid degree natural immunity. vaccines proven effective preventing transmission well. think understand trying say comment reads like kind trumpian word salad Got source asymptomatic transmission rare? seen data that, I'm genuinely interested. Belgium higher death rate country list believe counts Western Europe.

UK &amp; France similar death rates United States severe lockdowns &amp; worse economic impact.

Same Spain Italy want also look southern Europe. 

Central European countries = among worst outcomes planet. clinical trials study incidence ""reactogencity"" effects (temporarily feeling ill) severity . scale used rating side effects like this:

0 = Absence indicated symptom
1 = Mild (awareness symptom symptom easily tolerated)

2 = Moderate (discomfort enough cause interference usual activity)

4 = Life-threatening also boobytrapped car apparently. country plagued convenience completely obnoxious. Excellent questions. I'll address question #2: paid attention previous epidemics caused viral pneumonias (MERS/SARS/H1N1) saw multi-fold increased risk thrombosis, especially venous thrombosis. However, rise level pandemic, enough research attention paid this. 

Of course, different setting COVID-19 pandemic, blood clotting plays key role adverse outcomes caused Coronavirus. Personally, surprised increased risk, didn’t expect though risk elevated extent is. What's doxxing? mean great, BioNTech/Pfizer great vaccine, data Oxford/AZ think (it approved later less people received second dose compare properly). think statement phrased poorly. many people possible long term effects COVID children concern. think it’s understood death rate fairly low, however many adults still suffer Long Covid... COVID affects brain still studied. one thanked yet, I'll it. One starfish time. I'm going say told so

Actually media outlets fear mongering easy clicks. 

I TOLD Nah I’m done now. COVID vaccination (if complete) protect \~95% efficacy, getting COVID get COVID, severe complications COVID. point, risk long term blood clots COVID described patients severe disease hospitalized 3 month post hospital period. see deleted original comment. Shows know wrong. Obviously isn’t 45%. 

Any vaccine efficacy 50% less useless. They’d concerned anyway. always sucks immunocompromised. least there’s social precedent masks wasn’t before. I'm 38. woke next morning feeling like got hit bus. Hurt much move. 2 hours writhing pain, managed get find ibuprofen took that, stopped hurting couple hours later, really weak brain foggy rest day. Fine next day. general risk vascular disease small children COVID, especially young children. reports long term inflammatory complication children COVID many months infection, usually children underlying inflammatory/rheumatologic disease. include Indian variant?  got Astrazeneca vaccine 3 days ago toothache (upper middle tooth), side-effect like noted before? sinusitis also flared right maybe pain caused instead. Missionaries volunteering FEMA trailer took kiddo yesterday.............. Yeah freeze vaccine already thawed likely render ineffective. good news even unable take vaccine, N95 masks work well protecting wearer. 

And unable even that, many stores still programs place allowing shop yourself, grocery pickup. 

More emphasis placed personal responsibility, options protect yourself. International spectators already banned local participation also limited (10-20%). different sports successfully accomplished past year. 100%, i'm dropping mask yet Well Utah give schools power deal because...freedom?  Masks easy. pretty callous take safety friends. Again, masks easy good end goal kids get vaccinated September. 14 year old got last Friday, sore arm days. Lots close friends also gotten it, I'm excited normal school experience fall, starts high school I've worried. thought American legislators possibly get dumber, find way surprise you. 

There still dumbness found! 😀 There's almost info article. 

What efficacy looking at? still 95% 45%? tell us. son friends HS sophomores, 15-16 years old, picked 6 park day chatting vaccines one friend turned 16 excited finally able get - turned 16 week approved 12-15. rest kids already 16 reported side effects talked everybody getting vaccinated would key normal Junior/senior year. impressed knowledge seemed vaccine understanding answer getting lives back. 

I think sometimes overlook much kids lost past year half much faith see vector getting back normal. No. international sports past year problems Covid. Many without spectators. that's takes Olympics certainly still take place. Good - they’re taste makers. hesitant 18-22 year olds peer pressured concede get vaccine. two months daughter's 12. impatiently hopefully waiting. Cdc gave advice individuals governments. really difficult understand? kid got first shot clinic health department set school, lots kids age getting them. older teens already vaccinated volunteering. great see community get together. Yea, keep mind 5 weeks guys vaccinating young poorer countries still waiting first deliveries. 

Also see much higher % people take vaccine here, uptake % US would already turn. know expanding kids younger? 4 year old super worried him. Right know presymptomatic transmission common, asymptomatic transmission extremely rare. children largely asymptomatic, may act primary routes transmission. Additionally, herd immunity essentially question, Covid continue spread even immune deficiencies. many reasons children vaccinated, vaccine primarily protect person getting it. not? Face coverings public normal part society many cultures, especially sick exposed someone who's sick. soonest could book reservation three weeks means me, effectively closed next three weeks

If get reservations weeks means business ""closed"", know successful places closed decades-long existence. It’s shame study poorly conducted. make screw dosage made nice clean study, ages demographics well represented, might seen efficacy results rather 60% conducted initial study. 

I think initial 60% efficacy, many people think vaccine way less effective reality.  right. found screenshots: page FHMs website, “Pandemic Preparedness”: they’ve changed text again. Rewritten completely time include part explain: *The documents mainly support planning influenza pandemic, also used starting point planning pandemics caused viruses.* anyone studied pre-existing immunity UK? I’m curious seems discussed. may underestimating scale Olympics. much 'gold' standard, probably blind luck point. Yeah, get it. think 99% Americans would jump immediately get vaccine? anything works America, especially something politicized.

We well room improve -- good shape (yes, could better). all, diseases risk profile described would considered common cold, circulate time bother tracking US lot talk wonderful positive tests down, however isn’t false sense security? 50% population vaxxed still get (and spread?) COVID asymptomatic illness, course aren’t getting COVID tests. don’t know sick, reason test. 

Is issue kids can’t vaxxed, adults medically can’t vaxxed, whose immunity could going fully vaxxed 6+ months ago.

Just positive tests doesn’t mean less virus going around, right? info, UK 12 week dose gap strategy AZ could partially explain higher real world efficacy trials. fraction speak incredibly small (&lt;1%) contraindicated COVID vaccine, also likely contraindicated vaccines.

We wear masks lockdown avian flu, swine flu, etc. put population risk. thought thinking distribute vaccines vulnerable countries starting vaccinate children? real concern local spectators. International visitors would way likely actually vaccinated. Practically high effectiveness levels Pfizer actually. know else won’t fly? People wearing masks 100 percent safe. followed every guideline last year. said I’m safe wearing mask exactly achieve? wore mask everywhere year, I'm happy ditch state reaching 70% vaccinated. Intentionally making people feel uncomfortable following CDC guidance state guidelines unnecessary. ignorant comment. 
""In weekly surveillance report, Public Health England said estimated effectiveness AstraZeneca vaccine, invented **University Oxford, 89% compared unvaccinated people**.

**That compares 90% estimated effectiveness symptomatic disease Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE.N), vaccine.**"" vaccine? Chances going fine. don't? Try get asap. cannot fear might effective you. feel you, hey, numbers falling across board still likely catch careful enough. 

The vast majority drivers around licenses, still thousands accidents occur every day caused licensed drivers. Check r/IdiotsInCars believe me. Canada centralized health care sign vaccine cross checks birth certificate used sign provincial health care. needed daughters name health insurance # - arrived vaccination site card checked got waved through. posts conspiracy subreddit probably least surprising thing ever. maybe looks like lot people would otherwise take mass transit instead driving. athletes worried much. requirements games many Japanese citizens working large crowds. need giant work force put Olympics. low vaccination rate Japan talking lot unvaccinated workers. Gut survey Right, especially they’ve vaxxed already. kids went first, would borne brunt hesitation. I'm get mine 2:00! Can't wait! Exactly. much protection get. can’t base everyone’s lives around handful people. people still safe can. like disease data I’ve seen, risk COVID children ballpark influenza. I’ve also seen compelling data “long hauler” kids.

So answer question, routinely give kids flu shot live normally pre-COVID. 

Incidentally, found daughter developed COVID antibodies. didn’t know - illness prior normal kid stuff. There’s nothing special Indian variant. vaccines still effective far I’ve seen it’s contagious UK variant dominant variant right US. got India much trouble holding several huge super spreader events got even close level vaccination, well total lack government response. 

As masks, I’m worried. least around me, majority people still wearing indoors even they’re required anymore. Plenty areas states never required masks dropped mandates months ago downward trend. think level immunity vaccinations plus previously infected won’t much issue. 15 year old got first dose yesterday too, FEMA trailer. Thanks military folks organizing that. smooth easy. Everyone know kids age gotten vaxxed already. Many first day eligible. Parents good stuff, guess. Completely agree. enough adults vaccinated lower community spread, would feel comfortable unvaccinated kids returning ""normal"" life. Unfortunately many adults families around us refuse get vaccinated, we're sticking masks kids vaccinated. I'm ready 5 year old vaccinated soon safe. He's done pretty good job wearing mask past year continue wear mine he's still encouraged wear too. present wife got shots asking kinds questions shots - did, hurt, etc.. 

Obviously, really understand COVID makes people really sick know time comes, he's going want shot kid ever does, think understand getting shot good thing. Ok thought using efficacy numbers published. 

I agree aren’t hitting disease stay. However IMO that’s doomsday sounds. able manage it’s endemic mild like cold maybe flu. breakthrough cases I’ve heard locally pretty mild. 

Also agree effectiveness preventing spread definitely isn’t 1 would argue difficult define wasn’t really goal trials. J&amp;J provide data asymptotic spread symptomatic we’re discussing here. 

We also take account protection previous infections also probably difficult number define. 

All say modeling complicated simple equation makes look IMHO. Since AZ works fine UK think mostly sinovac vaccine working intended. case, think maybe mind business? little brutal, think relaxing mask mandates created sense urgency get kids vaccinated. really eliminated ""wait see"" middle ground expecting parents towards vaccinating children. I’ve always hated needles fear flew window able get vaccinated months ago. fear getting covid worse needle phobia! positive news. UK, 13 years old vaccinated yet, says wants get vaccinated soon possible. Hope happens soon too. Vaccinated people don’t need worry getting infected. It’s immunocompromised, cancer chemo patients, kids, willfully unvaccinated (even though pretty much deserve it). It’s tens millions people half population point.

We *can’t* anything unvaccinated already done, that’s get vaccinated. makes sense force vaccinated wear masks. new CDC guidance providing push, both. we'll order online. I'm vaccinated, I'm pro-vaccine,

Sounds welcome 1984, guess.

And deep end. Hope swim! think testing experiences symptoms don’t think vaccines necessarily designed prevent infections, see point you’re making. 

Do control likelihood someone experiencing severe symptoms based age? 

For example, it’s well known elderly 1000x risk child. 50 people experience symptoms one unvaccinated group group consists mostly elderly people, would skew numbers correct? 

Also, low chance experiencing severe covid symptoms general, wouldn’t need wait much higher number people become infected? Maybe like 1000 group account random chance?

There seems inherent flaws study unless isn’t full picture?  get that. Problem reading headline “good enough” people. take run. “I read article today saying…” surprise one bit require proof vaccination attend taping! Seems like logical explanation.

Curiously, seem spreading much though. [In example, small sliver total infections months. short answer: no-one knows.

That one study, ""10% effective"" study criticised unrealistic inconclusive though. study, may outlier, need data.

There anecdotal reports outbreaks South African variants London care homes all/most infections mild amongst vaccinated. reports never go precise numbers can't work efficacy numbers. Yes.

Today, Fauci says he's comfortable seen without mask want send wrong signal CDC announcement. time he's talking March testimony, period studies come saying vaccines protective CDC yet caught official guidance.

That’s accurate. 
Published findings show tests pick fewer false negatives six, seven, eight days exposure five days exposure. recent study tested fifth day, it’s possible counted people negative could gone test positive two three days later. 

[ study examined false-negative rates post-exposure, found four days infection prior symptom onset, probability false negative PCR test went 100 percent Day one 67 percent Day four. even day individuals began showing symptoms, false negative rate still 38 percent, dropping 20 percent three days symptom onset. average, symptoms virus develop five six days post exposure, incubation period long 14 days. And, course people never develop noticeable debilitating symptoms — hence recommendation self-quarantine self-monitor full two weeks likely White Paper: many scientific peer reviewed studies immunity virus good cases better, specific variants individually tested.

But lol'd ""students provide info school nurse"". really think SCHOOL NURSE oversee this? Really? basically ""we're removing mask mandate we're going pretend we're checking vaccinations"". Great, pointed concern making sure others vaccinated missing something? fault vaccinated people

No one ascribing fault, guy describing literal reality situation.

This case one part population pitted another part. swimming pool. lab would introduce bacteria selection pressure antibiotic anything grows developed type resistance. still cases plenty non vaccinated people. situation different?

It depends lot stuff: actual prevalence virus particles available form mutations, much variation spike protein actually possible virus unable infect people reproduce effectively, etc. possible problem (see e.g. case escape mutations inevitable guaranteed.

Incidentally, even petri dish example, sufficiently effective antibiotic sufficiently small colony bacteria would result bacteria dying enough able reproduce form antibiotic-resistant need vaccinated people exposed vaccine resistant strain selected for, right?

Not all. also get selective pressure immune responses live infections. immune system creates antibodies recognize spike protein live infections, mutations spike protein successfully evade immune system resulting longer infection reinfection would likely also make vaccine based ancestor strain less effective. That's current vaccine-resistant variants make vaccines *slightly* less effective come from, fwiw.

We're moving lot faster covid vaccine debelopment.

I'm fairly confident within next several months data suggest intranasal covid vaccines humans least perform similarly superiorly intramuscular candidates currently market; that's preclinical/animal model data points 

Intranasal vaccines pills would allow faster innoculation, require specialist training administer, use lower amounts active ingredient, could even sent via mail. direction I've heard countries like UK say want go 2,3rd generation needed beyond first intramuscular boosters shortly evaluated.

US : 

Children seem spread virus effectively adults. 

We okay vaccination numbers lots natural immunity.

Adults spread virus much effectively children. that's good news. half people 11 vaccinated, many natural immunity. 

So yes, children vulnerable infection, tend superspreaders. people going get infected cause spread already done so, vaccinated. Now, still tons people could infected left. So, need help math :

What additional value vaccinating one additional older person vs younger person? vaccinate young person, protecting person. vaccinate old person, probably preventing spread.

Good point. 👍 PA days away hitting 70% first doses, able reach number second doses end June. Almost vaccines work!!!

IKR? Weird! /s :D Probably kids aren’t whiny little shits vaccines compared white Republican men.  complicated, obviously there's mix tax non-tax factors go picking Ireland investment (there's reason Pharma companies set factories Bermuda, example). 

However, even building factories abroad used dodge US taxes.

Why? flaws perverse incentives TCJA GILTI, one TCJA's main policies attempting go corporations shift profits abroad.

Basically, one way multinational corps avoid US taxes parking high-value intangible assets (think patents) overseas, US does't tax them. GILTI attempted address setting minimum global tax income earned subsidiaries assets *in excess value 10% subsidiary's foreign depreciable tangible property (think stuff like factories)*.

The hope target subsidiaries lots valuable IP tangible assets -- e.g., subsidiary transferred lots valuable IP providing income, they'd still get taxed, hopefully they'd less. 

The problem income taxed income excess certain percent firm's tangible property. Thus, one ways multinationals avoid tax build tangible assets -- e.g. factories -- overseas. way, TCJA actually incentivizes degree off-shoring. 

Here's one commentator [put global minimum tax intangible income (GITLI) discourage tax shifting. Firms real assets abroad big profits abroad offshore subsidiaries pay 10 percent excess intangible profits (this makes new tax system less fully territorial). **But also could perverse effect encouraging firms shift tangible assets low tax jurisdictions abroad (even pharmaceutical production low tax jurisdictions?) raise firms’ tangible income low tax jurisdictions.** Remember tangible income offshore isn’t subject global minimum tax.

Another brief discussion pg. 15 [this disclosure: stuff complicated, expert professional stuff beyond wonkish interest. I’ll add well above, dosing issue. exploring differing levels different age groups. 12-16 age group basically adult (most drugs 12 cut (look Tylenol bottle Sudafed, probably says something 12 ask doctor) Groups kids different doses add kids get less, it’s going take time get right numbers show statistical evidence.

It’s bit extra work teachers, happy since lets closer normal.  hope get number end year. Welcome Bizarro world covid $1 million dollar prize winning lottery.

In states, like mine, chances create incentive like incentivize rollout, rather instill penalty lottery.   Canada (Ontario) able book son first shot coming Victoria Day weekend. turned twelve. Europe screaming screeching…. Nang nang 40-60% effective, ban ban it…

That aged well…. ! Carrot: get take mask vaccinate

Stick: vaccinate, plenty people lie say they're vaxxed take mask off, might infect Yep, WWII showed, easily mobilize resources even hit hard forces overwhelm us short run, loses long run, America quickly built industries capable fighting back. percentages pro vax likely similar.  Trial participants encouraging. hope continues. Well agree, still find sad. We're going reach 100% various reasons. unrealistic. there's difference forced voluntary sharing medical information felt mostly okay till tried go bed night (12-13 hours vaccine). may lull false sense security bit, anti-inflammatories painkillers hand help side effects get. 

I got hit way harder shot 2 overall though, shot 1 expect alright. Heck yeah, HS students last couple years really got screwed lot fun school things covid. vaccines gonna end imo. feel like CDC completely dropped ball this. come guidelines individual states far infected rate/death rate/hospitalizations. insane unilaterally gave green light unmask knowing certain sections country much much better others. long requiring proof vaccination seems reasonable.

What??? keep hearing Florida burning governor pardoning wearing masks!!! kind sad. many countries Africa Asia dying get vaccine, people US need bribes order get vaccinate. Awesome! Hopefully week next see increase compared week prior US! Can’t wait day states like New York drop testing vaccination requirements attend games. 

It temporary thing right? Right... false positive something like 0.5% so? would means expect 1000 false positives ran 200,000 tests, we're still running million. would suggest might have, right now, 5000 false positives per day. also false negatives consider - rapid test 20% false negative rate PCR tests somewhat smaller know small.  job removed mask requirements ending work home. going office meetings like nothing ever happened... weird. hard flipping heads 22 times row.

2. lot mean lot mental health issues pre existing. Yeah took pandemic push people look market crashes data shows up. countries address mental illness better outcomes. Social, economic, etc.. data. Also helps ample Social Safety nets that's different topic.

""tell X died"" last refuse statistically irrelevant (like antivaxxers) ignorant make okay though.  atleast seem like considerate person, others say 99% survival rate 1% country population 13.5 million people, sound okay letting many people die type bad short term thinking led covid supply shortages. 

No amount preparation would left us ample supply COVID-19 vaccines COVID-19 even thing.

The supply shortages around PPE, hand sanitizers, disinfectants, lot ""general use stuff"" made worse people trying hoard scam them.

Oh btw check 


You register website leftover dosage area, would inform you. Like ones think gates put microchip vaccine absurd outrageous!  tell comment sarcasm... I'm sure help you. Catching sure, cant vaccinated people?

Spreading unvaccinated people presumably ? survival rates are, tbats really scary thought.  bound happen country poor rural infrastructure. numbers underreported. real count 30 times numbers shown media. really need collectively go rich people, man.  waited till make decision? waiting for, moon fall? Seriously earth made announcement Moon fell, people would still hesitant. think UK probably paying Pfizer EU. Paying probably also smarter move - better vaccinated couple months early save $0.27 per dose whatever. Ya, started keeping extra mask it’s Minutes wearing one. Still wear one work, day, 10-14 hours day…what’s minutes. unvaccinated still risk catching spreading Covid. Masks work prevent spreading virus, may also help protect peoples germs (especially well fitted K95 etc) Congrats you! got first dose Late February second late March. Welcome vaccinated club!  Went Walmart day two giant “Masks required due local ordinance” signs front. state dropped mandate, Walmart dropped theirs. Looks like it’s era carrying spare purse mask tampons me... fully vaccinated staff places need wear mask 8+ hours day may save one life? may anything well. remember way back beginning told restrictions following science.  guess we're keeping restrictions because?  Americans weird selfish. really dont see wearing mask could issue. much individualism even transmissible B 1.1.7 current vaccines still provide ample protection. evidence causing severe disease. probably become dominant strain UK soon possibly US.

I see causing problems areas low vaccination numbers. unfortunately people see numbers lives.

Ridiculous kids mask help save adults lives yet adults can’t suck masking months save kids life; everyone vaccinated.

Leaving mask mandate place, forces unvaccinated mask well. Yes, it’s minor inconvenience vaccinated wearing piece cloth months could potentially save someone’s life, worth it.

The great ruiner chief, gone yet mierdas touch keeps giving shit. No, really make susceptible getting illnesses? Like flu comprise immune system, get pneumonia health continues deteriorate. Maybe die.

It's ridiculous unfounded fear. Derp fest. Yeah, friends parents won’t let get shot want wait full approval. agree need improve vaccination uptake. Hard kids 12 aren’t even eligible yet, though. I've seen couple papers elevate group. pointed out, NYT. Also Atlantic article recently, well NPR. think used platform put risks perspective, sadly. I'm disappointed journalism days. governor shareholder?  Computer parts expensive 20% VAT rate, much like rest Europe. CDC want unvaccinated people taking masks, done sort mask mandate retraction.

Yup!! I'm Canadian honestly, really hope government make mistake (though it'll PHOs). also, think big brains CDC would seen coming...! ""Masks mandatory two-metre distancing members different family bubble red orange zones. yellow zones, distance reduced one metre.""

This sounds hilarious me. allowed one meter closer yellow zone LOL. kind statements nearing anti-vaxx territory, different direction. suggesting nearly good actually are. crowd hitched identity experiencing sort anxiety making fuss.

Tbh think bigger media problem people falling trap media telling them. Look NYT article basically glorifying guy got COVID-19 wearing goggles double masking. anything, condemned, actions obviously appropriate still got COVID-19 despite taking precautions.

Instead, media props people instead pointing screwed people avoid prevent mistake. March described opposite free market. Lol ridiculous way prudent. I'd hope sake Quebec residents tweak gathering numbers way low considering well vaccines working.  well im clearly doofus I'm bee, going keep list things care about. CDC said vaccinated people longer need wear masks, unvaccinated people need continue wearing masks. Follow CDC said form policy. policy implemented follow advice law strict vaccine passports. satisfies CDC guidelines better sort policy.  Yeah, weird. I'm pro-mask gets, vaccine available. take vaccine ditch mask. 

I've using KF94 KN95 masks pandemic, could get hold them. Prior that, surgical masks. 

Now I'm fully immunized Moderna vaccine, literally point them. CDC agrees. 

I like masks all, high quality masks useful mitigation mechanism paired limiting social interactions. wearing 'just piece cloth' probably even masks right. 

It's crowd hitched identity experiencing sort anxiety making fuss. mean areas millions millions children 12 live? discussion another site someone trying say COVID vaccine useless influenza vaccine issues something called ""antigenic distance hypothesis"". found article respect could applied COVID's vaccine, found super neat article. explains concept really well gives couple scenarios mutations impact COVID-19 vaccine. need stoke fear, uncertainty, doubt. European nations start hitting vaccine walls know rate vaccine hesitancy there. Currently Europe supply constrained. agree, not. I'm forced situation, I'll still wear one, maybe three. (just kidding. enough conviction go social norms much) always 'at most' 4 months doses. People along way seemed mistook it'll actually 4 months doses utopia, perhaps right. real world, I've never met person value lives others. parent value life child life random human never met side Earth. That's debatable. Also, vaccine efficacy percentages would on-top combined efficacy social distancing, masking, hygiene emphasis, etc. like placebo group asked wear masks. Murder hornets serious problem bees concerned successful finding getting rid them. one wants keep talking murder hornets decimate bees. Wouldn’t easier just...keep wearing masks like been, still mandated mass transit, hospitals, jails, schools? kids vaccinated September? ""Listen CDC, except says something like"" truth. probably 10b51 plan, triggered. Folks don’t understand (or want ignore it). edited titles. edited titles, would better daily discussion thread. Screw moron writes articles like these. It’s like idiots said “Why must accept never get back normal”.  right definition efficacy. However, given enough time, everyone would get sick (to good approximation; yes, know herd immunity complicates things bit). point definition efficacy converges said.

I also purposely careful saying “at preventing spread disease,” (as note) efficacy defined clínical trials. It’s amazing pump fking headlines. It’s like slap face. Glad left state did. Absurdity gone wild.  opinion, maybe opinion disagree. think slightly premature, based vaccine availability. Grow up? one talk, passing judgement want get vaccine? 

I'm anti vaxxer, I've plenty vaccines continue get necessary. necessary. treatments covid proven vastly effective covid. Hospitals use ivermectin reduced deaths 90% opposed hospitals haven't. brushed federal govt. Why? FDA law approve vaccine approved method treatment. say dangerous. estimated 4 billion people taken since creation 3 recorded deaths. people said oxycontin totally safe take, hundreds thousands deaths later. want trust them? Go it. cherry top, technically even meet definition vaccine. prevent getting covid, lessens symptoms. 

I sound like fucking conspiracy theorist crazy thing is, I'm one usually arguing people. proven science, disagree facts much want make less fact. desire give pharmaceutical companies money something completely unnecessary. make child. China, even can't take bus without face mask. Pretty much expected found -- grift corruption program one really auditing. I’m too. honestly get pro-mask crowd simultaneously encourages people get vaccine also simultaneously talking impact vaccine. well informed actual vaccines, I'd asking bother getting vaccine people saying talk getting vaccinated true.

I feel like media whole pretty negative tone towards vaccines conservatism, like say ""vaccines 100% effective"". say ""vaccines 95% effective"" instead, actually motivate people getting vaccinated? highlight benefits getting vaccinated talk up, opposed saying ""even get vaccinated, still act like vaccinated""? one…and agree it’s bit eye sore, experience sleeping 7 feet ground amazing. feel secure comfortable sleeping ground tent. 6 year old thinks it’s cool too. trying since december, government helping all, uhhh... reasons. say vaccines expensive, approved 3 billion dollar construction project PM luxurious home. yes, importing vaccines also anti-national (no kidding, ruling party members said asked foriegn vaccines approved) natural end result letting anti-vax lunacy fester.  SHELFISH

Please cite paper concludes lying public health facts increase compliance medium longer term. agree probably work short term, pandemics last months/years weeks. hanging large churches India set another coronavirus milestone week. Wednesday, authorities announced country recorded 4,500 deaths covid-19 prior 24 hours, setting world record.

That number deaths — higher previous record 4,400 set United States Jan. 20 — comes new cases appear declining India, following days end new daily cases broke records late April early May, peaking 414,000 May 6.

As Washington Post’s Joanna Slater reports New Delhi, deaths covid-19, disease virus causes, lag infections several weeks. Despite record number deaths, positive signs India’s surge may slowing, less 300,000 new daily cases week. long-standing questions accuracy numbers recorded India.

Even now, Slater writes, “in India’s vast hinterland, scores people dying covid symptoms without tested.” amid uncertainty, health experts Wednesday debated among rising number recorded deaths actually meant.

In India, even gross under-counting deaths, deadliest day country since pandemic began 💔😢

— Madhu Pai, MD, PhD (@paimadhu) May 19, 2021 Chandrakant Lahariya argued surge new covid-19 deaths may influenced aggressive new attempts rectify problems reporting deaths. Many states still lagging, New Delhi-based health policy expert wrote Twitter, meaning India’s covid-19 deaths may remain high while.

Even new daily cases fall coming weeks, “new daily deaths may stay similar narrow high flat curve, weeks, getting downward trend,” Lahariya wrote.

Those deaths add huge toll. stands now, well 25 million recorded cases coronavirus among India’s 1.4 billion population. official death toll stands 283,000.

Other countries expressing new concern variant widespread India. Tuesday, British scientists said variant, known B.1.617.2, could quickly become dominant strain United Kingdom allowed spread.

In technical papers designed advise government week, scientists said B.1.617.2 could 50 percent transmissible another variant spread Britain late last year caused major winter surge there.

British authorities say number cases B.1.617.2 found within borders remains small, mostly concentrated northwest England London, growing. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Parliament week confirmed cases doubled five days.

Sharon Peacock, director U.K.’s Covid-19 Genomics Consortium, told reporters various measures, travel bans contact tracing, could buy time. Even so, fast-spreading variant B.1.617.2 would “a biological passport international travel global spread” — meaning international spread likely, perhaps inevitable.

That’s true already. recent days, U.S. health experts raised concerns variant spreading here, documented cases Germany, Singapore elsewhere.

“It’s outcompeting viruses,” Jeremy Luban University Massachusetts Medical School told NPR week. “It’s replacing whatever variants before. it’s always concern something like changes don’t know happen.”

The World Health Organization month labeled B.1.617, lineage includes B.1.617.2, variant global concern suggested worrying signs antibodies vaccines infections variants might quite effective variant.

But vaccines remain potent weapon variant others. Wednesday, India broke daily death toll record, British officials said confident vaccines worked variant vaccinations would center country’s fight covid-19.

Britain must move replace “shield restrictions sword vaccine program,” Hancock said briefing 10 Downing Street, adding would increased testing surveillance variant-hit areas, new research whether additional vaccine doses would boost protection.

In Britain, one world’s fastest vaccine rollouts pushed back severe coronavirus outbreak, spread variant raised new doubts country’s plans full reopening June. areas back vaccination process real worries.

Africa accounted minuscule fraction global vaccinations, example. India’s ongoing restrictions vaccine exports already created supply problems Covax, WHO-backed effort share vaccines equitably, announced week short 100 million doses.

On Tuesday, Serum Institute India — world’s largest manufacturer vaccines volume — made announcement suggested unlikely resume vaccine exports “to Covax countries” end year.

Serum Institute India pauses Covax-related exports vaccines least end year - bad news many developing countries hoping Covax deliveries; SSI meant provide 80+% Covax-sponsored vaccines year pic.twitter.com/cX8pRPFWCp

— Agathe Demarais (@AgatheDemarais) May 18, 2021 Wealthy nations finally taking action, France pledging share 5 percent doses Covax year United States promising share additional 20 million doses beyond 60 million already pledged. colleague Emily Rauhala explained, donations “represent fraction experts say need end pandemic.”

The high stakes slow action made clear India. Despite country’s strong tradition manufacturing vaccines, sluggish getting doses domestically. This, combined government complacency loosening restrictions, allowed B.1.617.2 related variants spread — killing thousands Indians day threatening rest world. failed state pass US first doses people actually willing take vaccine?  data yet.

The choice ""wait data, delay vaccination"" ""buy freezers start vaccinating now"". made right choice. bit embarrassment Canadian government. really hate medical system way US one instances actually handled things quite efficiently. Speak lobbyist it. poor, try bootstraps. No, doesn't. explained case comment above.

If Canada &amp; US similar per capita vaccination rates, point do, Canada vaccinating people per day still, means US problem vaccine hesitancy.

""so many people it"" statement work equal per capita rates, means equal number Canadians it, compared Americans Yes.

There billions people need vaccines, they're one place. means distribute thousands facilities world, vials end day end week benefit stored people inject.

It'll become even useful vaccination rates get high areas, there'll likelihood occasional vial needing stored longer. No, gut analysis makes complete sense. know you’re vaccinated unmasked, make assumption unmasked strangers liars risk/benefit analysis, makes far sense treat threat not. 

What upside trusting unmasked stranger store? I’d say upside, spirit generosity, let’s say looking stranger’s full face gives happy boost. consider downside. person could one cough away filling air variant vaccine may may defend against, especially vaccine wanes time. It’s like vaccinated covid unit nurses taking PPE taste rainbow. one wants directly inhale virus. 

Anyway, I’m saying shouldn’t wear mask. People making choices Florida. I’m telling you, I’m fully vaccinated, 100% assume maskless inside stores unvaccinated avoid them. don’t harass stare anything crazy.. don’t want anything them. upside, downside. 🤷‍♀️ No, vaccinated, would less chance spreading, causing severe illness etc. 66% population unvaccinated easily spread population worse, send hospitalisation's deaths again.. need lie accomplish though. restrictions place 100% based scientific truth need lie them. mean, knew 3 5 would be: Trump, Modi, Bolonsaro. question 2 interesting read...  600+ deaths day (almost 200,000 annualized) definitely “flu territory”. masking still effect many places. pandemic still large cost human lives still ahead us. Vaccines work, still small chance minor infection. 
  
You let couple thousand vaccinated Americans one going carry it, protecting local population 1-off cases opening border important. evidence 40 year olds likely infected? far know really much age specificity infection pre-adolescent children protection due fewer ACE2 receptors. 

It may true 40s less likely engage protective behaviors (see: lack vaccine uptake), physiological reason believe likely affected. even behaviorally, seems like profession would much bigger driver exposure infection risk age. Every child learn language social cues... that's really ""niche."" Hope get vaccine soon! US 7 day average peak first wave back April 2020! actually probably much lower, since tests scarce back then. We're talking Massachusetts. 75% adults gotten first vaccine dose. Anti-vaxxers really big issue here. Right that’s saying. threshold looking 50%. 

But people seem saying vaccines aren’t mRNA 95% garbage can’t get us there. 

If never saw we’d thrilled others. 

And I’m also saying they’re simplifying problem. 

Anyway I’m sure replied. 🙄 ""Likely already higher risk due poverty, stress malnutrition.""

True! nearly large factor though, studies I've seen suggested may 50% reported, India likely minimum 10x reported We're height pandemic. “the science” says Fauci continuing wear mask vaccination would improve mask compliance therefore disease control?

“The science” isn’t virus behaviour. It’s also human behaviour.  Reddit. scientists multiple PhDs.

Let's revisit two weeks. surge Covid-19 symptomatic cases, retroactively correct downvotes. agree. think entirely this, people okay variant much infectious previous measures insufficient now. Near end year. may true gaps discrepancies U.S. reporting, feel like U.S. actually reported data honestly accurately majority world. 

I highly doubt error rate / data gaps U.S. scale India, Brazil, China, etc. say. shockingly tragic. highly likely manufacturing capacity useful long-term expand mRNA vaccines treat diseases, too. COVID last vaccine done way, we've demonstrated useful is.  messaging messed start. 40 years olds far away likely infected therefore biggest spreaders. message getting shot protect others. stands tons people hardcore antivaxxers regurgitate ""it stop getting spreading it, lowers symptoms"" line. huge failure people eager lecture people behavior getting vaccinated. enough even keep long? special forces police searching him, guy called Belgian Rambo. Classic Belgium event owever theory people don’t want side effects don’t get people afraid side effects would get them.

Flawed theory. get yearly flu shots I'm risk group usually get side effects. get minor side effects 1st BioNTech shot expecting them. Around 3 percent according google right That’s malarkey! believes kind stuff? Everytime hear kind stuff want wonder got degrees from.

People like gonna cause Indian variants others go control!

My heart already went Indians morning. don’t want heart go countries.  watching. Always begin offering younger set (K - 12th Grade)? Interesting I’m convinced. Firstly I’m British (and scientist, well used scientific definitions, although isn’t field). I’m sure I’m using correct definition defined U.K. gov paper I’ve linked thread. 

Secondly guy makes good point R0. paper talks relative transmissibility, rather R0. 

Call like, effect same, it’s scientific term well understood even it’s hard calculate accurately. keep masks get vaccinated around September. unnecessary gamble people uncomfortable masks months. Technically government also right matters affecting public health. Yeah good want play ninja! Also doctors wore even kid. good allergies. allergies improved year wearing masks.  overpopulation politicians actively encouraging large crowds.

I thought outdoor spread almost nonexistent? Supply outstripping demand vaccines, I'm fully vaccinated according CDC wear mask setting, every state except Hawaii loosening mask regulations...

And yes, masks *are* annoying. get wrong, I'm 100% pro-masks believe disobeying mandate, new CDC guidance. I'm going wear stop required - want care - I'm thinking necessary *temporary* sacrifice. known, known sure long vaccines effective, often boosters needed. 

I guessing check antibodies rise third dose, compare numbers person without third dose, on. Hopefully, estimate successive shots needed continuous immunity. individual decide whether want info shared general.

You right ask random person anything HIPAA related point I'm trying make. Neither businesses anything health care provider. know common cold immunity even help common cold. hope mask wearing sick people becomes cultural norm. People come work school sick refuse take day off..at least wear fucking mask. Go back tin foil hat sub  Yes, key difference viral vector mRNA vaccines trigger much powerful immune cascade mechanism action. anthropomorphize immune response much, body believes threat much serious acute cells generating foreign protein. 

It noted T-cell counts significantly higher mRNA viral vector vaccines inactivated virus vaccines, even apparent short term efficacy (e.g., Sinopharm vs. Astrazeneca). T-cell response expected result lasting efficacy well greater ability deal variants (although AZ struggled South African variant). 

Combine natural benefit making immune system target mutation resistant bit (the spike protein) opposed whole virus clear mRNA viral vector based vaccines amazing. protein subunit vaccines (e.g. Novavax) least bit noticeably effective whole-inactivated virus ones. 

I really think people appreciate amazing mRNA vaccines (and lesser extent, viral vector-based vaccines, although I've never fan complex delivery mechanism). literally perfect. Incredibly easy modify coded proteins, intracellular response generating, incredibly simple direct delivery mechanism fuss like viral vector vaccines. 

While viruses inherently resistant vaccine creation, needs entirely separate approval pathway mRNA vaccines going forward emergency use scenarios. long demonstrated coded protein trigger unexpected immune responses, approved quickly. literally plug play vaccines - manufacturing capacity - coded overnight start mass produced 45-60 day lead time.

I say without exaggeration right regulatory framework emergent mRNA manufacturing capacity, COVID-like outbreak could completely stopped early on. greatest fear MERS-like fatality rate COVID-like contagion. likely eventually happen. need prepared, emergency-use mRNA vaccines key. trying eliminate stupid people genocidal anything. Let's clean gene pool create supreme race! think get much travel either, besides specific countries, generally tourism hotspots. can't believe already. Seems madness even consider circumstances. guess overwhelming cultural desire save face winning moment. Well good thing got rid masks. No, HIPAA applies data type. hipaa protected, be, matter it. I'm already fully Vaccinated. cause everyone 12 get vaccine mean have, 2 kids age 12. common knowledge. like everyone lockdown skeptic crowd started invading sub. spent months war zone desert country. Wearing freaking mask go shopping people Vaccinated hard. weak minded people like acting like kind major acrafice mean really is. simple sensible thing people make sure keep moving forward. Grow crying loud. God forbid ever face real adversity. ex-husband refuses get vaccine thinks it’s conspiracy led Bill Gates depopulate earth kill us all. Yeah, we’re separated quite reasons. I’m 18 year old male got second dose 3 days ago. think know maybe 2 people got shots 25. It’s crazy people 30 refusing get vaccine  world could trust everyone follow guidelines, right. reasonably aware American would know came right said masking required post-vaccination like 10-15% vaccination, many people would lie go back living up. People rational, point public health leaders help make right choice. Came ask They're testing combination covid influenza exact situation you. Finally got yesterday got anti-vax conspiracy bullshit head Hopefully, find way many doses need, donate poorer countries. Wearing mask getting vaccinated last months keeping mask compliance high. 

The shift comes supply concretely outpaced demand, majority population received least one shot. I've posted times seems extremely relevant here, specifically Indian variant though. preliminary testing, many infected working zone airport received flights high-risk countries, including South Asia. Several tested positive B.1.617 variant first detected India, World Health Organization said might contagious versions coronavirus.e Friday. health officials said 28 airport workers became infected, 19 fully vaccinated either Pfizer Moderna vaccines, two approved use Singapore. airport outbreak began 88-year-old member airport cleaning crew fully vaccinated tested positive virus May 5. Co-workers became infected later visited airport food court, transmitted virus customers, officials 

So yes, appears vaccinated people still catch spread covid, even diminished symptoms.  wrote summary vector immunity automod like article explains well Interesting. looks like English, reads like English, lacks point meaning English. CDC hires scientists, policy experts, certainly politicians.

As TWiV likes remind us, CDC says eating rare steaks bad that's data says chance getting sick eating steaks. _not_ mean rare steaks banned, would proper CDC say rare steaks OK contravention best evidence. people weak can't handle dealing simple face mask pandemic? Hope something physical verbal assault definitely know take good sick day :) lie Yeah, whatever, good news 2023. Right vaccination still slow kinda give already. Man wish lived America Who’s misinterpreting this? couldn’t easier understand! masks anywhere anybody. hypothetical question. 

If disease originally threat level everyone people (under 12) can't get vaccine now, would still world changing measures keep control? Meaning everyone contracted risk throughout age level current adolescent 

I hope said clear enough, I'm hard time putting right words down. Better manufacturing capacity ready case another pandemic shows up. Would much cheaper ready build scratches long run.  let ruthless Countries barter vaccines? like arguing need militaries around world. Maybe they're needed themselves, fact countires makes necessary one Idk, get pretty dirty looks wear mask here.

I wear one stop getting glared at. got second vaccine weeks ago want cause conflicts. Pfizer vax best lot! Considering history US government vs Tribal leadership largess would normally exactly correct. 

In case think self interest, even enlightened self interest.  yes. Stupid. Many sports problem past winter vaccines available cases spiking many countries.

It's hard manage try. mandate athletes tested participate, outside games - essentially quarantining? follow rules, test positive, participate? That's great, thanks friends part stop covid. bit abnormal. super sick day (easily sick I've 10 years) outside 24 hours I've great. everyone I've talked to. dont know anyone work long lasting side effects vaccine. I'd see doctor something else going on. agree ethics doxxing, control courts.

The vaccine rollout could reach early-20s first weeks next month, Telegraph understands, hopes over-18s could offered jabs June.

The programme move aged 30 next week, extra supplies sent areas worst hit Indian variant. 

Ministers said Government track meet target offer first doses adults end July.

But NHS managers begun drawing plans accelerate timetable, amid concern spread Indian variant among young adults. 

From Thursday, health service offer jabs aged 34 over, programme expected reach aged 30 next week. 

Meanwhile, surge testing vaccinations sent areas worst hit Indian variant, bid boost uptake among eligible, Hounslow, Leicester, Kirklees North Tyneside among areas targeted. 

The Government resisted calls allow widespread rollout vaccines younger people, insisting strategy speeding second doses 50s effective. 

However, many areas found ways target younger groups, services London, Bedford Bolton among offering jabs multi-generational households. 

Internal plans drawn NHS managers suggest vaccines could offered over-18s within five weeks - month ahead Government target.

While rollout first doses slowed April, return previous pace could mean programme reaches early 20s first second week June. 

Ministers already accelerated plans administration second doses, meaning 50s could fully vaccinated June 7.

Prof Stephen Powis, National NHS Medical Director said: “The success NHS Covid-19 vaccination programme, biggest history, accident careful planning precision NHS staff delivered 48.5 million doses across England less six months.

“Getting vaccine single important step take protect ourselves, families communities Covid-19, you’re called forward, book appointment join tens millions already jabbed.”

The Health Secretary said Government remained track hit target offer vaccine adults end July. 

Matt Hancock said: “Our vaccination programme – fastest successful NHS history – moves forward pace 34- 35-year-olds invited jab. incredible news means remain track hit target offering vaccine adults end July.”

He also announced start trials, could see booster jabs defeat Indian variant offered autumn.

Almost 3,000 people recruited NHS trials, establish effect third dose, protecting existing new variants. 

The £19.3m clinical trial test Pfizer jab alongside AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax, Janssen (from Johnson &amp; Johnson), Valneva CureVac.

Three vaccines also tested half dose, scientists say expect enough provide adequate immune response. 

Meanwhile, scientists Wednesday said Indian variant may transmissible first feared, amid increasing confidence ability vaccines counter it. 

By Laura Donnelly, Health Editor there's People country live lining hour more, booking appointments weeks months out, showing clinics end day see they'll give spare doses. People still desperate vaccines. Even though almost 50% population first dose, enough people want vaccinated still governed supply rather demand.

The USA privileged condition excess supply, yet people still can't bothered get vaccinated? get it. 60% adults received least one dose vaccine. Second doses starting ramped well. fourth major country entire world behind Israel UK, USA. Same. felt tired dose one. kid slightly felt injection site. Yes, there's much understand every time become confident enough make predictions virus shows us sneaky nasty be. 

And double yes vaccination rollout. feels great receive vaccine terms feeling liberation gives personal level. We're protected everyone is. Given enough time opportunity mutant threat variants remains. west plenty vaccine (delivered, administered ordered) roll continues apace, remember everyone planet needs access vaccine. means west (developed nations) foot bill. Many current vaccines ideal less developed areas around world faster cheaper robust vaccines get every last person better. going disheartening see wastage along way worldwide community keep pushing global access. comes shit?

Scientific illiterates, oh, right. good stuff! better almost everyone else.
And surprise it. Good them. get wrong. care topic . that's wrote post thread. Sure, one would think goes beyond idiocy rather contempt people provide service you. kinda understand wearing mask shot feel sick, there's reason get tested...if there's even slightest chance contagious would risk causing breakthrough case administrator test? HI gonna neighboring state pressure. that, they're tourist dependent they're looking completely different situation states. know there's place US (normally) high tourist resident ratio. Maybe DC.

I'm crazy mask guy means, keep another month, really mean anything. like rest US super affected culture Hawaii. large one. XL mixed breed decided drink soup pot stove one day. Good thing burned. decisions impact you.

They petition government 'do something' thing they're irrationally afraid of. would crap ton deaths. US butchered response. reason they're ok, vaccine manufacturing capacity, however American population much less willing get vaccinated proportionally, seeing recent stats Canada catching first doses. 

Healthcare differences also much different, travel patterns different. would nightmare try contact trace America would unfortunately put Canada much worse position regarding pandemic let every anti-vax, anti-masker through. 

People forgetting Pandemic far over. There's still significant chance mutation arise escapes current immunity attributed vaccines, happens (and lot experts think will), we'll need boosters rapidly, there's window another dangerous wave since everyone vulnerable strain. 

Hopefully mutants remain still somewhat affected vaccine, mutate little terms antigenic shift - would ideal. 

But Covid rampaging India Brazil etc. perfect grounds mutants emerg take hold. 

Vaccine passports best way ensure lockdown again. 

Once close herd immunity variant emerges spreads, we'll know come abroad way could get back Canada would vaccinated travellers. gives us better window take action. 

Keep border closes unvaccinated travellers Covid wiped out, indefinitely. 

This something new, already travel Africa example. I’m walking door, it’s google-able. consultant majority shareholder emergent.

I’ll try get back thread later hate somebody asks source can’t immediately respond. vaccinated may really care.

get vaccinated people, please idea end masks better reputation vaccines terms protecting COVID spread? seeing many comments seemingly pro-vaxx people imply vaccines essentially useless masks true way protect others. That's unfortunate.

Residents going see first-hand exponential growth looks like.

I'd almost inclined add ""but fortunately get benefit lessons learned countries"" except I'm pretty confident rely believing exceptionally above-average humans cleverly avoid getting infected.

This dig Taiwanese. watched human behavior worldwide past 16 months. words, go again.

This one cases I'd like really really wrong something. aye true  already made egregiously false claims Texas ranks respect case/death rates. wonder really foolish one here.

Nonetheless, new contention late-April stall death rate due removal mask mandates way back *early March*, ignoring major factor (vaccine rollout) play. Death rate decrease stalls vaccine rollout stalls. unique Texas. fact, trend see national scale. fact is, Texas better case death rates states. Wait, mean hard work dedication ? mere presentation idea wearing mask 2 weeks people legit wantithe shot unable fully vaccinated yet due rollout plans availability, somehow ridiculous public health theater paranoia? propose follow CDC guidance unvaccinated keep masks without universal masking? supposed care CDC says something safe care say something risky? There's always level corruption nepotism agree, continually demand better vote accordingly, I'm gonna ""both sides"" issue personally. What’s “my state”? isn’t really news.

The American media particular negative media outlet world. Look 'U.S. media far pessimistic covering coronavirus pandemic anyone else' find study it. genuinely hate it. They've created population paranoid germaphobes I'm sick people saying ""well better people scared enough."" That's like saying ""yeah gave OCD point they're washing hands bleed that's better washing all."" binary choice. They're equally bad. Oh okay thanks. Nevermind sorry fair live Houston (based post history) CA residents visit context I’m speaking solely realm Covid.

That's line sand. Thats said. good skeptical.  you’re vaccinated decent health. enter Canada visit family member long stay days quarantine upon arrival.  think strategy reason U.S. slowing new first doses? approach U.S. taking reason can't get people vaccinate. 

It matters U.S. acknowledges issues we're literally neighbours - pandemic. think that's relevant? Canada tearing new asshole trying understand found situation did. invested least billion dollars restarting vaccine production pipelines, 200million announced new mRNA production facility.

China never let us know. may different two countries literally took different approaches distributing vaccine. 

But course, always important people make sure Americans acknowledge problems America has, rather people confront problems, Canada take 1st dose priority method first place. Although agree general sentiment here, cases equals chances mutation, means chances something defeating vaccine.

The initial studies testing COVID-19 vaccines include people getting treatment drugs suppress immune system, like chemo, people weakened immune systems reasons. studies needed see first vaccines work people healthy immune systems. this, it’s yet clear effective vaccines might groups people.

Asking genuinely, links appreciated. Yeah little bit complex honestly don’t even know really complex feel like country’s duty people first. It’s whole reason putting power. Also big thoughtful country anything solid footing themselves. 9 year old waiting paitently can. I've actually part-time last couple weeks. People mostly receptive. CFR direct function testing rate, test mild cases, ""C"" CFR remains low.

Mexico second lowest North America region tests per capita (according Worldometers), Haiti scoring worse (no data available Nicaragua). Mexico done 53 tests per 1000 inhabitants, compared 1400 tests per 1000 inhabitants US. Everyone's waiting clarify whole wiping things situation. may CARE indeed wearing masks inside grocery stores, clothing stores, banks, post office, indoor locations. minute Newsome says “you remove masks you’ve vaccinated,” masks also coming unvaccinated counties, problem large percentage people counties want ever get vaccinated (how know? - live know people firsthand). counties absolutely different set rules time-table things counties higher percentage people vaccinated. imagine heard much it, all. Although I'm really sure often low threat virus sweeps across world. would interesting hear virologist's opinion. many people went without tests back then, deaths likely counted appropriately either, making adjustments based deaths solid.

We seem well right now.  Yep, places already started implementing this. way go! thank responsible many “grown ups.” Like where? know it’s really funny it’s awkward situation moment. go somewhere wearing mask feel little awkward others wearing them. Like I’m a-hole need t-shirt picture vaccination card it. usually pull mask put point. don’t want anyone think I’m unvaccinated liar. also don’t want make others uncomfortable.

Eh. I've heard ""example"" argument kids wear they're told to, they've told number things adults can't - like drink alcohol, drive cars, use certain words, etc. also want really want shots later year. Oh fair? Guess what, life fair. trying asshole, believe coddling either. (Flip side, kids lots things adults can't, where's fair that!) remember correctly European medicine agency slower approve Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine bothered manufacturers alot questions RNA integrity different manufacturing plants transport routes. Whereas American FDA basically simply said ""everything 60% fine"" (which smart move time pandemic eyes). european slowness EMA annoyed alot back then. hand seemed little bit careful. Yup. Moderna's 21 different conditions they're targeting already. forgot mention Taiwan’s outbreak seems originate US, another failed country.

Like, really, really fucking good. doesnt even take consideration infected harder time spreading virus due lowered viral load, Fauci mentioned, vaccine likely still nearly 100% effectiveness severe COVID.

There may variant arises may make us question 'vaccines work nothing worry about, period' statement, variant ain't it. Thats great dont listen science? Yep. know antivax people social media furious it. rule though, can't anything it, afaik. hasnt, death rate thing matters, number businesses, number depression, family hurt restriction astonishing. Ontario, cannot even go store bowl thats essential. agree you’re saying oddly enough. That’s can’t vaccinated drop masks unless we’re fine unvaccinated dropping masks too, would break cdc advice.

But think could ways verify vaccinations. vaccinated could drop masks hear screeching scarlet letters things like that. true whether COVID-19 existed, right? there’s outbreak COVID-19 Japan issue dedicating staff Olympics? amazing often medical privacy experts refer *HIPPA*.  people know youve vaccinated? dont really countries enough people vaccinated safely assume.

It matters unvaccinated; are, likely vulnerable infection unvaccinated people.

I'm vaccinated. I'm highly unlikely virus, symptoms, spread them.

Vaccinated people highly unlikely contribute whatever spread virus there. sure, honestly. live anymore. 

I know young adults register vaccine done within week so. know anything younger ages. Canada handled covid much better US terms death suffering. Canada actually one lowest death rates among western countries. decided take approach protects citizens even means restrictions longer US. Maybe blame poorly US botched covid response extremely high covid cases deaths. I’m sure canada data showing big portion infections originating US. promised delivered

There's Star Trek engineering joke somewhere  Googled see mandates still place. Can't believe there's still 50% OUTDOOR capacity restriction. Um, health insurance. think it’s for? contract insurance company. 
Do health insurance?

I’m 60 way. violate HIPPA?  county zero new cases two weeks straight it’s refreshing see. Even much heavily populated county next seeing average 5 new cases day. great people know youve vaccinated? dont really countries enough people vaccinated safely assume.

Thats lot world advised experts maintain restrictions like wearing face masks.

So listening science is, world, opposite recommend. Yes, far read vivo tests mice. Lots great info here! I’ve saved comment. mostly clinical trials designed way, data using OTC painkillers hand (in pivotal clinical trials, participants take OTC painkillers beforehand) Well right know CoVid cause serious long term problems AIDS still can. understand less CoVid HIV!!!

No, definitely same. Maybe print version come out. Seriously. closed point significant degree? LA county basically back normal. cases keep dropping.

Twitter keeps telling we're doomed!!!/s Never mind, you’re right, I’ve looked found published March 16... weird indeed brazilian 15-yo, feel scared mom's coworkers (her working healthcare receptionist) got vaccine side-effects bad (One coworkers got shot, really bad headache, boss also pain anything meaningful days).

I'd absolutely love take vaccine, guarantee I'm going end bad side effects. knew I'd get voter. Pathetic  Sure, think that’s totally reasonable policy. 

I’ve even heard idea mask hours grocery stores like used elderly people beginning pandemic could reserve certain blocks time businesses masks required everyone people worried kids feel comfortable environment go, could interesting way handle it. 

I totally understand people want cautious not, feel faction dedicated overstating risks kids, gets us insane policies like CDC camp guidelines. point was, taken decades try understand HIV. take time understand virus others. 
I using example. 
🤦🏻‍♀️ welcome 🤣 understand someone writes, got vaccinated **AND** contribute rush patients collapse health care system cause someone else die, **strictly** one contribute rush patients collapse health care system cause someone else die seems extreme.

I got vaccinated myself, much much much lower chance getting sick, like getting sick would wager people like getting sick well. also got vaccinated could return life knew prior pandemic. parents getting vaccinated gave piece mind safer pre-vaccination, also allowed parents return somewhat normal existence. Ditto wife, rest family, rest family friends, vaccination took weight shoulders, obtained vaccinations benefit.

I consider byproduct obtaining vaccine benefit others, main motivation would guess many others well.

I'm starting see social distancing ending morning shows studios like NBC's Today. Kids usually feel parents things anyway. parents anti-vax probably to, vice versa. course, exceptions.

I can't imagine forcing 15-year-old medical procedure. many smart people easily manipulated they’re told idk that’s right though ""Not punishing good people things bad people literally lawlessness!"" least monitoring carefully making clear vaccines still effective, 95% effective people latched onto. live area variant known spreading, may want take extra precautions.

And CDC absolutely monitoring breakthrough cases (not severe ones) get true gauge often vaccinated person transmit variants. reread comment 

We know drop neutralizing titers plays regards real world efficacy B1.135. drop neutralizing titers considerably *less* regards B1.135 published today... Although maybe preprint 2 months ago? It’s peer reviewed published now. 15k cases virtually deaths year 1.5 billion population effectively zero. 

We use statistics talk India.. even though acknowledged likely 5x higher reality. still gives us good idea going on. idea going China.

Please ask doctor. sub medical advice.  often 5 year old riding air planes. least year. we're talking 4 covid hit. 4 year old remember much shit 2 years ago. 2019 must ton vacationing you. said anything since he's busy staring mirror trying convince he's smarter CDC doctors. Yup. Can’t blame them. vaccine that’s 25% effective literally waste space. correct. shit happens. got first shot saturday, lot parents taking kids get one too. Everyone idea. 1,300 kids age 17 died within year 2009 flu pandemic, change public behavior basically nonexistent. case numbers could grow exponentially depending transmission rates, something really possible vaccine doses.  think mean superficial presence. vaccine antibody response stronger physical protection mask say risk low long term complications areunlikely etc. feel right saying ""don't worry kid,mommy daddy got shots go things again. Oh,your shot? get later!""

Then parents continue wearing masks role models kids make sure kids feel left out. kids, that?

This contest deal shit. problems relating parent COVID-19 magically mean people can't problems things. absolutely loathe people try minimize other's complaints ""you're complaints bad enough!"".

Everyone shitty lives due COVID-19 last year. one's suffering worth one else's.

Many kids smarter parents days. data shows kids poor spreading virus. studies show adults around children actually less likely contract covid. set aside emotions second look data/studies.

“Research led University Glasgow Public Health Scotland also suggests risk testing positive actually lower adults living household child households without children.”  think public really divided 2 camps: want press full speed re-opening, who're fine string re-opening throughout year 2022. I've downvoted suggesting firms office buildings &amp; complexes encouraged start laying grounds bringing employees back sooner rather later.

Clearly something used too, state requires quarantine. you, would talk something know nothing about, digging hole.  collaboration cure coronavirus. three legitimate concerns here. First, collaboration result Canadian government funding research could used Chinese government create biological weapons? Second, research institute ""outsourcing"" dangerous unethical research that's banned Canada much less regulated Chinese side? Third, Chinese partners exploit access site steal non related confidential information?

These xenophobic questions. They're actual concerns based past occurrences. unvaccinated people accepting risk choice refuse vaccine.

We need worry since half claim virus hoax vaccine poison anyway.  ouch. meant say they’re already 12….that’s heard. straw manning, one asking mask.

There literally TONS people this.

What planet living shitload people insisting vaccinated people need continue wearing masks, bogus reasons like ""mutations!"", ""think children!"", ""you'll make unvaccinated people take masks"" such? sorry angered you.

Someone correct I’m wrong still places polio still spread, hasn’t mutated however many years make vaccines irrelevant? imagine many years 60s 70s etc polio still common poorer countries didn’t mutate ..: also thinking viruses regularly vaccinate. reason they’re worried mutations Covid? media scaremongering? high school hosted vaccine hub last night library amazing turnout.

Well 6 hours zero side effects. I’m pretty pleased. Glad decided mRNA vaccine.

Everytime news COVID situation always portrayed negatively, always sympathetic towards countries like politicians great job managed start vaccinate people, we've already started vaccinations way earlier , mention contained virus, low cases deaths.

I think question going pressure tested pretty heavily coming months. non expert intuition always need small carve exceptions due legitimate health conditions make vaccines contraindicated, aside requirement ability mandate vaccines access business services legal long expectation made known prior transaction. going work borders closed international tourists? domestic tourism booming? rude seriously idea chance last extension? tried contacting city? live one poorest cities US even offering house visits people bad transit access. might advertise it. sure example applies anything.

Speaking someone used wear fit-tested N95, doubt general public could tolerate actually breathe something like that. Let alone remember change required intervals. Verbal assault legal places, narrowly defined rest. It’s hard write law criminalizing kind speech without bumping First Amendment. 

It’s perfectly legal mean strangers, example. can’t directly threaten them, directly order people harm them. Yeah, still immune response, conditions less others. 

""At University California San Francisco, Monica Gandhi colleagues found HIV patients seem produce fewer antibodies average, optimistic amount sufficient protect people.

Make policy based facts, fears. evidence suggest COVID-19 mutating rate presents issues, make policies based that. everything far suggest that.

Michigan dropping almost pandemic restrictions July 1st. Gov Whitmer says expects end sweeping Covid mandates Michigan. That's strong statement governor shy mandates throughout pandemic, gives hope future. Great question--all hte vaccines safe effective. FDA put temporary pause J&amp;J super rare blood clotting issue determined OK go forward it.

the main difference J&amp;J 1 injection two vaccines require 2 doses spaced weeks apart.

I would definitely hesitate one that's offered work, convenient! generation wasn’t bombarded anti-intelectual,!fear-based propaganda 40 years I’m aware he’s saying we’re protected existing mutations. There’s still risk new mutations.

Here top scientists advised FDA vaccines co-inventor technology mRNA vaccines. infectious disease specialist Penn's Perelman School Medicine Children’s Hospital Philadelphia, Dr. Offit member Vaccines Related Biological Products Advisory Committee Food Drug Administration.
“It’s reasonable concerned variants, virus continues drift level,” Dr. Offit said. “We worry people naturally infected completed immunization series nonetheless less hospitalized one variants. hasn’t happened Weissman, co-developed technology made mRNA vaccines possible, currently working multivalent vaccine cover current future variants University Pennsylvania.
“Nobody wants position variant suddenly infecting everybody again,"" said recent interview. ""We haven’t hit point. we’ve got time *not* exist limit you, individual, disclose parties.

Fair enough. Immigration education business, state law requires certain immunizations children adults enrolled child care, school, college. State law also mandates immunizations adults specific fields work curious whether state federal law addressed whether business may require immunizations patrons. Covid stay. never ""under control"". million years. Get used it. go everywhere without mask now. every-time. Monday people giving bad looks. Except people working.

Today don’t get many uncomfortable looks despite people still wearing masks.

Lesser isn’t related situation. It’s completely different word, assumed person made typo. Yay! 👏👍 Yes, already several mutations (variants) concern.

Lol, imagine thinking getting dinner would incentivize people. Oof. Looks like Taiwan learned worse sort politics US.  really make sense USA starting vaccinate children, countries even finished vaccinating everyone risk groups, though... know certain Stop &amp; Shop still does

It Stop &amp; Shop, hear 2 employees say need mask vaccinated. However, 2 employees 2 people working masks aware Fauci saying vaccines protect mutations, right? independent research also also possible, there's need yet first people got vaccine.

They really stop first study participants need it. They're measure give rest us warning.

There plenty vaccines give kids 4, 5 times childhood. big deal, vaccine hesitant see evidence first ones useless. I'm impressed well long Nationalist view would protect country's strengh cost.

Trust science. Vaccines work. know posted intention genuine, know damn well 100% vaccination rate, children arent vaccinated anywhere yet.

My point attacking someone making associations something know something know about, calling ""weird"" saying they're ""suffering"". 

My point calling weird pretty commonplace *you* weird one either knowing refusing acknowledge attempt seem superior thing that's gonna put grandparents hospital 😈 Giving extremely nuanced persnickety guidance like famously dumb impatient American population obviously going fiasco.

Public Health guidance simple, understandable, targeted average person, highly credentialed members PMC going obsessively parse every word. also needs consistent long periods flip-flopped every weeks. kinds policies take months filter population, including signs posters made, corporate policies changed promulgated.

The takeaway population latest announcement obviously going ""the pandemic over! need wear mask anymore!"" think extremely predictable anyone functioning brain. Also huge shout every parent signed kids vaccine trials! fellow Floridian tell wish cdc guidance came asterisk stating apply here. 

There people waving pictures guinea pigs side road rush hour warning people get vaccinated. I'm trying breathe air normal circumstances. putting approval 11-I think 2 year olds September means probably see come October. wish earlier could started school starts understand trials younger patients bit different think so. maybe need someone explain prefixes me.  indeed legitimate question. essentially you’re saying unvaccinated people pose extremely minimal risk vaccinated people vice versa? Thank you! idea this. Hopefully summary long, sure would moderated I’m trying figure polite gentle way ask question. never used wear masks protect elderly immunocompromised flu diseases. many us vaccinated covid (my county 72% partially vaxxed, 53% fully vaxxed), isn’t fully vaccinated people wear masks protect slim minority immunocompromised people kind like boy bubble reverse? Like made healthy people change everything along? Good American politicians, general, bright. current crop Republican leadership especially dumb. honestly embarrassing. We're laughingstock. Well, Germany example incredibly low vaccinations: May 18, 11.9% fully vaccinated, 38.1% received least one dose. Tbh, German, I'd prefer keep doses time. You’re grumpy morning. None known vaccines 100% efficacy, hopefully third dose improve efficiacy percentage points. Sure, kids vaccinated. TL;DR mRNA better got $10 sinusitis AFAIK less rate. I'm surprised know 1 person side effects, bad thing. Several people know reaction, mostly second dose. Nothing major, feeling like shit day back normal within 1-2 days. got knocked ass spent day bed fine that. Personally typical sore arm felt rather tired second dose nothing else. also true infuenza, reached point young middle aged people enough partial resistance survive annual flu without vaccine. Hopefully true covid. Covid prevalence low risk catching disease small even marginal higher risk. medium high prevalence risk disease much higher.

We fortunate UK moment low numbers cases younger people tips favour AZ alternative readily available. cases higher would tip way.

If catch covid risk much higher side effects vaccine. fact states waited \*near end pandemic this, allowing mandates exist thick viral spread says everything need know intentions Meanwhile, country, still combating ignorance. People think one big conspiracy, vaccines responsible uptick cases.  Definitely search urban dictionary definition said? legislation itself.

The speculation comes “long term damage” argument idea covid cause long term damage kids making decisions based something idea happen isn’t sound policy.  spent year trying instill idea people wear masks public, CDC thrown window *for apparent reason*.

I think vaccines reason... Ok, so, here's take this. 


1) were, societally, always incredibly selfish dismissive immunocompromised people before. I'm saying wearing masks forever, basic things like hand washing, staying home things sick (and especially mean optional things like restaurants parties, etc,). We, society, suck it. abysmal sick leave policies place, punitive absentee policies schools. We're selfish society puts (and germs) ahead protecting others, corporate money ahead personal well-being. 


So could take away protect others simple things, would step forward society. RIGHT may mean masks essential businesses and/or accommodations work school because....

2) Covid still brand spanking new. highly transmissible. vaccine working variants, showing less efficacy (closer 70% South African variant example) airport cluster Singapore showing even vaccinated people wearing masks taking precautions catching Indian variant. we're done yet, especially areas widespread vaccine coverage low community spread. regular people may get mild-moderate symptoms, still devastating immune compromised people gaining much cases protection vaccines.  


And meantime good effective anti-virals. nothing use prophylactically. IVIG products yet. best test positive, give monoclonals hope best. 


And finally 


3) showing covid mutating rapidly immunocompromised people. callously disregard population (by taking societal precautions also making accommodations them), flirting getting variant affects us all.  


So ""vaccinated people wear masks everywhere forever!"" rather ""immune compromised people also need able work go school get groceries medications medical care we, society, make safer do"". There's middle ground here, seem bypassed entirely. sure birthday last week sometimes get confused? No, 440,000 people applied unemployment benefits last week. still work force. Passports would likely apply crowded gatherings people like concerts sporting events.

They’re going stop going restaurant bar, although smaller places could require wear mask.

You would able enter society places couldn’t go would limited. Hint: writer uses incorrect terminology calling strain, article trustworthy source information. Well bad news painful body hair loss comes Brazilian variant. knows. It’s taken hold Would okay 15-year-old get second dose Pfizer vaccine two months later instead three weeks? going country two months, way get vaccinated country, wondering would better get least one dose leaving, would better vaccinated coming back US, getting second dose recommended interval.  mean, could give every kid world vaccine drowning would want well.

I guess question is, many preventable deaths 12-15 year olds okay with? Yup, India Brazil look good places start COVID medical trial. things go well, could similar timeline vaccines, maybe bit longer trials take longer US spread much lower. means need re-evaluate strategy vaccination.
It's simply feasible want re-vaccinate 8bn people.We need drastically reduce number people need vaccinated maintain normality.

We need conduct trials prove vaccinating risk groups sufficient (and anyone else wants get vaccinated). also includes public universities state much broader range age including older adults. It’s absurd ban ability schools able make decision themselves. Vaccine passports clearly aren’t going work.

This affects ability hearing-impaired read lips, asthmatics breathe easily, population large able see facial expressions conversations.

The net negative lifelong masking drastically outweighs net positive societal scale.  ensure unvaccinated wear mask? Vaccine passports clearly aren’t going work. population 500 million though... That’s similar ratio nurses doctors per capita province. Pharmacists less 10% vaccinations here. Same. got first shot 5 days ago oldest freshman university Florida, said people giving crap got vaccinated. ridiculous. I'm glad still it, though. Way smaller Oregon, anyone 15 older authorize medical procedures, especially vaccines. long someone age group get clinic doctor, parents can't stop them.

Douglas MacArthur [Watch: conversation COVID-19 vaccine Pfizer CEO says boosters might necessary quoted article. Pfizer managed turn ""worst"" kind vaccine ""best vaccine"" economies scale attitude. people lost plot.

By accepting like this, reason allowed. say control even directly influence reality tacit support. younger may may adjust dosage level, younger somewhat different immune respons? That’s good, longer takes vaccination rates world wide, bigger chance variant come be. studied all?

Do still get immune response/antibodies whatnot? One things I've telling make feel better New Jersey relaxing mask mandate much would visibly change anyway. People consistently wearing masks parks sidewalk ages now.

So 0.09% group legally permitted vaccinated vaccinated? fully believe parents 11.75 year old kids willing fudge numbers get shot, presumably they'd giving fake birthdate know they'd end age range. Perhaps trial participants get included group? think almost certainly true people suffering post viral syndromes well anxiety induced pandemic causing symptoms infection. said elsewhere, number Americans getting vaccinated per day gone around .2%, whereas Canadians around 1% Maybe stupid? What’s us vaccinated supposed accomplish here? right release HIPAA info best interest public

No don't. can't tell everyone person AIDS, instance. Even though would everyone else's 'best interest' reduce infections. case, would monster lists people communicable diseases easily available. fine cheap therapeutics readily available, demonized sake profit?

Or trying tell industries agencies “systemic” issues?  would imagine might take small amount time business get back staffing levels handle crowds. would imagine week two, start seeing lot clubs music venues opening back up. Yes is. data - hipaa. social - PII. credit card - PCI. America decade behind rest world comes personal data rights it.

No one going fight privacy much - important private data aware it. think might time spend less energy people doing

Cute zingers aside, there's degrees make sense.

Examples:

My neighbors decide fight cuss/swear loudly, possibly little kid house? really something fixate on.

Hikers littering Mount Everest? Bad, probably something fixate on.

Other examples:

People paying taxes, means city can't afford basic public services? Something definitely spend energy on, concerned citizen.

People defrauding COVID relief funds? Something focus on, absolutely.

CDC opening door people openly lie vaccinated, mingle indoors outdoors without wearing mask? Something definitely ""spend energy on"".

The ""eyyyyy, worry brah, live life"" works fine, assume people actively impacting others selfish harmful.

With said, agree: vaccines hugely impactful masks ever were. I'm happy stop wearing mask, science points direction. time I'm wary people abusing development, people act selfishly.  numbers likely reported US too. since summer’s coming also got vacations, means theme parks, hotels, restaurants, etc. imagine typical family outing parents don’t masks kids don’t either. It’ll probably crazy time kids guess we’ll really see effective Covid kids months months people said kids always safe. could say respect privacy. Scoff thought telling everyone ready show vaccine card. masks gone, masks on. Obviously children vaccinated less half population is. limited guidelines private gatherings. really good headline. I'm scientist, measurable increase UK cases yet even though they're ridiculously low baseline. health professionals work learn everything variant, coming strongly worded, negative statements like conclusions drawn really bad morale nation particularly hard hit pandemic. week like post number American deaths include percentage global pandemic deaths figure ( 17% 4% world population ). percentage gone slightly Indian tragedy started. bad is. booster day keeps doctor away. Africa's population masses far apart comparison India. think lot people grasp large diverse Africa is. Same. irony cautious whole pandemic. waiting two weeks second shot full effect. going living life got sick within 2 days lmao. Back couch smh. can't extrapolate number like though. Population density also lower villages would decrease infections.

I agree though official numbers even scratch surface. 4, left car. Still machine gun penetrate bulletproof armor. Thank you! curious anyone insight happening rest world carnage. bet skateboard popcorn kid making bank. live Cambridge area, masking become bit obsession people last year. Anti-maskers really thing, widespread protests, people mostly followed mandate (100% masking time left home), LOUD annoying core group people spent pandemic looking windows, yelling people wearing masks street, calling cops people picnicking parks, generally harassing anyone even pulled mask momentarily even one around. DEFINITELY one-sided issue around here. 

I ditched mask outside minute outdoor mandate removed, deal MANY aggressive Karens trying put 2 cents in. response loud, forceful ""SHUT F*CK UP.""

I'm going tell take mask choose wear one post-mandate, that's decision free make it. Similarly, keep opinion choosing ditch mask areas required yourself. really want hear opinion subject. non-mRNA vaccines equal. 

Sinovac inactivated coronavirus. 

Johnson Johnson AZ adenoviral vectors. 

It looks like Sinovac working well, others fine (aside thrombosis complications). 

Another possibility smaller nations issues keeping doses cold transit/storage, would make less effective. Feel there. wife got kicked US year ago today, havent able spend real time together since.

It's good compromise, one offend either side. states still requiring masks schools transportation anyway. Especially us states. guess answer fellow Americans still getting shots would continue cautious safe stuff public everyone’s essentially dropping guard. lot people fully vaccinated, since CDC pretty much gave everyone green light rip mask outdoors indoors it’s really dicey situation. way make un-dicey would get fully vaccinated eliminate worry.

I believe main concern right still group can’t vaccinated, kids. assume get data new variant deals children love free behavior even pandemic. Vacations holidays probably big superspreader events kids school shutdown summer. I’m guessing fall shots ready won’t surprised schools wait shots available maybe even administer themselves. can't find original article ... even peer reviewed published article?  Yeah get yelled/beat/killed it. Yeah that's reasonable. friend going wearing masks meeting today even though fully vaccinated. 

The celebrations pandemic ends assume roaring 20s like. 

My friend got Pfizer fine. Moderna cause sore arm shots. using different sense ""transmissibility"" Brits doing. See video previous comment. think thing really got visited Mumbai seeing many people passed Victoria Station every day. 3 million people every day building built 130 years ago. unreal many people small space that's Mumbai. Everywhere went india crazy crowded. really skeptical findings, freezer keeps percent stable fridge within stated time period, freezer would better solution situations. 
It's good news anyway. sensible thing do. less effective vaccinate people Europe majority already vaccinated. Spreading already incredibly low. Meanwhile another country 10% vaccinated virus still running wild. 

Meaning mutations meaning possibility vaccine resistant version popping spreads we're back started. work public place gets 800k visitors per year. strict masking social distancing protocols reduced capacity testing/quarantine policies staff.

All us worked pandemic amazing year free usual crud visitors pass us. colds, flu, norovirus, pneumonia, pinkeye. Staff covid infection rate far, far lower local general population rate. 

We can’t make visitors wear masks wash freaking hands forever, one probably wear mask next winter work public try ward visitor plagues. Plus makes breathing easier outside winter. actively keeping news week due personal problems thought India might getting better. long go right? no, worse worse. Well, name, they've sure done god-awful job controlling virus. Pick one. 

1. Following science. 

2. Making political decisions intent shape world way want. 

Both place world, year public health officials said first one. 

Point being, i'm fine public health officials, long acknowledge public health decisions always based scientific truths. seem conflated two. Yeah, Oregon's one notoriously strict responses. However vaccination passport needed safely remove mask mandate live that, I'm fully vaccinated.  submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

""The problem argument there’s little evidence lockdowns damaged local economies individual behavior would happened anyway, lockdowns not. much evidence lifting lockdowns produced faster recovery.""

This point Barrington Memo authors (IMHO) willfully ignored. risk zero it’s still spreading plus variants make spread unvaccinated people. 

But want risk spreading look like anti-masker go ahead I’m sure certainly won’t instill compassion Reddit thread.  Define surge 

I don’t think ever getting eradicated, certainly seasonal 

But think annual boosters always ~50% vaccinated, seems magic number uk much secular usa. That's piece puzzle.

The uk gives appointments. instead people uk sign them, uptake would lower, account lazy fence sitters. That's well loved national healthcare system get you.

Uk essentially opt practice. Usa opt in. Thanks contributing. sure take MasterCard though. He's saying ""a little bit longer"".

Betting drops memorial day, pressure insanely high so.  Why? you’re vaccinated makes negligible difference. posted data yes, early April timeframe said regards deaths related policy decision March. data exist vacuum relevant timeframe look regards this. Fact is, lowering deaths stall April showed compared preceding months. Obviously meant timeframe takes contract, incubate, die disease relation changes policy would take place. understand makes extremely foolish takes anyone else reads fool. Pretending take people extremely literally online petty game.

There misinformation said. factually accurate. meant earlier claims. vaccine unvaccinated people. point, getting vaccinated won’t allow return normal point getting vaccine? Vaccinated people still get Covid-19! That's whole point herd immunity. people get Vaccinated less likely people get Covid-19, including Vaccinated vaccines 100%. Pfizer Miderna need 65% Vaccinated reach herd immunity. They’re right - they’re low risk everyone around they’re vaccinated. [One dose Pfizer Moderna vaccines 80% effective preventing Covid CDC study health yet keeps popping Africa, killing thousands people - that's entire world chips help them.

Because things hard avoid around people otherwise seem fine (until point late). Ebola kind thing caused scream ""I EBOLA!!!"" moment became infectious it, it'd lot easier stop lot easier lock up/avoid &amp; spot problem chance spread someone else. crazy-zombie virus exact thing, giant ""I'M INFECTED!!!"" sign lot easier contain brings notice LOT more. 

Keep mind part Covid also able spread entirely people take seriously first. pretty hard take virus makes scream ""I INFECTED!!!"" seriously, one kills quickly. September 2022, nearly three years mysterious virus began sweeping China. United States, kids ages, newly vaccinated Covid-19, back school, parents back work. pockets country, especially vaccine hesitancy lingers, Covid still surges, shutting schools workplaces many people call sick. Around world, vaccine rollout painfully slow, particularly poorer countries richer ones hoard vaccine patents. inequality allows virus move largely unchecked across globe, mutating vaccines become less effective everyone needs boosters, anxiously monitor new variants. Meanwhile, countless people still battle debilitating symptoms long Covid every day, even among mild asymptomatic cases. Covid-19 remains serious threat, rather painful memory.  likely scenario continue current path

This ""likely"" author says so. provide literally support outside saying ""this likely"". may work better updates kind spotty. Big true, articles come like time never hear question good one tracked. tracking data since April 2020 basically. article vaccinations much counting hospitalized children course pandemic tested positive. distinguished data tell child (or adult) hospitalized Covid covid. child hospitalized stomach problem upon admittance tested tests positive covid, counted covid hospitalized child. Even covid symptoms. data gets rolled up, gets lost look overall severity children due covid...you really can't skewed, article particular hospital inflated 40%. fault own, state CDCs fault reported.

Your question similar know vaccinated people test positive symptoms know many vaccinated people testing positive hospital, may zero symptoms counted anyway far know tracking positive people vaccinated. I'm sure tracked seen it. talking 'normalizing masks'. sound like kids' access vaccinations since insinuated wanting around forever. *couldn’t* care less. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

That’s guidance says. It’s says:

1. Vaccinated people safe wear masks. say ditch them. That’s you, businesses, local leaders. 

2. Everyone needs continue wear masks mass transit, hospitals, prisons, homeless shelters, schools. 

3. importantly, unvaccinated need continue wear masks. extended first wave started August died latep 2020 starting months 2021. communities medical care, oxygen, poor sanitation, etc 1% much higher.  Buddy, promise decaffeinated brands taste good real thing. Like repeatedly over-promising life-saving vaccine, repeatedly under-delivering, repeatedly allowing sorts political fallout happen without ever holding hand admitting failed corporation taking responsibility that? respond post, US world governments invest massive standby capacity mRNA vaccines (including dependent supply chain inputs). would probably cost $2-3B year maintain standby capacity could produce 500M+ vaccines per month. maintain guardrail production certification FDA also short circuits another element approval process (manufacturing quality testing review).

Yeah, like shit SC lot things, they've kept testing free easily available surrounding states. mention colleges like Clemson requiring everyone stepping foot campus get tested weekly. Yes don’t get logic people waiting get kids back school there’s may month left least it’s USA. know states go way till June seriously would damn waste time. one thing going partially increasing days doesn’t seem case places. 13-year-old already first dose! handled pandemic well I'm excited able get house! Lol not. stay home immunocompromised get vaccine. ""Advocate health, think something wrong probably is"" advice great advice people, hypochondriacs. good advocate hypochondria could spend forever running around medical system, chasing somatic symptoms baseless fears.

And never, ever google symptoms. I'm shocked Americans complain wear simple mask protect others people fully vaccinated pandemic. taxes gonna paid? made curious even verify age group. 14 year old son Kroger pharmacy. verify anything. glad see rules child care camps. huge patchwork consistency good. I’m particularly glad requiring masks, since children vaccinated yet. Definitely. Plus you’re starting get quite social around age stops spread even little more, US going get it. 

Very exciting overall. hospitalizations deaths trial though either vaccine placebo groups reason concerned vaccine might prevent serious consequences infection. persuading people get vaccinated told original one found ineffective research would difficult.

Also keeping vaccinated people transmitting important too. especially true country like South Africa doesn’t money get bulk population vaccinated anytime soon needing keep extra NPIs place meantime hard people.  sad reality 1 child's death equal 100 elderly deaths eyes public

You say like unreasonable - terms years life lost, 1 year old child dying losing around 77 years life (assuming average life expectancy 78 years), 70 year old dying losing 7 years life. sad tragic, unreasonable consider child dying bigger tragedy. Kids likely vaccinated sept. incoming athletes staff. Olympic terms *require* sizeable number medical staff **dedicated solely** Olympics duration event. want pandemic. get there! test general efficacy AZ vaccine 25%, astronomically lower ~65% minimum I've seen elsewhere.

I think study tests AZ vaccine B.1.351. massive effort individuals.

Yes was. every individual wants vaccine get vaccine. wore mask got vaccinated. expect make sacrifices people refusing get program, that's free society works. Nope. COVID killed 295 people 17 US far. Flu killed much people 2019-2020. one would anything COVID deadly everyone kids. I’m 14 I’m getting vaccine today dad worried there’s bad effects kids age something true? Death counts slowly falling well. also lag behind case counts, continue trend right direction well. Vaccines effective variants, argument moot. people vaccinated ones want vaccinated haven’t either eligible not. Let individuals make decisions. Removing mandates lends credibility case need implemented. would like state 2k consistently... Thanks making feel little bit like I’m crazytown. I’m hoping people real world aren’t self-centered masks another months kids vaccinated herd immunity gets large boost. Yeah extreme messaging ""zero risk"" going around. Folks anti lockdown realize way get back reopening taking precautions mitigate risk, rejecting risk. Nah man, CDC said ditch mask made tear up. many feels comment. clearly dont see losing business, wages, lead total destruction someones life, 2000$ month may great teenager 20s year old. wont pay mortgage feed family.  


I grieve families lost someone pandemic, enough sacrifice altar covid safety. Colbert mentioned something last week eventually making return Ed Sullivan Theatre passing. think said something later summer? I'm totally positive that. 

If guess, Fallon's going first - watch show, watch Seth Meyers DVR always gets last minutes Fallon. He's fully back studio, suit, seems least kind actual audience back place, even though full capacity. cdc merely said safe vaccinated wear masks. Local business authorities decide require acknowledge fine require them. explicit words wanted give guidance individual level societal mandates outside scope. 

The cdc said unvaccinated need wear masks. local authorities decide require masks everyone ensure unvaccinated do, would best way follow cdc guidelines. Source preventing infections? seen that, statement 70-75% effective ""vaccines effective"". since there's real world data yet, can't know effects transmission?

I still hold overall given nuance blanket statements. Maybe risk you, maybe someone risk factors may respond strongly vaccine. able judge level risk matters here. Honest question, taking long? children biologically different adults? millions data points adults point incredibly low risk problems children? child studies along given large body data already adults? whatever small risk danger side effects serious known outcome deadly disease continue spreading via children? Lol, ok. resort name calling, going another level.

I'm going sink it.

Just kid interested science medicine mean others aren't.

Additionally, simplify explanations mean others constantly talking things.

I conversations kid virus, vaccines, etc early pandemic.

He knows vaccines.

He asks week get his.

You acting people constantly shoving things pandemic kids faces. honestly make sense trying say.

If explaining child vaccines work, virus works, child disservice. Children taught world works. require ""constantly talking things"".

The implication reason 7 year old would talk lot getting vaccine parents thing preposterous. Same. Mine turns 12 week school starts. Would great fully vaccinated school. kid literally 15 vaccines running right now.

IMO.. making sure stomp worth extra time.

you want trade COVID pertussis. shipped vaccines United States? *one* country called didn’t receive vaccines India, lol. many family hurt lost loved one?

Yes, many businesses Canada hard Canada rich country spending lot citizens, US. country could recover economically could replace lives lost. Exactly!! address people lie wear mask infect child! Orange county well hundred anti vax protestors successfully picketed county supervisors got taken down. Similar situations played counties governed Republicans.

The problem vaccine verification US technology logistics politics. 12 year old same. jumped air pure joy yelled ""Yes!"". teared happy made him. risk averse, like gambling, piece mind greatly reducing risk even though lower begin idea appeals me.

The idea case appeals me, idea move COVID-19 back mind keep front center appeals me.

At end day brains wired differently different good thing. believe read Pfizer set September target seek approval 5-11. made hopeful kids vaccinated Thanksgiving.

I believe Fauci saying late 2021 – early 2022 I'm hoping conservative expectations. targeting mid- late-summer 12-15 happening May. We'll include small note vial telling body's immune system strong response.  Even June Texas couldn’t get tested unless hospitalized basically... hit full immunity second couple weeks ago. work dropped mask requirements mandate gone anyone wants vaccinated be. went vaccinated friends house everyone hugged eachother first time year. 

Go get shot! We're beating awful disease. Indeed presumptuous. 7 year old daughter. plenty hopes dreams, much bigger getting vaccine shot (of she’s several previously).

She asks time “sickness” end. knows spit tube could travel state, tested positive COVID, never felt sick. knows took different test, antibodies, makes unlikely ever get COVID.

If think 7 year olds independently researching, synthesizing making independent decisions medical care, fact one delusional. There's going **lot** push-back nationalized system. Shit, third states even comply, blame them. I'm definitely doubting vaccines help known variants. think pretty good sense that. difference between, say 95% 66%. 

One lowers risk (all else equal) **compared unvaccinated person** 1/20th, 1/3rd. still great, mind you, big difference. said we'd lucky vaccine approved 2022. unless we’re fine unvaccinated dropping masks too, would break cdc advice

Do honestly believe doctors CDC assume people would lie getting vaccinated? every chart, graph, spreadsheet statistic need. fully aware outcome announcement.

And say wrong....the mask mandate gone week cases lowest  oldest turns 12 October. Right race turning 12 eligible shot, &lt; 12 shot approved. estimates vary that, months back 12-15 shot expected September - December, are. ""scaring"" people, saying may need booster?

People already scared COVID 'normal' things even though they're fully vaccinated. idea vaccine wear point probably going stoke paranoia even further. everyone getting vaccinated purely anti-Vaxxer. like majority people get flu shot, see worth time effort, believe vaccines. Cool, we'll order online. I'm vaccinated, I'm pro-vaccine, I'm forced medical treatment forced medical disclosure. are, people are, welcome 1984, guess. +2 2nd doses mom 5min ago  percent US population fully/partially vaccinated? fine wanting go back office. may people pushing extend lockdown (and thus work home) due baseless concerns safety. Yeah trying book PCR next week Walgreens looks like 3 days advance? wait next week think.

No yet! Looking something weekend might suggest GF 😂 love GOP ""let locals decide themselves!"", locals want something GOP like. becomes ""You must tell you"" pretty quick. Superb know, thanks!  Absolutely correct. many cases hospitalizations deaths vaccinated people recent huge wave Poland. Much less unvaccinated population course. HEART GOES WISCONSINITES!!!! think unrealistic get rid influenza virus virus hosted many animals. vaccinated subject anything. whatever want (mask mask matter)

the subject deadly virus runs within unvaccinated children 12. maskless unvaccinated seriously harm unvaccinated children MUST wear mask run get vaccinated

simple that

I approve proof vaccination : absolutely Good man, enjoy! observation PCR thing mainly personal cost. I'm heading Aug fingers crossed. ya make Hoagie Princeton yet? Serious question - used commute work work 100% home? way I'm getting booster. recovered COVID like mild cold. second shot much worse. felt sick years. Yes, personally think something nationalized system far effective option, unlikely happen given Biden's public statements general ""slippery slope"" fear segments. Stop spamming So, 70% 16+ vaccinated. Okay, guess. Probably unnecessary weeks. said 10k day. listening science. CDC guidance told I'm vaccinated, wear mask.

Why acting like that's case? regional director spoke specifically region Europe? that's live, follow guidance. Stop spamming link Quote stood -

Nearly 1 10 children ages 12 15 started vaccinations -- amazing figure consider vaccinations began week ago require parent’s permission. Maybe they’re bringing adults them, saw big increases percentages adults getting vaccine, too.

Also meant Regimen lol damn phone Yes, white people likely vaccinated blacks Hispanics. essentially business open social distancing New York long show proof vax, start seeing clubs small music venues like Mercury Lounge open? mean, would open weekend. miss shows. would great last year well Durant torn achilles tendon Sahin, 55-year-old chief executive BioNTech, German company designed Pfizer vaccine, said also wait turn.

I'm pretty sure Sahin got vaccine long time ago. Almost 40% population vaccinated might one important persons Germany right now, along Tureci, employees, many people work make BioNTech vaccine production possible huge scale.

I mean, offering vaccine national treasure like Sahin first possible moment criminal. Maybe wanted wait long-term care facility residents employees get shots. Okay. Fine.

I might lucky really think keeping hydrated helped, give shot day Vac.

2..More...Weeks! :) mean... Saudi Arabia absolute monarchy, alot easier (for better worse) get things done quickly without regard people. Multiple states ended additional unemployment benefits. I’m sure many returning don’t want to. wish parents would let get vaccinated smh Exactly. They’re dividing us two classes health care workers get rights normal person. Sure, death bad thing come Covid kids. think prior corona virus allowed wear clothing covers face schools. fully vaccinated yes, take mask.

I stopped wearing mask past friday, unless required private venue I'm in, admittedly feel awkward weird first. I'd get dirty looks masked people campus work at. last long. days later feel perfectly normal wearing mask anymore, number dirty looks dropped significantly.

If I'm going work closely someone feel uncomfortable ask put mask, will. far happened.

I've worn mask twice briefly since then, McDonalds still requires mask (they plan stop end month) local bike shop, deal.

You'll okay, kids okay since vaccinated. Hopefully get shot soon mess put behind you. Steroids? known lower immune response treat viruses? Jesus. Hey feel way too! 

I going continue wear mask case counts state less 100/day. One things studies fail test ethical exposing high viral load unmask vaccinated person. work people time many hours. unvaccinated. think wise test this. continue wearing mask coworkers get vaccinated and/or community spread virus low. mask simple effective.

I say that. said people fear mongering variants ones breakthrough.

Booster shots likely way evolving protection virus evolves.

It's big enough concern justify wearing mask top vaccination right now. Get double vaccinated?   You’ve misunderstood statistics.

This saying, situation would otherwise caught Covid showed symptoms, you’re 85-90% less likely that. ""not yet published peer-reviewed journal""

but hopeful!  What’s next, guy unmarked van handing candy vaccinated 12 year olds?   Nothing went wrong BBC , probably one best jobs world handling COVID, rates lowest , far cry UK US done themselves.

Singapore slightly fewer cases last week St. Louis (city), MO, USA had. Singapore also EIGHTEEN TIMES population St. Louis. we're thinking numbers big improvement.

You absolutely right. case countries things ""wrong"", somehow perfect.   gave solution. week ago. Keep masks September.

Unfortunately since singular reliable source data published compiled piecing together reports analyst Axios, Airfinity, Bridge consulting Beijing well FT, Hindustan times, Reuters, USnews, etc investor releases.  May frequently updated one place, sources linked below. Covid cases continuing drop 1,000 day even mask mandates dropping. Maybe mask mandates would increase drop bit frankly see reason keep unless people specifically going around unvaccinated people. point everyone 12 wants vaccine get one (assuming parental approval minors) certain point don’t think justify mandating everyone wear mask protect anti vaxxers. video include Sinopharm (or Sinovac matter) explain Seychelles (or Chile, Bahrain, UAE) seeing spike cases despite way population vaccinated US.

And lesson video ""efficacy matter"", ""efficacy rates directly comparable"", different thing. CDC told avoid that’s Guillain Barre years ago case GBS JnJ agree. points article seem genuine way article slanted makes political hatchet job.

The issue though pretty obvious. one major group ditches masks, others well ""who's know?"". Stark truth consequences damned, shade truth save lives. know answer. 1.5 billion doses vaccines administered far 400 million AZ. 


The AZ vaccine remains massive key contributor overall global effort fight covid one vaccine ever going vaccinate world. thought take masks yesterdays good masks give physical presence protection vaccine hope working. trust CDC say unvaccinated need masked up. need find way make happen. can’t pick choose believe them.

I don’t wear mask now. Like don’t big germ fear it’s almost like one makes feel...unsafe? don’t like It. Hopefully fades. People like masks make feel safe see people wearing them, science doesn’t care feelings. Masks don’t work own, unless everyone using n95s. helped slightly decrease spread, used alongside social distancing. helped enough keep hospitals overwhelmed. ever *prevent* spread covid. know does? Vaccines. Vaccines significantly effective masks. Even don’t believe fully understand clinical trials, see trend cases falling vaccinations increase. EU splitting Pfizer production ~50% ~50% world since beginning. US using Pfizer production 100% recently even so, still vastly itself. 

So talking about? feel he's forgotten context time. said science works slowly, esp. medical science, plain truth. takes time test, wait results, gather analyze results. multiple variants time studies still coming effectiveness vaccines variants. That’s biggest issue it. benefit creating blanket rule across state?  think common attitude Northeast next months.

I bet gets hot people going give wearing them. 6 year old. wears like champ, tired too. May 24, Lyft Uber offering free rides vaccine sites could book one then. might also want try local pharmacies like Walgreens CVS, tend sites closest residential areas. book appointments websites.  feel boosters probably depends experience like vaccine side effects. experience bad all, boosters scare me. purpose HIPAA set clear limits definitions health care provider may share individual's private health history parties. *not* exist limit you, individual, disclose parties.

Required proof vaccinations new thing. thing decades multiple arenas widespread immigration (yellow fever) education (preschool). unprecedented all. I'd really like see data many mask wearers think way. could tiny handful assholes Twitter see becoming increasingly popular talking point. would like get little ones vaccinated prior schools starting back up.

America donated ""five times"" country, Biden Japanese great problem solvers. I'm fairly positive easy solution would taken it. Vaccine hesitancy large problem Japan, law prevents mandatory vaccinations. law stems incidents 90s MMR vaccines used back Japan outbreak meningitis. Wait, thought one wanted work anymore... I'll assume that's legitimate question. Vaccinated people still get Covid usually mild infection even know it. Hospitalizations rare deaths practically unknown.

If carry light virus concentration probably can't spread -- least easily. even spread it, infected person probably receive light dose typically better outcomes receiving heavy dose.

Vaccines perfect still great overall value recipients people around them. C'mon Canada! Let's get going too! Publishing someone's home address identifying information intention others finding harassing them. would make much sense area (Belgium). Doxxing,I think personal. Directed towards individual, company. hospitals far overwhelmed. goal long since accomplished.

Which, though everyone neglects remember, basically original goal mask wearing social distancing.

The data shows safe make change, time stop moving goal posts.

And want get undecided people vaccinate, need see getting vaccinated actually going result sort benefit towards covid restrictions. agree. really want PR guy foremost expert country people?

That seems like would lead Barr’s “summary” times.

This rocket science. Typically, [half needle COVID [5/8"" one flu shot.

So smaller needle.

Anecdotally, tell hardly felt people say same. there's ever another pandemic lots Iowans going die honestly terrified needles...

That never goes away lol. I'm several decades older ""I'm going look, please please give shot"". Definitely worth it, even though drive way far get it.

And happy early birthday! Hopefully nearly normal summer thanks this. constraint longer supply, demand Nothing happen, vaccines. best, antibody cell response lasting good. likely, results marginally better regular set shots. anyone know kids year eligible vaccine? baby coming September wondering when/if eligible. hope gets soon completely vaccine-evading. could strains vaccines quite bit less effective. fact, already strains vaccines 20% less effective. \*\*fridge door opens\*\*

What have? Let's see...soda, purple stuff, Pfizer vaccine, **Sunny D**!! Thank voice reason.

“We’ve lowered covid death rate flu levels now!”
Ok, means twice many people dying respiratory illness normal now, that’s ok? go anywhere outdoors without ID, can't drive car go bar without one. would essentially classify every building bar. fault vaccinated people. happy prove vaccinated status, accept punishment due actions others cannot control. Young people always small risk dying Covid. cases spike hospital hadn’t previously seen young person die may end seeing happen several times. isn’t virus got dangerous, it’s happens roll dice often. also doesn’t help young people ones infected often jobs place around others, socialize more, less likely vaccinated, don’t always care protect article describes.

The 1918 flu different situation young adults killed disproportionately age groups it’s interesting hear reason stronger immune responses. don’t think applies Covid though world young people much lower probability dying become infected older person would (lower doesn’t mean zero though especially underlying conditions probably government could better job communicating). 8 year old terrified needles ready first line age group gets approved. social tired cooped house. We've keep home higher risk factor (she KD 4). it’s not. Covid extremely contagious. come September kids able vaccinated seriously boost herd immunity. hold months. article, sounds like:

1) COVID-19

2) Local mask mandates still happen decision must made local authority, school board president.

Still seem like good idea Elementary aged kids vaccinated fall make blanket ban. also learning long term problems Covid infection? opinion it’s one eventually. There's harm whatsoever. ask acting like people didn’t exist covid. immune compromised cancer patients concerned know need keep safe they’ve covid even thing. 

You’re acting like covid virus danger people, it’s weird. India shot foot regarding vaccine production rollout. far underestimated many they'd need hit hard first. Now, well, are, vaccines available. obviously going risk pandemic vacation. needed anyone able get plane. Knowing vaccination rate mind people wearing masks, likely keep mine cases go low levels (still pretty high am).

However wish people continued use masks visibly sick like coughing constantly. would really help drop flu like illnesses future simple action. antibody test, count high chill, not, get booster another vaccine change things give immune system “new perspective” virus. Btw inactivated whole virus vaccine would choice here, give body full picture, say virus entered Europe south, guess Northern Europe time react get hospitals ready, IIRC Sweden also closed border stage.. 

In Scandinavia oldest generation live children grand children, able isolate. Allegedly saved lives.

In general Scandinavians used less bodily contact, perhaps lead lower transmission rate. 

I know much helped Sweden rich country Scandinavians generally like follow rules trust authorities.

But compare Sweden Nordic countries Norway, Denmark, Finland Iceland, Sweden still covid cases. It’s binary issue. It’s risk risk. I’m aware it’s unlikely completely eradicated. spreads greater risk variants, period. cold flu virus mutate strain current vaccine effective

I ton research last night argue anti-vaxxer trying argue one get vaccine COVID-19 mutate. shown true COVID-19 far. Even negative results shown COVID-19 mutates half fast flu, COVID-19 vaccines shown issue relating good reading it. don’t really get us either. word? Yes.

Sadly, CDC currently entity strongly influenced politics (from parties, general sense). refuted mask use entirely early based worries shortages hospital PPE panics. hastily backpedaled admitted mask better mask videos went viral (the pun unintentional). made poor decisions 1980s AIDS epidemic led excessive infections/deaths due refusal screen donors &amp; blood supply.

This say they're 100% useless. actually good messaging many health issues issues settled. Let’s keep monoclonals going! Could care less...if feel putting rubber chicken head wards ""bad air"" it. Point necessary reeks paranoia. Society full paranoid individuals good thing. awesome this, thank service! smart idea. don’t get thinking this. keep increasing danger levels bit bit there’s point probably increase safety measures well. Covid extremely contagious high risk hospitalizations death. 

And importantly, hard wear masks? least kids vaccinated September. blame Belgium? government. 

Joke apart people “elected” list minimised worse pandemic. Belgium, yes death rate high wave 1 2 (actually wave 3 “very good” thing), besides stupid comments everyone made Feb 2020 least tried fix it. case 5 people elected article. 

Also, comparing death toll, parameters need taken account, including excess mortality (compared covid mortality), density country, population age etc…

Many countries report part covid deaths. E.g. uk time limit person able die covid, india probably doesn’t know half more, etc etc etc. said what. explained complex word original response meant, clearly applies OP. said looked Urban Dictionary. mostly Pfizer right? least read three awesome people! Anyone know needle sizes Pfizer Moderna? Compared seasonal flu vaccine.  OMGosh, wrong! Thank u/analognewb! case careful, find well fitting n95 mask absolutely leave stick delivery curbside pickup don't. rest world going stop living small portion population risk.

What people covid flu seasons? grumpy? i'm asking question. Look link provided NIH. studies referenced. speculation. antibody activity reduction less B.1.1.7. efficacy likely somewhere 75%-95% range. I'll happily trade long covid anyone want get vaccinated! 

Well really. wish illness worst enemy. I'm voting Democrat next 40 years. end day, got vaccinated, worked! employers ask, OSHA limits provider disclosure allowance, HIPAA say anything individual’s right withhold disclosing information privacy? exceptions, Barrett’s latest religious exemption take get apply it? Eric Ding absolute shambles. Needles skin fascinating - love look. Every time give blood, think ""look thing arm drawing lots blood me"" kind laugh/smile it. sure others think lol people trying protect still allowed protect themselves. can't tell obtuse purpose actually stupid.  Sure, random Brazilian hop plane without negative PCR Test residence proof infect 30% neighboring country... much ""follow science"" lmao say know. lab study looked well neutralizing antibodies (extracted blood vaccine recipients) bind various variants. found antibody activity Indian variants reduced, still high. That’s fault. Us wearing masks children isn’t gonna result getting sick. 

Wearing masks won’t help that’s gonna undo mask ban. would vaguely ballpark annual flu shot available. previously GBS may receive COVID-19 vaccine. kids need vaccine? thought science indicated they're safe. still spread it, right? Even vaccinated, might want wear mask protect others, like partner, family friends may vaccinated yet protection mask stacks vaccines though. Well technically, cigarettes tested while. actually mention anything considering results... many die? many get infected? infected people perfectly healthy immune problems? 

Without infos article uselss. Looks like Team Variant's blasting agaaaaaaaaiiiiiinnnnnnnnnn! Got mine 2 days back. Damn vaccine kicked butt 48 hours.  
But good. Forced friends get shots too.  


Your message give confidence boost :) That’s never gonna happen unfortunately.￼ said?

lemme repeat said: **maskless eligible unvaccinated seriously harm every unvaccinated children 12.** could absolutely see  That’s doubtful. Nobody credible ever said hcq cure understanding reality. mask mandate affects vaccinated unvaccinated people. live bubble. live society different people. Various states passing laws banning mask mandates everywhere, INCLUDING SCHOOLS nobody vaccinated except staff. felt vaguely nauseated unlike really nauseated felt better eat weird. Day 2 rough crashed hard night felt million times better morning. Hopefully same. complaining mask mandates they've lifted? amazing younger generation stronger understanding science medical technology older, ""more intelligent"" generation  restrictions don’t apply cross-border trade, US citizens lawful permanent residents, well people traveling medical purposes attend school, among others.

Doesn’t seem much beyond suggestion"
