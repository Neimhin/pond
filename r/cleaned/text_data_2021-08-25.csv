Without devices, entire teams could forced quarantine player coach tested positive.

The monitors use sensors track person's distance another person wearing device, well long around other. **The devices, district paid grant, worn players field**.

The school said parents notified devices invited meeting get information. Parents sign consent forms allow children wear them, school said.

Some parents lashed school, saying devices invasion.

Wouldn‚Äôt make sense schedule certain amount vaccinations per day they‚Äôre busy? don‚Äôt see waiting another two months would better solution, see many people asking shot causing retail pharmacies collapse. possible would collapsed initial rollout call fifty places find opening get vaccine. Dad ICU 3 weeks, rehab 3 weeks, bill approximately 1 MILLION dollars ICU half million rehab. honestly tried stick 20% bill would 300,000, legalese dropped nothing since full Medicare secondary insurance, tried really freaking hard it.

Group B: 200 daily Covid deaths FL.

If someone going group Covid came along put group B can‚Äôt count twice.

""Spanish Flu"" never went away, became less deadly, contagious know seasonal flu variant vaccine still works well variants comes hospitalizations deaths,

I agree this. hold reduce transmission well, meaning people willing mask distance years 

You'll continue massive outbreaks twice thrice every year. outbreaks might getting less less deadly, smaller mortality percentages big case counts (because unchecked transmission masks) still lead large numbers deaths. serious push begin naming new strains republican politicians pushing antimask antivax agendas.

The reliable way think really combat phenomenon give audience another info source consistently least kind-of trust, even they‚Äôre inclined believe wild theories, they‚Äôre quite all-in.

How build/restore trust is, say, million dollar question. someone ought teach schills coordinate better. disease outbreak genuinely seemed apocalyptic, one caused bacterium *Yersinia Pestis*?

And yet clearly survived apocalypse, since today. Yup. check box group listed conditions qualify booster , never actually asked proof addressed verbally (this Walgreens walk in). show vaccine card ID requested, added third shot onto card.

The state doubt paying nose workers, they're going able keep indefinitely. Sure, sure. likely less 40% (though at-risk vaccinated point, number probably higher think). hand, mortuary business usually runs steady rate probably can't quickly increase capacity meet huge demand shock 20% 30%. likely ""strategic"" leak, softening ground official announcement

Delta doesn‚Äôt make money employee‚Äôs health insurance premiums. 

Insurance company goes Delta says ‚Äúwe insure employees rate. coverage‚Ä¶ yada yada yada‚Äù

If Delta agrees, enter contract sorts (policy) insurance company (usually year). ACA mandates employer contribute least 50% cost base plan employee only. Let‚Äôs say premium $100/month. 

What means employee Joe pays $50 Delta pays $50 per month INSURANCE COMPANY A, coverage. money going Delta. Delta takes Joe‚Äôs paycheck pays insurance company (along $50 portion) Joe‚Äôs convenience. 

Once next policy year starts, insurance company raise rates based claims preceding year. (If lot claims insurance company paid claims premiums collected, lost money. make loss, raise employee‚Äôs rates next year.) Delta doesn‚Äôt raise rates, insurance company does. Delta CAN, however, lower much helping Joe pay premiums, long they‚Äôre paying 50% employee base plan cost. 

Delta self-insured, whole different thing, name misleading. Self insured doesn‚Äôt mean delta insures it‚Äôs employees. still work insurance company. 

Self insured basically means Delta makes deal insurance company A. say ‚Äúwhat Delta covers first $50,000 claims‚Äù insurance company says ‚Äúgreat! Since lowered risk $50,000, we‚Äôll charge less premium every month employees‚Äù.

If Delta‚Äôs employee‚Äôs claims year come $1,000,000, Delta pays $50k insurance company pays $950,000 claims. 

Delta employee Joe win premiums went down. Since Delta Joe splitting premiums, monthly costs went down. 

However, Delta essentially making bet either monthly premium savings across employees total $50,000 LOT claims totaling much $50,000. 

I know long, hope helped anyone made far better understand. really class public school this. [Corona Delta love well handle 2nd dose? Granucci, says he's 31-year veteran, gnashed teeth called COVID-19 vaccine mandate ""total tyranny"" insisted ""done silent matter, many members.""

But CDC changed guidelines 8 months 6 months proving point lmfaooo. wore mask CDC recommended thought insane told us wear one. 


2. Going honest stopped wearing mask CDC said don‚Äôt need wear one bit reckless probably got covid. 


3. said 8 months insane long I‚Äôd get time right anyone look thread show said November would 6 months. 



Now CDC changed 6 months like changed went masks wear mask.

CDC 1 year: need daily booster shot. mean, Americans die first, right? promise kept. I‚Äôm sure case count *is* leading metric. 

But places low vaccination rates, positive tests still leading indicator hospitalizations deaths. wants live Florida? basically people suddenly need supply breaks down, also JIT problem. Look toilet paper. I'm questioning said. Huge difference said article written. stuff pipeline already. They‚Äôre gonna give stuff intended everyone could get shot boosters, maybe 1/3 population simply isn‚Äôt getting vaxxed doses allocated. Maybe nuance lost doesn‚Äôt also mean vaccinated come contact covid (ie part 20), chances subsequently infected reduced 95%? would argue they're loyal politics religion think One reasons probably much harder run trials. signed volunteer vaccine studies Germany year ago so. got email days ago could participate study MVA-SARS-ST (some new vaccine candidate).

Coming soon, Thanksgiving Christmas/New years surge idiots learn last year.

After new years dead/maimed families either longer us maybe learned lessons hopefully 2022 better year, highly doubt it. think got point, upvoted you. think test **all people**, decide get tested. **But**, think it, decides go get tested? either symptomatic cases got exposed validated cases. rest, presumably, got infected. look percentage infections among vaccinated got tested, compare (divide by) percentage infections among unvaccinated got tested, get 95% ""efficacy"", means every 20 infections among unvaccinated, 1 infection among vaccinated.

*The math: 95% efficacy means 5% misses, 5/100, 1/20. Remember divided vaccinated unvaccinated, hence ""1"" vaccinated ""20"" unvaccinated.* Christmas week 2019 spent sick, Christmas functional day, Boxing day felt like hell again, I'd never experienced anything like it, wasnt 100% right month, functional Christmas week. I'm reasonably sure early Covid, especially since reacted pretty strongly vaccines. 
I'm certain keep looking it, Covid US least November/December 2019. changed report deaths. changed last week - state so. report date death actually occurred, recorded date. someone dies today covid certified week, recorded today's date. *So number deaths always look trending down.* really need look number deaths 5-7 days previously today see trend. Ya think? vaccine like wearing seatbelt. seatbelt stop getting car crash, puts best possible position survive it. Likewise, vaccine stop Covid getting system, makes sure immunity primed fight strongly possible.

Think natural immunity army defending body. Normally bunch guys knives ratchet booby traps going against, well, know, they'll try best. vaccine like billion dollar defense budget gives arms, tanks, ammunition, Kevlar, war plan insider knowledge enemy.

Since Delta variant causes infected people exude extremely high viral loads, chances infection high even vaccinated people, Israel. since many Israelis vaccinated, notice deaths hospitalisations gone WAY compared infections. yes, enemy breach border, vaccinated means well-defended less worry average unvaccinated guy shitty poorly-funded army. likely. someone pretty heavy cold last week, confirm respiratory stuff shuts libido right down. that‚Äôs get COVID jacking blood vessels stuff Ey Bless poor fuckin heart, ese Hospitals use JIT critical supplies case natural disasters. There's lot extra demand due COVID.

There's good chance hospitals could run out. taken precautions yet? still free all? really hope so! Hoping third dose game changer pandemic publicity good publicity say.  name Andrew Callahan. new channel called Channel 5 news right, Obamacare lot prevent situations like that.  Israel continues dire shape since allowing travel. think boosters going get current predicament. would correct. link article one, says they've started seeing Delta. dominant strain recently ""the Manaus strain"" i.e. thought would Lambda myself, given proximity Peru. Maybe Delta Lambda duke Argentina, we'll see one worse. district long since 5% wearing masks, large majority (60-70%) unvaccinated. live Germany healthcare tax that's quite high, 14% split employer first ~‚Ç¨60k income. I'm paying maximum, comparable paid US, coverage much better. make less money, pay less. They'll cover 70% salary year sick work. Everything covered deductible minimal copays.  wonder types say eventually affects them. quiet part said loud; getting kids sick plan, since vaccine approvals 12 expected September-October.

It's good plan. People really love create convoluted Covid analogies hahahah Yes, meant Korean article - since refer good info sources, considered 0.07 per 100k outlier artifact test cohort.

Now, Com-COV paper way interesting - thank sharing. brings questions though - example, double AZ Pf+AZ much inferior AZ+Pf - Pf+AZ even failing show worth trouble, AZ+AZ lowest cell response? many people primed AZ (no 2,5M doses), looks like getting AZ Pfizer effective. also based 463 people (84-day intervals make paper clearly stated reason, closer interval good thing already using things.

Congrats! looks like compatible we're get Quebec (does use format?). Stuff like makes MVP ready system. wonder situation UK look like next winter.

Maybe 100 deaths per day initial phase reopening (""exit wave"") next winter summer better. maybe beginning winter much worse? so, consequences things like life expectancy, required health care system capacity, etc. could quite bad long term. like need vaccinate world quickly, Delta didn‚Äôt originate vaccine saturated environment next variant won‚Äôt either, boosters won‚Äôt prevent new variant. Seems preliminary also positively hopeful third dose beat delta! common jobs requiring people going back office vaccinated? mRNA vaccines totally advertised sterilizing beginning. see see diminishing efficacy infection ""good trend"". Getting infected = BAD people getting long Covid even mild cases. 20s never risk serious illness death Covid. Took vaccine wanted avoid infection avoid long Covid, history autoimmunity. Delta, almost back square one 1) clearly reduces chances symptomatic infection 2) rates long Covid appear vaccinated unvaccinated, catch symptomatically. should, incredibly difficult lose license US. board extremely lenient 'locked down', 'quickly'. 16 days shot.

Know people four shots. NZ open heavy restrictions contact tracing cases blow big numbers. implying people crossing border gonna ""hang right"" 500+ miles walk right Florida? even happens would significant number people? reason Florida cases rise? insurance covers it, go bankrupt. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

This was, still good type vaccine.

I think people stopped listening actual words built symbol ""most extreme response Covid possible"", either makes hero villain depending ""team"". 
But compared last year fewer tools vaccine, he's really pushing reopening in-person schools year. important enough worth risk, he's *pleading* people take trivially easy actions mitigate risk (getting damn shot putting masks wedged rooms shoulder-to-shoulder).  
My toddler's daycare actually open since late last summer sending work. Masking distancing protocols *super* strict. Waiting periods return getting sick even longer before. We're Northeastern city taken Covid seriously *really* good vaccination rate. actually working! community collectively formed responsible adult meat shield around kids.  Many places restrictions place time mitigation strategy. vaccines rolled out, easing restrictions. never know much pin fact delta, I‚Äôm OP, root cause vaccine refusal. US south implement restrictions surge. there's another surge I'm confident restrictions either.

The debate around restrictions relevant places actually implement - places people vaccinated - risk hospitals overwhelmed.

I'm vaccinated. I'll get booster shot I'm eligible. I'll keep wearing masks now, avoiding large crowds. I'm locked home anymore. go out, things, see people close me.

The threat delta deserves respected, feel like we're better equipped handle original coronavirus last year (even we've never well equipped *should* be). And, honestly, there's sense peak caused delta may turn coronavirus's last big swing get control.

Now -- high vaccination rates good natural immunity -- cases risen bit, stabilized \~18/100,000.

Masks help, mean suggest otherwise. degree people around treat immunity-shields mind-boggling think? experts, people dedicated lives studying biology, virus medicine. Actual facts.

The secret accept anxiety. Imagine tunnel, anxiety. see light exit, shot relieved, know happen end since before. way tunnel accept need keep going forward continue accept feel anxious that's okay. Acknowledge anxious, accept anxious X, take things one step time. example ""ok need check in"", small steps like accomplish even though feel anxious time.

I avoided panic attacks years using method. afraid admit others anxious. main reason fighting anxiety want others know. perfectly ok tell nurse/doctor anxious shot usually makes feel relief.

Furthermore, communities genuinely high vaccination rates (85%) seems vaccinations need renewed biannually schedule.

Everything CDC accurate; people willfully misunderstanding fits false narrative. await executive order banning prosecution murder then. know mandating one murder violates personal freedom. people care aren‚Äôt people take action came across [Dutch referring preprint stating data Israel shows immunity achieved prior infection way better immunity achieved vaccination. surprised bit, I'd primarily heard opposite now.

I‚Äôve actually gone back asked older siblings remembered correctly did. transition Texas education system system smooth (that‚Äôs place Texas then).  Pretty sure extending direct federal aid would blatantly unconstitutional. happen think implies state funds though. % deaths? Can‚Äôt wait fire ass next year china's officials think ok fight back trump's bigotry fierce arguments even without firm evidence. I'm afraid deep sh*t realize themself already turned trump, really painful watch. said vaccines first came happening trying hide numbers report time? state deaths up, want people know many deaths counties have. Delta passed two people walked past Perth. think information outdoor transmission pre-Delta percent of:

1.	Recovery cases 
2.	Hospitalizations
3.	Deaths 

do children make? right, though. know related sure hell one coincidence. ( male, 26j )

I got diagnosed spondylarthropathie end 2020.

I got vaccinated om 1/7 armpain 2 days. 6/7 i'm doctor sever neck pains/headaches/ chest pain/ upset stomach/ diarrhea 

I feel shitty continue work, hit rock bottom 27/7: symptoms + pelvic region fire hips/ glute/ lower back severe pain. Went intensive care took blood said OK. Gave pain meds forwarded reumathology.

Got secons vaccine 12/8: notice anything except running nose sore arm 2 days.

I still hell, joints/hips/knees/lower back burning, stomach upset gastroenterology examination showed ok. Muscle soreness, overal fatigue, headaches, see lines eyes move with. problems peeing, chest pain/ abdominal pains, pain ribs/behind ribs? Chest plate hurts ... 
At moment taking redomex arcoxia panthomed 80mg stomach.

I wondering really coincidence vaccine triggered something.. 
Ofc doctors saying vaccine, altho tests come back negative. find anything... pumping full meds...

Is anyone similar experience? Yeah, 'merica. Sigh Canadian, birthright admitted. quarantine home, April. didn‚Äôt specify ‚Äústate‚Äù though. said public money. WAY overstepped. PPP loans, payroll support, applies.

He fcked BAD time  Plus take hospital resources block people health problems. they‚Äôre torturing healthcare workers anything like UK 18s fine anti-vaxxers Covid stressing hospitals taking space people cancer stroke high-risk pregnancies can‚Äôt go hospital themselves. CT major universities vax mandate, think we'll ok time, except feel small business owners already feeling pain, longer much support. People around certainly taking seriously.  guess means everyone promotes astrological views social media banned huh? sue shit Facebook every time someone says 2+2=5? 

You‚Äôre obtuse, makes sense considering shitty position is. Yes, zero relevance whether allocation zero sum. sum available vaccines change depending allocated, allocation vaccines definition zero sum.

That literally zero sum means, cannot change sum outcomes different allocation. Well wouldn‚Äôt good 100% cases children don‚Äôt get seriously ill? Nurses fed nursing COVID pandemic: plans? would leave nursing knew good alternative, financially. state know fall bring, time people living north travel Florida.

We also can't disregard possibility new variant number infected places like Texas Mississippi. major reason nobody serious authority pushing lockdowns surge ""even playing field"" more. We've got 70% adults vaccine protection, treating treating ones clogging hospitals absurd. Okay. I'm planning get booster probably second week October, like week two flu shot.   Vaccinated people still get virus
Vaccinated people still spread virus
Vaccinated people might cause new variants
No proof mRNA achieve herd immunity

But‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶I scared lets let government whatever want make feel safe again!! want mommy‚Ä¶ still put feelers.

Hold accountable think big enough, especially among older population county like 98%. see. bought fat stack actual N95s fall. mom sister felt like absolute shit first shots, know sure we've COVID yet. Yay, it! huge difference, percentages weird - let's try math.

Unvaccinated people 29 times likely hospitalized vaccinated people. simplicity, assume 0.1% 2.9% chance (I know true percentage matter result). Let's calculate worst case delta contagious improved vaccination rate reduce spread.

For community 10,000 people Florida, 5100 vaccinated, 4900 unvaccinated, means 5100 \* .1% + 4900 \* 2.9% = 147.2 Covid patients Florida hospital.

For community 10,000 people Connecticut, 6500 vaccinated, 3500 unvaccinated, means 6500 \* .1% + 3500 \* 2.9% = 108 Covid patients Connecticut hospital.

I think fair say Florida hospitals currently running less 120% planned capacity, read Covid patients make nearly 65% total patients. numbers, Florida hospital 147.2/.65 = 226.5 total patients 226.5/1.2 = 189 capacity.

The Connecticut hospital probably number non-Covid patients (226.5 - 147.2 = 79.3), 108 + 79.3 = 187.3 patients total, less 99% capacity.

Whoah, expect number high - guess hope vaccination also helps slow spread, and/or CT vaccination rate rises CT hit. Every jab counts.   Ye TN. narrowed state article talking about.

With 12 getting vaccine highly doubt rise unless new variant targets kids lot we'll see couple weeks cases take effect ""I'm purifying sewage draw line government telling sewage purified.

This isn‚Äôt one-size-fit-all answer.

Well let's try sample math:       

Texas ~29m people.    
With total ~3.5m cases reported far.     
46.6% state fully vaccinated. roughly 13.5m people vaccinated.      
Now let's extremely generous say cases people unvaccinated. That's case, we'll lazy.      

That's 17m people 29m have, form, antibodies virus. We're also assuming reinfection still rare...but variants may change time.      
Roughly speaking pumps numbers ~58.6% population. still leaves 41.4% left infect. That's massive amount people left. got second dose first week March, 6 months puts at...next week. can't come soon enough.  Law

No one even begin take seriously unless understand phrase attempting use. way would national database digital vaccination cards scannable check database. Physical paper cards scanning, searchable database backing less worthless trying prove something true.

There's reason give pieces paper name written driver's license. 50 state databases linked federally searchable scanning card.  time tell people look decision first Kiwi dies Delta.

Every person vaccinated abroad one chance avoid covid actually making NZ. every country could 'solve' covid, NZ worry anything. even altruistic, still makes sense vaccinate high-Covid populations first.

As NZer, I'm glad waste money bidding price (even we'd offered more, still may outbid desperate country winner Pfizer's bank account), vaccines reached covid-affected areas faster. IMO still better covid reduce impact better focus resources direction opportunity (resources includes staff facilities vaccinating, backend call centre work around awareness bookings, actual dollars spent vaccines. could focused things - current testing centres draw staff pool, example, one things affecting current vaccination availability badly need healthcare/MIQ workers resources).

There's much involved 'acquire vaccine, hand vaccine, measure number, pronounce win'.  antivax go ahead pull maskless children, vax approved children pull anyway.

Chaotic good Local authority. used something Republicans believed in. headline 100% burying lede.

First all, WAY vaccinated people unvaccinated, hospitalizations equal, alone suggests ~4x protection vaccinated people.

BUT CRITICAL THING THAT‚ÄôS MISSING MATH: 

**You CANNOT compare two populations equal demographics.**

Unvaccinated people OVERWHELMINGLY younger healthier vaccinated population. 

They *should* *way lower* hospitalization rates vaccinated population, older sicker. 

To reveal effectiveness vaccine, need *age-adjusted* stats. 

Thankfully, article include lower August 21, Health Ministry recorded 215.9 severe COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people among unvaccinated age 60, compared 21 per 100,000 people among received two doses Pfizer vaccine. makes unvaccinated older people 10 times likely experience severe case immunized counterparts.

So vaccine still working *extremely* well, wouldn‚Äôt know headline. times.

**Deep South**: Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, Georgia

All urban/rural divides like every state, course. That‚Äôs real difference America, geography.  I've discussed people say young, vaccinated older sick thus less likely survive younger ones treated. Tx Fl? TX graduate students required vaxed, wear masks. state passed law saying nobody create mandate.  don‚Äôt let vaccinated people decide themselves.

Would counterproductive get soon? 6 months would end October, would get ASAP though. square away fact CDC come said breakthrough infections much common thought, vaccinated spread disease easily symptomatic, data Israel showing bad covid outbreak despite 80% logic like saying people able freely drink drive they‚Äôre risking life.

It's really fly. person buying card knew get shots. They're absolutely committing fraud using fake card.  look common flu.

Higher even R0 non-variant COVID back start pandemic! **This need masks again!!**


Here objections. Let's consider effect vaccinated people wearing masks. let efficacy masks go 100%--which certainly not--and say:

Re = 8(1-.5*1) = 4 people wearing masks going get us need go.

You also say, alright, happens 100% people get fully vaccinated 85% effective vaccine? case,

Re = 8(1-1*0.85) = 1.2 1

So need mask *forever*! reasonable sustainable thing. disease unique need permanently change interact public it. immunity, expect US UK drop restrictions let virus circulate, without causing high burden healthcare system. change goes effect 1 Nov, beginning open enrollment.

We happened get vaccines general population right covid showed again. They've rolling limited supply date batches based exposure health risk levels, trickling via various different health districts (so availability bit patchwork). Vaccinating happening steadily, scheduled around deliveries mostly available priority groups initially. 

I know people first vaccinated ever frontline/healthworker types, way back March April. people know got book mine last month part restricted 'at risk' group limited times &amp; places, couple weeks later new batch arrived country suddenly huge increase available booking times. went got mine straight away, mostly forget! (I considered waiting convenient, would pushed back 2-3 months figured might forget entirely).

 people know either jumping first chance could (a lot people showing chance leftover vaccine walk ins end day), relaxed assuming would happen point, can't bothered travelling 40min somewhere something non-urgent. people knew *happening*, would probably vaccinated eventually part normal course things.

And couple weeks later, bam, covid leak, everyone's suddenly got nothing except sit home, go get tested, go get vaccinated :D forever...and keep getting shots variants inevitably arise, regardless many folks US get vax'd.

We need start honest long term stop acting like (fill blank) makes Coronavirus ""go away"" next (fill blank again). crime claimed miss use government seal way prove get confession.

I'll wear one place requests otherwise. also work population everyone eligible vaccinated. live Rapid City. 

The governor here, Kristi Noem, taken virus seriously start.

Also, state government care one bit people here. They've straight overturned people one occasion.

[In 2017, anti-corruption ballot measure passed, state legislature passed bill basically making ballot measure null void. past election, citizens voted legalize Marijuana. Noem's administration sued get ballot measure overturned. Oh referring blaming Chinese government it. would unified populous china fit misguided patriotic rage. Vax rates would like go along inlistment rates. end sort health surveillance state get monitor life choices make sure diabetes got poor eating choices.  open ICU beds, I'm guessing best, beds easily found/accessible people (Texas kinda large). One thing find interesting drop-off non-covid ICU beds. people hospital getting infected covid already there, reclassified covid beds? nearly 2K people able get bed covid patients took all?  got enumerated 2018, left residency summer. Haven‚Äôt gotten chance even get big buck yet lol. know else staffing shortage: schools hospitals. Yet, vaccination mandates place. cops firefighters get done dirty exception blow. numbers seem expected. 8.3M 16+ year olds LA County vaccination rate group breaks roughly as:

Fully vaccinated: 66% (~5.5M) 
Partially vaccinated: 7% (~0.6M) 
Unvaccinated: 27% (~2.2M) 

Which makes infection rates per 100K fully vaccinated unvaccinated:

Fully vaccinated: 198.1 
Unvaccinated: 1400

So would work 85.9% efficacy. None friends family caught except two them, fully vaccinated. cold like symptoms 3-5 days fine. would started Canada. commit hate crimes Canadian immigrants blend pretend they‚Äôre northern state? Hell even ones Montreal could say they‚Äôre France. worst would happen united Canada maple syrup boycott Bieber would lay low awhile. Haha hell yes last age group Florida get vaccinated got shot soon could, mind i'm 3 months post vaccine. Work mandated masks handed layered cloth masks us offered little blue/white masks forgot cloth mask/whatever reason. caught covid previous vaccine, catch yearly bout gnarly bronchitis get like clockwork autumn.

I wearing masks store, drive windows, etc. think non-n95 masks work well, think often people wear them. Work ten-hour shift, travel alone, ate away people could.

Mind couple occasions accidentally left mask car, going pick food quickly restaurant, running daycare (just lobby) five minutes pick kid.

They're perfect, damn good job. Especially Floridians wearing masks every chance get. We‚Äôre talking preventable disease we? We‚Äôre taking disease affecting entire global community time scale that‚Äôs killing millions. 632,000 Americans dead (that‚Äôs pop. Vermont) foe microscopic well understood general population, nearly half country refused basic things curtail infection rates. Mask wearing, hand washing, social distancing getting widely available vaccine. They‚Äôve thinking entire time without even considering consequences actions people like mom. 

So case, yes. want consequences people ability help curb infections rates simply won‚Äôt. people fighting decades viral research shitty FB meme. people fighting healthcare, retail customer service professionals jobs trying keep us safe country running. people wanting access treatment frankly didn‚Äôt care COVID happened them. It‚Äôs maddening. full approval boosters, EUA? hate whole anti-vax thing too, I'm little concerned re-open whole pre-existing condition problem. used justification raise rates diabetes patients, lung cancer, heart disease, etc? I'm sure come something us that's unhealthy use way justify jacking rates. üòÜ 

Are new this?

Have heard Patriot Act? Edward Snowden leaks? President Obama empowering federal government even more? Social media cracking Occupy Wall Street Russia Gate? fire department desperate need diversity, women, minorities Same. woman 30s feel like two week wait shot longest wait life.

To credit bare minimum vaccines coming said would take them

Abb ott? Man oh man Texas want man's head Agree, unless you‚Äôre immunocompromised 65+, really shouldn‚Äôt thinking yet. also believe masking needed indefinitely, least lifetime, want keep severe disease deaths bay

Again, see, much disagree. explained think dating sex work. said explicitly, think people going willing give bars restaurants combined social distancing

You think people going give hugs decades? Give seeing families friends person decades? really, really not. Vaccines enough

I really disagree. reduce mortality ~95%. Boosters more, better vaccines. UK already dropped restrictions. would expect US wave.

By way, last novel coronavirus (now common cold) came late 1800s. couple year blip mortality, things calmed down. that's without vaccines. permanent masks. hard see different. definitely better idea going somehow isn‚Äôt translating people right thing cases exploding.

Thank knew og meant short   Thats frustrating. I‚Äôve seen people mention going pharmacies getting it. dunno. Biden, Trump Oprah, head FDA, couple televangelists, police union reps, Alex Jones joint appearance week long series Rogan podcast celebrating pfizer day/week full approval. Jones course paid highly blackmailed creating unifying conspiracy theory supporting vaccination, probably sedated key points hit. course people smarter mar/com/pr.

Seems like start least. announcement bit underwhelming. literally make best vaccines.  would make BC Florida Canada, cause whales instead alligators.

(speaking BC guy) ‚ÄúThey pre-existing conditions!‚Äù it‚Äôs saying leaders tell others afraid scared virus. lol nice night  wearing seatbelt make someone else likely die, unlike taking vaccine. good analogy. I'm big fan charging anyone money. 60 percent Americns overweight. feel like insurance companies start charging unvaccinated end? Delta make vaccines mandatory. Apparently supreme Court okay making companies forcing employees. OK, emergency. what? Sit hands absolutely certain hospitals overwhelmed? exactly gotten better, early days must terrifying. least idea hell is. fact 3 3rd given public proves works lol. bullshit keep gain power followers wonder many people round 2 covid getting last year? Lol, love clueless every aspect. Lol

You literlaly clue anyone saying. ""A June 2020 University Iowa study published Health Affairs medical journal estimated 200,000 COVID-19 cases prevented May masking mandated several states."" agree that. probably wouldn‚Äôt go well; mean, don‚Äôt know answer, it‚Äôs tough. suppose it‚Äòs several factors. Seasonality probably one them. FL saw wave around time last year. vax rates. okay FL, far UK levels, especially high risk groups. I‚Äôd say another important factor Delta. contagious probably also likely lead severe disease. Waning protection vaccines may also part picture, though seems true protection infection. Protection severe disease remains strong. would also consider mentality. Lots people FL don‚Äòt take disease seriously act accordingly. Doesn‚Äòt really help slowing spread. ne ultra crepidam¬†is Latin expression meaning literally ""Shoemaker, beyond shoe"", used warn people avoid passing judgment beyond expertise. got damn Covid! TOOKERJEBZZZZZZ Angeleno, embarrassing. love think big argument it‚Äôs already case. Delta really surcharge illegal. discounts legal assumed that's despite terminology article. technically vaccination percentage increases death. faster people die, faster approach herd immunity. data examined age decile rather across entire population efficacy severe disease ranges 81.1% 80-89 year olds 100% 12-19 20-29 year olds. efficacy 90% everyone age 60. 

Israel MOH also released data recently showing people vaccinated earlier higher rates infection difference hospitalizations age cohort whether vaccinated second dose January April.

Everyone read post get better understanding vaccine efficacy population vs efficacy age cohorts. read anti-vaxx shit completely contrary overwhelming consensus medical community, I‚Äôm reminded weird shows would come late night cable TV kid. 

Those shows would convince people actually aliens popping ocean daily, blurred footage ominous talk tracks. 

You‚Äôd could convinced monk China/India/wherever could stop heart restart thinking it. could overcome heat/freezing cold etc controlling body. could levitate meditation. 

Was entertaining watch? Sure. 

And without even bare minimum fact-checking stories, kid could even mildly convincing. 

But even kid, would **stake life** true/real light fire/lock freezer/jump building?

Absolutely fucking not. 

So many people lighting fire bc read convincing enough narrative internet. Every day get car choose wear seat belt not. Now, typically wear seatbelt, times don‚Äôt short low speed errands. Now, could possibly get ticket wearing it, it‚Äôs highly unlikely though. It‚Äôs choice make it‚Äôs forcing medical treatment anyone. know exactly low, think would reasonable recommendation unvaccinated pregnant women take precautions.

Deficits hospitalized breathing respiratory symptoms respiratory symptoms\^\[1]\\^\[2]\. proposed cause hypoxia. mother take precautions sake sake child. Intrauterine hypoxia contributing risk factor epilepsy, ADHD, eating disorders, cerebral palsy, increases risk mortality, SIDS.\^[3]\

The two papers full-length texts available. Vaccinated unvaccinated people carry shed similar amount virus *when infected*. vaccinated people get infected often, get less sick recover faster unvaccinated people. faster recovery means there's also usually less time vaccinated person contagious. course survival rates much better vaccinated people unvaccinated. Lunch time gap, COVID magic around aether lunch.  chill assume percentage base population, that's resident evil level fuck Sorry complicate could possibly share sources, feel like credible sources help educating unvaccinated friend possibly getting vaccinated. Fucking good. literally thinking going start see happening. Same! double check make sure step dad. saw point follow certain rules safety comfort others, knew him. Very, conservative. 

Go James!!! Delta meet... Delta! free takes five minutes. else going time? willfully unvaccinated continue ignore science pleas tell rest us *all need know* lack empathy deficit character. inexcusable, illogical, morally bankrupt people eligible vaccination refuse it. So, I'm pro-vax, pro-mask, anti-crazy conspiracy theory, even I'm thrilled prospect sharing medical records whoever makes reservations local Thai restaurant.

Oh he's seeing spa-chem-in. Great guy. Air Bud ü•≤  Makes sense, thank explanation. Standing. Fucking. Ovation.

However, leakages observed result notable decreases mask efficiency relative ideal filtration efficiency mask material, even case high-efficiency masks, R95 KN95. Tests conducted far field (2m distance subject) capture significant aerosol build-up indoor space long duration. quantitative measure apparent exhalation filtration efficiency provided based experimental data assimilation simplified model. results demonstrate apparent exhalation filtration efficiency significantly lower ideal filtration efficiency mask material. Nevertheless, high-efficiency masks, KN95, still offer substantially higher apparent filtration efficiencies (60% 46% R95 KN95 masks, respectively) commonly used cloth (10%) surgical masks (12%), therefore still recommended choice mitigating airborne disease transmission indoors.‚Äú

So cloth masks better nothing, R95 KN95 masks provide even better protection around you. haven‚Äôt said anything beyond 1 booster least, patients receiving therapy remain stable. adapting -- hence respirators. Adapting returning normal pretending virus exist... teach 6th 8th grade. Even city mandated masks schools (inspite governor), students already coming school masks. district mandated masks 2 weeks now. students really good it. grumbling come fellow teachers.

First week school, 4-5 kids marked absent CV19 next names. Next week 4-5 more. neighbor teacher half 6th grade class pulled one day. week 6th grade classes reduced half. came work beginning week notice room sanitized due found Covid exposure. one notified me. I'm really salty that.

edit: word I've seen tempted try them. issue nose bridge really flat (typical kids syndrome) never get great seal even ones fit face length wise. 

I'll probably end making cloth ones ties go disposable ones anyway. cant double disposables stay behind small ears either. 

Sigh. great options. kids vaccine needs get quickly. Currently breastfeeding exclusively vaccinated. relief know. Boobs amazing. I'm talking you, grandfather . tried sanitizing home? covid-19 vaccine never, think ever promise complete immunity absolute lack danger. Quite so! chicken egg situation, low capacity reflected every facet life. Nothing short tragic. Keep mind variants develop anywhere world. 5.3 billion people received 0 doses. indigenous pronunciation? I'm sorry loss.

If believe incorrect please provide proof.  see saying. Yes, beds gone better figure new triage process. Though hospital many others back covid wrecked area.

Thank Florida making hate people even more. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs means.

Otherwise would said something similar first shot, also takes around 2 weeks ramp up.

The two weeks long takes body build antibodies vaccine. scheme things, extra two weeks won‚Äôt likely make difference, especially given around 6 months antibodies start dropping vaccine. people voting you. You‚Äôd get kicked med school they‚Äôd let spend 8 years there.

Look, want kids vaccinated quickly possible, children medically tiny adults. different reactions needs. there‚Äôs real risk GB kids dosing high?

Yes, need expedient, also need thoughtful. anxiety/panic stuff keeps getting worse

&amp;#x200B;

yay Theoretically possible reach number would give herd immunity assuming homogenous population? certainly possible. think WT, needed like 50-70% immunity heard immunity. Alpha, maybe 70-80% would needed. Given effective vaccine strains fact 12u group make 15% population, certainly mathematically possible.

Now Delta requires 85% resistance virus get herd immunity, even 100% effective vaccines 100% vaccination 12+ may enough. also account regional differences non-homogeneous populations, totally impossible except infecting 12u get natural immunity.  Good hear! Glad healthy hoping get school year teacher, let's see go month booster without picking up.

Not, Atlanta. Power grid falls drop hat. Insane government. Seems shitty. fault report data provided, articles try capture age readout.

It's story stay long time. can't imagine coworker, daughter... grandkid never know her. Florida claiming immunity year half. Covid keeps coming back find everyone thought vaccinated people don‚Äôt end hospital pandemic unvaccinated? Exactly. going fuck Taliban, far reaching effects millions innocent people rule oppressive regime.   is, word, horrifying. forgo vaccine tested twice weekly!

You‚Äôre unlikely test positive. do, don‚Äôt travel.

And Enjoy life! think still marginal effect spread. 

It marginal effect hospitalizations, given vaccinated individuals still get covid still spread it, limiting still mean less overall community spread.

Also, keep mind months leading holidays right majority vaccinated individuals would hitting 6 months. Lower efficacy preventing infection combined increased spread know winter already brings would disaster.

Obviously best option would get non-vaccinated individuals vaccinated. problem is, even many states literally overwhelmed, we‚Äôve gained 3% eligible vaccinations month. think vaccine requirements make bit dent vaccination rate, beyond that, don‚Äôt think even minority remaining unvaccinated give in. haven‚Äôt yet, there‚Äôs much that‚Äôs going change minds.

Trying convince waste time. real chance making large difference going vaccine mandates. Labor Day public schools open.

I surprised ""eight months"" timeline initially confident able get supply distribution quick enough, gears motion became clear could get stuff rolling quickly. 

Also think everyone going rush get booster first eligible day. mean, *I* will, think it'll trickle deluge initial shots. Lol instead messaging says get vaccinated save lives...

They ""early treatment saves lives""

What joke. uninformed think nbd treatments take care it.  Big pet peeve mine: write-ups never say confidence intervals (spoiler alert: they're big).

[From CDC Delta predominant period **66% (95% CI = 26%‚Äì84%)** compared 91% (95% CI = 81%‚Äì96%) months preceding Delta predominance.

Delta made people work without vaccine year. care health safety employees. trying scheist workers.

ACA says can‚Äôt base premiums anything age, location, smoking. However, give premium credits healthy living. likely falls that. Ventilation (open windows) extremely effective also, highly possible places next months.

Vaccination course prevent 80% infections happening. booster might reduce extra 75%. exposed enough odds still get you. issue employer inevitably requires third dose, either show lied, get fourth. Look numbers. Cases basically gone since 6/19. However, reported deaths dropped dramatically since 8/11, averaging 20 deaths per day past week, 177 average 7 days 8/11. conclude cannot trust death numbers, all. can't trust numbers, makes us think infections accurate?! speculate state pandemic Florida, think really know, may well much worse think. worse ever before... really know MUCH worse. reference [this Office Space see movie.

Dare suggest masking, selectively locking contact tracing whole time immediately start now? used bit careful long covid, numbers unvaccinated people. would get scared depending numbers look like vaccinated people. Especially young ppl Even not, still bring fact every conversation mentions delta variant going forward Every non-Delta lineage steady decline since started vaccinating 18-30.

I'm vaccinated I'm sure vaccines work. come israel 10k cases day    Well that's legit question, tbh, dunno downvotes world needs Florida Man ever! happy health insurance First part right (there's way determine many people exposed). Second part kinda wrong. determine vaccine efficacy, need know number unvaccinated people. take ratio. example, 3.3% unvaccinated New Yorkers infected Covid time period, relative risk vaccinated people 0.33%/3.3% = 0.1. Vaccinated people 0.1x likely catch Covid unvaccinated people. Therefore, vaccine efficacy 90%. Bless heart thinking people know already  I‚Äôm assuming $200/m extra cost drop get vaccinated insurers won‚Äôt use premium cost creep?

 /s  still don‚Äôt see clinical data showing benefit general public. There‚Äôs data showing increase antibodies, doesn‚Äôt necessarily translate lower infections. 

Has anyone able find information showing clinical benefit booster dose?   is! Don‚Äôt get it!?

Why can‚Äôt translate mask enforcing beyond ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Mass psychosis something, dunno‚Ä¶ like B.F..... (the ""other BF.... ""movie scene"" rednecks..... yes ONE..... ). Albertabama..... response guy would ""you go back Europe first"" original immigrant must missed reaction BLM stuff past years... exactly point them. sad, took second understand Kansan ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Continue vaccinations &amp; masking? home visit vaccination option there? Maybe DeSantis put ego aside declared state emergency could get oxygen feds? Thank saying this. Thank keeping politics side. Everyone gotten covid capacity point we‚Äôll probably herd immunity. Medieval plagues usually lasted 4-5 years I'm honestly confused. company receiving taxpayer bailouts/subsidies anything healthcare policy?   medical community Florida band together dump unclaimed Covid corpses Desantis's doorstep. talk things exactly like kid entertained tv. unfortunate people think monk stop heart, ultimately matter. matter believe show, played profound level: Watching tv show itself. makers show want get attention moment watch show. tv channel wants watch channel. media chain owns tv channel wants share media industry. Etc etc.

Just talking horrible disinfo vaccines such. turn ""tv"" moment consider actually happening: matter monk stop heart matter vaccine disinfo wrong.

Why none important non-trivial questions asked? possible disinfo campaigns fake run exactly get people distracted fake controversy?

Millions dead disabled. People businesses lost billions dollars. continue. tv showing FBI raids? reddit threads massive court proceedings? live streams riots?

There people chose millions die billions dollars ""lost"".

Why nothing total silence behind superficial noise? bro got first jab 2 days ago get second mid-late november, that's true whoa whoa whoa hold up. COVID deaths happening lot NAVY? man head must sand, least super concerned military. I'd figure could least bipartisan  Plus Brazil using 90 days period jabs, got first 2 days ago get second mid-late november Good  things papers hard judge without specialist knowledge. case vaccine efficacy papers, there's probably non-ideal practices watch for, they're probably pretty straight forward regular people understand.

Some scientific papers harder judge. example, trying judge appropriateness vitro assays recently shared preprint Delta 4+ mutant authors claimed would total escape. many aspects go making sure assays appropriate determining see could happen vivo. pseudoviruses, cell lines, sensitivity assays, etc. There's many variables casual reader know evaluate (myself included) authors obviously flat say methods bad. case, suggested serious methodological flaws paper. Nice thing actual experts, say something stupid, sometimes someone tell wrong. Probably easier asking explanation sometimes. \^\_\^ cant unfortunately. one love glaze. Secondly hate warm donuts, need fridge least hour YEARS? hear DECADES?   25% population 65+

Less efficiency older go. üòÆ‚Äçüí® makes feel tired sad.

We lost foolish whole. people South Dakota want Sturgis, iirc, they're first suffer. Last year Midwest worst peak direct result Sturgis.   article weird they're talking source control (filtering exhalation), infection control (which requires filtering inhale). (K)N95 mask might little better protecting others infected individual, *far* better protecting wearer. Thank analyzing data! lost anti vaxxers hopefully think critically üôè Yep ecological breastfeeding bit different exclusive breastfeeding. simplest terms, baby gets nutrition directly breast (no bottles pumps solid food), baby full unrestricted access breast nurse comfort nutrition (baby sleeps room mom limited pacifier use) baby put breast demand (no sleep training). Basically breastfeeding living human 10 thousand years ago. Evolution created system feed baby would fed baby prior electricity, etc usually ovulation suppressed natural child spacing 2-3 years. Prolactin estrogen enemies- prolactin necessary make milk rise estrogen necessary ovulate. Ecological breastfeeding means body told make prolactin often enough- baby‚Äôs frequent nursing- estrogen never allowed rise long enough ovary throw egg. it‚Äôs perfect system sometimes ovaries definitely kick gear earlier it‚Äôs something rely absolutely must get pregnant right now. Yup, Lawrence, Kansas IIRC.  saying declared 'right'? Looks true, still negate effectiveness protecting individuals. Desantis realized suppress numbers. fans even look. numbers fine, go back two weeks; backdate. dont say? Also, fully vaccinated. first shot 12/2020. doubt great protection currently. [Anyone got booster? Perfect response! Love uneducated people hate vaccines seem know all. Would love know skipped polio, tetanus hep vaccines too? cells permanently produce Spike protein?

No, produced short producing Spike protein harm cells body way?

No, harm cells. Else cound produce immune system attack cells question protein?

The immune system attac cells. 

Getting vaccine much safer getting covid without vaccination.  unrelated anomaly, evidence condition's relation Medigen Vaccine.   admit it‚Äôs weird supposedly said something according articles neither one us find quote actually saying it?  Lax Vax Tax Idk that. US 95% covid vaccinated. really seems rare get transmitted get hospitalization level would mitigated point flu. belief ive professed friends motive fauci reasonable politicians behind masks, social distancing, shutdowns, etcmmm wasnt evicerate COVID covid, make managable. COVID cant eliminated whole world board. avoid US getting south level unmanageable. mean think much fraction hospitalization deaths today would everyone one selfish idiots vaccinated. Yes would breaththrough cases mean .33% crap like De Blasio presented data press briefing, showing 0.33% fully vaccinated New Yorkers diagnosed COVID ‚Äúbreakthrough US like that... fraction percent... manageable. Yeah might collapse you. mother died well vaccines available, nursing home careful ended catching it. 

FEMA paid us back everything including stone cemetery services. close 6k. 

it took couple months, busy.

save every receipt make sure one person's name.+

and make sure medical examiner puts covid related death certificate.  dickheads like Abbot DeSantis Gaetz continue stay office? fed step block people continuing harm country? Lazy cliche. Meanwhile still supporting killers.  kid recently. 

When asked regards getting vaccinated, doctor told us vaccines safe effective, studies far showed absolutely harm done babies. anything - may provide child antibodies breast milk (but expressed hypothetical waiting study - believe confirmed). 

So understand hesitancy (Wife hesitant well baby), doctor told us facts, trusted doctor, got vaccinated, kid delivered without issue.

I guess helps ""research"" Facebook COVIDTRUTH.ORG shit. ask professionals. they're saying may peaking beyond capacity test everyone can't confirm deny too.  children present!

The perl clutching... children see man bathing suit!  Delta basically COVID-20 scum say include 3rd party vendors out-sourcing use? (ie Delta Global Services etc..) funeral stocks? late get in? ok monoclonal antibodies turning pandemic around FL

It's economy scale. Medicare biggest insurer country negotiate best prices.

But Medicare also 'the government' many people want 'socialist' society principle...though every single one anti-socialists people would retire early Medicare available earlier age.

Unfortunately, system engineered keep people working least age 58.5. Otherwise, retire early, risk getting flu, spending week hospital losing life's savings.

They say count something like $250k per person healthcare costs retired/elderly. outcome people live frugally, get cancer pass none meager fortune worked kids...and cycle starts over. healthcare system structured rob America generational wealth. Disney World really going Halloween year.  Last year wearing masks locking down. told need continue little longer get vaccines lower R number. R number &lt; 1.0 win. pro vaccine side like majority people. can‚Äôt focus lower hospitalization/death rate.

Thank you. details supermarket spread happened? Shocked people got MIQ (visitor quarantine) accidentally opening doors time 2-5 seconds. Florida apparently backdates deaths. die 10th conclude 100% COVID 20th, add 10th's total one's looking. I‚Äôm curious about. many died, negative covid tests random things like blood clots, heart issues probably weren‚Äôt going happen caught covid. AND, assume deaths, post negative test aren‚Äôt counted covid deaths even pretty much were. wonder large number that‚Äôd be.  aged super well resting heart rate COVID 75bpm

on average resting heart rate 100bpm. Right now, sitting work hours upon hours, slow 85bpm.

So far cardiologist cannot explain rapid heart beat I'm set soon get monitor figure form pattern that's changed.

Precovid none issue. #THOUGHTS PRAYERS Brit here, know. People say well. Older people 1918 exposed progenitor flu pandemic. Here's good talk it.  
There H1N1 pandemic 1830 1847. people late 70s older proper antibodies fight 1918 H1N1 (Spanish Flu). Young people instead exposed H1N8, antibodies useless H1N1. gets details around 45:00. hell confidence interval interpret wrote? single person wrong? Biden now, worries Well I've guess fu.ked :) study done mere week adminstering third dose, antibody levels peaked. remains seen degree long term protection affected. Could call Indian variant? Don‚Äôt know whole world suddenly desired can‚Äôt call variants countries anymore. confused days figured out. too.  Yes manadating law take vaccine much forcing you.

And question matter taken vaccine. vaccine works need people safe.

If people choose get vaccinated that's them. show vaccine work highly recommend people take it.

And go herd immunity need look Israel see work particular virus say support healthcare others? Seems rather presumptuous you. I'll state again: lieu universal healthcare system, support companies passing along cost providing healthcare actively choose avoid actual healthcare. 

This opinion irrespective whether company mom pop store corner received government, Fortune 500 company got bailout.

Also, fly United. upgrades legroom. UK delta rife seems breakdown around 65 per cent unvaccinated 5 10 per cent fully vac. Last time looked deaths fully vacc low well fully vacc 50 zero deaths. Study study proving even delta fully vacc makes u less likely get Covid19, get less likely hospital die. saw one study said vaccine changed chance dieing covid someone 80 someone around 50. Crazy testing varient USA ongoing monitoring recently launched mass antibody study well. truly get pandemic without studying desease, dealing it. Honestly lot regions aren‚Äôt bothering opt rate low it‚Äôs one kid class looney parents get much peer pressure effectively everyone masking. sure hope dont  still people think secondhand smoke serious concern... context missing?

What /u/hwy61_revisited /u/hwy61_revisited wrote another comment:

That 66% population fully vaccinated, breakthrough cases making 25.3% cases really good equates 85.9% vaccine efficacy. I'm brand name DIXI used synonymously mobile toilets. NATO use something else :p  countless conflicting reports different experts government agencies

That speaks lack understanding, actually. actually basically 0 months absorption. milk antibodies protect coating inner surface mouth/throat (and maybe bit nose?) respiratory bugs, stronger effect gut pathogens. antibodies breastmilk really get absorbed baby's humans, intestinal transfer maternal IgG colostrum sparse neonate immune competency assured transfer via sIgA taken infant‚Äôs intestinal mucosa \[148,158\]. fact, gut closure humans occurs birth little immunoglobulin absorbed intact intestine birth \[148,158\]. However, presence sIgA intestinal lumen part protective function epithelial barrier intestine \[159\]. virus initial impulse. Millions idiots ""thinking themselves"" made 10x worse.  That's right, that's major mistake people make talk ""living covid."" cannot go back 'normal' virus cause hospitals overflow. That's living nightmare people go concerts again. near-%100 vaccine uptake/ubiquitous population antibodies anything like 'normal' possible.  Hey he's trying help, bless heart Think yourself

That's exactly worst kind advice - kind got us trouble.

The vast majority people need delegate task actually capable it. health experts. ask Cletus McBumblebee ""think himself"", he's gonna self-medicate horse pills, seen recently real world. actually lot. mean 17 vaccinated people, one dies. means situation 100% dying covid Illness already body would die **100%** vaccinated, still roll 17 sided die roll one die. take 17x lower chance get covid even vaccinated, get serious sick getting covid every treatment fail 17-1 chance non vaccinated people get chance.

Does help you?  company chooses pass along cost providing healthcare actively avoid actual healthcare (in lieu single payer universal system)

Again Delta already funded hear union taking care yours.

Shame support rights others. Workers strong united are. Hope fly Delta. Smart. sort inverse though. He's basically saying one demand employees customers vaccinated, government telling private businesses (and yes, government entities) cannot do.

I understand principle behind wanting government compel citizens medical procedures performed them, aside fact already vaccine requirements public schools lot workplace environments, blocking anyone - government otherwise - requiring vaccine feels like petulance principle. Norway perish. 

No‚Äôoleans parish. usually deductible need meet insurance kicks in. could $1000 high $8000 (that‚Äôs personally seen) depending plan. deductible met, insurance cover mostly everything you‚Äôre still responsible copay $25 $100+ depending medical treatment. deductible resets every year. let‚Äôs say plan $8000 deductible. paid $7000 December 21st procedure, January 1st deductible back $8000. lot Americans type health insurance helpful, it‚Äôs basically medical debt bankruptcy insurance‚Ä¶ plan like years ago, avoided doctor hospital unless felt danger dying. feel sorry governor cares career people Florida. Stay safe people. Exactly. least that‚Äôs logic would dictate. Particularly it‚Äôs well documented natural infection awards immunity. 
Yeah think point it‚Äôs political pressure, following lot retroactive data, kind guessing. Wait. mean ONE state nothing wildly different numbers every state nothing.... might faking stats? 

You mean Jesus magic along protecting Florida? 

I know man? 

/s mentioned I'm getting test tomorrow. curious common people experienced feelings alongside COVID. guy makes almost half million dollars year. boss, say take vaccine resign.    Wonder number change schools open fall. know let people die asks Federal help politics. Florida needs recall vote. still understand. asking people vaccinated makes sense include request part larger plan including specific targets. Oh yeah totally. got health issues getting covid would death like 95% . Im still wearing mask distancing.. long covid side effects scare shit me. Also youngest like 4 months away eligible 1st dose. masks everywhere. pretty much diagnose covid based symptoms outside maybe losing smell/taste.

You go get test. CDC recommends vaccinated people get test 3-5 days exposure symptoms appear.


Dizziness come million different things So, I'm high risk (heart lung issues), immunocompromised group that's currently authorized get booster shots US.

But also work high risk environment (hospital) interact bunch different patient-facing doctors nurses days work office instead remote... vaccinated back December, they're saying 6 months booster shots starting late September?

If wanted get one proactively today, would walk CVS something tell I'm unvaccinated? yeah sure. unfortunately family member, attending would basically mean lifetime severely damaged relationships parents siblings.

i tried talk gave usual hand wavey ""its fine. itll fine."" we've super lucky far pandemic family think definitely led lot overconfidence.

if me, id least require rapid test attending. easy free. Wooo! got another one! like got hopes things getting better we're stupid stubborn go back safer way. That's weird. *Love* you. Yeah numbers really started trickling in.. take week two tests really start showing results. Someone told FDA approved Pfizer take attention Afgahistan. 

no words would love nurses hospital staff get paid more. But, I‚Äôve seen (mgmt healthcare consultant years), hospitals operate razor thin margins literally don‚Äôt money. would shut paid staff significant amount. People say it‚Äôs crazy take much money, expenses insanely high well. income relative inflation gone years mandated decreases insurance reimbursements.

This I‚Äôve seen consulting dozen healthcare systems. YMMV. see specific states news absolutely slammed Covid coupled pitifully low vaccination rates, please think we're Covidiots uneducated morons worship certain politicians. I've seen lot ""well, cares specific state they're stupid getting what's coming them"". may loud vocal them, number us believe science behind experts asking radicalized certain propaganda news outlets. deserve grouped they're unfortunately majority loud one that. best states think ""the good ol' days"" 1950s, rather 1850s. 

All said, fuck every last idiot deal person social media decides push misinformation agrees warped worldview that's what's promoted certain news outlets. Fuck every person gives spouse nasty looks people entire store wearing masks. Fuck every person willfully ignorant gets news advice vaccine quacks, charlatans, alt-right. especially fuck people decided battling Covid going political issue equate mask wearing ""losing freedoms"" ""being muzzled"". Y'all Karens Kevins think backwards opinion matters much medical expert scientist years experience, y'all ones prolonging pandemic.   one family immediate friend group maybe 10-15 people gotten it. Yup, winter around corner. Wait 12 weeks. 

This could get real ugly. ""Travel nurse""? think mean ""scab"" ""Vaccine passport"" propaganda term. Naturally BC calling proof vaccination card that. guess spreads faster also burns faster. Doesnt come right say that? Whoever listens idiot? far I've seen, that's data they've released far. gonna lie, surprised J&amp;J trying slow results studies mRNA shots supplementing J&amp;J shot. Yes, exactly reasons think. roommate right now. Said going avoid bars people sent text last night saying dance bar coyote ugly free shot. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è least vax'd though. Depends kind specific covid information looking get, guess. word want ‚Äúcue‚Äù, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs cue‚Äù, signal actor something.

Unless talking DeSantis waiting line. Montana, we‚Äôre due start school week, next week, I‚Äôd love links K- 5 school districts COVID dashboards already back session. I‚Äôve seen outliers (from Florida example), would great links school districts closely match vaccination case rages moment. county currently @ 50% vaccination (total population) 28 cases/day/100K. Thanks! many months wait? anyone experienced dizziness vertigo symptoms?

I've feeling dizzy since yesterday morning. got worse day went starting dizzy spells straight dizzy, almost feeling like vertigo. went bed felt like spins drinking much. woke morning really feel better. Walking bathroom like swaying ship.

I thinking much since experience MILD vertigo, usually elevator sometimes randomly feels like floor moving beneath me. BUT, boss left early Monday kid sick Monday night babysitter tested positive COVID. Yesterday bosses test came back positive well. vaccinated wears mask day although not.

Looking dizziness sometimes reported symptom recovery COVID, much precursor. something listed symptom CDC website I'm curious personal anecdotes regarding experiencing dizziness alongside COVID diagnosis. I'm vaxed get booster however order improve situation care 2 immunocompromised, continue wear masks, wash hands, avoid crowds, live new motto: ""DO LET GUARD DOWN"". havent gone back washing groceries one way aisles store ridiculous school starting people going concerts partys traveling virus worse before. wasnt politicized, dont think would sinking ship. Gov. Bill Lee thus far resisted suggestions. Instead, recently signed executive order letting parents opt children coronavirus-related mask mandates K-12 schools school districts issued mask requirements students pressed Wednesday Republican considering giving schools flexibility hold virtual learning, Lee said don‚Äôt plans yet,‚Äù said.

Remember, Amity *means* friendship.  went June... Love Iceland. COVID response amazing.  And? highly doubt oath implies people need work till death patients antivax idiots.

The oath likely assumed people would taking right steps preventive care.  Forget third. part 2 shots. Right on! sub used depress me. Then, while, really cheered up. Now, depresses again. one said easy absolutely doable.  Naive means previously unintended, I'm pretty sure uh, don‚Äôt best google-fu then.  Looking climate change pandemic I'm starting think humanity collectively becoming suicidal. RNs Texas go Florida, Florida RNs go Texas. way, everyone gets travel pay! Accepting someone actionable recommendation.

Also, parents couple‚Äôs counselor. That‚Äôs job. see objective protesting idiots state. Florida state people. bringinf everyone else honestly seeing consequences system trying best take care despite causing problem intentionally.

I starting believe change without drastic consequence. Unfortunately, doesnt look like taking high road working people anymore. Thank actually providing source instead telling I'm wrong. Thank right thing!  actually felt worst 3rd. first second mild. sore arm. also COVID prior vaccination maybe affected symptoms.  likely recommend. would consider getting moderna Pfizer first dose. really answer question though. angry someone vastly different stripping rights. 

Just clear, current vaccines provide extra layer protection wanes time reduces already small chance dying contract virus. alleviate healthcare systems, hardly qualifies effort end pandemic, especially vaccines marketed silver bullet distributed equally among global population. 

There's also legitimate concerns regarding longterm safety, mention nebulous often confidential nature liability clauses contracts authorizing use vaccines. 

So again, think fair unvaccinated people treated like 3rd class citizens? Google Ngram shows written references ‚Äúsummer child‚Äù context naive back 1840s.  
The earliest reference found ‚ÄúThe Southern Literary Messenger‚Äù 1844. Idk, like 10 so. think ever got one h1n1 scare Best protection still vaccination immune system naive. 

It clear true. public health people saying infection + one vaccine dose protective two vaccine doses.

However, incredibly stupid get disease try prevent disease, people get vaccinated! Jinxed it. northern states have...case rates per million vaccination rates.

I suspect broadly it'll like June. May CDC said people could go maskless. lot people still wore masks, June social momentum people not.

In United States, broader population going broader population going regardless authority figure says.

If referring Federal Government...it seems largely hands entirely pandemic. guidance coming states/local governments. pay normal RNs around $30-40 hour. turn around pay travel nurse upwards $200 hour. would feel someone job, got paid 5 times much Hippo violation? Sorry sucks. love saying juice ain‚Äôt worth squeeze. love there's sea political comments one gets removed. /r/Coronavirus kinda /r/fuckyouinparticular lot time Can‚Äôt lazy ""lol FDA approval meaningless move goalposts"" people: meaningful, convince many anti-vaxxers businesses start actually punish without fear litigation.

Debatable  realize centralized authority mandating things many locations restrictions different. company restrictions different school system live. state pretty much stays mandate business neighboring states different ones. federal government narrow areas make mandates in.

I'm anti-masker means, I'm also practical, sounds like freaking lunacy. I'm vaccinated wear masks indoors crowded areas.  Trying kill constituents, Gov. Abbot? Interesting strategy re-election, must say.

Following, I'm trying decide kid starting PreK. know Florida Man's name Texas Supreme Court almost always agrees everything governor does. really state issue federal issue. appears trying reduce state population. Sorry, boosters going allow people normalcy, whether like not. Remember Delta-and every single variant concern-came low vaccinated population. Even people start going back normal here, danger low vaccinated populations still exist. Unfortunately, there's really anything that, except maybe traveling high-risk countries. *Fellow Redditors:* previous comment loaded misinformation propaganda. Please disregard contents.

I‚Äôm 100% ya. It‚Äôs fucked amigo. article says 91% Staff 95% students, yea high.

I think end social events kinds vaccination rates, also think mask suggestions unreasonable given know Delta.

There obvious answers still significant unknowns. parent, I'm personally especially grateful efforts limit community spread waiting child vaccinations. hope boosters prove take bite Delta, I've already got future 6 month appointments family calendar, anybody know sure? Someone told days ago Florida's per-capita rate 8th worst never really closed throughout, means correct otherwise they'd number 1 worst.

That days ago they're 6th worst. /r/agedlikemilk content become worst rate. alSo cAUsEs CANcER fuck saying Correction. Someone died yesterday Covid-19 It‚Äôs worse that. He‚Äôs using emergency powers prevent local governments responding emergency, helping prolong emergency. longer emergency drags on, longer entrenches rule diktat. suspect also knows local governments likely implement mask mandates vaccination requirements higher minority populations he‚Äôs gambling covid damage base. Oh well  country needs massively inject funding CPS. cancer unfit parents here. data Israel started boosters ago. Don‚Äôt pedal vapid bullshit. much longer hospital staff simply leaves better state? 


Or goes strike? know unpopular opinion, way high school work pipeline medical trades largely bypasses post 12th grade liberal arts education would hone one's ability critical thinking.

Thank kindly kind internet stranger. Well things... doubt every funeral home crematorium. could get backed ones do. 

Also, said since start, I'm plaintive Florida lying numbers. far normal pace states taken similar actions.  spend work time locked enclosed area bunch people, potentially flying internationally, makes sense. deliberately trying kill everyone state! Also hold water. Supreme Court knock shit that. get vote for. Texas here. Also pissed. really want see poor people die. die small price ""progress"". - remember people much coherent discussing time. Latest data seems show natural immunity longer lasting least vaccines. probably dire say.

Still probably want prime body vaccine first. catching three times sixty years, actually bodes pretty well sort equilibrium. say immune deficiency keep appointment. like verify anything. lot us north don‚Äôt go back Labor Day. Aka stupid tax.  I'll riding air Canada then! understanding travel nurses contracted set amount set amount hours. really high pay also slated work like 6 12 hour shifts per week something. amount high hourly like 2-3x higher full time hospital staff. longer true? looked 1st massive wave. There's nothing stopping so. got pharmacy ask. Suddenly whole college/student loan industry makes ton sense. Alot harder quit owe couple hundred K. Shit. üòû 36% total number cases. Population % kids State?
Are severe, mild asymptomatic caught mandatory Covid tests admitted reasons?
I wish would add context like reports. kids want know becoming deadlier showing testing. haven‚Äôt seen numbers symptomatic cases yet, see article pediatric hospitalizations don‚Äôt even think people give shit family lol  work pharmacy shit annoying everyone takes leaks announcements freak us tell we‚Äôre authorized give boosters yet. Almost nobody ever said this. strawmen ridiculous. Oh republican voters dying. party vaccine/covid misinformation end losing elections future leadership ignorance thats them. 

That's reason 45 decided recommend vaccines rally, party losing voters. Arrested what? state lifted mask mandates. emergency orders removed. concerned parents going send kids school without masks defiance mandates school might place them. (17m) got first shot Pfizer Monday incredibly sick since then, earlier year unfortunately caught coronavirus I‚Äôm information relevant. Since Monday night fever went 3 hours. highest it‚Äôs 103.4F. go ER urgent care? can‚Äôt really find answer anywhere. barely type due headache body aches. advice appreciated. Likely symptoms, got positive test got better quickly without feeling need go hospital oxygen support. Bingo Naturally.  probably happening someone else depending live. 5 states make vast majority cases hospitalizations. you‚Äôre north east cases likely relatively low. live Philadelphia saw fairly modest rise cases peaked two weeks ago. Deaths hospitalizations never really increased much.  proud PBC school board defying insane govenor implementing mask mandates despite threats real crazies (and king crazies Desantis). want lose even faith humanity, here's stream meeting last parade starts 30 minutes in.

Several talk moved Florida pandemic specifically get away restrictions former states. super butt hurt local governments allowing irresponsible expected find here. 5hibk = think I'm immune compromised got 3rd dose. much reaction first 2, though tired couple warm moments 2nd. reaction 3rd. know weak immune system reactions weak too. Florida massive tourism. 

They're scared lose tell lie pay price. 

That said, gonna long, long time go Florida again. used go lot. Anecdotally I've heard walk local pharmacy say immune deficiency, give booster now. verification. 19 pediatric. It‚Äôs young adult. 

Right we‚Äôre talking 5-12 need vaccines. 19. 

I‚Äôm well-aware risks. can‚Äôt also push vaccine causes widespread GB. That‚Äôs also real risk could impede uptake forever.   According census back 2011, guarantee go take survey India would hsve overtaken China. guys really want something makes difference. get generations vaccine numbers up. 12-30? It‚Äôs abysmal worst rates per demographic. 
You super spreaders think won‚Äôt die cares. 
If one people blame. Anti vaccine people. don‚Äôt really give fuck. 
So grab fucking friends get vaccinated. 
Or we‚Äôre gonna fucked quite time. irony selfish prick contradict health recommendations. right things--not going out, masking, getting vaccinated--and I'm totally family. completely selfish. Helping others nice bonus really primary driving force. It‚Äôs Florida.

I fully support masks forever public transit doctor. However, (again) think minimal impact Rt.

There study released Netherlands actually cultured viral loads, confirmed case. What‚Äôs crazy study is- compared healthcare workers mostly infected delta past patients infected less contagious variants, found healthcare workers still LESS infectious unvaccinated patients.

They also found fully vaxxed individuals cleared virus extremely quickly compared unvaccinated.

Don't cancel appointment! still 97% effective preventing hospitalization death. medical workers can't quarantine too. talking locking every hospital country. would multiple months quarantine them. would people go get treatment non Covid related issues?

The American way. 

(IMHO) response somewhat embarrassing TBH. Florida dumb course, still needlessly political.

Our Republican governor went CDC advice doubled multiple times would statewide mandate segment K-12, leave ""up communities"".

Many critiques came public health organizations, teachers unions, state/local leaders, etc. Finally school mask mandate offloaded State education commissioner board, guess Governor go back pledge? There's bunch logistical issues transporting liquid oxygen, difficult get there. addition, Florida uses liquid oxygen purify water. half one hand, half other.

Not saying happen, think pride issue. looking graph, I‚Äôm wondering weren‚Äôt downvoting wrong.  Cue bubbas stealing NO2 racing supply store average cost hospitalization $40k acceding Delta Airlines, charging unvaccinated employees higher premiums.

I'll need sit dedicate time reading that, considering passive immunity breastfeeding one core reasons people it. surprising me. saying around way longer that, sweet summer child. problem is, many people let experts life - teachers, professors, doctors, auto mechanics, financial advisors, news outlets, etc. So, responsibly experts take role expert seriously enough. That, education system teach people pull together multiple sources sides forming opinions.  Comical Ron, younger half-brother Comical Ali. Right, can't legislate misinformation dealing subject little understanding fact rapidly changing. What's ""misinformation"" might turn correct month.

At start pandemic, claiming universal mask-wearing protected people covid misinformation. months later, *denying* misinformation. Earlier summer, figures US government claiming vaccinated people could more-or-less go back normal safe. delta hit US suddenly people telling everyone still needed wear masks.

In worst cases, effect exact opposite intended. ban something misinformation later turns true, create far conspiracy theorists 1984 comparisons would let unverified claims run completely wild.

And ignoring fact huge risks setting precedents suppressing claims powerful people want public hear. know works countries like China. People assume thing could never happen West; we're special. Hell, people sub think last US president borderline dictator; imagine would happen he'd able decide misinformation wasn't. disgusts think still sending men space precious oxygen barely anything breathe earth. Get there, pricks. include upper management Delta?  Yup, even current education standards huge shortage nurses. Raising requirements would make worse Paywall correct response valid! Definitely. It'd incredibly tough convince somebody volunteer 50% chance placebo, know there's already highly effective vaccines. can‚Äôt adults expect safe either. expect kids. I‚Äôll never understand force push people together middle resurgence. blatant disregard life open economy astounding. equivalent 95% protected becoming positive case?

Not exactly, basically means every 20 infections among unvaccinated, 1 infection among vaccinated. See responsiveness getting tested, yes believe right. Side effects much milder people know got 3rd shot, even people severe can‚Äôt get bed symptoms earlier shots.  They're afraid us them... problem all, Amazon 2-day shipping.

Oh Amazon out. fucked Yes, getting infected recovering would boost antibodies even already vaccinated. What's point vaccine, stop cases stop deaths? know people (including myself) got 3rd. Anecdotally, everyone similar response second shot. think need another toke. got flu shot every year. mom was/is nurse always made us go. one year mid-20s said ""this dumb. I'm young, healthy busy, need it.""

I spiked 103.5 fever 11pm new years eve, remote house friends. delirious. wife gave bunch Tylenol hours dropped 102, close asking take hospital. flu turned bronchitis lingering cough WEEKS.

All say learned lesson get flu shot every year. need covid booster feel worse that/die? Sign fuck up. need show next part. 

Ah, would require journalism, ""news entertainment"" division heads figured long time ago paying people investigate, document explain things *costs *money*, whereas could basically hire people read press releases, use scary-sounding words, emote editorialize lot - favorite! - use time goddamn news segment promote upcoming shows network - *make* money.  finish?

We get dictate virus. can't ask speak manager. kind question this?  r/aboringdystopia think works either way IMO. ignorant asshat trying win internet argument mislead people rather say anything value. still immunogenic AZ+AZ.

Mostly AZ+AZ worst option far. Pf+AZ dropped study designers due ""non-inferiority GMR using margin 0.63"" actual result 0.51- argue them, me. nearly equal Pfizer+Pfizer IgG, superior cellular response.

I never said wasn't. assume exposure levels follow kind normal distribution, 95% correspond certain measure distribution eg 2 standard deviations, mean etc. wonder assumptions underling 95% figures are. already morphed that? full line ""oh, sweet summer child, know feat?

Unfortunately mere glimpse climate change dealt made political decades ago. Bottom line? science, facts, reality matter 40% Americans, time 40% matter rest us. know anecdote isn‚Äôt worth much, I‚Äôm currently hospital bed getting Myocarditis result Pfizer Vaccine. I‚Äôm three days now, Cardiologist listed hundreds possible terrible scary things EKG Toponin levels could point to, explained mine either low enough/dropping fast enough qualify anything mega scary. fortunate Myocarditis well researched treatable, time coming bodily overreaction vaccine (as cardiologist believes be) rare uncharted. Im feeling fine fine, wanted share someone lost 12.6/Million dice roll. fucked situation choice teach schools Japan dozens students city outbreak. feel chance avoiding virus anymore. vaccinated work choice assure you. 

I vaccinated first time Sunday (4 days ago) feel could get virus day now, including today. happened caught today, four days getting first vaccine, help all, fucked? lol, nail head right there! Everyone thinks good insurance actually need it. sell bad parts all! There's reason keep print small. Grasping straws. buy state encourage base move there.

this clearly left/right issue Governor anything help save lives...WTF! Remember whole millennium end world thing year 2000 going crash computers? family members went bought kerosene heaters, survival food, etc. wife put jugs water trunk, case. misinformation seemed everywhere. Could well true, India vaccinating population New Zealand every single day Delhi 35 cases today. show enjoyable living it. Yet asking someone else question. honestly know much Germany's insurance system.

Correct brief Google locate guide employee‚Äôs gross salary, made 7.3% contribution employer 7.3% contribution employee.""... ""capped wages ‚Ç¨4,538 month, means anyone pay ‚Ç¨360 month (with employer paying ‚Ç¨360)""

That's $847.84 per month, max, split employer, right? USA pay $720/month employer pays another $1200/month. whatever random billings occur result actually using insurance. 2yo surgery months back. bills started rolling in. far we've owed $1800 insurance picking $24k bill.

That last bit, thing Germany well? Random unknown pricing portions covered insurance? insurance premium total cost? certain political ideology run police fire departments, hire own.

freemasons? ‚ÄúCombating misinformation‚Äù nice euphemism removing peoples‚Äô voices don‚Äôt like hear. Yes, science science. Masks work, vaccines good etc. etc. get it. 

Just honest yourselves. You‚Äôre authoritarian doesn‚Äôt support freedom speech. would rather let people make decisions run lives

Looks like one thinking Israel actually  really make mad, lol.  post two parents saying kid sacrifice they're willing take prevent mask requirements? could totally making up, doubt would say that. GOING WRITE BUMB THOUGHT EVERYONE WOULD THINK TYPO

THANK YOU!  Narrator: refused. agree. good thing Pfizer said produce strain specific mRNA vax within 90 days discovered. I'd wager foreseeable future, getting 6 months boosters, similar flu, looking strain prevalent. Yeah, US Open covid even understand human psychology virus works ? order method work would legit need almost 100% compliance. dropped head kid that's legit impossible expect whole world shut ? FML Science math *can* teach critical thinking, designed way. problem current structure regurgitating facts questioning them. say 5+5, bark ""10"".

There good presentation Conrad Wolfram (of Wolfram Alpha) this. Basically, teach math wrong. math that's done nowadays business science done computers, nobody long division hand. often lot things like ""based current rate sales, long takes get order in, many widgets keep stock order ensure always widgets sell? costs $X/day store widget, profit margin $Y, point worth risking running Widgets lose money opportunity cost storing something else might profit margin? optimize 500 item catalogue."" Thing is, writing formulas hard human, solving tedious slow. word problem gibberish computer, smart-watch could balance resulting equations one processor recursively tied behind back. 

The point retool math converting word problems equations (""critical thinking""), teaching computers solve actual number-y bits punching numbers TI-83, filling spreadsheet formulas, scripting mess Python SQL data analytics. ‚Äúbumb‚Äù 

Pretty sure ‚Äúbumb."" Jesus fucking christ, think society moved past least worst things yet again. There's 29 million Texans. ""hundreds"" this, that's pretty good. assume logic less likely infected vaccinated wait get tested likely test positive.

An unvaccinated person higher risk needs identified ASAP. Generally people find exposure happened. test later confirm negative result. makes liberals mad

Good thing realize goppers dying make liberals mad. Underrated comment. Indeed, need improve sound bite subject.

BTW... serious co-morbidities *and* less efficient immune system. Time watch classic films last 80 years. see. Makes sense. think I'll take extra day case. can't wait approved healthcare workers. Also told friend want live house get vaccine. need go take him. gets approved soon everything 1 day. work corporate finance business works..this comment sounds good since people automatically big business. don‚Äôt work big company, either.   Time medical tourism Covid proactive state absolutely need vaccinate many people possible soon possible. Even cannot get herd immunity two doses vaccines right now, important slowing spread, preventing severe disease, allowing layers protection control virus. important saving hospital systems many states already overwhelmed, shutting ERs canceling important non-emergency medical procedures. 

But still need effective vaccines (even third doses existing vaccine) long-term success. Delta contagious asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic spread Polio AFAIK, making contact tracing much difficult. vaccine needs significantly effective polio vaccine control without shutdowns mask requirements. 

But certainly even perfect vaccines useful people take them. MMR two doses like 97% effective preventing disease (which seems comparable results third dose covid, that's exciting), still occasionally outbreaks areas people getting vaccinated. measles much contagious even Delta, need something like 95% vaccination get herd immunity even vaccine effective; that's required Delta. Maybe could start opposite disinfo campaign telling parents children sterile get Rona. vaccinated disease. can't vaccinated addiction. deserve treatment, even burdensome medical system. 

It's fair comparison all. 11. dad didn‚Äôt want see it...thought I‚Äôd feel bad shark dies!&lt;. wasn‚Äôt worried feeling bad people die!&lt;. That's tall claim that's backed solid data yet, here's article explaining flaws studies, amount labs, mice, close enough human analog prove much disease actually produced humans infection actually caused spike proteins live virus. also noted there's evidence spike proteins covid-19 vaccines appear possibly protect vascular damage results wife pregnant, vaccinated. risks baby gets breakthrough infection? I'm reading breakthrough infections leading long COVID people. mean baby get long COVID even born? Here's why: island country population small city. varies area though. Canada, we're currently 75% 12-17 year olds least 1 shot 58% fully vaccinated (even though started allowing 12-17 year olds vaccinated mid-May). comparison, 12+ first shot number 82%, suggests 12-17 age group vaccinating nearly much others despite late start.

Bear mind kids often depend parents get vaccinated. usually strict requirement (especially 12+), even kids might opportunity get vaccinated without parents taking them. even case 12, often can't medically consent thus depend parents consent behalf. US crazy issues anti vaxxers that's gonna heavily affect youth vaccine rates. That's nearly pronounced outside US. Though same, lots kids really get choose this. Let them. Darwin needs fed.  Whats hilarious think side theyve seen internet memes never actually listened act. r/Christianity pretty liberal (lots really great people there). people subreddit likely ""end times"" prophecies. want talk people deep ""end times"" stuff go TrueChristian subreddit. That's find Evangelical Conservatives. (I'm liberal Christian myself, rhetoric TrueChristian subreddit pretty upsetting me). think it‚Äôs like beginning pandemic concentrated. There‚Äôs research showed people didn‚Äôt believe (paraphrasing) covid people close get sick die it, changed minds attitudes towards covid. think quickest realistic way pandemic probably many covid deniers anti-vaxxers get covid quickly possible. problem collateral damage everyone else, it‚Äôs probably quickest way. much easier, simpler, quicker cheaper get vaccine?! find odd one actually find quote saying it? think confusing immunocompromised people very, rare cases people allergic ingredients vaccine. There's absolutely nothing would stop immunocompromised person vaccinated. problem doctors think know everything medicine understand human body. trained research often understand science research went giving distilled facts memorize.

They view experts, hear something conflicts remember one lesson topic, assume they‚Äôre hearing wrong.

Throw political tribalism that‚Äôs super gross, understand it. Even people wearing clean scrubs, optics bad. one else store knows scrubs infectious disease ward optometrist. wish people would stop, I've told friends nurses worn scrubs store before.

I also feel way scientists open doors gloves on. time, called someone this, they'd say fresh pair, even we're taught open doors gloves. supposed habit one accidentally touches door handling hazardous materials.... People need common sense. So.... going catch this, vaccinated not? I'm mad... vaccinated getting tested today bc feel terrible. like planet anymore, I'm usually optimistic. damn frustrating. party restricting reach big government, really took power away local schools decide ü•¥  Meh. We‚Äôve already 650,000 deaths; what‚Äôs another 100,000. 

/s Amen! death count based death certificate takes time point someone dies, filled filed - especially huge backlog.  unvaccinated parents young children? worried children get ill? military deaths COVID vs population? coworker brought checked could refute correct. manage that? friends got J&amp;J turned away pharmacist approved protocol. friend part study? disclose got J&amp;J? Delta change lot, changed threshold ""controllable half assed measures"" ""really need work hard smart"". I‚Äôve seen argument made pandemics end socially end scientifically. Essentially- end people lose tolerance it. Policies influenced politics. Policies chosen based people clamoring for- restrictions fewer. Location ain‚Äôt Florida message relates applies. Florida follow example better result us regarding mess living in. Sorry coincidence ain‚Äôt first time things like happen posts. So, 100,000 deaths is. Wow....

At time:

4,816 infected, 11,985 impacted (quarantined?)

The school district population 241,859, makes impact 4.96% district thus far.... now, think moderna finished applying Full FDA approval, Pfizer working applying approval booster shot.  


the third vaccine dose currently approved vulnerable groups (ie. immunocompromised, cancer patients, solid organ transplant recipeints). think there's guidance general population getting third dose currently. wonder many people color ""experiment "" on. Mods take getting fact checked from? arbiters truth regard?  Capitalism bad things bad, okay? much $200/month increase terms typical insurance premium? would you? 100% increase? 50%? 10%? (God forbid insurance $2000/month per employee.) Oh know what, one sounds familiar too. guess there's many variations ""Don't go outside get sick""

... hold on. :o Can‚Äôt wait leave next year. want science accepted live really ridiculous lifetime freeze drop hat ok. Can't be.

Idk, there‚Äôs lot science effects gun control gun ownership.

Downvote want but, y'all fuckin whiners Jesus Christ. Literally wear mask can't handle it, nobody going around beating people wearing ones certainly go around beating us calm fuck wear really upset this.

Nobody even enforces shit, fuck places case numbers really lower vaccinated areas

I know media line blame Bubba, look simple. VT, highest-vaccinated state US, also highest case growth rate US. CA, national average, high case rates.

We find get fall winter, respiratory disease cases traditionally skyrocket northern parts country. state put mandates back, feels like mental health blow. 

I last year cause necessary hope. ‚ÄúHang til vaccine‚Äù. happy that. hung on, got two shots, kept wearing til said didn‚Äôt need to. mostly safe. 

There‚Äôs hope time. There‚Äôs nothing hang to. There‚Äôs metric. There‚Äôs vague terms like ‚Äúunder control‚Äù. reiterate extremely low risk. risk willing take allowed take. 

It really feels like forever now. Hopeless :/  article makes sound like lot coming people confused department's Covid protocols.

If that's true, kind understand it. last 12 months, office different protocols exposure w/ symptoms; exposure without symptoms; exposure post-vaccine; symptoms without test; re-entry positive test; re-entry unconfirmed Covid; etc. 

At times we've behind CDC guidance; times ahead it; still times we've policies invented thin air. 

So, yeah, people pretty confused point.

That said, still understand sheriff's department tracking vaccination status, unless that's DeSantis' pro-Covid plans. Christmas right around corner, like last year. Imagine governor(s) actively measures prevent children getting sick, using numbers blame Biden democrats poor Covid response.  note statement SEVERE. would say put ventilator pretty fucking horrible, uh even sure severe even looks like that. guess outright dropping dead? positive? ass holes insist posting stories pay read?

Oh yes, members stories tell. Desiree gets share bear next. Hospital administration seems common thread every nurse burnout story I've seen. think they're getting enough flak. employer several months ago hassling employees wearing masks Zoom calls. people sitting home company wanted wear masks working. stupid. Less testing less cases, president style. play devil's advocate minute, difference particular example whether law legally formally passed. formal law passed anywhere works know around wearing wearing masks certain places. fact may even out-of-date laws require wear masks/sunglasses/hats/etc public places? 

In words, authorities could actually step enforce decisions (seat belts, etc) enough issues arose time different areas resulted public concern voiced proper channels proposed laws voting etc. process typically follow process. obviously time here, valid difference ""rule"".

And u/carefreeguru comment below, regarding dress code well-known ""no shirt shoes service"" deal, also different. private establishment/entity make rules different public school. also different situation. can't say thing. 

People get edge defensive SEEMS like small group person (president, governor, city council, whatever) circumventing established careful process creating laws fairly per Democracy. Especially decision affects personally. 

I saying suggest people resist wearing masks schools. not. think extremely important right try understand people saying upset. least little bit. think mandates unconstitutional infringing anyone's rights, firmly believe best interest public health safety. ONE thing trying right literally change whole bunch people's closely guarded worldviews pandemic best response it. getting point get many remaining, need understand conversation. empathize. 

If loudest response also make facts connect dots exactly exist, increases divide limits progress... 

take leave guess gas dumpster fire. Vaccine passports would also work.

Yes, breakthrough infections, vaccines...

1. 66% effective preventing infections altogether (75% effective preventing symptoms)

2. reduce long infected people contagious, reducing spread.

3. reduce infectious someone is, even viral load.

If going allow unvaccinated, masked people space, makes sense (and lower risk) give option places require vaccination allow people go unmasked. recirculate air. children apparently One lesson I‚Äôve learning sociopaths/psychopaths realize specialize blending in.

Shitty people exposing kids refusing vaccinate flooding hospital one side, terrible hospital administration intensify burnout other. Move civilized state. course. necessary, countries like US could probably keep giving vulnerable shots every 6 months. Everybody else lower priority, breakthrough case mild, likely produce strong immune response. Also, last year‚Äôs February peak powered immense spread November-December-NYE holidays. many people peak immunity span, I‚Äôm hopeful it‚Äôll cut peak knees. think much rejected authorities subject right. even matter point. show dozen different sources say vaccines safe toss every single one exact thing CDC saying already reject every single thing CDC says.  teams scientists mathematicians analyze limited data advisories go public. confidence misplaced. would add: 3. crazy voters winning office true believers rather power-hungry assholes giving crazy lipservice.  lieu universal healthcare system, support companies passing along cost providing healthcare actively choose avoid actual healthcare.

Yet keep ignoring fact airlines passed cost shitty business practices onto taxpayer. billions dollars received enough provide health insurance workers.

Instead want scheist workers using COVID-19 shield dirty business practices.

I assure executives paid well enough afford healthcare vaccinated not.  Ya man, medication vaccines awesome, 10/10 times I'll choose easy way comes health. Eating well, exercising, taking medications need rather needlessly suffering. fairly straightforward. brush teeth floss every day prevent dental issues, shower hygiene, get vaccines prevent getting really fucking sick. beat COVID, longterm effects, die. 

This virus roll dice, death important metric. COVID decimate internal organs people even mild symptoms. surviving children never same. Natural selection job seems seriously suggesting that.

lmao Chinese media plastering bullshit story like ""Covid number surged Afghanistan right US military left."" ""leaked US research paper detailing coronavirus years outbreak"" rate surprised fair amount Chinese people genuinely believe American behind whole pandemic. yet, parents seem throwing kids back school without care. virtual get vaccinated winter. *at least* masked vigorously enforced.

And yet... Yes, worms catch covid?    Happened aunt last summer. came Orlando bury her. Funeral within day, viewing. Fifteen minute eulogy, graveside prayer. Done.  


Two days later found six people funeral COVID positive. talking different restaurants. know quite places that, earlier summer least, needed make reservation 2-3 weeks get into. good places.  starts change, imagine will/is already starting, instituting vacc requirement would likely get business pick back up, covid worries reason demand dropping.

Most people go restaurants, know never such. think even afford it. talking everyday general person sit restaurant can't afford turn away customer especially shutdown last 15 months so. Sadly, right, agree you, I'm able say sometimes matter slight nuance reflection, none applies people get fucking shot. One dose arsenic never catch covid again. late 1900s

That still can't wrap head around normal vaccine.

That dose something work well.

It works better hoped developed.  rare cases breakthrough infection, rare person need hospitalized.

So beat dead horse, rare=breakthrough infection. Rarer Breakthrough infection requires hospitalization. two gateways. world would call working What's say covid shots wipe covid out?

Thanks! mother anti vaxx moving Florida soon, hoping better news. still thinks HCQ viable covid treatment though doubt she'd take whatever scientifically proven effective...   better call Abbott tell update disaster proclamation.  get really annoyed reasoning happening people ""stupid"".

This type shit happen Denmark Switzerland. 

Is claim Americans genetically likely stupid people Denmark? 

The question asking Americans raised mindset believe told told stupid shit. 

It's two levels social problems play, shit ass, funded heavily propagandized educational system. profit propaganda networks people like Dennis Prager millions people listen advice he's rich, want rich like him. 

Stop letting propaganda networks politicians type thing blaming individuals it, start pointing finger socio-economic system creates material conditions allow even table first place. movie this?  Someone almost exactly like except born day earlier much issue getting third shot. 62.9% Florida vaccinated compared 61.7% America. yes, average. Given America whole lower Florida suffering badly right now, reason concerned, we? expect business create account get approved order check someone status present covid card? Ye sorry realistic.  certain point realize nothing say change mind. can't reason someone decision reason into. **‚Äùthis freedom looks like‚Äù** ‚Äî 21st Century American Proverb.  sorts would never approved FDA even. Long story short, Florida changed way report deaths recent two weeks data remotely accurate. hope so! visit r/FloridaCoronavirus daily feel terrible them.

Wasn't testing capacity lower storms? sub saying bunch testing sites closed down. sure much impacted numbers did, wonder that's started looking better bit. Exactly! right next Facebook jail always complain  Vaccines 90% effective! WANT BESIDES HORSE üê¥ PASTE?!?!? feeling getting ready see lot wackos discharged next months quite honestly best thing military. wealth gap! We‚Äôre killing expanding that! Yep gotta sneak via Canada want  business check vaccination status currently PR reasons. new hype thing areas.

Disagree. Restaurant business example got around 10% profit margin. notice profit dropping, drop requirement. 

We talking different restaurants. know quite places that, earlier summer least, needed make reservation 2-3 weeks get into. *very* good places.

If starts change, imagine will/is already starting, instituting vacc requirement would likely get business pick back up, covid worries reason demand dropping. Please tell evidence vaccination helps stop spread. reports seen show vaccinated symptoms viral loads actually spread viruses stay community instead home. ‚ÄúConvince antivaxxers?‚Äù

Jesus: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm out.‚Äù crazily enough probably progressive state country 45 years ago. Ok, pointed data reporting always, everywhere, noisy Florida stopped reporting every day. 7-day average flat 2 weeks. People today scary. 

You suggest wear mask, physically assaulted. suggest take mask, physically assaulted. Access. majority world even gotten first dose people already talking third. Still Bernie 2016 shirt packed box. Maybe someday wont hurt much look at. Everything could different. live New England,

Our schools start later south. schools started all. That's going real indicator northeast. think mid sept/early oct going seeing northeast numbers climbing bad way. That's 200 million BTW  think both. eased restrictions inevitable virus would spread like crazy among unvaccinated. reason rate spread *among unvaccinated* slower first days pandemic. Delta reportedly contagious would make spread even faster. But, again, among unvaccinated. Counterpoint: kid school, zero ""skin"" game tax dollars. health/wellbeing that's put risk. without kids feel deserve heard, given ability talk brick wall told pound sand. boating accident?   hope that‚Äôs case. would prefer X-ray vision though. He‚Äôs idiot. trying figure would snowball. Florida oxygen, logistically would draw surrounding states. surrounding states pozzed COVID number; would give away oxygen know invariably need comin months? Welp, really know much gore movie, comment made ignorance.


If actually watched it, would know really much gore all. fact amt people shown eaten less would think, 2 remember correctly, one showed large amount blood, might possibly considered gore. Next time comment know talking about. outcomes kids? ""When factoring reports included students staff single statistic, number people quarantining isolation rose least 154,000."" -- that's lot quarantining, due data compiled almost certainly undercount . People kids totally required get vaccines past employment, schooling travel. clothing requirements either, always walk grocery store butt ass naked wanted /s.

Nothing changed, abiding laws longer us alive. Florida set daily record yesterday - 26,203 cases. Sad takes husband get covid, end hospital husband die finally decide vaccine safe take...  death youth gun violence can't lead meaningful legal reform several decades, doubt kids dying invisible virus better change behaviors unintelligent. You‚Äôre joking, right? Links CA FL databases

CA - cairweb.org

FL - flshots.com

As HIPAA, grossly misunderstand law works. would illegal check status without permission, nothing illegal asking permission check status denying whatever you‚Äôre wanting refuse. I'd start calling place got shot refer there. 

When thought caught virus earlier actually get tested symptoms? lot people got cold flu something assumed Covid can't sure unless tested.

If unsure, call urgent care see want come in, do, go. im sure strict gun controls X school shooting.

as long kids dead, dont give damn; even kids dead, still dont care.    gone full mask cycles. personal decision traveling places one wore masks places everyone did.

What sort realize lot seem match reports life go on. realize risk crashing driving still drive, sometimes make decisions wear depending driving conditions.

By way always wore n95 mask beginning scoffed majority people wore useless paper masks many papermask wearers scoff wear masks.

So drop personal animosity. help.

Accept like common cold viruses around forever.

Its probably important go involved funding creating fewer chances new ones coming out. like cut risk death 20% without antibodies affect antibodies. 

Maybe reading right would think way actors pushing drug - super cure.  people dumb pharmas earn billions billions  **The 70s intensifies** selfish boosters going bring normalcy back vaccinated. business check vaccination status currently PR reasons. new hype thing areas. Many business can't suggesting, even high end restaurant might stop high end decide to. Restaurant business example got around 10% profit margin. notice profit dropping,they drop requirement. Take LA example, LA 25k restaurant. realistic check quickly business. That's I'm saying. surgical mask might provide 15% protection wearer. properly fitted N95/KN95 might 90%. wore reusable respirator w/P100 filters pre-vaccination.   That's said vaccines right yet forced still wear masks even though already vaccinated. lot people systems could point finger say ""that's reason we're mess"", thing enrages American healthcare system still driven profits. 

If federal government control system, could allocate doctors, nurses, resources wherever *needed*, could make money.  days either way matter. People 6 months encompassed shorter month February slightly shorter intervals intervening months days longer, example, exact date get vaccine measurable impact efficacy. agree graphed complete. Presenting incomplete data bueno. I've included precise statement FDA regarding Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. artificial sense protection hospitalization selfish sense that's concerning. changed fact child 13 level protection. Someone fully vaccinated infect children, infected children experience full effect\*\* virus, regardless mild symptoms vaccinated person infected them. kept many children safe use masks social distancing. Unfortunately, methods protection dis-assembled politicians view impacted ""the cost business"".  

\*\* Lethality and/or aftereffects depends person's immune system response virus along pre-existing health conditions.  

To precise : 

A: data support EUA Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine include analysis 36,523 participants ongoing randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled international study, majority U.S. participants, completed 2-dose vaccination regimen evidence SARS-CoV-2 infection 7 days second dose. Among participants, 18,198 received vaccine 18,325 received saline placebo. vaccine 95 percent effective preventing COVID-19 disease among clinical trial participants 8 COVID-19 cases vaccine group 162 COVID-19 cases placebo group. 170 COVID-19 cases, 1 vaccine group 3 placebo group classified severe. 
 
The data support BLA approval Comirnaty included similar data sets EUA, longer duration follow-up larger patient population. data support BLA approval include analysis effectiveness data approximately 20,000 vaccine 20,000 placebo recipients ages 16 older evidence COVID-19 infection within week receiving second dose. Based results clinical trial, vaccine 91% effective preventing severe COVID-19 disease.  saying false?  doesnt specify referring covid cases viruses general article misleading.

There‚Äôs 100 days left December. would mean current wave cases continues flat 3 months straight. Regardless we‚Äôve done virus followed wave function pattern. 

The number deaths December year fluctuated dramatically course year.

In likelihood deaths drop soon current wave pass. that's layman going interpret graphs. people going look today's number relation past numbers. way reporting now, always going look like numbers trending even exact opposite true. honest, graph recent \~1.5-2 weeks, since data time frame incomplete compared past data. extremely misleading way present data, especially public consumption. Hell, would misleading present way experts, I'd think anyway sloppy best. Nah friend look trend new Google John Podesta Spirit Cooking Realistically number people care ask ""How much vaccine protect me"" ""If exposed covid, much less likely get sick vaccine."" Plenty 99.9% whatever vaccinated people covid also gotten exposed, says something viral prevalence vaccine efficacy much. Masks mandates lockdowns went away transmission showed, came numbers started going again. 

The peaks come down, like before. Texas did. likely hold court tho prevent kids getting it? Like vaccine constant breakthroughs? study built previous research showed RNA ‚Äî part genetic material inside COVID-19 virus ‚Äî persist month dust. study, researchers collected dust residence hall rooms campus housed students known infected COVID-19.

More good news. know Rocky Mountain NIH facility work last year persistence various surfaces, first I've seen concerning lasting long, outside human body. Por??? Pendejos someone explain cases much worse last year time still won‚Äôt shut anything down? ridiculously generalized statement offers nothing table. everyone vaccinated outdoor transmission rare, what‚Äôs danger exactly?

Answer question directly instead making extremely reductive argument boils ‚Äúwe gotta stay safe guys cmon!‚Äù. whether immunocompromised completely honor system. even ask what's making that.

With vaccines thrown thousands third country outright refusing them, burdened ethical issue lying jump line. Pfizer's anticipated timeline trials complete September emergency authorizations 12 (I think 5-12) late September October NA/EU, expectation 2 October November. (The additional 2 months follow data 4 months children). Since multiple agency process nothing cemented stone. posted couple links back - I'll see find edit comment. Here's reaffirmed timeline expectation Pfizer (for context, previous EUA took 2 weeks go effect November December). probably bolstered full FDA approval received well.

I followed closely, think recall Moderna's timeline early next year, might referring to. jump number reported cases deaths due newest way deaths cases counted. CDC implemented change earlier month, causing occasional one-day aberrations like 901 additional deaths Thursday 726 deaths reported Monday. Notice absolutely cannot bring say schools safe children

Yes - think schools safe children. Obviously risk free never been.

And online learning never anywhere near good. younger children never able emotional develop gain social skills. WIFI major problem thousands homes adequate WIFI. Parents go work looks children? Inequality increase. Lack additional help children disabilities children diagnosed. That's scratches also credible health expert predicted Delta bad kids is. 

The Delta variant much worse children relatively - proper study proved that. Children still remain extremely low risk least impacted age group - that's since pandemic started. 

Obviously support given teachers important thing children class getting good education Amazing news! chipping southern tip Africa say familiar phrase Exactly. People understand reusing arguments try convince people buy public health measures work last time work time. somebody wear mask May 2020, August 2021. somebody care ""science"" says first place, going bothered telling following science. 

So many ""public health"" advocates concerned right right outcomes happening. baseball analogy, like batting game line 0 3 umpire giving opposing pitchers favorable low strike calls game, adjust try hit low pitches called strikes instead striking looking trying argue umpire wrong. feel sorry people Lousiana Mississippi, especially kids relatives can't get vaccinated. 

No one deserves this. Narrator: wasn't. thinking running President 2024 

Abbott running re-election Governor 2022.   think, lot sharpest tools shed, they'll probably go back living moms ""keyboard warriors"" something like that. Deaths distribution live Ohio lot people spend winters Florida summers Ohio. They‚Äôre called Snowbirds. interact work National chain pharmacy. saying won‚Äôt going back. real estate market roof. They‚Äôre moderately wealthy people we‚Äôd love business year long.  sympathy healthcare workers put horrible situation due politics. disgrace don‚Äôt blame resigning.  That's true, cases plummeting delta came around. Another 100k seems conservative.

Perhaps even defining characteristic conservative. think that‚Äôs minuscule, wait till hear many vaccinated people dying.  people waiting till 8 months like directive said, ~6 week window give take demand extremely high really wanted vaccine getting second dose late March early May. Demand might get stretched bit then, otherwise expect bad.  someone blaming deaths inNY Florida? source that? said article due CDC changing way deaths reported. morgues normally serve patients deceased facilities, run morgues counties ? small counties, hospital, morgue, medical examiner. utilize facilities nearby larger county. Don‚Äôt forget educated yogi friends. would want 80 year old aunt feel like go hospital safely anything happens. think FL alone contributing 200 deaths day likely correct. That's official number take time label excess deaths properly negative record beat civil war. NAh, really shitty way florida announcing deaths actively trying kill them.  numbers first dose, fully vaccinated. need get worked it. Either way, vaccination rate average, even barely so. TBH would surprised antivax MIL called CPS us bday party 1 year old. [Still way go pass US, we're gold standard Worldwide numbers looking really nice too. That's kinda point. collectively we, *the goddamn adults* need behave like adults help protect otherwise little ability themselves. actively getting way. I‚Äôm beginning understand disorienting propaganda disinformation be. I‚Äôve always thought Cold War relic, we‚Äôre living Probably place kept saying ""the number cases matter people dying covid"" hundreds die. 

And right next said "" covid flu, get recover life goes on"" long haulers suffer indefinitely.  That's true disease absolutely devastated large parts Asia Africa. wild thought; great filter humanity, described Robin Hanson, actually collective individualistic nature inherent gullibility? Iceland 77% population fully vaccinated zero deaths Covid since May. stake / influence tax dollars. (and should!) vote school board elections. know poster up-thread said idea tested courts - maybe non-starter, would take specific legislation enact - problem participating school board meetings limited parents guardians children school. One can't tell someone interpretation religion wrong long say understand believe in. got first shot Pfizer today pretty bad hypochondriac. looked online people dying receiving vaccine mind gone deep end. Could someone please make feel better.. Don‚Äôt want protect themselves?? Make make sense üò≠üò≠üò≠ certainly feel wife wish coworker (granted, I‚Äôm nurse) I‚Äôm crappy person Well count infections bad we're fucked, vaccines vaccines masks masks.  point shown even vaccinated people get virus, changes severity symptoms. statistics symptoms severity useful listing number total infected pointless point. asymptomatic could countless. foolish   wish people would take one second think through. They're ones envision stepping Lego read number wounded battle. can‚Äôt start setting aside 25% (or whatever) emergency room, ICU, hospital space covid infected wait line instead everyone else? 

I mean, doesn‚Äôt plan get us closer normal? live like indefinitely since unvaccinated get severely ill over? Completely agree. in, 86% effective 2? doesn‚Äôt compute brain. human behavior

Human behavior ultimately thing needs controlled laws aspects, Americans hard time accepting whatever reason. bizarre remnant belief innate human goodness whatever, well good little benefit situations dependent change mass level. what's going happen children suffer long term medical problems, pull bootstraps?? mutations spike big part problem antibody binding efficiency reduced already made delta-specific versions, [trials  Agreed, +/- days going make difference. likely see date ranges based around testing like second dose. Yeah listen governor let kids wear masks. 



/s also says name correctly. 

Just gets one two things right make okay.  Americans believe personal responsibility personal freedom selfish f√∑=ks there. enraged can't enter local Starbucks without horrible inconvenience covering mask nose. C'mon, get priorities straight!

Thus, Dear Auntie (The BBC's colloquial affectionate reference itself) falls gutter level Scare-mongering Tabloid Journalism.

Stop sensationalizing types stories. Actually pizza looks infected Idk you‚Äôve ever seen sopranos, it‚Äôs like Paulie Walnuts asking heard joke said repeating word word. add /s obviously ridiculous statement, crowd ain‚Äôt today. source article.

People make antibodies worry hospitalized virus country sucks ass protecting via adequate number shots.  No. No, cannot. Seriously. believe medicine, going fucking hospital first place??? able find source clearly states numbers, I‚Äôd love could share it. likely way worse. shady. others states report large daily amounts, Florida show 8 deaths day?

It come randomly. Check doctor continuing breathing issues. run tests help rule things out. pulse oximeter, check O2 saturation levels. it, California tax dollars good pass up. One time saw guy trip fall shoelaces came untied always leave house barefoot.

This sound like. Moderna basically that.

Also Pfizer would need run new tests get higher doses approved.  all-natural, even! vaccines also substantially reduce [data state New York showed vaccine effectiveness dropping 91.7 **79.8% infection**, although vaccine continued protect Can't wait get 3rd shot, I'm 4 months 2nd. :( actually worried transmitting antivaxer? point, get hospitalized covid, them.

And they'll spread X number people, spreads exponentially, spreads higher chance mutating something makes vaccine ineffective, becomes dangerous vaxxed people. 

We need think societally, individually. I'm universal Healthcare, better everyone.
But US systeme best choice them. Still early try predict anything VTs numbers. would take six weeks get GAs numbers. Also, breakouts outcomes. 123 people got bad cold yesterday VT vaccine still working. 

We need info VT. Good try, [infected fetuses die 

I get coming, however. madness, driven ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù crowd. Ah yes another Florida scumbag. They‚Äôre confused. They‚Äôre arrogant.  seen number high delta times, even countries lots fresh 2nd doses. Denmark basically finished vaccinating young got 80ish percent.

2nd dose almost 95% *original virus* though. *also* wondering many children going develop life-altering medical issues/disabilities result COVID infections. Saying vaccines bad isn‚Äôt fraud fucking moron. I‚Äôm sure mean? Bill Gates gonna get us! :O This. 

I've never lived anywhere else born raised here. family here. choose location based politics culture...well, guess chose really.

If legitimately could get away move somewhere taking Covid seriously generally aligned political beliefs, I'd jump chance. honestly think would best interest even Covid over. However, lot think about, unfortunately prohibits moving. I'd love though. much smaller fraction unvaccinated? ::raises hand:: sorry sorry first vaxxed december headed Florida Well that's two months ago... kinda think go get one. found microchips! /s  Terrifying. similarly-aged family friend currently COVID know got school else. Another thing I've heard mentioned people getting vaccinated, believe mentioned someone NPR segment, they're healthy, good shape think need vaccination. another segment heard, preacher said thought got sick hospitalized, oxygen now, going stairs feels like running long distance.

It's weird (and scary disturbing) people locked earlier information disease, adjust thinking even date information changes, virus changes. Important note, according article: Moderna confirmed receiving ""several complaints particulate matter"" vaccine vials distributed Japan said found ""no safety efficacy issues"" related reports. wow fifth time get vaccinated 9 year old first day back school. decided double up.

We fucked. study conducted USC collaboration L.A. County Department Public Health found that, cohort 1,200 adults, unvaccinated people likely go bars clubs, visit friends family home attend gatherings, vaccinated people likely unvaccinated people wear face masks avoid large gatherings shaking hands.

I think pretty much knew information without study, is. Good them. deserve every penny. Hell yes. Tired shamed living lives. people lock forever want, vaccinated people moving whether like not. Yes initially said 60-70% sometime 2020 says gave number polling showing 50% Americans would get vaccine. revised estimates upward appeared willingness get vaccine. end 2020 saying 75-85% broader range possibility 70-90%. estimate 75-85% immediately Delta. great grandfather died pellagra 1918. course family awfully poor.

:-( Also, spoke many vaccine delivery systems horizon; focusing largely ease transport (good helping rest world get vaxxed), everything vaccine pills inhalants (which could help folk cool needles decide get vaxxed). seem like really big deals me; especially transportability.

Maybe mention it, another benefit there's evidence nasal/oral vaccines might effective reducing transmission injected vaccines, albeit possibly cost less effective severe disease might still want both. think intuition immune cells nose separate enough need exposed vaccine directly learn fight virus immediately inhale instead gotten past initial line defense.  unfortunately covers less 25% people US 9/20 closer 9 months me.

Let guess, requiring people wear masks get vaccines running crap? Hmmm, sure going work. First, person lie say left card home. Second, EMTALA laws prevent care. Third, would like applied health cases?

Like giving us source code developing better, broader responses variants even developed mutations yet.

People remember vast majority previously infected cleared severe cases developed strong, broad immune responses, remember everyone so, human immune systems different, that's survival trait thats good thing - remember want risk several severe infections, organs get damage take much scarring fail. Get vaccinated. 

Third, interesting older people also developed increasingly robust complex response regardless severe. wonder key understanding older people died pervasively outside potential underlying preexisting conditions (many come simply aging) - like know severe fatal Covid-19 result overactive immune system responding proteins/enzymes shed replicating virus, perhaps there's innate mechanism human immune system ramps strength complexity immune memory response age ages. would make sense looked like targeted older people variants mild (had less viral replication), could indicate kids facing immune overreaction, takes certain level proteins/enzymes trigger it, adults sensitive immune system ages ramps ability make broader long term response, threshold met productive variants like delta kids also trigger reaction, complex, mature, memory based future response future challenges virus/variants.

Worst-case death estimates based two sets data sources; one provides age-based infection fatality rates (IFR), provides age-distribution data.

Age-based IFR: (this info also used CDC age-weighted death counts).

Age-based population bins WHO... pulled data year ago returned specific link (I think get service currently unavailable). also checked age-binned data county-level age data CDC others; seem jive.

&amp;#x200B;

Methodology

For initial, worst-case death estimate 3 million, performed weighted sums across age-bins age-based IFRs. multiplied population per bin times odds death per bin, sum up. 

Different binning, different methods averaging across differently sized bins yields wide range estimates (from 3 million 4.5 million... prefer lower estimate, part due improved treatments since IFR study completed, based finely grained age-bins could find (appx 3-years per bin).

For 670,000 estimate current, worst-case deaths, ran weighted sum unvaxxed population 98 million people, ran similar weighted sum 185 million vaccinated people... lower IFR vaxxed based 30-fold reduction death rates (averaged across age-bins... vaccine seems bigger positive effect age groups comprise lion's share deaths). 

For steady-state estimate 76,000 deaths per year, subtracted deaths we've already seen, deaths we'd see nobody else got vaccinated, ended 1.8 million people could still die vaxxed... since, point, they'd either vaxxed would've recovered previous infection, treated population though vaxxed, thus would suffer 30-fold reduction annual deaths relative zero mitigation zero vaccines.

The actual details little bit involved, think covers main components theories behind estimates.

Still, none issues would've escaped pretending CoViD beast. Mental health would've absolutely tanked we'd suffered 10 times many covid deaths 2020, businesses schools would've closed sheer panic instead caution.

On perspective treat covid like treat anything else; consider things listed freaked about:

Measles... less dozen deaths per year.

Tuberculosis... 542 deaths per year.

Chicken pox (pre-vaccine)... 100 deaths per year.

Sum nation-wide, annual deaths totals together got half Florida seeing one week. use guides, would effervescently clear CoViD bigger deal. Considering items, thesis would sound like: ""why duck machine-gun fire run away vending machines."" 
 
Moving car accidents; total deaths around 35,000 per year (from peak 60's would like100k per year today). reduction thanks endless improvements safety related regulations laws road. 

35,000 one cause hefty number, literally rounding error total deaths CoViD per year we've seen thus far. Also, car accident deaths suddenly hit 350,000 per year, nobody would surprised enormous, renewed outsized focus auto safety.

When push awareness include big killers, like heart-disease cancer, still see CoViD leading pack (at least Feb, brand new problem (CoViD) worse lockdowns worst nominal problems suffer without lockdowns problem going illicit significant response concern. importantly, actually could get CoViD deaths flu levels within less year (thanks vaccines), great place focus energy; we've already spent decades continue everything cure cancer stifle heart-disease, breh, could solve wearing masks standing apart year... worth it?

Also, broadly, agree mitigation strategies gotten less severe less frequent since peaks 2020, overall trend, thanks mostly vaccines, towards fewer less strict mitigation efforts? Like, there's ton rhetoric mitigation strategies keep getting worse, literally opposite reality. LA, MS, AL, GA, SC, NC, VA ""The South"" IMO, even NC VA probably Mid-Atlantic me.

First, antibodies one three major arms immune system keep us safe. There's innate immune system kills whatever seems suspicious, there's two arms adaptive immune system (humoral - antibodies, cellular - B cells). often defeat virus one three arms, cellular arm call humoral arm.

Then issues related overall antibody quality compounded antibody specificity (thanks differing strains). 

To come close anything like answer might want, believe loose general consensus (that considers factors) suggests somewhere around half peak antibody count acts bit cutoff otherwise maximal antibody efficacy; level, diminishing rates returns seem steep, diminishing.

So, yea, unless issues arms immune system, antibody count likely major concern, antibodies got, want boost prescribed medical professional. Yes. Thanks information. state making things hard see bad county trying hide skeletons closet. insurers this, it‚Äôll hilarious sounds really scary. hope recover really quickly think unvaccinated countries main danger terms prolonging pandemic.

Certainly part danger needs immediate attention large scale. balance pretty sure neighborhood considerably dangerous right would remain even ports entry shut.

You know else needs immediate attention? Global poverty. Tends export extremists one thing, certainly export new diseases future. Ah, also poverty backyard, causes kinds problems. I'm drifting topic now, nice day. course nurses education, I've got friend PhD Nursing. merely saying lower educational bar associate's. 10% nurses master's degree, 1% PhD. There's push nurses bachelor's minimum, believe there's shortage educational opportunities facilities required achieve that. people taking horse medicine instead vaccine. think smart. problem Fauci place statements this, said lot ambiguous contradictory things. confuses people. experts predicted 60%, seen Fauci say 60%-70%, though reported lot places say it. 

For example confusing been, he's stated one number hit herd immunity. Paywalled here, could read cell Friday interview McClatchy \[he\] argued there's ""no magic number"" coronavirus' herd immunity threshold.

And Fauci said herd immunity could START effect 50%, blanket herd wide-ranging interview Tuesday Morning Edition, NPR's Rachel Martin asked Fauci many Americans need receive vaccine impact number COVID-19 infections. 
 
""I would say 50% would get vaccinated start see impact,"" Fauci said. ""But would say 75 85% would get vaccinated want blanket herd immunity.""

&amp;#x200B;

And course he's changed stance level reach herd immunity given specific numbers. 

So surprising people confused he's saying, especially lots experts gave numbers around 60%.  Imagine lawyers lined up. Texas lawyer Full Employment Act!  time take healthcare workforce. government wants mandate health it. US leaving citizens wrong hands they're cowardly do. David Draiman might want word. stack high gravity takes over.   already massive manpower shortage? don‚Äôt need 100% protection time precautions 100% reduce chance spread contract virus. someone else room sick you‚Äôre going reduce chance spreads wear mask time.

What‚Äôs going happen tell people get vaccines? Promises going back normal taking back first sight cases rising? Yes. could staggered schedules, hired bus drivers, bought tents outside classrooms, idk. Something. Anything. Instead nothing. Nothing. God depressing Yes, does. Early studies showed vaccinated people protected getting also spreading early studies delta variant took hold. delta vaccinated unvaccinated carry amount virus pass on. Vaccinated folks protected severe illness part prevented spreading it. agree live children work them, responsible behavior would avoid high risk places like nightclubs

Or associate anyone does. Same. School employee heading back class Sept 7 6 months 9/21. Thinking getting ASAP.   Nursing schools really need re-evaluate course requirements.  Requiring one dumbed biology class working great. Damn. I‚Äôve seen coming I‚Äôm still sad. bad reaction second shot ended ICU couple days that‚Äôs even though would 1 million percent get boosters whenever safe so. I‚Äôve feeling wanting get going places (masked) immunity wears off. feels sad me. Expected entirely foreseeable I‚Äôm still sad upcoming however long I‚Äôll go back basically shut many many people can‚Äôt bothered gaf anyone themselves. Thank everyone can. don‚Äôt think unvaccinated kids back schools, understand it‚Äôs happening. parents kids home us year we‚Äôve also tried work home. We‚Äôve pushed breaking point beyond. Schools US basically serve daycare parents work. many us forced back offices, aren‚Äôt left whole lot options kids cared we‚Äôre working. NOO Like said use trigger sorts restrictions couple months ago 300 hospitalizations basis can‚Äôt strain hospitals bc potential collapse. it‚Äôs 1100 somehow still going? video released April 2020.
There ***tons*** warning refused act.  Stay safe well! think there‚Äôs lot fatigue setting it‚Äôs difficult see end point. herd immunity happen though - state 20million 80 million visitors year.  
With Covid able re-infect people already it, see Florida churning turnstile CV19 keep going worldwide. 
80 million visitors 2020 per dead, can‚Äôt get shy seeing pp lot highest death states high rates obesity. That‚Äôs huge contributing factor 60 covid deaths. Yeah cant imagine effective well enforced all. lol, kidding me? says RIGHT THERE: health care history

Vaccines health care (unless anti-vaxxer), getting vaccine **receipt health care**, part **medical history**. can't clearer that. really need list every medical procedure existence understand? someone refused get treated cancer initially catching early, still can't discriminated even increased risk factor hospitalization. discriminate women unprotected sex personal choice significantly increases risk factor hospitalization. 

And also fails similar situation may treat distinct groups employees similarly situated distinction based bona fide employment-based classification consistent employer‚Äôs usual business practice. Examples include full-time versus part-time status, different geographic location, membership collective bargaining unit, date hire, length service, current employee versus former employee status, different occupations. one time CDC estimated actual infection prevalence 4X 10X official rate. range uncertainty really know know shit.

With billions Covid relief dollars given FDA CDC think could large scale population testing nail down. number people country still risk Coronavirus infection seems pretty damned important thing want know charge fixing mess. CDC saying ""Shit really ahead thing, let's leak slowly announce hope people freak"". 

Going 8 6 new information means someone finally convinced powers ""Everyone needs boosters asap, upto cause chaos"".   get rid TX. Everybody thread acting like knew long. learn virus mean returning constant state lockdowns

Quite true, mean returning constant state lockdown. mean going series surgical, short term lockdowns New Zealanders used successfully. mean going constant, heightened state awareness.

It's either ICUs constantly full loved ones. News exist comfort you. make everything anti-vaxxers create outrage farm karma. reasoning fundamentaly flawed old always mean sick neither young means healthy. People widely different immunity levels, comorbidities exposure virus. things need considered. also clear need get better vaccines hopes get pandemic control. Boosters sustainable solution would make companies richer. matter time vaccine resistant strain starts outcompeting existing ones. really depends type nurse though. Education nurse range associates doctorate nursing. would interesting see vaccination rates various education levels nurses. Ohio, too, hospitalized twice. Tested flu twice, negative times. think that's egregious?! Look abbot banning vaccine mandates remember exact post. Maybe exact doctor recall doctor charging $100 per opt appointment. companies providing vaccines every country around world too? listened Joe Rogan try make myocarditis biggest deal talking Dr. Rhonda Patrick. People desperate hate vaccine reason taking military directed Anthrax shots, sequential dose spaced more. remember timeline like 12 years ago, doses spaced series went on, wonder means anything this. got 7 doses though point moved everyone getting deployment related course changed things.

Then again, could totally anecdotal irrelevant, take will. way expert stuff, random pin cushion ton experience getting whatever vaccines told due for. Jeebus crisp what‚Äôs wrong individual   tried post alternative link source.

The automoderator removed it.

So are. love coercive policies. People we're offered carrot 50% right thing, 50% prefer stick want cry rights. anti vaxer city told wasn‚Äôt letting college age kids get vaccine. 

In Denmark child 15-17 decide want vaccine. far everyone immunity next couple months, may happen take consideration reinfection. happen, especially many different variants circulating. protect severe outcomes best can, boosters may needed annually. guess I'm sure issue is? epidemiologists believe wearing masks boosting immune system may required next several decades, feel small sacrifice reduce impact virus common cold future generations. Huh, title interpreted two ways correct.  actually known bit that. numerous studies quantify extent masks reduce viral load, thereby reducing infection probability severity. folks Week Virology think boosters stupid idea ones. There‚Äôs little data effective boosters are, may turn breakthrough cases result less mask use social distancing Delta variant. 

Maybe vaccines effective they‚Äôve always been, less assistance masks restrictions.

Not mention ethical practical issues rich countries hoarding vaccines. biggest risk moving forward new variants best way manage get rest world vaccinated.  competition? corporate policy, choice get pay. daily deaths Florida Worldometers dropped considerably last days, whys that? reporting accurately now? Like saying earlier, vaccine essentially useless six months. Biden administration knew September-December going shit show people 6-8 month window, data confirmed it, hence change. Good Delta! end federal funding non-vaccinated. already 600K deaths US least quarter people still anti-vaxxer.

I think warning light would work. would rather get shot every 8 months wear mask. would get shot month never wear mask again. many come BC cabins summer. Abbott issued executive order Wednesday banning state local mandates requiring people vaccinated COVID-19, called Texas legislators vote law current special session. Texas Supreme Court declined block restraining orders Abbott‚Äôs mask mandate ban. Also, Texas Education Agency has, now, suspended enforcement mask mandate ban state‚Äôs public school systems.

My comment Delta's actions fundamentally violate \*principle\* insurance supposed - collectively pooling money members insurance pool subject \*average\* risk group. immaterial whether insure employees 3rd party like Aetna assume risk -- principle distributing risk across members same.

Within insurance pool, find unvaccinated people, high-BMI people, diabetic people, people risk-taking personalities, etc -- everyone level risk payout, yet everyone pays amount. soon start tying insurance premiums \*individual-risk levels\*, started slippery slope toward steadily eroding benefits insurance supposed provide. Unvaccinated people pay $200 more. High BMI people pay $75 more. Convicted felons pay $300 more. Etc. 

If unvaccinated people raised risk pool beyond Delta believes able pay, raise rates everyone (since 60+% likely vaccinated, would likely mean everyone pays $120 more, rather 40% unvaccinated paying $200 more). I'd frankly shocked $200 really amount needed cover increased risk -- feels like opportunity cash grab. Great point whole nasal vaccine thing; asked related question.

In end, noted injected vaccines lead secretory antibodies, likely form nasal sprays, combination technologies would likely post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Texas Canada. Cause oil. sure, it‚Äôs win protected people willing stand crazy government time  Yeah Florida state could find death rates cases much higher previous waves, even compared southern states bad bad. Yes, problem. America needs healthcare vaccine. America needs learn true wellness. Absolutely behaviors, along boosting, cause virus become less deadly. Reinfection provides immune memory, time allow humans fight severe disease. similar pattern many viruses follow. Frequent boosting allow us fight better. agree eventually infected. think end year. Probably next two months suggest cooler weather school. spread like wildfire almost impossible become exposed it. Moreso mask mandates effect everywhere. 

But also believe masking needed indefinitely, least lifetime, want keep severe disease deaths bay. Vaccines enough. Natural immunity one infection enough. needs combined social distancing, masks, changes behavior continue well beyond generation. Half population may agree. time, sickness death touched us way another, behaviors change. hoped would happen next 2-3 years. one appetite selfless, even survival depends it. also guess, that's literally used happen America lol. socialized essential services, like eventually Healthcare. think droplets flip images upside down? would flipping inverted flag, like fly show distress? so, extra neat symbolism! seeing southern states bit serious cases rising. think makes sense go back masking *hospitals unable accept transfers canceling scheduled surgery*. regions people ICU previous wave. 

But go ahead minimize it, makes feel good. point all. wait hold ""dangerous"" idea Masks optional, covid mandatory.  Well both, goal prevent death hospitalization though. virus mutates initial protection offered, prevents us even feeling sick, bypassed. especially true delta variant come contact it, it‚Äôs often huge amount virus, allow us get sick. Luckily, vaccine still go work delta. might take time build immune response, keeping us hospital allowing us feel little sick. also prevent symptoms delta well, depends. Fucking babies. hate Mandate vaccines work, school, passports state federal aid. Maybe tax refunds. Require leases mortgages. Create central database, large fines 30 days jail first offense, year second. also think needs higher health life insurance premiums people vaccinated.  reporting accurately now?

Nothing see here, move along. think it‚Äôs TWIV reacting pretty insane amount histrionics coming segment public health/epidemiology Twitter resultant pressure it‚Äôs putting officials make illogical restrictions procedures given level vaccination trends. 3rd round testing happening everyday week. colossal waste time, really best way prevent large outbreaks. vaccinate everything, don‚Äôt understand fuss now.  I've heard area's residents receive refrigerated trailer therapy, COVID completely eradicated. poor people find rule.   vaccinated, may infectious. possible rising number breakthrough infections simply matter people wearing masks crowded indoor spaces. coincidence breakthrough cases surged restrictions lifted? It‚Äôs entirely plausible early efficacy infection was, pun intended, boosted mask use social distancing, actual booster might better placebo, hey, go want, don‚Äôt complain get sick, would better booster anyway. 

Also, it‚Äôs TWiV folks saying this. guess you‚Äôre expert, right? Next going try mandate things like seat belts. brother Arkansas DIED wearing seat belt. Explain that! Delta delta need vaccine population like tomorrow. Work comp claims seen $10k $5mil. go ICU easily $1mil. WINNING! woman called abolishment private property. Nah pay debts parents die.

And can't afford medical bill big deal. I've skipped pretty large ones 6 figure range never fought it. work they'll let pay like $50 month even insane bill. rare actually get sued. Ditto. Sure, point according flight attendant friend works delta raise prices insurance usually giving workers small raise set anger price increase. isn‚Äôt delta good thing name solidarity vaccinated, it‚Äôs delta greedy exploiting angle can.  ‚ÄúThe new data released Tuesday involved 43,000 reported infections among Los Angeles County residents aged 16 older. them, 10,895, 25.3%, occurred fully vaccinated persons, 1,431, 3.3%, partially vaccinated persons, 30,801, 71.4%, unvaccinated individuals.

There would still thousands cases day essential workers. within 1-2 months we‚Äôd right back started. Doesn‚Äôt kinda show vaccines aren‚Äôt effective people say are?

We could make rough guess assume 20% people who've since received vax infected, well hadn't.

So, 98 million unvaxxed, almost 20 million convalescent immunity ('natural' immunity). Meaning we've got 78 million people level risk vaccines; could still lose bunch people, hurry... likely winter season. think we're good another 670,000 people die (fewer vaccines really take currently unvaxxed community)... we're year 'normal' (76,000 deaths per year) either way.  Best comment ever Nice!! already began Chile. Around 5% total population gotten third dose (AstraZeneca now). delta yet hopefully speed Delta hits vulnerable population boosters. couple husband‚Äôs work caved due requirements employees provide vaccine verification negative tests. better. think would want examine shorter window, too, assess delta/waning efficacy. long window would give better picture *cumulative* benefit vaccination. amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

Vaccine effectiveness COVID-19 infection dropped 91% 66% Delta variant became dominant strain U.S., [according new study published Tuesday decline points highly contagious nature Delta variant underscores importance vaccination prevent severe disease, hospitalization death, study authors wrote.

""While see reduction protection COVID-19 vaccine Delta variant, still two-thirds reduction risk,"" Ashley Fowlkes, lead author epidemiologist CDC's COVID-19 Emergency Response, told CNN.

The latest update part ongoing study follows health care workers, first responders essential workers undergo weekly testing eight locations across six states. weekly testing helps researchers better track rates people develop mild symptoms may less likely get tested overall, CNN reported.

Among 4,217 participations, 3,483 ‚Äî 83% ‚Äî vaccinated. 65% received Pfizer vaccine, 33% received Moderna doses 2% received Johnson &amp; Johnson shot. December 2020 April 2021, vaccines 90% effective preventing symptomatic asymptomatic infections.

Between April August, Delta variant became dominant efficacy began drop, though still infections. Researchers found 19 infections among 488 unvaccinated people, 95% symptomatic. also found 24 infections among 2,352 fully vaccinated people, 75% symptomatic. study include details type severity symptoms.

""It's still powerful vaccine,"" Fowlkes told CNN. ""But also looking towards continuing use masks little bit longer.""

The study team planning future analyses compare different COVID-19 vaccines types symptoms vaccinated unvaccinated people experience, CNN reported.

On Wednesday, Johnson &amp; Johnson reported second dose vaccine raises antibody levels coronavirus. participants received booster shot six months, spike-binding antibodies increased nine times higher first dose, company wrote statement.

Johnson &amp; Johnson submit data FDA, evaluating similar studies Pfizer Moderna. FDA could authorize booster shots Americans September, could available people eight months last vaccination, according New York Times .

The Johnson &amp; Johnson researchers also found booster shot increased supply immune cells body, attack cells infected coronavirus. results still prepared publication, newspaper reported.

As studies continue, vaccine companies still determining long increased antibody levels last booster shot.

If circulating good immunity always wanes, we'll get free boosters without getting shots. (exposure)

If maintain good immunity, get sick probably hospitalized. Maybe kind exposure gives long lasting immunity (decades). 

If like childhood vaccines, we'd need one, maybe two boosters, like year two apart. *maybe* lifetime immunity. 

If like shingles, need initial vaccine, someday figure need special booster, that's it. Probably lifetime immunity.

Exactly many years many deaths *you* propose waited? . source says 66% I'm pretty sure he's talking efficacy severe disease

No, infection. states clearly. Efficacy severe disease However efficacy preventing severe disease isnt right metric calculating R values,

I agree. ~66% infection. also need take account decreased contagiousness vaccinated, also effectively make efficacy make whole calculation pointless assumes vaccine 85%/95% effective stopping people catching spreading COVID?

Naw, point teach people calculations (with whatever numbers want) gauge effects various measures. /r/aboringdystopia vaccination efficiency correct. always compare amount break cases total amount people vaccinated determine effective vaccine dont many vaccinated people exposed covid . article explains vaccinated people take serious try avoid exposure  Watch everybody, got Deadpool here! ü§£  no.

Delta done lots goalpost moving. adapt situation. Also, goals individuals differ. people consistently wanted eradicate covid people simply wanted prevent serious disease get vaccines. different people different goals mean people moving goalposts. fair, applies antivaxers. There's many different reasons people antivaxers vaccine hesitant. time last year, hoping vaccine could clear 50% efficacy floor severe disease death

That considered bare minimum wanted first vaccines. never considered medium long term goal, something good enough slow bleeding better things made. end day, that's vaccines supposed do. 

Ideally vaccines used reach herd immunity. That's always something people expected vaccines eventually. hear people arms flu shot generally 30-40% effectiveness rate

Really? People regularly get flu vaccines think they're effective enough worth time. years unexpected strain vaccines particularly ineffective societies get hammered flu, people notice hospitals feel pressure. biased sub. good poll vote conversion. forget name guy &amp; show/channel, video guy went sturgis last year interviewed anti-maskers covid hilarious.

he's like curly headed white dude, iirc, lot videos

edit:

found it, ""All gas brakes"" sturgis link  grandstanding jazz handing distract anyone there's mountain dead dying right behind everyone see. Americans covid pay fees - would vote differently next time this? So, week ago, tropical storm coming one Florida thought particular threat, DeSantis declared state emergency many counties Florida. declaration, course, got *lot* coverage Florida.

Around time, changed way Florida reports covid deaths. used they'd report day concluded covid death. someone died Monday took ten days declare covid death, would reported covid death following Wednesday.

Anyway, local news cycles eaten emergency declaration, changed backdate numbers day occurred. instead example death reported week (ten days happened) numbers getting bunch attention, quietly go back increase last week's numbers one's watching. make news, helps DeSantis' poll numbers, anyone happen notice simply feeds narrative numbers falsified.

Cute, hunh? never moving US. guns. people fence getting kids covid vaccination 100% plan vaccinating point. going cautions make sure issues vaccine. There's reason trials adults children different age groups. wife got vaccinated soon possible. easy decision. Astraderna, knowing risk clots time, mixing vaccinations.

TAIPEI, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Taiwan could get first delivery BioNTech SE's¬†(22UAy.DE)¬†COVID-19 vaccines one month ahead schedule delay regulatory approval shot use mainland China made surplus available island, source told Reuters.

Taiwan's tortured bid vaccine, jointly developed Pfizer Inc¬†(PFE.N), become issue high political diplomatic drama, Taiwan accused China blocking deal earlier year, Beijing denied. China claims democratically-governed Taiwan territory.

Taiwan's government subsequently allowed tech giants Foxconn¬†(2317.TW), billionaire founder Terry Gou, TSMC¬†(2330.TW), negotiate behalf shot, $350 million deal 10 million shots inked last month.

More 1 million doses, originally destined China, expected arrive Taiwan end August early September, around one month earlier initially planned, person direct knowledge matter told Reuters.

""Shanghai Fosun manage get approval gave plan vaccine imports,"" source said, referring BioNTech's Chinese sales agent Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd¬†(600196.SS).

""The original manufacturer meant make delivery Shanghai Fosun, Fosun release (the vaccines) get emergency use authorisation"" China, source added.

Two sources direct knowledge matter said supplies due arrive next week, declined say led change schedule.

While BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said April expected COVID-19 vaccine would win approval Chinese authorities ""by June latest"", approval granted yet. approved Hong Kong Macau.

It immediately clearly many doses earmarked delivery China destinations surplus would re-directed result uncertain approval outlook.

Taiwan among several places getting orders ""abandoned"" China, first source said, declined name recipients include European country.

BioNTech TSMC declined comment. Fosun China's National Health Commission respond requests comment.

The made-in-Germany vaccines Taiwan get labelling simplified Chinese characters used China though Taiwan, along name Shanghai Fosun, according first source.

Responding requests comment article, Gou's spokesperson referred Reuters Taiwan's health authorities.

Health Minister Chen Shih-chung told reporters could say vaccines would arrive, still procedures needed completed, dismissed concerns labelling.

""During period time, epidemic prevention consideration. important thing whether vaccine safe effective,"" added.

The BioNTech vaccine drama transfixed Taiwan dominated headlines. relatively small domestic coronavirus outbreak well control, fewer 5% 23.5 million people fully vaccinated.

Taiwan's government ordered millions vaccines itself, Moderna Inc¬†(MRNA.O), AstraZeneca Plc¬†(AZN.L)¬†and local developer Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp¬†(6547.TWO).

Once BioNTech vaccines arrive donated administered government.
A Taiwanese Buddhist group also ordered 5 million doses.

Yeah, people think amount actually get paid.. no, even close. big insurance companies contracts hospitals, hence ""in network network"" facilities . Depends coverage 40 probably got 10k 100k , maybe 35k so. guesses pulled ass look read EOB ( Explanation benefits) insurance, see allowed amount, contractual obligations (the discount write off) deductible, coinsurance , non covered services. Hospital billing amazingly complicated.

Some inpatient stays paid single code.. say get appendix taken out, insurance pay X amount per contracted rate.. But, say hospital get pneumonia .. Well guess what, get paid charges. may bad example, basically works.  Remember friendly media saying DeSantis genius re-opening fast would definitely president 2024? Yeah, that....  us grow it.

But do. foreigner picked immediately. far use language really.

Anyway. topic concerned, people .fla? mean, governor scumcunt may one thing. people, citizens... ought right thing clever. much ask regardless people power?

Lets see clear open sources evidence allow level fear mongering here.

This ridiculous. Edit: here's article AP reports seeking markets currently.

I think forgot include link. looking last week looked like changed focus (at least NA/EU) targeted booster shot. actually agree once. think government ever able make law force citizens inject something body's.

I disagree policies encouraging mask usage. sure much effect though. people wearing ""stop gap"" (remember year ago) cloth masks still n95 kn95. masks barely better mask. wonder artificial framework laws exacerbated plagues earlier history. Numbers like 33/66/99 always look sketch Prior modern medicine sanitation, majority military deaths infectious disease. Militaries require vaccines reason. That's illegal even know hell talking about. Yeah lot people fail realize it‚Äôs business. first goal profit quality information. They've stuck 100k tests per day positivity rate roof, they're clearly missing lot cases. Also, well known backdate deaths, daily reports anything accurate. want know weeks death numbers, check like 14 days, even then, might there. Medical staff walking protest refusing take vaccine hospitals requiring take.

You mean voluntarily quaritining yourself? enough empty JCPenney's, Shopko's, Kmart's, Sears', even entire malls hold movie theaters. Well, now.  Tell Garth Brooks!

Take look [this twitter, Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean, National School Tropical Medicine. dad best friend live US got tests done home states (GA SC). I'm sure really want go US right given badly things going üòÖ Exactly. Don‚Äôt mince words, that‚Äôs going yarrow-ing experience! There's sparsely populated city called Delta BC. switched naming thought massive outbreak there.   thank u work! true uninformed. x-ray sufficient diagnostic back early days pandemic, SARS cov2 sequenced PCR tests developed. virus random mutations replicates. mutations help fitness, virions likely compete ones. mutations hurt fitness, it'll probably die out. little affect accumulate, used way determining lineage. yes, people immunity (whether natural vaccines) going create internal environment virions escape immunity selective advantage likely grow. Vaccinate mask. 
I suspect capability infected person transmit virus others unlikely uniform across entire period infection.

Would someone infectious first days, last, somewhere middle? Would transmisability correlate symptom intensity?  I'm day 4 symptoms. runny nose early day 1 got tested. Later day lost sense taste smell completely. Day 2 developed minor cough--about two back-to-back coughs per hour. Runny nose passed day 3 three occasional cough lack taste smell. Thankful vaccinated (Moderna). Still able work productive home. Temp risen 98.6F (97.7 right now). Feel totally normal aside occasional cough (mostly tickle sensation induced) fact I'm like Dewey fucking Cox. 

Worst part isolation friends and, importantly, wife. also vaccinated (Pfizer) even though sleeping bed night became symptomatic, able avoid infection. banished office guest bedroom super boring, hell lot better feeling like shit isolated. suppose always chance things could turn worse, think honestly, piece mind knowing I'm vaccinated eliminated anxiety infected. happened 6 months ago, I'm sure would experiencing associated anxiety causing somatic amplification symptoms. 

And plus side, end tunnel vaccine plus delta antibodies (assumed delta--reported 96% new cases state). expect feel pretty comfortable situation around end year. 

Get shots. older schools state ac. NJ, gets hot humid well. say cure. said get vaccine highly effective variants far. Vaccines work evidence showing vaccinated people cause lower variations happening showing even case going get can't vaccinate entire world.

As biden said couple months ago mask Vax.

**dance** Most-likely. However, Japanese media speculating quarantined home today, realized, ever since covid-19 started, every single dominant variant worse than‚Ä¶ variant it. means every single dominant variant see, that's worst variant ever.

What Delta? Delta worst variant ever?

Yeah

Wow that's messed glad moved stupid state. Absolutely hated arkansas. Maybe I'm good googling thought really 2.6M hospitalizations last 12 months? means 1 127 people hospital Covid. (all Americans, got covid). link please share scary-ass number. sidsing antivaxers. Honestly new York California outliners terms taxation. could example use Texas Washington Florida states without income tax throw averages toward counter. point merely health coverage really free anywhere unless poverty stricken buy UV box Amazon like $40  ACA largely employer mandate. self insured plan helps get ACA requirements regarding type plans offered, parts employer responsibility. Employers also contribute Germany... That's pretty fantastic much better 66% recorded. Maybe extra 20% loss efficacy accounts asymptomatic infection? mean Ken ""Under Indictment"" Paxton? He's far Abbott's ass. Hey now, no. one hates boomers Gen-X. Well balls would 60 man  talking deductibles. Generally billed directly health institution. Australia behind vaccination. people board vaccinate problems roll out. big exam end year 12 held oct/nov covers 2 years worth study ie entire pandemic. kids got preferential vaccinations focus study only. daughter year 11 giving extra points exam results kids whose parents government payments due shutdown businesses mandatory quarantine. Mind imagine kids grades kindy 1st, learn read numbers. parents cut home school. There's lot information missing here. 

One thing keep mind vaccinated population is, whole, older sicker unvaccinated population (which includes children 12). officials give us info don‚Äôt want know it? want Moderna getting 2 Pfizer shots 6 months ago trick work me.  read that? I‚Äôm licensed health insurance agent Texas plans sell (small-medium-large market) must ACA compliant unless self insured. sometimes prescribed people treat scabies. physician's supervision, may safe, correct dosage. buy cattle dewormer farm store ingest myself, though. used humans times. 85% unvaccinated. vast majority vaccinated hospitalizations old serious health problems. Forcing healthy vaccinated people endless masks breeds nothing dissent since it‚Äôs mostly security theater. 

You‚Äôre going go lot pushing vaccines. used love sorts shows/stories obvious bullshit fake, yet liked try figure actually going on.

They've become less enjoyable knowing people believe without question.  Thanks! interesting...Yeah, definitely notice low-pass effect person. Good luck fall/winter travel heats up! ""True HEPA"" filter good enough filter COVID, need H13 filter? Yep. increasingly line. Unfortunately vaccines aren‚Äôt enough keep people hospital reasonable rate. goes show bad unvaccinated Covid was. We‚Äôre going living years. Two contractions virus could turn 3, 4, 5, more. We‚Äôll need handle like flu shots every year. CVS try bill insurance vaccine shots? Beg differ think proved point he's ignorant. 
Here's why. doubt get proof he's still charge.

People power ensure secrets get kept hate insurance much American forced hemorrhage money horrific scam, damn perfect tool leverage case. hope employers follow suit force vaccinations way. fiance Covid last March vaccine. little worse cold. last time able smell. coming back little, year later, still smell milk him. Oooh like audience watching me!


I like way think.

Almost feel like friends. got poked march 31st. new shot take yet? Even inmates committed violent act? Interesting policy 2 months Israel started 5 month boosters. know Dec that's working terms safety effectiveness. Deductible certain amount pay first insurance pays anything. 

Copay fixed fee pay spot see doctor fill prescription. 

Coinsurance portion medical cost pay deductible met (so insurance pays majority cost now) reached Pocket Maximum. 

Out Pocket Maximum maximum amount money pay healthcare costs single year. 

Honestly, treatment costs roughly $100k annually, mainly think OOPM versus anything else. I'm also position deductible ($1400) something afford. Let's say instead spread air getting covid like catching fire (its slow burn, bear me).

Once get vaccine, (think like) dosed water received take home humidifier vest filled water (to wear you, ever go). However, time water inside sprinkler vest gets used up.

Now people old sprinkler vests literally on-fire people (that can't feel whether burning yet) hanging around mingling.

Those wear masks basically wearing heavy-duty fireman's suit.
But need drink water, eat, talk still need unzip top half suit.
When this, depending who's around, feel heat fires face (unfortunately IRL can't see virus, feel metaphorical heat).

This 3rd dosing water recommended needed, STILL ENOUGH.
Because everyday still walking inferno.

Side note: immunocompromised young, etc. real choice simply hope avoid humans coated invisible fires.

It's impossible task 51% population vaccination rate.

According St Louis Metro Pandemic Task Force, 15% patients hospitalized covid fully vaccinated. That's 84 beds. me, that's reason vaccinated people mask right they're here. Lambda coming. check rules pertaining covid-19 country entering, well countries transit (layover). rules change frequently.  thought grave diggers used machinery  yet still millions cases away that. you‚Äôre place like rural MN like find sorts N95 masks Home Depot. guess people around aren‚Äôt concerned‚Ä¶ God forbid kids wear masks Schools. It‚Äôs going large part paycheck since dated flight attendant found many colleagues food stamps take home pay bad especially less 5-10 years in. Another variant inevitable need booster shots ASAP. next variant COULD completely bypass vaccines booster system. get worse.

School starts next week Labor Day.  Second.   Yeah went school Savannah tried switching end June damn hot switched back. makes sick see people wishing death illness afraid vaccine...so much hate right now. Well, they're 1 thing right, guess. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è get it, parent want protect child able take others can't, ""What children"" pretty selfish take.

The thing is, nurses doctors parents too. kids home worry try cheerfully treat daughter many others. happens get sick one care kids? happens vaccinated nurse gets breakthrough case bunch idiots getting vaccinated accidentally give 4 year old.

Why stick string continue put family risk you. someone says ""they signed this"", fucking didn't. sign we've seen last 1.5 years. That's amazing. wonderful news, wish lived country like that. 16+ 90% 12+ 84% vaccinated fantastic. wrongest comment I've seen today.

Lambda mutations spike protein.

See Yeah like there's place near...say Orlando...that experience transporting large volumes liquid oxygen. realize different ""grade"" whatever, transport logistics issue here. Literally children refusing admit they're wrong. dont know, bunch letters try spell. Saw got downvoted, important perspective regardless position. people working different information different world view.

It would good everyone open ears bit listen compassion name calling. likely due raw numbers group. majority people fully vaccinated, followed unvaccinated. number people received one dose must quite small population level, stands reason received first shot eventually get second. Percentages start get weird one group disproportionately smaller others. fantasy world Game Thrones, summer winter last many years there‚Äôs predicable pattern it. 

Some children born long summer don‚Äôt know difficult awful life long winter food scarce, naive outlook realities life, thus ‚Äúa summer child‚Äù.  Digikey We? talking Tampa Florida right? remember saying, starts kill young people, kids especially (we yet) that's mask hating parents anti-vaxxers start going quiet beating doors looking vaccines. 

I hope get there, virus trying. Nah, none. noticed, least. wrong horrible person. efficacy infection, like one. efficacy disease, severe disease. states without ICU capacity right now. It‚Äôs case count. think prevention death even higher 97 Probably June. Covid background, nobody concerned. WEIRD thought kids didn‚Äôt get Covid??? 

/s love god downvotes unavoidable showing somewhat ressistance policy around Covid.. 

But wrote question perfectly, thanks. However, reported deaths dropped dramatically since 8/11, averaging 20 deaths per day past week, 177 average 7 days 8/11.

No problem all. 

I really hate comment, implies people leave willfully putting children harms way fucking governor sycophants responsible. Mandates work. France showed this! better? I'm small town Australia.

Even I've known really means long time now. saw downvoted, I'm interested well. mean ""don't get vaccinated"". legitimately, qualifications saying we're done this?

Most predictions I've read state continue propagate mutate like flu. going away, right? So, what's long term plan? trouble kids 12 never able get vaccine, represents 5% limit unvaccinated proposed here. There's also logistical issue able get vaccines campaigns several countries, variants arise.

Don't get wrong - everyone get vaccinated should, think realistic goal always mitigation.  Another kiwi here. That's patronising, passive-aggressive thing I've ever heard. south generally start August class June gets hot.

Given many people level immunity, short window spread, well infectious people spreading virus?! child sexual abusers I'm Florida state. Please tell much people state care kids. don't. Florida needs exist anymore, live here. Interestingly, Federal level United States, pandemic seems largely over.

Things kind fallen states, whenever individual states stabilize guess finish. Federally, US moved on. Legitimate question - path return society ""normal"" state (ie mask free / restrictions removed).

My understanding vaccines effective 3-9 months reducing severe symptoms 90% transmission somewhere 60-90% range. even everyone vaccinated, virus would continue spread via breakthrough cases asymptomatic transmission. Albiet slower rate. 

Given info, qualifications going mask free (societally) removing remaining restrictions? least vaccine passports used treat parasites humans, COVID virus. jail treating COVID cases? given alone medications actshown effective COVID, like Remdisvir, Regeneron, steroids? monitoring liver enzymes treatment? side effects earlier two jabs?

Could People Pittsburgh region shut locked Philadelphia hit hard Pittsburgh barely even touched. also helps Pittsburgh huge medical center, got hospitals galore. Since February 2020, YouTube removed 1 million videos related dangerous coronavirus information, false cures claims coronavirus hoax, company's chief product officer Neal Mohan said. side neckbeards /s personally first heard dr. Poland‚Äôs presentation here. It‚Äôs great listen! someone fully vaccinated, window exposed SARS-COV-2 virus, takes time immune reaction trigger shut infection down? I'm talking full breakthroughs person ends COVID-19 (perhaps mild form). Would tests currently use sensitive enough pick up?

I'm wondering advice currently given fully vaccinated exposure tracker apps exposed asymptomatic, continue without test. Misleading, intentionally so. drive clicks article posting ""vaccines still 97% effective severe illness"", ""66% effective infection"" certainly will.  pray right.  SW Florida - son started school 10th. 
They sent email days first day letting everyone know masks mandatory year. 
The backlash intense within 24 hours, sent exemption form parents could opt kids mask policy. 
First day like 50/50 (apparently lots parents see exemption form yet), every day less less kids wearing masks. 
As now, couple weeks in, son one 4 class (including teacher) actually wears one. 
We got covid December hospital 2 days week Christmas, interest getting sick he's completely cool mask despite 6 years old. 
People apparently even give shit kids.
They'd rather risk kids getting sick ever told wear mask.  Even though kid wearing mask school literally affect parent way. 
It's insanity.  
We moved last year closer family, we're already wanting leave again.  I'm around 40 afib first time last January. months followed higher heart rate resting, dizziness, numbness/tingling feet, stuff. I'm still dealing tingling sometimes slight dizziness, else seems subsided.

After tests neurologist clear, thing seems likely covid point know it. interesting thing ER afib every doctor asked may covid point seeing afib post covid patients.

So asymptomatic case like mine lead 8+ months issues. virus mess around. Thank sharing that. watch get chance.  countries 12 weeks first second shot fine.

I would try get within next weeks stay within that.  Oh come on! Cant anybody anything right ? thing terrifies anything: variant we've got remedy for. One strike people one day. hope best. I'm canadian. know meaning phrase all.  unvaccinated people course, vaccines holding delta efficacy robust enough anymore. Taking look Israel see mRNA vaccine efficacy stayed near upper percents could well beyond surge. unvaccinated people, mid range efficacy enough.  Health care systems (to knowledge) brink overload places high vaccine uptake. it‚Äôs governments best interest require vaccination individuals. Life can‚Äôt stop pissants decided anti-vax.

There won‚Äôt shutdowns. don‚Äôt know still popular take sub. It‚Äôs clear day won‚Äôt happening. Phase III trials, long knew anything vaccine. understand you‚Äôre scared, too. I‚Äôve going 13 months. *I‚Äôm fine*. Everyone know Trials fine. intensely watched, intensely followed vaccine human history, cover ups. lot lies, lot misinformation scare you, cover ups. Trust science. Go get shot. alternative something want face. response politicized that's worse ever. place get legit neutral news from? Reuters, BBC, etc; went shit rest clickbait vomit story nurses overworked underpaid hospital one nurse quit become travelling nurse much much much money assigned hospital quit from. absolutely need paid lot work they‚Äôve pandemic. That's violation Hippocratic Oath. trashy trump loving morons. Literally that‚Äôs country way is. hope people die soon cause breed like cockroaches. Breeding stupidity cuntry. think mean unvaccinated people increasingly likely post-infection resistance?

Anyway, yeah, study making efficacy comparison age group seems inept take seriously.  That's nuts. like death wish. Wife‚Äôs parents didn‚Äôt feel safe going Mexico family trip we‚Äôre going Florida next month instead. don‚Äôt really understand logic looking forward it. got first dose. Worried know right thing even didn‚Äôt want Waiting answer bc I'm dumb. concentrator home, ordering tanks leaving home, months since could get 1, used get 6-8 month. (So I'm just...not leaving home except emergency) they've stated multiple times bc hospital needs.

Anyway, I'm curious too.  New York falsified records conceal 12,000 COVID deaths, sure blame everything Florida.  Cheaper pay traveling nurses short term increase pay existing nurses. shortage, compensated fairly. Truck drives destination. unfortunate nonsense. Yes, *primary* objective prevent severe illness. vaccines secondary *goal* preventing infection (and, therefore, spread). Almost vaccines least extent exception odd ones like rabies vaccine. 

The best way eliminate harm virus eliminate spread. Eliminating spread done protection infection. Even relatively low efficacy flu vaccine protects infection severe disease, although protect infection well protects severe disease (even guess strains right). 

It's and. Pivoting solely ""protection severe disease"" also gives anti-vaxxers pass ""it's personal choice"". Protection infection protecting community whole. Protection severe disease protecting only. That's vast majority vaccines work. 

The vaccines both. yes, means get boosters. two doses rapid succession always known suboptimal immunology perspective. permanent, likely third dose result longer sustainment neutralizing antibodies (partly baseline higher, partly body keep producing longer). Thank hard AF work, deserve better, robot, situation allow it, quit leave, happy ending situation, people dying, others keep fighting vaccine...

I'm pretty sure already helped save lot lives, lose own.  take vacation. colleagues. show one day. Everybody calls sick. Essentially send message government, deserve more: benefits, salary, everything, put this. Black people lowest vaccination rate son's school started August 10th. 
Summer break much shorter here. believe premise trying convey humidity increases tends warmer weather much US, harder air-borne stuff spread. know that's true seems truthy that's matters aligns world view. (I'm actually interested true virus - even clearly significant impact COVID-19.) simply shocking‚Ä¶ Well fair exactly people Florida want. 

Otherwise they'd wear masks, get vaccination, otherwise act like moronic asswipes. 

Who knew actions would lead consequences. Welp!!  voting would rather live FEAR read FACTS. So, US major government released statement speaking qualifications? 

Are restrictions tied specific case rate / hospital capacity / vaccination rate?  plan open certain criteria met?

What exactly plan? understand. 18+ months... checked long haul subreddit? I've seen many posts issue there. answers, recall posts returning normal while, good see.  Unknown. novel virus haven‚Äôt something like present society. That's best way dealing it. That‚Äôs call job security. No. vaccinated. going live life protecting unvaccinated people. kids masked need I‚Äôm looking get shot asap. family friends vaccinated. I‚Äôm going store requires mask I‚Äôll wear it, otherwise sacrificing life. Call selfish otherwise way this. Yeah, did. I, stupidly, argued several people said this. Great news boosters 6 months instead 8 USA. 

That means big chunk people got shots asap get 3rd booster protection prior end year holidays - hopefully help limit spread unlikely hospitalized die able get booster like... .one month! we? thanks vaccinated people willfully unvaccinated people? went hen got third, recently. Much like second. Totally, glad you‚Äôre top it. got second shot 5/4, I‚Äôm still early this. tried make appointment November they‚Äôre yet haha. combination natural antibodies previous infection + recent, fresh vaccination.

what 5 month old vaccination fresh infection think vaccine finally kicked past 4 days sickest ive ever Four billion vaccine shots given worldwide. There‚Äôs coverup could handle fallout number shots given unsafe.

Just use Occam‚Äôs Razor. disagree. care kids, keep trying get kids killed time. 200 hour 80 hours overtime 1 million year. 2 years semi retire think anyone ever said kids can't catch virus. I‚Äôm also curious this. ‚ÄúNot hospitals‚Äù overrun great goal it‚Äôs plan. statements released saying restrictions removed completely certain vaccinated rate?   no... shit????   It‚Äôs going happen. Far easier mandate vaccines. Okay, gotcha. I‚Äôll check out. Thanks taking time respond, thank suggestions. appreciate it! ü§ç include decrease rate infection vaccinated people. hope that's working next. Buddy‚Äôs friend got it. Late 30‚Äôs.

SoFlo. practically guarantee it. Nasal antibodies fade somewhat quickly. Luckily stuff blood stick around much longer continue protect worst stuff thing do. around LOT longer that. heard living Georgia 80s, people much older me. rates long Covid appear vaccinated unvaccinated, catch symptomatically.

Any sources this? I've really curious same. would majority world participate it? course call election benefits! Lucky Canadians amirite Would willing expound little pay disparity staff?

Every one seven children living home ‚Äî ages 3 18 ‚Äî became infected COVID-19, too. family member home ill wife. also family member who‚Äôd vaccinated. info whether prevents long COVID?I'm wondering whether need mask again.

Yes. get half mask respirator replaceable filters? real issues are, say it,bad politics stupid people, med staff real people, burned out, matter much throw Hippocratic Oath them, robots feel like can't take anymore more, least leave quit.

It really sucks point politics, well being. recommending getting standard second j&amp;j shot us j&amp;j folks? everyone waited perfect time kids, wouldn‚Äôt any. Life goes on, despite difficulty. could see life insurance companies knock question underwriting regarding vaccination status. shot, coverage. I‚Äôm shocked many haven‚Äôt quit. lack empathy required care people refused get vaccine end hospital it, people taking beds could filled stroke heart attack sufferers. people got hit car. bizarre. COVID cases exploding USA, yet feels like something happening people, me. eligible people family vaccinated. coworkers vaccinated. friends vaccinated. 

I couple friends get COVID vaccinated, mild cold. 

The return mask wearing feels like hygiene theater. Nobody wants spread virus, 100% social circle vaccinated, seems like there‚Äôs point. 

This pandemic killing thousands every day, yet it‚Äôs extremely unlikely directly affect anyone around point don‚Äôt know feel that. care money; (taxpayer) money!!! I‚Äôm good one every year every six months whatever takes reduce risk getting Covid protect family friends. again, actually understand vaccine isn‚Äôt poison, microchips, microscopic Bill Gates figurines whatever low information people seem think vaccines are. Fair point. Probably recency bias end. fair number people work within last couple weeks extended time due + test fully vaccinated.

It drives nuts antivax crowd runs it. everyone comments subscribe new york times read article? complaining government trying keep alive community alive process going inconvenienced? teachers told everyone would bad idea, enforcement masking borderline impossible.

My district 10,000 80 positives 300 kids quarantined since school started, possible, buy responsible parties (i.e. parents). keep mind live progressive part state, lived 30 minutes way there's good chance son would virtual year. problem, least places like Florida, summer.

You want keep insides buildings cool dry; air outside hot humid. Even replacing small amount indoor air per hour cause cooling costs skyrocket, cool (expensive) dehumidify (expensive too) air.

Also, HVAC system capacity set keep building comfortable hottest part year, may much headroom start introducing outside air. cause building become warm humid, end mold problems uncomfortable people.

So yeah, might feasible late fall, winter, early spring here, right now. Absolutely right now! Yeah, feel that. got grief attending big superspreader party happened -- opt COVID. sincerely thought going. Cases upswing nearly bad now. family dodged COVID bullet happened. year-and-a-half personally touched COVID create false sense security sure.

Well, good bad, family going brought discussions COVID safety open. Sort anyway. one unvaxxed people going get vaccine, that's something.

Take care yourself. Maybe invest good-quality KN95. Look ATSM-certified masks. tough spot sure. plenty scientific evidence showing effectiveness masks vaccinations. People made conscious decision ignore science listen politicians. 

How much dumb could be? something drinking water? I'm FL.

It's worse think.

Doctors starting refuse treat unvaccinated focusing people save. Sandy Hook, hopes died real change anything.  vaccine normal fda approval numbers going shoot up. heath care systems live not-for-profit, expend millions dollars year keep status, one makes endless renovations grounds, largest property owner area. comment we‚Äôre replying (intended Desantis) effect ALWAYS making daily graph deaths look like they‚Äôve peaked headed drastically down. Lol, moved Florida. Well.. least they're vaccinated. mandatory? campus required? Really hoping change 8 6 months boosters timeline start. can't afford wait another month start process people already beyond 6 months metric achieved, wait it... fewer cases COVID-19. 

But rate ""acceptable"" return full normal? number cases need hit Covid endemic (emergency ends, masks etc. longer needed) rather pandemic? 

This authorities putting restrictions place need clarify, think, expect people continue complying restrictions. one laying exactly victory looks like, problematic makes people fearful restrictions continue long-term (or forever). think that's case, honestly easy understand people concerned exit identified powers be. Moderna  anti vaxxers going fired either way. Masks creating   No, desantis changed deaths counted weeks ago. He‚Äôs fudging numbers. sort implement credits exercising places. brand get? Pfizers back January.   especially LA county. Bye bye guy, make way tons young guys would love firefighter. dude missed.  Dude, come on, many times need said? Hospitals endless beds, resources staff treat many severely ill people.

Once bed used up, car accidents, heart attacks people need surgeries treat serious conditions? there's room them, turned away die.

A lot people go home become sick spread around communities.

Healthcare workers getting fed quitting seeing people dying simply they're vaccinated. Staffing shortages real problem hospitals across America. Well, hope least medical workers Florida fully vaccinated? need 80-90% population resistant stop spread. either vaccination, letting antivax idiots clog hospitals hit point. wish CDC spent integrity within months outbreak. 
Imagine medical authority could trust without going rabbit hole ""how much direct population perform desired behavior vs. much factually true validated data back up""? 


Breakthrough cases, example - proven high 25%, CDC kept plodding along false claim 1%. 


The US information problem par China Russia. Hmmm... DeSantis ""donate"" bunch oxygen another country let cruise ship unvaxxed passengers dock ports???

That political move it? Say so!!! logging day death instead day processing inaccurate? arguably accurate. argument devolved. reports fauci said without quote, probably valid. certainly worth four quote insistences.  assumption always going return ""normal"", guess means 2019. 

That would sure nice, written anywhere happen anytime soon, ever. automatic self correction built system far know.

The human race seems entered kind state complete stupidity short-sightedness bode terribly well, suggest ability overcome problems, even self-created ones like inequality, pollution ecosphere, global warming.

I'm obviously bad day. üò¨    prefer statistics inaccurate/misleading?  Honestly, opinion, Venn diagrams anti vaxxers climate change deniers lot overlap. Covid ends reforming people otherwise taking rest us sane people might actually chance here. They're accelerating demographic decline. celebrate this, merely watch shake head. There‚Äôs one biology class required. running joke mean girls high school become nurses lines anti vax sentiment remember girls (spoke nurse one mean girls üòù). pfizer first two got third moderna shot knocked 36 hours completely back normal. People seem forget we‚Äôve yearly flu shots like 80 years NPR? age-old tragedy commons, except humans numbers technological capability actually (destroy earth). paywalled, way read this? mandate vaccine keep job? doesn‚Äôt evade immunity delta (both minimally evasive) it‚Äôs less transmissible delta. catch it, would probably suck same, there‚Äôs nothing particularly worrying it‚Äôs likely outcompeted delta wherever exist concurrently.  Hey, totally agree. wish would. advising mandating two different things them. mandate, gladly comply. see crazy public freaking videos them. Maybe clear. tried find story, many deaths nurses. find source. provide protection community large. Kids still unable vaccinated, it‚Äôs protect also keep virus mutating. 2 links indeed someone saying kids can't get it, stand corrected.

Your links variation ""don't get sick"" ""don't transmit"" that's really claiming kids can't catch virus.

I guess we'll chalk inaccuracy English language. 

For example, someone says ""I flu"" usually mean they've got symptoms virus.

But someone says ""I herpes"" probably mean they've got virus whether they're showing symptoms. 

Then again, someone says ""I shingles"" probably mean they've got active symptoms, even though exact virus herpes. people passing away vaccinated/immunocompromised? people vaccinated well Went Walgreens. Easy peasey. think mercenary accurate word them.  agree heartily. People use reddit indulge self-obsession. hope least slightly less irresponsible lives! Bored 2021?

C'mon main conspiracy sub turned anti-vax, anti-mask, anti-everything-except-Covid Central.

My 2021 hours arguing may already surpassed 2020. DeSantis reminds Kevin Bacon character Animal House, facing oncoming crowd arms outspread yelling ""All well! well!"" trampled crowed. THANK ‚úåÔ∏è friendly people reddit.

I believe vaccines currently best defense. understand hesitation. vaccine disasters past long term sides.  also unknown long term sides covid well. 

Does seem little ignorant antivaxxer? Maybe...but problem conspiracy theorist / sceptical individual - every they're right.

People act like that's 0% chance instead 5% chance. Man, that's fucked up. - lifetime bans well, Go r/covid19 financially destroyed doesn‚Äôt make people get vaccinated, nothing will. larger plan. specifically referring healthcare workers refuse get vaccinated. close contact covid patients time want protection? Well, 1500 millions still less 1%! immune system vaccine!!!!111!!!!111!1!!111!! Watch tourist attractions beaches fill maskless unvaccinated people Labor Day weekend. people already getting 3rd doses? Lol, Mexico taking much seriously. sad that. Lol last time, media. spike caused Delta, caused people refusing vaccine. quicker country recognizes fact, quicker something it.  proof required. bulk oxygen farm hospitals owned operated gas supply company, cost constructing maintaining equipment recouped purchase price oxygen. Minimum baseline supply normally 96 hours, supply company adjust depending facility's emergency contingency plan, optimize refilling operations.

Florida hospitals believe usually significantly hours hurricanes, dropping 48 hours seems rather dire. Good luck ventilator. Good maybe theyre human beings radically underestimate risk levels, make mistakes like rest us...  follow money mystery self-explainable DeSantis doing. need complete checklist yes no. get booster shot. Simple opposed kn95s, bonafide masks sells powecom headband style ones test pretty well legitimate website. use 12+ hour indoor shifts they're super comfortable.   Live stupid states, get stupid prizes.  ignore Florida highest numbers pandemic far? 

Lol already approved immunocompromised. won‚Äôt hurt. 

One way get blood test see antibody count. Make decision based that, takes individual response differences vaccine. guess I'll order n95's  think that's part propaganda. can't science getting way tabaco sales car sales, busting unions, holding gov accountable. yeah anti-intellectualism born.

but prob bear mentioning, vein issue now.   knew actions would lead consequences.

That's it.. desantis' numbers last year said real consequences.

Wow that's crap study. Basically 95% confidence vaccines effective either 1 4 people roughly 5 6 people. useful anyone? I'm sorry healthcare workers , kids, people can't get vaccinated, immune compromised, people trying right things; everyone else sympathy for. think there's evidence vaccines dangerous. fine first shot, slightly fatigued second one. 

On hand, get vaccine, keep taking protective measures much can. Vaccines obviously perfect protection. Anyone know symptomatic children cases becoming? believe GoT reference  guess least one economy booming Florida. protects rising variants. Kind like getting new flu shot every year, protect year's active strains. Getting annual shot alright keeps actually miserably sick dying, no? Exactly this. indoctrination deeply entrenched population. places case numbers really lower vaccinated areas. hospital releases census every day covid admissions roughly 91% unvaccinated. Getting everyone vaccinated decrease severe infections needing hospitals. Smaller numbers leave room variance also people likely gotten dose recently, immunity wanes time fully vaxxed group includes people six months since vaccines. Yes, bring card. update dose 3 everyone Reddit US. Bless heart knowing this. penny less. good them, hope make shitload money get retire early. can‚Äôt wait! Hope winter safe good one.

Every single person know Florida got covid family, including vaccinated, last 2 months. huge difference, vaccinated folks asymptomatic (knew threw exposure chose test, positive quarantined spread it. affected life A) quarantine one case spreading knew unvaccinated relative). unvaccinated folks sick including ICU/ventilated hospitalization. 

There time like April-June know *anyone* personally work related dealing Covid *anywhere*. 

I believe Florida hiding real numbers seems everywhere right now. also trying use post vaccine platform, wanted clarify difference happened people like ""see vaccinated got sick too"" different experience didn‚Äôt understand first part sentence. Excellent movie reference! sure people allergic mRNA vaccines almost certainly PEG, everything toothpastes hand creams. Man... crazy. think would move doctor nurse. guess many are.    fair, nurses going right deserve every penny really sounds like better way tabulate it, caveat one would understand data last two weeks preliminary.

Although doubt DeSantis really interested providing accurate numbers. (we yet)

I mean, filling pediatric ICUs. North Texas (DFW) ran pediatric ICU beds week ago. pre-delta...the guidance changed vaccinated people higher viral loads infect others. Catering anti vaxxers going help anything...one excuse always replaced another. Yep. good friend EMT 12 relevant certifications. make $19 hour CA (which little craziness EMT life). public servants dim witted?

Imagine job sit 8h every day 5 days week watch YouTube videos covid misinfornation. Must fun job. get rid disease vaccination unless vaccine actually prevents people infected first place. infection rates amongst vaccinated individuals still high enough virus likely mutate select aggressive variant, that's viruses operate.

Ideally, virus becomes infective significantly less deadly people build natural immunity without overloading hospital killing dozens thousands people. quarrel Biden "" messaging.""?

(It's like five years first two cases state supreme court even decided yet, even still probably need go federal district court. fed districts ruled it, split expect go Supreme Court unless battle mooted federal legalization first.)

Let's get approval mandate everywhere can. know girl EMT making like 9 dollars hour insane. Tbf, entry level job requires like 3 5 months certificate (it since got mine might fudging number long). still, people literally saving lives making sure die making peanuts. there's always shortage staff every healthcare field.

I'm curious hear got 2 mRNA doses went got J&amp;J like .   note- Israel officially released data couple days ago, didn‚Äôt number effectiveness symptomatic illness asymptomatic illness, 50-60%. highly effective severe cases still.

Also, CI delta effectiveness extremely wide, means really good grasp effectiveness is.

Finally, effectiveness asymptomatic infection bound wane since antibodies wane. remember AMA expert back April saying would happen, surprise hardly immunologist. 

Eventually, we‚Äôll focus effective preventing DISEASE INFECTION, right now- cases sky high many areas lowly vaccinated. isn‚Äôt vaccine issue- it‚Äôs population issue. vaccines still incredibly effective. Unfortunately, bunch laymen (myself included) saw back march vaccines 90% effective preventing infection, expectations vaccines way high.

4. winter lot states severe activity restrictions probably helped tamp spread (e.g. indoor dining, gyms, group gatherings, in-person schooling, etc) probably reduced spread.

While true (assuming commonly accepted R0 estimates Delta correct), outside places like NZ Australia, one looking future vaccines alone: there's also immunity resulting infection. Considering one type immunity makes math easier, realistically, everyone going get exposed SARS-CoV-2 many people going get enough infection develop amount natural immunity.

It would great could beat COVID-19 vaccines alone, even vaccines, eventually (probably within years looking prior pandemics) enough people enough natural immunity one prior infections enough susceptible hosts large wave like one we're seeing right now. mean, I‚Äôm doctor healthcare professional all, average person sees writing wall tragedy making. 

It‚Äôs triage. won‚Äôt take patients cannot care for, patients can. someone comes respiratory illness dramatically increases need oxygen have, person comes treated taken first. come resources, like full beds situation already made it. 2 random people treat one other, pick one know save. 

It‚Äôs tragic completely preventable RN right I'd resign, look job state, offering $15K $80K signing bonuses. damn it, going burned might well get rich. agree pay more. Insurance rates going skyrocket claims due COVID. smoker pay higher premiums due potential health issues. People vaccinated pay too.

Slippery slope fallacy assumed perfectly predictable chain events happen justification explanation step.  Yeah, far seems like challenges depends kind ""safety"" expect. Right fully vaxxed ppl contract covid, there's 1.5% 4% chance hospitalized. that's risky. jump balcony 1 50 chance i'd wind hospital. otoh xtreme sports fanatics try pull difficult tricks skate boards bikes every single day without flinching. Everyone's risk level different. Good them! natural &amp; free immunity without vaccines, even under-12s eligible vaccines.

How many hospitalized? many even single symptom. 3 year old niece tested positive covid random test - way we'd know since absolutely NOTHING different physically mentally. People need start wearing mask indoors. still dont get lifted mask mandate distribute vaccines zero shots start third here. Christ, Western world egoistic. African continent &lt;5% 1 shot. Sadly way works. dont cake children children. way dont care women, wives . sad extension ownership doesn‚Äôt equal love. Slam Dunk. people vaccinated see breakthrough infections.

This bad take. virus effective even non-sterilizing vaccine, high population vaccination percentages spread would plummet.

If seeing drastic increase breakthrough infections, suggests mutation renders vaccine less effective.  antivaxxers already premium-free life insurance though‚Ä¶? 
It called ‚ÄúGoFundMe.‚Äù  unvaccinated person higher risk needs identified ASAP

Sure, people PCR test positive (vaxxed not) avg 4 days exposure.  get ""asap""

From (well-cited) study, there's difference latent periods vaxxed vs unvaxxed. get ""delayed"" test differs either (3-5 vs 5-7) 

It's absolutely possible I'm missing study article data. I'm looking find it

If social plans back-to-back Saturdays, what's CDC suggestion good day test in-between. I'm fully vaxxed hang fully vaxxed people. I'm still currently testing 3 times Tues/Wed/Thurs (day 3,4,5).

2. trying convince people get vaccinated saying ""you go back normal get vaccinated"", account fact people getting vaccinated already give shit wearing masks also remember pre-delta variant.

EO applies entities receive state/government money. independent business fine. However, things like public universities still screwed Contact tracing US pretty subpar though really sure 203 infections happened? ***WEAR MASK*** virus transmissible everyone world caught within week would burn out.

Also, 80 million people would also die 800 million would get long COVID. Global society would ruins.

I like plan. Let's calculate effectiveness percentage.

1 - (1 / 29) = 0.97

So vaccines 97% effective hospitalization.

Again see vaccines great stopping spread, achieving herd immunity avoiding mild form covid, powerful ""do wind hospital"" card.

Virus based (J&amp;J) use disabled adenovirus retrofitted SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.

Both result thing, immune system sees spike proteins, studies creates anti-bodies possible future infection real virus.

This similar data Israel found 600 hospitalizations among 5.4 million vaccinated 0.01%, CDC said breakthrough rate 0.01%.

People justify laziness. think Redditors overestimate amount even people took pandemic measures seriously last year got fully vaccinated would willing go another lockdown business restrictions, go gathering bans (especially head closer holiday season), overestimate number reasonable people would follow lockdown gathering restrictions bans future.

I think Redditors like think people buy large Redditors liked lockdown life liked staying home normalized. Redditors largely - least compared overall population - thrived lockdown, seem think enough buy overall population think wrong that.

That's going create quagmire sorts politicians state officials continue see cases hospitalizations rise ICU beds filled, largely (or overwhelmingly) filled willingly unvaccinated people. can't see - mostly owing go lockdown hell last winter fact ICU occupants due COVID willingly unvaccinated - public buying in.

Breakthrough cases way likely infection rates among antivaxers continue rise. time spends someone else, new generation covid 19. happens enough, evolves next form survive conditions result natural reproduction.

When breakthrough case occurs, assume vaccine work. 3 confirmed variants last saw, exponentially deadly contagious last.

The people trying crack us exist. fraud protected freedom speech either.  hate stuff like this. Glad ok tho that's important serious? going prevent something like happening don‚Äôt try find happened?  It‚Äôs process approval, long supposed take.  cases doubling every week two, boat uncontrolled spread. worry, numbers get gigantic soon enough.

Fortunately state (MD) best healthcare country high vaccination rates (just surpassed 80% adults last week), able surgery chemotherapy rapid smooth succession. Even admitted hospital week side effects chemo (Neutropenic fever), able seen put room/bed within 2 hours. 

It‚Äôs scary simply misfortune life circumstances lived Florida (or gulf states point) there‚Äôs good chance would still sick, still fighting cancer, dead neutropenia infection. 

I feel terrible cancer patients slowly painfully dying without treatment healthcare system needlessly overwhelmed selfish, reckless, idiotic led deceived DeSantis. issue was, issue doctor said needed mammogram asap got one. showed issue actually issue, insurance said young covered. asked mammogram shown something, would still pay it? Yes, would have. age indicated possibly anything. fully vaxxed ppl contract covid, there's 1.5% 4% chance hospitalized.

Source this? mean hostile way, would jump balcony 1 50 chance i'd wind hospital.

Just point risk 1 50 -- 1 50 times whatever risk getting case COVID (with additional caveat risks severe highly dependent personal factors). several times lower 1 50.

Maybe that's still higher comfort level. lower risk level risk conditional getting infected.

I learned past 2 years country really capable shit. Inciting violence protected freedom speech, informed human understand. Abbott: ""Our hospitals open business."" 101 first dose 103 second dose. looking forward 3rd helps put shit past us it. Australia like 23% fully vaccinated 55% vaccination yet, 3 covid deaths yesterday, population similar Florida (I think bit larger).

Though climb due outbreak conservative mismanaged state, broke records number cases last 2 years. ‚ÄúWorking‚Äù highly subjective.

That's I'm doing.  Since ‚Äúgovernor‚Äù Lee made parents opt executive order. school daughter goes 27 positive case. Total almost 37 yesterday.  terrifying. completely preventable.  That's awful :( Makes hard get ahead one unlucky illness accident bring plans crashing like that. I'm still making up. concern much kids. studies long COVID several studies starting look believe. Long COVID nebulous thing doctors hard time putting box make definitive diagnosis able 'test for' make studies scientifically significant. believe gotten soon get ICD 10 able bill/treat it. hey, freedom speech. people?  was, also proud grid much robust eastern western grids. proud $5 billion invested revamp entire education system (and $5 billion late 70's boat load money), paid tax increases. spent month civil rights, spent month civil war.

Eh, there's still going percentage needs hospitalizaion neither lies, give shit that? Right deemed safe kids yet.... one pointing cases hospitalizations? mild asymptomatic cases, literally much ado nothing. saying last summer too, south wave.

Florida vax rate like 51%. CT example, 65%. huge difference, honest. difference, enough stop bad wave here? doubt it, vs Delta. may see modestly lower death &amp; hospitalization rates. brace yourself. That's take. Ouch. Canada averaging 13 deaths per day currently. nation 38 million people. Average cases per day 2,000.

Now, fully expect Canada going get another wave. highlighting near peer nation like compared one single state 21 million like.

50 percent Canadian population 905 corridor around Toronto. pretend density thing. policy implementation thing.  ""Show science masks work,"" Caleb wrote City San Angelo's official Facebook December 2020. ""Show evidence school closures work. Show evidence lock-downs work.""

What fucking idiot.

Kind like drunk driver. hope dumb asses take looks like rallies spearheaded mean that's likely case.   we've already 3 waves make sense good friend specializes graph theory. Can't say understand does, suffice say understand data, less understand data. üòÖ Yes. Officially immunocompromised get it. Unofficially, 1 million got even that, tons people getting since there's zero verification whether immuncomprimised; even asked specific reason are. Look xylitol nasal spray well. small clinical trials done, studies Northwestern University Utah State University, ""larger"" clinical trial looks like started Texas:   really sure good ""investigate"" anymore. know China. Either world grows balls punishes severely let go. Seriously? Making vaccination mandatory heavy daily fines get it. see could less serious locking everybody down.  know long covid exists, I‚Äôm pointing unless severe infection, lasting symptoms likely psychosomatic infection itself. studies provided support here's quick glimpse hospitals arkansas, Vice interviewed individuals unvaccinated also healthcare workers helping them. worth watch.   son autism hates mask. still wears it. 

I volunteer children ages 7-18, every single kid worn mask without issue. gonna feel gets sick, brings home?  arrest them? 60% Floridians least one dose covid vaccine. nearly enough, think would reduce hospitalizations extent. data shows usually asymptotic minor symptoms deaths 0-17 low. Something around 385 deaths far US, less vehicle deaths children. don‚Äôt know getting downvoted. It‚Äôs fair statement.  Yeah, pretty comprehensive data sets, believe agreed share Pfizer, best data \*pfizer\* vaccines, caveat being, data may may apply vaccines &amp; vaccine types.  Second wave bruh Another dead head head GOP governor  won't. 

Just look news clips people saying shit like ""It killed parents get vaccinated."" ""Yeah, killed neighbor son, I'm getting it."" 

Politics replaced religion lot people. logically engaged topics logical consequences going change mind. hub aerospace electronics? CDC counting hospitalizations deaths breakthrough cases.  One ask prove they‚Äôre full shit it‚Äôs sincerely held belief. Considering many times heard someone say something like different Covid stuff yeah buying it.  

It would nice true though. sons school district closed Labor Day‚Ä¶.  say long COVID exist. says higher incidence psychosomatic symptoms.  


I truly hope understand second sentence mean thing long COVID. cherrypicking studies SORT support claim, also disregarding plenty studies don't. flood comments video man talking PHD education claims creator MRNA vaccine. It‚Äôs spreading lot misinformation  already knew divided, virus shown incredibly stupid one side is. masks protect less 10% viral load. vaccine works, mask not, need stop pretending play politics.

the facts back up:   Florida doctor removed hospital job amid reports offered parents medical letters circumvent school mask requirements. Dr Warden's employer, Capitol Regional Medical Center Tallahassee, told BBC began process removing providing services patients ""immediately"" upon learning actions. Though Delta variant affecting younger people, fewer 2% children's cases require hospital care, 0.03% resulted death, according American Academy Pediatrics. Really hope ramps up, 33% pretty good, lot places still low vaccination rate, poses risk variants Well that's precisely true. That's we're seeing divergence Pfizer Moderna effectiveness. They're nearly identical, Pfizer 30ug, Moderna 100ug. One produces higher level antibodies, consequently, (yet) fallen much.

During Phase I/II trials, Pfizer tested 10ug, 30ug, 100ug. Moderna tested &lt;=50ug, 100ug, 250ug. trials found highest dosages produced higher level antibodies (nearly much 30/100 group 2 shots), incidence side effects causing severe discomfort high (so never given 2nd shot), original strain, antibody levels thought adequate.

So tl;dr side effects strong. higher antibodies would made longer lasting evidence. numbers looking really nice too.

I can't think better description ignorant asshole. Again, critical thinking. matter vaxxed reach herd immunity levels. Acting like safe actively putting others danger, undoing progress made towards ending pandemic. difficult understand?

Like fucking shit dude, I'm vaxxed too. still wear mask, still socially distance, I'm braindead I'll go theater instead literally negating risk EXACT ACTIVITY home. still 12% chance contracting Delta even doses vax. You, like anti-vaxxers, ignoring risks selfish. 

Sorry like called ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è fiance Jasper, hour there. confirm. Yep. It‚Äôs like someone arguing able drink drive want to. 

‚ÄúWhy care? die that‚Äôs risk took!‚Äù 

They completely ignore risk place others. icu bed they‚Äôd stealing cancer patient. post link Fauci saying 60% would enough herd immunity? follow, ""Alternative Facts"".  public health officials want guesstimate trajectory set mandates &amp; restrictions accordingly. Sure may seem they're overly restrictive &amp; punitive case rates lower, policies institute help sustain hospital system 2 months now.

Making policy decisions overly restrictive punitive opposite effect here, though. part discussion.

If tell someone who's vaccinated, ""Wear mask indoors might help,"" might begrudgingly comply. tell person, ""Wear mask time inside house question it,"" might say, ""Fuck this,"" wear mask anywhere‚Äî*including* indoors.

It's called picking battles, way, public health wasting time dicking around mask messaging may may help. Instead, spending resources increase vaccinations, *definitely help*. Hell, bribe people to. Get hyperlocal, too. Convince community leaders convince people trust them. *That* time money need spent. made us get vaxxed Yellow Fever condition employment. Yellow fever... covid, disease killing heck people USA GUARANTEED one infected people circulating around domestic airport...That's hill die on... oaths. 

some doctors must think since LGBT....oh yeah, covered it. per dose value $15, probability need vaccine + booster, foreseeable future, companies like moderna, going rolling dough school mask mandate. Eating would one times mask come off. hopefully students eating shifts somewhere well ventilated like outdoors. It‚Äôs recommended get vaccinated live vaccine. looking promising least! 

Unfortunately organizations studies effects/benefits natural immunity, I'm holding out. ü§û Read article try  Looks like *spreading* rapidly social media.  pro workers rights. Unions fight benefits like health insurance corporations use excuse weaken them.

People like pilots, air crews healthcare workers last year worked risks called heroes result. they're disposable corporate media directed two minutes hate toward now. got plants crave! Yeah, although Fauci kept revising upwards even said lower number PR purposes. Note I'm slamming Fauci - think he's great. that's part job.  Israeli cautiously able avert disaster giving boosters 5 months. started July 30 30+ . Vaccine efficacy infection waned 39% vs. 86% booster.  want see United, Aetna, Blue Cross, etc. require condition coverage, full stop. guess 60-70 earlier 2020 earlier year.

I'm doubting can't find single quote Fauci saying 60% would good enough herd dont want believe knock out. Im going look harder disprove always war Eastasia though.

""I proof nothing show"" really heartbreaking. thing that's keeping florida even worse disaster ton medical infrastructure. capacity we're using Coronavirus came somewhere, means lot people getting care issues. biggest confounding factor take age account, effectiveness much higher. seems lower everyone lumped together old people likely affected, also vaccinated. Younger people relatively unaffected, less likely vaccinated. Stratifying age group gives better picture vaccine effectiveness.

Also, many unvaccinated people may immunity undiagnosed asymptomatic infection, reducing apparent vaccine efficacy included control group. Australia. thr option taking private insurance wish usr equivalent NHS. good private insurance US$2500 year family. ""B.1.617.2 ""

I‚Äôm interested anyone find info though Everyone can, get vaccinated. Delta game changer going rip population, vaccines/masks/social distancing help mitigate health emergency. People need quit twats start believing science again. 

All said - HEALTH CARE HUMAN RIGHT it‚Äôs high fucking time Americans universal health care. 

Triage still thing, prioritize vaccinated covid pts medical emergencies, like ration care unvaccinated taking lower priority. 

Access health care national embarrassment long time it‚Äôs wild see people applaud parasitic insurance companies shit like this. understand frustration anti vaxers, really do, isn‚Äôt solution. Mandate vaccines already done it. many shots need take. long immunity starts taper? long shots concidered longer immunized front load again. effectiveness vaccine start tapper continous injections? repercussions extended repeated use vaccine? plenty cases people getting covid twice

Do numbers this? cannot find any. ""Plenty"" relative. is, say, 1 million people, would enough offset widespread immunity caused exposure.     mention Europe citizens receive services back taxes.

Abbott loves legal riddles all. antivaxxers know dug feels hopeless. might even able ‚Äúpry guns cold dead hands‚Äù easier getting roll sleeves. we‚Äôre never getting it. Cool.

But problem universal healthcare. Brilliant. Expect see everywhere. one hand, hate universal healthcare great way companies pass along cost recklessly staying unvaccinated people want society.

Maybe make open universal healthcare I'm sure Venn diagram anti-vaxxers anti-universal healthcare folks pretty much circle. thought Delta Dental Unvaccinated kind without valid medical (not religious) reason charged much higher keep costs down.

He's science guy, he's pretty good getting vaccines people developing nations. Something we're kinda struggling right now.  source data shows ""exact same""? really, know since keep track this. BMI really show 80% people overweight. 42.4 percent quoted CDC obese, rest 80% overweight yet obese. IANAL, weird situation. Abbott emergency declaration, gives pretty expansive powers would allowed normal times. using justification provided emergency prevent local authorities addressing emergency. Even might theoretically make sense certain situations, like wanted coordinate emergency response state want local authorities working cross purposes (like everyone fighting ventilators). he's that. He's basically saying ""By powers granted emergency, officially declaring emergency, therefore one allowed treat like emergency."". bizarre. LSU vaccine mandate go football game. cannot believe Texas starting hang around Alabama Mississippi crowd terms idiocy. new slogan going ‚Äúwe number 50‚Äú. Treat zero empathy, expect empathy bottomless. lying shit criminal offence? They're activel√∂y endangering people. He‚Äôs afraid primaried. nothing changed

Well Delta variant changed things. Now, propensity breakthrough, 70% benchmark effective would've last year.  think point lot idiots miss make attempt gotcha comment vaccinated among groups would still prioritized treatment unvaccinated. Thank doc. I'll prostate exam next week  Yeah that‚Äôs issue. issue unvaccinated allowing time mutate again. Please don‚Äôt daft helps propagate disinformation. Thank you. understanding wife who's service waiting approval require it. making every effort make easy get suggesting everyone get now.

She got shot 2 months made easy. Got bad thought big government attacking state government actually vice versa local government defending state government I've leaning heavily towards ""live life,"" live covidactnow orange state. place like Georgia, even I'd hesitate. hospitals fully overwhelmed, entire region offloading patients wherever find space. bad roll dice puts really, really bad spot. Risking feels pretty unwise. said 75-85 December guess 60-70 earlier 2020 earlier year.

That said, think Forbes reliable stating people claimed. see youd want better source interpreting scientific data said dont see doubting them.

If dont want believe knock out. Im going look harder disprove always war Eastasia though. Holy shit unethical. Throw guy jail, release inmates suffer horror. Looking case numbers day day exercise futility. Better ignore follow 7 14 day average. Better remove entire subreddit it‚Äôs left garbage  Hasn‚Äôt known like year? protection infants didn‚Äôt last past like month two? Meaning didn‚Äôt develop actual immunity it, kind grace period. seems like best way go it! Good luck! Considering excerpt quoted below, substance seems useful role play *bacterial* infections. pumping high levels sPLA2-IIA *viral* infection seems like pathological response immune system. would interesting know happens viral infections well, specific Covid-19. specific Covid-19, something special SARS-CoV-2 (Covid virus) accounts this? seems like interesting lead explore I'm expert - virology nerds would like weigh sPLA2-IIA enzyme, similarities active enzyme

It's extreme, everything US fought free people from. However, shown repeatedly half country refuses right thing, unless ok million people dying take extreme measures bring back control. immunity relies sterilizing immunity have. Delta happily walk wall vaccinated people asymptomatically vulnerable.

Fuck, scary visual. Delta variant came common language wondered they‚Äôd impacted like Corona beer was‚Ä¶  question - got J&amp;J April - research people J&amp;J getting booster Pfeizer Moderna? 

Is safe? Talk playing long con. People think Reddit matters lol Ok would half them. Yes, COVID vaccination rate nurses 50%. Slightly RN slightly less aids. Doctors hand 96% vaccinated. mean cousin definitely thinks real. told ready go hospital multiple times made sure children knew was. thinks covid immune now. data showing really case. I'm going press much. say peace, ask really speak trusted doctor hers, take advise. Well, rode Sturgis top ten states covid deaths (per capita) last year. Let's see year. may want recheck sources children's susceptibility delta. different animal year ago.

I particularly want debate this. Information I've said wanted say. really need argue someone, plenty easier targets me. Calling Reddit comment section ‚Äúpulpit‚Äù giving forum far gravity due. matter fact even backwards countries like United States effective vaccines, effective treatments, mask mandates certain places like hospitals/airports/public transit. Saying otherwise distortion facts. link? Tough find good comparison different scenarios. would agree say safety standpoint (would much rather get infected post vaccine pre). issues work too. Everyone spouting stupid ass ""facts"" read Facebook. One owners, also masks/vaccines, got Covid got terribly sick. Like, kicked ass. got super worried quarantined wife caught likely would've died. Ever since made mandatory get vaccinated wear mask every second inside building. Even vaccinated wear masks front customers. 

tl;dr: sometimes takes someone higher chain command near-death experience change comes  65% got Pfizer 33% got Moderna FWIW Anyone original source article? network also said 16 days booster shot administered, protection infection jumps 95%. According report, level antibodies considerably higher within seven days shot, appear reach peak 16 days.

So people start get benefits booster week shot? That's quicker 2 weeks takes 2nd shot. Remember nobody cared COVID people flocking streets hundreds thousands protest police? care select circumstances, don‚Äôt actually care covid. You‚Äôre partisan hack.

Which basically everyone subreddit. couple weeks then. Yes! much time figure out! could many things make better. company pays lot insurance cost. believe figure company around $12,000 per employee. don‚Äôt think includes amount pay. bottom line US pays per capita 10 biggest industrial countries much worse outcome. charge smokers more. Smokers affect people‚Äôs health well. deserve pay people would ashamed? possibly going ride presidency 2024. think said true all.

Or, know, maybe don‚Äôt incur extra cost get vaccine. attitude. company costs $800 family per month. that‚Äôs employee‚Äôs share. employer‚Äôs share more. we‚Äôre large, self-funded company. That‚Äôs traffic control need get rid cop mistaken impression legislator. Self-righteous assholes understand scope jobs danger communities. Sorry loss. funeral home charged us small fee cremation well. got bill day cremated her. Thank goodness Tricare military covered bc can‚Äôt imagine getting bill like bad time. can‚Äôt imagine people going right losing someone covid turn around get gigantic bill. seems bring back around 95%, least data Israel looks like. comment got deleted. yeah. Point made. Good luck bruh mostly amount still hospitalized even die. Also reduce spread. believe 8-month timing measured 1st dose. 6-month timing measured 2nd dose, there's 4-5 week difference 2 recommendations.  things.

One doesn‚Äôt calculation showing impact vaccinated people wearing masks (hint: barely impacts Rt all).

Another doesn‚Äôt consider natural immunity all. likely thing going happen everyone infected next couple months, drive Rt down.

The final thing (if read rest Twitter) thinks aim covid zero, matter cost, think logic shines tweets. going protect people protected vaccine..yeah makes sense ""three-fold"" relation measurement concentration antibodies present blood. previously e.g. 300AU/mL (where AU appears directly measured aborption light) 900AU/mL. threefold times percentage. Sure, studies showing steady decrease vaccine efficiency time. Eg without boosters, COULD see significant increase hospitalizations/deaths vaccinated.  ‚ÄúHow get lunch Carl‚Äôs Jr. Hardee‚Äôs?‚Äù   Totally good. bit amazed comments here. think cats would like see unvaccinated perish responded comment included link Fauci saying 60%'s. Nice  hunch actually, though things covid landscape surprise knows. possible country might decide make boosters entry requirement, like made vaccinations entry requirement. guess. knows! records? go pharmacy right now, tell immunocompromised, they'll give booster, it'll record. They'll right 3rd shot card. 2 days 80k kid. funeral home charged us half cremation. Cadillac insurance even wife's 10 day hospital stay cost $3k pocket. Totally good. bit amazed comments admitting can't find quote saying it? I've asking since beginning seem completely unable find absolutely real thing said. I‚Äôm saying doesn‚Äôt I‚Äôm asking would ‚Äúgo back normal‚Äù distancing/masks still required stop spread. I‚Äôm seeing anything suggest vaccines us returning normal. feel forced stop red lights? one knows, here's good article kind breaks everything know, we're read it. Hey that's funny, actually went tech school audio bit joined FAA.

I concerned first mask messing things up. Overall, depends. people's voices benefit masks act sort low-pass filter they're actually easier understand. people garbles everything up. Overall, still able job, mask not, obviously enjoy talking without one more, hence got vaccine earlier.  crazy too. Glad see happening. Lmao ignoring active pandemic pretty obvious lack morality, empathy. Try sometime, might give different outlook right universal healthcare like every 1st world nation. kinds rules talking almost always exemptions unfortunate people. I‚Äôm saying anti vaxxers get shaft. ok bud? Need sit down? Good. got Moderna I‚Äôm interested hear say, especially dose. personally think another 100ug dose way high booster, least people 60. Huh? vaccine developed Pennsylvania 1919. Dear lord alarming NYT random blerb. Ok.

We always war Eastasia. would 100% lethal. Like want go country requires booster shot, record.

(Though knows countries distinguish vaccinated boostered.)    WSJ news report today Ok cool thanks. Interesting know. seems specifically AZ vaccine too. exclusive. much different US schools. spend, per pupil, much costs go state school. Yeah still baffles me. Loo pharmacist Chicago. making $120k-$160k. 

And going package, address, drop shipper deal eBay/PayPal.. $10/pop.

I imagine ideological reasons profit. missing hysteria obviously shown care, hence selfishness. 2 years row eh clarify:

I‚Äôm NYC, 34% Black New Yorkers fully vaccinated means 66% (2/3) Black New Yorkers unvaccinated. (It noted, vaccine months)

With mind, still completely ostracizing isolating society? get shot imma laugh sink debt

Nice. laugh everyone preventable medical issues going debt inability pay care?

Healthcare right free. contingent service corporation. long places...run out...of people infect? insane Texas FL seem plateaued high levels around 50% vaccinated? Even breakthroughs overlap infections...you would think would reaching sort inflection point? assumption too. need get super clever vaccine administration release atmosphere! 
(I know, know. tired nonsense) I‚Äôm sorry loss.   Serious question (disclaimer: ANTI VAXX BOOSTER) end? going keep getting boosters every 6 months years? once?  disagree thread? seems reasonable oh didnt know that. thanks. Masking distancing work. Long pretty well protected whether vaccinated not. think makes much difference whether live somewhere else. hard find quote? hope too. couldn‚Äôt imagine produce negative test week week hard headed get free vaccine.  Dude, remember January? Covid outta control we're sending kids back school anyway. never gonna end people charge complete lunatics playing dumbest society. Yep, danger rushed conversion causes done sorry issue mistake. give bonuses vaccinated instead restricting basic human right aren't. 

This barbaric would never happen civilized country provides rights citizens. Yeah, lie whatever get booster early probably going cause paperwork issues stuff line. ~~American~~ Republican.

What exactly 'three fold' mean?

Spread among vaccinated people drastically lower among unvaccinated. Fair every one self insure hundreds can't. 

And trying make excuse Delta pretty fucking weak honest. selling ideals result.

Harder measure masking, one, harder define benchmark ""adequate masking."" measure masking, use surveys, prone boatloads biases. know, pretty high degree certainty, masking works, controlled studies, impact sizable! also know cost masking comparatively quite small: cheap make slightly uncomfortable time. may know. :/ certainly considering US gov't gave Novavax 1.6 billion dollars develop it. heard discussion regarding ""hooks"" lungs? Yeah, 75% sure.  got booster 6 months Kaiser walk-ins anyone, well large clinic areas staffed large crowd, suspect open seniors soon. Technically approved FDA yet, expected soon. Pfizer submitting data booster shot week. Wat got 2 weeks later could get appointment, ended Moderna would gotten Pfizer one available time.

I would trust Pfizer least done good job could time development. medicine cabinet full stuff made Pfizer, works. 

I understand implicit distrust company. make effective, proven medicines vaccines.

And missing whole point getting vaccine. whole point get fast could limit spread extension, limit chance mutation. People like waited simply even bothered reason absolutely fucked least another year.

And no, 100% effective, vaccine absolutely 100%, pretty close helps prevent infected folks vaccine needing hospital bed. That's second important point here. someone needs get emergency surgery, could bed recover in. instead, ton jerks refused vaccine taking bed away someone else needs it.

Folks get vaccine willingly endangering community. zero patience left kind depraved indifference. Sending children school middle pandemic causes outbreaks?!?! say!!! File story shit Sherlock. Good. calling well. needs happen time. critical threshold vaccination estimated least 90 per cent Ontario population, 100 per cent vaccine-eligible population,‚Äù Public Health Ontario says.

Over 100 percent. Good messaging, there. sure hope hit critical threshold vaccinating people people. though wear mask inside public places lately. go eat (inside restaurants), movies, shopping, theater, vacation, etc.

I guess there's one thing cruising. Things crazy terms shifting rules pick vacation, I'll wait stabilizes. become endemic summing final two paragraphs. first dose early January second early February. Either way, want booster ASAP. nursing homes job additionally 3 kids young vaccine. Given hard lockdown vaccinations fast enough, I'm quite sure ""worked"".

No, we're hard lockdown Covid leaked MIQ arriving another country.

We still data know whether vaccinated 'good enough' allow covid without least *attempting* stop right start that. still choice, would really hope even everyone vaccinated already magically, we'd still lockdown right would *dumb* sitting back going 'well, know person covid starting spread sure *could* quick lockdown try stamp again, sit back learn well vaccines actually work hard way"".

It's either situation. vaccinated backstop still try make sure infectious disease running rampant. data in, reduce rate spreads.

Here's response, we'll likely hit steady state 76,000 annual deaths year less (after losing another 670,000 people, getting errybody else vaccinated). steady state likely yield fewer fewer deaths per year decades nearly gone. winter gonna rough. It‚Äôs always nothing. Covid increases risk blood clots multiple patients new onset A-fib, however good size percentage chest pain ends lung related rather heart.

There issue that. boost on. natural immunity + vaccine induced immunity keep hospital system epidemiologists believe wearing masks [...] may required next several decades

There way going get everyone board wearing masks *for decades*. eliminated threat hospital system, people going go lives without them.

How dating work masks? Young people going go out, make one another, sex one another, on. going change incompatible permanent masking. Permanent masking also means (or logically mean) indoor dining bars. theaters concessions. on. Finally, ~half population board now, really think going feel small sacrifice reduce impact virus common cold future generations.

She neglects natural immunity, [recent suggests least good vaccine-induced immunity (if survive! obviously much better get vaccinated!). CDC estimates *before delta* 1/3 Americans previous infection. Almost everyone unvaccinated probably going get infected wave. (Not saying good, saying going happen).

She also angling justify universal masking, fine *until kids vaccinated*. reason support get everyone mask up, masks vaccinated make big impact. don't. Re=8(1-.5*.85) = 4.6 need masks again!!

Yet, using reasonable mask efficacy, calculation would Re=8(1-.5(.85)-0.5(0.15)(0.7)) = 4.2 calls change marginal considering boosters, yet somehow important here? There's reason left out, hurts universal masking argument.

Finally, consider entire population vaccinated. Re=8(1-1(.85)) = 1.2 reasoning, need mask *literally forever* maintain Re&lt;1. unreasonable. vaccines infection-induced immunity dramatically reduce instances severe disease. going permanently mask prevent virus circulating forever everyone immunity.

Pizza toppings way harder question. headline buries risks even higher among contracted virus. extra 11 cases condition every 100,000 people infected coronavirus, compared not.

Along risks associated catching Covid, also risk myocarditis. risk higher among vaccinated.

I'm doctor, apparently myocarditis cases usually mild go away generally treatable serious cases. get myocarditis otherr viruses common cold, also potential side effect smallpox vaccine.

Delta companies 100 employees self-funded. half, jesus christ. Thats terrible news. Baby refrigerated trailer therapy help cure covid cause I've seeing lot southern cities requesting it? pay lot life insurance, makes feel better. Thanks! less save money

Not true, junk food cheaper healthy food. Living longer present immediate benefit like saving insurance. Self funded health plans, like Delta‚Äôs, insurance. Thus subject insurance regulations. anyone provide quote Fauci saying 60% population would enough herd immunity? I've looked best could find talking vaccine efficacy /u/WrenBoy able find either. NJ. Proud state. that‚Äôs correct. you‚Äôre failing draw distinction whole parts whole, classic logical fallacy. soccer team made people, doesn‚Äôt mean people soccer teams. Ugh guy. Go away Abbott Part FDA approval process inspection manufacturing plants, product validation integrity supply chain. Also, there's US patent filed 3 vaccines foreign ones bunch countries- whole discussion ""waiving patent rights"" months back. ingredients actually patented along manufacturing process - one FDA reviewed approved. believes FDA, CDC Patent Office it, along **independent** board reviewed vaccine prior EUA, academics studied it, luck. would take conspiracy tens thousands one talking. Keep trying though, right even recognize it. give fucking ideas Delta self-funded healthcare. insurance. company collects premiums puts special bank account pay claims happen. hire company administer plan behalf. 

Unfortunately third party administrator usually company *also* provides health insurance. employees idea it‚Äôs actual insurance. still significant chance getting severe case long term impairment, really problem. However good chance transmitting others, example unvaccinated children. People also fuck boomer is. boomers born 1946 1964. means 60's older. Yeah, people age might ride across country rally, attendees probably younger gen x.

So yeah, might true boomers vaccinated, mean attendees boomers. Eh, could put as, ""other honorable"". that's thing still do, idk shit current military, much one tried join couple times kid lol. dishonestly move goalposts again? 

Goalposts never moved. beginning I've asked one thing: source Fauci said 60% would enough herd immunity. searching internet find single article video quoting saying anything like that. asked provide it, instead kept defending bad source instead providing information. true, would easy find. turns werent direct quote do?

What exactly think quote is? feel like half arguments rely using words incorrectly. literally never posted Fauci quote. Once. wasted time finding quote would likely pretend didnt know common words meant avoid admitting proven wrong, already done conversation, maybe would edit comments replied order insult behind back, also done conversation.

What mean waste time? said enough say authority easy find. take time need step away screen bit think why. behaviour unhealthy.

Ah yes, unhealthy want someone back claims. guess healthy thing would believe face value spread disinformation? good day hope tomorrow finds better spirits.

I hope tomorrow realize reading articles people know difference vaccine efficacy vaccination rate. It‚Äôs offensive it‚Äôs harsh reality. Obese people starve short amounts time completely fine. Yes refer covidestim. could prolong pandemic. So.... People understand still need keep social distance even we're fully vaccinated. Right?  Ok going happen.

Just let unvaccinated make bed lay it. I‚Äôm gonna live life normal. 40 year old brother law wife there. kids aren‚Äôt playing cousins time soon. fucking time still lot chances dying hospitalized. unvaccinated person goes nightclub get severe disease, them.

I think vaccine passes would make safer, hope use them, well mandate masking (but can't actually read article speak language, know). would helpful put percentage unvaccinated people hospitalized next statistic. It‚Äôs also strange stat. Percentage vaccinated hospitalized‚Ä¶.of course probably low unvaxed counting‚Ä¶what‚Ä¶all people state? would helpful would comparison percentage hospitalized vaxed/unvaxed percentage vaxed hospitalized. Thank use reddit chat?  Yup Right, instead average 227 deaths day last week like 277 per day. backdated road. definitely wasn‚Äôt vaccinated.

I got angry Covid hit FL (where family) last year summer wave hit. preventable, knew COVID-19 was, lot people die here. inexcusable.


Now like WTF want lose people? Daily vaccinations risen slightly. never low enough inconsequential.

You get *a different vaccine* flu shots annually. similarity booster get regularly. There's always disconnect sorts people make lots noise online people ""real life"". Lockdowns type thing wear people quickly ""work"" long seems like imminent extreme danger. threat longer novel, seem like imminent issue. There's end sight covid we've living almost two years now. US trouble getting people evacuate hurricane people even seem novel - they've dealt hurricanes know they'll keep coming. 

I know get Australia. I'm surprised protests even bigger are. I'm sure keep growing rate. 

None say covid taken seriously, lockdown method never something could kept long term places. 100%. Cancer patients getting denied fucking crime. Put people purposefully endanger back line. Well, idiots ""Try collect all!"" imply even statistically significant result? Based CIs, even within confidence interval study data determined risen 81% pre-delta 84% now? Get state. appreciate input. truly attempting speak general terms somehow discount children live type mental physical challenges disabilities actual real kids. hope came across OK. 

In similarly respectful manner, strongly think particular situation intended people know (teachers, parents others) telling kids simply ""never going listen adults wear mask"". think are, pointing one child going child going through, reason disallow requiring children wear masks school day, would like suggesting administer vaccines sometimes people still get virus vaccinated. make broad decisions based broad data. making comment similar fashion. 

I think know felt need make clarification reading comment. took use word hypothetical mean child real, apologize. meant.

&amp;#x200B;

I got 3rd Moderna due immunosupressed. wonder much difference it'll make Delta. appears vaccination provides higher level protection protection fades much quicker immunity acquired infection. leads natural immunity higher levels protection medium long term. lot what, exactly? 60 kids worth wearing masks for? 160? 1,600? 16,000?

I think fundamental disconnect people. 60 lot absolute terms, lot viewed trivially preventable.

Keep mind 60 single small state, single moment time. Tennesee 6m America's 331m population. lets multiple 60, 3310 children USA follows Tennesee's lead. Thats though, assume ~2 week hospital visit, let's multiple get rough count kids coming 3 months: 19,860 kids hospital due trivially preventable illness.

This also ignoring fact covid ton negative outcomes included hospitalization count. missed school, kids could wearing masks continuing learn? weeks home feeling like shit? bringing home killing grandma? mom getting long covid?

Viewing ""just 60 kids hospital"" short sighted. 10s thousands cases USA alone reinfection covid. Nothing guaranteed virus natural immunity. child‚Äôs school Chicago suburbs. Went parent / student orientation week ago - everyone masked, nobody complained, nobody asked long wear them, every kid wears day except lunch, nobody trying fight anyone else it. know Hollywood movies elections - underrepresented. Even third, that's still third ~50 million children 12. would ~5% jump overall vaccination rate country.  understand headline could read 299,999 every 300,000 people Texas using...blah blah. write article?

Everything drama. would thought Ted Cruz would runner competition kill Texans?  mistrust expert opinion develop vacuum

True. developed environment ignorance. environment pathologic political mythologies - e.g. primacy ""freedom"" reason, ethics, compassion, humanity, common sense. environment sheltered real consequences, people ""free"" believe anything emanating furthering discussion hope posting comment

You comment either honest, case ignorant strongly doubt progress could made. honest, case kind shilling one political agendas major cause current troubles.

""The sky actually pink, greek polka dots, welcome constructive criticism"" - yeah, sure. Next topic, rather dismissive response

Also appropriate response.

Have nice day. definitely feel there, I'm hopeful us north since I'm already seeing vaccine mandates indoor activities, well masking pop again, relatively low covid positivity rates. 

I'm still waiting vaccine mandates universities breathe proper sigh relief. getting booster six months after, anyone know exact date on. example, second dose March 31. 6 months would September 30th. get booster time September wait October? really matter all? never shut schools 

[Many schools *do* close flu season, Despite media coverage, clear Delta worse Lambda. need look Florida, go see solid example Lambda massively outcompeted. 
Same Colombia variant, gotten media attention. better strategy might designate hospitals COVID units others treat regular patients.  Fuck yeah! Put unidentified chemicals arm please! zero interest miserable breakthrough cases I‚Äôve reading about. Correction: mean specifically verified COVID cases unvaccinated. Absence ICU beds requires triage, vaccinated better chance - purely statistically. Hi took second dose yesterday I‚Äôm currently ER 150 pulse rate really bad chest pains  person responding said Covid deaths increased daily death toll FL 40%. part comment response complex understand? Surprised stories like this. closest thing think naked athena incident portland BLM protests. stripped nothing hat mask protest policy brutality, anti-maskers. Bloody bloody Kristi Noem ass. everything doctors told still died. There's actually good discussion particular paper:
 RIP George Carlin took flu shots every year whole lives, abnormal take shot 2x year vs 1x? Maybe start giving employees long enough breaks food flights might even less health issues. Yes!!!!!  actually quite shame 180 Rogan made

Back early March 2020, Dr. Michael Olsterholm show, seemed like Joe realized dangerous pandemic could become

Yet fast forward months, he's completely reversed perspective. guess Rogan kind agrees whatever guest says show, internalize company. I‚Äôm permanently remote still required.  another minimum 4.5 months least (more likely closer 6.5 months since every kid get shot once) many would consider safe kids go back normal. March 2022. two years many children things disrupted. I'm education, kids education disrupted two years point, extremely difficult impossible catch up. potentially fucking generation children socially, emotionally, academically worth protecting COVID-19?

Edit- 2/2021. brain fried. wondering legal given legal restrictions price discrimination ACA, simple loophole done. 

An insurance company cannot charge individual vaccinated. That's legal. charge entire company across board perceived actual increases healthcare costs. order companies like Delta avoid insurance costs hiked point implement measures, Delta charging employees insurance companies therefore legal. New York reporting deaths Worldometer Florida fraction cases vaccine would help, would make things ever slightly worse.

The virus run usual course, fight immune system expending small percentage resources killing vaccine-based antigens. Consider listening medical professionals instead whoever listening previously way Delta made decision without consulting legal counsel.

Thankfully N95 mask shortage seems vaccine even though declining efficiency still enough prevent getting severe illness right anyway. It‚Äôs vaccinated filling hospitals could also seeing testing ceiling. positivity going down, signifies. keep number cases long time three approaches dealing virus:

The first Beyblade: **let rip**. seen variations ‚Äúherd immunity via natural antibodies‚Äù approach Florida Texas without (last year) (this year) vaccine. states getting hammered, getting hammered, worst yet come. don‚Äôt think many people support approach, fundamental assumption static virus evolve completely blown water. allowed spread, virus evolve get worse. viable national option, especially know effects long CoVID. 

The second option **mitigation**. Mitigation requires strict rules strict enforcement, neither ever present point pandemic. Effective mitigation also depends mass adoption, even case vaccines. also encourages proliferation unsettled science, undermines trust media political institutions time (remember ‚Äúkids can‚Äôt catch virus, don‚Äôt get sick‚Äù last year? ‚Äúschools safe Delta surge based data last year‚Äôs Alpha variant?)

This also dead end, politically viable lots room scale mitigation efforts. None made progress toward ending pandemic, settling mitigation implies willingness live virus level. Corona eradicated, evolve, cycle mitigation continue things reach breaking point politically,, economically, scientifically (with regards hospital system rate spread/severity symptoms). 

The third option **elimination**. Given common knowledge virus‚Äô ability mutate something infectious severe also evade vaccines, inhumane accept ‚Äúliving virus‚Äù. supported closing everything vaccine came last year, didn‚Äôt anything resembling that, look are. support closing everything kids 12 get vaccinated, reopening local city-by-city county-by-county basis. in-person school important (as teacher, sympathetic argument), keep everything else closed besides schools grocery stores/liquor stores first, pay essential workers double triple. Everyone else gets $2000/month (along essential workers - insist they‚Äôre ‚Äúheroes‚Äù, we‚Äôre gonna put money mouth is).

Well guns shoot virus, they're already protected.  Taiwan harsh lockdown say peaked cases hit time high highest ever positivity training  authorize now, instead waiting. Let's forget experts initially said nothing worry about... human human transmission, flu, mask work. Science takes time, brigaiding nothing. Plus, conservative estimate would every case counted they‚Äôre missing 3-4. that‚Äôs 100k new cases every day, people contagious 3-14 days (let‚Äôs call 5 average, idea) that‚Äôs half million Floridians walking around spraying diseases aerosols given day. Pretty sure game say ""wear mask chin"" So, Delta's delta premium delta? nothing new another shitty headline On-site testing best travel! Makes life much easier.

Still, saturday test volume 2/3rds previous 3 saturdays sunday test volume less half. Friday testing volume also seems low compared previous weeks, especially given case surge happened time. 

But data 19th seems fairly complete compared previous weeks 12th-19th 7 day averages seems pretty flat. perhaps they're least rapid growth cases. beyond too. problem principle, makes perfect sense, sentence sure trip (or used trip up) people.   None pocket health insurance lol, skimped paid price that's system works ‚ÄúDue increased transmissibility partial vaccine escape ability Delta B.1.617.2 variant dominant‚Äù.

That‚Äôs contradiction title! there‚Äôs already breakthrough variant, current vaccine won‚Äôt able achieve anything similar title! add inevitable future new variant capable breakthrough vaccine, even difficult!

We need new better vaccine that, that‚Äôs conclusion getting clearer every week. sooner accept probable scenario better future. FIFTY? 

Damn!  higher viral load, Delta transmission makes original strain look like joke. combination two nightmare scenario. people protected right combination natural antibodies previous infection + recent, fresh vaccination. article specifically states closing window Crucially, window rapidly closing biological feasibility conducting critical trace-back people animals inside outside China. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies wane, collecting samples testing people might exposed December 2019 yield diminishing returns. Chinese wildlife farms employ millions people (14 million, according 2016 census^11 ) supplied live mammals cities across China, including Wuhan^3. response SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many farms closed animals culled, making evidence early coronavirus spillover increasingly difficult find.

I'd looking know whether sort ""window"" really even open SARS MERS. (From recall, got lucky SARS fact somebody found cave years later multiple bat viruses different portions looking for.) Screw judgment, right kid. Good ya. yall finding n95s? find kn95s  exactly concern! 8 months early December, right *after* thanksgiving. prediction legal battle end up? got booster 10 days ago CVS wrote card updated state (California) passport next day. vaccine passport shows two original shots booster. point kids going person school economy. cvs every corner. go another one. won‚Äôt care.  already pay some. I‚Äôm subscribing every fucking website there, ‚Äòpaywall‚Äô valid comment can‚Äôt read content someone attempting post.  One thing people keep mind people say ""wait 12 vaccine"" 1/3 12-18 population vaccinated. going guess going shake 12. feel desire under-12 vaccine perhaps overrepresented. word caution: Family members mine Florida hosted party late July pretty much superspreader event. One person came despite sick found COVID got home. then, damage done.

I exact numbers 'many' got COVID (according person hosted party). got COVID vaxxed mild. Another family member hospitalized, spent time ICU, recovering. Another guest hospitalized. everyone got tested, I'm sure minimal contact tracing. 

People traveled party several states knows many cases single event caused. 

You need assess what's best you, keep bigger picture mind. $$  feel like need data people received shots. it‚Äôs 6-8 months, duh, people going get it. need approve booster. think first time I've felt true sense hopelessness throughout entire pandemic. Every time feels like we've turned corner get punched face again. emerging variants, anti-vaxxers, lack access vaccines internationally, see end sight. much supply hand normal times? sure bad, would interesting compare though would know bad. friend Florida who's sick can't even go hospital confinement... could get paid more, starters. solve everything course, might help burn out. pay it, people. need fund journalism. canceled plans see family winter I‚Äôm anxious rising case numbers state, plus fact vaccine hesitancy still going strong there. Super mad sad it. Yeah, that. sounds like want scare away vaccine. Ugh. thing unpopular masks schools another lockdown.

This won‚Äôt happen. One hospital's live ICU department full Covid 19 patients.
None vaccinated still denying Covid young healthy etc right needed bipap ventilator.
It always amazes perfectly healthy people would buy conspiracy theories rather wear mask get vaccinated.
I almost died Covid 19 last year left lowered lung capacity due double pneumonia.
I caught February even though wear masks wash hands.
Probably covidiots go shops unmasked contaminate every thing touch .
Thankfully pneumonia time.
Thankfully 6 weeks second infection received first jab I'm fully vaccinated.
I still wear mask whilst shopping know bad get never want ill ever again.   way know many died subtract last weeks total death number weeks (42,252 deaths).

And 4% vaccinated tourists apparently vaxxed people realize.

Oh cases/death numbers include non-residents worse people think. we‚Äôll focus effective preventing DISEASE INFECTION

It's unfortunate ever pivoted like this, exactly vaccines designed do. They're supposed keep getting sick, trace amounts viral matter detected nose. I‚Äôm 3 months. go Walgreens? no, dude, never end long dumbass redneck evangelicals refuse get vaccinated. fine. need repeat first dose. Maf hard.  Percentage vaccinated hospitalized it‚Äôs effectiveness. control group idea many vaccinated infected hospitalized. percentage vaccinated goes up, amount infected hospitalized go well. However, overall cases hospitalization lower. 

You thought experiment taking 2 groups 100 people. exposed Covid level cause infection. group 75% vaccinated group B 25% vaccinated. vaccine 80% effective would 15 vaccinated infected group 25 unvaccinated infected. 40% infection vaccinated. group B would 5 vaccinated infected 75 unvaccinated infected. 6% infection vaccinated group B. group seems breakthroughs group B, don‚Äôt. Total infections 40 group 80 group B. 

Hospitalization efficacy works confounding factors. likely immune compromised vaccinated hospital. Israel reported 40% vaccinated hospitalized patients immune compromised. Anyone age 70 gets breakthrough greater chance hospitalization due serious co-morbidities. national database digital vaccination cards scannable check database

There's need check central database. digital signature card also works. going run fire puss small needle. adds up. Fucking leave Florida then. putting children risk, LEAVE. brother. 
The thing gets whole stealth thing. Yeah get one wants take blame, reality pandemic. scientist identify source, much closer finding solution, able stop happening again.


Unfortunately pipedream. Especially part stopping happening again. okay people currently dying governor send political message?

Still high enough definitely better 1/3.  US.

We bought enough 600 million Americans get doses iirc. 200 million least one dose. I've always wondered this. got virus week first shot, received 2nd shot three weeks that.

I imagine immunity higher most. 

It's four months now. He's rich white dude. insulated wants given area. I'm sure lives near bunch rich white dudes. hangs social places rich white dudes. Sure, source Israel CDC p.28/32.

My original response removed apparently livescience considered ""political source""? That's weird. replaced another one.   virus really mutate though.

Lmao, going deal climate change can‚Äôt even basic ass shit deal covid.  1st dose - sore arm, tired half day, 2nd dose - sore arm, tired day, GI issues around 5 days, 3rd dose - sore arm, tired day, achy joints couple days. 2nd shot def worst three me. vaccines finance Ron, Regeneron does.  Ending pandemic. exit ramp country endemic status, nowhere near that. Everyone needs someone life give little slap bring back reality. hope someone time another shot. Ah yes get rewatching. 

I think terribly widespread, yeah hospitalized could absolutely faked manner. I'd suspicious anyone 55-60 hospitalized, since Israel data showed couple people ages needing hospitalizations. People leave return environment hourly. much 25% breakthrough infection rate parts US.  


The metric achieved, wait it... fewer cases COVID-19.  


We stop paying attention pandemic pandemic.   Delta fit variant currently outcompeting Lamba worldwide dominance. Good news guess. I'm pro vax masking, eat mask safely? this, we're dining out. Welcome team sanity never go away we'll never get 100% vaccination. always new people born, get vaccinated, etc. viruses.

Eventually at-risk people either get vaccinated die deaths stop occurring. Young people grow world less prevalent probably get vaccinated kids, virus become endemic another rare cause illness. end game focusing vaccines. get want offer protection possible mask it‚Äôs counter intuitive enforce dumb population uses anti vax fuel. definitely another tool toolbox. bit problematic requires right circumstances, money, amount expertise well.

I talked employer. continuing use MERV 8 filters that's system handle (these little nothing viral particles). also reluctant introduce fresh air HVAC loop mold issues past. basically, technical reasons, nothing sticking closed-circuit virus recirculation system. here, Pfizer wanted see could boost Moderna. expect recommendation follow overwhelming amounts data, lot ""mixing"" done globally seemingly good results.

So many people like picture victims, conveniently unloads blame failures onto shoulders others. huge difference massively invasive surgery shot minimal documented side effects. compare two equivalent irresponsible. Serious question though, seeing boosters literally started used. possibly good effectiveness data booster? Agreed üíØ H (many?), ignorance truly bliss Really long play continue vaccinate planet. virus many hosts mutate now, way forward muddle through. boosters part long play. They'll keep things going longer, different boosters necessary.

We think like game war, something eventually win lose, that's case. Life keeps going, throwing new challenges new possibilities us, simply try keep up! never pretty. surprised say supposed take exact vaccine year year. really make sense science data support that. original idea behind boosters going develop variants, sort like happens flu shots. question new variants every year like flu.

It would surprise vaccinations start look lot like flu... 50% population takes years they're risk particularly new strain variant comes around, meanwhile lot people bother. videos great. 

In one, nuts, while, much. Like last guy white white beard talking black guy.

I feel like could interesting conversation try cold-cock agreeing 100%. Tennessee schools open several weeks, believe bit science behind thinking understand perspective year ago, we're going year 3 months. time plan.  also pretty bad august Right Yup. going recommend realistically experimental see downsides likely low upshot pretty huge. Aaaand that‚Äôs starts. 

We need stop expecting people think let vocal know avoid. 

Because telling they‚Äôre wrong banning makes double build echo chamber somewhere can‚Äôt see. 

That‚Äôs get capital riots.  Noone said anything though. actually visiting family Ohio she'll going back eventually coming home quarantining. fine, mostly worried getting sick greatest health. There‚Äôs tons articles posted. Studies show anywhere 15-40% drop efficacy. get posted every day. That‚Äôs boosters for. ER nurse here; vaccines 6 months ago.

I'm exposed lot Covid coughing. much suspect antibodies constantly re-engaged. 

I'm wondering would benefit booster shot. Given circumstance, could benefit it?

I‚Äôm wondering how/why saying she‚Äôs lying none said account impossible. Literally nothing WHO/CDC etc would flat say claims impossible. actually idea comes every then. Lock entire jurisdiction like 2 weeks, let existing cases get past contagious phase, good go.

First all, can't even get people wear masks stop going bars, anything requires high level discipline seems completely window.

Secondly, unless Iceland New Zealand, way prevent new cases entering jurisdiction later.

So intrigued idea, think practical objections.   end hospital booster shot would like rolling nat 1 d20, getting 1, 2, 3 d100. Incredibly unlikely, words. Making shy 2000$ day that.   Sure, agree, everything help end pandemic (got vaccinated first opportunity, urged everyone know get shots, helped older people book appointments, etc.). understand Delta masks still important situations, especially places like schools large numbers unvaccinated people. 

But also think lot people scientists medical professionals, rely others information what's going on, need see folks positions authority start least talking direct way needs achieved numerically return full normal. let's honest~ majority people USA want normal back, restrictions etc... regardless people talk ""new normal"", reality overwhelming majority people happening. Actual normal what's going happen, powers-that-be start laying map get there, people going say ""f-ck it"" go back normal causing additional deaths virus spreading etc. (take look around country, already happened lot places). We're human, mental health toll continued restrictions end sight real lot people. Extraordinary asks like distancing masks long periods time require, think, framework laid based numbers hospitlizations, vaccine uptake, etc. done returning normal. I'm arguing personally, know, fact agree still dangerous territory proceed cautious, laying think key problem terms Covid communication charge general public. People need goal concrete ""less Covid"" think. pandemic ""end"" definition endpoint agreed upon. 

If ""endpoint"" cases excess mortality falling certain threshold, example, there's clear unambiguous demarcation point expiry mandates. total eradication, likely impossible particular virus, goalposts simply moved indefinitely. think there's third category: people *want* believe vaccine conspiracy, therefore believe stuff supports this.

Personally, think category biggest. theories case, they're complex (and boring) post here. get third shot nowhere?

Yup. got last Pfizer shot April, spoke Pharmacist last Friday got booster.  T-shirts still available cherish time forever. subjective: ""Uncontrollably"" ""overwhelmed"" 

I see cdc release recommendations state states still thresholds. 

But lead burried.

I think plan presented / repeated actual figures people would less reluctant go along it.

Right there's finish line. I‚Äôm sure vaccine designed target delta feasibly made. far I‚Äôm aware, main issue Delta much change spike protein, rather fast replicates high viral load has.

So unless new vaccine somehow makes B Cells react much faster delta, I‚Äôm sure really point creating delta specific vaccine. online friend mine lives Florida return office today. said gets emails everyday saying 1 2 people office tested positive. Surprised nobody made joke Japanese liking foreign anything racism yet. You‚Äôre jumping extremes lot certainty something uncertain. Oh ok Israel started awhile ago. Cool, thank accepting correction. There‚Äôs still lot misinformation coming folks know better, it‚Äôs frustrating. Hopefully links helpful. 

And fwiw, believe people understand sars-cov-2 causes Covid-19. That‚Äôs true. vaccines safe effective. You‚Äôre extremely unlikely get serious case COVID less likely get compared someone unvaccinated. Throwing feces. stupidity madness come this. Could envisioned Trump pandemic? Ignorant, addled primates, folks. stuff sister described seeing worked mental hospitals. patients excuse, ill. Thank speaking here, least, tough issue. respiratory issues Covid, cause inflammation heart month, raised BP dangerous levels, gave faster heart beat general left supra-ventricular tachycardia (where top part heart goes 75bpm 175bpm may stay interrupt something like valsalva maneuver). think lot nerve damage/electrical issues caused inflammation.   Vaccines carry *antigens*‚Äî antibodies themselves. subsequent antibodies upon vaccinated literally created body, using exactly process responds actual live viruses. They‚Äôre real rest immune system. Covid affecting healthcare providers everywhere doctor last Friday non-covid reasons. get CT scan STAT. got call yesterday schedule CT scan. Preee-cisely. wondered well. I'm sure wife thought ask him.  UK 8-12 weeks apart far there's evidence dropping protection levels IIRC  year half people made minds pure lies... lol

Better late never guess? Obviously, wearing N95 mask work. cloth mask loose-fitting surgical mask. 

I assume already that. No, avoiding. ...and sure shit mind taking money giving shot long take it. hope funneling money elsewhere. 


edit: rephrase. ‚ÄúPossibility surge pediatric hospitalizations threatens already-crippled health care system.‚Äù Delta way transmitable. nobody's surprised. Sadly. Yeah... gonna pretty grim get there. here. Basically everyone know vaccinated. don‚Äôt even know single person breakthrough infection yet. knew people got covid spring 2020 winter 2021 waves, vaccines widely available, don‚Äôt know anyone gotten wave. Yet numbers don‚Äôt lie; pandemic worst it‚Äôs since last winter. feels like it‚Äôs happening people‚Äôs families people‚Äôs friends. crazy, family lives one southern states see news highest numbers cases.  imagined cockney accent.


FROW FANCY DRESS FER TH' OLD DODGE DART, YEH? Someone thread discussing 66 percent efficacy pointed 
1) confidence interval extremely high, stat may still incorrect
2) control group unvaccinated people likely natural antibodies due infection, control initial trials. could explain apparent fall efficacy.

That helps anxiety little, I'm still wearing masks foreseeable future getting booster first day available me. US schools are, though past week. never took hateful mindset assume non-vaccinated people. neither non-vaccinated people know. 

Its pretty awful thing assume. Parents think ""control"" child wears mask school school enforce fooling themselves. couple maskless kids class inspire rest take masks off

On bright side, hard imagine people turn Republicans party next election display awful leadership. never imagined guy like Trump could elected, yet are, still suffering incompetence venality many months gone. Yup, long Florida numbers ""ok"" ignored studies numbers states. 

I would love investigation fla numbers. correct answer. substantial portion population truly give shit anyone outside family.  Even LPN make bank traveling. offered like 2500 week go different places I'm new grad. still RN program I'd jumping every opportunity. Closed mindedness quality lemmings all. Delta variant? Maybe. Now? Nope. got permabanned completely unrelated sub asking ‚Äúwhy corona virus spammed sub working out?‚Äù 

I literally wanted context asked going on/how relevant. 

I got permaban power mod asked clarification muted couldn‚Äôt even get response. 

Instead stopping spread misinfo it‚Äôs usually power tripping people agenda. That‚Äôs one jokes you‚Äôre supposed take seriously. Tents outdoors, uncomfortable. Yeah Rand Paul made millions snd he‚Äôs dumb AF schools school boards seem ones standing sociopath implementing masking, basically Florida one big super spreader event right now.

Forget 'God's waiting room', Florida 'God's Express Ride Afterlife'. going requirement society. Im much vaccine all, easy going government private businesses get together basically force citizens exactly want future, making impossible live without want. thoughts future beyond illnesses, decades line. Well I'd say Delta meeting unvaccinated people caused it. love God approve age group 5-12 already. That's billing rate. nurse themself gets lot less...unless fully independent case there's lot overhead deal with. going transport people to? Who's going who's paying it? even know possible transport someone who's ill, especially ventilator.

That's false assumption threat cities. transmissible cases multiply every infected person.

But using assumption, imagine NYC stamped COVID 100%. open among (very low ball estimate) 10 thousand tourists 100 infected.

In month they'll back thousands cases per day. takes longer rural areas effect same, probably worse lack common sense prevention like masks indoors. live, people spotted speaking multiple school districts' board meetings. kids. culture war audition get Fox News. people belong one PAC another. Well...shit. Seems unattainable given vaccine hesitancy. hope softer 2nd Moderna dose, worst fever life. end game focusing vaccines.

Vaccines necessary sufficient. panacea. Vaxx + mask + distance. ü•î &lt; Here, he's listening.  know legislation, resident semi-rural area people legit give fuck. There's masks anywhere actually ask teens back gas station cause like 6in away line. people care. wanna go HHN seeming gonna happen 2nd year row sounds likely. EMT/ER tech/ turned PA, many friends medicine including docs (some I‚Äôve dated‚Ä¶ know long convos topic venting true feelings)‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre getting hate 100% correct.

People say mRNA vaccine new that‚Äôs true. types vaccines researched studied 10 years more.

These vaccines studied analyzed tested medications FDA history. Nothing covered up. Unless stay home bubble, everybody problem......

We vaccines now, quarantine anymore apparently south, especially Florida, dont care dont check there's something working immunocompromised people makes eligible third. I'd call working school ""working with""   pet peeve mine: write-ups never say confidence intervals (spoiler alert: they're big).

Yeah, things going ought called articles like this.

1. sample size unvaccinated people far smaller vaccinated people getting harder harder find unvaccinated people participate study like 4,217 participants, 3,483 (83%) vaccinated

2. large growing time percentage unvaccinated people natural immunity prior infection. saw commentary epidemiologist weeks back stating effect could account almost entire drop apparent vaccine effectiveness time longer control group naive immune response. proper study would test antibodies group rather relying previous laboratory-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection

3. infections vaccinated group (34 case) 1 1 fewer infection make huge difference calculated effectiveness.  states banned religious exemptions vaccinations schools, states should. Vaccinations mandatory jobs. -

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) weighed guidance answers workplace vaccination questions. example, agency said federal anti-discrimination laws prohibit employers requiring employees physically enter workplace vaccinated COVID-19.

""If employee cannot get vaccinated disability sincerely held religious belief, reasonable accommodation possible, employer could exclude employee physically entering workplace,""

Some organizations firing employees comply vaccine mandate. federal judge recently sided large hospital system chose fire employees refused shot. lead plaintiff challenged policy ""is refusing accept inoculation that, hospital's judgment, make safer [workers patients],"" judge easy say good information good bad information bad. practice doesnt mean much.

I permanently banned vaxxhappened posting link Science Magazine, one approved good information good sources page date figures vaccine efficacy Delta shared petition.

Thats reality happen. power mod charge hundreds subs poor grasp information ban people ahe perceives different side. trying reassure nothing fear trying research many people serious complications vaccine, matter phrase google searches get wall articles telling it‚Äôs safe there‚Äôs nothing worry about, without providing data I‚Äôm looking comfort with.

The number people worldwide deadly complications virus 4.5 million makes feel better it. go get damn shot BC's vaccine passport system strict, even medical exemptions allowed. can't use negative test result instead.

I interested see results higher vaccination rates compared regions vaccine passports less strict. part problem Same, healthcare worker fully vaccinated since January I'm getting anxious man wearing protective mask, amid coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, stands front second Paralympic flame cauldron Ariake Yume-no-Ohashi Bridge, day official opening Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games, Tokyo, Japan, August 25, 2021.

I‚Äôve trying reassure nothing fear trying research many people serious complications vaccine, matter phrase google searches get wall articles telling it‚Äôs safe there‚Äôs nothing worry about, without providing data I‚Äôm looking comfort with. 

I think I‚Äôm going cancel appointment again. don‚Äôt want person, concerns data covered up. want information know nothing worry about. no, google covers assume everyone going use data fuel stupid anti-vax propaganda Baloney. state Florida changes reporting whenever thinks numbers make Dear Leader look bad. example, went weekly reporting instead daily ‚Äúthe numbers down, let‚Äôs get back normal.‚Äù go back daily numbers broke records? course not. 26k cases 24th, way, according Agriculture department. 

My county using bleach instead oxygen purify water oxygen needed covid people. bodies literally piling ceiling funeral homes. deaths somehow look manageable. Hm, wonder why. Could fight court slowing spread schools? Dear Leader wants covid spread unchecked, record deaths makes argument little harder. Better see week‚Äôs real numbers couple months now, case decided. 

I live here. know exactly psychopathic snake operates. Sure. like sort purely political thinking fucked Cuomo anything. /s risk covid

Can stop blatant misinformation?   someone ELI5 works kill covid-19? get third shot nowhere? 95% confidence interval range values 95% confident contains true mean population.

In words, 66% almost certainly exact right number limitations sample size factors. However, 95% sure actual number 26% 84%. There's still 5% chance actual number outside range. way Nightmare vaccination escape. Since vaccine still effective severe disease I'd categorize ""nightmare"". Bad, get vaccinated probably fine. USA needs introduce vaccine passport national vaccine mandate Wait inevitable hurricane season. People congregating shelters, usually schools, include medically transported special needs / elderly individuals which, way, Fire / EMS resources breaking point. Buckle up. Good. Raising insurance rates unvaccinated completely logical excellent way encourage people stop stupid vaccine. **open up** **heavy restrictions**

Pick one. two mutually exclusive. can't ""open up"" still heavy restrictions. Vaccine hesitancy != COVID denial. Questioning necessity mandates mean I'm eager go get sick get everyone around sick. double vaccinated people still get sick spread virus, think fair unvaccinated people treated like 3rd class citizens? study found Moderna better efficacy vs Dekta. 

""contacts highest risk COVID-19 exposed **2 days 3 days index patient‚Äôs symptom onset, peaking day 0** (adjusted relative risk [ARR], 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.5). Compared exposed asymptomatic index patient, risk COVID-19 among contacts higher exposed index patients mild (ARR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.8-9.1) moderate (ARR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.9-9.7) cases COVID-19. index case severity increased, infected contacts less likely asymptomatic (exposed patient mild COVID-19: ARR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9; exposed patient moderate COVID-19: ARR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.8).""

This pretty interesting paper, seen least two studies said contagiousness increase worse symptoms (note, includes pre-symptomatic phase well), first paper correlated severity index case severity people infect.  visited KY January 2020 got sick dog. Worst flu ever  (Bless heart!) millennial apartment neighbors (young couple, vaxxed) came covid. hope well, sure covid would get young healthy. quarantining missing work.

Getting shots easy now. people learn hard way. I've heard south general. Usually passive aggressive old southern woman. make sign waiver ""I wont come hospital ask ventilator even dying applies every member immediate family"" Sometimes, think people forget far less children adults, small amounts children going hospital way alarming percentage wise. case ask Lord bless *brain*.

They brain blessed, right.

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶right? Anyone get third moderna?? second March 4th, I'm scheduled working school Sept 7th (for week). concerned building, wondering go get booster Sept 4th.. 4chan, referencing ""summer"" shorthand attributing especially shitty posts kids school summer.   even 2900 times, wont convince anti vax idiots civilian workforce. active duty low serious cases 2nd shot us J&amp;J folks. Yes, perhaps even importantly, gives *the wrong people* voice.

I recall reading study (sadly, source this; maybe someone else find it) saying majority posts Americans twitter come 2% population. pretty clear healthiest 2% either. Quite opposite. fact, sometimes seems like mental illnesses people list profiles, influence site's conversations (but maybe that's perception).

Social media gives megaphone people deeply alienated suffer severe cognitive distortions. allows confirm other's bizarre beliefs world share beliefs (along pathological thought processes produced them) everyone around them; last year so, we've seen leads. often wonder whether might possible social media made mental illnesses contagious.

Not sure fix this, short banning social media; cat's bag now.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs theory that, April, gets warm ‚Äî historically, able kill virus. don‚Äôt know yet; we‚Äôre sure yet. that‚Äôs around corner.‚Äù ‚Äî Feb 14 2020. President Nutter Butter speaking National Border Patrol Council members.

Also, it‚Äôs ignoring last portion article states:

He sees COVID-19 way people never will. says he‚Äôs buried multiple family members family two weeks time. 
 
The days difficult, admitted, pointing recent Friday example buried two friends day. 
 
‚ÄúIt devastating, last Friday difficult day. devastating, still serve families. really difficult, really difficult,‚Äù sounds absolutely brutal. approach taking lot research yet done effects body systems. I‚Äôve heard antivirals usually give small benefit extremely hard create. promising treatments horizon you‚Äôre monitoring? Oh wow....   Yes college campuses known large number children running around. Even still wear seatbelt, die car accident, check stats. government force wear though :-O. goes driver license! Even one, plenty car accident, forcing us get one? 

Spoiler alert, theses still reduce quite bit risk! 

The irony wearing seatbelt, affect all, vaccinated, affect me. How? part closer driver license requirement. drive road someone license, hell already often kids get learning permit, still know drive, still do. fine them, causing much issues, know drive, handle mistake. say 20% people road driving license, easier drive many cars erratic? much... even license know drive, one point much chance accident thus higher.

So that's issue. got big proportion knows fight virus. That's good, protection perfect. Add many people know fight it, thus likely get spread it, protection thus likely enough deal Also spoiler alert: going away soon.

Seems like answered answer. That's angry. going away soon let spread. let spread letting anti-vax spread it.  understanding primed vaccination infection, body knows virus appears depends antibodies circulate blood. time levels drop immune memory system help production new antibodies. virus grabs control cell, happen even vaccine, relies turning cell virus factory. enough antibodies, virus cannot infect you.

My point would lag initial infection body shutting down. I'm curious length time would clear infections vaccinated people progress Covid. Somewhere this, likely *safe harbor* provision, unable vaccinated. abused. core problem needs addressed, fear vaccine.

The people wanting mask entirely different issue. Oh, they'll cover you. They'll charge lot more. smoking. basic shit. Delta significantly contagious OG delta.

Masks help reduce viral spread capturing droplets (all masks), also preventing droplets permeating mask (N95/etc)

Do understand masking works? understand likely get sick around lot people opposed few?

What data would convince attending outdoor concert thousands people crammed small space probably place wear mask? sure explain heavily vaxxed places like UK Israel spike then. type comment Reddit gold, prepare 50+ upvotes.  Lol Good, can't wait Ontario same! I, too, Florida...   Funding schools liberal myth something learned amazon. good job, enohgh get fired. do, going get avalanche work.

""no lock down"" campaigns astoturfing funded single SPAC, domain names web sites across dozens states purchased organization. concerted effort corporate GOP leadership push people back work ASAP, required getting kids back school. Appreciate advice, hopefully goes away soon. sure! Levittown cool man. Lots interesting additions. understand risk reduction adequately: 95% people 3rd dose get sick 97% get serious symptoms *overall*, 95% get sick 5%, 97% get serious symptoms?

Because 3% 5% that's amazing.  I‚Äôve seen lot comments saying big wave we‚Äôre seeing cause Delta burn early thus holiday travel gatherings US safe cause surge cases. Many point India UK justify line thinking. We‚Äôre really running time get vaccination rates safe enough level holiday travel mRNA take 2 doses 3-4 weeks reach best protection levels. brother kid live there.  talked Tuesday evening. 

He screenshotted local social media posts even children dying.....it's still government hoax perpetuated ""Great Reset"" cabals. restaurants bars forever?  Misinformation information follow people considered good information? Nobody suggested complex conspiracy. really disappointing degree J&amp;J recipients treated like afterthoughts. mean I'm future looking back two weeks ago. Either way know happening right now, processed now. state puts 100 deaths today, people die today, died two weeks ago processed. treat DeSantis like Mussolini -  far worried transmitting others contracting myself

Are actually worried transmitting antivaxer? point, get hospitalized covid, them. 

I worry transmitting someone can't get vaccinated legitimate medical reason medical condition makes vaccines ineffective, although lot people probably careful lives lots things unrelated covid. Pedialyte Gatorade allergic anything look acetaminophen, brand name Tylenol, find better fever reducer ibuprofen imo hate masks. reason can't both. would disagree CDC knows. originally used carrot get people vaccinated, situation changed, policy changed. way science supposed work. alpha variant low vaccinated individuals, delta much higher. gentle encouragement period Vax over. businesses, organizations, governments locking unvaccinated status changes. dont travel then, it‚Äôs hard af get kind wage todays day age.  Think need move away counting cases honestly.   **This AMA begin 11am EST. Please refrain answering questions guest. Thank you.** guys got fancy pen?!? got pizza.. daft? 

Delta's significantly communicable original covid. Masks reduce viral spread. basic, basic shit. 

If walking path constantly people? need mask. going crowded music concert outdoors? Probably wear one. 

Seems pretty simple me. Sharing hypothetical percentages change anyone's minds point. stopped mandating masks contact tracing Wilson County (county beside Nashville yesterday)

How ridiculous!!!  Oh yeah, remember witnessed children suffering due school shootings something gun violence problem then. /s  We‚Äôve dropped restrictions northeast I‚Äôm seeing next masks. hospitals fine. 

It‚Äôs almost like vaccines important anything else.  guess - always known likely suboptimal. window selected get trials done quickly possible still reasonably allowing separate immune response first dose. Waiting 8-12 weeks doses would meant vaccines would reached market 4-8 weeks later before.  Lol. I'm original commenter, personally can't move live I'm divorced joint (but majority) custody son. want move state, would go arbitration get ex agree let move child. ain't happening, can't move he's college.

That's need (again) hospitals near capacity several states (FL, KY, MS, TX). People dying COVID issues enough equipment staff take care could get zero cases, would still back started 2-3 months. borders aren‚Äôt sealed.

It would provide time get people vaccinated. borders sealed, least limited, one wanted make hard choice population isn‚Äôt going accept 6 weeks house arrest.

So say ""fuck it"" deal COVID another 2, 3, 5 years more. We're probably going top 1 million deaths year. one denying care, free vaccine made available everyone.

IMO denying vaccine different denying cure get sick. people denying care themselves, let's respect choice wanting sick cared for.

That‚Äôs separate issue fact we‚Äôre still midst pandemic, millions people (including children) getting sick, even mild/moderate illness preventable vaccination ~45 million kids 12 haven‚Äôt opportunity take. 

Never mind fact hospitals (including children‚Äôs hospitals) legit overwhelmed many states, vast majority unvaccinated people (including kids). Forget Jake, China.

From first hand experience China operates, never answers narrative CCP wants hear. 

We know China transparent information, never really know sure never able prove anything. 

There billion layers bureaucracy deceit crafted serve thier ultimate goal losing face.   Swear read ""other word"" . Literally throwing feces? Ya gotta link, right?  Yeah, hear ya. fairly large face get good seal - just- aura. wish came large size 5-10%!larger. much 25% breakthrough infection rate parts US.

What exactly ""breakthrough infection rate?"" Never heard term trying figure numerator denominator here.

I'm guessing breakthrough cases divided total cases. like, 25% sounds real scary all, 95% efficacy vaccine, would what...83.3% vaccinated people expect breakthrough infection rate. Lower 90% efficacy we're talking 71% vaccinated spit 25% breakthrough infection rate.

I guess point number really carry much weight since exact numbers would expected November (when efficacy rates announced) started hitting high vaccination rates.  understand bans vaccine mandates. Vaccine mandates around decades. Especially travel, military, schools. thought decided long time ago deadly diseases bad thing prevent speading. Abbott wish still polio spreading around? sure acts like he's side viruses, humans. not, best do. They'd fucked 10% everyone know died. can't places instituted mask mandates need close loophole allows removal mask eating drinking. mask required, consumption food beverages prohibited. looks like Georgia may bit ahead state, unfortunately. state roughly half population received one shot, although may counting children able vaccinated. specific county live 30% entire population fully vaccinated 40% adults 18+. I'm hoping people finally come senses number significantly rise coming weeks months instead perpetually mobbing local Tractor Supply.

There bit hope though. family die hard alt-right, much basically Fox News apparently swung liberal joined rest MSM. Yet decent number planning getting least J&amp;J shot. come local doctors advising that, despite media outlets say, vaccine safe greatly assist fighting bad case Covid. Apparently, lot alt-right media politicians discouraging vaccine ""it's perfect still die Covid, bother vaccine work"". doctors explain finally getting lot like flu shot greatly helps person get awful case end hospital it'll require yearly/semi-annual shots like flu.  Sad we‚Äôre talking schools tests we‚Äôre worrying nothing academia. 3 people. bad.

Also doesn‚Äôt. De-platforming works conspiracy theories. work like virus rely constantly feeding fears buying them. limit people‚Äôs access junk science conspiracy theories linked direct harm limit continued buy-in. What‚Äôs point then? Vaccinated people still spread stop trying mitigated give up? mean seriously point comment like that? everything try pointless?

Not sure I‚Äôm replying. comments posts make sound like total asshole. you‚Äôre blaming sci fi television show likes facebook megachurches? think hate misplaced.

Russia doesn‚Äôt care truth, care causing enough infighting instability US collapse within. Seems working pretty well.  Get vaccinated, wear mask deliver eulogy instead roast groom. Fair point! I'm going take endless vaccine doses. vaccinations stop third dose. Remember taking fifth dose practicing social distancing mask on. I've noticed people physically work pandemic also groups people lowest vaccination rates. Police, Fire, nurses, health care workers, nursing home workers, service workers, etc. lower vaccination rate. 


There something said that. heavily exposed well year vaccine came out. constantly exposed something, eventually become used risk risk longer becomes perceived risk every day reality. mental block make justifications want think end day, perceived lack risk due constant exposure.


As people locked homes year, perceived risk huge justified. seen people year feel go outside world unvaccinated, get sick. see vaccine way re-enter world. apposed front line workers, outside world since day 1 without vaccine. vaccine change every day life. protects virus change day day. 


With said, I'm trying dig psych people. think everyone vaccinated. past year rough people's mental well-being. 


I also think lot resentment front line workers. physically went work people could work home, worked home people work got unemployment stimulus money. much offered front line workers terms hazard pay bonuses.  mean FT travel nurse make 6-10x old wage. Considering they're population cannot get vaccine, really surprising? Maybe, always possibility. There's talk maybe needing yearly every-6-months booster since first shots went arms. that's get sick stay alive better treatments available thing mutates pussycat that's I'll doing. 

But ""enough"" really dependent population pulling heads asses getting first two, that's something scientists vaccine makers health departments control. yeah, makes sense continue giving shots help individual whole work together knock thing out. may well mean yearly.  better government analyzes data worse way literally anywhere else.

No one right mind would produce numbers way unless something shady. Particularly situation requires day-to-day decision making. need process numbers immediately take appropriate action, report stakeholders, later analyze processed data errors, use mean error rate normalize new data going forward. forcing vaccines kids overall risk children becoming severely ill dying Covid extremely low? please answer protect long-covid etc. know vaccines protect severe illness death still get asymptomatic mild COVID risk developing post-Covid health problems breakthrough infection isn‚Äôt known.

Give jab jab jab patients excuse, ill.

COVID pandemic running rampant American society today; mental illness drug abuse *insane* levels.

These people ill too. like negative slopes first derivative cases per day. appears rare immune system blunts ability virus really set usual infection. -AAA BREAKING NEWS: He's appointed Gov. Ron DeSantis' new Covid Czar. 

/s Two office co-workers positive test results. One exposed via wife teacher. Another exposed high school son testing positive.  two workers returned Delta, look sound well all. Lots coughing trouble talking. 

We already smaller crew office, fairly bare bones.  beginning pandemic seem virus affected people 40 severely. new variants may continue hold true don‚Äôt share optimism. Sandy Hook clearly demonstrated that, policy level, value lives children. situation different. vaccines affect natural immunity all?

&amp;#x200B;

They augment synergize make robust, predictable, stronger especially variants like beta. -AAA protection long covid, especially debilitating? Antiva strikes again! lolled, sorry downvoted. pushed hard

like military never pushes soldiers things.

their excuses meaningless.   know, right? want know many people serious complications vaccine. answer question.

J&amp;J blood clots: 28 cases May, 3 deaths. (And must point 3 deaths happened appropriate treatment issue widely known emergency doctors.)

Pfizer/Moderna myocarditis: 226 cases June, zero deaths.

Anaphylaxis: 2 5 cases per million doses administered, zero deaths.

That's it. serious reactions. People certainly gotten sick even died getting vaccine, people get sick die time, we've vaccinated many millions people. Nothing's covered up. great filter Amazing, important European visitors site. looking solution three years European visitors important site currently unavailable visitors European Economic Area work ensure data protected accordance applicable EU laws. Well people scientists, obviously difficult tell someone making bogus claim vaccine. That's important take posts containing misinformation. 

Misinformation: false inaccurate information, especially deliberately intended deceive.

Tucker Carlson talking vaccines pretty much exclusively misinformation. saw standard Fox News discussing vaccines similar CNN discusses them, Tucker guests whole different story Likely EUA late fall. bit vaccine helps delta likely peaked places US. -AAA It‚Äôs they‚Äôre far apart 

Got second jab yesterday, 8 weeks first, reason assaulting child says even Like what? thing I'm seeing normalization remote work certain jobs It‚Äôs less that, doesn‚Äôt make ok. Deaths young children rare general. Even relatively small number acceptable given ways prevent it.  Heck even fine. disaster. people dying also mostly made choice technically dewormer well. point everyone really infections aus/nz Taiwan. incompetent president people understand science. biological possibilities necessarily likely occur. virus wants spread it‚Äôs efficiently now. Making people sick means won‚Äôt able go infect others. multiple programs place look viruses detect changes need need look coronaviruses -AAA Kids can‚Äôt it‚Äôs adults protect them. kids wearing masks, better ventilation good hygiene. instead home schooling try pod schooling fewer kids. Covid comparatively negligible much hurts children. 20 months outbreak killed 360 kids. Drowning 5x common. Around 20k kids die usa kinda weird 5k pediatric icu beds usa though. sounds like inappropriate sinus tachycardia. got six years ago pneumonia it‚Äôs never gone away. It‚Äôs form dysautonomia, would encourage look it. took forever get diagnosis lots doctors don‚Äôt know much want write anxiety. It‚Äôs seemingly becoming common COVID though, I‚Äôm hopeful people doctors become aware it. Take care.  I‚Äôm guessing not, article made mention all. lots phases burn out, often people feel extremely trapped can't leave need income.  first batch go ones simply break. 


The thing is, people start it, others burned realize viable, others surviving able continue lives rest awhile.  end world, it, possible... They'd eat poison rather get vaccine?

WHY??? Good old San Angelo. smell comment section here.

Ok, peeked, made chuckle: ""it's old ""Meal Team Six"" every militia. Though maybe change ""Delta(variant) Force.""  dying? likely we'll nasal spray vaccine next two years? Cases always occur. Breakthroughs always occur 100% coverage would almost entirely decoupled cases hospitalizations. virus cannot eliminated eradicated. - AAA joke another way people look it. direct comment based said.

From I've heard, expect experience pleasantly surprised goes better. I'm planning take day off. variant become strain? indication could/will happen COVID-19? happen, would ramifications? also drop iq points.    sure that‚Äôs true  It‚Äôs unclear-- fully supportive booster doses 6/8 months healthy individuals haven‚Äôt seen erosion protection matters -- serious disease. -AAA permanent conditions like blood clots, heart troubles, reduced life expectancy on? infections adults based what?

Ironically enough real answer would 100 children can't get vaccinated, everyone else be. Given reluctance many social media sites deplatform misinformation, way users help combat it? need attend liberal arts college critical thinker? awful that? would anyone suffer poverty wage ESPECIALLY pandemic? national average $20 LEAST!  full FDA approval vaccine soooooo important ""I going get it, but..."" idiots. It‚Äôs soon. Deaths always lag least 2-3 weeks. it‚Äôs likely longer time younger may leave vent/ecmo longer elderly patient.  let people make decisions run lives.

The problem way republicans govern via freedom personal responsibility never beat pandemic. Reason vaccination status health affects everyone around YOU. freedom ability whatever want great all, time WE, country, must move together single direction, make sacrifices, beat common enemy. grasp this. badge eHarmony able find, mentioned paragraph. ""Fully vaxxed Covid hope too."" resources written lay person vaccine alleviate hesitancy? demystify science? Co worker open still afraid.   don‚Äôt think truly sterilizing vaccines really exist. goal minimize morbidity mortality prevent every infection -AAA Ah okay, honestly heard reason. Cheers. way. America care children unless used prop advance political agenda. Remember Sandy Hook?  think see vaccine shot/boost delta variant released? vaxed friends FL still got quite sick üòû   bad can't choose dies Covid.  L *o* L ~Governor Tennessee hold bit? Trump save everybody. ask vaccinated? information long covid within breakthrough cases? explain jab side effects please?

The Pfizer vaccine mRNA vaccine genetic instructions spike protein SARS-CoV2 enclosed lipid nanoparticle. mRNA, lipids, preservatives/stabilizers. common side effects muscle aches, fever, headache feeling tired day so. It‚Äôs common dose 2. side effects worked ICU night shift next day. -AAA  fat burden company insurance companies. treat obese people, drunk drivers smokers? fault problem cannot vaccinated all. can‚Äôt get first shot, let alone third. still sympathy them, unlike anti-vaxxer idiots. be. nurse UK good god spotted supermarket uniform would serious trouble That's alot.......of money....but necessary coverage   could checknout today thats ok  Tennessee 5150 new cases yesterday. 1847 kids 36%. 5 days ago 61 hospitalized, 16 ICU 6 vents. 6 days ago number cases 1/2 seeing new cases. # kids 0-20 infected 1.5 x 20-30 year olds. 20 group isn‚Äôt defined unable get vaccine can‚Äôt give definite numbers. &lt;20 group higher groups awhile. kid 6 old enough vaccinated. Live Toronto fairly good vaccination rates high would like. Numbers going up. think class important mental health. point numbers / risk high enough pull person class? risky believe delta kids (as evidence seems mixed)? less concerned mortality rates kids long covid chronic issues.    little girl probably opponent actually take hahah individual pay tests. Anti-vax need pull kids NOW. expected get vax fully approved children. extremely curious would affect interstate corporation policy. I've seen movie thousand times caught AMC last night. One absolute favorites, masterpiece.

""Anyway, delivered bomb.""  One person segment mentioned asking soldier vaccine yet, soldier's response basically, Army require rare chance say Army recommended get it. They're already approved US immunocompromised folks, people getting pretending first shot state bad, local community social circle doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs even stranger.

If anyone go hospital, we‚Äôre trouble, that, nothing. think he's popular, hell he's fighting favorable Trumpian candidiates. he's still Democrat.   modest 40% fail plan you‚Äôve planed fail. 

How‚Äôs lack planning working far? Tell successes we‚Äôve respect pandemic happened due pure luck planning?  Happens!!

I guess foreign papers slow comes sharing capitalism? cures ailments much research done impact long Covid kids? know adults still breathing issues year on. Hopefully impacts less there‚Äôs going lot people side effects adult lives. misinformation part completely accurate. real videos also taken down. whatever disagree with. mean google, facebook, twitter.. enlightened truth-bearers. know anti-vax propaganda bad, people pro deplatforming banning whoever disagree can't see bigger picture life them..  ill take ""things already knew"" $200, alex! Alright, believe there's vast global conspiracy poison you, because...?  going get shots arms 6,000,000,000ish people planet? Ah ok bad. Well thats good least - followed CDC guidelines (assuming fever)  That's good point, one probably factored decision go 6 months instead 8 impressive streak nonetheless.  Among others, Pfizer CEO commented April boosters likely needed effectiveness wanes 6-12 months.

This article spike? Kerala records 31,445 fresh Covid infections, highest since May 20 


Al Jazeera slow [Hospitalization isn‚Äôt metric ""We 14,000 pediatric cases last seven days, 57% increase week prior,"" Piercey told reporters. ""Right now, 36% cases state among children historically 10 15% According researchers Johns Hopkins, Tennessee ranks sixth country new cases per capita. rolling average number daily new cases increased 2,200, increase 75%, past two Piercey said biggest increase among school-age children many kicking new school year. Provide source mRNA vaccines advertised sterilizing beginning. Provide source long COVID Delta variant worse vaccinated (I know can‚Äôt hasn‚Äôt enough time really study this).

Provide source anybody ever believe you? anything last two years tell opposite. can't even get people stay home pandemic even less chance getting move yurt woods AC. That's kind thing creates anti-maskers.

I think anti-maskers start way, part. affecting ego weird way. think what's missing assessment (which around human history) fast far viral host travel.

We know diseases ravaged Europe middle/dark ages people build immunity diseases (or quarantined sick let die) eventually. Europeans landed North America, indigenous people staggering numbers death wave wave disease swept even laid eyes European person.

Imagine something like delta variant eventually developing kill 50% infects incubation period rate infection. imagine varient flown yo every continent begin notice try contact trace.

Suddenly, span 3 weeks, could societal collapse grand scale dangers come that.

If keeps rolling forever, chances incredibly small really matter. eventually succeed. reported 10 videos covid misinformation single one removed. first report function report reason covid-misinformation went closest fit ""Spam misleading Misleading text"". report providd timestamps direct quotes COVID-19 medical misinformation policy, yet nothing ever removed.

the latest example channel e.g. video found wanted help get digital covid app running properly. videos breaks dozens misinformation policy, e.g. saying flu worse, vaccinated people infect unvaccinated, vaccine really protect, supresses immune system, unhealthy full chemicals, etc. Yet actions taken. immune systems weird, virus weird. might need three doses years, maybe forever - two, maybe boosters foreseeable future.

It's annoying, there's magic solution, solution requires effort sacrifice - luckily biggest sacrifice might need make get jab arm twice year little person responded gotta say, like people like you.

Making analogies made easy comprehend. Huh, TIL Hmm....wonder we'll data that. Or, know, 20 keep getting ""10 percent died"" number? mentioned several threads. That's even close accurate.   Politics people‚Ä¶ One 2.5 weeks. ten days. Hello thank this. husband attended small celebration 10 people. vaccinated. couple stopped unvaccinated. half group COVID. get unvaccinated couple?

Anyone part household multiple children knows colds flus almost always brought home school children first passed around family interact them.  
 
I think pretty obvious early pandemic kids low risk severe complications Covid, people *so* selfish *so* uninterested protecting communities slightly effective way reaching pointing low risk kids' health still risk. 
 
If people even ounce concern communities impact society, would effective point kids' risk others viral transmission vector. think academically stronger argument get people change behavior, practically worth effort due ubiquitous narcissism.   ‚ÄúOk policy covers 20 bucks‚Äù Yes, agree continue thinning herd.  people worried kids Afghanistan, meanwhile, give shit well-being kids. can't make up. went sub shall named started asking peopel questions. really boils believe IMO. people believe FDA, CDC, WHO, Fauci, general medical community, etc..... toss every single thing sources tell left minor disease really affect anyone people blowing proportion. would rather listen someone's mom FB person credible doctor. get it. guess want know many vaccinated kids sick. Sounds like recipe uncontrolled spread me.  sure that, Biden touting ""over 4th July"" pretty hard. lead masks going bye-bye.

Seriously though, shifting goalposts driving crazy too. covidestim estimates case dates based information has, test results delayed would result delay numbers produced county.

also, part estimate take positives positive percentage total tests part calculation, 20,000 19% positive may make big difference 21,000 22% whatever Vaccination plus natural infection hope believe. wonder many children injured die Covid politicians parents stop idiots. aka Super Big Guy Maybe Olympics bad idea. waiting pickup food order lady ill fitting mask got close me. Hee nose hanging like carrot. backed said got vaccinated. said yeah that's good, even vaccinated people need wear Thier masks properly maintain distance indoors. looked like crack official:

Illinois governor mandates COVID vaccines teachers, college students, health 
 care workers, imposes indoor mask mandate all. entire scene drinking, singing, scar bragging culminating speech perfection. swing mood makes part hit like hammer. (not terrifying is.) Yes, I've read vaccine doest work nearly well immunocompromised people. mention exact Wuhan virology lab receiving US govt funding. They'll tell us truth tell us truth killed Kennedy actually planned 9/11... allowed speak child district. Full stop.  NUTS parents pretending precious little angels somehow suffering put piece cloth face day. two kiddos kindergarten rest classmates almost universally keep masks throughout school day freakouts they're happy be. Hell, kids wear masks time leave 8 get picked daycare around 4:30 PM, appear worse wear. fact, make point mentioning one kiddo they've seen sometimes wear mask concern. course, next wave growing. But, vaccinations translates slower spread, importantly reduction cases requiring hospitalization. Go get vaxxed. Minimize close proximity others much possible, must close others wear mask. best can. smart. defensive. Act prudently, hope healthcare facilities buckle many severe cases.   Yes I've asked question number times found answer yet

I spend decent amount time every day going data/articles/etc. seen anything else suggests 

So I'm wondering missed something, CDC basing non-public data, attempt get unvaxxed people caution around exposures Shocking, gets violent women confront him.  leaving parents, makes school board feel like they've placed responsibility individual families, actuality they've said, ""We care anyone pro-infection."" Comirnaty available U.S. bait switch? I‚Äôm arguing things won‚Äôt happen ‚Äúsafer‚Äù year. state mandated can‚Äôt remote learning, best do.

Kids used masks now, they‚Äôre parents aren‚Äôt whining modeling bad behavior, kids mostly go flow. where? CDC recommend masks outdoor setting densely packed crowded. like outdoor concert sporting event lot people. I'm thinking maybe Duke worried upcoming football games? end sight. 
I think may start see countries / states / cities / towns high vaccination rates emerge mostly unscathed future waves. 
Otherwise, guarantee abysmal vaccination rates guarantee new variants future waves. 
The biggest concern highly transmissible variant emerge fully escapes vaccines. 
The scientific community increasingly seeing real possibility statistically biologically. Vaccines still work, please wear masks. Quick blip Mayo Clinic regarding breakthrough cases. common across united states freeze hiring nurses health care workers keep care costa profits higher. frequently leads worked staff employee burn out. tons people qualified rns cant find work hiring freezes. Vet techs wear scrubs. Sure lot preventable people would wear fucking mask.

We know long term effects kids be, know people suffer months ""long covid""  months 2-shot vaccinated, still waiting turned *5G zombie-mutant.*

Maybe *sMaRtEr* randomly snort crushed mixture hydroxychloroquine, invertimicin, *megadose* vitamin-D followed drinking glass chlorine dioxide (Don't this). DoCtOrS, kNoW 5 years medical school followed 5 years active training. /s  Apes strong together. Exactly what‚Äôs happening ecmo machines.  aren‚Äôt enough, Covid death rate goes up. believe something doesn‚Äôt make true!! Yes totally, agreement you. need see data, although frequency severe symptoms, death, etc. might amongst variants, increases infections obviously yield severely sick kids. going kids killing dying covid they're isolated fed steady diet fear. can‚Äôt boot covid patient hospital take cancer one in.

This false statement. Maybe illegal so. easily possible.

You're falling is-ought fallacy. guy saying ought done. responded things currently done.

There laws physics preventing unvaccinated COVID patients kicked hospital. Florida worse ever despite average vaccination rate US fudging numbers. concerning country whole, not? Cool. kid gonna catch drowning school.   Yes! frustrated beginning pandemic exempted kids like, 6? (maybe even older, can't remember now) wearing masks thinking unnecessarily high age. can‚Äôt change position single topic else they‚Äôll seen ‚Äúsomeone got them‚Äù wrong, impossible. disappoint base enough lose next election can‚Äôt make side money position. 

Bush made promise increase taxes staked reelection it. raised taxes lost election. That's happens half country decides put faith idiots think bill gates trying track rather medical experts. Honestly point majority covid deaths self inflicted, sympathy longer there. dug hole. They're backdating deaths actual date death time reported probably couple weeks ago. pick date worldometers check week two see it'll go dramatically. They're averaging 200 deaths day right now. kids movie ""Idiocrazy"" became documentary."" Yes, important distinction. Thank you! impression vaccine help minimize side effects if/when get covid. masks used help prevent spread.

Am wrong? Lollapalooza one weekend.... college 7 days week! discussion vaccine efficacy, vaccine efficacy causing problems overwhelmed hospitals, point, true, also entirely non sequitur. Yep. saw theater kid. scene always stuck  always time worry. People think restrictions destroys economy. virus Fucking killing people that. makes people afraid take risks, spend money, leave homes. Even restrictions, economy would still ruins. care. keep mind university closed ecosystem lot contact &amp; interactions ""public"" space. kids spend lot time interacting (inside &amp; outside) ever colleagues. face face often physical, expected teens young 20-somethings. county county basis? likely communities peaked still rising.

I'm also quite sure backdating infections/dumping cases FL. hospital stays Covid cost Delta $50,000 per employee, **every one workers fully vaccinated**, Delta‚Äôs C.E.O., Ed Bastian, said memo staff.  203 *confirmed* cases group people vaccinated least tested positive going, wanted unvaccinated wear masks, lots people wore masks half daily cases today. Stugis seem huge impact cases local area. Perhaps problem anti-vaxxers going indoor dining, etc around event though rather event itself. 

Either way, think fair places taking precautions definitive studies outdoor transmission Delta specifically, especially time hospitals struggling non-emergency medical procedures delayed. got second done 4/20/21 third dose 8/18/21 - 4 months. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Fucking plague rat keep mind college kids ""alone"" outdoors, they're big friends groups mingling, face face hours end. They're like one big extended family. working adult never close proximity colleagues like length time. thing is, estimates mean (in case, effectiveness) flat distribution. 66% likely number given data study, numbers around likely numbers out. Yes, they‚Äôre broad confidence intervals reflect lot uncertainty considered, makes seem like it‚Äôs likely 26% 66%. true. still many unvaccinated people, we've dropped many precautions. People tired pandemic trying wish away. Unfortunately, results virus spread. look number vaccinated vs unvaccinated getting sick, still way way way unvaccinated, anyone claiming vaccine work purposefully disingenuous. None I've worked True, comment may apply cases. could see politicians would different. research apply generalized sample size. Vaccinated students get infected too. younger sister double vaxxed, I'd still want get tested. People buy bullshit like essential oils, surprise. guess still fuzziness around actual mandate. question raised authority actually make mandate not. state emergency lifted governor powers emergency. mandate certainly helps state level. *Ron Howard narrator voice* US *didn't* change ways.... That's dumbest shit I've ever heard, I've reddit awhile. Get better info. Bingo bingo. Couldn‚Äôt said better myself. find wearing mask often places besides work, means aren‚Äôt home enough you‚Äôre abusing mask meant for. That's like 1 400 people US *dead* COVID. sick, *dead*. heard CDC may let people take booster soon time frame 6 months, 6 months last vaccine take? Yeah may misunderstood numbers maybe 500,000 years ago number something human like yet anatomically modern humans whatever.  Maybe drew line different point 300,000 number distinguish homo sapiens sapiens homo sapiens earlier homo. bunch homos way back us areas low vaccination uptake, we'll take help get.

Something simple, optional, less personal info driver's license.  Yes. Vaccinated people less likely transmit per Scott Gottlieb.  hospitals overloaded can't get oxygen ICU treatment. kind things say liberals either. Oh yes, keep long (she let us anyway). read something earlier pandemic little lungs able take enough air mask. put short time practice. 

To protect her, take inside places. stick outdoor events (early morning playground trips, small pool parties close friends) inside events grandparents (who fully vaccinated Moderna). can't wait day finally take inside grocery store. small thing, crazy 1.5 never inside grocery store before.  Lol calm storm. long ago Texas tried mandate HPV vaccine, can‚Äôt one remembers this. Meh, one almost 4 YO one 2 YO. wear masks school complain it, I'm sure much worth. go classroom end day, masks half faces best. sense wearing mask like much good. would say must satire, are....

What you, new? sad fact Delta contagious infectious. That's reason NZ Australia locking HARD despite handful cases. Vaccines alone stop spread 90%+ residents get shot (including kids 12). 

So really comes personal mitigation measures region. FL much South there's desire part populace distance mask refrain crowds/indoor activities. California majority public partaking large-group activities absolutely necessary. They're forgoing outings beach piers, movie theaters, theme parks, concerts, shows even though venues re-opened. Self-restraint way mitigate Delta tsunami boosters rolled out. doesnt go away intranasal vaccine out. Yep downvoted couple days ago suggesting PICUs would overwhelmed states low vaccination rates, schools hold classes outdoors weather permits. total 5,908 PICU beds US 2016. Unfortunately, like COVID surges, evenly distributed throughout country. Thought still talking *outbreak.*

A shark popping would surprise. would double check mask requirementsfor 1.5 year old. awhile CDC really discouraging masks people 2, possibly might choking hazard. Although totally understand would want put infant sterile bubble right now. happening? children relatively less prone getting it? agree children must get it, 36%? 

My intuition is: 100% adults vaccinated, cases probably kids absolute number low. 

But Tennessee relatively low vax penetration, half adult population unvaxxed. overwhelming majority (far higher 64%) cases unvaxxed adults? question come unvaxxed adults account 64% cases many them.  theyre terrified needles thought getting recurring 6 month boosters well 2023 version hell?  go get third shot now? get 3rd shot? ""water users"" lol that's single dumbest headline I've seen least hour.   think estimate low. count 97 days Dec. 1. around thousand deaths day. think number could twice that.  sound like remotely competent doctor know know fair number personally.

If anything see opposite, question ask super well versed they'll reply that's specialty.

And medical journals/UpToDate basically required reading specifically stay top progress field know memorized med school likely current best evidence based medicine.

Not say doctors like describe frankly shit doctors. clots considered extremely rare - 417 reported cases 72 deaths - 24.8 million first doses 23.9 million second doses AstraZeneca vaccine UK. 
 


Unfortunate. hate Covid-19. Many people live long strong Stage IV cancer days, hope spouse one them. think begging wear seatbelt That's absolutely preposterous know it. Regions homogenous, representative ideology. places. people end living somewhere circumstance, align politically presumed inherent collection traits. resources freedom make choice live reasons, hope wise enough understand that's privilege. Yea, mean keeps going rate, areas endemic Covid primarily areas lower vaccination rates (regardless state) areas mostly vaccinated experience less medical burden. Similar find measles smallpox primarily communities extremely vaccine hesitant. promise want see current infections deaths would look like right without 50% US vaxxed. would absolute massacre. I‚Äôm saying group doesn‚Äôt exist. group talking exists well, many aren‚Äôt paying attention constantly changing guidance. lot people burnt decided they‚Äôre vaccinated move on. ‚ÄúLoser, loser, chicken honorable discharge‚Äù  people care science. actual saying US. Usually southern states believe, though I've heard older family members I'm west coast. waiting virus run immunologically naive bodies, happening quickly given contagious Delta is. We'll know we're seeing increases case counts lead increases hospitalization death (like UK right now).

There's good news mandates, wave abate due time. That's fucking stupid Donald Trump got vaccine  don‚Äôt want suggest shouldn‚Äôt avoid it, indications something actually happens? many kids ill (but severely) lasting issues year later? able tell certainty.
The biggest study saw Swiss one seemed like good news.

Also, people tend worry long term symptoms Covid right lots RSV going around (a *lot* kids get hospitalized RS Covid right least UK) RS pretty nasty. definitely long term symptoms, flu. tend ignore reason. honestly good thing considering bad virus older age groups. fact matter little number cases, total always add 100%, higher age group least affected virus, better. Same. family lives Europe, second year row get see them.

Thankfully, zoom exists. could imagine would like even 20 years ago. Right said mexicans afraid 5g signals vaccine produces? bet many texan would start getting them. like makes tracking guns impossible. talking undergrad level. remotely respectable undergrad science math program based around regurgitating memorized facts. Hell lots math courses may never see single numeral semester. Proofs theorems teach logic critical thinking.

Now granted bio require lot memorization think science major still get enough exposure sciences/math get pretty good baseline. *just* denying science; *also* denying reality. think lazy thing. takes work change. changing scrubs, get spread COVID everywhere go since real anyway (their behavior indicates). see treatment preventative.

There already nasal spray options used ""not safe"" environments. example, povidone iodine(1%) w/saline spray shown useful tool combat Covid infection. cheap easily made home. Moving Cali sound good lots reasons. Even weather! know deciding right decision like may put ground zero civil war, lol. (joking hope?)

You stay home want safe live. Going headfirst state clearly issue curbing spread getting people follow seemingly obvious health &amp; safety recommendations need create statewide executive decision literally ban citizens public spaces demand private businesses operate certain way. seems like weird inspiration. 

I support overall intent definitely, honest, also higher government intrusion like rarely done. good thing. times like these, happy live smaller town little talked part country haha. Yes, majority around take seriously small-town republicans, etc, that's frustrating. still protected bulk chaos reading living relatively quiet open area. Builds character! prepares married life! **/S** &lt;= **SEE /S** Sure. would wear masks?

Yup, fact vaccines answer really leaving country confused. It‚Äôs good sign higher percent cases children, right? 

Because children yet opportunity vaccinated. 100% cases children, would good sign things overall. 

Also, children better outcomes.  Thanks trunts!  ""other people""? CDC made recommendation yet J&amp;J boosters says people mix brands lol Good lord.. thats bad news bad quickly. vulgar King dirty thrones.

Yes converse continual changing actually trying achieve concrete way. Initially ""don't overwhelm hospitals"". ""wait get enough people vaccinated"". new rallying cry seems ""once EUA kids goes go back normal!"". I'm wondering next thing going be. someone position authority comes says ""when get X done, happens"" definitively could literally go forever. always going people vaccine work well for, another group wait full approval, or, or, years... uncertainty, lack concrete goal, many people starting feel mentally defeated situation. 18-19 months shit think valid observation make. I‚Äôm not. might wait out. longer wait time, stronger boost may be.  People put deep echo chambers, even hear truth, goes opinion ‚Äúthe masses‚Äù groupthink quickly discredit it. need, website mentions event issue links like 10-15 different articles different sources. read several different opinions, start weed ones bias/polarity. truth usually lies somewhere 2 extremes.

Sad kids It‚Äôs hyperbole, mocking many people arguing 18 months kids don‚Äôt catch spread coronavirus way adults do. It‚Äôs primary argument people making favor full person learning, masks school.

And percent people vaccinated, relative behaviors two groups beyond foolish - concerning stat possible circumstances.

My minimizing giving proper window dressing. thing doing. Even discussion mine still come back incorrect characterization (already addressed above).

For purpose (and I) want for, strictly inferior efficacy rate. confounded vaccination rate makes difficult tell good number not. Would concerned 100% vaccine breakthrough rate? Well, depends. First thing would extremely happy meant everyone vaccinated. we'd dig actually figure what's going determine much efficacy vaccine (or hasn't) slipped.

So, want ""most concerning"" stat, efficacy rate current prominent variants. That's far relevant convoluted stat increases people get vaccinated. mean, get point, kind statement vaguely sexist *and* ageist. Little girls pretty tough. Chances would miniscule regardless vax status Nah. bunch people go vaccinated states medical treatment. we'll back square one.

And I‚Äôm necessarily advocating returning lockdown re-opening schools. rather bickering taking every precaution can, mainly masking everyone vaccinating *everyone* interacts kids (faculty, older kids, families home, etc.) 
School gross Petri dish but, say, it‚Äôs important one. antibodies created following vaccine (based different strain delta) could interfere ""natural"" production antibodies infected delta strain?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* CDC puts death rate children around 1 50,000. show exactly said. comment go along links point trying make? Update:

Tennessee kids % population (&lt;15yo): 21%

Tennessee vaccination rate: 41% (of eligible) , unvaxxed = 59% adults. 

So unvaxxed adults % total population = .79 x .59 = 47.2% 

So total vulnerable population barring breakthroughs = 68.2% population 

Kids % vulnerable = ~31%. 

Kids cases % total cases = 36%, close enough. 

There's probably error margin calculations within ballpark. math check out? I‚Äôll see bitches January, sincerely snowbirds, catch seniors 60+ patio event woohooo!!! honestly idea world even talking about. wonder replied right post.

My point policies goals set policymakers leaders seem oriented around completely eliminating risk covid. never done. always risk always cause illness death. point, hopefully soon, level illness deemed reasonable acceptable. Kids die every year swimming pools trampolines banned people ultimately believe deaths acceptable. mindset change must eventually take place Covid, otherwise people constantly pursue policies ever-declining benefits, third fourth shots vaccine restricting behavior vaccinated people much unvaccinated people, completely ineffective think might benefit. Yeah two months data available totally prove adverse effects learning, speech/social development illness. Super scientific research done here. Bit mild usual.

I know several teachers various states. get notice kid stays hone tested positive. Usually teacher speaks parent. cases far say parents can't tell kid infected simply staying hone positive test. consider Jaws ""so much gore"" wonder saw movie everyone else did. Dope, hopefully recall newsom new governor #RECALLNEWSOM FYI it‚Äôs right that‚Äôs anti-vax‚Ä¶ make large portion crowd also ‚Äòholistic medicine‚Äô / ‚Äòhippie‚Äô types anti-vax too, anti-covid vaccine, anti vaccines. know quite them. opposite looking data points. Vaccinated majority people talk day day also. 

But heard first second-hand infections even hospitalizations 2020. 2020 per-time basis, definitely. seems closer ever seems like people much prevent it. Like kind bad karma. I'm sorry, getting vaccine tested safe getting vaccinated. Testing prevent getting spreading it. still get spread vaccine far less issue. vaccinated putting many people around risk asked answered today's AMA infectious disease expert. pandemic over

BetaGamma variant says hold beer i‚Äôm student teacher tennessee, using alt obvious reasons. it‚Äôs getting bad school it‚Äôs going get worse. we‚Äôre fortunate kids school wear masks, progression virus naturally inclining, basically support county state Thank explanation. course stupid. Rhodes Scholars talking here, members established cult denies science rational thought. Yep, that's right.  Mostly supporters 

That‚Äôs bold move state that‚Äôs creeping purple   Wait what? Probably. death rate 1.6% start current us  TX Supreme Court ruled mask mandates. updated 200,000? fucked‚Ä¶ Yup, I'm feeling like always have, sure wouldn't. FDA advised vaccine Texas would work opposite way?  Mostly Covaxin Covishield , google listening old conspiracy radio show late 90s/early 00s, tended skew conservative politics every often.

Its incredible, could replace names old politicians current politicians something would hear today big media outlets.

The big difference conservatives super concerned climate change back then. Amazing.  I'm sorry grandma. Excess deaths help us estimate Gotta get dat Canadian forwarding address they'll ship Canada. Still know health safety become political. Republic Party killing own. burden proof claim system requires constant growth. literally fictional change pandemic go long way disputing growth progress

I idea defining growth Guidance never made sense seems like thought vaccine kept viral transmission low enough case vaccinated. Florida peaked not? Apparently cases went again. looked like peaked. data regarding breakthrough cases, hospitalizations deaths vaccinated obese individuals? 

We know obesity significant risk factor Covid related morbidity mortality. unvaccinated obese good combo unless you‚Äôre trying win r/HermanCainAward . vaccinated though? degree obesity increase risk negative outcomes Covid infection, despite vaccination? curious specific information this. ‚ÄúHouston, problem‚Ä¶.‚Äù lungs Kids approved stages. 5-12 eligible, still worry 0-4.  Maybe next time someone hurl something little heavier. mean able say it.  CHILDREN!!!! REEEEEEEEEEE No, I'm not. I'll agree abused agree people supply information bad faith deserve voice. stupid, covid non vaxxers first booted. dont punish right thing believe that‚Äôs lower rate flu

/s case obvious.  talking vaccinated people. critique using viral RNA measure viral load. There‚Äôs good FAQ link below, pasted relevant parts well. 

‚ÄúSome news stories gone beyond that‚Äîsuggesting viral load breakthrough cases delta isn‚Äôt high. It‚Äôs equal loads seen cases among unvaccinated people. evidence show?
This claim caused lot concern recent weeks suggests protection offered COVID-19 vaccines eroding. It‚Äôs primarily based CDC report described outbreak Barnstable County, Massachusetts. case, researchers tested infected individuals parameter called CT, indicates presence viral RNA often taken proxy viral load. However, several issues complicate interpretation data, acknowledged report.

What issues?
Before vaccines, CT reasonable proxy viral load. it‚Äôs unclear that‚Äôs case vaccinated individuals. individual mounts successful immune response, infectious virus destroyed, RNA may remain. explains may continue test positive COVID-19 months recover longer risk others.

We don‚Äôt yet know whether vaccine breakthrough cases truly shedding high levels infectious virus. Barnstable report clearly states test results could ‚Äúaffected factors viral load‚Äù ‚Äúmicrobiological studies required.‚Äù

Additionally, yet-to-be published report Singapore, breakthrough infections vaccinated individuals achieved similar CT values unvaccinated cases, brief amount time. Vaccinated people able clear virus much faster unvaccinated people. Another study Imperial College London United Kingdom examined nearly 100,000 people England June 24 July 12, 2021 (when delta dominant variant). found vaccinated individuals lower viral load average compared unvaccinated  Listen Canadians.

I've seen plenty video evidence absolutely bat shit insane people call Canada home. Including people fly fucking Trump flags.

Then there's abuse native people going back decades.

Please shut hell up, clearly much better room smug. I'm independent living **very red** part upper North Texas tell certain people thrilled mask mandates vaccination mandates.

Normal people don‚Äôt that, ever. would like said half people likely care family either. selfish care kids mini parents pandemic never control thanks states like Texas Florida. using mandates political weapons telling people ""but freedoms"". good freedom get COVID left chronic life long condition die? could right. understanding lot ICU/bed capacity somewhat liquid, different units/equipment migrate demand rises (i.e. adult ICU beds getting repurposed PICU hit capacity). whole system strained, obviously less salve. long term effects lung damage still hurt vaccinated slighter symptoms? ‚ÄúHow could possibly happened??!!‚Äù

Good Yup, think it'll get worse. think immunity wanes vaccinated people start getting severe disease, anti-vaxers use inspire doubt vaccine reality immunity wanes need booster. so, 14,000 pediatric cases 60 hospitalized.. believe that's lower rate flu.  trump bumbling idiot / narcissist think ahead.

It exhausting though, especially year now. I'm there. 

I've resigned least buying O2 pulse ox thermometers loved ones refuse get vaccinated hope they're well equipped this. Amen! That's good attitude have. current vaccines lower risk contracting disease around 80%, (averaging different numbers different studies,) *and* reduce likelihood spreading another person *even infected* somewhere 50-70%. 

That‚Äôs 100%, it‚Äôs *not nothing.* got 90+% population vaccinated numbers, you‚Äôd soon see nearly spread.  swear Davidson Shelby counties sane ones around. able get vaccine early going Wilson county excess nobody time getting them. you‚Äôre youngish don‚Äôt serious health issues, go fun life life.   True‚Ä¶ also wondering many people sneaking boosters.  Agreed, seems half-assed. Congrats getting 3rd shot! must huge relief. Good luck there! paying attention what's going on? We're going accept increasing death rate order put countries first. Well done Brazil! Cheers Chile! ""To protect spread covid"" something like  Monday March 16th, 2020 everything California shut abruptly. family March 15th joking all, woke 16th gym classes cancelled.

Censorship help stop spread ideas though. two actual pieces info I've seen recently pretty bad. first J&amp;J 71% efficiency hospitalization, believe bad even worse Moderna Pfizer boosters, second 16% breakthroughs come J&amp;J even though 8% population it.

As someone whose entire family got J&amp;J, I've following closely everything I've seen lately felt like propaganda, news articles say boosters needed look numbers seems like boosters absolutely needed. good thing say decreased much Moderna Pfizer, that's case started way worse them.

Feel free show read find it, definitely curious.  unvaccinated people what's causing mess hospitals first place. Anyone else worried break cases? I‚Äôm vaccinated Pfizer feeling day today. Weird headaches / brain fog/ fatigue. Kinda worried I‚Äôve around lot people lately ( college student). Delta seems inevitable person classes. Yes, happened 5% delta got rolling? happens hospital available. get much much worse. may get dry rub hurricane heading gulf coast monday  Agree, mandatory vaccine inevitable, course land many already died needlessly  can, million+ us (before couple weeks ago say first shot again). 

It's honor system. Vaccines going waste thousands, like taking away someone else getting yours. know side effects work?  returned work shocked affected still seemed be, much worse hoped. suffering level dissociation, sort delay processing things. 

A co-worker described seeing me, knowing happened, stuck slow motion. would half second delay processing someone told me, times would seem wander aimlessly. environment noisy busy would retreat somewhere quieter.

However, today lot better. made sure get plenty rest night before, take time seriously mentally prepare day ahead, seemed take edge things. There's definite, slow improvement week.

Thank continued interest.  sure hope they're requiring social distancing indoors they're recommending masks outdoors. Care giver burnout bad nurses, hurts patients too. People likely make mistakes they're worked slept. 

This bad situation around. Healthcare system struggling. Resistance infection starts fading 6 months, sure, still showing remain effective preventing severe disease. Let's get doomsday here. still need see data effective booster doses are, imagine they'll effective. reality able stop Texas shifting purple blue long term. many companies people moving places like West Coast stop shift.

Self rule sometimes called anarchy.  property even cheaper half population dead! need vaccinated wear masks? vaccine risk complications, least one FDA approved dangerous vaccines. seems strange afraid like 0.001% risk complications vaccine instead accept much larger risk serious covid infection. Serious antivaxers literally conspiracy theorists though, im confused  100,000k 90,000 Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana Florida school nurse can't keep up. told exposed staff they're vaccinated get tested bc positve quarentine. Um? Yeah. alternative maybe positve, work, spreading it? 

This can't nice things. Maybe released later, therefor earlier groups likely got two?

Many like critique. lol

Now think it, someone absolutely insisted using properly backdated data, honest way present general public would exclude recent \~1.5 weeks data less say \~95% complete. 

But like said, would defeat purpose backdating DeSantis's purposes, since constantly down-trending graph play pretty well politically. NO! Coronaviruses common southern China. Hubei province central China... far away site previous coronavirus pandemics.  that? Nebraska that? joke friend family convinced better... lied get booster saying 1st shot, scheduled 2nd, he's going keep appointment. get two after. told that's probably going help, he's Florida bit freaked out.   That's great! Keep good work! Likely encouraging kids bully anyone see mask too.  ""But wait!!! Theres more!!!"" - Tennessee weeks.  We're mask mandated school 10 days 10% quarentined. good portion positve. mask safe. 33% yesterday: 50-70% people wore mask public. area far mean, core party people he's talking about.

Like, general sense. individuals lol way US force Texas Florida secede Union? I'm sure bad administration mitigated removing profit motive. Losing staff really unprofitable. mean even neurotypical kid, still follow direction kids. line thrown people looking excuses kids, people lazy parent kids. wrr Thought thing Connecticut strengthened gun laws. Two words: Sandy Hook. 

The republicans care children dying, nothing prevent it. infringes FrEeDoMs. Delta, sounds like probably chose correctly, although vaccines still help mitigating severity outcomes. Except Best film ever thinking question long enough Add NSW, Australia list. Source? wrg, idts, thing not, cepuxyuax, say, say nmw think people entitled social media. break ToS, entitled keep using it?

Also, clarify, conversation would different government involved, not.  Wonder stocks holds interests are. educationism tolerated. really wants kill voters uh?  school require masks? start Monday hoping masks save us I‚Äôm concerned. Florida backdating deaths Worldometers well, Florida's death numbers come in, put day death happened. last 10 days Worldometers Florida death count gone 40,584 42,731, increase 200 day. long continue report way, never see increases looking daily page. (all?) states reporting increase deaths specifying happened, get put daily count. 

For historical purposes, way Florida probably technically better, evaluating real time state doing, total shit.  understanding vaccines highly flawed, makes multiple claims efficacy safety untrue.

It would take far long correct things got wrong.

If want good information, I've compiled tons   talking point children spread covid bullshit whole time? Okay, thanks clarifying. might biased vaccinated Moderna. won‚Äôt work matter many old ladies help cross street, middle pandemic make easier virus kill main vulnerable, shitty person. 100,000 seems remarkably low considering 1,000+deaths day right now. 120 days left year weather going get colder. Meanwhile cases rising people changing behavior.

The second wave coming make first wave look like nothing. Restrictions already went short period 2&amp;3. came back 3 longer true. serious answer. suggestions address capacity problems caused COVID-19 slightest. seem think ""50-75% fatality"" correct threshold action---in words, unless 150 million Americans could die, nothing done. 

The fact vaccines significantly reduces risk infection, transmission, severity illness, without completely eliminating it. High vaccine uptake reduces hospital load brings pandemic back manageable levels. 

Your leading questions imply rigid, binary thinking: either works completely all. poor reasoning. Jurisdictions high vaccinations rates fewer cases, fewer ICU admissions, fewer fatalities, unvaccinated people overrepresented per capita these. 

I know want Americans die.  Jaws (1975) work anti bullshit department. allow people smoke inside cars children. 

Oh, wait, bill ban already defeated Republicans Tennessee. think happening weird way? Numbers data seem inconsistent across board, politicians businesses pushing anything before, sudden feels like medical right information slipping away.

People fib run trouble places start requiring boosters. Well, mean, fib like first shot part record. exactly same, amazing FDA's burocracy make things licensed vaccine formulation EUA-authorized vaccine products

We thousands control groups ICU already 1.5 hour flight?? get lucky?? Normally delay like 6 hours. Sometimes feel even lose money change plans make low rates even worth lol Including Cambodians? lol, kidding me? Vaccination health factor. Situation refers things like full/part time, service length, location etc. Come Montana governor made us state illegal require vaccination anything. Guess it‚Äôs way solve housing shortage. 6 months  Thank God unions protect us corporate lackeys like yourself. contract clear payment insurance is.

Watch start raise prices fat Reddit suddenly change mind supporting policies like this. impact lockdowns lasted weeks. Schools closed still are, people unable travel, pursue jobs, play sports, entertain entertained, get adequate health care, see family, suffered mental health issues, etc. continually throughout pandemic.

And continues even though orders magnitude safer year ago enough, because, people believe, always someone risk, new risk. People continue restrictions someone, somewhere, can't get vaccinated. always true, forever, globally, eternity.

At point, sure exactly when, risk overblown. always small chance kids getting serious illness schools -- flu, mono, chicken pox, measles, tuberculosis, etc. despite widespread vaccination. Yet society everyone comfortable unlikely treatments available.

There also unlikely risks kids face every day -- may get hit car, abducted, injured playground, contract cancer, etc. lock society result. take reasonable precautions let everyone live lives.

My point simply never 100% safe Covid. always there, always spreading, mutating, never reach 100% vaccination immunity. can't keep schools closed stop functioning society forever.  Delta variant handing health insurance premiums? sign up? Answer clear. doctor comfortable getting vaccine, need mask isolate right now. much risk. European countries provide citizens. Everyone pays receives services. US poorest poor qualify. even then, it‚Äôs temporary. would happily pay percentage points taxes meant could student loans monthly healthcare premiums. would save money overall wouldn‚Äôt fight prove ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù help. i..oope, time booster!

New case also mostly 18-24 age group also one lowest vaccinated age groups. sitting 74% first 62% second dose. 
They would also thy social age group 
Also age group much prenatal control probably least responsible.  


So think may solely delta blame. 
Human behavior still major driver outcomes. scientist doctor try listen health officials. According vaccinated still spread hospitalized even dead. Wouldn‚Äôt mean point vaccinations either mostly vaccinated people getting sick spreading it? 

I understand unvaxxed worse get vaxxed still spread contract covid would let ‚Äúlive lives‚Äù? state reporting total 55,400 people died New York coronavirus, based data Centers Disease Control Prevention, Hochul said statement .

Maybe, maybe not. unclear right much spread fully vaccinated people asymptomatic mildly symptomatic cases. certainly less unvaccinated individuals, substantially earlier variants. panacea, it'll probably help R0 least some. Bigger potential older individuals show waning immunity coming months, possibly point significant increases serious illness mortality. last time UK seven day average caseload 33,000 (pre vaccine) 19 January 1,100 deaths per day. figure 101. 3664 hospitalizations per day, 700. think meaning word ""conservative"" recently turned head. me, ""conservative"" mean, someone tries conserve something.  People everything power destroy nation, government, businesses, economy, even individuals lives, ""conservative"". you‚Äôre US, every state things differently. almost exceptions it‚Äôs exactly difficult make happen. 

SF straight authorized it: states aren‚Äôt exactly organized.

As always - talk doctor I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll advice. here. Many pro-mandators want enforcement purely spite political reasons. want unvaccinated suffer financial, social, legal problems realize issues loss worker rights eventually circle back around large percentage unvaccinated currently minorities.  agree. easy labeled ‚Äúanti vaxx‚Äù know ever look EOB's mine typically discounted like 40ish percent ""billed amount"" like... dude would insurance assume they'd paid pretty penny Can't wait terrorist need help daily activities run breath easily.

Then again, applies evenly kids women innocent people too. suffer idiots Taliban. Pisses off. didn‚Äôt vaccine that. hadn‚Äôt even isolated virus. Delta self-funded wouldn‚Äôt apply. premiums including employee employer share $800-$1200/month days. increasing employee‚Äôs share $200 might still mean employer paying half. understand hesitancy pregnant women get vaccinated.

CDC et al communicated better. Hugely important think New York Times misreporting said too? would think that? First evenwith pay more. know first hand. Housing much like euro need basis. Financial aid universities also top notch community college state schools also decent option  Extremely doubtful, ask pharmacist nurse whoever giving shot though concerned. concerning thing seems like Biden administration wants ""unified"" strategy 3 vaccines approving boosters, they're waiting 9/20. So, want data boosters Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, analyze go regulatory process. That's ridiculous. us got Pfizer early healthcare workers wait nearly 9 months afterwards 6 month booster. Lmao Lambda looks many these! important provide sources.

""I heard someone say healthy people harmed vaccine"" means nothing unless source statement. Otherwise lie. 

I looked article (with google translate) article mention PERCENT people vaccine harmful effects. Sure, 6000+ harmful cases article, look many people vaccine. 

Google says 24,701,704 south Korean people vaccinated. So, 6,000 / 24,701,704 = 0.024% chance harmful side effect. tiny!! 

Meanwhile, covid death rate Korea 2,237 deaths /241,000 cases = 0.928%. 

0.928% / 0.024% = 39 times likely die Covid, compared harmful side effects vaccine. 

It's important compare likely something is, rather stating ""healthy people harmed vaccine"". example: healthy people might choke die drinking water, mean worry drinking water! Good luck! Hope wife gets treatment needs. evolutionary stand point, antibodies breast milk serve zero purpose waste energy perspective. bother sending antibodies there? Urine, saliva, semen likely contain antibodies, evidence bodily fluids containing antibodies. Ergo, woman's milk contain antibodies long nurses, means evolutionary benefit it. first months mattered, they'd disappear milk. thought effect now, funny someone family used months ago dispute charge dropped it. LOL. Maybe know either... I‚Äôm defending US system here, there‚Äôs lot misconceptions here. 

The insurance companies low ball fuck hospitals. Hospital asks $10, insurance gives $1. next time hospital asks $20, insurance company gives $1.5. Keep going hit millions. ‚Äúmillion dollar bill‚Äù insurance pays you, paid $1k, seems. Insurance paying anywhere close amount. don‚Äôt give shit downvotes. People understand this.  it‚Äôs almost like there‚Äôs still pandemic going multiple things help combat Id unsurprised changed mind people unwilling accept said anything different.

I dont really issue either making mistake changing mind based new data. dont think cool deliberately misinform people change behavior though guess different topic. wish way mandated private schools well. antivaxx relative Chicago get required keep teaching job dont think employer require it. goes waves, probably come winter (‚òûÔæü„ÉÆÔæü)‚òû correct Live fear brotha! come religious exemption.  Good, sex workers people too!  I‚Äôm Portland Or, hospitals much brink overload, despite high vaccination rates. Rural hospitals worse OR, lower vax rates. skimmed order, appears apply businesses accept public money/contracts. Ah, see! probably prefer getting regardless honestly, I'm hoping people weaponise justify getting vaccinated... always knew Republicans hated children. Welp feel young guess, I'm curious though, march dimes well vaccine efforts back we're debacle we're now? Could done anything different? Delta bump vaccine rates it‚Äôs bit early see FDA approval increase more. 

People might waiting till weekend too. man imagine covid uses bodies kids rapidly mutate super properties, know, cause kids like rapidly growing full explosive genetics. anyways new fact check facebook next week anything they'll loosen limit hours certified driver road every day. district West TN trying keep attendance rates high possible. don‚Äôt send kids home last period. 

Released new guidelines today saying kids wearing masks close contact doesn‚Äôt excluded class. infected kid isn‚Äôt masked excluded. 

Parents livid. Saying feel persecuted letting children breathe. ‚äô_ ò machines said Matrix... humans actually virus. pizza yummy    imagine airline posted kind statistic. ""Come fly us, kill one 385 passengers.""  outrage. 

But COVID - ""it's flu."" Closer 1 million look excess deaths. Deworming see discourse quite bit even saw something close todays thread, paraphrase:

 User 1:""I losing hope...my state implemented mask mandate despite high vaccination rate.. feel like exit strategy terrified. wanna wear mask forever""

User 2: ""Delta burn people fast get us form immunity, wave pass hospitals better spot.""

But user 2 often realize user 1 know wave pass. wave pass cases decline course, worried elected officials keeping mandate anyway weeks months after. sort conspiracy want masks forever, simply exit strategy masks often called ""zero cost measure"". believe masks forever? No.They ended think elected official truly truly wants permanent masks. see people might start getting worried? Sure. exit strategy kills morale, yes understand situation changed delta change human nature. 

Mask mandates important part fight delta, ""zero cost"" end point. noticed many people repeating tropes seem adopted first months disease looked new research since then..

Please take time look research since then. Literally almost everything changed regarding drugs treatments, virus spreads, effective ineffective treatments, vaccines do.

In many cases longer research proved opposite original presumptions.

If think know things formed opinions first months pandemic likely wrong everything certain of. Yes. Even you. Yes. Even that. claiming combining several weeks data putting create single day increase? high right I? tally entire pandemic death toll put books claim 600k dead largest single day increase?     Try reading news. It‚Äôs already happening. good counter points. I'm stuck county proactive without forced state that's bias power purse üëú guy work quit vaccine mandate.

He's career professional, industry decades, guaranteed job retirement. Willing throw away.

Thing is, used army, *know* he's vaccines people. Yet DeSantis thinks Biden follow lead. Guys killing people. COUNTY, Fla. ‚Äî Central Florida Division AdventHealth reached capacity hospital morgues due influx COVID-19 patients, organization said begun utilizing rented, refrigerated coolers 10 campuses throughout Orange, Osceola, Polk, Seminole, &amp; Volusia counties,‚Äù email said. ‚ÄúThese coolers quickly becoming filled also.‚Äù

Where people kept asking 'isnt normal hospitals full capacity' last handful weeks posts nearing max capacity? know parents local school board meetings sure think people die kids wear mask something freedom,and liberty. pandemic ripped open bunch political, racial, class based wounds. probably much politicized sides. Fuq‚Ä¶ unvaccinate3d admitted hospitals unless kids... Lol. Good thing clarified. pedantic wrong. 

Per CDC, Florida's vaccination rates average best:

* Total Population: 51.9% smidge national rate 51.7%

* 18+ Population: 61.8% smidge national rate 62.7%

The subsequent backlash sent increasingly bizarre comment pattern. think worry restrictions ""lasting forever"" relatively unfounded.

I fully agree this, think also easy understand people scientists medical professionals etc. may worried restrictions might last forever long-term. That's point posts... get people mentally exhausted. people positions actual authority helping failing give people goals work towards. fairness, probably minorities connections medically experimented government, might unfortunately developed fear vaccines etc starting point. There's difference straight political anti-vaxxer dreaming new reasons obnoxious dumbass every day, somebody fear something real really targeted people like them. think I‚Äôll side effects 145th?

who cares clearly working 98,000 unvaccinated. there, going church, making plans future, planning big trip winter. looking forward kids wedding next summer, getting married themselves. pregnant children have.

The amount needless pain suffering people bring friends, family medical professionals desperately trying save heartbreaking.

Its like trying talk people getting bus brakes seat belts. believe us disaster happen, even show proof.

Notice absolutely cannot bring say schools safe children, staying home ‚Äúworse‚Äù. ‚Äúless safe‚Äù. ‚Äúworse‚Äù.

There never effort make virtual schooling work, live Texas virtual schooling actively undermined. Now, schools say kids must go severely understaffed filling vacancies unqualified underqualified temporary subs (which detrimental maths). addition, teachers far less effective result way work school outside $0 pay. 

The toll children virtual learning could massively ameliorated cared bother. not. want kids school, learning not, safe not, parents keep stock market high. 

There also credible health expert predicted Delta bad kids is. Every pro-reopening expert minimized shooed away notion viral evolution could evade vaccines, assumed consistency quality availability education never existed due resignations, firings, early retirements, paraprofessional attrition. 

Look Emily Oster, New York Times‚Äô reopening arguer du jour. Remember, canard last year around time ‚Äúkids don‚Äôt get don‚Äôt spread it‚Äù.

Now, apparently, effects healthcare system collapsing secondary importance opening schools right August surge understaffed. 

Serious question, much expect put upon teachers break? older ones already have. disagree. I'm MA, despite minor spread, death rate pretty static months. 

Normal people accept never going away, circulate vaccinated populations like flu. people fine, small minority get sick. That's something we're going live with. 

I'm embracing normal now. Ooof. I‚Äôm sorry. know you‚Äôre crack. 

We‚Äôre almost winter peak. It‚Äôs scary there.  That‚Äôs point vaccination, immune system already type virus. 

What you‚Äôre describing someone vaccinated. get infected, immune system triggered, it‚Äôs race time. covid shut body result death, immune system build enough antibody fight back. Eventually immune system able fight back, long host isn‚Äôt dead. Walmart gets flooded nurses local hospital shift change. Yesterday, counted 27 people shopping scrubs, zero masks.

Those not. 

Just simple. 

Two Americas. Yeah are. Since start history really. earth tries eat us constantly Uh, plenty actual scientists work field believe COVID may become endemic. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶not antivax thing. wish remembered story took place. remember reading one time ago hospital completely ran oxygen, employees could watch entire unit slowly died. much better pre delta, changed. spreads faster herd immunity occurs quickly.

LOL @ Comirnaty. Israel nearly beat COVID delta variant arrived. think would happened population 100% vaccine coverage?  true.

3-4 weeks doses always expected suboptimal terms triggering maximum immune response. window selected get trials done quickly possible (8 12 weeks would mean 4-8 weeks later reach market). 

Many vaccines required 3 doses adequate long term protection. HepB, DTaP, PCV, Polio, on. 

Some vaccines require lifelong boosters like Tdap. vaccines received childhood adolescents booster recommendations going areas endemic spread (e.g., MMR). 

tl;dr: possible turn annual booster; also possible (perhaps likely) post-immediate pandemic, turn 3-5 year booster schedule like many vaccines, recommended prior travel disease remains strongly endemic (of course, likely US fall category anti-vax habits persist here). think would really cool could make really simple test check covid antibodies easily available.

No, typically large liquid oxygen storage tank one vaporizers regulators, piping distribute gas outlets throughout hospital. tank refilled tanker truck. don‚Äôt think change ways families tragically affected. plenty folks still deny COVID die it, families blame shift onto healthcare workers, still refuse vaccine, etc‚Ä¶ mean maybe witnessing children suffer impactful I‚Äôm hopeful point.

It‚Äôs really sad. care happens them.

There's huge lack empathy among people gravitate towards kinds political views popular among crowd. like trump. vaccines appear around  effective infections. efficacy infection lower 66%

Don't two statements contradict? think y‚Äôall expecting much. fluid situation conditions dictate responses. healthcare function normal manner see restrictions ease. Right one knows might transpire.

We don‚Äôt COVID-18 playbook look answers. Ignorance many lies uploaded, think lies presented quality science?  course quit, act everyone quitting en masse going solve anything. hurt people charge nearly much hurts needy  figures, get stuff, trigger reaction ok first couple times.  Healthcare system brink overload anti vaxxers point blank period. goes on, despite difficulty. 

No, doesn't. Thats point. Global warming looking like extinction level event humans. asymptomatic cases still estimated 40% cases? feel like heard anything regarding stat year.  end game probably, hear out, keeping students, staff, faculty safe healthy. seem hard understand. complex conspiracy. Exactly! tell wife time strongest position strike. medical field abused right now. workers living nightmare daily burnt out. Working overtime, taking toll mental health financially still majority probably glooming $270,000 dollar student debt pay off. 

Imagine treating people dying severely ill every single day trying best large portion population handful politicians downplaying severity situation. 

I swear feel like people don‚Äôt clean leave trash park. leave someone else deal it. can't get players vaccinated, short season. understand correctly Feds allowing states/localities follow path specific restrictions like masks, exception stuff Federally controlled like air train travel (where masks mandated January, believe, sure exact date). CDC laid metrics tied # positive cases county, places using number make decisions. 

I say I'm NY longer mask mandate moment, although masks still common (though ubiquitous) certain situations. Nearly every county state CDC's recommended level indoor masking regardless vaccination, seems little appetite broadly bringing back place schools (where kids young get vaccine). I've said before, lot people effective social end pandemic happened May/June, Delta seem much change that, least among younger healthy people.  look good governors resume. I'm sorry Floridians going this. relatives going vacation Florida September. bought trip everyone thought things getting better. cancel didnt get cancellation insurance want go Disney World. stupid. Go ahead make sure quarantine get back dumbasses. It‚Äôs really possible lot people though peak hurricane season. deaths covid eventually decline permanently but, again, never reach zero. always deaths. level deaths acceptable? morbid sounds number. Tens thousands die flu every year never locked society. Truth people dying flu generally sick begin flu death knell.

Which way true Covid well. fatalities highly concentrated 15% population, elderly health conditions. Children statistically likely die swimming pool accident Covid even today infections spiking. young healthy people gathering bars beaches concerts statistically little risk.

So again, never shut concerts sports events flu season. always possible people catch flu bring home elderly parents grandparents. allowed anyway. different now? People eventually need realize Covid go away, always present, living consequences Covid better living consequences restrictions. I'd imagine hospital could pull vaccination records directly state database. like I'd carrying vaccine card went ER. read yesterday tested ‚Äú351‚Äù specific booster vs. D614g original booster didn‚Äôt see much difference effectiveness rolled safer quicker route sticking OG vaccine. 1st worst me. thought going die friend come incase needed call 911. 2nd one hit way quicker though sick within 1 hour. 

But I'm glad hear seems like 3rd worse 1st 2nd. Everyone responding seems agree that. didn‚Äôt stop Florida voting trump 2020. would 2024 different? Medicine taketh away natural selection. Social media giveth back. means end pandemic going back somewhat normal life, would happily take vaccine every year. folks screaming throwing feces school district meeting older probably didn‚Äôt even kids district. give zero fucks kids. think would sharing medical reports. would sharing vaccination card tag account appropriately.

It really different showing vaccination card restaurant. already provide international flying etc. really info card concerns sharing. tool box far, vaccines working well expected severe disease. Delta didn‚Äôt change much. Waining immunity seems issue Pfizer shot (less Moderna), seems leading asymptomatic positive tests mild cases severe disease.

But lot COVID cases, going lot vaccinated hospitalizations, even vaccine works expected. Killing lumpen voters bold move Cotton. Truths. one jobs like daycare chews people apits reward that's altruistic would interesting see variant like delta actually stuck around longer (with lower severity) due smaller / rotating pool infectable hosts vaccine antibodies wane dependent vaccine date etc. Ie worst case virus everyone would infected simultaneously leaving available hosts.  guess news websites letting people read covid news free anymore.  goes lot places US now. vaccinated lets honest, way protected people bar.  Well fuck that. Whatta think people are? Major sports movie stars? no... give fancy looking pen thanks, call ""heroes"", assume makes feel good all. Good stuff. live Georgia feel way.

But, idiots majority.. even South. instance, Georgia, 62% adults decided get vaccine. That's great terrible either.  care never did. 

They want talking point. care lie not. 

They keep repeating Florida years come.

You also could walk CVS tell immuno. require proof (I havent heard that) could go another place till dont ask proof. could lie say first shot (although dont like want vaccine card fill out) ""The American Colonies"" /s say immunocompromised CPOD. think check.

You also go CVS/Walgreens website make appointment first. Reports indicate 3rd dose better getting covid... Leaving rubbish convinces people must true Alabama family it... yeah, there's big overlap. I‚Äôve heard many EMTs basically make minimum wage, close it. kidding, right? 

About two half months ago, CDC issued (widely criticized) advice said vaccinated people longer needed wear masks. evidently living cave missed it. 

They since sandbagging walking terrible policy back. lot people died result it. ""harmful videos"" certainly taken down. ""About 120 Willis-Knighton Medical Center‚Äôs 138 coronavirus patients unvaccinated, including Debroecks.""

Whelp... Covid deaths 1/4 peak (and slope improving thankfully). Hard describe situation ""nightmare"" isnt bad less year ago. Bad, sure. catastrophe. Yup, 100% idea express everyone represents local, state, national government. hear pressure feel something it.

It's kind like flat-earther. look right front see something eyes real enough mind. What's happening world beyond field vision simply matter you. earth looks flat front porch, Covid's bad get it. selfish though. right that's unfortunate. always understood vaccine prevent coronavirus body - gives body tools fight arrives, able wreak havoc make sick. main draw - getting sick. Now, though, we're actually pivoting vaccine prevent disease, hospitalization death. Which, honestly, great. still want spend two weeks bed feeling miserable, thought vaccine supposed prevent that.

Less words, accurate. Well taking getting covid specifically past weeks since popularized there‚Äôs 29M people Texas who‚Äôve serious covid symptoms past weeks. Number much lower 29M.

I‚Äôve accepted that. don‚Äôt get flu boosters every 6 months though.

You're right, course, get flu boosters every 6 months.

The flu nowhere near transmissible Covid-19, tends wind every year warmer summer months people spend time outside.

The flu variants we're largely concerned us several decades point humans accumulated degree immune response already.

Influenza mutate quickly Covid-19 does, there's less likelihood catastrophic variants spontaneously emerging.

All said, _do_ get flu vaccine boosters every year, so...

Your point almost entirely invalid. . . . think there's point actions taken misinformation causing people become contrarians misinformation alone would have?

Because mean wear mask.

is followed reader question ""To accomplish what?"" Well, looked directly front statement saw talk kids dying, seems like prevent kids dying would obvious it‚Äôs easiest effective precaution implement monitor help control infections severity. Getting vaccine easy effective, it‚Äôs much harder get done large group, harder enforce, harder prove

Pretty much disagree completely this. Harder prove who? I'm school district superintendent, going MUCH easier principals prove 100% staff vaccinated prove 100% staff following proper masking procedures. basically impossible prove me.

Harder enforce? Complete Bullocks. going need enforce mask mandates? Shit tons checks classrooms, break rooms, etc. etc. Without physically going schools, I'll never know. Even get buy principals, that's still LOT work them. need enforce vaccine mandates? Print outs doctors. One time start year I'm immediately clear someone fully vaccinated not.

It's immediately clear school kid vaccinated. (Not COVID yet, mind you) sure think hard thing do. I'm gladdened found silver lining surrounded idiots, always amazing fundamentally different people separated county lines. I'll stay slightly expensive area, thank you. need common sense function.

Don‚Äôt EMT‚Äôs make little too? Honestly, society fucked Every college I've seen basic liberal arts courses, usually prereq. annoying ""Lit 103 British Literature History"" kind classes need six credits non-Liberal Arts degree.

At time hated them, grow older see value. also often courses dropped vocational training order speed streamline. Technically nurse needs know read chart, take history, give meds, provide care, etc leave problem solving doctors, dropping courses makes easier (especially using ""Medical Technicians"" ""Nurse Practitioners"", often focused less broadly trained) get huge amount training needed shorter training cycle doctor go through. helpful nurse critical thinking read lines advocate patients might able articulate actually need, look doctor's shoulder warn make mistakes, provide valuable services outside strict definitions job. Neither apparently recently CDC said vaccinated individuals quarantine exposure unless symptomatic Delta lot contagious, point ZeroCOVID strategies successful countries earlier virus failing Delta. Even New Zealand Australia can‚Äôt contain Delta.

But far vaccine concerned, still protects Delta. Delta‚Äôs advantage extremely high contagiousness, sort immune escape factors.  many staffed volunteers across America.   dangerously uninformed please stop asking parents put children's health line ignorant sociopath. 3rd similar 2nd AC covid.. bad idea anyway unless anti viral filtration system included (hint usual uv based ACs probably wont cut it) Lollapalooza happened month ago 200,000+ people outside packed together 203 infections (00.1%) resulted it.
