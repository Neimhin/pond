0,2021-09-14,"  uterus part immune system. immune cells endometrium. immune systems getting kicked super high gear, retrospect, surprising. Someone Pfizer Moderna thought this. heavy period skipped next period 2nd shot.  admit wondering hell thinking. partly “boosters inappropriate” headlines annoying read. 

We’re throwing away doses basically every week. 

Those doses aren’t going countries help regardless. use them?I know full scale boosters uses lot more, least uses them. 

I’m saying shouldn’t improve rates globally too, reality logistics involved don’t make zero sum. boosters helping abroad. got pregnant first try (last time took 6 months) within week second shot. pregnancy group full similar stories, including people tried long time. Last heard Moderna studied adult dose, 100mcg, well 50mcg 25mcg kids. believe targeting 50mcg dose expanded trial ages 6 12. I’m sure 2-6 2 doses Moderna. Don’t worry, kemp (gerogia) already fight ‘criminal judicial overreach’ (or something like that) vaccine mandates! 

Which amusing since also blamed Biden Georgia’s miserable vaccination rate couple months ago.

I wish joking… normally age adjustments things like that? Still, people age varying levels underlying disease, may push likely get vaccinated. Yes they’re likely carry lower viral load additionally spread lower viral load others. 

But again, trying figure angle they’re this. read news FDA going reunite Friday decide USA use booster shots not. correct? Portugal avoid plague antivaxxers?    less same.

I don’t want lungs nose taste fucked years longer. It’s *human* thing link two things aren’t necessarily linked. stretching term “gaslighting”. take too, inconveniences point get vax eventually. list vaccines required serve military. guess Covid vaccine bridge far people.

* Anthrax (acellular)
* hepatitis (inactivated)
* hepatitis B (subunit)
* influenza (split-killed virus injection live-attenuated virus intranasal)
* measles-mumps-rubella (live)
* meningococcal (polysaccharide conjugate, A/C/Y/W-135)
* poliovirus (killed virus),
* rabies (special operations)
* smallpox (live)
* tetanus-diphtheria toxoids
* typhoid (subunit live-attenuated)
* varicella (live)
* yellow fever (live) still spread bad unvaccinated person. “Less likely” pretty concerning metric. 

And story “we don’t need boosters” bullshit. Give neutralizing immunity. We're set Canada - can't wait! found evidence population densities practice much higher Germany/Austria. 
 
Then suggest study more. 
 Nordic countries magical. perform badly too. completely different standards Nordic countries degree makes absolutely sense. 
 
You trying evade obvious - primary benchmark Sweden Nordic countries. Sweden happens end ranking, statistically significant. Even exclude Iceland remote exception, Sweden end ranking 4 Nordic countries would still significant - even geographically 3 countries surround Sweden. 
 One groups society hit worse immigrants. suspected case harder communicate some, lot countries can't trust government. obviously challenge Sweden, due them, may similar example Germany regard. that's one example. 
 
Except deaths happened older age brackets Sweden relatively much less immigrants (less Estonia). pill actually caused real problems military members yet bozos still take malaria meds avoid vax. Darwin rolling grave. It’s misinformation still spread it.

Avoiding taking hospital bed good thing though. work company 100 people more? loop hole? guy sounds like absolute mong. “Yeah anger deniers!!!” 

I’m tired proverbial vaccination saber rattling.

These people obviously aren’t going get vaccinated regardless much threaten it. fucking ignore asinine cries. Yeah, super carful someone contacting area scab it’s healing. Took while, leaves good scar. followed link. Two people posted studies replies ""...the researchers found fully vaccinated individuals developed breakthrough infections half (49 percent) likely unvaccinated people report symptoms Long COVID Syndrome lasting least four weeks infection.""

4 weeks long. I've lingering symptoms colds last long. could even better news longer time frame much may clear up. countries, really ""shit hole"". much posturing bloviating…

Please something :( give up. Who? should?? put players coaches danger counter productive Since mask requirement ever lifted fully vaccinated people, I’d wager number low.

The number unvaccinated people acted requirement lifted them, however, quite high. undoubtedly many died.  Nah. That’s “American Way”.  Terrifying. Yeah wasnt nearly enough 2nd wave happened year ago? risk collapsing medical system higher ever, everyone pretending Covid-19 gone. dare get hopes up. Im starting settle nice life disappointment misery. 

Ain't room hope anti vaxxers already entered chat variants.  Might well call plumber ask opinion, least common sense  go get Phizer.
I couple months ago (after getting JNJ). Covid deaths represent almost 4 times many deaths resulted second highest cause (gunfire) police officers year yeah honestly weird one outspoken anti-vax players league team. wonder they're going address all. likely, still kinda strange. r/army pretty practical it. drama top comments. throwing stuffy nose took daycare anyway? parents daycare would pissed, kids would pulled daycare allowing sick kids come. Mom shamed putting kids risk, mention vomiting teacher. worked daycare, huge difference runny nose vomiting child. Even without pandemic child right school sick day before. Idiot parents! Maybe FDA come ivory tower realize we're damn pandemic then.  Yea bet God close doors long time ago lol /mikedrop  reserves active duty always different dates completion “x”. shots, training, uniform implementation, etc. reserves almost last receive “x”. 

I’ve active duty reserves reserves always behind curve. may like answer, is. wrong, again. 
In share non-native population, Sweden passed Estonia 2015. paid extra get it. mandated get means get done discharged

I'm Army got shot January. I've also spent months administering vaccine civilians like also bit sceptical Astrazeneca people mainly got blood clots younger women one. Also born condition makes blood clots likely increased concern. 

The obvious solution course simply got another vaccine another technology. Biontech Moderna different blood clots problem appear there. seem also effective Astrazeneca. got vaccination appointments fast could Biontech fully vaccinated now. 

By many people vaccinated world wide. would massive problems Biontech Moderna would know it. risk Covid definitely way higher complications vaccines. anyone know dose Moderna trialing? one browsing military subs

Where browse military submarines? True, even still uncommon dominant strain change point throughout “flu season.” Vaccinating viruses readily adapt change, multiple types table pick (because people don’t want 5 shots every year), always going uphill battle. seems low. Let's say 800k Americans died far. That's 0.2% population. countries already double that. feel like saying 500k American deaths prevented would conservative estimate. There's Boebert Colo got caught husband paid $1M major fossil fuel donor, maybe getting sloppy... get it. national mandate facilities accept Medicare Medicaid. jive this? Like, need vaccinated, even without state? still care. rule niece's daycare kids can't fever 100F. niece even got Covid (very likely daycare since that's place ever going), even acknowledge brother SIL called alert them. consider members military welfare queens? Hah. forgot anthrax. 

My buddy SWO Navy said smallpox one least favorite. Seriously. NYPD still 50% vaccinated, even though Covid #1 cause death officers 2020. 

All emergency services personnel 100% vaccinated. excuse. $20.00000000000 fair think many weren’t thrilled anthrax shot time. health effects afterwards. I’m interested know one getting Go get another shot.
Take charge health.  Meanwhile governor complaining vaccine mandate. busy sticking LGBT people women California burning everyone trapped house! heard cops guarding people’s doors! Lol jk… we’ve done pandemic since May, suckers. think good they're preparing endemic times approaching. don’t want anyone die virus ppl make absolutely difficult sympathy. they’re causing others suffer. one year old happy see this. Thank posting! Isn’t good though? means peak dropping?  Except stats Delta strain dominating off-season far. comparison, no-one heard flu deaths age bracket summer months, ever. ""Just bad apples ..."" think forms say 28 days quote that. ok, love study (not expert like think I'm brilliant arm-chair Quarterback)...

the way accounted difference removing expected value vaccinated indivuduals - cant find worst explain I'll use example made numbers

&amp;#x200B;

1 person goes hospital bc covid costs average $10,000

there 100 people went hospital covid (100\* 10,000 = 1,000,000)

10 vaccine remove 10\*10,000 = 100,000 (now 900,000)

now...if 90 people got vaccinated, 10% would gone hopsital anyways (90\*.10 = 9) 900,000 subtract 9\*10,000 (90,000) 900,000 say unvaccinated people cost US $810,0000

so dont know much cost US...but factored  Lol, zing!   Upvote shiggles. First time I've seen shits giggles compounded before. Thank that. Humana denies 100% rehab...have stroke, bad car accident?...Forget rehab.  That's also good idea. Probably also instating limit many beds occupied COVID patients would probably also help. got one flu shot (by passed appointments), 3rd 5 months. asked write paper. saw card previous 2 gave earlier anyways. Unbelievable dumb researchers “Harvard Medical School” “Tufts Medical Center” are. figurative use word ""literally"" new, history goes back [over 300 laughed, yes, see comments Ok. don’t get vaccine don’t want, rest civilized world choose interact you. 

People don’t get shitty member society complain society doesn’t want include them. covered scar tattoo. want know how. Create time machine return 2016. Make sure Bernie Sanders wins Democratic Primary. wins get universal healthcare. girlfriend works small company 20 people. Everyone double vaccinated early year. 5 people currently sick covid. go punch wall. constitutes dying covid? complication due covid? disease caused weakened immune system due covid? Preexisting condition would likely led years life, due covid quickened? covid murder via hand gun? curious. pandemic eye opening people must acted plague, small pox, polio, etc. data Israel 60+ age group, already authorized boosters US. cannot extrapolated young healthy people Exactly!

Not mention putting FIL (who lung issues) (underlying health condition) risk, every time we're around her.

We insist masks keeping physical distance takes personal attack her. people want ways, infuriating. Could explain fully, using dengue fever example?  Retired, three shots. Lol.  cuz DEMONRAT wants get it. want believe data represented statement  Crazy thing ability run accurate computer simulations. new technology shortened time? Crazy . think….. hove mouth disease thing past!!!! reservist busy can’t spare 15 mins pop Walgreens lunch. 

And are, command would absolutely give day drill go get knocked out. Reservists sit around fucking phones till it’s time mop formation thing anyways. officer safety issue  comment? Covid leading cause death police officers America 2020. yet still threaten quit job defending it. Hmm wonder science...  Yea need court martialed (trial, could compared felony conviction) DD  Tested humans meant Oh believe me, know plight journalism field well. used work field. Lost 4 jobs 10 years due downsizing/bankruptcy/closure. last paper consolidated 5 papers 2 lost 50% ad revenue year. pandemic didn’t help, even things began reopen, none regular businesses used advertise us returned. Subscription sales pretty much running time let go, wasn’t much. think pandemic, content free. It’s important public health safety, seems like good marketing strategy get people onto site, see previews articles, get hit paywall. might entice new subscribers may considered it. least that’s 2c.  feel like honorable discharge would right move tbh. Way less upset people way. unfair. Sure, cost money, would negative PR enforcing ‘get vaccinated become unemployable’ nonsense. vaccine uses animal blood cells. officially opposed covid vaccines. I'm Air Force I'd say r/AirForce really much anti vax sentiment. normal subs least. even someone anti vaccine comments, heavily downvoted Dumbasses think going find 6-figure jobs somewhere else?

They really stupid! Vietnam allow population travel. Chinese style lock downs allowed leave house outbreak city. Food delivered house.  think it’s plausible. live Oregon think part reason current wave rough despite high vaccination rates we’ve relatively low cases throughout pandemic. way see it, Idaho's basically part Deep South.  isn't. subs overwhelmingly support. air force subs even bans immediately antivax comments. vaccine shortage.

Lol try saying countries stuck 20-30% vaccination levels supply shortage. Getting third shot equivalent drinking Frappucino others go hungry. No, that’s announcement required would drop. appreciate you! 29.9% apr insane jobs commitments full time. Honestly, sound panicked, fearful misinformed anti-mask/anti-vax crowd. also land locked China, beginning Pandemic nearly uncontrolled spread totally locked almost 1/2 country.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* agree with. think California makes insurance companies file salaries CEOs Department Insurance, saw CEO made pissed. School protocols work community transmission controllable. spreading like wild fire, school match community transmission, especially delta variant. I'd bet life savings see close correlation right schools COVID cases surrounding communities. mum 65 years 11 months old unvaccinated. find really hard believe there's nobody month two older thinks like country 10 million. Texas shithole state Paxton hole shit falls to, right next Abbott.

Trust me, live here. defund net intelligence department increases. Total win Yes! Say what? someone else pointed out, likely military still decided exactly they'll deal people get it. There's different ways someone 'let go', varying ramifications things like benefits. Army - reason I've heard Army limited vaccines going priority. probably put active army national guard. 

My unit pretty low totem pole priority among active kept getting line. think want make mandatory also willing provide shot.

My information may outdated. may plenty now. anyone knows, y’all think we’ll decent shape December? really thing valid medical Well FDA experts (who trust slightly redditors) agree proof vaccines ""stark drop efficacy"".

As Massachusetts data:

1. believe Massachusetts publishes data. link official government source it? someone calculating (with incorrect assumptions).
2. ""Percent cases breakthrough"" much indicator. state 100% vaccinated, cases 100% breakthrough. last year 0% breakthrough. impacted vaccinated population is, likely vaccinated get tested, effectiveness vaccines.  honorable. Less paperwork. Still denies benefits ironic defending cops defunds idiot antivaxers quit regulars /r/army support getting vaccine. Might want look around more. So…. Hurry wait? They'll probably weeks summer. Short then. 

The ones threatening resign ones (plausibly) shouldnt leo anyways. 

Weed em out.  3rd National Guard units expected fully vaccinated June 30, 2022.  real religions oppose vaccination? single one? foreign thing use . , opposite numbers?

I hospital 3 days bill insurance $12,000 literally laying room getting 5 bags IV antibiotics  I'd imagine Guard Reserve units 19-year-old idiots reduce performance. PLus mask. Probably not, even we're military, we're redditors means us least lean left pro-vaccine. There's little drama, mostly exasperation unique way military handles things like this.

The people posting anti-vax sentiments tend regular posters subs, generally downvoted hole darker ex-wife's heart. don’t know much hospital, generate profit surgeries quick stays. 

Judging looks it, action volume hospital used to. yeah, maybe drumming business covid = reimbursement. 

Although I’m sure covid hospitalizations sort exception this, criteria exclude hospital incidents patient stay eligible reimbursed Medicare, like pressure ulcers, falls, infections caused healthcare staff, etc.

I’m willing bet we’re giving guy much credit he’s smart enough scheme Like 40 years mRNA technology culminating phizer /moderna? literally say it’s third shot. didn’t need intentionally sneaky it.

too high odd. required, signing original documents blue ink best practice law - even color copiers, makes originals easier identify. U.S. way exclusive kind stuff, however idiocy prominent U.S. make countries seem feel less isolated justified idiocy. observe overseas--they point folks U.S. justification.  think happened wasn’t concerned since cases going didn’t seem like measures would needed anymore. fool was. Here's thing typically works:

* Commander Chief: ""All soldiers must vaccinated December 15th."" 

* Secretary Defense: ""All soldiers must vaccinated December 1st ensure meet December 15th deadline."" 

* Secretary Army: ""All soldiers must vaccinated November 1st ensure meet December 1st deadline.

* Army Chief Staff: ""All soldiers must vaccinated October 1st ensure meet November 1st deadline.""

* Division Commander: ""All soldiers must vaccinated September 1st ensure meet October 1st deadline."" 

* Brigade Commander: ""All Battalion Commanders must provide report soldiers missed September 1st vaccination deadline."" 

* Battalion Commander: ""All Company Commanders must hold formation 0900 Saturday soldiers missed September 1st vaccination deadline provide mandatory vaccination training."" 

* Company Commander: ""All soldiers must attend formation 0800 Saturday begin mandatory vaccine training 0900.

* First Sergeant: ""All soldiers must form 0700 Saturday mandatory vaccine training."" 

* Platoon Sergeant: ""All soldiers must form 0600 Saturday mandatory training."" 

* Squad Leader: ""Hey fuckfaces, formation motorpool 0500 Saturday flu shots."" So, feel like defend industry, least Personal Auto, Home, Renters insurance know. standard insurances highly regulated competitive profit margins actually low. auto, somewhere 5% - 7% total premium profit least one large company known run net loss insurance make money investments. see large insurers making hundreds millions dollars year small fraction money took paid back expenses claims. dishonorable discharge less equivalent felony conviction. That's much.

A general discharge pretty bad own. ""Other-than-honorable"" limits future options. might lose security clearance longer considered acceptable candidate good job. Yep. I'm military one buddies is. makes quite clear sold body soul US Navy.  board actually, kicking non-compliant. real goal call person comparing noncompliance shooting someone idiot. husband gets flu shot reaction every year (fever, chills, etc). nothing sore arm Covid vax. never reaction flu vaccine.

OP's post history full ""vaccine bad, covid good"" stuff. Ignore rambling, still answer question. Also, political brownie points nonsense? one making political. Vaccines mandatory military decades. reason whining Trump told Covid real No, vaccine made political. There's NEW flu vaccine made every year, whos getting worked that? Good dreaming big, pal.  Lol, getting vaccinated=murdering civilians now. Coast Guard absolutely vaccinated months. came mandatory policy like 2-ish weeks ago. couldn’t mandate wasn’t FDA approval. able get mine back like March wanted still people digging heels trying get it. point though they’re essentially waiting see bad punishment be.

Im 90% sure ill going. Defense still actually mind typhoid comes bullshit department:

* must almost definition 

* view may need vaccination

* debating confirm prior infection.

Conclusion: ""Some may die, sacrifice willing make"" Shit people falling getting shot. allergic lol, TI called even warning people allergic penicillin. guess folks air force, work combat MOS. seem touch- know anyone SOCOM currently agrees mandates? certainly don’t.    I've read, immunity looks like slightly higher mixed vaccine schedules. makes sense intuitively, training body produce broader range antibodies exposing two non-identical antigens. logic, better someone got two Moderna shots. However I'm sleepy look study now, goodnight.  LOL Navy... 🎵 Republican anything lends much credence antivaxxer sentiment. “Military doesn’t even get it! I?! Clearly it’s still trial till next June!”

Absolutely bullshit. military easiest body legally give order to. executive order categories tenuous best. Military example. 

My heart goes navy service members stuck ships unvaccinated time. vast majority going resign this. vast majority police officers marketable skills many private security jobs pay anything close police officer makes. cops making 6 figure incomes overtime California. giving this.   vaccine mandate promote unity Biden keeps droning about? people dumb- let dumb. second tell need say, tyranny. We’re strong weakest link, sure- let’s vaccinate less developed world (less 2% vaccinated) vaccine resistant strains mutate. Instead, we’re wasting time fucking people clearly change mind political brownie points. Yes, sir! touch old timer. Army comply order. I've already seen several die hard ""I'll never get vax"" people go get ordered to. comes time tell commander direct order, back quick. Throwing career away one vaccination ones required get Military stupid.   follow lawful orders meant preserve defend constitution USA

As vaccinations they're required get, ordered get Covid vaccination lawful order. ones driving political divide anti-vaxxers. probably could solve problem little stringent hiring process. disturbing number nurses actually education.  That’s own. Given heart issues myocarditis mrna history SVT got J&amp;J intent getting booster either Pfizer Moderna. 

I’d prefer efficacy Moderna I’ll wait second J&amp;J. We'll okay. Kinda like Portland okay.  fair, that's typical project management hard deadline multiple milestone meet. squad leader, chance someone may fall sick 100% fulfilled deadline given superior. situation, needs gather details, compiles report gives containment action plan superior mitigate problems requires buffer time. goes superior superiors.   not-liberal soldiers refuse follow orders particular shot. think not. get discharged military Marines mix vaccine daily crayon chow. least shots, command bring nurses give drill. don’t even leave building. 

But miss it, get voucher half day’s pay go get knocked time. Kinda nice, getting paid $100 go get vaccine. may wait little see happens... however slip I'm going feel bad. said doses getting wasted. sure thank Gov. Death Sentence runs reelection. never gave booster lol. Typhoid fun. Mmmm lava.  Essentially that's correct. Delta shown similar pattern areas. Cases numbers spike massively looks like total disaster suddenly case numbers rapidly decline. really sore arm maybe body aches day. get 5 separate shots, four five, dreading it. anthrax. soldiers [court refusing vaccine.

Something believe gets lost comparing population industrialized countries far unhealthier medically precarious median (due horrible healthcare system leaves tens millions without insurance tens millions prohibitive deductibles). love Governors f****** states people state they're saying ""it's confusing federal law says Idiot Governor fighting know do.""
Personally think point governors states need removed office held criminally liable money they're wasting deaths they've caused.   really. lot strains flu vaccine mixed year - basically got booster dose year H1N1. trivalent mix 10 years. guessing person got yearly flu vaccine past decade basically immune H1N1 flu now. mention $7.8b $5.7 paid patients stuff I’ve seen seems suggest wait week recover. mean there’s campus doctors always ask opinion.

Boosters increase immunity, necessary. waiting get mine Walgreens weeks ago, less three people came request ""booster shot"" openly, turned away. 

I exactly /u/childerolaids describes above, since indeed first Moderna shot--the two Pfizer.

There ZERO vaccines routinely give US dosed similarly Pfizer schedule expect lasting immunity. exception shingles vaccine, that's kind unusual vaccine virus that's already dormant system, pneumonia vaccine (pneumovax), already get different kind pneumonia vaccine baby. Let's break down. 


HepB- doses 0, 1, 6 months 

Polio, H flu, Pneumonia (Prevnar) DTP- four doses given 2-18 months age

Rotavirus- 3 doses 2-6 months age 

HepA- 2 doses 6 months apart

MMR- 2 doses several years apart

Varicella- 2 doses several years apart

Meningitis- 2 doses several years apart 

Tdap- several years DTP Td boosters every 10 years

HPV- doses 0, 1, 6 months 

Flu- yearly shots

Meningitis B one shot, that's literally give right kids go dorms expect immunity wane pretty quick- want get dorm living. 

That's ones think right top head I'm probably missing some. theme clear. expect lasting immunity vaccine schedule like Pfizer's (2 doses 3 weeks apart). dose 6 months makes sense everything know vaccine schedules. Barbados early months 2020 Government took abandoned US Military facility outfitted isolation treatment centre Covid19. People thought overreacting, boy people wrong. Govt said would treating Covid19 ONE hospital island, would kept 'regular' emergency services, maternity services etc. way hospital could continue function, risk much contamination spread among already sick people.

When test positive here, go mandatory government isolation facility looked specialists 24/7 wether symptomatic. free, might add. *have* sounds better. implicitly *1 500* means **more** one. think thinking *one* *five hundred*. don’t care personal situation, job - hospital function. Redditors gloat workers leaving jobs, real life people left deal consequences. like expectant mothers scramble adjust sudden change. numbers work still seem possible somehow. Sad almost entirely avoidable. fiancee leave conspiracy theory nutter? Talk red flags.  No, think virus become pathogenic. likely become less pathogenic time (decades). Ebolavirus transmit well did, would likely become far less pathogenic time adapts host. Eventually everyone infected SARS-CoV-2, whether vaccinated. deaths unvaccinated. forget. whole point help sort thing *and buy time vaccine.* us stick plan are, large, alright.

I doubt unvaccinated masses filling hospitals ""forgot"" anything either. probably never program - picture price refusing mask distance *stay home* last summer.

a quick primer one many said, one vaccine shot seems compound natural immunity best immunity available right now. anyone prior infection get vaccinated too. Prof Crotty is/was discussing issue twitter day.

As now, looks like best immunity one acquire 

1. Prior infection + least 1 mRNA
2. adenovirus vector (J&amp;J Oxford) followed 1 mRNA (preferably Moderna)
3. 2 shots Moderna
4. Pfizer
5. J&amp;J/Oxford etc

Prior infection induced immunity caveat, one actually go virus, one wants dealing deadly virus. Vaccines many times safer answer. late August, Trump told die-hard supporters rally get vaccine, booed.

Great, gotta wear masks there, too? /s Thanks, good hear. think I'm going follow regime, matter timing last Pfizer.   Hi Vincent im Longtime listener (addict) TWIV. Checking Burbs Pittsburgh Slightly overcast currently 78f , 25.5c 

Hypothetically wife share rapid antigen tests?

Hear out…

We aren’t rich we’ve got funds. bought bunch binexnow tests. vaccinated vaccinated vulnerable people interact regularly. work house around others full time. one around us wears masks. 

My wife sleep bed, swap spit, stuff together (wink wink).  Pretty much germs mine vice versa. says doesn’t care long gets use swab first (lol).  double could test basically twice week kicks (or response local uptick). would give us heads visit in-laws. 

I don’t really feel need yet anticipating surge weeks weather pushes us inside (early-mid November?)

I can’t think scientific reason won’t work. pool testing throw positive would take subsequent tests individually hone results down.

Where $.75 lick sticks?  I’d use them.  culture vaccine covid military? Hi Dr.

Do think we'll see even strange new symptoms virus? example reports Pink eye possible symptom virus true?  need new compact, new social contract patients hospitals, prioritises serving patients followed public health guidelines, mandates minimum reserved capacity non covid patients vaccinated. would not?  tracking positive tests. hospitalizations stat. read NY Times article published CDC?  death counts probably undercounted, would assume 10-20%, leaves florida possibly worst state union. 

Imagine vaccine rollout earlier year, death count could easily double. governance leadership. society itself. Look places handled better, like Japan. Nobody cares government says. common person understood beginning time everyone wear masks public, wash hands alcohol, take various precautions, getting life. Japan never lockdown whole pandemic, trains Tokyo still crowded, everyone's bit keep spreading. anything, people tell government do, way around. societal issue, leadership issue. common sense issue. Americans simply common sense feel ""freedom"" threatened something simple wearing mask getting vaccinated. still adolescent nation. Lol, joined '99. Nobody (around me) saw war coming. Piece cake...

Now realize 9/11, we'd still found war. simply look statistics people tested positive vs corona deaths:

682,400 deaths/42,293,049 cases / = 1,6% (source: worldometer) 

However statistics skewed age. 75 like 10-15%, 40 coworker might almost correct. trick play numbers see number fit agenda, virus care.  mean players subjected weekly testing unvaxxed players like forced follow Covid protocols last season. 

Fans luxury kind comparing apples oranges particular case.

But agree there's definitely irony whole situation done unvaccinated covid patients intensive care? hear lot people talking removing care intubated anti-vaxxers free beds patients. know whether scheme could done legally. Instead, seems like path triage hospital system starts collapsing case load. everyone knows 500 people? mean, I’m sure do, people outside 10 immediate, don’t know would hear bad covid experience. Especially family covid deniers. know couple people “sick unspecified disease” family anti-maskers / anti-vaxers

I also don’t know many old people. boss three church members die elderly last Thursday. 3 intubated / ICU

Suspect republican / church member I’d know lot people tough time covid virus run bodies infect, whether vaccine naturally immunity. Antibodies aren’t protection, cells memories virus produce antibodies second. There’s reason believe fall/winter anything like last year. fuck? 

We actually citizen's ID. live America can't track people's information... Formerly worked JAG:

You got things right. However, can’t medically separated OTH service characterization. happen administrative separation worse. 

These guys likely admin sepped disobeying orders given either general discharge OTH. hope it’s OTH. Interesting. actually see somewhere QR code used, since information stored? external company potentially track saving QR-code? reading comment sweet irony - reason licenses revoked nursing requires license  happens army that's span?

About 65% military already vaccinated.

~~I know vaccine Army available them, Air Force Moderna, that's 28 days shots.~~ Pfizer since one approved. really change logistics.

There's 14 weeks 15th. There's 35% Army needs get shots (might slightly different number military Army might lower Marine Corps is).

It's two shots looking effectively 70% force (2 x 35%) 2 days. 14 weeks correspond 70 business days. give shot 1% force business day looking ever 2% force. (and that's really 2% 3 days week: Wed, Thurs, Fri) That's much that's like overly protective. people still jobs. still come least somewhat productive.  that's without bothering stack shots Friday. Army concerned people jobs, they'll make everyone sacrifice weekend side effects Monday good go.

My point perspective worried side effects taking force down, 3 months enough time. compress much still issues.

There might issue getting shots available, would surprising. like (the military) know coming, weeks secure shots vaccine lines get shots done. Yeah, lot local US news services webpages available EU set websites comply EU's data privacy protection guidelines Odds someone immediate family lost acquaintance  long employees foot daily cost test, sure problem  recently article linked me. general agree idea allowing natural immunity complicates issue, opens door people get COVID purpose, gives mistrust vaccine extra credibility.

People respect vaccinated stated, “if vaccine 100% safe, hasn’t US government required it?” Biden’s recent position change makes comfortable. think value.

Overall, individual able chooses vaccinated virus, think that’s fine. Policies stay everyone vaccinated however.

Does anyone information part article? one part provides insight potential downsides getting large study UK another surveyed people internationally found people history SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced greater rates side effects vaccination. Among 2000 people completed online survey vaccination, history covid-19 56% likely experience severe side effect required hospital care.

There’s another part section talks second dose vaccine even potentially lowering immune system. there? Anecdotally, know people COVID got vaccine adverse reactions second dose. northeast, people getting vaccine (poor, Bronx) ones got hit hardest first two waves. There’s lot natural immunity play, appears protect Delta part.

Nice know international thing. Totally relatable Canadian military. Southern Hemisphere gets flu season 1st wait see strains circulating make ours. Nothing happens around fella surprises I'm even US. upside, absolutely.

The downside disaffected ex-military member, likely already many extremist beliefs, gets cry ""I'm victim!"" get recruited radicalized even more. want find insurrectionists within ranks there's likely better test Summary 
Since Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), understanding regarding pathophysiology clinical manifestations disease improving. However, still limited data long-term effects lingering symptoms post COVID-19 recovery. Despite predilection COVID-19 lungs, multiple extra-pulmonary manifestations appear multiple organs biological systems continued infection recovery worldwide. necessary clinicians provide patients previous SARS-CoV-2 infection expectations long-term effects recovery COVID-19. Herein, review long-term impact COVID-19 different organ systems reported different clinical studies. Understanding risk factors signs symptoms long-term consequences recovery COVID-19 allow proper follow-up management disease post recovery.  Huh? Don’t forget many states aren’t publishing Covid data like used to. also gotten rid lot testing sites, finding test extremely difficult areas. positivity rate state (GA) 19%…..close rationing tests beginning. FL hiding deaths, cases, ton states. lot data skewed. - need court-martialed first presume every nation industrial interest fought vaccine war?  - US going impact ""anti-everything"" crowd. PROUD ignorant 250 500 US residents believes die gunshot wound old age, Fauci call covid. 

If say overall deaths increased year year, 250 500 americans call depression related depressed immunity due locked down. worked bedside critical care nurse Covid ICU Jan 2020 August 2021. tend lurker usually feel like getting internet arguments nope...you're wrong. study referenced pulled data approximately month half early pandemic last year. 

So, start authors point introduction that: ""Although experience COVID-19 continues grow, reported mortality rates range 50 97% requiring mechanical ventilation (1–6)."" areas cited articles primarily Washington state, New York, China (because time that's data from). study referenced pulled data Atlanta: ""observational cohort study patients COVID-19 admitted six COVID-designated ICUs three Emory Healthcare acute-care hospitals Atlanta, Georgia, March 6, 2020, April 17, 2020."" south heavily impacted early pandemic.

""There critical shortages medications, ventilators, dialysis machines, critical care equipment."" MAAASIVE thing include methods section authors. Currently encountering severe shortage trained bedside nurses throughout country many us leaving bedside various reasons (severe burnout primary one). beginning severe shortage meds equipment, let tell stressful try manage intubated sedated patient oral medications instead IV fentanyl, propofol, versed available due national shortage (happened late last year second big wave region). One colleagues went New York first big wave told ran IV pumps patients units hand calculate drip rates medications (something normally outside nursing school).

From clinical experience seen steroids useful remdesevir least seem anything detrimental patients. Proning therapy necessary lot cases, guarantee. patients improved able successfully extubated, case reached point requiring intubation, patients survive. also seen many patients extubated subsequently decompensate require re-intubation days later downgraded ICU.

Long story short outcomes may improved, evidence (either read first hand experience) mortality rate 35.7% intubated patients. Additionally, things like this, details make big difference can't take number like outdated article applies small subset general population say representative whole (what alluded to). I'm sorry, adds misinformation dangerous explained evaluated within proper contexts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Side note, searched ""ventilator covid mortality"" article first search result. Thank vaccinated.   Iirc Covid mortality rate number deaths among infected. among general population. province BC, north Washington state population 5 million people (about canadian - aboot, 2.5 million less people Washington) we’ve 1800 deaths. agree, would felt I’d told 7K would lose lives state. Curious, you? resounding evidence sways doctors say, "" yes, use iodine prevent/treat covid"". studys shown decrease viral load individuals already infected covid gargling iodine, test subjects also contracted thyroid dysfunction.

In addition, manufacturers antiseptics stated products effective prevention treatment correct grammar *is* sounds better. said curve already flattened enough, since system ""didn't collapse"" last winter. said pandemic over, people keep believing it'll work say push everything back normal regardless actual state virus.

There still probably people arguing everything fine they're part flatten curve system reached full collapse. Hospitals stretch things lot using surge capacity sending people locations, obviously see things overflowing. people take mean fine ""hospitals overwhelmed"" unless get Hollywood disaster movie scene literally one get hospital. Redicoulous overstepping landlord. even demand that? I'm US, surely rental protections allow thing. O'Keefe working hands found helpful. like, get ready bed, put stuff on. touch anything afterwards.

It's thick, heavy cream hands damn made huge difference me. cracked bleeding. First off, people Quarantine vax available. Second, really saying everyone get vaxxed stay home FOREVER?  So, sounds like object process result. I’m definitely sympathetic idea landlords much power landlord-tenant relationship. Yet, don’t think suitable context challenging relationship; seems less like tenant-landlord conflict like tenant-tenant conflict me, one landlord sided majority tenants employees. opinion, correct decision, reasons 3rd answer last comment. Ideally, landlord wouldn’t absolute power mediation, context, don’t object using way, since using won’t change balance power. Looking state's nearly 30,000 person death toll(and we've better handle lots others, well)...yeah, mean, 7000 pretty good - WA pretty decently populated state too. 

It's insane numb become numbers. told December 2019 coronavirus gonna fuck things irreparably years kill 30,000+ people state people really give shit it, probably believed it. prescribed doctors help Covid symptoms.

It may prescribed random whackos, current best information provides benefits whatsoever There’s misunderstanding Ivermectin amongst us Liberals well.

Yeah, obviously. would say bye indoor dining forever? bubble boy shit second hand smoking thing? actually think probably centered clusters you’d expect. 

Like plenty conservatives family, none even remotely far gone enough fall anti-vax/-mask nonsense. two frail grandparents 90s weathered pandemic result.

I could see plenty families either genetic conditions cause comorbidities social conditions cause comorbidities throughout entire family. Like lot members family might asthmatic obese something. combine wide spread anti-vax/-mask sentiment family could totally see families close 0 severe cases (like mine) others losing multiple members covid. one time go ER let right ahead crowded waiting room. septic bursitis elbow - staph infection close spreading rest body. even got private hospital room history MRSA skin infections assume infection caused MRSA isolate me. (Turned MRSA run mill staph bacteria). It’s bizarre especially compare coverage issue parts world. countries health passes treat recovered Covid they’re vaccinated. Ya! Everyone knows Facebook go legit medical advice. that's thing. can't catch smoking alcoholism others. ppl dying things treated selfish assholes playing russian roulette lives. 

SOMETHING done. called ""live virus vaccine"". MMR, chicken pox types.

Edit - technical term Attenuated vaccine people make correct decision based situation relevant facts instead making incorrect decision taking account future hypothetical?

The correct way democratically elected representatives pass laws requiring vaccines. individuals make decisions based perspective ""correct decision"". It’s definitive need one 8 months yet. Worst case scenario get minor cold isolate 2 weeks. reality living next years. Isn’t guy said constituents aren’t afraid dying blah blah blah something? promise there’s not. think would separate people could? Headline say pre-vaccine NJ. Southern States racing top available vaccine. think fair say 1 500 number low estimate corruption improper reporting. Pretty much every event high number deaths situation, true number deaths significantly higher confirmed count deaths. Estimates CDC public health organizations put total deaths due Covid-19 around one million, closer 1 300 1 500. hah indeed. Wish bit stricter, understand there's balance. We're middle 4th wave outbreak right now, facilities becoming maxed out. I'd like go back semblance normal. pretty normal late last year, getting 0 new cases daily while.

We also mandatory mask wearing - vaxxed not, complete lockdown curfew. still curfew 9pm 5am. 35.6% vaccinated far. U.S. donated first batch Pfizer nice them, see Joe tell said thanks. People pushing equal opportunity years, suddenly surprised less intellectually gifted individuals hold real jobs? supporter all. shut flights place new virus emerged called racist.

Imagine people thought said damn that's smart maybe slow coming here... rather say racist.
Did Trump alot stupid shit yeah let hate blind either.

I also made another point hey let's ignore one.

The numbers also getting back worse point since December January? Biden doing? taking questions?  funny people afraid eath panels years back actually ended create words actions? They're tired winning yet Well, would surprised saw number dropping… haha one got vaccinated I’m waiting giant suppository cocktail ivermectin, Hydroxychloroquine, sunlight, bleach, iodine Freedom. news dumb fuck celebrity ignorant opinion science? problem slippery slope. people make correct decision based situation relevant facts instead making incorrect decision taking account future hypothetical? came US 1985, breakthrough discovery 2005. start working BioNTech 2013. course it’s bad you. wouldn’t didn’t hurt them. Oh, great, I'm almost nine months. Get us boosters now! absolutely right. One big lessons 1918 pandemic maintaining societal trust public health authorities paramount. public longer believed public health authorities telling truth, things got really bad 1918. It’s unfortunate public health authorities making mistakes century later. Neither mutate. examining smoothness peoples' brains post-mortem! Iodine next one they’re trying, huh? propose that, cases person chooses go unvaccinated gets badly sick, interview right get intubated work specifically convinced get vaccinated.

Then die charge person involuntary manslaughter. I'm dead serious, seems like there's [adequate case support this. “recover” often means Trach PEG, bound long-term care facility. want government get involved. Instead landlords, private companies, schools, etc., make rules vaccination, need elected representatives pass laws regulate behavior. words, landlord right kick someone he/she refuse get covid vaccine. Instead, law requires tenants get vaccinated rent house. outcome might same, process completely different. 

If allow landlord, private business, university decide live, work, go school, based values beliefs, almost certainly end one day landlord, businesses, schools, different values beliefs ours. what? 

The right way demand democratically elected representatives pass laws vaccinations. representatives elected people, legitimacy make decisions behalf. facts hit nail head. Basically none exists hoax point land ICU might die. *Then* they'll take whatever get hands on.  I’m trying flippant figure (7,000 still 7,000), considering WA first reported cases US, think pretty good far (I’m Vancouver WA) might slightly poor taste, saw faces kid father initially mistook movie actors. 

Its good news kid survived excruciating ordeal many people lucky, yet antivax morons literally protesting outside hospitals now. csn imagine getting imvites covid parties solution oh wise one? neat, clean copy. ads distractions J&amp;J. Post want ad: ""Prayer warriors needed!""  morons can’t comprehend. hospitals handle COVID doesn’t mean rest hospital continue handle things that’s used COVID patients want to, fine. make me. Even directly correlated IQ, else new? 10% population IQ sub 85 pretty much unable create value even simple jobs even serve canon-fodder military. want do? Start forcing mental hospitals sedate like used anyone mental limitations? people get breakthrough cases? resistant variants reinfection?  attitude vaccine stops catching spreading Covid. doesn’t. Tennessee one triplets. Tennessee, Mississippi Florida. siblings pretty much southern states far know 1 500 Americans died, number keeps increasing, especially hospitals unavailable keep people *alive*. makes sense. ""all attendees aged 12+"" I'm constantly amazed. Bleach, horse de-wormer, this.

Wouldn't simpler FDA approved injection. point exactly, think might misunderstood me. resources inflexible would unrelated procedures, elective surgeries, wait times extended? allocate capped portion ICU beds covid allow heart attack/ladder folk receive care. covid numbers pass cap, infected either choice stay inside. go out, consider rationalising enforcement measures tickets public endangerment breaching public health order.
Using rapid testing, rather passports, certain indoor establishments, we'd know antibodies, allow contact tracing. incorrect saying doctors would prescribing ivermectin covid. Everything around true. Yes, drug called ivermectin humans. yes used treat certain infections... NO. covid-19 heart big totally feel wanting wear one day long. sit mountain privilege wear mask day (I work home). Stay safe there. Honestly, would sue passed this. absolutely reason hospitals turning away regular patients prioritizing people don’t basic decency protect community. would livid! actually want know recall Trump kissing ass. think reason got elected able fly radar. much record, hope loses next election. Piece shit.  think don’t spread Covid know it? Proof COVID-19 vaccination required indoor bars, wineries, breweries, nightclubs lounges Los Angeles County forthcoming health order one official said help armor region another coronavirus mandate also apply employees establishments require patrons least one vaccine dose Oct. 7 fully vaccinated Nov. 4, Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer announced Wednesday’s Board Supervisors new order, participants workers outdoor “mega events” 10,000 attendees also need provide proof vaccination show they’ve recently tested negative coronavirus infection. requirement already place indoor events least 1,000 people present. IHME excess deaths million already hit excess  evangelists seem interpret way anyway Unbelievably tragic. advice couples pregnant, already deciding whether get vaccinated back spring back pregnancy vax big mystery somewhat controversial. wife really struggled whether get vaccinated. pro vax unsure impacts pregnancy/fetus. Ultimately knew couldn’t wrap bubble entire pregnancy decided get vaxxed. retrospect, glad health (pregnant women 5x likely severe health issues covid unvaxxed) also glad (in theory) protect baby passing along vaccine antibodies.

All said, want get vaccinated pregnant, ok. please make sure vaccinated order reduce risk profile least ONE stands great chance alive baby perhaps kids. second, you’re unvaxxed pregnant, please take care make sure around taking care well. could listed several states think everyone already knows list. sad.

Are getting tested symptomatic? getting tested exposed? feel like there’s bigger reason get tested school session. can’t say kids exposed, abs get testing done people may done summer… also seeing activities kids doing.. Thank kindly. Governors done great job enabled sadly. thought. Riding bus winter gross matter what, masks scratched certain itch able identify pandemic. need find someone staff them. could increase resources needed increase number bedrooms what?   still can’t find decent apartment Maybe... maybe, Removing covid restrictions, mask reduced capacity pretending pandemic smartest choice. 

Like.. reduced ability get tested contact tracing pretending life back normal would treat like flu.. vast majority population vaccinated aren't.

Manitoba went 3rd wave react happened even though provinces going worst wave month them.

Finally. Manitoba brought back mask mandates, re-implemented vaccine requirements events, gyms, church, weddings eating inside outside 85+% 12+ one dose 80% doses. month ago number still low, climbed communities 25% vaccine uptake Winnipeg (city 850000) 10-20 cases per day.

Literally Alberta removed every precaution surrounding Covid, one wears mask shocked covid overwhelming also one lowest vaccinations country. 

They fucked. There’s show BBC called Ambulance follow paramedics front line Liverpool. episodes currently airing back January/February really peaked UK. Yeah vaccine programme really started take effect it’s absolutely bleak watching. They’re working unbelievably hard can’t keep demand Covid normal ill health issues. 

It really shows much try avoid putting others risk. That’s .2%!!!! (/s obviously, that’s something I’ve heard people say) need recognize they'll scream bloody murder start shooting hospitals

Povodine-iodine used decades gargle upper respiratory tract infections. Personally, used decade get sore throat assists preventing infection creeping lower respiratory tract. Prior using (recommended specialist Drs) would develop bronchitis several times year. is, cannot remember last bronchitis. 

Obviously, long term use cause severe issues associated iodine poisoning. good  Relax bud, still fully vaccinated. every intentionally non vaccinated covid patient hospital waiting room manslaughter. excuses point. Regardless whether current infection, antibodies, grouped people infection, previously infection, vaccination. anti-bodies would separated. conventional quarantine procedure. Assuming anti-bodies current infection, better fighting infection someone without anti-bodies. Yes amount antibodies varies person person, like recommended T-cell levels, take average existing survivor data. Anyone 1-2 dose regimen, 3rd booster, taking additional series (pfizer plus one sinovac/sinopharm/sputnik vaccines) get around travel immigration restriction, experiences contracted covid even 3-4 shots? 

Not discuss merits got additional shots, wondered measurable difference symptoms, severity, even frequency still contracted multiple doses multiple types vaccines. understand selfish idiots getting prioritized everyone else. makes physically sick.   Fair enough. mean nitpick this. Definitely judgement you. One time bad cough fever, doc told go straight ER. Instead waited days go exhaustion money fear, went finally pneumonia. Took weeks get fully better, kicking whole time waiting long. understand thinking.    several risk factors make high risk. I'm technically immune compromised, take several medications ""immune modulators."" second Pfizer dose January. work hospital we're seeing covid admits, many vaccinated. want third dose asap. There's never magic arbitrary safe distance backed science. study wild type delta. “Observational cohort study patients admitted March 6, 2020, April 17, 2020.”

“ patients admitted hospital laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 May 19, 2020.” would thought?  say give unvaccinated want declare legal outlaws Good luck that. Housing city time high, median time market 48 hours. Yet there's 17.6% vacancy rate. 


And middle city, large single family homes. hospitals setting resources aside used non-vaccinated COVID cases? one taking proper precautions die people taking dangerous risks using hospital resources. even close thing lol.

Thats like saying house always capacity 3 people family house 3 bedrooms.  live nyc last year repeating words constantly. son clumsy AF. terrified I’d take ER. heard sirens day night. wanted wrap bubble wrap. worry middle school he’s still young vaccinated. :( That’s consensus /r/nursing threads. patients take lot care.  covid patient us 73 days. 

He got it. Stayed general medical oxygen. Upgraded ICU. Intubated TWICE. Went back general medical. 

Went home day. Came back us general medical again. telemetry due blood clots due Covid. 


He likely oxygen rest life. 

And hospital bill last time talked 2 million range.

All cause want get vaccine. inaccurate. Alberta second highest proportion irreligious people province (next BC). Proportionally cursory glance, gun ownership fourth highest country, three provinces (Ontario, Quebec, BC) equally loud.

Alberta certainly problems, rural areas fucking wild, inaccurate say ""basically Texas"". ♥️✌🏻 don’t think subjective opinion proof someone’s talents lack of.

Sending positive thoughts way mom. 🙏 There’s misunderstanding Ivermectin amongst us Liberals well

Is though? Ivermectin great drug worms, lice mites.

Oh yes always listen celebrities even finish high school renowned doctors. Please explain depth vaccinated people walking around runny noses problem I’ve heard pass antibodies newborn breast milk well. I’m hoping that. I’m living different country state live virtually covid-free (we’ve total 7 deaths population 5.2 million). currently 29 active cases - 19 hospital rest home hotel quarantine. I’m nearly due aren’t looking let covid state get 80% double dose, due date. risk getting covid pregnant close zero get (my obstetrician director obstetrics hospital agrees decision). soon bub I’ll getting vaccine husband already vaccinated. risk different lived anywhere US would making difference choice.

I got new health insurance new job, even started looking new GP yet know go in, even get appointment things calm down.

I'm looking 100,000 mile check up, I'm trying risk life it. Make non vaccinated covid patients low priority.   go get free vaccine cures sightly chubby, sign up. know. many people tried fat. 

So many cancer deaths could prevented everyone vegan too!

You could literally cure death genius ideas. US CDC advice get 2nd dose; circumstances recommend restarting 2-dose sequence waited long.

See: That’s it, vulnerable creeping time may crucial get booster. Antibody level correlated level sterilizing immunity. I’d rather body go adaptive response make antibodies.  I’d rather high circulating antibodies neutralize virus immediately. understand trying “follow science” yeah, somebody like I’m good Moderna shots awhile 79 year old grandmother COPD doesn’t know what’s going third shot desperately wants. haven’t made available (or clear will) 65 crowd KNOW need booster account post-vaccination hospitalizations absolutely ridiculous. people don’t trust government don’t even bother listen No, non mentally ill people simply realize permanently swearing something humans done hundreds years pandemic (that end) prevent EVER getting sick ridiculous. SMOKERS! OVERDOSE CASES! get any?   think said yourself. Fifth word. Sure will. 
Just keep shot records safe place. Also booster becomes available, hopefully record keeping improve online records   I'm hoping start adding vaccines horse paste.

Much? small pox vaccine. anthrax vaccine. Even deploying Coastie mandated these. Yeah, misunderstand, I'm trying defend decision. dumb dangerous. curious there's it. hope happens! Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* tell exactly many deaths followed vaccination. tell nothing many caused vaccination.

This. Also, almost anyone file report VAERS. I'm getting tired ""the vaccine killed 7,000 people that's ones know about"" nonsense social media link VAERS offered proof.  Maybe applied PPP loan Republicans instituted power. Oh wait, went big businesses cahoots them. people still make 92% covid hospitalizations.

This depends where, useful statistic give without context. ""Still"" implies recent data, think recent percentages July August high.

A [CDC indeed 92% hospitalizations among unvaccinated (really fully vaccinated, including missed second dose). 

However, CDC report includes two periods observation, April 4–June 19 June 20–July 17, 2021. hospitalizations report earlier period.

During June 20-July 17 period, unvaccinated people made 86% hospitalizations. 

That CDC report cites [COVID-NET finding substantial growing proportion hospitalized persons fully vaccinated surprising; proportion hospitalized cases fully vaccinated expected increase population vaccination coverage increases. Given high vaccination coverage, particularly older age groups, 80% July ≥65 years,2 finding 16% hospitalized cases ≥18 years month fully vaccinated consistent would expect highly effective vaccines.

That data suggests July, 84% covid hospitalizations among unvaccinated. wasn’t going sue you… never say that. got third shot Rite Aid without lie all. pharmacist asked “this first Moderna shot?” said yes first Moderna shot. said I’d come back four weeks said “I understand”.  Bingo. That’s key. Everyone page.  even people legit medical reason get vaccinated.

I'm convinced people.

And even - sorry, global pandemic, everyone make sacrifices. Maybe 0.001% population talking make slightly larger sacrifice. Sorry, life's perfectly fair, can't let perfect enemy good. vaccinated ppl less likely occupy hospital beds take oxygen tanks. that’s misinformation. spreading dangerous misinformation. Carlson pushed way front line - ain't dumb.   Can’t stab brain head empty. Lol, Texas think main purpose make things inconvenient unvaccinated, help motivate fence-sitters get vaccinated. terms actual ability contain spread virus, doubt measures much, especially given masks still required everyone. Central Valley hospitals getting full. Us coast metro areas afraid spill areas point ICUs get full get care need non-covid related medical problems. Speaking someone country masks mandated virtually nobody made fuss, genuinely fail see wearing mask become massive issue. science clear mask wearing along distancing works. Yeah right on. wish pushed media. lot people scared come fast really awesome know nothing actually compromised process. Except guess drugs approvals slowed down. agree, especially discrimination immune unvaccinated people certainly work best antivaxxers.

*""You see? want force-vaccinate even immune, want inject us micro robots control minds satellite!""*  first time Portuguese noticed months age category, ""fully vaccinated"" group lagged ""one shot"" group \~10%.

So, hospitals collapse patients default bills? expect huge hospital bailout future? have. army, loads shots things like Yellow fever, Typhoid etc... pills malaria... one batted eyelid...or got sick. 20 years ago, West went mad. boggles mind.

Absolutely baffling stuff. think America needs pay trillions dollars worth debt first, no? Wtf…someone like deserve medal. would given /r/TheyDidntDoTheMath Usual disclaimer; vaccinated, too.

Oh soldiers leave army, guess we’ll cut military budget oh find weird much people want boosters. confident title instead read ""Vaccines proven 0 efficacy 6 months, boosters mandatory"" people would much happier.

The opinions paper celebrated: vaccines work well need boosters. That's amazing.

And completely agree you. boosters proven necessary, sad vaccines lose effectiveness time, get shot recommend others. That's exactly happened WWI.

Sabres team fully vaxxed too.  extremely likely full culture war conservatives willing literally drink Betadine avoid getting vaccine disparity likely grown much, much larger. baby die. case want read kid might die. Ummm, someone remind party pro-local control anti-big government? 

Anyone? Listen, us Kentuckians voted Democratic Governor fought tooth nail right thing kneecapped idiot attorney general state legislature. “Reap sew” win hearts minds hurting Kentuckians. “Reap sew” isn’t Georgia flip senate. Kentucky purple people realize, people always vote people make feel heard. “Reap sew” mentality condemning real people death, it’s also going keep people like Mitch Rand senate. Moderna, stronger Pfizer. Hmm. strictly financial terms, arguably point vaccine pays off. Within year rollout really fast return investment. imagine hospital costs saved mount much faster vaccination costs gets better here. Awesome, I'm going start collecting news like r/mRNAtech, exciting things built, including trials HIV vaccine cancer cures. Ok, firstly, article makes claims, BUT, also admits clinical trials test true efficacy virucidal oral gargles. suggest using either 1.5% hydrogen peroxide 0.5% PVP-I.

Thanks helpful explanation -- read carefully enough first time around. districts recorded 28,000 COVID-19 cases since school year began last month

The case difference drastically different [San Francisco 's first month was. Vaccineses work! mean dependas need get ""jab"" also ? know toughest job military. Moderna kicked ass second dose

Now think worst ass kicking two weeks actually spreading covid family?

For me, got second next day felt like death. Slept day day like nothing happened. DoD’s current vaccination rate?  Finding hospital's bio Larry Gray, old enough *required* 100% childhood vaccinations proven effective hired.

I'm 57, hired hospital 1994. vaccine card, blood tests show immunity, roll damn sleeve find door!

edit: worked office part hospital, never patient contact, ever. Still fully vaccinated. People need remember ""olden"" times, stopped passing measles/mumps/polio *because vaccines!* perhaps. Young guys pension claim yet. Fuck em. New Zealand forced active soldiers months ago, although NZ military manning quarantine facilities.

There's currently lawsuit soldiers refused either taken duty, discharged. kick people non-compliant? become Colonel, dot lowercase i's hearts.

You talking expanding knowledge. talking PR. yeah medical exemptions written chiropractors won’t cut  git yerself gun tho seen anyone military complaining getting it, veteran still lot people military Facebook. person wrong, people met military republican issues getting vaccines. think issue blown little proportion would probably guess lot US population gotten vaccinated probably already virus recovered like half sister. Thanks. I’m relieved know sit couch, take kids car, etc,,, without worrying. u dumb? newsworthy cant make shit 🤦‍♂️ earlier post invites thought may believe COVID numbers inflated. I'm pretty sure saying that, may want amend posting.  That's probably Broadway star, Nick Cordero, contracted it. wife flew west cove together.He got it, suffered miserably,lost leg blot clot died antway.Rest peace Nick! Getting medically separated Instead retiring would highly suck. You’d get separation pay, it’s taxable. get VA disability benefits separation, don’t pay you’ve paid back separation pay. since didn’t retire, don’t get pension. you’re medically retired, get higher VA disability retirement rating….not both, you’re retired disabled.  fun half military quits there’s legit coup attempts. don’t understand logic burning military members- lean conservative. Thus, would suddenly discharged shit discharge would make future employment prospects suffer.

Can’t tell you’re troll really didn’t think through. Well now, lets rush anything children. like large amount saying FDA already approved EUA 5-11 year-olds anything like that. definitely trust FDA research came sound conclusion delaying trials worth kids ended getting COVID schools (and ancillary spread parents beyond). I'm sure parents kids ended hospitalized delta mind since risk approving already could disaster. Science changes, guy. Virologists stay 3 steps ahead we're following blindly. Why? believing science understanding shit written stone. I'm witnessing echochamber impatient people and/or patients understanding shit changes rapidly adept. looks like we're kicking road, far it.

Do numbers immunocompromised?

You realize zero COVID impossible, right? got vaccinated didn’t concerned anymore. Probably dumb question size pfizers dose compared moderna? I'm assuming much larger dose they're considering halve dishonorabled people refused anthrax vaccines. Since then, handful folks gotten discharges upgraded, like, small handful.

Plus things month long training, like mountain warfare training center things like that. People love making crazy comments without knowing anything they're talking about. Units monitor troops, military works top-down individual decisions. unit leader says need get shot today, UCMJ allow subordinate say lawful command u patent argument stale all. Bill Gates made fortune suing people stealing ideas. wealth came patents he's done little way philanthropy. 

Bill Gates could afford supply 3-6 months worth vaccines proper distribution pocket, he's it. Gates afford storage labor it. chooses to. He's invested this.

Shareholder greed medicine stuck things at. 

Maybe arguments relevant much patents real logistics supply. can't produce vaccines fast enough rest world. 

I difficult time turning cheek folks like Gates. He's done good, shareholdings disgusting.  Flu season must’ve doozy. Covid SARS, studied ~10 years. huge head start SARS vaccine, tweaking Covid variant didn’t take long.  Hey problem Laughable. all.

however start trying understand hard many people.

Even ignore politics , countries, still lot anti vaxxers. 

Perhaps stress last 18 months especially economically lot people rejecting mask vaccine mind could coping mechanism deny everything blame something ( libs /5g whatever). 

This aspect pandemic studied become hard . Could someone knowledgeable vaccines help understand... spike protein expressed cells immune system attack cells?  understand... way emphasizing fact overdue. Thank much explaining us military big tho. Super helpful.  You’re never around children immune compromised people? would even know you’re never around them? don’t wear signs. deal fact you’re selfish. questioning methodology number significant digits making skeptical math  reservists? national guard? thing? Insulting say “active duty”. Way weekend warriors AD. probably say “current Army” “current military”. AD tiny part US forces. comment stating older Americans vaccine hesitant. Whether two doses needed different statement willingness get vaccinated. One dose likely keep 10% didn’t get 2nd shot group morgue.  Officers Creed

You point “brass” Army swear oath constitution United States. note POTUS absent officer oath. non-commissioned officers swear oath POTUS officers appointed them. still seem bothered didn’t recommend masks start pandemic. middle-aged live central FL lots COVID ICU beds.

I think key thing. I'm fully vaccinated. cases low hospitals fine? Sure, going problem. 

My tiny town 13,000 99 cases last Friday Monday. Another 36 today. That's rate 752 per 100k weekend, another 273 per 100k today. Today also fairly low day compared last week--one days 105 translates 798 per 100k single day.

My local hospital grand total 4 ICU beds. According family friend works there, better hope need one full, spent close 8 hours calling tens hospitals transfers around state nearby states keep told full beds available.    problem we're seeing science subject political pressure. Combination things see mean: looks like delta higher hospitalization potentially higher mortality rate. California likely got first vaccination rates solid key areas plus increased mitigation measures think forgot /s Well, unvaccinated, going likely contract disease, become symptomatic thus much transmissable. lead deaths. So, would say comparable.  hospitalized? know diabetes sickness shortness breath go recovered? cycle ALOT biggest fear getting covid able exercise interpreted sentiment mean getting vaccine military establishment guess that's easy enough too. can't get thing work phone, think find information fact even news laughable. think would happen group people literally waive personal freedoms away become part unified force? bait people disagree with? went one Astoria Saturday checked vax card ID. Yo I'm going tomorrow assuming PCR test today come back positive! excited. Yeah, there's nothing that. plenty booster people need rather let doses go waste.  40% we're waiting around get fully vaccinated going get vaccinated. Don’t thank Army, thank recruiter. accurate thing Army ever read. step missing yelling private snuffy to, “Sounding-off” accountability. Oh look. Another person understand federal government operates. I'd hard time believing *any* military personnel ""walked job.""

Military really option.  can't remotely? would save lot jet fuel. sister Type 1 diabetic got 2nd moderna shot late February. caught delta variant late September year. 3 days feeling shitty, aches, 102 fever, shortness breath. kicked ass good thankfully fully recovered. fall? Dead leg, much pain? That's pretty much million US (myself included) decided. keep flip flopping people need booster, meanwhile breakthrough infections keep occurring. initial data, data Pfizer/Moderna booster trials seems indicate protection drops good bit 6/8 months, getting third shot restores also increases 5-20x past peak occurred second shot (referring number antibodies/neutralizing titers increased). 

Ultimately one cares health, that's decision person make.  There's enough vaccines thrown people taking first place feel like somehow taking one someone else getting it. Same. Honestly dlubts hard find credible sources information vaccine providing stay away Facebook crowd. I'll admit part slight hesitancy back December mainly get vaccine quick. knew Facebook give trustworthy information went online find out. Low behold found plenty trustworthy sources could get vaccine quick worries pretty much went away immediately. Agreed.  Also, sure police required much training maintain level fitness would required army. police forces allowed get military style equipment waging war bar always set pretty low entry requirements. delta variant still infect me, infect children aren’t vaccinated. Sorry non-existent rights specific job lower priority list children. tradition old America like every fucking drill. remember corpsman losing paperwork one month get pricked next damn month. trolling, probably difference opinion. 

We used able those. 

Cognitive dissonance real thing. Sorry bud. sounds like garbage. Seriously. Reservists full time jobs/school like normal person civilian side. people still find way get things done do, 0 excuse mandate extended way June them. Considering land border still closed nonessential travel Canada, there’s population base larger Buffalo directly west unable easily attend games. reason insurance companies want pay anything that's whole point profiteering scam saving money caring troops. maintaining fit, effective, lethal fighting force. 

""Plz get fucked"" - clearly stand-up guy.   Well except I'll bet better accuracy know who. want go ""okay to"" mean health seem like anyone solid answer. take hands point. 100 people pay company $1,000 year future health coverage

I got Pfizer first shot Moderna second Sweden since travel lot work got two shots two different regions.

The doctor vaccination center give OK since know Moderna day booked time. actually said ""Hey, i've even seen get better protection mix"" thought reading this! studies show natural immunity + vaccine better natural immunity.

Can help understand CDC data relying on? clicked link recent week see 0-4 age group, 2.2 cases per **100,000 population.** say ""per 100,000 **infections**,"" notice.

Does mean CDC data saying children, 2.2 100,000 get hospitalized? words, ""the number hospitalized"" per ""the entire population children US""?

If case, obvious difference AAP data. AAP's number report NUMBER HOSPITALIZED PER NUMBER INFECTIONS.

So looks like CDC data relying may telling absolute chance kid hospitalized covid, whereas AAP data telling chance kid hospitalized kid catches covid. ""it's going grow rapidly coming days,"" None. Zero.

Agreed, point moreso think stats useful even Alg 2 mandatory course take lieu algebra. least include statistics curriculum necessarily going college. Unfortunately recently got covid (even though vaccinated Pfizer vaccine three times followed country's guidelines staying safe). I'm currently quarantining feel better, question flying abroad longer covid.

Im asking plans meet friends London around end November would really unfortunate cancel plans I'd gotten Covid two months that.

I would call poison control maybe pediatrician tell concerns, perhaps?

I don’t lot answers you. :( Thats pretty much case FDA saying. breakthrough fine long minor. I'm sure I'm agreeance there. 

It's tough argument either way. headline makes believe FDA approve. headline would represent article better stated “the FDA declines comment booster data reviewing conclusions September 17th” truly living stupidest times  Maybe government stopped paying unvaccinated, unvaccinated got 6 figure bill mail, they'd tell friends family might convince get vaccinated. may dumb fuck bummed didn’t get Pfizer. wanted extra .9% efficacy rate LOL feel much better now! ia logical answer maintain single precise value R real world unstable solution?

Is coronavirus virus R = 1 empirically demonstrated anywhere?

And mechanism R tuned precisely 1 lower? said once, receive accolades crowd expected (the opposite fact) likely never say another word vaccines. Freaking hero. They're ALREADY killing people emergencies Covid related cannot get care reasonable amount time easily treatable severe illness. 

Hospitals keeping 1 ICU bed open actual emergencies covid. boy's case article, getting treated hours meant use SIX ICU bed days instead ONE. 

Hospitals never catch people die keep up. large areas US don’t care hospitals collapse. We’ve seen time time I’m sure continue. would nice behavior modified protect health care. least that’s positive think?  discharged given prescriptions horse dewormer.

I understand effective ""every three year old knows works"" guess percentage 99.5% they've rounded up. going spam shit Covid subs? Hope stampede worth it.  Unsurprising, still disappointing. still stand behind belief preventing mild covid illness still potentially crucial. Well, let's see plays then. they're banded together like that, can't. Anti-vaccine tribalism powerful enough they're minority, majority position, forget it. Even fence-sitters budge, see singled want themselves.

Not mention, even believe covid threat, course believe vaccine matters. TL;DR: FDA review data conclusions independent committee makes recommendations FDA September 17th Sweden immigrant population extremely undervaxxed compared remainder population.

Any straight forward reasons that? Legality issues? vaccines easily accessible them? plain old refusal take them? Laziness/procrastination getting vaccine? hope so. people seem expect another winter surge. Would wonderful didn’t happen. There's alot talk boosters recently think we'll need booster shot every year covid like flu?

So there's talk vaccinating kids age 12 data comes out. Given covid low risk young kids benefit vaccinating kids age 12 instead focus vaccinating adults around rest world? 

In event new variant evades current vaccines 100% need new vaccines true mRNA vaccines quickly adjusted combat new variants? ThTs people r getting boosters 99% people died retirement age lmao Covid-neinpeen also said it'll make testicles swollen. medical field, take word ANYTHING health related. feel like messaging science, government, corporation entirely ass-backwards seems leaving public dust? hell know conflicting reports daily? 

Why dealing booster stressful? helps protect person more, metrics need? Authorize 'em! accepted, though? far, vaccine mandates list ""medical religious exemptions"" acceptable, basically major religions telling people get vaccinated, normally religious exemption requires kind documentation accepted religious leader. hard information many religious exemptions actually accepted?

Split population US would cost us $24. take lesson marketing refer COVID-19 vaccines ""The Trump vaccines."" reasonably obvious political loathing Democrats clouds brain many anti-vaxxers. remind vaccine skeptics remarkably effective vaccines developed record time Trump administration.

Obviously shoot needle feared life. case numbers. /s experts almost never even want talk anything death hospitalization. bad get bed already full hospital, matter reason. many intentional avoid talking ""mild"" cases long covid infections instead bring hospitalization even ask explicitly infections AMAs. 

At least head upfront oppose boosters: want shots redirected access even first shots. agree would perfectly fine US officials that. like public health officials things like say ""masks work"" hope means need masks get them. Even also telling 70+ crowd comorbiddities need mask either. group need third shots even meet strict definition severely immunosuppressed medical diagnosis.

My old boss, parents died within one week it. Leaving wife, sister, business. They're fiercely republican, anti Vax. 

My moms friends got vax, breakthrough case. 

Several old family members. anti-vax

And couple ""friends"" I've ditched since trump took office due absolutely insane, anti-vax.

Pretty routine... got sore arm 6hr later, woke next bad headache 100.4 fever. strenuous physical work day ahead me, took painkillers tylenol knock headache fever, went work, felt fine next day. Much briefer lingering malaise Pfizer shots. 

I attribute brand change, though. really expect Pfizer Moderna differ much anything. larger mRNA dose, different lipid packaging, making spike protein. life saving vaccine. think really exemplifies disconnect FDA public health emergency currently occurring. Hospitals operating state emergency, children getting infected record amounts. question safety boosters, rather committee may think aren’t ‘necessary’, opinion based worldview reflect current emergency. infuriating said, grossly irresponsible. I'm sick revisionist history. Nobody said masks work. Doctors surgeons wear reason.

What said ""masks prevent contracting COVID"" true. prevent spreading it. That's original recommendation ""wear mask sick caring someone sick""

Then learned asymptomatic presymptomatic spread. recommendation updated ""wear mask indoors around people, even feel fine.""  evidence booster works yields strong immunity even infection.

It’s impossible use science meaningful way science denial rampant. Thanks Trump, legacy conspiracy live decades come. people lie testing tracking previous infections expensive giving vaccine ""Yes, lower rates,""

again, vs, 

1 500 people (a singular person) died. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Ban fat models protect Americans. I'm waiting coming wave lawsuits unvaccinated covid victims hog precious ICU space.  get coming from, regardless what's implied sentence, subject still singular.

A comparable example choosing verb word ""each"". ""Each"" always treated like singular noun paired singular verb. Even talking 500 people, would say ""each person **has** hat"" ""each person **have** hat"". use singular verb even though implied talking multiple people. source goes detail source example that's similar phrasing A: “one five”; “one every first number “one,” construction takes singular: “one three admitted,” “one every five achieves perfect score,” etc. Nope exact shot. Immediate separation seems nice though.

Don't places guard Arctic circle internet access running water? I've discussed elsewhere AMA. People recovered infection get one vaccine dose best immunity planet. Second dose needed. America sent doses countries country world. 100m sent already, hundreds millions way.

If take 2-3 *weeks* worth production output, that's limiting factor, boosters, that's hardly 'incredibly selfish'. better ration towards without covid vaccinated. Wow. almost like none us healthcare warning happening. data says exactly stated does… haha. assuming things changed worse? anything outcomes improved understand situation treatment better.

The statement “vast majority” patients suffer respiratory failure COVID-19, require mechanical ventilation, end dead. false statement false long No, simpleminded interpretation sucks donkey balls. Work done sorts mRNA vaccines, including influenza common cold ones. wish may day come true. Yes, mistake thank you. thinking 2022 last term since January officially ends.  sounds like cousin STD reaction vaccine. Unvaccinated nurses getting sick missing work monstrous liability.

Fun fact: fact disagree statement. study Jesse Bloom's lab shown many changes RBD change ACE2 binding - spoke TWiEVO #57. potentially changes arise, singly even combination can't predict. *Everyone* said boosters eventually likely. pharma companies, *everyone*. 

Moderna requesting authorization boosters well they're weeks behind Pfizer they're needed data they're going lower dose. misunderstanding. subject literally ONE. Yes, multiple people died COVID. That's what's debate. I'm talking grammar here. really still believe use ""have"", would mind breaking sentence show works? Medical expenses astronomical anyways for-profit institutions decided charge prices high want medical care necessity. People desperate enough treatment pay whatever cost, matter get money from. Brazil almost everyone wants get vaccine, since practically cultural around here. makes relieved somewhat. problem seen, ""patients"" continue gum works weeks. since severe, high list.

It's COVID patients days ago messing emergencies now. on. that's governor state question. choose protect class people currently homeless wanted state to. provide better care ""human rights"" (like food, clean drinking water, etc) wanted state to.

i guess made point little better. think clear governor/government florida care basic human rights Well, base personal side effects, first shot would Leonardo (calm, cool, business, leading way) second shot would Raphael (storms hot headed trashes place kicking ass). think fetal cells used current tests.

I love interpret bible say whatever want to. sure says somewhere get lots free money government pay taxes well. Great, need third dose January then... country buying vaccines, fucked Brazil Hi Dr.Racaniello,

With waning efficacy Pfizer vaccine several months, certain people medical community recommending holding booster shots aside ethical concerns lacking data? booster increase protection infection? I’ve lucky. got vaccinated May get Covid last month, like bad cold fortunately. family members go around time, got last year. Nobody hospitalized, lucky. heart goes everyone fighting trying hardest stay safe everyone around them. Hopefully people still taking seriously wake realize happening. considered that, 2nd shot booster same? would assume booster shot different shot?  Unless tenant like burned place attacking residents something. no, think tenants  😂🤣
I waiting see someone actually point keep upvoting comment!
Thank you! 🙏  actually care whether people suffer.

Look hospitals find lots suffering care about. saying doesn’t exist insofar you’re suggesting conception Long Covid new emerging phenomenon actually category error, something ordinary mis-recognizing.

A great example great British Intelligence Test data shows significant prolonged objectively measured cognitive deficit baseline Covid survivors levels severity, persisted long 9 months seemed impacted time since infection.

By definition something already experiencing quasi imperceptible lingering sequela typical colds flus inherently things experience, part “baseline health” means. showing deviation baseline. kick comment section hornets’ nest, studies showing Iodine nasal throat sprays may actually effective prophylactic prevent COVID respiratory recommended health authorities Japan cold prevention, relatively safe affordable product. **This mean alternative getting vaccine. vaccine remains best tool fight COVID,** however, places world struggling get vaccinated, healthcare workers need every advantage get stay fight. may also help prevent viral particle spread infected people, would also help flatten curve.

I don’t think it’s fair treat disproven Hydroxychloroquine Ivermectin, antivaxxers latching onto latest miracle cure. article post snarky attitude makes broad unsubstantiated claims it’s useless harmful. assume it’s want steer people vaccine first, believe it’s harmful overall public health dismiss another potential tool fight COVID. know numbers, nys numbers might misleading large portion nyc vaccinated rural parts areas bring percentage down. i'd rather 80% nyc vaxxed 40% central western ny vaxxed homologous 60%. landlord first place want stealing people poorer make living know DeSantis sudden said going memory feel like looking again. say deserve die focusing efforts things help.

Yes, COVID us forever - cannot eradicated. However people immune disease much milder receive little attention. get from? injecting bleach, well shining UV light asshole think landlords forced renew leases? so, tenants face requirement? Oregon, who's outbreak problem recently, 59%.

I'm grammar purist think number 1 treated plural situation. curiosity, checked number sites seeing reported this. seems mix both. interest [this article New York originally used word ""have"" switched ""has"". He’s renewing contract people caused demonstrable harm property, staff, personal life. Seems pretty basic, I’d imagine you’d understand. whether get Covid get vaccinated Pfizer making money. :( works way ""x me"" vs ""x I"" argument.

""if questions, ask x me.""

Or

""if questions, ask x I.""

Which correct? Take ""x and"" part get answer. concept total excess deaths? Chances everyone knew people died average… Dude got Pfizer booster two moderna messsssed up. bad second moderna pretty damn close. Maybe bad took medicine sooner time. brother best immunity either recovered vaccinated people, I've noted earlier AMA. However, still infected might develop mild moderate disease - say might group people closely studied. know might transmit others. know, careful around others, especially people risk severe disease. Actually seems pretty closely aligned CDC estimates.

According paper, 522,368 excess deaths 2020. CDC 385,258 confirmed deaths Covid 2020, would correspond 1.36 Covid deaths every 1 reported death. [CDC 95% figure 1.30 1.34 Covid deaths every 1 reported death, expect excess deaths bit higher actual Covid deaths, contains causes like people dying delayed surgery access ER, slightly higher seems consistent. expecting prediction come true quickly. rename headline click baity way possible? Shareholders demand angry clicks! Sweet. Let's also deny smokers lug cancer COPD treatments. Alcoholics, liver disease treatment you! IV Drugs addicts - guys live HCV HIV - sorry. Hey Bud, you;re kooking kind chubby - hope survive4 heart attack - home.

It's ""unpopular opinion"". extremely poorly thought opinion. mindset, scale large enough make difference government operates, incredibly scary, historically speaking.

If fire crowded theater, don’t need tell people, already know. Even fire different part theater, still need inform people fire (the truth) also inform exit theater safely (also truth).

Ambulance drivers need rational calculated, true, majority speed limits set arbitrarily based sort science. would accurate say ambulance drivers need drive safely, try rush. None anything truth, whether tell not.

You're comparing two different numbers.

Granted, I’m sure medical care improved since 1960’s, yeah. true number closer one 300, given two thirds three quarters covid deaths accounted tally, high specificity, low sensitivity figure virtually guarantees undercount.

Sources:

 * [CDC: 1 1.3 (95% UI* 1.30 – 1.34) COVID-19 deaths * [IHME: one million excess deaths estimated attributed COVID-19, including unreported live people still follow logic. family member got appendicitis last week ER got within minutes. covid patients majority still lock numbers go up. said Google study. pages pages on-topic information, none agrees local quips silly is.  be, protected right US. preventative measures successfully implemented, easily look like never problem first place. time comes implement measures again, people assume fearmongering. Narrator - “it wasn’t” giving third booster shots everyone starting elderly they’re seeing huge drop breakthrough infections. 

The Israel data that's come pretty bad confounding issues. Essentially, shows show 3rd shot right away get fewer breakthroughs don't, hard tell different group people ways too. Along places, Israel data show whether boosters needed, whom, effective, yet. get Moderna prob don’t need boosters badly Moderna uses vaccine per shot. hand, Pfizer gives lowest number bad reactions.

That's one speculation - also, could turn anyone got 2nd shot 8+ weeks 1st need one (and differences observed efficacy US 3 vs 4 week gap).

But data yet. Boosters (for people immunocompromised) done precaution trial. J&amp;J planning booster, plan submitted FDA/CDC soon. Study already complete. 

I went got Labcorp antibody test done morning, see antibody levels at. $40, figure it’ll give peace mind decide next. AB levels super low, I’ll get Pfizer, it’s normal, I’ll get J&amp;J booster it’s available, it’s high won’t anything.

I don’t work Labcorp consult them.  serious question: 0.5% drop demand housing impact rental/purchase price real estate? Nothing now. live life safe. Texas would require proof here, believe that's norm. give info take there. Unsurprisingly, Okanagan- especially Kelowna - ground zero 4th wave. seems coming finally (coincidentally, vaccination rates going - relation tho...) gut feeling US, boosters authorized everyone. hope not, think science tells us needed. vaccines still prevent severe disease death variants. booster might give increased antibodies 6 months, wane reinfections occur. good plan. Idk either. guess EKG looked fine, sent wait 5 hrs chairs. 0,2% quite high. Yours, too. states actually taking seriously, thankful live Oregon. people BROKEN social contract.

56B SSI Payments.

17B TANF

260B expanded UI

Those numbers readily easily ID direct payments people.

That's 1.18T $1.77T ""Other Welfare""

I'm quite sure $105B ""U.S. Coronavirus Refundable Credits"" means. Could mean that's people get checks mail filed taxes got COVID relief money, number seems high, that's another one take look direct payments people.

I include number like $32B ""Child Nutrition Programs"" even though I'm fairly confident overwhelming majority number going public schools pay free reduced price lunchs.

I also include numbers like 34B ""Emergency Rental Assistance"" I'm exactly sure money went out. I'm guessing went straight landlords rather ""laundered"" tenants, say funneled private pockets.

And also got things like ""Payments States Child Care Development Block Grant"" going states, obviously know happening that.

And I'm exactly sure got $2.6T. There's $900B go $1.77T ""Other welfare"" thought including Medicaid Part Part C Medicare, adds $2.8T.

Does $148B DI (sub Social Security) fit that? that's direct payments people, included that, Social Security, I'm exactly sure defining ""Welfare.""

So, guess plain see nowhere near ""All"" ""funneled private pockets."" probably $2.6T going straight people, there's definitely good portion going straight people.  She’s ventilator.

I usually ignore everyone's ignorance starting piss off.

Our oldest son (her husband) came early morning, walks hugs everyone, holds youngest daughter asks get tested....!!! 🤬

He said hanging wife's family's home everyone sick, found everyone covid. 

I told leave. I'm dine stupid people want deny reality.

We (wife I) vaccinated 3 yr old not. wife immunocompromised (his mother!) BC Canada introduced vaccine cards access things like restaurants theatres. Support high, seen temporary measure ""push us edge"" get enough people vaccinated move past this. effective, first dose appointments doubled past month compared month before. 

The biggest fear people *won't* temporary, they'll eventually mandate perpetual boosters keep vaccine card date. happens, support program plummet, positive effects having. genuine concern. ""We know long(er) term effects vaccines!"" kid wearing masks fine almost 2 daycare classmates. Granted it’s anecdotal far I’ve heard, kids wear masks fine classroom settings. see others want friends. teachers don’t throw non-conforming kids FAA jail, figure work kid. one unmasked kid safer whole classroom unmasked. Please remember Rule 1 sub: civil. Please interact users respectfully. username helps deal it.   Dr. Racaniello, learned SARS-CoV-2 surprised think interesting unanswered question now? burst appendix incredibly serious. kill hours recovery complicated/problematic. basically means feces abdominal cavity. Lots risk infection there. feb-may 2020 window, data quality seems much worse 2021. states locked data trickle, weekly totals less. harder correlate death data without testing data, etc.  fuck wrong people would give shit Nicki says anything medical!? 

You might well give shit Bugs Bunny thinks! another example shows wealth doesn’t always equate intelligence. booster. third dose. Tearing apart CDC’s credibility long effort talk radio. like stopped international flights Jan 20 called racist it.

The blame honestly go around.

Doesn't help almost every Democrat saying take vaccine Trump.

So Trump won, would still denied taking 🤔 Love Pope Either way justified. ""1 500"" simply means 0.2%, plural. implying ""1 500"" singular.

Personally, I'd vote ""have."" whether evidence significantly decreased efficacy severe disease people 60

I can't state enough much hate argument relates boosters ""unnecessary"", basically part scientific community pushing throats.

Less infections everyone means less transmission. means less sick people, less long COVID, less death, etc **EVERYONE**. Vaccinated, unvaccinated, younger old.

If want withhold boosters hell bent every single one would otherwise end first shot Africa. Fine, honest it. facking blow smoke bunghole.

Lastly still waiting someone tell truth. Would every otherwise-would-be-booster end first shot someone's arm developing world? administration says do. says go pound sand. anecdotal evidence suggests endless unused doses getting wasted everywhere US. it?! Well, marry sex offender...  Held second doses get first doses supply uncertain time. ***""Alberta healthcare system verge collapse.""***

...


""US bad, guys."" Third doses much better *for now*. saying long term well, know yet, they've rolled pretty recently. 

Might great immunity infection (around 90% so) possible within 4-6 months since last dose taken. I'm one people know anybody I'm little anxious it. Like matter time. Households settings efficient transmission due proximity people long periods time. Even vaccinated people infected unlikely develop severe disease die. However, infected people transmit others - 80% infections caused 20% infected people. household situations one infected person, often see infection family members. would say difference likelihood infection, especially developing mild disease. Lol sad. Thanks. I’d rather see things change one way other, still risk. ironic part would ppl getting Ivermectin instead vaccine, Ivermectin (supposedly) cause impotence according random clear study said bs, anti-vax ppl use bs studies reasoning can't I?)**  Yep, that's it. want get really technical would point percentages apply population level layperson purposes, yeah, that's right way think risk reduction. Yeah complain chest pain they'll back real quick like. sure now, full covid patients that's experience past. Sorry right. Corrected below:

I wish wasn’t funny, true. people surprised labor shortage. must lazy people unemployment benefits, idiots killed everyone. SMH 🤦‍♂️ Yeah thats im saying No, believe misreading it. excess deaths includes covid deaths deaths causes may contribute it.

This shown right graph top. example, lower bound saying ""Estimated global excess deaths: 9.6M"" ""Official global covid-19 deaths: 4.6M"" multiplier 2.1x (aka 9.6M divided 4.6M). 

That method used calculate 1.2x-1.3x (240/199 260/199).

EDIT: ""more"" post correct two posts mine. say 1.2x-1.3x more, said 1.2x-1.3x multiplier official covid total. heard several virologists state due RBD’s specificity ACE-2 receptor, may nearing point mutations limit inhibit virus’s ability infect cells. heard others disagree. thoughts?  Gov. Hochul (NYS) masks required daycare centers everyone 2 up. tolerate masking older kids, trying mask 2-year-olds make sense -- especially stage pandemic. truly understand.

He/she could get infected transmit you. might infected develop mild moderate disease worst. think outdoors without masks fine accept risk - perhaps stay 6 feet apart? Nothing except sore arm.

You guys made right move 3 you. either. fact prosody key grammar. know go around trying bury fact. Lots people don’t *ability* pay need deserve place live.

All tenants required get vaccinated safely easily. point, would making decision unvaccinated worth keeping current apartment. That’s them.  Woke are. see willfully unvaccinated bad guys this. easy go get two little shots avoid killing people. bet would give window time asked. Okay I'll entertain that. would give better indication immunity antibody count? alternative there?

... yet. Also remember everyone reacts differently colds flu. 

My husband gets sick burns fever 2-3 days better.

I get sick fever 100 even get one. severe misery symptoms 1-2 weeks another mobth dry asthmatic uncontrollable coughing. yeah get sick get better within days probably nbd get sick. huge deal affects quality life usually month. Already started TN.  Seems man right protect tenants employees. told wife told OB get booster, true, asked allowed, said write compromised. Keep seeing people say unvaccinated people removed hospitals last priority, 100% agree. ever reality? could happen? assholes say taking space hospital stupidity? I'd like hear one. Humans meaningful connect top 150 people. Maybe maybe deniers care hit ratio. Doubt it. think everyone first hand experience loss due covid. never said correct. simply posed question. seem getting bent shape argument wanted start reason, can’t properly answer several reasons, don’t want let go, unknown reasons. Oh right, thanks. work Boris!  reason I’d move back Florida land job NASA commercial space launch provider, Kennedy Space Center biggest spaceport nation.

As built KSC Florida, latitude; closer equator, use speed earth’s rotation launching orbit, less propellant needed perform plane change maneuver want place satellite equatorial orbit. mention vaccinated ppl? get sick unvaccinated ppl. don’t really care dining preferences. It’s bizarre swear eating restaurants eternity pandemic. Even vaccinated one shouldnt actively seek get it, therefore mask inside makes sense. Also remember frequently get fresh air opening windows. think concerns unreasonable albeit good protection vaccines give.
Maybe half year enough data gathered enable 3rd shots general population. One top virologists Christian Drosten recently said he'd prefer third shot (not now) naturally becoming infected, naturally happen due covids endemic behaviour. One thing occurs dental visit. going people right face, mouth open, obviously mask. Would pre-visit use dental iodine gargle provide protection at-risk situation? Especially unvaxxed?

I'm preaching stuff -- never used it. saying real, scam. Must suck one dimensional person  people bad enough go hospital, nevermind many many long term affects hospitalized. final total permanent loss taste &amp; smell going staggering.  Nope. Listerine enemas kills stupid  Funnily enough, antibiotics vaccine TB came about, Sanitoriums people dying active TB sprinkled throughout US...

Up last summer, TB still deadliest infectious disease earth (in terms people killed per year) 500 600k deaths per year worldwide... weird post. Landlords always able set acceptable conditions use property provided constitute violation rights protected class. example, landlords pet policies, noise policies, prohibit smoking premises, prohibit subleases, prohibit certain uses property, prohibitions long-term guests, etc. slippery slope, already happened sometime around English common law. lol. CVS even ask ""eligible""? I'm considering getting booster end month, makes nervous bend truth health stuff. I’ve lung transplant - yes smokers totally able get lung transplants. denied years back college student (despite employed full-time mid-20s ""students protected class"")  Fair enough. don’t access JSTOR something similar, two studies found data subject similar percentages (~30-35% death rate ending vent). 30% still terrible, outlandish 80%.

Nothing definitive available yet, far data, idea Alpha, Delta, aren’t vastly different degree illness cause, transmission rate (delta primarily) incredibly higher, dominant. So, comparing outcomes patients ventilators wild strain Delta still seems like reasonable comparison me. sure better pulling numbers ass form conjecture. 

So, access better data, means, think everyone would benefit sharing it. Lol died listen facebooks memes. Nothing immune system  school probably already there, metric make masks optional. I'm guessing governor lifts mandate, wave ends.     actually think like  \*Care React\* Quebec City, restaurants (regardless indoor outdoor seating) required us show vaccine cards &amp; ID, Americans. Canadians streamlined app system appears. One restaurant worker told vaccine cards US literally handwritten information (the dosage, date, etc.), they're starting question they'll accept easy fake. I’m southern read hillbilly accent mind I’m crying laughing hard, thank 😂😂😂 Coronia?  don’t know you’re voted. It’s truth. 2 yr olds keep masks fine. People argue policy, that’s thread saying. It’s saying 2 yr olds actually keep masks fine. even pull down, take drink, put back up, themselves. Maybe people don’t want 2 yr olds wear masks, that’s different discussion. We’re saying it’s Mission Impossible. reality, it’s big deal. people move Florida never understand. feel people trapped want leave. It’s God’s waiting room, filled idiots, covid everywhere, attacked nature sides humidity, rising sea levels, hurricanes. case one said yet: regardless vaccination politics, separate stupid issue, healthcare 👏 system 👏should 👏 designed 👏 👏absorb pandemics emergent situations. according research I've seen. Apparently covid antibodies last 5-7 months. Vaxx status would questionable antibodies would give us idea whether patient certain level immunity. mean immune, mean less likely die. 

Beyond mandates force, move pandemic endemic? counties moving forward, Malaysia, started implement increased testing reason can't stop stupid stupid. 

But might able encourage public large self censor non-mask wearing / maybe getting unvaccinated line jab.

Because otherwise, lots innocent bystanders going die fool believe vaccinating covering germ spreading orifice. 

...the mouth, mean. goes way deeper that. lived military quite melting pot individuals.

My background: came upper middle class white suburbia Massachusetts, fucked highschool semester college needed mature enlisted.

My first experience rest country this. met people could barely read write. Let alone worry anything college SAT prep. 

These individuals (mainly south) literally basic math, still thought reading losers, believed creationism, general history knowledge.....etc get picture. 

Idk even reform that, people 5th grader came from. 

However comment rings true highschooling SAT prep college prep. time test scores learning. Probably hated it. 

Anywho got went college got educated, love learning now. 

Anywho roundabout point half country can't even get square one let alone whole SAT prep position, hand rest test prep. 

Idk find middle ground No, let's take stadiums.

Turn massive field hospitals COVID patients. Livestream patient traffic out.

Cancel fucking circuses see happens refuse vax.    love last part. Goddamn entirety reddit saying thing... thanks standing w firing squad use xylitol solution netipot (with doctor's permission) called Xclear, really clears sinuses! know using netipot safe someone might covid?  Yes, did. degree chemistry.  
The last time studied chemistry final years high school.  
We different system pick specifics subjects belonging particular discipline final two years specialize them. specialized physics, chemistry, maths, biology.  
My Bachelor's Masters science.  
However, expert?  
Do believe absolutely right? Given stressing saying expert. well shit forgot demographic 8 months seems suspiciously time would take give boosters got first shots 8 months ago...  stated factually multiple times lockdowns work virus going ever ""go away"". don't. subs pretty unfortunate Filthy Frank comes up.  Point *they aren’t mismanaged*. 

And “antibody tests” won’t fix problem.   exact timing likely important effectiveness.

It's important care getting Americans boosted holidays traveling across country spending time family friends indoors. adults US got vaccinated April/May 6 month interval accomplish whereas 8 month one not.  Think responded wrong person? like Germany carved piece hospital Covid+ patients. also Covid free area. thing rooms Corona patients, takes time clean non covid patients. want switch personel. hospital management predict needed.  Alcoholics get liver transplants.  getting sick quarantine would use almost PTO days allotted year

Jesus Christ, yall need unions  still even then, that's definitely exacerbating things, probably pretty significantly. Honestly forgotten that.

And tell days retail: satisfaction surveys terrible, responses terribly subjective. understand share frustation going get normalcy back long breathing people kill them. Regular vaccinations may required time, especially people refuse get thereby extend pandemic. Y’all really believe everything say huh cost anything. Wait til hear tetanus meningitis flu… mean sincerely: seek therapy. Pfizer conflating “antibody level” “immunity”. It’s  HOLY SHIT people actually think eliminate illness hahahahahaha. 

Also, know winter exists, right? rain? extreme heat?  I’m sorry you. Especially given bypass patients usually go ICU surgery beds acutely of.  idea injected antibodies fighting disease you, immune system work, learning produce antibodies process. think similar effects antibiotics. That's vaccines considered breakthrough, train immune system fight disease, rather fighting disease directly. ever consider world doesn’t revolve around you?

Yup, that's wear mask social distance. even don’t die it, spread disease others die it?


They vaccinated. still afraid dying. go outside. 

Vaccinated people also spread fucking selfishness self-mindedness absolute troglodytes appalling.

The faux outrage amongst people like even worse. excuse jerk bashing shitting people make feel better. don’t care end killing people;

You really **care** people. use pawn argue people online pp gets back peer-reviewed published clinical study shows evidence livestock *parasite remover*** jack shit human *respiratory disease.***

What's this? human uses solely horse de-wormer like arrogantly said previous statement? said 2nd PCV Hepatitis shot too? Alone half unconscious part…   appendix rupture worst pain ever felt life. wish worst enemy. Good luck eating outdoors winter. Easy fix.

Multiply everyone's rent 10x. Offer 90% discounts units everyone vaccinated.

[Florida rental laws _heavily_ favor tenants likely month-to-month would expect aren't, 1/12 transition month-to-month every month.

So, even landlord use vaccination status [valid for-cause eviction could always get around either terminating unvaccinated leases reason given month-to-month, though would fought court doubt, landlord could instead give 15-day notice terminating _all_ month-to-month leases, allow tenants re-apply rent. landlord approves new, month-to-month lease entirely discretion. amazing big part country shut first wave stop happening. happening RIGHT mostly saying ""F it"" life regular. Seriously. That’s fringe opinion even amongst fringe COVID nuts.  It’s probably reporting gap, county doesn’t report holiday, areas don’t test rest get grouped after.  Thank pointing already know. never said ERs overwhelmed, rather mismanaged. far yet give suggestions different have. wait times growing. Vaccines help, yes. change situation in.

You provided solutions. FYI, suggestion looks like (not actual suggestions, examples) : forcefully jabbing people, creating new set mandates certain workplaces, restrictions unvaxxed, incentives vaccine...etc  cruel all. They've already made decision deny medical care. extension that. parents friends refused take vaccine. daughter went summer camp school caught Covid gave parents. month ago, kids father lost one month battle Covid leaves wife 2 kids yet graduate high school. tell that. people delusional. Everyone gets sick dies one day. living la la land think go throughout life without ever getting sick. Mine - cold duration two days. gives me. OlnyFans me... Without even seeing study sounds believable, convince me.

But think maybe could bridge gap addressing parent comment mine about.  get FREE flu shot every year - NEVER flu. 74 next month. Come Solano Napa County East Bay. mask mandates it’s great!  Visitors non-Covid patients even bringing Covid in. presented data mix booster dose 30 µg BNT162b2 administered approximately 7 9 months primary series Phase 1 participants approximately 6 months primary series Phase 2/3 participants. 

Most participants got 6 months that's data is.

The exact timing likely important effectiveness. Off-topic almost forgot hospital ships said that. felt like finally someone outside city cared people going help us. saw many jokes family Texas even upstate laughing people dying ""blue""areas, felt good see ships get see taken seriously.    - parents' - choice. live die choices make, accept consequences choices. you’re willfully ignoring advice doctor, medical professional, rock hospital anyway. fucking point doing?

You completely control medical professionals. 
They whatever fuck need point. 
Your freedom effectively removed, whatever takes, unfortunately them, try save life. 

Tubes throat, drugs, IV’s etc. ICU, it’s nothing. 

Guess easiest way avoid losing control…  spent night friend's house last weekend. Kids got talk jumping blow mattress. Fair. shouldn't. friend followed with, ""because also can't take ER right now."" Oh god. right. That's scary thought. Mine something digestive system related. I've super bloated, constantly burping farting, day, every day. CT show blockage though. 

I'm 41, this, I'm actually best health life. used weigh 500lbs, finally changed lifestyle, I've comfortably maintaining 180ish 3 years now. got 2 new hips, replace ones worn weight. 

Good luck you, hopefully get answers soon. come $40 shot cure smokers, alcoholics, drug addicts, obesity, anything else pull ass, denying expensive treatments refuse take shot. I'm even suggesting denying treatment, putting lowest priority.    slight connection education intelligence you’re taking advice Nicki Minaj problems..    friend died cancer covid. money pay world class treatment, NY postponed operation tumor removal. went elsewhere, wait, died operating table. brought back health never got close recovering next 8 months. 

He spent 8 months without tongue 3 failed muscle grafts create tongue servicable enough eat food. Appendix burst lead total organ failure 48k bill family borrow money pay since insurance cover it. Might well have, it'd cheaper. get medical advice joe rogan  lol meta shit unvaccinated people died. Man, it’s hard seeing parents cry cause friend dies refusing take vaccine. ventilator whole month didn’t make it. Something could’ve prevented, sucks man it’s frustrating. leaves wife 2 kids yet graduate high school. incredibly sad day today. it’s one time you’re gonna get people becomes regular thing it’s gonna like flu shots people skip them. Try again. mean, point people still temporary hard lockdowns conditions still feasible contain/eliminate contact trace? compare US, basically worst case example never closed borders, never general entry quarantine system, locked year really state state unevenly different times, virus keeps circulating never goes away, locked parts get fucked anyway everyone suffers. Look places like Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, extremely successful enjoyed much freedom less economically impacted. Literally exact scenario people screaming 18 months. troubling news sense want 95% protection infection may need covid booster every 6 months.

The protection hospitalization deaths never decreases. want booster designed counter Delta variant. dont want booster shot designed original 2019 covid virus.   Instead, law requires tenants get vaccinated rent house. 

why enforced *that* point? say ""get vaccinated get fined""? Tangent: understand yellow bows thing. song (""Tie Yellow Ribbon 'Round Old Oak Tree""), guy PRISON, ribbon show welcome back not. apply military. Don’t get wrong, it’s complex issue would need attacked multiple sides. unhoused want get streets would benefit greatly. also thoughts mental healthcare addiction. Lol Okay lets end social distancing bs. Nicki Minaj could encourage men become impotent. Covid causes ball damage. Covid facilities divided US. Germany, separate ER Covid patients. Separate nursing stations separate ICUs. course, switch rooms takes time cleaning crew.  I’m conflating anything, letting people know virologists don’t back idea giving everyone booster shots time. whatever want Even family member dies they’ll say “not covid!” continue pretend doesn’t exist vaccine equity? Literally said originally yeah sure man Absolutely. think it’s important many proven effective tools possible prevent COVID. Vaccines far best absolute necessity, anything top might prevent spread welcome. 

Belt + suspenders go inject bleach pop Hydroxychloroquine Ivermetcin like daddy Trump told do

Nah Ill take chances virus killed 2087 6,000,000 cases age group, thanks.

Keep going around pretending like Ivermectin solely horse dewormer various human uses. makes easy identify non biased person spends life obsessing politics every waking minute day. Kids get lots illnesses daycare. Covid daycares OK cold-type bugs fever otherwise kids would every week.  Yeah. add type 2 diabetes list well since self inflicted. drug overdoses failed suicides babies Too! choice! model, COVID-19 vaccines prevented 139,000 deaths first five months available. 570,000 COVID-19 deaths occurred U.S. May 9; model projected 709,000 deaths would occurred without vaccines. researchers estimated economic value preventing deaths $625 billion $1.4 trillion.

I'd interested many hospitalizations prevented. Keeping hospitals open emergencies health care staff burning seems like important metric. also real economic value. article mention this. many people die decision made? people listening to, lying them, telling almost everyone mild case this, like mild flu. So, no, expecting pay thousands medical bills. fair, majority people hospitalized. severe misunderstanding around number like ~5% chance hospitalization actual risks/repercussions things like long covid are.  Americans hung rights responsibilities!  Americans say shot, jab British English injection.   know things bad Buffalo - I'm sure Sabres musts 12 attendees.  mind answering questions like these; helps reassure someone give idea expect, worthwhile.

About five months. qualified basis Florinef inflammation orthostatic hypotension. explicitly qualify vaccine, also condition called Ehlers-Danlos well, comes range complications stroke-like migraines, chronic fatigue, digestion issues, prolapsed heart valve, slow wound healing etc. describe healthy. 

The second shot gave fever, vertigo, nausea, body aches, fatigue, works. third shot mild first even. issue obesity far complicated. gov't spending billions subsidizing HFCs, wages keeping cost living food deserts factors. US government spends 10 trillion year welfare services. Way per capita country far. funneled private pockets provide little care possible funds. Corrupt af. think we're largely agreement here. US hugely failed messaging Trump, still significant room improvement Biden (though I'd argue Biden got handed helm Titanic hit iceberg).

Here's disagree (emphasis *informed unified* citizenry acting public good benefit all. really hard idea, *isn't hard accomplish*.

If easy accomplish otherwise natural game-theory equilibrium, every country would seeing results regardless leadership. mere fact vaccination rates headline-worthy elucidates point outlier behaviour studied better replicate it.

Perhaps, seem suggest/favor, attributed largely executive governmental leadership. me, seems highly unlikely, think probably discards lot useful nuance study hopefully replicate areas worse vaccine adoption. One thing certain me: second believe Irish people born innate predilection towards vaccinations. question becomes: messaging happened along way ""inform"" vaccination obvious logical choice. campaigns like built foundation success years necessary? say anything me. said californians booming economy.  talk privilege, think know means since know anything me.  Portugals man see much US spends treating alcohol cigarette related diseases? obesity, demographic know US excels in? pay bills they're taking resources away sick people? sound like guys universal healthcare Oh yes. would worst year this. Cops really fucking idiots. long wait get third shot immunocompromised? got second shot May!  don’t know Biden going expedite doesn’t cut corners shifts resources. FDA hates that. extremely unhappy expedite full authorization Two million people Texas one person ever 15; could easily believe half that, 1 person 30, data entry error  send kid daycare already know kid feeling well snotty nose? infect kids? Can't understand people selfish stupid Lmao parents vaccinated. part gave us guidance look struggling breathing, could see belly breathing hard. mentioned home oximeter, little device get drugstore test blood oxygen levels. levels dropped 95 below, saw belly breathing, take emergency that's happened 24 hours checking oxygen level, got 95, started packing up. Within 30 minutes, ready walk door. checked home oximeter again, dropped 88. always way always be. US spends 2.6 trillion welfare services year. nothing. many women saying totally regular suddenly issue vaccine, it’s medical gaslighting call issue anything side effect. boat. Pfizer, WNC. figure get copy records, please let know it. Go herm@nc@in@ward subreddit. health insurance, life insurance theme. least 15k aware lol need amend constitution, people making religious exemptions. Even Hasidic Rabbis telling congregations get vaccinated, unlike anythi f seen.   Think mask mandates rescinded areas CDC defines ""low moderate"" transmission? whole reason mask mandates come back, right?
  
Not yet, per CDC site: LA county moved high substantial transmission. Seems possible could enter moderate transmission weeks, CDC recommended masks vaccinated people transmission ""substantial high""
  
Will interesting see happens places Americans love shit countries 'wasting money' social healthcare 'other people', America goes spends *more public money per capita* countries healthcare.

It's like making fun someone wasting $60k BMW spent $100k Lada. im american, isnt healthcare privatized? spends billions exactly? walk job protest. That's beyond ridiculous! politics really turned notch since then. California's economy booming.  $75 billion surplus taxes. Compared states nothing prevent spread, ran huge deficits like Florida Texas.  Majority Californians better covid Newsoms policy.  Glad governor kept family safe. likely free, call around.

Finally, risks involved vaccination too. Aside known immune induced side effects like myocarditis, getting many shots quickly may result serum sickness, allergic shots.

When agency stopped sharing data, public health experts expressed concern, arguing local-level pandemic information helps Floridians make better daily life decisions wearing masks, social distancing attending events.

Health officials explain Tuesday made information available months requests media county leaders.

The percent people covid die isnt important metric, talking Covid dangerous. infection rate high issue.

It’s like USA donate poorer countries. vaccine production reached state support multiple regions. said that, support boosters healthcare risk populace rest people wait time till get boosters. fair equitable world knows. dad going cancer (pre covid!) dr straight told him, “let know insurance doesn’t accept it, might give earful.” Sounds like STD. dad told drafted Vietnam, put line pneumatically blew vaccines you, one another. played 'darts' throwing pneumatic injector arms. Oh good ol' days... Ah may right, know moderna pfizer things differently. Though article say 6 month 6, that's different I've heard past. think that's one reasons NY mostly plateaued.

don't

come back FDA come ivory tower realize we're damn pandemic then.

I agree though, exception sticklers, bat eye ask third shot whether valid reason. Brasil vaccination age, countries, older younger, day day.

I got first Pfizer shot early August, scheduled second early Nov, waiting 3 months doses.

Now cities able vaccinate 18+, starting call people second dose bit earlier. expect take mine early October.

So, there's enough doses vaccinate everybody, receiving couple million doses per day using advance.

Seeking health care anything Covid dangerous now. People getting infected doctors' offices, ERs, diagnostic facilities. dentist offices. Pretty good way defund police ask me... saw interview Fauci talking vaccine efficacy severe illness hospitalizations dropping Israel. said Israel month ahead vaccination program, we’ll probably start seeing thing soon. Frickin sign ASAP booster!  cheaper easier get damn vaccine instead suing vaccine mandate. Same. really hope recent vaccination spike peaked already... foolish Americans. think happens US doesn’t biggest guns anymore? would create demise. Meta  I'll honest. Making deadline short another issue terms logistics alone.


There lot people side effects too. like light till 30 hours first dose. happens army that's span? dude VIGILANT mefloquine pills last deployment one got malaria.

He beyond pissed. :) 

For issue would agree b/w, however people vaccinated could adverse impact us vaccinated well, break cases worse new mutations. important solve somehow even distasteful us get involved. point less program socialist program, sense every aspect life taken care of.

YSK, develop new influenza vaccine season Let tell you, Florida, high sense urgency. death numbers came horrible here, governor making everything worse. 

Err side caution trust Israel data offer boosters asap. breakthrough infections, unlike early post-vaccine months, many breakthroughs bad infections requiring hospitalization l data hospitals showing this? Anyone admitted Covid vax status recorded, including date vaccination. Run data folks! thought one justifications EMRs, we'd almost realtime data ever epidemic. answers within hospital data. Except milder infections require hospitalization. 

How know many vaccinated people U.S. serious infections death Covid x months 2nd shot? mean right lol Lol ok bro Refusing direct order. dishonorable discharge, luck admin separation disturbing. Really.

They're following LA's lead, resting high vaccination rates community. chose Moderna three vaccines one made America clouded Pfizer's J&amp;J's scandals.

That open source (sort of). need punish them, need punish first harshly publicly everyone else go along avoid same. DD military version felony. see impressed. reasoning ""poor nations"" get dibs vaccines first? Check American Academy Pediatrics reports 
 
They show hospitalization rates MUCH higher numbers provided. cumulative delta specific. Delta numbers presumably would least little bit higher, perhaps high 4% states. 
 
""Among states reporting, children ranged 1.6%-4.1% total cumulated hospitalizations, **and 0.1%-1.9% child COVID-19 cases resulted hospitalization.**"" Same. asked wanted Pfizer would probably said yes, I'm glad didn't. Yes, India perfect example. 

But go ordeal (massive deaths) reach declining stage working vaccine could used absurd. Unless see reason getting booster would cause harm... I’m damndest get one next month. like calling control worse kind human nature. Sure would nice, impossible.   Yeah covid, died death. I'm native English speaker, ""200 mln COVID-19 doses"" sounds pretty strange me. correct say ""disease doses"" instead ""vaccine doses""? really wish could sign waiver go label something. Unless earth shattering safety info kept public, know outcome 99.999% likely be. Let's get kids jabbed holidays bring fresh wave bullshit way.

Yes.

I'm sure parents kids ended hospitalized delta mind since risk approving already could disaster.

Exactly. might discouraged people never intended get vaccinated first place. Yeah mortality data 2020 suggests 72% dead covid-19 officially number confirmed covid-19 deaths: 209000 

Excess deaths compared 5 year average: 360000

So instead 2900, might almost 5000... practice safety better anti vaccine people know conceal carry (the virus). 😂 soon 2 shots isn’t considered vaccinated? Same. general, I'm never flying unmasked again. Seriously. Would hurt much say ""highest""?

Both daughters 102 103 fevers 3 4 days, nasty cough congestion/drainage. also tired time wanted lay next me. 

I took care three symptoms took 2 PCR test course next week negative.

-They dismiss Mayo Clinic study wide CI, failing note justification booster even towards upper end it.

-The fail include numerous studies replicating study's findings US.

-They seem believe even rosier studies showing 90-95% effectiveness severe disease (and much less symptomatic) justify booster, never define believe good enough.

-The fail cite CDC cited research showing proof obvious: picture much worse 60+, 80% severe disease, 87% everyone July. 

They also make poor arguments it. terrible letter heavily distorts science back thing actually care about, slowing exports weeks matter many US EU suffer it, belief discourages vaccination.   virus never know truly ends. Delta variant could possibly require 88% *all* population immune order halt spread least send R 1.

Problem is, immunity always strong concept virus. People vaccinated 6 months earlier lose immunity infection (sterilizing immunity) 20% people vaccinated never it. vaccination rates high yeah, natural immunity counts too, like sure rely natural immunity already, said, never know virus stops. 88% HIT means infected person goes across 8 people expose Covid, average 7 immune virus. guarantee that? seems yet far goal winter.

Study estimates Delta R0 5.08, vs. 2.79 original strain. estimate comes lower [previous disproves ""delta contagious chickenpox"" misconception particularly reassuring either--it's higher flu. (Edit: Covid-19 always contagious flu. double.)  arguing, paying for? why? they're protecting community, seems they're subtracting value, adding it. Whatever they're supposed doing, dangerous everyone vaccinated vaccinated, know it.  However rule change size must go Congress 1st. 2,900 number refers South Florida only. total state summer closer 12k.   thought isn’t even conclusive evidence booster yet ? obvious layman obvious professional. People see ""larger dose, must it!"" ""it spaced X number days vs number days, must it!"". reality went phase trials fact experiment doses (and maybe spaced, know). companies picked seemed appropriate.

When comes booster dose 1/2 original, scientists dumb motherfornicators. reason making so. Administering third dose different first, second. system primed quite possible reacts differently such. also need mitigate side effects. good vaccine one wants take it? well documented Pfizer's easier tolerate.

Anyway personally find sort posts naïve insulting people saving react severely trade less durable protection.

You wouldn't, masses? anyone wants original shot, easily go get it. one going stop you.  Yes - four weeks submission authorization past, expect available December data submitted November. Hopefully earlier rather later - kids start getting shot early December they'll presumably decent protection time holidays roll around, even two-dose regimen. haha comments get deleted regardless views, fun! situation probably even worse map shows rural South. dots ""no data""--but surrounded 95+ 90-95% dots. also interesting Atlanta holding well.

;)  Biden 79? Isn’t dengue fever unique antibody dependent enhancement…. hasn’t evidence happening far. guess doesn’t mean can’t guess we’re fucked then. Tuesday night, 663,913 people US died Covid-19, according Johns Hopkins University data. According US Census Bureau, US population April 2020 331.4 million.

I think safe say much higher 1:500 given they're sticking using suspect official death count. 

[This article back also CNN fair use reporting, talks number crunching Institute Health Metrics Evaluation University 574,000 deaths, United States reported Covid-19 causalities country. IHME report estimates US death toll 905,000 people -- around 58% higher.

Which exactly went ""Hmmmm"" read headline above. Based everything I've reading pandemic asked guesstimate ratio would like 1 300. include people dying things like cancer get treated inability get emergency medical care hospital drowning COVID patients... might even like 1 275 more. 

Whatever real number is, 1 500 far conservative estimate.  formulations vaccines different. example, dilution active ingredients neutral carrier fluid different. dose much fluid syringe, measurement amount active ingredient.  curiosity anyone gaming wanted anyway? mean seems like crummy way force military let contract. notoriously impossible break contract it? seems like super risky way though.

""I never urge got vaccine.""  There's not. Israel lot vaccines many people willing take them, there's side effects minor, pretty much going experiment. Right. Half family seeming could care less take kids safety hands. stayed away. would nice see soon. Would expect Delta specific vaccine would bring breakthrough infections significantly genie bottle? vaccination personal choice. filling hospitals patients could avoided becoming seriously ill little room emergency situations sure guy talking anti-vaxxer sentiment sub, I’ve seen nothing support sub.

We draconian removal misinformation anti-vax now.

It's laughable someone thinks there's anti-vax sentiment army sub exists like 30 seconds. \~90% ventilated patients COVID-19 die, people COVID-19 low priority triage, would effect deprioritize unvaccinated patients like many Redditors want. Triage saving many lives possible. means ignoring anyone who's likely either die survive matter do. mean got shot, disease?

It's serious infection caused bacteria. Without treatment high chance death. There's different forms; usually skin infection, lower mortality rate.

It's rare, like 2000 cases year, globally. weaponized. Bio-warfare banned, know, chemical weapons banned, too, Saddam, Assad, etc used anyway... Plus possibility terrorism. seems prudent military vaccinated it. *chef's kiss* getting at? 2 people work died 2021. One stroke, brain aneurysm, neither covid. least 2. see 6 world meter course Florida since purposely delay counts honestly know first question. memo got says ""no adverse action taken pending exemption request."" I'm sure things like mandatory videos, meetings doctors, etc, seen ""adverse actions"". would assume so, though.

Once Soldier gets answer Surgeon General, though, *that's* basically last chance get vaccine. They'll ordered get it, refuse, they'll sent doctor explain get vaccine. back CO, they'll get ordered again, refuse second time, *that's* real action gets taken.

Right admistrative consequences GOMOR (Essentially nasty letter General Officer goes record), soon consequence immediate separation. said district’s investigation found four cases linked classroom. CDPHE’s definition outbreak five cases single classroom/activity close contact.

""Sir, found four cases far.""

""STOP COUNT!"" many people died Covid-related blood clots, kidney failure, etc., surviving initial infection?  \-Ron DeSantis  totally disagree. Leaders certainly could done better (and continue fall short) removes responsibility people themselves. America Americans themselves: rejection facts, buying conspiracy theories, believing Russian misinformation people trying help. part country decides reject modernity return dark ages, end up.  SPC: ""Uh... SGT, we're dental appt."" was--they mention vomiting Sunday, Monday day took school. Yes. There's Synagis that's vaccine, like antibodies given monthly. what. Follow data. great example 5+ million gone second third. Unofficially waiting “approval.” Plenty counties tossing plenty out. tell pretty fast “stealing first,” actually likely. It’s not. problem getting Delta top based data 5-8 months out, it’s refuse already tango virus. 1/500=.002= 0.2% Yeah nobody actual numbers ballpark range. Ontario mask wearing even rural areas like everybody seen. People distanced around others polite. contrast vs America astounding. really big difference? Kentucky, who's getting hit hard right now, 50% fully vaccinated. New York 62%. Oregon, who's outbreak problem recently, 59%. Maine, who's currently seeing biggest increase cases past two weeks, one vaccinated states country difference 5 people 10 lower vaccinated states fully vaccinated versus 6 10 NE. That's hardly big gap talking highly contagious virus. And, ripping entire country - northeast.

It's simple making sound. Indeed wasn’t implying weren’t vaccinated. exaggerate gives fuel antivaxxers, apparently misunderstood downvoted oblivion.  sounds like vomiting two days day school. kids threw one day, two days later thrown since, would also assume illness past, runny nose unrelated. son NICU week went home mom husband stayed hospital 5 weeks, one ICU intestinal perforation c-section know sewn back up, uterus contract get 6 units blood massaging uterus hard night long, almost went back hysterectomy, perf could've massaging too. got sicker every day day 6 incision ripped open stool came pouring out. went back left belly open draining fistulas drains, septic ended strict NPO TPN intestines healed. 1 week ICU 4 regular surgery floor baby went home without me.

Indeed, American, personal patriotic duty support medical logistics best can. cannot withhout help 137 million Americans. really think public grown selfish mentally weak decades failed leadership especially Republicans. encourage coddle radicals every step way. comes vaccines, even responsible ones low key equivocate vaxx decision. Instead saying unequivocally unpatriotic selfish dumb fucking douche vaccinate asap. controversial slightest, equivocating causing rest us needless burden. really likely Delta reached infection ceiling outcompete future variants like right now? seems like almost turning endemic countries point, sooner later others, course. Yeah that’s already done unfortunate hear form anecdotes data. Adverse outcomes due triaging patients need tracked somehow. Honestly usually way easier give guys boot without court martial. want out, fast, positive drug test enough forget DD. sure different Air Force, that's works Army. Soldiers start process Chaplain, chaplain sends doctor, goes Soldier's lowest level commander. Soldier must meet people.

The Commander *suggest* approve/deny, sign deny stop them. like awards. matter what, paperwork, regulation, must make way *all way chain*, Army Surgeon General. approval denial authority *any* exemption. really hope so! many families want get together holidays year.

Unvaccinated people (by choice) need placed back line, damn choice.  see analyses eventually, take time. one Florida, covers March September 2020: thing realize official Covid death totals underestimate actual mortality, excess death measures also underestimate Covid mortality. 

Why? Take look shows pediatric mortality due influenza, disappeared 2020 far 2021. sources mortality also decreased, smaller number causes death increased. even excess deaths probably underestimates true Covid mortality.

Yeah that’s true change tact delta hit. people rebook though. didn’t bother already 11 weeks doses little point rebooking system couldn’t guarantee you’d sent local vaccination centre. hospitals overflowing would one thing, there's many studies showing effectiveness drop 70s 80s *severe disease*, know threshold 'verified data' met least seniors/high risk/healthcare workers, they're making right call.

Since know vaccine safe, Phase safety data boosters, Israel's data, there's safety issue, situation let hospitalization skyrocket sit around talking long crisis wait trying stop it. 

I *really* hope go way Lancet authors make intellectually dishonest argument justify ethics-based decision know wildly unpopular. appreciate that. actually bad. mean, I'll never eat food seeing things are, job work. 

The real problem staff 13 positions 8- 10 people I'm usually working least 2-3 myself.

FL people different breed though... landlord thinks moral obligation protect workers tenants. moral arguments side here. guess? many studies. put arbitrary numbers based feelings, stupid. 

""This study demonstrated non-linear (U-shaped) relationship BMI fatal illness. Subjects BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m2 and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 had high risk fatal illness. "" -UoHK

But reguardless, fat people deserve die pretty I'm ok fat people dying fat shit way think you’re opinion unhoused people provided housing? That’s dope. Hope see lobbying believe in. like dude basically small scale country unto himself. response government doing. okay. even okay federal vaccine mandate fucking scumbag landlord vaccine mandate. Fuck here.

Looks like unvaxxed need gtfo! Works me. sure Israeli data mean--vaccine efficacy? agree can't arbitrarily discard studies dislike results.

If multiple studies apparently conflicting implications, think evaluate study quality, sample size, initial conditions, assumptions made, overall validity analysis, possible conflicts interest. (You regardless). try explain discrepancy. There's usually logical rationale. come valid one, count cherry-picking. That’s said COVID-positive vaccinated/unvaccinated person.

Without recent test, idea whether person I’m interacting COVID not, regardless vaccination status. subsequent vaccination leads stronger immune response.

Is Moderna boosters going half dose? immune response round three even stronger round two, I'm going unhappy. Possibly days. we’d people arguing it’s lawful order.

Unless violates Geneva Convention, think there's many unlawful orders give (could wrong though). He's making homeless. He's giving notice now. Get vaccinated, find new place lease up. end homeless, go looking new place, that's them. Nobody blame Trust me, know. Coming J&amp;J breakthrough case 🙃 myocarditis appearing second dose. still far less myocarditis associated COVID, though. 100% agree, I'm right employee terrible PTO policy.

One unspoken reasons hospital systems overrun right due shitty policies deter nurses medical professionals seeking employment within groups, including PTO, unsustainable patient care provider ratios, rounding practices evidence based, policies protect litigation improve patient outcomes. 

This MAJOR problem pre-COVID lots hospitals struggled flu RSV seasons past, pandemic made even obvious something within healthcare system needs change order us weather future pandemics. personally know several nurses doctors regularly sent young children daycare sick gastro/colds/HFM pandemic option, daycares stricter codes conduct, many quit jobs rather get fired excessive time off. data gathering initial trials attempts gather since pretty uncertain. Essentially, depend vaccinated people getting tested without symptoms exposure, need set study specifically, can't look population data. testing people provides quite uncertain data: hard say whether remnants virus actually means ""infected"", test detected virus killed antibodies. news reports often confuse efficacy disease efficacy infection, hard find what.

Corona endemic now. need care potential asymptomatic pseudo infections. it, let's see long live libertarian paradise.

they liberty, long one else exercises liberty people wonder left home state. Fucking DeSantis acolytes death us all. Water isn’t wet. makes things wet. never said easter. makes statement better. respiratory viruses spread droplets - degenerate quickly fine aerosols. absence hard data CDC advice understandable. Sure, looks bad hindsight, we've years worth intensive research this. anyone around you, vaccinated unvaccinated, could secretly carrying COVID.

True, chances greatly reduced vaccinated. 

I like landlord. would agree homes provided unhoused people. even read responded Vast majority Covid **delta** patients

From Observational cohort study patients admitted March 6, 2020, April 17, 2020

This say think does. may point (I'm sure seen empirical data delta) linked paper certainly give evidence claim. Thank you. Good point. informative. 
Have read heard sarcasm? That's fascinating subject well.  +tourist Yeah don’t get idea natural immunity worth risk, that’s implying. making unvaccinated people homeless help people died virus? Well convince people. actually ok that.. house renting send repair people ,I would want safe them. Right doctors sick bay air literally permeated viral particles. people don’t need protective googles swing Walmart. Let’s inflate likelihood people.  countries return 'normal' sooner others.

That's think too. think soon first world countries vaccinated dealing virus nicely next year poorest countries still dealing infectious waves years come due low vaccine quantities. Vaccinated people still get breakthrough COVID though.

Yes it’s lower rates, tenants still going outside potentially largely unvaccinated areas.

Anyone could get breakthrough infection bring back apartment building. good question, I'm sure first two, definitely think save Michaelangelo future booster, hopefully like TDAP need one every 10 years this. 1:47 finished going first round questions! Much previous AMA. are.  Probably lot people say covid without positive test people would say “oh got sick last January totally it” get vaccine Unfortunate times live in, sir madame! incorrect appear breakthrough cases may contagious unvaccinated cases, vaccine decreases risk infection first place.  great question. hope countries put pandemic preparation plans place. hope countries research make pan-CoV vaccines antivirals future outbreaks. However viruses cause pandemics need ready well. need research viruses animals threats us - little knowledge them. science, societal issues course, virologist. Look numbers, vast majority deaths fatties. gov pushing vax instead pushing healthy diet exercise. yeah got shot I'm also healthy person numbers crazy low like 0.0003% shit like healthy people. 12 8 weeks, depending. lot Moderna going early summer keen reschedule people earlier second dose, get protection Delta hit. Either way lot longer US schedule, principle stronger protection. It'll hard say, though - many people UK got Moderna all. would spitting face laughing them. given year least 1 100 people die. max covid respondible 1/7 total deaths last 18 months. point, TB second leading cause death entire country. Extreme hazards call desperate measures. Maybe it’s time close schools.  Well yes aware require parental consent, idk put put part. 100%, like chickenpox party Boehbart something common Nicki Minaj…. Thanks link. doubt COVID caused excess deaths. point reply prompt citation, keeping sub rules. wonder got limp. right. probably much 1 500 mix Pfizer/Moderna. They'd prefer didn't, ultimately, options ""mix match"" ""don't get second dose"" getting second dose priority there. Respectfully I'll disagree stupidity ignorance. Pride something anyone work changing. I've therapy less arrogant around friends. someone mental health issues, yes hard work, changeable power individual acknowledge actions selfish. 

If coddle people, grow. parents saying 'boys boys' argument excuses personal responsibility. know.... thing surviving initial infection without dying experiencing long haul symptoms another story

Just get vaxxed. Wow ordeal you’ve gone through! 13 years more… 

Yup, staying hospital - 2 bouts pneumonia 6 years thankfully treatable home. adults around vaxxed. Silver linings g-tube though…I absolutely keep hydrated medicated fight cold/flu season. Gotta love that. think need booster every year. could one enough round immunity cover variants. might need new vaccine eventually, perhaps every 4-8 years? early tell.

Infections kids increasing dramatically think important vaccinate 12.

Yes, mRNA vaccines quickly adjusted tested. variants 'evading' vaccines, see comments earlier AMA. Unfortunately answer probably yes. risk they're taking solely theirs. Obesity infectious. sorry can't treated get vaccinated escorted knowing die

How this, imagine turning away someone *did* get vaccinated perhaps got freak accident avoid. find turn away hordes unvaccinated people.

The current situation *have* turn away people limited resources. something hide head sand run away. refusing choose, costing lives, including people best follow public health guidelines. 

Not saying treat unvaccinated all, always treat last. chose get vaccine, bear cost personal decision.  true. know many people look social media, even people used know affected covid, heard. 

I know handful people personally caught it. distant family member may died it, something else - old. family member friend apparently residual symptoms covid, know details. 

I could easily view covid impact life lives friends family, I'm idiot realize world revolve around me. think take place another flu. serious societal health concern don’t think rises level concern bunch young healthy people scared might happen engage group activities. mindset shift eventually. whole avoid costs dropped vaccination sensible cold prevention methods. ventilation upgrades background effective counter measures would smart. I'm taking 500 account solely points fact ""1"" % subset population (500). Thus, obvious actual subject plural # people. Probably one coronavirus vaccine recently approved.

There lots controversy lawsuits unapproved anthrax vaccine administered soldiers. anthrax attacks US led vaccines claimed originated Dr. Ivins, charge vaccine’s development. OP, got KN95 masks similar effectiveness N95 masks they’re comfortable (it uses ear loops instead strapping behind head), easier find cheaper. So, much better general use case. said, expensive regular surgeon masks offer better seal protection.

Nothing wrong surgeon masks though! personally use KN95s extra peace mind. Weak deflection justify egocentric ignorance. Probably know idea used fuel push ""just let everyone get infected hope hospitals handle it"" strategy.   It’s easy go “us vs them” route health concerns. It’s culture nowadays. :D support kicking people homes vaccination status, support landlord renewing lease. gray area think getting downvotes getting, think people really sick unvaccinated people see reason getting back normal. Totally wrong. appendix bursting releases bacteria abdomen. next several days likely experience increasingly severe infection. fricken die within hours.  facing covid, people - i.e. immunocompromised individuals - stand gain additional booster albeit rare yet unclear risks associated it. scale weighed accordingly. However, still certain whether general healthy populace need third dose. could end recommending everyone 50+ take booster keep younger population 2 doses, maybe generally decided everyone take third dose. knows - science settled yet. point pushing dogma things still air fuels anti-vaxx movement. someone young age bracket, little personal risk involved catching covid, yet received 2 vaccines regardless, would hesitate signing booster FDA deems appropriate. However, presenting half-truths undeniable truths perpetuates vaccine hesitancy keep us mess longer be.   No. best protection possible vaccinated, everyone regularly come contact (I.E. tenants) also vaccinated. still taking 500 account. number has/have referring still 1. One person five hundred died. weird, English grammar weird.  No, referring 1 person single group 500. That's title literally saying, that's conjugated. implication might 500 representative group general population, change grammatical structure sentence. Watch Mississippi, Florida's coming top spot Yep. Bianco seriously piece shit. is. think we're watching Israel right see least one approach looks like. Tbh max capacity unvaccinated patients. Leave rooms day day issues responsible. looking without trying say that. Science needs unbiased trusted look aim proving give ED science flawed  mine burst years back 3am. even walk call house cell phone wake dad rush hospital. surgeon said slept call taken hours later made it.

It pretty touch go anyway, manageable surgery team 10 days so.

If happened doubt would dead. Thats 11 times finland example avoidable tragedy, unlike first wave hit north east. Back one knew treat vaccine, monoclonal.  highly fucking doubt every single patient hospital ""pre-existing conditions"" age 45 need medical att
ention...

What type people think get hospitalized??

Sure virus 1% fatality rate. 100 1% show hospital 99 beds, that's much. single-minded focus fatalities really annoys me. far attention much larger group people survive Covid, never lead normal life again. Yes, dip quartz lavender oil activate it, put eucalyptus oil hydroxychloroquine-ivermectin-bleach cocktail. ""Bruh, that's like - 1 500. Like little 10 would ***MAYBE*** much, i'unno...""  Never thought I’d see “Nicki Minaj” “Fauci” article title.  Meanwhile social medicine, boy would survived. 

Not necessarily. Countries socialized healthcare faced resource shortages well able avoid disasters like citizens complied mask mandates social distancing, plus higher vaccine uptake. might correlation socialized medicine population overall caring fellow citizens, help avoid resource shortage first place, means immune run hospitals. Thank you! don’t think people made homeless. also don’t think people forced live around anti-vaxxers expose preventable disease. Since vaccination much, much simpler going finding home 100% vaxxed community (if community even exists), think it’s better force people first option give people choice second unreasonable risk infection, much worse outcomes vaccinated. Moderna finishing data, approval week two Pfizer. issue wanted adjust dose extra work do. 

I idea *why* wanted adjust dose... everything showing vaccine lasting longer waning, almost certainly triple Pfizer dose. might marginal benefit reducing side effects... know would reduce enough impact uptake. Certainly glad got 100ug booster.

And yeah definitely start calling 3-dose regiment instead booster. Exactly jfc. never wear mask indoors. said goodbye indoor dining forever. thought opening closing mouth, putting food drink inside strangers around thing abhorrent now. covid, nasty diseases. quite enjoyed staying well last 18 months wish masking culture covid. hospital waiting room 8+ hours case infected gallbladder. Puked hour felt better, wanted go home four hours convinced stay parent. four hours go bed finally opens up, get ultra-sounded stone inch half long, get told need surgery AM.

I spend majority stay hall covid ward. hear air alarms night long people coughing moaning pain. Thank god I've vaccinated. Wrong. US (which people talking here), article link says 800k 880k excess deaths (95%CI), factor 1.3x official covid deaths. Kicking people rental vaccinated kicking someone gender, race sexual orientation.

Being unvaccinated choice unlike characteristics mentioned above.

At point, fuck unvaccinated. lives made difficult contributing widescale pain suffering seen country decades.

Seems like raging hard-on landlords blindly argue anything provides wiggleroom choosing elect rent property to. property. Nobody answered I've asked place Reddit downvoted - can't dedicated wings hospitals dedicated either covid non-covid cases. even dedicated COVID hospitals. way fair across board. 2/3 hospital heavy covid areas dedicated covid keep vaccinated staff hand wing zero covid patients.

In past, wings/entire hospitals dedicated certain illnesses - can't here? We're point many non-covid patients suffering idiots. better system unsustainable. Gotta people willing something it, areas uppers thrilled they're that. Haha, yeah, we're thread. Glad level-headed disagreement Reddit rather flame war! Hmmm call bs that. close friend whose whole family patents, kids got covid way back June 2020. got Thanksgiving last year. Got vaccinated February husband got August. mad get getting vaccine. milder vaccine instead 2 weeks flat back one. mother however gone downhill every infection bedridden now. family 2nd know got breakthrough infections. think maybe natural vaccine immunity wane time. Boosters is! Least soon give green light them. see that. says 1 500 people died Covid USA. .002% died average. 365 people 73,000 .005 calculator correct. “1 500” number 73,000 people would 146 people dieing game holds 73,000. Unless math grotesquely off. 
Nevertheless, FDA **factually** isn’t “against” boosters. Yeah, 6 months 2 weeks. Efficacy starts waning 6 months (Pfizer), maybe even sooner. Already appointment scheduled CVS beginning October.  That’s interesting, located? Arizona/Nevada zero interruptions treatment maintenance scans throughout entire pandemic. things changes mask wearing number people room/treatment area visiting hours.   Dude, vaxxed. Delta prevalent caught July, besides that, vaxxed. We're supposed get vaccinated go sit inside alone forever? even about?! he? Last heard still pushing Ivermectin miracle drug COVID. already explained context statement following comment. reply, ""Almost certainly coming"" far cry previous deleted comment stated boosters definitely coming. small difference means world vaccine hesitant people. important reflect science exactly reflected. Anything else, disservice general public. way we're getting pandemic people bring honest honest discussion surrounding aspects situation - we'll get anti-vaxxers finally board rest us. Fauci damned credibility onslaught repeatedly throughout past year half, making contradictory statements, much larger degree American public would vaccinated. Simple. None antivaxxers get dropped. made choice denial everyone suffer it? studies place, recent ones tended put reduction risk infection type 45-75%, divergence whether got Pfizer (lower end) Moderna (upper end). would say, though, studies riddled confounders it’s hard really say. important one time goes on, start comparing vaccinated people unvaccinated previously infected people, vaccine effectiveness risk declining. complications, too. help, every bit science date indicates 5-6 months they're needed; 8 pulled thin air nothing behind it. going worse waiting 8, risk catching covid that's issue. think missed comment thread.

Article: summary, diluted Povidone Iodone mouth rinse effective preventing spread COVID dental procedures, require patient unmasked generating saliva aerosols procedure. can't speak every hospital we've putting people recliners, slapping number piece paper heads, treating like whole ER room. patients lying stretcher hallway needing O2 suction O2 valves wall, they're hugging canister connected cannula. cancelled elective procedures turn outpatient, pacu cath lab recovery beds extra ""inpatient beds"" . thought long wait times European countries socialized healthcare! /s clear, US annual death rate 4 every 500 people. 1/4 people dying covid related illness. don’t understand either. According article 22 million followers 🙄  horrible part 660k deaths reported covid ones. include heart attack, stroke, injury, etc. deaths could saved hospitals capacity understaffed.

All deaths get tossed onto ""usual"" pile ignored. saying could saved, certainly people died needlessly widely followed covid deaths. mean flawed? since things started getting really hot post-4th

My son went Destin last week June/1st July man really fell lull felt like things going back normal. Week left bomb sure go off. Think fell rational actor fallacy assumed everyone getting vaccinated soon turn like did. Hope everything's good you. Awesome, this.  IMO, Housing human right, right freedom easily preventable disease. two rights conflict here. Nobody forced live near anti-vaxxers; getting vaccinated sake neighbor’s second right much easier, cheaper safer going finding new home sake neighbor’s first right. I've tried googling one found answer. realize bit wheel house since caused virus. I've heard mrna cancer vaccines wondering MRNA endometriosis vaccine radar. even MRNA fibroid treatment. would life changing 10-25% world's population.

Anyway understanding mrna makes body recognize attack cancerous cells thinking used cancerous tumors maybe could work non cancerous tumors well. like said able find inkling research areas. dozen still lot deaths. count many infected developed symptoms. powerful, people getting reinfected 2,3 even 4 times? Sure, lot thing want. But, big picture, rolling booster shots everyone right isn’t supported science. still happen, probably?

[Reading needs stop fudging numbers. HSD/POTS/PCOS easily able get vaxxed. issues longterm.

If mutated sickly ass get it, what's excuse? Portugal small country though, impossible first world country good census. talking 500 people, would say ""each people hat"" ""each people hat"".

That sample... group 500 people

obviously 1 500 people died, would say person died

key SAMPLE entire population, group 500 people. know still getting that.. concept ""whiteness"" expanded include us Irish people purely outnumber minorities. 

""Irish need apply"" least discrimination Irish people. suffered centuries oppression, disenfranchisement, tailored cultural erasure. inspirational still sense Irishness many institutional efforts eradicate it.

And yet, say, people use Irishness (especially) Blackness. ""My ancestors slaves complain!"" comments dismiss addressing injustice.

It make less proud heritage, though. make anyone less proud. We're people. dismissive, short-sighted scapegoating bigots share ancestors undermine triumph ancestors. I'm still proud origins, even people proud origins really gross. I'm always happy meet someone wants know they're from. enjoyed it.

Sorry long reply, deep issue r/conservatard can’t comprehend.

Your choice get vaccinated wear mask absolutely affects people around you. 

They keep comparing obesity, obesity contagious? It’s thing. sure. live-streamed EUA given December 2020 Got Mississippi Delta blues... Got honest, I’ve never waited ER waiting room less hour Covid. month ago, brought wife severe concussion suffered work waited 4 hours Friday morning. absolutely crazy overwhelmed system right now. find crazy many people many underlying health issue needing hospitalised get Covid. Hopefully people learn get flu shot aswell right back hospital.  -Those questions countries need pursue booster programs, US not.

-A large study recently discussed CDC found recent time period, protection severe disease 87% everybody, 80% 60+. age stratified data sources back up. quibble need young healthy, elderly worse need unequivocal started last month.

-I think we're point people made minds. things much impact mandates. I'd also fundamentally disagree sacrificing optimal protection people *want* vaccines acceptable tradeoff getting hesitant vaccinated even principle.

-First, think important quantify substantial benefit rest world could be. people arguing ethics address this. Currently, Pfizer Moderna combined producing 300m doses per month. highest theoretical benefit 2-3 week difference skipped them, less elderly/at risk, I'm comfortable we're much already forgoing boosters required ethics, grounds we're spending 10000x much foreign aid general.

-Less one might think, especially 2-3 weeks we're talking about. Allowing immunity wane like allows many breakthroughs build full viral loads people vaccine antibodies, creating selective pressure opportunity *specifically vaccine escape*, opposed pure spread efficiency unvaccinated population. Nobody quantified much problem might be, concern, since 2-3 weeks anyway, think country better refusing boosters, benefit globally marginal. know ""whataboutism"" means? rhetorical strategy someone points problem someone else says ""yeah about...""

It's someone points someone defends landlords kicking people end lease something landlord finds unacceptable choice, like people thing.  1- first wave states started stats limp that’s irrefutable. clue treat thing. 

2- fl exported ton Souvenir cases literally know three separate families brought covid Home Florida Western PA last summer wasn’t even really bad here. One resulted cluster hospitalization small towns first covid death (she literally got sick day returning fl) 


3- isn’t fl’s numbers including residents? really sure works snowbirds. believe vaccine needed. Maternal antibodies, transferred across placenta, last 6 months. burden disease age group low. too. yet [some still virus real. Caller: Yeah, hi, love show, love hearing people's opinions, that's made country great. People. opinions. stuff. all, guns. I've people whining ""guns kill people"", guns kill people, death kills people! Ask doctor, medical fact - can't die bullet. die cardiac arrest organ failure major hemorrhage, small piece metal ain't problem. Besides, use machine-gun safety home car. ain't hurting nobody. countries guns ain't American.

Lazlow: Y-you know that's really good point. Countries guns American. know, people guns, we'd less shootings country. Opposite me. think say delta peaked 'ultimate'. Surely variants might outcompete delta. long susceptible individuals, virus continue circulate change. people vaccinated, fewer die. Using CNN’s population number averaging Economist Data, appears though figure ~ 1/390 people. real estate get scooped predatory companies, neat  natural crisis like COVID exists outside politics, outside human control. Voters responsible creation virus. Donald happened person broadest US influence crisis arose. neglected, misused, abused power various times response crisis. fucked COVID response, voters. Hundreds thousands American deaths directly attributed him. still mask mandates manufacturing job. Temp checks. Social distancing. works. 

Head spinner: I’m South. ya'll totally locked curfew? still get mask thing. EVERYONE knew time moment going said that. blatantly came said, need masks frontline healthcare workers, can't afford public buy stock crucial time. one misled made crystal clear reasoning recommendation. Hopefully Yes :( 

Jan 2020, pre COVID scare. wife illness flu-like. son 3 months old time advice nurse said flu needs Tamiflu symptoms set give best chance. 10pm, ER checked us room administered test wife brutal nasopharyngeal 3 month old. charged us admission patients doctor's time patients. Total $3,000. tests negative.  Luckily died(or unluckily depending feel suppose). two older relatives ended ICU. They're fine-ish now. Still breathing problems. One old friends still taste/smell back. like 6 months since infected. 

The funny part tried tell beginning. Wear mask public, stay 6ft away, etc. got usual ""ya ya whatever say"" shtick. almost 2 years later people either infected recovered, died. I've yet catch all. want listen paid price. Good landlord. know whataboutism relevant article? Infections vaccinated/infected recovered people occur antibodies nasal mucosa decline within months. normal happens every vaccine infection. block infections completely would require high levels antibody nasal mucosa. one human vaccine know of, HPV vaccine, block infection (for that, genitourinary tract). delta specific vaccine would answer antibodies would decline within months.   Gotta say pretty convenient US first row Let's focus China's lying covid numbers. Enough health care professionals clinical settings regularly use goggles aerosolized, airborne, diseases. So... obviously whole different situation giant platform, recently experience changed mind talk vaccine hesitant people like (and would call vaccine hesitant rather anti vax, also said she'll probably get vaccinated, necessarily disagree mandates, etc.)

I friend hesitant, heard misinformation. also scared stuff misinfo, like myocarditus, blood clots, etc. people really died result vaccine. obviously, amount harm that's done virus, correct risk assessment pretty clear. Get vaccinated. knew this, alarm bells ringing head, hard turn off. 

He expressed via text. He's good friend mine, want get confrontational it, definitely moments wanted fly newly unafraid airplanes due vaccine ass smack him. express though. calmly told stuff already knew vax way go. took while, sought advise info came right conclusion. He's two weeks past second dose days ago.

It made realize though... stranger, someone fine getting confrontational with, WOULD jumped throat moment expressed doubt... probably worked. might gotten vaccinated. confronted like that, people dig heels.

Nicki Minaj heard story scared her. hesitant. frustrating, understandable. need calm down. Calling stupid going helpful. Eh, too

The region Arklatex. Also, wanted add shows excess deaths would include excess cancer deaths due overcrowding. would also include reductions deaths reduced car accident deaths due less driving. That's way evicting people happens time. happens cases gentrification discrimination over. suddenly different dumb choice like. , What’s ratio obesity heart disease? Eh. I'm salaried hours work still comes less $12/hr (yes, that's less minimum wage live). think people celebrating longer allowing anti-vaxxers refusal vaccinate control ability live safely - especially children 12 can’t get vaccinated yet. allowing unvaccinated overrun hospitals beg every possible treatment. I'm wondering military dragging heels mandating particular vaccination time. would think protecting military members would high priority pandemic.

Choosing spread deadly infection less basic public health issue. Enough enough. MBA MD.  many using enrich schools masking vaccination mandated, likely outbreaks suspect lead abandonment person classes. university meetings scheduled month already moved online.  fictional story bible based occurred time technology resembling vaccines. ""interpretation"" bible relation vaccines made nonsense try prove incorrect belief supported evidence based science. Or, likely simply used tool influence gullible. estimate made link like COVID impact, COVID deaths. interesting worthwhile conversation, direct correlary dying COVID. 

The case **overestimate** deaths states like California COVID death death confirmed probable COVID-19 case within 60 days earliest available date among exposure confirmed case, onset symptoms, date specimen collection first positive test;  death results cause hospitalized person admission 60 days following discharge COVID-19-positive laboratory diagnostic test time since14 days prior hospitalization;  death someone COVID-19-specific ICD-10 code listed primary contributing cause death death certificate, regardless dates diagnosis death.

[This news article interviewed Oregon health official year Oregon's definition changed.

The example cited news article Oregon car crash someone tested positive COVID week dying car crash eyebrow raising preposterous process, also unlikely. However, unlikelihood example reveals possibility would happen cause death included hospitalization.  
And consider unlikely one cause death is, consider chance person would simultaneously test positive see inflate numbers.

Some 37,000 people died Oregon 2019, theoretically none died COVID. 2021 people also tested positive COVID within 14 days death, would COVID death regardless whether COVID played role (and fact, may known not)

It's global need outweighs strategic, ethical, moral scale.

Meanwhile public vaccinated want risk side effects covid brings wants protection mild infections result.

 I'm group B. think helping citizens ultimately comes first, also helping elsewhere. Selfish though may that's preferred strategy. That's would assume well. dose triggers body again. providing nearly 3x much vaccine, wonder really need dose amount moderna again. Perhaps offer smaller dose (one planned kids) booster well. Although I'm sure logistically using what's already available easier. 8f negative effects 300mg spread 3 doses, guess harm. right seems pfizer went low dose.

FIL gave daughter breakthrough case. differences Moderna Pfizer small difficult know reasons this. interval first second doses also differ may may contribution. clear recovered infected people given one dose either Pfizer Moderna incredible antibody repertoires deal variant. antivax movement long preceded Trump. would still sizable issue, though unarguably exacerbated situation. let’s pretend like agenda didn’t exist before.   mistakes made mean important question. give accurate representation (I math): 
Approximately (as last week, 8000 American deaths ago)...
78.1% USA deaths retirement age (65+)
21.8% USA deaths working age (18-64)
0.1% USA deaths children (just 500 dead children).

I think important accurately quantify things. 21.8% = 140,600. Certainly driving factor worker shortage. think driving factor worker shortage due often described ""Great Resignation"" currently in. Everyone burnt out. I'm ready quit relatively high salary gig get work remotely. I'm sure folks getting paid $8/hr flip burgers giving opportunity big fucking nope. Tent outside willingly unvaxxed. people mostly real, stories mostly accurate. exactly would expect see perfectly safe vaccine.

On typical day US, around 7800 people die. deaths affect whole network friends family deceased, looking answers happened. hit bus terminal cancer, obvious, deaths cleanly explained. people hear vaccine day/week/month got sick, races, never even spoken doctor it. thinking logically; they're grieving. someone blame, cause fight for.

And gave vaccine 70% country, course months, concentrating among older sick.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   needed Biden vaccine mandate OSHA. parts country health care system collapsed take care covid patients. vaccinated people still mask wearing indoors, even non crowded areas?

I ask I’m back work, employer isn’t requiring us wear masks. We’re small office (10 people) everyone vaccinated. person wearing mask. People wanting go (indoors, non-distanced) lunches crowding conference table. CEO giving hugs first day back, politely declined.

Am one finds little concerning? recognize may little overly cautious seems strange me. well controlled asthma, sometimes bronchitis lasts 3 4 months I’m exactly wanting catch COVID. 20 month old girl covid already I'd wait one risks identified. fully vaxxed even even smallest risk want take unfortunately. Tents outside unvaxxed unless minor immune compromised rare condition prohibiting vaccine. send hell home. gone long enough. I'd interested know. probably good data yet.

I know ""fetal cell"" argument common one used, even Vatican said that's BS, Catholics get vaccinated. kind deflates argument Catholic. AFAIK, even Protestant leaders urging people get vaccinated, apart smaller, extremist churches.

FWIW, I'm defending religious exemptions here. think they're stupid; exist all. I'm curious much problem really is. suspect media exaggerating little. Sort like run stories saying patient wait 16 hours seen emergency. (They never mention part ridiculous presentation like hangnail impacted ear wax). first 30 days show AWOL, desertion. breakthrough covid case right sucks. Like I've worse flus damn wish able get booster.  lingering thought said - severe reaction long covid scary. Uhhhh Thanks...can't read whole thing rn, that's interesting. reading contact-tracing preprints China spring 2020 documented transmission ""patient zero"" people distant bus restaurant seats, often skipping others closer in, airborne transmission seemed pretty obvious me, even US messaging focused hand sanitizer claiming one needed masks. That's cut essential indoor contact, started wearing N95s hand wildfire smoke. practice, even uptake 30-40%, huge number children. Plus, vaccination among 12-18 sped ton summer. am, higher 20-29 group.

But ultimately, FDA shit optics first place. want making decisions based that. Right, said, fair enough. proved point. best way get people cave get vaxed ban anyone able choses non-essential businesses. fair, addiction disease choice, fwiw. Smokers still receive healthcare even they’re ineligible transplants. 

They also aren’t overwhelming hospitals ICUs. 

I mean, get you’re trying say, don’t need create false equivalency order make valid point. I’ve waiting 3+ hours waiting room actively gallbladder attack (2002), actively passing kidney stone (2011), primary complaint severe chest pain (2014). get immediate EKG though. bad England then. ironic, like ""United"" states, UK aree really united COVID-19 know hospital bed logistics specifically couple reasons bad it:

1. community spread probably much higher previous waves vastly underreported. Alberta longer asymptomatic testing. believe schools also contact tracing. also lot people probably getting tested either vaccinated figure endemic (based Albertan covid messaging). 

2. believe delta increases risk hospitalizations ripping unmitigated province. 

3. Alberta rural. similar size Texas 4 million people. Edmonton Calgary major cities people one two smaller cities south, everything else spread out. means Edmonton takes ICU patients huge land area. increases need beds, also probably means people wait longer get help. effect blanket nation-wide booster recommendation vaccine hesitancy?

All important questions except one. Determining public health policy based vaccine hesitant might respond significant problem throughout pandemic. guided CDC recommendation vaccinated individuals remove masks provided us poorer data came breakthrough infections ignored CDC.  call times go up, violence rises, community grows “concerned” end it’s poor POC suffer disproportionately- that’s ok! what?? *Defunded police*. Ethics violations do. treat emergent people regardless hypocrisy selfishness. admit, used google check numbers seemed unbelievable. 

my state US crossed 300/330 barrier per million first week august. since made way 1000 even touched 1600. yes hospitals strained, perhaps full, can't imagine happening relatively low numbers not, multiplier US graphic ""only"" 1.2x-1.3x, like 1 400. get argument here.

Smoking power addicted control, therefore deny transplant?

A vaccine power jerks educate contribute society, yet put drain resources, still give new lung??

It's backwards. addiction treated such.

Those willfully harming medical system selfish choices absolutely consequences includes moving back line. 

A smoker deserves care point. forgot narcissism. chance get attention stating personal unscientific opinion something. people probably even buy get drama. reason post-disaster enough people died, conserving republican way Didn’t NY hospital stop delivering babies result? Seems like bizarre thank you.. I’m sorry y’all dealing that. wish dad speedy recovery. Globally already disease unvaccinated. Accept 101 year grandmother vaccinated Jan rushed hospital yesterday covid+ breathing issues. need boosters avoid unvaccinated shed greater viral loads. may sound cruel unvaccinated removed hospital make room people real emergencies. Nobody chooses appendicitis. think BC controlled. brother allowed go another district within BC get second opinion regarding serious health condition. referred right back clinic screwed care first place. doubt show another province demand free health care. nothing workforce wages good try know numbers know hospital employees currently get it. know percentages definitely couple them. Fair enough. we’ve wiped old people. Great… graphic, US showing excess deaths 240-260 per 100,000, COVID deaths 199 per 100,000. 

So quick math that's 1.2x-1.3x, 2x-4x. 

Other countries worse medical systems crappy reporting seem pretty tough go though. Yeah like introduction stats, going fully hypothesis testing full probability. cover lot stats applied way, even understanding bias things like that. nightmare. really curious people (like myself) fully vaccinated got Delta breakthrough. One would hope least similar levels immunity better case, able find data it. Thats last knew too. even amazing! Since antibodies stuff reaaaallly expensive. best wishes dad. Sucks guys go thru this. people selfish hypocrites.   many news articles negatives deaths, yet news articles positives people surviving beating covid....hmmm wonder why? CNN coincidence  unvaccinated COVID patients need bottom triage list. mans son busted heart, insurance won’t cover can’t afford otherwise. Takes emergency room it’s occupants hostage. (But like heartwarmingly) almost like masks lot heavy lifting people sharing enclosed spaces! think name doses Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, 3rd dose called Donatello. new people born? often accepted? numbers it? can't think religion (aside Jehovahs' witnesses invented religions last 50 years) would something teachings stating vaccines. 

If religion stated ok smoke crack attack people, get exception? different talking allowing disease flourish continue harming people could potentially stamped out? follow money/power. benefits unvaccinated? Important questions remain: 

* 2-dose protection wane differently 2 doses given apart, e.g. 8 weeks instead 3, world doing? (UK, Canada, essentially developing world due access issues). 

* protection severe disease wane age? Seems drop older people, young people? 

* effect blanket nation-wide booster recommendation vaccine hesitancy? 

* ethics giving rich countries boosters world vaccines? 

* health trade boosting protection 80% back 95%, versus vaccinating rest world slowing spread, lowers risk hypothetical ""omega"" variant vaccines actually ineffective? 

This simple issue! Oh right, actually 65% fully vaccinated, 75% half vaccinated. reason remembered number 70% fully vaccinated. Apparently COVID ravaging south getting encouraged quite people get vaccinated past Oof. Hopefully approve boosters. 

It’s time finally get ahead virus play catch up. China lies intentionally lets virus spread globally

There zero evidence this.

We know certain China communicated risks, functionality, avoid Covid spread early pandemic, back February 2020 earlier. China, Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, many countries successfully suppressed pandemic.

Pandemics inevitable. US leadership 2020 failed us killed people.

But go ahead scapegoat instead helps feel better loved ones dying misinformation. It’s dosage. subsequent vaccination leads stronger immune response. Longer intervals generally thought better. lot factors go this. yet meet anyone know anyone bad Covid experience office entire pandemic. wondering area didn’t significantly high cases like areas. part people area decent wearing masks such. Delta pretty contagious, idea spreads quickly community ""catches"" people. 

Generally speaking, unvaccinated ones practicing zero safety measures ones get caught. end *usually* quarantining, staying home (because sick) going hospital. end, they're longer target get covid (through either recovery death). 

That pulls pack targets. targets essentially gone, infection lack infection (safety measures, vaccines), case rate plateaus hopefully drops. 

***Ideally*** put measures place prevent even happening, Florida done thing. next variant comes (possibly later year, things cool), expect Florida another spike. 

Sad. could largely prevented. Um, thread topic United States. 

And can’t move past crisis control. 

And “those actually can’t get” vaccine aren’t causing problem United States. Yeah suspect density un-vaccinated specific area. 50% state vaccinated single town 1% vaccination, entire town going bloom spreader going hit area's medical infrastructure really hard. things cascade outward there.


One hand, every person saw (i.e. 50%) vaccinated, impact would much less horrific.


In words, think right. simple made cognizant seeing articles boil things single data point. case also look population density state social groups interact.

Edit: I'm saying vaccination rate important factors well. Obviously want reach point everyone get poke so.   Okay thanks advice! I'll look getting lateral flow test absolutely right, referring instance. definitely take life affecting advice celebrities. cousin FB says 100% effective. masks.

LOL  Florida also massive population, people gravitate numbers instead percentages. Yes, Florida’s percentages also bad, think Mississippi MUCH worse shape Florida, Mississippi worse vaccine rates too.  That’s is, comparison kid vs. otter pretty nonsensical.     Even 100% people retirement age, knock-on effects, especially families. lot families might counted grandma and/or grandpa child care, they're gone, one parents pick slack. think part women's numbers workforce shrunk.

(The one cold since covid started reason.) isolating completely home see select family members friends, vaxxed. not, however, hang w unvaxxed people. hang super crowded spaces (I hated like grown people much), shop slow hours people germs. germaphobe, dude... wear gloves change poopy diaper. hug friends loved ones, stay away cough feverish. Like, common sense. tiny humans cannot themselves. seems like good thing me, know 🤷‍♀️ curious even legal FL. thought DeSantis going fine people thousands dollars enforcing vaccine mandate. Maybe there's legal injunction? Hard keep what's going everywhere. Covid joke.  point, triage patients based vaccination status. can't speak others, shot available could prevent catching cold year I'd probably take it, even qualifies mild infection. 

Do think also remove yearly flu shot? need continue manufacture doses Americans massive scale flu less deadly COVID?

I necessarily issue want commit approving boosters everyone long try stop anyone wants one getting it. would hardly fault someone wanting protection statistically mild infection long plentiful supply. whole world argument gets brought out, US already world leader donated pledged vaccines, rest world combined. Heaven's no! vaccine humans, please. Typically I’m full agreement Chairman Mao re: landlords hang little longer. Almost every single Democrat US said get vaccinated Trump? need include sources stop exaggerating. 

I would surprised even one Democratic leader suggested people avoid vaccines Trump, there's idiots everywhere. 

I would astonished data showing even tiny percentage registered Democrats said would refuse vaccine Covid-19 Trump conspiracy theory. anti-vaxxers vote Democrat reason avoiding vaccines ignorance that's lasted several Administrations. reaction Trump. 

If want talk people problems talk real specific things, repeat vague impossible claims. cultural change anti-vaxxers used hippie granola people far right people really interesting there's tons interesting things discuss around put tiny bit effort in.   People wanting ""repeat customers"" surely going run going out-of-pocket blithely thinking state cover habitual incaution perpetuity. antivaxxers think fellow citizens inexhaustible patient forbearance brazen disregard everybody else's safety. Lol making mad excuses like “sorry babe, feet warm” 😂 ""The vaccine shit pants.""  sadly completely agree. noted someone above, hospitals doctor called likely multiple COVID patients ventilators virtually chance recovery likely died anyway. man gallstone pancreatitis perfect example would need come play. someone severely life threatening condition completely treatable high likelihood success done timely manner. COVID patient ventilator 3 weeks (unvaccinated not), rationing care situation presents itself, virtually guaranteeing 2 deaths instead saving 1. It’s decision anyone make, are. people dying decisions made. vaccinated good enough  Archived   want kid animal vaccine created company makes medicine animals? think does. answered it.  
It like saying ejaculations count intercourse. Same. Floridian. Spouse works high risk job, constant close contact public, one vaccinated, everyone works strongly anti-precaution. Doses going waste live. 

How feeling? feel bit gross, think I'm also dealing anxiety. fair, meningitis bacterial vaccine (as elaboration different). target protein antigen way viral vaccine dose toxin protein way DTaP does. give anyone post 6 months Pfizer's second dose wants it. Jeez, what's big deal. It’s shame people die don’t get chance warn us bad is. hear stupid chirping idiots haven’t got sick yet, chirping ones chirping underground expect main concern people considering Ivermectin substitute currently approved vaccines. 

Don't confuse absence evidence evidence absence. Calling doctors ""random whackos"" ad hominem attack. concern off-label use dangerous, I'm sure research done yet. FDA approved drug, prescribed licensed physician appropriate doses assume know better. 

For example, Vitamin supplementation remains unproven way reduce hospital stay duration - doctor recommends patient, considering safety concerns, may justification.    think public places allow indoors reason. bad can't unvaccinated people.  possible solution vaccine mandate system requires eligible students, hospital workers public workers vaccinated well vaccine mandate big social events like NHL games. Otherwise pandemic drag continue strain hospitals. Canadian provinces going require 80% population vaccinated low natural immunity. Canada actually one lowest death rates world countries reliable data means lot susceptible people virus.  FDA briefing doc here: (pdf) VACCINE MANDATE HOSPITAL ADMITTANCE COVID SYMPTOMS!!!!!

Unless cannot get vaccine due pre existing HEALTH conditions.

So sick bullshit. Kn95 plus fully vaccinated good enough right? Someone store coughed like 2 feet away unmasked, covered elbow walked right direction coughed thinking much I'm furious. may covid cases high area I'm in.  would nice see data linked education level per state look number say “0.2% chance death” think it’s big deal. 

Shows bad people estimating risk, critical thinking, avoiding cognitive bias. unfair. Whatever reason decided get vaccinated require heartless comment. need judge decision, whatever may be.  got hit late first night. Holy shit chills. actions likely violate Florida law bans businesses requiring proof vaccination condition service. Florida Department Health likely drop hammer landlord soon story getting covered widely. took CDC months recognize aerosolized airborne. starting deal ventilation buildings instead putting useless plexiglass shields checkout lanes. “Will” lot work here. Could theoretically happen? Yes. likely happen? even close. likely severe? Nope again.  clog hospitals? 
no. amazing getting lambasted citing actual study context someone saying ""vast majority"" people ventilators die. 35.7% people mechanical ventilation due respiratory failure consequence SARS-CoV-2 infection terrible number matter swing it. However, implication, based conjecture, \~80%+ (or whatever interpret ""vast majority"" as) people go ventilators die, completely unfounded statement

Obviously hard hospital, hospitals area, impacted resources/staff available play factor. one saying otherwise. responding to, responding false allegations ""vast majority"" individuals go vents end dead.

I also point one making effort find recent study gives better number, totally open to.

Side note, thanks continuing work ICU setting despite everything happened. wife bedside nurse well taken quite toll mentally physically co-workers. Well went BS, ""It 99.96% SuRvIvAl RaTe"" statistic utter morons liked throw around, 0.2% entire US population died COVID.  might hard. DeSantis governor pursuing similar policies. He's well known governs much bigger state. FL's vaccination rate close national average. several large urban areas quite blue. really see FL (or TX) overtaking states like MS, LA, AL, AS. every socioeconomic metric, typically ones close bottom, whereas FL (and TX) least mixture better performing urban areas rest. ER taking antivaxxers. full stop.   heartbreaking. Makes feel really sad honest. Life eh! Yes do, arbiter grammar here. agree things sound weird also agree grammar dictates sound so.

The whole ""are native English speaker"" thing played out, way. I've met plenty non-native speakers better control grammar you. know responsible deaths. I’ve looking something like this, thank you!  Ok, thanks. also, really... important eat inside restaurants hang subway station unmasked considered mentally ill? Yeah, it’s increased chance catching COVID concerns me.

I mentioned nurse expecting place COVID circus. gave nervous half smile said “yeah, you’d think that”  forgotten started imposing total lockdowns instead sticking ""flattening curve"". intentionally unvaccinated wrong hurting everyone causing this. 

Yep. workers unvaccinated also wrong. 

Nope. Full stop. 

YOU wrong rest post non-starter.

This ER situation fucking lethal. knew COVID going mess reported China emergency-speed building massive pop-up hospitals Wuhan. CODVIDiots get massive, pop-up hospitals every stadium. fucking decide: precious sports vaccine. Even today? like NY months ago I'm starting notice lot masks now. Close 50/50.  It’s done California. 2 yr olds wear masks. kids better others it, overall 2 yr olds much compliant masks expected. need mental help. Plus I'm really beginning think people either forgotten cook never learned, often going restaurants anyways? go maybe every couple weeks. even precovid, often would take go family prefers company home I'm wearing rest life. I'm wearing public indoor situations.

The amount time I'm forced spend indoor public situations small.

Grocery shopping? Well I'm eating drinking anyway.

At crowded show/bar winter? Absolutely covering face. I've gotten sick exact situations.

Eating out? favorite restaurants covered oytdoor seating point.

Hanging friends backyard house? Well hanging sick vaxxed covid anyway. masking here.

Outdoor shows oytdoor activities like horseback riding regular? I'm worried getting sick outdoor situations. never gotten sick someone barn, oytdoor shows held flu season.

The month person meeting work? work state required vaxxed. Still, I'll wear mask case anyone cold/flu.

Biontech mrna flu cold vaccines pipeline. likely see majorly effective vaccines coming available next couple years.

It's also really many situations I'll wearing masks in. yeah, I'll keep wearing masks. say ""for rest life"" pretty major exaggeration people. simply big deal people mask indoor public spaces. Unless mask whimps, annoying people anyway yeah let em get sick that's want do.  mention potential long term issues. 

Of course jury still that, vascular, kidney, lung, cognitive, ace2 stuff pretty easy concerned long term hits covid even vaccinated. Winter months. plenty beautiful outdoor dining options state husband parents siblings live Florida. grew there, moved away done college. families constant state-of-mind ""oh, bad,"" ""at least deal winters!"" ""You're negative make us look bad!"" old people thing: can't admit choice made eons ago live Florida may best one. (Really, like settling one place never changing problem.)

We moved Canada. universal healthcare, really nice weather (I mind snow winter since live apartment, like seasons), legal recreational weed, cars (we live city public transportation), we're much safer covid Florida (we visited summer, NUTS there). Every day thankful moved here. bit science date indicates 5-6 months they're needed; 8 pulled thin air nothing behind it

As someone coming 6 month anniversary second shot couple weeks, really bothers me. Also, seems FDA/CDC really needs take account amount travel/interaction take place Thanksgiving/Christmas/NYE - 8 month timetable Americans getting booster holidays. would assume house prices would go least wages go up. Remember biggest argument America’s healthcare system supposed “insane wait times” countries? Funny tables turned many stories like next months…Winter coming……   rarely. Vaccinated people rarely get sick rare circumstances stay infectious day two.

The unvaccinated going get sick much, much higher rates infectious longer. Hospitals year get together. Pay money needed keep hospitals staffed. Instead, hospitals cutting costs everywhere. Ivermectin paste hydroxychloroquine treatments sale lol kid anaphylaxis food allergies. could need hospital anytime eats. super careful manufacturers make mistakes. idea can't get care needs infuriates me. barely speak antivaxxers family right now. long don’t overwhelm infrastructure get sick. they’re willing stay home pray burn sage whatever instead filling hospitals don’t see anything wrong that. sorry dad, I’m grateful able stent vaccine protected him. Hope he’s recovering well  I'm curious symptoms are. I've problems since late June/early July still process figuring out. tender lymph nodes chest groin abdominal/back pain two persistent symptoms. abdomen/pelvis CT scheduling colonoscopy now. I'm turning 30 year feels like body falling apart lol. I'm wondering much problem hospitals notoriously understaffed. American hospitals profit top dogs purposefully understaff ""save money"" (i.e. give millions dollars bonuses every year).

But yeah, initially sympathetic towards people afraid vaccine, I'm it.  statement living poverty **while researching mRNA**

Her discovery 2005 way BioNTech hired 2013. disputed statement calling total bullshit. She’s senior VP BioNTech    current post: 1 500 US residents died Covid-19. Florida probably worse  think anti-social understatement considering swore ever eating restaurant haha. Therapy would beneficial.  Comply. Comply. Comply.  Somehow ended one ""The Pope Dope"" stickers. I'm even Catholic. kept it. pretty cool. could see post-pandemic certain situations, like wearing mask crowded public transit middle cold &amp; flu season. I've reddit 2 years I've antisocial decades I'm sure point stands Well said. I'm glad I'm charge anything geared towards helping people. even let unvaccinated hospitals, waste resources.  That’s finally become believers unfortunately. unvaccinated filling hospitals real risk everyone. unvaccinated infect unvaccinated aren’t eligible vaccines - US that’s children 12.

I guess person doesn’t care health care stability (or health care workers) sick (or sometimes dying) children, don’t see danger unvaccinated. Certainly vaccinated glorious selfishness don’t care others.

Also - contradict saying vaccinated threat -yet infect vaccinated. reconcile two completely opposite points head? Reddit’s anti-social behavior never ceases amaze  add that: always 'leak' new measures Sunday know address backlash time official announcement made later. actual leaking all. know people went CVS problems. Buddhist’s claim religious exemption doesn’t mean to. Generally thoughtful people make wise choices. That’s hope, teach high school kids eligible vaxxed lot already. technically need get 80% school population remove mask mandate I’m hoping that’s soon.  Well, yes, number total deaths likely go down. vaxxed people sick tired feeling like you’ve done part fo whatever want:

This problem. sucks it’s frustrating could still come back bite ass different way. think I'm walking around house mask on? see problem wanting breathe people's breath public spaces.  never cared begin with, somehow realize bad things delta, think made begin with, simpleminded people never understood ""flatten curve"" concept begin with, heard succeed (somewhat) flattening before, think jobs done. It’s hard read info stuff you’re wearing ass like hat 🤷‍♂️  It’s hard read info stuff you’re wearing ass like hat 🤷‍♂️  People consult PCP this. don’t one would give pause whether needed exemption.  “Soon”?  Cant help remember conservatives claimed universal healthcare would lead long wait times.

Turns projection future. went ER piece rebar chest.

Waited 3 hours looked at.

This 2014.  Preferably hospital beds needed responsible patients.  one wondering haven’t built hospital capacity last two years? beginning pandemic, it’s can’t see surges coming.  dude check out, apparently jermophobes total need rehab. really idea people take simple decision weaponize much. Like, restaurant boards something? Many death likely people medical conditions turned away due hospital shortages, people afraid go hospital. 

They may directly killed covid, still played factor deaths. Immunity simple counting antibodies. Therefore, suggestion impractical. It’s impossible. Oh, must've missed that. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

There's plenty good weather live eat outdoors feel like home months. Plus, people cook anymore? Nah. enjoy taste crayons like marines. Unvaxxed = untreated. lawyers going field day  Due respect, lambasted implication cited article. outdated relevant current covid-19 cases. Delta dominant strain, wild type primarily present early last year.

u/acorns50728 stated ""Vast majority covid delta patients die put vent - things read r/nursing""

Your response: ""Actual number closer 35%, OK""

The implication: covid-19 delta variant patients intubated approximately 35% mortality rate.

It suggests narrative may held water year half ago different strain covid, much changed interventions utilized predominant variant longer applicable article cite discussing current cases delta.

If want lambasted future, may offer rephrasing:

""I read article Critical Care Medicine (peer-reviewed journal) found 165 patients requiring intubation month half evaluated, mortality rate reported 35.7 percent (n=56). Granted last March - mid April, could still relevant current strains?""

Secondly, say ""vast majority""? No. said intubated patients cared ICU experience. expert experience, one data point. purpose behind mentioning aggregate expert experience contradicts article's month half. 

""However, implication, based conjecture, \~80%+ (or whatever interpret ""vast majority"" as)"". fair point hard numbers support claim, tossing ""\~80%+"" kind along lines concerns sourcing article. making conclusions based surface level information assumptions may accurate. 

As far articles, want lit review mind, take longer last 10 minutes break it.

Full disclosure left bedside couple weeks ago work home job wife kid needed closer home. Tell wife alone I'm sorry (and extension) still experiencing this...I still found right words describe frustration, pain, anger, trauma come close.   Yes assuming triage based antibodies, rather vaxx status, we'd able set aside 20 beds remain ER patients. someone anti-bodies, either vaxx date body able produce antibodies, would able get jabbed booster. 

This would stupid antibodies stick around forever. someone COVID year ago antibodies unless recent current infection. someone antibodies could mean recently got vaccinated current infection. current infection antibodies, could still vaxxed unvaxxed. see presence antibodies useful triage Furthermore, ER issue surgeries treatments falling behind. 

Both falling behind. ER wait times area went 15 minutes average 4+ hours. ERs ambulances lined beds inside patients, means someone calls 911 ambulance available get them.  Yup. worry though, somebody diagnosed interwebs germaphobia.. Apparently need seek help.  really. second cousin mine jaundiced ill, went hospital medi-flighted hospital ~6 hours away different state hospitals full (oklahoma)   Yep, dad's health insurance still fairly crappy. Even (expensive) health insurance think ended $10,000+ range.

Which know ""cheap"" still. instead supposed say sorry can't get treated kid whose appendix burst? Sorry fuck noise. legitimately cannot understand position especially health care worker. account people died weren’t vaccinated could been? total bullshit. She’s senior VP BioNTech, company half billion dollars revenue per year. Everyone thread had. There's lot context it. one, gone ER year earlier really bad abdominal pain. false alarm, turns basically constipation, maybe mild food poisoning. doctors nurses treated like hypochondriac, mocked hallway within earshot room, sent home multiple-thousands dollar bill.

So awful abdominal pain again, waited lot longer go ER experience fresh head.

It also one largest snow storms years, polar vortex midwest 2013. time realized *really* bad close foot snow ground blizzard conditions dropping inch hour. insurance time cover ambulance rides quite grasped severity situation, thought could wait stop snowing major roads get plowed. Eventually called sister boyfriend came picked took hospital. 

So context *did* nearly sit house writhing complete agony becoming septic, 10-year-storm blizzard instead Star Wars OT. Alright, upon research, looks like usages acceptable context. either strictly look subject singular ""1"", can, like said, acknowledge ""1 500"" phrase referring multiple people.

Removing prepositional phrase always lead use correct verb form, realize necessarily correct verb form every context.

I'll keep mind going forward, thanks! That’s lot questions once.

1. person physically can’t get vaccinated, absolutely exempt.
2. rights contradict other. can’t stand situation.
3. wouldn’t describe “convenience”, given time, effort, money risk associated finding new home. even matter convenience, else equal, easier choice win out. Get vaxxed vs. move morally better choice offer get exposed vs. move out. guess I'm little envious things going well enough find post frightening.

But topic: yell fire crowded theater. direct people exits. drive ambulance, ignore instincts never exceed speed limit, statistics show save patients. 

There huge body literature public health policy. None begins ""tell public everything moment hear zero context."" Conflating contextualizing data withholding real problem, particularly US. Looks like unvaccinated. looks like 3.7b august alone. see rising people move inside fall.

Edit: 2 that’s cost healthcare system. 
Reading fundamental kids. I'm NYC I'm seeing anything social circle now, couple non-serious breakthrough cases. two people knew professionally died soon first lockdown started. 

I think people New York really careful still got hit hard first vaccines one even knew treat people got it. know people highly vaccinated areas careful be. got back road trip vacation New England. ready show vaccine card restaurants bars whole time, nobody asked. tried wear mask whenever ordered food talked directly strangers sometimes staff even wearing masks. Even 70% vaccination rate, that's lot unvaccinated adults plus 100% kids plus worse variant. like medium bad compared Florids's pouring gasoline head lighting match bad.

I felt upset uncomfortable while. I'm glad home. I'm still going bars restaurants like many people feels safer wearing masks talking people, people still keeping distance possible, people asking vaccine cards going inside. fitness/transmission improvement likely due P681R mutation furin cleavage site (which likely requires mutations delta NTD elsewhere).

There's still reason believe ""on paper"" FCS yet optimal compared known human coronaviruses FCS.

There's also vitro evidence cell lines expressing hACE2 known pangolin spikes 50-100 times better entry cells B.1.1.7 (speculated due optimizations deeply disconcerting given we're still handing lottery tickets virus (particularly sending kids back school unvaccinated enhances spread rest unvaccinated). second wave 1918 H1N1 killed lots 20 year olds cautionary tale paying attention to, know happened still can't rule happening now, seem almost going way test possible coronavirus that.   That’s mostly correct, except antiviral effects ivermectin (which much anti-parasitic) weak enough it’s useful COVID-19. Effectiveness = (rate unvax - rate vax) / rate unvax *100

So, effectiveness serious illness 60+ 78.8%, booster 97.3%. inch little since antibodies continue increase bit short followup window. 

Under 60 serious illness is... wait 73%?? *Lower* 60+ crowd? 90.5% booster? 

This seems little suspect... certainly diverging previous numbers. wonder kinds demands landlords make evict people comply. looks like slippery slope nobody happy about.  you’re saying it’s cold hard fact roughly 1,657,246.405 died USA Covid? seems everywhere else putting number little less 1/2 number? sign lease, agreement landloard yourself. sign unit X amount time. more, less. time up, landlord decide whether want continue business other. landlord want continue businesses anymore, that's right. consequence unified. extremely sad. immune systems probably shot sleep/stress taking care newborn. excusing choice vaccinated, still sad. poor children. chance link without paywall? That’s percentages work. 1 500 0.2%. convert fraction percentage, divide multiply result 100. (1/500)x100 = 0.2   decided don’t care. 

And continue care long society continues bend backwards sacrifice protect entitled asses. promising research underway regarding better anti virals covid?  Jesus Christ. many Theoretically officials could base restrictions whether individuals either medically-certified proof vaccination medically-certified proof active antibodies. hospitals shoulder blame. could keep ICU beds open non Covid patients don’t. Why? government guaranteeing payment hospitals every Covid patient treat. Keep ICU beds open non Covid patients may get filled people don’t health insurance hospital takes loss treating them. 10 days hospital drain

You lucky go bankrupt crappy American healthcare system prioritizing profits health too! everyone else, particularly weaker immune system, greater risk interacting unvaxxed person vaccinated person. isn’t issue one person’s choice affects themself. fair county rule follow. shows.

I've heard lot stories like nothing unvaccinated Covid patients turned away.  They're prioritized. person can't get vaccinated whatever reason? rights cancel out? one right trump another based convenience scenario? prescribed doctors help Covid symptoms.

Why still entertaining shit? What? genuinely scares believe this, given probably live country equal voting power.  housing extremist think housing commodity One right must cancel right situation, since two contradict other. Since getting vaccinated simpler, easier less risky virtually anyone trying move safer place, point right get preventably exposed COVID wins out. mention definition ""minor"" ""mild"" exceptionally broad. laid bed ten days without smell taste energy, pull without hospital visit, congratulations, mild case. long Covid? We're counting that.

Fuck. These. People. 

Stop bogging resources sick people choice. Poor kids. Dumb parents. kicking tenants house, allowing renew lease. “As August 15th, new tenants must show proof vaccination moving in. … Existing tenants must show proof vaccination leases renewed.” 

Depending type unit county/state live in, landloards required renew lease.  think actually encourage behavior.

Remember years ago people arguing $5 billion cost 10 years farrr high price pay nationalized healthcare option? think solution divert covid symptoms national guard covid field hospitals. world perfect, unlimited, resources, idea giving everyone booster shot right could possibly supported science. Please come back reality though, it’s really bad I'm advocating take people ventilators...

And yet, ventilators key area medical shortage right now. 

80% covid patients go ventilator recover. ventilator may postpone death little while, usually save them. 

And chance successfully weaned vent goes longer vent. two weeks, young, healthy person real chance transitioning breathing own. 

Taking care somebody ventilator requires LOT staff resources. need ICU nurses respiratory therapists help people 20% chance survival. 

Hell, even supplies like oxygen drugs needed vent patients short supply hard-hit states.

So yes, Covid triage absolutely include taking people vents.

If people like that, get vaccinated happen them. Addictions cured though.

Edit:spelling Oh please. Maybe you’d happier, pleasant person stopped judging feeling inclined think know everything everyone. great life, one day possibly figure to. Vegetable oil works, get moisturizing soap  allow religious exemptions.

I assumed RSV distinguishable virus. So, seems clear one came RSV ***or*** Covid difference would clear. confirm, think saying symptomolgy sufficiently different one presented RSV ***and*** positive Covid able differentiate patient symptomatic thus effectively RSV case Covid positivity would counted Covid vice versa. Clinical trials way. could given EUA end 2021. blatantly true. Sounds like someone wanted excuse herpes whatever. ""Fauci Deflates Nicki Minaj's 'Big Balls' Claim"" never work without minimum 5cm piece rose quartz! Moderna already recommending boosters... Health insurance companies going get fed cover covid treatment. doubt fudging numbers actually collecting everything be. Yeah dumb me, go tedious stuff like actual definitions words rather made shit win internet argument stranger.

Capacity. Noun. maximum amount something contain. think virus made lab passed animal?

Also, think covid something we’ll live forever? think know enough common cold CoV extrapolate. past year found common cold CoV undergo antigenic variation, likely plays reinfection scenario. think key SARS-CoV-2 well rounded antibody response, like occurs infection followed one vaccine dose. individuals make antibodies neutralize variant. think variant-specific booster needed that. general think booster dose good idea, unless show induces type broad antibody protection enjoyed recovered/vaccinated people. known months. airborne, aerosol transmission. service type job Florida must hell right now. sympathy. combo covid kids getting RSV first time. RSV one endemic viruses everyone gets 1-3. lot kids getting exposed first time year, dodged past 1-2 years isolation masking. vaccine give big balls! could also hiccup reporting testing. People usually wouldn’t go get tested holidays. Yup pains facking stupid people going long start kicking unvaccinated covid patients Yes, please call cps. exist. I'm sorry even position. Hugs Texas 🤗 breakdown income bracket? agreeing failure leadership? ;) [**Crisis standards care guidelines stipulate deemed need care likely benefit placed priority lists scarce resources, ICU beds**. means patient requires ICU care, someone else may removed ventilator make  thing I'd add contraindications history myocarditis provoked vaccine. 


But yeah, besides that, contraindications. actually know I've ever recommended someone get COVID vaccine. cousin's friend might want get tested STDs Wow, haven’t heard work place unvaccinated. would keep head down, don’t get involved topic comes up, wear mask indoors. covid hit bubbles it’ll spread like wildfire.  Go hospital anti vax. Per CDC (US), public space indoors, county substantial high transmission, wear mask regardless vaccination status. sure small office 10 people considered public. check county’s current transmission level here: opinion: 10 people, indoors eight hours, five days week? I’d wearing mask unless knew beyond doubt every single one careful outside office. use calculator evaluate certain activities safe…you play variables, including personal tolerance risk (the default pretty conservative) determine whether given activity good idea particular area.

Given asthma, I’d also suggest checking doctor recommended situation. think hard respiratory infection. completely block virus infection would need high levels antibody mucus maintained long vaccination infection. infected virus days reproduce immune memory kicks limits infection. key much virus shed, would determine transmission. human papillomavirus vaccine block infection totally therefore transmission. knew could applied viral vaccines.  shit. wouldn’t want great vaccines fast possible problem Democrats we’re afraid come election would help Trump started discrediting vaccines then. Everyone wanted vaccines soon possible pushing approved fast possible lot people already kids many also grandkids. genes still gene pool.

The relevant pool voter pool. forget prayer warriors help pray illness away curiosity, KN95 masks specifically? Yeah think situation anything else. dual citizen living states (with decent health insurance, saying US ""better"" trust me) always amazed wait times family friends deal north compared here. Seems Canadian system highly stressed normal times. question would whether extra doses would actually go third world whether expire. Thx m8 approve boosters immunocompromised elder, right? watching experts Israel say fourth booster eventually, think safe, want get Moderna. Username checks haha you’re vaccinated covid get a** hospitals Clustring big role. State rates overly simplistic. working Southern Illinois. wave worst yet. vaccination rate county 30%. Illinois overall bad. Good point. haven’t needed police enforce NYC - good thing among worst anti-maskers - people generally comply own. That’s said one time look 50 times said wouldn’t take vaccine approved Trump watch videos YouTube it’s hard find stupid gullible probably curable addict. 

It’s probably “in power” people educate addict “just stop smoking.”  Research what? fucking research random dumbass med training going do? People need stop fucking researching things listen experts. Triage. maximum hospital capacity reached patients “least gain” treatments de-prioritised. That’s cold hard logical way maximize use whatever healthcare resources available left public good.

Those little hope recovery (eg unvaccinated covid-19 patients ICU) dropped similarly lethal chances without treatment much better odds treatment (eg burst appendix). Someone correct wrong, percentages relative unvaccinated people.

So say J+J 65% effective reducing trips ER, mean 35% chance going ER catch Covid.

I think means unvaccinated person 10% chance catching COVID going ER, J+J people 3.5% chance, 65% less 10%.

Again, correct wrong. think important people understand this, true. think big tents cots good enough...

They took US Population divided total deaths. Must taken weeks.  shot mixing studies done appear safe. Mixing adenovirus vaccine mRNA, example, appears work well studies. doc suggested JJ would it.  already posted Further, terrible source reposting articles reputable sources. also appears source post repeatedly Reddit, consider final warning self promotion allowed (rule 7).  comes high risk people mild symptoms though. know high risk people higher number admitted ICU. seems like FDA ignoring saying either boosters everyone one nuance this. (At least current messaging point know article says review 17th)  No, said trust take based recommendation, would take based scientific community's recommendation. Pleases stop lying distorting truth. immediate family member mine died this. Needed ICU non terminal event able get one. spent lifetime working ass lifting abject poverty position wealth know why. spend last dollar legally pursuing Ron DeSantis homicidal policies directly caused death. hyperbole. anyone aware similar suits brought forward please inform me. believe misreading it. state Covid deaths like 200, excess deaths like 240 260. Add 200 get 440 460. 2.2x 2.3x original value. saying 1.2x-1.3x *more*. Example: originally 100. Actual value 200. 200 two times *as many* 100, also one time *more than* 100.

You always say health issues concerns (bronchitis) prefer wear mask.  30 year old brother underlying health conditions got Moderna shots May year.

But we’re realizing much actually believe misinformation conspiracy theories, worried children’s safety comes health. 
We’re starting speak family members try get something started, maybe visit kids see are. look healthy. 

We don’t truly believe *yet*, worried. parents following everything else group people tend do. hoping they’re skipping ivermectin step, don’t see would believe everything else? 

Im calling county’s CPS office today see beginning steps take. not? Shit even hospital? convinced immune system bullet proof danger fucking stay home. Would love see varies state remember events now, problem thought trump pushing get vaccine election far know, countries removed restrictions soon vaccination started. state Brazil, allowing gatherings 500 people like, 2 3 months, since week, 1000 people.

It's just, vaccination rates improved lot last 2 months so. 

Uruguay Chile stands 73% fully vaccinated, example. Brazil 67% first dose 35% fully vaccinated, Argentina 63% first fully 41%.

Ecuador 60% first dose 54% fully.

Dominican Republic 54% first 44% fully.   
Colombia 48% 31%.

So still long way go, consider several countries latin america big infection rates previously... number people antibodies probably quite big. would presume that? countries wanting vaccines ASAP. Besides BioNTech German. EU acting industry.

Add -Sarnoff CureVac haven’t even produced vaccine.

Similar Australia - relying heavily vaccine abandoned produced false HIV positives. Look getting vaccines. rate going soon reach easy understand numbers, like 1 50 states dead I'm simple peasant trying play Gotcha suggesting someone's basic arithmetic valid unless right occupation. Ok, well moved goal post quite bit there. say 90%. Literally one minute ago ""at capacity"" taking advice you, thanks. people best immunity! Infection one dose makes high affinity antibodies block infection variant many coronaviruses. Really remarkable.  could SARS-CoV-2 evolve? Hard predict, one possibility virus changes every year, like influenza virus. people infected, virus might change. might make new vaccine every years. However common cold coronaviruses change every 8 years make vaccines infections mild. could population immunity increases, COVID-19 becomes mild cold.

I think five years still scars pandemic changed many things world. think pandemic annual outbreaks COVID like influenza. vaccines prevent severe disease death.  vibin’ easy fact look up. ICU capacity always 90% plus capacity.

Clearly concept provincial health systems.

ICU capacity increased needed. probably get bike.. Or, tell first. often works. video saying wouldn’t trust take vaccine approved Trump guess vaccines approved Trump  want Joe do?

I know actual sources, perhaps least explain think motivation even book - written journalist Joe Miller collaboration BioNTech’s founders Dr Ugur Sahin Dr Özlem Türec - lobbyists branded Pfizer “the epitome cold capitalism” claimed: “If give one euro CureVac, Sanofi, European company, one euro Europe. give BioNTech, 50 cents always end known impact lobbying effort had. However, European Union ordered doses Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine last November efficacy data jab published - nearly five months UK instead said favoured vaccines developed French company Sanofi German business CureVac. yet come bosses claimed lack support EU developing jab, saying business felt “on own” according book, concern. could least open boosters people live ineligible vaccine. insane still considering fact. I've something similar addition swab comes kit using clean ordinary q-tip swab additional person tested avoid infecting swabs used, wiping additional swabs initial swab inserting test fluid.

Also really enjoyed podcast Lex Fridman!  unvaccinated students get sick? Sign man. Right cut hair medical shots. None 'optional'.

this non-news story. ER nurse, beginning constant message people stay home covid symptoms unless felt dying. Now, everyone comes matter what. People come get tested runny nose. totally slows everything diverts care/resources. it’s worth, goalpost help reduce hospitals overwhelmed. asked “how best test immunity” know *get vaccinated* correct answer. I'm going write state legislators Governor, members Congress President Biden, probably health insurance company, demand unvaccinated adult qualifies vaccine goes back line emergency room. allow people deliberately endanger others poor decisions. I'm going suggest National Guard brought set facilities/tents treating unvaccinated, adult covid patients emergency rooms ICUs freed vaccinated patients. insane put unvaccinated covid patients ahead vaccinated people sick, injuries, heart attacks, strokes, etc. Seriously, scumbag.  start refusing treatment unvaccinated covid patients? let good people die stupidity others? confirm. Elderly relative heart catherization three weeks ago. seen results, three canceled appointments due Cardiac team overloaded, sick themselves. Well, obviously (contributing to) overwhelming *certain* healthcare resources. enough transplants everyone, care smoke not. comparison really far fetched. Yh best call doctors find out. He's definitely way overdue considering well past 12 week gap UK knows doctors may say fine

Curious though finally come round wanting get 2nd dose? Well, are. Source: grandma’s quack doctor (who MD) prescribed ivermectin. It’s probably common occurrence they’re wrong. ""50k verse, album out""...then one bought album So, group followed longer period time (those immunized Jul-Oct) higher number breakthrough cases?

Colour shocked! Bola de pendejos. I'm surprised affecting latino community, latinos work kind customer oriented job choice interact public. real issue vaccine conspiracies rampant latin social media. There's popular instagram called latinoswithattitude inundated vaccine conspiracy junk every time anything covid posted. many latino's gladly got vaccines country origin dusty clinics suddenly hissy fit covid vaccine. weird. Ah yes, grifters side take advantage bought bullshit, there's least slight distinction. good faith, exploit deluded among sinking, coughing, ship. I’m sure that’s something celebrating can't find PT pants, wear dress pants.  Ayeee!!! This. discussions happening nothing whether immunity wanes time booster restores it, that's true without doubt. discussion ethical question whether first doses going people Africa third doses go people US Europe. fine discussion, honest it, mislead language like ""boosters needed"". Worse? mean better!!


/s cloth masks kids pandemic theater, placebo effect quite powerful maybe helps? Oh please. Everyone knows need follow shot bleach. situation describing non-issue. anxiety talking here. safe. kind person would want claim medical exemption sort bring yorkie wearing ""service dog"" vest restaurant watch shit floor. They're going doctor shop. lets move Barbados guys.... sounds safer rational. know place shit together like Possibly 6 7 dead people Mississippi could saved Vermont-like COVID policy behaviors.

Not entirely apples apples due different lifestyle factors, bet impact much..  That’s extremely unethical. Care given needs it, regardless circumstances got it. alcoholics refused treatment addiction? drug addicts? smokers? promiscuous individuals get STI? see, point healthcare everyone equal matter circumstances receive appropriate therapy. Anything morally wrong drives away people getting care need feel like going like masks aerosol spread - they're going dink around haver make unlikely suppositions iron-clad data form disaster becomes apparent \*then\* they'll tell us boosters good idea. Every time anyone talks successful pandemic response seem say, ""go early, go hard"" yet US many resources always ""go late half-ass it"".

In terms getting vaccines rest world: One big thing could is, like, let IP protections lapse rest world could make affordable generics. increase supply, feebly pass around 500,000 vaccines million there. Yes, takes time set vaccine factory, okay, yes, would great six months ago next best time now.  cruel, humane. resources limited, save lives treating listen medical advice.

Saving COVID deniers cost people behave well cause deaths long run. thing applies alcoholics liver transplants. think rationally. time empathy.

COVID deniers deserve saved resources to. don't, kicked hospitals. Exactly. think pandemic revealed crappy hanging thread health care system really is. Generally yes, analogy came Lothar H. Wieler, president german Robert Koch Institute (RKI). capacity, advises German Federal State Governments topics public health, especially infection hazards, containment COVID-19 pandemic.

So, knows hes talking about.  like Ivermectin studies showed maybe possibility something there, later retracted, right?

Here's another study posted one authors listed. Vitamin C cure covid too? crazy ingesting horse paste, might work! took hundred years something like happen again. That's lot wasted space drive cost healthcare. I'd rather FEMA adequately prepared spin field hospitals. I'd say true vast amount people. past year half clearly shown poor judgment intelligence western society. Give vaccine toddler give booster I’m less likely bring something home her. tell protection “severe disease” adequate want, I’m thinking health — want children protected. Jesus. fair, die, cant correct it. Seems like would breach lease agreement, no? best country world. Uh-huh, sure. American way. still worried fomites?  Yeah I'm UK. appreciate response anyway. think going best friend call doctors. Well use half much booster 2x vaccine available boosters. vote4any right, generally speaking dont get medical advise reddit. checked German Permanent Vaccination Commission (STIKO) FAQ [because im german evidence scientific reasoning similar countries] mention scenarios longer breaks shots saying vaccination started again. 2nd shot conclude immunization regardless. Exactly, point every mention deaths clear delineation: vaccine widely available, after.

The former tragedy, understandable. latter far far worse interesting thing story it’s almost identical one article.

The article mention rate occurrence COVID, what’s actually important.

Yes yes, people get vaccinated that, article garbage reporting. anecdote mean evidence. I’m guessing pediatric surgeon busy COVID patients… zoned ""Nicki Min......"" problem is, hospitals that. They're turning away perfectly treatable emergency cases go find another hospital rather ejecto seat covid patient that's never walking room again. :( government directly provide housing everyone. Housing commodity even first time we've done something like this. Even chicken pox, kid, test immunity I'm attending college. vaccinate it.

If there's reliable test demonstrate ""natural immunity"" actually good vaccine, yes taking advantage it. half NJ's total deaths occurred April May 2020. think possible state catch up, yet are. Louisiana probably pass NJ sometime month well. unbelievable happening 9 months vaccines readily available, free. 1 499….

The government hasn’t perfect response Covid it’s decent. It’s pretty tough situation manage, especially tiny island dependent tourism. Set pest tents get sick survive confirms belief virus isn’t big deal. MMR need ""updated"" brother law probably one shot child needed second, common. Sometimes might recommend checking titers someone high risk contracting measles, mumps, rubella. 



I mentioned boosters every 10 years post. uncommon first booster Tdap immigrants people without vaccine records, switch that. morons refusing mask get vaccinated dire consequences rest population actually need go ER. Selfish pricks  learned didn’t get sick die

or worse mild covid, anti vaxxer lady job got covid said wasnt big deal, even anti vaxxer. landlord can’t without adding new leases renewal, guarantee challenged court.

This good anxiety. I'm sorry happened you. happened people know, too. everything right got anyway. That's bound happen we're trying survive plague real immunity to. best could hope would burn communities slowly enough hospitals could could sick. grim freaking time.

In theory everyone earth vaccinated still going wear masks.

However anecdotal, appreciate seeing comments like these. second shot side effects rough, too, I'm fearful third even worse..

Guess what, even comparing covid measures Third Reich I’m fully vaxxed, even booster number useless without much it’s spent vaxxed individuals. Sure. Prefacing IANAD (I'm getting PhD, MD), please take grain salt.

Vaccination numbers game. Essentially, want homes (bodies) virus possible. fact four major variants testament slowly coronaviruses evolve, since mutating meaningfully (and generating beneficial mutation top that) rare. However, since we've given virus trillions trillions chances reproduce living (unvaccinated) bodies now, we've given trillions trillions chances mutate mutate way that's beneficial. vaccine severely limits chances. people vaccinated, less chances we'll get another big variant fucks us bad Delta.

So mind, U.S. walked back boosters immunocompromised enough bodies vaccinated yet worldwide. AFAIK boosters third shot regular vaccine. countries short vaccines, way important get set protected think boosting existing protection. us immune way weaken virus half us immune half unprotected.

It may also soothing know whether vaccine efficacy wanes still studied really depends angle look from. Case numbers among vaccinated U.S. may rising we're opening concerts, schools, etc., we're back packed other-- corresponding bump hospitalizations deaths among vaccinated U.S. measured efficacy based who's testing positive, yes, appear though need boosters ASAP. efficacy terms hospitalizations deaths still really good means safely focus getting everyone else vaccinated first.

Once least degree protection, good time administer boosters. Hope helps!

(P.S. Florida recently fully vaccinated, lack masks p bonkers! masked everywhere fine, even someone flight home testing positive-- personal experience hard data, hope reassuring.) Usually takes less 24 hours symptoms show up. Keep mind people social media likely report bad side effects. people mild reactions. mean mean? vaccinated (J&amp;J). got COVID someone house caught it.

I PCR tested 4th positive. got second PCR test took 11th negative.

So knowledge tests only. COVID around 7 days. super long time. Usually long common cold would last me. That’s really good point. mean comment? Research indicates otherwise.

A little dirty secret military Guard pulling lot regular military's weight years. reserve guard units deployments Iraq Afghanistan active ever did. hoping guard/reserve vaccinates instead go motion forcing it. take that, seriously want use blue ink. big deal definitely showcases priorities military. subservience get us freedom!!! Navy, got vaccines small pox, anthrax, annual flu shots. Sort like MMR... tell personal experiences mileage vary. never get flu shot lays week - every one has. immune system goes overdrive reason - done since got swine flu back 2010. 

Covid shot - day tiredness second shot fine. 

I rolling dice flu shot year tho get extra money insurance company HSA shot lol shiiiit, SF Bay Area cops fire dept unions hitting back vax mandate. pandemic police wearing masks etc. They're anti-vaxx. idiot Florida governor refuses allow mask mandates, tries cover appauling death toll. skrewed Florida. Perhaps send article. Fuck aren’t lannisters think you’re downvoted you’re adding unnecessary exceptions “dropping.” much unvaccinated population gets COVID runs places go, cases drop. counts much people vaccinated. Obviously, 100% vaccination coverage would better path forward, lower case counts lower case counts. Europeans banned travelling US Russians Mexicans waltz proof vaccination quarantine.  Miraculously, twins completely fine. friend still complications sees doctor weekly. suffered stroke hospital learn walk she’s training half marathon first weekend November. proud her!

This official vaccination report Portugal last Monday (13/Set/2021) ([PDF There's 85% total population vaccinated 1 dose 80% complete vaccination. Sounds like blaming assholes refuse get vaccinated wear mask around others. personally don’t see celebrating deaths. format is: person spreads rude, stupid, ill-informed, hateful, often racist content mocking mask-wearing vaccine-getting 18 months global pandemic! Then, get Covid die. mean, yes it’s sad families, time call dumbass dumbass. They’re freedom fighters, they’re dumbasses. think takes away whatever cool think stupid memes convey. isn't, because, case, people could easily go get vaccinated. easy obese people go get government paid shot they'd significantly better chance obese, would lot fewer obese people. son 4 months old pediatric ICU.

Running Phase 3 trials without run phase 2 increases risk phase 3 participants, they're likely receiving different dosage would phase 2 trials completed.  yes  Negative test also doesn’t guarantee won’t transmit. want robust solution, it’s proof vaccination plus negative test. Surely hospitals fault treating patients ivermectin.... believe exactly relevant know 2 people caught COVID twice already. far know, still spread catch 2nd time.  Please read replies &amp; see impacted many women studied trials really way report afterwards.  It’s probably also booster sense reawaken least B cell production. hEY THatS PreTty GOod!  Yeah idea argument single payer dumb.

Single payer healthcare saves lives. keeps people bankruptcy strengthens economy. takes burden small businesses allows grow.

No healthcare system designed handle many idiots pandemic. That's problem culture education, problem single payer.   Antibody count decreases quickly. Vaccines provide longevity booster pushed anyone immunosuppressed individuals, initial vaccination creating robust response. politicians hamstring education system, medically illiterate adults hands.

Maybe — maybe — gave people good foundation science, wouldn’t let YouTube Facebook research critical thinking them. Ding ding ding! correct! Even mismatch year, flu shot decreases severity &amp; length sickness, decreases hospitalization, decreases mortality!  think information looking for, people talking someone who's died vaccination actually name even tell lived. lies spread.

Yeah, pretty much I've wanting call good handle data! medical tyranny. Lol. imagine believing something stupid?  Allinone Mod  doubt that. think worried guard numbers falling cliff.

I don’t think would, seems like sort spurious logic bad mitigation policies military know for. use 5G-equipped Portuguese minions take world Something many vaccine hold-outs understand.......there steps ""skipped"" covid vaccine clincal trials. NONE. basing resistance non-facts.

They ran phase 2 phase 3 time, ""skipping"" pretty big deviation normal process sped things up.  Im amazed obviously terrible plan allowed executed Canada. real covid conspiracy many people drove province cliff.    almost happened b/c wrote questions/area studies trial without taking account menstruation basically biological male perspective then. much misinformation feel like community helps filter glad that. I’m excited mRNA means future. Game changing shit. CRISPR technology. next tens years going drastic change world. Would hard say. We’ve got wait see. keep hearing 3 - 6 weeks  three year old daughter, Pfizer trial participant, blood draws taken shots. There's mechanism outside normal reporting deaths. Every death US death certificate. Unusual deaths often reviewed doctors.

If believe COVID deaths undercounted 30-50%, vaccine deaths probably too. I'm change fact vaccine shortage here. I'm moving!   People vaccinated still vaccinated. Cases climbing progress made: unvaccinated. I've mono rsv time.


I straight hallucinating one point. Seriously thought dying.


The best part? still go class cause went maritime academy Coast Guard requires almost perfect attendance. Went straight bombing 2 tests barely passing third managed get post poned week. ways, self swab nurse swab. Nurse swab irritating recommend refuse vaccine Dr. Larimore work:

Inoculation prevalent strain branches required. way since 12. 43 now. vaccine effect lol That’s amazing response. COVID inner circle? didn’t know infected asshole! you’d get flu vaccine also cause GBS. Sounds absolutely terrifying Also, single point failure flu variants like covid spike protein? would love flu vaccine actually stopped flu instead *maybe* stopping flu.  [All available suggests everyone get booster 6 months recent dose, long supply issue. course, supply (worldwide) major issue.

Reviewing scientific evidence going help us much here. RCTs, real world data entirely confounded (plus EUA'ing third doses), phase 1 data (overwhelmingly positive) available. necessarily problem people choosing get vaccinated since bodies choose follow CDC guidelines, keep away people part. that's exactly realistic oftentimes people refuse get vaccinated ones would wear mask, get peoples' personal spaces first mock someone still acts like pandemic still exists around us. Coupled people earn living taxpayers' money? That, BIG problem with. 

Not saying that's LAPD employees making general statement unvaccinated people. Oh, remember her. rabies thing beyond insane. Pfizer gang feelings now.. :( systemic allergic reaction dose #1. I’m high risk group clots, I’ve advised J&amp;J. I’m crummy place. Fingers crossed Novavax here. Seems like best path join ranks fully vaxed. work forces.... thank you, compare apples apples easier understand Basically, designing manufacturing shot next flu season predict strain/strains evolve dominant then. make guesses increase chance match. want remote.  wait appropriate boosters. 

Edit. There’s distinct possibility approved booster regiment recognized vaccine card/passport. would great. get flu vaccine years, works fine. remember one year, (maybe 10 years ago bit more) must missed strain got absolutely terrible, whole family got it. really bad flu year. think missed bad strain. reports side effects kids? kid obviously get regardless, COVID already, bit nervous types side effects might for. articles new studies allowed posted. Lovely, right?

I'm pro-vax I'll darned people allowed look relevant risks. makes suspicious neighbor brags dishonorably discharged marines. course guy psychopath meth addict guess I'm surprised.

It funny watching try ""buddy up"" new Marine moved family. guy impressed meth head.   ""experts believe could level end month."" How? unvaxed dead then? Sounds like wishful thinking. Article says using data till May 9th. estimate couple months outdated. Can't remember % vaccinated May definitely alot lower seems like decent estimate going till May. It'd probably much higher estimated many deaths prevented till September. primarily political fed antivax agitators. Millions civilians getting vaccine protect other, essentially testing vaccine ""skeptics"". least protect people sworn protect, like get shot zero scientific basis random bad side effect show years later, tons scientific basis keeping people dying. sounds like colored coordinated sixth grade girl's notebook beginning school year. Thanks volunteering! hope kid got shot!  science nature subject change ""Meaning thousand times likely die covid complactions vaccine.""

Right, someone can't make determination mathwise sees 1000% likely makes seem like Covid end civilization know it.

I remember told 18 months ago precautions help slow hospital burden 2 weeks. people also realize hospitals pre-Covid operated near peak capacity. like hospital beds empty overrun Covid patients.

I also find amazing even people get vaxxed (almost herd immunity levels) infections basically point last holiday season infections peak one vaccinated. Ugh person customer service role, I’ve worked many holiday weekends far less important things,….  Ok, fault getting vaccinated. Caveat emptor. It’s someone else’s responsibility decision. I'm Type 1 Diabetic fully vaccinated HBA1C 6. anyone know ANYBODY type 1 diabetic either fully vaxed tested positive Covid-19 symptoms were? Yeah, sucks. going happen. say 100%, also said LESS LIKELY, ""could still happen"". lot probably would gotten sick otherwise. go kick rocks. I'm ya here. Maybe headline say, ""...Americans make public health decisions wake perceived lack leadership"" using data till May. actually pretty big number consider thr % people vaccinated May. I'm sure estimated many deaths prevented till September it'd much higher.  Good luck guys!! military? literally smallest inconvenience comes package, one butt-load shots. handful quit want happy don’t fail piss test it.  Lol joke guy. served Marine Corps. pretty common joke coast gaurd part military Apparently joke lost some. Ever met someone suffered polio kid? life-long hell ones know make wish polio vaccine invented younger. even got penicillin ass cheek. called peanut butter shot. amount people fell next morning hilarious. It’s working well. went bar tonight, showed proof, got drunk vaccinated friends. 

Unvaxxed weren’t welcome, made choice be. yet Governor says hospital problems due Covid solved vaccinations.

He mentions opposition Bidens mandate doesnt point fingers hospital mandate Wife vaxxed I'd lying said worry us currently trying conceive. hate much misinformation surrounding everything days.

Congratulations though! hope get chance soon! Says treasonous Milley? demented Biden? ask ID, provide still supposed provide importantly, continue get message remind everyone vaccination free; government-issued ID required; proof insurance required Imagine get join army. Whatever happened rights? Taking play Russian playbook. Go figure. man knows Army. serve? body immune response like supposed instead ""the vaccine makes sick""  article worth reading. states obvious, even try analyze thr situation, what's done, hospitals cope, yadda yadda.

It says bupkis. Well known information now.

My heart admiration goes nurses hospital staff. it.

It's ""article"" circumstances justice. Vax mandatory forever military bro. least let pick arm? people got unauthorized boosters use bogus names info get booster avoid chance system already get denied. could cause fictitious person show one shot. Sorry, I’m bit high, wrote wrong. Covid SARS family Corona viruses. Scientists science thang ~10 years Corona SARS. huge head start. Add Covid-19 first started going crazy, nationa world willing throw big $$$ getting vaccine. increase $ definitely contributed timeline getting vaccines fast did. Wait, Vaccine stop transmission COVID stop getting it? 

I thought NIH said vaccine reduces symptoms get it. 

Very confusing.  San Francisco. haven’t gotten much smoke fires far year. Moderna gave chills, worst. sleep fan mosquitos net impractical. certainly good one then. Barracks mess decks, VA, pay system absolutely fucking horrible, archaic total disarray across board. Speaking experience. Let's honest here, Canada already contaminated Canadians. got sick Yellow Fever shot, nearly bad COVID was. Get vaccinated!  feel like helpful also need seriously gauge use word collapse medical professional think efforts fight battle terminology would better served encouraging people vaccinate stop protesting outside hospitals patients escorted get medical attention.  Breakthrough cases rare. They're *exceptionally* rare. Longtime TWiV listener, first time commenter!  
I know skeptical necessity 3rd dose mRNA vaccines, unpublished Israeli study's supposedly ""dramatic data"" ends proving they're worthwhile, would surmise might ideal interval 2nd 3rd dose?

Antivax dipshits take something *technically possible* automatically equate *entirely probable*. 

Meanwhile, recent data shows 0.1-0.2% percent fully-vaccinated individuals develop breakthrough infection, 5-6% show symptoms all. That's *massive* decrease, even bringing point absurd. beyond absurd. disingenuous dangerous, literally seeks muddy waters around vaccination. 

The chances hospitalized COVID-19 vaccinated 1 18,795. chances hospitalized COVID-19 vaccinated 1 237. 

The vaccines safe, effective, widely-available, free.

Spread bullshit misinformation propaganda elsewhere, troll. think even begun assess damage area. Another hard thing notion x% ""survivable"" - discounts fact that, yeah, might still alive, might also signed lifetime lung damage, heart damage, neurological impairment. Ahhh. live that. use phone primarily paper back up. ratio India (a conservative estimate) 2.7m people died India COVID19. Current govt numbers 4,43,865  L.A. cops worst!   Ah, math wrong. odds death catch 1 100. They're 1 62.

Just like ones saying survival rate 9.9875%. Wrong!

(deaths divided cases)
660,380 / 41,262,574= 0.016004333612343

0.016004333612343 x 100= 1.6 % death rate

100 / 1.6= 62

Odds death 1 62 way we’ll get 95% moment got politicized last year. Getting 60-70% already lofty expectation.  Healthcare worker, Universal Health Care advocate here. someone lost way mean can't brought around right side things. end looking exactly petty biased crazy conspiracy theorists saying are. atheist funnily enough stance turn cheek.

Hello Dr Rancaniello.
My name Yuri. currently live South Australia.

My questions are..
1 think covid 19 could evolve? know anything 9n subject assume possibilities endless. would say likely virus like this.

2 think things going like world five years now?  Hey there!

I wondering, variant emerges eventually, transmissible, virulent/causes fewer adverse outcomes infected individuals? Would evolutionary incentive drive variant emerge, all? Thanks. work hard it. seriously, discharge brig? avó de um amigo meu tem 76~ e também não foi vacinada porque não quis. Mas acredito que seja cerca de 99,5~% das pessoas acima dos 65 tenham sido vacinada, por isso é que eles arredondam para 100%  Apparently even protecting lives surround important. confirm. work fast food right old man balls yell wearing mask ""he hear me"" wanted take off.

Lastly, say triaging resource usage seem cold haven’t experienced it. 


\*Preventable meaning requiring hospitalization severe illness sure people don’t mention talk “worker shortage.” (Wage shortage.)  Great answer. 

One thing see Germany lost irrational anti-vaxx sentiment. think lot us Europe see Germany super rational giant, lot mysticism crazyness culture (Jung, Steiner, etc.). can't imagine waiting ER right now.

But Nurse's point, burn PTO sick. That's bonkers stupid. federal government pay vaccinated front-line workers quarantine. Cool, thank tenants suffered died virus. screw right?

Poor kid going us hovering steps he’s like 30.  single death tragedy, 660,000 deaths statistic easy people ignore. needs make rebrand Pfizer charge money it. learn antivirals work? studies long COVID vaccination followed infection done weeks infection, symptoms might truly long. would good news - information that, studies progress.  like Mad Max spray lower face silver paint stuff? I’m it. Honestly think sides guilty this. People getting vaccines still living fear. People refusing vaccine fear side effects, probably taken plenty prescriptions bothered read pamphlet comes them. 

 NYS announced 2 years olds daycares need wear masks day. It’s getting bit silly- trying keep masks groups little kids 8-10 hours day, they’ll take eat/ nap etc room together- believes honestly makes difference? ( different wear mask parent hour store). 

No one wants argue nuance fear appearing “wrong side.” somewhere 660k 1.5m, USA alone. crazy #(not saying u wrong big #). apply world would 14m 35m, holy shit.   similar thing happened mom. incredible stomachache week ago, went Urgent Care. unable take anymore patients day hospital due swamped COVID patients (I live unvaccinated area).

Don't blame oceans. Blame year failed policies, crazy wrong-headed leadership state congressional level, low science education levels, opportunistic partisans used vaccine-resistance political gains, blame lot things. 

But blaming Canada Mexico lame. COVID problems fault. This.

No one talks billions cost treat Covidiots!

Expect pay higher insurance premiums, regardless ur vaccine status sense responsibility.

Expect hospitals raise medical expenses/rates, justify ""higher demand, low supply"" economics. Correct. number cited world. Hence included article people could read ask ""Citation needed"" 

Also, Economist (and Foreign Affairs)subscription worth it. spare change look getting quality articles. want 3rd dose get it. far see scientific reason boosting - appears safe limited studies done. landlord's actions result forced leave home that's eviction. Maybe judge I'm talking real human terms God hate Youtube/News titles. Bloomberg posted video titled ""Are lockdowns necessary Post-Vaccine Era?"" 

Way go giving anti-vaxxers fuel Bloomberg. like people make titles touch reality, purposely stirring pot.   ""A little lavender oil covid'll buff right out"" Smoking addiction overwhelming healthcare. 

Refusing vaccine masks willful ignorance that’s overwhelming healthcare effecting others. 

While smoking bad, caused strain system point collapse. 

Why normal people pay price idiots refuse believe Covid, refuse mask refuse vaccine, refuse listen doctors science yet want treated doctors science? You’re way behind this. places already stretched resources even further. hospitals physical capacity limits buildings beds. willing compromise health vaccinated employees tenants unwilling get immunized.

At purely individual encounter level, COVID-positive vaccinated/unvaccinated person pose pretty close level risk you, vaccinated.

Bottom line - super scared dying COVID, get vaccinated best protection available.  hope not, want teach virology class person next semester! Honestly know. suppose (US only) depends partly state. masking CU fall infections go substantially down, likely spring. However think another wave winter (hope I'm wrong!) lead spring masking. ... yeah. mean that's lot people. know number/percentage.


I know animal study this, either.


But know virus infected eyes (from ambient air inside) wise increase risk. think lost enough people many people still suffering acute Long Covid.


* SARS-CoV-2: eye protection might missing   deaths — heart attack can't get admitted hospital, cancer patient whose surgery delayed critical months died years early cancer extra time grow. tragedies happen. kind idiotic argument this? countries? understanding European countries masking kids young 2. actually care whether people suffer.

Prior leadership, yeah. hadn’t president created anti-mask, ivermectin-touting movement, feel things would way better.

But commenter suggested today’s leadership problem. disagree that. Without doubt. count less 10 people circle friends/community breakthrough cases, 1 died (a man church, around 66 years old believe). Maybe locality hit particularly aggressive variant? knows. I’m getting tired people acting like vaccinations sole lynchpin disease. help? Absolutely. assist preventing severe illness? Without doubt. simply getting vaccinated current iterations protect getting spreading it. Every breakthrough case know fully symptomatic spread someone else, many times multiple people vaccinated. solace antibodies vaccine natural immunity, girlfriend. hope don’t experience long term symptoms.  negate this? Whataboutism sure subject 1, actual number dead much higher that, 1 500 sample google is. would believe fucking rapper anyway? didn‘t get vaccine yet going get anyway statement probably hasn‘t changed anything anyway lol. one point fact people wore glasses seemed factor lower covid infection rates it’s since read don’t recall exact numbers.  Excellent point. Ron Fouchier TWiV #777 made point. Flu variants arise every year outcompete prior variants fit. case, increased fitness consequence escape antibodies. CoV-2 variants arising similar: displace previous variants. CoV-2 variants escape antibody recognition, whether accounts greater fitness known also changes genes. right, people freak flu variants, never called 'more transmissible'. Welcome misinformation pandemic. get either. understand resistance masks daily change. vaccine takes 5 minutes day every 6 months?     I've seen people daily threads recommend Pfizer situation. imagine strong recruitment effort incentives coming months. hands? 

Wait.... People arnt washing hands shit, shitting?  Mississippi number 1 proportional deaths less 48 hours. Louisiana hop number 2 soon thereafter. entire wave avoidable. me: 

-My aunt teacher remained good friends lunch lady one previous schools. would get invited graduations stuff like knew her. son worked Target got everyone sick. lady's husband died son also hospitalized know personally. 

-One dad's childhood friends lives another state got covid wife. niece visited spread them. wife died hospitalized. aged like 10 years matter weeks might need kidney transplant. 

-One dad's friend brother sister law die. knew part family people died. 

As far knowing people who've gotten sick, know lot recovered. Three friends hang around covid. Mostly everyone know get vaccine voted Trump. bad can't go back NNN belong. I'm sorry unpopular opinion: nothing COVID-19. known virus 18 months. COULD allocate certain amount resources it, cap set capacity, allowing procedures proceed. reach said capacity issue notice via social media remain home quarantine. Prioritizing Covid urgent care mismanagement. actually asking opinion believe hypocrite cheering kind stuff on. Otherwise different story.  paper submitted publication science journal, sent multiple reviewers decide whether suitable: results justify conclusions; methods appropriate; literature properly cited? process gives us confidence results correct, course errors always occur. preprints released public sees peer review, might errors downright wrong. think public deserves see work paid tax dollars; all, final versions often behind paywalls. Unfortunately, preprints driving news cycle pandemic often wrong. surprising dozen tenants died covid, considering 1200 rental units. Even 2 people per unit, 2,000 tenants.   much want *anti vax* impotent (i.e., lose right breed given devolved mental condition) …. vaccine make impotent. incorrect. dialect thing.

yeah basically getting said ""who really cares?"" first comment lol.. thanks putting eloquently  pretends like black people agree her.   hope able help &amp; sincerely hope she’s better soon. It’s messed up. Clicks pot stirring people died US total population Wyoming I’m vaccinated.

I already best protection available, I’m worried vaccination status people.  think waiting full FDA approval. that's speculation. Non-vaxed adults without actual medical exceptions.  There’s couple issues severe contraindicated 12s can’t vaxxed all. 18s it’s hard without parental permission. cannot find it. vaguely remember reading KStA, cannot find memory fails me.  Let’s get two Navy hospital ships, Comfort &amp; Mercy, closer areas near water need hospital space. Send COVID folks ships &amp; reserve freed-up hospital beds emergencies only. NYC &amp; (practically) everyone board mitigation efforts (masks, social distancing, etc.), didn’t need use ship.

If anything, military/National Guard help manage heavy outbreak areas would bring order chaos we’re seeing now.

And let’s forget….Flu season now. Unless people continue mask-up &amp; social distance, months Nov-Feb going brutal. many people think pneumonia like standalone thing cannot possibly caused viral infection.  True, person farther source room could get infected closer person might not. Uneven dilution. spread COVID quarantine stay people? know whether OP quarantined?  nearly exact experience. However, wife got ill. vaccinated received second dose end March (Pfizer).

My kids going nuts trying play day 2. wife laid 4 days each. sucked. Pfizer protect us getting Covid; however, I'm sure protected us much serious illness.

We're recovered now. warned us March, 2020. definition old news. problem hits clusters. isnt one single person every family, 2 3 people family social circle. 

Not enough different people exposed truth lies run rampant. Vaccinations yet approved children 12. That's like 16-17% population.. think pandemic US?  Hopefully not? lot people groups would like well.  Study: people got Moderna vaccines less six months ago still fine.  Also folks die / died Covid stressing healthcare system, delaying preventative care.


The number cancer deaths going cancers caught later etc etc etc... got Pfizer vaccine weeks ago arm still feels sore sometimes. stop? report it? Right, can’t know sure.

i can't imagine ever wanting take time effort build/buy apartment house intention renting knew could never decide stop renting long tenant might live. Science unbiased, projects also need prioritized.

If project's potential outcome facilitating quicker end pandemic, hopefully gets bumped list bit.

The investigation still unbiased, even takes priority less-important things. localization infection nose, sinus upper respiratory track importance immune response. efficient immune response. example, vaccination arm creates Immunoglobulin G blood. Natural infection creates Immunoglobulin mucus. innate immune system mucus part first lines defense airborne viruses like novel coronavirus, flu existing human coronaviruses giving us cold. That's scientists already trying create vaccine coronavirus form nasal spray. Speaking FDA, point, boosters

**THE FDA “AGAINST” BOOSTERS.** Like, all. 

And fact remains,

 **Third doses** approved recommended immunocompromised people. 

**Boosters** almost certainly coming everyone else.

They aren’t synonymous terms; please stop conflating two. spending lot time r/nursing, comorbidity (besides unvaxxed) kill quickest covid obesity. yeah. Mississippi word. Texas Florida. logical person side line, would come back side  wrong though).

Just case anyone else misses included end comment, include again. understand hospitals *capacity*, right? know means? know ""back line"" means?

My fuck, Diet exercise would reduce strain system draw line core concept?

Is dumbest shit I've seen. saying, unvaccinated covid patients back line care. understand people done nothing wrong suffering way works unvaccinated shitheads get way receiving treatment? **Because hospitals capacity**. next available doctor child, example, tied treating unvaccinated covid patient, absolutely stop treating unvaccinated patient see what's wrong child. wait 12 hours appendix burst. 

Is ER empty unvaccinated needs care? Go ahead treat then. seem head normal times, we're going turn away heart attack patients **WHEN SHORTAGE BEDS STAFF** they're visibly obese.

This stupid slippery slope bullshit. hospital turning away someone bursting appendix covid patients virus less 1% fatality rate..... maybe none people know listen false media scare tactics day think going die. like adults eat edible accident rush hospital ignorant little risk actually is. highly fucking doubt every single patient hospital ""pre-existing conditions"" age 45 need medical attention... recs public? latest numbers Pfizer 80% efficacy infection. talking potential boosters could enough negative warrant them. However, easily lose sight number means. Imagine infected could roll die long 1 avoid infection. That's pretty darn awesome.

As someone got J&amp;J, instead rolling die closer flipping coin. I'm back extreme precautions get booster, I'd definitely take flipping coin nothing. that's infections, deaths pretty much vaccines like rolling D20. There's also weird thing US English vs British English US English refers group singular British English refers group plural.

British people would say like ""Manchester united *have* scored 1 goal game"" US English would say ""Manchester United *has* scored one goal game""

Neither incorrect. dialect thing.

To me, ""1 500 has"" sounds natural ""1 500 have"" think wrong moronic ""delay inevitable"" ""everyone's going get anyway"". could tell many times I've called moron downvoted pointing allowing rampant unchecked (read: unmasked, un-distanced, unvaccinated) spread COVID would unmitigated disaster. 

Unfortunately people care prioritize sense (misguided delusional) security form promoting false beliefs. pure dogma. feel satisfied safe blaming pandemic liberal imagination. phrase ""1 \[every\] 500 people"" still singular. convince I'll recant, seems pretty cut dry me. I'd happy take /r/grammar court like. Wait, supposed wait hours/days ER? Hmm, thought normal, maybe Ireland... Lol longer politically viable government mandate _anything_ much, history - I'd say simply they've vaccinated nearly everybody. public longer afraid impending cataclysm, we've got several vaccinated friends perfectly fine, compliance new regulations masks social distancing poor. Nobody going back Rule Six now.

Aside dealing vaccines teens, maybe eventually even children, booster jabs elderly vulnerable, I'd say arrow they've got left government form coercion push remaining unvaccinated clinic doors. idea requiring proof vaccination pubs clubs cinemas restaurants, that's mooted, though seems like thinking still it. one would useful partly keeps plaguebearers away rest us, mainly motivates step forward get jabbed last! initial surge Wuhan, evidence coming China purposely undercounting deaths lot, I'm interested accurate numbers numbers cases/deaths China shockingly low, curious they're keeping numbers low they're reasonably accurate. Looks like report less 100 cases day. Even true number 1000 cases day, that's incredibly low/successful dense population billion people. hardcore lockdown ended, I'm curious things they're keep cases control. know pretty strict checkpoints stuff, sure much they've loosened things up. I’ve thought too. Especially would mutated much co-existed earlier. It’s hard say, definitely don’t want wrong risk lives. mean like vaccine? No, that... 

The various studies have, quite point, put effectiveness *against severe disease* somewhere 70s 80s, 90% best. largest study, cited CDC, got 87% everyone, 80% 60+, month July. August data yet, expected worse.

Those severe disease numbers absolutely justify booster well. Lancet opinion piece authors failed include bunch studies relied vague terms make argument effectiveness severe disease still 'highly effective'. Even powerful: Hybrid immunity. 


Previous infection + vaccine. NPR story: 'New Studies Find Evidence 'Superhuman' Immunity COVID-19 Individuals'


Leaders use simple bullet points reach people fence, keep resources good/least harm. grip shallow assumptions baseless. 

Bye now.   populous states. per capita death level places catastrophic. 6 hours longer

This seems like weird thing say context. rushed hospital, going do? Lie home complete agony becoming septic Star Wars OT played, go hospital? Six hours long damn time burst appendix. Check out.

If lied religious medical exemption fire them.

Incidentally, religions support vaccines? Seems like prescribed Tamiflu ya'll wait symptoms son anything else. would disagree. government (in US least) sowed seeds distrust decades going back 60s least. People good reasons distrust feds general. Bed shortages primarily due significant medical staff shortages due forced vaccine. 

The second reason covid patients (vaxxed unvaxxed). except case subject reads plural (because SAMPLE)... sure hard people understand ya'll talking something completely different think economy beginning feel lack workers us weird voting system complicates things.

/Vincent. author selectively picked article emphasis natural immunity, failed address basic difference immunity generated natural infection immunity generated vaccines.

""Though previous case Covid-19 confers degree immunity, amount protection vary, leaving people vulnerable reinfection. ""

Translation: Depend severity infection genetic makeup, immunities generated people get natural infection varied huge differences degree.  Immunities generated people got vaccines lot consistent within really dramatic increase immunity people who’ve previously infected get least one dose vaccine,” said Shane Crotty, professor immunology La Jolla Institute Immunology California.

“Against concerning variants, it’s literally 100 times better levels antibodies vaccination compared somebody natural immunity,” Crotty said. “That’s small change.”

Also, author even mention long haul. Recent UK study found 10% kids got infected got long haul symptoms. Much worse: dont tell u que-tip cost u $5 ea, Aspirin cost u $20.

The WORST part going hospital treatment diagnosis worry: mystery prices final charge.

When wife labor, made clear wanted hospital ASAP. kept explaining insurance covers 2 days, like fun vacation. 🤦‍♂️😡

The game either push u longer recovery otherwise keep u hospital long possible.

Pro tip: ur injured dont need emergency care (but still need hospital), call UBER/LYFT. 1 mile drive ambulance run u least $1200. insurance may even pay (especially r stupid connect trip hospital care follows).   starts… Maybe year. restaurant case study convinced me. “incredibly selfish” science doesn’t back end anyway. effectiveness vaccine dose going unvaccinated person vs effectiveness booster dose going already vaccinated person (assuming average person) tilts orders magnitude higher favor dose unvaccinated individual.

Yes, incredibly selfish, unnecessary, generally bad idea. idea seems rooted fear, logical reasoning (or perhaps financially motivated Pfizer’s part). ""The culling weak lead us greater strength herd immunity"" - antivaxx/antimask/anti lockdown person, probably... unfortunately :(

Always disappointed many people apparently lack enough compassion genuinely believe this. data safety it? may unpopular empirical data, especially Pfizer, supported getting booster 5-6 months. frankly can’t trust CDC/WHO give proper guidelines anymore completely bungled masks beginning pandemic, saying don’t work prevent run masks, lifting mask mandate way fucking early, saying booster needed empirical data says otherwise. 

I’m coming 6 months past first dose Pfizer, scheduled booster shot. First all, don’t even want get Covid, even it’s breakthrough case. Second all, interact lot risk individuals even though odds low get someone sick COVID (since still choose wear KN95, I’m fully vaccinated) it’s worth taking risk data we’ve seeing Israel. 

I’m going what’s best interest people care about. lost faith CDC, understand things did, I’m going make mistake trust CDC guidelines what’s best individual. ok well they've changed can't argue that.. certainly disagree though. quite obviously plural number people, sample worded ""1 xxx"" is, using ""has"" sounds completely wrong Thank reply! good know get everyone vaccinated, transmission would decrease significantly. Yup ny already 4th brother also sex offender. I'm starting notice worrying pattern here... Exactly. 

Right Covid hit, surgery schedule set non-urgent issue. surgery prep appointments got rescheduled. cancelled. heard surgeon person since March 2020. even gotten call back scheduler since May 2020, last one effect ""we know we'll able schedule again"". 

Obviously, I'll live (that's definition non-urgent procedures), I'm grateful that. uncertainty ""Oh, they're going open non-emergency surgeries. Wait no, won't. Okay, hospitals bad again!"" wears while. leave hanging, call first two doses then? saving Michaelangelo future variant-specific booster? probably COVID-19. Or, might late disease course longer infectious.

Since front lines/have constant COVID patient contact, I'm surprised booster already given healthcare workers. would like measure shedding INFECTIOUS VIRUS nose unvaccinated vaccinated people ancestral virus, alpha, delta variants, see differences would impact transmission. Prior yesterday, better health many younger people know. comment disgusting. respond. avoid sociopaths blocked (won't see anyway). health trade boosting protection 80% back 95%

For Pfizer, issue. one extra dose. Compared getting 40% protection 2 doses. makes third doses effective preventing ""the risk hypothetical ""omega"" variant vaccines actually ineffective?"" Especially since 2dose people great breeding ground variants: similar people use partial doses antibiotics. hypothetical variant would hurt people everywhere new adjusted vaccines would prioritized places like America. 

I think possibility preventing hypothetical variant justifies giving least 2 doses at-risk populations world-wide first protection severe disease. It’s eviction renew lease. It’s hard speak stupid  imagine cousins friend girl ""honey swear never cheated you, vaccine trust me"" Thx didn’t see anything said that. aren’t homeless. find another place. read article?

Well course not, fact long covid possible longer lasting effects bodily systems gas variety concerns poorly understood. 

While regular illnesses less problematic I'd argue potential long covid, circulation issues, ace2 antibody issues (potential), cognitive side effects, vascular side effects, probably fairly serious concerns catching covid. 

Could argued statistics? Sure. like flue deaths every year are. 

How long would strategy vaccinate everyone avoid ""minor"" infection last? Hell knows, clear situation continues evolve like general understanding what's going does. 

My stance caution still best measure, especially large pockets unvaccinated US. messy situation I'm sure going get much cleaner anytime soon.  Hard pill swallow maybe …. hard apparently data I've seen suggests infection would usually least good one shot. However, never find strong data natural infections two main reasons.

One natural infections less controlled since manmade vaccine, antibody response would likely vary individuals. especially true future strains, vaccines specifically designed target spike whereas natural infection not. Generally concern people natural immunity though, vaccine + natural definitely complicated question.

Let die home. rookie numbers! studies mixing mRNA vaccines J&amp;J appear safe, want booster, go J&amp;J. knew asking likely long shot mention sometimes step folks forget. 

Good luck. kids lucky others family looking them..  love immediately knew meant based ""our shitty ass county sheriff."" He's seriously prick. kinda took first step, there's already made ch furor it. Yes soldiers make commitment upfront. also already required get whole host vaccines.  didn’t forget. decided don’t care. 

The question integrity still care family starts dying.  kid allowed get vaccine, otter can. Love it. sound callous terrible, it’s time start applying triage FUCKING OBVIOUS caveat vaccinated people get priority. think plateauing....with school starting expect another peak 2 weeks. guess. employer test ensure acute pandemic spreading around office landlord evict you. Obviously. Incredibly obviously. I'm sorry. 

I've cancer twice, I'm feeling you. seek cancer care today (halfway 5 year remission goal), would waiting around cancer spread would make hella anxious. 

Here's hoping start able access care timely manner, medical problems ameliorated. **hugs** Addiction disease. It’s also non-communicable. also ***isn’t*** reason ERs ICUs currently overwhelmed, healthcare providers forced ration resources. 

Point being, even addicts turned away (just like everyone else) there’s room anything ***but*** super sick, unvaccinated covid patients.  Omg. wrong people, completely lost minds! guess least we'll able easily identify orange nostrils teeth🤷‍♀️ could immunize 100% world's humans, yes, people would still get infected, likely transmit, although think transmission would way down. I've said long vaccines prevent severe disease death need change vaccine boost. However rate severe disease/death starts increase, change vaccine match variant, often influenza virus. remains risk long term sequela Covid whether it’s “poorly defined.” It’s unlikely end paper tiger (e.g. mass psychosomatic phenomenon “regular” post viral illness we’re signal boosting) look back this.

I think stage makes sense want close sterilizing immunity possible given fact disease still novel. years we’ll antivirals, better understanding long term sequela, likely less harmful variants dominating. it’s rational avoid Covid. Yeah sounds like assumed minor stomach bug. may naturally stoic person: US hospitals expect ham little.  curious much infection could really triggered eye containment portion population listened president following lead. much political leadership— really poor leadership. care protected class. think people made homeless landlords reason, much less politics. 

I'm gay. support weird ""religious right violate rights"" argument. also support landlords deciding make tenants homeless. recovering covid-19 earlier year, recently losing two friends virus complications, learning least dozen tenants died illness, Alvarez — owns 1,200 units Broward Miami Dade counties — said willing compromise health vaccinated employees tenants unwilling get much upsets employees exposed [covid-19] days week someone want get vaccinated,” Alvarez, 80, told Post. “If don’t want get vaccinated, obligation duty protect workers tenants.” Yes, think want justify approval medicine individual take benefit around them. want approval stand individual benefits alone. What's difference? People celebrating anti vaxxers losing jobs UI eligibility. homes too? partially vaccinated better vaccianted. in-laws doctors. One MD one physicist. math knowledge seem help all.  sure point melodramatic comment. end vaccinate many possible reduce death suffering.

Once kids get shots, think that’s close normal we’re gonna get. Death vaccinated people still absurdly small. everyone eligible shot subsequently mitigated high risk death, think we’ll learning live like virus. everyone vaccine goes front line? Fuck every selfish prick. talent loser. US, 41 million confirmed cases; maybe five fold underestimate? make 200 million? 60%. Immunity infection heterogeneous, people equally protected disease. TWiV, hosts supposed explain things often good that. know Mya said many things quickly, want interrupt her, would never get anywhere.  dumb ass. I'm NICU/PICU RN 22 years RSV majority patients PICU every year Oct-Feb. RSV/Bronchiolitis flu usually. extremely common.  require proof order open investigation. Usually take anonymous report investigate it, least state. racist. stopped flights chinese citizens one else what? Literally nothing else months. action supporters cling point nothing else first crucial months. Yes, lets start revaccinating everyone rich countries majority people world haven’t received single vaccine dose yet. Great PR move Would say delta defies theory? Congrats getting PTO America.  I'm surprised. 2 age limit certain European countries. drag though, Pfizer trying get approval back July FDA told go back trials. probably vaccinating 5-11 year olds already. thought already heard number August. did. Aug. 26th already number reported it’s suddenly news today.  estimates, Americans died COVID-19 killed Spanish Flu

That's great comparison, US population 3 times larger 1920. Spanish Flu lethal. hand, we're able throw things Covid beyond dreaming doctors 1918. Shout Vermont still fantastic job! STAY HOME unvaxed choice get Covid. yourself. Stop selfish hypocrite. Nobody ever beats Mississippi race bottom. Without Algebra 2, I'm sure going really get much stats.

You'll need dumb lot things students foundational math skills really get deep. That’s true me.

Not particularly large social circle - 150 mandatory test reporting coworkers 65ish family close friends would definitely know death hospitalization, likely know positive result. Coworkers get tested symptoms known exposure, family tests similar reasons weekly young kids.

All adult family vaccinated, nearly coworkers vaxxinated except couple medical exemptions.

I know 9 cases (two vaccine breakthroughs) people. One (older person breakthrough) needed careful treatment, none admitted hospital.

Meanwhile read families 3-4 hospitalizations even deaths dozen people.  say ""That true"" much want, matter, point actually checked believe true. pick beliefs based feels good, upsets least, challenges sanity least. bet ""There major threat health safety everyone love, leaders thinkers trust lying it"" feels far awful upsetting sanity withstand. much easier mock instead. people swayed now? Like he's ""messiah"" right? I'm curious people guys interacting saying this. Thanks adding link, CNBC included article.

Safe effective short term, longevity may last winter surge, may persist much longer, sounds like pretty good outcome middle pandemic. deaths largely preventable since vaccine came out. precautions move life.

Too stupid understand irony statement. 

I wish looked post history commenting. absolute waste human are. know testing kids considered unethical, actually test kids parental consent?

Testing kids considered unethical type situation. like lots prior testing ages kids, adults, etc. time prior testing ages happen. *huge* concerns testing taken context everything happened before.

Also, function parental consent. Parents sign kids clinical trials really random kids tested on. lot people enrolled kids (that know personally) medical professionals thought something like, ""I'm risk bringing COVID home kids, let sign clinical trial least stand chance immunity."" fewer breakthrough cases help unvaccinated too? I'd love know op's idea hospital collapse is. ""Well, yes, fire, yes, everything basically burned rebar still intact, actually collapsed, let's dramatic people!""  thanks yes good now. represents/misrepresents wealth people. He's horrific society, certainly welcomed death &amp; disease upon us moronic policies far bad actor seats &amp; poles. People wish change world need take responsibility &amp; stop resigning small government &amp; anarchy. Push elected representatives require vaccines masks, support wherever can.

Vaccine mandates way [re: hospital capacity], point.

Mask mandates would solve trivially too, large population idiots adamantly opposed protecting America. Tokyo vaccines, crowded subways, extremely little covid spread. wear masks, that's takes.

Outside hospital capacity, can:
1) Get vaccinated
2) Wear KN95 masks avoid indoor dining
3) Protect kids measures get vaccinated
4) 65 immune compromised 6mo+ since last vaccine shot, get booster different shot. important older are. CDC grappling recommendations here, read studies recommendations scientists make decision. pharmacies give shot without question. Well heard name first time long time, win perspective, guess.

PR weird days. What's John Q? Republican spin: OMG, 1 500 Americans died this
Democrat spin: .002% Americans died, what’s big deal people get problem though. get covid hospitals please testing Phoenix currently. Apparently hospitals, yes. get tested weekly regardless vaccination status (this done last weeks local hospital system, testing now). 

The ploy use fetal cell lines basis exemption. Saying goes anti-abortion beliefs. Yeah seriously! amount money U.S. spent unvaccinated hospital patients pisses too. Like helping won’t help us? fair? Yeah Florida talking here.
They might .......start ...........yeah no, law physics. like can't know speed position subatomic particles can't predict crazy thing Florida next. Average Age Covid death 78.6
Average retirement age 66.1 

Based US numbers Please post misinformation online.

It needs combined hydroxychloroquine well, patient stand sun 3 hours total cure. following news?   ways reduce spread disease vaccine? Masks? Social distance? Washing hands? 

Too bad things impossible 99% population. Guess people keep dieing. 

*Thoughts prayers*  feel 2nd shot? knocked day (both Moderna shots). Yes test kids. It’s reviewed ethics committee prior starting study. Parts trial work finding right dosage generally less adult. think read it’s 3 micrograms smallest kids. 

This isn’t unethical aren’t winging it. It’s regimented process strict review standards. drugs tested humans must entire protocol reviewed review board, begin testing humans demonstrating successful tests animals, also must first pass protocol review reviewing board.  virus make believe sooner later. then, there's nothing done.  ask relative information find this? acknowledge may possible given wording post. maybe ask elementary aged child? 
If truly believe happening would call child protective services equivalent available.. definitely read article first pass, think probably right there.  5-11 group pushed back couple months ago September October, far know they're still track October. referring pushed back September. Sorry confusion! started people started listening politicians instead doctors. believe Christian Scientists? reject medical intervention afaik. could wrong. ""That's lie: 6% COVID deaths due COVID...""

You see, death certificate COVID sole cause death really COVID death; contributing factors like co-morbidities — _including **""recovered cancer""**_ — means person really died co-morbidity.

.

This common argument COVID-deniers. Pfizer initially went get approval back July FDA told conduct clinical trials. us Pfizer ok that. needed vaccine time protection still strong. We'll get boosters asap we're allowed think it'll good. Also covid January extremely mild cases (seriously headache one day weird brain fog like 2 weeks, old muscle injury got sore...super mild) honest would guess makes immune response vaccine stronger. sick hearing religions respected. Evangelists got tons COVID handout money even pay taxes. Jehovah's witnesses make medical schools devote entire lectures freedom choice getting blood transfusions even emergency situations. child, thought time 50, religion popularity would die basically fiction. no, still going strong.  Ahh! Thank info! It’s appreciated! many people could prevented death covid weren’t obese. Ah, sorry see error made went back clarify (important accurate info here). agree, we'll eventually get 75% long time ago. Canada started month us achieve vaccination much quicker.

I still think hit 70%. clarify, I'm using info Vaccination:

12+ Full Vaccination - 63%

18+ Full Vaccination - 65%

65+ Full Vaccination - 83%

If use source, we're 70% adult (18+). We're close though.  florida possibly worst state union.

In addition worst state FL also covid deaths! ;) way world changed previous epidemics (i.e. governments expanded started providing healthcare Spanish flu), behaviors changes see becoming new ""normal"" result Covid-19? easy people think ""this now"" would help prepare people ""nope, on"" weight. titrate weight. example 1 mg per kg body weight. might 5 set points 1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg (etc).

I would expect middle road would dosage adults, compensating weight kid. One thing notice nearly non-hospital medications dosed weight. cut pills etc.  know kids miniature adults, dose starting point see toxicity. truth hurt feelings hopefully change behavior. Even tools developed past two years, southern states somehow still managed fuck themselves. Great work, guys. aren’t human vaccines. aren’t even mRNA vaccines. vaccines designed specifically animals 

“The vaccines donated company called Zoetis, providing 11,000 free doses COVID-19 vaccine mammals living 70 different zoos animal care facilities.” moment stopped worrying it, anti-waxers come new arguments soon laws banning movement wearing masks tightened. strongest argument die equally, vaccinated unvaccinated. UK, recommend using lateral flow test recovery lower sensitivity therefore less likely remain positive infectivity ended. highly likely kind test go negative well travel plans, already. unlucky enough keep testing positive, able enter UK. safety information monoclonal cocktail: 

…could interfere body’s ability fight future infection SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, REGEN-COV may reduce body’s immune response vaccine SARS-CoV-2. exes live Texas. That's called karma. deserve it. :D  99% people dying COVID retirement age? That’s big no.

A country can’t lose half million people without affecting workforce. 5-11 age group pushed back? references? Thanks. how? simply adults? best calculate lower dosage that’s effective? Trump talked vaccine entire last 2 months office. Everyday. proud fast got done America would first. Democrats said rushed wouldn’t take vaccine approved Trump. Would like bring videos. Yeah, Mom nervous wants doctor something costs $200+ co-pays... vaccine free... partially paranoid fuck decade watching Fox ""hear sides"", partially incredibly lackluster education, assumption vaccine free nefarious reasons. Everytime touch face immediately washing hands. Also, wash hands every 30 minutes anytime touch something unsanitary.

It's causing chapping splitting I'm working figuring out. health equity arguments compelling really wish ""symptomatic breakthrough protection important goal compared supply constraints vaccinating rest world"" argument primarily made. Instead, speculation boosters might impact vaccine hesitant, speculation side effects seen Israel 3 million 3rd doses, cherry picking data ignoring data shows waning immunity symptomatic infection serious disease. want pull direct quote one locals CC TX, said Facebook ""Literally brain-dead useless zombies still listen CDC point. takes really special kind stupid.""

How things get backwards? anyone know status children age 5 12? advocating for. 

No, isn’t. That’s histrionic fear-mongering. knowing die

Most don’t die. *nobody* simply “escorts out” critically ill covid patients unless they’re body bag. 

That’s ration care. (And everyone else’s, sadly.)

That’s triage works. know quite people assumed couldn’t get vaccine couldn’t get vaccines past drives nuts. amount people can’t get vaccine (outside children) shockingly small always wait government spin wheel use determine stuff like masks boosters effective whenever finally lands boosters good get one. phase 1 always same. Dose escelation endpoints toxicity. Sometimes say dose great effects, whatever. whole point establish safe dose. know vaccines work. know work children. point study show concrete conclusive evidence safe. Avoid entirely? Probably not. 
Mitigate far did? Absolutely could test positive mean will. Many things possible probabilistic sense mean likely. Testing positive 90 days pretty rare (around 0.4% less) IIRC even rare vaccinated. Trump late activating morons. over. sorry missed real revolution minorities quietly became educated replaced you. Scary anyone left look on, it? possible test positive long, seem like fairly unusual. Early pandemic many places required negative test exit isolation people seemed test negative weeks (although unlucky lingered many weeks months).

So guess depends risk tolerance willing put money vacation time vacation knowing might fine might test positive original infection. neighbors. Wife mother law
My former students - four wow card using connection vaccines aborted fetus cells. However flimsy wrong is. visiting Okanagan summer (from Ontario) number anti-vax people troubling. Air Bnb host candid anti-vaxxer, stating ""we live bubble here, close-knit community, COVID here"". simply pointed ""have seen number Alberta license plates here?"" Sheesh. left words ""health related"". woman fucking moron. Wah wah wah oink cry cry cry  recently deleted.  think realize uptake vaccinations 12-18 great, ANYTHING help would help. One major fears parents ""it approved quickly"". Freedom choose employed. Public health safety measures never personal choice. Based reported early days pandemic, don’t (unless changed minds). think it’s sovereign nation I’m sure… also Navajo Nation spreads across multiple states. well good Pfizer, still need data showing boosters Moderna J&amp;J also protect better transmission.

Also, really calling booster instead three shot regimen?  That’s lot people dont know wouldn't. mean Italy makes pay painting fee minimum 4 year contract (at least podenone) landlord Utah making waves renting people drank liquor... fairness drinkers referred ""those people"" lol, doubt anything came that. Tears less contagious original strain (A.1), contagious d614g mutation (B.1) swept US northeast Europe month later. makes tremendous difference, something like 25% exponential case difference every days. US west coast behind places first wave result.

But 7,000 extremely good relative US - half nationwide average. wonder there's stupid conspiracy theory come make anti-vaxxers keep away hospitals die home like god intended. Lol did, that’s it’s wrong. STAT reporters live blog Especially they're wearing cloth masks. still quarantine use 95 masking give wide birth people. saved pandemic money allow freedom stay away. places hit hard summer places awful vaccine rates.

Florida middle pack vaccine rates, absolutely dominating cases deaths.  happens spending healthcare seen wasteful, conservative politicians pushe ""efficiency"", ends bare bones healthcare system redundancy capacity increase staff resources needed. provide minimum amount ICU capacity normal times, going lot extra capacity pandemic.

Not mention Alberta gov currently employing ""starve beast"" strategy justify allowing private healthcare, they're probably happy this. They're currently trying cut healthcare funding wages moment (yes middle pandemic). importantly, treatment must taken rectally best results. it.

HCQ, dewormer, extra pointy crystals, bleach, UV lamps, essential oils. goes poop chute. 

Trust me. good science skool.  That's illegal ACA, group insurance think could exclude would apply vaccinated well. Say louder idiots back. I’m fking sick killing people. Debt problem U.S. Like, people really know anything national debt vs personal debt. joke - recently taken weeks schedule weeks still waiting results back. normal anyone else?  still remember May 2020, NJ NY far ahead everyone. (NJ) 16 times death rate TX one point. followed us states like MA, CA, RI. even places like MI, IL, PA MD would top-15 top-10. Many hard-hit states early brushed aside. TX 2100 deaths per million (70% NJ) FL 2300 (77%). see AZ AL verge overtaking New England states, may get too. Meanwhile, MD DC pushed bottom third. vast majority population, neither exposed COVID I’m concerned curious boosters adjusted Delta variant. they? That's exact thing. different now, Alberta ICU room still needed.   would like go record say fuck old guy. going hard time get form exemption vaccines received boot. Sure is, exposed smoke doesn’t potential kill you. else fails, thoughts.  yup People aren’t climbing mountains still fall deaths. Full stop. would say fine personally mean vaccinated small office. work none us wear masks since we're vaccinated there's around 6 us. there's still danger I'd say office eliminated alot danger everyone vaccinated. Personally I'm wearing masks crowded public areas days. actually *not* shut flights place virus emerged *that problem*. claims really really didn't. banned Chinese people flights still seeing 20-30 flights day Beijing LAX. already confirmed cases US time bans announced. support vaccine, know landlord could enforce lease somehow. somehow ran full circle got back beginning. water wet, water dry - constantly state “wetted” ? Exactly bring up. recently Austria accepting vax, proof recovery, test get restaurants.  What? correct grammar whatever sounded better would worse situation English language already are! argument ""this sounds better"" holds much water ""I know I?"" talking different issues. Anti-govt types wrapped ignorance ideology. COVID made political issue TFG, would anti-vax forces today.  Lol okie dokie. exactly landlord kicks tenant out, tenant move elsewhere. unvaccinated (non-exempt) person COVID carries someone else, makes bigger scumbag. America ceased society backs sensible behavior, lets ignorant bring rest. coworkers wife nurse apparently 83% beds filled they’re getting record calls regarding people symptoms 

As noted poster, choice likely ended causing *more* deaths. hospitals doctor called likely multiple COVID patients ventilators virtually chance recovery. man condition close guaranteed chance recovery gotten surgery closer typical timing. I‘m guessing patients hospitals doctor died COVID anyway already far gone. people died *despite* many resources available (eg, ICU, ventilators, etc). man died essentially denied resources.  got 3rd shot 2 hours ago. said f got wife CVS. first shots 6 months ago, second 4/6. didn’t want wait interesting. makes wonder survival rate would've say 1918 flu would today. Great point forgot mention comment. intubated always equal requiring ventilator. Yeah super antisocial way since long covid. prefer hang w tiny humans (babies toddlers)... also disease vectors can't help it, blame them. Basic hygiene common decency (like staying home sick regardless kind communicable disease have) two skills completely lacking US. Sometimes capitalism can't go work even we're sick, sometimes people fucking gross. Either way, got sick helluva lot precovid times everyone looked like crazy washing hands lots covering coughs staying home. But, like said, I've baby-lady long time tiny humans serious germ-filled creatures, good hygiene thing decades.

So yes agree CDC data straightforward, misunderstanding posts fault, response AAP data, attempts cast bogus compared CDC data, etc., rather identifying providing simple explanation identified above, exacerbated confusion. 

By way, seriously trying help, post CDC data would encourage specifically point it’s percentage hospitalizations compared entire population Children US, also post AAP data shows percentage child infections result hospitalization. think parents want know odds severe case event positive test, AAP data relevant question.

Except they're not, practice. shots would become boosters US Europe going instead become first shots poor countries. They're going thrown trash expire US Europe given boosters. authors study falsely assume quickly redirected countries instead. resources inflexible. 100 ICU beds need reserve 20 surgeries case something goes wrong, means take care 80 ICU patients. stop elective surgeries take care 100 ICU patients.

Yes assuming triage based antibodies, rather vaxx status, we'd able set aside 20 beds remain ER patients. someone anti-bodies, either vaxx date body able produce antibodies, would get jabbed booster (or go home quarantine they're opposed). Neither vaccine tests (PCR rapid) 100% favorable numbers. tests would also allow contact tracing. Furthermore, ER issue surgeries treatments falling behind.

Thank marvelous efforts communicate science pandemic.

Are aware good studies disease severity re-infection?

\*edited: style   Suddenly interested Trump possibly infected again. Holy shit, 15%. That's huge. Yes, we've seen that. keep repeating every time. also polio smallpox literally thousands years. anything mortality rate things increase hospital systems stressed/collapsed unable treat normal illnesses injuries they're full COVID cases? places putting that. requirement to.

A judge NY issued egregiously wrong decision issue, get overturned settled law. religious exemption required. Wrong even philosophically, matter law. direct case precedent US constitutional NY law claims, judge defied them. issue injunction, finding likelihood success merits, existing precedent unequivocal. Since medical exemptions comparable, newer rulings lockdowns come play. 

SCOTUS' abortion decision rock solid legal argument compared completely batshit NY ruling was, that's bad we're talking. judge 84 obviously there. There's already way supply demand housing. individuals buying primary residence that's driving prices. speculators investment firms. Individual cases don’t negate results comprehensive studies. Sorry got COVID many times though. wait til they've covid, delta, whatever next strain Certainly legality lack access. two major reasons heard. 

One groups, especially lot older immigrants speak Swedish aware options. (There information campaigns major cities important languages, Arabic, Somalian, etc., effort, least.)

The second, probably important, one lack trust government. Lack trust government seems generally major reason behind low vaxx numbers (case point: USA).  Shutup! pedants reddit wanna listen make sense.  That’s problem claims without facts. Things get spun around inflated. feel it’s better stick true facts figures this. .02. much inaccurate info floating around days. Reducing Rt 1.1 0.9 difference hundreds thousands deaths vs virus going extinct country months. supported science. I'm aware opinions think needed now. nothing effectiveness boosters everything vaccines might better used. data effective everyone would benefit them.  think epidemiologists view deaths caused strained resources due ongoing pandemic - I.E unnecessarily died heart attack ICU's full things nature, secondary/ indirect deaths attributed pandemic. 

After all, virus that's dangerous, strain puts elements resources within affected society. Let's stop treating people COVID people getting sick worthless anti-vaxxers. rights equal one right cancel another right?    No

Both things simultaneously true. Calgary Dallas, Edmonton Houston /s Truth, pretty much universally recognized getting vaccinated post infection boosts immunity even more, incredible amount fact.  someone close appendicitis last week. Waited hospital 12 hrs surgery. infection spread. go many rounds IV Antibiotics bring back control. Could much worse. Free exist. can't choose want believe.  Pfizer approved one week Moderna, though agree seems like much earlier.

Now then... might Pfizer supply available first, resulting at-risk people receiving Pfizer. idea that's case. might even wants see family die, psychos fact. feel bad them!  Lol seriously… I’m heavily downvoted asking legitimate science-based question backed CDC data 😂 everyone know vaxed. rare vaxed person develop extreme symptoms. .... without heads. correct. people complete sterilizing immunity less chance vaccine escape variants  Americans died covid every war last 150 years combined. Secondly kills old people healthy Vaccine would say unvaccinated people (Without legitimate medical reason one) classified preventable hospitalization unvaccinated behind unpreventable cases now.

Outside 12 sounds like almost everything able get it. feel bad kids can't get shot. absolutely encourage people get vaccinated, I’m going demonize, evict, otherwise force get vaccinated.

What choose body none business. Also -- I've said lot lately -- Canada's provincial healthcare system may something like complain about, generally trust it. least inasmuch trust designed bankrupt us soon get really sick. 

Healthcare premiums living US felt little like extorted, least gambling -- pay X amount hope need amount health care year. Functional, sure, really engendering trust time *systemic trust really important.* reinforce people unless positive test result, claim meaningless intentionally ignoring context? link they're referencing claims there's undercount 2-4x. That's got 365 number.  Oh gee get this? Ha! Obviously spread know it. dumb! took college class called something like ""Probably Statistics Engineers"". one boring classes took, thing remember vague recollection Bayes' Theorem (not details works though).

However, vividly remember exercises probability class designed math majors. things like ""flip coin 100 times row write results *in order*. many times get heads three times row?"" kind exercises pretty good informing intuition probability, depend ""advanced"" math background had. sounds horrendous. I'm parent, can't imagine watch child go much pain length time feeling helpless anything it. basically know 1 person got Covid far, vaccine. fun, fine.

So, know anyone bad experience ideal world, landlords shouldn’t exist, they’re “stealing [others] make living”. Seems like want society either home, sleep street. Yeah... think last logical people side jumped ship long time ago... vaccines though. Vaccinated patients ~1/20 likely need medical care. 

It's matter simple irresponsibility. REALLY rediculous thought vaccine distribution widespread available virtually everyone, prioritize COVID positive patients bottom?

Like, come COVID symptoms test positive, vaccine card either, sorry bud. gotten vaccinated little Jimmy giving spot getting heart transplant selfish ass get coverage NEVER needed. One big problem communicated us many things involving women/periods/etc. serious problem. vaccines. mean whole way women treated medically horrid. told can't get tubes tied ""think future husband"" similar things. rare occurrences. norm. Taking antibiotics make birth control ineffective- know many people actually know that. something hat common knowledge.

Also, sometimes things impact periods relate something else. confounds issue well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm disagreeing you, btw. giving info. Could please stop posting paywall links! It’s annoying, I've seen areas report weekend post everything day Monday listed accurately website, NY times tracker got wrong numbers somehow. added another day something, count larger. thing religious objection vaccine, simply another case people hiding behind religion excuse member civilized society.  uncle passed december covid vaccines. Finally memorial last weekend whole family. Covid sucks dont get vaxxed mean, leader opens jar angry hornets, knowing angry hornets do, tells everyone ""Hey, angry hornets bad! worry it!"", tons people start popping open jars angry hornets saw leader it, get stung high heavens, start forming anti-anti-angry-hornet-jar-opening groups screaming people think bad idea open jars angry hornets making special lid-locks keep jars opening, years jar opening angry hornet stings, leader off-handedly says one speeches ""Hey, way, open jars angry hornets. Lid locks work!"" followed ""But work, I'll first know hahaha"", think that's going make much difference opinion? Bro, even start talk...not here.   arguments telling truth, even people run it, stronger argument lying people try mitigate behavior, pretty much every situation. One biggest problems pandemic huge loss trust medical authorities (e.g. CDC) lying similarly this.

Just give people truth Depends world are.

British English typically refers collective entity group plural, would say ""have.""

US English typically refers collective entity group singular, would say ""has."" meant say ""If people actually cared fellow citizens would socialized medicine boy died."" Water bottle? Let's get tranq darts fill vaccine.

Offer $10,000 bounties. point ask people get vaccinated last December/January soon available people. little, late. right problem  relative. 12 people 2000 still .6%. right target CDC numbers saw yesterday Covid mortality rates. ""Experts saying chug lavender oil..."" -- Fox pundit soon  course includes reduction deaths less driving less violence less flu. Healthcare resources somewhat inflexible. takes years train new doctors nurses. disaster affected one part country move people around, affects entire country (or world) can't make resources appear reach said capacity issue notice via social media remain home quarantine. 

Where last year? People ordered stay home weeks/months simply refused it. also resolve issue accidents random acute illness. People can't choose heart attack fall ladder. Hospitals rationing care year, times limiting stopping elective surgeries could result hospital stay. kid last Nov hospital deserted except ER, L&amp;D, ICU.  concern ski season coming up. Though I'll finally go again, looks like I'll stick blue green, cause hurt break leg... Yea anywhere mask mandates vaccine released change unvaccinated mask mandates suddenly almost 100% vaccination even vaccines hard get 97 look things.

They can't say many unvaccinated unprior-infected individuals would claim expire. No. 2 states locked down. a. due respect, sounds pretty sociopathic
b. didn’t say infected+vaccinated person poses threat infected+unvaccinated person? besides difference viral load, vaccinated person much less likely infected first place, they’re smaller risk others Wicked cool masks! post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* smug dipshits sure love vacationing here.   moreso getting socialized medicine, would community smart enough realize vaccines work. thus vaxxed population, less beds would occupied delta variant sick folk. 

That's social medicine would saved boy. - explained perfectly clearly. Jfc go get one. Nobody checks immunocompromised  Fauci....the ultimate fact checker! Someone posted link today article threshold droplets aerosols based misunderstanding 1962 study tuberculosis spread. Long fascinating read tiny mistake contributed misinformed guidance start unfortunately cost health experts lot credibility process. *proper* takeaway they've learned early mistakes much better guidance now, loud radicalized minority think know Maybe finally found way force morons police force? say take vaccine.  That's assuredly untrue. true system even accommodate mass casualty event multi-car crash situation. definition cannot treat ICU beds elastic require specialized highly limited resources (such ICU specific health care professionals treat patient). ""you know else causes infertility?"" ""MENOPAUSE.""

(Presumably already reached menopause late 50s) personal experience - seems like heart issues eyeball injuries get immediate care. McMaster Canada low icu beds.

Ontario 15 million people system meltdown 500 icu patients covid. Yes, even young kids masking well. went states July uncomfortable couldn’t wait get back home.

We working hard Ontario avoid another bad wave - except bad apples course. So, telling common sense, critical thinking basic arithmetic better disingenuously trying denigrate analysis casting aspersions ""credentials""? Per CDC, seems like 91% (age 55+)

Granted, CDC data used is...special: personally really hate data that's already grouped whoever decided grouping criteria probably kind person take horse dewormer. Oh boy like hard tacos, bite shatter. Love soft ones. Corn great. sure “breakthrough” great word use right now.

Jokes aside, incredible work impressive individuals. Nah 2. Good info, people want hear suppose 🤷‍♂️ manage civil discussions unvaccinated loved ones, that's it

Literally thing left do. Part wishes knew people could attempt convince (not really though), feel absolutely useless otherwise. Show one video Trump said wouldn’t take vaccine like Biden Kamala Open Facebook hospital memes posted walls staffed homeopaths. shit you, wise ways elementary mathematics?  lateral flow tests use once, believe share them. agree cheap lick stick would great them. However listeners writing countries cheap antigen tests. bad not, would game changer sure.  mean - thats literally triage is. 

I'm advocating take people ventilators...but start limiting percentage resources non-vaccinated C19 patients occupy. 

Lets say get 25% hospital's capacity. 75% reserved vaccinated non-C19 issues. 

I'm wasting resources people. tragedy New Jersey deaths happened early. Mississippi deaths happened full knowledge Covid. happened would never believed people would rather die horrible death struggling breath get simple vaccine. Exactly point. tongue cheek... exactly make everyone get vaccinated you’re Hi Vincent. I'm Blacksburg, VA pleasant sunny 78° Fahrenheit (26° Celsius) outside, I'm I've caught [Hokie Lovely.

Anyways, I've heard COVID vaccine slight significant chance causing heart issues otherwise healthy adults. concerns booster shot might amplify these? increased protection (if any) boosters outweigh risks?

Thank you. case. Transplant queues triage work differently mistakes made based premise, question underlying assumption people remain unvaccinated country ample supply going respond kind predictable way boosters made available. Speculation regarding irrational individuals might respond drive public health policy.  Yes, get boost immune response asymptomatic infection: severity correlate immune protection. long virus reproduces extent 'wake up' immune system give boost. Framing Harris Biden said videos Republicans currently saying vaccines absolutely absurd. either die survive. 50/50 chance either way county (a rural one) 7-15 people die week since mid August. county 40,000 people, we've 140+ die COVID. 

The counties around us seeing similar numbers. INSANE. Makes sense. see moderna consider smaller dose booster. Thanks Jan 2023 according prioritizing care actual emergencies nonvaccinated COVID-19 make monster?

""picking"" lives dies necessarily make monster, that's triage is. also, picking necessarily mean right thing either. looked numbers deeply seen videos comparing Florida Pennsylvania justification say Florida well get oversized amount bad press versus states. surface, Florida PA seem similar number deaths per 100k rate survival much higher. dont really know think Florida. Part thinks easy target i'd like see cases isolated last 3 4 months really judge. also wonder Northeast get smacked badly Florida enters cooler season. Oh, must US thing. That’s 3 whole months. ling time? logistics? Yeah - that’s next step. hours away family members question. it’s hard figure do. None us realized deep actually misinformation conspiracy theory holes. “Wait times measured days"" - oh lucky devils.

Over point literally *years* non-urgent cases months weeks anything urgent. :/ ICU beds always capacity that's way system designed. could done antivirals ready treat infected people, stop transmission. knew SARS #1 bats CoV infect human cells. made antivirals block CoV (totally possible) - companies interested NIH US would fund work. pandemic could stopped. without antivirals, done testing masking distancing early US. mean lot testing! cheap daily test could dramatically limit spread. RE: article 3rd shots. Overall conclusion 3rd shot needed yet, immunity waned enough. expect need 3rd shot driven largely return severe illness vaccinated individuals.

At point, know elderly immune compromised people getting breakthrough infections varying severity. likely benefit 3rd shoot protect severe illness, even immune system weak fully protect them. unfortunate reality many people may never enough immune response protect illness, thus relying entirely herd immunity avoid severe illness covid-19. Hahaha

I'm sure I'm getting voted... joke. That's line use EVERYTHING.

You're close, keep hands pocket, stay car, step car, please put cell phone down, etc... name ""officer safety"" 1 ICU bed

… **ONE** ICU bed non-covid emergencies?!?

That doesn’t even acknowledge problem, let alone solve it. learn percentages work Ugh got 2nd Pfizer shot April fools day. Joke indeed, me. I’d like third shot please. don’t. don’t need coddle people anymore. don’t care 700,000 dead Americans, don’t care collapsing health care, decided get vaccinated. 

If current evidence isn’t enough, stupid stubborn. 

The absolute proof anti-vaxxers lined get free monoclonal antibodies soon get sick. isn’t crusade science lack information , it’s refusal get vaccinated.

The unvaccinated can’t hold world back much want to. explain purpose binding antibodies vs neutralizing? Neutralizing pretty cut dry think, point/benefit binding antigen? help neutralizing antibodies perhaps t-cels easily identify it?  Stop treating unvaccinated adult covid patients people. Put tent outside get patients taken care of. ridiculous. natural immunities infection plus vaccine probably way good give us example language think break get vaccine? Look citing cnn, take false information. Biden: script flipped everyone blames republicans democrats saying thing republicans saying now

Both sides dumb take media twists facts horribly. Trump proud vaccine supposed believe didn’t want anyone take cmon  thought trying minimize COVID comparing fatality rate heart disease, disingenuously obfuscating broad term ""heart disease"" actually is.   BNT German company. teamed Pfizer Pfizer infrastructure distribution.

What utter rot. virus doesn’t care national borders. thing litterally happened girlfriend last week.  One theory virus evolution time, viruses become less pathogenic maximally transmissible. idea virus spills animal, quite pathogenic humans, time evolve new host. time disease production decreases could improve transmission - kill host quickly, virus less likely spread. theory little proof. best example introduction poxvirus Australia years ago control rabbit populations. first year virus killed 99% rabbits rabbits survived less susceptible, virus evolved less virulent. data humans. talking about? always think everything you? Buddhist-majority country 95% adults vaccinated case almost month. can't help wonder Florida ERs end storm season + flu season + covid wave impression Navajo nation mortality rates higher start pandemic since aggressive vaccination campaign pretty high rate infact many places, especially reservations. 

This older article found Need lanolin. Udder balm. save man died pancreatis. 

I'm sorry, teaching lessons persuading someone ""our side"". fact someone die something outside choice/control, someone else made choice put hospital first place.  least 4 weeks"" mean ""only 4 weeks"". 

Isn't clear wrote understand that? question long covid breakthrough infections. think say least 4 weeks presumably that's timeframe good data for. used 8 weeks describing long covid prior vaccination, sort universal standard definition long-covid:

""Previously, study found 1 20 people U.K. got COVID-19 battled Long COVID symptoms eight weeks more. ""

I'm saying maybe long term vaccination prove even better regards long covid; data yet. Maybe 8 weeks difference better 49% fewer. point source carbon reduction DeSantis let stand, long!  vaccines animal vaccines. reducing supply human vaccines way. official message. Except young otherwise unable get shot. Willingly unvaxxed, stay home. medical treatment. They've killed enough people. can't help feel like breakthrough cases vastly underreported.  Everyone seems know case Depends mean 'beat vaccines'. far immunity induced many vaccines, allowing infection, still prevents severe disease death caused delta variant. even ability antibodies induced vaccines reduced ability block infection variants, immune system still prevent disease. likely severe disease death prevented cells. key amino acid sequences spike recognized cells change variants. think variant arise overcome protection vaccines severe disease death. called people vaccinated criminals, thrown jail. 

Not even believes insanity coming mouth reddit. terrible time getting mine first time. want fight badly. Especially know bunch high risk anti-vaxxers. speak favorably forced vaccination voluntarily vaccinating? count covid related deaths.

Health Safety news behind paywall. Go F yourselves. Sorry realize fan landlords Looks like they're trying defund themselves. think least open option pursue level. 

Alas, messy quagmire ifs. Absolutely depends type mask. Anyone still wearing cloth masks protection wasting time. 

I’ve worn kn95 better throughout pandemic. Lately, transmission rates high, it’s n95. Kn95 least provide *some* protection wearer well fitted, though course it’s useful everyone given space wearing equivalent masks. No. monsters ones willing kill people around misguided pride. Fuck anyone eligible refuses vaccine. backs, turn them? Where? It’s built contract unless state city laws. doubt Florida places tenant protection laws. Here's read story: Floridian bates governor something (else) stupid. Eventually governor goes flames said Floridian sues state millions dollars. win. dude not.. year parties equally right extend contract. tenants choice. can't. people social circles willfully refuse believe empirical data use common sense protect others, rethink involvement them, give ultimatum, cut need be.

(Not all, large amount). [Only America plays loudly background]  actually good way consider risk. would add risk factors create number. me, vaccinated excellent health fitness charts. risk far lower general public. Knowing choose risk tolerance. think illustrates critical thinking. also insurance company calculates risk.

Critical thinking also realizing media reports things rare makes interesting. case, happened article top post unlikely happen anywhere locations mentioned. even common. briefing doc here:  Proposed use COMIRNATY booster dose  proposed use “booster administration COMIRNATY approximately **6 months** following primary vaccination series.”

Wait back 6 months 8 months (and rumors 6 5)? *Oh,* drama. know tell you. Nobody said deaths count 12.  Care given needs it,

I agree this, unless one needs made know beforehand treated fault themselves, grey ethical zone. science says wearing mask? Cardio B right Nicki. Thank much reply, greatly appreciated! kind “resources” think Sweden Norway Portugal (or Spain) wouldn’t order mass vaccinate? believe science haha. don’t believe wearing mask indoors eternity. wear mine everyday right pandemic. going wear one 40 years lol.

Honestly terrible. probably nut job believe science begin anyone listen opinion? Unless lab research team shows safe can't know nearly much people actually studying this. mean people Tik Tok YouTube mean actual scientist working CDC Another World Health Organization saying exact thing. Basically every pharmacy existence. Oh it’s even better that. asshats claim don’t want vaccine don’t trust science doctors. minute get sick, it’s doctors science. won’t take vaccine “don’t know what’s it,” happily accept monoclonal antibody treatment.

That's immune systems work. son, John Q Delta variant?  
Thought experiment flipping scenario:

Let's pretend one year new strain comes hits vaccinated par Delta tearing unvaccinated. Perhaps vaccination results cytokine storms require level hospitalization. unvaccinated can't get beds face issues they're currently creating.

How would respond approach problem? Would see level cautioned debate morality allowing vaccinated take hospital beds wilfully chose vaccination?

Or... would see shootings, lynch mobs, attacks hospitals overwhelmed vaccinated patients. 

My guess rabid antivaxxers extend courtesy moral debate - feel vaccinated deserving level care currently given unvaccinated.  Ha. uncle said year ago. “Don’t want get get with?” months later hospital regeneron (or whatever is) lost several members congregation due Covid.  already much better. 

""Prepared need be"" relative. 

I looked earlier, Florida 325 deaths 7 day average. 

New york state 35 average. Indiana counties higher risk categories COVID-19 spread state health department’s risk ratings. ratings, updated every Wednesday, placed 22 Indiana’s 92 counties highest-risk red category, one last week since mid-January.  counties received next-highest rating, orange. one county, northernIndiana’s Porter County, lower-level yellow category. fourth week row, counties placed lowest-level rating, blue.  month ago, highly contagious delta variant still getting foothold state, one county listed red 62 yellow blue ratings.**  54% Indiana residents fully vaccinated COVID-19 Wednesday, 15th-lowest rate among states, according Centers Disease Control Prevention. estimates, Americans died COVID-19 killed World War I, World War II, Viet Nam War, Korean War, Revolutionary War, War 1812, Mexican-American War, Afghanistan War, Iraq War, (non-Civil War) military conflicts....combined.

You could say “All military conflicts since end Civil War” rather list individually. there's lots outdoor dining available anyways? time goes away mrna flu cold vaccinations available getting sick increasingly rare vaxxed. guessing he'd add lease lease comes renewal sign again, that's catches them... problem could long year cases. sad story. good news type thing happening ver specific areas country still rare. RSV infections 2020-21 due masking distancing. many countries lifted RSV re-emerged still seeing peak RSV rising many places. easily distinguished COVID testing reports incidence quite accurate. know someone emergency intubation. N95 on, face shield. Patient Covid+, tested positive days later. Whole family ended getting it. year ago. wrong.

(proceeds agree it, except one part) 

I searching edit say ""hours days"", based sources found. There's even [reddit thread 

""Totally wrong"" kinda combative, given agreed said slightly wrong timeframe. hope hospitals start using separate queues ER's.

1. Normal ER
2. Vaxed COVID related
3. Unvaxed COVID - people queue queued parking lot  often choice, always. you’re mentally healthy, affluent, overweight, it’s definitely good thing, lot part horrible system live whole package little debbies cost amount pieces fruit veggies. People also forgot tons news stories vaccine trials. read listen news without hearing updates vaccines proceeding phase 1, phase 2, phase 3... they're calling ""untested.""

They're trying rewrite history, history even year old. Well, guess we’ll wait refrigerated trucks filled vaccinated bodies saying “Oops”??  point, fuck unvaccinated. kick hospital let home remedies. never like analogies apply anything make stance work (Chinese history full this, fun semester). instance, compare pandemic bikes cars. Relate virus parasite destroys integrity gasoline makes cars useless, public may adopt widespread use bicycles makeshift way deal crisis. Electric cars come year later, solving issue acquire them, people hold onto bikes “just case”. don’t necessarily bring bike dump, electric car, don’t need use bike every day anymore. Please get medical advice Reddit. (or someone else) wants know appropriate vaccine schedule due personal circumstances, please ask doctor organization administering vaccine. 42 million Americans contracted Covid. many people caught voting false identity? I've literally never heard prosody today. read Wikipedia say appears expected be--the linguistic study patterns speech--but I'm confused defensive it. tried bury fact, fully open conversation thing. tell, prosody seems exist alongside grammar, dictating it.    get flu shot at, need make appointment said places? think Biden literally said Gulf Coast States earlier year “the key fully preparing hurricane season get fully vaccinated”. literally called it. went exercise economist looking at, last year. also CDC tracker tracks excess deaths. interesting CDC tracker seems overly conservative uses buffer average number deaths previous five years. 

I went back redid calculations code account 2021 I'm seeing 923,000 excess deaths average last 5 years calculated state level summed. noticed states actually had, certain periods time, dropped average deaths number calculations taking decreasing national total. opted zeroing deaths average since think covid pulled anyone grave. 

[CDC Excess Deaths  Sounds like logistical government failure. definitely know hospitals longer receiving  aid resources treat covid patients non-covid patients. lot fall irresponsibility general population getting vaccinated also large portion elected officials longer feel public pressure continue covid aid Yeah, really reached point hospitals need put unvaccinated covid patients ""comfort care"" let 'em die. need resources people actual emergencies foreseen. unvaccinated killing innocent people races. We're together.   specific situation referring dental visits. in-laws got breakthrough cases (Pfizer) 2 days symptoms fine rest time. teenage son also Pfizer didn’t get it. children never got (they immediately isolated them) thanks, US would rather let dead bodies vaccinated people pile cause vaccine skepticism winter. 

Before anyone attacks here, state’s dashboard used keep tabs 70+ suffered breakthrough deaths, it’s decade starting 40’s. sucks, understandable waited situation. phrasing came doctor, know waiting out? told guess makes sense. 

I typical laceration ER trip said one inch right would severed big artery I'd dead. Comparing apples zebras Look line furries. logic endlessly stupid. Nothing life 100% effective, bother anything. Guns 100% effective. Get rid guns. Get rid houses. Get rid roads. Get rid healthcare.  Grifters logical. Sounds like making rap song best contribution verse Monster. think guest verses album released better album content. Glad put patriotic quotes. Hope people start calling - nationalistic. Way less statistically likely get it, therefore spread it. Deaths post-covid related issues counted either. (Pulmonary enema, blood clots, kidney failure etc. ) mother covid, caused ""post infection"" issues, listed dying covid covid tests came back negative. 9 contributing causes death. Every single one caused virus. 

My father 6 months later still relieved die ""covid"".  He's mostly relieved counted amongst deaths. dead dead matter wants believe killed gone. It’s pretty clear people put politics say believe. know pastor told “more powerful” members church he’s even allowed go far encouraging vaccinations masks. It’s damn shame, glad pope doesn’t problem    cut point get 2nd jab? friend 1st jab back May, since reluctant due scare stories. coming around getting 2nd jab, family worried he's left long. Anyone idea extended gap jabs still fine receive 2nd jab long receiving first one? Thanks. Completely agree opted get vaccine someone else shows needs room forfeit.  Getting killed completely preventable disease orphaning children really dumb though. good reason get vaccinated, ESPECIALLY people dependent them. Yeah, could believe that. Mine’s probably lower that. direct connection anyone who’s seriously impacted. still believe 1 500 / 1 350 number, feel like people associate largely maskers / vaxers, aren’t would probably keep quiet anything deathly ill hospital case  Likely logistics, approximately one million individuals spread whole world oceans Especially one unifying characteristic people complete lack empathy. something happens literally nuclear family, it’s completely irrelevant. I’m Catholic either, like dude well. He’s breath fresh air otherwise pretty stuffy organization. Back February first got Pfizer shot, really wanted Moderna, gave Pfizer. I’m lil sad :( we’ve seeing Moderna, bigger dose better efficacy severe breakthrough infections. could see Moderna needing longer 8 months That’s good point. Maybe that’s would take start changing hospital policy I'm curious know prioritization happening unvaccinated covid patients. 


Like,I get it, know show hospital, they're really bad time need immediate care. 3 unvaxxed C+ already waiting, someone comes something serious this, unvaxxed C+ arrive, getting treated first seriousness covid? case ""We can't help anyone."" Or""First come, first served bad time.""? countries several times hospital beds per inhabitant truth health care system handle huge amount patients short timeframe. Regardless US healthcare system many problems. Slow wrong reaction pandemic play also factor. ignore problem long enough preparation handle it.

What real risks getting infected we're statistically unlikely end hospital due infection even less likely die? Yeah, suck getting sick, one loves that, necessary keep chasing risk-free lifestyle order normal life resume? We're still even 100% sure vaccinated spreading effectively, long COVID remains poorly defined unvaccinated vaccinated. 

Beyond that, long effect third dose even last? Would immunity mild infection post-vaccination last longer? honestly idea hard blame experts feeling torn zero answers sizable portion world (and country!) still remains immunologically naive. say yes, protecting everyone infection good idea right now, say six months infection wanes again? fourth dose? fifth? Doses every 4-6 months? need continue manufacture doses Americans massive scale might actually need statistical benefit beyond avoiding cold? 

It's cut dry ""I ever want get infected.""  one could make virus. I've working viruses 40 years human planet could that.

Maybe shepherds support vaccines flock lost. totally think balance safety return 'normal' life. Many people losing livelihoods cannot go on. sad thing solution here: amazing vaccines developed within year prevent serious disease death far safer getting COVID. 80% US vaccinated would making decision. Absent vaccination, need frequent cheap testing infected people could sheltered transmit. overlooked piece puzzle. tested feel sick, several times week.

The USA arguably worst hit country COVID pandemic. Healthcare workers suffering it. tired, burnt out, mentally exhausted, depressed, ragged bone. still see many COVID patients per day, risk getting sick high. they're telling get booster get sick, it'll minor? realize getting sick quarantine would use almost PTO days allotted year? forced quarantine, I'll waste precious vacation shuttered apartment, respite 49 weeks year? (I'll enough vacation 5 PTO days quarantine). 


No thank you. suffering last 18 months, feel healthcare workers *deserve* booster.  plausible maybe, researched? I'm sure would actually reduce body's ability fight off, anything make like first infection? trust job must trust science encounter daily basis job shown not?

Let servive pun dime. ""We normally run bare minimum ICU beds makes financial sense"" ""we always capacity"". disingenuous statement. That’s assuming everyone caught it, haven’t. Additionally

1) measures used prevent spread prevent hospitals getting overrrun. mortality rate static, changes based care available. Take away positive pressure ventilation, oxygen, icu beds, mortality rate rises.

2) without vaccines, people get coming years. data 18 months in… scary stuff. Get vaccinated Unvaccinated protected class. prove vaccinated due religion are, I’m sure there’s court case somewhere. good point one difference populations brought health care system knees pandemic resources scarce, infecting people ignorance. Grifters gonna grift. Chances every one doctors hawking kind wellness product like books supplements. 

Mental illness also discriminate.  essentially that’s man gallstone pancreatitis. died solely due lack resources taken COVID patients. hospitals doctor called likely multiple COVID patients ventilators virtually chance recovery. man condition close guaranteed chance recovery gotten surgery closer typical timing. 

I don’t know answer is. feeling patients hospitals doctor died COVID anyway already far gone. triage might need go. necessarily denying unvaccinated COVID patient treatment, recognizing chance recovery slim. man gallstone pancreatitis completely needless death. Appendicitis another one high probability full recovery addressed timely manner. gallstone pancreatitis, it’s also condition easily kill someone it’s *not* addressed timely manner. Something change people start dying completely treatable conditions. Yup. pedants u/RockadileRed pointed out. 
However, since base argument cohesiveness water molecules, mine.  
I expert chemistry, cohesiveness refers attraction molecules kind. 
Adhesiveness two dissimilar molecules bond stick together.  
Wetness defined ability liquid adhere surface solid. least that's us learnt. Again, pedants, we? 

So yes, water molecules attracted other. cohesive (the result hydrogen bonding Van der Waals forces). Adhesion result electrostatic forces two substances. 

So based argument, mean cohesive forces water molecules synonymous adhesive forces? adhesive forces cohesive forces. water's adhesive forces act 'wet', needs solid. tell me. water wet itself? 

Like said, expert. could entirely wrong.  Patient strong pain can't know seriously ill. Fuck mocking you. Better safe sorry. Good boy

Edit: autocorrect I'm leaving Exactly. entire system (all systems country) (are) broken. Beyond repair. one's fault... witnessing late stage capitalism mixed w world pandemic looks like. all. far remember, studies done Ivermectin treat Covid results showed Ivermectin real effect covid thus used treat it. really negative side effects though whoever wants could use guess. Obviously horse dewormer version though, taking plain stupid dangerous. resources inflexible would unrelated procedures, elective surgeries, wait times extended? 

Umm resources inflexible. 100 ICU beds need reserve 20 surgeries case something goes wrong, means take care 80 ICU patients. stop elective surgeries take care 100 ICU allocate capped portion ICU beds covid allow heart attack/ladder folk receive care.

First, everyone gets COVID they're careless, fair deny care. People go work, kids go school, etc. Second, hard justify leaving perfectly good ICU bed empty case someone falls ladder COVID patient gasping breath ER. hospitals considered triaging based vaccine status that's terribly popular idea go out, consider rationalising enforcement measures tickets public endangerment breaching public health order. 

I'm half states country even mandate masks, let alone allow ticketing breaking COVID Using rapid testing, rather passports, certain indoor establishments, we'd know antibodies, allow contact tracing.

Rapid tests rapid (15-45 min) 100% accurate. also significant % people make antibodies COVID all, rapid tests work them. cheaper, easier, safer make sure everyone vaccinated.  used be, too. Sorry, guess worded wrong regarding “cause”. meant say people may turned away telling “just google it” something useful share. enjoy googling finding relevant info, everyone time patience busy world, try include relevant links make reference. fair, types always brag they're willing die country. covid death acceptable death, suppose  Perfectly fine w eating w friends vaxxed know wash hands cover coughs come near they're sick. thing frustrates soft-handed vaccination approach.

Stay safe KN95 found comfortable, vs N95 masks tried out. think size, fit, etc. important end. suspect KN95s targeted at/from Asia market likely comfortable effective. recently, US really done surgical masks health reasons, N95 construction.

If meant broader set mask options:

**Cloth:** continues shown modest impact, like 10-20% effective

**Surgical:** effective compared cloth expected, iirc something like 40-50%

**KN95/N95:** seen numbers, expectation near 100% effective used consistently.

Even 10-20/40-50% rates cloth surgical masks likely based outcomes, ie: assuming imperfect use. see lot mask mandates too, people's individual anecdotes. Stuff like ""I wore mask grocery store every single time, got covid went, maskless, indoor birthday party 30 people"". Masks definitely work wearing :) planning to, buddy. I'm real curious dodgy doctor's spout load bs treatments twitter. timeline makes high quality content  important public place stuffing face around people may may great hygiene?

To own. Remember landlords evil people exploiting tenants? Okie dokie, friend. prescribed doctors help Covid symptoms.

Not offers proven benefit.

In vial, Ivermectin damages virus dose required achieve effect human toxic human.

So, no, legitimate prescriptions COVID.

Some doctors issue prescriptions off-label use regardless shows effect med low side effects. Human dosing relatively safe harm aside from:

\- false expectations

\- excuses patient refusal take recommended action (VAX)

\- dramatically increases demand low-use drug potentially affecting supply people need label use one case admitted that's agency's contact tracers tournament organizer. many cases think would happen among venue, players, families would go unreported? 

who knows? states told people attended certain football games quarantine week without even record many cases stemmed games backwards, friend. 

Not every hospital emergency covid status. put 80% “other critical emergencies” usually fill beds nobody’s vaccinated? Hospitals become covid hotspots filled extremely vulnerable patients. count? dozen? Landlords Evicting tenants paying rent = evil

Landlords evicting tenants vaccinated = service humanity And? interview claims prize change life, reality she’s already wealthy.  overwhelming evidence people simply change minds MATTER WHAT. can't even count number social media posts antivaxer gets covid dies family remains staunch antivaxers covid deniers.

I 100% pushing antivaxers back line excluding care via triage. need recognize they'll scream bloody murder start shooting hospitals FYI brother law got green card update tdap mmr 10 years ago. triggered conversation doctor said get well since 30 years ago since last vaccine. like morons saying masks 100% effective need them. Every time see want smash head something.

Thank god covid skews towards elderly. feel like playing Mario Cart

COVID blue shell along require anything. report whatever know/suspect choose there. Even approved, nothing stopping people groups would like get actually getting it. Part also due inhumane rules surrounding sick leave US. encourages people show work even symptoms course extra problematic working healthcare, elderly care etc.

In developed countries, sick leave count towards PTO days. fact, get sick vacation/PTO, get reimbursed vacation day counts sick day, vacation day. shows bad American education is. hate pointing truth. Consider 33% Americans go college. High school essentially college prep. Thateand 2/3 Americans never actually get proper terminal education. 

What good learning write solid thesis never going write papers college? learning high level math? 

There much every American needs know, media literacy, go write resumes business emails, interpret statistics, etc, etc majority never adequately taught it.     assuming available day town, i'd choose moderna Nice, I'll try same. Right? I'm ridiculous know. hate sick matter is. true research also showed numbers casualties people would died anyway following weeks health issues.

Studies difference death vs previous years gives better understanding impact believe. Oh man, imagine level pain bullshit they're putting with. soooo frustrating. exactly. conspiracies contradict and/or people's behavior match conspiracy choose believe COVID even worse lot emergencies? person actually makes bed COVID seems weeks slowly die. hospital burst appendix like weekend.  Yes, full-blown crisis. think control, unvaccinated patients lowest priority. die it, well, better healthy man gallstones. 

Other people compassion everyone. compassion actively made situation worse. expect transmission schools mimic transmission rest community. Economist estimates 800 thousand 880 Yep, mine twisted caused entire abdomen basically covered infected gooey shit. almost septic. Spent 10 days hospital drain (about 5-10mm tube hanging stomach collect fluid) stomach bellybutton top pubic area held together staples. keep staples weeks, two weeks biggest struggle getting walk laps around hospital wing congeal.

It sounds like getting tonsils people cause pretty routine ruptures, fucking sucks ruptures you. Thanks kind words! There's number studies natural immunity comparing natural immunity vaccines, nobody scared them. time start turning away unvaccinated. choose dies, clearly got people wanted take chances, poor kid appendicitis fuck's sake. read Jehovah's Witnesses changed anti vaccination pro vaccination back 1952. article reviewed vaccine view well known world's religions came list half dozen nearly unknown Christian denominations objections vaccines. Mostly faith healer sects may may still around. Yup. makes happy. shows GOP getting severely desperate they’re resorting this. Same, NY. insane city can't believe places apathetic rates worse initial clusterfuck. NY actually pretty decent comparison. got upvotes someone posts tomorrow. I'd say US least, probably good thing say true things people fucking listening.  Sounds like someone sucks shit triaging (is word?) You’re starting sound less like housing advocate like housing extremist. advocate tenants’ rights general without unconditionally giving higher priority preventing COVID infections deaths.   also agree that, whatever number is, always much larger figures conservatives keep inventing. You’re still it. So, like whooping cough, guess recommended get covid19 booster every pregnancy? makes sense, thank you. sort get - gallbladder removed 2012ish (Though scheduled surgery) - apparently took out, said like month rupturing would similar state.  


I think happening now, surgery would pushed back would erupted would crapshoot able emergency surgery not.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I'm sick enough go ER, take solace I'm rushed see someone - means better others.  crazy. Ambulances bringing steady last 10 hours. Old young, seen really sick little kid head Covid hall. scary thing every Covid person comes potential exposure us. Granted got vaccinated. exposed idiots want take shot? feels like stabbed repeatedly. throwing time threw felt like burst again. Unreal pain.  get saying, basic statistics. We've similar conversation transportation safety. flip around, ""How many people want let die?"" There’s misunderstanding Ivermectin amongst us Liberals well. 

Ivermectin used humans, different form drug specifically meant humans. prescribed doctors help Covid symptoms. 

HOWEVER, lot Conservatives buying HORSE form drug using themselves. resulted cases poisoning amongst crowd. 
Joe Rogan went doctor definitely human form drug prescribed him. 

I remember saying immune system enough fight it, got spent thousands dollars treatment. know, something fan base SURELY afford. anecdotal stories unvaccinated people causing issues hospitals okay. However; anecdotal stories vaccine caused adverse reactions work, okay? fucking double standard. Dear conservatives Trump mandated vaccine would try impeach vilify call authoritarian it. lost many people getting vaccine impede freedom. fair, anyone healthcare (in hospital setting) vaccinated almost definitely exposed contracted SARS-CoV-2 already. shouldn’t still get vaccinated, natural immunity post infection vaccine immunity prior infection. unvaccinated nurses probably already infected SARS-CoV-2, consequently tested twice weekly active infection, aren’t really threat anyone around vaccinated nurses. Yes, boosters sense vehemently opposed them. However, ready authorize general public, sense supporting something pre-emptively.  availability thing? Like held second dose get first doses in? interval started recommendation? gets medical advice Twitter?! Lol … time alive!  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Lol use lotion work can't shift. everyone forget ""flatten curve"" thing? whole fucking point! supposed help avoid! agree, following tested protocol Israel individuals became eligible 5 months 2nd dose, considered fully vaccinated anymore 6 months past second dose. never really understood 8 month recommendation, would make large percentage people vaccinated eligible time. think better solutions issue, starting people certain age working downward there. obvious analysis restaurant infection cases China, year ago.


Distancing, cloth masks &amp; surgical masks, ventilation, air filter, UV, vaccine, etc help.


But good masks (at least N95 equivalent proper fitting information &amp; practice) important key element preventing respiratory infection. 


With Delta, (more) eye protection upgrading protective gears might needed.


The contaminated air evenly diluted, never know actual concentration would encounter, making unpredictable &amp; uncontrolled situation. So, OVER-PROTECTION safer way cannot know adequate, guaranty safety. first part comment absolutely correct, second part maybe much. trump absolutely wanted vaccines legacy. anything, democrats skeptical much really coming quickly taking credit others work. nonstop harping made vaccines everyone thank him. story gotten twisted facts, fuck know internet ruined. also made confusing getting shot live tv. 

It even highlighted farewell speech…

*When nation hit terrible pandemic, produced one, two vaccines record-breaking speed quickly follow. said couldn’t done, it. called medical miracle. that’s they’re calling right now, medical miracle. Another administration would taken three, four, five, maybe even 10 years develop vaccine. nine months. grieve every life lost pledge memory wipe horrible pandemic all.* russia monopoly misinformation. actually coming US. miss epicenter antivax? Dry fully bring little lotion after. weather comment, person TWIVs real 😂
Great question! concern would wife infected not, could guarantee high viral load transfer vulnerable site, nares. breakthrough infection recently (clinically ‘mild’, really shitty), quarantined separate room husband remained COVID negative able care me. area, PCR testing free basically 24 hr turnaround. free/fast PCR testing available you, could better option PCR testing detects virus earlier infection increased sensitivity asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic individuals. Moderna want use 50mcg boosters immune response would enough take care delta. Biden administration wants also submit data 100mcg guess it’ll take longer. Honestly lower dose prob appropriate booster. hard break cycle stupidity make damn thing available....if want , get it.... want it....now.  That’s great. Would say gone despite (lack consistent) social gathering/distancing limits? vax perspective, don’t think countries - average - high per capita last time checked although admittedly it’s since I’ve checked"
