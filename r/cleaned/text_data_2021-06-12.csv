Losing weight hard. seeing risks chose drop 60-65 lbs went BMI 33 25. took 9 months. point starving eating food enjoy. Weight loss achieved entirely calorie deficit diet exercise needed (although health benefits). Regardless Covid added years life feel better.

It's truly bizarre public health agencies chose encourage people lose weight obese overweight. Seems like real missed opportunity. took niece get vaccine CVS yesterday parents busy ask ID. official yet may recommendation future.

I age repartition numbers Italy. Yet, strain Spanish flu disappeared. like world strain Spanish flu magically mutated once. mutated, Spanish flu strain disappear people either died developed natural immunity it.

Something similar could happen current virus variants causing covid. could develop immunity (this time induced vaccine naturally acquired) variants could died out. would still coronavirus wild could, like flu, mutate future deadlier variants causing another pandemic.

That's think impossible get rid deadly strains. Hanging quiet desperation English way. may become less true get Epsilon.

I think people want risk take Astra allowed also think people don‚Äôt offered vaccine that‚Äôs safe them, especially young women. IN: Vaccinated Californians showing similar symptoms. Explosive diarrhea receiving free meal Taco Bell. US news story. ubiquitous trend appears occurring hospitals nationwide.

Context important. either

4. May well live new normal.

But relate back Mother Nature Earth sorts trouble proliferation specific species consumes much resources, creates much pollution detriment species, disrupting balance.

‚ÄúWhy deforestation extinctions make pandemics likely
Researchers redoubling efforts understand links biodiversity emerging diseases ‚Äî use information predict stop future can‚Äôt talk Netherlands idea would get info. know however Belgium made data available open data, anyone get numbers via api (which ourworldindata seems numbers match official data). site info-vaccinatie based dataset. I'm 28 got first dose last week. Lots friends around age also got shot. living Wallonia. explanation people hospitalized reasons (possibly unrelated pneumonia) without tested. much AA population vaccinated

Google friend. Apparently numbers poor enough people concerned it. think like said new shot needs developed. first Gen shots longer work. 

We back March 2020 Might ask population figures used Belgium? Let‚Äôs make new shot Unfortunately virus stick timetables. 

Truth that, Australia, opening costs keeping closed (the US spent 1.7T domestic stimulus).. changes things. capitalism work. 41 year old Belgium whose earliest possible first dose 18 june, younger cousins siblings law italy got first dose weeks ago, find hard believe.

Everyone know age slightly younger European countries already vaccinated. Actually calculation based info info-vaccinatie.be world data get exactly numbers graph. sure numbers used NL won‚Äôt try compute NL numbers say least Belgian numbers shown graph correct. 1. supposed correct sentence.
2. ""They"" people Belgium, ""vaccines"" word used title
3. ""They vaccine"" would still make sense, ""vaccine"" noun. ""vaccinate"", correct verb correct form (without -s end). guys think return big events like Lollapalooza? know requiring attendees either vaccinated take PCR test day, there‚Äôs way people going fake vaccine cards. 

I‚Äôve seeing UK experiencing rise cases despite relatively high vaccination rate, fear big events mixed many people wearing masks anymore may lead us path. reasonable concern, paranoid? What's difference domestic vs international travel? virus Swing miss. Covid long incubation starts spreading symptoms appear. perspective already successfully without need keep host alive. course fatality rate higher set stricter quarantine controls. mortality low enough breed complacency, encourage people take risks, long enough incubation test patience. every year wait makes older! time waste! rather die now! 

oh...

wait... would 2033. asked many people pull masks since March 2020. can‚Äôt even count many people said ‚Äúpull mask up‚Äù least ignore second type idiots. nah, second dose every vaccine works fine delta. vaccines absolute miracle modern science, consistently exceeded expectations.   rely private labs many tests, menu ""this test lab uses swab, costs much, takes long results, parameters positivity"", would help much. 174 domestic cases, 26 deaths. Yes, worldometer corona data bit shady, used population figures. put trust ourworldindata figures Netherlands well. know countries, Netherlands bad. comparing data last couple months/year official Dutch coronavirus dashboard certain metrics (including vaccinations) data often outdated, updated regularly completely wrong. already warned it, respond message. 

I like use OurWorldInData well though, awesome site best site compare COVID-19 statistics. easiest quickest. watch using data. time know countries dashboards bit, I'd always prefer use statistics directly dashboard. Legit wouldn‚Äôt mind secession states. Always dragging rest country nearly every metric  need new shot.

Like second generation vaccine. Maybe Valneva waiting for. would want wear one position, least face shield.   Recent research shows natural immunity effective, effective, vaccine induced immunity. spread misinformation please. sort pedantic quirk.

If viral particles get you, likely infect cells. develop ""an infection""? No. virus spread much inside you? No. cells get infected? Yes. able spread virus others? No. 

When I've answering questions this, that's sort path take. LiB sTaTeS article: 

‚ÄúThe European Medicines Agency‚Äôs safety committee said capillary leak syndrome must added new side effect labelling shot.

It said people previously sustained condition receive vaccine.‚Äù

Ah, freedom believe conspiracy theories put people's lives danger. people work damn hospital. baffling they're working hospital staff *and* refusing get vaccinated unfounded beliefs. Hoarding happened Germany, too. Toilet paper, pasta, flour, soap hand sanitizer nowhere found like 1-2 months shops limited much could buy. Funny story...she wasn‚Äôt. used work her, verge getting let go crackpot theories quit. Florida uncomfortably hot humid year-round. think goal 70% achieved ? Holy FUCK. used work nurse. absolutely NUTS. freaking start pandemic, saying COVID fake, also 5G causing COVID, yet also refusing take care COVID patients. fucking ICU. could happier quit- though we‚Äôre pretty sure get fired. do. example, that's change flu vaccine every year address think dominant influenza strains new season. still see lot comments elsewhere vaccines ""don't prevent getting infected, protect ending hospital"" ? [serious showing indeed prevent infection quite high amount, yet idea still common see barely corrections false information shared. Shocker there. Also probably non-mask wearing, hoax believing. 

Covid-19 variants feed upon folks keep going more. read original language (Italian) I'm well aware Agamben's position pandemic. bother engage request. guess then, amount karma got post speaks itself. good day. drove Louisiana couple weeks ago way back Northeast Texas. first time state...and god-willing, last. thankful could leave expeditiously. imagine option.

I actually pretty relieved grandma died, dementia ill health robbed quality life and, end, even ability communicate.

It's pretty understandable similar situations death Covid could seen light.

Well closest Canada many ‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt protected COVID-19 experience COVID-19 worse‚Äù?

Why that? well CFR 0.3% ages 2-40, 50% infections completely unsimptomatic, trial run countries early pandemic small infection rates.

Point people risk medical staff definitely get vaccinated. I'm curious, toilet paper hoarding happened countries? uniquely American phenomenon? think read also happened Australia? ""Does virus features suggest created lab?""

Practically everyone getting sick unvaccinated. Taiwan intention mass testing. Paywall..... Coed sleep overs bomb. Kids missing out. Four lessons think learn COVID-19 prevent another utter clusterfuck future:

1. UN need greater powers enact enforce emergency guidance individual nations pandemic times.

2. International Criminal Court needs get tough political leaders disregard emergency guidance, also deliberately propagate spread dangerous pathogen declared global pandemic over. there's criminal offence international law, create one leaders brought Hague fuck catastrophically future. We've seen several variants including current Delta variant come this.

3. Misinformation propaganda almost weaponized political groups even entire nation states crisis. needs curbs free speech pandemic times combat this.

4. society, need stop disregarding illness, especially workplace. used work jobs draconian-as-fuck sickness policies called sick three times twelve month period (even legit reasons), subject immediate disciplinary meeting probably sacked. absolute culture shock see workplaces actually enforce COVID-19 guidelines government told to. Britain kind nation traditionally expected people still show work even they're coughing lungs incredibly sore throat barely even speak.  keep discussion monthly meetings wish little bit clear. think it‚Äôs security theater especially whole point come open mouth still wish clarity included means staff staff patients both. occasionally watch Russian YouTuber called NFKRZ, one recent vlogs walking Moscow gave impression Russian people give damn social distancing now. isn‚Äôt unexpected. aren‚Äôt woods quite yet. getting it‚Äôs free all. stupid

Trying pray 'Rona away surprising then. Make 3 shot course second booster Hmm. thought something say. would great mentality fact viruses mutate given large enough number transmissions. still need Unvaccinated stay safe vaccinated made unsafe new strain.  remove political stigma certain states vote progress is; Alaska make it.

I also wouldn‚Äôt gotten second dose first made mine worse. Already Covid anyway Sounds like made poor choices. Good point.

Grow Hand hygiene, I‚Äôll probably keep wearing masks situations it‚Äôs major inconvenience, like grocery store bank example. there‚Äôs little evidence vaccinated people spread virus. people still restricted? videos people collapsing, that‚Äôs pretty much it. idea context even actually filmed around time posted. likely didn‚Äôt see happen anywhere else spontaneously dying you‚Äôre enjoying walk serious COVID illness progresses. understand saying vaccine producers recommended x, I‚Äôm pointing don‚Äôt domestic production want get many people protection fast possible, prioritizing first doses makes perfect sense. already know reduces hospitalizations deaths that‚Äôs huge. realize names articles real human beings lived entire lives making judgment someones entire existence based 1 event stupid fuck?

It‚Äôs longer even illegal sex someone knowing HIV without telling many places - 100% death rate. Yet, someone deserves 10 years prison coughing someone almost certainly covid negative covid worst 98% survival rate.

Yes, appears ‚Äòmurica unfounded conspiracy, social media, trumped (sorry pun) pure science. seriously worry future. complicated, Russia large. overall rate remains linear regions vaccine shortages finally got vaccine, people waited availability continue contribute rate. However, take look Moscow vaccinations started early: began strong 0.5 million vaccinated mid February (when vaccine basically available anywhere else Russia), reached 1 million people vaccinated mid April (8% population Moscow, Russia whole 6%), 1.3 million May 14 (11% city, Russia 9%), ~1.5 million June 3 (12% population, Russia whole reached 12% well). rate Moscow really decreased early stage lags behind rest Russian regions despite vaccine available hassle every shopping mall. I'm afraid see decrease demand regions well, rate become even slower.   best part people laid due covid (which understand degree) need hire ton people one wants come back work combination corporate greed wanting go back new normal. type stress something see while, hopefully less covid vaccinations finally accessible states. article talking about. Apparently individuals caught COVID hospital, meaning quite possible immune responses already reduced. Imagine thinking coughing people ""compliance."" Slightly curious, priors? Whenever news reports unusually harsh sentence, don‚Äôt always tell perp history bad behavior judge take consideration sentencing.

I'm pretty sure sentence coughing spitting. Unlike flu, caused influenza virus, colds caused coronavirus. ""common cold"" caused different types viruses, rhinovirus coronavirus two common causes.

One example [229E coronavirus, usually gives cold, rarely cause severe pneumonia ARDS might lead death. 

4 7 known strains coronavirus typically causes mild symptoms common cold, also 3 strains lead increased mortality morbidity, SARS, MERS, COVID-19.

The milder strains may well co-evolved humans longer length time, natural selection lead milder variants becoming common people catch die therefore allow virus circulate population easily. #1. Racecar drivers wear seatbelts take precautions.

You know everything. judgement necessarily what's best everyone. need accepting people's opinions.

It's hard understand spectrum opinions vs one forced opinion better. take whole lot philosophizing get conclusion. true last year half.   FDA approved mean safe, history proven many times. They've approved emergency used studies done far proven effectiveness safety.

We know future, know saved hundreds thousands lives give us back normalcy. can't wait 3-7 years get approved old way. 

The problem anti-vaxxers/skeptics free taking it, free infect others around kill them. Unfortunately, health care workers free tell f-off enjoy immunity. Sad freedom go ways. diseases vaccinate against, like polio measles, mutate slowly. flu mutates quickly many, many strains flu. 1) cold year, want keep way. 

2) amazing sanitary slobbery spit-talkers chronic nose-wipers contained.

3) want show solidarity can't get vaccinated. 

4) look everyone's ugly faces. Fuck around find out. Would tough convince people get vaccine true   Spanish Flu never eradicated, mutated less deadly form. pandemic viruses usually do. Thanks explanation. We‚Äôre aligned. sure hope variants don‚Äôt breakthrough.

Covid neither. Mexican food California imagine even wanting eat taco bell. Last time ate shitting blood afterwards. Yup, people average lifespan less 30,000 days. means pick millions people, statistically hundreds die next day vaccine, instead range issues.

There multiple cases deaths falsely linked vaccines, someone location Noordwijkerhout died getting vaccine media brought news insinuating might died Pfizer shot, case.

However, media insinuated case threat vaccination campaign. reason flagged article externally organization helps complaints towards media however said help me. Weirdly enough, day after, media outlet brought statement:

""We heard many found news dangerous part antivax campaign thought important share news way we'll keep like that""

Basically allowing antivax sounds society exist. I'm freedom press find disgusting make clickbait articles profit resulting deaths people refused vaccine news article. FDA approval everything, good way telling general public mostly safe.

And emergency authorization vaccines received good. Full approval would make zero difference point. actually know people waiting get approved. 

Well yes handful idiots know anti-vaxxers lol. try group together idiots. 

That's exactly I'm going anyone using FDA approval excuse. dumb reason latched onto people fucking clue FDA approval right make decision varying opinions better society everyone follow rules time.

Went work day shots. painfully ignorant way think FDA approval. magic seal promises everything ok.

None fucking idiots outright refusing vax give shit FDA approval, would find excuses get it. FDA approval means nothing people whose brains stuffed full conspiracy theories hatred government. Tell he's ineligible get vaccine, see says sucks! I'm sorry hear that. get tinnitus time well?

And yeah I'm honestly limbo right now. I've got protection one dose least I'd feel lot better 2. still feel comfortable leaving house unless absolutely necessary idk that's ever gonna change unless get second dose, really want get.

Can source statement? Ouch... hope ""cough entitlement"" worth ten years life, lost.

In short(ish, sorry), liberals still probably slower err side caution covid, I‚Äôd imagine still wearing them. coupled recent stigma anti mask probably make keep mask on, imo Airlines, especially regionals, scrambling ramp demand. got hired pilot!

Unsurprising list Good luck, hope take much time ER I'm starting think people really expect us ""do right thing"" completely isolating another year more.

You strawman argument. seems political affliction. know fact SF Seattle among gayest (and extension, liberal) cities US. seems conservatives ones likely seen without masks. ‚Äòall hospitalized patients‚Äô article taking about, three. Three people. 

It also goes say, ‚ÄúLyn-Kew, too, one two extremely ill patients who'd fully vaccinated.‚Äù

I miss sub actually cared science facts. It‚Äôs shame it‚Äôs turned into. Yep. see problem calling bunch people friend long realize going need them. dad told years ago one true friend. I'll 34 couple months think absolutely right.  ‚ÄúWe set aside 5 tacos per restaurant honor promotion‚Äù lol live Seattle pretty much everyone‚Äôs still masked. Work recently stopped requiring masks you‚Äôre vaxxed, everyone‚Äôs still got on. managers took show support encourage people to, almost one has. I‚Äôd say probably 99% 95% customers also still wearing masks. think Sputnik vaccine tested, probably effective possibly dangerous.

That's likely true.   Spherical, round. true, however impact virus is, can't rules possibility virus. Associated development natural protection hope. Spanish flu ""eradicated"" without even vaccine, even today's strain flu could become deadlier future. hope something similar virus. Similar results could achieved strains coronavirus, virus family existing centuries. people claim hospitals inflating covid deaths falsely using cause death something else. Honestly understand discount Covid simply someone completely different terminal disease. Anyone additional sources corroborate this? certainly _want_ believe it, seems little hand wavy me. Selecting subset ""large"" states include study pretty big red flag right bat.

Vice premier Golikova: claimed, someone drop alcohol vaccination 42 days - probably would become incapacitated entire life. People figured - vaccine much pressure, even single drop alcohol would cause severe health effects - better keep away vaccine.

I find great source actual hospitalizations (IE: CDC,) according site below, 20,000 weekly hospital admissions 6/1. total 2,473 breakthrough hospital admissions TOTAL required care breakthrough case.

Again, total, 503 people died breakthrough infections. averaging 441 covid deaths per day, falling floor, thanks vaccines.

OurWorldInData figures also seem bad. pretty old match data national statistics offices. vaccination rate Netherlands completely wrong also data Belgium seems different. twitter user seems end different rate per 100 Belgium me, either used different population figure, vaccination rate both.

This false, see stats UK  right exactly limiting time around people lately. I'm hoping so. next weeks really important small delay go long way reducing cases hospitalisations kind shit dumb, get 10 years. thing would expect kids, punished like kid : spank publicly everything's okay.

I would never something like this, especially covid... least that's tell myself. truth think that's something reach human. 10 years looks bit much something easy do. 

And dumb shit, done shit like even remember. got punished cases. got 10 years.

Yes, kids, he's adult. what, going tell moment 18 stopped childlike shit instantly ? resident Russia, find real numbers? I'm genuinely curious cause idea. We're better Texas Florida stopped reporting daily case counts highest country. dentist's office employees wearing unless working someone signs asking people waiting area wear one, that's worth, live area people taken pandemic seriously. 

Maybe try calling local health department asking them. Sorry, allow opinion pieces. there‚Äôs vaccine cervical one, CDC advised past experiences allergies ingredients, get vaccine. Another headlines impact without lot valuable information. many ended ICU? Discharge rate? Underlying health conditions? Deaths? Numbers age? 

I honestly think headlines damage good. trying impact vaccinated simply gives questions answers. People won‚Äôt get vaccinated look headline suddenly run get shot.

10 years makes sense bc intent execution injury. Less hoarding whole lot millions people buying use-at-home loo roll rather workplaces using work-style zig-zag stacks giant rolls.

Just Time means supermarkets stock according computer-predicted patterns time year, stock shelves 'just time' need stacked big expensive warehouses.

Just Time systems break shards buying patterns change abruptly way system predict.

The mass, abrupt change consumption work (industrial loo roll, restaurant/caf√©/sandwich eating, centralised broadband) consumpton home (retail loo roll, home cooked lunches, distributed broadband) broke whole lot things.

Vanishingly people hoarded. Hundreds millions changed buying habits radically within days.  really evidence animal reservoirs matter much COVID?

Now, much less dramatic methods effective can‚Äôt spread nearly quickly. differentiate manipulation they've done since early parts pandemic, several thousand excess deaths went unaccounted for, ""fuck lives we're trying sportsball dammit"" sentiment strong. hesitant US. Unfortunately convince many get vaccinated.
For bigger vaccination rate need carrot.
Carrot -money. offer cash get people vaccinated, rabbits come. offerings lotteries effective. break x dollars person vaccinated. think $200 would get larger portion people vaccinated much faster. Yeah know sure kok stop functioning future!

/s Reddit me, massaging means slightly changing enhance diminish actual trend, manipulate means severe changing data seems unpopular here, certainly true. pretty much Australia did, without vaccine! vaccinated people large percentage population restrictions don‚Äôt need nearly drastic.

Also, tools contact tracing much effective.  I‚Äôd feel safe going. I‚Äôm vaccinated, worst happen bad cold even isn‚Äôt likely.

Gotta start living point. stating obvious, give less effective home-grown vaccines window widely accepted.

Nevertheless, demonstrate dangerous delta variant means rest laurels.

I‚Äôm SD.  shocking. still believed caronavirus relation common cold turn something else? still believed relation common cold mean potentially vaccines common cold? nah havent seen anyone genuinely critique past ""gdp good indicator economic health."" besides, looked data points, 1918 flu pandemic well nordic countries faired corona, correlation found. said, fair critique say study found correlations, causations, thats doesnt throw cold water study much don‚Äôt think long prison sentences violent rapists ‚Äúbarbaric,‚Äù how‚Äôs that? We'd probably people biting zombies prove zombies fake. say testing state/local area severely decreased. use places everywhere, constantly testing.

I brought baby Dr day dry cough, fever, ask one question regarding covid.

Not saying like everywhere, GA definetly different. Zero new cases I'm thinking go without mask... but.... testing active cases anymore that's why. 

Funny that's exactly Trump saying said tested most, time, results. I'm defending anything man done said, practice sure glad live America CA Senator Scott Wiener recently attempted pass bill requiring increased density around transit stops. beat NIMBYs marching morons. appropriate? family moved Dallas Louisiana. reason knew meant early retirement job offer good. used watch zombie movies think people movie stupid things people irl. pandemic made realize movies right along. 1 bil 870 million quite different, it?

I'm masks stuff, gotten vaccinated respect rules, sentence someone coughed? Ffs.. people okay that, we're living dangerous world pandemic shown true colors people. isn‚Äôt said all, curious long sentence think imposed rape, burglary, assault, etc. Probably harsh sentence, shows people need take seriously. measures propose achieve goal? 2003. still remember fondly state level?

No, states would NIMBY argue housing built states state.

The entire point federal control zoning would prevent that. nah problematic think multiple reasons: 1. tech industry necessarily thrive pandemic 2. economies large states diversified, comparison looks large states 3. many states rely tech industry still faired better stringent lockdown measures states flaunted measures

for example, news broke week two ago california circles, skeptical look data feds, even comparing industries, lockdown states tend fair well. example, terms food service sector, florida 85% gdp pre-pandemic times california also 85% Oh ok. stopped reading full article hundreds stories like ago. exhausting. Arkansas Delta already 10 % new cases (rather: already 2-4 weeks ago since data real-time) test positivity rising steadily happened last year, result sentencing. really get though. Assuming everyone goes quarantine procedure events closed public go opinion. Sophie cut it. offense you‚Äôre much..

Totally kidding, set :) Thank you. fascinating. What's race composition Fairfax County? point isn‚Äôt get reflect behavior learn it. agree goal *in general*, reaction generous plea deal makes think impossibility instance. point goal simply keep away people. don‚Äôt care one bad day - proved capable another person, seem show remorse it, thus kept away people long possible prevent happening again.

And yes think prison conditions deplorable. Prisons hell earth means make humane, shouldn‚Äôt send people there, send less time. problem prison conditions, sentence. Yeah I've lived whole life people know work government. ones really work directly politician, mostly like accounting type work government agency(I got couple friends one works Pentagon works NSA). get wife back. head fat want make sure buzzers get everything vaccines live. can't get Covid them. built new H Mart right work Fairfax. way home awesome.

Essentially every time I'm exhausted I'll wonder Covid, father toddler often.

Thanks hate vaccinated(Pfizer) severe allergic reaction, hospitalized. anybody know logged vaccination card? Finland use Janssen? Proud county! I've fully vaccinated since April, glad see rest people part, especially since feel least early super slow roll out.  Wow! live here! Proud us! Yeah wasn‚Äôt like eye doctor lol.

I always thought particularly fortuitous timing. hope someday covid cold. Thank you! I'm glad we're least half way there!

I‚Äôm triggered. facts disagree political narrative Right, even vaccinated individual get infected variant, they‚Äôll likely asymptomatic even realize it. What's negligible case count?

1/1000, 1/10000, 1/100000? Since concerns mostly young people, looks like infection changed mostly asymptomatic something like bad cold. understanding some, lot, protection first shot. That‚Äôs people still catch Covid shots serious effects. Ideally stays cautious 2 weeks second shot she‚Äôll impressive protection. mess close finish line? Glad got shot! Texas? They‚Äôve rocking rolling never stopped one, big ole politically connected businessman crook who, till recently busy mocking doctors patients died fighting covid, sell snake oil cures... think misunderstood page.  stupidest conversations I‚Äôve pandemic nurses. I've always known melting pot think varied, wow!


I'm upset organize descending order percentages- something else? Commonsense approach, payback.! 
Unfortunately, several states faltered front.! theory, vaccines social distancing regulations avoid getting it, thought average infected person would pass six others.

We're dealing virus five times catching flu, ten times deadlier. sentence mask pulling coughing though. physical assault preceded it. lol yea tell havent done vaccines free, difficult people get vaccination sites take time work find child care getting vaccine potential side effects. It‚Äôs definitely financial challenge some, even free vaccine, variant appeared far transmissible every person infected passing *six* others

What? can't right... it? long benefits outweigh risks kids, would mistake offer EUA. broader implications society huge. wouldnt explain states dont much tech sector still performed better lockdown measures tho. data didnt say california #1 all, ahead states like texas/florida Thank you. 

My mom reaction first shot whatsoever 60.

Sorry mini rant/vent. live area that‚Äôs extremely masks vax make sheep. Studies show vaccine hesitancy crosses political affiliations, one kind. There‚Äôs nuance people aware issues need confronted.

I'd glad argue specifics care discuss. furthermore, despite booming tech sector, economy texas collapsed harder economy california, obvious strong tech sector isnt enough lot fun balsalmic vinegar shortage UK cooking programme(show). Yes We‚Äôre still feeling effects demand swings experienced last year. efficient supply chain, means there‚Äôs excess demand surges.  every shot given definitely vaccine? Agree Well there‚Äôs legal precedent employers mandating Houston case.

I wonder % unvaccinated going wear mask ? matter, even care wear masks anywhere? u reading mind? True, undercounting much peak, actual trajectory case numbers would look same. essential worker burned building rich peoples mansions. But... are? see truth eyes, won‚Äôt pretty lead end year vaccination surge IMO.

[And yet still plenty people deny COVID cause donating Pfizer Moderna vast majority Canadians waiting 2nd doses.

AZ already basically phased use. two donated never used first place help full vaccine % since we're already ~70% different brand arm Although Blackburn continued go higher Impoverished. Absolutely pointless, way tell difference vaccinated isn't. make covid around longer, people want slightly comfortable. would never accidentally vaccine trial friend mine‚Äôs business barely survived Michigan‚Äôs first lockdown didn‚Äôt survive second. even close. don‚Äôt even health insurance vacation time.  worst part me.

That what's ridiculous comes people like either can't bothered wear mask properly feel entitled wearing mask giving pathetic excuse saying ""they can't breath"" lung based illness shows complete total lack understanding comes virus. fail understand functions, attacks end results survive.

This guy chose violent towards someone, that's got 10 years. felt privileged assault nearly cost person eye potentially infecting them. balanced, straight forward, consistent expert this.

If vaccinated, time stop worrying. take people word. database access verify vaccination status time look one.

I'm masked every patient testing/treatment regardless vaccination status. odd sounds, really matter whether they're truthful not.

My experience vaccinated people tell within first minute. scheduled first second tell me, they're worried they'll miss opportunity they're sick. unvaccinated scared death covid, they'll let know well. suspect majority people honest me. Feel free ask @VaccinationEU Twitter exactly make daily graphs. data comes OurWorldInData (Oxford university) known reliable source numbers (worldometer bit shady data comes it‚Äôs validated). weird meme. hardest choices require strongest wills. end 2047

Or never top comment. ok stupid skuda. Ignorance bliss all. people world aren‚Äôt vaccinated yet. Hmmm? vaccines work Delta. What's known, long take body develope peak immunity, especially J&amp;J Astra Zeneka. Seems helps, least. Pfizer Moderns solid 66% rounds 2 weeks. 

Get second shot, people, required to. one 2 vaxxs less effective! Yes, Brazil showed similar resurgence infected get sicker, faster

as opposed uninfected? would literally whatever wanted. Dude, it‚Äôs final days planet, you‚Äôll never get live - it‚Äôs end. You‚Äôre gonna spend alone, locked room terrified? want travelling internationally *anywhere* right without vaccine. opposite miracle, good science. Hey now, unfair bring actual politics discussion politics. far far infectious flu. deadlier? massively, flu airborne would grind world halt too. Ever since flu made hallucinate, I've got flu shots every season, I'm fully vaccinated corona well.

People say they've flu cold. Anyone laid flu totally appreciate could kill older.  get one nose tests. pleasant all! One would think would better way testing thing year...    Yeah, actively going playing Russian Roulette either.  Im pretty sure states barely population it‚Äôs really much concern big picture. SIL talking summer vacation plans family recently. said would road trip cross-country US since national parks foreign tourists (I know they're swamped Americans), need deal rental car shortage, outdoor unvaccinated kids.

Irony would made wear mask properly prison. figured would much along.   
Didn't approve vaccine well US? expect OSHA probably would indeed classify dental offices healthcare facilities meaning staff would remain masked regardless vaccination. Whether applies administrative staff separate rooms actual dental chairs I'm sure.

Curious see Sinovac Sinopharm perform Delta variant.

This little detail paints picture person encountered. us object behavior, take comfort knowing got deserved. read sympathize attacker, hopefully think twice rage masks. offered two year plea deal. accept, wanted go trial, subsequently ten years. Yeah, bet go around intentionally coughing people either. That's practically fightin' words, even pandemic. two questions. first AZ, (30M pre existing conditions) terrible headache almost 4 days. took paracetamol advised doctor, help. 4 days sever headaches, continued episodes headache almost 3 weeks. 

It's little month (no headaches now), I'm really terrified getting second dose due experience. 

My questions are, 

1. normal headaches 3 weeks more? 

2. run stay active post getting jab, would reduce chances developing blood clots? Lost mine month‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs all.. Germany several weeks stores sold toilet paper soon got deliveries. Wait. 78% 12+ partly vaxed highest US? That's really high considering abundance vaccines available US. sent life prison. Oh well, least got something going.

I hope also blocked accessing Internet. blocked completely!

The majority social media account owned government agencies USA Canada constant attack anti-vaxx, anti-lockdown, anti-mask, etc people/bots.  like parents sound like they're talking 10 year old, 42 year old.  think huge mistake CDC drop mask mandate statistics show still necessary. really makes question people working CDC.  No. can‚Äôt ignore states go narrative lol. Florida probably state reliant tourism maybe Hawaii, who‚Äôs economy also took major hit, they‚Äôre pretty anomalous too. also important note individuals contracted delta variant hospital (indicating immune system likely compromised) time kids young vaccines go back school üò¢ article trash say play stupid games win stupid prizes  cited article says literally nothing support ultimate claim. Impressive. UK shelves empty weeks. idiots UK must seen people US fighting toilet roll decided stock themselves. shelves emptied rest panicked snapped whenever new batches came in. Luckily bought big pack panic hit.  minnesota norm saliva tests. accurate nose ones. easy do, spit vial reaches certain point  received J&amp;J vaccine early on, feel fully protected. availability high now, I'm considering getting least one dose Moderna Pfeizer. smart, foolish? feel like odds side effect much much lower odds contracting delta variant J&amp;J vaccination.  Remember Vetsy Devos? went music festival mexico six days past month fully vaxxed. get covid  Maybe bad customer funny That‚Äôs good argument man receiving LESS punishment, it‚Äôs argument rapists receive MORE. BUSINESS OWNERS states took COVID seriously probably worse though...

FL dude here. Clearly joke thought internet could take self-deprecating joke lightly. know thinking. saw first signs people fighting toilet roll. apocalypse hit people way worse anybody imagine. Worse selfish douche character zombie movie. I‚Äôm anti vax either. part one trials almost year ago. Little kids different physiology adults absolutely trials EUA much?, OSHA rule thrown out, one unvaccinated person room meant everyone mask. 

This talking verification victims alcohol poisoning one thing common: drink excessively. sick July 2021

She get sick July 2021, gotten July, yet. got sick July 2020 article stated. typo. Hell yeah. Even though support US (all food service get living wage).

If eating restaurant really enjoy food service tip whether like not. Shut take money. hope vaccine rollout continue reduce virus' propogation Hahah people dont like low effort sarcasm. thought ""if government would bail out/subsidize journalism"" thats right either, lol. like vice news targetted booze ads depress me, real :( Good! ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong, Walter ‚Ä¶‚Äù worry, would never get med school ethical stances like those.  delay sound bad long new ""freedom day"" date.

The worst part restrictions vaccines idea would end. think supposed wait shot. Allergies definitely dangerous. Garrisonville? stretch terrible, isn‚Äôt bad used extended hot lanes passed garrisonville exit. god awful hov lanes ended dumfries. 

495 terrible work too, took 3 hours go 2 miles once. Sigh Haha damn, that‚Äôs shit one comments gets downvoted people pushing narrative threatened data.  Cases hospitalizations rose last weeks restrictions place.

Why would decline next weeks continuing them? need double everyone getting 2 shots. back square 1 delta variant?   Fox so-called ""News"" viewership. Sounds like get jokes. Lighten little. post anti-vaxx. got teens soon eligible.

We can't take given vaccine approved 12 emergency use authorization Fall. Especially given concerns rare heart problems, likely want studies tens thousands approved look complication.

It's enough vaccines provide herd immunity. considered unethical put forth EUA medicine protect people specific child. bar Covid dangerous enough kids, still dangerous kids Fall apply. case numbers low, able meet bar. Fairfax handled rollout vaccine excellently. act together much opted statewide sign-ups around time signups ended.

Signed, high risk person got vaccine doses March prouder county. Source? live I‚Äôm skeptical statements dying businesses. Sounds like identifying bad customer conflating behavior Americans. I've never caused issue restaurant, maybe little work could get there. last two weeks, wife went Amalfi coast Italy Paris (on flight back actually) people we‚Äôve met genuinely enthused see Americans. example, tour guide came us Louvre yesterday heard accents said first Americans he‚Äôd seen year. don‚Äôt mind wearing mask getting test, historically amazing time see Europe without crowds. type comparison problematic industries impacted equally COVID. state whose economy heavily based tech companies significant advantage, whereas states whose primary industry tourism probably doomed suffer major economic hit regardless seriously took COVID.   post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Well, yet. California seems giving stores option want handle it, Newsom saying verification system state coming soon. Santa Clara county, government business entity needs collect vaccination information workers volunteers. wish decline tell them, can, considered unvaccinated. partially unvaccinated, option too. Anyone fully vaccinated needs asked status every 14 days, confirmed fully vaccinated. 

Those confirmed fully vaccinated place work, must mask. businesses want handle customers circumstances. Transportation, hospitals crowds over.. 5000 people think, exceptions. Watch video. Gottlieb explains clear terms difficult new variants evade vaccine.

Also, efficacies symptoms all. vaccines still much effective hospitalization/death.

So, short, totally disagree take. disagree it, CDC US government. Yeah, count zipcodes heavy industrial zones mandated shot records return work, Dallas, Texas almost 70% vaccinated! 
 
See, use fucked-up data, make idiots look good too! Maybe, yes. Yikes. That's quite trip. sounds insane, good looked others first! ;) getting bad uk again? bachelor's degree broke, still got vaccine ü§ôüèΩ welcome, Greece; hear similar things Europe.  Especially since don‚Äôt discuss GDP ‚Äòdid
better.‚Äô based percentage change? GDP? California already better GDP Texas Florida, economy slightly better 49 states combined. saying ‚Äòbetter‚Äô giving metric seems extremely suspicious. Variant become dominant strain

So correct terminology? I'd say probably 1/3 businesses around still require them. looking forward airport though next week. good you! I'm soon! Time served almost winter surge far fewer travel nurses doctors responding calls help. 

Fatigue real.

And competition normal staffing imbalances hospitals back normal nation wide elective emergency go along full open.  Sounds like lot explaining away stats don‚Äôt fit narrative mean yeah look states economies now. 

Massachusetts, one three New England states toughest restrictions, pretty much filled pockets dying dead businesses parts state. Granted statistics like people moving suburbs get city also played big role businesses every state effectively different ways trying deal trying make money given options had. Ultimately blame businesses, decent amount state governments, good enough job trying get people back work people going back newish normal. 20  Like everytime walk store without mask, show card? going say almost exact thing. would bet money thinks people would still agree jury rigged. imagine someone remorse level violence severely hurt innocent person first time last year parking lot, either. I'm glad chose jury. Yup live smack dab middle stretch. could drive home like 3 sit traffic lol  stretch Fredericksburg Woodbridge worst! I'm getting first shot next week agree, feels like would easy relax become complacent. Delta variant really fully protected 2 weeks \*second\* shot, plan continue live I'm unvaccinated then.

It also feels like countries opening way soon. happened needing 80% fully vaccinated herd immunity? work non-essential buisness (Casino) that's opened since last May. tribal business ok open. first 6 months extremely stressful. cases covid nothing done, people quarantined hung infected outside work. none worked closely person work were. explanation show symptoms til away work. One recent cases husband wife test positive. One worked day shift night shift 1 person shift quarantined that's HR decided contact traced people tested positive (before everyone could get vaxxed.) husband went work regularly would hang lunch room visit eating together...probably 3 feet apart. one quarantined, another employee worked department was. 

Currently casino short staffed across majority departments, employees working 6+ days straight, 8 hours day. toll known cases throughout property time worked taken employees visible I'm constantly wondering they're able it. 

I imagine essential employees serve communities whole pandemic feel. hope ends soon they're able relax. also similar observations 1918 ""Spanish"" flu. places locked harder, earlier eventually better economically  clear, expert, limited reading subject listening different experts, cut dry seems.

Again, maybe completely wrong, immune response dynamic static thing. such, initial B-Cell response (which percentage bandied about) T-Cells last longer initial B-Cells also virus understanding evaded yet.

With US healthcare expensive is, I‚Äôve considering retirement somewhere EU Canada. That‚Äôs ways off, though. culprit made small outbreak Wuhan become worldwide pandemic.

Wuhan happened Delta discovered. Nah, think one needs accurate needs use name people know. 'Sars-Cov-2' people know. know COVID-19. journalists kind thing. number people got vaccinated hospitalized? would slightly impressive Tim Horton‚Äôs currently good 20 years ago. It‚Äôs bleak moment. I'm going say religion never reason here, vaccinating healthcare professional Alabama answer definitely going politics first foremost. I'd say false news/conspiracy theories second reason.

I hear every single day, can't think single instance religion (or stem cells) reason vaccine hesitancy hey got snake handlers shit I'm sure there. catch Covid God forbid come across issue change mind? vaccine supposed reduce chances severe illness hospitalization. impression I've gotten far vaccinated get hospitalized generally elderly people worse effects virus.  Don‚Äôt know. Don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs yet preliminary research says 40% transmissible iirc. Agreed. refer efficacy vaccines referring % emergency authorization updated data? Nobody said vaccines completely prevent illness, there's still small chance get Covid. could get tested. sick, vaccine help prevent getting seriously ill. Good luck! Whats also shitty immunocompromised, even get vaccinated, bodies develop antibodies due vaccine vaccine work well them.  *Nicolas COVID literally cannot use reverse transcriptase like HIV does. physically impossible. got beat. got vaccine band-aid applied well!

I never told I'd get free band-Aid well. R0 delta? thought 5 UK variant, Delta may 7-8. least brought potatoes back. newer strains reinfect people previously covid?   Lol haven‚Äôt gotten vaccine yet. emergency use primary concern. spent hours looking seems come across issue vaccine Nobody would responsible since voluntarily took non-approved vaccine. Change mind please data policy (in US anyway) changed days ago. data efficacy vaccines calculating probably least effective good mask anyway. personally still wear mask even work, seen workplaces many vaccinated people stopped. 

For kids, really hope kids' school district keeps masking fall kids age eligible vaccine time become fully vaccinated. mean, Covid highly contagious individual children get sick make entire classroom sick masked.

Yes, vaccinated person protected unvaccinated person. small kids personally prefer roll dice test efficacy vaccine, roll wrong number end bringing Covid home making kids sick. keeping many precautions -- also feeling huge relief vaccinated, unlikely get sick definitely seriously sick.  literally shows source. Click ""share population"", ""vaccinated"" column number people least one dose. Canada shown second (among countries 100K population), Malta.

Canada initially heavily prioritised first doses long gap first second. Resulting large proportion population currently first dose, even though second doses.

They going full tilt second doses, woth help huge boost vaccine supply Moderna ( enough 1/4 country next 3 weeks). ""fully vaccinated"" stat also catch quickly. 27yo brother side effects. golfed 18 holes next day ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Well, I'd say number Timbits I've consumed taken years life instead added them. think heard interview. CEO absolutely certain they‚Äôd win.

Hell hospital might slander case based accusations making air hospitals ethics. That's 5 days old.

Canada 64.11% total population. Israel But‚Ä¶ vaccinated lot people reduce case numbers deaths tho.  5g going around cell reception's gonna great! Intrigue good sir never really understood Tim Bits lived year, either kinda dry way sweet. could get 6 donuts $4-6 make ton sense get Tim Bits IMO.  TBH could probably make anyways, still ingredients online ordering app correct. Canada first-dose strategy Israel doses split 1st 2nd, Canada's almost entirely first dose, although changing quickly. also midsize SUVs cars made. family member tinnitus Moderna vaccine effect either us. heard possible issue read post. worth, covid appears cause hearing loss tinnitus people. think misunderstood. Right part quoted says recommended take *beforehand*, says take afterwards needed. this? I'm assuming count Isreal still ""Isreali citizens"" far ahead early vaccination effort. know Canada implemented policy deffering second doses (something exactly recommended science (maybe thats different now)) order get many first doses possible. why? Or, Israel's drastically slowed down? end July, everyone wants Vaccines doses. BioNtech came said required. Fine:

s/timmyhos/hawkinscheezies/ guess problem testing young contacts positive cases? 40,000 tests day, bet missing many younger contacts asymptomatic, virus continue circulate vaccinate herd immunity levels. Yes, people able read full 13 word headline, even weren't. Thats news Canada actually! shitty looks!


Thats get local news bbc. Everyone Canada 12+ wants vaccines two doses end July. brakes!! contradicted yourself. It‚Äôs ok take getting vaccine getting symptoms before. miss taco salad. cheap let pretend eating something healthy. A) irrelevant post. clearly states metric measuring article actual headline.

B) even true. [11.4% (as almost double percentage said) fully vaccinated. number rising almost 1% point per day. June 16th: ""New Toilet Paper Shortage linked Taco Bell vaccine incentive.""

Aw shit, go again.  contagious makes sense dominating variants, sick implied variants. shitty genetic luck humanity. always case. Evolutionarily speaking, actually advantageous new variants become less virulent time, spread easier way. common cold, instance, much weaker form coronavirus compared COVID SARS. don‚Äôt get people go there, there‚Äôs nothing sell place like 7-11 doesn‚Äôt sell better, never mind McDonalds, A&amp;W etc. Chinese vaccine seems less effective fried tortilla thing middle. likely dumped it. don‚Äôt want keep stuff stock one item. They've started rolling second doses older higher risk people, hopefully end summer reached 75%-80% fully vaccinated age people. I‚Äôd like see too. sucks. wish severe Covid anyone, many people getting delta variant, awful.  back old days, tims donuts made fresh in-store. glorious! fav honey crullers. freshly made. ones disgusting. donuts are. sweet, stale, taste same. get doughnuts local bakery, sooo good. idea who'd downvote this.

I'm Canada. got first dose last month I'm eligible get second September.

Which good, that's first week university need present feeling best. Dude don‚Äôt tell people.. apply people fully vaccinated area require it? I'd curious data. difference EUA full approval waiting period 6 months worth results. That‚Äôs is, tests, nothing, level safety meet. intents purposes it‚Äôs fully approved. sucks. Venmo/Paypal, help cover cost rent payments. Hate think people losing pets. take medications fever soreness receiving vaccine needed.**

Which u/anarchyreigns said took ibuprofen evening second shot

You supposed take dose **before** **during** appointment. ""Canada first place, second Malta.""

This hard-hitting journalism like see posted reddit. strategy giving people one shot instead fewer 2 intentional seems worked. Immunity single shot strong. course we're getting shot.

Have lived Legault Ford's fucking shitty flip-flopping mismanagement? Trudeau's do-nothingness?

I swear conspiracy make us fucking miserable possible we'd anything get out. ffs, made us go bed 9pm Quebec. death? criticalrecovered disabled Put FOXNEWS television change real quick. never rains know answer understand question taken bad faith ü§∑ people immune suppressed vaccinated could still get gravely ill virus. everyone got vaccine 100% woods, need reach herd immunity. pleasure. Beijing Tim Hortons advertised Canadian. amazing 36 still allowed get vaccine Germany. definitely get 2nd dose October, choose to. basic math point since know many vaccines we're getting, etc.

I honestly wish booking systems would stop booking 2nd appointments since kinda fake confuse people I'm breakthrough case. Got flight bunch midwestern bible thumpers believe covid ""cold"" got sick. Thankfully vaccine worked I'm recovering little symptoms minus still missing bit taste smell. Shit joke. vaccine probably kept hospital. I'll getting booster. point, sympathy asshats. get sick die, good riddance. good people around I'm worried about. still catch covid vaccinated, variants going come out. flight I'm pretty certain church group Trump hats refused wear masks eating peanuts hour spread it. dumb asses keeping us locked variants start breaking higher numbers. Let us hope vaccinated folks live takes lives dumb asses. I'm done dumbassery. Good 78.4% adults first dose, 55.9% second, accelerating second dose timeframe, mines brought forwards 3 weeks. people refuse widely available, life saving vaccination get take hospital bed inevitably get sick Covid?? don‚Äôt believe science... don‚Äôt come hospital. Go home take essential oils whatever crackpot shit believe see works them.  Keep living denial It‚Äôs gotta owned someone. someone‚Äôs don‚Äôt want kind multi unit housing built. Same! Eh try travel outside US. Great vaccinated this, rest world still struggling phase. That's fine pace vaccination ridiculously slow here. Australia lagging quite bit compared North America Europe. Genius. Leave vaccine clean put 5g microchips meatballs. No-one would think check meatballs! Thats incredible amount pessimism. Denmark announced 100% return normal Netherlands announced capacity restrictions outdoor events next month. Poland lots Eastern EU. Give 2-3 months EU 3 months behind US terms vaccinations. ...Australia done amazing job getting vaccines. much hate?? probably troll still got laugh it. I‚Äôm trypanophobic too, still made get vaxxed.  There‚Äôs anti vaxxers various reasons. Canada them, Japan movement since 90s, Europe varying degrees including Russia, yesterday reading certain parts India trouble believe local gods vaccines. US perhaps. ""You'll understand soon enough consequences chosen."" Honestly, fuck Australia. want get COVID vaccines. want go zero COVID thing, let lockdowns forever give COVID vaccines people need them. Australia offer world except vegemite shit? want see kangaroo, go zoo. want go beach get attacked sharks, I'll go California I‚Äôm pretty sure also says test God Bible. Vaccinated people encouraged dine frequently possible. service industry badly hurt last year. Unless want favorite restaurants close, need dining out.

(Truth told, *inside* restaurant last 15 months, think point safe go in--I prefer patios). 50% population fully vaccinated....

Uhh even close, like 10%.  I'm making comment laws all, know mean that, think missed point lot. I'm talking cultural. people may given grandparents Covid. grandma got COVID she‚Äôs 98 amazingly completely fine day I‚Äôd given she‚Äôd gotten really sick can‚Äôt imagine thoughts would gone head. 

I sure would extremely mad somewhat understand someone else might able deal pretend wasn‚Äôt really fault. Especially media reading said wasn‚Äôt big deal circle friends family said same. 

My non blood related cousins grandma got Covid afterwards lost large amount mental capacity. died fairly shortly after, per se went big spiral seems like could blame Covid even longer infected. cousins didn‚Äôt give still mostly opinion Covid overblown even died. wear masks it‚Äôs weird see people looking situation different points view.  fall Taco Tuesday bit! learn nothing Emmett???  understand need articles like this, lot news lately males think ""yeah, shit."" yet another.

Hopefully stories shade misinformation change minds current eligible, unvaccimated people. would hate see someone can't get vaccinated become sick someone get vaccinated chooses to. looks much like ""when bioreactor making adenovirus dose 2 gives lemons instead vaccine, make lemonade"" situation.  

Moderna trialling 50 ug dose guess would Moderna Lite. Right, taking pretty conservative approach. 550k confirmed positive tests. least twice many carried it. death count 11k. say include homeless ""sanctuary"" residents? Wonder society functioned without cell phones.

...and btw, still dial 911 without working SIM.

Nice try  Homeless get J&amp;J SF since needs one shot. lol, so? last federal budget looks like federal government thinking mid 2022.

Plans build quarantine camps (in addition / instead quarantine hotels) sounds like expect level travel restrictions place long time. according pew way every issue community racism. due bad community beliefs spread via community's religion, via means. churches community spreading stupid belief racism point there's problem. sort need include already died covid too...the original herd thinned extent  everywhere America vaccinates levels.  comparison Sweden vs. Norway Finland stark. See, part problem. That's amazing! question upset much. already answered.


The person replying to.... insisting trolling.

I explaining question.....


But thank providing source. Reporting obvious, thanks NBC. Yeah, least 25% population natural antibodies...and climbing. Sure, obesity causes long-term problems. Avoiding covid literally avoiding disease could suffocate death. think people would scared. Exactly; know need shots CoronaVac plus 14-28 days truly effective, little emphasis put statistics show number population vaccinated one shot, enough...  
Lifting restrictions soon talking ""reuniting families along Chile"" help either; I've battling family this, 3 nephews can't get shots yet (19, 12 11) sure hell intend reunite unknowingly pass virus... especially bad situation immune-suppressed/compromised people children. 

Delta coming US burn under-protected communities. Every positive covid I‚Äôve seen ER past 3-4 weeks unvaccinated returning trip Florida. Every. One. fair person responded ..That point made point made. 

All stated herd immunity technically come combination vaccinated people people got sick recovered. 

Which true...even though yes, everyone can, opinion, step snek!

Liburdee deth! Imagine offer people chance win money convince take life saving vaccine deadly virus causing global pandemic. must noted Metropolitan Region (where capital Santiago located) 55% target population vaccinated two doses (70% one dose), need shots CoronaVac work, really surprise whole city goes back lockdown... arguing way, anecdote: live building masks still required common areas lobbies elevators. can‚Äôt tell many times - even week - forgot remove mask got outside. dog, I‚Äôm least 4-5 times per day plus whatever errands, etc. require venture outdoors.  really hilarious assume someone reasonable statement points hyperbolic views part problem, aka, get vaccinated. probably person gives dirty looks someone grocery store wearing mask also shirt bald eagle American flag it. world black white think is. should‚Äôve mentioned Bioreference Laboratories seems like real company Lol got again. Never stop papi strongly disagree. matter bad facts ground get, people find ways pretend they're happening. We've multiple reports COVID deniers refusing admit wrong *while dying COVID*. Dear leader North Korea, ex-Dear Leader wannabe Mar-a-lago. far people willing go avoid proper mask wearing beyond me? Wearing mask least prevent death right now, show respect lost battle. telling completely oblivious unnecessary death happened far, would rather complain freedom comfort? selfishness main reason western countries got run virus asian countries done well mostly, simply respect elderly vulnerable ranked high ladder personal qualities. 

nontheless 10 years ridiculously much, maybe infected person died permanent damage, dont like precedence set punishing people lost year hell... offered two years probation turned down. keep one pocket. I‚Äôd say half businesses still signs up, do, wear it. I‚Äôm fight anyone it. smile see door without masks required sign. Got 2nd Moderna yesterday feel like absolute crap today. fun. That's question though. Yes, awful, punished it, excuse prosecution using tactics often harm innocent people. bad enough never offered significantly less time, wasn't, serve extra time going trial.

Punishing people taking plea deal justice, hinders it. Prosecutors judge jury executioner. justice system stops working prosecutors get threaten innocent people taking plea deals claiming they'll face much longer sentence death don't. [There cases state killed man, likely innocent, refusing plea prosecution forced prove defendant guilty beyond reasonable doubt evidence, coerce threats extra time. ALWAYS wear masks gloves working. 

I‚Äôm mostly wondering patients front office staff. doesn‚Äôt bother wear mask patients/ don‚Äôt patient. coding course take? God, saying HIV normally expected problem great. course normally expected problem, one like ""hmm got HIV/AIDS, time start meds, biggie"" still Big Fucking Deal, necessarily fatal anymore. thing say, jfc. bidet sprayer used clean kids cloth diapers....I happy that. Made WAY less worried supplying TP. called priors Well working mouth since 80s 90s definitely already do/ to, issue question . 


I‚Äôm wondering waiting room patients. need wear mask vaccinated still? first - sure maybe...but grocery stores flat flour sugar quite quickly well. 

Couldn't find yeast long time.... kind massage. mean, that's cool, I'll take one anyway six months available. :) want magnetism wear off. 8 many? even watch video?

Gottlieb gave clear explanation unlikely.

Additionally, unvaccinated population US drop bucket compared unvaccinated population rest world, people won‚Äôt even able get shot year. truly concerned variants, would make sense ship vaccines India rather wasting time (and expiring doses) dealing anti-vax people US. I'm arguing consequences. People make mistakes. People end paying fines mistakes. Elected leaders always seem manage skip second step. Living area 3 years taught nearly everyone considerate, unless driving! LOL right, probably  I'm sorry go that. Thank trying keep customers workers safe extremely difficult circumstances.

Take extra-good care yourself. traumatic year everyone, especially folks like you. Me, I'm exhausted. No, I'm continuing wear mask make comfortable. covid fully vaccinated, threat you. Also, forget worthy praise beginning covid treat us like crap now. made sure food table alcohol needed get nightmare. Spitting genitals? supposed readying   Hey guys know go like ""florida man"" someone florida, well maybe point add ""merica man"" headlines  think universal sign I'm shit human mask nose sticking out. Spent month half wondering around Greece 2014 hands one best places I've ever been. workshop working? mind asking, workshop? feel like I'm old switch, part love job small amounts VBA ""coding"" build tools / designing excel formulas parse data. I'm free 12 hour days frustrated way management handled everything. already pretty diligent hand washing, always got flu shot, etc. 

But think I‚Äôll hang masks. would like see practice wearing one public suspect might early cold symptoms become normal thing, think might help us minimize cold flu season. 

Otherwise, I‚Äôm ready get back normal. missed able hug friends, device get car drive beach weekend, go eat, little stuff. I‚Äôm ready freedom back. fully vaccinated - hope compulsory?  Roll Tide. That's lot people quit companies struggling hire workers. ""over it"" mindset lot people want come back stressful environment. far major events (Indy 500, boxing, baseball games‚Ä¶even Super bowl) huge issues J&amp;J failing deliver expected supplies meant Ireland revise goal 82% adults partially vaccinated end June 75%. delay couple weeks, hyped lot. Maybe oversimplification, vaccinated people variants date major concern, unvaccinated much greater concern.

They thought nothing wrong they're criminally insane, anyone defends actions Good. Trade Covid explosive diarrhea. YEah, makes sense. would need that, since Chinese people trust domestic vaccines given vaccine poisoning scandal years back. long term health issues caught within first couple months ? 
Again, vaccines work everyone get vaccinated need sugarcoat false information. Long term side effects absolutely unknown point. oh ok Yeah spying ads sufficiently monetized. Im saying like it, making point :)  another lesson offered 2 years probation ended 10 years. prisons many innocent people. easier innocent person take shorter sentence risk trial go wrong matter innocent are. far large disparity. didnt cops tell slam dunk evidence cave even didnt it. CJ system bullshit. denied right trial jury. sentence given judge, could even less ten years. lawyer would told maximum years could faced, likelihood winning trial, negotiated light sentence plea deal. guy, likely pride, take plea deal facing 10 years prison. system works, quite honestly given good deal decided take it. threatened disproportionate sentence; want take plea deal. said every time see someone bring democratic leaders prove hypocrisy always trying use ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù measures place taken away leaders humans weren‚Äôt perfect examples time. It‚Äôs always arguing bad faith. agree last sentence many virologists to, original covid variant quite forgiving right border ""ok serious enough need something it"" ""luckily doesnt much damage learne deal it"". Yes even original variant dangerous, take account unhealthy lifestyle many people is, basically kept alive blood pressure, cholesterol blood thinning meds, together insulin hundreds millions diabetics, wonder covid impact even early 2020.

But year half, virus evolved quite drastically, virus history even pesimists expected. delta variant basically brand new virus, twice infectious (super quick spreading, replaced british kent variant like 2-3 months Britain), virulent (more serious disease causing trouble younger healthier people) main symptoms changed lot, affect smell taste anymore, much cough original wuhan variant, instead disguises serious common cold breathlessness severe cases (headache, fatigue, sore throat fever common symptoms). Thank god vaccines available way virus adapts environment crazy, would never ending wave wave wave hospital dealing nothing else covid patients... Unfortunately afraid ease virus adapts may mean cause many problems deaths next winter, way many people refusing vaccines ( right countries looks like 60-65% people accept vaccine, wouod probably enough original virus, delta variant need 80-90%, probably closer 90% vaccines lose effectivenes new variants).

 hate pesimist positive progress made protecting people, dont finish meds treating serious cases year, afraid way many people still suffer. cant forget poorer countries absolutely decimated latest variants. Awesome, many thanks! think already cases detected, besides variant UK Flu evolves plenty own. think widespread(-ish) vaccination affected rate change. surprise, grown man picking physical fights people parking lots masks parents minimize wrong actions blame victim son's repercussions actions. I‚Äôm ready near full normalcy. permanent change I‚Äôll wear mask hospital settings (if don‚Äôt enforce future already). imagine defense lawyer types clients exceedingly frustrating. Two year probation versus potential 10 years prison sounds like massive win lawyer, client sounds like ignorant, dumb brick handle idea asked pull mask wrong. exactly covid spread much USA Target requiring employees provide proof vaccination. Yes vaccines caused long term health issues, however, issues almost exclusively caught first couple months receiving vaccine. Since giving vaccine trial participants ***year*** public 6 months outside extremely rare blood clots recent heart inflammation, major concerns identified watch dog groups global health safety organizations. long data need exist make people ""more confident"" passed 99.9% likelihood ""window"" severe reactions side effects? point excuse....

 Adults 18+ recently added children 12+ underlying health conditions. Hope low vax states get appreciation former leaders vaccine. Judging guts see around, think right. Yea cured anxiety caused due thought everlooming death. Never mind, stand corrected Chile vaccinated 60.3%. Israel #1 world long time first doses, Canada's replaced Israel #1 spot. thinking might getting brigaded moscow.  Yes, I‚Äôm biologists, listening podcasts mRNA therapies.

I WANT FUCKIN TACOS! I'm sorry. know many like you. live area highly vaccinated still part carrying winter peak.


I hope get back normal. environment forced created changes many restrictions lifted create environment get back way were.

Not exactly. rate vaccination seems pretty much constant past two months. stalled particularly, slow.

I'm Finland, watching alarm. Finland relatively strict restrictions travel abroad months now, there's lot pressure open internal EU borders travellers. Looks like Russian border stay mostly shut time. mild tinnitus vaccine affected status all. providing anecdotal experience data. Moderna helps, almost 4 weeks ago first shot. would guess wildly effective delta variant maybe gamma variant. Even Pfiezer vaccine, gold standard, 88% effective (which actually quite good), vaccines like 50% - 60% effective. Still way better vaccinated, good enough stop spread. spreads, dangerous variants keep emerging. I'm worried delta variant, ability escape current vaccines. way things going UK, could 15,000 cases day mid-June. Savage headline that's informative. article much news either, bit 125k people hospitalized January per week 15k relevant info. Zionks. source that? I‚Äôd like share friends/family. really much proud whole state Pathologic Demand Avoidance. Tell something, say hell no. Tell something, immediately want go it. 

An elderly man Alabama put way.""if told Alabama eat paint old houses, whole state would lead poisoning end week"" want move badly Well restrictions gone US, even little surge Fall Winter highly doubt country locks things worst case scenario probably indoor masks throughout winter. maybe little different Europe feel countries Europe pretty close removing restrictions well.  Yes course. would Israel vaccinate Canada's population?

[Ba-dum tsssss!] fully vaccinated individuals (well 2+ weeks since second dose) transmit disease individuals, including fully vaccinated individuals?

Your chances transmitting virus vaccinated Pfizer/Moderna reduced 94%. doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs right ;)  recommended CDC currently. i‚Äôm changing subject, im still subject restrictions lifted fast early. mentality Boston  say?.jpg Yeah sucks sometimes even gotten way care whole lawsuits religious healthcare orgs say providing care trans patients. open wikipedia ;) vaccine 100%....they could one 5% didn‚Äôt respond. news sky still blue.   second dose briefly cause hear ringing sound, went away within day. variation first doses roller coaster. hate go like yesterday today nearly doubles yesterday‚Äôs numbers.

BC 7 weeks right HIV would one. reason vaccine mutates much believe. Likely reason ones vaccines for. fair OP, first time history we've reacted pandemic large-scale shutdowns public health restrictions nearly 18 months. understandable many us worry never find way this. get real answer here. allowed post political content sub, issue completely political. entire pandemic politicized extreme degree certain actors US. that‚Äôs good point wanting face role someone‚Äôs mostly proventable death  agree, 19% people 12+ Alberta fully vaccinated. Eligibility vaccinated May open end month, vast majority fully vaccinated end July. Things started slow definitely making lost time. Ewww Absolutely. feel sorry could cavalier loss elder. mind blowing. 

It took us months, mere months, come one, several highly effective vaccines novel virus work using different technologies. used take decades come one moderately effective vaccine.

We cusp rapidly developing vaccines whole host infectious diseases: HIV, RSV, Hep C, Herpes, Chikungunya, Malaria, TB, long-lasting flu vaccine, even cancers. works based mRNA technology, great shot succeeding.

This may usher greatest single advance human life expectancy since antibiotics, bunch people going opt due fear needles ignorance. Seriously? I‚Äôm moving California tonight!
/s very, stupid question

Indeed anxiety around needles &amp; believe fast &amp; painless one (1st shot 4 June) was. Felt little woozy 20 minutes waiting post-shot felt well enough walk around hour's exercise upon walking pharmacy. next morning though glad bought ice pack. Even then, I've way worse pain reasons past. far 2nd &amp; 3rd day shot easier deal pain/soreness episodes years. Can't wait till 25th comes &amp; get 2nd Pfizer. I'll feel much less fear COVID that. You‚Äôre putting words mouth, accusing fear-mongering misinformation simply referring indisputable fact vaccines work better others, raising possibility Sinovac may strong enough efficacy prevent serious outbreaks.

It‚Äôs binary vaccines ‚Äòwork‚Äô ‚Äòdon‚Äôt work‚Äô, it‚Äôs spectrum efficacy. imagining things fighting straw man think said implied Sinovac ‚Äòdoesn‚Äôt work‚Äô nothing. Chile different culture, seasons, institutions, vaccines meaningful different. doesn‚Äôt one other, true time. 

I also said ‚Äòa limit‚Äô power hospitals prevent deaths, irrelevant. oxygen PPE world prevent hundreds thousands severe COVID patients dying, happened rich western countries good hospitals. indication Chile currently significantly impacted problems.

I‚Äôm tired trying reading lines putting words mouth. clearly aren‚Äôt interesting responding actually say, prefer change subject scope issue suits you. American's always considered everything old soviet union 'Eastern Europe'.

Oh, add, American's also considered Soviet satellites basically Soviet Union. Germany show (or recent test proof you‚Äôve COVID last 6 months) allowed eat restaurants take part cultural activities. Also, Friday announced Proof vaccination corona warning App. likely going show vaccination status QR codes next half year so. hope part mask-wearing sticks. guess crimson tide dynasty right now?  right third world countries? r/indiaspeaks

Yeah That's mathematical model. reality highly irregular shape loosely approximates oblate spheroid 80%!! I'd noted above, UK tripled case rate 3 weeks, that's 78% adults first dose, 56% adults 2 jabs. People attitude worse anti-vaxxers. You‚Äôre essentially wishing death harm others. Congrats.

At least (the majority of) anti-vaxxers don‚Äôt mindset pain suffering goal.

I agree vaccinating dumb. outright wishing harm death someone else beyond that. Dude looks like schmuck me. Dad joke? x 2 mix many cases combined reluctance cooperate tracers. tried contact tracing New York infected people tried contact even talk them.  one thing hospital clinging life country people speak language relatives relatively nearby.

It's whole different ballgame foreign country, speak language, medical history, contact home difficult, etc. there, done that. summary production plans vaccines,

Any link - I'm curious stuff despite scientific evidence stop

... Huh? top. donated COVAX - guys, donate! getting doses free, think it‚Äôs important pay forward!  Lego Movie  Opinions UK moving full reopening June July? health care quality.

South Africa decent private hospitals people take bus tours Namibia likely afford. Rural Namibia, much. lucky get sustained oxygen. Hmm   go eat indoors kids. eat outdoors home. Yes, disease deadly kids, still highly contagious still want get sick.

It's big sacrifice eat outside eat restaurant me. Wait, medical professionals COVID shot?  Long covid symptoms like learn walk again, able get staircase comfortable thought, even survive it. Don‚Äôt forget talk covid dick (erectile disfunction). many videos people long covid young invalids. According Netwerk24 party left South Africa 10 May every tourist present letter certifying tested negative.

So happened here? letters obviously false cases. anal swabs want...  anyone makes sick, people peddle vaccine disinformation. trust anyone who'll tell actual story vaccines (i.e. they're safe, prevent COVID, could save life, etc.), might easy anti-vaxxer get you- think source's fault, receiver. Flu also ""just flu"" RIP Taco Bell - 2 days D-Day. much due 'catching FL' via mass transportation methods used get back.

Air travel still risky, people blame cases ""Florida"". that? Bureaucracy? Technology transfer? want tested specifically Han Chinese; thought away requirement. read article? didn‚Äôt cough someone. coughed spit someone ‚Äúattacking eyes genitals‚Äù. victim claims nearly lost eye assault. According article type assault class c felony 10 years apparently line class c felony. People mind business comes masks what's hard? I'm FL native 41 years. ever remember chilly Halloween, ever. I've lived state, never cold trick-or-treating experience. Maybe North Florida? Anywhere south Orlando gonna mild October, though. 10 years mostly assault part. Still think way much.  ""Don't travel via mass transportation"" unless vaccinated. FL come cesspool, fact people take risks get packed airplanes. benefit well educated population.

These people seat power, protecting result kids, follow doing. Yeah. Still. 10 years that. Come on. Wtf. I've seen people get less murder. Tbh, ‚Äúcanadian mafioso‚Äù doesn‚Äôt sound like someone really need lock up. People hoarding Tp, many couldn‚Äôt buy result anywhere ‚Ä¶. like, need baby wipes! never stock. Gentler anus too!! yeah kind worries me, experts saying possible next one evolve dodge vaccines, expense transmissability lethality

so net benefit Right, getting ridiculous people. totally agree, outrageous privileged ass-fucks think need follow rules can't even understand.

But 10 fucking years this? 

Hello? Humanity, gone? live tourist central....Orlando. people know actually live vaccinated, available everywhere, literally almost every street corner grocery drug store available same-day appointments.

It's people (Florida man) causing issue, fact everyone mother wants come elsewhere, whether got vaccinated not.

There's probably way ever prove this, huge suspicion lot people ""came FL"" it, get here, rather got plane, airport, family member traveled with. cases really low here, folks actually live here. Tennessee one hottest housing markets country massive exploding growth pretty much every city Nashville Johnson City. millions people living there. Well okay, fucking 10 years this??? big fine, maybe 6 months something, TEN YEARS ? missed starting gun :( website still sucks though . . . many links love good massage True, people online read headlines believe them. That's anti maskers thing. title says go jail pull shit, yell scream online,but comply IRL.  Dude turned two year probation plea deal get trial jury instead. could avoided this. saying 10 years necessarily appropriate crime, pride got way nobody blame himself. covid neither jab bad. little soreness injection site minor body aches ~24 hours. Same! Fully vaccinated month now! least? US rarely puts resources towards rehabilitating felons. underfunded halfway houses releases prisoners large people get let lack mental, financial, social etc resources need succeed. know, personal responsibility important spending prison budget general rehab also smart investment benefits everyone, prisoners.  may much direct danger many people refusing vaccine vaccination protecting individuals receiving vaccine, also reducing spread virus order protect immunocompromised people (whose immune system respond vaccination heightened risk) reducing opportunities virus mutate hazardous. Fucking paywall. I‚Äôm pulling straight ass possible Floridians drop earlier higher rate bringing remaining children‚Äôs average bunch states bunch dumber kids least tried graduate. makes sense internet sourced understanding Florida. state level? malfunctioning immune system worried much COVID, it‚Äôs virus people vaccinated against. ppl bad judging risks. Look many car accidents &amp; deaths pandemic even ppl working home. especially true younger adults 35. Keep mind took literally generation mandatory seatbelt statutes introduced vast majority Americans buckle own. psychology behind risk/reward complicated reason there's whole PhD departments devoted game behavior/decision making analyses.  don‚Äôt disagree last paragraph, first two. don‚Äôt like complaints ‚Äúcancelling people‚Äù that‚Äôs first two paragraphs sound like. Black Mirror episodes I‚Äôd like introduce to. Better yet watch (almost universally excellent) skip first one little intense IMO. Electric Dreams also good episodes vein I‚Äôm getting topic :) here, it‚Äôs always one crisis another free money always welcomed lol Idk happen soon seeing currently investigating myocarditis seems occur much often young people compared even often blood clots occur young people AZ/JJ. good/happy see. state-wide cases cratering, nova daily new cases seemed low last summer even lower now, 21.4 daily new cases population ~2.5+ million

add today's amazing weather, really premium, excellent treat. Well really ads they, they're bugs (in intelligence gathering sense) used to, went broke, money free money always appreciated think it‚Äôs matter pride people. Like personally I‚Äôd also take free money, handouts aren‚Äôt anything ashamed of, people may view failing able provide family, know? sort understand mindset open Ontario yet. ;) Lots people want travel, many places open yet. Especially many places island Caribbean.

Theres ton people Hawaii too, looks practically full ever Oahu despite none Japanese tourists normally lot.  much freedumb Vaccinated not, news missing critical information?  Yes. really removed vaccinated travelers though, yet. Worked grocery retail whole time. one companies generally considered least shitty work for. Honestly company kind best, behaved much integrity could reasonably expect big corporation. hazard pay beginning thing last month decided enough people opportunity get vaccinated, that's still better deal grocery workers got. Fuck Jeff Bezos. 

Anyway, severely burnt out. job ass. never ass, got kind ass last year half due circumstances. reopening means job less ass now. I'm put restrictions getting lifted, since I'm vaccinated now. I'm happy wear mask I'm happy we'll able coffee little sample cups again. I'm happy got whole thing least worst without losing single employee. 

I'm burnt customers. fucking hate 90% them, even acknowledge unfair lot is. think whole pandemic enflamed pretty deeply held sense tribalism I'd already picked years working restaurants retail. ""Us vs. Them"" ""them"" legitimate threats ""us"" sense. know, instead obnoxious pushy condescending rude, plus also wearing masks wrong prove point, comfort important safety. Trying negligently murder elderly immunocompromised coworkers. that's way felt. gonna take time deprogram that, guess? Rationally know threat over, still absolute white-hot rage reaction seeing strangers nose. nose represented while. I've always little claustrophobic crowds get boxed customers want cyclone-punch way freedom safety, hard switch off. think it'll take time. 

I also hate new hires, also acknowledge unfair is. know fault missed worst it. begrudge jobs anything. hard explain, ever seen Band Brothers kind like episode towards end new recruits come in, full energy ready action, old soldiers who've whole campaign like ""...ugh, talk look me."" I'm profoundly tired way aren't, again, exactly fair went pandemic whether working store not. They've earned exhaustion too, think tribalism again. 

All probably sounds little dramatic. Maybe is. tend lean towards dramatic things, one bigger things happened life. especially start thing, really lot uncertainty, pre-vaccination credible sense danger. think burnout coming fact vacation whole time, customers still suck, I'm really danger anymore since vaccine really chance slow really internalize danger passed. still lot programmed reactions things harmless enough profoundly disrespectful dangerous worst things. pretty soon society gonna start gaslighting thinking ever danger all, people gonna start rolling eyes much imply took trauma whole experience. may even rolling eyes right now! Thanks reading. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs public defender, they‚Äôre probably used it. it‚Äôs private attorney, probably expecting happy taking fees get offended free money don‚Äôt deserve free money

Fuck it, I‚Äôll take free money Stockers employees? guess tell manager.  touch comment ever read Reddit. I'm saying jail time. face consequences did.

But

I've worked prison, contractor. can't imagine living 10 days, let alone 10 years. They're intended dehumanize. 

I think ""lock em throw away key"" bad society. Prison rehabilitate. creates even screwed people. I'm saying abolish prison, I'm saying remember criminals people too, members community, need creating worse problems.

We disagree sentence. opinion. fine disagree, make better you, jerk, bad person. know anything also know anything man. Maybe one bad day, maybe he's total psycho. think either could true. think punishment warranted, err towards leniency picture clear.

I doubt many people agree me. opinion minority USA, probably entire world. vote want, care. see lesson guy learn unacceptable behavior 10 years learn 1. Prison prison hell never ok sending people without obvious reasons amount time. Sorry, sorry. Americans tip like back home countries though. leads people expecting tips common. depends visiting course. tips might common normally expected *20%* tip. I've dropped three people grocery department. One retired, one left take care sick mother one disabled Covid. They're gonna probably lose well cause I've evicted looking new place live. Precautionary principle. Let‚Äôs follow it. get mistakes every months. Let‚Äôs let case counts dropping (and Rt 1 sustainably) dictate reopening. Let‚Äôs reopen people sick restrictions (because do, even restrictions later on) think Florida‚Äôs tourists disrupted virus killed 600,000 people. Funny see people commodity like car parts. 
Every state depends tourists issue.

Edit: mean read article instead asking says? open it? seem understand consequences intent.

I can‚Äôt get shyly suggesting 10 years much rapist. sure point. We‚Äôre coming pandemic potentially deadly disease. forcibly exposed someone. Also likely sentence included exposure assault, though that‚Äôs fairly new crime falling loosely physical assault sentencing wide range (including probation treating non crime). That's pretty much Japan think

At least tourist heavy areas countries one denying tip, know of. Maybe outside touristy areas might get funny looks confirmation though. Got vaccinated yesterday j&amp;j one feel like I'm dying. Chills headache. Fuck  Exactly. proof via great study says (warning: still pre-print) 

But essentially says require hospitalization rates 91.9% Unvaccinated, 7% Partially vaccinated 1.1% fully vaccinated.

Source : added link thats right, people may value research economists mom gotten first dose pfizer. scheduled second dose 42 days. protected gets second dose? 

Also, worldwide vaccine rollout right now. 100% vaccine, still trial, therefore possible could've gotten placebo shot? 7 million doses Novavax health Canada hasn‚Äôt approved rest AZ J&amp;J bought Covax. doesn‚Äôt affect Canadians agree data ""so far"" supports anything like conclusion ""there's trade-off better health outcomes better economic outcomes"". Especially Greece hard hit economically. Even economy good service workers won‚Äôt turn unexpected cash handout economy isn‚Äôt good extra cash looks especially appealing. I'd even say (at least north) tipping rounding bill common paying cash, rounding nearby number paying card.

Nobody wants run around coins, deliveries vast majority tips came people ordering like 16‚Ç¨ worth food giving two 10‚Ç¨ bills telling keep rest. rest paying card ordered 16‚Ç¨ worth shit they'd round 20‚Ç¨.

Tipping really uncommon ime, mandatory. Nestle's US HQ Mars's HQ here, too? ""So far""

thats jumping conclusions whatsoever lol spent 2 weeks island hopping 2019 pandemic loved Santorini best vacation life. That‚Äôs problem mass layoffs. people gone them, especially ambitious better workers, find new better jobs want come back. I‚Äôve never understood joke. I‚Äôve literally never stomach problems Taco Bell - weak ass stomach.

Do people get diarrhea Taco Bell eat fiber something? fiber beans maybe much someone eats mostly burgers fries? (I‚Äôm making fun, genuinely confused joke came be) title article simply ridiculous, even Guardian's first time writing bullshit (and always tourism)

American tourists even 5% total, give idea come UK three times more

That also American (and Canadian) tourists certainly good, certainly better them, newspaper always treats saviors really absurd... customers, also management corporate way things. There's nothing you, basically working make strangers rich. Goddess Death. killing Coronavirus would appropriate, No? Yahoo News spoke economist Jerry Nickelsburg, director UCLA Anderson Forecast

And quote far, data says NPIs [nonpharmaceutical interventions], there's trade-off better health outcomes better economic outcomes.

Sounds like much jumping conclusions. weather history Greece amazing. culture tax avoidance - much. Around 15% common colds (20% source) caused human coronaviruses. They're pretty distant relation coronavirus; analysis said recent common ancestor century ago.

There pretty good chance vaccines covid pretty well hCoVs. think hard evidence. main issue hCoVs retain immunity long, seem case SARS-like cov's. used think zombie apocalypse would never happen everyone would know come together pandemic disproved too. We'd busy arguing eachother turning political point zombies overrunning towns eating us alive.  applies customers Apple stores, workers still need wear one now. 

I think last holdout. Fredericksburg exploded since left like 2017. miss traffic anymore. left retail 2010 never looked back. I'm serious say I'd rather homeless go back environment. toxic pay low make money make ends meet, worth putting health well risk. Fantastic headline, hard believe right? wonder reporting testing changed recently  exceptions, sure, data isnt looking 5 6 states lol. looked 20 states, also looked scandinavian countries well historical data 40 states 1918 flu pandemic. correlation showed every time argument that's otherwise legally allowed paid $2/hr

It's dumb, also change that's people tip. mean spread countries servers already paid fair wage. According article group 20% common colds could phrase question conservatively ask ""does mean vaccine (or potential vaccine) 20% causes common cold?"" Canadian way! (The apple doesn‚Äôt fall far tree seems) story shining example never approached people masked like guy improperly wearing one. I'm happy vaccines available concern anti-mask/vax crowd anymore. freeing. Sounds like know firsthand son never grew I‚Äôve never understood ‚Äúsubsidizing wages‚Äù argument. It‚Äôs going come customers pocket one way other. made laugh, free silver I‚Äôm really surprised given 11% population fully vaccinated. surplus vaccines right now? Shouldn‚Äôt going finish vaccinated people one dose? Try polio. Mostly asymptomatic 99% survived. big deal.  contact state department health first party post covid last night awesome (everyone fully vaccinated). It‚Äôs good back. #winning Lockdowns effective fight coronavirus Maybe he‚Äôs getting paid word!!! thing half US low vaccination rates. get live there.
