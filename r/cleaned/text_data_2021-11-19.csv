Police said tweet rioters started fires threw fireworks rioting authorities closed city’s main railway station.

Local media say gangs soccer hooligans involved rioting.

The country seen record numbers infections recent days new partial lockdown came force week ago.

In January, rioting broke Rotterdam Dutch cities government announced curfew attempt rein soaring coronavirus infections.

Earlier Friday, government banned fireworks Dec. 31 second straight year. ban intended “to prevent, much possible, extra strain health care, law enforcement first responders,” government said Friday.

I never heard anybody refusing vaccination before. Army already chaptering non-compliant idiots, seen single exemption, medical religious, upheld.

Like, probably gotten around 10 vaccines since joining military, choose draw line vaccine #11? Yeah, stupid antihistamines dont help anything. think might rare intolerance. cant find anything anywhere. Friends mine almost burned house smell smoke coming kitchen. know pretty much same, that's fine. However legally distinct, stated FDA. I'm strictly speaking legalities here.

No buddy, DIDNT. said zero supply it.

Every single Pfizer vaccine world right Comirnaty. Please put facebook away. Half dose Moderna still “stronger” Pfizer.

Pfizer 30mcg mRNA half dose Moderna 50mcg mRNA. still get active ingredients Moderna jab. Basically: see stats like ""only 2 % COVID-19 infections happen outdoors""

In end mean something like: ""only 2 % trackable COVID-19 infection happen outdoors""


In normal years people spend ~10 % time outdoors. Also seems also easier track infections happen indoors infections happen outdoors.

So well COVID-19 statistically spreads outdoors indoors same. Anti-vaxxxers pretending care ""the children"" find new &amp; exciting fantastical way make themselves.   Allergy likely, try antihistamines, help little completely. Unless intolerance, help all. blood tests take make sure. Wow that's nuts, two towns even far apart! Might worth jump FLIXBUS go Berlin day! main FLIXBUS exchange point however called actually Messe-Nord, 10-minute walk ""Impfzentrum"" there.   Politics. Somehow masks became politicized, COVID vaccine followed suit. 

I still remember submit proof date vaccines registering elementary/middle/high school year, one batted eye complained. inconvenience since pharmacies near time anything flu shot parents make doctors appointment jabbed everything else required.  point gotta wonder even Oktoberfest Christmas Market next year. ever. Seems covid going keep flaring every autumn indefinitely. classified criminal negligence child obese certain areas, fully agree it’s line agorementioned philosophy also speaks vaccine mandates (which already exist, children get vaccinated several things, nothing new)  Sorry nearly downvoted pissed fact stated makes me. know? administer shot.

Pfizer vaccine = Comirnaty. literally spreading fake news anti-vaxxer bullshit.

Here's article Canada brand name switch. alergic garlic onions. big issue get used time cook - since ready-to-eat products contain one least leeks family. Thankfully allergy mild eat occasionally help antihistamines. think missing key word here. They'll put prison taking vaccine work well they'd hoped level risk yet quantified attached it. 

On top this, give children without permission child incapable informed consent. messed agree.

Taking away someones consent medical treatment also messed up. think booster par second got, minus shakes. mother retired lives Florida, doctor gave booster. asked criteria listed said doc said “well live Florida, you’re high risk anyway, we’ll give shot still”. also didn’t like shots give going waste, either waste go someone’s arm. 

I also worked restaurants FL, would say occupation high risk, checked box. wasn’t even asked pharmacist got shot verify, think want get rid shots short lifespan. asked say work favorite bar/restaurant, it’s like hand ID’s you. Also Walgreens much easier CVS schedule appt. person know got dangerously underweight losing taste due covid. Thankfully regained (and weight) months.  small sample? 15 Seriously, days away biggest traveling week whole year…  still check antibodies, even vaccinated - blood tests detect vaccines detect antibodies different protein spike. course much time might waned might got covid along way different time. Yeah I'm sure fire photo set police Ever since airborne got sued I’ve stayed far away holistics. yawn.. like xylometazoline? knew person completely addicted it. :/ Used times, gets relief congestion returns double power. sure sold large bottles counter - also used 3 days. I've heard story LSD candles working someone. Well prove wrong. I'll wait. Things different delta became dominant.

The fundamental science changed. virus EUA variant vaccine cannot legally ordered taken. Comirnaty variant one ordered taken. Comirnaty variant available anywhere produced. they're really defying orders since memo states properly labeled FDA approved vaccine (Comirnaty) ordered taken zero supply it.

What kind crazy facebook BS spreading? Comirnaty = Pfizer/BioNTech vax.  There's tons supply. took months Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, sold brand name Comirnaty... would argue overly simplistic. Far fewer people need compared vaccines, latter economy scale nope. Central asia almost possess little empathy care... Extraordinary times call extraordinary measures. beds solution. issue multi-factorial like solution needs be.

My point saying issue due x overly simplistic dishonest. percentage vaccinated. scapegoat politicians looking pass buck failings. particular nasal spray meant used 3 days time max. Safe use limited time yeah use bunch risk losing sense smell (not mention rebound congestion). Hightown? talking general, US. Austria don’t need imagine… Coronaviruses genetically similar COVID-19 found pangolins Africa, Africa continent eats lot bush meat. Pangolins largely contact humans there, endangered mammal earth due poaching. Although, states lot them, could past exposures? knows. Although, I'm sure pangolins carry animals well. 

However, bats Asian countries carry similar coronaviruses well, hit quite hard. Although, may come contact bats much humans exception wet markets. 

So hard say pervious exposures play in. suprising though. many viruses even US identified. 

I actually highly suspect genetics play large roll. newer study talking South Asians much suspectable due specific gene. simple article remember correctly finding genes related extreme inflammation covid.  Ashark l awsat (الشرق الأوسط) call literally translates ""the middle east"". position relative UK France rules us.

The middle east borderee egypt cyprus west, turkey north, iran east arabic island south (the land mass red sea arabic/persian golf.

Geographically, historically culturally afganistan middle east. Thoughts/prayers/whatever outside one could think that.

But politics last months really worst shitshow imaginable.

Our hospital capacities reaching limits really last ditch effort get many people vaccinated possible. late winter season anyway, though. Fully vaccinating yet takes many, many months. vaccind help that? seen article said among vaccinated people, loss smell frequently reported symptom. small portion american medias ban Europe. accessible.

Looks like great fire wall america needs improvement. Lol Massachusetts babe - he's trying avoid blinded sea whiteness around him, no, recent snowfall relevant comment.  That's $530 per course. Seems pretty high compered vaccine cost. makes sense  People catch virus 36 times less likely die covid compared vaccinated.

Um wat. kind cherry picking stat this? got source? you’re saying death rate unvaxxed 3% vaxxed, you’re mind. It’s like 20x direction. EUA variant vaccine cannot legally ordered taken. Comirnaty variant one ordered taken. Comirnaty variant available anywhere produced. they're really defying orders since memo states properly labeled FDA approved vaccine (Comirnaty) ordered taken zero supply it. perhaps even Moderna edge?

Its like mix n match seems produce higher antibody reaction, so, someone receiving basic moderna immunisation biontech might better. studies that: Also vaccinated people Germany inoculated two Comirnaty doses. evidence suggest better protection heterologous regime using Spikevax (or Janssen Vaxzevria) booster, Vaxzevria used anymore (due bad press legal reasons (not health reasons like contracts)) Janssen brings insecurity (on count one dose), Spikevax best possibility this. lot practitioners experience using though would suspect due environmental factors. African American people US face poverty compared many Americans. This, tend greater exposure COVID worse healthcare whites. 

They also higher rates obesity diabetes Africans. Plus, Africans would highly suspect exposed viruses due living conditions. Therefore, immune systems may edge gained US, speculation. People misinformed, ""moderna? never heard it? dont know it, dont want it"" Moderna rarity vaccination campaign. got though. recommend using 30+ though. Everyone 30 pregnant women get biontech. they’re reusing Tegel? live Hamburg far city put list like 100 practices boosters said fun. mobile impfteams “event” would go name venue spelt wrong official Hamburg website… Apparently people success showing hospitals websites specifically say they’re giving appointments ü70. No, Covid spread far wide Africa. Antibody tests show majority people infected countries. People less affected due demographics think Covid deaths noticed less due less developed health care systems. Except term ""assault weapon"" made bs sake legislature, usually doesnt matter anyways.

Your deadass talking two different parts globe lmao boostering half dose Moderna used. basic immunisation J&amp;J different country.

Whereas US CDC Number Shots: 1 CDC recommend mixing products initial 2-dose vaccine series additional doses. Mixing matching COVID-19 vaccines allowed booster shots. RKI recommends differently:
see Tab 1 page 11:

Basic immunisation J&amp;J means 100µg moderna shot (or biontech) following first J&amp;J dose within 4 weeks, receive 50µg booster 6 months 3 far, COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen approved single dose. far one press release manufacturer dated September 21, 2021 clinical effectiveness safety two-dose regimen (phase 3 ENSEMBLE 2 study). 4 optimized basic immunisation regime, far, published immunogenicity, safety efficacy data. recommendation based immunological
Plausibility analogy heterologous Vaxzevria / mRNA vaccination. boosters set 1-2 weeks administration, fine then. Sorry, misunderstood point. Hopefully people follow science rather wanting “German vaccine”. inclined believe person instead someone place invades don’t think timing surprise. There’s couple models seem work. Complete isolation/authoritarianism via quarantine contact tracing(NZ, China). Overwhelming vaxx + masks (Portugal). Germany much west boat. difference timing. Depends person shot

I got mine CVS, forgot card car, husband bring could fill shot arm even looking card. previous doses urgent care clinic computer there's way would known info. ask 6 months enter last shot date website, could easily lie there.

He also ask condition whether qualified (though I'm obviously 9 months pregnant...)

Oh get ""third dose"" rather booster matters Thanks clarifying. Makes sense give Moderna boosters everyone then! There’s enough BNT encourage people take Moderna shot. Can't wait see prolifers rescind stances accommodate this! 💉or vaccine vaccine?😂😂 Germany actually donated 59 million doses plans donating 41 million next six weeks, mostly Comirnaty. main problem Spikevax can't donated, additional contracts need closed manufacturers vaccines. exist BioNTech, Janssen Pharmaceutica Astra-Zeneca AB, Moderna agree now, giving doses away possible moment Studies show work well booster, perhaps even Moderna edge? enough BNT? never going end it? One wave another next 10 years least. Adding homeless vet population one virtue signaleer time. realize DD makes ineligible VA benefits include disability GI Bill. Good riddance. Hello again!

Yes, true. get vaccinated decided get tested antibodies instead see vaccine necessary.

I doctor. know got tested antibodies last time month ago TWICE much antibodies got tested second time. second time got tested lot antibodies first time.

There multiple explanations increase antibodies ultimately neither know sure. doctor said it’s ongoing immune response unnoticed reinfections could also cause. 

You position say antibodies decreasing point 100% certainty. would need get tested order verify falsify statement. 

What say 100% certainty is: 
My risk passing virus onto someone else lot lower since came touch virus immune system formed antibodies response. It’s guaranteed vaccinated people pass virus well. Ultimately mechanism play healthy recovered people general seem stronger longer lasting immune response healthy vaccinated people fact virologists agreeing upon. breakthrough infection likely occur getting covid-19 recovered person second time even though happen people well unfortunately.

In case cases many many people there’s necessity get vaccinated epidemiological standpoint antibodies protect reinfection also protect others lowering risk transmitting virus. 

You hand likelihood trapped vaccination spiral. Nobody tell sure long protective effect third vaccination going last multiple politicians already discussing fourth vaccination. There’s good chance you’ll get vaccinated every four six months. Good luck that. 

While you’re trapped vaccination spiral hand going jail I’m going walk freely. seems better option personally I’m fine it.

Have great day! info vax affects situation?

I'll continue staying home then. need go places anyways. need computer, internet, food, I'm set.  GOOD. told they’re unvaccinated? I'm fucking sorry. :( 

The US looks pretty fucked, we've run patience lockdowns. getting vaccinated ensures need forever lockdowns. middle sane, there's fringe madness.  enjoy inhaling farticles? leave room toot. got booster today. Here's hoping another booster needed while. would important set numbers relation respective base population. 70% population vaccinated, 30% aren’t, assume population 100K, hospitalization e.g. 44 people 70K 0.00062, 56 people 30K 0.00187. risk hospitalization roughly 3x times higher unvaccinated scenario.  least governor Florida offering $5000 bonus. course, covering moving costs could $5000? math joke. trying determine: businesses currently hiring people refuse vaccinated? simple R^2 may right measure. 

Of course straight line fit may work. may linear. may geometric diminishing marginal returns. 

You also (probably) something multivariate control age. Counties kids arguably higher rates regardless vaccination rates.

That’s bad way regress those. line represents best fit linear regression probably need rethink it. looks like geometric regression, even fit weird. There’s obviously correlation 1:1 ain’t. friends South Africa die Covid, think poverty fact africa reason hear it. know. Smallpox made completely extinct polio's like 4 countries thanks mandatory vaccination. 

My big concerns 1) making sure universal paid sick leave exists one gets side effects shot(s) risk enough money live month, 2) ensuring people genuinely cannot take shot(s) able get actual medical exemption instead fined excluded society fully vaxxed despite able to.  would try cancel change flight dates, preferably like March/April 2022 later.

1) Nothing's going open they're still locked down, probably COVID waves take longer 10-20 days subside.

2) Breakthrough infection could still happen full vaccination, including booster, long COVID still risk even infection fully vaccinated including booster. Sorry one week vaccine still dont protection. immune system takes time learn make antibodies first. takes two weeks get immunity, don’t count anything time. 2-shot minimum still ""at least 1"". minimum likely require 2 3, greater 1. Yeah- reporter reeked Inside Edition. Illinois big companys enforcing mandate, want vaccine covid test &amp; take every first day week , show Negative, Crazy year , knowing coming future people want lockdown forever want get vaccinated. speak middle get mad, mad   people PTO bad reactions boosters. 

Universal paid sick leave needs general-striked already thing. /r/confidentlyincorrect Ive watched couple youtube videos testing consensus seemed get bite two need stop suck fresh one else taste goes back normal. Would probably expensive time consuming method anything temporary stuff like chemo patients mentioned.    idea getting downvoted. seems like substance fundamentally disrupts cell metabolism. Please note people New York: Austria *not* Australia. Please stop trying save us! misogynist  Doctors may recommend quarantine week two delivery. Fully it!  Cases, yes. Deaths, no.  Interesting points. One thing - sure exactly much deadly one variant is. Delta certainly transmit-able bad thing population level healthcare systems quickly run people trying shield getting infected research exposure far booster effect? two shots earlier year, wife kids got October. tested negative three times couple weeks symptoms constantly exposed weeks. cousin's sense taste/smell took 6 months come back describes muffled confusing. things taste smell like used to, tastes swapped around.  Honestly even compromise US military. vaccine refused, especially deployment, they'd kicked out. absurd. rate?

The virus never going away. point accept risk continue develop treatments improved vaccines? way everyone's losing patience restrictions masks vaccines what's done pandemic current situation.

I'm really sorry mom's friend. 

Maybe get counseling vaccine anxiety, post-vaccine deaths incredibly rare thing.   I’m hopeful Pfizer’s new drug help prevent situation.

But unless make available counter, people benefit primarily already access safe, respectful health care: white, thin, middle-class, able-bodied, cisgender, educated people. I've never heard anything definitive say virus made lab stem there, can't rule lab theory. Unless something come missed? educated guesses combined misdirection. Even article state yet determined. There's also newer evidence support lab theory least something shady going lab.

Databases taken defective HVAC believe read tender put someone replace ventilation proof course, suspect.

&amp;#x200B;

Back article, scientist making claim... different truth. also acknowledges similar case first found November discredits fit well hypothesis. Given thought coronavirus first cold, lot talk coverups China found cold. agree seamarket could served superspreader. Probably depends definition protection. Maybe get well vaxed boosted, best possible place catch virus confer even better immunity No, that's genetics works. Genetic diversity mean share traits. mostly many small meaningless traits tiny bits different. 

You can't assume genetic diversity causes prevents virus genetic diversity really mean anything specific. 

That's like assuming people blue eyes would get COVID rate superficial genetic trait common. wrong 100% time, right enough time call science. 

It really matters genes diversified, total volume diversification important mattes specific virus reacts that, might give flying fuck genetically diverse are.

If virus uses basic trigger available mammals animals, genetic diversity likely matter virus using basic hook biology requires infect always organism can't survive genetically defective.

In general virus going care random genetic diversity viruses target genes, hence tons viruses infect certain people rather viruses infect people. Virus evolve use highly specific genetic hooks, that's good propagation strategy virus would usually die off. 

COVID infecting humans cats, rats kinds animals, genetics likely something people exposed Africa changes genetics across board, due diversification.

If minor changes DNA enough stop COVID see kind non-human animals.. remember things came animals, like evolved specific humans. even infect birds reptiles! going need amazing genetic diversify span diversity mammals, birds reptiles virus already covers. 

A likely scenario virus common Africa given increased resistance pay attention every little virus Africa would never notice that. Like.. get Africa common cold coronavirus maybe become lot immune COVID19 get Asian common cold coronavirus maybe lot common cold coronaviruses running around realize since test enough say OH WELL common cold.  people give less fuck.

Agreed. I'm US county (Ventura County, CA) one's really checking vaccine cards anything yet, yet rule mandates vaccines anyone able particular things. 

Neighboring us LA County, mandates full vaccination legit medical exemption card hang inside wineries, breweries, distilleries, bars, nightclubs City LA full vaccination legit medical exemption card's required pretty much anything inside, least theory-and places *are* consistently checking City LA.

Source: things Ventura County went dinner concert City LA earlier week  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯   Seems like would lot simpler make rule:

No vax? Fine. hospital get sick. Covid backbone now? Oh ... fucking obvious. obvious since [the first phase 1s months we'd probably want third doses everyone research it. instead saying that, messaging ""no evidence"" ""don't worry it"" ""lets argue waning instead"" people supposed experts know better. Get booster. Ideally moderna. Mask distance much can. okay- faith vaccines take vitamins. pregnant pandemic, first. Got vaccine 16 19 weeks back February cried big tears happiness. 5 glorious months thought made it- son born June 24th right shit picking again.

And, well, Zoloft helps. got mom.  garlic onions taste smell bad? Heard that's common one post-covid repeated smallpox epidemics thousands years took 300 years widespread vaccination campaigns finally eradicated!

You clearly know absolutely nothing subject. Yes, could make law says unvaccinated get healthcare. since everyone gets equal treatment law, vaccinated also get healthcare? can't make laws treat one class better another class. may say though vaccinated part, society still give healthcare. true- part, thing forgetting things people part. Namely, washing hands, wearing masks, avoiding large gatherings outbreaks. going say next can't get health care wearing mask time? expecting far orange mirrored. Must regional differences.  ""i assumed Mac cleared them"" lot picky eaters turned away particular textures even smell taste altered may still picky consume. know two non-picky eaters lost smell taste several months said textures became almost heightened it’s could notice food. 1 week protect yourself, 2 weeks protect 94-year-old mother mask advice changed Delta. beyond stupid blame virus undergoing seismic mutation advice changing response. &lt;1 week protect yourself, ~2 weeks protect others around you.

The benefit things tasted delightful. tried cheap gin roommate had, drank neat beautiful, creamy flavor. 

Not now, though, things like dead animals fish barely smell can't say really smell cat's litter box. delicate floral smells also smell askew, possible.

With measles IIRC 1/5000 chance meningitis (0,02 %), considered flarkng high everybody required vaccinate.  sick work, disabled. criteria need catch reality. Good article. Misleading, clickbait headline. opposite ""woke mob""? Also vaccines 100% effective, wearing masks also protect vaccinated yet still unprotected. know? boards every biomedical company world?   Texas neck woods there's someone running office part platform ""Medical Freedom"" unvaccinated women. Please don’t worry. posted women know get vaccinated pregnant, scare anyone. political games them. saying stuff taking positions oppose see #1 enemies (political opponents). think political enemies pro-vaccine, must take opposite position. also gladly blame Bidn Democrts even know due getting vaccinated following mitigation strategies reduce chance spreading.

Yeah American strategy care anti-vaxxers. saw too: ""My partner vaccinated we're still taking precautions protect kids."" kids vaccinated, pandemic ""over"" US. Hospitals brink collapse care send someone hospital several states away. People South ending far away Connecticut still one cared enough anything. someone dies COVID wait long hospital bed, sad bad. 

The plan give anti-vaxxers exactly want instead coddling like Germany. Al Hamdu Lillah :)

I Bangladesh Happy know &lt;3&lt;3  Glad see people still dedicating miserable backwards possible. Lovely burden people obligated care them.    Well past indicator, likely get much worse US. 2 days following Pfizer booster rougher first 2 varies much. people rough first 2nd dose nothing significant 3rd. get another booster 6 months, may try Moderna. yet okayed mixing got booster. go! 

BBC News - Investigation spike newborn baby deaths  long ago vaccinated one get?   better yet, responsible enough get vaccinated, stay hospital.

Hospitals forced treat people quack remedies. confident treat disease, yourself. Go local feed store get ivermectin get essential oils lady street sells MLM.

Oh, help governments, think preoccupied things. Add 30-40% anti backers mix st voila, massive waive coming. acquaintance turned lacrosse scholarship enter military already completing basic left vaccine lmao     Antivaxxers want medical ""freedum""  hospitalized die still mostly unvaccinated. Even worst pandemic vaccines, small percent population exposed time, 100% population. long remain around percent unvaccinated, similar spikes (in hospitalizations deaths) still happen. 

Plus ability vaccines ward infection declines months. countries now, got vaccinated first months available prone getting infected, especially AZ J&amp;J vaccines. mRNA ones stronger one everyone got. still better chance hospitalized dying though.

Coronavirus aside, peak cold flu season due dryer, colder air, people indoors (and poor ventilated places) less sunlight northern hemisphere countries. Yes, stinks us living areas mask mandate indoor activity.    course. telling let people die, people slightly uncomfortable two years worth death?   Ok try keep hospitals capacity.

No, use hospital capacities Covid, postpone necessary OPs kills people.  safe effective medication developed becomes widely available. literally becomes like normal cold, remove mask.  destroying jobs making leech-breeders obsolete! /s That's respectable. also afraid ruining another human's mental health? What's covid surge Eurooean countries, even (or especially) high percentage vaccinated people? make sense anymore. You’re right, don’t think it’s particularly distinct difference. Whether you’re forcing hospital docs administer it, forcing hospital allow outside quack come use resources quack procedure (which turn leaves hospital responsible aftermath), it’s still awful.  NOVEL virus, vaccines mandatory exactly article Wednesday, Ireland's deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told CNN unprotected people ""causing lot trouble"" -- Ireland ""wouldn't imposing restrictions imposing now"" everyone vaccinated.

The US south, almost restrictions, made delta local areas overloading health systems.  Thanks thoughtful answer, appreciated! going last long time changing variables interconnected nature world we’re in. least US, areas minimal, any, restrictions. Many places almost restrictions lowest vaccination rate. Things still weren’t good may seem. look IHME’s estimated Covid deaths pretty much country Africa, it’s significantly higher reported death tolls.  Yes, idea.  definitely tell you’re getting.

Today, perfectly fine. Considering god fictional character... guess know mind god. easy play games people's lives, 7 weeks left due date, article wanted come across lazy morning Reddit browsing. I'm vaccinated, still. I've trying go anxiety/covid deep end last weeks, wish would go away. Sure. remember media wants headline way salacious actual story. think people want certainty one way another. 

As someone years graduate level econometrics statistics: it’s fool’s errand. DFW hospitals among despicably deregulated employment centers America. Group One black list agency would illegal almost entire US.  slow spread let people die health system overburdened. guy confusing viral load breakthrough vaccine effectiveness. Pretty basic.

I’d rather wear mask go somewhere businesses closed/restricted hospitals flooded.

Better still didn’t things, that’s option masks often least-worst choice. moving goal posts 95% piss right off.

They've [over 80% since early slowly creeping up. ""oops sudden overshoot spike"" start barely cases late summer high vaccination rate like that.

Let's call 6. suppress we'd need effective protection p _infection_ R0*(1-p) &lt; 1. that's p 0.83. clear vaccines effective _infection_ even _all_ get vaccinated. 95% get vaccinated, I'm sure possible without vaccinating young children, need efficacy least 0.83/0.95=0.88 88%.

The numbers work get herd immunity delta vaccines alone.

As per article. ""...one lowest...""

That sounds bit misleading. Bavaria's vaccination rate 1.9 %-points lower national average. Polycythaemia. Basically excess red blood cells makes blood thick cause blood clots things. Technically treatment called venesection, bloodletting. basically extract half litre blood bag putting needle arm attached bag via tube, put bag floor gravity rest. throw away bag blood. kind analysis involves using means medians. look correlation graphs, wilp see countries (and counties) many different sizes, MANY different results.

Your individual country could represent outlier, mean study valid. countries (and counties) fall DIRECTLY correlation line graphs. wear mask required state Federal Law. Currently terms go means wear one public transportation. wear one work sometimes it’s area it’s required, adds maybe thirty minutes hour day total, days work. Beyond that, wear mask anymore legally required. wonder “pandemic” “epidemic” nouns “endemic” not. Weird. important relieving. week learned calls poison control center ivermectin exposure risen 5-fold past year— likely related people trying something veterinary formulations sold over-the-counter…

But striking average number ivermectin prescriptions changed drastically— [3,600 per week per-pandemic high 88,000 one week August 

This random Ear, Nose, Throat doctor article (who doesn’t really basis treating patients Covid) *not* one writing rxs drug, I’m shocked prescribers able get away FDA advising doctors prescribe it. Yes, many medicines great off-label uses, documented studied shown effective. Ivermectin not, even close. think prescribing behavior negligent.   Whether vaccines stop virus, stop consequences pandemic.

If everyone vaccinated, waves cases won’t mean flooded hospitals anymore.

That’s needs stop us get normal life back. virus longer flood hospitals, manage rest. Yep. Long covid happening even vaccinated people breakthrough cases.   don’t know assisted living facilities relatives’ location gave boosters late September early October.  We're lucky point history vaccine efficacy produced less year start global pandemic. also lucky live countries wealth mass vaccinations. Yet, people whine complain vaccine efficacy, get multiple shots, etc.

What matter need shot every six months years order survive curtail pandemic? spoiled think somehow rationalize virus...  probably inflammation body reacting something. body probably went little crazy fighting infection wires may crossed speak. IBS possibly Fibromyalgi; temp pop 99.5 I'm flares. I'll also get chills, achy, crazy fatigued bad enough. imagine somewhat similar response body kinda spazs reason. think Pfizer one data people got booster original trial. didn’t think Moderna. That’s 80% population overall.  “It’s fueling anti-vaccine crowd,” Murphy said. “You don’t know you’re supposed take vaccine take it, works not. kind messaging helping.”

Ugh. wish would stop bullshit. anti vaccine crowd isn’t changing minds based anything FDA CDC says. made minds already. believe news confirms already misinformed decision. I'm signed booster week 🤞 Thank you! think hear fourth shot least another year.  agree one preserve one’s health super important. Never suggested otherwise.

“Where stop?” valid question, think it’s difficult draw circle around covid policy say global pandemic massive economic consequences exceptional circumstance.

Let’s also lose sight fact policy means that, unvaccinated choice, covid treated disease terms cost. like someone unvaccinated choice burdened regard covid costs cancer/heart disease/etc. patient burdened regard costs diseases.  takes granted every booster half efficient booster before. don’t think it’s going linear don’t think boosters pose help author stated.

Sure probably modify boosters point alarmist article without anything really backing theory - one booster dose. Unless hospitals overwhelmed breakthrough cases minimal restrictions vaccinated people. mean maggots already populating wound upon requesting treatment? Gag!
Where come from? It’s side effect viral illnesses too. aunt lost sense smell taste 1960s bad cold. Another friend lost 1980s illness. wonder bad colds coronaviruses. include children, place vaccinated enough real herd immunity yet.

That doesn’t mean vaccines don’t work. means can’t pretend children somehow don’t count comes spreading virus.  bit concerned looks like immunity last bit longer. like moderna first shots. 

However crossing finger it. hear 4th shot…. gives reasoning behind belief, may acceptance people selfish stupid assholes, especially since he's German Germany one worst countries EU vaccination rates.

 Others articles give reasoning:

- people getting vaccinated

- vaccines wearing covid lasted way longer reason 1. Booster shots look effective.

- covid one serious mutation less covered current vaccine. unknown would enough keep things going since vaccine still partially effective. Delta focuses vaccine would trick, assuming people would take it. remember federal vaccine mandates? treat mind sharing anti-vaxxers win end. 

Too bad lack common sense understand total victory cause would death every human earth.  Seriously. went ahead mine assuming would this. really can’t blame people sick shitty/ back forth guidance. Seems like they’re always steps behind? I’d imagine definition fully vaccinated changed, something like you’ve recent dose within last 6 months account who’ve first two. article:
‘There far fewer admissions previous waves, ""it's mostly unvaccinated young people, elderly people,"" said.’

Yippi far fewer admissions. Vaccines seem great job. Go get haven’t yet. Buh-bye! According women infected Delta 4 times likely stillbirth women infected. sad also slightly reassuring.  still get smallpox vaccines!!  anti-maskers anti-vaxxers, definitely anti-pillers copium Awee. thinking spouses ""hunting"" accidents.

Lol Minoozolala said - want create new law - involving constitutional layers, proper assessment periode (if correct terms ""Verfassungsjuristen"" ""Begutachtungsfrist""). take till February finished. wear mask indicated CDC? That’s good, don’t find terribly inconvenient all. It’s something particularly enjoy, wearing mask easy, simple thing it’s big deal, totally worth help protect others bring pandemic closer ending.  literally half year sun low sky provide vitamin taking low levels vitamin dangerous all. worst it’s pointless, winter’s supply costs way less copay single GP visit. assume Spain receive donated. know many EU countries donating much receiving domestic use. 

Actually production Covid vaccines extremely high, much higher administered.  it’s closed system long term even delta would lose. 100% vaccinations, still breakthrough cases beginning. point miss hosts die. That’s pure statistical discussion theoretical discussion never close system 100 vaccination   one does. 99.5% vaccination rate, still spreading. saying you’re wrong source? I’ve trying find data So… evidence, then? 99.5% adult vaccination rate still spreading like crazy. Tell unvaccinated's spreading virus? get depressed seeing people's faces anymore  People need slow tiny bit :/ mean nothing okay got third booster 2 weeks ago, really interested see numbers months Hunter widow- wives whose husbands hunting time, it’s like aren’t married second one, science said wearing mask vaccinated safe. Problem is, science doesn’t account human behavior. Scientists tend think logically, field requires way thinking. people don’t always act logically. South Africa demographics rest continent got hammered   Portugal? 98% eligible population vaccinated. see cases vaccination high. 

The ones behind anti-vax fueling virus think conspiracy theory. 

I think proof COVID 19 lab link, strong reasons consider possibility, believe investigations point hampered conflict interest official investigators lack cooperation Chinese government. Yeah let's take tens thousands flu deaths add hundreds thousands covid deaths it. Expanding hospital capacity also one least cost efficient ways managing pandemic compared vaccine mandates participate public indoor activities.   Catching Covid-19 getting vaccines two things potentially effective viral warts (HPV, malign benign). decent article found, focuses catching Covid-19, mention possibility vaccines causing effect.

Is research possible correlation? I've seen anecdotal stories subreddits, proper scientific source would better.

It’s still another 230,000 vulnerable people. Say 20% get infected quickly (possible), could spike 40k cases. 

2-3% lot people. lot.

Also, per Reuters: “Portugal administered least 16,308,391 doses COVID vaccines far. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that’s enough vaccinated 79.4% country’s population.”

That’s nowhere near 95% population. Data seems show 3rd course vaccine effective Delta 2 course regimen earlier variants. also lasts much longer. it? curious too. I’m hoping body’s intense reaction means good amount antibodies. I’m unsure intense reaction get protection not.

Yes correct nobody said anything this. pandemic end herd immunity become something concern anymore.

This talking becoming endemic . Point advice: stop arguing holier thou crowd here, majority people would happy masks social distance rules forever it’s  seem care job says. original comment anecdote, yes no?  someone mom also nurse, tell thanks (esp. past couple years), rocks. love style, lol.  SARS-CoV1 never vaccine, argument moot— can’t control here. Also, SARS-CoV1 even severe illness. 

Tell words antibodies nucleocapsid proteins matter. 

The risk/benefit ratio WILDLY clear kids. Kids’ risks shots virtually 0. Kids’ risks COVID well zero. Chrissake, vaccinate kids less severe illnesses (varicella, rubella) nobody loses heads that. Good idea, also help getting vaccinated reducing transmission community, helps. There's difference prescription-only version dosed humans, OTC version sold farm supply stores intended livestock. Yeah, I'm done arguing people get vaccine wear mask. place requires mask I'll gladly wear vaccine, booster going get living life without constantly worried time. 

If catch covid without realizing spread antivaxxer get real sick, them, me. took precautions, listened experts, got vaccine. people listen largely living life selfishly without changing normal routines whole last year anyway, they're going change now. least get back living somewhat normally too. least know bunch people cut life stupid behavior pandemic   Look cute cheeks has. chubby. infected SARS-CoV1 (2003 SARS) found detectable antibodies upwards 7-10 years initial infection.

But also good reason natural immunity might better vaccination. I've heard first hand reports nurses antibody tests sometimes can't measure threshold antibodies 6 months infection. reports people testing positive covid 2 3 times. Also, reports cell immunity might important antibody immunity. also reports antibodies nucleocapsid proteins important don’t think mandatory shot could save millions lives decades worth it?

Yes people, particularly older people. risk/benefit ratio clear cut younger people. vaccines 80-90% effective.

I'm convinced effective original strain. I'm seeing conflicting data though. Even healthline article said could low 60%. think enough long term data conclusive, enough data scientists come agreement. study linked could taking account right booster treatment. would need data see 3rd 4th booster gives long term protection. could give protection 8 months so. suppose understand policy-makers think.

I think that's thing; scientists either, that's trying do. 

It's also tragic federal coordination; states better leaders and/or resources others, basically own. None authorities working together; seemed competing (and still do). internationally. ""It's surreal. understand can't options,"" Cheryl Cila said.

For peter's sake, covid, public threat rampant right there. sound like grocery picking. Gee it’s like could die able smell gas leak home anything like that

/s true 😂  No, I'd consider mandatory nicotine tab programmes smokers outright ban oppression. like restrictions abortion banning outright. Politics making people question science.  r/parosmia 😔  UK already vaccination rate that's high enough minimal restrictions exponential growth. Austria stuck terrible situation enough people chose get vacciantion. Get Boosted get dead. choice yours. Hm interesting... allium allergy? Actually also things recall now, example allium/leek, aubgerines (i think?). dont get allergy symptoms like swollen face hives anything. stomach/intestinal issues, feeling really tired fatigue, soar throat might happen. Kinda like fly symptoms. Eventually enough people get sick won’t matter either. Natural immunity thing. It’s hard mode.

Vaccines work work schedule, fact data shows vaccines 95% effective booster seem longer-lasting. It’s like it’s going 2 done. Policy makers said this. Scientists said everyone continue wearing masks always presented public long hard ""war"" unknown novel virus. Instead always presented ""normal around corner"" type false hope. Optimism absolutely needed REALISTIC facts political sound bites. Israel’s example

Much Europe that. live I'm boosting vulnerable people starting rest us now. 

But going help Israel much since (by now) [paltry vaccination rate improving slowly. see settling 67% vaccinated 3 4 doses. That's lot people getting sick restrictions forever. 

Germany gets lots criticism they're tied UK 66%. know Israel keep infection rates level vaccination. Climate? winter wave?

Anyway, good night here. entire point medical professional tell you, someone uneducated medical science, exactly do. get idea tell doctors them? Also, lets get rid prescription drug commercials tell everyone ask doctor prescribe them.. 10% illustrative, chosen make math easier follow. 

The actual reduction risk currently around six times average across ages, i.e. 70% 30:12 uv:v 

but elderly much higher, like fifteen times. ages end hospital elderly likely end ICU, hospitals tend lots ICU beds. hospital community people tend older skew ratios. 

There's lots factors play one persons anecdotal reporting odds peoples average. 


It's easily possible ICU ward 20 beds completely full unvaccinated OAPs. That's basic probability theory. takes 24 hours replace fluid, blood. donate blood every 72 days so, it'd probably around long replace red blood cells lost. Delta variant? haha, good one! wear mask time 100% agree you.

It's necessary evil... said, I'm still going continue wearing mask public transport. http://www.alliumallergy.com/ true. active choice since work healthcare realized watching news much bad mental health. agree sentiment, analogy. happened USA too. even could studying things Israeli data showed, healthcare network allowed easy observations rely external data used research. makes even worse. mean exactly simple - higher vaccination rates slow spread, breakthrough infections people get vaccinated less severe, therefore causing less strain hospital system, meaning need help get it. 

The pandemic end herd immunity become something concern anymore. worst part? We’ll still wear masks everywhere even everyone gets third dose. off-ramps masking point. social media groups keep forcing narrative spreading misinformation? Especially since social media nothing aforementioned groups reported them. Even then, 3 spaced year longer. first two shots COVID series course month. Big difference immune response. 

It may become annual booster, may not. 

Comparing SARS-CoV2 immunity colds bit misnomer: one, know severity illness tends change bodies react immunologically. People infected SARS-CoV1 (2003 SARS) found detectable antibodies upwards 7-10 years initial infection. 

The vaccines 80-90% effective. Look efficacy post-3rd shot. studies immunity found last upwards 10 months. 

You don’t think mandatory shot could save millions lives decades worth it? That’s bizarre. mandate sorts safety save fewer lives. obviously paying attention rest world, way also American. boosters help thing need really stop symptomatic infections Delta Booster.

Since understand process works know Delta booster needs go FDA trials tests tiny bit different something millions data points on. figures, intensive care unit admissions, stable decreasing slightly recent days. widely accepted ""vaccine wall"" driven serious illness death figures down.
Some scientists feel public frustration high incidence rates based misunderstanding vaccines supposed achieve. actually hospital admissions. ""Fully vaccinated people made 30% deaths last month, older 60 underlying medical woes, line studies showing vaccines offer less protection old ill."" craziest thing want use ivermectin get admitted hospital. Guess trust immune system. however trust vaccine. Also, study done ivermectin could lead fertility problems. one hand, use ivermectin. other...

Studies Israel show provides high protection symptomatic Covid-19. (Around 95% Delta variant) sure getting numbers from. 
Only 60-years older 90% higher, ages 40-to 49, example, 80% 18-39 60 70%.

Virologists used say aim Delta (conservatively) 90% age-groups 60 85% ages 18-59; others said 95% age groups might necessary. knew Delta spreading much faster children previous Corona-variants. 20 50% may covid infection rates, versus hospitalization. could alot break infections, home &amp; mild.

You don’t get influenza vaccines annually it’s multi-dose, it’s influenza dozens strains wax wane prevalence.

Well I'm going say require basic certain vaccines travel another country attend public school work firefighter certain capacities like military. legally require certain vaccines scenes working law enforcement well especially considering lot people time really interact winteract municipal employees outside like maybe going Post Office maybe dealing something like complaint school board would perhaps dealing local police get pulled call 911 emergency situation. Cops often 1st point contact usually come contact lot people throughout shift. order prevent police officers becoming equivalent Corona virus typhoid Mary Type situation yes requiring police officers vaccinated covid 19. protection protection community they're supposed serve part of. Considering police officers members communities trust weapons upholding laws we've passed society. important people get vaccinated particularly they're field interact people lot everyday. Especially things like law enforcement emergency medicine. think lot places also requiring firefighters get vaccine well. year Sweden also winter wave 6 weeks later rest europe, would careful making predictions data. Sweden introduced mandatory covid passes first time anticipation new winter wave 

I wish people would stop comparing different regions climates. hit around world every location kinds weather kinds population land sizes time. variables matter.

Winter coming many countries seeing increase areas gets colder people start crowding indoors yes predict happening countries.

For example Canada I've seen goes Germany parts Europe US Canada. look data slowly ramping way. Going shitty winter unfortunately. treating unvaccinated people option here. considered unethical. US starting nationwide surge. 

It's fucking exhausting point. Get universal paid sick leave right remote accessibility:  think got covid? confused, got sick 4 days thought common cold. i'm confused, point feel lot sinus pressure behind eyes, nose ears. also completely lost sense taste smell. tested two days ago urgent care think results showing detected covid

it's weird got 2 doses moderna vaccine back came out. i'm confused happened. really think got covid, i'm gonna call lab tomorrow confirm going Umm 400k day nothing compared population.

And mom… god awesome… said, “So get pulled speeding Pike say wanted go speed limit saw damn sign damn don’t want told do..”

He laughed ass said good point. lady obviously doesn’t people like mom life seen first hand ICU running capacity looks like feels like tell someone got car accident need take life flight Mercy Springfield don’t beds. I'm incredibly sorry. :( girlfriend got back vaccine better people catching COVID becoming disabled dead unvaxxed people carrying around. People allowing free breeding grounds COVID hurting *everyone*, fully-vaxxed people, including fully-vaxxed vulnerable people, still catch COVID unvaccinated people. unfortunately, COVID often-disabling disease, even fully-vaccinated people

Exact things caused vaccine mandates smallpox polio. guess what, diseases eradicated West thanks respective vaccine mandates. Seeing Moore's law claims doubling every 2 years, would substantially better right mixed word angry tired... Like tirgry

Cool... like Badong, mixing bad wrong. they're restricting vaccinated people again. No, isn’t likely go lockdown. health care system strain now, isn’t covid. 

If you’re coming another country, changed rules bit 26th November don’t EU corona pass similar.  do? Negative. Deployed Stan part ME. Central Asia. said cancer treatment happen Berlin, physically go either Tegel Messe-Nord, number ""Arkaden"" (shopping centers) without appointment, actually TELL online worked me! BOOSTER GANG REPRESENT Oh idk , maybe forcing fully vaccinated people back lockdown neglecting need expand healthcare capacity almost 2 years pandemic ? No, really isn't.

It messed many people can't get medical treatment need (e.g. cancer back operations) bunch idiots want follow facebook gods.

It messed everyone needlessly suffering financially freedom politicians want anger potential voters, even though evidence clear minor dangers vaccine compared protections provides.

It messed people still believe Corona real, numbers worldwide fake, doctors lie facebook postings truth, cuddle selfish assholes keep hurting everyone. I'm guessing America. illegal employer ask employees health status EU, think. I'm Ireland, private company enforce mandatory vaccination. Even people working hospitals prove vaccinated. newer article staying many south Asians genetics make much susceptible severe covid. 

I highly suspect find regions much lower death scale. Genetics massive factor. true modern era. well aware given. Take me, I've 30 vaccinations. Smallpox, yellow fever, anthrax, typhoid. Even basic training gave printout. checked three, indeed accessible.  


But small portion american medias ban Europe. accessible. American could second sentence.

*But* regardless level chosen, none mandates kind “get vaccine face punishment”. (if that’s is) what’s controversial. Even difference *in practice* almost none, historical examples full mandates far I’m aware. 

Forced quarantine less controversial. Requiring vaccine almost every activity society (*de facto* full mandates) less controversial.

Getting ~~5G~~ booster Monday! Hell I'm pro Vax think stupid. encourage vaccination, punish ones cannot simply want bother. Wow crazy. kind world living easily lie. Nobody verifies reason. area every person lying get booster one fewer doses trash. assumption cellular immunity would remain effective preventing infections since proven wrong real world data.

In hindsight, I'm sure sure field experts assume this. 
In fact, history vaccines, vaccines actually completely prevent infection rarer achievement.

The whole thing colossal messaging fuck-up media public officials. I'm sure started exactly now, fell awhile almost pretty concerned learned Pfizer shots reduced like 50% immunity (from infection). 
Then fortunately ran credited saner voices explained actually alone finding Israeli results insufficient justify boosters. review2 published 13 September team includes two high-ranking FDA scientists cites preprint3 study notes short-term protective effect documented Israel “would necessarily imply worthwhile long-term benefit”.

I'm afraid side skeptics article yet. 
Not know shit like do, even laymen I'm still sitting ask ""what's different?"" seem argument based immune system's function explaining booster result longer immunity infection. booster shot yields antibodies, antibodies also better preventing disease, channel quoted people involved study analyzing antibody levels, researchers concluded third shot could effective 9 – 10 months, even longer, researchers predicted.

When say ""more antibodies"" mean antibodies right original shots? antibodies booster? seems pretty important distinction.

Yeah, know could theoretically help prevent infections boosting forever now, seems odd me. I'm sure costs there.
Offer sure, narrative get booster real danger wrong. time follow nations like Portugal Denmark start ""living Covid"".
Unless unfortunate undeveloped country still trying get hold first shots though. reiterating sad frustrating misinformation around vaccines always sunglasses? Unlikely, secondary immune responses longer lasting primary ones. think 3 doses good several years, others predict we’ll need yearly booster (which could given flu vaccine) we’ll see outcomes time. future hasn‘t happened yet.  I'm staunch opponent antivaxxers think taking far. problem requiring vaccination working certain jobs, traveling entering crowded spaces. bit far overreaching I'm afraid fuel antivaxxers garner sympathy well leading anti-vaccination sentiment spilling vaccines Covid-19 vaccines. But, aware immunocompromised dose heavier booster dose. sure tell pharmacist really want booster. today fact. least 1 = 1 greater. 2,3,4,5, on. 

2 doses least one. correlation side effects anything. difference treatment highly effective hospitalization. Actually two different anti-viral treatments already approved.

Also - giving boosters vaccinating 5 years up. aren’t situation Germany rest Europe. One week booster effect. Secondary immune responses faster. depressing sure. Everybody ready except virus itself. side van says ""Mistery Machine"" seems bit derivative. anyone else's booster wreck them? got mine Tuesday thankfully fever fatigue gone now, still feel dazed it. remember 2nd shot bad.  care severe disease protection

Severe disease protection primary benefit vaccines. hear great measles polio shots protected going hospital got them. Rather, primary benefit vaccines communal protection called herd immunity due reduction spread. protection often requires booster shots. saying would need two boosters year maintain protection infection spread prematurely. Though initial vaccines allow us pretty much worry dying it, quite possible maybe even probable booster two could suppress COVID point even worry catching first place giving people lives. symptoms COVID vaccination? mild dry cough throat pain. sinofarm vaccine since 2-3 months Never mind antivax story (boohoo), baffles fact dad got shot duty thought ""that's great job me"" Hopefully America next. logic? whats next, facts? gigantic dump lol TLDR scientists FDA say boosters might necessary future would expect waiting science, rather instead indicated boosters would unnecessary.

Their motive seem based science whether boosters eventually useful needed, instead politics vaccine distribution public confidence vaccines. like Bavarian, little? succinct point stated 3 replies problem people actively discouraging boosters despite us knowing.

It's infrastructure problem, antivaxx problem. 16% positivity rate? That's wild  COVID: even begun peak.  situation vastly improved today.

Unfortunately still grand slam ""should"" be! dispute across age groups, getting booster greatly reduces odds getting sick, long COVID, community spread, etc.

Yet wording ""may"" ages 18-49 conditions, ""should"" others. Why?

I think that's wrong.

You infected covid treated lol Got mine California two weeks ago whim shopping CVS. Super easy. Two Pfizer, one Moderna, zero side effects dose. rushed extensive testing optimal dosing period, wanted get effective vaccine soon possible. Long term immunity yet important consideration. 

Like said, vaccines multiple doses months years apart. 3-4 weeks doses far less gives optimal immunity vaccines. It’s entirely possible larger gap second third doses remains effective long time without needing frequent boosters. it’s also possible need frequent boosters. neither obviously correct assumption here, scenarios plausible need wait see. Imagine convince people technical solutions problems, eg materials used building bridges, solve supply chain issues, complex solutions macro economic problems kinds stuff. People engineers, economists etc capability knowledge understand solve issues, surely understanding virologist deal pandemic. people fucking know vaccine works, mrna is, exponential growth lockdowns necessary ('muh 1% death rate').

I'm pregnant, fully vaccinated, terrified. Why? Pregnant women Covid-19 delivered babies almost twice likely stillbirth healthy women Covid, according new Centers Disease Control study released Friday examined 1.2 million deliveries U.S. March 2020 September 2021.

While stillbirths rare overall, representing fewer 1 percent births, 1.26 percent 21,653 women Covid experienced stillbirth, compared 0.64 percent women without Covid. Even adjustments made control differences groups, women Covid 1.9 times likely healthy women stillbirth.

The risk stillbirth even higher women Covid since Delta variant dominant: risk stillbirth women Covid 1.5 times high healthy women July, Delta became dominant, 4 times high July September. many 2.7 percent deliveries women Covid stillbirths period studied Delta dominant.

“There reports suggesting increased risk, stillbirths hard study, luckily uncommon,” said Dr. Denise Jamieson, chief gynecology obstetrics Emory Healthcare. “This strongest evidence increased risk, probably strongest data pointing risks specifically tied Delta.”

The take home message importance vaccination pregnant women, particularly point pandemic Delta circulating,” said.

The C.D.C. strongly encourages pregnant breastfeeding women women planning trying become pregnant vaccinated Covid, resistance strong, even though pregnancy C.D.C.’s list health conditions increase risk severe disease.

Studies shown pregnant patients symptomatic twice likely symptomatic patients require admission intensive care interventions like mechanical ventilation, may likely die. also likely experience preterm birth.

Another C.D.C. study issued Wednesday described cases 15 pregnant women Mississippi died Covid pregnancy shortly afterward, including six died Delta variant became dominant nine died July October, Delta dominant.

Of women died, nine Black women, three white women three Hispanic women. median age 30. Fourteen women underlying medical conditions, none vaccinated. Five deaths occurred vaccinations available.
The study concluded risk death pregnant woman Covid nine deaths per 1,000 infections, risk death Covid women reproductive age 2.5 deaths per 1,000 infections.

A third study C.D.C. researchers found pregnant women Covid faced 60 percent higher risk admitted intensive care, needing ventilator special equipment breathe, even dying period Delta dominant, compared pregnant women period variant dominant.


Still looking CDC studies referenced here. someone finds please post.  direction that? guess I’ll try get pregnant bet people won’t get vaccine take pill. Stupidity works like They're usually strict dates Way back joined Navy, 1972, one shots got Bubonic Plague. years got Lassen National Park signs around saying feed squirrels fleas plague.

Anyhow, agree u/V4MAC; give administrative discharge get vaccine. Quit fucking around easy them. active duty Navy 1987-1993 got bunch vaccines bootcamp, absolutely choice, made us feel quite ill to. understand new wave military vaccine choices.  talking people claimed vaccines anything nanomachines, satanic spawn, 5G, *pork* them... oh yes, agitate goal post movers, they'll move goal posts more! Yawn.  curevac people, bad year clinical trial delta variant took hold United States, pregnant individuals fetuses babies faced increased risks coronavirus infections, according two new reports released Friday Centers Disease Control Prevention.
One report found 15 pregnant patients died covid-related causes March 2020 early October, including nine died delta became prominent strain. one women died underlying health conditions, none fully vaccinated. second report found risk stillbirth increased fourfold women covid-19 delta surged.
The reports’ authors emphasize importance preventive measures including vaccination, CDC recommends pregnant people. 30 percent pregnant Americans vaccinated, rate far lower population whole. It'll weed far right nut jobs. Always plus book. Yup. still larger Pfizer's 30mcg dose.  Come on? expecting ? Really… it’s news haven’t burned city ground. Western society it’s used kind control measures. I’m triple vaccinated think need make people pay lot don’t want get it. 1 Million Americans may recover loss smell according new research most, 1.6 million might olfactory dysfunction. 

I see real discrepancy here...

You Google word, ""misinformation"". think get means. know vaccine status, no. wasn't. know read headline Scooby-Doo's voice. guess say Scooby-Doo'd crap. Anyone administering shots? Moderna, guys draw vaccine full-dose vial (so, two booster shots), special half-dose vial? Respect! Standing tyranny TL;DR: Company makes second version quite bad vaccine quite bad.  certain blogger site automoderator want mention excruciatingly long post it.

Last time checked joining armed forces optional  I’m 20 months post-COVID, smell/taste still hardly-there, maybe 20%. depressing. K bye.  Vaccines work.  well. 

The short dosing schedule working USA others.  6 month booster make things lot better maybe much longer term. 


Mandates restrictions stoping helathcare overwhelmed.  vaccines block hospitalization, icu death efficacy 90+% .  Cases go deaths hospitalization don’t the. good.  unvaccinated going infected point either die recover (long COVID still concern) wee price pay.

What recommended needed protect disease.

Still birth up, stays within control limits.

They're investigating cause, surprised there's connection infant deaths, massive increase cases UK end summer. Simple solution.. intentionally unvaccinated people require hospitalisation covid pay it. government subsides idiots   ""AC/DC study finds we've got biggest balls all"" vaccine used Netherlands also Pfizer's Comirnaty. one highest supply, people got one.

Why would fast-track approval vaccine *isn't* widely available? Pakistan definitely south east asia indian subcontinent. wife virus June 2020. still smell back 100%. smell really strong scents work girl pregnant refuses get vaccinated.

I terrified individual fully vaccinated. could even imagine pregnant time. 

I believe you, great! hope happy healthy baby safe delivery/recovery!  lost around week back April, made life hell since sealed apartment well. 

Can't imagine losing months even years. Food becomes dead. hope real. awesome precedent.

Now, legal books ivermectin BS laymen opinions trusted medical experts. I’ve never heard called vaccine refusers, accurate description  rich Austrians? adjust based income?

Hahahahahaha BS argument made Ireland lowest ICU capacity Western Europe probably. Yes disgrace. Yes, increased capacity though thats hard much space, beds equipment problem staffing them.

Yea, right. So, hesitancy, government bureaucracy.   Man. anybody stupid?

Interesting. insurance refuse cover injuries obtained drunk driving? something else stupid/illegal?

I think can, maybe I'm wrong that.

COVID-19 | Sinovac vaccine recipients currently make 84 percent serious breakthrough Covid-19 cases treated Hospital Sungai Buloh.

Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin disclosed today, highlighting waning immunities encouraging come forward booster jabs.

“Why shorter booster interval Sinovac (three months) vs Pfizer AstraZeneca (six months)?

“While Sinovac effective, evidence effectiveness wanes sooner.

“This Category 4 Category 5 weekly admission (numbers) Hospital Sungai Buloh.

“That want take whatever booster offer,” tweeted along chart showing vaccination data patients dedicated Covid-19 hospital.


Category 4 refers Covid-19 patients lung infections need oxygen support.
Category 5 refers Covid-19 patients multiple organ failure need ventilator support.

Covid-19 breakthrough cases refer catch disease despite vaccinated.

Based chart shared Khairy, Sinovac recipients made overwhelming majority serious breakthrough infections Hospital Sungai Buloh, rising 100 recent weeks. 

Pfizer vaccine recipients develop serious infections increased slightly 20 recent weeks serious infections involving AstraZeneca recipients remained mostly single digits.

Nationwide, almost 50 percent of fully vaccinated population received Sinovac. Pfizer recipients make 36.3 percent Astrazeneca recipients make 13.7 percent.
Single-dose Cansino recipients account 0.1 percent population.

Covid-19 cases are rising throughout Klang Valley, Health Ministry previously warned.
Booster rollout

As Covid-19 vaccine booster rollout, government presently offering Pfizer, Sinovac, AstraZeneca vaccines boosters. 

Boosters prioritised frontliners, people aged 40 above, people aged 18 comorbidities, workers residents long-term care facilities, pregnant women, require overseas travel.
Appointments handed MySejahtera without need registration.
However, eligible also sign a waiting list beginning next Monday (Nov 22) private healthcare facilities.

A list participating healthcare facilities available ProtectHealth Corporation’s website when registration opens. also contact facilities phone email.

ProtectHealth Health Ministry-owned entity liaises private sector’s involvement National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.

Khairy previously disclosed 40 percent booster appointments suffering no-shows, warning Covid-19 hospitalisations rise booster take-up rates pick up. there's something wrong you--My colds last three days, 2 20 years--eat fruit Stop resisting!  vaccination mandate going lot less damage treating unvaccinated catch COVID bug. Several million per day still nothing India. Even cases peaked 10 million per day would take half year everyone infected yet peak lasted 6 weeks Near tell still vote sensible state root problem delta replicates damn fast. individual needs high antibody levels reduce likelihood gain foothold upper respiratory tract, reduce amount time infectious for, lastly overall severity infection. 

Boosters necessary increase antibody numbers orders magnitude reduce community transmission hopefully keep R 1. 

Back alpha variant dominant need boosters would much, much lower. I've course known common symptom losing one's sense smell taste long identified. never struck major one, especially compared dangerous lung function problems. experiencing days horrendous breakthrough case I'm unfortunately going through, tell absolutely horrible. like can't smell taste well stuffy nose gone, like senses totally dead gone. Zero pleasure derived eating, almost nauseating. hear chewing munching swallowing, feedback whatsoever. Plus, little things take granted everyday life - fresh shampoo suds help awaken morning, smell fresh coffee brewing, smell autumn breeze coming window - gone without huge impact ""colour"" interacting world everyday life. I'm day four without, desperately hoping returns prospect gone forever, much bear right now. Well that’s risk accepted. Wish best happen country yourself, hope everything become normal soon.  There's something I've thinking comes motivating people get vaccinated places large proportions unvaccinated, give clear goal/benchmark fully normal life return (and end goal here, living indefinitely quasi state war). 

The issue lot European nations re-imposing restrictions restrictions seem never ending, like endlessly recurring nightmare. Excluding unvaccinated sections society I'm sure really productive bringing people together, divides population groups resent other, can't good. People really working towards common goal. 

What think could help government currenetly imposing sort restrictions says ""*when hit x% vaccinated* (and propose know % is) *then life goes back full normality""* (i.e masks, Covid passes, social distancing, tests, etc). 

This gives clear metric according things judged, motivates people go get jabbed clear end benefit (I know benefit improved health, message clearly sufficient far need try new things). gives everyone opportunity part another clear way. moment someone who's unvaccinated might think even get jabbed, nothing change - still wear masks, still prove vaccination status anywhere, bother. gives second tangible benefit, makes everyone pull together. also increases social pressure hold-outs vaccination. Meaning people would tell friends/family members unvaccinated 'hey show Covid pass everywhere/my small business can't many customers would like'. 

Right we're endless depressing sea restricitons, would show clear light end tunnel. 

Now counter-argument hit x% vaccinated population, infection rates still high. Well personally still arrive conclusion still open fully, we've done everything living restrictions indefinitely mentally economically unsustainable. I'm doubled Pfizer vaxxed currently getting covid. one dreadful experiences life. Smell wise, everthing smells fousty human waste. Taste wise lost 5 days solid. recovery dreadful, taste things really high certain area, e.g salt, spice sugar. Somethings taste ok like cherry tomatoes things like water melon make wanna throw up. Texture extremely hightened now, junk food much forgiving e.g. cakes, pies, wet biscuits etc. Mrs told clothes smelt fousty dried bad smell it, I'm worried I'll turn one smelly people really can't stand. 

Taste minor problem compared rest symptoms. pain body excruciating, mouth swollen, teeth hurt, I've painful headache lifetime (I'm migraine sufferer), joints sore. feel like chest fine 15 minutes exercise, something simple putting vacuum horrendous coughing fits constant vomitting gross. tastes mild burns like mofo. 

I took 15minute walk dog yesterday really needed fresh air exercise slept 3 hours back it.

For reference, 29 years old, I'm reasonably healthy although asthma. BMI 22, bit ""skinny fat"" 5ft 8 @ roughly 148lbs. walk dog daily, go phases running going gym means couch potato means athlete either. I'd comsider normal. 

I followed precautions Covid even UK opened back up. caught covid daughter cought school. What's worse I'm entitled financial help sickness. 

This absolute misery moment.  Sounds like bad gall bladder.  don’t suppose know name test you, could see Australia? vaccinated chances exposed covid extremely low state hasn’t case wild since July 2020 also 85% double vaccination rate here. Knowing I’d covid would really help mental state, silly sounds, didn’t, need see dr rule weird causes. shoving face donuts fizzy drinks also massive benefits you’re still allowed Idk available vaccines Austria. know AZ J&amp;J available DK. poster country blocked, know article blocked?

This important, even know issue. stupid political reasons place public health military

You answered whole question. That's reason.  follow ""good"" news yesterday, markets forbidden Bavaria.

joy unrelated issue caused pain almost food tasted remotely nice. lost lot weight desire eat, also depressing loss something take granted. I'm okay eat (hopefully stays way) time happy. recommend would never see good thing. points realise much better able choose diet instead, even hard. Nah, put prison refuse pay fine. covid shot way works quite similarly vaccines (as effective) tested thousands millions people, case Pfizer/Moderna without whiff level risk mumps shot. antivaxxers keeping society hostage ok? talk lot shit new therapeutics sure hell they'll begging death bed past window effectiveness like vaccine. data people read ""only 2 % COVID-19 infections happen outdoors"" concluded.

Genuinely interested response - charge Austria, hospitals literally full, ambulances waiting bays patients beds, longer attend callouts. Almost everybody taking space unvaccinated. You’ve tried every avenue convince people take vaccine willingly, rates still remain relatively low .. would do?  Sero survey's reported around two thirds Indians already inflected COVID. may reason low number cases now.  lost smell entirely (18 months) taste exactly like described. hate things randomly taste like sewage. I'm honestly concerned recurring pressure headaches brain fog leaves tears sometimes. think vaccinated also causing people die directly either. efficacy rate vaccine went back 2019 behaviour, even fully vaccinated population, virus still spread.

This means unless new vaccine developed totally stop spread, virus end reach everyone. people weak immune system, can't vaccinated, exposed virus long release restrictions, point.

Being vaccinated reduces risk die (which would say, choice best left person), reduces speed spread, reduces load hospitals. Reducing speed spread, however, also accomplished restrictive measures, whether unvaccinated people everyone. 

The main benefit vaccination individual preventing death. main benefit society reducing lockdowns. think unvaccinated therefore causing *other* people die, causing lockdowns.

Drosten said rapid tests probably sensitive enough detect positive people onset symptoms, even worse vaccinated. far studies topic rare. pundits health experts telling people pandemic February, insane look Europe right now.

We telling people get ready mask, social distance limit gatherings holidays. thing ever hear vaccines, restrictions come back everyone shocked horrified. tried 8 months. didn’t see improvement brothers took 15 months come back. hope gets better soon. Things happening children absolute worst hopes quickly dashed.  Got COVID April right around getting vaccine, real lousy timing. fever, aches, lethargy, brain fog, shortness breath days, certain vaccine side effects. all, isolation habits changed 13 months odds, right?

It week after, feeling mostly recovered, ate food realized smell. Tried spices cleaners: nothing. Went right urgent care rapid test yep, positive. Two weeks quarantining bad, already working home full time, could afford grocery deliveries.

Seven months later smell gotten better, definitely back normal. Random meats give ""sewage"" smell gets mentioned. like sticking head trash shoot, like walking past dumpster open area. unbearable, definitely odor I'd like stay around.

Garlic non existent. Went hot pot weeks ago (all fully vaccinated). added much minced garlic nothing.

Chemical sprays, like scented cleaners, smell dusty, like walked storage area seen light day 20 years. Rubbing alcohol kinda there, mostly not. Dove body wash smells sorta kinda ok, Pert Plus shampoo fairly muted.

It's one big thing, thousand tiny ones. far can't smell additive natural gas that's added alert people leak. smell smoke wood fires.

Long term hard think about, seems shifts reactions time. Trending better, I'm hopeful normalcy. that's combined difficulty remembering normal. Imagine see certain color while, certain red autumn leaves. one day realize seen seek out, find it. describe what's missing? convey general ideas, unless I'm holding thing, frustrating. Half sense gone, know half, days 60% (or 45%, 56.4%, etc).

As individual, I'll cope. I'm getting older body wears new ways anyway. everyone though, we're limping along. We've added significant disability that's likely present strange ways.

They certainly still getting many covid deaths day. Well think way, eating healthy miserable even really tough get hold of. reason used GP offices wasn‘t actually wasn‘t enough Spikevax, Moderna approve way distribution IIRC Israel's MOH data presented FDA outside advisory committee deliberations. arguing boosters attributing getting handle Delta outbreak due early booster campaign. Might contributing factor research vitamin preventative measure SARS-COV-2 far yielded mostly inconclusive disappointing results. First time early 2020 second months vaccinated. First time brutal, certain norovirus worse, though. Agreed, Walgreens scheduling system much better CVS. CVS play guessing game. Walgreens tells earliest appointment location close you. Sorry man can't get behind this.

And point. decided ended, still part kind collective effort beat pandemic simply longer exists USA (and many places barely never existed begin with). are. part collective effort handicapped start unwillingness part population participate, part growing larger day. part I'm simply done restricting life protect people take vaccine. three doses Moderna, I'm healthy relatively young, I'm done. Like said, necessarily ""right"" moral perspective, reality. That's absolutely fascinating. remember seeing stories past months people otherwise presymptomatic discovered covid realized tasting things. 

Glad made okay. That's taste 3 days covid. sweet, could taste bitter/sour barely. Taste went back normal days.. sense smell month, phantom smells month that. Smell mostly back normal now, maybe acute used be? weird different everyone. Well, that’s untrue. hasn’t new variant since delta. Great news!  one employee? People forget NOVEL virus. Nobody's trying lie you. simply know. many variables predict happen (Waning immunity, new variants, new sub variants variants, etc).

Next time politician tells anything bout COVID take grain salt. Death rate vaccinated people 50 nearly zero. People acting like we're still 2020. Yep, wasn’t relevant science of, needed not. was. say it’s God’s plan dumb shit. Like would know minds God. arrogant. 1-3% 7 billion people lot people.

Police said Friday three young Austrians Linz admitted planned ambush police officers planned protests, given dissatisfaction tighter restrictions. two teenagers 20-year-old said also intended set officers fire, DPA news agency reported. think vaccine ever said eliminate side effects prior covid infections.

Sorry man can't get behind this. wave hitting Europe US we're going winter 60% vaccinated waning immunity. 

We decide natural disasters end, nature does. say hate discourse sides US. one seems actual understanding hospitalisations. people ever go vaccinating children.  honestly feel like lied to.  Shocked, tell you. Shocked! last paragraphs I’m thinking genetics possibility. I’ve reading seems genetic link families get severe Covid die.  I’m scientist. step-dad geneticist occupation, can’t understand word says.  Yup, raw onions horrible. Eleven months counting. ends decide ends. I've resumed near-normalcy. Concerts, bars, restaurants, booking travel spring. place still wear mask work situations train, work supposedly ending masks spring (we shall see) kids chance get vaccinated. live state took Covid seriously. 

The honest answer (in USA) longer collective problem, vast number people never cared begin even vaster number people joined initial group idiots caring fully vaccinated longer care Covid. I'm making argument correct perspective, saying happened. people willing go backward, willing restrict lives protect willfully unvaccinated adults. is. Get booster, go live life, want be. 

Now individual problem, answer Covid decide is. think need spend time figuring depoliticize science. recovered sense smell taste acute infection, noticed cilantro tastes like soap before.

I wish post covid issue, also left SOB, insomnia heart palpitations take medications now. get option pay fine installments. want that, seize whatever valuables (like car) cover fine. cover fine, go jail. think primary reason, time outdoors, homes well usually ventilated open. Still, knows, everyone praising Nordic countries low numbers handling pandemic shit's hitting fan there, maybe really hit yet. think another factor probably less long range, international travel amongst general population. IMHO 100% vaccine equity. FDA members quitting boosters, divide scientific community vaccine equity. tried mask lot throwing around ""The data support boosters"", data while. anyone paying attention, probably noticed swift pivot discussions symptomatic infection, ability control spread, hospitalization alone soon started crusade boosters. sudden vaccines still effective one vulnerable needed boost. Thankfully CDC able somewhat expand eligibility best ability FDA debacle.

The messaging divide next level bullcrap. people can't make mind whether cases matter not, whether spread matters not, hospitalizations relevant metric? are, hypocritical request NPIs like masking, social distancing, etc. can't use courtroom compel hospital turn somehow force independently licensed professionals use medication unproven, off-label way? would ever thought? He’s refusing require masks allow monoclonal antibody treatment without doctor’s referral.   ""I live New York City - don’t want sense smell back! urine? think smell dead guy!""- Bill Hicks well completely different tuning immune systems, different housing ventilation arrangements, different schooling setups, different amounts time spent indors, essentially everything else vastly differs much Africa developed economies.

To say ""mystifying"" comparable saying officials mystified bars full happy hour Bourbon Street. That's interesting first time I've heard people getting long-lasting effects vaccine.  Really dumb quit vaccine could save Oh god, happening since june really sure caused covid february. guess I’m alone!

Point BMI weight indicator health factors, culture obsesses buys shitty ""Atkins Diet"" ""Whole 30"" nonsense prioritizes cutting random foods healthy.

Also fuck Xi ccp described claims conspiracy theories made extraordinary claims without evidence. You’ll need better aim convince anyone there’s conspiracy afoot regarding favorite vaccine. fully vaccinated means boosted nowadays developed nations failed build distribute decent air purifiers institutions, homes businesses, 18 months pandemic, extremely dumb. also government still banning cannabis official use bigoted racist policies early 20th century. So, yep.   country politicians listen scientists regarding Covid think politically get away taking preventive measures.

This led little late type reactionary policy making that's making pandemic worse.

Politicians even ignoring *own* scientific advisory board like advices. Netherlands, backwards shithole.

So scientists lie, politicians wilfully ignorant least.   We’re trending 30-35% cases 10% hospitalizations (and rising) vaccinated. really think need stop saying “pandemic the

Frustrating.  vaccine definitely helped. first time really bad cough fever lasted couple days completely wiped out. got rest full experience: gastro-intestinal issues, brain fog, conjunctivitis.

Apparently patient infected parasitic worms impair immune system’s ability fight viruses, yes ivermectin help eliminating worms.  key *eliminating worms*. you’re infected worms, probably need something whether COVID.

If you’re area parasitic worms problem, ivermectin might help. you’re developed region parasitic worms aren’t problem, like USA, ivermectin probably won’t help unless perhaps particularly high risk contracted worms.

If area reasonable risk parasitic worm infections, recommend discussing proper approaches regarding worms knowledgeable local medical professional. Different worms may require different treatment protocols.  one single way this, multiple solutions need used together work (like vaccination masks time surges come, one rule another).

I literally said someone day. text was:

*I mean, far looks like vaccination + mitigation way go best protection transmission. But, god forbid vaccinated people wear mask again! So, no. It’s vaccination that’s going get us division country anything fucking pandemic, we’re long haul. wouldn’t feel need vaccinate children people could come together like civil humans science says prevent transmission.*  spent hours phone insurance recently trying get probably vaccine. Insurance pay office setting, pharmacy. Set appointment online approved clinic grocery store, get website assigned appointment pharmacy location notice me. extra hour clinic/pharmacy people straightened end.  UK fine. Hospitals overwhelmed. Vaccine uptake excellent. let us get lives, everyone around seems happy enough to.

What's solution then? let people die strongest chief scientist recently stated virus airborne, addition spreading droplets, aerosol, much stop it.

So let's slow keep deaths absolute People stay home day here, can’t go without mask, mandated.

Fr last time : article article people vaccinated driving infection, even though correct . main argument says title, vaccines enough stop pandemic, failing understand. 

I going stop . Take care. there's even relevant doesn’t help healthcare systems shit show people experiencing symptoms likely try wait brush instead seeing doctor.

These CNS PNS disorders people seeing neurologist likely receiving steroid treatment attempt promote remyelination. 

Amongst them, 27 (37.5%) patients showed persistent dysosmia included study. Nine participants received oral corticosteroids performed olfactory training (OCS + OT), 18 performed olfactory training (OT) only. participants OCS + OT group significantly improved olfactory score minimal clinically important difference subjective improvement smell (p = 0.007). Three participants received oral corticosteroids reported minimal transient side Yes can. don’t eat like trash? It’s preventable. Get exercise. Take care body. 

And way. It’s preventable taking injections. actual weight health status still vastly affects prevention. 

This issue system. want start charging people medical bills vaccinated charge taking ounce care body come dying obesity.  indeed pretty impressive. think something else actually going told about.  think debt obligations 39% world's military spending would bigger problem, well massive inflation cripple economy, that's opinion. way country, others, handling it, probably years, ever, really. point even vaccinations get rid it. may well end mutating enough variants can't vaccinate everybody variants. like flu, except way deadly. breakthrough cases, likelihood severity small enough disease would collapsing everyone vaccinated.

You cant everyone vaccinated. That's pipe dream. That's experts beginning talking COVID becoming endemic. 20-50% population unvaccinated makes difference disease strong people much likely find vulnerable vaccinated people resulting breakthrough cases.

Yes even 20-50% vaccination rates better nothing delta far low stop pandemic.. need high percentages immunity work. everyone vaccinated, covid would over.

Again thats impossible. wait approval problem getting booster. watching Dope Sick, little confidence FDA CDC seemed bungle messaging early on. Sadly trust information Germany Israel government US. know that. say were? 

States mask mandates don’t vaccine passports use masks instead protect everyone.

I thought idea vaccine passports upset lot people didn’t support them, states use mask mandates instead.   simple dilemma part risk management.   100% vaccination going stop transmission Delta. [No  income tax doesn’t changed based much little healthcare consume.  incomes taxes tied services.  

So no. aren’t paying anything x year. 30s here. husband got boosters Wednesday! shitty, ""covid arm"", really think unpleasant days worth it. Even die, lasting complications. I'll interested hear boosters give longer immunity, keep deaths, lasting complications down.  FYI UK doesn’t 90%+ antibody presence population-wide. 

The problem lot people’s priors flawed. doesn’t turn “an endemic” becomes endemic. Endemicity ongoing state. 

I applaud discussion given you’re non-native, you’re making ton bad assumptions logical leaps.     True, Died covid side effect. hope never catch virus, I’m fully vaccinated 3 shots far everything good, hope someday new wave antivaxers realize gain getting vaccinated say new wave fucking vaccines don’t want important one political bullshit.   think lockdowns would work. virus seems made home several different species, including deer. animal reservoir like that, could lock year still reinfected immediately upon reopening. Yeah got mine 9/29 CVS, questions asked  I’ve spells fevers lasting weeks long-covid. Really weird I’m prone otherwise. sure? Spain dashboard number vaccines received used lists 95% used received last months. suspect reason opened boosters 60+ population.

I know Germany Spain, theory EU countries made agreements buy vaccines deliveries less proportional, right? got 5 months second Moderna shot. Probably 50-60% sense smell back 6 weeks post Covid. Things like meat taste off, garlic strong scents aren’t nearly strong pay fine guess go jail. Nobody force needle body.


I huge fan mandatory vaccination misinformation guess achieve high enough rate otherwise. agree It’s novel anymore populations like UK 90%+ [antibody accept stay might come cost lower life expectancy people need lives livelihoods back.  physician, I'm curious, supposed mean? heard Alpha Lipoic Acid help this. know someone horrible smell taste items back taking supplement. Doesn’t hurt try, it’s good vitamin anyways. Thank god got smell back (although things smell different). One thing seems permanently altered things taste weird. used love lemonade sprite, weirdest aftertaste that’s strong. Toothpaste also takes weird. read then. article clearly talking people refusing get vaccinated extending pandemic causing additional precautions necessary.

Yes, acknowledges vaccinated still get infected low rates usually much less severity, rates high enough pandemic survive.  UK 90%+ ADULT antibodies. 

That leaves 5-10% adults loooots kids serve ongoing reservoir. I've used patients patients get admitted ""wild"" maggots wounds....  Vacinated people filling hospitals. breakthrough cases, likelihood severity small enough disease would collapsing everyone vaccinated.

Having 20-50% population unvaccinated makes difference disease strong people much likely find vulnerable vaccinated people resulting breakthrough cases.

If everyone vaccinated, covid would over.   UK 90%+ antibody positivity. people vaccination caught virus natural immunity. It’s exactly result 90%+ population vaccinated. Alright, problem if, again, hospitals would refuse give service anti vaxxers. large portion antivaxers dislike ""western medicine practice"" anyway..  So, refusing give antivaxxers help space need hospitals, solved problem u talked about.  I'm physician ever left someone try force something agree feel best interest patients I'd approach booster isolation. Particularly got Pfizer last time, protection COVID infection dropped significantly since got vaxxed. There's free shot available anywhere bump back ~95% efficacy. might much risk hospitalization is, getting COVID still sucks could pass others. 

You commit getting every 6 months get time - far seen evidence immunity wanes way third shot, obviously open question.   Dr Daniel saint  disregarded paying mortgage necessary bills family get thumbs social media. Hopefully thumbs look good resume looking another career. 👍 Hear Hear. Germany unbelievable faith natural remedies also factor. mum tried buy paracetamol lady pharmacy insisted homeopathic remedies would better way unethical force people vaccine? I'm pretty sure petri dish study, suggests effect real; computational model explains mechanism. problem ivermectin bind spike, partially ACE2 it'll block entry function, need concentration high enough it'll happen circumstance.

So basically thing shoving gum lock. Yeah, going real hard pick wad gum there, also going stop correct key. COVID-19 clinical update #89, Dr. Griffin reviews upcoming meeting FDA emergency use authorization molnupiravir, 25% US cases children, reinfection associates presence antibodies, national surveillance acute flaccid myelitis US, monoclonal antibody treatment infection vaccinated, high-risk individuals.

Daniel done weekly updates year 9 months. kids got first dose yesterday. ill effects tears pharmacy quickly went away snacks toys purchased 15 minute wait vaccines. get second vaccines 12/10. mom likely cancer hysterectomy day thanksgiving confirm. I'd like kids able see Christmas. Yesterday earliest appointment able get. said arms hurt side effects otherwise.  high doses vaccine. larger dose give bigger immune response, much higher side effects. current doses well point diminishing returns. - Sent basement Protesting something understand, destroying property putting people danger plain old dumb. really weird side effect second dose incredibly tired days 10-13 it. third dose actually opposite effect. Inflammation second dose certainly could resolve third dose, made worse. 

You go Pfizer booster. Even kids dose (much smaller dosage) would great booster dose allowed. interferes COVID's 'handshake' ACE2 receptor.

The paper claiming computational model without empirical data. lockdown unvaccinated, rather force who've done everything continue lives uprooted. way European nations bending anti vaxxers honestly pathetic.  Huge shocker courts unable force doctor commit malpractice. I'm glad doctor stood ground, cause didn't, headline would ""doctor sued malpractice death sherriff, administered ivermectin treatment"" got mine easily CVS. I’m 30 wanted make sure boosted visiting older relatives Thanksgiving. assumed authorized - didn’t answer questions age/condition. Take care sign up. That's problem nutshell. guys wanna pay it. riot get it. Theoretically, politicians responsibility distill opinions experts actions communicate people, via words laws. needs chains trust link qualifying trustworthiness previous link.

It's reasonable every person judge qualifications experts, see bunch claimed ""experts"" supporting sides arguments.

We electing people trust find truth, instead we're electing people based bias.

That failure, however, mean going ""experts"" trustworthy, since media barraged long, chain trust people trusting whatever facts feel best them. Paywall. I'm glad outcome, slippery slope. want treated quack, go quack instead taking hospital bed. mention letting random doctors practice hospital opens hospital (or bigger network... subject hospital part larger system 23 hospitals) severe financial risks. 

Potential lawsuits already mentioned comments, another risk could lose ability reimbursed government Medicare/Medicaid patients, reimbursement several popular conditions based specific hospital quality metrics. quack gets way patients monitored conditions start getting hospital-acquired infections complications hospital's staff treat evidence-based manner, could put whole system jeopardy.  much agree sentiment, plenty cases coming vaxxed 6+ months ago. I'm sure want booster shot every 6 months rest life. 

Spoken someone who's 2* moderns

Not sure gonna go hyperinflation table countries keep printing like support anti-COVID measures I'd hardly call European style lockdowns ""mild restrictions"". least bit shocking people would oppose them. 87% 95%+

Measles spreads even 95%+ vaccination rates. There’s big difference 87% 95%. People can’t see smile really beautiful smile. restricted early access free vaccines poorer neighborhoods Los Angeles, people knew vaccinated white ""gentrifier"" homeowner friends minority neighborhoods. rolled across city got many doses arms conceivably possible. Even means running every day. Even rich people drive poor neighborhoods. would far effective long run saved lives.  do, however, *slow* spread, spread slows certain point, case numbers go instead up. There's huge difference active outbreak people infected there. 

People act like can't eliminate completely, may well try. **What happens really late getting shots? ""behind"" forever?**

So, obviously 1st, 2nd booster shot available. 3rd one addresses new variant believe. wait 6 months get booster. great schedule getting 1st 2nd vaccines become available.

 
However, mean people many months late immunization party? 

Will disadvantaged ""behind"" forever? I'm sure relevant booster going someone getting many months released. That’s fair point. implement things, becomes second nature. prevents huge list things death covid. 

The thing is, stop ? going come work arounds everything ? Gotta get back basics take care health primarily. go cross country skiing afternoon way sun set it’s completely fine. places lights along tracks, places headlamp trick. want it, lack daylight isn’t issue.  stop genomic surveillance time would say worried Risks walking outside include getting hit killed bus, mean likely happen.

My risk getting hit bus probably higher kept ambulance hours end.

It's called risk visualization, try sometime. European countries major waves right near figure 90%+ population vaccinated. headline stupid buried lede.

Portugal 87.7%. near 90%+.

They're situation Netherlands Austria (yet) [pretty steep increase wear mask rest life then. vast majority won’t. 

Wearing mask normal inconsequential. Requiring needs end. Wait long enough virus us. Even countries amongst highest vaccination rates world seeing huge surges talking another lockdown understand else want person do?  majority mean shit. 51% majority.  ""Court forces hospital give meth addict Desoxyn (prescription meth, yes that's real thing) treatment Covid-19"" would pretty awkward headline. ridiculous. point wearing mask natural wearing pants. make activities less enjoyable. 65% Austria's population fully vaccinated. 73% Netherlands.

Yeah went recently WDL kids came back nothing huge credit card bill. hundreds reasons masks big deal many people. normal cannot live freely you’re required cover face. 

Masks hell deaf hard hearing community. Mask requirements also huge detrimental effects experience event industries. People don’t want pay experience concert kind event can’t really enjoy it. There’s also huge discussion colleges vaccine requirements, 100% vaccinated, still requiring masks everywhere. It’s mindless. 

But I’m talking big picture everything involved covid limitations. many businesses lives destroyed.  Israel Portugal apparently ended far 

Portugal seeing raise cases far signs real wave deaths near zero  I've giving lot thought recently. way see it, we've got lot tools prevent health-care system getting overloaded one really using together effectively. point pandemic, think governments' ability focus protecting society's health care infrastructure resources minimizing amount strain them, still allowing social activity much possible. I'm also including nurse/physician manpower resource here, currently short supply.

The three big categories people governments focusing Prevention, Awareness, Education, three relate other. government's role facilitate three things believe done effectively, lockdowns necessary point. relate well create synergistic system reduces burden hospitalizations maximizing personal freedoms broadly reasonable degree pandemic. 

So going depth:

**Prevention** - Preventing health infrastructure getting overwhelmed. Vaccines, wearing masks, getting treatment minimize amount resources needed treat covid patients. Vaccines obviously good preventing hospitalization, important well vaccinated population. Masks (N95's specifically since they're effective) cut transmission rates people less likely spread public, meaning less people getting sick time, preventing acute strain hospitals. 

Early treatment also key see people emphasizing enough. I'm going get ""prophylactic treatments"" outside staying healthy vaccinations controversy misinformation surrounding topic. Anyways, much resource intensive treat severely I'll covid patients ICU treat covid patients beginning illness they're responsible treatment options have. decent treatment options moment, soon we'll new covid specific antivirals market even effective preventing hospitalizations. key though need administered early, much damage accrued person's body thing doctors put organ support treatment like vents dialysis hoping best.

**Awareness** - things get control, really need relying testing people know they're covid positive quarantine they've recovered reduce transmission rates. Regardless vaccination requirements are, time everyone show negative tests entering non-essential public places events, avoiding restrictions people time reducing odds people public spreading around faster. need minimize infection chains reduce strain hospitals. 

I'm living Germany free testing centers everywhere 3G/2G system basically required people going non-essential public places present proof vaccination, recovery, negative covid test. last month switched 2G, people need either proof vaccination recovery. Removing emphasis testing mistake though. believe rational really matter vaccinated people caught since they're less likely get hospitalized. theory true, huge outbreaks like current one, lot people, vaccinated unvaccinated, catching spreading around covid increases chances people prone needing hospitalizations catch short succession well. making sure people aware need isolate reduce strain. 


**Education** - Honestly, seems like least feasible three. I'm sure reach people who've gone antivax rabbit hole. think teaching people things important, especially use testing effectively important get treated early, cut severe outbreaks are. Basically need empower people know use tools effectively.

So, that's thoughts matter anyways who? what? However, I’ve also read opinions doctors say US able “boost” pandemic; really it’s vaccinating unvaccinated folks we’ll able overcome it.

Okay, possible many unvaccinated people dead-set getting vaccinated? one strategy literally impossible, need move next strategy, bolster immunity majority population willing get vaccinated. gap is. unvaccinated folks. doesn’t mean deserve die, made choice. read then. article clearly talking people refusing get vaccinated extending pandemic causing additional precautions necessary 

Are talking article containing section? put simply, comes stopping transmission, even good vaccination rate always good help,"" said Ralf Reintjes, professor epidemiology public health surveillance Hamburg University Applied Sciences Germany. ""They're one stone process stopping virus. strong enough alone."" Yupp, thats thing. cant read specific article general many experts beginning realize delta infective, vaccines waning effectiveness even vaccinated people able spread disease means wont easy previously thought eradicate disease there's shift opinions many experts now. 

It used like ""lets achieve herd immunity done"" like "" probably going become endemic lets plan accordingly."" That's whats changing recent wave IMO. vaccines end it, nothing will. can't mask distance way this.  Israel did. It’s smart imo. USA recommend same. wears 6 months, 5 gives overlap safe. 

I able get booster 5 1/2 months CVS. said “it’s little early” let get it.  point it’s vastly easier get two jabs maintain healthy lifestyle. makes fairer attach negative consequences decision get jabs. I’m agreeing you. thousands protested Vienna today, many praising yelling Ivermectin. also warning ""keep bodily openings tightly closed"" due idea police going spray vaccinations helicopters. wear 3 layers clothing prevent undercover agents covertly vacccinating them. Along marched right extremists, anti-Semites, drunks. weapon choice beer bottles, hurled police. firecrackers.  Bidens great job pandemic, almost feels like personaly forgotten it.

This seems unfair Biden wanted start booster rollout adults back September, thwarted FDA CDC.  I'm sorry given advice. least got longest-lasting vaccine. read far Moderna boost seems protect least 10 months. Can’t find article, take grain salt. also hope boost longer lasting. I'm surprised see anyone mentioning Pfizer pill that's likely going actual nail coffin covid. effective vaccine, post-infection, preventing severe symptoms/hospitalization/death. Meaning even spread endemic scope, health risk significant society thanks effective treatment. thing, rough, side effects pretty much gone within 20 hours.  that's thing -- us position several times *never* takes seriously either government populace. bring freezer trailers stack bodies, sometimes even prisoners wheel dead cellmates them. 

mandatory vaccination time months ago country government content scraping way 60% full vax letting antivaxxers die take others them. earlier public health measures like social distancing -- leaving states joke compliance hardly ever enforced real way, pointlessly accepted wide scale death &amp; suffering stopped since.

the austrian government facing crisis rising may taken time, actually happened they've accomplished correct public health policy measure. 

this measure taking long means they're behind ball people still die good reason, possible ending policy choice means hospital load becomes manageable early next year, that's still big win really kind ""greater good"" type measure democracy. Yeah, that's BS. real difference far less testing much younger populations. They're stopping COVID. possibly used nasal spray 4ish hours Covid testing work. kind barely goes nose. nose drier Sahara Desert high noon. still get enough get accurate test that? thinking retesting today, nose still dry even without cold medication. I'm definitely sick want accurate test. need news. time rules force no-vax, no-brain, no-greenpass get shot want live normal life. None would needed unlimited hospital space healthcare workers available. Moderna Pfizer data showed much higher antibody titers boosters peak second dose. appears translating much better longevity boosters, **at least** 9-10 months. increasing among fully vaccinated people, especially age 40. So, that's metric matters, everyone 40 (or 50 depending data) get booster avoid hospitalization.

The willfully unvaccinated difficult convince, gains vaccinations small incremental. might take many boosters avoid hospitalizations deaths initial vaccinations, also generally easier convince people get booster dose initial one. course, order temper current surge much possible.

I keep quoting Dr Eric Topol recent NPR interview this, sums clearly, ""if want avoid symptomatic infection long COVID 18 39, would get booster. 40 above, want avoid hospitalizations deaths addition symptomatic infection, get booster."" same. Kind interesting see many Pfizer people deciding mix match. Yeah, mean, outside doctor bed keep treat him? /s boss, little year post covid, gets multiple fevers week still. Good luck! Oh, know now, wasn’t Israel proved it. course lied to. Millions people been. many people talking, see issue clearly. thing left say blame unvaxxed. course everyone contributes, Germany low vaccine uptake general it’s majority driven unvaccinated. He’s hedging, smartly, vast bulk spread unvaccinated vaccinated risk. Precisely, people given chance get vaccine (I got mine soon could) point people either got vaccine virus, small minority vaccine virus yet, made decision rest us get lives. exactly life destroying effects wearing mask? know well Delta transmits vaccinated people, still relatively breaththrough infections compared unvaccinated infections. Actually wouldn’t.

“EXPERT SHARES EQUATION SHOWS EVEN 100% VACCINATION RATE ENOUGH STOP DELTA mean, soap water would kill vitro, right? I'll go drink ton that.

See guys later! still need masks public transit bring few. good time! :) Maybe media painted wrong picture experts saying start. problem Delta came earlier experts anticipated. older variants already died relatively low vaccination rates Delta spreading faster evading protection. puts much stress hospitals, without Delta we'd still feel pandemic would managable. Delta R value around 5-6, crazy infectious. Even vaccines R 1. come African Asian countries large delta variant waves gotten virus almost completely control? delta variant end infecting almost everyone countries?   Wtf dudes mom covid, dude lost sense taste smell STILL get tested? 
What logic behind this? want understand brains tell need get tested I’ve couple vaccinated admits, immune deficiency kind. Surely would died vaccinated well. surprising since Bojo almost died early on. That’s bullshit. many many vaccines development we’re learning time. new mechanisms.

Got mine last weekend Thank you, one sane person Despite knowing opposition public health measures well documented historical records, never anticipated people would actually go extreme protesting largely mild restrictions. opposition trying slow pandemic really quite surprise me, intensity magnitude effort. think countries struggling messaging boosters. easy sell UK either actual rollout nowhere near well organised England original vaccination. Definitely picking though. would feel pretty stupid resigned job, result efforts pointless delay booster rollout succeeded endangering Americans setting us holiday surge cases. thought UK cases related children school bringing home infections. Germany’s leading health expert Christian Drosten:

Yes. vaccinated died. we’re finding need give third shots time. 

But, key part left out: “Fully vaccinated people made 30% deaths last month, older 60 underlying medical woes, line studies showing vaccines offer less protection old ill.”

If you’re young, healthy third jab risks extraordinarily low. curiosity, know vaccination status every patient? admitted hours? anyone experienced smell hallucinations?

I'm suggesting maybe learn accept over...

I'm frustrated botched COVID response, too. government media convinced people stop stuffing faces go exercise, burden hospitals could've much smaller, yet are.. Current vaccines end it. Third generation vaccines looking like might. Elderly, white British also higher vaccination rates whilst young people minorities lowest. main Tory demographics please either find evidence contrary I’ll go numbers saying agree caveat young kids can’t. 3 1 year old. can’t get life vaccinated. minute it’s available they’re getting shot, us can’t. us, please, keep minimum care neighbors. Wear mask public. I’m saying don’t live life, public sphere, please help keep little kids safe. No, can't.

The point masks stressful, depressive, reduces quality life millions people. Mask mandates something taken easy, especially vaccibated people Policy sledge hammer, scalpel. Working local health department last 2 years real eye opener.

Source: masters public policy (MPP) currently work policy maker. Example data? I'm asking ignorant. Though that's 80+ first month vaccination campaign, controlled political affiliation all. really anything separates null hypothesis ""people live wealthier consituencies superior access medical Isn’t sort racist insinuate description actually describes vast majority Africa? article. 

But much interesting topic variant specific vaccines. also kept wondering hell delta specific vaccines yet since effectiveness clearly down. problem vaccine induced antibodies (etc) ""recognise"" delta variant. do. spike protein unchanged. problem delta multiplies enormously faster overwhelm immune system still beginning mount response. tweaked vaccine pointless. example realistic, unvaccinated filling hospitals, would need mandate point I’m asking much personally witnessed. explains got lol. Breakthrough infection big deal, definitely got Ann Arbor ~3 weeks ago.  saying, ""the USA never famine, civil war violence"". 

And counts say does.

Dog whistle much? Whatever exit plan is, see vaccine mandates boosters directly related it. I’m curious people weakened immune systems naturally weeded population, dying one diseases run rampant, especially mostly poor health care systems. 

Maybe immune system African population stronger. vaccine trains immune system fight covid, also puts immune system high alert general, could something it. areas/demographics, different specialties

These affecting reporting. vaccine independent variable regard areas misleading media reports

But could affecting reporting main Tory demographics much higher vaccination rates overall population, it’s straight delusional try say right UK antivax yet, anyway.

The way things going country, wise take anything granted.  You’re right. aimed shots well. initial source incomplete.  I’m waiting well. Pfizer.  highly simplified abstraction get think probabilistically. guess abstract. Got mine yesterday (Moderna).

Sore arm feel like bunch strenuous exercise. (Just sore over). go first two doses went, I'll fine tomorrow - first two doses ""worse"" side effects totally gone approximately 36 hours dose.  don’t know vaccine worry keeping people hospitals

The vaccines specifically trialed symptomatic infection. Anyone claimed ""they're still job"" keep people hospitals whatever ended totally destroying credibility. Warning shots dangerous, though! Well, politicians least. lackies go jail time. Remember Chris Christie fucked whole city's traffic mayor endorse him, let staff jail media tour like ""come guys, bridge putting cones up."" ran president currently threatening again.  think we’ve passed point, considering choices. Well two people hospital sudden lead allergy. formulas natural law. They’re spot approximations based estimates. They’re highly probabilistic depend lot bounded calculations. know natural law usually means?

I’m concern trolling. know concern trolling is? Right, definitely unprecedented power grab governments loss freedoms right work, patronize businesses, countries go anywhere outside home unless ""qualify."" mentally wrong conservatives? go way look broken, obviously stupid way things right now. understand saying, original claim. Also, example, assuming 99% population vaccinated. many countries close high. I'd rather even ""mild"" case help it.

Their definition ""mild"" ""not hospitalized""  one case mad Biden admin announced everyone would getting boosters soon officially approved, blocked spite.

Terrible public servants, scientific skills STILL managed worse Biden admin. formulas natural law. I'm sorry rationality makes feel bad, that's way understand world.* However, parameters estimates definitely leeway there. top effect vaccines change behavior suppressing transmission. point article. need too. 

Your linked article July. We've since seen delta spreads lot among vaccinated people thought. Perhaps 90ish percent triple vaxxed it. numbers in. 

 *See, one concern troll.  Anti vaxxers maybe. hate different rules different people specific instance. Dire Flies sound pretty fucking intense. much civil war famine experienced lifetime? Ever seen neighbors toddlers hands chopped off? course not, that's something fix yourself. Different areas/demographics, different specialties, false misleading media reports, combination those, maybe — I’m ICU, area approximately 50% fully vaccinated residents statewide. 

And it’s worth, went shopping last night person mask aside employees. People aren’t acting like there’s pandemic here. can't believe bullshit read everywhere ""what vaccines intended do""

It totally specious. Destroyed lot credibility.  Obviously talking hospitals you. thick, what? Try move australia can? Take care mental health first always. Part problem definition lockdown gradually broadened mean pretty much restrictions businesses. Yup. literally never get better this—all point convince people get vaccinated let run course. Preventing infections delays inevitable great cost little apparent benefit.

If we’re truly concerned healthcare systems mandate vaccines. rest us years lives taken made right decision got vaccinated. altruism goes far. No, causes severe stress anxiety, significantly lowers quality life.

Is really trivial you? covid end March 2020, fevers multiple times week September. buy that, especially days made concoction decided make tiktok video, detailed article. video old. Okay. say population 10m vaccinated 100,000 unvaccinated 10,000 admits 50% split populations. 

Which population higher risk per capita? diet exercise? people downvoting this? Isn’t logical? Cases != Hospitalizations.

High vaccination rates guarantee low cases guarantee low hospitalization rates. future winter 2022 always fixed number covid infections-for vaccinated folks statistically flu like illness become yet another illness flu like symptoms.   forever, definitely first 6-12 months. Affinity maturation takes time, can't start get infection first dose. First doses (especially young people) far important use vaccines. No. No. Im clever one 😂😭 lol speak India -millions died. simple that. believe Indonesia something similar happen. Malaysia extremely high vaccination rate (95% adults). combination natural immunity vaccinations.  “herd immunity”? Wasn’t supposed happen 75% population vaccinated? 50% hospital admissions serious news reports speak “warning shots”. fired air. Opening fire protesters makes misleadingly sound shot them.  countries those? Many non-democratic countries really sold vaccination rates plus high cumulative infection rates still NPIs. hand Japan vaccines masks, Korea continues balance knife edge 18 months. 50% what? I’m sure understand probability here. problem people getting vaccine fat / exercising.  50% probability. Rare would less 1% even .1%. Ignorance?

Prejudice?

Too much time social media? Humans don’t decide hurricanes over. hurricane/nature/God/pick-your-phrase decide that. go first seems storm passed, risk getting caught open eyewall.   one strategy literally impossible

It's impossible. government mandate get vaccinated done whole nonsense. Considering exponential growth delays infection detection, plus Halloween, deer season, imminent Thanksgiving, long Michigan gets bad Austria? Honestly, many infections already happened yet detected reported?  laxatives salesman, guess. I've read horse paste nice apple taste. Omg onions garlic too! haven’t found anyone else relate weird phenomenon. I’m 11 months post covid things still back normal one believes, believe, current set Dutch restrictions full extent possible restrictions. whole past two years, current example Austria, know that. Obviously error appealed /s “Can’t forced allow” that’s twisting around try make sound like wasn’t trying force doctors provide treatment medically disagreed with.  wikipedia: ""Hib conjugate vaccines shown universally effective manifestations Hib disease, clinical efficacy among fully vaccinated children estimated 95–100%""

NHS still enormous pressure covid suddenly disappeared. Yes. almost certainly need follow Israel’s example treat 3 series. Lots vaccines need 3-4 rounds confer lasting immunity. biggie. Governments may put big people pants take action. That's thing US, states towns, crazy antivaxer conspiracy theorists numerous enough make majority electorate end ones responsible determining public health policies. multiple states who've banned public health officials pretty much anything besides giving press conferences, that's going stay place pandemic passes. Imagine new global pandemic starts factory farm Texas, there's nothing anyone stop still local since enacting mask mandates quarantining forbidden either vaccines enough infections bring heel. path.

Agreed, long term path.

But looks like even literally everyone double vaccinated virus still circulate non trivial number people hospitalised dying. Possibly boosters cross threshold places people take vaccine. Otherwise may taper non pharmaceutical measures (masking etc) longer slowly get infected reinfected top vaccines. horrid mess. 

And deity help places people refuse vaccine. want break leg Poland right now. So, fresh data Czech ""Ratio"" column shows much likely (infected, hospitalized, ICU) unvaccinated comparison fully vaccinated (2 doses now, people Janssen, 1 dose).

The protective effect serious disease obviously very, strong &lt; 60 group, grows weaker increasing age. Third shots (boosters) absolutely going necessary.

Original data source used Google Translate translate table English. South Africa tested 31% population. DRC 0.3%. simply reliable data Africa, except richest areas like French islands, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Tunisia, Morocco, etc. matter need shot every six months years order survive curtail pandemic? spoiled think somehow rationalize virus...

It took approximately 6 weeks fully recover 2nd vaccination. I'm definitely without extremely good evidence, *certainly* 6 months. Good experience less awful. Yes, know vaccination status covid positive patients. Typically patient comes us ER another floor, get information nurse hands off. It’s part medical record could look anytime, it’s typically included shift change especially first days patient there.

All patients asked vaccination status (that’s true facility years flu pneumonia). tell us, haven’t anyone refused report that.

The big question happen carnival winter. considering giving boosters everyone got last dose 5 months ago... OP I've seen people saying support ""medical freedom"" meaning support antivaxxers able healthcare jobs I’m vaccinated, I’m US enforced lockdown. I’ll OK that. think vaccinated not, they’re childish. wanna get back normal, want adult it, even vaccinate would stay meant everyone stays in, also means things get back normal faster. criticism here. fact you’re seeing criticism shows you’re part problem.

That’s far right. Yes, mandatory. Also, many offer full protection 20-30 years even lifetime. Like Measles, tetanus, Chickepox, etc. Also, older virus vaccines 2-3 doses. newer ones 4 dose series usually bacteria. covid requires 4 doses, unique like flu. mandate flu even though deadly.

Anyway, suspect goes CDC FDA panels. guess question means ""end pandemic"". people might mean virus goes away completely, unrealistic, means spreading rate people really need worry healthcare shortage, vaccines truly ""end pandemic."" Ok... doesn’t mean frequent boosters given. That’s case almost every vaccine give, flu exception covid mutate way flu does. Pfizer J&amp;J formulations before, dose sizes unchanged.

Moderna's formulation also unchanged, dose size halved, 100mcg 50mcg. That's still larger Pfizer's full dose (30mcg).

Also, issue necessarily bed management, staffing issues. Primarily nurses. 

I'm icu nurse basically whole country got infected delta long ago?

Edit: remember reported 400,000 cases one day.  tried multiple different health divisions said wasn’t possible report anything  Strictly speaking, necessarily problem, definitely bit unusual.  Yeah, really last resort kind situation, mismanagement months ""the pandemic over"", ""there lockdown vaccinated people"" government. Due local elections ""saving Winter tourism"" etc negated projections react time despite knowing better. we're lovcdown announced mandatory vaccine.
Our government really broke trust society divided, large parts also fault charge, right wing extremists still unvaccinated. u r Whats austria totalitarian bullshit  Austrian here, you’d asked year ago would‘ve defended everyones right choose whether want get vaccinated not, it’s personal choice.

HOWEVER, would never imagined sheer amount people selfish, distrustful science government, honestly, outright dumb. lot conspiracy/fake news/overall backwards thinking involved. Best example (and believe me, true, can’t make shit up): people taking deworming medicine meant horses (!) „fight“ Covid Austrian right-wing politician said helps. People ended intensive care it.

So I, many, 100% support decision - situation getting hand health system verge collapse.

It’s sad vaccines mandated people act responsibly solidarity, that’s takes, I'd find hilarious, proper helicopters? ;D know that. vaccines referring to? Three mandatory many years, rest mandatory give children past years, exactly reason vaccination rates low herd immunity. person claim religious exemption mother vaccinated? mean know people change views get older obviously religious reasons. get it. I'd like get booster weekend since roommates got covid away, 2nd vaccine date would put six month wait December. suppose anyone speculate find source efficacy differences booster taken slightly prior six month delay?

Europe going lockdown again, February probably time high covid cases. Probably 2x higher last winter like Europe right now. fair, even article could falling short analysis. Let explain: live ""poorer"" country (actually middle-income country) high vaccination rate currently low curve terms cases deaths. even though testing capability less ideal, actually sort ""relief"" moment, since ICU occupancy low level right now.

I would say lot variables needed make good analysis, wealth. (for example, summer proven virus spread easily closed places, also variants might delayed entrance Delta variant). Nice Data Israel showed immunity decreasing boosters effective CDC first made decision approve them, fact actively discourage them. think laws often misunderstood. mainly 4 aspects: collect unnecessary data, get explicit consent, store safely personalisation needs minimized.

So business providing vax records, absolutely collect, store process related information, long meet criteria much reasonably possible. Instead name, could e.g. use hash value unique ID card numbers. made laugh. point here? render mandatory vaccines require boosters?  really hard get accurate figures population density, especially since habitation areas always coincide city boundaries.

For one data point support claim, recent UN report says three ten densest cities world Africa: Casablanca, Lagos, Abuja. quite bad India parts southeast Asia, quite crowded certain places.

It really sucks. averaging higher cases hospitalizations time last year. last year major hospitals kept adding empty beds overflow areas keep hospital capacity 90-95% worst winter surge. definitely ideal something needs done make sure actually get even worse year.

This true. risk Moderna quantified far I'm aware. risk myocarditis Pfizer vaccine appears lower risk Covid, evidence suggest current administration protocol (in jurisdictions) aspirating syringes injection may increase risk greatly. much humans well studied (for obvious reasons), studies mice suggest inadvertent intravenous injection may virtually guarantee heart inflammation blood clotting.

Big difference - almost one would die! Health care overworked understaffed situation.
Relevant Info: vaccinated people still spread virus time greatly reduced. possibility spreading also somewhat reduced. possibility vaccinated people get virus another vaccinated person also reduced. best - virus load vaccinated person another vaccinated person lot less likely develop bad state virus. chances never 0, effects accumulate far better situation tons people willfully endangering people's lives getting vaccine.

Well, shocked. figure 2033. Unreadable biased    wave brought mostly unvaccinated refuse listen experts.

Said experts can't account stupidity, sadly. Also welcome science results/predictions change based new data. longer feel inconvenienced all, honest. you? reason cases go restrictions, isn’t better. new generation vaccines block transmission come up, cases, deaths. chief scientist recently stated virus airborne, addition spreading droplets, aerosol, much stop it. Either vaccine stops viral replication effective cure. 

It’s misplaced blame everything people, countries great compliance suffering. Ireland 94% full vaccinated, Singapore 85% (only kids mainly aren’t), Gibraltar 100% still highest cases ever. else population do? People stay home day here, can’t go without mask, mandated. yet 1000s Covid cases day. It’s simplistic say cases happening people following measures. it’s absolute insult us taken every precaution yet suffer it’s taboo talk virus actually spread effective measures actually are. 

Keep blaming fellow citizens, exactly get side. even alienate side. Yeah, data actually pretty conclusive: vaccine works everyone vaccinated, pandemic would pretty much over.

Well, went 30% willing vaccinated year now. article poor job explaining TIL risk assessment = fear Nooo they're getting real prescriptions online doctors. #sarcasm  Novavax isn’t used much safety trials aren’t finished.

Obviously use 18 boosters 2 doses still left vial pull booster doses.  zero evidence that.

“What epidemic unvaccinated -- 10% population 12 unvaccinated, we're seeing epidemic people, predictably”

In places simply issue large enough pockets unvaccinated. Nothing new. im NJ USA- numbers down, getting vaccinated... still wear mask public- 80% dont...and though still get vaccinated... numbers jumping big time, holidays arent yet?

this us years come, im prepared..alot educated care learn it..I family 2 close friends, im safe,im also ok going restaurants safe. one ever said vaccine would eliminate covid forever. greatly reduces chance complications death disease. mind, live normal lives ability protect significant way. study proves lesser symptoms less transmission?

I know multiple people vaxed caught covid. sick I'd call mild symptoms. I've yet personally see case vaccinated = less symptoms. sample size obviously small. Remember vaccines normal part life without drama?

Sounds like awfully inefficient way medicine.

This problem is, beginning realize now. That's subject article. None actually highly vaccinated, i.e., 85%-90% either prior infection three doses. countries close, like Portugal 88% two doses, far better ones twice far away (Netherlands) even (Germany). still getting colder.  No. Governments handling pandemic requires protesting.  Nobody, least me, said anything stopping it. It’s ending pandemic phase entering endemicity degree background rate live with. never said stop it. Please read I’m saying stop putting words mouth. 

You seem unwilling unable parse point: herd immunity bring endemicity likely achievable high enough vaccination maintenance vaccination. 

None European countries major waves right near figure 90%+ population vaccinated. headline stupid buried lede. *how* live it? options seem accepting constant restrictions overwhelmed hospitals thousands deaths. critically

I'm afraid we're never getting past specific roadblock. According article key repetition focus. again. Really sucks there’s hope! knocked mob? hospital everything else be, agree treatment everything else, really can't expect use methods. ones gonna sign that.  haven’t seen updated Information. article says 8.9 million, month ago, huge difference timing. 

As guess, wouldn’t say *most* elderly/vulnerable them, likely people actively concerned them.  we're country listens Joe Rogan doctors

Let's real: stupid people this. way many stupid people? Oh hell yes. rest us shake heads. Nope. something like 1/3 eligible seniors gotten boosters. really blame wishy washy messaging playing role this. Boosters work. important. LOT people 50. Especially total pool drawing 7 billion. US people acting like we're still 2020 covid numbers starting look bad peak 2020 places. states worst surges ever late summer. Hospitals ICUs filling bad everyone, severe cases covid. Short version: figure make drug toxic required dose might beneficial covid treatment. Basically different chemical might useful. really. Americans trained things don’t go way, litigate. doesn’t work, keep going find right judge rule favor. Look, wanna self medicate Ivermectin home, fight covid way, guest.

But hospital, demands help you, use methods. agreement. Delta evade vaccines, transmissible. Pfizer Moderna already tested delta specific vaccines better current vaccines. words, current vaccines already delta specific. retrain brain according article. Excercise repetition. huge pain, doable. mom (vaccinated) telling step-brother (unvaxxed) 104 fever 10 days managed get made feel better. think it’s legit. mom’s friend late 70’s early 80’s refuses get vaccine. told mom medicine hand case gets sick. mom inquired got proudly proclaimed “a Mexican pharmacy”

Ok, don’t trust 100% vetted vaccine FDA CDC, trust de-worming drug procured Mexican pharmacy. can’t even.  still quite get point here. Antibodies decay. surprising. consequence that, sterilizing immunity lasts months. However, studies show effect also show efficiency hospitalization death remains less unchanged.

In understanding, means 2 doses vaccine fact induce long-lasting immunity, andbody level decays while.

This going different booster. supposed get booster every 8 weeks now? That's going happen. might course make sense get one winter youre 75, really get point every 30-year-old.

Change view? Maybe help hospitals overwhelmed. benefits everyone.  Ontop said already people less cautious/ pandemic fatigued last year didnt delta, lot agressive takes every opprtunity gets. Last year lockdown, year lot open. Last year germany hospitalisation rate 6-7% now, vaccines 0,8% also never many infections before. Everyone unvaccinated get infected mostly unvaccinated clogg hospitals. vac rate isnt great. am. vaccinated extraordinarily low. Especially who’ve third jab.

Third, Delta raged leaders worldwide knew vaccine effectiveness waned six months, government discouraged adults getting boosters. even shamed took matters hands figured ways get boosted. KNEW point everyone would need boosters, public health leadership acted though question mark. missed narrow window clear communication everyone get third dose instead made situation ambiguous possible public confused best hostile worst. 

Public health officials opportunity lead fell flat reasons never understand. risk stillbirth 4 times higher pregnant women Covid, according research paper: 

""The adjusted risk stillbirth higher deliveries COVID-19 compared deliveries without COVID-19 March 2020–September 2021 (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.69–2.15), including pre-Delta (aRR = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.27–1.71) Delta periods (aRR = 4.04; 95% CI = 3.28–4.97). COVID-19 documented delivery associated increased risk stillbirth, stronger association period Delta variant predominance.""

aRR means adjusted risk ratio. Pre-Delta, infected women 40% likely stillbirth, already bad, post-Delta, **400% likely stillbirth**, awful. 

I hope help pregnant women make minds vaccination. Half dozen research papers shown vaccines safe pregnant women fetus, even feel ""there may still rare unknown risks baby,"" surely nothing bad 400% increase risk baby dying.  zombies? describing USA? many boosters given far US? elderly vulnerable covered now?  I’m healthy person who’s fully vaxxed. I’m worried winter. currently Corona lost taste smell. I’m worried won’t come back worse, food smell taste like sewage. guess. signs point endemic virus though. Even assume 100% vaccination planet (obviously reasonable assumption).   check source it’s ages 16+ 18+. 16-24 age group 96%+, it’s unlikely figures going whole lot different younger ages, also need vaccinate younger ages minimal risk.

Haha sky stay despite doomsaying, virus endemic, time get lives.  Yes vaccine passport works well least Manhattan. Meh, need stop catering tiny vocal minority. congregate one place, mean lot them. necessarily effective vaccine passports. Maybe need lockdowns waited long. “I don’t know vaccine worry keeping people hospitals,” Fauci said at White House briefing Wednesday. “I think important thing prevent people getting symptomatic disease.”

I hope we're way killing tired argument, comes people even right side vaccine issue, deaths hospitalizations matter. Companies generate buzz social media. may look like they're getting cancelled, fact they're drawing business different demography. course great Santa vaccinated, total PR move.  family vaccinated, live highly vaxed area, I'd pissed locked down. really give fuck antivaxxers; want plague, stay home since doctors can't trusted. long space hospital treat people, die want to. should, principle, stay disability too.

But vaccines new antivirals protect people dying it.  Yes tests 2 days Thanksgiving everyone day anyone traveling. Cases low NYC vaccination high. vaccinated.

We’ve used thought exposed - classmate testing positive, distanced masked. tested negative. symptoms didn’t PCR tests. 

We vulnerable people family protecting stay careful. Last year didn’t real Thanksgiving. year real Thanksgiving close family members - in-laws, aunts uncles, cousins. Grandmother attending. extremely upset this. US September advised receive booster (by pharmacist) returning country currently in.

You get two injections want. you’re still trying dig grave don’t take care yourself. It’s really simple friend. 

Seeing effects two injections substantially waning (from 95% effective 66% effective) 4-6 months. I’d guess leading healthy lifestyle heavily outweighs importance two injections. Don’t take medical advice reddit. Seriously, possible, talk doctor this. Excellent graph showing correlation high vaccination rates low deaths. Iceland Malta one end, Bulgaria Ukraine other. one graph prove efficacy vaccination, would use one axes. well said.

You’re getting downvoted you’re wrong. talking nearly enough life-destroying effects limitations stay homes endless masking fall-out covid world, especially young people never much risk.

Vaccines work, life always risk, people need able live lives young people need chance live. 17 percent Reality check: 17% U.S. adults received booster shot, advisory panels FDA CDC needed listen research high quality data presented Pfizer, NIH Israel's health ministry months ago. would followed science, presented advisory panels, boosters would've started rolling September even earlier. Like many things pandemic, we've learn hard way, hope last big unforced error pandemic US, doubt be. engineers masters degrees. mean like Austria originally announced, day later switched national lockdown?

OMG, thank you. can't believe bullshit read everywhere ""what vaccines intended do"" booster debate. experience Israel giving absolutely crystal-clear real-world evidence massive cost-benefit efficacy boosters.  Source? Thanks. UK overloaded data thought may publish figures. No, saying vaccines enough people refusing get vaccinated, reinstitute forms lockdown.

It's response previous belief earlier year/last year hold vaccines available. That's case refusals, vaccines acting like vaccines do.

Vaccinated people can't go back normal ton unvaccinated spreaders get infected, will, likely unvaccinated person. Mine never came back either Risks vaccinated include kept ambulance hours, need emergency medical care, hospitals full. understand legal argument/stance now. think wouldn’t hold court 2 reasons. I’m legal, could 100% wrong. 

The FDA requires 2 names drug approval - generic name brand trademark name. name change required, marketing play. Applications EUA vaccine FDA approved vaccine use code/research name BNT162b2.

Pfizer also uses names interchangeably. Comirnaty package insert, Pfizer references Comirnaty’s EUA 12/11/2020. That’s date FDA approved Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine/ BNT162b2 EUA. 

I think it’s interesting point make. don’t think would actually stick. it’s good make people aware scent training, would careful presenting “what fixable put effort.”

It doesn’t work like that. Scent training MAY help, everyone recover sense smell.

I'm vaccine mandates not, unfortunately European governments keen appeasing anti vax crowd. Last year, vaccines. strictness restrictions varied, life everywhere significantly altered. needed, otherwise huge tragedy would unfolded.

But year, seems like political decision. UK back 2019. Sweden. restrictions Germany, Austria Netherlands happen? ICUs actually full? governments risk averse? Austria imposed general lockdown applies everyone regardless vaccination status. 100% vaccine passports wish area them. Mask mandates work point vaxed wear masks thus fill hospitals. Ah guardian coming another fearmongering story.

The UK vastly different trajectory European countries. 30k 50k daily since July. zero restrictions months rather huge peak ripples.

This week instance 48k start several days dips, today 40k. also testing significantly countries

Contrast European countries rapidly accelerating.

Its almost like UK ""dangerous experiment"" summer got us near equilibrium virus. 

We likely restriction free Christmas, European neighbours locked Christmas. even read story? restrictions unvaccinated. decisions happened authorities trying influence collective social behavior prioritize certain groups people others, rather simply treating everyone equally best interest patient doctor's office. suppose understand policy-makers think. Make rule, apply equally. customize ""equity""--just apply equally. that's policy ever done, really--it's arena struggle scarce resources.  problem. Back issue populations 90%+ antibodies. link? Antivirals coming though. They're easier manufacture vaccines. 45 year old Dr died sadly days booster

BBC News - 'Selflessly dedicated' Swindon doctor dies Data shows immunity defintely waning healthcare workers seeing doubled vaxxed people past 6 months.

Scientists already working longer lasting vaccines think we'll need every 6 months booster might even give longer lasting immunity anyway, early say sure. vaccines given courses several shots effective long-term. 3rd dose could trick!

I reckon early complacent get booster. Europe UK live really high cases reckon get worse immunity wanes. rise bullshit alternative therapies strong movement science-based medicine.

In Belgium I've seen way many pharmacies selling bullshit treatments like essential oils homeopathic remedies. didnt force fully vaccinated lockdowns.

Article says government doung making needed proof vaccination negative test take part certain events dining etc none things prevented **as easily as** getting two injections.  Hope feel better soon. experience second Pfizer dose?  Cool. say it. Nobody English says “an endemic” doesn’t work.

But I’m curious 90%+ population-level antibody societies are. whether they’re controlling antibodies versus meaningful titer. coworker got pregnant soon vaccine available neighbor obgyn nurse gave enough awful stories good medical advice got vaccinated pregnant, wish people trusted people listen got goofballs internet  life never left, livelihood.... I've heard here, probably google ""burnt orange brown sugar"" find instructions. understanding came tik-tok video guy posted Jamaican remedy. anecdotes saying worked them, others say useless... guess might well try it! (Just burn house cooking orange.) Stop innondating Dude, same. can’t smell flowers adults, percent people risks vaccine higher covid very, small.  Children younger age approved vaccine able controlled enough short term small enough number disease could ended.

So, yes, technically right everyone vaccinated, suspect trying shift blame deserve it.

If everyone choosing get vaccinated without legitimate medical risk got vaccinated, pandemic would over. That’s better. Again, English don’t say “an endemic.”

An endemic incorrect. endemic disease correct. No, correct use word.

Where else 90%+ antibodies?  people got vaccinated told way back normality, that's enough avoid lockdowns restrictions.

Can see would piss alot people ?  reports Canada, 1st two shots 8 weeks apart instead 4 could get people vaccinated , appears approach actually helped efficacy vaccine, think vaccines aren’t given close together. since first 2 shots seemed get vaccinated delta wave, done 8 weeks apart we’d maybe boosters (or least soon).  guess probably is, I’ve never donated blood I’m able due numerous health conditions.

It really depends person. may replenish base level blood, takes longer produce excess red blood cells. Also treatments take time slow production red blood cells, also aspirin thin blood lessen risk clots. Personally don’t regularly, it’s something blood tests show treatments aren’t effective enough. Others might every couple months though. DIET !!!

AND!!!

EXERCISE!!!

How many times say it? Obviously get vaccine wear mask, government programs promoting weight loss obese?! CDC's publically-available statistics say THREE times likely hospitalized COVID overweight obese!! 10 20 fold reduction infection symptomatic infection compared 2 doses. know long lasts, much higher level initial immunity second dose. NHS constantly operating breaking-point. vaccine uptake good, far ""excellent"".

If saying ""Just let us get lives,"" honest enough say happy people die less inconvenient personally. based solid research published Nature: author coming conclusions different paper's authors. paper's main point *boosters work*. also state sure booster's diminished effectiveness simply mutations like Delta variant.

The blog author correct we'll likely need brand new vaccines new variants emerge current vaccines boosters longer effective. Hopefully post didn’t imply that. Slowing spread reducing severity great…but thing us forever. wears infection around 4-5 months (Pfizer) 5 makes perfect sense boost at.

COVID19 waits outside government deemed ""non-essential"" businesses 6pm infect people apparently. It’s probability.

That's honestly pretty tone deaf say. People's livelihoods stake things shut down. Non-essential services close 6pm Bars/restaurants 8pm. either type business (or even work one) expect significant financial hit.

Easy say pocketbook. stat saying think does. ""Numbers conservative constituencies higher"" tell constituencies got vaccinated didn't, people voted for. argument value discussion particular political leaning anti-vaxxers.

There far problems line argument: example, ignoring fundamental demographic differences constituencies; fact somehow equating Tories far-right. proof rare, countries saying 50% vaccinated? Delta variant discussed article reason vaccine less effective. possibility Delta focused vaccine discussed many locations, proves necessary. already know vaccines cause myocarditis? mean could stone unvaccinated people ... That's definitely assumed. I’m sure joke made times gatherings. similar actually. figured I'd experience booster. first shot feel anything part. Good luck shot! unplug him, drag ass home give there! I'm fed fat asses screaming rights clogging hospital beds. I'm scientist cosplay one inter idea. think fair ask Biden think talk one Working mask absolutely sucks.

Is possible? Absolutely. make wanna work out? Yep.

In state Oregon governor exempts team sports mandate, individuals working out. 10 people playing basketball, bumping allowed go maskless, someone treadmill socially distant anyone else still to.

It's arbitrary, scientific, makes people want work obviously huge negative effects physical mental health. Could early pandemic hard get tested Interesting, essentially like donating blood, without donation part. often that? always understanding takes 24 hours make blood donate, feel like would come back quickly That's probably true, since Israel uses Pfizer one earliest countries start using boosters. friend mine gave birth baby boy passed away hospital 3 days. indication anything wrong birth.

It 20 years, still feel loss, especially around time born. can’t imagine pain they’ve gone through. Yeah, think get involved higher risk social situations, careful around know vaccinated. go clubbing, especially maskless, meet unvaccinated family members shortly after. Hopefully unvaccinated get vaccinated still reasonably cautious. unvaccinated voluntarily putting high risk luxury situations like clubs bars though excusable. would define ""exit plan""? come hearing different reports? states countries saying 20-50% vaccinated. get nurses claiming rare occurrence, like 1- 200 something like that. Something adding up. mom went blind applied disability. denied, sent list jobs could still blind. Forgetting fact can't drive job, know, blind, one jobs listed ""Movie ticket taker.""

Understandable, facial expressions large part way humans communicate.  data infections, hospitalizations, death. Seems like gap data don’t know symptomatic Covid numbers. Probably looking sick day data (since governments generally access that) would give good estimate.   indeed. Bollox nothing.

Our hospital system 60% capacity, 4.5% Covid patients. COVID rates roughly nearly 4 months. I'm imagining things going well, going well, mainly 95% eligible adults vaccinated least one shot, kids quickly reaching status too.  making stuff article. read it? Specifically nobody talks delta focused vaccines.

Anyway, blatantly making stuff futile. Endemic used noun, mainly referring animals— “that bird endemic.”

But mostly use adjectival form diseases. Language like that. Nah, often getting lobotomies though? Anyone sound mind legally able sign AMA seek treatment elsewhere don’t trust current doctors. years I've bad sense taste. There's foods either can't taste taste wrong terrified I'd get covid it'd get even worse. get frustrated still somewhat taste. can't imagine taste extended period time.  Day two, I'm totally better. Woke slight headache got knocked Tylenol breakfast.

I'm glad boosters opened federal level adults yesterday. Let's get dosed holidays arrive.  Maybe coincidence boosters happen half dosage originals also? I’m sorry need 90%+ vaccinated. makes irrational too. 

The formulas aren’t natural law. They’re guidepost. virus we’re still figuring spread long-term immunity 95% lot immunologists epidemiologists say needed. 

This upsets too. also don’t attack others— we’re learning go. goalposts move naturally science. Science like that. Agreed, extrapolation approximately 1 1/2 years long enough strong degree confidence model. Might right early hang hat research - settle doomsday talk. reads science article written someone who's scientist. bold claims article written fact (each new booster half efficacy previous? booster lower efficacy due immune escape?). person credentials make claims?

The sensationalized prose constant bolding/italicizing definitely reads informally think someone who's qualified make claims. they’re crazy violent. Lovely. read it. decent read. Lucky, life livelihood severely impaired lockdowns things recovering really don’t want go back. Flies laying eggs. vaccines stop virus, stop consequences pandemic.

Vaccines work preventing deadly cases hospitalizations stop infections. everyone vaccinated, waves cases won’t mean flooded hospitals anymore.

Everyone vaccinated probably going happen probably developed countries reach rather high levels vaccinations. needs stop us get normal life back. virus longer flood hospitals, manage rest.

This article able return normal quickly previously expected . need keep measures place least instead relying solely vaccines eradicate virus. current Dutch measures barely qualify ""restrictions"", definitely lockdown. starting see hospitalizations deaths tick among vaccinated - immunocompromised. also seeing elderly. implies waning immunity worse *just* loss circulating antibodies.

Likely it’s three shot vaccine course (which isn’t unusual). 

Plus, people breakthrough cases getting long covid.  dropped vote pants. assault freedom gone long enough. months San Diego. It’s amazing. Antibodies wane, vaccines, takes significantly longer. Measles many others decades long protective antibody levels. goal vaccines prevent infection spread. isn’t prevent hospitalization. Preventing hospitalization final goal. It’s issue put country back lockdown fails. want pandemic control, prevent infection significant degree well. Yes seen year’s pharmaceutical conference Hawaii? saying experience wrong, come reports 30% higher unvaccinated states? Also, countries admitting 50% unvaccinated. restrictions country point stands I’d sacrifice typing finger god communication interactions like this.

 No-one spoke knows anyone COVID. bizarre    curiosity, would excellent uptake look like? Around 90% 18s vaccinated, even bit oldest age groups. countries higher percentage vaccinated overall, kids vaccinated. Look don’t want even posted semi-mad posting anything remotely political (much less Trump year later)…but go…

Whenever people slam Trump’s handling (and slammed, terrible pandemic), always feel need point even smart things left kicking screaming babies entire time. Neither party even come center it’s awful. 

For example, early coronavirus pandemic Donald Trump decided ban air travel China. US citizen would allowed fly back home, told hurry it. Absolutely air travel coming United States China. prudent move time. 

Did enlightened left say sad good science smart stop international air travel China early pandemic?

No, called xenophobic racist. made whole entire pandemic issue race. Nancy Pelosi literally walking around Chinatown San Francisco desperate find Asian American people hug camera. whole thing absolutely ridiculous. social distancing time. Air travel China absolutely banned. wait 5-10 years passes, tell us awesome mRNA edits registry work. Bleach shut virus too.  Part problem someone dies stroke, pulmonary embolism, heart attack, etc., didn’t get tested beforehand, one ways determine Covid factor would autopsy, autopsies done rarely. way would attestation death certificate patient’s doctor family saying patient good shape, Covid symptoms died, something similar. Yes, correct. vaccine seem offer much protection older people, probably frail bodies weakened immune systems. 

But time, vaccine history offered low protection little time. people consider vaccine still- yes think risk. view point- 3-4x increase warrant mandatory vaccines. also need methods combat this- avoiding large gatherings outbreaks mask wearing appropriate. I'm doubtful vaccinate way need 3 boosters. unwilling take 3 shots. use gotta look HOT picking 60 rolls TP!

Ha, jokes you, Costco’s TP again.  South Africa must coldest country whole Africa.  right. natural law. mathematics even unavoidable. extremely hard argue iterative function apply. also right estimates go said much. taking values optimistic end range help without additional factor. words vaccines alone stop pandemic.
