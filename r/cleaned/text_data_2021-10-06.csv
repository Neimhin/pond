0,2021-10-06," I'm pro-vaccine, pro-mask unvaccinated.

People able wear mask want to, never mandatory vaccinated.  Sort controversial maximum entertainment. Yes this! sounds super annoying area lol ""Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies identified 97% COVID-19 convalescent donors initial presentation."" 

So clearly consensus infection illicit antibody response high percentage cases. Therefore, vaccination Vs naturally acquired immunity cannot put bed information.

Regardless, way comparison two ""put bed"" scientifically comparative study. asked comparative studies show vaccination alone provides greater protection previous infection alone.   recently went get qr code digital vaccine card found missing 1st dose. qr code 2nd dose. already used virtual assistant chat gave information proof vaccine shots. wait 2-3 weeks respond find solution.

 
Has anyone experienced this? me? false impression form organ transplant goes certain religious beliefs? I'm sure heard somewhere sometime past. allow posts singular individual. includes posts someone hospitalized, dying testing positive. think error, please modmail us.

So naturally violent person?  Like choice drive SUV sidewalk? live society; rights allowed violate safety others. Except nurses, CNAs, techs quitting mandate. One NY hospital recently halt labor delivery unit 6 18 nurses quit. degree/license healthcare doesn’t mean believe vaccine’s efficacy vice versa. never norm, never denied service people flu, polio, measles vaccine.

No, although many states fined people getting vaccinated Smallpox [the Supreme Court upheld According Wikipedia article, fine equivalent $150 today's money, nothing, definitely pretty easy ignore anyone middle-class above. big difference enforcement government, individual businesses. people gotten vaccinated initially told, needing passports. Congratulations, anti-vaxxers, brought yourselves!

I thought agreed “twice likely” study wasn’t equivalent comparison dropped it. instead pivoted previously mentioned study specifically addressed asked about.

What makes unwilling accept data willing accept (again, roundly rejected) study found?

And no, uses study doesn’t invalidate think raise eyebrow anti-vaxers ones taking particular study seriously. picture Burt Reynolds Boogie Nights saying Judge orders it...

Thanks. gives hope. protests country? ones 2020? largely outdoors many People look like I’m psychopath say rules society. mRNA around since 70s. new tech. vaccines adapted others worked since SARS viruses early 2000s. new tech. vaccine body 6 weeks-ish. We've billions vaccines administered issues. vaccines, like one developed Brisbane, issues inside 6 weeks giving false positive reads HIV tests. vaccines scrapped. ones we're getting safe, every peer reviewed study supports Wait, Moderna approved 18 Europe? yikes especially unholy intersection two course! religious sister-in-law treatment refusing vaccine “religious reasons”. fails see “religious reasons” used development remedy well. Tylenol Ibuprofen treated fever aches pains with. Oh, infected entire daycare. But, “Praise God” asymptomatic mild cases. worry, could come back lot quicker! started coming back week fully back 10 days. super mild case symptom slightly stuffy nose. take know simple fact, type using small words. Yes, vaccinated aware Moderna vaccine gives 90-95% chance getting COVID - aware give COVID, need go hospital, 98% chance living.

I also aware EVERYONE vaccine, daily case numbers would drop 100,000 new cases day; deaths would go towards 0 

I also improve odds LIFE wearing mask outside  Don’t care either way. It’s literally much work showing ID, going lose sleep it. Also hispanic voters Florida example different hispanic voters California. They've painted corner bright red paint, become total identity. way would admit they've trolled manipulated Fox, Trump, et al, they'd leave community screaming idiots find whole new group friends. bloody likely, are, stuck permanently aggrieved sub-section citizens go away shut up. I'm double vaccinated since start year. evidence physical card I'm state database done federal government.

I copy access medical record anymore. lose card gets damaged, way proving vaccinated. mention less likely get infected, therefore less likely spread population level either. Gotcha. Yeah, I'm glad vaccine mandate, going nightmare enforce. know eh would really cool see done going back couple years pre covid get better idea normal flu deaths like covid precautions. probably indicative cost unemployed land wage slave, USA. wasnt stupid I'd almost applaud sticking values risk everything. mean thats hard, there's lot would give stability actually savings. allow posts singular individual. includes posts someone hospitalized, dying testing positive. think error, please modmail us.

please outline vast costs involved?

What cost state issue photo-ID drivers license? $1? $3?

How much American taxpayers paying non-vaccinated COVID patient hospital vent? $20,000? $50,000? $100,000?

From pure business standpoint, there's massive amount sane, vaccinated people refuse go planes, trains, travel, inside business UNLESS know 100% certainity everyone 100% vaccinated. (with zero exceptions) Fines proportional income

I imagine lot rich people pay fine change behavior like parking fines several hundred thousand influenza deaths year Australia.

Since Covid-19 resulting public health measures protect - zero since July course we'll work maintain there's risk fumbling future results get complacent least one good thing come whole mess. wonder really funding parents changed boards minds. state mask mandate schools still psychopathic parents board meetings spouting anti-mask bullshit. It’s even boards hands. Police intervene. parents just, dumb. Adding believe pronounced ""r-naught"", 'r-oh.' keep hearing doctors call everything covid get paid treating people die causes. may true US hospitals charge doctors coroner's get money reason this. 

There's also fact US center universe civilized countries free healthcare also show similar numbers flu/covid deaths. flu even flu. Often people think flu something much milder less lethal. Flu also makes people sick even kills too. completely understand mandates things school, one's ever asked vaccine record enter restaurant football stadium.

I suggest go read 1918 Pandemic USA restrictions kicked 2nd 3rd year. -if- memory right, 1 150 Americans DIED 1918 version. moment, 1 475 Americans dead COVID-19. Didn't...she pull stunt like before? Every jab matters! every anti-vaxxer minds changed, we're 1 step closer ending pandemic :D  I'm EMT.

Our medical system full people hanging thread. going HARD well year now. can't sustain this.

At least one person died illness normally pretty trivial treat get bed ICU full unvaccinated covid patients.

I know think individuals totally responsible externalities suspect decision making, tell full it. Every person get vaxxed gets covid likely make lives us actually fighting thing little closer hell.

Also, breakthrough infections hardly ""just light headache/sore throat"" One EMT friends (40s, fit, vaccinated, triathlete, mountaineer) spent 10 days bed worst body aches he's ever felt getting breakthrough.

This PUBLIC health problem, suggestion solutions private implausible face. Please stop.

If stop, never tell anyone much support nurses, paramedics, EMTs... thing support us end thing. way end vaccinations. many selfish ill informed idiots count people right thing end escalate. get participate society unwilling protect society. Yeah, day first shot couldn’t raise arm shoulder height. Second shot, eh, knocked 36 hours, don’t remember. Worth it! lot people pro-vax anti-mandates like sort decisions

bullshit - every sane person loved taste normal starting happen USA Spring 2021; damn anti-vaxers refused vaccine are, Oct 2021 what? 40? America anti-vaxers. -only- way get NATION safe Mandates

you like rules? ok pretend doctor perform open-heart surgery you? ok get rolled room surgery medical folks wearing street clothes wearing PPE Masks gloves - complain? freedom , right? So…. Freedom choice doesn’t matter anymore? protect health getting vaccinated… Holiday Wave caused politics, though. *mostly* result people deciding they'd still visit families holidays. That's followed timeline did, starting get worse December initial Thanksgiving deaths started, peaking month Christmas (when deaths tend peak following event-driven wave). 

You're right Delta, deaths 2021 firmly people got 2020 holiday season visiting family, refusing get vaccine wear masks. printed QR code without name could fit wallet thinking would sufficient wasn't. name date doses encoded QR code, work unless QR code reader supports smart health card format. I'm thinking random piece paper name random QR code, would accept regardless fake not. whole point QR code people can't fake easily. Hey miss going concerts, sporting events, restaurants, strip clubs etc ?

I wish worked, USA, many people convinced vaccine rules enforced workers events/restaurants, etc., anti-vaxxers afraid missing events. 

The sad thing is, they're probably right too. It’s problem future me. Present finds delightful. problem started trying help people telling proper dosage, anti-vaxxers would try spin hospitals trying make under-dose die way. theyd start OD'ing even try prove point.

Maybe Good you, yikes. Kaiser want seen medical practitioner doesn’t believe medical science. personal choice.

bullshit, right personal choice ends health.

You every right simply stay home never leave - problem. moment leave, impact (and Millions others) Years ago, US Congressman put forth bill change value Pi 3 (fully serious) honestly feel bad staff hospital deal this. See lot smallpox cases around days, ya? think internet people type R0 simplicity. 
 
Sure, typing """"r-zero"" ""r-sub-zero"" ""r-sub-naught"" bring search results, ""r-naught"" brings plenty. r0. efficacy pretty bad end game now?  hermit seen another person years  end game now? Yup! like they’re gonna able get cops enforce 🤣 Hmm it’s common knowledge vaccine still get disease it’s fighting against. time make symptoms mild noticeable, times may work well all. Also immune response vaccine generally good sign immune system it’s job. mild case, still say worked well. Hmm it’s common knowledge vaccine still get disease it’s fighting against. time make symptoms mild noticeable, times may work well all. mild case, still say worked well. every post see someone's horrible long term effects, probably thousands people got covid point last 2 years never even knew it. disease mild without long effects overwhelming majority people, virus spread mind-boggling number people world rare severe cases actually add large number anecdotes. 

The long term issues 100% real also affecting tiny percentage actual infections. swear he's best person ever best actor How? major religion denomination outright bans vaccines? 

Mainstream Christianity sure not, unless take unusual fringe interpretation. religion? mainstream religion right prevents vaccinations. It’s BS argument exemption idiots use get vaccinated. really religious reasons regarding fetal cell line use, can’t use Tylenol, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine 100 common medications. Giancarlo anti-vaxxers: EXPLAIN know antivaxxx annoyingly stupid even powerful villain stand favor health civility. religion? mainstream religion right prevents vaccinations. It’s BS argument exemption idiots use get vaccinated. really religious reasons regarding fetal cell line use, can’t use Tylenol, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine 100 common medications. Quite unfortunate large section US society decided throw away lives. doubt COVID lethal flu, comparing 2020/2021 data really tell full story.

You see early 2020 (before COVID), many 651 deaths/week. 

I think it'd interesting compare typical year flu vs COVID. COVID would still far outpace flu cases, I'd wager hit threshold immunity (natural + vaccines), weekly deaths much closer flu.  sinovac might it, actually. supposedly little side effects. think mask better getting thing spreading enclosed area vax better avoiding getting seriously sick infected. I’m expert, 2 cents.  stop whining get vaccinated baby Ya 8 them...

Can't even staff single day shift ICU  Shit. Shit.  Gus may drug lord cares public health. God I’d love see video ranting anti-Vaxxers. wouldn’t want make Giancarlo mad.

Altered - anyone modified pre birth

Naturals- anyone modified pre birth

This based idea presented modifications mandated government help improve overall health population modifications improve things greatly (basically making Captain America womb) (Can't see reason government want citizens combat ready whether growth country deterrent another country making super babies).

I suggested natural person could considered second class citizen based world modifications done. second class perception would start based basic differences 2 groups, lets say modifications pre birth improve overall health also improve things like overall ability stronger faster retaining youth longer etc. Basically terms workforce altered person would advantages thus valued higher time goes since would seen overall better person hire choose natural altered.

this easily seen todays society decades degree based jobs seen superior (law, medical) skill based (electrician, plumber) however seems trend showing skill based jobs catching pay well providing happiness workers.

As reason feel doctors world would considered lower profession even though people still get hurt technology fix things would likely exist accessible altered families would means pay it. Doctors would still exist care could afford advance treatment thus time profession would associated poor thus diminished status. period would medical professionals still however would tasked running advanced facilities focused altering new embryos little contact people.

As religion feel like today would people would refuse using religion, example Jehova's witnesses take blood others themselves. could see religious movement stating altering body damages corrupts soul goes god unnatural. though could also religion worships alterations means become closer God thru continued approached perfection.

There’s 10.6 million doses Pfizer 79 cases myocarditis, 1.8 million doses Moderna 40 cases myocarditis. would expect cases myocarditis Pfizer larger cohort, it’s case - therefore blame IV injections.

I mean theres evidence IV injections would cause humans. boos told get *yet* recently finished chemo. I'm sure reasoning behind was, got anyway. mind, benefits outweighed risks. Thank you! read pass along. think Mars thing real? “I realize married... answer, think pretty clear Moderna's 100 mcg dose given males 30 Pfizer offering 30 soon 10 mcg dose.

Now moving goalposts making shit up.

People still smoke indoors. Second hand smoke still real issue.

Smoking kids car illegal 17 states next impossible enforce. laws im aware prevent smoking home. still 22 states anti smoking laws all. Yeah understand logic behind vaccinating people GBS. cases caused viruses like flu anyway, riskier get vaccinated? Delaying time best. Many countries wait 90 days, there's research showing immune system continues refine response around 6 months.

There safety concerns though. need get second dose make sure fully recovered first. Holy crap.

In mid feb travelled Seattle mixing densely packed Boston areas got home. mild cough wheezing distinctly remember complaining lack salt food last restaurant ate pre covid.

AFAIK recurrence really rare anyway. wonder like actual hermit. literally interact one, ever. honestly cannot imagine it. Another headline really helpful guide content article.   that’s number dude. real reason would directly cause ""covid parties"" and, therefore, directly cause deaths. also benefit exception, previous infection vaccinated. point former (but latter) change. 

Get vaccinated. Much smaller China lower rate new cases states made illegal smoke inside businesses public buildings (In fact lot states bans 25 feet away entrance even outside) combat issue secondhand smoke.   lmfao Haha sinister hee hee numbers hard numbers.. don’t much “per capita”. Sure, there’s people available die, doesn’t really change message CoVid ranks 2nd-3rd “single event” deaths US history (edit.. might #1.. didn’t know that).

Like one would really say shouldn’t compare WW2 deaths civil war deaths people 1945. Maybe would make hard hitting say.. 2.5% US population killed civil war vs 0.3-4% WW2.. death still counts.

I get point, don’t think applies what’s said. 3,000 deaths isn’t really huge number compared 300million population, they’re killed 1 hour 9/11 population doesn’t really matter.   Go back school. subject. analogy still full shit.

BACKGROUND 
Reports suggested association development myocarditis receipt messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), frequency severity myocarditis vaccination extensively explored. 
 
METHODS 
We searched database Clalit Health Services, largest health care organization (HCO) Israel, diagnoses myocarditis patients received least one dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer–BioNTech). diagnosis myocarditis adjudicated cardiologists using case definition used Centers Disease Control Prevention. abstracted presentation, clinical course, outcome patient’s electronic health record. performed Kaplan–Meier analysis incidence myocarditis 42 days first vaccine dose. 
 
RESULTS 
Among 2.5 million vaccinated HCO members 16 years age older, 54 cases met criteria myocarditis. estimated incidence per 100,000 persons received least one dose vaccine 2.13 cases (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 1.56 2.70). highest incidence myocarditis (10.69 cases per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 6.93 14.46) reported male patients ages 16 29 years. total 76% cases myocarditis described mild 22% intermediate; 1 case associated cardiogenic shock. median follow-up 83 days onset myocarditis, 1 patient readmitted hospital, 1 died unknown cause discharge. 14 patients left ventricular dysfunction echocardiography admission, 10 still dysfunction time hospital discharge. patients, 5 underwent subsequent testing revealed normal heart function. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
Among patients large Israeli health care system received least one dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, estimated incidence myocarditis 2.13 cases per 100,000 persons; highest incidence among male patients ages 16 29 years. cases myocarditis mild moderate severity.

It’s actually ironic linked study again. Maybe didn’t read close enough first time (or realistically I’m qualified read draw conclusions) actually seem providing exact data want see.

That study compared individuals previous infection remained unvaxed individuals previous infection vaxed concluded unvaxed 2x higher rate reinfection.

It’s literally first paragraph states clearly (emphasis mine):

“In today’s MMWR, study COVID-19 infections Kentucky among people previously infected SAR-CoV-2 shows **unvaccinated individuals twice likely reinfected COVID-19 fully vaccinated initially contracting virus**. data indicate COVID-19 vaccines offer better protection natural immunity alone vaccines, even prior infection, help prevent reinfections.”

I’m sure mean by:

“Surely evidence ALONE vaccination ALONE gave higher protection previous infection ALONE would released report …”

That’s study demonstrating no? It’s comparing natural antibodies natural antibodies plus vaccination concluding vax offers better protection nearly double don’t know evidence want.

And sorry trusting experts without pouring data wouldn’t understand anyway isn’t disservice. Grasping straws dismissing expert advice favor uneducated conclusions disservice.

You want health insurance don’t vaccine? Sure, cost going N% 

You got covid need go hospital? Sure. Part treatment plan require you
getting vaccinated possible.  Wow, that's though. tough; I'd almost try getting vaccine pass 12yo. Ooof... best chat pediatrician? yet school still feels like it’s first months everything hit fan. Masks day long, classes eating lunch room, kids separate zones recess, specials teachers coming home rooms teach there. It’s draining. never mean we're Science

You seem paying attention it. currently mass fatality events going every state every day. hundreds school shootings every single day US would expect kind overreaction.

I'm even okay wearing masks class, legit can't guests inside dorm, even attend school. parents, pay housing, even allowed building pay for. spite fact like 98% vaccinated system easily shows one's vaccine status.

Several coworkers granted BS exemption. one employee got vaccine still quit want mad people less religious got exemption. lot fun. raw data though, right? practices aggregate data analysis decision making based that? daughter doctor. can't indoor activities like going university, schools, clubs, bars, etc without vaxxed tested recently Germany.

Bc this, basically consider everyone around vaxxed tested, leads freedom.

Also new study found tracked vaccinations wrong. Actually vaxxing rate Germany sits 84% adults. sister cavalier family CHOSE get vaccinated, CHOSE exclude family gatherings. 1 year old, asthmatic, 91 year old. worth it.  example sort thing thought figured *before* disease outbreak could lay us low. kind thought pandemic happened powers would go relatively effortless *pandemic mode* would cooperate. fuss, confusion, yeah maybe bugs would need worked out, on-going confusion contention almost 2 years. 

I watched unfold amazement actually get seriously pissed signs started appearing stores said something effect 'if vaccinated, wear masks, unvaccinated, wear them'. good Ugh. hate “living fear” comment I’ve heard many times. refer “common sense” “caring others.” needed giggle mRNA vaccines even use cell lines manufacturing though. used safety testing made. Virtually drug interacts cellular level gets tested HEK293 cells. 

Also, article old almost irrelevant. even mention mRNA. That’s great. He’ll forgive he’s wise everyone says he’ll understand would trouble believing something ridiculous.    Yesterday foreman meeting everyone crew vaccine mandate. ~20 people shift, 5 others vaccinated. half rest crew stated going claim religious medical exemption attempt get it. 3 shifts job two roommates one friend work site stated overwhelming majority people yard end talks strike.

The stubbornness people astounding can't life figure almost everyone work could pigheaded vaccine. Spot on. Even people see data risk kids vs adults vs seniors, hard time applying truly understanding knowledge.  state meat plants testing nobody ever heard positives   Question (a rhetorical question, really) unvaccinated parents: really want risk child go shit? would legit medical reason get it? also show water wet? Yeah live United States  finally got aunt uncle get jab. homeless year finally found jobs. job said need vaccine they’re fired. begrudgingly got jab super convinced going die it, even told parents take care stuff pass. It’s amazing people bamboozled believing im sure managment care, whole county pretty anti-mask, anti-covid. ""freedom rallies"" time.

and yes, hate haha HEPA filters, electrostatic.

If filter cartridge replace every months, work. refused vaccines guarantee working healthcare begin with. mandates field, that's thread referenced. think might getting confused thinking vaccines either 100% preventing 100% preventing infection.

Note article quote, Dr. Spencer says ""vaccinated people *far less likely* coronavirus"" (my emphasis) ""vaccinated people *can't* coronavirus"". (I think know certain exactly *how* far less likely, certainly enough make difference.) He's actually disagreeing expert referring to.

I like analogy Spencer gives probabilities work Among unvaccinated, virus travels unhindered highway multiple off-ramps refueling stations. vaccinated, gets lost maze dead-end streets cul-de-sacs. Every often, pieces together escape route, scenarios, finds cut off, journey ends. go further.

He also mention Provincetown outbreak last outbreak Provincetown, Massachusetts—in 74 percent 469 cases fully vaccinated—forced CDC update mask guidance issue sad sobering warning: Vaccinated people infected SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant [just unvaccinated people.

If interested, Week Virology back August; commenters opinion CDC wrong declaring Delta variant ""more contagious"" vaccinated people necessarily ""just contagious"" unvaccinated. (However, probably prudent CDC say evidence everybody going back wearing masks.) jaded often Covid supposedly generally think prepared thing, unprepared however is... politics people countries identity becomes tied two party system. ridiculous. Australia mandated aged care workers despite noise 20-30% would quit first nursing homes would run staff etc ended 99.3% vax rate group. Nope, Christian Science case said, ""Think community; you, individual."" Even getting help denomination. I’ve looked parent young children - better understand risks. found:

This isn’t study rather summary publicly reported data child cases since reporting began current outcomes. It’s American Academy Pediatrics Children’s Hospital Association. summary, data 30/9/21:

Since reporting began (up 30/9/21) 5,899,148 children tested positive US. 

Of reported cases:

Up 30/9/21, 520 died (88 per million), 0.009% total child cases

Up 30/9/21, 22,429 hospitalised (3,802 per million), 0.380% total child cases

Obviously results aren’t complete 5M+ cases recovered deaths hospitalisations end higher currently reported, still shows low risk children. 

What data doesn’t show:
- age breakdown
- treatments interventions used
- underlying conditions (if any) children had
- sick hospitalised children (moderate vs severe) irks single-handedly created lot conditions try use justification belief. example lot employers businesses created incentives people get shot due antivaxxers. antivaxxers audacity say “if vaccine safe, people paid take it?! Wake up!!” It’s you, dumb fuck!! Yes. correct believe saw 7 fold increase age group 30, don’t take word however still new information FHM.

I believe wouldn’t withdraw use people age 30 wasn’t numbers backing up. wait see release report, reveal extremely rare.

It’s unfortunate situation quite us Sweden we’re allowed second dose moderna yet announce alternative, could take weeks.  work described here. pcp point see copy card, entrenched record. unsure would verify card. One study? Pretty sure 10% reduction wearing masks prevents 10% infections population. least numbers Germany. Everywhere roughly 10% reduction masks became mandatory. states 1 week late one city one month early. 

And restrictions introduced time.

And 10% infections pretty nice. nearly effective closing schools. Wow!

Ten percent causing three quarters admissions :( Speaks much probably accomplished mitigation (closures, mask mandates social distancing). Without vaccine, fewer people died. 

I realize delta variant part equation though, mitigation can't take credit, means. issue going handled way new york. Vax card required barely even check card letting in, theres exception people cant get vaccine doctors note. Phew, thank god don’t find alcohol use problem. Pretty sure US information completely voluntary. PCP asks you. Nothing actually verified. Orange higher percentage vaxxed LA county already. vs. 61.3% don’t think ppl vaxd care asked proof. don’t. fact like wherever I’m going asks. he'll call another election? According data, myocarditis aboutn
 3 times likely Moderna. mean, sure go Pfizer knowing this, 3 times rare incidence = still rare incidende.
You 7.5 cases Myocarditis per million Pfizer and

22.2 cases Myocarditis per million Moderna.

Rounding , 0.0008% chance Pfizer 0.002% chance Moderna.

It would good know whether ratio stands affected cases too. example, young males, Moderna might causing 6-7 times myocarditis Pfizer. 90% adults fully vaccinated. Delta happened. hope currently testing immunity boost people vaccinated got breakthrough infection?  

This recently happened me, fully vaccinated Pfizer April. booster come available me, would like know necessary someone like get it. 10% adult population make three quarters hospitalisations. depends original % is. risk 0.01% vaccine 6x 0.06% big difference (1/10,000 vs 6/10,000). risk 10% vaccine 6x 60% thats really big difference (1000/10,000 vs 6000/10,000). Thats statistics like 6x; 20x; 500x misleading, need put context.   tax dollars $$$ Nothing dumb free. pulls stunts everyone (in Idaho) ends paying it... you, random Redditor, better hospitals assessing vaccine risks health? guarantee worse reaction Covid.

I scared get vaccine too!, effects felt awful bit, instant peace mind came worth it. Maybe would go that? (I've given up, antivaxxer relative) Ah yes, believe you. Hesitant fine. taking vaccine not. point vaccine given *huge* number people negligible unknown side effects.

Long term side effects known, there's also long-term studies COVID infection. Initial impressions substantial long-term effects infection large percentage cases.

Long term side effects vaccines class medication almost none. Side effects immunization happen time scale weeks. vaccine destroyed body timeframe weeks. There's long term effects body prior vaccination, except new immune system memories make fighting COVID faster effective.   feel 100 percent. can't help someone want helped. hope wants get help one day. Good luck. ❤  brain worms sir  interesting! cross post “data beautiful” sub. LA county city? 75% unvaccinated hospitalized percentage unvaccinated country?

Time lower expectations people :) also find ""semi-casual"" mask use skyrocketing. used see people leave grocery store, load car, get car, close door, remove masks. see people pulling masks they're walking door.

I personally see anything wrong since cases region low falling vaccination rates high, clearly demonstrates large continuum masking exists on. Also, still find absolutely mind-blowing deaths masking distancing stay-at-home measures place much country. deaths vaccine roll-out middle. deaths us everything capable time (in spite passive neglect actual active pushback leadership time non-trivial amount population now).

I personally looked enough data say totally justified, think totally unrealistic.   problem ... What, exactly? Thanks!  MD doesn’t make expert infectious disease. It’s that.

If want see looks like, it’s right Good!! Fuck medical professionals don’t believe medicine. good thing getting ass hats out. Don’t worry even vaccinated people die waiting organs. go get vaccinated moron. fully vaccinated 2 shots? 3 shots? earth figure out! Look it’s simple this. it’s cold outside put coat. also wear hat even warmer. Natural immunity fine. Getting vax like adding hat. Maybe it’s small bonus previously affected it’s better nothing.

I’ve still yet see compelling reason vaccine different we’ve mandated get requirement participate areas society. Worst case nothing (even though mounds evidence espouse benefits; even already natural immunity) best case prevents getting sick possibly dying.

We need reduce reproduction virus cut mutations. Otherwise we’ll keep cycle forever. 

One measure alone hasn’t won’t ever successful. isn’t opinion. It’s math. compound strategies while.

Once virus gets low enough eventually pose mathematical risk.

But keep trying help along leaving enough opportunity, take it. That’s viruses do. replicate roll genetic dice many times can.

We could ended spring everyone vaccinated asked continued wear mask… 5% population both. another 50% vaccinated alone 45% nothing.

That’s enough virus thrive… productive summer. Pointlessly. Even worse 2020 technically.

I’m really sure many people seemingly treating Covid-19 like endangered species want protect. treated Rhinos way world would better place.  Poor folks enforce this. 2 places required enforce vaccine.

The virus replicates quickly, lives animal reservoirs, ALWAYS generate third world matter we're here. Delta generated India, made months. another variant means. Luckily newer variants simply can't compete Delta, hopefully holds.

Not think flu, come on. Eating unventilated place around people opening mouth... exactly is. driving car. cant wear mask eating. room strangers know nothing about. understand wanting best family, however, whole point vaccine reduce severe disease, hospitalization death, effective thus far. vaccine distribution better spent giving many people possible opposed using boosters haven’t proven necessary individuals 65 Covid still likely cause myocarditis Moderna vaccination, even young age groups. risk waiting little bit longer vaccinating second dose lower risk vaccine period low transmission ultimately net positive public health.

The prevalence post-infection myocarditis found college athletes staggering:


*Question prevalence myocarditis competitive athletes COVID-19 infection, would different approaches screening affect detection?*

*Findings cohort study 1597 US competitive collegiate athletes undergoing comprehensive cardiovascular testing, prevalence clinical myocarditis based symptom-based screening strategy 0.31%. Screening cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging increased prevalence clinical subclinical myocarditis factor 7.4 2.3%*  club patrons 21 vaccine cards, match fake ID.

Of course would enforce checking vaccine status. Every time drive car chance get accident. still drive take reasonable precautions like wearing seatbelt, car insurance, getting drunk paying close attention. Risk can’t avoided entirely mitigated. go eat typically I’m within 6 feet diners even I’m inside staff usually wearing masks. I’m high vaccinated community also good chance staff also vaccinated.

Yes small chance get Covid another vaccinated person even though I’m vaxxed pretty rare it’s worth risk. Maybe lived community almost one vaccinated would avoid eating life balancing risks. Right pandemic unvaccinated taking reasonable precautions like getting vaccinated lower risks still enjoy life. seems like would really hard link two. could simple “typically people drug alcohol problems also give less shit social distancing because… well go bars socially drink outside immediate living space.”
 Combine alcohol immune suppressant really isn’t surprising me. Sorry hear bit rough ride. funny vaccine--I side effects Pfizer1, minor moderate 2, minor 3. Hoping 5, it'll huge nothing ;) “Getting vaccinated personal choice whatever want don’t get shot literally won’t let inside” 

Sure. got vaccinated without hesitation think unvaccinated selfish, outrageous. Misinformed ignorant people still people deserve basic freedoms. That’s vague one get still say something. Like, drugs bad m’kay. Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin hope feel better soon. flu effective killer, especially considering people gotten annual booster yet. think flu (and know did--it unlike cold), treat exactly would covid. Isolate much possible, mask can't maintain social distancing minimize touch (flu definitely spreads surface contamination), wash hands frequently. two weeks. flu minor ailment. Indeed, perhaps one alcohol withdrawal patient full DT thought everything fire, I’ve never seen patients panicked feel like can’t breathe. 

I actually said something similar husband, “without husband around anti-ventilator convictions might strong”. may right coming variants, cycle going forever. course, eradication corona preferred outcome, quite likely virus become endemic instead.

In general pandemics: higher immunity population = lower impact virus. also applies variants even escape immunity degree. Escaping immunity 100% extremely unlikely happen. 

The good thing build immunity without direct contact virus days. lucky live scientific advancements. first question good question, something get answer soon. Eventually everyone get “breakthrough” infection, it’s important know protection vaccination severe disease confers protection risk post infection myocarditis.

The second question, pretty clear data prevalence post infection myocarditis young people. Symptomatic myocarditis found 1 300 college athletes greater 1 50 adding asymptomatic myocarditis risk symptomatic myocarditis Vaccination 20x 80x lower Moderna Pfizer, respectively. risk catching coco would lower 5% Moderna 1.2% Pfizer. Given rate spread, better risk reduction vaccinating young. given luxury choosing 2 mRNA vaccines, made good decision reduce overall risk. Bingo. Plenty people need lung transplants ex-smokers. way doctor going risk transplanting lung someone *still* actively smokes. required absolutely indoor dining. Maybe intentionally sitting outside? Yet Jersey, mask mandate outside schools medical facilities, we've never gotten point typically mandate-happy governor reinstated masks universally. case rates begun plummet. Why, almost let air balloon little bit time allow exposure, unvaccinated people catch either recover die--which, like not, best way dense state lot people refuse vaccination. consider approach successful. mean sound callous say ""recover die"" honestly consequence they've seemed worthy risk. data great, already tested shown low risk. Yeah came say this. deemed high-risk case, chances receiving extreme intervention like organ transplant considerably lower. resource-intensive process high demand organs, doctors admin staff going take chance someone proven can't follow self-care regimen. irresponsible, failure comply medical instructions *after* receiving donor organ worsen outcomes patient well. Yes, wonder anti-vax folks taking time away contrail fetish? Hmm Palm Springs mid September saw requirements. city wide thing certain places? agree, employee wants enforcer vaccine mandates…especially minimum wages. Thank response.  find interesting natural antibodies given enough credit 

Enough credit, based *what?* 

Re-infection rates low, still early numbers likely go up. known low, still possible, early studies showing vaccination reduces chances further. also know re-infected individuals carry much higher viral load without showing symptoms. words, could people showing reports re-infected, despite fact they, they're spreading virus high easy jump wagon alleged certainty officials.

Or maybe realizing know shit-all subject worth listening people studied subject many years, conducted actual research field many more, published findings peer pretty sure studies showed incredible efficacy Thalidomide.

I'm sorry, though talking vaccine \~6.5 BILLION doses administered world-wide trivial reports significant adverse reactions despite massive scrutiny organizations agencies around world.

Thalidomide hand drug used thousands pregnant women despite never tested strictly controlled use conditions 1957 data show chemicals used drug could pass mother fetus.

We know ingredients Covid vaccines safe, even fetuses. They've used vaccines long time now. 

Drugs like Thalidomide used morning sickness 1950s along medical practices medieval times rigorous thorough testing today. data compare safety vaccine infection rates tell guess.

It already has. want listen. equal application law works. Honestly last FDA meeting Pfizer boosters didn’t really inspire lot confidence. gist got worried global vaccine equity, trying discourage vaccine hesitant, focused much hospitalized cases instead breakthrough infections. Valid concerns but, realize might sound selfish, want what’s best family. FDA decision felt politically motivated. obsession masks isnt health. Go live life. takes one weirdo restaurant that's carrying it. Every time eat enclosed area roll chance. Thanks helpful. viruses spread way.

It really cancel out. Doubling R0 far, far worse. Remember, 2X also part exponential growth -- [still grains wheat 2^n every square -- whereas vaccination much linear. exponential beat linear. R subscript zero. common, least math physics, pronounce subscript 0 ""naught,"" ""r-zero"" ""r-sub-zero"" ""r-sub-naught"" would also correct.

Agreed Australia, NSW. ""freedoms"" vaccinated. 1% quite bit difference even even split deaths. Population totals states large enough 1% state's population means small number. even split case scenario may affect proportion votes much, hits right people (politically active, donor, advocate, etc) one death potential lose political party death someone politically apathetic. 

In 100:0 scenario, would massive hit even 1% dead aforementioned reasons, difference grows one side, scenario, lost *anything* potential fundraising, persons vote, people run political machines. 

It gets even concerning political party situation similar Republican party finds in: simple fact popular vote presidency *only twice* past 32 years (Bush SR. 2nd term GWB) losses suffer likely voters eats margins deeper someone working clearer majority. Voter laws make outcome fuzzy end day less people turn vote that's never good thing potentially disastrous capture less people begin with.

Staffing ratios would almost certainly worse lower occupancy due 135,000 COVID-19 fatalities nursing homes higher-than-normal deaths causes.  guy knows shit. work public health?  Let’s say got 1000 people. 

Of group, vaccinated not, 900 probably won’t end hospital. 

Of remaining 100, vaccinated, 10 probably end hospital. unvaccinated, they’d probably end hospital didn’t get vaccines next layer protection care aides spreading Covid vulnerable patients, patients could potentially creat shortage talking historical precedence authenticity...not political claims. Anyone claim reason really.  Good say, many medical products. claimants would ""sincerely held belief"" test fall apart actually defend it. 

Per Cells derived elective abortions used since 1960s manufacture vaccines, including current vaccines rubella, chickenpox, hepatitis A, shingles. also used make approved drugs diseases including hemophilia, rheumatoid arthritis, cystic fibrosis.  I've ordered mask bonefidemasks.con, specifically powecom kn95. fda authorized (not anymore supply back) I've worn inside everywhere. 

But make kids size! brand, fit 6 year old well. We're lucky keep school shots, nice case.

I'm affiliated anything, they've solid since first ordered last October. way specify organ donor want donation go plague rat. need study show painfully obvious? It’s rather alarming “counterfeit” cures try mirror reality folding back itself. example, claiming something like Ivermectin actually works reason discredited favor faulty vaccine, portray accuse others efforts making vaccines. 

Makes wonder whether foundational intent malicious merely result faulty wiring. Yes... that's ...""lifesaving"" means.

That's literally point vaccines.

Why keep seeing stories ""x person forced take vaccine""?

We 'force' anyone making life saving decisions, human beings occasionally irrational, forcing people save large part prevent death.

We things society values human life personal preference. wrong folks?  kid going? Daycare? Family members? Wherever they're going closed system enforce testing vaccine mandates. Beyond stay home 2 extra months takes approved. 

Get real. surprised...What world people living in. True medical exemptions necessary. instance, oldest son Syndrome vaccines kind due severe epilepsy. He's 30. But, lives vaccinated. wish could vaccinated, neuro says no. Donor organs go people take care precious rarity. running npc dialogs see happens. kids, lower dosage arguably preferable due higher dosages possibly leading side effects kids + kids’ immune system already pretty effective Covid without vaccine. besides, Moderna vaccine kids would lower dosage well. I'm moron fatigue. I'm exhausted living country one gives f anyone else, hence #1 covid deaths country world Shame doesn’t work. would really useful medicine proven protect COVID 19  submitted initial data EUA request kids 10 days drug makers Pfizer BioNTech said July partnered Biovac, public-private partnership pharmaceutical company Cape Town. Gqeberha, South African coastal city formerly known Port Elizabeth, Johnson &amp; Johnson partnered Aspen, local manufacturer, fill-and-finish manufacturing process.


I think partnerships bring benefits sooner inauguration Moderna's facility. amazed quickly nonchalantly studies waved away conspiracy theories ""big pharma"". Study shows effective? Big pharma Fauci it. live kind universe, there's amount evidence prove something false want true. are. Get vaccinated. road normal. Good.  We’re tired this. Forcing vaccinated wear masks endlessly isn’t anything help people get vaccinated.

If that’s goal, require vaccines everywhere masks. Punishment reward. Yes I'm aware. dialysis 1.5 years. CPR analogy really work though. really news. Transplant patients always date vaccines. course Covid vaccine would added list. lady knowing make story.  life saving vaccine, free, free booster.  only. Maybe prays religion bless sort way provide. unprecedented advance humanity never seen seems like much ask though. would call miracle. Surely religion would provide humanity hardship deliver us pandemic would eagerly received! Life, children, it’s shot away  Antivaxers zero reason believe prioritized people listen doctors comes organ transplants. Let's put another way.

In current covid climate, stands higher chance dying getting transplant vaccinated getting transplant (and still vaccinated).

With kidney transplant, risk death covid unvaccinated rises 30%. guess obvious.

If supply goes then... uh... supply goes down. ok, deleting ftfy :) covid bankrupted it....  Wait learns side effects kidney failure. Ehhhhh... I'd much rather living hypocrite. right life, endangers lives surgeons nurses required preserve hers.

The fact ranting importance life willing risk dozens others tells everything need know woman. think everyone mask fatigue now, people selfish.  know, mean “religious exemption” isn’t thing w organ transplant. need get vaccinated, need take medications. can’t bc “religion”, don’t get transplant. 

Not matters, bc lady full shit.   Right? People miss 1% work sick flu get big deal. Yeah, get vaccine die.. hard. Professor Racaniello says, normal pretty much every vaccine.

For non-COVID example, check CDC's polio *caused* old-school attenuated-virus Oral Polio Vaccine. people vaccinated get sick, there's one-in-a-million chance attenuated viruses revert back able cause polio others around them. (Note cases US CDC aware people either unvaccinated compromised immune systems.)

However, also important note infection generally last long vaccinated, generally also less able transmit people period infection (many viruses effectively spread disease symptoms like coughing sneezing). Think like dumping [fire part forest wildfire burns it.

If interested learning more, watch Racaniello's [video lecture last March virology class medical students Columbia U. He's also got [livestreamed lecture series (with audience Q&amp;A) recently started up, wait weeks updated lecture vaccines. Personal autonomy mean owe job -- especially going endanger others.  free leave position like.  even personal autonomy, mean need make bad decisions prove it. 

p.s. that's Dr. Philosopher, buddy. IT’S MELT!!! many ""mask fatigue"" unvaccinated care consequences horrible decisions? **forced** shit.

She want deal consequences, like every person refuses get vaccinated wear mask. knowledge denomination come vaccine. Someone tell I'm wrong though. feel, look. /s  exactly organs spare people extra high chance death. case blocking it’s friend donating kidney. Hoping someone dies dont want vaccine 99% survival rate. 

Post transplant, she'd cocktail immunosuppressive drugs. Apparently understand transplants work.   Trump/pence? easy say, writing, publishing getting peer reviewed study shows sky blue entirely different saying it. Same. things might get better point. ok? imagine great would free took less 5 minutes...  transplant isn’t imminent. don’t get transplanted meet pre transplant criteria, isn’t meeting. back dialysis. isn’t heart liver transplant emergent necessity transplant die.

Transplants withheld non-adherent patients time. isn’t really news. Same! Although I'm sure we'll still think vax every step improvement concern vaccine-induced myocarditis young people? Exactly. can't sue Walmart, Amazon, etc. federal mandate, take vetted policy court. really sensible medical position take, especially organ transplant. even mean this? trials, don’t think they’ve even filed EUA 12-18 yet, wouldn’t expect 5-11 several months yet. Yeah long covid / brain fog / lung damage main reason want avoid covid got vaccine ASAP can't wait til kids get theirs. Obv hospitalization / death issues too, unknown long term effects *even asymptotic* people really frightening anti-vax people dismiss talking about. She’s scared idea vaccines someone else’s organs body? -_- Yes definitely rare. Still may common one million, since someone knows allergy component vaccine may even gotten first dose; CDC also lists contradiction [having severe allergic reaction component  Somehow conversial person. right points he’s also doomsday caller. mean get we’ll wait 75-80% full vaccinated it’s still isn’t enough him. mean kudos standing says believes... personally agree slightest, least die hypocrite. Haha Well, kidney transplant absolutely improves survival compared dialysis, way life saving. gave guy CPR lived another 5 years dying heart attack, doesn’t mean didn’t save life.

But yes, life expectancy still shorter somebody w healthy kidney function, still requires medications. call treatment, cure. Literally talk. thinks looks tough talking moving workplaces vaccine lol... likely wherever relocates require vaccination new hires eventually. People going quit full-time jobs pick cross stitching something. workplace mandate exactly I've waiting watch people put money mouth is. would tell quit live homeless person going get way line work. Um how's stupid go outside want without fear covid? thus power mighty economic engine exporting hundreds millions vaccine doses?

And sure, vaccine resistant strain could come out, could even countries 40% vaccinated whatever. case, would take brief pause quickly retooling vaccines target new strain, shoot everyone up, carry before, exporting ever-greater amounts vaccine.

Nor immoral; simply wise allow tirelessly working manufacture distribute vaccines across world amount normality, prevent burning hence unable produce vaccine effectively before. case aren’t joking:  devils advocate here, found donor. like taking kidney away someone else. However, still much dangerous donor unvaccinated understand hospital would refuse.  1/3 volume.

To give rough example:
Let's say draw 100µl ±5µl precision. 5% variation dosage administered per study well within reasonable variation dosage. Scaling 1/3, drawing 1/3 smaller volume accuracy scale linearly. unlikely would able draw 33.3µL ±1.65µL precision. likely precision close previous ±5µL value. smaller dosage, becomes FAR higher percentage (±15.2%) individuals do? donate covax? unicef?   empathize frustration, reviewing hundreds pages clinical data formality, much needed step. hope miss step rush things sorry later. vaccines literally matter public health safety.

I understand people get this. 

There always certain population, albeit small, people cannot get vaccinated. Allergy vaccine ingredient, whatever. people whose immune systems compromised vaccine safe, reason can't risk exposure virus itself.

Further, there's *fact* viruses mutate. herein lies major problem. *unvaccinated* people drive risks mutations. mutations mean? mean viruses evolve a) resistant vaccine developed previous strain, b) contagious, c) lethal.

God help virus mutates lethal *and* vaccine resistant.

Again, unvaccinated people drive risk dangerous mutations. Due absence vaccine-derived antibodies already place, course virus unvaccinated body longer vaxxed person. longer course, greater likelihood mutation.

And that's deal reality medical care unvaccinated population. 

If hospital x number beds, beds fill Covid patients, fewer beds patients acute emergencies: someone heart attack, work injury, car accident, kid fell ladder landed something sharp dirty. People need *immediate* medical attention local hospitals resources beds taken people Covid likely *wouldn't* they'd gotten vaccine, almost certainly needed hospitalization get sick. even getting people need routine healthcare chronic conditions (cancer, diabetes, etc.)

So no, enough say ""get want, get don't."" Health professionals bullshitting insist vaccinating *everyone* *can* vaccinated real way protect people legitimately *can't* be, near-total vaccinated population real way guard *worse* pandemics. doesnt. doesnt make sense. life isnt important her. family’s lives arent important her. stubbornness absolute need righteous important her. Wait line medicine behind vaccinated people actually care others. 
 knows, maybe live learn. Anything possible guess. Thoughts prayers  solves problem rich people, someone money, fining really deterrent people.

The one common denominator people: Time

Community service punishes people equally, benefits society.   Yep, always think covid too. Even slightest sniffle. I'm ready peace mind get get seriously ill - especially lax morons state acting like pandemic over.  Doctors vaccinated. Good. exception real medical reason cannot get vaccinated even insurance company might deem reasonable. number Australia 47%. What's point? Wealthy countries ones paid developed them. course they’re going take care people first. remember first really exploding state. daily reports would say ""county x- 2 new cases. county y- 7 new cases. county z- 45 new cases."" ??? realized county z's major meat processing facilities. Local news reports make conclusion, seemed pretty clear. definitely huge factor.  vaccination rates Germany low, 73% adults 65% whole population vaccinated.



65% population may high enough please call low. Bulgaria 19.6% population (antivaxxers problem, mainly). dream reaching 65% population vaccinated. reason people use ""religious exemptions"" despite fact literally 3 religions something like say get vaccines...and 3 Catholics protestants sure 99.9% religious exemption people claim be.

It also retrospective cohort study interpreting data gathered elsewhere often lead biased outcomes one particular seems susceptible result.

It also weirdly defines “unvaccinated” someone didn’t get Phizer vax may received one others.

I’ll agree vaccine also fails confer 100% immunity shouldn’t used word guarantee. you’ve said, apt comparison *how* effective feel like we’ve covered already seems clear vaccine better I’ll agree studies natural immunity would benefit participants (though get points independently reproduced observational studies instead retrospective). also lines CDC recommendations I’m inclined trust results. might agree disagree one.

That BMJ article highly problematic references two studies we’ve already discussed including Israel study produced “13x likely” number one mentioned none unvaccinated participants contracted COVID 2nd time yet still concluded natural immunity nearly 100% effective.

I however read section highlighted I’m wondering read closely latched onto (almost assuredly context) quote Dr Ghandi end essentially contradicts entire section including conclusions. far tell Dr Ghandi pro-vax seems like misleading cherry-picked quote.

The actual conclusion section many “previously infected” self diagnosed don’t know they’ve really COVID “better safe sorry” approach recommended. robust protection people need combination vaccine natural immunity. It’s lot safer go vaccine natural infection try risk natural infection without vaccine.

Myocarditis risk approximately 10x higher getting COVID vaccine. wasn’t able confirm claims risk previously infected person article linked though it’s notable one vaccines tested AstraZeneca one known higher chance causing heart issues. study authors also paid Phizer.

Truth don’t know mycocarditis risk 2nd infection either even immunity. know natural COVID cause side effects vaccine much severe way stands reason reaction vax could manifest much worse reaction future COVID infection.

So Dr Lawlers first argument significant differences two groups due selection biases. researchers accounted by:
""These groups matched 1:1 ratio age, sex, GSA time first event. first event (the preliminary exposure) either time administration second dose vaccine time documented infection SARS-CoV-2 (a positive RT-PCR test result).

His second argument survivorship bias- include died first infection. relevant theoretical question ""what protection previous infection provide, somehow able measure protected dead people aswell"" 
It relevant asking ""how protected previously infected compared vaccinated?"" question needs asked creating policies allow certain rights vaccinated people, previously infected.

Have Dr Lawler's comments peer reviewed? biases affected judgment paper? take one analysis paper? 

Finally, CDC uses study, mean statistical importance large sample sizes longer exists. post study doesnt mean reliable. There's thousands valid studies CDC havent posted.

Take care! Stats like always misleading average ages involved different. see way. I'm LA still gone socially since pandemic began, might ordinance takes effect. I'll feel safer knowing everyone vaxed I'll likely patronize local establishments. country still smaller concerts vaccinated people (who show proof). four september.

Restaurants similar situation, enter show proof vaccination testing. alcoholic better ethical argument deserving organ ahead anti-vax person.

An alcoholic medical disorder, may consuming dangerous amounts alcohol even they're trying make good choices. may difficulty fighting triggers stressful situations may lead dangerous behaviors. There's convenient pill treatment makes alcoholism magically solved easy manage, practice better habits entire life.

An anti-vax person presumably disorder making difficult get vaccine. even did, they'd need two moments sobriety get vaccinations, they'd covered. fight disorder remain eligible, future anti-vax thoughts lead possibility somehow becoming un-vaccinated. Niceland  free dumb wants.  Also, Kyrie you’re reading this, know remote is? I’ve looking since last night can’t find it. AZ US. J&amp;J, Pfizer Moderna. friends bad break infection J&amp;J vaccine.  Yeah verification really bad everywhere right now. showed california QR code, rejected QR code reader -- want something name it. easy fake. Vaccination mandates meaningless enforcement bad.  Really sorry hear. mom died complications alcoholism something wish anyone. I'm hoping brother suffer fate. mean keep beating dead horse need booster six months flu shot year seems like big fail. 

That may downside vaccine, yes. future may new preventative measures place replace existing covid-19 vaccines. We're working here.

If need stop get vaccinated 3x year instead 1x year (Covid + Covid + Flu, vs Flu) that's big get 100% vaccination rate 100% people hospitalized Covid vaccinated

Yes. that's percentages work. Want know else percentages work?

Let's say there's population 200,000 people. 50% vaccinated, 50% aren't. vaccinated group, time 15 people hospital. unvaccinated group, time 300 hospitalized.

At given time, 95% hospitalized population unvaccinated 5% vaccinated.

Over time, 200,000 members population get vaccinated. means 300 members belonged unvaccinated group hospitalization gone, place 15 vaccinated people hospitalized.

As said, 100% hospitalized population vaccinated. amount people hospitalized? 30 vs 315, 9.5% original amount 5% population would vaccinations.

So hope see ""but 100% hospitalizations vaccinated!"" empty, stupid rebuttal.

Statistics vaxxed vs unvaxxed hospitalization Washington's Department Health report, 9/29/21 Read Dax Sheppards voice. I'd say trash, TX little petty political stunt trash. bet problem taking organs though contact trial ask that? assume data collection purposes, they'd rather take vaccines, least would want tell done so. understanding data Novavax least as, more, effective mRNA vaccines, additional vaccination probably worse gotten Pfizer/Moderna. Although, course, there's lot less data Novavax. Yes  Imagine foolish think boss friend, also good enough friend give organ lmao Hey miss going concerts, sporting events, restaurants, strip clubs etc ? statistics:
79 cases myocarditis Pfizer.

40 cases myocarditis Moderna.

10.6 million doses Pfizer 1.8 million doses Moderna. think cause could Moderna 3.3x stronger Pfizer (active ingredients). know, gets really confusing. Everything read far, though, seems put J&amp;J head pack. Like, us J&amp;J slightly less protected jump (85% vs. 94%), seems though protection waning compared mRNA vaccines might even better booster. like said, much really difficult tell. main concern FDA/CDC gonna bullshit like ""if past 6 month time frame, can't get booster."" added comfort, promising studies J&amp;J seem show protection increases time matter what. J&amp;J published one study said 2 months, booster 100% (!!!!) effective preventing death.  Glad see standing up.   Good  It’s not, may look Pfizer used widely.

As example, Sweden there’s 79 cases myocarditis Pfizer 40 cases myocarditis Moderna.

However, they’ve given 10.6 million Pfizer doses 1.8 million Moderna doses    Super anecdotal, folks live near OC met 3 separate families weekend bought/rented places TX FL mandates.

I feel states cause us left-coasters def aren’t sending best. relative anti vaccine pro mask He's maybe perfect illustratuon dunning kruger effect I've ever seen 12,000 people died US, masks, quarantines vaccines. 50x worse. They're comparable.  No, think saw 7 fold increase myocarditis cases compared Pfizer. think cause could moderna 3.3x stronger Pfizer, hence larger dose side effects. Gotcha. hope right. couldn’t tell read thing, sorry. There’s many articles slightly different wording wildly different numbers. can’t make heads tails truth one.

If find article quoting 30% delta jnj I’ll update NBA 95% vaccination rate. think it'll get 100 eventually, especially since players changed minds vaccine, like Andrew Wiggins Golden State Warriors.

But always people like Kyrie Irving matter say, living world.

The important part let one two people skew viewpoint NBA vaccinations. please note % vaccinated deaths versus unvaccinated deaths Also many worst outbreaks world. clean act expense poorer nations. 100% this. mandates placed country day one Biden's presidency, false information brigade would hard time mustering thier forces. Instead given months harden hearts thier followers, make religion getting shot. won’t let go skating??? understanding months ago seems like going drag longer

Hope I’m wrong Vaccines drugs. desperately need antiviral drugs another layer protection. main concern I've read many sources advising it, saying might better boosters soon, targeted toward new, emerging variants. 

Moderna developed booster tailored Beta (the B.1.351 South African variant) put limited testing. worked better variant original vaccine used booster, original used booster also worked well. never applied FDA approval it. original booster also works extremely well Delta, believe anyone working Delta specific booster. new variant emerges warrants specific booster, take time develop one, test it, get approval process. Bottom line: get booster ever variant-specific booster probably 6+ months away anyway assuming even needed. Thank key part religions believing mind/soul exist forever. thing dying flesh currently housing mind/soul. convince mind live forever, choices make consequences beyond existence current flesh occupy, probably pretty sure choices make, hypocrite. masking suppressed there’s sort resurgence people stopped wearing course since kid turns 12 2 weeks lol  thats need mandates. 

Everyone talks crazy job line, come times ante up, vast majority antivax crowd bend knee get shot. 

There hold outs, replaced. 

If think 'freedom' violated taking safe widely effective vaccine, likely liability workplace would better self employed.  ""B-b-but political!"" parents travel year. understand. Incoming howls outrage ""medical discrimination"" 5.... 4.... 3.... Thing is, tell someone less-vaccinated country, still follow restrictions, still fear COVID, think it? That's they'll ever need hear?

All things considered, matter emotional distress, inequality outcome, unfortunately is. likely source worldwide resentment while. Live it. Physical therapy one one via telehealth. might advantageous ask local catchment centre/practice precautions taken. Same! 2.5 year old baby sister due mid January. Hoping beyond hope least one shot then! Update: test negative. necessarily reassured considering circumstances, better positive result.  Hopefully us Canada start ease stuff aswell.

Immunity measured amount antibodies blood. carry permanent set antibodies blood every single thing resistance to. immunity matters cell memory cell immunity. Why? cells initiate process making antibodies new familiar infection detected. little bits misleading information reporting like keep egging anti-vaxxer mania. 3 years vaccinated. (Got June) talking people don’t want it.  hope, honestly think pressure younger kids. think bad Delta? Surely virus running people infect. It’s frustrating. 11 year-old, he’s 5’4, 130 lbs. Obviously, doesn’t qualify vaccine due age. He’s got friend 12 like 4’8 90 lbs, able get vaccinated months ago.

When/if gets approved 5-11 year-olds, wonder we’ll able get son adult dosage due physical size, we’ll stuck children’s dose. latter, don’t know waiting another 3 months turns 12 worth it. unvaccinated, at-risk sister convinced Ivermectin, prescribed doctor, protect Covid. ☹️  like week bad ""flu"" going come covid positive house help us dogs baby? No. going ask 65+ grandmother's come help? Absolutely not.

Considering money Moderna shareholders making now, especially given vaccine proven gold standard Delta wave, think could definitely happen. 

Such factory would definitely help African continent immensely, especially ending continent's historical dependence foreign medical aid. would help long term, long current pandemic over, build African base medical innovation. take long change concentration production. setting production getting materials beginning means majority work already done real drug already effective. Billions people taken vaccine. brain fog terrifies me. hope feel better soon, medicine finds way mend damage. waning days Delta days next variant. expect another December-surge countries celebrating Christmas. Maybe like Texas offer bounty people assist unvaccinated people going venues, people sell tickets, artist, venue itself. seems fair.  Generally, ""It's something live now"" argument response people thinking COVID-19 would eradicated ""simply followed directions."" may live COVID on

We will. always case. live pandemic people would take precautions.

That's wishful thinking. global virus. global population simultaneously quarantine get vaccinated. long there's transmission somewhere, we'll pandemic. Hopefully much longer increased vaccination rate natural immunity. middling stretch COVID timeline, molnupiravir might able stake limited territory. drug meant taken within first five days illness, “the earlier, better,” George Painter, pharmacologist Emory University one molnupiravir’s early developers, told me. That’s punishingly tight window, especially nations short diagnostics detect virus—as well access health workers infrastructure prescribe provide drug. 

To say nothing antivaxxers don’t seek treatment it’s late, refuse tested covid. really prefer moderna kid(s) worth waiting?

Up you, personally bother waiting. First, idea Moderna apply EUA younger children, like say ""oh it'll another month"" - may waiting quite while. Second, I'm oracle can't predict future, seem period plateau decline case counts US, want protect kid COVID, probably higher value earlier rather later may less spread. Third, dosing children completely different dosing adults, idea differences waning protection symptomatic COVID appear children too. Endocarditis myocarditis Honestly, younger, unvaccinated kids higher risk catching becoming seriously ill covid vaccinated individuals, mask home helpful. 

For family (adults vaccinated, kids 12 not), everyone masks school public reduce chance catching protect other. Even we're vaccinated, likely continue mask public transmission rates high community, feel comfortable seeing friends family indoors again.  Faith one things inherently impossible prove.

Plus even religion one made head adherents, legit religion.

But can't job religious beliefs, you. Faith always easy. Oof. attempting change mind? Losing job vaccine kinda sad group vaccine hesitants deserve understanding, pregnant. Society tells women stay away many things pregnant, medicines, ordinary food drink. Often evidence. People line pass judgment pregnant woman who's something disapprove of. 

Nowadays flu Tdap routine pregnancy, would hope obstetricians would become strong advocates vaccination women. me, would clearly make sense get vaccine young.

They're still getting vaccinated, Moderna. plenty vaccines available, makes sense go best one, even others still good.

imo, countries follow British protocol teenagers. Since first dose gives majority protection severe illness second dose gives side-effects (especially comes heart problems young men), makes sense give one dose rather two. stating vaccine hoarding US UK directly lead new variants additional deaths US UK citizens. pointed Delta (the variant really matters point one causing devastation US UK) emerged far vaccine hoarding could even occurred.

2. Even long term effects kids get COVID, want kids taking school, passing around, bringing home older relatives?

I care votes tbh, I'm shocked people still fall msm narrative.. Frankly care. lets family resume semblance normalcy. Everyone else going whatever anyway.      Bring. It. On. next age brackets! 4 year old asks time get vaccine.  I'm little late, here's two cents (which really regurgitation messaging hospital work). vaccines help protect vaccinated hospitalization/death, also lowers rate hospitalizations overall. keeps resources free hospitals treat medical issues, stroke heart attack.

Imagine world something relatively routine like appendicitis there's get treatment hospitals overwhelmed covid patients. tell check back hours, even days, see resources available. However, time, appendix ruptures, go shock, pass away infection. treatment, initially, relatively routine easy fix minimally invasive surgery. end, pass away something modern medicine completely solved capacity handle because, largely unvaccinated, covid patients using hospital's resources.  worst case scenario sure, also far fetched sounds areas country/world.

J&amp;J vs. Pfizer initially question efficacy first I’d think. J&amp;J takes longer reach effectiveness less waning. Many got J&amp;J early needed considered fully vaxxed ASAP, government uses 14 day marker even NY’s release breakthrough infections recently basically suggested 28 (and reports said closer 60). mean since Pfizer booster easy enough get real issues mostly timing logistics individual taking overall ability keep sort effectiveness (at least countries like US it’s readily available).   get kids vaccinated truly, honestly give 2 fucks anyone chooses to.

They say analysed premorbid intelligence, people tests - separate model predicting cognitive performance age (to third order), sex, handedness, ethnicity, first language, country residence, occupational status earning. model find differences due issues. There's small group pre post tests for, really report anything it.

And cognitive deficit find stayed home cases substantial: -0.07 standard deviations. Depression similar effect (0.061) positive (also statistically significant). Feeling nervous edge also offset covid effect almost exactly (0.068). seeing headline depression makes smarter? huge numbers, even small, meaningless effects statistically significant. statistically significant mean ""causal"" even ""likely persist next study"". fact, studies depression generally find negative effect, data happens show positive effect evaluated (or, discarded data quirk practically 0 effect, along mild-covid cognitive deficit).

They got data going tv promoting online questionnaire, argument mention covid promotion, good sample selection issues.

OP gonna delete contribution long. Oh, we’re sure hoping reasonable end masking. Delta going crazy area right I’m thinking while. Sounds lot like constructive dismissal lay person saw news friend wants donate anti vax neither wants it. standard practice require sorts vaccines covid one organ transplant like something new unreasonable hospital require. treatments anti rejection meds you’ll need transplant involve drugs tested stem cell lines you’re probably refusing vaccine for.

And ibuprofen Tums, pretty much every OTC medication... ridiculous. worries. doubt mind mandates work. examples article show that. issue many employers mandating vaccines. might months DOL gets rules place forcing companies 100 employees mandate vaccines legal challenges. absolutely right answer. It’s holding anything unvaccinated person, it’s trying maximize utility scarce resource. Hey, fyi, OP link *super* informative. 

Journalists running preprints isn’t actual problem here. available data is. gets dismissed start donor programs always disqualified people shown required maintain health. get saying, choose kid, Id choos one that's effective (let's say sake argument) 6 months vs one that's less effective. Right? Even 85% vs 92% (fake numbers)

That said, I'd also choose one that's available vs one that's going available 4 extra months. Hence original question what's going moderna.  One good friends got liver transplant due excessive alcoholism (I knew drank, 1.75 liter vodka every day level). 

The process get approved transplant insane. to:

1. Agree give drinking drugs. much beyond drinking, window. 

2. family part agreement. support drinking, transplant process, recovery, financial issues might arise. family agree pay anti-rejection meds unable so. 

3. turn bank records prove financially capable supporting ongoing treatments transplant. 

4. agree give driver's license year limit travel. prevent car accident healing process.

5. medical conditions addressed, including fully vaccinate. agree live completely healthy life style.

6. put contract family sign. 

He told 300 people day die waiting liver. whole process $2m. prove deserve one people deserve second chance life. one point doctors told maybe 5 days left get transplant.

I told everyone gets chance better make count. done everything required still going strong several years later. 

It would've much better become pot head instead alcoholic. least excessive pot use end like this. force counseling came better man end. finally dealt issues ex-wife cheating him. one forcing take it. simply take die organ failure. sure? EXPERT ! Yes people say Millennials &amp; Gen Z whiny entitled, right? Dumb question ""pregnant people""? pregnant women? Men obviously can't get pregnant.  Goalposts? think nature coronaviruses like common cold COVID goalpost? appreciate you! Fuck good, gonna remember later... complaint says beginning March 2020 Amazon required employees Colorado warehouses arrive early, wait lines outside facilities, answer questions check temperature inside. process generally took 20 60 minutes, according time compensable Colorado law, says workers must paid required employer's premises duty, according argued similar lawsuit California federal court **because screenings primarily benefit workers, amount compensable time federal wage law**.

Assholes. I'll impressed fire tenured faculty anti-vaxxers, literally never happen professors deities. Nobel Laureate UC system went anti-vax rant refused vaccinated would absolutely nothing them. Maybe went one ""doctors"" told bad vaccine is... I'm sure would worked out. never said study valid study B wasn’t … fact, actually seem coming conclusion anywhere 20-36% natural infections result long term immunity:

“however, observed 25% donors neutralizing levels dropped undetectable titer time.”

The effect seems 2-10% range vaccinated individuals.

I completely disagree listening CDC guidance giving weight conclusions confirmation bias that’s literally entire job produce compelling reason believe they’re fabricating data I’m going defer actual experts unfounded studies contradict them.

It’s hard believe “we don’t know better” actual experts definitively saying vaccinated better not; even previously affected.

I’m Dunning-Kruger type thinks I’m smarter am. recognize I’m massively unqualified interpreting data I’m going listen people studied entire lives. Unless you’re epidemiologist infectious disease expert (like many people you’re disagreeing with) think it’s ridiculous think interpretation ‘research’ equal weight theirs.

The burden proof refute expert medical advice me, unqualified amateur, prove they’re right.

You chopped relevant part quote well. said was:

“The actual conclusion section many “previously infected” self diagnosed don’t know they’ve really COVID **so “better safe sorry” approach recommended. robust protection people need combination vaccine natural immunity.** It’s lot safer go vaccine natural infection try risk natural infection without vaccine.”

This conclusion derived quote BMJ article:

““As continued put effort vaccination set targets, became apparent people forgetting herd immunity formed natural immunity vaccine immunity,” says Klausner.”

Who made quote? Dr Jeffrey Klausner, infectious disease expert, adviser CDC. *does* seem outspoken advocate treating natural immunity vaccination however opinion widely accepted among medical community steps necessary factor natural infections equation outweigh potential benefits. another doctor said section:

“It’s lot easier put shot arm,” says Sommer. “To PCR test antibody test process get information let think it—it’s lot easier give damn vaccine.” public health, “the primary objective protect many people can,” says. “It’s called collective insurance, think it’s irresponsible public health perspective let people pick choose want do.”

You seem interested using parts article support bias ignoring fact almost every single person quoted, even ones arguing natural immunity, still concede getting vaccinated better not.

I actually tried find last piece information asked made last post doesn’t seem data topic. Again, I’m amateur, logically would seem like 2 forms protection better one also seems supported data expert opinion.

The reality want get natural immunity you’re going essentially confirm negative results almost constant basis going expensive, inconvenient, potentially deadly lot “previous infections” self diagnosed whereas vaccine documented verifiable.

If bet life something wouldn’t want bet honor system anti-vax/mask crowd demonstrated they’re willing lie ignore precautions avoid even minor inconvenience.

If open natural immunity what’s stop someone saying “I already COVID”. couldn’t ever verified way vaccination that’s good enough (and seemingly majority medical community well). atrocities committed back dehumanizing segment population **based characteristics choose**

Sorry, left part. extremely important choices okay discriminate people for.  know hospitalizations deaths still low UK, odd see long wave lasted there. That's true. Even mild asymptomatic cases they're finding blood clot bio markers, grey matter reduction, heart lung damage, sometimes psychiatric problems. There's also fair percentage kids dealing long covid- things know about. someone going transplant, really understand want remove risk infection prior it, especially pandemic. logical. Sorry sorry.

I'm sorry situation frustrating must be.

2. CDC approves shots go arms processes make sure spot something goes wrong. 

It's obviously bit nuanced that's reasonable delineation.

Neurological symptoms Long Covid don’t seem get enough attention. find particularly concerning research coming Britain:

One study claims demonstrate significant loss brain’s gray matter among people recovered COVID-19, *does* include people mild cases. shrinkage reportedly greatest olfactory lobe directly connected regions, limited regions.

[Brain imaging COVID-19 UK study claims show decline cognitive function, “substantial effect size”, among people COVID-19 — again, *not* limited severe cases.

[Cognitive deficits people recovered recovered COVID-19, including longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits versus controls controlling age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group, pre-existing medical disorders, tiredness, depression anxiety. **deficits substantial effect size people hospitalised (N = 192), also non-hospitalised cases biological confirmation COVID-19 infection (N = 326)**. Analysing markers premorbid intelligence support differences present prior infection. **Finer grained analysis performance across sub-tests supported hypothesis COVID-19 multi-domain impact human cognition**.

Being fully vaccinated reduces risk becoming infected, reduces predicted severity illness. studies didn’t seem strong relationship severity acute illness loss brain tissue cognitive function. right prevailing view seems be, “We’ll living Covid forever, everyone’s going get Covid point”.

Do grounds confidence vaccinated person suffering mild case COVID-19 much less prone acquiring neurological damage decline cognitive function, compared unvaccinated person case severity? There’s limited research whether vaccination provides significant protection Long Covid. Even turned vaccination provides moderately reduced risk brain damage, would *that* reassuring.

There’s lot uncertainty here, seems like there’s realistic possibility large fraction population could literally end brain damage COVID-19 breakthrough infections. meanwhile, public health authorities reassuring public vaccinated, COVID-19 nothing worry about, like bad cold basically.

Vaccine's work, folks. Anyone else feeling really optimistic quality healthcare coming near future? Think much better places everyone page why. vaccinated folks planning travel? I'm starting feel bit cooped home traveling still feels scary got phone mom. saw labor day weekend said ""blessed"" hospital allowed religious exemption. guess they've gone back that. said might job Christmas gifts year. 

She's really digging in... FDA advisory committee meeting Oct 14/15 discuss Moderna Johnson boosters. Personally waiting guidance since week away. next census actually begins next week.

But death registrations pretty robust parts country. significant problem North Caucasus rural areas, tend register dead continue receiving payments, difficult check. Anyways, total deaths can't big error. Corrected. Stay  Even social, older European cities narrow streets small shops. People within feet everywhere go. NYC bit space huge population (8+ million) plus tourists. go! FDA Advisory Committee meeting already scheduled 26th.

God forbid anyone Federal government fast track anything. hoping headline meant would sooner. Every day kids go school best masks find, worry. classmate daughter (but “close contact” lunch, unmasked time) got diagnosed. 

So point… first shots kids early November?   Also article, looks like decision Oct 26th likely, next VRBPAC meeting is. FDA decide there’s enough evidence shots safe work younger children like teens adults. independent expert panel publicly debate evidence Oct. Enjoy miserable hateful communist life  covid last January, mild, also toe issues 2 swelled plus trouble keeping feet warm toes burn get warm.

The study scientific value, actual result comparison covid patients flu patients, yes, covid patients post viral issues. Unfortunately, headline reading 37% get long covid pretty worthless, massive spectrum situations, leads people think means 37% continuously ill organ damage that. 

As reddit, that's called selection bias. get random sample people talking corona experience, get continued symptoms.

Christian Scientists vaccines... yet come favor COVID vax anyway

Dutch reformists vaccines, church whole formal stance COVID vax, number larger congregations supported it. None congregations come it.

Worth noting, someone devout Christian Scientist Dutch Reformist highly unlikely working hospital setting anyway, anyone claiming religious exemption hospital lying bag shit. Don’t like rules

Die then

Quit bothering    Currently dreading future immunosuppresants soon......but much easier still dying covid prefer 'meh freedoms' Yes don’t understand all. aides prioritized terms even going home Johnson &amp; Johnson. sounds like many get jobs, places require vaccines eventually.

I’m even sure check. evangelical megachurch claim religious authority vaccines, lot -- political reasons. Protestants unifying authority outside Bible, kind reason disliked Catholic church. Really?

Yeah, really no-brainer get booster readily available. recommend getting last workday week time rest thing. legitimate medical reason refusing vaccines, get vaccinated. otherwise, getting vaccinated.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Far Cry 6 That's Gustavo you, thank much. Wow, goalposts moved…’  It’s either don’t let hospitals they’re dying COVID. Personally think humane choice. say 60% personnel walk job forced get vaccine.

Bullshit. People whine complain vaccine mandates, say they're going quit, deadline looms, give go get shot. theoretical; already happening.

A handful stick guns quit instead getting vaccinated. missed. Especially reacts. risks lives others. Fuck ‘em. I’m Miss World
Please Covid kill J&amp;J use mRNA technology though. option want avoid mRNA. even though tech around long time, newly vaccine, still go back traditional old way things J&amp;J. argument solid books.   unfortunately part.

Yes, vaxxed. sounds like didn’t work well. still got COVID, still complications, vaccine made sick. response make someone suffer. Amazing human beings Certain chase banks atm lobbies access hours atm card, implement similar system qr code verifies vaccinated status order enter whatever building want. Heck could someone manning door scans qr code inside building(since places huge glass walls/ glass doors) unlocks vaccinated. Keeps workers safe retaliation helps enforce mandate. Ok.I read posts forum, get bit cross see mob reaction, either pro anti vaccination. remember summer 2020 people running AZ vaccine said vaccine going stop anyone getting covid, stop people ending hospital ventilators. never meant cure, sense people accept flu jab cure. Gow we've moved position people getting thrown stores wearing masks anti vaxxer demonstrations goes show ignorant people are. Everyone needs sensible.  sure trolling cases dropping United States masks not. Cases dropping huge Florida masks barley used. trolling went head, I'm sorry. Tracking community transmission heart efforts stop spread coronavirus, scientists say, states daily dashboards showing new cases critical tool public health officials trying track trajectory virus, killed 700,000 Americans.

Yet three crucial months summer, Nebraska report county-level information public. State officials stopped sharing counts new coronavirus cases county public June 30, Delta variant began surging United States.

That design. Gov. Pete Ricketts, Republican opposes mask vaccine mandates, allowed emergency order expire June, state’s unusually strict privacy laws reinstated, said prohibited continued release data.

At time, number new cases Nebraska reached low state, Test Nebraska, gave free virus tests hundreds thousands residents, ended operations shortly emergency ended.

The virus continued spread state, however, driven highly contagious Delta variant. Hospitalizations increased tenfold end June mid-September. New cases rose sharply August. Deaths increased well.

On Sept. 20, coronavirus hospitalizations surpassed 10 percent state’s capacity staffed hospital beds, Mr. Ricketts announced county-level case data would made public new “hospital capacity” state dashboard.

But said data disappear number drops 10 percent 7-day rolling average. state still reporting county-level deaths.

Public health experts Nebraska dismayed summer decision delete dashboard, state legislators wrote letter requesting restored.

A handful state’s 93 counties continued provide daily data websites throughout pandemic 20,000 residents.

That meant real-time data virus across state doctors like Dr. David Brett-Major, infectious disease specialist, July August watching sick people stream emergency department University Nebraska Medical Center Omaha.

“If tests happening cases severe, you’re getting broad look,” said recent interview.

Susan Bockrath, executive director Nebraska Association Local Health Directors, said group brought missing dashboard repeatedly state officials, pointing also necessary tool campaign pandemic misinformation.

The dashboard removed Stephanie Summers, board education president David City, trying determine best policy students families rural community one hour west Omaha. Mr. Ricketts told Nebraskans get vaccinated, declined require masks, despite pleas public health officials.

“The state cannot insist individual’s freedom choose wear, wear, mask, whether get vaccinated, also withhold data needed citizens make informed decisions,” said, adding fully agreed state leaders emphasizing individual freedoms.

While dashboard mostly restored, doctors doubt current testing system capturing reality ground. Two dozen doctors sent letter early September Mr. Ricketts asking return Test Nebraska.

“Our access testing bad right now, turnaround bad, numbers probably vast underestimates, accurate enough testing,” said Dr. Bob Rauner, chief medical officer OneHealth Nebraska, group 65 locally owned medical clinics across state.

The governor aides defended decision stop flow data privacy grounds, saying publishing county-level data could violate state’s version HIPAA, prevents release patients’ personal health information without consent.

Experts say privacy becomes concern releasing data counties handful cases, reason, states generally suppress information jurisdictions fewer five cases deaths.

— Roni Caryn Rabin   European variants (like D614G) around 2.8, wild type (Wuhan) 2.2. Alpha R0 4–5 Delta 5–8.

When Alpha came US, almost nobody vaccinated pretty easy time, even came ""Christmas"" wave.

Delta insane R0, actually damage 50% population vaccinated, w.t./D614G used 0% population vaccinate, infection rate increase. *Then* there's also fact hospitalizations rate per infection like 2x higher Delta, infect people time, also sends hospitals previous variants would done rate infections.

So yeah that's basically crippling South (plus Alaska) healthcare even vaccinations available. escape Delta, vaccinate hope goes well. possible, would recommended even booster dose, especially people risk age pre-existing conditions.  Six times likely according know FHM would stop moderna vaccinations people age 30 there’s wasn’t serious concerns / higher odds myocarditis Covid.

I think correct assumption. could make change risk higher Pfizer. Funny news SF Bay already done months ago. Anyone link Swedish study moderna myocarditis rate? good. know RT anti-vaxer it’s definitely limited laborers. one drinks drugs also stay crazy late. late nights really weaken immune system.

I’m sure drugs alcohol impact paired late night much less sleep it’s bad combo avoiding illness going around.   enforce every time. People figure way beat then...but always. continuous nudge get people change minds. think biggest dodge forged vax cards. Since LA massively soft criminal activity anyway (check nationally famous DA), doubt taken seriously. Hard prove without effort maybe citation caught. I'd like proven wrong.    Likely going office soon, cautious immunocompromised persons office home. wanted see anyone could recommend decent at-home thermometer rapid tests. Preferably nothing pricy.  Awesome  me.

Just feeling like I’m getting two weeks. really fucking knows. Could wake tomorrow feel like shit again. stuff weird.  bring good points.

Some questions:

How many 1.4 million people since gotten vaccination? 

How many people gotten reinfected vs get vaccinated afterwards? would imagine case vaccine basically acts booster.

Do know current numbers breakthrough infections looks like overall?

Can chalked behavior modification (hey, I'm going cautious now, want again!) or, perhaps, already it, knew immediately even bother getting tested? Yeah definitely expected get yelled times. yet happen though good. get two people hundreds I've asked vaccinated told left.  But, why? seems important information. thing FHM said new data Scandinavia suggests moderna vaccine far likely cause myocarditis, specific vaccine currently outweigh risk COVID age group - hence pulling people age 30. 

It’s big move make vaccine deliveries September forward Moderna. option left Pfizer recommended everyone 30.

I wish could get second dose Moderna since seems quite alot effective, looks like I’ll gettting Pfizer like part NZ eradicated virus forever - virus kept spreading. march december 2020 (7 months)

That's 9.5 year already 10 months in

We data 9 months 2021 far.   isn’t single vaccine history presented side effects first 6 weeks, even less reason expect happen these.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* sounds good theory. Mine asked though. Asked specific dates kinda made since couldn’t remember exact dates. Never asked see card. I’m sure many avoid potential conflicts since controversial topic. That’s guess though. that. 

Smallpox vaccine required schools starting 1800's. NYC required indoor events + dining. I'm big Knicks fan reason enough haha 😆
 
I'm still working home masking go errands etc even tho mandatory make older ppl feel ease. Usually go food shopping 12pm weekday I'm youngish person time live Honolulu. Business dine 50% lot places. (for dine in).the side effect loss jobs, since restaurants debating shutting dine in, take only. far enforcement fines, original fine 5k, govenor signed mayors order, dropped $250, still advertised 5k reason. far enforcement goes, I've noticed pretty selective. Restaurants spoke things publically, gotten fined previously, magically ""gotten busted"" time around, why, keep mouths shut, disparage govt. 

To dine in: negative covid test within 48 hours, vaccination card. 


To work: negative covid test within last week, vaccination card. moment realize virtually ""The Rules"" English grammar ultimately ""some guy enough money write book thought X sounded/looked better""...

Becoming editor final nudge needed become descriptivist prescriptivist... found epidemic tracker here: know truthful/accurate found interesting! comment meant exhaustive resource guide one get vaccinated. linked CDC guidance subject summarized website.

But please, go comprehensive informative research findings. It’s excessive antivaxxers pushed us far. you’re pro vax sick tired unable go back normal morons, support measure force idiots get shot. It’s really way get back normal. links people discussing thread.

I think Sweden backing Moderna caccine options. US moderna isnt approved anyone 18 isnt lot data.

CDC said outright venefits vaccines far outweigh rare mild side effect like min ill dig research link covid myocarditis apple wallet QR code LA County (Healthvana) name, dates doses. saying take that?

Got mine via agree. worded it, ""claim freedom . . ."" claim freedom, except freedom like makes look bad. Wappies gonna wap true? data [our world show 350,000 deaths jan 1 674,000 currently, so324,000 year. Yeah, like shocking people want work bad wages shitty conditions abused increasingly cruel violent public. probably wont enforced, think act cover businesses want mandating vaccination customers. ""Sorry city says can't, take representatives""   enforced though? one thing say, arenas theaters, already show ticket get in, wait line outside get vaccine card checked every time need go store? might bad LA (aside time add trip take busy), Michigan winter coming hope city require stores. I'm fine types businesses makes sense, making people line 5 minute trip store one item feels bit much.  Pandemic stupid. live highly vaccinated city life back normal. Holy shit sound like old philosophy teacher mine lmao. extra comment deep man. got done perusing huge thread LA requiring vaccine IDs everywhere. Man people get it, sides fence.

Vaccine makes immune! covid already I'm Jesus!  Good Lord absolute ridonkulous world. Australia bad. Fuck shit. voting pool, gene pool well. rais ehte collective IQ US points Oh I'm sure. He's probably one stand humans ever want meet. nice hear stuff like this, thank you:) ""covid kill son, covid kill wife, covid kill infant daughter"" - Gus Gee wonder treatment less effective WASNT FUCKING VACCINATED Well, think you’re right… however everything shutdown everyone home 2020, probably helped. 

2021 *could* lower numbers wasn’t politics, whole “staying home”thing helped well. 

Also, schools opening isn’t helping spread either. philosopher would really like know counts philosophical reason.   That’s myth. statistics:

[According report, 89 percent died covid-19 Sweden 70 years old. Norway Finland figure 87 percent Denmark 88 approx. 2,350 Danes per. March 1, 2021 according Statens Serum Institut died COVID-19, 920 lived nursing homes. corresponds approx. **39 percent** covid deaths. look across Sound, Swedish National Board Health Welfare calculated 5,300 dead nursing home residents COVID-19, corresponding approx. **44 percent** died COVID-19 Sweden. Different NDC codes, different concentrations billing rules. heard anything yet storage...  Cannot wait get kid vaccinated worry much. Since started school, seemingly perpetually ill. back mind always think ""is COVID time?""  One coworkers sad leave county mandated vaccines said transfer another county wants keep working. friend keep saying “Well mean there’s always another option that’ll get SHOT staying here” REFUSES assumed it? supposed feel bad? APPROVAL (IF APPROVAL

Of note, 5-11 y/o version different NDC 12+. means another ~ week delay getting shipments out.  very, delicate balance though, carefully considered. 

Here's problem. release factually correct, objective data like fit narrative, become accused bias, skewing information, etc., give anti-vaxxers ammunition fuels *""THEY telling everything!""* conspiracy theories. leads anti-vax propaganda help anybody. 

If release information, give anti-vaxxers ammunition fuels *""See? vaccines even work anyway!""* narrative.  also leads anti-vax propaganda vaccine hesitancy.  Again, help anybody. 

It's damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't situation.  matter handled, data going help anti-vaccine crowd one way other. problem handle situation going forward, knowing anti-vax crowd going shove information like right everybody's throats. looked term see means. would want search find easily? doorbell disabled can’t find *ME* lol. 

Are people bored can’t think anything better lives search reasons hate people? 

Found week badly screwed society really social media going hospital. Seems social media worse society actual covid lol. I’m social haven’t part deterioration process interacting people last week demonstrated screwed people gotten past year half. also happening elsewhere. organ transplants unvaccinated.  cousin died waiting kidney. everything right, followed rules, still couldn’t get one time. limited supply organs access supply privilege, right.  fired, fall federal mandate vaccine considered necessary job. can't work without it, fired legit exemption. Basically allows leave accord. sure exactly works that's latest info got passed down. Ok, next Table 2 worth look!

The incidence myocarditis young males (16-29yr) 10.7 per 100000 (1 10 thousands) 30 times greater females age five times common older males. covid get rid social media nah? exempted, put leave? curious… allow posts singular individual. includes posts someone hospitalized, dying testing positive. think error, please modmail us.

Sure conclusive evidence saying ivermectin works. Let researchers research get vaccinated meantime.  also believe dont want vaccine forced get it.

Then get organ could go someone willing get vaccinated, either.

You're right, empathy gone. many people know lost family members fucking disease cannot comprehend someone jumping first opportunity get shot *prevent death* whether someone else. can't read article, paywall, there's hugeeee difference antivax anti-mandate.

Fine. NEXT! We’ll get ready die hill. People still says experimental vaccine… yeah around 3 billion people received it. Well dang, happy irl cake/pizza day holmes  I'm happy people kids 5-11, really am. someone 4.5-year-old 1-year-old, I'm exhausted saddened. understand need things competently, rate, looking like we'll another holiday season robbed us. can't wait 2022 here. Chicken korma sauce. Yum yum. bother, 0 cases people quite friends acquaintances. Tons also post publicly zero filter. search prayer warriors find easily. mmm, oh chicken 65 sounds delicious. it’s waste organ. needs vaccine immune system way way weaker anti-rejection drugs. You’re considered vulnerable population there’s reason they’ve prioritized things like vaccines. require alcoholics smokers obstain long period usually transplant show they’re less likely completely waste organ. Organs really valuable it’s someone who’s going follow directions make sure nothing happens they’ll getting people refuse vaccination. suppose believe they’ll take drugs they’ll rest life side effects long term effects much serious vaccine. don’t *want* someone die it’s getting organ someone who’s going follow medical advice well I’m choosing latter. True, still think people good understanding exactly uncommon is. Accommodate medical exemptions, current guidance U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention, said two-dose mRNA vaccines one dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine safe almost patients.  major contraindication vaccines listed CDC severe allergic reaction first dose. cases, person advised consult physician hold second dose, according Dowdy.  talking people pain site injection rash, we're talking anaphylactic shock,"" said.  said data far shows severe allergy rare, less one 1 million people experience it.  Sounds great! I’ve vaccinated 6 months traveling extensively. point delaying life unless particularly high risk. Yeah understand people wanting get approved faster. better skip steps comes children. Good thing things called vaccines delta likely burned majority unvaccinated already. still cherrypicking. October 5, 2020 day waves. October 5, 2021 day long Delta Wave crested.

The data pay attention raw deaths, cutoff date using roughly March 14, 2021: earliest point vaccines would make serious difference (as that's point group 1A wrapping second shots).

And make *that* comparison--an actual vaccine vaccine, see this:

2020 deaths: 375,089 deaths

Before March 14, 2021: 173,585 deaths

After date: 154,865 deaths (*these* deaths mostly political)

Things *are* better year, especially considering American deaths really started March 2020. requiring proof vaccination resulted racist attacks, basically weeded dormant racists customer base. What’s problem again? COVID documented cause severe kidney damage, well heart, lung abd liver, vaccine proven greatly reduce chances COVID infection developing level severity, seems like good medical protocol. eligible organ transplant without many vaccinations slew post surgery preventative meds. wrong people? accept diagnosis transplant recommendation believe doctors say? understanding, one options considered. 

It benefits (supply already there) drawbacks (the main one potential imprecise dosing: person injection accurately reliably withdraw correct dose). 

Another proposed option shipping vials diluent diluted give children volume adults (just lower concentration). would make bottle children only. timeframe 5’s now? I’ve hoping 2 year old would vaccinated shortly age group.  guess religious exemption religious reason proven (and course mom reason) I'm thinking old fashioned, unhealthy grilled cheese. one ages! That's idea systems sure, lot dipshits move low quality home aide care put vulnerable higher risk Estimate date two year old eligible? Baby J save  would waste organ someone who’s going immunocompromised due transplant medications, catch Covid they’ll probably die. kidney would basically thrown away. Ooooh fire  Alternative title:

Transplant patients go MAJOR immunosuppressants get transplant. Unvaccinated transplant patients die covid 20% rate.

- Vaccinated: 1000 kids, 50 get COVID roll dice 99%. *Maybe* 1 death.

Michigan behind, I'm sure crested start dropping. live Ontario, already crested coming down.  infect covid  would lovely. already ID checks gate use military tickets (and it’s surprisingly thorough every time) security checkpoints guards well park entry. Seems like no-brainer me. happily vaccinated became requirement, good. waited BIG GOVERNMENT told probably wouldn’t get it. There's personal choice pandemic.

Honestly government go door door verify vaccination status. long overdue. Cotrect. data submission allowed FDA schedule Advisory Committee meeting 26th month Pfizer submitted formal request.   Yeah. show can’t comply basic medical direction would give organ going require high compliance (lifelong meds example) likely kill along get COVID-19. Yes should.

All citizens also need one work, RFID scanners businesses check people them.

We technology this. Make happen. Ah, yes, ~~totally State Capitalist~~ communist China. Yes. know it’s safe, know wrong, couldn’t ever admit using “they MADE me” excuse. long would one wait finishing chemo? him, year. need get vaccinations.

We shortage organs, need go likely survive. really understand news outlets report terms percentage total workforce. Spray rubbing alcohol jab wherever. Honestly, point 1,500 kids 5-11 even received vaccine I'm sure would even really know.  infuriating conversation anti vaxxer day, pointed pregnant women dying droves covid. response basically, know didn’t die something else? 

Like know women suddenly intubated emergency c sections try save baby didn’t magically die something covid covid? 

These fucking people man. might able manage least little bit holiday last year, especially availability rapid tests expands predicted. probably small one day gathering select family friends within driving distance kids unvaccinated, everyone takes home rapid test morning of. know it’s usual it’s better nothing. Fox mandate vaccines too?  vaccine, job, health insurance get sick covid. Antivaxxers pretty bad spot. original comment got moderated “political link” go again. I’m guessing medium link used summarized study direct way I’ll still include quote.

Original comment:

It’s confusing thought talking benefits vaccination previous immunity want know breakthrough rate someone vaccinated maybe never COVID. don’t see relevance information context it’s impossible ascertain someone asymptomatic would never know would self-report “never infected”.

The numbers gave quick Google search. barely validation numbers again, doesn’t seem matter you, going abandon discussion anyway effort level low point.

The 0.5% number study done state Washington doesn’t exclude people may infected previously it’s impossible filter uninfected asymptomatic unless access time machine go back time capture group people live experiment. point many people ‘pissed pool’ effectively filter groups way.

It really doesn’t matter though relevant data whether vaccine helps prevent reinfection versus natural immunity alone answer yes. It’s 2x effective.

Source 0.7% number unvaccinated researchers teamed MU Institute Data Science Informatics Tiger Institute Health Innovation review data 62 U.S. health care facilities. found 63 9,119 patients (0.7%) severe COVID-19 infection contracted virus second time, mean reinfection period 116 days. 63 reinfected, two (3.2%) died. Patients categorized non-white greater risk reinfection white patients.”

Source 0.5% number expect dismiss it’s filtered impossible way state data shows 21,757 vaccine breakthrough cases among 4.1 million vaccinated people January 17 — August 21, 2021. Although might sound like high number, means 0.5% vaccinated Washingtonians breakthrough infections. breakthrough cases data for, 9% required hospitalization less 1% died COVID-related illness.”

The way you’re going get answer question someone literally raises large batch humans isolation entire lives purpose human experimentation that’s never going happen you’re going settle comparing breakthrough cases vaccinated versus reinfection rates unvaxed.

If that’s criteria you’ll accept you’ll never convinced. Recognize however convinced doesn’t make position valid actual experts. think lot attention paid schools rather indoor facility. [an article along several references find interesting. note '*recommends*' rather '*mandates*' increased ventilation. 

It may *can't* mandate much building codes generally matters state municipal jurisdiction. Many places, however, adopted model international code.

I recall HVAC technician weighed matter particular board, lot say. Unfortunately can't remember id contents contribution - interesting possibly useful. Anecdotal. may live place particularly high rate obesity.  read incorrectly. read Sagan's 10/10 would read again.

If coins left, would given gold that.  reality, would unvaccinated lives drop (say) 0.2 years whereas vaccinated 2.4 years (assuming 50% vaccination) average 2.2 years

First all, 0.2 2.4 average 2.2, assuming 50% vaccination.

Not reality, *hypothetically*, could right, ignore information.

In *reality*, given know effect vaccination infection hospitalization rates, vaccinated people significantly smaller drop life expectancy. So, unvaccinated people, drop even larger 2.2 years.   sucks, known issue left. NZ still good handle covid opening 17000 people make things worse trying get people vaxxed. bad wording part. paying attention, approved use age group countries? Ah think missed word, lack masking causing resurgence  saying vaccine mandates 99% survival rate?

LOL  going good still.   ""there methods defense war"" jfc even talking Honestly reason ask incredibly shallow. I'm going Walt Disney World end next year really want take pictures different Disney Characters like Mickey Mouse, Disney Princesses, etc. still take pictures distance course, miss old ways. Thanks. I’ve called places locally back business usual, masks. live area that’s well vaccinated sharing equipment, tables, etc... freaks right now. realize it’s surface issue compared airborne, don’t want tons patients, therapists, etc indoors. I'm slightly concerned, i've read, 100x likely get Covid so... much like every concern anything vaccine related, issues way worse Covid itself.  OK, gonna learn something today. Breakthrough cases actually rare. reason many hundreds millions people vaccinated. What's 1% 200 million people? still 2 million people. problem delta super contagious unvaccinated person gets COVID, pass 7 people, average. people vaccinated, odds good they'll fight virus. vaccinated, get COVID pass 7 people average? people vaccinated, people fight virus becomes breakthrough case. That's vaccines work. wrong, prove science. needed liver transplant alcoholic cirrhosis told need quit drinking alcohol using IV drugs! That's discrimination! wanted know answer, like you, like them, answer know over. 

It could run course next year peter out, run decade current pace, new variant could spring send bunch people graves rest back homes. Nobody knows. Socially we’re pretty much towards end. It’s basically 2019 masks lot times even that. Tune college gameday NFL, crowds stadiums full capacity masks.  reality, would unvaccinated lives drop (say) 0.2 years whereas vaccinated 2.4 years (assuming 50% vaccination) average 2.2 years really sure worthy study beyond vitro dosage required get levels walking talking person would undoubtedly kill along covid. Gotta imagine state operating good faith would mandate vaccine public school students prohibited medical condition. Public schools mandating vaccines long time, see reason mandate one. Protect children costs. Even think fighting covid war, methods defend it, China Russia using information warfare citizens order decrease vaccination rates, drive polarization order cause damage western countries. fell it. Thank prefacing statement with, legitimate medical reason. posts ignore clump idiots of, god knows why. husband fully vaccinated yet grown daughter legit medical reasons. made feel like trash detrimental mental health. tired this. post facebook make official Yeah, Moderna potent vaccine.

One participants Moderna trials given something close 1,000 µg per dose (when deciding right dosage).. Apparently (temporary) side-effects dose large extremely bad. Never vaccine *ever* advertised 100% effective infections. tiring hearing people pretend like vaccines advertised way they've never been.

Yes get infected vaccination, nobody ever said couldn't. Ffs.  funny enough, leeches used early detection Corona viruses animal populations. also considered help microthroboses early pandemic. might still rare cases. That's good critique cognitive testing study. brain bank study, also raise good first study much better pre- post-imaging question set reasonably, like say, ""Whether deleterious impact partially reversed, instance improvement hyposmic symptoms, whether effects persist long term, remains investigated"".

Yes that’s true. finding whether damage reversible, permanent, least long-lasting, could well take years. question, question vulnerable vaccinated effects, end unfavourable answers, time damage already done. effective vaccines can't come soon enough. nasally administered, live virus vaccine attenuated codon pair deoptimization removal furin cleavage site: [Scalable live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate demonstrates preclinical safety guess one likes hearing someone raise prospect dire outcomes. seems like complacency face possibilities recurring pattern throughout pandemic. Think took months acknowledge reality transmission people showing symptoms, hindering efforts contain transmission critical stage. even now, fully year half pandemic, public health authorities grudgingly, half-heartedly acknowledging reality airborne transmission, rather giving central place containment strategy making concerted effort raise public awareness.

Instead many countries, US among them, began systematically dismantle web protective measures spent better part last year building. now. guess. Personally find idea claiming understanding wants desires hubris best. Like said, _I_ would rather alive hypocrite obviously grandpa's brother want be. Poor phrasing, probably better say ""paused"" rather banned implies long-term restriction.  Making mRNA vaccines also recipe.

It relies heavily things like nanotech-scale pumps encapsulation, really hard part making mRNA vaccines.

Stuff like bespoke, i.e. built order, companies exist build already booked capacity years come. “I’ll kill anyone comes home forces get vaccine” changed “Please, cannot afford without work.” Unfortunately Alaska, getting vaccine safely part also challenge. already lot flights Seattle Portland, we’re full moment well thanks neighbors.   weather distance. It’s tough get vaccine extremely remote places it’s needed logistics-wise also info doesn’t travel fast enough there. lot folks isolationist ideas think Covid won’t reach on. Remember, Alaska gigantic top world. main landmass alone comparable nearly third mainland US. That’s food alone expensive there.  agree. Companies need make clear here. ridiculous many people abuse honor system. 

Reminds spilled coffee sued big bucks. coffee cups coffee cup holders text, warning contents may hot. 

If order hot coffee, think would happen spill yourself.

When honor system longer relied on, would work anyone get exemptions legitimate reasons whether vaccinated time family emergencies.   don’t think she’s tough think isn’t exactly sharpest tool shed Sounds awesome tbh. found token bigot. attitude I’m hesitant go back volunteering COVID clinics.

Well, that's humanity you. Sorry, think jadedness showing. Completely understand agree. understand kids typically fare better adults COVID, really felt like children overlooked throughout pandemic. Even now, know people vaccinated think -- forgetting us little ones. hard socializing work too. Hang there! know seems like lot people care, lot too. We're almost there; little longer go. Next year, maybe they’ll tell us filling bunch rooms unvaxed kids drove outbreaks schools !🤦🏼 Can’t wait till next discovery ! looks like mostly mild endocarditis 100 per million doses young risk endocarditis COVID-19 infection 4 times much young patients 450 per me, would clearly make sense get vaccine young. keep masked even vaccination? 

I personally never took mask vaccination, Whoopi doo, know, brought back fashion. Felt like better multi-faceted defense, plus, doesn’t bother wear one.

That said. Even don’t know I’d take lol, number, metric, idk. thought weird now, haha. 230M Confirmed cases covid, means billion, maybe even 2 billion people gotten covid, almost 3 billion people fully vaccinated, we’re getting there. eat sushi time. know personal choice issues.

You agree. pretty simple premise, there's plenty precedent. Populace danger; government gets work!

Now, yankee cowboy, go back eating Walmart McDonald's hamburgers watching country music football halftime show. U.S.A!  trust fda evaluating concern approval process. Yes. makes lot sense. Even though waiting transplants compromised, stronger immune system pre transplant start anti rejection meds. Give vaccine develop antibodies COVID19.

Well option even stop breakthrough cases ""breakthrough"" transmissibility, interested that, too? stop probing vaccines exist

It doesn’t, so. 

And probing. There’s life hanging hope hard-selling questionable-at-best antiparasitic. new ad though touted state even winter coming. thought recent ad. even says ""... get free vaccination here"". Billions doses given around world. Billions. see sudden massive spike infertility? No? That's one fear mongering.

The fact background medical science *precisely* listen doctors. know, almost every single doctor entire world. people claim ""did research"" full shit people qualified. surgery March year.

Anesthesiologist comes hour surgery ask routine questions (coughing, apnea, smoking, lung issues, etc). 

At one point asks I've COVID tell no. sorta steps back lets really big sigh nods head. ask anything wrong tells that's really good thing don't. told surgical patients who've COVID need anesthesiology surgery experience terrible consequences under. said it, told 50/50 chance make not. Sorry, sarcastic. There’s literally 4 different vaccines available still people looking back door, “miracle” drugs… Ah, see confusion. 53% number mandate announced total population 67% number currently adults. they’re apples oranges. Bad reporting IMO easy mistake make. Nonetheless, probably worth editing original comment misinformation doesn’t get spread. talking clouds, man. actually would like know question. highly suggest posing questions r/COVID19 weekly thread. many professionals field answer them, even link appropriate peer reviewed studies. bad ivermectin isn’t antiviral. :( Please please please true. I’m worried next talking point “what kids 5??!”. Probably still, imagine it’ll take lots time grow organ, plus immunosuppressive drugs take post transplant likely cause person die contract severe COVID. don’t think we’ll ever surplus organs lifetimes, need great. taking tacrolimus? That’s one worse ones far nephrotoxicity goes  Anti-vaxxers reason thousands Americans still dying every days. legitimately killing people stupid, arrogant selfish. That's plenty good reason hate someone. Ive seen movie fairly recent study Israel seemed legit (was double blind included placebo). discredited? scientist every single one colleagues vaccinated, actually support mandates. like employer's rules, find new employer. Simple that.

That different happening sweeping mandates. Oh, well guess..goodbye, ruby Tuesdays unvaxed affect everyone. 50's irradicated polio vaccination.....of virtually everyone. reach 80% vaccination rate fight forever. Variant stronger strains develop death rate spike on. Forever.  aware could need wheelchair near someone wheelchair. always needed vaccinated get organ transplants. don’t give organs replace broken one unless you’ll actually take care afterwards. HUGE lines organ transplants, would waste organ someone who’ll break new one? 🤷‍♂️ also don’t let kidney transplants go alchoholics, actively trying harm…play rules. metabolized enzyme liver (cytochrome p450) eat lot grapefruit essentially ""revs up"" enzyme. drugs break faster, drugs get metabolized active form faster. mom heart transplant three years ago now, three Moderna shots, still antibodies.

Also prior transplant, two years covid, get ton vaccines part pre-transplant medical stuff. refused would never put transplant list.

This another case always get vaccinated, like school military, people suddenly acting like outrageous. study considered 11.2 million people 16, 2.0 million received booster dose. 

The study also found 3 doses Sinovac 80% efficacy symptomatic Covid. compares 56% efficacy two doses Sinovac. 

In cases efficacy hospitalization also went little (from 84% two doses Sinovac 87% Pfizer booster, 96% Astrazeneca booster 88% third Sinovac shot).

There update efficacy ICU admissions deaths normally correlates hospitalizations. Got booster 4-6 weeks ago seems like. sure, recently. pharmacy tech said ton. sign paper said immunocompromised. easy. Even wasn’t immunocompromised it’s like someone calling PCP check. reason there’s staggered roll supply issues. Get people need first. 

I got mine like 9am, felt kinda run day, felt like dog shit two days after. However taken immunosuppressive day got booster. worried body’s response, matter poorly felt still felt better poor schlub vent, even hospital. I’m stay home dad wasn’t much way plans change, was/is pretty nice. 

From experience, get booster vaccine obviously, plan easy day next day. I’m also assuming people won’t reaction like mine, won’t severe. really wasn’t bad. ended sleeping late, eating ibuprofen every 4-6 hours, longer nap expected. would insult donor gift life given someone thinks horse paste cure COVID. one cares. friends living life understand over(they fully vaxxed boosters) anyway like let's something Halloween year told still outdoor things still response cases way down....yeah average around 4k day county 2k day, June averaging sub 50 day weeks. they've planes weddings. Like cool live life judgements can't around unvaxxed kid.

But childless choice think novelty get see sometimes, actually invested life health. right decide waste organ? Surely set conditions quality body it’s going go into… 



They waste organ, time, money, putting someone doesn’t care life.


Do people argue put new livers active raging alcoholics too??? Oh my. going great lunch break reading! Haha Auditioning Wingnut Welfare, assume. There's always place FOX *et al.* token iconoclasts proper credentials, since reject even overwhelming scientific/medical consensus apparent authority. Sucks suck.  many would choose lose six figure paycheck. idiot. hospital going hire agree. Better still openly believe medicine survive, baby steps. Lol  they're stupid. I'm tired talking them. Tired repeating bad talking points accepting go one one refute them.

On Twitter I'm constant battle r-words can't accept they're wrong. getting many people vaccinated possible important. everyone protected vaccinated. People organ transplants especially vulnerable rely people around vaccinated i.e. herd immunity keep safe. trust doctors vaccines trust shove someone else's organs load immunosuppressants?


It make sense.  she’s immunosuppressants gets COVID she’s dead anyway. doctors point - still immune system immunocompromised, weaker little slower.   incredibly stressful. transplant coordinator always jokes need write book titled, ""My Kid Transplanted Pandemic"". active Covid infection long Covid requiring use supplemental oxygen increases risk pulmonary issues intra post op way it’s coin flip make surgery.   constitutional right someone else’s internal organs.

I costitutional rights gf ass know mean. would think Christian Scientist would exception well. One main beliefs illnesses mental errors rather physical believe power prayer basically answer illnesses works best combined medicine. fully vaccinated symptoms, want get people's idea think covid. proper test scheduled tomorrow quarantining. Since Sunday, I've mild sore throat (nothing bad) felt fatigued afternoon/evening nap, feel fine. fever, taste smell, symptoms non-existent. took two at-home tests.

So begs question... why?
It's simple question really.... criminal gets shot gunfight police treat wounds. drunk driver crashes car gets hurt treat injuries.

The numbers heard elsewhere around 70 cases ~11 million Pfizer shots Sweden, 40(?) cases ~2 million Moderna shots, age composition matters lot since Pfizer heavily used beginning older people got vaccinated Moderna started used later on.

But looks like risk side effects higher Moderna Pfizer. Well, foxnews tell immunosuppressants devil George Washington hated vaccine mandates.

Water wet sounds like logical well thought decision hospital. real reasons, always heroes stories, get confused rest us see dipshits little glass vial? Also BTW, specific covid vaccine. Certain things like drugs, heavy alcohol drinking, vaccines, etc. also things would disqualify organ transplants. shouldn’t news. I’m starting downvote shit don’t like anymore. Stupid tiktoks included. Even enjoy them, someone’s gotta like Thanos snap fingers shit.  life repo man always intense  End year would preferable. source I've used, reference. hill going die on. news? immunosuppressants start vaccine work.

False. Studies estimate anywhere 59-71% efficacy immunocompromised people. Saying vaccine ""won't work"" cant imagine stressful past year half (at least) family. wish best. past approvals indication, begin shipping receive FDA approval. stupid thing probably objects vaccine foreign substance might adverse reaction to......yet wants somebody else's liver (a giant foreign substance) inserted body, know initially adverse reaction (why immunosupressants needed).

The mental gymnastics deserving Olympic sport.  33,000 employees Wondering deaths unvaccinated also played role statistic. I've seen. FDA extended testing timeframe specifically that, they're still seeking approval. I’m favor vaccine mandates, don’t believe correct. Scroll % population that’s fully vaccinated click Chart. increased 3% September, slightly August much. total population adults, nonetheless come close getting 14% adults fully vaxxed September. funny unintended benefit vaccine mandates purging moron employees. I'm sure remaining staff sad see go; kind person becomes antivaxer tends pleasant around. real medical reason cannot get vaccinated would likely even medical reasons get transplant.   made back like March true. never really managed increase vaccination rate much beyond late spring. Dunleavy fucking useless dipshit.   Piling on, chances living long enough die theoretical future side effects vaccine slim best circumstances. we're seeing someone demonstrating they're plain dumb follow post transplant treatments restrictions.

My mom deemed old accept kidney transplant. lived NINE YEARS dialysis 150 IQ followed every instruction letter. better believe functioning kidney she'd still alive today would humming along like idling Lambo. person waste tissue keeping deserving people like mom getting transplant. 💯⬆️   brain translated title to, “woman says told couldn’t get kidney transplant unless got life-saving vaccine.” huge difference basically means thing, unless you’re idiot.  You’re making difficult. much easier clone figure age clone murder harvest fresh organs. Reacts ton things.

[So maybe long anyone wondering, listed two main reasons possible underreporting vaccinations Hu, Universal Basic Income mandate work all. think do. ""vice signaling"" - believe bullshit. True point bringing donor. donor evaluated/approved meet criteria, includes vaccination. Also, risk anyone live organ donor, unvaccinated means donor challenges recovery after, reduced organ function (in healthy kidney donor, remaining organ eventually ""catch up"" provide near-normal function, takes time). Likely years away. basic triage. Vaccinated people much greater chance survival unvaccinated people. liver transplant list get calls letters monthly basis. Yep, huge box KF94s kids comfortable wearing day feel best solution protection wise. R/masks4all great resource. Just… I’d rather also vaccinated. lul, people need kidneys need them; decisions based viability urgency. make less viable candidate survival, purpose, fuck think happen? Honestly, fully vaccinated also hate masks, mind continuing mask period time within reason (say, 5+ chance get it)... big problem one showing leadership terms metrics need achieve remove restrictions (including masks) go back normal. People need kind goal, course going frustrate heck them. saw phrase ""sleeping walking indefinite masking"" article weeks ago, really feels like work. goals set, end sight, like 95%+ vaccinated community (university).
