This turn pretty substantial effect close population immunity, many die get there, on. Yes, know severity would similar severity non-Delta covid unvaccinated people, that's alarming least. Especially since healthcare workers, probably little healthier average general population. 18% breakthrough little high taste well. pandemic broke found bunch N95's kicking around past projects. expired much better nothing. 

I'd love see data gathered mask effectiveness since early days pandemic. much PPE considered one time use, doctors using single N95 per day due supply issues. It‚Äôs not?! Couldn‚Äôt tell parts‚Ä¶ got Presumably got sick within days shot?

That sucks I‚Äôd hardly call ‚Äúlong term‚Äù. think draw conclusion.

My comment ""**single dose** AZ better Pfizer Delta""

how evident here?

FWIW, speculation 2 dose Pfizer prove effective 2 dose AZ account interference AZ boost vector antibodies. could overcome though mixing (i.e AZ 1st mRNA 2nd). fully vaccinated them? black community huge issue well. It‚Äôs trust. worries. shit ain't easy, matter planet last year half.

But remember, temporary, pass. Remember came light Sweden even allowing elderly covid patients go hospital die equivalent nursing homes? terrible.

[what‚Äôs going wrong Sweden,s care /r/COVID19 strictly scientific discussion. /r/science, limited COVID-19 topics. Many parents (like myself) would want data dangerous kids covid type take vaccination. personally got vaccine early could, given minimal risks Covid kids well unknown potential effect vaccines development younger kids - I'd love wait bit. there's another strain seems dangerous kids current ones, I'd also reconsider getting kid vaccinated ASAP Something something freedom. know 100% thats okay. Cant live life fear. higher chance getting car accident catching covid. I'm pro science 
Are That‚Äôs NHS COVID pass for. Unless you‚Äôre anti-vaccines think don‚Äôt work - that‚Äôs silly won‚Äôt assume that. Breakthrough cases happen, 100% effective. know that. becomes concern i‚Äôll worry. Lambda, Lambda, Lambda! Japan literally power stop Olympics. contract signed gives IOC exclusive power cancel. Really great news! study little worrying: 18% vaccinated nurses breakthrough infections, infection severity similar unvaccinated people non-delta Appreciate that! That‚Äôs kind you. Yes it‚Äôs shame home grown vaccine scrapped early on.  2 weeks guys

How damn privileged able non-chalantly suggest that? entirely, idea droplet transmission goes pretty far back literature. point view that's antiquated worked little research put proving disproving it. Unvaccinated people need masks either. I've never worn one.   People giving fuck. covid numbers still decline. Even though there‚Äôs repercussions , don‚Äôt want people socialize?

I‚Äôm curious city you‚Äôre city seems trending opposite others. want talk. Let know. I'm random internet stranger always willing listen. start seeing vaccinated people dying delta strain

We have: infection severity Delta vaccinated people seems similar severity non-Delta covid unvaccinated people.

There also deaths US, although low amounts. People low body fat like got hit real hard. Funny enough wore masks people I'm from, still got it. Although im pretty sure 2019 November. 

Because start everyone clearing throats sht. Alrighty, gave go. Moderna 1 &amp; 2 couple months ago followed J&amp;J last week. approved benefits need indisputable proof disability last least another 12 months. even someone sick now, need also prove last another year qualify benefits. Back ""long covid"" became known, people worked SSA talked would tough sell enough known disease, sometimes spontaneously resolves... would mean enormous flood applications likely, lot denials. insane. aged care part first phase rollout? aware death count second VIC wave aged care? It‚Äôs worth posting twice stupid. Huh funny say that, places like Taiwan NZ priority protecting people, rather listening constant bleating economy. difference messaging stark concerning. It‚Äôs y‚Äôall!! still get infected brain fog vaccinated? 
i got it, im protected mostly hospitalization im woried brain fog Thanks mate, appreciate it. Stop fear mongering it‚Äôs it‚Äôs  Former Airman, thing.

Yes did, 2 months ago went back gym battling body year. Back feel healthier especially vaccine. doubt 30% said done every day since first day pandemic. Hang there. NYC worst it. *does* get better low? went Oklahoma pandemic honestly felt like model lol New Zealand isn‚Äôt locked all. acknowledge it‚Äôs over, I‚Äôm vaccinated feel confident I‚Äôm protected. sympathy get infected. upset 80 yr old mother. downplayed beginning refuses get vaccinated. refused medically necessary surgery potentially life threatening condition life insurance. took end life policy paid drawn along necessary powers attorney. written estate would reimburse insurance premiums. sad say need live one year policy mature? world would get effing vaccinated‚Ä¶. That's wonderful! gives hope too. people. look statistics actually interested them.  variant though? dummies loose country, producing newly mutated virus products every day. happened I'm advanced Muay Thai class gym take 9 months per cardiologist recommendation. heart rate go back two half months post covid. went back month ago like I'm starting zero  photo Johnson Merkel elbow bumping hilarious. woodworking number reasons they're inappropriate health care settings US. Starting need sterilize rubber surfaces. there's difficulty donning/doffing without self-contamination, infeasibility eyewear, visual shock patients already hospital trauma enough. Public alarm. Cost replacement filters. Difficulty fitting. Sight clearance. on. 

I like looking thinking outside box though. recover they're going preach stories goes something like ""I learned lesson I'm going teach others"" ""my recovery God looking me"".  That‚Äôs compared weren‚Äôt vaccinated. It‚Äôs orders magnitude lower 7% depends prefer disucssion general Covid news, strict scientific discussion r/COVID19. Looking stats you‚Äôre much better though, even better UK we‚Äôre opening soon. Funny brain simply refused read joke verbatim.  Epsilon variant coming you‚Ä¶ say everyone. said ""maybe"" based scientific data, provided.

Edit: also, first paper based autopsies, YES, severe covid, since dead people. actual couple groups people play here, refuse get hesitant. hesitant people subdivided multiple groups different concerns, easily addressed others. 

There also group people would get margins society. must try reach people fringes also work hesitancy much possible. feels like Detroit. time wear mask ubers two weeks. then, large groups unvaccinated adults kids getting infected camp? Many doctors scientists skeptical number Israel. used small sample size (300) released methods. result much different several studies showing high efficacy variety different angles. 

There's reason there's peer review process science. see outlier number like explanation behind it, might necessarily accurate. pretty worried parents they're definitely conservative media bubble, thankfully sister doctor listened throughout pandemic. Money. fundamentally geographic. 

And numbers accurate accounting Geography (which models forecasts do)

[University Toledo Geography researchers forecast [Excess deaths calculations huh, know people won‚Äôt get vaccinated, would want go gathering. guess I‚Äôm thinking vaccinated people don‚Äôt need worry catching passing others, exclude sister? she‚Äôs pain ass general, yeah.  True. 

I honestly never thought children‚Äôs health pandemic‚Äîall took wife first child 10 months ago. 

Every decision make air breathe based health safety child. wife vaccinated, somehow breakthrough case got us, couldn‚Äôt live knowing gave child COVID.  Tbh keep news children none honestly wear mask set example others (especially teens/kids) society together work protect one another. 

Hopefully masking gone next year youths (including yours) vaxxed up! make good points here. make asinine assumptions well, specifically last sentence regarding vaccinated elderly. point trying make? that's heresy. camp 4 day camp. happened 4 days!! 

The church made good money camp fees bet guessing concerned them. many congregants COVID exposure now, cancelling services 1 week.... nearly enough time... again, can't miss opportunity solicit donations. easier, Vietnam shares land border China, Cambodia, Laos handled pandemic better Western, developed country. seriously effectively respond outset. devastating numbers are, feel sorry decided vaccinate. one every opportunity vaccinate threw one opportunity away they're landing hospital possibly dying complications. nature natural selection taking course. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Then complaining date clearly needs pushed back further? sense all. logic Americans. happening. Vaccination consistent decline really long time.

Hopefully friend come around eventually.

Good making choice based medical science personal risk tolerance. carefully considered pros cons decision judged it. don't. COVID, there's reason assume whoever got vaccinated. dealt 2005 actually. Clinton W. Bush administrations trying prepare threat bioterrorism Congress finally created EUA program Project BioShield 2004 anthrax attacks. FDA finalized long-delayed [AVA/BioThrax EUA 2005 military finally completed AVIP vaccinations. Personally, give shit wear gas mask filters P3 layer (equivalent 99.9% particulate filtration efficiency).

What? really wear gas mask wherever go? quite badass actually. mask dude. problem screwed continue cycle endlessly variants become worse. take studies Sinovac/Delta around here, since barely cases sure hope remain controlled! yeah, they've quite rigorous scientific studies Sinovac vaccine, things get control surely data need... Yeah. boss always said ""Just wear mask, get covid. What's big deal ?""
The dude coughing terribly week. definitely got covid never got tested. still believes hype much.

Sometimes I'm angry. People cautious die, pricks easy. Didn‚Äôt what‚Äôs name get 40% vote‚Ä¶? Question masks unvaccinated people/kids, mask guidelines outdoors. know consensus virus doesn‚Äôt spread much outdoors, masks aren‚Äôt necessary outdoors. close proximity people? example, unvacc‚Äôd kid playing park 10 unvacc‚Äôd kids, other‚Äôs faces yelling laughing two hours, really matter they‚Äôre outdoors?? seems like nonsense virus would magically spread situation like this.  funny couldn‚Äôt use line going shopping last year refusing wear mask think everyone figure diffrence ""infection""/Asymptomatic, Symptomatic, Hospitalization.

When news sites want use positive title, use Symptomatic rate Delta, try strike fear heart, use infection.

Like reply above, data UK (Scotland) 79% Asymptomatic 88% Symptomatic. mose people remember high 80's number. Delta variant transfer like ""Asymptomatic Asymptomatic Symptomatic"", article say 64% infection Delta. people political party like fan sports club. stop fan play bad? stop fan coach asshole? stop fan player commits crime?

Mostly not, still supporter club.

A los ot people x-party. faces, program outcomes irrelevant. delta variant 50% infectious damaging alpha variant. alpha variant 50% infectious dangerous original virus. 

So 225% increased infection chance coupled fact variants damage. clusters people anti vaccine, anti everything. Anti mask. Anti social distancing. Probably anti hand washing (although I‚Äôm mostly joking there). 

So perfect storm stupid. pretty easy things like everyone pick groceries outside store

If everyone internet/data connections, knew use grocery store apps, servers handle load, could train workers fast enough, etc. part world starting many outbreaks linked flights UK.

Then ban them. make mistake mass importing Delta India. I‚Äôve seen enough. I‚Äôve enough this. perspective thousands matter. clean mess opinion people choose vaccine not. works low risks. 7 women got clots Johnson n Johnson vaccine. Obese, smokers, birth control, sedentary lifestyles?  vaccine gave clots! already covid? Blood clots major issue covid! Bogus!!!  tf still olympics? numbers game, percentage people needing hospitalization lower due vaxxing causing measures lifted - therefor causing higher infection numbers - may still see comparable number people ending hospital spread gets control due overall higher number infections. Yeah lot bodybuilders warm roids easier inject less pain It‚Äôs unclear Toews ever COVID, event he‚Äôs track come back next season. think important part keeping hospitalization rates death rates low. We're less 100 hospitalization rates day nation right now. That's pretty good. Basically normal flu rates. Kind amazing considering dense population is. Different applications.

My point it‚Äôs likely half people chosen get vaccinated don‚Äôt time - it‚Äôs politicization virus vaccines. NoVa yeah think they're considering that. barely even allowed hybrid end school year. seems leaders school boards content default mask mandatory position gradual way get back kids school. There's consideration may good gets us pandemic really questioning kids masks. UK 50% total population fully vaccinated. Belgium within weeks. Okay, Google.com/bro Basically bog standard ""make China look bad"" article.

Interesting figures bottom article - around 5 6% difference preventing ICU/hospitalisation/death. 

Those figures people care - particularly poorer countries access Pfizer due cold-chain requirements I‚Äôm you. 
My rule always 20 feet distanced outdoors. 

Frankly, I‚Äôve lost extreme amount respect majority world‚Äôs institutions this. 
I‚Äôve right everything pandemic, simply I‚Äôve reviewed happening, looked data, drawn conclusions. 

So yeah, people reading things, piss poor critical thinking skills / comprehension abilities. Huh til valid concerns like it‚Äôs safe get expectant mothers mothers breasts feeding. friend putting surgery scheduled second dose close date. makes sense.

What make sense multiple people said got around vaccinated people. People claim it‚Äôs really deadly, claiming it‚Äôs like flu, making unsubstantiated claims miracle cures, blah blah blah. respect people‚Äôs opinions grounded reality; respect opinions based Facebook ‚Äúresearch‚Äù YouTube conspiracy videos. Thanks tip, definitely try this!! Biden could state obvious, ‚ÄúCOVID emergency‚Äù, mandate prior full FDA approval. could prevented? would major damage matter what. wrecking havoc Texas, jabs pfizer April   Vaccines endpoint...I'm vaccinated...so I'm protected ill ever be.

That may seem selfish year protecting others good alternatives, adults get vaccine and, let's honest, already approved kids....I've already done important thing could protect them, I'm getting kind done. put number it, many years average life expectancy would trade needing wear mask? sad predictable.

Schools help virus spread kids. Sports activities help virus spread schools. kids spread parents. Anti Vax parents spread work retail locations. Apparently since cases exploding around world despite vaccinations. Yes mainly AZ. Belgium relied Pfizer seems offer protection breakthrough infection. wish true, page 50 says opposite. put number it, many deaths think would need prevent justify keeping restrictions place? true. Please make shit. Hahaha shit crazy, recruits sleeping top bunk warned jumping morning cause legs could give out. got sort cold like symptoms, hadn‚Äôt gotten sick like another 6 years Young people haven‚Äôt vaccinated. Also Covid never going away people need learn deal Could way drastically accelerate youth vaccination, full re-opening could delayed weeks? Contrary article said, think re-opening would wait high vaccination *and* upgrading school safety - latter would need done end summer.

And working hard find ways suppress Covid-19 transmission impose heavy burden people, could sustained longer term? Study South Korea Taiwan set best-in-class contact tracing system. Make huge push improve ventilation indoor air quality everywhere, schools. We're still adequately accounting airborne transmission - according one source, good ventilation could suppress transmission much 50%! unvaccinated clog healthcare system vaccianted trouble need ambulance / hospital bed get car accident, etc. Yeah, school going big problem. Antimask parents already starting hometown next year, school start September there. Way early make call yet. family friend high risk child debating completely taking daughter school it, knows it'll upset daughter, super sucky situation Ah spoken like true victim D.A.R.E. Propaganda. Dude, need get more. Pot fucking medicine dude. Fascinating watching media/journalists telling us vaccines effective, also saying need locked aren‚Äôt effective ^ 

Having bulletproof vest doesn‚Äôt mean tempt getting shot. I‚Äôd still prefer get shot, possible. one cares Lets build wall around them. Honestly point getting test mildly sick? risk going getting someone else sick, stay home 10 days. like benefits one way another know sure not. Don‚Äôt want get vaccine? get fined get putting public risk really good idea government remove remaining restrictions once.

Main drivers surge:

Delta variant introduced young travellers returning Spain Portugal.
Opening night life, one club 600 guests 160 got positive test result afterwards.

No, enjoy life Pressure *cause* mutations, *selects* mutations allowed propagate occur. important distinction. mutations occur random, likelihood mutation emerge based rate viral replication within infected rate transmission individuals - vaccines reduce things. local schools start late July masks optional everyone ages. Oh optional unvaccinated adult guests schools, too. üôÑ   Get vaccinated stay home. Anything else keep covid around longer. curiosity, reason Germany went away vaccination center strategy? seems like bit mess stressful get doses there. 

Several reasons thrown around:

- Lobbying GPs get paid services render
- Using existing infrastructure increase total vaccination capacity
- Closer relationship patients give peace mind
- Knowledge medical history prioritize, advise side effects
- Home visits, accessibility reaching out, esp. elderly

I think terrible scheduling experience could've mitigated unified booking portal like (by state/region) vaccination centers. right now, every office thing, terrible digital presence anyway. 
Nonetheless, doctors cranking jabs left right. Yes, know vaccines work people everything power downplay concerns. Glad charge real scientists take seriously.

Here Chile go news. good results hospitalization, ICU death covid19, news manufacturers China three times weaker Delta variant one dosis weaker overall Delta variant compared vaccines (that say ones). may OK unvaccinated, likelihood getting severe covid vaccination nearly nonexistent.

If can't understand vaccines change exponential curve...well quote science then...it's literally science.. NH USA vaccinated exposed say don‚Äôt even get tested, INSANE.
We‚Äôve 96 breakthrough cases month, probably never got tested I've read comments know getting downvoted, want give chance defend position. curious, low covid deaths UK need accept dropping restrictions?

Very surreal said masks weren‚Äôt effective, knowing lying seeing people weren‚Äôt capable thinking further.  Rural areas probably lower 40% clusters growing there. Lots selfish idiots little towns. Also Grove never wore masks last year, looked anyone wearing one like slime. surprised Grove cluster. Nothing documented. 

I think last 18 months taken toll mental health though, personally. Thats Im saying? Anyone attends school government job going mandated get point. surprising, anyway newsworthy? article, seems like it‚Äôs simple vaccine refusal.

That‚Äôs simplification. Vaccine refusal + refusal mask + complicating factors. 

There‚Äôs doc Tulsa area continues claim masks harmful. get book website explains why. wait, there‚Äôs more! immune supplements protect you. 

My pulmonologist Tulsa area. last appointment strongly encouraged remove mask. breathing test, staff supposedly vaccinated. None staff masked. particular doc advertises symptomatic people get tested covid office. separate waiting area sick patients similar pediatricians often do. effective something like Delta variant. 

Add social media bullshit everyone vaxxed going die within two years greater risk dying new variants you‚Äôre vaxxed, might start understand uphill battle increasing vaccination rate. 

There breakthrough covid cases vaccinated, especially areas low vaccinations. doc hospital Grove (small town, far NE Oklahoma) says quarter patients fully vaccinated. (Link post history.) expect become common. 

Vaccination area others around also vaccinated effective vaccination area many refuse take shot. 

Get vaccinated. you‚Äôre low vaccination area mask up, social distance, remain diligent hand hygiene addition getting vaccine. people still think people convinced get shots??

I think you‚Äôre basically right young healthy people getting vaccine, except don‚Äôt think makes sense young healthy people (especially 18) already recovered COVID. risk really zero, risk vaccine much.  agree liars blame. folks swallow lies.

We need ask questions like - stupid? gullible? believe politicians scientists health experts?

I think cases, likely series choices person made throughout life led accept word politician health expert. 

And think ultimately, personal responsibility still important aspect society. People need take personal responsibility behaviors. 

So, can't *only* blame liars. rarely effects You‚Äôre also leaving huge amount people unvaccinated already covid, sort protection. People always seem forget part.

Delta variants reinfecting people already COVID before. may resistance far immune.    citizens didn‚Äôt want Olympics. IOC forcing fucked live Panama, Catholic country, i'd hate tell guys theres way hell 50% population getting vaccinated fear ""mark beast"". dont know single person get vaccinated town. One thing keep mind regarding smelling smoke perfumes, molecules much much smaller COVID well fitting mask filter well may still filter COVID well. Lol really trying make sound like vaccines 100% working can‚Äôt get infected anyone haven‚Äôt vaccinated criminals. overly cautious. past year half messed people‚Äôs heads. Try patient talk sense him.  risk anti vaxers... There's people immunocompromised (cancer, transplant, etc) vaccines give protection

Wife's coworker died earlier week despite vaccinated immunocompromised (had kidney transplant before), older people get much protection vaccines course now, kids 12. Please open box. Insurance companies would love add 'reasons' deny coverage. Ovarian cancer? Denied HPV vaccine taken. Car Accident? Denied due careless speeding. 

I get saying, better educate 'punish'. You‚Äôre saying large praise US Canada‚Äôs restrictions? haven‚Äôt seen that. American centric? USA small fraction versus rest world  agree 100 percent. got vaccinated soon available I‚Äôve fully vacced months now. week stopped wearing mask stores honestly never plan wearing one again. played rules, could give Frenchman‚Äôs fuck won‚Äôt get it. Enough time passed NY everyone wanted get vacc able get it. Maybe getting sick thing left push towards getting it. son went last year. low oxygen needed oxygen steroids 5 days hospital. 4 negative covid tests, doctors said every sign it.  worried next wave. wife, me, oldest vaccinated, son get vaccinated we're still going crowds dining indoors masks us. You‚Äôre making assumption hasn‚Äôt happened yet. What's closer home immediate troubling though. Canadian rapidly approaching point pass US vaccinations despite far worse vaccine supply. eventually reopen borders fully hit mutations occur USA.

Much third world vaccinating rapidly now. US relevant since one populous countries earth like half population unvaxxed. India continue biggest concern, US probably #2 (Nigeria extremely low numbers probably fine mass vaccine rollout, Brazil rapidly vaccinating many CA/SA countries). gotten harder? Sounds like nightmare. think (the US) things right moment. learn live virus, mutates point current vaccines effective, hopefully scientists come booster shot protect us that. math, lag explain it. 

If track hospitalizations, two periods cases become 4x greater originally were, two periods hospitalizations became 2x greater originally were

This behavior would observed due vaccines reducing chance death. 
If look actually getting infected though, see growth cases older vulnerable groups. vaccines preventing infection among them.  
If cases rise groups unlikely die remain flat groups likely die, deaths continue grow slowly cases. Many universities required it. virtual option can‚Äôt medically take vaccine. science back rationale? parents struggling pandemic also ones least able afford therapy (I know there's sliding scale stuff might enough) Also pondering that. wonder already talk inside pharmaceutical companies designing vaccine optimized delta variant. Go vaccine normally microbe mutate environment getting hostile. Vaccine makes environment hostile virus. would unvaccinated cluster knowingly promoting mutations?  maybe time consider delaying full reopening date again?  Boston Thurs - Sat spent Sunday Provincetown yeah, knowing people think Texas... imagine heads exploded, heh. It‚Äôs disgusting selfish people are. Like, understand Covid likely won‚Äôt kill daughter, effects could rest life? Take logic apply family. every family's goal stop ""the system collapsing""? want live day-to-day. yea, peak covid, goal flatten curve. 18 months later abundance vaccines? Stop it. Mission trips send unvaccinated Americans directly 3rd world countries say ""death rate"", mean that?

Do mean, ""likelihood someone &lt;=40 dying infected""?

Or mean, ""proportion total covid deaths &lt;=40 age bracket""?

Two different things. latter influenced heavily relative vaccination rates. example, look [my comment done analysis 35 divider year (used CDC age brackets). shows right referring latter metric, slight increase probably due higher vaccination rates older populations rather dangerous variant.

But really know variant dangerous younger people, need answer former - likely someone &lt;35 survive infection infected? Unfortunately know get appropriate data this.  people really getting 2nd shot think one fine? That‚Äôs crazy 3rd wave? Us Dutchies already entering 4th wave. Get levelüòé Africa? mean vaccine ever 100%, sounds like fear mongering.  Whoa. lot take in. Going give re-read came across extreme pro-NPI stuff Twitter recent months (I recognise one names put here, think Eric Ding one).

It feels confusing US initial responses mess top officials telling us mask well March, CDC current advice technically correct fully take real world account (liars). feel like really good political leadership badly needed. pandemic starts medical problem leads wide variety problems, can't always focus one group experts - medical case. Good examples deciding needed closed last year. decision exactly what, timing, deal impacts gets decided politicians. states left entities open others.

Then go level &amp; compare countries without thinking culture &amp; history drive decisions. People downvoting certain possible way COVID ever hurt kids. idea might would wildly inconvenient them. shall downvote now. Yeah public policies came nowhere /S forgot bible belt certain neighbourhoods big cities. choose get vaccinated don‚Äôt really care fill hospital blocking others getting right treatment (surgeries) waiting last year for. America 3rd world country wearing Gucci belt though really.

From October 2020 December 2020, estimated 1,076 people 34 died covid, compared 159,966 35+ (0.6% 35).

From January 2021 March 2021, estimated 1,594 people 34 died covid, compared 187,281 35+ (0.8% 35).

From April 2021 June 2021, 716 people 34 died covid, compared 39,710 35+ (1.7% 35).

**The virus still overwhelmingly killing older people** \- 98% covid deaths last 3 month time slice 35+ (which using rough proxy ""past reproductive age""). small increase % deaths attributable 35 likely due high vaccination rates older populations, rather mutation suddenly made virus dangerous younger folks.

Source: downloaded analyzed [CDC provisional deaths Seems effective Pfizer preventing hospitalisations according data maybe really elderly folks got Pfizer likely bad case Covid Ok. Call want.

When last time drug company ""cured"" disease? 

All drugs see TV designed manage disease, cure it. require lifelong dosing, generate continuous revenue stream drug manufacturers.

Now vaccines Covid here. cures, agree. like MMR polio get 1 2 3 shots protected life. Instead, vaccine requires constant adjustment, boosters, etc. yearly basis. Revenue stream forever. mean‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt CLOSE science 1900s still imposed lockdowns Spanish really gone beyond point. 

The affect really attributable vaccines lowering death rate infected though. Even vaccines made people 99% less likely die infected, graph deaths would still exponential grow rate number cases do. death value would much smaller without vaccine. 

In UK, highly vaccinated older groups (which generally groups dying since start pandemic) simply seeing growth cases. 
I think UK starting see 30s 40s age group start get infected though, deaths might start rising. make mistake, that's really lag ending -- infections finally started rise older group.  headline confusing, seems convey unvaccinated people mutate virus scientifically incorrect. ""All viruses \[not\] always mutating... they're replicating"" splitting hairs bit here. right virus mutating replicating, like latency mechanisms see HIV / Herpes / whatever else, apply scenario.

If 10 cases virus, ten viruses still mutating. rate mutation sustained greater larger number infected people, negate viruses absolutely still mutating smaller pool. Lower viral titers also necessarily mean less mutation among viruses, variables hand make relationship complicated.

For worth, agree message here. reality points quite simple one might hope. quite lousy numbers US

It's like 26% country EU. government allowed nut spew whatever conspiracy shit wanted even national TV year quite uneducated easy influence citizens. Even members parliament objectively mental issues allowed whatever hey wanted live TV.

They convinced restrictions closures Fall COVID ""the global cabal led Bill Gates want control minds lives"". No, bubble okay risks, either working working home time. fully vaccinated.

The people know got covid people full pro masks preached online That‚Äôs precise phrasing meant. Clubs festivals closed probably.

Literally everyone predicted soon ended restrictions once. Ok, wasn‚Äôt talking unvaccinated people contact children immune compromised people, talking vaccinated people don‚Äôt wear masks anymore. Lots upvotes comment initially CCP bots zoomed in. Can't West's lockdowns ending anytime soon... meaningful level. Challenges mandates start seeing courtrooms soon think may see rulings mandating drug doesn‚Äôt full approval FDA unconstitutional. 

The FDA needs expedite process really can‚Äôt strengthens case block mandate

I‚Äôm full mandates it‚Äôs important understand constitutional rights law don‚Äôt get scrapped virus budget Sinopharm vaccine, lucky me. Really hoping get booster non-Chinese vaccine sometime soon They're real people feelings, fringe minority cannot expect vast, vast majority endure major life restrictions behalf. Lol
You aren‚Äôt gonna convince ppl, pent fear last year turned covid personal identity, feeding emotion rational science, thought. They‚Äôve become ppl hate, trumpeters/covid deniers act exact way except opposite fashion. you, I‚Äôve gotten shots, It‚Äôs time live life, vaccines never going 100% anyone thought that, well fools. 25,000 people socially distanced wearing noticeable surge afterparties, February 99% people video get vaccinated. People traveled across entire country. not.

It's one 177 people going die.

It's one 177 people risk catching virus 99% survival rate. holy fuck make event 2022 ffs care cases rising unless it‚Äôs leading significant increase hospitalizations deaths?

Fact: nearly 100% current hospitalizations unvaccinated adults. I‚Äôm protecting them. forum seems never happy. First, people saying bringing athletes world cause Japan hit another wave Covid foreigners coming see events live. spectators allowed, Japanese public affected they'll still able watch Olympics TV. people still upset? Allegedly hope. literally story last year nurse reporting patients shouting Covid hoax hospital. fervently believed intubated died. 

There's saving people. 
The propaganda deep. Yes, tested. negative. Thank asking though ü•∞. unvaccinated countries? Best luck guys

Hope parents don‚Äôt find out

And do......yeah GL, going need Government spend months years make society resilient take action preventing mutation future crisis that's ""business""....  news makes sense (for NK leadership) want citizens think got vaxed considering bible evangelicals like website's terms service. Everybody goes end says ""I read that"", none actually have. think US FDA/CDC worried give guidance people take meaning vaccine unsafe. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs terrible advice. Exactly! 
Choosing one another unavoidable compromise make. Yep, going zero Covid really strict travel like Israel, fair enough. logic blocking travel vaccinated region world, soon moreso.  stuff specifically think specifically asking people do? want stuff forever 

You know me. revealed anything myself. know arrived conclusion? fear gone straight thing I‚Äôm saying this

I doubt it. Yeah. like Tokyo getting much broadcast rights. Taxpayers eating 500 billion yen, easy. Without isolating 10 days? Soon apparently. Minister Transport today allowed fully vaccinated British come back Amber countries without isolating July 19th. said looking allowing non-UK fully vaccinated would give details coming weeks. seems secular countries handling *better* religious ones. http://www.aimovement.org/ got downvoted -70 news subreddit accused misleading saying ""delta impact vaccine efficacy"". Americans seem really hostile info, point view someone UK absolutely baffled reaction--I stating addition facts someone else gave delta, completely accepted knowledge strongly playing national considerations around covid strategy outlook.

When New York Times runs article delta, primary Facebook responses laugh reacts. 

It concerns bit Americans ready done whole thing they'll attack deride plain facts they're falsehoods. People totally nuts.

The scenery nice though. would get vaccine something says one country has? shows outdoor transmission still possible. infinitely safer inside, competely risk free like people say. Nope. I'm recalling then-infant it. Myself, husband 3 year old colds would needed doctors' visits all. known RSV family infant caught well. youtheotube2, theoretical individual(s) ""no contact"" children describing. Coming home? England? Umm think already moved took over. Around 16th probably pints celebrate. think issue unlike US, EU China, Japan domestic vaccine production, stand line like everybody else. virus attack brain cells directly - cross blood brain barrier? can‚Äôt open article right phone. Sorry obvious question least they're sticking libs  really matter. 99% Covid deaths unvaccinated people. anti-vaxxer nutjobs take vaccine reason all. refuse principal. ~~hurting~~ killing themselves.

2) Globally: major health organizations (WHO) declare over. 
3) Redditally: someone Wrong Party says still going on. pretty much N95s? understand need cautious, don‚Äôt open vaccinated tested Europeans? chance bring virus variant concern must much smaller average unvaccinated American taking domestic flight. leaders agreed, would implemented now. Ok good luck also really depends area. San Francisco county may 1.36 doses administered per person Shasta County (Redding) .67 doses per person means still areas it‚Äôs risky. get claim vaccine protects long term effects? loop allergy sufferers .. Every day pray Flying Spaghetti Monster. aren‚Äôt though.

My wife ICU physician outside Covid almost never divert. Even bad flu season hospital didn‚Äôt fill.

Multiple different hospitals past decade it‚Äôs never like last winter, even close.

Did see traveling nurses/Docs getting paid?

Did see DoD FEMA deployed military doctors military nurses throughout country first time ever? 

It well beyond ICU capacity many regions. really sick people flooding hospitals (which also bad thing, wife spent great deal time clinic week making house calls patients couldn‚Äôt telehealth scared going hospital (and there‚Äôs zero extra money house cells, even extra expense lost time)). don‚Äôt care enough keep guard forever tiny risk 

If would never leave house again

Final thing I‚Äôm saying matter going round circles weird subtly racist rhetoric? Viruses don‚Äôt give shit. mutate randomly well. happen anywhere infected individual.  said covid general, never gonna stop covid, let spread use natural selection? minimizing damage loss human life. Mandates lead less cases hence less mutations, making easier turn epidemic endemic  


You though works already working get vaccine odds extremely favor won‚Äôt ever severe group strange national mask mandate Delta spreading quickly Oh mean anything like that. kind btw 
I think another topic study history I'm gonna shut since anything Fellow GJ person then? Yea, everyone gone mad. still Country Jam? ever loving fuck everyone thinking? Exactly. Schengen/UK/Ireland want go US, first go covid hotspot 14 days fly directly US.

Which bigger risk factor spread infection: 25,000 people socially distanced wearing masks, 91,000 people distanced wearing masks? Go ahead, take time. anyone saw coming.    original premise individual outcomes predictable don‚Äôt know enough virus

Yes. That's said. objective real fact. learned lot genetic sequence SARS-COV2 far.. admirable progress is,. still know enough able accurately predict individual outcomes. (a big part outcomes based virus ALONE. many factors (Age, medical-history, complications, genetics, blood type, etc). We're still learning things. That's science works. process continual learning. ""Statistically, experience atypical unique.""

Agreed. never said wasn't. ""Science would say don‚Äôt predicate solutions outlier cases.""

Also agreed. We're here. (In fact that's exactly said said:.. ""Generalized statistics accurately predict individual outcomes."" "" say that‚Äôs foolish""

I never said that?.. "" you‚Äôd admit outlier cases negative reactions vaccine require us stop vaccine - surely wouldn‚Äôt say that.""

You correct. would (nor ever) said that. ""Problem is, instead thinking critically, cherry picking science fits narrative dismissing science doesn‚Äôt.""

No?. I'm not. 

Generalized statistics that:.. GENERALIZED. 

If population 1 million people,. say certain outcome possible 1% cases,. means 1 million people,. going 10,000 people negative outcome. 

But mean know (EXACTLY) 10,000 people (individually) going be. part could random (or (yet) enough information). . (You may know enough situation able accurately predict 10,000 individuals be). 

That's situation find in. Science good.. perfect. ""good"" still better nothing all.  disagree, hasn‚Äôt much discussion it, part point making. state baseless opinions want, it‚Äôs hard imagine cost 2 weeks quarantine international arrivals higher ongoing short term productivity losses, long term health-related productivity costs, death toll, healthcare costs virus significantly expensive damaging flu already 87 billion+ annual price tag.   ‚Ä¶ nah. shouldn‚Äôt. Kids can‚Äôt get vaccine? empathy. Adults can‚Äôt get medical reasons? empathy. Everyone else? sooner die sooner rest us safe. really mask requirement you‚Äôre worried about, related restrictions? get it, keep saying ""Could"" ""Is"".

Anything could happen, also restaurant small recycle air. big thing HVACs early way making sure filters replaced/switched different ones increase rate exchange air. 

I get talking specific restaurant, anecdote. Yes general people researching stuff depth widely weird uninformed opinions, yeah restaurants prob wrong.

I talking really. Also no, airborne can't go anyway. goes air currents lead it, plexi glass stops changes direction air currents, decent HVAC place recycling quickly. 

But difficult discuss, people many anecdotes people jump conclusions. never preventing spread 100%, reduction chance really end amount risk.

But agree, people understand go guidelines hard headed. exercised immediately following dose Pfizer, fine. But, suppose mileage may vary. know give vaccine free gop would them. fact shared poor people main argument Republicans vaccination.

if charged $50 shot wealthy could get vaccinated, repubs money would banging doors shot poor, ones article , would cuss govt helping pay it. ask question? think bribe them. vaccine hesitant people know don‚Äôt care lottery $50 payout California.

They‚Äôre concerned potential health risk taking vaccine, children take vaccine.

Look, I‚Äôm vaccinated, get it. I‚Äôm healthcare provider, one ones offered vaccine early January. first person know take vaccine. It‚Äôs scary one first, hesitant time too. remember trying much research could booking first shot January 4th. time, every article could find said safe. Reddit, fact sub said safe, safety trials comprehensive conclusive. Everyone said potential side effect vaccine would maybe anaphylactic shock, would occur first half hour (later shortened 15 mins) would monitored time let go home. told cleared first half hour, would good. ton googling time definitely don‚Äôt remember coming across mention blood clots myocarditis. granted, took Moderna isn‚Äôt implicated either two potential side effects, researching vaccines would remembered safety trials said anything bloods myocarditis.

And it‚Äôs come post-vaccination anaphylactic side effects I‚Äôm first half hour aren‚Äôt possible side effects. see side effects linked second shot. Articles announcing said effects say found ‚Äúsurprising link‚Äù conditions vaccine. means wasn‚Äôt told truth. safety trials weren‚Äôt thorough enough catch things. Either way, it‚Äôs inarguable unexpected side effects emerged beyond time frame told.  Wanting wait see isn‚Äôt absurd position.

I got second shot Moderna January 29th. remember wondering pharma developers insisted immunity potential side effects condition vaccine distribution. saw 25 companies testing vaccine candidates humans getting ready immunise hundred millions people products shown work, question pays claims damages case side effects tricky point supply unique situation **we company simply cannot take risk ... four years vaccine showing side** effects,‚Äù Ruud Dobber, member Astra‚Äôs senior executive team, told Reuters.

Source: they‚Äôre saying wanted immunity protect compensate people side effects show FOUR YEARS. Four years! whole thing ‚Äúif don‚Äôt experience side effects right away, you‚Äôre good. Vaccines simply don‚Äôt exhibit side effects later that. That‚Äôs vaccines work‚Äù wasn‚Äôt entirely truthful confident long term safety.

And wonder. get develop kind illness four years require hospitalization expensive treatment resulting vaccine, vaccine makers won‚Äôt support you. Health insurance also cover covid vaccine side effects. you‚Äôre left liability own? people pushed vaccinate via peer pressure going suffer health effects? No, suffer yourself. going financially support treatment neither vaccine developers health insurance willing accountable for? No, financial risks bear. alone suffer potential risks vaccines, shouldn‚Äôt alone get decide whether it‚Äôs risk you‚Äôre willing take? one tell they‚Äôre going put money mouths are. least caught covid young person, health risks small covid treatment still covered government funding, vaccine side effect treatment covered one. Besides, already caught covid last fall literally symptom lost smell taste. fever, coughing, even tinge lethargy. positive test loss taste smell, wouldn‚Äôt havent even noticed infection. recovered patient natural immunity, vaccines offered little additional benefit, incurring potential risks side effects. I‚Äôm sure taking vaccine reasonable risk assessment, yet took anyway. 

Anyway, check High school senior Emma Burkey received ‚Äúone done‚Äù Johnson &amp; Johnson coronavirus vaccine March 20, within two weeks induced coma following seizures clotting making slow recovery, recently transfered hospital rehabilitation center, first round bills totaled $513,000. 18-year-old‚Äôs family friends Las Vegas area started GoFundMe account help medical expenses rare vaccine **Burkey‚Äôs family can‚Äôt look J&amp;J cover medical costs picked insurance 2005 law -- extended last year include Covid-19 pandemic -- shields manufacturers health-care providers state federal liability instances public health bioterrorism emergencies.**

Her gofundme linked article. vaccine side effect cost $513,000 treat, yet gofundme managed raise less $60,000. pharma company developed vaccine willing risk liable, insurance companies aren‚Äôt willing risk liable, aren‚Äôt individuals allowed reject vaccine also risk liabilities? shame hesitant wanting assume full liability, mot shaming pharma insurance companies willing take risks?

Why isn‚Äôt everyone pushing others vaccinated pitching gofundme show faith support? vaccine hesitant see this. see risks taking vaccine understated, even guaranteed confidence risks shown safety trials. Pfizer says they‚Äôre ‚Äúlooking into‚Äù side effects now, didn‚Äôt look started pushing everyone get vaccinated unearned sense confidence? insist safety trials told full story it‚Äôs clear not?

So no, offering someone $50 get vaccinated lottery isn‚Äôt going much convince someone concerned health safety. every time try tell they‚Äôre hesitant, get told they‚Äôre 5G selfish trump-worshiping morons simply playing politics big babies. feels like you‚Äôre listening them, you‚Äôre interested pummeling straw man address concerns earnest good faith attempt empathize source hesitancy.

And say ought basically forced punitive social engineering measures take vaccine don‚Äôt feel comfortable safe taking feels like bullying shaming instead simply addressing concerns treating like human beings. 

So no, don‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôve made honest attempt understand concerns. feels like would rather tilt straw man you‚Äôve constructed honest conversation them. Thank you. makes lot sense.
Oh tried, felt bad shamed getting it, seems like they're going budge. So, 98% survivability rate seems really good odds making fine contacting virus. Kinda like regular flu season. rest, really seems really pissy mood feel like thinking common sense today. day... may mistakened, tho highly doubt it. Good luck God bless Ok, quick estimation 4% off. detract point whatsoever. Pfizer studies children going? Worrisomely, heard much lately (though could byproduct trying avoid COVID-related news). Bodily autonomy people afraid vaccine. mind long people keep living vaccine staying isolated wearing mask. would shocked US booster doses aren‚Äôt least recommended certain groups going fall/winter (maybe 60+, people certain conditions, etc). We‚Äôll see month two though. (Angry stupid anti-vaxxer sounds) can‚Äôt find it, thought announced September target date bilaterally lifting travel bans? mean, wait study published course, efficacy really fall 30% 6 months, ""of course asking"" population benefit well bottom line. No, misunderstood it. Rhetorical questions questions asker *expect* get answer. mean *can not* answer them. Nty, I‚Äôll follow CDC‚Äôs guideline. sure recoup costs... maybe hotels housing athletes? Mostly mask requirement. end last school year, following restrictions remained:

* Mask mandate 
* Event cancellations 
* Socially distanced graduation 
* Junior senior prom moved outdoors (technically mask mandate, reportedly one followed it; go) 
* non-athletic clubs moved virtual format 
* Virtual education option remains want (this likely hold next year since governor literally said would stop allowing it... though *could* change things get really bad) I'll take 10. Sentience, apply anti-vaxxers though. lack ability reason think. They've recently started recommending teens get vaccinated, even though they've months it. say fault things gotten point. vaccinated teens too, they'd near 75% vaxxed since teens make large % population. can't even come together countries, least countries. It‚Äôs exactly consensus it‚Äôs preferred term many cases. Native American term white people came fallen favour recent years. two common terms used indigenous people ‚ÄúAmerican Indian‚Äù ‚ÄúIndigenous American‚Äù although actual tribal names obviously best all. part UN. it‚Äôs budget comes donations. can‚Äôt go buy vaccines, vaccinating 100M people would bankrupt it. drug companies given drug poorer countries?

Because still fulfilled orders rich ones ?

I'm pretty anti capitalist (mainly globalised unregulated part it, I'm fine people trading), caricature helping doctors talking about! Herd Immunity...to common sense! terrified? know viruses give long term symptoms right? Like cold flu. Also number people litany symptoms hard ascertain exaggerated media bc control studies No, people took vaccine 1/10 get it, people sick, 1/10 vaccinated. could mean, example, 100 people vaccinated 100 people not, 10 200 got sick, 1 fully vaccinated, means 1/10 break mean 10% vaccinated ppl going sick. appreciate good intent what‚Äôs point vast majority people absolutely need wearing masks, likely won‚Äôt. Especially backwards state like Arkansas graph Uk hospitalizations? cant find one bet healthy young adult won‚Äôt die Thanks! would thought? Real-life DLC it‚Äôs mRNA vaccines, could booster data suggests it‚Äôs still neutralizes virus cases. Nothing pisses people getting sick possibly suffering lifelong complications, (further) diminished mental capabilities lung damage.

Sure shows guys superior are! /s sure that? Avg cases went 95 May 380 today. That's 400% increase. government one letting kids get vaccinated? can't one hand say want increase restrictions protect unvaccinated kids, also letting get vaccinated. 80% reached end July. lucky 70% reached. 87% people willing vaccinate 87% eligible people. 0.87*0.87=76% therefore ceiling people vaccinated, sure take longer. He‚Äôs wrong sense become like coronaviruses get us sick. It‚Äôs ‚Äúforever pandemic‚Äù - eventually sufficient immunity make cold like coronaviruses. wouldn‚Äôt call pandemic. yes, mutation COVID limits. would critically evaluate statements- sensationalized made many incorrect predictions. Everyone gets free vaccine though. standing US soil vaccine administered think that. Seems like sense isn‚Äôt normal Hold responsible associated costs actions. Seriously, responsible actions cornerstone republican. issue You‚Äôre 20 times less likely catch covid compared unvaccinated. covid, long covid symptoms. Patterson, used family example, even **perfectly healthy vaccinated people carry virus asymptomatic minimally symptomatic COVID-19 goes state probability spreading virus grows higher transmittable delta variant play,** especially 65 percent Arkansans still fully explained higher numbers COVID-19 patients continuing hospitalized put ventilators, **predicting next several months much rougher first 18 months pandemic trend continues.** didn't. understand great Republican fear state. believe lose homes, guns, savings, &amp; rights unless vote red. Lucifer could option &amp; would vote due fear Democrats, fear other. many reasons distrust government, including fact US government committed genocide them. Unless reason believe given different vaccine white people absolutely smart taking vaccine allowing another genocide.

Under Trump could understand exercised caution since sent body bags place PPE reason believe Biden would allow sent faulty vaccines. Stick man dying covid.  Definitely better nothing. I'm still convinced coworker killed horrific motorcycle accident actually died covid since completely unaware symptoms. Yet goes cause death. Seriously, wtf Kids getting vaccines later year Well, looks like article got removed - seems like answer no. Thanks congrats you, sure heck easy. Smart US one highest rates vaccinations?  ""Vaccine passport"" misleading since meant normal businesses domestically enforce verification persons vaccinated. certainly apply nations right enact regulations requiring proof vaccination foreigners. Meaning unvaccinated wants travel nations allowed unless they're vaccinated. go pharmacy. went two different chains 2 shots. happen times. Seems even mentioning person results deleted messages lately yet tell No, certainly not. would significantly help prevent Covid spread. hold caution account since many citizens aren‚Äôt vaccinated. time, understand people coming from, even personally disagree. 

Tbh, though, California‚Äôs hospitals overburdened probably need thinking masks. think long enough study.

I enough issues anxiety need anymore health issues. absolutely clue point trying make. situations everything open cases grow fast.  ""Dolsten said early data company's studies shows third booster dose generates antibody levels five 10-fold higher second dose, suggesting third dose offer promising protection.""  main transmission source indeed droplets, touching surfaces. breathing something similar mouth God‚Äôs ears.

That month, Chinese wildlife conservation scientist made routine visit Huanan market tracked two years confirmed still selling wild animals poor hygienic conditions, team later wrote Scientific Reports journal.And Nov. 19, 2019, Wuhan Institute Virology held annual staff safety training session.

What got annual flu shots aren‚Äôt getting Covid vaccine?  booster effect them? get flu shots anymore? SHIT ONE CARES READING THIS. Would like get shot 3 4? rather let constituents die show even hint co-operation Biden

So basically *are* stupid, *completely* stupid. know, can't fix stupid. 

Death though. Good, let's waste resources dummies. can't say long one might covid symptoms vaccinated goes. 

Jmo, think could different effects various people. 
I copd, chronic nerve damage, might hit harder others really, im young healthy ish, roommate everyone ik young healthy took second shot ahit threw us loop.

VERY WORTH IT, though, hope ppl get it. children vaccinated fall, think pretty much US outside wearing masks doctors offices airplanes. Everything isolated spikes rural medically underserved counties poor vaccination rates. gone herd immunity containment , ppe vaccinations Trump cult knows much anyone else. 

Containment how? States ove US shut economies forced people remain locked doors much possible. didn‚Äôt curb spread? knowingly let roll country. mask , gather rallies, don‚Äôt get shot. Deliberately spread bad disease. 

I also remember protest riots last year completely disregarding covid precautions masks social distancing name social justice.

Were part trump cult spitters charged assault. them?

Spitting someone literally assault. needs said louder hoosiers MO continue get vaccinated governor Hee-Haw keeps trying undermine vaccination effort callous effort keep stumpjumpers voted office thinking good choice utter moron. Children known vector illness spread. good. kids safe wonder got first 2 Pfizer doses employer march, 
Then changed jobs Late April, would need use new jobs insurance go back last job site got jabs grocery-store pharmacy? Would need mix versions jabs got via taking new jobs pharmacies offerings Moderna version? Also shitiy feel morally getting extra booster 2 depending roll out? tough questions many, I'd take third booster likely 4th end year unless things get really hand. Thats really. BEST WISHES one human another, BEST WISHES! That‚Äôs great all, problem (at least U.S.) large percentage population won‚Äôt even take first dose! foundation issue. Still, looks like target vulnerable population booster shot, definitely help keep hospitalized down.  cour$e a$king. Oh get yeah arguing semantics lol issue anything really said lol.

Anyway though good one! know NYC big push vaccinate homeless people. It‚Äôs great reach site. vaccinated people traveling AZ knocked six bit moderna second dose nothing hurt arm make bit sleepy night! robust study eliminates screening CDC-defined COVID-19 symptoms (fever, fatigue, chills, myalgia, congestion, cough, loss smell, shortness breath, sore throat, nausea, diarrhea) temperature required HCP, rapid nasopharyngeal testing positive. Additionally, invitations asymptomatic bilateral nares testing provided weekly randomly selected HCP (approximately 1000 [10%] per week week December 13, 2020, approximately 2500 [25%] weekly thereafter). Masks ‚Äúauthoritarian‚Äù. 

The lockdowns *voluntary*. Companies could choose in-person shit. Government services like schools run agencies run elected officials. 

Nobody made anything. don‚Äôt go store don‚Äôt like mask rules. want go store. freedoms restricted way. Meanwhile hundreds thousands Americans died thing you‚Äôre happy downplay prove point. taking huge leaps assume everyone gets Covid brain damage. 

‚ÄúOne main issue hypoxia. body struggling take oxygen, different areas body starved proper amount oxygen. occur brain result severe COVID-19.‚Äù

The odds kid getting ‚Äúsever Covid‚Äù super super super low. source say asymptotic kids get brain damage Nice. wife works school, we're probably getting first shots two weeks. Covid infections found number mammals: apes Old World monkeys, mink, domestic dogs cats, ferrets, pigs, rabbits, deer. Reusable respirators.

Like I've outfited immediate family since March 2020 reusable respirators. point even now, reusable respirators widespread use among healthcare workers even suggestions along publication detailed calculations actual monetary savings ridiculed ignored. No, think you‚Äôre rude

Not surprised get called double condescending behavior.  anything like mine, throws hissy fit worth dealing with.  great paper providing broad overview shooting various conspiracy theories. I'll optimistic say rural county live around 50% inhabitants get vaccinated.

Now 99% people even wearing mask taking kind precaution see public.

Delta going run idiots like hot knife butter.   find hard say fwiw: 

- Infected kids don‚Äôt get seriously ill often infected adults do.

- fraction infected kids get seriously ill though.

- people getting infected today U.S. unvaccinated. 

- kids unvaccinated.

- COVID-19 contagious ever been. (We used talk 10-15 minutes exposure concern, we‚Äôre talking seconds.) 

- kids vaccinated, infections disproportionately occur kids.

- small fraction large enough number large number. Even kids get seriously ill, many infected many suffer.

- context discussion school, large number unvaccinated kids Yeah. Thanks backing up. Since they're dry storage plastic item people assume forever storage, case. guidance masks cover use higher filtration masks.

So pretty much ours: worthless.   countries Europe do, Greece example. Naturally take Tylenol anything reduce fever? here. widespread denial airborne transmission 100% decision financial interests, covering PPE supply failures, abdication responsibility. think authors missing simple fact there's never going perfect time this. 

Will people chance get vaccinated yet see adverse outcomes this? Sure. said, let's think happen ""just wait bit longer"" get true vaccine open season: people start sounding alarm immunocompromised, breakthrough infections, items endless checklist sub-populations Covid could theoretically impact. 

The UK's vaccination effort truly world-leading. time move period mass restrictions one society learns live disease admittedly pose amount risk select populations foreseeable future.  electrostatic charge makes N95s effective smallest particles (less 0.3 microns) longer guaranteed approximately 5 years manufacture.

Could still effective? Probably.

""It's little wet! still good! still good!"" really wish could share optimism. hope humanity respond shared crisis gone forever. data shows 18% chance severe COVID (unvaccinated). US previous variants we‚Äôve seen 40% reduction severe symptoms vaccinated, would put near 10% infected vaccinated. 

Depending age variant get numbers might change. 

If you‚Äôre vaccinated worried protecting area low community transmission COVID I‚Äôd imagine wouldn‚Äôt need worry all. 

Only assess level comfort.  Right? Like wtf point vaccine live returning normal? make sure ask said people felt covid hoax first asking? feel like might skew data bit  Zero. them. could even dangerous mutations it‚Äôs said done argument makes sense. sides eat, sleep shit too. fight covid vaccine can‚Äôt fight stupidity  People make argument time scientists STOPPED developing treatments vaccines current vaccines came out. case - people hyper focused researching ways beat covid whole time. way go back 2020 because, time, covid completely brand new one knew treat it.

But overall moving direction. states lifted mandates either part full. people get vaccinated, safer everyone.

I'm reminded one main public problems, stopping spread water born diseases people didn't/still want accept drinking water contaminated poop.

I read couple studies 10 years ago heavily suggested influenza also airborne. result complete denial. vaccines FDA approved mandatory. It‚Äôs matter time. I‚Äôm military can‚Äôt wait till make everyone it. anti-vaccine bullshit stupid annoying. looked away relaxed mind getting vaccine..she wiped arm said ok done. first shot ive ever gotten didnt feel it. trying sound cool w.e legitly didnt feel Millions years later... ""See, that's talking about"" That‚Äôs ridiculous! 10 yo lived 88 yo?! just, sorry grandma might get infected bc cares kids sick? Private Parts fear virus country struggling get vaccines. 4% vaccinated. Delta everywhere. set free? =( think hes reading comments hes realizing one stick hot potato ass sick joke military? lol? think people get symptoms end breakthrough case, even symptoms would generally milder last long. ok. covid hit remembered tight packed together huge basketball gyms..like nuts buts shoulder shoulder someone bitched would say werent assigned personal space. first weeks military feel like cattle herded moved one area next get vision/hearing/ blood piss work done vaccinations haircuts uniforms. 

Im surprised media navy thing broke covid rampaging military military supports vaccinations?

Then pentagon need make mandatory? Good you! amazing him.

I planned quit eight weeks 18 months+. reasoning you. Can't wait little ones get vaccines.   Choir 3/4 people go infected. That's enough evidence me. think it...i havent sick since military wife several times..holy shit. Well that's one way solve overpopulation. get 16 shots sign waiver take pink pill infect virus showed swallowed gave white pill told move along.. drill sgt saying white pill cures virus fingernails fall dont take white one.

Some dumbass dropped started freaking found took picking up..those floors nasty Whose say maybe wanted couldn‚Äôt get due health reasons? Would deaths matter? Reopening based vaccination level logical choice. Restrictions can't left place forever protect small minority. look data see case numbers matter much anymore hospitalizations deaths still low vaccine works. Taken together, means high cases numbers among healthy people actually great thing recover immune long enough get vaccine. England must close herd immunity now, goal reopening completely.  Good thing hoax b actually affect /sss Ah yes, misleading title clicks, mandatory MILITARY PERSONNEL.

Nothing wrong that, that's fine. Ordinary citizens dont sign dotted line subjected medical procedures will. doesn‚Äôt apply vaccines. Mandatory vaccines legal since least 1905. military anti-vaxxer automatically generalled (if term). Yeah exactly, going live restrictions anyway, there's need everybody it.  Well escalated quickly refer case theUS early January, peak 300,000 per day. observationally, noticed even local level. drove around wealthy part city, one wearing mask peak infections; however poorer areas almost complete compliance. wonder affluent ambivalent believe throw money problem affects (better insurance, better healthcare access, paid time rest recover, etc.). US military going wait 10 years 10-year studies long-term effects. Yep 70% recovered fine  think part difference could population density, UK 280 people per km^2 US 33 people per km^2 .

Once full FDA approval, sure military include it. US troops able deploy overseas without proof COID-19 vaccine, certain.

The UK 6 month quarantine pets brought UK elsewhere. make citizens quarantine 2 weeks coming back country. way would let random airman get away anti-vaxxer way would US military retain person:

To make long story short, moved new complex Bay Area, California back May/June 2020 rents fairly depressed whole covid thing. lease coming end year checked going rates almost fell chair. I'm paying around 2700 month similar units right going HIGH 3000s touching 4000. like place really want move too, really going crazy rent hike new lease? know specific data, British Prime Minister believes increase deaths high increase cases, lift lockdown two weeks. Lol, one shot pissed themselves, babies can't handle 2. still EUA.

By law, cannot mandate EUA shot, heard.

Once becomes fully approved, Military absolutely mandate it: otherwise, US military stationed overseas NATO countries mandate COVID vaccination (and already thing, soon variants become ever nastier; think: R0 10+ variants hit military age people 10x hard happens now). remember Chinese researchers saying thing year ago.

So what? end day health experts governments need put considerations perspective well. live northeast? California? wife ended hospital March due pneumonia common COVID symptoms. 

They tested 8 times course days, negative. seemed like be. ton tests eventually kind shrugged shoulders said ""maybe inhaled something got type infection."" Gave oxygen steroids fully recovered 2 3 weeks. 

Still lots nasty stuff there. talking eventually learn live covid around year ago. 

No matter reopening happens would exit wave vaccine decliners unlucky catch disease. Waiting second dose vaccine take like 90%-95% means reopening late autumn/winter would also lead nastier surge non-covid respiratory illness worst possible moment, way you‚Äôll keep compliance restrictions spring 2022. Maybe argue another weeks restrictions folk simply won‚Äôt stand much longer, vulnerable high vaccine coverage.

That's big exaggeration. Koreans take masks coffee shops, restaurants, oftentimes church. Mask usage rates higher US, major gaps.

They don‚Äôt matter governments think terms populations. You‚Äôre individual though, sure you‚Äôre endorsing way think doesn‚Äôt care you, personally, live die long don‚Äôt represent large enough trend. Taken together, means high cases numbers among healthy people actually great thing recover immune long enough get vaccine.

What ridiculous statement wrong many ways. High case rates means opportunities mutate create variants. Unvaccinated people infected much susceptible long hauling covid, even mild cases. Infected people infect people. Even healthy people die covid. need reasons high case numbers aren‚Äôt good England must close herd immunity now, goal reopening completely.

So metric herd immunity literally rate spread, replication number R0. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs determined. goal reopening herd immunity achieved you‚Äôve contradicted opening position agreed me.

Thanks replying. wonder would‚Äôve changed friends reaction it. know everyone reacts differently. never get reactions flu shots tdap shots. reading people‚Äôs experience vaccine, past reactions flu shots aren‚Äôt good indicator may fare Covid vaccines. UK less 2k/day cases May, 10 deaths day. Two months later, 25k/day cases 18 deaths day. Barely increase deaths all. long significant population anywhere refuses vaccination access vaccination, continuous opportunity mutations effect children.

Otherwise they‚Äôre forced compete companies couldn‚Äôt care less accommodating smaller, vulnerable populations. Haha, school isn‚Äôt even requiring masks anymore, much less three feet. anyone listened rule anyway. Lambda variant

It's around since last summer. would concern? variant first identified Peru summer 2020, according World Health Organization, it‚Äôs around roughly year. June 15, 29 countries reported cases, said, accounting increasing share cases South American countries like Argentina imagine faces FDA approves vaccinations makes mad billions people want vaccine don‚Äôt live us can‚Äôt get it. good choose disobey think it‚Äôs cool stick libs scientists. Quick onset longterm consequences too. know Facebook alternative view hope demand surgeons dentist stop wearing masks treating family - let's face it, think masks good know? Find one knows truth? Haven‚Äôt stopped yet. really getting close booking plane tickets month ago‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs gonna wait longer guess army sick army can't fight. long history army's getting rekd everyone sickipoo. toilet paper thing issue supply chain, issue temporary, extreme panic. People suddenly shitting often Covid. demand same, simply steady/predictable previously. minor inconvenience spoiled population.

Lumber? Sure, people suddenly fuck ton free time less income. Surprise surprise, bunch DIY home improvements. 1:1000 would devastating.

It may much risk single person population level - terrible. Also false negatives Covid tests pretty crazy, like 20% Delta different Gamma. Plasma previous infection Gamma signifcantly worse Delta due different two variants are. almost opposite ends variant family tree.

I hope world get vaccines South America even larger wave. get too?

Even though would never publicly say it. UK cases currently around 25-30k per day around 25-30 deaths per day. lot lower vaccination started ~300 deaths per day case rate.

The UK spaced vaccines 12 weeks apart, vaccines really work delta shots. Add fact UK supply constraints - recently got 18 year olds. Another factor AZ good mRNA. US of.

My nightmare variant vaccines aren‚Äôt effective. That‚Äôs don‚Äôt get news story. isn‚Äôt new. thought military would‚Äôve mandated hospitals. agree choice to, Biden issue executive order declaring critical national security bypassing informed consent. understand logic since president declare national emergency don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs decision one man make. guess they‚Äôre trying plant idea started within military EO, it‚Äôs presented supporting military leaders. Ever since mask mandate lifted forgot COVID even existed. remember everyone knew testing positive, including myself. It‚Äôs months since I‚Äôve known someone it. think mean conjecture anecdotal live Brazil, got Janssen shot yesterday. Wondering batch‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt think batches delivered one, so.., sub getting doomerish again. Couple months ago everyone opening up. Yes covid vaccine EUA actually need presidential waiver mandate it. fluff article discussing making mandatory authority (ie, full FDA approval). say fluff practically foregone conclusion. way help prevent happening. Almost like preventative method help protect you. Ahhhh damn nice would be? Good question. never answer. this, gun confiscation, nothing.  source?   Don‚Äôt play ‚Äúpoor Japanese government, IOC forced hand‚Äù narrative. Japanese government **absolutely** deserves much blame. They‚Äôve done *nothing* right. toothless half assed ‚Äústate emergencies‚Äù name alone, *travel campaign* (yes, really) campaign encourage eating (again, *yes, really*), blaming foreigners, never forcing work home, could go on. That‚Äôs even mentioning piss poor way vaccines handled. **no** preparation beforehand. doses give handed local governments figure plans own. plan settled ‚Äúget voucher mail, come‚Äù almost exclusively people 65+ last week two. Welcome reddit  ""Clap hands everybody...everybody clap hands.""

Lamar Latrell javelin throw win! Think holdup fda thing. gonna hapoen friends long described normal-looking people ""Cleveland hot"" think really good case made also ""Oklahoma hot."" Cleveland hot probably also hotter Oklahoma hot, tbh. ....what? That's anecdottal means. Good luck forcing entire population guy. Get nicely cut hair! Ur dying bro Unfortunately, stupid ones got father killed. pandemic never ends find vaccinated males get infected able keep 'happy rod' up? what? Good bot money come vaccine research? breakdown? much vaccine nationalism people feeling entitled front queue paid?

One approach Global Health Service (like UK NHS). would need funded countries wish participate, contributing set % GDP.

This fund could used contribute towards, health campaigns, co-ordinated buying vaccines research.

So couple issues. Taking Europe, fewer cultural differences UK, China, Brazil, Zimbabwe Iran. huge differences approaches people doing. EU massive issues, much slower respond globally politics part Covid approaches.

Will countries pay? issues NATO funding, wealthy nations (like Germany) contribute required amounts.

Will countries want part it? UK could part EU vaccination effort, decided go route allowed things like continue Oxford vaccine efforts. Also felt could flexible part group. Would US China join, giving autonomy?

Who decides vaccines best choices? 100 candidates time last year, UK picked 7.

Who gets money research, infrastructure factories, payment production, vaccines backed (France UK really wanted vaccine own, worked UK cost Europe lot diverted funds appeasing France).

There need substantial war chest emergencies, countries going happy global health crisis, get raided. huge recall Respiratory Equipment Vents, Cpaps, masks

Just curious: much stuff recalled? Ah, explains it. thanks. It‚Äôs contagious deadly ducking send stimulus vaccinated ones. retroactively too. 9% positivity rate. nearly enough testing. me, all. people think even lot infections higher hospital use things stay same. 

This true one worst nations EU. vacations make easy show matters. Presumably wanted extra data safety &amp; efficacy vaccine field (mass vaccinations) moving children. covid dangerous children, risk-benefit ratio vaccine needs extremely good worth testing children.

(See, example, foe Pandemrix vaccine caused increased risk narcolepsy children despite safe adults) No, they'd need send sample sequenced. Whether that's bad thing also depends definition ""normal"". expect go back exact situation pre covid:

- working home becomes norm, least encouraged/allowed desk jobs.

- change attitude towards mask wearing distancing symptomatic may lessen impact flu cold outbreaks.

- people buying local again. German politicians stupid Stay school. glad singularity happens non-tech jobs dissappear Yes got within several weeks vaccinated, 10 years later. amount UV radiation sunlight certainly enough kill quickly. Hours best. Japan already lying Covid numbers, indirectly. Positives they‚Äôve drastically reduced testing (and testing numbers always low). Hospitalization rates ‚Äúlow‚Äù they‚Äôve changed criteria could ‚Äúhospitalized‚Äù. isn‚Äôt proper study rigorous controls. It‚Äôs lazy time series analysis. error bars, haven‚Äôt released, probably huge. Republicans believe military exists kill enemies shame liberals supporting enough. don‚Äôt care otherwise. I'm thirties covid vaccine kills 50 years it. Yes. IOC Japan government don‚Äôt give fuck. Incompetence greed around. Misleading title!  yes! penicillin. fun get Haha dude less 20% people Japan fucking vaccinated. got first dose Friday, literally first chance given. Including myself, know *four people* who‚Äôve even gotten first dose, one four got second already (because she‚Äôs 66 years old). can‚Äôt get without voucher, places elderly gotten voucher yet. personal observation, see Redditt visit subs every day five / six months.

So great way view entire phenomena think worth mentioning. idea new variants could change - referring original strain.

I know personal experience first three months recovery thinking would sick rest life really worried things like lung fibrosis. getting better every month pulmonologist said everything looks good. don‚Äôt need pitting teachers nurses, professions treated payed like crap kinda agree this. Despite obvious someone losing family member something like that. Lots people lost jobs, fed threw money everywhere ended real estate. Seems impossible buy house anywhere now. dun fuckt y‚Äôall myocarditis scare spooked them. bad one reported prevalence covid patients. Neat. I'm teacher person students October.  way prevent this. Still quite grasping whole variant thing huh. Death risk, plus unvaccinated variant producers we'll have. Vaccinated children part solution. remember weeks gave buddies 9th anthrax shot less 12 months, told us accidentally gave us many shots. remember like yesterday. made squad us go maintenance hanger beside runway Al Taqaddum get them. I‚Äôm honestly surprised they‚Äôre cautious COVID vaccine. guess it‚Äôs become political. Fair enough, although I'm sure got numbers. like, x number people infected per infected person, what. Also, still straight answer affects already vaccinated people, answer varies widely ""some protection"" ""no cases vaccinated people"". really, using percentage scare raw numbers really small. 166 total people hospital entire state covid, one hospital tiny town saying number.. Context, know? Dig deeper almost every patient ICU ECMO unvaccinated. That's important part story. Vaccines work! Interesting passed FDA approval technically. Well, is. never going free Covid. wear face. Mask wants to, that's stopped infections anyway. course are.. patient convinced recent frequent yeast infections covid.   short answer yes immune system produces fever state body similar ways. 

Think way - fever caused pathogen- fever body fights pathogen. running fever vaccination body rolling big immune response faux pathogen vaccine.

There might detailed mechanistic difference fevers that's advanced immunology know. fully vaccinated family Tulsa caught Delta variant covid time.

And nothing happened except minor symptoms. Vaccines work. Get vaccinated.  got rid years ago use regular needles now. covid, got vaccinated heart rate high two months afterwards. pretty concerning first, seems okay now! kept kids home camp year. interested rolling dice. 70% adults ‚â† 70% population Indeed. now, 166 people hospital COVID-19 statewide, 55 ICU.

only 166 people hospital covid statewide... temporary fix?  idea arguing about. interested data provided already, see point linking papers.

Edit: ""Pandemic never existed."" Lol...  would put cameras hospital peak covid, would mainly seen bunch elderly people dying. honestly don‚Äôt think would convinced them. Pffff ""state"", harrr ""class"". combinators... could social group self-selects. instance see lot masks communities groups kids say nightlife-y areas demo mostly young people disposable income - got ""back normal vibe."" guys working behind counters still wearing masks though. ‚ÄúOut 12 million doses administered youth ages 16 24, CDC says 275 reports heart inflammation following vaccination age group.‚Äù 275 12 million. 

Your possibility hospitalization assuming age group basically same. 2.1 per 100,000. one isn‚Äôt risky other. It‚Äôs catch it, could spread loved ones likely hospitalized.

Anyways, take care! completely agree. thing feel guilty/bad children. lot can't get vaccine. Yes, good far Lambda concerned right, People wrote dont think saying sayed... treat summer like said next summer expect gone. I'm like ""I guess us vaccinated fine???"".

For toughest point feeling way group people explicitly know case. like I'm gonna hanging inside going concerts. dont trust people like point. stated fact even though purely anecdotal  two weeks lol vaccine literally free lol schools saying 3 feet say anything all.  Three ten Americans stupid. Probably lot more. C19 permanently disabled people know still think flu. hope I'm wrong, feel like shits gonna hit fan variants start spreading here. ask nice, think queen would take us back? üòÇüòÇüòÇ Yes corona vaccine isn‚Äôt FDA approved yet can‚Äôt mandated. That‚Äôs many soldiers haven‚Äôt gotten yet change FDA approval comes. fun n games mutates further.

Except that's *if*... *when*...  That's teachers told pandemic. headlines infuriating. appreciate y'all reality check.  Yeah cool compress head neck, staying elevated, propped bed. find virus hurts didn‚Äôt get vaccinated /s  least 3 10 americans would denied pandemic entirely used logic, keep masks states enforced covid completely gone,because it‚Äôs small inconvenience need protect risk

That sounds like good idea. would anyone brain conscience disagree I‚Äôm ‚Äúanti mask‚Äù

Literally done rant masks. yet provide good, logical reason vaccinated travelers forced wear masks.

It's logical reason ever mask mandate first place. lowers overall transmission undoubtedly ton people vaccinated still traveling. keep bringing logic can't seem use yourself. one exception patient dialysis vaccines known adequately protect immune-compromised patients.

I acquaintance that's ICU covid going 3 weeks. Fully vaccinated got sick. Earlier 2020 organ transplant. Naturally means anti-rejection/immunosuppression drugs. Fearing worst.

Grove close Missouri &amp; Arkansas. states outbreaks Delta variant. 

Delta new cases Arkansas. 1,000 new cases today. 3,000 new cases last week. Largest increase hospitalizations since January. 

As July 1st, Delta variant hadn‚Äôt confirmed Travis County. bit you‚Äôll start seeing this. And, bad depend vaccination rates. Arkansas SW part Missouri low full vaccination rates. 

There fully vaccinated family Tulsa caught Delta variant covid time. 

All signs there. Delta going far worse, least low vaccination areas, saw previously. problem trust them.

If 7 day average reaches super lockdown presume.

Not single politician come said 7 day average completely irrelevant acceptable number Covid deaths ear despite everything open country. step father Army while.

After shots boot camp gotten sick twice last decade (when went), get sick super nasty. allergies bit better health amazing considering habits. definitely like pre-bootcamp.

They jabbed y'all super human juice, swear.

Also, thank service! :) uk far higher uptake among vulnerable people die this.

There plenty unvaccinated old people south giant reservoir kids nationwide infect them. I'm vaccinated. me. you, problem. There's PLENTY vaccine. Zombie don‚Äôt wake  you? Toyotathon on? Shit Hope reserved memorial wall spot.

Early. new approach vaccine entirety find .... vaccination protects infection, prevents serious illness death? I'm fully vaccinated, over. Thanks, best summary thread Oklahoma, population like 5 people? killing people. many people that? Vaccine hesitancy issue moment, issue healthy young adults, Japan, start receiving vaccine vouchers month. So, quite literally, able legally vaccinated. even vouchers go actually able make reservation receive shots difficult. Agree 100%. happy it, think you‚Äôre probably right. 

Personally can‚Äôt wait approval younger children. 4 yr old probably hardly even remembers life pre-covid point. Poor kiddos need able kids go playground raise hell around neighborhood. People got Guillain-Barr√© rushed flu vaccine 70's. Still super rare, link proven lawsuits believe. Lazy living country? Politicians afraid talk another lockdown upcoming elections. opposite case. talking removing restrictions everyone got vaccination opportunity. COVID-19 worrisome I'm sure worrisome -- that's biological lab level PPE.

But everyone manager risks way. Vaxxed back normal, barring future material developments variants similar. Glad keep taking advantage WFH indefinitely commute though, maybe keep COVID fear alive üò¨ I‚Äôd concerned hospitalizations, particularly among vaccinated, case count. vaccines work well even there‚Äôs cases overall it‚Äôs big deal long vaccinated folks get infected lower rates lesser symptoms. One 2k stimulus check, got vaccinated.

Done.

(But wait! Republicans exist means nice things can't!) be. could still increase capacity limits keep masking. easy solution -- almost literally easiest thing someone combat pandemic besides getting vaccinated. 

But many people ""done it"". Like virus cares psychological state. Force readiness big deal DoD. Navy got bit last year covid got aboard aircraft carrier. definitely going mandated.  think issue people mRNA vaccine technology new. try convince someone already vax hesitant take that. disagreement there. Hopefully refusers jobs infect quickly get herd immunity. I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic could vaccine little ones next year there‚Äôs telling. started little dude preschool past month every time gets sick I‚Äôm ball anxiety. Even without COVID worry much getting sick. It‚Äôs scary time parent. least we‚Äôre vaccinated, family friends vaccinated well school he‚Äôs pretty protected. hope classmates‚Äô families teachers good sense get vaccinated too. definitely feel better overall though risk considering state local infection rates lower they‚Äôve since March 2020. wish vax rates way higher. assuming still alive? Oh see.

It's okay present evidence assumed he's informed closed minded, obvious he's presented evidence... 

And that's clear sign he's informed. need present butting proving point.

Happy help. see word Pentagon, assume they‚Äôre referring military Young kids got lucky, they're using Pfizer them; older people went roulette got whatever available moment ;P would funny later year get Sinovac third shot! that, single biggest case used prove gravity effects early South Korean study: didn‚Äôt mix well air like measles, minimum drop size (it infected people air stream fell infecting *everyone* airstream could infected quickly). still, day idea is. thought I'd put my. 02 in

Haha, true. Like grandmother would remove label save every glass plastic container came across reuse. kid great depression. Actually


Yes. people lived great depression, many lived lives like another depression around corner.

I doubt we, went covid, people carry masks around everywhere, try keep rather large personal bubble help it. have. I'm going wait another couple weeks declare victory deaths lag far behind new cases.    link data kids covid.  teach elementary school. I‚Äôm worried quickly schools try return ‚Äúnormal‚Äù fall. Kids age affected covid, there's reason vaccinate them. chances child went hospital due covid less 2% Single stranded indicates cellular machinery needed replicate, don‚Äôt think influences hardy virus is. Things like enveloped influence that. could wrong.

UV light pretty strong certain amount time sanitize. Otherwise wouldn‚Äôt viruses persist sun exposed body parts transmitted skin skin. Look numbers new England. us, pretty over. Take fucking jabs people. work. Get hear tinfoil hat   Totally.

I same. remained home, wore mask everywhere, even volunteered test sites swabbing people cars Florida summer heat covered hot PPE. got vaccinated right away keep spreading patients family. participated post-vaccination feedback program. I've reaching individuals hesitant nonjudgmental discussions them. damn part. I've working toward normal year need move on!

It sucks many people brainwashed get vaccinated. worry people life vulnerable refuse get it, like best friends' parents extended family members. freaking time live normal life again, least country anyone eligible get vaccinated.

And I'm sick news freaking variants predictably turn susceptible vaccines. consequences need viewers good mental well-being. Everything cost. thinking maybe it‚Äôs cause average age Israel? young kids. doubt 25 first graders vaccinated open fall. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, smoker, I‚Äôm 100 times worried myself. feel like quarantine go back year, couldn‚Äôt live one kiddos got slight possibility could one give them. I‚Äôm also getting married next summer, I‚Äôm trying planning school starts minimize contact year. Washington post article depressing read. :( constantly see argument people miss social aspect office. still socialize co workers want socialize even working home feel like people use excuse might people others like lol.they also could people socialize better person feel like losing aspect worth trade pros get working home.

 commute work, able chores breaks lunches etc ""laundry, shower, dishes, sweeping, vacuuming "" give much free time I've ever resulting working harder work. actually get good sleep well. mention get cook much resulting less money spent food, drinks.

They want us back office August 30th feel like variant spreading requirements needed come ""can't show two symptoms"" slow us people forced call arent allowed building lie get work causing people get sick potentially sending us home again. likely care long term effects overeating/obesity, alcohol drinking, smoking, lack exercising, etc... way worse long term possibility long term effect covid vaccines. still alive? that‚Äòs cool. lot numbers Moderna work? (Metro Manila, Philippines) received first dose Moderna, sticker bearing lot number placed vaccination card. 

I tried look lot number get ""lot number found"" error. 

Does site cover Moderna shipped US? did. believe kept viral regular symptoms like cold. Moderate death. Kept olympics. Got greenland. Started ramping nausea vomiting increased spread death. Slowly ramped things like coma etc. started working cure. Got far. The. kept mutating ramping death. think India spain us russia working cure. started mutations. Increased death countries infected. Ramped death. India fell knocking back cure. easy peasy.  I‚Äôm vaccinated ever purposely hang non-dumbasses friends vaccinated too. 

I know it‚Äôs over, I‚Äôm still going follow rules establishment I‚Äôm ask people wear masks whatever, least might well important ways.   Maybe vaccinated population quickly protection wears time? 270 million. Ear savers work great tightening face without futz around loops. Wait there's pandemic going on? Fucking weird...... Honestly point... Fuck em. I'm certainly wishing anything bad happens them, enough worry is. There's room brain worry people. get sick... Fuck em. think meant third. would think maximizing precautions well behind us would smart. Apparently society needs immediately tangible carrot motivate people get vaccinated. surprised low percentage tbh. Thx. live rural area barely anything shut down. Bluegrass events every weekend 300+ people last summer, big bbq every weekend, one wearing masks, didn‚Äôt even feel like pandemic all.

This recipe create new variants! look UK's death graph  FrEeDoM RiGhT SeNtiEnt BEinGs really low percentages Covid deaths vaccinated people, quite different seeing UK countries. wonder it‚Äôs type vaccine, lower incidence Delta variant. Shit shit shit. resting heart beat become 90-110 bpm now. 7 months recovery. Oregon? Right even vaccinated today, there's still decent period time ""fully vaccinated.""

Oh course, still need get vaccinated. No. tier list VOC's straightforward: Delta Gamma Alpha Everything else. difference droplet airborne significantly different implications. 

And therefore people didn‚Äôt want believe it, specifically due limited resources PPE negative pressure rooms hospitals. evidence beginning pandemic strong enough definitively declare airborne. Really true emergency/pandemic approach would‚Äôve considering airborne proven otherwise.  spike underwhelming approve vaccine 12.

Well yeah, cause they're going 3 year increments. we'll get 9 year olds, 6 year olds, 3 year olds, newborns. Kids &lt;18 20% population is. choose, though, I‚Äôd take mask mandate day lockdowns restricted events limited capacities. want vote post one billion times. hear way much. I‚Äôm like well take care people dying covid. dying vaccine! Understand? respond know friend died vaccine. Oh lord we‚Äôre fucked. End madness. Please. Stressed burnt nurse! Shots arms! works! need education vaccine mass public. Stop fear! That‚Äôs 3 10 Americans feckin eejits Well what's happening that, point, non vaxxed people looneys say pandemic overblown done with, NEVER go get tested, UNLESS get hospitalized, mandates test. what's happening bunch people OK getting sick getting tested therefore getting counted. Could dm link yours?  They'll find different excuse. That's point. might increase certain employers likely require approved vaccine (including military) Baxter, know don‚Äôt speak Spanish! seriously, results? know reschedule 2024. 

I'm sure would cost lot money. 

But surely better sleep less nights they've last 18 months. vaccinating workers? Leave alone aren‚Äôt living fear like rest sub. got vaccine care do? would tell ask doctor. long voices saying it‚Äôs dangerous, people won‚Äôt know believe. people generally trust doctor. 

If ask I‚Äôd say 30 year old doesn‚Äôt primary doctor goes random ones ill, I‚Äôd try give scientific answer.

They reasoning want kill granny get little kid sick. turns need get vaxxed college anyway. based droplet spread idea droplets heavy fall ground quickly. told us precautions droplet spread knew full well Covid airborne anyone's guess.  would take huge mutation produce one escape vaccines. happen anytime soon. different foot. 

Countries say 'cases rising death tolls let's end lockdown' causing major problems rest world. 

We deal many outbreaks caused vaccinated asymptomatic people coming places like UK. Come Massachusetts, it‚Äôs pretty damn believable here. honest find amazing chile got population vaccinated, home country vaccinating people 40s many want vaccine.... mean, else going get around them? Going back lockdown another year literally way combat Anti-Vaxxers Covid deniers... least according health experts.

Obviously won‚Äôt happen, like... We‚Äôre running options here. gonna tough hear.

You're smart enough make decision own. Trust wisdom education scientific concensus advanced us far. 

Trust educated educate children trust fruits. Trust scientific consensus, perfect, gotten us far.

If believe nothing else simple life, believe smart enough make decision best thing trust ancestors, better understood value science education. Hypothetical: would say 90 year old grandmother hasn‚Äôt vaccinated still following rules convince shot safe effective? one them. AMA they? everything behavior, sanctioned public policy pretty much every level government parties, says is.  


In america, money important lives. enough resources continue vaccination reached enough people. chose to. secured rights locally manufacture Astra Zeneca ... noone wants complications .... hedge bets buying anything else. Probably even considering people died couldn‚Äôt counted  shot statistics going it‚Äôs pretty much waste I‚Äôm at. wear mask crowded indoor places I‚Äôve got immune issues largely friends vaccinated, I‚Äôm worried. 

I feel little bad friend mine hasn‚Äôt gotten vaccine (claims aren‚Äôt anti-vaccine still hesitant, even though they‚Äôre licensed nurse???). two kids spouse isn‚Äôt vaccinated either. They‚Äôre healthiest people gut screaming Delta going ravage time comes. hope isn‚Äôt serious family, again, it‚Äôs 100% choice point. reason vaccinated- prior conditions allergies.

Just sucks kids, really don‚Äôt get say happens mom dad (or them, get infected default). mean they're already infected think people terrible, know are. public since pandemic began?? People give shit, anyways.  dont know situation country Netherlands seems like lifted soon significant portion population chance fully vaccinated. sure downvoted. It‚Äôs indisputable fact vaccinating corpses little benefit. think anything say internet going change mind, hope find way train thought. dark place think people genuinely terrible.

I know internet infuriate me. algorithms certainly knack bringing things piss most. remember judge people based worst them. They're ass ends bell curve reason. Double vacc, never day work begin with, masks. Life definitely back normal me. Didn‚Äôt Fauci admit pulled 6 feet thing thin air?  Yes got infected Bronx Zoo NYC. Sorry confusion!

What's average age states die? number new cases accelerated unfortunately.  site track variants spread, severity, etc. nothing fearmongering it, article clearly provided facts nowhere yell house fire.  noticeable reaction either Pfizer shot. Though job keeps pretty tired, I'm hoping fatigue mentioned :(. one family seemed get side effects vaccine. sister says J J kicked butt, nearly bad symptoms Covid gave her. fully vaccinated several months safe personal harm covid.

That's entirely true. People get covid twice even they've vaxxed already covid. die wiped medical costs. Though even entirely true elderly.

The vaccines 100% effective... science says. won‚Äôt best thing happen nephew loses parents. read comments horror. undoubtedly killed people willful ignorance. evil liability human race. hope nephew given good grace free soon ends place chance normal existence. course. vaccinated person Wyoming‚Ä¶yeah feel like it‚Äôs done. See like 1/10 people wearing masks now, almost forget entirely 99.97 age bracket, maybe 99.997 kinda stopped paying attention got 3rd standard deviation mean That's Canada did. People first dose AZ get Pfizer Moderna want. happening Paywalled, course. Get better mask. N95s equivalents scarce anymore, offer protection better breathability.

Very dangerous long covid yes symptoms specific yes 
Covid dangerous young people like smallpox dangerous many die 100s.  like little mystery. Exactly thoughts. isn‚Äôt unlimited supply Pfizer, far countries. It‚Äôs far better vaccinate population vaccine like Sinovac rather leaving everyone unvaccinated many months wait Pfizer vaccines become available.

If necessary always give Pfizer booster later supply becomes readily available, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre locked first vaccine choice forever. meantime, vaccine like still going make massive difference. North Carolina still like 400+ new cases per day population 10M.

We great savings too. nature keep something squirreled away. Well look UK, 65% fully vaccinated right 30k new cases per day. number people ICU's also rising (to almost 400).

Fortunately vulnerable protected large enough numbers get infected, still puts many people ICU's.

Only 85%-90% fully vaccinated, another wave avoided. Benzylpenicillin every fortnight year. Rheumatic Fever sucks. So, aware ‚Äúthis type vaccine‚Äù around decades, you‚Äôre actually including available Covid-19 vaccines.

Totally unfair. already know Pfizer superior vaccine vaccinate EVERYONE vaccines currently even sinovac soon possible Yeah, comparable AstraZeneca efficacy. Moderna Pfizer use recent technology unique class. nothing uniquely unfortunate Sinovac. pretty typical vaccine.

These political hit pieces bizarre. already thing? Everyone know found one shot hit bit harder other.

I‚Äôve heard, likely occur partially vaccinated (not fully unvaccinated people). occur anyone, though, sure. want say- Im relieved loss taste/smell longer common symptom. That's sliver hope me. symptom indicated something going neurologically, good see Delta least doesnt come that! I'm Texas too. think people trigger happy term ""anti-vaxxer"". people know refused shot things like flu shots kids get vaccine regimens. ""experimental"", often say, Covid vaccine.

Mutations result errors DNA viral replication, mitosis, meiosis types damage DNA (such pyrimidine dimers caused exposure ultraviolet radiation), may undergo error-prone repair (especially microhomology-mediated end joining\[2\]), cause error forms repair,\[3\]\[4\] cause error replication (translesion synthesis). Mutations may also result insertion deletion segments DNA due mobile genetic inactivated vaccines give symptoms disease, e.g., flu shot.

If believe made mistake, please [message cooperation. original testing. think much longer. Since roughly 50% Americans vaccinated, strictly 50% *adults*, would expect least 50% children would also vaccinated. crude Googling, seems children 12 account 10% population, half get vaccinated would add another 5% vaccination numbers, bringing around 55% total. much hoped, something look forward suppose. kills state. even covid didnt play role death.

What mean this? holiday (came Buffalo) yeah, ton Texas Florida plates. I'd say saw Texas Florida plates NY NJ plates.  understand even best performing vaccines optimistic estimates/results 95% efficacious right? leaves least 5% vulnerability best conditions. argument would valid vaccines claimed 100% efficacious, would also impossible.

Fwiw, believe vaccines enough, consider low risk enough, I‚Äôm particularly worried personally. people factors consider assessing that‚Äôs fine too. Eventually fear worry stuff fade away, time it‚Äôs going remain major inflection point. Boil em mash em stick em pew Whats vaccine numbers like? surge cases leading hospitalizations/icus/deaths? Science says vaccinated people still pass virus, I‚Äôd suggest keep reading stop spreading misinformation. doubt vaccines reduce risk hospitalization great deal. 

My point big wave covid infections without danger vaccinated populations. restrictions Maryland. sure talking about. Yes military always considered one single unit. typically ""support troops"" well, troops getting vaccine, pentagon need make mandatory? kids can‚Äôt get vaccine yet. Yeah. whole world vaccinated probably least help dose viral particles get. I'm jealous people. turned New York prison colony three months. vaccine numbers rocking. hit 75% eligible people fully vaxxed end July. want take leave area? Well days home family limited rest leave you‚Äôre gonna spend ROM. deploy? you‚Äôre spending weeks ship instead town. Cool det lots per diem coming up? We‚Äôre gonna send vaccinated folks instead they‚Äôre less risk. I'm guessing 30% people vaccinated areas high vaccination rates traveling moment.

For intents purposes, person's life specifically, pandemic basically over, it? course always risk vaccine-resistant variant, terms person's myopic view, would kind kick entirely *new* pandemic. kids get it, spread it. Sure kids might get brunt sickness (though do), could easily spread someone might immunocompromised. person could neighbor, teacher, janitor etc... 

Also, sick child (with sickness) fucking sucks ass. I'd rather avoid whole fiasco can. one friday negative PCR Wednesday negative too.
It worked me. Find new church. I'd say really depends are. parts world would risky right now. 

But, example, county less 1 per 100,000 new cases per day. ‚Äúsome effectiveness‚Äù better ‚Äú0 additional effectiveness‚Äù.

No vaccine 100%. Thats purpose. Vaccines purpose help REDUCE transmission, give immune system helping hand reduce severity don‚Äôt go hospital. challenge here. stay home parent whose youngest going half day pre school.to full day last year. Input rentering workforce preschool shut down. virtual program help instead. trust places staying open.

God sure works mysterious ways. RIP. vaccinated. you‚Äôre area low vaccination rates, least consider continuing wear mask (in addition getting vaccinated).

That's reasonable. county high vaccination rates (yay living somewhat progressive city!), I've lot less concerned getting breakthrough infection. Deaths lagging indicator. 25k/day bit week. 

How Summer 2021 still discussion? Personally, would gone. 

You likely die wreck way airport die breakthrough case one friend. 

But everyone's risk tolerance different. you, boo. 70% adults California vaccinated already. We‚Äôre never shutting again. Oh I'm desperate quite opposite. absolutely exhausting wading find ""the truth"". 


People claiming opening parks Ontario brainer outdoors safe. apparently government anyways. also worked extra outbreaks it. see confusing even someone paying attention? Except doesn‚Äôt quite work like that. apt comparison is: 

If practice good gun safety, care others practicing good gun safety.

Because morons dangerous still kill people!

How know vaccine fully effective me? know won‚Äôt still bad case? prevent getting asymptomatic mild case passing someone else?

Even aren‚Äôt going roads, still don‚Äôt want bunch drunk drivers might hit kill someone know love. anti-mask parents die. Statistics don‚Äôt care stupidity. Assuming worst study acknowledging children certainly spread virus, questions are‚Ä¶

1) teacher staff school worried, get vaccinated. Then, vaccine effective reported, unmasked unvaccinated children cannot harm correct?

2) 600,000 COVID deaths 324 deaths 0-17 age group. recent data find 2016 showed 4,074 children adolescents died traffic accidents. likely die going school COVID

Thus‚Ä¶ vaccine prevents teacher getting sick COVID extremely mild children. What‚Äôs logic closing schools and/or masking vaxing children? Check percent positive rate. Still topping 5%, even known fudging numbers. (Florida reports total number negative tests total positive people calculate percent positivity-it's true    Well technically... 93% hostpilizations state MD entire month June unvacinated. probabilities. growing body evidence indicates people fully vaccinated mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna) less likely asymptomatic infection transmit SARS-CoV-2 others.

Read lease look local/state laws. may laws limiting much increase rent every year. pressures diff reasons. many hosts virus tears dense unprotected populations, selection shape evades current vaccines . question: come pfizer/moderna begun look revamping mRNA delta/delta+ variant since new variant seems making current vaccine little less effective variant variant? already happening?

I thought whole point mRNA tech quickly pivot different strains flu/covid etc begin production, whereas old way making vaccines use chicken eggs etc took forever.  yet US deaths Covid-19 deaths country world.  ever established Japanese-American internment *saved* lives otherwise benefited American public?  highly doubt it.

**My** point is: wary US Government choosing ""what good us"", especially rooted fear hysteria. track record spotty, best. 

Yet listen many Reddit -- thread -- government rounding anti-vaxxers *now* forcibly injecting vaccine, rights desires damned, *because COVID scary.*  Anyone refuses vaccinate sent island. hear Johnston Atoll nice time year. think cold, might mild case Covid.  argument I‚Äôve heard choose unvaccinated it‚Äôll fault (as carrier) I‚Äôll spread eventually. getting vaccinated means they‚Äôll also become sterile whatever they‚Äôve scared believing. Can‚Äôt convince them. Holy shithole. 100% Agree. 12 without real medical exemption, every chance get vaccinated. choose instead stubborn conspiracy theorist, brought negative consequences pity you. making sure clarify even symptoms same, effects may be. cancelled. feel really bad athletes, Japan/Tokyo dropped ball hard this. Also fucked scandals right now.. Weed means performance enhancing. Yep. Even worse, husband believe admitted faults getting vaccinated wife died recovering.

Just sad tragic around, considering unnecessary was. Google search. 400000 people worldwide MS. 200 added per day.

However, 50% vaccinated population, evolutionary advantage may spread beat dominant strains.

People saying learn live we're still clearly better option. now, settle cautiously optimistic wait see Texans rest Americans next couple months. really low vaccination rate rich country. 26 % vaccinated least one time. failure. would vaccinated more, could allowed fully vaccinated people spectators. Better completely empty venues. Correct answer. waiting hear said publicly long time. Even control COVID good amount vaccination, anything less herd immunity, likes polio, allow virus continue mutating evolving. turn ever dangerous disease longer allow circulate. speed variants different transmission rates prognosis appeared demonstrates coronavirus potential change rapidly.

What truly need *education* 25% seem want vaccinated; doctor told legitimate medical risk vaccination would exist fewer 1% people. Unfortunately, seem quite people aren‚Äôt susceptible education evidence. Florida. Imagine done two weeks. Thats right let ppl Missouri die.
What sob &amp; bet mfer got vaccine . assume Missourians choose risk covid &amp; die choice. Apparently &amp; unfortunately can't force ppl believe Science scientists. I'm expert. 

Your message makes sound like virus mutates purpose. believe random. 

A 2% vaccinated community would therefore make likely new variant emerge (just higher transmissions higher reproduction time within person). 50% vaccinated community creates environment vaccine resistant variant would perform better (i.e. outclass variants). 

However, know mutations needed resist vaccines different mutations needed resist previous infections immunity. 

Anyway, wanted say think virus ""gets practice getting around vaccine"". believe mutates randomly. Unfortunately many people vaccinated never be. live life others, life never normal. It‚Äôs him. pulmonologist (asthma, COPD, lung diseases) discourages masking inviting symptomatic people office testing (new long term patients = $$$). 

It‚Äôs complicated.

Ja zullen zien :D Aww yes, good ol guilty association tactic! Mom mental issues clearly takes others keeps dying. That's pretty good reason IMO That's entirely fair, immunocompromised often overlooked; society owe better protect them. anti-vaxxers care themselves, big ask. That‚Äôs true. Two ways look it:

As fully vaccinated person, risk around unvaccinated person quite small, probably much lower risks would take vacation.

But going vacation unvaccinated, friend putting high risk people unnecessary risk. that's real dick move, one wants go vacation dick. circular logic, person responding made another comment exposing vaccine virus, trying explain actually happen. There's misconception going around vaccinated people carrying vaccine vaccine escape would happen that's way virus exposed vaccine. 

The problem argument vaccinated people make terrible hosts virus. immune systems fight virus without allowing virus replicate. vaccinated actually infected, virus meeting immune response killed rapidly replicate. That's environment promotes kind mutation taking off.  dollar signs eyeballs said it?  Thankfully vaccines efficient immunocompromised teens non immunocompromised teens. /s said found local case bottom middle-late June. consistent data showing. long period gradual exponential decay noticeable inflection point clear reason (new variant significantly higher R0 rate). 

The predictable growth happened happened Alpha variant mid-Spring - outpaced vaccines. Unfortunately vaccine uptake declined noise levels lower Rt rate short run, behavior changes unlikely short run well. 

COVID long horizons terribly unpredictable; short term horizons (e.g., next 4-6 weeks), pretty easy forecast behavior changes exogenous factors change. 

This sky falling prognostication; repeat Winter 2020 3000 people dying daily. We'll see significant uptick cases material uptick hospitalizations deaths, latter still remain relatively muted compared COVID history due large portion vulnerable population protected vaccines. 

On ratio basis, hospitalizations rise deaths older people vaccinated younger ones. 50s significantly less likely die COVID, hospitalized relatively commonly (a 40-49 year old 2% death rate 85+, 25% hospitalization rate someone 85+). 

Apparent death rate hospitalization rate likely rise unvaccinated less likely get tested. unlikely IFR risen Delta, likely apparent CFR increase reason. 

These data driven defensible predictions. sensationalism ""influence"" media. Feel free come back 4-6 weeks see. children immunosuppressed people wish could get vaccine. Dont selfish prick  Like Costa Rica? doubt. it‚Äôs fair criticize anti-maskers dragging thing allowing virus find new hosts.  Didn‚Äôt know flu vaccine made people ill.  never took it. Haven‚Äôt flu probably 30 years. vaccines didn‚Äôt give symptoms all. Tanya Tucker maybe... rest total bro country.   Immunity-as-a-service lead horse water can't make drink. Feds send vaccines areas willing take instead going waste areas high vaccine hesitancy rate. excuse, vaccines across country free available. Pick vaccination pace Feds would move vaccines places willing take them. Why? California‚Äôs hospitals risk overburdened? Life's big roll dice, innit. I'm one them! Or, 2 year olds lived half damn lives bubble cannot get vaccinated yet?

It's definitely black white, theres still percentage population approved vaccine poor kids never normal life, long-covid lung/heart issues I'd feel like terrible parent 2 year old got covid play sports long-term heart lung issue it. There's little J&amp;J supply though. young people get mRNA vaccine. lack vaccination 

What mean it‚Äôs implying I‚Äôm unvaccinated? think organising raves testing. outside people going anyway might well mitigate someway. peer reviewed? I'm making things pandemic truly masks needed anywhere. Unfortunately keep bring case. Yes, average person Zimbabwe well average American. Give break. relatively poor American better almost every person Zimbabwe except super rich. evidence happening diseases? 


Not saying impossible anything. random mutations, evade vaccine, going selected vaccinated crowd unless also highly transmissible. equally transmissible, can't think reason woudl increased pressure. 


I think fair thing speculate think odds virulent mutation happening need worry odds definitely increase infection rates. infection rates decrease vaccination rates increase. evidence point medical system whole anywhere close collapsing future.

They quite comprehend risk management scenario ensure entire restaurant industry fall apart overnight. Still make ""safe"". Well doesn‚Äôt mask restrictions anymore.  probably should.  leave luck get randomly hit drunk driver every day 

It‚Äôs possible completely safe death, hundreds ways die house figured so. article focuses America well. But, areas much lower rates really scare us. Even 100% vaccination rate, we're still potentially risk variants start 10% vaccinated countries.  probably secured communities unvaccinated restricted access sure Covid spreading among them. would also give us opportunity deprogram Antivax misinformation Clubs opened several countries far I'm aware, I'm wondering they'll soon.  Tokyo areas near capital city allowed hold events fans stadiums regions Fukushima, Miyagi Shizuoka permitted spectators 50% capacity 10,000 infections rising Tokyo 23 July opening ceremony edges closer. Alas, fear. Fear people knocking doors ""disrupt lives"", fear loss privacy, fear loss ""control"" political leanings citizens. 

Nevermind good portion die, long majority survive vote next election.  That's necessarily true. Back Alpha variant first identified, scientists speculated may originated chronically ill infected individual hospitalized long period time. virus actually mutated inside one person body responded different treatments.

If true, highly vaccinated developed countries advanced medical care may actually end best breeding grounds new variants.

Which would unintuitive politically inconvenient fact. again, know sure. Supply biggest bottleneck. much least early July, we‚Äôll even less doses June due BioNTech frontloading deliveries Q2. reason things appear better mid-June, company doctors allowed vaccinate, means lot people go option instead GPs Yup check every day share exact sentiment. We‚Äôre woods yet. It‚Äôs still unpopular opinion sub plenty karma don‚Äôt care downvotes. may ever lockdown happens it‚Äôs face facts showing should. fall/winter true test - US choose herd stupidity realistic public health measures. 

That said, unbridled optimism died little positive sign people less emotional pragmatic. people asking sources amazing.  They‚Äôre old enough 12-13 make decisions. vaccinated important one regardless parents think. Youre acting vast majority Americans responsible adults. Also dont forget kids 12 unprotected point. Things always really bad. Like right 3 hospitals around area ICU‚Äôs 0 covid patients also 0 beds left. United States country healthy citizens  deleted wrong comment.

Looks like ruling Accordingly, involuntary anthrax vaccine program, applied persons, rendered illegal absent informed consent **or Presidential waiver**.""

So seems like military still require EUA COVID vaccine, specific condition military members legally required receive COVID-19 Ultimately, yes‚Äîbut answer requires bit nuance ... But, according law, president waive informed consent requirement determines ‚Äúin interest national security‚Äù so. Biden done this, members Congress called upon informed consent provision ultimately waived, military commanders clearly order military members command receive vaccine. consistent ‚ÄúFailure obey order regulation‚Äù Uniform Code Military Justice (UCMJ). Even informed provision waived Biden, mandatory military vaccination order may survive challenges military criminal courts implementing UCMJ. Federal civil courts would likely scrutinize move much closely. based upon prior decisions military‚Äôs experience implementing anthrax vaccination program, turn below. must joking? Read Canada love it‚Äôs getting forced quarantines, border shutdown, etc check dusty ass take. 

Also - xenophobic. morons say ""but covid *insert statistically wrong survival rate here*"" common sense. survive mean suffer negative consequences result.  Giving covid half population unprotected much everyone's problem soon roll deadlier mutation.  get saying people get infected 1 viral particle.

You need specific enough viral load get infected.

While neat found airborne, article say airborne infect via vector alone. detected it.

The entire point masks, plexiglass every measure lesson droplet airborne spread air. largest concern droplet, droplets also hang air to, virus illustrated think knew quite air circulating quick enough building leads infections concentrating viral load air more.

So people give sparky replies like virus turn corner... kind entirely misses point. 2M thing dumb, 1M also works, 3M.

It's reducing overall chance spread, may airborne really airborne around someone infected, fall distance increases. 

But pretty early people focused heavily HVAC I'm sure everyone thread going almost conspiracy thread... known new article says proved again, much detected actually infect someone.

Not saying can't way probably shown to. just.... feel like entire thread turned plexiglass masks bad weird. sure Singapore study showing 69% efficacy Israeli study showing 64% efficacy highly varying useless. look UK they've reported 30k+ new cases day last two days high vaccination rate. 

Pretending pandemic US vaccines sounds reckless me. Semantics. There‚Äôs nothing suggest delta lethal strains going around past year. wish businesses, colleges, etc would require . Delta yeah could've gotten it, Delta changed rules. studies showing vaccinated folks though rarely get sick may carriers often previously thought. notion herd immunity kind thrown window. 50 people gather 5 unvaccinated would take one 45 vaccinated folks carrier spread 5. ""Fleeting"" cases they're talking people pass one another shopping center spread gatherings 100% unvaccinated people get it... last 18 months real, REALLY real now, hide thing except behind good mask vaccine both.

We're point Delta need close 100% vaccination get past thing. watch burn though unvaccinated hard do.... includes kids really wish they'd get vaccine approved younger kids US. UK kids young, unvaccinated adults seem predominantly spreading since vaccinating anyone 18 yet. Wouldn‚Äôt also mean insurance companies could refuse cover illnesses caused lifestyle related choices, like poor diet, lack exercise, obesity, smoking, drinking, drugging, promiscuous sex, reckless driving. Maybe even mutate stronger, virus learn survive vaccine antibodies. get flu shot every year. you‚Äôre closed quarters care them. also fully vaxxed also auto immune shit going well list organ transplant hiding again, months low numbers Delta got poopin What‚Äôs non-replicating virus? Yep. Went happiest period life depression slowly creeping back throughout pandemic Cha ching  think collectively do, individual player doesn‚Äôt cost risk.  Masks....*maybe.* Live music etc.... chance. can't put toothpaste back tube point. 

I'm fully comfortable antivaxxers getting brunt disease. point, though. Kids 12 still susceptible. Young people AZ here. 

It's spreading young people 18s jabbed majority 40s still waiting get 2nd jabs. Quite lot 25s still getting around first jabs now.

Although vaccines protective serious illness death, delta variant still infect vaccinated people. We've taken decision let rip young people risk well protected. 

We're almost restrictions now, pretty densely populated island half country pubs watching Euros. inevitable really, much problem.  able get people vaccinated countries sufficient supply could fully turn attention vaccinating rest world. Variants coming unvaccinated unvaccinated allowing virus continue spread US countries. said ridiculous.  I've also first cold year now. I've heard lot people getting respiratory illnesses masks coming off. I'd like see anyone who's sick, future wearing mask &amp; even though know wearing mine protect much I'm ill, think I'll wearing mine I'm crowds. I'm much, immunity have.   shortened 12 weeks 7-8 weeks. people book 7 weeks first shot (same-day they‚Äôre lucky centres still booking 1-2 weeks out) Stop killing people's fantasies fancy logic read article. plainly answers question. Two tests. rapid test one took two days. enough? addition wife fully vaccinated. Agreed. I‚Äôve seen nothing suggest Delta lethal original Alpha strain.

Alpha ""original"". Alpha Delta different parallel Yeah, knows, right? would hope case like much chance. we're largely uncharted waters here, last thing need idiot court upholding idiot objection technicality. Especially we're close full FDA approval. Oh, penicillin? Got one ass-shots infection years ago. ""friends"" took clapping ass. ""fun"". almost certainly herd immunity original variant Covid. Delta. According Israelis, pfizer 64% effective preventing infection Delta, compared 95% original. efficacy preventing infection, one needs 90%+ vaccinated herd immunity. Perhaps even higher. Health Gateway set up, invite come date showing app. probably sometime midnight ‚Äî you‚Äôll probably wake tomorrow! Nicely put. Clear concise. Thank you. Single parents exist. 
I agree many people making poor decisions find frustrating think ignore people choice bring kids store kids risk bunch unvaccinated, unmasked people share indoor space. might without realizing it. interactive maps showing many people least one risk healthy young people get vaccinated, even anyone care (like parents grandparents), vaccines safe safer getting Covid. thanks Unless vaccines totally stop working prior infections stop never get point last winter. matter many people are. spread person person. keep track. submit ‚Äúclaim‚Äù government, put drivers license, social security #, ‚ÄúNOSSN‚Äù. ss# assumed citizen. Mmm. reason everyone brave 2nd shot. true. probably degree immunity years, maybe forever. wane time, first thing wane neutralizing antibodies stop getting infected first place.

The boosters would largely top going winter months virus likely become prevalent spreads easier indoors. also cement t-cell cellular immunity place strongly robustly.  OK vaccines work drug manufacturers claim, 90% protecting 65s result mere blip deaths hospitalization fall/winter.

If doesn't, even highly vaccinated states, need discussion whether vaccines failed whether misled efficacy data. That‚Äôs antivaxxers want. want mass death suffering. 69% percent infection, 93% hospitalization death. Still really good. You‚Äôre also leaving huge amount people unvaccinated already covid, sort protection. People always seem forget part. 

People also forget point never ‚Äústop‚Äù covid, flatten curve stop nationwide system collapsing. evidence point medical system whole anywhere close collapsing future. Delta makes healthy vaccinated people sick DIE, etc.

So nutjob logic ""so get COVID even vaccine, there's point getting vaccine!"" Right?

And coming people go flout mask mandates? beef babie. Yes people misreading articles.

This people getting voted airborne spread.

Not airborne, people insinuate things like X theater.

That article says science says.

To infected need specific amount average amount viral load. matter covid airborne can't infect you.

In overall concentration small, infection set it.

The point masks slow air/reduce amount breathing out. Likewise slows air reduces amount viruses breathe in.

Plexiglass slows air going directly someone hvac circulate building.

2M still distance, guess what? 1M distance would also work. 3M would work even better.

Guidelines suggestions based reduction chance infected.

The measures taken lesson amount virus makes air(masks) barrier filter, hvacs upgraded, filters, exchanging air etc etc etc.

Nothing theater, end people take bit something read run it. end plexiglass prior, hope stays.

There reason barrier exist adult children spit, throw shit workers, hop counters really reduce types transmission viruses to.

Like said, cheap install. reason it. Honestly asking here, 

With rate injury infection population children 12 can't vaccinated, would still shutting everything down? 

The CDC total deaths 0-18 age group.

In 2016 [over kids died car accidents, shutting freeways. 

So suppose arguments could either children vectors vulnerable population, assume vaccinated now, children dying, receiving debilitating injuries and/or tying hospital resources.

I can't seem find data hospitalization rate youth, long term injury covid. Maybe someone help? 

Or downvote like anyone seems ""uninformed."" It‚Äôs kids fault degree accepting risk (if they‚Äôre old enough/teenagers).

I blame kids parent's anti-maskers &amp; anti-vaxx. That's fault. tl;dr: one ones get seriously ill die covid, care people get sick die it, fuck it.


Their mindset: sickly, weak people die going die soon anways.


I healthy refuse live fear. get someone else sick, problem. 


What point getting vaccine cause side-effects protect cold? you‚Äôre fully vaccinated wouldn‚Äôt worried safety. think bigger piece whether want hang someone opposed vaccine. Idk reasons legit reasons get point. First says immunity wanes. True, flu vaccines need annually? Immunity usually lasts longer 12 months. results early trial participants available show fading protection justify booster. says booster variants. it? variants original immunity lasting need annual shot, variants variants? Take look Russia see well works. People paying money healthcare workers dump vaccine dose drain put name system. 

People want vaccine today either come around won't. Either way think put everyone else huge risk. There's billions unvaccinated people around globe getting vaccinated soon whatever people US do. Ok one 177 people. Thanks proving point. That‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôd love get one-and-done combo shot. RSV nasty. start supplying vaccines, instead hoarding it. confused. One article says immunity inferred could useful years, pops study, need boosters. booster booster, question...whether 'tis nobler wear thy mask, weather sea variants....heh. Sorry.  virus running rampant ignorant twat South Africa beta.

I think you‚Äôre mostly right. beta targeted booster safe. Turns booster original formulation probably enough beta variant. It‚Äôs good beta one ready needed, they‚Äôve practiced one (from understand designing takes like day), think we‚Äôll see another round original formulation (probably lower dose) fall. needed future, may may specifically variant-tailored; literally depend things evolve. Low moderna, they‚Äôre domestically producing version AstraZeneca vax. Japan‚Äôs big issue anti-vax culture due media panic MMR vax 92 HPV vax 04. former led court ruling government hook adverse effects also known side effects. Empathy? 

Also, work healthcare knowledge know presence healthcare system takes away patients. course pandemic US, haven‚Äôt seen significant push mandatory quarantine international travel. occasionally look related terms, media comes discusses Biden admin implementing mandatory not-enforced quarantines, essentially mandatory. 

Crazy discussing (potentially necessary) option. New Zealand Australia Taiwan since early pandemic, contact tracing potential slip ups. It‚Äôs like US whole doesn‚Äôt care obvious future threat global mutation could eventually undermine progress made vaccine program. 

If don‚Äôt want risk another year-long lockdown everyone, maybe it‚Äôs reasonable expect luxury traveling internationally significant inconvenience two-week quarantine testing protect whole country. sad studies long covid include placebo group. Even studies adults appear well designed use placebo group use people covid. would nice see comparison 3 groups 1. positive covid reporting long covid 2. positive covid reporting long covid 3. never tested positive covid split across age groups. Also could large sample size age groups would great well. big ask.  things get point last winter absolutely would. many people vaccines work, children, etc. Percentage wise small number. extrapolate 325,000,000 lot people. frustrating thing there's solution people would get done.  word doesn‚Äôt mean think does. 

Taking vaccine virus could potentially harm people common sense. live society. 

Kthanx.  One parent shop stays home kids. 

I‚Äôve seen countless times parents + kids w/o masks stores SMDH. real man genius here. üôÑ FWIW got infected - young fully vaxxed, mild symptoms. problem even vaccined people catching isnt people getting cold symptoms. problem puts us position accept possibility virus might evolve become resistant vaccine. many areas outbreaks telling vaccinated people put masks back considering new lockdowns.

With Singapore Israel saying effectiveness againt infection transmission dropping 64 69 percent, means quite lot opportunity detla delta plus exposed vaccine mutate resistances. happens might start see vaccine becoming entirely obsolete. SA variant Beta. Gamma - Brazil (p.1/2) post says low risk though Never going pretend it‚Äôs gone

Just going care it

Do take precautions every time lives risk? every single illness possible danger? don‚Äôt 

I‚Äôm point I‚Äôm treating like flu, aka caring  Texans came last year large numbers, apparently liked enough return. Definitely visitors normally saw pre pandemic bit cultural difference locals Cape. FL always large showing many actually live here, claim FL residency tax avoidance reasons. going back forth lot, though, summer, mobile population. They'll start disappear fall gone December. That‚Äôs good advice. heard it. tried getting message out, point among unvaccinated going listen point? Hell, even former president come say HEY GO GET VACCINATED they'll chalk pressured current president, ya know? banned foreign spectators months ago. have, inevitably, banned even Japanese citizens attending. agree would even go far say should, already, triangulate areas world likely visitors U.S., conversely areas likely influx U.S. visitors, fan also sending 50% available vaccines poorer countries without vaccine all. 

This would mitigate spread within U.S. countries since everyone involved would likely engage travel opportunity vaxxed yet, we'd also helping stop spread front countries little vaccine all. 

All available vaccine hunt people willing take it. 'hesitant' need left devices vaccinate willing quickly possible wherever may be. People hard headed overflowing Republican trumpiness get 5 brain cells fire time. makes us understand science crazy embarrassed. vaccine expiring bc get  think data study.

&amp;#x200B;

It still said 93% efficacy stopping infections lead hospitalizations. would hypothetically put COVID level seasonal flu Happy they've taken advantage vaccination program. remember back early pandemic reservations really tough time, fitting figured way scenario. Anti vax moved year ago, turn news get Reddit you‚Äôll fine I---yeah, want needle stomach thigh. cool arm. asked could IV due port, method action explained. asked nurse since little extra padding biceps possible think was, went it. Face - they're falling blanket shit again. get damn shot! Jesus! wrong people!? must new here. dozens us! Oh! Aha! big gotcha moment, much back forth. finally got me. 

Except didn't. Phase 3 safety, efficacy. Accepting analysis prior end Phase 3 means absolute dick regards safety adverse effects. Phases 1 2 safety, requires months data, whether EUA full approval. blew right past requirements least full year ago. 

The difference EUA full approval safety. Period. Let's real, part population can't due health issues kids approved vax.
We can't forget this. grandparent severe dementia, spouse get vaccinated. fear her, choice. people keep mind too.
It's cut dry.

As rest, we'll that's them. Nice‚Ä¶they made 143B last year   Provide source hot take personal opinion dismisses consensus medical community that‚Äôs clearly misinformation.  think need many dollar symbols still true. time forced vaccinations sucks. think would kind ""act God"" clause cancelling without fines. Natural disaster, pandemic, kind thing. non-government experts speculated Mr Kim top deputies may received vaccines imported unofficial channels.

That's would assume. North Korea get Russian missile parts, likely get small amount vaccines also. Wear masks public peeps. Thanks It‚Äôs def exactly at. I'm immunocompromised likely finished protection vaccine. 

Meanwhile, 2 young kids can't get vaccinated, governor require masks schools(he's also reelection), schools offering remote learning fall. 

Feels bad.  Tribes fought hard equity regarding distribution vaccines letting hard work go waste.  Definitely learnt something here. I'll use native Americans think accurate safe idea American Indian accepted. Golly! could seen coming? That‚Äôs going bit overboard, mate. need talk sense wife isn‚Äôt healthy. lambda variant political coverage? Mods fixed auto response Ah, good. curious, thanks info. Glad ok! family‚Äôs 16 year old dog passed away time family covid. already weakened state due age sister convinced covid well passed. Half family quarantined away house us unable say goodbyes. Euros FIFA? üëèmandatory üëè vaccines üëènowüëè think speculation Israel data looked total infection (including asymptomatic cases), whereas others looking symptomatic cases. Singapore data total infections (including asymptomatic) similar. also lot issues Israel conducted study, data sample itself. Looks like studies settling range 80-90% reduction symptomatic infection. think 65% reduction total infection similar alpha rates it‚Äôs bad Twitter Dr. Feigl-Ding would think. Insurance companies Missouri need deal this. vaccine, coverage. grew res love constant reminder Columbus fucking moron navigate. wired article talked effort someone figure 6 feet came from.

Worst part basic honestly platoon got smoked non stop lol Progress might double edged sword. lot people things better humanity. also lot people (politicians) things good. One doesnt cancel one. Next week never comes neither Jeebus. conversation passed. done. We're mostly back normal high-vax states there's little likelihood significant rollback.

It's settled. Great, country like us gets make laws power me, get elect people hardly say. Sounds wonderful. Wait‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt ask help week ago. saying don‚Äôt want help? Come on‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs clear way getting people vaccinated isn‚Äôt working out‚Ä¶ reject different approach? It‚Äôs like saying help way. way didn‚Äôt work first place‚Ä¶ Still, latest numbers 97% lower peak pandemic winter, California averaging 45,000 cases day.

Also note small uptick coincided exactly reopening June 15.

Just get vaccinated. honestly sounds close general population numbers. Putting 17 27,000 infected doesn‚Äôt generate nearly many clicks Maybe sad nod civility. least one fantasize. Care? I'm simply stating fully opening states leading cases.  Individually yes. Journalistically no, fine. hear get invite 8th week BC. get invite go vaccine centers see cancellations. No, allowing fans half capacity point need give move on. Somehow. might disrespectful some
but people tribes prefer American Indian. one singular group exactly Take precautions, separate within home, clean &amp; wear mask. That's quickest way become non-believer read silly book. It'll likely happen country low vaccination rates, US. one said ""just two weeks guys"", ever heard sarcastically guys like also seriously said ""it's flu/ gone easter"" probably virus particle outside body. *shocked pikachu face* Canada Israel domestically producing COVID-19 vaccines; high vaccination rates. Japan millions vaccine doses sitting freezer. like lot us can't stand boomer mentality, one day generation alpha going pissed millennials making decisions idea long-term implications virus.

It's straight selfish. entire lives uprooted waiting us, turn wait them. We're literally months away 6 months+ vaccinated - I'm suggesting lockdown anyone. get vaccine. certainly reason get vaccinated wrong. Diseases vary lots different ways, infectious. absolutely become deadly. I‚Äôve saying awhile now. I've contacted NHS track trace system say 'venue' day someone later tested positive (venue unnamed can't determined average person). told self-isolate must get tested (test kits ordered NHS/government website arrive home tomorrow). fact told self-isolate suggests close contact person understanding quite possible even venue time person.

Not matters. I'm happy willing get tests I've cancelled swimming next 10 days so, going pub indoor place to. get tested every 3 4 days think - read testing guidelines closely moment soon testing kits arrive. don‚Äôt many pop-ups walk-in clinics BC. think FH some, called EASI clinics, mostly first doses seconds‚Ä¶ live Fraser Health Region though, VCH don‚Äôt second-dose walk-ins yet (as far know) Yes. you‚Äôve military almost immune everything years. It‚Äôs pretty neat. No, anything die quicker prevent spreading more. waste resources. COVIDs home Wuhan. Well, taken 30 seconds skimmed Fauci noted study Scotland, showed two doses Pfizer vaccine 79% protective variant. Meanwhile, study England showed symptomatic infection, two doses Pfizer vaccine 88% effective. hospitalizations England, two doses vaccine shown 96% effective. friend actually one screens. said announcer would come tell fans clap cheer act excited. thing is, unvaccinated common sense, someone needs repeatedly tell things obvious v e r l w l :

It's mostly unvaccinated hospitalized
Nearly everyone dying unvaccinated
Unvaccinated pools harbor grow deadlier variants
Masks work  know make sense, there's lot political, racial, historic social &amp; cultural factors play that's influencing decisions.

And anyone wants better understand this, maybe start book, Scientific Apartheid. see kind antiviral medications produced. soon effective antivirals basically stop giving shit. suck people access medications. L Yup. pass along someone who‚Äôs vaccinated there‚Äôs decent chance won‚Äôt lucky you.  Maybe dumb question, buy vaccine doses donate poorer countries? Never let crisis go waste. both! time! Think makes even worse. Yes, course. would want arm? It‚Äôs kind injection haha. nope- takin wife lol surprised third world countries better 1st world countries vaccination rates. What?
No, none correct.   side woods, people think Delta vaccination side effect. Nothing change peoples minds.

Lol Libertarians consistent.   give 5 reasons:

1) ...exponential growth probably continue millions people infected, leaving hundreds thousands people long-term illness disability. strategy risks creating generation left chronic health problems disability, personal economic impacts might felt decades come.

2) high rates transmission schools children lead significant educational disruption

3) provides fertile ground emergence vaccine-resistant variants. would place risk, including already vaccinated

4) impact health services exhausted health-care staff

5) disproportionately affect vulnerable marginalised, deepening inequalities.   anyone trust numbers anyone point? I‚Äôm finding difficult trust CDC , FDA , know‚Ä¶‚Ä¶something good Murica? ü§î two things equivalent anywhere head? seem like sort person need persuade everyone cooperate way. sort person exists all. I'm starting think got wrong.

Stupidity virus Delta vaccine üòã 2025  Correct. That's vaccines work.

I think part problem two different ways ""long term"" used. way using effects show while. way using effects last long time. Vaccines could effects ""long term"" sick day something. 

I think misuse term ""long term"" mean two different things decent part problem lot people understanding already know possible side effects available vaccines. needed wait longer understand them. 29%?? Either people embarrassed say unsafe acting 29% live town cause one gives fuck Airborne requires N95‚Äôs, negative pressure filtration. Literally everything would shutdown remember Chinese researchers saying thing year ago. virus doesn‚Äôt care host lives dies.

With presymptomatic spread there‚Äôs zero killing hosts spread disease. It‚Äôs seen increase transmission decrease virulence vaccinated populations accounted for. 

Infact, appears Delta May even virulent stains everything factored in. Oh no! hope wasn‚Äôt bad.

It's hoax gonna disappear April, like stable genius said! easier understand consider?

* EU NA hoarding mRNA vaccines, they're massively demand abundance Q4.

[CDC It‚Äôs flattened, all.

There‚Äôs still millions perfect targets virus.

AND, distancing, masking, plus much transmissible virus.

Which way scale tip?

Off bat virus 2.25x transmissible, nationally there‚Äôs possibility spread last two waves.

Then subtract masking, distancing, add much movement around country, snd top national return fully packed classrooms fall.

All together makes pretty likely similar curve comes growth, possibly overall cases too.

Only 34m Americans covid far, another 157m Americans vaccinated.

That leaves 137m Americans vulnerable illness.

Sure unknown cases, also people ill, known unknown, gotten vaccine, given current growth rates minimally vaccinated areas think it‚Äôs fair assumption say there‚Äôs ton unknown natural immunity. low uptake counties would similar current rates infection heavily vaccinated counties.

So 1/3 hosts, 2.25x transmissible, practically zero NPI‚Äôs.

That‚Äôs looking good nationally.  Home / Rome sounds similar get it. going Rome stupid fool. That's deceptive title. 2.5m already shot 3.rd dose understand many Governors seem want kill constituents. way jump conclusions

I'm fully vaccinated, still wearing mask indoors. People like us frequently accused believing effectiveness vaccines. vaccines greatly reduce risk, 100%. figure, also wear mask, get even greater reduction risk, especially since mind wearing mask much? heard someone make analogy couple using oral contraception, quite reliable, lowering risk even still using condoms.

I'm personally content avoiding *severe* illness, since yet full understanding long term health impact Covid - even mild infections seem carry significant risk mild Covid. Breakthrough infections vaccinated tend mild - mild infection vaccinated person less likely lead Long Covid, compared mild infection unvaccinated? start going around maskless I'd like least see solid information that. Unfortunately us Australians much backup AZ, we're behind everyone else whilst wait Pfizer Moderna doses later year. Can't feel morally superior shut either. Yep. church dropped kids don‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶what changed kids since thing began?! Ugh That's huge yikes good example need teach STEM fields way cautions scientifically efficient way always ethically sound wasnt talking traveling, im talking America locally, obviously still real scary parts world, know that? get Greenland? always survive Greenland. mean republicans That's actually much better thought company keep says lot Proven? No.

But vast numbers people still believe vaccines cause autism even though research show Andrew Wakefield asshole. Nobody praising zero covid, praising holding front line buying time vaccines arrived I'm kind hoping ""big family holiday"" thing casualty COVID really patience shit. like r/Covid19 better less unfounded speculation comments. let us vaccine young. I'm sure there's one entire US state, state health department releases data zip code weekly. (not all) individual counties release countywide data well.  anyone know likely one vaccinated person transmit covid another vaccinated person? I'm fully vaccinated flu-like symptoms, I'm waiting test results right sure meantime worry giving fully vaccinated partner? live together.  6 feet lie told keep stores running expense workers There‚Äôs growing list new variants rapidly increased (many dozens). mutation small number far deadly capacity. Many found past several months. report published UK government several weeks ago health agencies similar reports published variants concern. Nobody asked question. means survey pool big enough stats BS moved arkansas. second  agree 100%. months ago, late night, went check mail community mailbox. walking back home neighbor appeared nowhere talking phone. didn‚Äôt know exhaled cigarette smoke. smelled freaked 30 feet away across street. wind carried straight me. still wear mask outside don‚Äôt know anyone‚Äôs health situation. virus mutated right left China, Brazilian variant occurred well vaccines came about, India‚Äôs variant well underway widespread vaccinations. Worrisome 25% hospitalized fully vaccinated. Doctor suspects delta didn‚Äôt test variant? mean, think /s needed, lol. sure got downvoted, friend mine wife got hit hard kids brushed fast. I've got kids can't vaccinated, everything keep protected. said that, vast majority kids 2 12 mild case. used phonetic alphabet (the one use spell things easily phone radio) spell word 'shield'. Almost sounds like cop show Uh got first shot March. Pandemic over.   Lol wish national security issue, yeah, I'd imagine will. should. statement false. Arizona Tea raised price $1.29 many locations.

Everything else correct, though. fucking annoying.

Co-worker's son, elite athlete member US Military vaccinated COVID knocked pneumonia blood clots lungs legs. Uh, someone peak physical condition taken easily COVID, anyone.

This war disinformation, targeted unsophisticated/easy-manipulated people, sadly tend certain demographic political party. Like, people friend groups vaccinated white Republican males.

Come fuck on, fucking stupid. weeks ago booked trip Paris early August. Precisely 15 days 2nd vaccin. Everything looked good.

Now country, Netherlands, covid ""Exploding"". Never heard use term before. Warnings made ECDC advisory map, meaning possible quarantaine become deep-red. 

And now, obviously, messages France itself.

It's absolutely crazy happening right now. 1.5 year bloody virus still takes scientists , politicians others completely surprise. know sure probably want compare hospitalization rate total population size. imagine seeing 2500% increase hospitalizations commenters probably correct, testing lagging behind causing ratio positive tests hospitalizations rise. v bad feeling Olympics‚Ä¶ Well that's happens one political group politicizes something actually medical issue. get counterproductive behavior. Would care December surge cases unvaccinated Americans hospitalizations deaths stayed low? took seriously I'm still careful year, half population vaccinated... time move may find social injustice political movement make whole personality. ""The crazy anti vaxxers might get problems spread people able get vaccine due health issues!""... That's cool story that's fault anti Vax people, can't stay inside scared another year. country run happy feelings good intentions.... Same. Buddy couldn‚Äôt comprehend hadn‚Äôt partying anything. Got mad flew wouldn‚Äôt hang packed bar scene downtown. 

Bro‚Ä¶wut. live two different dimensions USA concerned need someone fully vaccinated around fully vaccinated individuals? (Other like store workplace) unmasked around fully vaccinated people.

Also, word boosters yet? It‚Äôs like 9/10 mortality rate covid kids 12 low really worth altering society's behavior opinion. probably nearly safe covid fully vaccinated elderly people. even think required wear masks. also consider high enough risk get vaccinated emergency use authorization. I'm planning waiting full FDA approval vaccine kids 12 get kids vaccinated. unless new data come saying otherwise new strain emerges deadly young children. I'm opposed vaccines. got vaccine plan give kids convinced benefits way risks them. I'm yet. Yes, yes should. Fine, vaccine fix I've already Covid? Besides, that's hypothesis...where's data? Additionally, there's researchers believe vaccines thing, cause prion-protein-based diseases, there's that. Feel free get vaccine...i'll stick boosting immunity natural ways. true. I‚Äôm fit mild case COVID day day don‚Äôt notice anything wrong, cardio fitness taken huge hit cycle run, it‚Äôs 9 months point. VO2 max (measured Apple watch perfect) gone high end ‚Äúabove average‚Äù high end ‚Äúbelow average‚Äù post COVID That's really great. agree  Yes. part entrance boot camp receive something order 8-10 injections, administered assembly line system uses precursor start treks hypo spray. thought save meant giving someone girft immortality? Depends labeling libertarian. bucketing anyone right shouts ""freedumbs"" without thought right. talking old-school libertarians? Probably not. may *agree* everything espoused traditional libertarians, can't say traditional libertarian outlets like Reason Magazine followers anything incredibly consistent. past 35+ years consistently pro-gay marriage, pro-drug legalization, pro-gun, pro-choice, anti-foreign adventurism military spending, surprisingly balanced perspective economic issues like pros cons negative income taxes (i.e. universal basic income). 

Again, may *agree* positions, consistent. Now, people call ""libertarian"" hold traditional conservative values ""anti-gubment"" (except ""gubment"" intrusive people things like)? folks inconsistent all. definitely traditional libertarians. submission linking businessinsider.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Unless there's peer-reviewed study states Pfizer less effective Delta, worry much. peer reviewing important comes scientific studies. actual statistics that? Somebody must tracking that. I‚Äôm happy Masshole That's way less expecting. thought Lambda feared. Maybe chill bit. And? Mostly due concerns two shot vaccines possible link causing myocarditis mostly men. Johnson possible link blood clotting mostly women. Also Johnson still using older vaccine technology it‚Äôs one shot. want one shot don‚Äôt take days work, literally never take days work. Kinda feel like Dwight claiming never missed day work, probably jinxed lol. many people died like claim wouldn‚Äôt others voicing concern? say lied pulled number thin air? Sounds like want Covid, dying pardon pun. UK do. Covid respiratory disease, yea they're actually seeing present digestive illness younger people, rarely they're seeing neurological illness, older people respiratory illness. middle age people (20% around 40!) getting long covid. course people symptoms. /stupid.

finished you. July 1st, Delta variant hadn‚Äôt confirmed Travis County. bit you‚Äôll start seeing this.

I live Williamson county next county over. probably fifteen minutes frount door hospital person replied works several Delta cases, three confirmed May. certain Delta Travis county least since May. also high vaccination rate county. Yep. post viral tachycardia 6 months bradycardia year (the vaccine might helped resolve this).

I got sick March 2020, took 6 months heart rate stay 100 anything. regularly 130s making dinner. heart rate would randomly drop 39 midday. Cardiologist said would probably resolve, took right. people USA offered abundant vaccines one wants get them. poor country like mine people ready fist fight get vaccine. world cruel. negative long term side effects, would've appeared now. vaccines humans year now. Teachers? That‚Äôs teachers telling nurses. teachers working remotely. Yeah, know many people covid get tested, pretty worthless data. Impossible extrapolate make predictions accurate this.

Edit; entirely, excuse me. know positive rate testing 9% state, 9% people tested covid 28% ended hospitalized Exactly, already hear arguments like ""A regular vaccine takes 10 years properly studied, vaccine dangerous. guinea pigs"". goalposts move forever found looking jet injector never sick week that. lost 11 pounds week. ends leaky faucets worse deployment solid margin. 28% 590-600 people Rural areas tend significantly older sicker city areas, likelihood run people immune systems top functioning thus less effective immune reaction greater.  Thank understand. wearing crosses? UK Canada intervals generally 8 12 weeks shots, believe Israel US 3?  was/is pretty severe URI going around that's pretty contagious. knocked whole family month. kid got got pneumonia. 1yr old fever 12 days high 103.8. brutal us.

I thought sure COVID even though vaxed, tests wife tested negative.

We've another common cold since breeze comparatively. take full month get longer kick tail end cough. patience. step father Captain America??? anyone know % hospitalizations around time last year? last time pneumonia infected hundreds millions people around world killed 4+ millions year ? 

Do need remind EVERYONE risk they're vaccinated ? We've enough idiots anti-vaxxers around funny 99%-100% current deaths US unvaccinated. Good !  Nah, 8, think. thought everyone crossed  remember shot dreaded ""peanut butter"" shot. Talk uncomfortable. article ""Hudelson said majority staff vaccinated."" regular tests tell variant? Honest question. stats what, 99% deaths unvaccinated now? want be, pandemic you. don‚Äôt want vaccinate still deal shit. now, 166 people hospital COVID-19 statewide, 55 ICU. Yeah we're ways off. I'm surprised outcry terrible vaccine rollout yet. much really fucked waiting long buy them. 

Once supply it'll go fast, however. one last wave guess happens. Polls bullshit don‚Äôt believe them. Finally one good news today.

\- Australian sounds like easy profit us healthcare corporations! Ok, like
20:1 

You still want around bunch COVID-infected people. taking amount increase, yes. 100% increase doubling, 200% increase tripling, etc. I‚Äôm shocked statistic like 45% never believed pandemic friends family took seriously people would say it‚Äôs ...?? don‚Äôt believe numbers accurate. Totally agree you. think key word ‚Äúresearchers.‚Äù experiment. Noteworthy things happened. took note critical data. Science confirming hypotheses create theories. perhaps news might help lead better news. people don‚Äôt give shit, probably means little, I‚Äôll take much new/confirmed info Delta Variant get‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄôS STILL CIRCULATING PEOPLE! Hello??    think Delta variant likely cause severe case, can't tell anything 28% number - 28% number really shows people getting tested enough, sick people denial spreading around. Nice work guys.  understand. UK cases 20k/day week so.  dang. love perspective. would read essay exploring topic tbh Oh sarcastic?  due lack principles. Nice. Sounds like positive me. explain everyone else stupid you? point impossible know person contracted covid via contact air.

Given low enough community spread gene sequencing contract tracing, yes possible definitively know person contracted covid via air. Case studies Singapore show this, CCTV studies proven possible spread via contact nose.

That's possible full stop. China transmission via frozen fish packaging. mean fomite transmission regular thing. outside ideal conditions (dry, cold, UV). That's based 15 day lag, difference case peak death peak back Jan. joking, right?

Vaccines mandated extremely long time schooling system.

Not mention green card holders required get recommended vaccines. Coronavirus would common foe supposed unite people‚Ä¶.but wasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm thinking aliens won‚Äôt be. Political parties literally polarize deal aliens issue discussed. discarded found lacking.

Bringing yet make suddenly real, like times.  resident Georgia, I‚Äôm deeply envious. Hoping move Seattle years. I‚Äôve never fan south, even decade living here. past 2-4 years really cemented much need get here. one kid long term injury, kid passes older relative gets long term injury dies, big deal, right? look see vaccine study started 2020 targeted end 2023. That's long term suitable vaccine. think still emergency admission. lagging indicator Dude fuck?! sincere reply someone asking question. Un-remove please also roughly percentage supporters Girth Vader. Except‚Ä¶most cases US delta aren‚Äôt seeing surge. Deaths UK 90% lower per case last wave. Vaccines speeding up, less couple months went around 10% one dose 32% one dose 10.2% fully vaccinated. around 45-50% August end. Please...for love holy.... HURRY UP!   Economy Human Life; right? 

/s hard believe true. instance, Austin many critically ill Covid patients zero fully vaccinated ICU Covid patients. Every single critical Covid patient Travis County currently unvaccinated contracted illness. 

There‚Äôs one exception patient dialysis vaccines known adequately protect immune-compromised patients. read article. know says worry. fact information known first coming light scary me. unknown effects could possibly discovered coming months? addition absolutely awful experience vaccine past. wear mask public follow safety measures know could awful side effects Covid never happen. Rest Australia shut border NSW permanently did. Wrong. Memorial Day.   Maybe folks loved ones die covid grief. see might feel going back gonna happen them. Wait what!!  SPOILER: won't. possible Drop 1 vaccinations + social distancing + masking. Well judging grocery store situation, 100% believe without getting vaccinated. 7 27F here. Tested positive Covid around Christmas last year. live farm lifting 50lb bags grain hauling hay use bother me. Now, I'm practically breath feel muscles weakened immensely. 

POTS also discussed whenever stand heart rate jumps 110-130. Resting tends hover around 80s. 

Before fairly fit resting HR 55. absolutely unreal.  Nah Bro... lamba lamba lamba Omega Mu's! 

Just wait Omega Mu's killer 30% don‚Äôt believe ever started, perchance?  fucking tired brainwashed friends get vaccinated one reason other.

One get vaxed listened QAnon bullshit spouted nonsense microchips Bill Gates, told ""Oh, I'm living life, serious disease"" deaths made up/exaggerated.

One thinks babies literally aborted stem cells put straight test tubes make vaccine thinks hydroxychloroquine ivermectin save us all. listens confirmation bias bullshit rightwing podcasts spewing non-scientific crap. Oh also says refuse mask get tested employer (a private business) requires unvaccinated employees ""MuH LiBeRtY"", yet fails see hypocritical idiocy position also seems think bakeries (ALSO fucking private property!) refuse bake cakes lesbian weddings. Sure, private property rights exist convenient. Got it.

Another live terror inside house go outside, bleaches groceries, struggling depression, get vaccinated dad told vaccines work. Okay, good call. stay inside like hermit.

While seriously questioning decision making skills people, I'm honestly angry powers/influences brainwashed them. They're blind/manipulated realize unvaccinated USA weaker USA. USA people can't agree public health science sicker USA. medical costs COVID care long-term patients poorer USA. 

And they're white, male conservatives. intelligent people - fucking manipulation works. 

Really fucking sad. Thanks. think protection fit children's small faces. ear loops still seem loose, make tiny knot bottom, seal better.  Yea I'll damned I'm gonna wear mask 100% this. Death course terrifying, even ‚Äújust‚Äù long term potential side effects scary. still wearing mask solidarity kiddo. kids vaccinated, I'll saturation point emotionally. literally left house month (to get immune suppression medicine must infused oncology center) 15 months could get shot. I'm fully vaxed go did, I'm still careful kids access vaccinations yet.

Mask wearing I'm stuck long I'm current medication. Hopefully, covid mRNA vaccine works people immune suppression drugs better classical vaccines med wiped nearly past immunity. thing show titers tetanus. tested covid immunity yet, regardless, can't run around vulnerable measles, whooping cough, polio, etc, without mask.

So guess normal normal gets me. hug parents again, I'm good.  Sounds like right track. They're generally nice masks stand well PFE testing. concern various sources find search. Early pandemic reading death rates 80% range. looks like time lots different studies done results vary age groups. Things also improved time different treatments developed.

This meta analysis 69 different studies estimates overall case fatality rates 45%, actually majority. focusing studies done early epicenters showed overall fatality rate 67%. Pretty people allergic ingredients used make vaccines. Caution still needs used. folks dying stupidity. Covid-19 merely symptom worrisome illness. imagine humans colonize planets yet still bring 'rona smh. state unvaxxed people rarely bother get tested, even they‚Äôre sick. Unless end hospitalized, hospitals basically mandate test anyone admitted. So, one low population counties lot unvaxxed people, percentage positive covid tests strongly correlates number hospitalized people.

It feels good seeing someone say this. one beyond love everyone valuable, even they're total goons. ""play stupid games win stupid prizes"" mentality pro-vaccine version side. I'm going ordering Korean child-size KF 94s kids family. That's best we've able come with. wonder much spreading rural areas UK vs urban areas. they'll get Long COVID never able compete again.  What?  Thank goodness, worried life would like 120 years old. worry it.

If genes follow family history got another good 44 years left. guess safe get vaccine. see pneumonia number link? really going freak summer camp still? ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs zero!!‚Äù‚Ä¶come dude 

And already said others making point kids possible spreaders‚Ä¶the risk adults get vaccinated. camp camper! Next? Hey look, dumbass doesnt realize 2008 recession still major negative effects people's financial situations. dumbass. large variability household transmission, always guaranteed family member spouse gets it, fact think less 50%. Maybe multiple one minus efficacy vaccine estimate possibility transmission. Every post sub link article, many mainstream. idiots. headline exaggerates, it‚Äôs far off. people never considered started. 

This shit exhausting. amount ignorance science, malice money life, apathy people affects. 

We ""just live it"". need start working towards better educating people continue refuse it. shit long past absurd, much longer ignorant kill people that? ""They knew signed for""  matter pessimism optimism. matter facts. lot never same. answered literally, it'd big fat ""no"" people. Work, housing, health, loved ones, etc changed nearly everyone. almost Covid-19 vaccines prevent Covid-19. 80% Florida...

- Embarrassed Floridian 6 minutes obviously hyperbole, point supply chain never even slightly weakened. It‚Äôs people hoarding stuff stores didn‚Äôt change restocking schedules. warehouses full entire time. never came close shortage toilet paper, let alone food.

As lumber prices, it‚Äôs matter demand rather supply. People stuck home nothing renovate. supply never changed. dead sever Covid‚Ä¶so asymptotic kids. even arguing then? Covid cause brain damage kids over.  it‚Äôs AIRborne then? One side what? That‚Äôs nuts tried positive realistic. can't even imagine. Dude still unconcerned *hundreds thousands* deaths country within year? really capable understanding happened him? 


That straight horrifying.  sub mainstream media usa still pretty firmly it. cdc recommends states allow ""exceptional"" circumstances states seem following that. 67% vaccinated. Masks still used. Places requiring vaccination entry. Schools requiring masks distance. Long ways away it. Get lit. Actually restrictions unpopular, cause adherence sharply drop. considered people reasonable they‚Äôre recommendations, people inclined adhere. hand, people willing adhere milder restrictions may get annoyed harsher restrictions simply stop following even rules spite.

This actually well researched phenomenon. restrictions can‚Äôt decided based would ideal theory. decided based population actually do. Doctors Australia advising anyone 60 take it, due risk blood clots higher risk catching dying covid People lost friends Covid. Like friendships. Anti-maskers normal people butting heads ended ton relationships since showed true unpleasant colors peers. Kamala Harris doctors tell us take it, I‚Äôll first line take it, absolutely. Donald Trump tells us take it, I‚Äôm taking it.‚Äù

This well announcement Pfizer vaccine 90% effective, lot uncertainty effective safe vaccines would turn be. concerned scenario vaccines turned unsafe and/or ineffective, Donald Trump still tried pressure Americans take it, maybe even pressuring FDA approve inappropriately. Fortunately vaccines *did* turn highly effective safe. ""The researchers studied whether amount virus found air enough actually infect another person.""

I would expect much higher transmission rates highly infectious without droplets. Either can't get past defenses small numbers. say able determine active not. light particle remain airborne long time virus cannot reproduce health hazard. Airborne means ""able jump hosts causes disease withouta droplet"" detect air. exactly wait spring start trials younger children? Would nice approved - too. That‚Äôs all, I‚Äôm pissed assholes won‚Äôt. variants-are causing much bullshit. don‚Äôt need crap, them.. yup walk store. Maybe why. pissed. agree, think there's lot people normally get vaccinations would opt covid vaccination. 90+% avoidable. sad. 2.1 cases per 1 mass vaccination 3 people per million alarmist misguided. That‚Äôs roughly 30% voted Trump. surprising. 3 denied ever existing i'd wager, also 3 think earth flat little homeless guy JFK jr, on... also reaction either shot antibodies. seems vary wildly people's response it. Again, care fascination Dr Bob Sears. correcting blatant anti-vaxxer nonsense posting. go get jab stop selfish Yeah too. fact, life improved tremendously.  Look surge new cases UK. weeks ahead us Delta Variant taking over, higher vaccination rate U.S. Daily new cases already high 1st wave. hey, U.S. declared effectively over. Famous last True, also section population least risk disease. really par regular flu kids. Many states COVID related child point, they're risk mom dad's driving habits. it‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ flimsy excuse. remove it, produce another - even requires make-believe.

When next spike moves unvaccinated communities US, might see modest increase vax participation. 

Might.

So next time somebody asks example irony, perfect one playing real time literally life death, economic, social, cultural implications concerned. 1. highly protected death, still get sick.
2. Getting sick lead transmission.
3. See 1. lost family member close friend something else (not covid) weren‚Äôt able see 18+ months missed opportunity grieve attending funeral. lost life changing opportunities completely depleted savings planned use buy house. happen family member husband‚Ä¶they CLOSE walk thru entire payment saved care 2 kids lost jobs (they work specialized jobs industries completely shut pandemic). savings took 10+ years build + came inheritance. They‚Äôre devastated traumatized almost homeowners almost homeless. pull number from? here. friend put way helped. 

""Remember high school, life people share society with"" Vaccines make completely immune. prime immune system recognise fight virus. still become infected, especially compromised immune system, become less sick fight much quickly. Can‚Äôt wrong forever Even life goes back ""normal"" life never again. pandemic made realize selfish terrible people really are. I'm vaccinated still normal activities simply hate people now; idea normal activities types people around completely ruins enjoyment could come it. doubt I'll ever eat restaurant, go bar, movies, etc ever I'd thinking large percentage people room absolutely selfish, terrible people.  never heard idiom? meek shall inherit earth‚Ä¶ way could realistically choose get COVID would completely isolate human (and animal COVID carrier) contact rest life. Much less inconvenience get harmless vaccine Gotta higher that. I'd think like least 2/10 Americans think real pandemic ever happened, guess get survey. Yeah, Brazil experiment sinovac vaccine concluded need 85+% vaccinated people order start seeing better results. This. beyond embarrassed lack empathy intelligence country (USA) full display past 15 months. live Democratic state high vaccination rate; still selfish idiots every turn. true sickness though. immune system reacting invader couple days realizes fine reaction shuts off. quite: states like WA Tasmania seal borders 3 months however long takes Pfizer/Moderna arrive.  one really offends people local chemist work they're obviously sick. Like full croaky voices, obviously, visibly ill. know better policies keep sick people away public. stopped using mine calorie tracking would count steps typing adding additional calories burned. app telling consume 3.5K day match calorie burn; work desk day occasional tasks around home. Lambda real? thought previous poster kidding.  Dang America hit vaccination ceiling weeks ago, news.  point, chance least might get vaccination rate again. That's sad. Especially everyone vaccinated. What's point getting vaccinated going locked anyways? :( thinking hefty number. wonder ones still health problems virus, still grieving loved one. setback employment education. took roughly year stop feeling like coughing fluid, crushed it, every time walked flight stairs laughed. I‚Äôm 30‚Äôs otherwise healthy, even walked 20-25 miles **per day** (worked feet) prior COVID.

I definitely understand 40%. What? guess depends means. expect virus lasting impact various ways. necessarily mean anything bad. Maybe means we're bit conscious contagious diseases take care pass on. lol virus doesn‚Äôt want host die infects less people doesn‚Äôt replicate. Thus viruses deadly evolve infectious less deadly versions. Ebola example contagious it‚Äôs evolved become less deadly still exist. jabs pfizer April
I tested positive last week. 
I wear mask Everytime go out. 
I've ate once, outings grocery. news social media, would known pandemic? definitely would they're elderly. grandma 98 think live see us truly ""go back normal"". 

Her old folks home allowing eat dining room November, even though everyone staff vaccinated. want eat alone anymore. sure kind jobs employers - norm anyone knew 2000s. doctor's note flu? Digestive issue? would take week get doctors could look it. 

I think would gone exhaustive detail illness first time asked.  There‚Äôs zero reason virus become

*How* *to grade* also correct misinformation encounter one defining challenges past year. title, tough real lions infected. Possible since tigers got infected zoo. allergies indoor component. I‚Äôm horribly allergic dust mites ragweed. 

We‚Äôre talking ‚ÄúMy GP ran allergy test intake said woah, need allergist allergy shots NOW,‚Äù level bad. know got damn many sinus infections kid.

The bidet thing? They‚Äôre currently UPS truck factory. ordered one toilet house.  I‚Äôm exactly boat. Monitoring news variants holding back more, especially since it‚Äôs summer many outdoor options. feel like it‚Äôs I‚Äôm vaccinated? 160 youths immunity Covid-19 suffer maybe sniffles mean clearly option, seeing that's decision they've taken.

Whether correct course action take debated, title paper demonstrably untrue good start. actual fuck? First time awhile I‚Äôve genuinely shocked one statistics, loootttt people going wish vaccinated coming weeks. Fools.  ""The finding unexpected interesting, unfortunately say whether virus transported way certain distance air fact contagious‚Äù, senior researcher Jostein Gohli Norwegian Defence Research Establishment said. Yeah young healthy like get told September. delta variant last variant. vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent infection, rather reduces severity. COVID endemic. constant change. reason human race existed long part population adapt change faster changes. Seeking old norms survival strategy. I‚Äôve going stores, bars, restaurants regularly since reopened May 2020 Article says majority Chileans Sinovac Strategic Advisory Group Experts Immunization (SAGE) also completed review vaccine. basis available evidence, recommends vaccine use adults 18 years older, two-dose schedule spacing two four weeks. Vaccine efficacy results showed vaccine prevented symptomatic disease 51% vaccinated prevented severe COVID-19 hospitalization 100% studied 51% efficacy symptomatic infection, numbers unsurprising. pretty much over, cases states hundreds. Oh, got shot back February fully vaxxed March. lot health issues pretty much recluse decade hit. really got medical appointments. health situation vastly improved past years, suddenly got urge get CDC made mask announcement May.

Last night rough #@&amp;-+(* guts.
1am onward Fever, chills, body aches/sensitivity, pain, delirious, arm useless, splitting headache, nausea, cramping, energy.

My wife small headache sore arm. Nut surprising given vaccinated also likely get tested. also positivity rates insanely high many states despite high overall case loads (yet). 

Missouri news mini-spike, #5 positivity rate. top 5 are: 


Kansas - 16.9% 

Arkansas - 15.7% 

Mississippi - 14.7% 

Oklahoma - 14.1% (surprise surprise!) 

Missouri - 14.1% 


Don't test often tests come back positive severe due selection bias.  They're probably measuring different things. data Israel showing vaccine mid 60s preventing infection, still high severe illness. Gotta make sure doesn‚Äôt get water It‚Äôs I‚Äôm well, time I‚Äôm hesitant believe thing.  government added vaccine 93% effective preventing severe disease hospitalizations, compared 97% reported medical journal Lancet May. 3 10 Americans saying believing craziest stuff possibly imagine too. Time keeper variants think heard expert radio say cases deaths lower flu, that's level society deemed acceptable open up. think that's great yardstick, course global, vaccine supply limited much world, can't open everything one day. slowly opening (California). companies running computer clusters Houston pull out, saying longer reliable business  Nah man, soon - THINK covid spread it.

/s

Seriously, though - hope thing you.

*fingers crossed* ""We believe government embarking dangerous unethical experiment, call pause plans abandon mitigations July 19, 2021."" Well im 27 im range lol thanks sorry late reply. Yes. I'm trying talk co workers listen excuse knowing :( . keep hoping talk getting vaxxed now, chance immunity fall winter, make far. far luck. :( starting get bad around here, spreading fast.  dont understand thatthough. im average joe. im vaccinated. currently plethora doctors saying continue mask public situations yet ppl still dont.. Despite careful ended terrible cough, ever since I've elevated heart rate. good news slowly going back normal.

I can't help wonder false negative. Oklahoma that‚Äôs okay. Onerous debt? Bankruptcy chapter 7? got cards play. year though? studies I've seen, asymptomatic spread among vaccinated really, really low. really hard believe studies want trust. contradicting studies seems like false information spread.

Until start seeing vaccinated people dying delta strain strain matter, I'm going worry. told get shot go back normal life, I'm doing. Right. Vaccines available. I‚Äôm going continue putting life hold account millions idiots refuse help themself. Well considering around 17% US population age 12 yeah 80% would cap Yes. cold now! ""Findings studies suggest risk SARS-CoV-2 infection via fomite transmission route low, generally less 1 10,000, means contact contaminated surface less 1 10,000 chance causing infection""

[Per sources three studies right there.

I recall study referring to. also described things like cardboard remember correctly. big knock study lab conditions real world conditions. Worked polio smallpox Yes government DGAF us Japanese citizens.

They acted way WW2. Sacrifice us pawns ego profits. I'll back up, I've heard still get vaccinated even got it. way one person explained vaccine goes deep inside you. may caught nose mouth, therefore produce lot antibodies. vaccine makes sure immune system ready catch again. Yup, POTS confirm. symptoms 9 months infection it‚Äôs finally getting better. also considering flying fall. definitely wait. probably reduce cases, would pause growth two weeks. even lockdown would complied with, happen. reality lockdown would probably slow growth two weeks soon unlock go right back were. 

Look month long November lockdown, longer suggesting, fairly high compliance (higher would get now) Delta varient spreading. reduced cases little bit short time. 

As much dislike Boris agree said now, when? Either unlock face summer exit wave, unlock everyone chance get doses get winter exit wave (with associated healthcare pressures) stay restrictions summer 2022. known day zero, China able provide many vaccines. Sinovac provided 10 times many doses Pfizer. 

Still 66% holding Gamma Lambda variants pretty good efficacy book. Yeah, EU really focus getting Johnson &amp; Johnson shots many young people possible, [like Ireland get protected soon possible life get back normal. never met anyone crashed plane obviously plane crashes fake‚Ä¶   article implies mostly due staff quarantines causing issues Ordnance looking data? *very* clear found local case bottom cases started rise - decent clip many states. look ""real time"" 7-day nationwide average, lot masked states reporting less frequently inherent dip testing due holiday weekend. addition, US never steep curve small European countries simply spread regional national curve layering smaller curves state region within state. 

Even high-vaccination areas (e.g., Bay Area, Massachusetts, etc) starting see uptick threshold herd immunity risen dramatically higher R0 Delta. 

This alarmist. People access safe, effective vaccines limit harm choose take advantage them. nationwide, cases *are* rising *will* rise more, hospitalizations (especially low-vaccination states). probably tuck much Southern Illinois Missouri soon. sorry anxiousness fear. available you. home? athletes supposed test leave arrive. different protocols different countries. list ten countries include UK stricter protocols. ""all"" us really think, back Feb '20, would blow two months? 

In US metaphorical thumbs asses watching closely since late Dec '19 kind figured would around least another 6 months. think Feb 2020 would surprised learn still raging year half later.

This could've prevented, maybe, noticed first Nov/Dec silenced various governments proactive prepared. I'm Giles here. person wearing mask gathering suddenly obligated protect others obligation exist anyone else? 
At point mask like swim vest: Protection yourself, nothing else. analogy criticising person bringing floatie case one others wearing vests might need it.  concerned. unvaccinated main (like long shot) spreaders people getting sick Delta variant. kids showing too. would tell get hotel limit they're going. putting kids risk, frankly. even yourselves, vaccine 100% protection.  actually need sequence site mutation, simpler whole genome virus small, they're also monitoring new unexpected mutations. state borders Missouri part state starting see increases things still pretty low city side state. RSV making lost time lock downs masks limiting spread Cold area ended virtually covid measures, me. Probably 50-50 masking, social distancing, etc means colds back vengeance. ""just two weeks bruh"" think exactly right what's missing study's headline. really good methods detecting viruses things ridiculously low levels, ""can"" detected, mean interpretdd contagious.   Yeah never got ne either. entered 90's. Maybe started afterwards?  Well. true vaccinated people act filter immune escape variants, also true people active infections (i.e. unvaccinated) higher chances producing them. 

Tbh. lot sounds like fear mongering. true world yet unvaccinated variants breed speak. time, know immunocompromised people actually true variant breeders. 

If really want stop new variants, need vaccinate lock hard shut borders close. one going comply anyway birdbrain, I've seen hardly masks. Way sacrifice lives make point. I'm county low vaccination rate high Delta variant Covid positive rate. Hospitals full. Nobody cares. chiefs frustrated staff still quarantine 10 days identified contact someone Covid, even though Covid vaccinations. fear even health workers stay away work coming weeks Covid infections soar Sajid Javid admitted could soon 100,000 cases say ‚Äúthe logical date‚Äù release NHS staff duty quarantine 19 July, ‚ÄúFreedom Day‚Äù remaining restrictions social contact lifted England, even though scientists believe dangerous premature.

So UK NHS maybe *too* cautious, direct opposite US hospitals want hear anything staff exposures even test staff serious symptoms.  us seperate community terrible living conditions

I mean counties states lowest vaccination rates exactly known quality life begin with... doubt anybody would even notice difference. really give reason clusters article. Mentions poor access health care. shortage vaccine areas? ample dosis vaccine people can't get it? people want vaccine? number one....said exhausted irony clear  think kids way adaptable adults. mask stuff really much different putting pair shoes brushing teeth leaving house.

I still wish vaccine would available sooner September 12. timing really sucks. Probably good rule thumb treat personal anecdote see internet decent chance made try get factual information published studies reliable sources. Delta definitely outcompeting lineages cause case increases (particularly vaccination rates low), beyond that, I'd evaluate information carefully. Japan declared state emergency. see many Americans denial, absolutely another COVID fall/winter rate.  one gets variant immune current vaccines. 

On hand, things get bad areas lots anti-vaxxers maybe they‚Äôll start take things seriously.  know steroids work? always make bigger. Makes sense. like new serious threat like polio defend against. Yeah mean squeeze every last drop headline anxiety moving next thing.  know smallpox always symptomatic? know efforts look asymptomatic smallpox cases? two three people per million relieved know vaccine squad carry epipens. 100% certainty really case anything medicine, humans diseases infect complicated. greatly decreased 0% chance becoming infected greatly decreased 0% chance becoming seriously ill get infected. Nothing life certain, pretty well protected 2 shots mRNA vaccines! Studies ongoing quantify much exactly, chances getting really sick ending hospital low. think might something. UK Canada used test-negative methodology referred sequencing records. Israeli study even published full methodology say ""they used surveillance data."" *fully* approved. ""emergency use authorization"" currently. analysis researchers Georgetown University identified 30 clusters counties low vaccination rates significant population sizes. five significant clusters sprawled across large swaths southeastern United States smaller portion Midwest. five clusters largely parts eight states, starting east Georgia stretching west Texas north southern Missouri. clusters also include parts Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma Tennessee, made mostly smaller counties also cities Montgomery, Alabama; Shreveport, Louisiana; Amarillo, states currently seeing increases Covid-19 cases. repealed mask mandate hospitalization rate SKYROCKETED way 10 people per quarter million 1 person per quarter million.  9 months...? know USA spike cases following Independence Day celebrations. 

At point, talking hospitalization mortality statistics comes US vaccinations lessened likelihood despite increases cases due delta variant. fucking idiot could sold Trump masks

They'd cost 50 cents make overseas sweatshop, could sell 40 bucks pop sell millions. think businessman great claims would've seen huge opportunity like that.

He could've made millions dollars profit, kept pandemic check sailed easy re-election. would talk doc that, honestly. know family's medical history better. immediate reaction draw hard ""no vaxx visit"" boundary them, situation bit different--I'm basically dad's caretaker, can't get vaccine he's adverse reactions shots virus practically designed kill him. (My mom also chronic respiratory issues could lead complications, we're vaccinated healthier is.)

I also acknowledge I'm currently middle disagreement extended family issue, could coloring feelings. None vaccinated suspect one cousins partner actively spreading anti-vaxx misinformation 82 year old Grandma want get shot. Said cousin also sending guilt-trippy texts I'm living fear, neglecting family (but especially Grandma diabetic heart patient), selfish ""little flu"". family members texting vague blogging Instagram. currently lot plate particular buggaboo lol.

Should known vaccine political issue... true story normal get sick that? got never felt anything.  Sorry, I‚Äôm bit tipsy right now, didn‚Äôt get said. Many apologies!!! ones hitting hard right emerged vaccines, including Delta contagious virulent.

As spreads presymptomaticly there‚Äôs reason less virulent forms virus win out.  makes virus likely reverse zoonosis..

It's huge misconception immunocompromised people live bubble lives never leave homes. Reddit likes believe misconception feel guilty blowing immunocompromised people's concerns everything reopens. 

Tons immunocompromised people completely normal lives prior covid, would like able get back normal safely too! looking impossible moment. problem government making accommodations vulnerable persons. fine lift restrictions lay risk/responsibility feet already ill, disabled person may able cope needlessly suffer.

The vaccine best protection get, much better previously infected. vaccine targets spike protein, least likely part virus change. natural infection, immune system's reaction nearly targeted. That‚Äôs said. said vaccinated people spread original virus. Variants result virus facing challenge adapt. I‚Äôm vaccine, I‚Äôm make sure people take safely prevent variants spreading. science incredibly poor believe variants occur unvaccinated people partially vaccinated.   know odds. one does. know lots got sick, know percent kids typically long term impacts. girlfriend 33 29 respectively. us Pfizer + Moderna. got laid day, day half.

Otherwise virus faced half challenge still ability adapt adjust body‚Äôs immune response.  though meant everyone US military. would interesting. Chinese seems fair game bash it.

Few Western media would use wording AZ J&amp;J, even though could say exactly thing. think got info? highly recommend down-voters actually look it. makes sense unvaccinated people force virus change. careful period first second shot, stay isolated couple weeks second body time make necessary defenses. Otherwise producing spreading variants. France say ""masks useless""? I'm still surprised mandated yet especially deployed living crowded barracks sleeping bunk beds well naval vessels. they? That's risk renting - rent closely follow shifts housing supply demand.  deal 25 years ago. Basically walking gauntlet pneumatic shots arms holding vaccine hand warm up. last station drop shorts get vaccine butt. none besides Canada put recently thats single dose. fact people saying Pfizer spotlight vaccines likely show reduced numbers same. misinformation get started. Theyre probably similar two doses. People dumb.  NJ, thinking it. governor announced would left districts June. premature districts come pronouncements yet, still 2 months school starts. 

I suspect, since vaccines widely available September &lt;12, masks depend case prevalence community, least NJ. course, states require masks matter what. I've gotten alpha coronavirus, still possible get delta coronavirus?  education long term effects vaccine?  Cases always low, aren‚Äôt.

**Edit**: Feel free ignore; found several comments logic apply swine flu?

&amp;#x200B;

Do people duty get vaccinated swine flu prevent mutations? would compare demographics people getting it. 

I would guess unvaccinated young people vaccinated get get sick old. 

You can't compare raw percentages. obvious story also meant divide. virus mutate somewhere world affect everyone. pretend American south place stands us virus eradication hilarious. Alpha Delta emerged elsewhere. Alphas case spawned one lockdown obsessed countries Europe.. 

We need full regulatory approval really start issuing mandates brother stopped alright last 20+ years. also leave home.  Montgomery County lowest vaccine hesitancy America Baltimore still mask restrictions. state taken seriously since start outside Eastern shore shockingly votes Republican every year. Fall shutdowns ‚Ä¶ come. Didn‚Äòt happen.  doubt it! find age classified cfr unvaccinated people sure publications NHS check CFR unvaccinated people page 15. 1st february. 

also todays news know maybe confirmation bias. decent thing do, opportunity hurt others, zero cost you?

It's one sensible enough look ways crossing busy street. mean say something see someone stepping front car, case even little like nudging go step front since actively something might hurt them. got RSV May. sounds like RSV. Yes is, first mRNA vaccines ever used mean I'm glad pill coming. saves lives guess really care people make profit it. Better alternative guess. much fuck dfid give swine flu pandemic decade ago? Life uh... finds way. 

In seriousness, virus/organism relationships always arms race. guarantees virus can‚Äôt mutate, it‚Äôs matter probability. takes single point mutation virus change become effective, happen. takes 3, 5, 10 20 simultaneous changes likelihood drops exponentially. always *could*. They're trying stir shit vaccines again. disease NEEEEEDS political. Yes, general selfishness ignorance traits tend negative impact society. Less testing.

Vaccinated people little reason test unvaccinated people little interest testing, people aren‚Äôt testing unless noticeable symptoms. end restrictions.

That's keep telling people case count area likely off. People get tested unless severe symptoms. Taiwan king free vaccine FDA approved yet. One mandatory. considering making mandatory early. true, hammered courts military experimented troops without consent. Informed consent required medical procedures except normally exempted civilian life (e.g. life-saving procedures performed patient conscious otherwise able give informed consent, even numerous restrictions kinds procedures performed situations).

If want read state informed consent military medicine, I'd recommend paper: 

* McManus, John, et al. ""[Informed consent ethical issues military medical Academic emergency medicine 12.11 (2005): 1120-1126.--*Informed consent military research shares many fundamental principles regulations govern civilian biomedical research. fact, much modern research ethics grounded events occurred context war government-sponsored research.*

So military require get appropriate medical treatments considered safe mainstream use treatments impact combat readiness (e.g. getting relevant, approved vaccines travelling overseas). soon anything fully approved (which EUA vaccinations currently count as) fully informed consent. Mutations happen time. ones make likely survive reproduce ones take stick around. often reproduce, chances mutate mutates way makes contagious able reproduce, trait going spread become common.  Pfizer.  Mutations random. break happen anywhere.

However, mutations pass ones spread easily. That's viruses tend evolve something less lethal, contagious. area large chunk vaccinated people, ones spread easily either super contagious among unvaccinated (aka, Delta) mutations move easily among vaccinated.

That's talk countries high rates vaccine hesitancy potential hotbeds escape mutations. There's selective pressure pass along. countries unvaccinated comes bit chance, contagious mutations pass on, may may harmful vaccinated.

Virus enter vaccinated person reproduce fast enough outrun immune response.  grandparent 3rd world country? first trial COVID-19 vaccine started March 2020.

Since then, we've hundreds thousands participate vaccine trials throughout rest 2020, approval general population vaccination beginning 6 months ago.

So, last 6 months we've given *3 billion* covid vaccination investigate bit further. months time could really regret statement.

If information danger, please tell. could possibly dangerous vaccines would worth stopping pandemic that's already killed 4 million people?  Ive heard anyone questioning people‚Äôs bodily autonomy.  one forcing people vaccinated. Business require don‚Äôt work patronize them.  joining military, like said, lose autonomy. mean plenty older unvaccinated folks third world countries, I'm sure statement really holds up. new variant likely come guy's grandpa say... grandpas living densely packed slums developing countries access vaccine? How? 10-20 Looks right presumably includes people obese, diabetic, and/or risk factors increasing likelihood hospitalization? risk like don‚Äôt obvious risk factors must, definition, quite bit lower. mean, helps directly, immediately breathing exhalation. away better. can‚Äôt destroy economy protect unvaccinated Californians. Get vaccinated, stay fuck home, die (except you‚Äôre eligible vaccine yet). Vaccine passports answer going mandate vaccines. Fine, get vaccine, get anything want do, little baby. difference I'm protected now, last summer. 

That huge portion people calculate risk tolerance. right I've reread comment. vaccinated person, genuinely give fuck. shit me.   hurts idc, let learn hard way. way take seriously....i'm work, article unvaccinated people right? 

Someone call i'll delete this. Considering contagious Delta variant particular? Yes, much greater risk. Vaccinated people spreading virus. You‚Äôre joking‚Ä¶ Every major news outlet America paywall now. Alternatively, Google headline find free somewhere. July 4th celebrations won‚Äôt help either. Lol it‚Äôs summer 2021 still people advocating LoCkDoWn HaRd.

Get fucking grip, please. saying essentially means people need get vaccinated...something currently vaccinated little control over.. absolutely over. We've driving east coast think covid covid restrictions masks etc last two weeks.

Everything normal capacity, crowded, unmasked. includes hotels,bars,stores,everything.

The sign something weird staffing shortages. Real talk, point over? Yes assumed meant regular mask people wear.  started dealing extreme depression (including suicidal ideology) 5-6 years old spot - mom severe mental health issues always refused acknowledge always shifted blame feelings onto me. People sub reflexively moved ‚Äúbut long Covid kids‚Äù respond everything. studies talk flawed Paywall?  point children.

This great article talking people fighting change misconception, reported wired:

[wired article don‚Äôt think blame denial solely reasons describe, agree sure bad actors motive. Seriously? primarily calling ""droplets"" assume using mean droplets 100 micron, we'd see lot outdoor transmission since gravity behaves way outdoors.  See Florida link? bright spot, unless, *somehow*, reporting accurate... I‚Äôm saying wrong there‚Äôs couple things consider: study August October 2020 alpha delta show increase children catching it. study didn‚Äôt say surveillance testing I‚Äôm assuming kept track reported cases could mean went uncounted due kids much less likely tested. Bruh county 80% fucking percent...surrounding ones 70+%.

Near vaccinated...so see practicing mitigation measures, there's reason to. rate end July everyone either vaccinated gotten virus 0 cases august! /s MA. High vaccination rate, ton state tourists around right now. Texas license plates around again, well Florida Carolinas. That's definitely acting state right now. Movement summer impact states shit, reopening state full capacity Disneyland sporting events. first third links data specific kids suggest it‚Äôs severe children alpha. second link paywalled. Military mandating would irresponsible since it‚Äôs approved FDA fully. Imagine doesn‚Äôt get approval X reason soldiers it. risky. been, rare.  undid two months ""lockdown"" one week. 

Quite impressive actually  spirit 'random' found photo someone handling mouse last year online.http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/60440421 bother person particular, note thousands observations like online.

That‚Äôs mess we‚Äôre in, nobody wearing mask mattered, aka home Gotcha. Well, hope everyone stays healthy. It‚Äôs worth checking symptoms 1-shot unvaccinated well article. compare covid changes vaccinations problem mRNA vaccines give symptoms disease.

That... sound right. private schools going vaccinate /s look it, whole species, failed. many people easily brainwashed can‚Äôt even find common ground middle fuckin pandemic, species dumb getting dumber minute really survive much longer? next crisis could serious fatal, 40% us rooting crisis show 60% idiots. zero faith humans. serious colds going around now. wife daughter it. Sure likely get worse vaccinated... COVID. I‚Äôve heard current enlisted members it‚Äôs suggested get it. DeSantis denier?
He'll blame anyone take responsibility. Don‚Äôt allow unvaccinated people public hospitals Probably because, like many, desperately try grab simplistic incomplete news snippet consider universal absolute truth?

Masks work - mean perfect

Vaccines work - mean protect 100% everything

Physical distance helps - mean there's magical barrier 6 feet

Covid transmitted droplets - mean also exist aerosol

Covid airborne - mean someone spitting face suddenly harmless

Think take awhile Delta variant number total COVID cases dropped since last peak, seeing hyperlocal outbreaks lower vaccinated areas. 

Read one researcher another r/coronavirus post say Delta transmission new US seems spreading rurally first (the original urban rural).  Nothing researcher formally pin right now.

Still make bet, I‚Äôd worried upcoming fall weather lower vaccinated areas (mostly rural).   realistic second, know Nebraska going require masks know sure won‚Äôt limit attendance way. 
But, communities vaccination rates teens, prior infection rate much higher, know isn‚Äôt preferable substitute vaccination, makes thing concern little overblown.

Especially considering trip planned couple weeks. type fda.gov consider good enough. Cite actual evidence backing difference EUA FDA approval 100% lower threshold results data collected.

This personal decision, also public forum spreading disinformation vaccines, could harmful others' views toward them. want vaccine, care. least honest why. admit either wrong lied EUA. high risk get vaccinated.

No. Everybody get vaccinated, regardless risk. I‚Äôd pissed first ones bring up. Lol Israeli data comes information assumptions made methodology. worthless until/unless proper study published. Perhaps long cultural memory suffering diseases settlers brought ‚Äú TwO MoNthS LoCkDoWns RuINeD!!!!‚Äù

I find alarming also funny many people think lockdowns work long term. 

LOCKDOWNS NEVER END PANDEMIC ! general medical guidance listen body don‚Äôt force body doesn‚Äôt feel it. CDC still studying link myocarditis/pericarditis small number primarily younger people vaccinated don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worst idea take easy days least vaccinated safe. cautious opinion based studies they‚Äôve conducted.  Singapore's Ministry Health released Given emerging data small risk myocarditis pericarditis observed vaccination mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, Expert Committee COVID-19 Vaccination recommends vaccinated persons, particular adolescents younger men, received dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, avoid exercise strenuous physical activity one week vaccination. time, vaccinated persons seek medical attention promptly develop chest pain, shortness breath abnormal heartbeats. doctors also vigilant around clinical presentations interesting see regulators follow suit. can't Olympics without fans spectators around. I‚Äôm worried higher hospitalization seniors one dose. According CDC they‚Äôre risk, delta, I‚Äôm guessing there‚Äôs even less protection one dose now. 

The CDC released numbers seniors fully partially vaccinated multistate network U.S. hospitals January‚ÄìMarch 2021, receipt Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna COVID-19 vaccines 94% effective COVID-19 hospitalization among fully vaccinated adults 64% effective among partially vaccinated adults aged ‚â•65 It‚Äôs shameful huge problem societies [Idaho right now. noone ever looks bottom shoes. I'd look People mutate viruses viruses learn. something lot Americans say vaccination rates certain states cities sky high take account. higher relative rest US, even quite poor compared countries. Fear. Fear. Fear. Fear.

How many people died TB today? Heart disease? people died car accidents today died Covid.

Stop shit. Also they're country legends, holy shit feel bad know matter vaccines 100% protect hospitalization death long term effects. 

I care catching essentially cold point, care dying spreading it.  did, fixed. Alpha case spawned UK mid-September eased lockdowns weeks back resurgence cases flowed september. full regulatory approval gonna slow ever viable, need immediate action, politics Everyone willing get vaccinated already knows this. everyone never believe it. feel pain, post get deleted faster Donald Trump moves miss universe pageant (10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... always told ""science"" mutations grow weaker, way around. us already vaxxed americanos give rats ass this? local symphony orchestra, I'm sure COVID-19 found 4 meters away Tuba Trumpet players. Yeah I've seen people imply high rates vaccination could cause vaccine-resistant mutations, think that's really works. Luckily we've given 17 million+ doses vaccine even single shot protects serious disease hospitalization.

46% adults fully vaccinated 77% adults least partially vaccinated.

If end hospital either a) extremely unlucky young person, b) heavily immunocompromised, c) anti-vax lazy.

It would surprise hospitalizations deaths meaningful variable wave. Long-haul COVID seems biggest risk, although symptoms seem broad vague I'm sure size risk. we'd dealing 10%+ levels serious symptoms I'd expect millions patients USA appear case. 

The exit wave always going happen. stupid happens now, we'd much better shape 3 weeks, think vaccines going save asses pretty spectacular way.  Agreed. India particular huge issue right now. Vaccines increase risk mutations. See: [COVID-19 vaccines dampen genomic diversity SARS-CoV-2: Unvaccinated patients exhibit antigenic mutational Sorry realistic pessimism.

No need apologies calling way is. Long neck ice cold vaccines never broke heart! changed lyrics still test positive you‚Äôre vaccinated.

I bet worth Country legends though. Exactly. People shitting Japan saying they're money really simple. They're lose money, make money. anyone greedy IOC essentially forcing go this. disagree, snarky way want get Green Card btw. remember sifting room half hour getting injected kinds vaccines. No...it seem work like that. Older folks, like - get lots symptoms. I'm (cough, ahem) 57. 24 hours, taking Epsom salt baths aching muscles joints, turned a/c, laid bed whole time. worth it. OPEC vaccinated, little reason worry. There's societal reason worry contagious could spark new wave cases. would mostly among younger, healthier people since older, sicker people vaccinated, we'll less hospitalization death. hospitalization death go back somewhat delta wave. short - people need go get damn shot. Humanity survive we‚Äôre tougher roaches spread like rats. It‚Äôs question many hundreds millions even billions die hands stupidity, ignorance, greed others real deadly crises start coming around. Salvage value. revenue better zero revenue plus penalties, gov Japan playing chicken IOC athletes between. 

If athletes support staff 80% vaccinated might able eek something  2 weeks now, thankfully Pfizer keeping hospital, I'm severely fatigued, bed bound 2 weeks now. Breathless, etc feels like flu times 3 me. 

I'd hate think would facing without vaccine. affects severely. still pretty decent cold everyone else. Yeah, think Israel tracking asymptomatic infections that's getting calculated others testing strictly efficacy ends bit place. mean, think Delta booster definitely horizon though. Amazing essentially raw data little explanation measured headline news around world, yet legitimate studies promptly ignored. media continuing push worst case scenario narrative cost. enough research done say sure, many doctors recommended that.

Anecdotally, intense work two days shot extended inflammation. Wish rested another days. think target treat prevent streptococcus infections. spread like wild fire close living quarters think American Indian stupid racist history, that's like use it. know use American Indian accepted research term. Excellent response young people general bothered get it. TV feeds focus mostly athletes, fake crowd noise could handle rest

Watched NBA bubble last summer, ok Annnnnd they'll still vote person.  side effects stronger young people due ""active"" immune systems? China's going host winter Olympics, nobody cares about. live town evidence population density material impact COVID spread? Rural regions US far highest COVID density. Realize behavioral differences drive this, given spread occurs small group environments unclear rural regions somehow ""protected"". 

Rural regions neighborhood get togethers, family get togethers, go grocery store / Walmart, even restaurant two main part town even far away. exactly lax, really strongly prefer recommendations mandates apparent belief asking nicely effective telling/forcing. (Our mask mandate ended wanted give people ‚Äúa sense agency‚Äù)

A generous interpretation faith people/think it‚Äôs way avoid fights protests; cynical interpretation it‚Äôs cheaper put burden individuals (staff businesses schools) bother enforcing dealing potential lawsuits. also seem weirdly convinced, day, masks don‚Äôt much, still put much bigger emphasis hand hygiene telling people stay home sick.

Edit add: closer Sweden Canadian provinces makes sense? got luckier Sweden (we also better extent w/our long term care homes) Google EUA click fda link. It‚Äôs hard.

I have. page say seem think does. pandemics history ended, without vaccines administered. post replying mentioned ""Baltimore still mask restrictions"" that's necessary thing county handful cases per day.

Maybe lock things Olympics going on? idea. guess. Like making safer athletes? compassion. understanding full picture. already granted government powers; it‚Äôs matter exercising power operate vacuum. allow government declare war invade nations tenuous justifications. uproar that? end day rely regulation accountability, would come --as have-- vaccine development. problem selective public, leaders vote power, apply regulation bring accountability. mean, technically correct. Native person, also prefer ‚ÄúNative American‚Äù. However, accepted term research data collection still ‚ÄúAmerican Indian/Alaskan Native‚Äù incorrect.  failing account fact many unvaccinated Californians live remote parts state. Places far, FAR remote anywhere UK terms population density. California (very) roughly half population twice size UK terms area.

In Californian cities similar density UK, vaccination rates already good better UK given everyone 12+ eligible months everyone got full doses. Makes way less likely older members family get covid grandkids. It‚Äôs lockdown don‚Äôt end pandemic never problem argument vaccinated people make terrible hosts virus. 

There reservoir unvaccinated hosts, &lt;12yr olds vaxx hesitant. virus replicates reservoir gains opportunity mutation. long ongoing mutation exposure pool hosts, case vaccinated people, potential breakthrough.

This exactly bat coronavirus breaking passing humans. swine flu, etc. official attendance Super Bowl LV 25,000 fans view Super Bowl in-person 7,500 vaccinated healthcare workers

So, roughly 35% so. quick Google shows 48.7% US vaccinated, number keeps slowly rising.  Tribalism ALWAYS wins... thats needed context conversation though... That's pandemics end: once, person person. don‚Äôt enough information predict individual outcomes virus around 19 months, certainly enough information vaccine around 7 months know individual outcomes be?

No?... vaccine also guarantee specific individual outcomes. help make chances better. 

Science magic. discover something (like SARS-Cov2).. invent something (like vaccine).. neither one things somehow instantly 100% perfect. learn along way. That's science works. 

The reason confidence vaccines work combination of:

* 100+ years vaccine history examples (and knowledge draw on). 

* mRNA vaccines (specifically).. invented decades ago (first used therapeutic trials 1989).. overnight thing. 

* also know tricking body building neutral ""spike proteins"" safe (molecularly speaking) neutral spike-proteins ""active virus"" (your immune system identify get rid them.. fight process). 

Are things ""perfect"" ?.. course (probably never be). they're still improvement/help compared them. Honestly, damn long, I'll take everything. It‚Äôs funny always complain college grads ‚Äúelitist‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt understand problems‚Äù yet God-Emperor went UPenn, elitist elite schools  certainly looking it. trials underway three-dose regimen prepare possibility. current vaccines still highly effective. changes, pivot. luck

We don‚Äôt *have* leave luck. play Russian roulette ‚Äúeverything life risk‚Äù? It‚Äôs another drop river, all. studies UK show higher well. hard know exactly ""correct"". point known efficiency rate dropped protection severe disease still 90's good.   not. range ""what ifs"" large literally anything could happen. could mutate way might end fizziling become footnote textbooks. could also become something unexpectedly horrible. Virology roll dice entails means best always open mind, even outcome want. absurd. Bans keeping anything except tourism dollars long-distance couples/family expense worsening climate, making thousands species extinct, destroying entire eco-systems millions preventable deaths. Failing species means grown changed much needed, worse yesterday ""it's fine"" much better today. lead paragraphs:

the delta becoming predominant strain, I'd concerned that.  Here's light reading effects asymptomatic mild/moderate cases. seems there's lot we're still discovering effects Covid-19 duration. Asymptomatic equal absence ill effects.

‚ÄúThe researchers found elevations C5b9 pediatric patients severe COVID-19 MIS-C, surprise, also found C5b9 elevated patients minimal asymptomatic disease. 22 patients complete data available, 19 (86%) met criteria TMA [thrombotic microangiopathy]. Additionally, sC5b9 levels elevated patients meet criteria TMA. Although children COVID-19 severe disease, study shows may effects SARS-CoV-2 worthy retrospectively investigated patients confirmed diagnosis COVID-19 show symptoms. Among 139 patients COVID-19 hospitalized Yeungnam University Hopistal Daegu, South Korea, 10 (7.2%) asymptomatic. chest CT radiographic findings analyzed. Results: results, patients (100%) ground-glass opacity (GGO) chest CT. Further, GGO lesions predominantly distributed peripherally posteriorly patients. 9 (90%) patients, GGO lesions combined reticular study (including control group n~5000) may interesting read. Mild-moderate acute stage. 15% reported moderate severe symptoms months post infection.

Comparing seropositive vs seronegative participants, 26% vs 9% reported least 1 moderate severe symptom lasting least 2 months (RR, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.2-3.8]) 15% vs 3% reported least 1 moderate severe symptom lasting least 8 months (RR, 4.4 [95% CI, 2.9-6.7]) (Table). common moderate severe symptoms lasting least 2 months seropositive group anosmia, fatigue, ageusia, fun off-topic bc people who've hospitalized Covid-19 (versus studies they've admitted reasons happened Covid-19), here's neat table literature vaccinated person exposing vaccine virus virus can't mutate response vaccine.

This sounds hell lot like circular logic. greater % population vaccinated, selection pressure virus mutate towards population break through.

Viruses constantly mutating. Evolution selects fit mutations ie higher transmission available hosts. Expanding ‚Äúavailable hosts‚Äù also include vaccinated always evolutionary pressure. batch Fool's &amp; fool gets caught short common fuckn sense. choice believe republican liars &amp; chioce risk death.
So oh well them. truly think protected class people politicians they've lost understanding close edge lot problems are, especially covid-era, problems get tipped way edge forced respond instead proactive.  


better keep kicking hope sap fix it.  way 20 million kids get infected. worrying worry. go states large dense cities fared worse initially move real third world country learn stop saying stupid stuff like this. Chin strap people may also vaccinated people keeping mask handy anyplace becomes crowded come upon place still requires them. often mine around chin public handful stores area still ask worn. also like wasn‚Äôt sick 18 months slip I‚Äôm crowd heavy breathers.    Unpopular opinion CDC held bit dropping indoor mask mandate. Makes wonder much knew delta making decision. think Canadians could travel UK back? problem really reach 100% developed countries. poorer countries reach 50, 60, 80%. Globally that's what's important. need herd immunity stop spread people either get vaccinated, vaccines work.  Agreed‚Ä¶ luckily us live groceries delivered. full face respirator n99 filters use painting really dusty projects, worth unless travel. Got fully vaccinated Chinese vaccine, feels good safe. Efficacy lower vaccines need anything receive. vaccines approved safe! Yes,.. reinforcing exact point I'm making. 

We yet understand thing deeply accurately enough able predict individual outcomes. 

So saying ""it kills 1%"" (or whatever justification).. jus nonsense downplaying minimizing.

June dominant strain Nevada already Delta variant... get much panic infections. older people Netherlands fully vaccinated people get infected younger people. probably see England, lot people infected, people hospital. pressure hospitals main problem virus. people getting infected, happens every flu virus. Since non-sterilizing vaccines, can't virus also mutate vaccinated people? ‚ÄúAnother month 2‚Äù 

Yeah, never heard one /s can't possibly obtuse. Covid seems aggressive. lots variants died off, we‚Äôve worse. thing won‚Äôt quit. offers chance incubate new variants among kids. Delta also 1/1000 chance causing MIS-C among children. That's small percentage adds nationwide consider right kids 12 vaccinated.

If 20 million kids get infected Delta (inevitable without vaccine approvals), possible 20k contract disease high chance death serious damage rest life.

In grand scheme things number going bring walls crumbling many parents want roll dice one.  folks (and should) still get vaccinated. Unfortunately, vaccines (for diseases vaccinate against) work *as well* immunocompromised, protection certainly better none. rare vaccine provide protection someone (and again, does, likely protected sorts diseases vaccinate against).

Pretty much contraindication vaccines allergies ingredients themselves, pretty much everyone who's allergic one type get another. says need lock again? South
Or East Asia maybe Sydney Australia? spam sub repeated comment. order save survivable mild affliction vast majority people.

Here's problem though:.... Generalized statistics map accurately individual outcomes. 

I 46yrs old last year March (so I'm old enough high risk group). also 0 medical history complications kind. Yet caught Covid19,.. spent total 38 days Hospital (16 days ICU Ventilator nearly died). 

How come ""mild easily survivable"" ?... logic,. statistics say happened happened !.. wouldn‚Äôt gone either. understand frustration, wear mask COVID-19 barely wore it,, get vaccinated, suddenly going wear mask properly now. US

The US testing genetic sequences anywhere near much place like UK. fact, US mostly seen flying blind comes variants monitors viral evolution little.

For know, deadly variants rising US get replaced like variants have. monitoring poor, US can‚Äôt dismiss possibility. Question, why, *by unholy left nut Satan himself,* Olympics even continuing?! It‚Äôs body. Kids allowed make decisions health, regardless parents think. got quickly. Blame doesn‚Äôt prevent it.  worry clusters unvaccinated people ocean parts world. Covid never go away, get that, wonder pandemic end. Personally, living life normally ever since fully vaccinated.  idiots aren‚Äôt vaccinated* FTFY Technically, always achieve distribution allowed continually subdivide. valid questions, completely agree. seen life people don‚Äôt really choose believe, learn parents, friends peers. Trump shown it‚Äôs possible take bunch fairly sane people turn mentalists (see /r/QAnonCasualties evidence), point journey started long Trump came scene. 

I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre blameless, blaming really meaningless. Lmao going running torch abandoned desolate streets ? would funny one gets lost way. cancel thing already dunno. saw quickly spread here. Middle/rural America thought safe far away first Seattle NYC outbreaks. month two later weren‚Äôt. don‚Äôt need international airport town covid get there. wonder going put cardboard cutouts stands? 

Couple weeks ago channel surfing hotel room came across WWE wrestling. Instead cardboard cutouts, seat vertical mounted monitor looked like live streaming people home ""audience"" via webcam. whole bunch giant heads seconds lag reacting anything happening ring. see Lot people freaking UK cases, 7 day average Nov 2020, hospitalizations? 77% compared period, really matters, deaths also 95% comparison.

Vaccines work people covid isnt threat kids teens despite idiots media want fearmonger. unfortunately many California's vaccine-hesitant black &amp; brown communities holding shots. exact sub-populations higher risk complications &amp; hospitalizations. know make sense, there's lot political, racial, historic social &amp; cultural factors play that's influencing decisions.  Really nothing it. is.  Adding jmnugent's point, vaccine 100%, common vaccines &lt;90% effectiveness. Polio vaccines sit right 90% efficacy, DTaP vaccines range 80-90% efficacy. Mumps 88%. (All per CDC.) 


Why vaccines still work? herd immunity. need super-high effectiveness rate everyone around also vaccinated.  state pretty split even politically. area live within state conservative.  
Not myself. 
Night mares, vivid dreams, sever fatigue. breathless. 

I get up, get about, find breathless. Pressure chest. 
In 56 years, never felt anything like this? Think I'm going good, bam, ass lol 

I'll make it, slow recovery time. 
I've copd, disabled, chronic nerve damage, #Crps, tough ole birdüëå still, I'm concerned. cant get peace. ? 

I'm glad I'm vaccinated, likely would hospital pfizer. 
I've inhaler, nebulizer. üëå Spiriva. 

Thank asking me, kind you

I pray good health. 

Eta, jmo, think even vaccinated, us still test, positive, gut experience break infection different? individual? immune system also mutates configure fight mutations. see big jump escapes immunity people dick around lab again. meant say ""the people age brackets highest risk hospitalization already heavily vaccinated.""  Considering simple probability, looking much world unvaccinated‚Ä¶a variant vaccine resistant almost guaranteed come country much bigger population lower vaccination rates US. reminds guy twitter telling people tha people England chance MUST vaccinated.

Oh wrong Like said find one shares beliefs. don‚Äôt follow rules doesn‚Äôt mean do. question conservativism state.

Source: live AR. know changed, friend went back China, quarantine hotel stay vents blocked prevent transmission vents. would wear mask home amongst family?  know crazy, also active, good gaslighting people. help elected officials running local office. Look Table 4 (page 14) link: deaths people vaccinated, including close half given 2 doses. UK, vaccinated mostly old, unvaccinated mostly young.

CDC's published risk metrics, relative 18-29 year olds:

50-64 year olds 35x likely die COVID 18-29 year olds
85+ year old 610x likely die COVID 18-29 year olds.

the vaccine cutting risk factor 8x sounds like win.


Source: think need postpone honestly surprising. already companies planning package booster flu vaccine.  Lying numbers*

FTFY. Let‚Äôs hope! mean probably COVID looks like got Feb 2020 wasn‚Äôt position confirm. 

My position definitely isn‚Äôt COVID nbd, people, even young otherwise healthy people, really tough time it. Fortunately it‚Äôs pretty low proportion demo. true, 80 percent world ""unvaccinated cluster"" point. people likely heavily vaccinated. 

Not sure typo.

The vast majority COVID-19 hospitalizations patients *unvaccinated fully Two doses BNT162b2 highly effective across age groups (‚â•16 years, including older adults aged ‚â•85 years) preventing symptomatic asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections COVID-19-related hospitalisations, severe disease, death, including caused B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. multistate network U.S. hospitals January‚ÄìMarch 2021, receipt Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna COVID-19 vaccines 94% effective COVID-19 hospitalization among fully vaccinated adults 64% effective among partially vaccinated adults aged ‚â•65 Cleveland Clinic Tuesday released study showing 99.75% patients hospitalized COVID-19 Jan. 1 April 13 fully vaccinated, according data provided Axios. hate parent child 12 right now. target anti-vaxxers. targets anyone immunity already. gain immunity getting vaccinated.

If equating caring anti-vaxxers genocide, *probably* need re-examine priorities. I'll honest, parent 2 children 12 wife vaccinated, honestly afraid covid relates kids delta variant. 

Other countries (India specifically) seen tremendous surge due Delta (it originated makes sense) hard impossible really even get data covid deaths related children appear happen.

The real risk unvaccinated older age kids transmitters virus, honest states (i want argument immunocompromised, people risk prior Covid), everyone wants vaccine walk get vaccine, get sick really now.

The real risk statistically kids different 100s things daily basis (more kids died drowning swimming pools Covid). would trust science, data statistics, want risk averse based %s Covid, also risk averse lot things kids well. headline Delta, vaccines. Vaccines work, vaccinated, unvaxed rough ride variant. Yeah, thought Governor state would revise guidelines elementary students wear masks, middle high school choose getting vaccinated wearing one certain percentage vaccinated. still couple weeks go. think Governors, mine included want leave School Board, local politics truly fucked live.  big nothing burger. male died unvaccinated, died 86 year old. Vaccine manufacturer says vaccine necessary

Edit: trying make joke, understand reasoning Delta booster shots sub many different competing interests many puppetmasters trying steer public perception consistent narrative. probably could reposted thing hour later fine Unfortunately, they're going see way. They'll get sick course, since local 5-bed community hospital can't handle bad covid cases, those'll get shipped nearest (azure) city. ICUs fill it'll news, (assuming believe covid real) they'll say other, ""Man, covid really hitting city-dwellers' butts really hard, haha! *So* glad live rural part state - ain't got covid here!"", realizing caring significant percentage cases actually came area.

I really think need change local messaging ""Hospitals local-city starting fill almost cases unvaccinated people"" ""Hospitals local-city starting fill almost cases unvaccinated people, 75% people hospitalized transferred [these rural areas]"". would hopefully make people conscious that, yes, covid actually *is* devastating *your* community, local (azure) city love hate.  Arkansas 3rd last vax 1st cases, might onto something. They're Japanese popular destination tourism  thought Japan low supply they're still currently low vaccination rate...hence state emergency right now. That's good indeed. Unfortunately Indo, recently 26 health worker died, atleast 10 fully vaccinated, sinovac. Damn really need mRna vacs. Offers protection. full protection infection. Efficacy 80% (or 65% per Israel) delta. 

‚ÄúBut death case link broken‚Äù yes likely. However doesn‚Äôt rule long term effects mild/moderate symptoms. you‚Äôre honestly interested links could share. everyone knows crazy. Oh I'm allergic penicillin. Guess means can't enlist, right? fuck Breakthrough cases overly concerning. vaccines 90+ percent effective meaning 10 percent still get sick. They‚Äôre extremely less likely die even get sick.

The situation needs monitored there‚Äôs cause panic. two antibody tests. One measures antibodies created response live virus measures antibodies spike protein. got vaccinated without covid, latter. prob took wrong test. ‚Äúyou people‚Äù ? people would be? background ‚Äúreal scientist‚Äù? aim never Covid 0

It‚Äôs realistic ever expect that

Heck vaccinated people catch it, expect stay locked forever? blame wanting normal life again? 

At times feels people don‚Äôt want get back normal keep making excuses prevent getting really fringe, minority cases here.

Those immuno-suppressors isolate long-term, I'm afraid. Press conference new restrictions tomorrow. I‚Äôm curious decide.  Oh *is* strange. Thanks clarification! think really good idea yet. 
People tend hang people similar themselves. 

In lot places, unvaccinated groups (young people, conservative people) create small environment level immunity lower, COVID spread easily. 

I think answer know herd immunity arrives. 
An encouraging piece low highly vaccinated age groups UK seeing growth cases. likely function herds low interaction highly infected groups, within heard, COVID cannot sustainably spread members heard. vaccines aren‚Äôt available elementary kids til then, there‚Äôs good chance local school district ( San Francisco) remote start next year too. Wow.   offense, trials conducted either manufacturer directly funded way, want product part success story. there's cure outside pharma industry, slightest bit bring public. would want vaccine end fight pandemic talk Delta booster? Yeah, think he‚Äôs one denial NEET soon won‚Äôt cool anymore. right, less guaranteed small uptick hospitalization due surge. @YorickB Twitter calculated today‚Äôs positive tests probably lead 20 hospitalizations. vast majority breakthrough cases mild asymptomatic, could thousands upon thousands people US contracted Delta, absolutley ZERO symptoms went life knowing. ? That's fully vaxxed people, strange, could due getting infected less, symptoms variants lingering rankings.

The unvaccinated, majority Delta cases seen loss smell drop #9. health gambling with, rather they're jeopardizing health others can't vaccinated vaccinations effective. dumb, wanna know new variants emerge? Goddamn cat gives two these. I'm trying stay consistent Zyrtec Fear mongering genocide choose kill themselves? literally, LITERALLY, saying entire fucking time. sort sign would expect? spoon stuck NIS mixed record reporting developments North Korea, 

No kidding!! Yes, saw that. That's good, assuming receptor can't independently entered. state like highly populated states mandate people wear masks, reduced unvaccinated only. Currently state mandate ends end month students schools need wear masks since 12 can't vaccinated, 12-17 year olds available long. live conservative area state too, 2 days ago first time went store see majority still wearing masks.  would gone asked get tested leaving trip. really hang around anyone vaxxed unless someone's kid. Everyone's risk tolerance different. feel like parent immune compromised kid shouldn‚Äôt sent kid first place. knew getting into.  Oh, do. actually upvoted little bit matter murky right WORST level guidance almost science go regards vaccinated people dealing unvaccinated people. that, CDC literally diametrically opposed comes vaccinated mask guidance. - take upvote show solidarity thoroughly fucking confused, frustrated TIRED. problem accepting government money farmers, he?  Though COVID seems higher incidence longer-term effects despite mild symptoms allergies. vascular disease still hurting organs, though good info common is. information sequencing rates/policies various states country whole? even government policy, individual labs decide whether sequence not? vaccines US 100% effective (but close) working well. point covid deaths 99% unvaccinated people. Yesterday, covid deaths Maryland 100% unvaccinated people. Oh agree. science simple: vaccine, you‚Äôre probably likely win lottery die Covid, rare occasion get sick indistinguishable cold. vaccinated, things currently stand, nothing worry about, actively chose get vaccine deserve sympathy get cough die idiots chose it.  doesnt, that's reference show much hospitalization risk scales age. since older people heavily vaccinated cases much younger now, overall hospitalization rate much lower. definitely understand that. Anti Unvaccinated get sympathy everyone different areas, possibly carrying novel strains illness, live close together 60 person bays months. basically immune system booster shot. point young people *now* means older people *later*.

Think virus fluid, vaccines precautions seal. matter tight seal is, fluid reaches certain pressure, burst.

So, allow cases rise exponentially among certain demographics, inevitably reach critical mass even vaccinated people exposed virus often, higher viral loads, it‚Äôs enough cause breakthrough infection.

Oh, bonus, process also veritable breeding programme vaccine-resistant variants.

Example: Monkeys cannot get smallpox. Normally. However, literally douse monkeys variola virus, eventually *do* get smallpox, die. experiment done (iirc) early 2000s, demonstrate animal model smallpox could viable. experiments stopped might led new variant smallpox non-human reservoir species, would nigh impossible eradicate ever escape.  Tell 14 year old desperately wants vaccine cannot due idiot parents.

Or transplant recipient taking immuno-suppressors live cannot get vaccine.

Fuck man. Life black white. No. not. I'm going change mind. vaxx numbers good, would hope minimal uptick hospitalizations people vaxxed.  Well educated wealthy likely fall vaccines harmful/it‚Äôs flu someone high school diploma. 

There least 2 doctors Tulsa area discourage masking. One two also covid vaccines. 

People love hear anything reinforces bad habits. plenty add social media nonsense. miss first part? Nerds, üëèüèºNerds, üëèüèºNerdsüëèüèº, Nerdsüëèüèº Well, presence control group kids ill something covid could include common colds, also RSV flu, group substantially lower. viral infection lingering symptoms, covid pretty consistently showed somewhat higher rate respiratory infections. illnesses 1 50 people showing symptoms 8 weeks.

It's cause panic, seem vast majority people tracked long periods return baseline, even among kids (who low rates hospitalization death) symptoms linger weeks months. Again, cause panic, definitely evidence favor vaccinating kids get good data safety/efficacy vaccines. Agreed, would unsurprised already mutation Delta variant spreading Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma (or states outbreaks) today I‚Äôm vaccine, last thing want give government power show home force medical treatment don‚Äôt want. vaccine better vaccine, good work told mom late January 2020 airborne, I‚Äôm sure thought crazy.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  they're outlier compared data coming countries.  Actually never thought this, it‚Äôs quite good idea. Much ethically less controversial mandatory vaccinations. resolve easily making legal medical insurance providers deny health claims related Covid covid vaccine.

If vaccine, get covid, responsible medical bills - us. 

This win/win/win. 

The insurance industry wins want profitable. fight back.

We win forces unvaccinated face serious repercussions decision accept personal responsibility ignorance.

We ALSO win medical healthcare premiums lowered. Tbh it‚Äôs really soon. matter when. specifically voted vaccine makers accountability  prisoners ok guards vulnerable. Seems like isn‚Äôt problem. Depends person tribe. everyone shares uniform view it. hilarious! Thanks good laugh Localized lockdowns US would disaster. would need implemented low vaccinated areas, generally rural south. Good luck getting people lockdown kind. guess I've two months now. you‚Äôre presented facts

What facts? said ""google it, go fda.gov"". Find specific language site explains extra safety considerations EUA full approval. Copy paste exact words exact link. Humor me. Treat though I'm complete imbecile. 

""Google it"" evidence. American Indians India sometimes find term confusing.  sister tested positive Covid. Pfiezer vaccine. live together, Johnson Johnson. concerned now.  Population young, architecture tends ventilated?    one tribes asked help 2020, sent body bags. That's joke.

Native Americans autonomy US government realized quickly without many resources. caused double proactive vaccine related information drives. Tribes also trying preserve cultures, loss elderly tribes intolerable there's strong desire protect them. Luckily, government changing hands seems also led increased interest getting vaccines quickly, increased representation Native Americans federal level also helped build trust. Yeah. Rabies essentially 100% fatal. people survived extreme exceptions, life long issues overcome. horrible horrible way go well.    Discouraging masking among one high risk groups. Jesus.... 38? laugh seeing called highest anything Depending area places giving vaccines don‚Äôt check ID all. done checking IDs might prevent undocumented immigrants getting vaccine would hurt herd immunity endanger rest community one benefit people 18 could also go lie age get Covid shot without parental consent. many people really tell difference 16 year old 18 year old anyway? won‚Äôt pregnant anymore time Australia gets around actually vaccinating Answer: played Euro 2020 match last week baku azerbaijan.  invaded neighbors less year ago.  

Now Qatar guess. doesn't. proven false. far, reports rare, reported already still long covid. Completely agree. Cases irrelevant now, it‚Äôs hospitalizations deaths, least western-heavily-vaccinated world slogan Covid-19 today be: now. Give date exact number cases think US day make ‚Äúspike‚Äù day comes see right transmissible, worse symptoms deadlier. Even asking question nowadays reveals person's naivete. Like, even realm possible. WWII happened today, entire globe would melt down. Find pop clinic Wait what???? take come from? get rid Olympics happen time people might get infected even though almost athletes personnel vaccinated? ended permanently??? 

Can anyone upvoted explain makes even lick sense? Obviously want broadcast money, that‚Äôs given, sunk cost fallacy, justify abolition??? 2nd dose 12th morning, would ok work day? Also friend get together 13th wondering need avoid alcohol? also pollutes statistics. ill ones among vaccinated individuals going get tested, numbers skewed make look like vaccines less effective Fucking duh. people make money ones pushing boosters atm keep mind, unlike original shots, people huge profit motive comes boosters. wait data 100% survival rate

You baselessly claim that. that's anywhere near true. nearly 2% even higher earlier pandemic treatments like monoclonal antibodies developed. 

All anyone asked wear god damn mask. basically whole thing. go costco? Wear mask. know contagious first get it, could walk around week spreading know stay home. everyone wore masks would've basically halted virus. special, right? know better - somehow tune body know moment infectious? Right?

It's right wear mask, generally speaking. But...and here's whole thing folks can't seem get thick skulls...it's right infect deadly virus. risky behavior problem. reason banned smoking restaurants still legal smoke general.

Once ""freedom"" shitting freedoms crossed line. course refuse acknowledge I'm saying here. know best, special. NBC would anywhere world far behind rest world? outbreak going year half already, would wrecking Africa? know kind surprising me. Japan big rich country, kind assumed already ability produce vaccines googling bit found least. seems working producing corona vaccines domestically now, guess ready yet. anyone jumps conclusions: article collection interviews best immunologists, agree COULD done, uncommon mix different brands vaccines, done influenza diseases mixing vaccines induces stronger antibodies reaction. So, scientifically speaking, WOULD feasible.

Now, decided third shot Pfizer sure, one approved vaccines Chile; they're still waiting research know combination would better third shot applied (the government bought whole bunch extra Pfizer Sinovac doses preparation this). less them. takes mutation break immunity could spread unvaccinated child.... Honestly that'd kind image would forever represent pandemic. Like Andrea Bocelli singing opera front completely empty Italian landmarks.  virtually guaranteed hospitalized, yet alone die. absolutely infuriating parents vaccinated polio smallpox themselves! Ooh, idiots think know better - could shred pieces putting people's grandchildren danger! Yes, amount spread opportunity mutate log scales lower peak case times. 
I want everyone vaccinated, suddenly reason freak out. Yup, need literally go around saying live want vaccine when. van show house time nurse vaccine. many people wouldn‚Äôt mind taking can‚Äôt afford take work, transportation site, whatever may be, there‚Äôs groups would absolutely love service Makes really wonder many cases colds caused coronaviruses transmit via large crowds. 

Probably most. 

Imagine could track many colds people get attending football game.  I'm terrified we'll get variant particularly harmful 12 population. Especially one high r-naught number high fatality rate age group. easy prove, then.   would willing link study data children aspect? toddler I‚Äôve googling it‚Äôs pretty ominous I‚Äôve found since seems clump unvaccinated kids I‚Äôm struggling find data delta affects toddlers below.  wish way viruses visible color coded. 

Red SARS
Green Flu
Yellow Cold viruses
‚Ä¶.and on

We might run colors repulsed much world. Lots dodging weaving expect.

Great potential sci fi movie. America. WTF republicans allowed fuckery happen America gotta stop treasonous mfers &amp; soon. Eh? said -

*""Not enough people saying remembering this. people vaccinated refuse really mucking kids 12 people can't get vaccinated. woods!""* 

You replied -

*""Many people zero interactions kids 12 immune compromised people.""*

None refers vaccinated people without masks. even use word mask. feel like we're point movie ignore warnings shark open beach anyways. That's it. Yes (: American Indians seem skepticism/distrust government's role Black people?

Both groups absolutely countless instances mistreatment. would think skepticism may exist Native communities well, seems like much less thing? People need know covid avoid spreading it
 
In ideal world would stay home cold, many people luxury simply company work would pay places may even fire employee. children 12, kids anti-vax parents. get make choice. honestly know issue is. could understand covid running wild places, isn't. I‚Äôm thinking maybe it‚Äôs 28% people show hospital COVID symptoms test positive wind admitted. get vaccine? doesn‚Äôt prevent getting spreading it‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs point? Narrator's voice: ""They didn't."" company used AI technology design new class inhibitors targeting main protease enzyme Sars-CoV-2, essential replication coronavirus. firm work turning small molecule inhibitors pill treat Covid-19. hopes therapy also effective new mutations coronaviruses.

ü§ûü§û   Highly varying numbers different studies. Canada believe 88 percent symptomatic disease efficacy number. There‚Äôs really stable control group estimates best fuzzy worst useless. 

IMO moved goalposts hard realized vaccines would prevent infections, need go back originally viewed vaccines 2020 - preventing deaths. no-fan atmosphere include opening ceremony $1.4 billion National Stadium, traditionally watched event late. Cancel postpone it,‚Äù said Yukio Edano, head Constitutional Democratic Party Japan, largest opposition party Suga‚Äôs uptick infections also forced Tokyo city government pull Olympic torch relay capital streets, allowing run remote islands Tokyo coast. It‚Äôs unclear torch enter stadium opening ceremony.

It must strange athletes compete without spectators. Opening Ceremony weird without spectators. 99% deaths right unvaccinated people, number deaths greatly reduced vaccinated communities. Get vaccine; almost definitely fine. I'll worry scare tactics backed evidence. population consciously betting fare better without vaccination ~~will~~ **may** die due choice

FTFY  die gaan allemaal via Testen voor Toegang. Als wat jij zegt waar is, zou TvT meerderheid van de besmettingen voor hun rekening moeten nemen. 

Hier het laatste weekrapport van RIVM (6 juli): pagina 57 zie je dat de week van 28 juni t/m 4 juli er 643 via Tvt/Stichting Open Nederland positief zijn getest. 

via de GGD'en zijn er diezelfde periode 6971 positief getest. (zie tabel op pagina 37)

oftewel de discogangers nemen ongeveer 10 procent voor hun rekening.

ik waardeer je optimisme maar ik deel niet  point giving ones problem own. Cases still increasing UK's removing restrictions. Probably countless pandemics come gone word vaccine existed fact variants influenza virus either decimated eradicated masks, hand washing, distancing shows wrong are.  Imagine parent denies child mask vaccination, allows child uncontrolled environments (markets, indoor venues, concerts, choir practice, etc). child dies direct result parents actions.

Is crime?
If so, constitute manslaughter simple child abuse?
Should rest children parents care removed household?
Can children sue parents?  Unfortunately we've slept every single alarm past couple decades Plus, US auto immune disease primary treatment many auto immune diseases is, guessed ‚Äì immunosuppressive drugs. not? [Best article I've seen far kids symptomatic covid, 4.4% symptoms lasting least 4 weeks (0.9% kids symptomatic illness tested negative covid), 1.8% symptoms lasting least 8 weeks. common symptoms headache, sore throat, anosmia, fatigue.  would think risk actually higher like 50% vaccinated community 2% vaccinated community 50% vaccinated community, virus gets practice getting around vaccine more. Goddamn wish semblance global governance tackle issues like climate change too. problems local governance completely inadequate. It‚Äôll mandated receive ones get authorization changed emergency use regular use.

I‚Äôve seen different estimates Pfizer accomplish around August-October pointing her/his post said ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù. It‚Äôs possible immune compromised. Protection level long haul post viral issues?

Fully vaccinated here, fully masked, socially distancing least clear.

Vaccines work, get get shots required. *sonic fucking eyeroll* right? [A vaccine treatment.] Israel said something without context again! NY closed appropriate time. state (GA) closed early June 33% vaccinated lol talking people around world can't get vaccinated antivax people countries readily available? variants concern originated elsewhere - Brazil, UK, South Africa, India, Peru (?)...

Some variants currently spreading places highest vaccination rates like Israel.

It's facially absurd think domestic vaccination alone stop global variants, since that's *already* proven problematic countries highest vaccination rates. serious strategy variants would include increased vaccination *and* border control restrictions. one ""bad business,"" speak. previously infected (likely once) decent immunity going forward. way making suggestion. would argue media, thread government clearly suggesting vaccine silver bullet. point been, vaccine great purported media government‚Ä¶ get risk. 

I know incorrect trying illustrate idiocy premise everyone must get vaccinated immediately order save survivable mild affliction vast majority people. Yeah I'm vaccinated ones people still catching matter time virus mutates became resistant  original comment go research it‚Äôs close thought.

Cite source, then. I'd love read it. done risk/benefit analysis

Really? had, realize 'risk' getting vaccinated effectively *zero*. cost/benefit analysis numerator hundredths decimal points seems like no-brainer me. you‚Äôre wrong think position decision unintelligent.

You're fooling anyone. reason get vaccinated soon possible. cdc.gov: already COVID-19 recovered, still need get vaccinated COVID-19 vaccine? Yes, vaccinated regardless whether already COVID-19. That‚Äôs experts yet know long protected getting sick recovering COVID-19.

So ""we already COVID"" bad excuse. vaccines developed using science around vaccines experimental. **They went required stages clinical trials.** Extensive testing monitoring shown vaccines safe effective.

Emphasis mine. Meaning *there more* safety reviews testing protocols. They're done. They're finished. full approval vaccine cannot depend something *not* doing. vaccines received continue undergo intensive safety monitoring U.S. history.

And we've administered ~183,000,000 doses US alone. Still nothing note report. 183,000,000 large enough sample size you?


Whether get vaccinated you. Neither anyone else make anything. whatever want. pretending full approval vs EUA legitimate reason delay complete utter nonsense. ignorance best, propaganda worst. go another masked covid semester college idk I‚Äôm going fucking cope. Students robbed best times lives ridiculous amounts money subpar experience. colleges require vaccinations masks/limits idk happen.  Ah yes DeSantis personally overseeing data publishing daily. good news least. Luckily kids, Delta outcompetes Gamma. still get virus also still transmit others post vaccination. Delta increases odds.  Yeah I'm ok first two quite time. Thanks tho. government‚Ä¶‚Äùbusinesses make employees take vaccine fire taking it‚Äù

Also government‚Ä¶‚Äùwe gone take back‚Äù   Get tube socks bit upset people refuse vaccinations put rest us higher risk. Even aren‚Äôt vaccinated 35 healthy odds dying less struck lightning. virus particle smaller .3 microns, transmission almost always attaching droplets much larger. Hence 95%. trouble breathing n95 long, get 8211 3m mask exhalation valve put surgical mask it. Also wear goggles face shield. except googles. saying risk free, right I'd comfortable flight (assuming disruptors) crowded, maskless store. point I'm trying make. unsure whether dangerous gets people sick. Either possible better data. know appears make people sick. Seems unlikely they'd able win court requiring though understand wanting deal headache. Joining military right members freedom granted civilians.  Water wet, Charmin bears, yet folks still insist getting vaccinated \~just choice\~. Nike said it. agree decision rely data trials include information impact PASC. Yeah. Moderna. went phase1/2 trials combination 4 influenza strains along Covid RSV shot. remembering correctly. sure RSV. true yet. dangerous widespread variants originated countries US...  Honestly, think sense it‚Äôs over. We‚Äôll end expecting 50k deaths US every year, we‚Äôd expect flu. is, sense, travesty. could unfolded differently called better angels. Instead, resorted racism tribalism almost cost us country. USA island. big nation giant land borders. impossible end without vaccination. read kids 12 really spreading it. number like 69% efficacy delta variant. See Singapore study used Pfizer Moderna. referring man-made global warming, real threat real-world consequences. kids crippled away social interactions. main narrative I've seeing COVID 100% vaccinated number cases matter. country vaccinations (for example UK Israel) exponentially growing cases starting re-implement restrictions? ""It's zero COVID policy."" Nevermind difference wanting keep cases low level actually trying get COVID cases zero. Honest question since vaccinated people still get virus can‚Äôt mutate virus well? Nah, morbidly obese huge (agree ‚Äúobese‚Äù). I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11 150 pounds, definitely even overweight, though. height would need almost 300 pounds (basically double lol) classified ‚Äúmorbidly obese‚Äù. Long COVID generally used describe ongoing symptoms (e.g., brain fog, fatigue), long-term health issues (e.g., blood vessel damage, diabetes). know pediatrician said lost much business due covid kids aren‚Äôt getting flu colds. show covid symptoms takes two days test come back time recovered. disease mainly affects old people serious health problems fortunately. vaccine prevents teacher getting sick COVID extremely mild children. What‚Äôs logic closing schools and/or masking vaxing children?

There kind good reason close schools, especially given study mentioned above; spread rare schools taking precautions.  long distance relationship girl lived Arkansas nearly 2 years younger, believe you. many times. going even try compare. read carefully, followed imbedded link, said Moderna tweaked booster vaccine initial trials. link said formulation aimed South African variant. Delta that's taken over.

Looks like boosters may useful revitalizing immune system existing dose wanes, tweaking hit latest greatest variant takes way long. need South African capability (is Gamma?). need Delta capability. time get arms obsolete we'll two variants downstream.

I Moderna X2. Given choice I'd go J&amp; J booster get bit broader coverage. I‚Äôm saying hope dismissive patient many physicians patient searching answers sudden health problems pop up. know Covid affects gut, gut micro biome plays role many, systems within body. I‚Äôm saying perhaps research open mind called for. following precautions, like masks, precautions all?

The studies I've found say spread rare schools follow right stated well. drives insane New York unvaccinated required wear mask places, idiots still chin strap thing. infuriating, almost think show vaccinated sort flex. deadly Covid? COVID tests available RiteAid pittance, feel like friend invested finding they're gonna Typhoid Mary neighborhood. Yes. Thank you. feel I've done civic duty. message harmful. 

Vaccines science/medicine, magic. They're perfect, they're nothing they're binary. 

Vaccines awesome, acting like anything short 100% perfect coverage ""not vaccine"" inaccurate, dangerous message spread, honestly. 

See, *reasonable* people look occasional breakthrough infections among vaccinated (in presence lower transmission/illness) normal. That's something happens, vaccines perfect. Also, let's face it, us titers drawn know fuck actual immune status.

Then people look breakthrough infections among vaccinated sort 'gotcha' moment try discredit redefine vaccines. helpful. 

You enthusiastically endorse wholeheartedly support/encourage vaccination without falsely believing they're perfect. 69% effective vaccine, 48% vaccinated... quite lousy numbers US. obvious current situation vaccines alone cut it. also need suppressive measures want stop covid. way could that. None vaccines fully approved government. don‚Äôt want go path. It‚Äôs broad statement say unvaccinated people source issue, large portion population defeats virus without vaccine. 90% population ain‚Äôt driving shit. article doesn‚Äôt answer headline say avoids certain antibodies. 

It discuss vaccine effectiveness new study found Delta barely sensitive one dose vaccine, confirming previous research suggested variant partly evade immune system ‚Äî although lesser degree Beta, variant first identified South Africa.  understand could stubbornly short-sighted find public health assistance provided country's government ""unwelcome"". Yeah 5 month old pediatrician optimistic see vaccine age group approved end year. Shes 50/50 5-11 group getting approved. law passed in...patooey!...Tex-Ass(hole). Gollee sub many bootlickers. outdoors along crowd 100 people safe?

Listen medical professionals politicians. funny many people think morbid obesity risk factor problem ""super fat"" course fall category. Sadly, take much extra weight people think qualify morbidly obese. words, 3 10 Americans fucking clue anything.  I‚Äôm going go limb look statistics go ahead claim fine. Every single one them. yet, live hardly countryside (Kanagawa).

Although one friends Tokyo finally received letter, said gotta wait October least. true. parents inoculated Sinovac we're happy I'm hoping get chance jabbed mRNA booster need arises. fair said still suggest people wear masks near others enclosed spaces, they're removing legal requirement. should! good vaccine! best sister! :) means all. assuming vaccinated unvaccinated risk infected.

You 1000 vaccinated 1000 unvaccinated people. groups exposed unvaccinated people infected.

1000 infected unvaccinated 
310 infected vaccinated

The unvaccinated 2% risk hospitalization infected 
The vaccinated 0.5% risk hospitalization infected.

20 unvaccinated hospitalized. 
1 vaccinated hospitalized. think odds happening are? Give numbers  Honestly, ""40%"" seems *low* me.

The pandemic saw *massive* acceleration pre-existing wealth transfer poor rich.

People money made like bandits, *least* 40% Americans (and Canadians, Europeans, &amp;c) hole they'll never fully recover way lets reasonable retirement. amazing. Thank you. 3rd world countries one vaccinated. Like all. Covid running rampant also one testing. I‚Äôm going stress kids going summer camp ok? Got moderna, nothing sore arm. pretty bad allergies week 2nd shot, side effects weren‚Äôt worse whatever pollen (also anecdotal course). 3/10 probably still think it‚Äôs hoax never thing smh people make death bad thing covid awe.

I read story rapper go dialysis covid infectionwhen issue before, poor boy quadruple amputee covid infection , experience well .You fighters wish people understood killing one way many covid affect reports causing neurological damage may still know extent covid damage yet . 


I'm sorry suffering hope health improves. vaccine ever long term side effects? Usually there's side effects vaccine would first weeks most. boys, it! would likely evolve time become contagious less deadly.

Historically viruses evolved opposite direction first introduced humans: spread faster reproducing faster within human body, therefore severe. bit folk wisdom inanimate object trying figure coexist us simply misinformation.

1918 H1N1 obvious example, going ~0.5% CFR first wave 10-20% later. could call day sure long found somebody cover you. Anything three days needed note. half dozen different employers. people either quit worked anyway.  Maybe educate comment obviously don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre talking about. shit breaks heart. 600,000 dead Americans. 4,000,000 dead worldwide. ignorant assholes best keep pandemic going, even complain *inconvenient* wear mask. also don‚Äôt realise that‚Äôs one state. 

Notice wrote ""Its way late part Australia."" 

¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø spite Bolsonaro vaxxer denier. Surprised it‚Äôs low! expecting May 6 7 even! Children unlikely get severe covid get AZ want eligible, stop and? gotten vaccinated Even compliance 100%, better keep least encouraging though?

And article say dropping restrictions happen, point people fully vaccinated.  Texas 60,000,000 people it. fairness I‚Äôve heard ‚Äòwe must learn live virus‚Äô narrative since least April year. Isn‚Äôt thing? Echo enters chat lol oh irony. much easier us get vaccinated *your* country (and Europe) started exporting. love smug you‚Äôre still far far worse even vaccinated, obviously ignorant facts   didn‚Äôt reschedule 2024 that‚Äôs Paris holding games. Two olympics one year, delay Paris LA yeah still early confirm anything Oh man, Deepti Gurdasani. person likely created racist sock puppet account Twitter named RufusValhalla convinced CDC PHE ‚Äúhiding truth‚Äù COVID. would take little seriously letter actually endorsed Independent Sage Zero Covid focused scientists. Yes opening July 19 risk, also opening December 17 risk. literally easy go to, UK vaccinates hopefully children soon, better are. Vaccines remain best answer. Yeah state 70% total population fully vaccinated. 90% danger driven companies wanting make money, people‚Äôs lives damned. It‚Äôs pretty easy things like everyone pick groceries outside store, retailers sell less people don‚Äôt wander around aimlessly buying things don‚Äôt need. wait outside appointments. solved problems countries controlled pandemic. America didn‚Äôt care human life maintaining ‚Äúbusiness usual.‚Äù even sub man? maybe long term brain damage...  next 4 aren‚Äôt looking better though. Joe Biden needs check notes answer simple questions. Ummm much production think worldwide? made? *In countries exporting* Jesus even occur people who,act smug ‚Äògreat‚Äô they‚Äôre doing? . Yes, australia produce AZ that‚Äôs suitable many. Yup people testing symptoms get scary you‚Äôre fully vaccinated jurisdiction 75%+ vaccination rate pretty much especially consider considerable amount unvaccinated natural immunity  99.8% survival rate. Average age covid death 65, it‚Äôs pretty safe since beginning. cases start decreasd (due achieved immunity exposure variant + increase vaccinations) people ask keep lockdowns since ""covid zero sight"".

This happened like 3 times already. international viewers domestic viewers capped 10000 really planned Boris trying hardest give Covid Petri dish develop new variants in, might stuck Well essentially is.... really wildlife zoo? experimenting pidgeons squirrels? Yeah lol think everyone pretty protecting rejected vaccination actually. would done everyone would get vaccinated.  Good job people Brazil Bolsonaro. Thank healthcare workers! Well *before* point states Australia locked down. idiot government nsw norm comment actually might make op feel worse lol. ""Better nothing"" ""poor performance"" ""reasonably good"". know trying help yeah Although true, never 1% enough anyway. masks expire storage really like could maintain reserve size even used fifo buffer production. Maintaining emergency production capacity like prudent investment. may many problems country, there's one thing Chileans know vaccinating people, lol...

There still got vaccines, happens everywhere, believe numbers bad we're still living lot restrictions (lockdown, curfew, etc). Hopefully things get control announce liberties there's increase Delta cases! remind militant republican antivaxers military supports vaccinations?  Lucky you‚Äôre smart enough know this, none us figured out... I‚Äôm also guessing didn‚Äôt actually read story properly, also don‚Äôt realise that‚Äôs one state. Nah, act superior smug despite facts It‚Äôs I‚Äôm longer protecting antivaxers socially distancing wearing mask. ? can't see 2 dose comparison delta data. 2-shot figures Moderna AZ missing cases figures approach significance. 2-shot figure Pfizer included (87%) taken small sample.

The 2-shot Pfizer figure (vs Delta) [reported Israel significant ""n"" much higher. article says ‚Äúvaccine-related mRNA transferred infant,""

There studies that‚Äôs show antibodies mother pass infant breastmilk vaccination. (What want offer protection infant (how much unknown)). Vermonter, plain wrong. Look map state votes, even rural areas blue. Kind-of weird question, would people experience bad symptoms vaccine also get symptoms (along respiratory symptoms) actually get covid?  Two doses AZ proven quite effective delta variant keeping people hospital. Basically, get vaccinated, regardless vaccine get, provide significant protection.  One thing seen mentioned much realisitic would government actually maintain restrictions. Since Hancock incident I've seen big decrease adherance mask rules shops local area, already slowly decreasing least couple months that. trains, far lower before. 

And there's crowds related football drinking culture general. Far police could ever handle; seem inclined anyway. feel like dropping restrictions admitting going enforceable moving forwards. everyone knows cases don‚Äôt matter vaccinated people aren‚Äôt ending hospital. believe controlled affect year like flu. both? Mickey Mouse  Indonesia 5 percent fully vaccinated population. We'll learn go along.

As health workers got infected, Jakarta Globe reiterates June 17, 6,085 health workers health support personnel Kudus vaccinated first dose, 5,888 people received second dose.‚ÄúAlmost 100 percent health workers Kudus, amounting around 6,000 people, received first second doses vaccination,"" Badai said.""Of number, 308 health workers exposed around 5.1 percent total number health workers. recovered started working again,"" said.*

It may effective mRNA vaccines, agree good enough now. mRNA Boosters may needed future.  It‚Äôs great lied thousands front line workers got killed companies used bullshit rationale six feet rules. It‚Äôs like countries, say like South Korea Vietnam, took measures diminishingly deaths anything. really option offer people pyre.  Yes well it‚Äôs like aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated. start exporting make much easier usüëç 7 year old sister caught covid along parents. remember facetiming folks. Dad coughing, mom bedridden running around backyard playing ball alone, laughing. predict mask make brief return It‚Äôs crossed mind, trust Way studies UK, Canada, Singapore showing efficaciea 80-90% range. Sweet! Yeah, fuck noise. One childhood friends moved Arkansas highly critical covid first arrived n states basically called virus whole hype . dude worked hospital janitor felt like everything blown proportion talked well year really wonder he's thinking right ? yea feels like last bits covid burning out. bars / restaurants even require masks  Dont know youre getting downvoted. People really hearing want hear. 100% move life. true lot stats. northeasterner, would honestly ok peaceful secession point. south always drags us nearly every metric Yeap... hospitalized wasting millions many suffer heart disease issues later. 

Ohh... may die infect beautiful parents, grandparents, friends family. We're finally reaching herd stupidity. Interesting.  Whether boosters actually necessary (we know yet), CEO Moderna course say - would mean lot money company.

With said, binary question whether boosters needed not. protection likely decrease years antibodies fade virus mutates, booster shot likely increase protection. question much protection decrease much better protection would get booster, draw line start recommending boosters? do, also better access vaccines reservations social structure facilitates central leadership decision making. 

The narrative vaccine hesitancy driving vaccination rate declines really supported anything either. It‚Äôs possible vaccination rates peaking actually caused access, individual choice.  reason Vaccinated americans ""put up"" indoor mask mandates surge couple months, protect elderly, vaccinated unvaccinated.

I expect this, reason vaccinated first place.   already open pandemic started...  High rate infections.  Keep seeing posted lately... thought common knowledge. I've thinking year. Can't fix stupid.   COVID mutate vaccinated individuals? MD lot unvaccinated old people, relative UK.  really think that's works. No, aren't. hospitalization data showed partially fully vaccinated people number unvaccinated, terms death.

That expect vulnerable vaccinated almost entirely, least vulnerable aren't.

Covid riskier healthy old, vaccinated person, young unvaccinated doorknob licker. That's need vaccinate young. UK supply yet. US can't arsed take vaccine. talking morality? asked US Constitution. Americans really can't tell two things apart?  Hello :)
A group friends get together play soccer outdoors, 1 vaccinated. un-vaccinated person goes sporting events Southern California, would threat Delta Lambda variants going around? Would rest group worry bringing back home un-vaccinated younger children?    point though 70, 80 yr olds told fine vaccine worry. information important - need hear it. probably attend upcoming outdoor wedding mix vaccinated unvaccinated people?
I honestly know do. simply true, spent year country worst lockdowns restrictions Europe. We're back pre lockdown levels new cases. Vaccinated people getting sick, unvaccinated people getting sick, everyone getting it. Haha glad figured 24 hours. Yesterday made post torn. Great job detective! BC mask mandate tied Provincial State Emergency, lapsed June 30. still public health emergency, masks mandate fall there. Hence drop recommended People get vaccinated also getting virus. vaccinations prevent getting virus, help prevent symptoms virus. can't tell body decides stops making white blood cells antibodies. get next vaccine. 4 months 5 months 6 months. every years get vaccine like flu vaccine. every 4 6 months. vaccine card bullshit know body stops making antibodies. Native American? not, worked it? Native Americans gets decide American Indian acceptable, you. even obeying, intentionality shooting foot piss libs way. help run COVAX initiative.  can't allow vaccinated fans? Surely would allow audience safely?  No, I'm used neckbeards.  think that's thing. Well, mutation provides advantage vaccinated population would selected heavily vaccinated population.  much less likely spread others.

Why 99% angry Covid comments target vaccinated people? idiots get vaccine easily responsible outbreaks. vaccinated everything right, reduced risk huge factor, want live lives. Remember opening clubs festivals March 2020 like two weeks ago? Yea either. point still valid terms drop bucket ($250M total 167K Microsoft employees) income last year $44B, $143B. $143B revenue. That's insanely high profit margin still different. $143B profit would make Microsoft world's profitable company long stretch. Among things, hospitals patients compromised immune systems can‚Äôt get vaccine. So‚Ä¶ need keep going train thought see irony comment yet? ITT: woosh... Everyone seems get sick first anyway, go gas chamber second week usually fixes it. Yep I‚Äôm ashamed live one states lowest vaccination rate. say it‚Äôs surprise. Jesus Christ save guys don‚Äôt worry!! P.S. -Help me. America course do. I've never loss taste smell allergies.
Loss smell stuff nose different. Also unvaccinated walking variant factories endanger everyone, eventually may get variant vaccines can't stop symptoms? always chance catching transmitting vaccinated, reportedly takes chances serious covid symptoms close zero. That's makes gamechanger.  It‚Äôs racist, they‚Äôre talking quantity people. 

It‚Äôs sad , lot countries small fraction whole country vaccinated. arguing since day 1 need get vaccines countries.

According world 1% people low-income countries received least one crazy people carrying like that‚Äôs nothing concerned about. People get vaccinated also getting virus. vaccinations prevent getting virus, help prevent symptoms virus. I'm totally shocked!!! /s I'm sure makes sense treat booster new vaccine needs go full test cycle, particularly mRNA DNA vaccines: we're talking difference little single gene. know work, know they're safe, let rolled widely based best guess they'll increase immunity? Similar every year's influenza vaccine guess mutations going common. get fully vaccinated MRNA get infected variant month later, possible get variant would super-protected future variants anti-bodies may have? abundant science suggesting US vaccines hardly lost protection Delta, immunity lasts long we've studying it. 

Boosters may necessary future. yet. got vaccine protected. Well...yeah. Facts faith.  think he'd sang [song people would've listened entire area abysmal vaccination rate? Like life normal Bay Area many vaccinated. asked year ago point pandemic thought would vaccine efficacy article fatigue would told mind‚Ä¶.yet lol. Sunday School. It‚Äôs common Microsoft employees get given stock, I‚Äôm sure benefit well. three vaccines US proven effective Delta. need booster it. many times need repeated? Sad see this. remember India news months ago, right?  could get proof none symptoms long, pandemic‚Äôs book. Give information long vaccinated people!! country produce ourselves, Canada done great job acquiring vaccinating population.

Proportionally, Peru lost three times many people US - looks like smaller number US ten times bigger. Maybe mad idiots refuse get vaccinated, instead good people everything right want love laugh again. 

I got vaccine. wearing mask putting risk *way* less anyone unvaccinated. reason risk, me. Seems highly dependent individual. roommate shivering blankets 90 degree summer weather 2nd, went rock climbing mine. think clear. still exponential growth, naturally flattened. 

With vaccination there's lower available population virus infect since good amount evidence least mRNA ones block transmission. Beyond that, infected vaccinated seem good vectors spread get sick.

So curve changed, naturally flattened. can't completely get rid virus point, naturally flattening best do. infection fatality rate ~.15%. means actively infected Covid (which third population), tiny percent dies it. look tiny percent stratified age comorbidities, clear people serious risk virus elderly already way out. everyone wore masks would've basically halted virus.

4 months now. Things getting back slowly. fully expect Delta variant rage US fall

Delta variant today already dominant strain US. places surge already starting. Belgium 65% increase 7 days average 40% decline month.

The positivity ratio still low statistical relevant (yet).

Realise many cases gets discovered testing required traveling. Good news! see UK goes Covid isn‚Äôt cold. I‚Äôm sure got idea. Still congratulations. Many deny moment sedated intubated.

They likely accuse physicians ""in it"" trying kill experience.  Efficacy relative unvaccinated person. 

Not every unvaccinated person exposed gets infected; also, .04% risk number weird scientific. Risk infection depends exposure factors, single number like that. 

Here's say: (95% efficacy means 20 unvaccinated people would gotten infected, 1 vaccinated person will. 90% efficacy means 10 unvaccinated person would get infected, 1 will. J&amp;J, Delta variant, etc, like 4:1 even 3:1. 70% protection infection, 40% protection spreading infected, would make R0 multiplier 0.18. would need little R0 5.0 order spread fully vaccinated community case. 

If 60% reduction spread infected, R0 would need 8.3. 

Kinda gray area certainty, especially crowded areas think. True. overall national rate pulled states low levels vaccines. Even within states cities different areas even neighborhoods different rates. Dumb fucks French monitoring situation closely worldwide, tell France one cautious countries. may feel like however government's attitude since beginning pandemic deny anything serious happening. panic lockdown everything late avoid thousands deaths. open fast first good sign. Rinse &amp; repeat.

I realize may said many comparable countries, please trust say Macron's response unbelievably irresponsible (compared comparable democracies). They're submitting data go review streamline things. expect submit final update September ask approval. and....the 4th next major holiday. mean, guess could say life never 'normal' sense. used work small satellite office every day. 7-year lease last January voted renew we're permanently working home. larger office going hybrid office two days week (preferably Tuesday Wednesday) work wherever days. work situation never going back old normal, though think better.

This tidbit info blogged forwarded memed spoken lovingly disinformation sites, conservative pundits, endlessly, since beginning pandemic. reality -- NECESSARILY. say, maybe years/decades. especially necessarily something happens right away Covid, Covid disease large percentage transmissions occurring presymptomatic phase. Whether host ultimately dies stop virus transmitted large part symptoms even begin. Unfortunately seen happening, variants far seem somewhat dangerous, addition transmissible, original Covid. area abysmal 34% right now. Oof guess I'm okay keeping US/ Canada border closed little longer bigger chunk population gets doubly vaxxed. Testing low many people sick means demand low. It‚Äôs good thing stage; guys always try point conspiracy.


What, think states actively denying testing people want something? think vaccinated and/or healthy people get tested regularly hell it? We‚Äôre ‚Äúflying blind‚Äù sense. absolutely correct. 12 can't even vaccinated yet can't total population. Maybe mid race, would entertaining answer question supposed be, ‚Äúsomeone else‚Ä¶?‚Äù

I think you‚Äôre addicted pandemic. Yeah chemo unbelievably taxing body brings immune system makes much less effective Ah, know different designation. Thank info, good know! case vaccinated people give fuck people get vaccinated Glad hear good news heart! health experts expect double vaxed people put life hold 1.5 years stay lockdown protect people think covid fake.  slow steady process, something wonderful witness. regions little 65% adult population fully vaccinated, others around 89%, actually track new active cases going people get vaccinated. today, local authorities region announced 96% yesterday's new cases people vaccinated (still trying find % previous days/weeks). Right now, they're starting vaccination 17 years old Pfizer (until reach 12 years old weeks). 
The Delta variant arrived recently (there like 3 known, controlled cases), authorities already talking third shot (possibly Pfizer, since people received Sinovac), hopefully getting everyone reinforced immunization Delta runs rampant along country.

Still, preventive measures yet relaxed: masks still mandatory, must keep distance, still cities lockdown, etc.

Tomorrow authorities announce changes national Covid plan ""Paso Paso"" (""Step Step""), expected they'll grant liberties vaccinated people. changes supposed announced like last week so, delayed announcement make adjustments arrival Delta variant, shall see works out... know! feel bad girl. would pick picture?  people heavily invested emotionally thing continuing. honestly reminds GME thing. big deal happening (Covid obviously much bigger deal) it‚Äôs like gonna thing forever. panic especially vaccinated vaccine. although would probably better get booster another vaccine, protection Sinovac still *way* better nothing. main worry poor performance getting ill all, serious illness/hospitalization reasonably good. booster different type available -- 3 months previous shots could definitely get it. NY 55% vaccinated. zip code single positive covid case 5 weeks. vaccination rate area much higher. sad lot family's learn hard way pandemic come fall winter.  Yeah, past week Md, case numbers positivity stayed low hospitalizations going quickly. Hoping trend doesn‚Äôt continue. 75% adults least 1 dose.  AZ hesitancy Australia embarrassingly high even 60's. welcome news Indonesia though - single dose AZ highly effective Delta - better Pfizer.

[Covid-19 vaccine efficacy variants, 56 percent isn‚Äôt good. Upon digging discovered test used research recalled FDA longer considered FDA approved. percentage people vaccinated again? Prob 3 10 thought covid flu I‚Äôm 30 reaction second shot. I've country ten years, definitely norm 2000s. fully reopened?

Somewhere 1/1000 1/10,000 chances child outright dying flu. 

Basically would great data rate long covid compares childhood risks. basis crafting public policy response. sad u argue someone cares side effects vaccine talk people died taking vaccine vs people died Covid. like possible u worried side effects damn real covid Oh sounds like they‚Äôre fun. Eh people can't get vaccinated weak responses reasons. Stop moving goalposts lmao normally feed trolls imagine caring fake internet points much lie get them?

I nothing gain lying sister's BIL's health (which, stated above, great currently). rest family healthy though, thanks CDC &amp; guidelines, vaccinated. Unfortunately know families lucky, I'm sure none feel ""normal"" either.

I really care believe me. nice day though. Stay safe there. unclear yet vaccinated people fact source new variant. However, new Lambda variant Peru able pass neutralalizing antibodies, possibly making vaccinated people (and people natural antibodies) likely variant factories saw something c19, one 400x likely get myocarditis vaccine. Lol they? How‚Äôs concrete doin today? Enjoying breath fresh smog? It‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs hard speak own. listen experts see think makes sense. It‚Äôs something we‚Äôll wait see. agree you! Haha, I‚Äôve already ordered Amazon! Can‚Äôt wait arrive! You‚Äôve hyped much, I‚Äôm excited! XD Also starbucks study somewhere Asia. People second floor got infected. goes back well year. Hospitals usually full anyways. fine see said lot - eventually virus mutate evades vaccines. 

But proven unlikely happen due spike protein? spike protein changes point vaccines can't handle it, also increasingly likely spike protein changed much actually infectious easily transmissible. 

That's understanding whole time - since vaccines target spike protein, theory excellent protection virus mutations across board due reason. brother captain Navy. Captain Crunch now, also n95 (which kinda helpful bc size virus three times small openings fabric) isn‚Äôt going fit recycled air.

Also masks don‚Äôt cover eyes another vector.

So now, wait. I‚Äôve listened experts‚Äô takes it. repeating they‚Äôve said. makes sense mutation would likely occur virus faces new set defenses one originally faced ie. vaccine instead natural immune response posed human hosts. missing? evolution occur species outside pressure? uncle family live Oklahoma, Christian Fundamentalists, refusing vaccine. him, inner family, grandkids, there‚Äôs 11 them. feel really bad grandkids, somewhat bad kids (because they‚Äôre grown-ass adults, *were* kinda brainwashed subjected uncle‚Äôs sudden fundamentalist shift happened childhoods), uncle wife complete fucking idiots. never interact life, I‚Äôd happy man.

While possible vaccinated people catch mild case, important note mild case also accompanied lower viral titers. means less replication going on, thus lower levels mutations compared infection unvaccinated individual. Please, everyone, get vaccines! know someone get shot ended hospital. thought maybe family would start posting ""get shot,"" instead posting ""God good"" surviving. weird mindset. alive? Studies show may Covid durr durr  Doesn‚Äôt mutation occur inside host instead transferring another?   Thank much! Yeah, often gets overlooked discussions. I‚Äôm expecting next problematic variants tear densely packed slums developing world, antivaxxer pockets U.S.

That's true, smaller subset may think. lot folks able take traditional vaccine take one, example. brother chemo, yet got without issue.  yeah child actually pretty good too. I'm concerned is. concerns isnt inconvenience mask. concern cognitive development. critical reading/writing/social development stage life think seeing peoples faces important. Faces allow see words pronounced hear speak clearly. Faces allows understand show emotions. Ive believed long‚Ä¶.. mutation happens mistake occurs copying dna sequence? Vaccinated people reduced transmission rate compared unvaccinated people. transmission, chance mutation? masks required forever Singapore? mess...  source? Death usually lagging statistic.

At time infected mainly youth vaccinated completed vaccination. source show? Unfortunately, demographics matter. five clusters largely parts eight states, **starting east Georgia stretching west Texas north southern Missouri**. clusters also include **parts Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma Tennessee**, made mostly **smaller counties also cities Montgomery, Alabama; Shreveport, Louisiana; Amarillo, states currently seeing increases Covid-19 cases. Exponential growth defined 3 time points. Get smoothly shaven head! Yeah joined 97. dunno  Start Treks: Teh Nonks Genermation hope so. love observation. U.S. it‚Äôs sort dynamic U.K. perspective, person immunocompromised, variety factors resulted disregard safety people position. 

1. It‚Äôs unlikely reach herd immunity things like misinformation, individual risk factors, fear vaccine, possibly even apathy cases. One important thing noticed risk rather relative, thus safety, unlikely experience negative consequence due action likely go it. likely won‚Äôt die covid good immune system, young relatively good health. Although risk death never zero, people may bother get vaccine. also people don‚Äôt seem care others risk vaccinated could help reduce spread virus. 

2. desire normalcy. Many people simply bother taking precautions risk, nobody close is. However, also people care risk also people simply care could harm others. It‚Äôs apathy malice view point.

3. necessity/desire rejuvenate economy. people don‚Äôt spend money, economy falters. Poverty also dangerous people, pandemic lesser two evils. 

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs many reasons that‚Äôs I‚Äôve come far.

Here's light reading effects asymptomatic mild/moderate cases. seems there's lot we're still discovering effects Covid-19 duration. Asymptomatic equal absence ill effects.

‚ÄúThe researchers found elevations C5b9 pediatric patients severe COVID-19 MIS-C, surprise, also found C5b9 elevated patients minimal asymptomatic disease. 22 patients complete data available, 19 (86%) met criteria TMA [thrombotic microangiopathy].

I'd say like 1 year would threshold. Immunocompromised people always face risk every illness there. going restrict entire society forever inherent risk? place burden risk back individual certain point rather society whole. Tokyo SOE. Restaurants stay open till 8pm, alcohol served. Vaccine efficacy (Moderna Pfizer) standing 80% - meaning baseline risk infection unvaccinated reduced 80%. used 95%. Israel saying they‚Äôre seeing closer 65% efficacy. 

How variants get created? Genetic typos virus reproduced. reproduces virus - humans, manner cats, mink, possibly dogs lesser degree clear link.

So, takes make vaccine lag behind new variation pop development/testing past certain point.

Therefore, it‚Äôs *everybody‚Äôs* interests reduce spread less replication means less chance Greek letters thrown around.  won‚Äôt lol, train left station (AFAIK) laws requiring EUA-approved vaccine. someone inevitably challenge court, chances winning probably higher fully approved. lot people taking cautious approach here, want risk legal precedent like books. state really low vax rates could still affect you. example wave stresses hospitals causes reschedule non-essential procedures. Business restrictions might needed well, though lot states resistant shut downs knows they'll anything. That‚Äôs vaccinated individuals though. places like America virus still mutate unvaccinated people spread vaccinated people. small percent large enough number large number. 

A small percent vaccinated people get seriously ill, places lot vaccinated people. friend told virus couple weeks ago (after went Orlando daughter sports trip) symptoms. said daughter got them, son. like flu. also said doctor test covid ""because normal covid symptoms""

it's like talking wall people Sounds like folks need vaccine. can't, precedent says sure can. existing legal precedent covers fully approved, rest uncharted territory. Lots players want test inevitably challenged courts.   Plastic barriers probably still help bit. 

There case study restaurant someone sitting table infected someone really far away (a fan blowing direction). 

All along path, people facing sick person got infected, people sitting backs infected person didn't. Yes, virus could get around person's body infect them, didn't. barrier direct line helps. even get enough get infected, would still likely lower dose. Says person posted comment least three times one approved FDA (as Emergency Use Authorization) can't make mandatory.

They probably could. think concern someone challenge court win. might hard time requiring even *after* FDA approval. smart thing avoid legal minefield waiting, since approval coming soon anyway.

No matter imperfect vaccines are.. still better many people possible take opposed take them. 

When filter small amount people population actually legitimate reasons vaccinate.. percentage people outside -- get vaccinated. 

Of course none ""logical math"" (you can't force people). end-result pandemic really comes ""how many people cooperate voluntarily"".

I asked me, got vaccine access states. point getting jab fault. You‚Äôre kidding think Americans going backwards lockdowns, mask mandates, etc. one put anymore, vaccinated not. mean, entirely possible, leaving fact restrictions choice, restrictions scale long done much deadlier pandemics.

So, yes, cases increase (and think ""when"" ""if"") pressure reinstitute social distancing entertainment bans... always choose *not* close stuff try get it, like Michigan Alpha wave.

Throw fact restrictions essentially useless vaccinated people follow them, find much likely inevitable waves result reaction similar to, well, every pandemic 2020.

Florida 40% increase cases one week.

The curve doesn‚Äôt change.

Typically, get two colds school year, didn‚Äôt get single one year: (my fault letting friend‚Äôs five-year-old take sip water bottle disinfecting well enough.) kind forgot fucking miserable common cold is! week I‚Äôve thinking ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want again!‚Äù 

So, yeah. Masks hassle kids get argumentative them, another year reprieve respiratory illnesses sounds good me. Anti-vaxxers selfish, they're willing put risk harm people.  mask keep home much can. Society shouldn‚Äôt bend you. Let individuals assess risks let make decisions themselves. ask proof vaccination door Spread whom? Get vaccinated. Yeah going die... doubt shut back down. People tired rules. unvaccinated getting sick one willing go back. responding comment mirror UK, normative judgement ""who die"" (although think position low empathy).

California first dose penetration 80% 50-64, 90% 65+. seems high, UK 97% 65+ 95% 50-64. Hospitalizations inevitably 3X+ higher per capita UK based rate. *Much* better pre-vaccines, still quite UK. also don‚Äôt know long term effects vaccine either. noting 95.31% deaths 50 older 600,000 deaths 36,000 COVID alone (co-morbidities)‚Ä¶ perhaps little selective vaccine isn‚Äôt even FDA approved isn‚Äôt enough data it. fear mongering. DATA. parent, I'd want know risks, matter small. I‚Äôm pregnant due November. reading this, I‚Äôm really glad told laws (out state) can‚Äôt come visit baby least month. threw fit don‚Äôt care. (AFAIK) laws requiring EUA-approved vaccine.

[They're working know ok furious varient spreaders flat earthers. I‚Äôm vaccinated want normal life again, too. happen, goal needs high vaccine adoption rate dominant variant. then, still spreads mutates easily. also don‚Äôt much data long-term effects vaccinated people, lot existing data skewed testing longer pushed (which means lot undiagnosed cases). 

This doesn‚Äôt forever, doesn‚Äôt solved lockdown. need collect accurate data set actual goal. Changing approach every two months what‚Äôs fucking us right now. 

You can‚Äôt pretend COVID gone you‚Äôre tired taking precautions. It‚Äôs still there, doesn‚Äôt care think. isn‚Äôt game stop playing get bored. don‚Äôt think true state even ate height hospilizations . 57 percent fully vaccinated many unvaccinated previously infected don‚Äôt see happening. Yeah, that's important distinction. 

There news trial program certain flights LA NY UK fully vaccinated people quarantine, believe requires digital evidence vaccination -- i.e. app similar NHS app, state-provided information vaccination shown UK officials. (They want card two dates batch numbers written -- easily forged.)

I live Texas, I'm holding breath able participate scheme even gets go ahead. ‚ÄúI directed health department let federal government know sending government employees agents door-to-door compel vaccination would effective welcome strategy Missouri,‚Äù Parson said

Where come ""compel""? entirely voluntary. There's compulsion. guess bad Biden? rare flu much deadly kids, even tho annual vaccines that.   corrupt IOC FIFA?  wearing masks home? No, means ICU 10% vaccine, vaccine 10% goes ICU. mask thing almost definitely misapplication ""the ends justify means"", imagine.

I find hard believe group doctors legitimately said respiratory disease unaffected masks. 
Last time went doctor flu, remember wearing mask...  

I imagine wanted give time supply hospitals, panic people.  
I think good plan, seems like something ignorance actual explanation. 

It also makes wonder found promoting vaccines 100% savior better way promote higher vaccinations, rather saying vaccines best tools limitations. so, again, ""The ends justify means"", might end worsening situation, figureheads say ""We never could known would happen. data there."" hero! Oh fully agree help bit- extra linear distance virus would follow allow dissipate minimize dosage next person. given nature indoors bar airflow (in one particular situation I'm thinking of), sure end result much different.

If fan set pointing outdoors, proper exhaust/ac system, I'd say probably would've helped whole lot exact reasons noted. 

I entertain logic, friends going ""we plastic counters, we're safe"" hold me. virus tests worlds mettle. come together humans common cause? No. Tribalism rules day. Sorry realistic pessimism. Christ cancel thing already world downvoted? ""can"" means possibility. case unlikely. 

But virus mutate, needs infect host reproduce. reproduction carries mutations. vaccinated person, virus either actually infect host, infection eliminated much reproduction takes place. 

A vaccinated person exposing vaccine virus virus can't mutate response vaccine. You‚Äôre saying curve changed.

It not. yup, majority breakthrough cases asymptomatic proof vaccine effective. regards social policy, think kids difficult question. going great pressure add covid list mandatory vaccinations children already get, however, fence whether net positive. wants vaccine walk get vaccine, get sick really now.

This may true morally much medicine socialized one form another everyone else winds bearing cost illness. risk vaccine complications higher risk covid 12s would make sense. Yes, are, like pay people experience logical expected medical outcomes really dumb choices. 1st world going 3rd world anyways. think 100% vaccination compliance ever happen. expect virus us foreseeable future plan accordingly also allowing life return normal much can.  ‚ÄúA whole generation crippled‚Äù little dramatic don‚Äôt think? One county country.

So anecdotal evidence matters little.

And it‚Äôs telling incapable July 2020 July 2021 look similar growth rates large parts country due poor vaccine uptake shunning NPIs. Booster shots might needed. necessarily every year. maybe 60+ remote still crazy. Kids 12 aren‚Äôt much affected virus. certain point time privatize schools. Right. say election. Awesome, hopefully LatAm good next months vaccinating population, still sucks Thankfully parents immune compromised kids stay home parents work worry money. Also great immunocompromised kids need socialize get education like regular kids stay home whole lives instead relying regular kids wear mask allow everyone participate. /s
 
Edited add /s forgot sarcasm obvious days. read that! Yeah it‚Äôs great example lazy science people controlling placebo group assuming Covid worse kids hope vaccinated people say never wearing mask see this. sole purpose everything past 18 months prevent hospitals getting overran. absolutely matters it‚Äôs bad not. take focus severity going try chase zero Covid never happen. Covid-19 part 2 2022 ere go People adjust environment, anything new humans. Lowest global poverty starvation rates human history people think things getting worse... sad. UK lot fully vaccinated people hospitals now. Vaccines work, perfect. prevalence high enough consequences also vaccinated population.

Right. ""a lot"" vaccinated COVID-19 patients hospitals many, many times unvaccinated. according real world studies I've found far, major reduction likelihood hospitalization. CDC's study reports 94% effectiveness mRNA vaccines hospitalization, example.  Absolutely denier.

But knows don‚Äôt talk something people forget it, it‚Äôs ordered Florida public health make mentions Covid press social media run presidential elections. Agree, Americans tend travel significantly people 3-rd world countries. might opportunities mutations happen countries, there's likelihood American mutations spread most. May sound harsh sympathy gone anti vax parents get sick. data shows children statistically great risk Covid relates really getting sick, certainly transmit it. US adult walk pharmacy get shot, end getting Covid getting severely ill, that's point. got first Moderna shot yesterday. urging AMERICANS get vaccinated. Take jab. Save life. reading BC shortened required interval doses back. 7 weeks plenty. People capable concern others risk factors themselves. would expect subtle. sudden drop zero like feels like negligence incompetence. know Covid... how? former Marine, injected god knows many shots boot camp. can‚Äôt even remember consenting (maybe signed paper sometime, knows). Later got Anthrax shot, one ‚Äúoptional‚Äù, rest assured, going sign consent form. I‚Äôm vaccinated, shit me. Every unvaccinated (who chooses to) that‚Äôs issue. get invite get vaccinated card mail yet? assholes shoulda planned vaccination many, many months ago. Fucking incompetence. No, also eat slow cooked fatty foods. feeling 6ft realistic still able shop go appointments. said 12ft could even use building entrance hallway? Covid 19 becomes new annual flu mutating recurring every year new variants... kinda could.

I mean guess eventually death sun heat death universe put end nothing else. maintain strategic reserve N95s empty reason one ever bothered fill back again. stinks coverup. time logistics biting us ass again. Correct, isn‚Äôt ‚Äúnew‚Äù concept. Department Defense (DoD) administers 17 different vaccines, outlined Joint Instruction Immunizations Chemoprophylaxis (Secretaries Air Force, Army, Navy, Transportation, 1995) Honestly conjunction masking pretty much one effective workplace policies stem spread covid.  work outbreaks surrounding communal eating.  wife‚Äôs job covid cases stopped person infected (they eat outside workspaces). suggested eating together undid benefit everything else do.  told could wanted. stayed away break room weeks fully vaccinated.  lot staff got covid. didn‚Äôt. state unvaxxed people rarely bother get tested, even they‚Äôre sick. Unless end hospitalized, hospitals basically mandate test anyone admitted. So, one low population counties lot unvaxxed people, percentage positive covid tests strongly correlates number hospitalized people.

Counties state 55/65% vaccinated 1-2% testing positive.
Counties 20/30% vaccinated 6-9% positive. He‚Äôs downvoted huge swathes younger population UK won‚Äôt offered second vaccine unlock, blaming fully vaccinated moronic.  Yeah fuck everyone 40 right? It‚Äôs obviously fault weren‚Äôt eligible first dose early enough double vaccinated government‚Äôs randomly selected unlocking date, deserve what‚Äôs coming them. make little nervous. sent kids camp fully vaccinated. know kids too, it‚Äôs bit scary. create beautiful mass offer lots thoughts prayers infected too. closer God. could vaccinated staff. thinking? It‚Äôs infuriating. act like everything could. said staffing starting become issue way stop spread without sending everyone home. said camp many things prevent happening. made sure quarantine ones away ones sick, kept group smaller year trying prevent this. really went way prevent this, makes sad,"" said.

They didn‚Äôt go far way. needed free, easily available vaccines. Well that‚Äôs heartbreaking.  ‚Äúpretty safe‚Äù entire time pay attention survival rates. Nextstrain.org They're abused disregarded lazy selfish enough vaccinate themselves. **SURPRISE!!**

- Delta work different shots give you. think adults need either. vaccines readily available risk minimized acceptable tolerance level‚Ä¶then yes, covid effectively over. 

That said, someone baby, every precaution taken right family given individual circumstances. think everyone pretty good understanding safe vs risky point Yea sure. curious far pandemic there‚Äôs studies quantify risks.  Costco giving free samples again, officially actual thoughts went thought. Damn thots also second worst new per capita cases sane parents flying kids Northeast camp. don‚Äôt know, would rather kids take risk way avoid risk easy. It‚Äôs horrible precedent start mandating things fully fda approved  you. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

But local doctors nurses, made monumental sacrifices year, begging get shot. Ditto folks can‚Äôt get vaccinated. 

If don‚Äôt want help vulnerable, help people help you‚Äôre vulnerable, that‚Äôs you. 

Seems like dick move me. Especially sacrifice end almost certainly mild fever day forced watch Netflix Tylenol. 15-year-old sister going get first Pfizer dose next week. She‚Äôs thrilled! mum, dad brother, Sinovac gang. We‚Äôre going isolate sister tho, she‚Äôll receive 5g vaccine shed virus #wakeup

/s case xD first table missing two-shot data AZ second missing two-shot data both. think draw conclusion. still think that's twisted, can't tell feel. pandemic brutal, sounds like rough go it. back public completely table hope find little slice happiness. 

I found solace suddenly lot time fiddle around little home brewery play then-newborn, now-toddler son I'd normally office.

A lot situation sucks, play hand we're dealt. frustration people behaving way would want to, let's leave alone. philosophical conversation liberty, good \[often\] bad, work well internet -- see every political post ever.

I'm inferring lot younger am. I'll leave encouraging keep chin up. age hated good chunk humanity well, older get, realize there's lot love world even lot people behave way we'd want to. 

Signed, 
Some old dude internet. Makes sense, there‚Äôs way it‚Äôs 100% accurate even died hospital. even hospitals make mistakes. Source? infect people may unvaccinated, could serious illnesses - even death - ""sniffles.""  Seattle well. I‚Äôm going Mariners game tonight. first large crowd I‚Äôve since early 2020. I‚Äôm super stoked! know common long Covid kids?

Knock wood actual COVID generally worse flu RSV, silver lining whole pandemic vs prior ones. 

If long COVID relatively common though (as opposed 1 1000 side effect whatever) that‚Äôs game changer  Florida Man here. Pretty sure Florida going Florida Man way pandemic. Pretty. Sure.  mean know absolutely tired. Today line store. got comfortable without mask. guy front coughed made sound like clearing throat kinda. notice eh shit over. can't see basket gets register. Fucking thermometer, Nyquil, soup. God damnit. probably going sick next week. think let guard down. pay walled. ask account sign up. Even you‚Äôre obese doesn‚Äôt mean would likely die covid though, like age example.  Sounds like perception problem end It‚Äôs funny cause didn‚Äôt present evidence, shouldn‚Äôt assume informed close minded probable _not_ informed _is_ close minded. Thanks butting proving point. think delta variant came from? mutate thin air? course not. mutated inside body human. infections = higher chance creating deadly variants, god forbid, variant breaks vaccine immunity. never response one lol  I'm worked up, made mistake.  figure that? US huge vaccine rate/uptake months ago countries catching up. 

Comparing US UK, seeing something like 88% effectiveness two doses 33% one dose. US pretty much par top vaccine rate countries fully vaccinated population, island countries really small countries higher rates. importantly look vaccination rates Delta variant became dominant UL vs US. UK became dominant beginning may UK 25% people fully vaccinated. Delta Variant dominant US now, almost 50% people fully vaccinated, skewing higher west variant seen dominant California 51%, Oregon Washington 55% population fully vaccinated. going back beginning may, US 35% fully vaccinated UK 25% significant difference. also major metro areas west 65% fully vaccination rate. 

Now go beyond compare London borough area western US metros. They‚Äôre reporting 52% adults (18+) fully vaccinated. look multnomah (Portland OR) king county (Seattle) Portland 75% adults Seattle 79% adults fully vaccinated. 

So yeah, don‚Äôt think compare delta variant UK might happen US Well, read article? Exactly, thing happening last year. bad guess. could protected themselves. much matters. government private companies? Agreed, briefly interact 9 year old yesterday though bit concerned there. Wish would roll vaccine already kids age digress. guess better notify author. title piece says almost certainly needed. guess one asked you. U.S. says Misery unwelcome rest country. worker simply knocking people's doors compel others take vaccine. He's spreading fear dishonesty.  proof didn‚Äôt happen didn‚Äôt vaccines virus everywhere country. didn‚Äôt collapse come close. Cleaning surfaces really relevant preventing covid. important thing adequate ventilation. Open windows, turn exhaust fans, etc.   understand. wearing mask, got vaccinated, worried about. safe right?? People get vaccinated also getting virus. vaccinations prevent getting virus, help prevent symptoms virus. can't tell body decides stops making white blood cells antibodies. get next vaccine. 4 months 5 months 6 months. every years get vaccine like flu vaccine. every 4 6 months. vaccine card bullshit know body stops making antibodies. hope Delta Variant becomes even dominant, Governors wake right thing. this, forcing parents either work cases, send kids unsafe situation, could easily made safer simple action. something important need specified. Vaccine passport required outbreak place. Otherwise, required.

For exemple, outbreak factory, employees vaccination passport would ones authorized come workplace.

Or multiple outbreak bars Montreal, passport could necessary enter bars Montreal. 

Since start pandemic, every region Quebec managed differently according situation think change future. please stop saying stuff like then? admit guessing 100 people spreading propaganda vaccines somehow make pandemic worse. Wait look steep increase Netherlands...

Opening nightclubs, leaking DCC app, zero enforcement even lax laws, Delta: perfect storm. Vaccinated people get hit hard covid, unless immune system weakened conditions had. Obviously doctor knowledge this, worried would vaccinated someone explain me? Japan's new daily cases 75% since 2 months ago. Cases trending slightly, nowhere near previous levels. seeing 21 deaths per day (down 115), number falling every day. What's going here? state emergency 2 months Yes symptoms surprisingly. lost taste smell breathing well. know chances hospitalization go pretty much 0 though. really don‚Äôt know endemic means you? Guess I'm never gonna able fly back England see family rate. 1 step forward, 2 steps back country approve 12 year olds cares moment. certain point get sick due unvaccinated choice little sympathy me.  Drug companies make money developing treatments, cures. Treatments mean repeat business. Gotcha. mis-read comment.

Most people outside south/east US believe like here. truly believe approx. \~65% people believe COVID real. think think sort hoax curtail fReEdOm. probably gone i'm high risk. seen many friends close capacities get vaccinated. lonely year lol things get really bad hospitals fill up, it‚Äôs normal thing.

Especially summers.

Your article talking one bad flu season past decade show hospitals usually full. goal vaccines though? I'm 7 weeks since first dose tomorrow, British Columbia. really hope get invite book second dose soon! can't wait join list fully vaccinated individuals!"
