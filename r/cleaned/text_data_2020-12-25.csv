You say cop.

Also, biggest country world? joking? thought guys tremendous education system? saving comment indictment modern American, almost reads like parody Trump speech. Honestly probably way round incorrect, vaccine campaign started last week first take vaccine. 


The reason though (along number officials) combat wave antivaxxer misinformation propagated WhatsApp groups caused significant decline number people signing vaccine. Uk citizens haven‚Äôt allowed fly untried states since March...  Oddly enough ive breezed it. Isolation, already pro level ""agorophobic"" ‚úî, depression ‚úî, already broke jobless.

My whole life ive planning bad shit go living constant panic anxiety. fucking home turf im sure lot people debilitating mental illnesses used constant state fucked up-ness. country something similar happens. Latinoamerica series dubbed neutral spanish, lot kids (including little) talked neutral accent instead ours, lol  Admit defeat? mindset got 300,000 ever many people dead point killed first place. Yup, he's also discounting social capital comes medicine. successful investment banker, that's nice, people respect money, profession. Whereas put doctors pedestal reserved almost profession America. 

Those kids could go dental school make much money faster easier, go med school instead clout (and sometimes even genuine desire help others).   reshape Med school education process. 

Much exists today vestige AMA (american medical association) trying limit # new doctors year limited supply ensures highest salaries possible. 

Lots qualified people can't attend Med school due limited # spots schools residency programs -- one reasons import doctors overseas -- allow AMA limit many educated here.

Also, cannot surveilled without warrant government agency. intense process lose jobs immediately fail. Source: work agency.

28th worst world gun violence? Yeah, comes ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù part. Also, would half much violence US didn‚Äôt black people since commit half homicides, much likely use firearms races.

Highest death toll due Covid? No, that‚Äôs we‚Äôre biggest country world. China suppresses Covid statistics anyways. wonder US Covid cases Sweden despite Sweden‚Äôs herd immunity approach? **Do REALLY wonder?** awful argument, argument flawed skewed statistics.

Yes, we‚Äôre passing stimulus. already passed several rounds. We‚Äôre working next batch. Hold tight. survey UK accent associations years ago recall correctly Scottish accents considered connote trustworthiness. assume that‚Äôs reputable Edinburgh financial institution variety rather 3am Glaswegian kebab shop variety.

Oof. ‚ÄúAmerica best everything‚Äù propaganda you‚Äôre able see through. also re: education, well educated people also shockingly low rating education across board, offer wealthy.

Very people go such, always said decades ago, would definitely died. part die then, took good year feel good again, changed me. 
This year changed too.
I hope you‚Äôre well, enjoy regained health!
If need talk it, feel free dm me. county projects it'll least June get vaccine. I've steeling mentally possibility lock pretty drastically. assume everyone going abandon masks social distancing death rate falls, choice stay home.

I worry much dying covid, sometimes people need hospital recover, lingering effects. want me, especially vaccine available gotten yet. Yes 100% people get vaccinated immediately. think might bit skewed, imagine lot people (myself included) finally time talk someone mental health pursue diagnosis first time. Added bonus don‚Äôt go medical office access mental health care via zoom such. second thought r/NotTheOnion! agree lot said, sure people aren‚Äôt following guidelines, still... Strictest restrictions country, mask wearing social distancing, yet cases country. makes sense? 

I go college LA live con state. outside streets LA 95% people wearing masks. home probably 15% (more inside businesses stuff, still). doesn‚Äôt make sense me. guess shows virus tough beat matter do. Remember, vaccine critics, situation exasperating, *possibly* hurt vaccine. pathetic, selfish, spoiled sociopath. i've seen survey indicates anywhere half americans take it. would indicate 65-70% would, seems rising time. say non-american: think percentage antivaxxers america exaggarated type people really like rag america. anyway, even 60% america took it, would much free summer last Find first testing gene sequence whole borders open thing stupid, prob inside country quite awhile now.

I‚Äôll edit times add links, I‚Äôll start ‚ÄúMost herd-immunity calculations don‚Äôt anything say behaviour all. assume there‚Äôs interventions, behavioural changes anything like that,‚Äù says. means transient change people‚Äôs behaviour (such physical distancing) drives Rt down, ‚Äúas soon behaviour goes back normal, herd-immunity threshold change.‚Äù Fun fact. Medical corporations hospitals hiring nurse practitioners physicians assistants ‚Äúhealth care provider‚Äù. new hires large group physicians. emergency rooms urgent cares staffed cheaper providers.

On another note wasn‚Äôt sure would happen industry never really know places shut down. decided get paralegal certification since classes moved online week. 10 classes. Less year. People always suing people. Dont hope pass own. Seek professional help asap otherwise fester come back stronger couple months later.

Sending good vibes husband.

I'm end rope too. forget seek help take care yourself. vast majority med schools *not* go MCAT optional, (some already prior year). agree probably increase due people sending scores, would put wager 20% increase due that. fact, even first week applications opening already huge increase. apply early usually ‚Äúon top it‚Äù applicants, hard time thinking many chose send scores. schools, yes, average [\~27k per year 2017-2018 4 year like 104k. that's pretty picture either. People like comment. cases, people's accents change due illness, sounds like rhythm altered. wonder would also affect singing dancing. fixing mend computer? Brace shitty 2021. Also, fact killing one group people could help ease pandemic, government officials idiots always loved dystopian sci fi books, feel like fiction.  I've respect many friends coworkers past year Tbf applicants med school objectively good thing *The risk took calculated, boy bad math.* Oh gotcha yeah going guess Bay Area somewhere California paying Western Europe? GDP

Yet among worst income inequality OECD, also poor quality business

That's identical first culture

You joking education

Coupled highest education debt military

Yep, sure waste lot money military get ortho least 8 years school 6-7 years residency/fellowship.

Out thirty year career. time mid-forties debt-free, making huge amounts money job security least mid-sixties. banker that, way. 1.)people stopped giving fuck. Straight up, parties gatherings everywhere.

2.)the ""restrictions"" significantly less strict ones back spring time thus generally less effective

3.)LAX direct flights London Heathrow Airport. There's good chance UK coronavirus variant came took over. love Reddit sometimes see posts like I‚Äôm baffled stupid are.

Like days ago /r/politics post Planet Earth narrator ‚Äúpunching fist air‚Äù heard Trump lost election. #2 (maybe even 1) whole site, iirc.

But give people small goals, seem much achievable. makes happy. think we‚Äôre hill. 10+ ‚Äúgap year‚Äù? Yes didn‚Äôt know protect people haven‚Äôt yet vaccinated. like kids back home can't wait get ""over there"" fight Jerries. idea awful last 9 months physicians medical personnel, addition pandemic, dealt employers failing protect safety pay cut middle pandemic. news first person dies outright getting vaccine gonna sell like hotcakes.

But 350,000 dead covid-19? Meh. Maybe hoax. 

Now flatter I'm rational, sarcasm. /s applies above. easy find places subs people freak vaccine death even believe virus deaths. minute, going iocane powder. takers? Sorry rant

Don't sorry, honest reaction life changing experience.

Shortly earned undergrad sharing house friends, sister one housemates gotten rejection letter med school. brilliant person us knew close 4.0 biochemistry top college earned great MCAT score... AMA yearly admission size limits designed keep profession's salaries high possible... still 1 million tests daily cases gone Jesus, heck do?? Everyone wants chance crippling student loan debt lol wrong rejection? rejected graduate schools physics multiple times worked fast food place two years making name within R1 research school. conceited. I'm sure struggled deal personal losses before. much work varies specialty specialty since I'm surgical field really know job variety like surgery. say hospitals I've done surgical rotations at, everyone medical students supervising full doctors put inhumane hours. Maybe go smaller community less idk really Yeah big party scene back Wow... rate, distribute AED's Uber Lyft drivers Unless teach remotely. willing return school ASAP would fight make sure teachers next. fight returning, get early access. Bro people 2 floors, mistake rich people Micasa tucasa  don‚Äôt ask many questions honest. Considering political divisive issue is.

I think partly many us already covid didn‚Äôt experience significant symptoms. Partly vaccine produced quickly people want wait see.

The health organizations claim it‚Äôs safest thing world still lot unknowns. don‚Äôt even know long remains effective extent even effective yet.  Call cops tell what? super rich ass people going big party New Years eve? Haha fat chance anything happens, NYPD havent done anything parties far, ain't changing now. catch act, dont accept gig know time place. im accepting im damn sure calling cops Umm.. what? paying loans long time. really want debt house, go tech. Anyone get job software engineer going coding boot camp; college degree required. market still hot, viable career option. Gen surgery made bank due abdominal surgeries, interventional endoscopy starting taking those. still lot interventional endoscopy still developing. Look Christmas spike 2-2.5 weeks. Atop Thanksgiving spike going massive. 3rd 4th weeks New Year's spike going colossal. think I'm going borrow time mid January. KNOW OMG, freaked found that. like.....‚Äùgreat new strain that‚Äôs even contagious original, tf end pandemic‚Äù. BTW, new strain totally US, question. first discovered September ive heard, it‚Äôs MONTHS get here. fun stuff. Let tell you, smart hardwork AF become dermatologist. Even field isnt cerebrally demanding time consuming, itself. Calling BS because:

1) schools waiving MCAT. people suspect applying think going easier get into.

2) People extra time jobs also suspect something that.

3) one going apply medical school Fauci. knew sheer amount work goes applying, let alone MCAT everything else would know instantly again, one gonna apply name. mistake typo. Yes, decided wanted pursue career medicine around time graduated undergrad 2014 started med school 2019. Unless kids winging mcat didn‚Äôt read pre-req lists, they‚Äôre applying anywhere lol. India using stop testing act like everything normal method. Hey I‚Äôm human like everyone else humans make mistakes worked Australia. lol. India using stop testing act like everything normal. interesting! research/ sources this? Would love read Twitter said starting week, remove content spreads vaccine-related conspiracies false widely debunked claims shot‚Äôs effects.

Hope works, shit platforms let slide past.

I would like thank nurses doctors worked hard past year, keep good work guys, count every day, real heroes. good question ask r/COVID19 doctors scientists are. Amateurs US actually pretty comparable size Australia, considering virus coming significantly Canada Mexico also similar lack land borders. countries like Australia advantage US same, still blew anyway. I‚Äôm curious Masters Public Health degrees also see surge news first person dies outright getting vaccine gonna sell like hotcakes. inevitable - 330 million Americans, virtually _guaranteed_ someone keel second vaccine hits bloodstream. 99.999% safe means 3,300 people potentially mortal danger. Where's journalism little factoid? That's horrible news. ""Acceptable losses"" always are. maybe dont lock people fucking apartments wont sad? crazy know code charts. Recently I've seen fewer deaths, people getting discharged oxygen. I'm curious long take lung function return--or issues could face road. Jokes pandemic, already mental disorders

\*Smug Leonardo Meme\* People live, eat, take care family. real issue people responsible. People live outside means save. want blame something, blame materialism literally happening right I. data science/analytics field hate even vaccine, sudden severe allergic reactions happen sorts reasons. Using hair dye deadly. everything wrong profession. What...

Your first last point contradict higher tax brackets much less impacted due access better healthcare wfh. rediculus argument seen think terms doses allotted Colorado fantastic job. Since Colorado started vaccinations presumably 15th allotted 175,550 vaccines, use 87,775 doses January 5th (for Pfizer) January 12th (for Moderna). Thinking way Colorado used 71% possible doses. amazing would mean Colorado track likely distribute fast coming in. depends state. am, medical exceptions. using Ivermectin yonder? know taken dendritic cells via endocytosis, mRNA translated, broken attached transmembrane protein receptors travels lymphatic system interact B cells produce corresponding antibodies disease. Literally normal immune reaction, unlike polio vaccine cannot contract even minor form covid vaccine component virus (spike protein) encoded within mRNA. read, ""getting knocked ass"" immune system basically booting up. cells within body take vaccine, could translate mRNA protein, likely anything short degraded proteases that's mRNA possibly chopped RNAses. Please correct made mistake. 4 others lying probably get college money back looked applying graduate program University Edinburgh much academic terminology different could barely understand application. realized probably wasn‚Äôt good fit didn‚Äôt apply. I'm guessing meant customer support rather computer science It‚Äôs people problem government problem

Problem government full people.

Evil, greedy, belligerent getting 7 years radiology residency? 5 + 1 year fellowship year majority cases. people even starting sign jobs without fellowships nowadays market good. overall agree point. Medicine still great SAFE avenue job stability great salary. Even true (unlikely, med school applications take 2-3 years get together) never result doctors available treat patients unless GME funding residency positions increases. bottleneck numerical limitation many doctors churned every year. number increased 25 years. 
 
- source, doctor residency Oh shit didn‚Äôt know haha autocorrect didn‚Äôt catch it. big person admits wrong I‚Äôll admit didn‚Äôt know can't chocolate much caffeine wires up. suggest carob cause like it. what? go here?! I'm med school applicant cycle. Even Dr. Fauci knows true. many positions clinical experiences shut including scientific research. Many people wrongly assumed would fewer applicants due people meeting typical ""standard"" competitive med school admissions. 

As med schools started signaling would willing review applications ""holistically"" account might enough clinical experiences MCAT scores, believe people would otherwise wait another year gain experiences take exam gave cycle try. 

With many people jobless home, also lot time average college student submit applications too. said, also inspired pandemic ugly things revealed system systemic racism health inequity. good thing people want physicians, AAMC says much-- however, much done actually expand number doctors train country. Yeah eating disorder back new heights Yeah one. word wanted ""barely"". would think college educated person would know that. win internet today, friend. Throw iv oxygen keeps stable stable Yeah. graduated high honors, got publications belt, hit 93%+ MCAT score, usual pre med stuff, still didnt get md phd program even tho dream college slaved away research job felt like ‚Äúmy duty‚Äù save god awful postdoc‚Äôs research project. Glad hindsight would rough 8 years, still bit salty sucked hauled ass, gone broke, sacrificed much rejected. Whatever guess, got good life killing industry, I‚Äôm thoroughly disenchanted higher education dedicating early 20s met rejection. still wonder would got in, guess destiny industrializing biology. Sorry rant, hits feels garbage med school application process many talented people needlessly rejected.

And really want picky, It‚Äôs mobile emergency room. taxi. Medical help starts even get in. 

You know taxi? Get point point B. get ambulance life either prolonged saved, abusing ambulance. 

At rate, you‚Äôre pissy argue with. Enjoy that. :p There‚Äôs lot going around. careful there. would dangerous experience draw? People... Viruses work exponentially. Hospitals stretching max now. Next month active cases doubled again, 3% average death rate go number deaths per day skyrocket. virus got deadly, society failed make sacrifices. opinion people dying per case, raw numbers ""much worse already is."" Every country managed pandemic horribly, yes. I'm surprised heard stories reactions adverse side effects. many shots given already expected more. dude...there's 400 million US alone.

328. 400. matters.

Strike children count. That's ~72 million. 

Now we're 250 million. population, decent size people outright refuse it, vaccinating fraction population cause hospitalizations deaths free fall fraction now. Dude fuck think ambulance for. literally taxi emergency room. 

People aren‚Äôt taking advantage, can‚Äôt afford it. emergency room can‚Äôt turn away, that‚Äôs use ‚Äúfamily doctor‚Äù say. Stop demonizing poor trying die.

Source? first person I've heard say this. I'm necessarily disagreeing you, I'd like able read read, able show others needed.  Dude, it‚Äôs meme response. know system shit. People also take advantage. 

You may need chill out. Maybe call taxi... oh wait, mean ambulance. bullshit.

It's survival fittest bro, tourism industries fit all. deserve wither die. pandemic ends industries spring right back again.

What loser Still waiting little bit  Population density shown factor .
If spots people different groups gather (schools, work, church, malls, grocery stores, etc) required. end January, COVID 40% less deadly US (and elsewhere)

I've several people argue true... seem understand basic logistics this.

Deaths randomly spread throughout population, even though sub seems pretend healthy 30 year old likely die 75 year old nursing home resident. everyone paid taxes, one wouldn‚Äôt paying. system massively fucking broken. example, people develop short-term immunity virus infected vaccinated, become susceptible ‚Äî¬†in contrast lasting immunity.

Yet solid third news feed stuff posted various groups anti-mask COVID-denier articles throughout pandemic. nothing stop spread misinformation, even add ‚ÄúCOVID misinformation‚Äù reason reporting. Fuckers sold public health probably resulted thousands deaths increased engagement. inquiry whole fiasco. Yeah surprise me. I'm knocking 40 hardest year life. I'm actually surprised still job grateful fact.

I spent good chunk early year complete isolation I'm finishing year back again.

I'm person position I'm navel gazing, trying make point same... alone. That‚Äôs true, plan year two ahead time regards timing. Regardless, it‚Äôs many decide pursue Med school within months year. decide least 2-3 years ahead time pre-recs needed along resume-building extracurriculars. screws people.  what's scoreboard Big #1 &amp; #2? No, people hospital get released, moved ICU, freeing bed. people ambulance get admitted. also don‚Äôt know sick everyone ambulance might be. I‚Äôve seen post seem reasonably psychotic me.

Here, let make really, really clear you...

Here CDC numbers flu deaths 2018:

484

Flu infects approximately 8% people every year. sources COVID,

The CDC unhelpfully cut figures 18. include 24 year olds. However let's err massively side ""COVID worse"" use figures include many adults well. total deaths today 

567.

Remember, includes 19-24 year olds massively skews numbers.

Number estimated COVID infections US:

91 guess, believe figures fake probably makes like, 2% LA county population. say LA low density incorrect, except maybe comparing NY SF. also said Mexican flu impact Africa, many cases there.

A years later research including testing anti-bodies. Turns large part population Africa catch virus.

My guess similar time around. hear much news, there. Maybe less deadly overall population age. maybe often mistaken misrepresented malaria even read link? 

It SAY ALL. absolutely say 10* deadly 0-18 year olds. Show me. Come on, quote it. says 11-17, obviously massively skews average. purposely ignoring 0-11 age bracket blows point water. ACTUAL facts

But I'll take living country government welds people homes day. Yeah, sound like crazy person. Spain's numbers cannot trusted. reported zero deaths days months June August, allegedly save tourism season. Yep. think pandemic tell us lot character around us. Really shows selfless enough protect vulnerable, passive eugenist. None changes anything, dude. annual mortality long downward trend.

You missing important context here. 

Swedens mortality long expected rise around 2020 next 10-20 years, owing fact child births grew 1935-1945. words Sweden 80-85 years olds alive today ever before, meaning lot people risk. 

Child births Sweden grew more, started earlier, rest Europe, war torn country.

Yes, life expectancy steadily increased. doesnt mean mortality keep going ever, know read population pyramids right? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Walking COVID wonderland

It‚Äôs beginning look lot like we‚Äôre running ICU beds get downvotes, absolutely correct, two doses, 28 days apart, week two 6 weeks. least half population dead. Imagine that. 99% cases, yes. It‚Äôs risk 1% want address. point, man also went office. July 31, member family alerted police learning hospital fled.  day, officers found man‚Äôs vehicle bath facility‚Äôs parking lot. **‚ÄúIf didn‚Äôt go work, company‚Äôs performance would suffer,‚Äù** quoted prefectural government. India's biggest news channel she'll take second gets luggage conveyor belt destination airport. guarantee you, woman asymptomatic carrier, she'll infect someone. Jesus lymphocytes. heard strain identified UK contagious also apt deliver heavy viral load. ouch! Yep. read estimates vulnerable vaccinated 90% deaths gone (or even more).

Then we're flu mortality levels! Interesting. Imagine actually happens like brain drain America medical staff tired people help making job impossible. amazing eh! every person requires oxygen today would dead 1918 technology.

A hundred years technological advances medicine matter. way, left leaning, much American would like. follow Trump Republicans love see train wreck slow motion. actually *read* comments, I'm sure would pretty obvious. Also, like follow subs outside convictions, point staying inside echo chamber.

Of course US politically fucked. Probably heading towards civil strife major scale, geopolitical has-been. Dane, really matter much me. grand scale, world becoming peaceful. Yes currently testing kids young 12. could begin testing younger populations go well. could pediatric vaccine end 2021. Idk seems soon terms vaccines idk vaccine one? totally agree you. people always confuse consider infant mortality. like hearing someone commenting 1500's saying lived till 30. no. childbirth mom deaths diseases kill children. probably lot 80 year olds wandering around old plague bubole scars, there! think get statistics well either. country total population average much younger countries likely (work CI want) subgroup population averages much younger too. Meaning Nigerian doctors probably younger \*on average\* USA doctors. It‚Äôs Korean government wanting go restrictive level 3 despite already met criteria it. that‚Äôs already raised threshold would trigger level. It‚Äôs money voters. 

Instead put new measures Christmas New Years. doesn‚Äôt amount much, really. still eat inside restaurants. anything want, really. 5 person private gathering thing sounds lot restrictive actually is. need wear mask everywhere compliance good.

Chances good new measures least stabilize number cases, though. 

And comparison much rest world, Korea still quite well. Yes. Someone even held caroling protest, stand freedom. Super duper. Changes nothing regarding vaccine, fear mongering scare people compliance. Late spring/ early summer seems rather optimistic considering Pfizer expects ship 50 million doses us march. think you‚Äôre giving church much credit good things. end day, one goal church convert people. puts church interesting moral position: charity expect something return? example, providing food people need good thing guilt trip attending church ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù provided food? Similarly, spend life avoiding Sin explicit goal going Heaven, good person? may done good (‚Äúgood‚Äù) things motives selfish. Compare people religious still choose good things without immediately thinking could benefit them. 

Plus, IMHO, church negative cultural impact well. encourages people reject critical thinking say ‚ÄúEvolution lie Noah lived 600 years old.‚Äù Religion also destroys families; hear stories time people disowned came got divorced. show *19 Kids Counting* excellent example incredibly problematic Christantiy be. say looking forward vaccine next 2 weeks. Covid-20 entered chat Yeah it‚Äôs probably California already, got dispersed country Christmas. We‚Äôre fucked!ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Also they‚Äôre dropping nurse ratio requirements everywhere too. Instead 2 3 patients, nurses take 6 mean things like broadcast.

People expecting like movie people flooding hospitals droves mass panic.

Really it‚Äôs like fast leaking faucet clogged. water reached top slowly pouring edge. One many, would guess. person biological chemistry complex times answer be: could might attribute. True, comparable.

But shows blanket statements like ""whoever contribute money government receive benefits"". Christmas miracle! Fewer 100,000 new cases. Congratulations America, end pandemic begun. Yes, math says reaching herd immunity current vaccines difficult impossible new strain's increased transmission verified.  Source? Religion Worth $1.2 Trillion U.S. Economy, Much Google ($1.23 trillion) Apple ($1.3 trillion).
CHURCHES PAY TAXES. yup. dont live LA, simply number excess cars street today tells surge next 4-8 weeks (and area live generally good masking up) Immunity works brake. certain level everything goes back normal. herd immunity threshold, number new cases constant time. Assaf Harofeh Medical Center outside Tel Aviv, testers found 49 suspected cases new virus strain.

19 suspected cases found another lab southern Israel. patients suspected variant left country recently, **heightening fears new virus strain spreading inside Israel**, report said.

Levy said hundreds test samples currently undergoing genetic mapping mutated strain, indicated likely cases new variant confirmed. 

The developments came infections continued surge Israel country prepared third national lockdown take effect Sunday evening.

The Health Ministry reported 4,046 new cases Thursday ‚Äî highest daily number since last lockdown Maybe many people asymptomatic. Feminism achieved Weapon Mass Destruction Jews? Terrible, think COVID lifted lid poor governance tbh boyfriend's family (Orange County) cautious. cousin died covid weeks ago sister recovered it.

Their 87 year old mother lives sister. they've gone Mexico visit three sons. speechless. I've known family 15 years. They're partiers. lost family members swine flu buried cousin. can't believe they're even taking mom house, let alone country. can't seem get point, maybe clear. everyone sick people. whine people chasing making mean posts. heaven forbid someone points actually ones exact thing.

Oh, no. can't point they're ones obnoxious thinga. think point, want hug anything get vaccinated blaming you. I‚Äôm sure reasons getting surgery things werent bad then. making point given current situation stands now, would consider procedure couldn‚Äôt wait pandemic hopefully blows mid next year.

Not discounting validity mental health concerns, tbf half country‚Äôs  mental health getting hammered right now. gotta power through. hospitals water everything fair game  fuck wrong you? That‚Äôs happened Florida all, hit peak summer (though it‚Äôs getting now). lost girlfriend 3 years year partly reason. Anti vaxxers infuriating people planet  know yet herd immunity kicks level?

From countries overrun like Peru Ecuador etc. Yeah. PTSD ADD, combined days blending good sleep mental health, either. :/ strain easy catch. Wow. many variants now?

I know anything virology. somebody tell unusual mutation rate virus? tested kids know UK, Netherlands working RN puts middle income category means enough pay lead comfortable life.

Shifts 8 hours, workweek 36 hours, every weekend free, 4 weeks paid holiday per year, paid sick leave, paid maternity leave, decent pension plan, disability payment 70% pension date reason can't work anymore. Unemployment benefits two years, can't fired unless proven gross incompetence.

Add good schools, great infrastructure public transport, clean water decent air quality. downside expensive housing especially large cities. Wow yes well explained. 

It‚Äôs terribly bad reporting suggest it‚Äôs U.K. people U.K. that‚Äôs people testing it. 

It‚Äôs also clear route took U.K. came ports airports. Unlikely evolved port it. 

Even one found France, unlikely man U.K., likely one they‚Äôve tested sequenced recently. worth saving granny imho. point is? Nobody catches every case, would need infrastructure test everybody several days row. Post made realize I‚Äôve eating less past 2-3 weeks. It‚Äôs probably related virus match made heaven   types masks people use matter LOT. wear KN95 masks (best get days) I‚Äôm exception. Well, two full jab age group. Half dose
followed full dose, 55 younger. Huge difference. 84m?!?! Omg go college LA live con state. outside streets LA 95% people wearing masks. home probably 15% (more inside businesses stuff, still). doesn‚Äôt make sense me. guess shows virus tough beat matter do.

Based started paragraph, almost certain going say masks work. Good thing didn't. 


It's sheer numbers. Even latest surge, we're still better per capita basis many parts country, yeah, would've figured 95% masking would gone lot actually did.

I chalk people good masking bad everything else (ex. abstaining parties non-essential travel). New Yorkers work fucking hard make sure happened March April doesn‚Äôt happen again. you‚Äôre thick short memory think happened new york onset pandemic equivalent happening need bit critical thought Definitely keep eye them- grandma got covid months ago. She‚Äôs extremely high risk, honestly didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd make it.

The first days weren‚Äôt bad, mild symptoms. Slowly ramped week. got worse quickly though, oxygen dropped incredibly fast. ended spending two days hospital (not ventilator though) fine now.

If they‚Äôve exposure two weeks, they‚Äôre probably okay, definitely make sure check much possible! Bill Gates becomes super rich donates great causes. rich prick done good mankind one could even imagine. 

Wealth selfishness aren‚Äôt connected much all. anything, wealth like vodka makes already are. 

Me: rag riches personally grew ghetto live gated communities. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair look happened March happening say it‚Äôs thing.  80% people right thing 80% time, still issues.

Cause 20% whatever hell want, eventually bump 80% slip up. check r/covid19positive subreddit!

You also get pulse ox delivered (usually bad amazon christmas could make shipping take while). 

Tbh (heavily depending live) probably admitted hospital go, even oxygen kind low shortness breathe. Hospitals already lowkey triaging place. gone ER time last year low ox SOB would probably admitted. send home steriods inhaler.

My advice contact PCP (or get one) discuss symptoms. go ER literally dying. Otherwise lay low, take vitamins, get sunshine able, drink TONS water! 

I hope smooth quick recovery friend! People summer eat corn.... state fairs true, fuss vaccines?!

Seems like lot unknown reports. Yeah there's lot Russian Chinese trolls. Covid good value money want spread FUD. people get suckered work pro bono. target every sub large numbers people, find everywhere. Internet, reddit sub. Nope new year around corner it‚Äôs def going get worse. many people couldn‚Äôt give getting together one year. Thank god. counting blessings glass half-full 2020 ! Seriously though!!! hate people blatantly ignore lockdowns refuse wear masks, yet go hospital put healthcare workers (and anyone else come contact getting hospital) risk get sick!  consider ""leaks"" doctors sounding alarms time jailed ""spreading rumors"" private citizens access social media cut showing going weeks ""confirmed"" human-human transmission.


I referring lancet studies released early January. actual thing China specifically held back week, full sequencing virus.

I dont think realise, time government condemning doctors punishing them, virus already officially acknowledged globally. like actually shared anything behaviour virus then, youre overstating useful 'leaks' knowing situation China.

Social media videos leaks. Otherwise calling ghe footage Italy back March, footage LA rn 'leaks' Still wonder officials many places never acknowledged this, sometimes citing lack data showing schools significant spreading environments. seems obvious tbh. Wtg USA! You‚Äôre #1 üôÑ happening LA county hospitals. hasn‚Äôt started happening Bay Area yet, hospitals also can‚Äôt take overflow various central southern CA hospitals either, we‚Äôre barely scraping by.

There‚Äôs nowhere else send patients. Battlefield triage. emoji though? Wich totally useless unless lock everyone tests done. get you. 

But let's say variant escaped three cases X country average. spread exponentially there. 

But 50,000 known UK cases (number invented know), spreading exponentially. 

It *still* makes sense lock tsunami even ocean waves begin rise elsewhere. want go 3 root cases 20 50 overnight. Nah. Stupid people entertaining. Ah, that's mistake actually. I'm NI open. turned tower block nightingale first wave. 'stood down' put standby numbers super low. back open though covid patients (and regular patients, obviously part, seem strict time around) second one opened step type facility covid patients. keep forgetting ones England. nation full ignorant selfish idiots, fact never change. also loss older people. many traditional African cultures, large part cultural heritage transmitted words. story telling old people least important books Western world. collective memory society, people see story tellers cultural treasure. Thinking lose old people story tellers painful. Cheaper rent? Lmk NYC get rid Facebook. sanity thank you. Imagine nurse doctor perform triage admittance. least understand November lockdown ended.


And still issues. others Republicans. Perhaps Japan South Korea two countries Asia resemble western democracies. populations docile complacent course they're gonna institute draconian lockdowns seem done good enough job wiping virus. Yeah, stop wearing masks now, actually diffuse virus even society decided good bad live lives much possible accept consequences actions.

Yeah shit actually affects go crying press think would bad. Hundreds articles like that. mean get first plz? might everyone‚Äôs fear. gotta say still trust species make right permanent changes. Like approach animal products breeding animals must change. really hope get fundamental changes way live make better world descendants I'm leaning towards fomite infection really important, least two days room temperature. that's based one study's results infectious virus concentrations saliva, Chinese outbreaks, one study half-life saliva. much data trillion-dollar problem.

I still troubled many scientists engaged wishful thinking this, selling educated guesses ""scientific"" guidelines billions people. 

This appears Indian firm.   
Ultimately think data come Gamaleya Research Institute team regardless reported. Hey, really bad cough ten years ago. Guess we'll never know... reminds xcd comic. bullet also kill cancer cell. what? someone willing drop $25k Covid shot booster, wouldn‚Äôt hospital accept donation expenses tight?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* fact two variants share several spike mutations - emerging entirely apart lineage, rapidly dominating regions - highly remarkable impossible ignore.

This strong argument, agree. meant patient could decide go, sorry provoking erectile dysfunction? Schools one bigger infection spreaders lots people confined space long period time. comparable football stadiums combined large restaurants crowding public transport age groups. space social distancing classrooms.

It's choice keeping schools open keeping ***lot*** places social distance open. Indeed schools might much faster spreading variants...? Yes, gave dose, leaving us calculate factory claims effective wattage distance.

You test fake products normal paper, however, turns brown UV light. honestly late stopped spread 

That obviously case, since quite number countries stopped spread even covid free. among things, also used temporary travel bans strict quarantine rules international travelers. look Taiwan Australia right now.

(And no, fact Taiwan Australia surrounded sea mean go swimming. use means transport US Europe is, guess what, planes. Oh lord, chuck brains heaven!) find strange assumption across board seems reach herd immunity, that‚Äôs get back normal. NYT article Fauci thinks herd immunity might 85-90 % presumes means need 85-90 % immunity social distancing, masks, restrictions end. 

IMO US least, state govts (even take COVID seriously) eager lift restrictions soon possible, already know cases decline, people generally take COVID seriously become much comfortable resuming normal activities (which probably there‚Äôs cycle surges declines). vulnerable vaccinated deaths stay extremely low, widespread immunity, even we‚Äôre still herd immunity, don‚Äôt see significant restrictions ever coming back, don‚Äôt see people continuing distance mask wherever they‚Äôre forced to. 300,000 (actually 338,000) US, worldwide figure. fact neither mentioned makes think whole sub-thread performative effort rather real discussion.

The world figure 1.76 million rising. Keep ad hominem yourself. Yes Fox News garbage, change fact Vitamin supplementation used preventive measure Covid-19.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, take Vitamin cure Covid-19. governments could easily start Vitamin supplementation program make sure people adequate levels,in order make sure fewer people severe cases Covid-19. People retirement homes often get many cases probably severe Vitamin deficiency might one reason many elderly people severe cases Covid-19.

&amp;#x200B;

Now question why, despite evidence Vitamin deficiency massive factor severe Covid-19 cases, governments inforn time. cheap effective way prevent Covid-19. Maybe exactly problem. Thank basic outgrowth survival fittest; designated ""enemy"". case Covid vs us.

This covid vs covid, infectious strain dominate. Think like Coke vs Pepsi trying market undiscovered Amazon rainforest tribe. virus doesn‚Äôt try kill people. tries replicate. Killing people incidental. Thank lets choose echo chamber. Youtube Facebook build echo chamber. actually significant difference.

Echo chambers bad, whether choose they're chosen you, somehow feel slightly better make own. 


Being recommended slightly radical/reactionary one like force fed company already full. take bite even though want seems like pro-social thing do. bad, later. Repeat go moderate far left/right.

At least personal choice, always starts core values beliefs. That's low numbers. even tests low false positive rate? lab medium, dried, soiled saliva. one tests real world, unfortunately. epidemiological (statistical) data gotten stronger increased transmission. fact two variants, developed entirely apart lineage, rapidly dominating regions highly remarkable impossible ignore.

I haven‚Äôt seen data infection children, can‚Äôt said much confidence point afaik. Need data Well, first of. Nothing objectively worse per definition. Everyone whole individuals, including me. Averages mean everyone. saying since personally problems care others give damn. get from? hardship lot people are. buying spree toilet paper related marsmallow buying spree? March wave hit New York (well there, know). working desk Manhattan felt something rip chest along extreme pain. 

Placed calls, told ""get one cabs front building, time ambulance."" seen heard single one yet. read article know why. Brilliant! diagrams cited study (not yet peer-reviewed) : Someone

Kirk Cameron ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù. old. yes go hug someone wearing good mask without symptoms contact positive. It‚Äôs going worth it, don‚Äôt fundamentalism, save health. California one lockdown heavy, educated humanist societies. could happen there? Correlation causation 

Example: People eat handful nuts day tend healthier. also tend richer afford better health care Shame article say watts per square I'm using, important less give like 10mw inch others give several thousand distance. Also there's hell lot fake uv lights people buying sod all. India strict mask mandate. Ugh makes wanna party alone...*Consumes another 200 mg THC* It‚Äôs almost like self righteous gasping caterwauling people doesn‚Äôt work. 

I don‚Äôt know certain large % people country can‚Äôt understand human beings fundamentally selfish self interested core. Feigning shock outrage people traveling holidays pointless. 

As society decided good bad live lives much possible accept consequences actions. People aren‚Äôt ignorant, need education medical professionals, social media shaming. 

If accept fact full lockdowns, partial lockdowns, extensive government regulations going work, prioritize best mitigation strategies real world is. People make maintain culture wherever are. need church particularly large spike Thanksgiving really contrary claims. Eight flights day landing LA, Detroit, Atlanta, NYC Chicago direct London. Every day. months. Covid bat caves China. 

You sound confident, study hand supports claim? afaik, know covid originated. exhausting watch disaster unfold power stop it. October survey American Nurses Federation, 37% nurses said weren‚Äôt confident vaccines would safe effective.

Let's hope number went least. would particular sad, even lot nurses believe coronavirus vaccines. seems like repetitive bot.  Long time friend mine nurse. Knows reality COVID. We're travel ban here.

Also fall ton holidays bring people together inside. People probably use say lockdowns work. cant really make conclusion one chart though. Compare Sweden Nordic countries might come opposite conclusion. guess also health. Americans necessarily healthiest many obese chronic health problems (high blood pressure, diabetes, etc.). Swedes much lower rate obesity (1/10 Swedes versus 42.4% Americans) generally exercise/bike more. lol know jack shit stuff hear read confirm, I‚Äôm Brazil count hands feets number families know covid death literally day travel There's 3 Chinese cities casual person might familiar beginning 2020.

People know is, they‚Äôre stupid. lazy. Japan South Korea done well.  That's really debatable.  People read without shutting everything down. think testing line it‚Äôs bad omen long testing lines mean cases. UCI medical center, temporary buildings every side, including large field hospital, mobile morgue, sealed tents behind fence erected recent weeks. drive frequently really messed head. hospitals also long lines ambulances (I counted 7 St Joseph hospital last week).
Stay safe. get peak. people getting vaccines natural herd immunity cases, virus rates go üôèüèº pandemic ***WILL*** lead clearer definition ""airborne""

apparently ""in air"" specific enough.

&amp;#x200B;

look measles vs flu.

1 infected person.. 

will give 12-18 people measles

compared 2-3 example, [R0 measles ranges 12 depending factors like population density life expectancy. large R0, mainly measles virus highly infectious.  hand, influenza virus less infectious, [its R0 ranging 2 Influenza, therefore, cause explosive outbreaks measles, persists due ability mutate evade human immune system.

&amp;#x200B;

there diseases need cough face, need feel mist get infected.

&amp;#x200B;

then there's ones spread talking.

&amp;#x200B;

those ""airborne vectors""  flew home family Xmas thanksgiving, fuck you. go back queue vaccine shot. probably think whole thing joke anyway won‚Äôt bother getting one what‚Äôs point. 
Maybe also get denied bed ventilator insurance end ICU. Assholes. December solstice marks arrival first day summer southern hemisphere. That‚Äôs earth‚Äôs southern areas, call summer solstice occur Monday, December 21, hate Meh, really. probably thinking age obesity ignore things like role secondary infections world without antibiotics amount malnourishment existed 1918.

It would accurate say didn‚Äôt comorbidities certain ones would less prevalent, it‚Äôs clear less overall.  trolling somehow avoided hearing googling rationales lockdowns masks? No? Orginally plan 29th. Bowel obstruction horrifying kill you. don‚Äôt stick anything can‚Äôt get out. Thats insightful question. think circumstances billionaire rich selfish jerk, know exactly draw line.

I think really depends condition others. Obviously there's nothing wrong looking family trying give best possible life, look world around you, clear finances light-years ahead literally 99% population... even understand sleep night. much empathy lack everything power bridge wealth gap much money? surprising none great universities Cali like USC, UCLA, Stanford, Berkeley, etc., would done weeks ago. Surely virology research. How‚Äôs Japan rank overall health? Obesity? Diabetes? unhealthy nation. Nursing homes keeping patients alive another weeks pay, state almost 70% deaths nursing homes average age 82. Ok, fortunately concerns dumb majority health-related articles summed eat healthy, exercise. shut down, less death have. individual tolerance acceptable amount death. appears higher many people. thaialt know going stay way. certainly better countries persistent outbreak, Thaialnd many months effectively 0 domestic cases.That thanks quick lockdown early pandemic. Thailand 1000 new cases Samut Sakhon spread country. Maybe Thai people contain again, without heavy handed measures used last time, doubt it. current response looks closer Canada first wave Thailand. name FDA approved vaccines still allow significant levels transmission vaccination? yes, poverty, exactly like choosing ordering large coke fries take stairs. fuq possible one without though? feel one begets sadly. activaxxers vaccinated themselves. kids suffer Thanks insight young one!

Germany dead, something US paid thousands lives shit ton money. I'd contact airline verify them. can't give straight answer want confirmation contact airport Tokyo and/or Japanese customs.

The answer may depend length layover airlines taking. Japan actually terribly first. denial coronavirus spreading wanted summer olympics happen (which ended getting postponed anyways). Japan similar culture like US comes ignorance cover ups. saving grace Japan mask us good like Asia. Close country. Stop open *is* near-normal pretending makes virus propagate, making even less near-normal.

People live war zones get tired everything feeling abnormal go shopping bombs drop around possibly them. difference go shopping, they're potentially hurting they're actively making war worse everyone else.

Humans really awful understanding risks. hell about? Poor people either travel far buy healthy groceries, travel locally get cheap, calorie-dense convenience store food. 

Guess option pick. bunch people stats new covid19. old. think relatively high priority list. Probably ahead dock workers, whose work considered essential, they're less exposed are. Oh, that's stay inside go night doc says vitamin levels fine even though skin approximately snow colored. Scared people drink go church too. pays huh??

The taxpayer?

Yea? Oh. Ok then. right questions.. Mortality numbers Japan lower year 14000 previous one.  ‚ÄúLocked down‚Äù aka hasn‚Äôt allowed tourists since March majority world (rightfully so) even allow foreign residents return lately (not good). There‚Äôs lots videos Kyoto much emptier it‚Äôs tourism mostly dead right now. I'm teaching first graders 100% remotely almost shown growth. kids grown ones show class log in, engage learning all. 

The standard distance learning universal though know plenty schools required bare minimum teachers parents alike. ""virtual home school bullshit"" work, require dedication stake holders child's education. God feel hard. boat. Feeling exact way.

Even fought misinformation online local red necks anti-maskers.

It nothing. I‚Äôm gonna die tired. Croatian story: 0 cases end april...most cases around 90 day days...

Middle summer 300 cases day since opened up...

Middle autumn pre 2nd lockdown 4000~ average cases day weeks...

UK island theory. extremely well connected rest Europe, least given Eurotunnel Irish border.

The death rate tell full story COVID. anything tells beginning. Good point. Golf death legacy. Hi, sorry, allow link shorteners sub -- feel free try re-comment unshortened links! course dystopian nightmare nobody would want live in. 

There many people sub would welcome nightmare stopped COVID. heard impacts mRNA vaccines, sound concerned them, refer back point 2, above. That‚Äôs test runs logistical pieces place. Complete fail. much ignorance comment. Agreed, that's completely rational approach would magnitudes better what's going now. fair point nuance important meet needs. wrong lazy generalized regions within state (e.g. San Diego != LA != rural counties). wrong shut everything (e.g. industries proven operate safely) arbitrarily non essential. point, would also wrong say cancel elective surgeries, namely ones proven low risk share resources ICUs. Instead, surgical approach warranted cases (pun intended), lazy sweeping policy decisions destroying lives. leaders demonstrated refusal unfortunately that's IMO largest contributor are. 9 months gone without suitable strategy. (sorry response turned rant I'll end here!) Korea specifically Asia generally tolerate anti-authoritarian nonsense time.

Serious Critical No, govt didn‚Äôt enough scientific knowledge shut everything big Christmas! Loved seeing everyone! Gonna big New Years party too! No. I'm curious harmed mask indoor public venue 750 people venue instead 1500? ""shutting society"" anyon'e definition. It‚Äôs Independence Day. sounds like different groups people different cultures, worse others regarding different behaviors society. Oh yes means, take newborn baby 12+ hour flight, country don‚Äôt speak language. Awesome idea. Yeah don‚Äôt prevent EVERY flu death even vaccine that‚Äôs stupid. People die viruses, can‚Äôt stop every death futile. waste year. purposely got infected March talking ""immunity passports,"" I've done since then. many racist salarymen cummed death link blood donation requirements Red Cross: ask appointment, give blood, confirm you‚Äôre eligible probably prevent 100k-200k flu deaths year vaccination efforts. US oppositional defiant disorder child. We‚Äôve defying authority little shits since dumped tea harbor. US YOLO approach pandemic . bought wide range vaccines we‚Äôd enough even multiple don‚Äôt end working/safe. majority purchased vaccines still ones ready yet apply american military aswell? Yeah feel way. 

Some people don‚Äôt. Society won‚Äôt distance long term effects, like literally 0 chance. fly tomorrow afternoon far news stories mayor Guayaquil parking vans runway, beginning pandemic gotten ominous emails American Airlines. I'm little nervous still think plane tomorrow afternoon. 

I visited friends Belgium 2011 going drive Tuscany Brugge. super excited friend VW van could slept in. ended taking Ryan Air. still blast drive would experience lifetime. Where's data again? UK shut outbound travels emerging COVID variant? don‚Äôt understand difficult ban global travel, especially early phases sufficient knowledge discovered it. still game phone.

Frickin' Madagascar... You‚Äôre idiot. first Covid case reported America January 19th 21st. One two. trump banned travel China 31st. 10 days after. time, knowledge everyone had, China hot spot biggest threat. need ban everyone. liberal argument retarded completely irrational. It‚Äôs rooted already biased hatred trump irrational. Anything does, matter true intentions, it‚Äôll spun racist, immoral, inhumane. could spend millions save poor kids Venezuela liberals like ‚ÄúOMG GAVE TRILLIONS PREDOMINANTLY BLACK COUNTRY! HATES BLACK PEOPLE‚Äù. That‚Äôs textbook, mainstream liberal  Masks distancing 2022 hurts one? baiting Wonder Woman beaming. doesn‚Äôt even make sense?? virus preventable, transmission impossible, people aren‚Äôt immortal.

It‚Äôs like saying every flu death preventable never said was, also dead Problem since enforcement anything like paper trail citations illegal partying maskless shopping etc. could pulled court record search prevent violators lying conduct. 

This pandemic gone long enough state legislature could actually passed laws like teeth (at least states like California heavily lopsided legislatures) instead relying executive orders covid mitigation. India playing Australia Australia currently? special provision sports? Even Pakistan cricket team playing New Zealand New Zealand. Sri Lanka currently playing South Africa South Africa. England intends play Sri Lanka Sri Lanka quarantining there. literally cloudy fuck though, lol?
Like less 1/20th Swedish population less 1h sun daily lmao. suspect satire, case aren't:

* versions vaccine use inactivated virus;
* versions use messenger RNA ""teach"" immune system COVID looks like without exposure;
* versions use protein subunit, essentially purified viral cells;
* versions use virus-like particles. I'm dude one talking anything shutting manner. Without mandate, individual strife globally irrelevant. optimism unfounded. said ""complete lockdown"" we're talking about.

I say mini-lockdowns worth it, completely locking virus gone aka least another 6 months terrible idea.

Lots mini lockdowns right middle ground. seize assets declare bankruptcy? take whatever left bank account? I've never understood exactly work. seems like way debt almost scot free? USA lifted lgbt ban? Except well established things conducted move forward...has established months now. info science based hurts one. Society won‚Äôt shut long term effects, I‚Äôm sorry trying manage expectations dude Except (along millions others) allowed donate blood lived UK/Europe 90‚Äôs. temporarily relaxed rules due Covid people still excluded.

The rule mad cow (CJD) outbreak UK. reason US maintains CJD despite hundreds people die year (death rate proportional UK). Also despite fact zero actual evidence showing blood transmission.

As child excited give blood adult. get stopped racist administrators US finally came age. approval decided evaluation benefits outweighing potential risks. Astra Zeneca officially still phase 3, competitors, interim analysis produced efficacy 62-90% depending dosage.

Astra Zeneca recently announced cooperation Russian Gamaleya Institute determine efficacy vaccine combinations assess safety vaccines. ever South American country? cold AF Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, etc...during Winter months. Yes. available everyone? proportion get amount vaccines rest EU. simply enough vaccines meet target unless Slovakia done separate deals know something countries know. means, would love see happening, remain skeptical. Japan western nation. Accountability cultural issues comes within country, externally save embargoes. one going embargo Japan strict border policy (they already strict immigration policies, declining population, nothing bad happens externally) really care. thing travel ban make life expats poor people miserable. Rich businessmen come go please, questions asked.

Ciao, enjoy superiority complex. feel it‚Äôs state, everyone else think way? exact selfishness i‚Äôm referring to. pissed people running around continuing spread shit 10 months. doctors struggling keep day day people can't take personal responsibility. Seeing thousands people dead fucking livid high horse fucking huge.

It would one thing contagious. Fuck go take risks bother me. family getting sick homes can't walk fridge anymore breath yeah I'm fucking mad. Definitely much lower. expect much mandates place distancing masking reach close zero transmission, gain better understanding long term effects. think still see overabundance condition restrictions little while. definitely get much better pretty quickly going forward though. Maybe maybe African Union responded well proved yet bias dollar buys cheap coffee point regardless new info ‚Äúinfo‚Äù garbage hurts everybody reason said realistically thought imo forget /s ?  /u/razortwinky one gets like baby leave there! one two ships refitted Portland drydock operational long time. Yes undeniable rushed typical approvals process, normally takes 7-10 years. entirely new technology nonetheless. seeing side effects surprising. 

In fact CDC saying _expect_ side effects: hospitalized according reports, I've read 3% longer able function normally shot. supposed get multiple boosters well, mRNA shot basically gene therapy rather typical vaccination builds antibodies. ""government"" fucking invented vaccine see you‚Äôve never encountered German woman‚Äôs elbows queue before. pandemic cavitadaxia whole new monster I‚Äôve struggled wrangle. continent used dealing pandemics

WHY DESTROYED PANDEMIC!? /s racist unlikely learn humility this, enjoy threads like it'll hopefully help point. worries all- stay safe Except vaccine making rounds, speak.

What infect someone works nursing home brings in, killing thirty people-- three months, they'd shots fine? could literally play FF1 single fighter chose too. 

Iv played many recent FF games kinda dropped around X-2 yeah games beaten single character still show cutscenes dont need alive combat. 

I played diablo 3 whole thing party super hot adventures witty banter eachother whilst murder bads. 

Im sure JRPG's need companions progress, Iv hit point one iv played yet, Maybe like persona games? havent played those, cant bring life sim bits. Iv beat first 5 dragon quests single guy, digimon games single mon (at time), Pokemon single mon outside HM users dont consider companions cant consider HM slaves. 

Im honestly sure RPG's talking must keep full party healthy alive progress game. suppose, think killing international travel period reducing interstate travel must travel work would allowed less restrictions hopefully restrictions effective. 

There still seems issues people traveling US states less restrictions ‚Äútake break‚Äù going state without quarantining. 

I know wouldn‚Äôt popular, would way least try power thing actually get ROI restrictions Agreed. never indicated should. indicate info measures long term new info. never actually made personal statement feel distancing. made reassuring comment (at least intended be) definition distancing change stated comments make masking. stated reason. never indicated family situation anything anyone else's preferences. Yeah, totally get it. lot unknowns since started seems like starting figure everything out... BOOM! new COVID variation. 

As far allowed back States, I'd say nothing worry about. concern, however, whether flight cancelled. would definitely talk airline see know anything. 

Regarding story, thanks lol.. mean ramble souch, guess thought long stop typing haha Lockdowns masking positive negative effect spread overall. produce short-term reduction followed short-term increase, nothing. Found stoner. totally misunderstood general idea plans, thanks clearing up. mystery. 

Most African countries extremely busy points international entry + domestic travel common domestic travel Western countries. 

The virus never made worst parts continent virus carrier ever traveled there.  Lmao fuck def didnt make heard somewhere else never checked. Thanks bruh wish instead vaccine would inject weakened version virus prepare immune system real thing. way hell I'm getting vaccinated though. ‚ÄúCONCLUSION risk infection COVID-19 appears reduced half among current smokers. intriguing finding may reveal unique infection mechanisms present COVID-19 may targeted combat disease reduce infection saying smoking good lungs Covid seems like either. ... *they* refers refrigerated trailers.

I‚Äôve donated different mobile location time felt safe time. 

If good candidate blood donation please consider becoming regular donor. difference we‚Äôll widespread vaccinations vaccinations high-risk. Death rates incredibly low mid-2021. stroke their, buddy? Frankly, long Johnson &amp; Johnson's one dose vaccine works, I'm good. 100 million doses 100 million people. look Bloomberg data, see states like California last updated data December 21. fair take state's first 2021 update know whether reached 20 million take CDC's first 2021 might states last updating week prior. We're built it. Modern Americans built deal helping others. Alex Jones told government conspiracy believe him. There‚Äôs point ‚Äúemotional intelligence‚Äù described pushes beyond reason. case that. makes lot sense tracking strains describe country origin. 

The way take slight emotionally immature. Unless, course, someone willfully using country origin cast sort blanket statement people therein. reasonable people, country origin nothing people inside everything tracking strain first identified snd able define difference multiple strains quickly.

Any reasonable person would able discern I‚Äôm saying ‚Äúwuhan coronavirus‚Äù describe strain discussing im saying ‚ÄúChina flu‚Äù order diminish people.

You seem unable discern two, deem ‚Äúemotional intelligence‚Äù really emotional immaturity.  I‚Äôm Asian grew whole SARS thing kick started whole mask wearing practice. It‚Äôs common warmer Asian countries it‚Äôs unheard either. people act like mask wearing scandal? I'm sorry hear that. hard really know well going parts world, wish going better. supposed go buy UV lamps based state wattage actual dose what's relevant scientific findings? nobody making read it. like scientific studies read them.
If want something use practice wait months years manufacturers sell product based findings. good post. I'm dumb simplified numbers like helpful assume agree every Western country told citizens masks necessary? Maybe government done called hoax. competent government like rest developed world, people could stay home live stimulus. ‚ÄúPeople work‚Äù complete fallacy. money there, they‚Äôre incompetent stuck Cold War mentality. Happy oblige. start. Community transmission problem UD imported cases. try stop new strain almost certainly already US plus lots countries unless gor incoming flights anywhere kinda pointless now. (Hank Hill beer sip) yep. Well said. opinion, given water example, seems like huge part problem someone making money providing water, essential human life. Obviously someone spend large amount money order masses access water. It'd great done kindness, unfortunately someone wants return investment. Understandable, seems like massive flaw. return never enough. Stupid consumers paying premium water problem, think blame shifted companies marketing premium water options. Would demand advertising? unnecessary high end sure far off. Herman Cain hung month.

I surprised still seeing Christmas deaths first week February. universally accepted people Covid stop contagious 10-14 days begin showing celebrate both. really started believe population control rumors. makes sense. knew happening China allowed people fly in, countries borders open weeks! cant stupidity best educated. agenda cant stupid. I'd almost swear sort coordinated campaign steer dialog pertaining origins spread According world health organization restricting travel ‚Äúpointless‚Äù ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù lonely right sometimes. think alot focus learned 2020. leading edge noted early pandemic spread air travel generally afluent people bringing hot spots. current process bus truck operating local loops chaining together. could sort ground swell underlying infection taking would suggest inward wave coastal edges appears slowly happening exception DRC middle higher air transit intermediary neighbors lower associated economies. Words can't describe feeling seeing headline headline countries obtaining vaccine. contrast sick feeling dread watched play countries around world began reporting first infections. Hoping really beginning end. think big issue science trusted much information vaccine provided. I‚Äôm Russian whenever Russians behave ‚Äúlook first!‚Äù (Putin‚Äôs announcement vaccine approved) makes think something little stinky. Also understand biotech friends Russia fairly tight lip methods research science world casts doubt things.

That said yes, organization self world renowned, Russian always wish we‚Äôd stop breaking knee caps credibility information games play. Cell phone use too. Stop that, y'all.. headline article acted faster better. blindly partisan conservative hack need refuse read even headline? EDC scheduled May Nevada government signed it. They‚Äôll rapid tests otherwise plan hold it. Yes death isn‚Äôt metric, mental health, nutrition, learning loss, socialization, pretty damn important right? nice, wholesome story. visited Romania once, think nice place live in. Even muslims can‚Äôt come country? That‚Äôs pretty racist Except someone like immune compromised chooses go gym. Oh trust lot dumbasses demanding Facebook groups, majority us want money industry survive. We‚Äôve received 0 help this. companies know work received PPP loans save stages act still hasn‚Äôt passed it‚Äôs looking like government would rather shut help. I‚Äôm sound guy started socially distanced/mandatory mask/outdoor shows great able earn money again, cancelled shows cause one coming (cause wants spend money go large gatherings deadly global pandemic one money?). I‚Äôve worked 2 days month December nothing calendar January unemployment ran November. I‚Äôm ok position, many friends co-workers move back home danger losing housing lost housing already. We‚Äôre always first ones building, last ones out, we‚Äôre first close, last open help. Science says otherwise : even masks made clothes good enough stop droplets. people don‚Äôt understand masks don‚Äôt protect efficiently wearer, protect people, efficiency directly proportional number people wearing them. I‚Äôm tired linking studies explain efficient masks are, we‚Äôre far enough pandemic simple google search give several links explaining masks work how. may throwing gas fire state open forum but...Home birth criminal. personally know one man severe mental disability mom decided home birth something easily dealt hospital setting led oxygen deprivation resulting life debilitated complications. wife would died, times, mother would survived. Home birth romantic version fed nonsense. one look death rate mothers 20th century see unnecessary risk and, besides invention vaccine, lowering probably modern medicines‚Äô greatest achievement. 

We wouldn‚Äôt let mother play Russian roulette baby that, opinion, home births are. Africans dark skinned get much vitamin sunlight. Actually children flu higher CFR COVID Straws everywhere restaurant service industry. people would wear mask public, restaurant take eat, could still restaurants open safely, maybe 1/2 capacity indoors outdoor seating spread out. Along cooperation contact tracing mass testing, well. 

But, ""Muh freedom"" anti-science, alt-news caucus got way too. really see would different terms herd immunity. No, wrong. People send kids low risk kids tremendous benefit in-person learning. God, people fucking clueless topic.  keep hearing end year thinking ways rest year going look calendar realize less week out.

The vaccine news coming exponentially faster feels like reverse last year. nice. didn't. like parents prefer healthy alive. That‚Äôs happened state neighboring ones open death infection rate. governor basically said go pound sand, licking us down. Get well soon Greg! anyone chastising re: mask wearing... golf.

Thank you, Atlantic Monthly. That‚Äôs good then, wonder 5 percent people got coronavirus since it‚Äôs 95 percent effective. guess it‚Äôs soon tell ""Herd immunity work either, antibodies last long enough."" - link studies confirming this. seems extremely unlikely. bet bunch Americans lost health insurance might contributing sales. Looks like stop issuing new visas though. stopped issuing visas April (I think) October. got visa approved Wednesday think barely made it.

Hardly anyone lives Sweden. tiny country, really relevant metric unless want compare small state US. far distribution vaccine running 10x jabs, said 3 days ago 9.5 million already distributed looks really good too. mRNA vaccines much faster manufacture traditional vaccines.

Doctors treating new flood critically ill [coronavirus treatments [the keep patients alive send home sooner.

Last spring, less known disease, doctors often pre-emptively put patients ventilators gave powerful sedatives largely abandoned recent years. aim save seriously ill protect hospital staff Covid-19.

Now hospital treatment critically ill looks like pandemic. Doctors hold longer placing patients ventilators. Patients get less powerful sedatives, doctors checking frequently see halt drugs entirely dialing back much air ventilators push patients‚Äô lungs breath.

‚ÄúLet us go back basics,‚Äù said Dr. Eduardo Oliveira, executive medical director critical-care services AdventHealth Central Florida, recommends doctors stick pre-pandemic guidelines ventilator use. ‚ÄúThe less deviate it, better.‚Äù

Advances also include new drugs, notably steroids, severely ill patients.

As U.S. surge stretches winter, hospital ICUs seeing record numbers Covid-19 cases. Even effective treatment, high volume required record number ventilators U.S. last week, according Covid Tracking Project data.

Vaccines began distribution U.S. last week, shots Americans remain months away. disease killed 1.68 million world-wide, according Johns Hopkins University.

Last spring, doctors put patients ventilators partly limit contagion time less clear virus spread, protective masks gowns short supply. Doctors could employed kinds breathing support devices don‚Äôt require risky sedation, early reports suggested patients using could spray dangerous amounts virus air, said Theodore Iwashyna, critical-care physician University Michigan Department Veterans Affairs hospitals Ann Arbor, Mich.

At time, said, doctors nurses feared virus would spread hospitals. ‚ÄúWe intubating sick patients early. patients‚Äô benefit, order control epidemic save patients,‚Äù Dr. Iwashyna said ‚ÄúThat felt awful.‚Äù

Ventilators injure lungs causing much strain machines force air. deliver air oxygen throat tube, body typically fights. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got gag reflexes pretty hard go away, precisely avoid things going lungs,‚Äù Dr. Iwashyna said.

As safety precaution, doctors hospitals limited access health-care workers coronavirus patients ventilators, giving fewer opportunities check them. meant patients required powerful sedatives keep pulling throat tubes. Sedation increases risk delirium, [research delirium increases likelihood long-term confusion death.

Subsequent research found alternative devices ventilators, delivering oxygen nasal tubes, weren‚Äôt risky caretakers believed. Doctors also gained experience Covid-19 patients, learning spot signs might suddenly turn seriously ill, said.

###### Close threat

When pandemic first overwhelmed hospitals China Italy, doctors questioned whether Covid-19 would require new treatment approaches. Better understanding severely ill coronavirus patients respiratory distress increased confidence similar enough patients infections rely pre-pandemic guidelines ventilators, according doctors hospitals.

Doctors AdventHealth Central Florida use computers select treatment options, Covid-19 patients, system added options calibrate ventilators using longstanding protocols, Dr. Oliveira said.

The computerized guides helped spread use pre-pandemic treatment options, amount air push lungs per breath, across 20 hospitals emergency rooms, Dr. Oliveria said.

Nashville-based [HCA Inc., one largest hospital chains U.S., went step further. Doctors get alert computers patients aren‚Äôt getting ventilator treatment might benefit them. company rolled alerts June. Afterward, compared treatment outcomes similar patients alerts. found doctors follow pre-pandemic protocols, reduced number deaths shortened time patients spend ventilators, HCA‚Äôs chief medical officer said.

Overall, survival Covid-19 patients increased 28% April September HCA hospitals, though company didn‚Äôt break figures ventilated patients. Doctors use judgment ignore alerts patient conditions make medically necessary, company said.

Researchers doctors continue study Covid-19 patients require ventilators, experts called flexibility pre-pandemic standards doctors decide calibrate ventilators. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs personalization, that‚Äôs key word,‚Äù said John Marini, professor medicine University Minnesota. ‚ÄúGuidelines guidelines.‚Äù

Before pandemic, 30% 40% ventilator patients died, according research. Numbers sharply higher pandemic‚Äôs early hot spot Wuhan, China. pandemic grew, hospitals U.S. reported death rates cases 50% ventilated Covid-19 patients.

One study three New York City hospitals found death rate Covid-19 patients dropped 7.6% 25.6% March August accounting younger, healthier patients summer. Hospitals New York less crowded August April surge, could increase mortality, study‚Äôs authors wrote October Journal Hospital Medicine. study also suggests patients may benefited new medications improved treatment, said.

Gains treatment may diminish prolonged Covid-19 surge doctors nurses overwhelmed hospitals must keep visitors, said E. Wesley Ely, professor Vanderbilt School Medicine, studies risks intensive-care treatment, include neurological damage physical disability. Overextended doctors may use heavy sedation ICU teams can‚Äôt closely monitor ventilated patients, Dr. Ely said. America literally exact thing.

I love this, ""cannae."" can't even really explain why... really like it.  Hey man Christmas, leave politics. BS. experience versus all.

Oh no. Happened son Thomas Tank engine. got first vaccine today. Thanks, Dr Fauci Selfishness lack empathy dehumanising. Acting like intelligent species times crisis enable better future. Sometimes make sacrifices far greater good. thought bubbler water fountain milwaukee?

Now could lead ""vaccine passports."" lockdowns restrictions continue, incentive getting vaccine becomes less less. So, order access society, proof vaccination. Everyone grasp Econ knows lockdowns worse disease I'm sure cost would go lot compared simple melt blown cheap polypro. lockdown risk. 

I don‚Äôt understand that‚Äôs problem. you‚Äôre risk, want avoid vulnerable people. 

This whole country taken crazy pills made quit EMS, realized vast majority population really gave zero shits healthcare.

Yea really gotta love surgery it. chose lifestyle money went family medicine, although salaries (relatively) low, work 35 hour weeks want know there‚Äôs whole country live in? can‚Äôt afford live there, move. That‚Äôs rest problem I‚Äôll admit public opinion poll data...But way type data using...


And also disagree strongly assessment people arrogant stupid make decisions personal risk tolerance...

I‚Äôm exact opposite politically would expect someone plan taking vaccination...and view global warming biggest threat humans scientists tell so...

But also tell since I‚Äôm 34 get Covid almost assuredly going minor. also say expect rough 24 hours get vaccine 2nd shot...

Since actual disease seems worse vaccine, I‚Äôve yet see compelling reason take time day...twice...to get it...

I however, seen biggest cheerleader vaccine admit lying...which doesn‚Äôt help cause getting people like vaccinated...  funny didn‚Äôt laugh Unless someone danger imminent death, would Uber Lyft in.

That's trying say. you‚Äôre looking place afford house California last place want go. guy saying okay stop wearing mask vaccinated personally. safe sex COVID infected boyfriend hits back wear masks? Probably not. Even countries less regulation (like Russia) one challenge trials. Applying Med school 4+ year process, like going military nearly time 

Very true. happen change mind apply med school next week. started lying February/March, told us masks work. never really tried whole ""tell truth"" thing... People talked kind strangely back then. something taught pretty early school. also imagine expect people nitpick words phrasing attempt depraved citizens rights.

""I ask, sir, militia? whole people, except public officials."" (George Mason, 3 Elliot, Debates 425-426)  ü§£ü§£ü§£üëåüëå Oh, want small military.

Stupid fuck. Sounds like communist propoganda think undercounting, probably fair say testing. Google says house purchase 1 reason. like said: debt unless buy Fancy house can't afford (or apparently according Google, investment highest debts Denmark concentrated within highest income households) saw Reuters article post correction well. first nation.

 ::rolleyes:: Yeah nearly doubled. Oof. I've heard investment bankers work tough hours, man oh man surgeons easy either. Easily one worst rotations medical trainee, think put ~105 hour work week full number? heard still lag ""Voice coaches hate him"" means lot! wish did. militia people, time phrase ""well-regulated"" meant properly functioning. ""Well regulated clock"" example. he's faking ultimate dad joke. scientific method knowingly lying mask efficacy herd immunity? Even back early March people knew high R0 needs high threshold herd immunity. lie? kid love Bluey picking Australian words pronunciations. totally could see happening Peppa Pig. billing system sociopaths gone wild patient unloaded someone dies.

That's something happened within ten days so. I‚Äôm department chair medical school applications definitely up. course good applications steady. number meeting minimums up. Good applicants things outlined, feels like borderline students deciding give whirl.

Maybe that's depression talking really bad. beat shit piece shit, nobody else see piece shit. /r/ScottishPeopleTwitter little bit nuanced every student resident costs lot money train. trained public system sure private systems differ, despite sky high tuitions part cost training still subsidized government/school/etc. Increasing number spots difficult overnight without significant funding

In addition money aspect, also infrastructure limitations obvious classroom/lab space limits. Another example recently came hospital ran call rooms medical students literally way make rooms without physically expanding hospital. would cost good chunk money (from government case) Big boomy boi know draw conclusion let's go nonsense, 1.4 billion chinese, different person, lumping altogether surely smart thing do. tell would think like that, innately think chinese people, think ants, behaving functioning way.

If go ‚Äúbad‚Äù law school, depending tier, top 5-25% you‚Äôll still get lucrative stable employment. Geography also factor.

But point generally pretty true, unfortunately. good networking skills connections finagle something. economy fucks firms turn, fucks law students young attorneys. anyone would able get situation last Bloomberg update accurate, 20k (or 50%!!!!) increase 2-3 days. wonder might wowed CDC tracker updates next.

I agree. Let‚Äôs that. seems like real problem worth addressing.

But let‚Äôs not
Bullshit burger eating caused COVID. Bc didn‚Äôt. yes, let‚Äôs sickly vegans! like guys look like might keel Nobody needs stigmatizing you. simply idiot. previous comment regarding young &amp; needing vaccine iggnorant blatantly misinformed. Ok realize Covid infects ages. Also Covid 19 effects even survive. Like blood clots, brain aneurysms, lung damage, chronic fatique &amp; whole host nasty side effects. Even asymtomatic people didnt even feel really sick. Dude give head shake. Also youre young, could still catch &amp; infect others. would feel knew caught &amp; killed relative anyone selfish accidently caused others get ill. clearly dont believe masks vaccines much better alternative getting infectious disease thats killed countless people across globe. Oh somehow special? youre brat needs reality check... get real.. Wear fucking mask, adhere safety restrictions safety others. Otherwise fuck &amp; write idiot tatood forehead. allergic fish (not shellfish, fish). allergy potentially fatal..when eat little bit fish, throat gets itchy irritated. eat lot, throat swells becomes hard breathe. 

Will able get vaccine?

I keep hearing allowing people food allergies, specifically seafood allergies, take it. that's okay, disagree internet X) actual numbers phrasing suspect, ie ""frequency""...

Like 100% million infected, dead, individuals developed mental illness, 1% reminding population developed mental illness, population 300+mil, that's 3 million (triple total infected sample). yes, occurred much frequently among infected individuals, number still pales comparison uninfected developed mental illness despite lower frequency. correlation, youre eating bat, eating meat contributing poor slaughter house workers meat packers. enjoy burger! That's reassuring, thanks. Lockdowns doomed beginning.

The problem people get virus cold symptoms days fine. can‚Äôt expect people stop living life months end. frank, nobody gives fuck frail grandparent immunocompromised relative. governors health experts realized piled problem.

The insurance system incentivized surplus beds level accommodate seasonal surging beds available, hospital capture revenue. marginal increase construction maintenance costs supported non-pandemic surges. 
Other countries state funded healthcare excess capacity part serve generate revenue. 
Pure guess, would bet construction costs add extra beds higher per bed countries. there‚Äôs correlation associating COVID red meat consumption (broadly) bull crap.

The ends protecting vulnerable lives illness, suffering, possible death (that 300k citizens' families grieving holiday time)? means wearing piece fabric face public staying 6 feet apart? 

I see losing human lives something simple ever justified. wear mask, stay 6 feet away. ethical conundrum.

I mean - sorry can‚Äôt believe know people mild Covid doesn‚Äôt make lie bc don‚Äôt like it. Varies province. right leaning ones keep cutting healthcare funding (ahem Alberta). 

My mother law works family doctor. beaurocracy takes much time seeing patient. covid, doctor clean room patients, get paid cleaning time. even buy PPE government sent November. And, first groups receiving healthcare workers (those likely catch virus) elderly (the group likely hospitalized/die virus). good news roll vaccine strategically, sharpest drop hospitalizations deaths occur early phases vaccine rollout, that's good everyone. Brilliant. Anti-virals desperately needed. Please work. think Moderna said reduce transmission, know Pfizer.  Since May 12, example, initial explosion New York started subside, Texas 25,947 deaths. New York 9954 deaths. states bad. That's fucking embarrassing sickening.

You get outpace New York 3-1 deaths 7 months point finger them. LA county population density low contains miles miles empty desert, mountains forests. habitated areas pretty dense.

We could find cure COVID tomorrow people would still hand wring we're never going back normal. months saying wait vaccine normal life. 95% effective vaccine somehow good enough. 

The goal post moving going prolong make things worse. Saying things like we're never going back normal make people reluctant take vaccine.

Governments Business's unlikely allow vaccine hesitancy impact return normal. either mandatory want work refuse. let shit drag people refuse get vaccinated. 


Mask wearing social distancing going become normal Unite States. Pundits always overestimate average persons memory.

Earlier year, USS Comfort came help relieve stress hospitals. understanding many actually went there.

It would seem could really useful now...but isn‚Äôt around. gives?  speaking someone who‚Äôs taken ambulance (and paramedic)

It‚Äôs definitely possible need ambulance stable enough wait 8 hours. took one shattered knee pretty bad couldn‚Äôt walk bend leg. would impossible sit car, really even get one rather far away. 

And yes admittance priority, seen immediately didn‚Äôt wait ER waiting room. 

This prepandemic though. Saving that, thanks!  Yeah would best would require actual response trump admin way go! Well bring good point. Oooo sound crazy wowwwwww that's got.

And TRUMP I'm sure sounds completely sane. LOL. 

We country facts rationale = crazy Trump conspiracy theories = truth. Ok, cool. Honestly sound crazy. imagine feels like third world country see news vaccine rollout west yet country hasn‚Äôt even begun putting orders whatsoever. preview pic.... pink contraption? LOL, you‚Äôre triggered replied twice.

What would like us source you? many people Nigeria? geographical location said country? name country confusing you? vulnerable populations vaccinated, deaths gonna drop like rock. Looking forward it! family friend works nursing home getting vaccine next week!!  know sounds cynical, think old person great insurance goes lot people. 

* proof, expect it. Maybe I'm cynical. LA huge place every part maintains level diligence. Imagine lot us worried future present, nothing time really address

We dread day may hear hostile mutation ups death rate couple percentage points, ofc, that. dont know, thats part gets least face vaccines available China months it‚Äôs purely voluntary, cost 150 dollars get. since basically covid cases China now, nobody taking it. loan, pay back payday loan rates. telling him/her personal experience life gotten it. reassuring, god knows none us need worry anymore necessary. 

But guess vote let worry dad probably deaths door. really psychologically unwell. McLennan County. either. care?

Exactly. I'm sure think unique Severity covid patients linked darker ethnicities, yes correct. yet determined. could due differentiation melanin, im thinking likely due tending unfortunately lower income ethnicities. Lower income may mean poorer diet turn overall health, one may able afford preventative care comes remaining healthy especially later years. yes case severity seems worse poc, hospital work ive noticed seems high severity directly linked Hispanics, even certain families see multiple severe cases even deaths among family unit. third world developing countries really fear idea true staggering deaths dealing with. sad. Also, write inspirational book. church purchase bulk. Charge congregants minimal fee books materials ‚Äúteach‚Äù said book. state supposed business keeping religious organizations going broke.

If initial earnings go directly church, could get more, suggestion quick-n-dirty easily. Compare pay RN UK USA tell likely think is. covid deaths excess deaths excess deaths? Either way, damn. vast majority reddit. haven‚Äôt able show jawline 9 months. C‚Äômon! least son later show great Christmas.

I literally talk every single day. thing rona took hope itself.

Stay son. Things rough, things hopefully take turn better 2021. clearly looked much. Covid long term effects, case didnt know. Debilitating life threating side effects. Even asymtomic people, young people. Anybody survives could protentially life long illnesses free stay dumb dude. putting life direct danger. means. Go it. end ventilator debilitating long term effects. We'll see funny think then. Super helpful. quit can't educate people fast enough replace them? didn‚Äôt Russian covid scientist ‚Äòjump‚Äô death balcony recently? I‚Äôll stick vodka. almost people would still alive today hadn‚Äôt caught Covid. point graph trying deceive people thinking comorbidities killed virus. difference? 

Additionally, half Americans hypertension based new lowered standard. died infected BP 130/80 normally, clearly BP killed you, right. SMH. Haachama made back right time. RACIST!!!!! /s knew fact saved twenty people getting sick, one dying five long-term side effects, would feel then? think understand math works. best comment COVID ever read Reddit. public health officials, level (perhaps even consciously) want prolong crisis long possible. see end horizon know return irrelevancy soon. Civilization always ambient background noise illness-related deaths. spent lives anomalous period relative good health that‚Äôs come end.

The 2020 status quo, millions die disease every year, basically humans always lived with. long term, it‚Äôs worth ending civilization restricting individual liberty minimize disease risk. lives lost worth cost exacts living. eradication COVID, it‚Äôs even possible, worthy goal requires indefinite restrictions.

You‚Äôre free disagree me, vote politicians agree me, voters. restrictions, enacted politicians, won‚Äôt persist beyond mass vaccination. Yep. think see range prices - $500-1000/month super high end stuff.  $200/mo pretty standard around (we're hour outside Philadelphia) family medicine practice. really great - doctor patients actually keep track health. What? doesn't. said benefit seems happen 2 weeks first dose. figure cited says diverge 2 weeks after. Obviously accumulating antibodies average entire course 14 days, detectable large scale controlled trial day 14. People obviously start developing immune response immediately. Whether immune response overcome infection different every person dependent upon strong exposure ie many viral particles. cumulative incidence curve all-available efficacy population Dose 1, 
(Figure 2), COVID-19 disease onset appears occur similarly BNT162b2 placebo 
groups approximately 14 days Dose 1, time point, curves diverge, 
more cases accumulating placebo group BNT162b2 group, 
appear evidence waning protection follow-up time approximately 2 months 
following second dose evaluated point time.

Average symptom onset interesting aspect considered I'm sure plays much part. ones. frontline worker, received email employer last week saying received 0 vaccines government. pretty depressing. much hope vaccines, watch healthcare workers zero contact suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients receive vaccine me. actually blame Whitmer figuring fight psychotic traitor trump?

That truly bullshit. maybe they'd go back [Edo period ]( )permanently thought study showing caucasians susceptible virus? That‚Äôs probably happen. restrictions lifted majority vulnerable groups vaccinated, month two vaccine it‚Äôs available general public, we‚Äôll go back pre-covid normal part. I‚Äôm commenting law school easier apply prepare medical school. You‚Äôre mischaracterizing reply. original commenter mentioned law school applications up, (in addition med school apps up); I‚Äôm commenting law school pipeline personal experience saying isn‚Äôt response pandemic either. focus difficulty (no kidding? Med School harder? /s) I‚Äôm focusing feasibility. 

ex: Let‚Äôs say took February 2020 LSAT (which would started preparing latest early December 2019, also ignoring many take February 2020 LSAT previously failed October 2019 LSAT, digress), would register latest early January 2020 (so pre-pandemic West), wouldn‚Äôt get results least month. could conceivably race apply law schools, many schools may late apply. 

If take June 2020 October 2020 LSAT, you‚Äôre waiting year year half law school starts (Fall 2021). Also, schools worth going (T25 better), much rigorous application interview process ‚Äòol shithole. school every LSAT score unfortunately exploitive people really shouldn‚Äôt going law school. 

I never said entering med school easier law school. saying entering law school short enough timeline you‚Äôd see uptick due pandemic (or ‚Äúfauci effect‚Äù). Yes, I'm aware doctors discriminate. made think support that? still fucking illegal lose license it. anything proposing - legal, systematic eugenics. peoples imprudent travel nothing stupidity. best shows major lack maturity self control. 

USPS crippled trump administration. think crap election suddenly fixed itself? That‚Äôs issue. issue transmission. it‚Äôs truly spreading fast is, overrun healthcare system. result higher mortality rate, even biologically it‚Äôs effectively equivalent respect disease causes. article specifically says ‚ÄúCOVID-19 caused infection new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) flu caused infection influenza viruses.‚Äù clearly states different types viruses. every source I‚Äôve found online. 
 
Do credible sources claim beyond ‚Äúthe picture looks Wikipedia?‚Äù genuinely would like know I‚Äôm wrong here. Much factually wrong understand comment all. ""Those would give essential Liberty, purchase little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty Safety.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Nothing difficult, therefore precious, able decide."" Obviously referring less 50% Americans, takes. lump us fuckheads. finally getting cold southern states. Tennessee, Arizona, Georgia, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama hospitalizations higher summer peaks. Texas hospitalization hit new high within week. Rugged individualism /s course not.

This highly contagious disease. 

It's simply contagious winter. want go concert bad. Even much lower could live self killed parents.. likely government refused far back Feb/March restrict travel outside country. Even world watch Italy struggle. government fucks implementing proper shutdown safety citizens, option say fuck expose everyone? Based percentage net worth given Bill Gates charity. He's best example come with, still good one. Funny say that.

There one confirmed COVID case family, guy's police officer, supports outgoing president.

I'm saying didn't, put money it, think diligent mask wearing all.

Bob, reading this, still love you, hear end awhile. Yes anecdotal evidence supersedes actual studies USA bad! Japan bizarre countries Covid deaths. 25 deaths/m among lightest shutdowns world, despite among oldest densest countries. Well bunch people thread sent scientific studies exact issue saying spread significant schools, got Wikipedia page different virus. 
Saying spread significant schools mean ""never close schools"" there's lot community spread make way schools. science pointing towards schools main points spread, despite popular belief. agree lot restrictions don‚Äôt make sense everywhere. may everything happen quickly woefully unprepared. 

What‚Äôs stupid fact people don‚Äôt care careful making rest us continue sacrifice. friend nurse turned she‚Äôs nurse back surgeon ICU nurses don‚Äôt access it. Trauma hospitals perks. wife managed get new certification, promotion, engage productive new hobbies. got depressed, anxious, stressed trying productive, next nothing show extra ""free time."" 

People handle things differently, commend applaud anyone able maintain mental health this, let alone able productively use quarantine time. me. goals stay contact family drown sorrows substances.

My mental health declined almost every single metric 2 friends covid. taking C daily months months. One 0 symptoms. One loss smell 3 days symptoms all. can't base policy tiny change child suffers long term effects. thing happens flu, children die suffer severe long term issues it. made policy around extreme outliers children would never go back school. that's Palestinian authority vaccinating people foreigner living Japan, supposed fly back home yesterday, glad cancelled that... know they‚Äôve closed country layovers? friend traveling Japan 28th.  Depends mean. mRNA vaccine transfects primary cells primary cell express antigen. case, stabilized membrane bound version spike protein. antigen identified cells, later break spike antigen present cells eventually cells present B cells produce antibodies various epitopes spike antigen. epitopes neutralizing means antibody binds viral spike prevent viral spike binding infecting cells.

It cascade involves break antigen multiple times immune cells know remember viral target is. usually need multiple doses vaccine since one time presentation isn‚Äôt enough. One dose vaccines usually viruses weakened still infect make copies non harmful way means one dose turn multiple doses time continues. Portuguese arrive! Knock, knock. United States. case close everyone vaccinated new strain even contagious. Lockdowns worked old strain certainly work new strain. 1. True, helpful. can't change past. 
2. I'm bay area, that's ""ILLEGAL"". way things going going need isolate lot longer 1 month. care people around me. either lie barely test people. Nigeria announced 28 deaths past week 20 doctors? follow proper safety measures, 99% schools can't won't. large part lack proper funding. 

Two posts paywalled way.

But point KNOW sure problem. Guessing, small pop shot studies school locations conclude anything. school systems opened long enough proper data contact tracing make assessments.

I find many stating kids Though recent studies varied methods, findings similar: infected children much, more, coronavirus upper respiratory tracts infected amount virus found children ‚Äî viral load ‚Äî correlated severity symptoms. words, virus mean severe Finding high amounts viral genetic material ‚Äî studies measured viral RNA, live virus ‚Äî kids prove children infectious. However, presence high viral loads infected children increase concern children, even without symptoms, could readily spread infection others. Well originally talking people flying right now. there's record every person traveling. there's lying that.

As obesity antimaskers comparing apples oranges. obesity going give heart attack. antimasking could give covid. yes think lower priority comes triage care. would actually relieve burden healthcare workers. look patients list travelers one one know treat. hoping wasnt going big deal. would magically disappear warm weather. case serious preventative measures would harmed economy.

Unfortunately wrong everything. serious lack prevention ended hurting us even worse economically. 

They valued money optics else ended losing fronts due incompetence. want something doesnt mean know obtain it. American like Mark Twain. never let schooling get way education. may???

When people wake f realize it‚Äôs time go full dark stay home month? Ah cool, fair. love WFH yeah agree need change attitude sickness. sure meant things like 1/2 metre distance, contact people, reduced capacity.

Thinking might start wearing mask long haul flights tbh. spent half year Japan COVID world (for work lot time). wasn‚Äôt year. nice visit could tell would lot better before/after pandemic taken care of. You‚Äôll get there!! printer mentioned article come designer-dog suite? newer printers like Amazon one bunch industrial quality apps available consumer..

I'm glad see mob receptive mood today might ? thing ""hero"" CEO public health groups throughout developed world fudging numbers order keep schools open, covering one finds despite multiple independent studies (and others) looking data?

Hmmm... okay, that's one possibility guess. finally finally notice trouble, hope gets fixed summer ""Putting aside little while""...I think issue going 9 months, average person willing sacrifice. live near SFO, planes coming minute week I'm allowed backyard beers buddy? Schools closed black friday ok? Nah, stupid. distrusting understand rationale kidding. don‚Äôt care anymore. Aren‚Äôt burned caring? It‚Äôs useless. job go home. tell people love stay hell home right now, don‚Äôt anything could require trip ER. Take risks. big shit ahead. It‚Äôs tiring imagine two weeks now. 

Many people learn hard way. Best stock fluids OTC meds now. wave coming. body pains coming. Lol! fuuuunnnnn!!! good percentage people vaccinated enough meet herd immunity vaccines available everyone please lift restrictions let vaccinees carry life (voluntary) anti-vaxxers die? Trump: told Yeah. there's number going around vaccine 57% effective first dose, that's full period time. know much little graph trusted (it looks overly precise number cases we're talking about), moderna meeting similar one. Seems pretty clear immune system makes antibodies real quick. You‚Äôre right. problems religion ultimately problems humanity. take religion away people getting wrapped things like astrology, diet culture, sorts stuff. 

I say church article, Calvary Chapel particularly cultish kooky though. relatives deeply involved although lot church background Calvary Chapel bad seen comes science denialism, anti-education, gender discrimination, basic common sense, abusive leadership, etc. people much stronger need social interaction appreciate.

1. let things get bad, could back normal social interactions

2. Wear masks, social interactions late that. done onset. Could easily like NZ course won‚Äôt thing - they‚Äôll partying themselves. rest world like subreddit. Fear mongering Honest question: charged huge amount priority vaccines this... Could excess money used increase overall supply distribution vaccine everyone else general? so, maybe consider it. could save lives, even greedy arrogant. 

If help ramp production, tell piss off. want true, so, them, is. Well, can‚Äôt even get people throw trash trash US I‚Äôm surprised. guess looking back I‚Äôm sure expected country founded bunch religious fanatics. one r/coronavirus go back parents Christmas?

Tokugawa shogunate approves People get tested. thing happened Thanksgiving: backlog jump afterwards, big gaping hole bother get tested. time I‚Äôve said wearing mask isn‚Äôt attack freedoms, I‚Äôve laughed people call sheep. People mostly care couldn‚Äôt care less neighbors citizens may disposable herd valuable.

And culling herd.

They want us weak, want us desperate living paycheck paycheck enough time, money, food better fight back hobby something apart maximizing income working out/eating healthy. Read book? absolutely right, there's likely fuck do, people burnt that's okay. comedy pre-covid, keep head /u/PoopIsAlwaysSunny nothing futile unless make way. Japan going back roots! article compares differences influenza COVID-19.

If look Wikipedia picture [H1N1 certainly looks like coronavirus me. wondering since 99% Covid patients survive shouldn‚Äôt 99 photos survivors every one fatality?‚Äù Piccolo wrote.

If 3,000 Americans died 9/11 290 million Americans die, give hundred thousand times much coverage die? yes, keep mind lot medical products meds cleared FDA later cause severe problems eg lawsuit Essure. bad paranoid 5G conspiracy theorist think solution blindly accept everything anything released market merry crisis wonderful year 2021 muricans! dont realise true.. cling rebuttle anything covid. dont want exist cling anything proving big deal.
Republicans like avoid reality reguardless reality exact argument family. claimed communists collectivist therefore bad. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Proven, no, presumably based evidence quickly spreading UK population.

Day 1: virus variant linked 50% cases, new variant X linked 1% cases

Day 25: VA 49%, VX 5%

Day 30: VA 33%, VX 25%

Then use model virus spreads compare VX got versus VA. Basically assume increased proportion VX due higher transmissability, model estimate it. That‚Äôs literally message governor since summer: ‚ÄúMost Floridians aren‚Äôt people died coronavirus, maybe stop talking it.‚Äù think important look total deaths since pandemic started vs average deaths years past. (United States) 200k passed average year date deaths, heated argument someone kept claiming things counted Covid deaths Covid related. kept reminding 200k deaths average, kept talking pneumonia flu deaths way average, interpreted deaths counted Covid inflate numbers. took explaining 3 4 times realize 200k deaths average accounts misattributed deaths. Deaths deaths. Way people dying year average. Whether directly Covid may relevant. People dying one reason another much higher rate year.

I think closing 400k now? need double check number. Yep. soon vaccine I'm going covid mode. I've done part done wasting youth this. It‚Äôs wondering I‚Äôm going die anytime leave house- me. Scientists saying ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù vaccine effective new strain guessing. Even right - hope - please don‚Äôt assume don‚Äôt need practice safe hygiene vaccination. misread title covid time travelling super confused half minute Fortunately death rate seem caught massive spike cases

It always eventually. :( Masks anything people level risk. Unfortunately, people never going able live way pre-covid. Can't shut vast majority humanity that. Hella funny x) imagine coughing start seizuring x) Easy: Transmission rate must 1, even new strain.

Unfortunately, Western governments phlegmatic, bureaucratic short-sighted, it.

While keep inventing reasons can't done, strain spread, bringing hardcore lockdowns fast, last. time, options left civil unrest mass testing quarantine, enforced stringent parking tickets. kinda ridiculous Gladys B Scomo throw shit state border controls yet NSW regular corona outbreaks never really seem go away... admit, may bit sensitive perspective elective orthopedic surgery LA hospital last week. 

It dramatically improve quality life disabled person, carried minimal risk transmission (I required produce negative Covid test doctors vaccinated) point, odds ICU admission tiny given age, health, procedure hand. 

I think perhaps elective procedures reconsidered, blanket ‚Äúno elective procedures‚Äù seems unnecessary point view experience. concerned hospital profits rather think hesitate cancel low risk elective procedures carry significant quality life improvements. Same. worst I‚Äôve ever experienced. ended switching meds getting things sorted but, crazy. hope you‚Äôre feeling better now. make matters worse vaccine plan worryingly weak. existing flu vaccine distribution system rely on, annually less 20% population get flu shot. government negotiating get vaccine manufacturers handle distribution capacity (their loudest achievement far commissioning design flower-adorned vaccination gazebos).

Last night, around 9,500 doses Pfizer vaccine arrived Rome Belgium. Instead using asap they're sitting symbolic first shots tomorrow. Madness! Saying virus ""less deadly"" sort weird statement. much awful advances modern medicine? would argue quite lot. kind logic lmfao people aren‚Äôt following precautions! Public health officials tried several times year give message would work better instead truth.  era social media already-low trust institutions, mostly backfired eroded trust public health institutions. cause depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation me.

That‚Äôs true pandemic: fear Interesting buried bottom sub, hearsay conjecture something dangerous rockets right top *very few* making optional, majority schools happen extremely competitive too. think agreement. surgeries ""not really optional"" still wait definition, otherwise they'd urgent emergency life saving surgeries.  true emergency (e.g. ICU capacity actually maxed out), I'd expect elective surgeries (or least cosmetic surgeries start) canceled rescheduled free beds staff. continuing schedule perform surgeries gives perception either there's true ICU capacity emergency (yet) and/or hospitals maximizing profit higher priority improving ICU capacity, honestly seems immoral given short term ICU capacity rates used justify shutting complete industries, destroying many peoples' lives. finally saw segment local news today nurses calling hospitals halting putting profits care... yet see anything comes it. Indian ‚Äúyoung‚Äù country terms average age. case \~90% population live cities anyway. religious choice. disabled isn't. comparable. still can, inject butt humongous ass. That's horrific. hope 2021 treats better. one knew ANYTHING hell it, effective was.

or band-reject filter installed brain blocks absolutely anything doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúcHyNa lIeS PeOpLe dIeS‚Äù not? One child severe COVID complications makes news. news interest people. hidden I'd take numbers doses administered reported grain salt. numbers need tabulated healthcare publicly/sent CDC, publicly available. top that, I'm sure reporting numbers exactly highest priority lots organizations, especially dealing dual challenges major COVID wave getting major vaccination effort underway.  


That's say hospitals dropping ball; mine first, seems gotten together week. However, suspect numbers doses administered massive undercount point. wonder many going admins non covid related staff ? Greece taken virus seriously paid off. let's hope organise vaccinations current estimates, going take 8 months due staff shortages infrastructure problems I‚Äôve heard news. know lot people real life covid. None long term symptoms. 

Im also RN cardiac turned covid unit hospital surrounded nursing homes see lot readmissions general. I‚Äôve never seen patient come back hospital long term covid symptoms, either. I‚Äôve thick Florida since day 1. Honestly, tough year been, know marriage survive anything. else, avocado toast? truly believe MCAT optional MD schools next year see class composition Stanford applied without MCAT. What? choices made individual.

The virus carried individuals make choice whether give shit not. sure that‚Äôs much different person deciding drive drunk. may kill injure people. may not. person gathers may infect people. may not. reckless, selfish choices. Neither one guaranteed end disaster‚ÄîI know people driven drunk hurt anyone! fuck anyone plays game roulette. heard Long Haulers? apparently Fauci inspired thousands quickly take years worth prerequisites, MCAT, research, volunteering, etc. within last months COVID, obviously!

/s it‚Äôs pretty easy convince families it‚Äôs real. hard part constantly working ratio 26 bed icu 20 prones. soon one dies, another comes ER.  Oh dead colleagues. also makes work fun.  I‚Äôll sticking medicine since I‚Äôve one form another 15 years. I‚Äôll lot jaded used be. realize buddhists, like Thais example, also share food right? familiar buddhist/islam culture southeast Asia? whom? initial spring surge cases, navy hospital ships, Mercy Comfort deployed help.  Los Angeles California need ships asap help military provide. Best wishes community. Hopefully vaccinations start making difference. 3000 holidays want information get make well educated decision. information gonna scary, doesn‚Äôt mean providing equal inciting fear.. need rich enough. resident tax haven. (This might work 100% USA, works close places.)

Didn't Trump pay zero taxes declared bankrupcy?  brother-in-law works Oxford work antivirals coronavirus.

He review two different strains convinced vaccine work new strain likelihood. Joke Meanwhile, won‚Äôt start vaccinating Netherlands January 8th... because... one really knows. ask money front report them. Go home bathe lysol. wait 4 years. fair surgery current spike. going back front lines covid watch people die start new year inadequate PPE. Idea necessary mental health right now. removing stresser able cope stressors.

Honestly want blame people, Blame people people dont wear masks correctly stores. IE nosedicking it. Blames stores limiting people shopping. Blame people parties. Blame people, Visiting family friends. Blame people indoor fitness classes. wearing masks around others outdoors. 

 Blame people isolating following guidelines like should. Why? I'm also allergic shellfish, making looser? something it? always believed bad decisions life, I'm glad learn allergies. Anecdotally me. I've friends basically lose shit year. Seems everyone new meet lost social skills. People people anymore. barrier us.

It's finally getting too. Full indoor shutdown high latitude (i.e. little sunlight) winter awful. I'm fighting best meditation outdoor masked activity, can't go on. gotta find way get vaccines reopen. That's great typo. Sounds like poetry makes sick. one died allergic reaction part cure that.

Unlike COVID. people never jobs (for reason) eligible receive government money?

Not even people disabilities? Wales (population 3 million) sequencing week France done year. sir madam math.  disagree, Islam def even close cleanliness buddhism, share water food sometimes (spit sharing) surely seen pictures literally 100s 1000s muslims coming namaz covid... Doubt happen since expecting uptick new cases Covid, due people gathering travelling Christmas holiday. so, said, partly based new science...

The new variants higher R Naught therefore require higher proportion population require vaccination achieve herd immunity. Especially people growing complacent due vaccine (check UK's situation 2 weeks 1st vaccination), combined low detection, perfect mix third wave. Combine 2 new strains UK South Africa, contagious, think prepared this. Literally dummy learn give shot shoulder. hard. 

The problem aftermath allergic reaction, worse. Short answer: No, wrong. 


Long answer: Depending protective supplies available, work environment, seriously take it, definitely protect risk. basic part healthcare professional's training, nursing aides neurosurgeons, know put remove PPE safely. Nothing 100% effective course, plenty healthcare workers, working COVID patients, (in area we've 2 big waves now) least symptoms catch it. sick since March, working COVID patients capacity time. going bring food 2 weeks? hospital frontline medical staff also stay home?

Yes people don‚Äôt *need* go stay home much possible need understand many cannot. You‚Äôre to. Umm... live LA? Cause ‚Äústrict‚Äù SAH orders joke. I‚Äôm encouraging ignoring them, there‚Äôs exemption nearly everything near-zero enforcement. Cases doubling month optimistic. Can't something like Blue Flu?? mean new variant Great Britain since September, probably spread across France since least October/November, France slow notice They're saying hospitals CA full can't divert anymore, recently sent information triaging care. general lack capacity forces say one, might well choose wisely. devilish dilemma. ambulance, helicopter &amp; fixed wing emergency dispatcher LA almost 20 years. seen dealt lot horrible situations course career. honestly tell past two weeks horrific heartbreaking ever experienced. situation actually much worse stated here. patients stuck gurneys 14 hours waiting bed. turn killing resources. Now, get stat-urgent (lights &amp; sirens) call facility like urgent care, best ETAs I'm able find sometimes 2-3 hours. people respiratory failure cardiac arrest. nightmare situation people dieing it. hear evening news. 
PLEASE STAY HOME WEAR FUCKING MASK!! USA: Amateurs!! 
Gotta bump numbers /s Gyms definitely open LA Orange County.... spin studio street packed full day every day 50+ person classes closed room windows. hate mental defeatist attitude everyone nowadays. 

Fun fact. Literally everyone retarded way always was. Everyone started paying attention started using personal crutch. Bloody mint, nice n hot beaches packed rona ‚ÄúThe condition isn‚Äôt considered side effect vaccines, staff wrote, plan track data vaccine recipients spot potential cases.

The report said 4 30,000 participants Moderna clinical trial Bell‚Äôs palsy, including 3 participants received vaccine instead placebo. Similarly, 4 43,000 participants Pfizer clinical trial Bell‚Äôs palsy, 4 received vaccine.

The paralysis occurred 22 days 32 days shot, FDA staff said. Two Bell‚Äôs palsy cases Moderna trial resolved. staff endorsed COVID-19 vaccines said there‚Äôs enough data show whether cases tied directly vaccines, according CNBC.‚Äù

I‚Äôm little nervous second shot bad case Covid I‚Äôd take mild side effects possibly getting Covid again. boyfriend pretty anti-vax saw went things continue deal with.  function testing capacity. India whole testing 6th US per capita. 

India regularly serosurveys check many cases misses every positive test. India closer 25 cases every positive case. US around 4. However 90% people test positive antibodies say asymptomatic. 

Look Singapore dormitories. 150000 infections amongst Indians Bangladeshis ages 20 40 sum total 2 deaths. Giving death rate 0.01% Indians 40. That's normal international interest mRNA Covid vaccines; however, West solid head start. Companies like Arbutus, Curevac Biontech pioneered mRNA technology since 20 years Europe US.  chocolate bois world... offense, transition surgery wait year shit blows over. It‚Äôs purely cosmetic, it‚Äôs quality life rather immediately lifesaving never wouldn‚Äôt job anymore, since I‚Äôm American goes health insurance. EASY. Yeah people dumb shit lot people don‚Äôt choice go interact people. choice starving homeless streets going work taking small risk getting virus small risk killing (not downplaying, it‚Äôs serious virus that‚Äôs truth). Law far less stringent prerequisite coursework though. It‚Äôs really bachelors degree + superb LSAT score can‚Äôt believe much missed spending $10 beer football game.  honest, yes no. 

In sales side tech least, yes company absolutely right thing promotes right messages. However, people don't. work company messages tell right things keep date safety levels. Hell, get weekly emails it. 

However, tech companies made lot younger folk. lot younger folk may leadership position. co-workers go golfing, Christmas parties, socialize frequently. guise they're smart party 10 people maybe say ""they've safe"", golfing outdoors yet share cart, they'll drink beers close proximity Delores Park fine they're outdoors. They'll take pictures co-workers post Slack wearing masks. 

To scroll comments thread.. Yes, average person dumb brick. tech world's credit would say overwhelming majority probably believe virus real. Yet, overwhelming majority folks easily look inconvenience lives put excuses label ""smart"" justify actions person dumb bricks doing. 

Meanwhile social bubble consisted girlfriend I. I've told people work Bay Area ask weekend response always is, ""You guys outdoor dining. Dude, totally safe. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ weekend."" And, absolutely saint. tried social bubbles Instagram stories realize easily compromised are. Even going singular short road trip 2 tech working friends, things they'd wouldn't. Ex, wear mask drive thru, sanitize hands filling gas, sanitize going stores, sanitize picking food etc. baffling.

No thanks, prefer go weekend hiking trips support local restaurants via takeout. Shit, I've even couple Airbnbs. I'm perfect rationalize things pleasure like everyone else does. 

A company solid leadership reflect attitudes individuals taken away entities. dare step CA right anything groceries though. sucks, I'm going respect stay home order sake hospitals even though I'm low risk group.... chance would space something happen terrifying. 

Just stay safe y'all. Nobody gets credit right now. tech company 100-1000s people right thing sending employees home, individual, strong leadership CEOs many people work preach. tech capital nation, we're fucking failing. efforts count right don't. Tech might ahead curve policies work something confined to. We're close know time passes slower ever lately shit let's try get right celebrate harder ever. get harder ever holidays. get us cheated rule following. efforts, efforts, companies efforts, count don't. positive company culture teammwork, lot better. companies can't save us ourselves. I've never seen happen. hospital capacity put divert code new patient goes different hospital. penalties hospitals divert. kick patient curb make room another. Say people don‚Äôt COVID obsession don‚Äôt get idea lockdown next 2 years doesn‚Äôt mean COVID deniers. acknowledge fact Corona serious health consequences time go lifes don‚Äôt engage kind ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù ideology bull****. alike could learn people maybe could help curb COVID anxiety. likely multigenerational households. likely work public facing service sector jobs. Culturally important maintain close physical contact family. remember one case early on, first overweight family member got pretty sick second healthy active brother died. difference probably viral load differences community transmission vs household. Fundraising even necessary since profits dried due hospitals able provide elective procedures. 

If someone willing drop $25k Covid shot booster, wouldn‚Äôt hospital accept donation expenses tight? India economically challenged, they're probably underreporting. Brazil probably well extent India Take investment banking shove it. entire industry built gambling deceit. 

Scum said would take 16 years get vaccine

LMAO!!!!!!!! F you. Big scandal Ivermectin still used Headlines like going make people already hesitant vaccine take it. :( Lots countries fund raising hospitals. call taxes. would say likely many complicated overlapping factors involved understand years come, there's magic bullet. Certainly chugging vitamin supplement make lifestyle changes whatsoever probably thing. like chain smoker takes fish oil healthier arteries something. That's paying attention articles excess death numbers instead covid deaths. Anybody dies get care, scared go doctor died something avoidable, etc., count covid death me. official covid death count 250k 300k article said excess deaths US 400k. least month ago...maybe 2. Excess deaths year probably 500k said done we'll going next year bad handicap surprised next year's higher mostly Jan, Feb, March. disagree. new strain affect younger people more, might way keep schools open. locked fast hard initially might taken two weeks, yeah probably take months hard lock agree social distancing can‚Äôt stay. considering approach article might go away least end summer people vaccinated. wonder world look approach 70% 80% vaccinations given. point say bit endgame first one still going Perhaps multigenerational households common Italy. want spoil but... South Korea 155th dead per million. 15 dead per million. Here's idea. Put list get sick go bottom list treatment. course reason distrust Russian media. Yeah it‚Äôs fun hang onto notion Christmas miracle one day apparently live rock. never heard concierge medical practice now. WTF  got big snow Kentucky, due Christmas many roads got touched plows. 

My Facebook filled people throwing fit can't get together family, point verbally assaulting people posting white Christmas pictures. evidence higher transmission due common properties UK SA variants?

There comments stronger effect children / young people South Africa, observations could support confirm this? listed many benefits people get wide accesity gyms yet kind teenage name calling ignorant rants. Grow f*** teenager, people different, complex needs kid like who‚Äôs anxious wants sit home 30 months scared death contracting Corona lmao Thank you! get - it‚Äôs hard hear sometimes - yes infinite coddling answer depression. Sometimes need toughen bit, get ass go walk(etc).

If reaction constantly wallow need internal work honesty entire culture coddled enough general cultural response - wallow loss - rather prepare handle event. maladaptive. 

We need whine less. grateful have. work harder focus personally improve. 
The real danger might virus deadly left people long term effects overload health system, leading us hindered capacity care people need it. Also, viruses affect younger people more, might close schools, something desirable economy. might also prevent us develop herd immunity vaccine, spreading viruse going faster capacity administer (think logistics here, necessarily vaccine production capacity). real immediate dangers, think? happens except it‚Äôs like 15, 16,000 Hz.

Israeli labs today also confirmed seeing significantly higher viral loads, likely cause increased spread. mean lots opinion saying think might happen. may new big virus within lifetime, years 2020 mostly fine well big outbreaks. Covid shown something like happens, we're extremely vulnerable ill-prepared. Covid also written another flu come Europe US are. tend think positive things. Disasters always happen always frantically try maintain status quo. think dumb wanting get back was. world ever changing, we.

Honestly I'm concerned whole climate change thing anything else. reach +1.5 degrees 7 years. We're gonna turn around. Prepare disaster honestly. virus, climate change truly one screw us next decades. Quick question. receivers immunized two shots? humans resource too.

This pandemic needs many healthcare workers train short time. talk running ICU rooms, they're talking physical spaces also staff required run them.

What‚Äôs permanently changed every winter mass vaccination, number people catch COVID die, price returning concerts weddings. Doubt media west willing to, even true. curve rising actually :/ Better check pricing first, monoclonal antibodies freaking expensive insurance health plans cover that. even discover one used majority cases. mean cure cancer, them, way expensive people pay.

## Abstract

SARS-CoV-2, epidemic, causes severe stress human animals may induce oxidative stress (OS) increases susceptibility infection. Domestic animals found infected COVID-2 suffering owners. Chronic immobilization stress (CIS), model psychological physical stress confinement, trigger depression anxiety animals. evaluated ameliorative effect proposed SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic drugs melatonin, vitamin C, zinc CIS-induced OS, inflammation, DNA damage rats. Forty male Swiss albino rats (200-250 g, 7-9 weeks old) divided five groups controls, CIS, treated melatonin (20 mg/kg), vitamin C plus zinc \[VitC+Zn (250 + 2.5 mg/kg)\] alone combination (melatonin+VitC+zinc) subjected CIS 3 weeks. CIS induced immobilizing whole body rats wire mesh cages size free movement head. Exposure CIS significantly compromised circulatory activities superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione enhanced malondialdehyde, inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL10, TNFŒ±), lymphocyte DNA damage comparison controls. Treatment melatonin VitC+Zn alone combination significantly restored altered biochemical parameters DNA damage stressed rats respective control values. However, cumulative action melatonin VitC+Zn effective alleviating CIS-induced OS, inflammation, DNA damage. present study indicates antioxidant combination effective preventive measure combat severe psychological confinement stress-induced biochemical changes animals due abnormal conditions SARS-CoV-2.

**Keywords:** chronic immobilization stress; inflammation; melatonin; oxidative biomarkers; vitamin C; zinc. killed favorite celebrity even probably. almost definitely last winter even knew it, went ton. already survived it. Australia New Zealand reopened international borders yet despite getting COVID well control.

You mean *because* control, want filthy noncompliant plague countries, like USA, let back in. Woah can't believe made Wano real thing, incredible homage Oda I'm NC too, place shit hole country lmfao I've visiting island lot years, I've always found fascinating large difference quality local government national government. many things UK would go ""Yes, local government really learn this."", hold true larger things. 

Just example, mask disipline abysmal UK months people started taking seriously Germany. History repeats expect we'll back normal April, May latest. Source?

As Dec. 15 I'm seeing [1,100 also seeing past two weeks 7-day-average new cases [is  America prioritize making capitalists rich letting citizens basic human interaction kids go school. Plenty countries test much could, scarcity tests. Japan even trying reach max testing capacity. probably thank then. I'm basically essential now. 

Also know things like barley barely typos, they're pure ignorance. Social distance somewhat normal Japan. instance, bow instead shaking hands. Lots respect personal space there, much change. mean, people I've talked seen sub basically saying rise related fall + winter holiday season driving massive amount travel, parties, public congestion. cousin works nursing home Illinois. Rich elderly people don‚Äôt real need nursing home checking get vaccine faster. costs $30,000. nursing home residents happy take money. Climate driver. instance Korea contract tracing incident restaurant infected person near AC vent everyone downwind facing air part got one facing away did.

That kind shoes indoors using AC also spread it. Ahh, seems misunderstood definition coronavirus. thought simply meant virus comprises sphere spikes (the spikes forming ""corona""). turns viruses looking like coronaviruses.  infer it. They're glad cancelled flight able come back Japan February flew back home now. nonsense already fueling conspiracy theories vaccine Tuskegee 2.0 Pls get memes fedoras rushing airports Overfishing bad Might well be. forced sacrifice ongoing medical treatment this, left bed ridden feeling like dogshit sometimes I've seen Republicans say really remember anyone calling xenophobic that.

Maybe idiot closed travel one country disease already thousands people leave spread globe. Collectivist culture vs rampant individualism NZ came midst lockdown legal basis it. Government passed retrospective law cover it, opposition tried complaining everyone moved day two. legal right something less important stamping covid protecting people. leaders mean Trump hilarious consider leader figure could done part advocate masks social distancing problem known way control here. I‚Äôd reach someone help, stay sub mainly aims push doom misery official CDC advice March wear mask unless symptoms. bad advice. numbers irrelevant. Need look change per week. kids go school testing positive????? Remember outdoor banquet Wuhan 100,000 people? early massive superspreading event. 

That local government trying pretend everything ok. think rationing care is? I'm going disagree mass casualty scenario. many people die? selfishness? broken clock right twice day I'm denying anything, I'm telling facts, Israel retaliated two rockets fired Gaza.
It's Israel's fault Hamas places ammunitions rocket sites near civilians. Israel's fault Hamas uses human shields gain sympathisers like you. I'll edit rocket launch video sec think? hope really depends long vaccine protects us think. We‚Äôll probably get answer summer Glad informed rather enraged insanely rAcIsT zeNoPhoBic! üëÄ explain Sweden's cumulative deaths per million lower areas like USA, UK France, much stricter measures (lockdowns) place?

[Our World Data cumulative deaths per Honestly I‚Äôve going back forth I‚Äôm curious, exactly need shut everything down? know Reddit people like harp US incompetent really need put every small business business right something high survival rate high asymptotic rate? NFL NBA proved teams get corona move everything okay. end day deaths seem immunocompromised people US it‚Äôs high. told stay inside isolate public health advertised? come instead stay home close everything drinking water, exercise, take vitamins, mediate, things benefit human body strong advertised?

I‚Äôm probably going get downvoted really want see good explanation think States big shoulder shrug well nothing? opened largely summertime okay. can‚Äôt celebrate thanksgiving go anywhere Black Friday? dine restaurants shop Walmart can‚Äôt see family Christmas? also don‚Äôt understand get COVID shut entire business, we‚Äôve worked went school flu someone looked deathly ill coughing sneezing whole nine yards.

I don‚Äôt know man Perhaps don‚Äôt understand exponents, math says we‚Äôre fucked, especially many people blatantly ignore safe protocols remember even declared pandemic, CDC said wear masks. thah they're necessary, actively said wear them. wish said everyone use face covering, even scarf old t-shirt. I'm Jewish, appreciate using Shoah deride legitimate concerns. ‚Äúwinter‚Äù 70F. Suspect people spend time indoors hottest months.

Foreigners Japan upset this. Exactly family did. 30 minutes masked gifts. made sure get together outdoors summer since winter would hairy safer better weather.  lot us taking consideration since March. lot flippant ""It's flu!""

Nah sociopath care people slaughtered dying. said knows people situation, I, several commenters thread situation. what, everyone lying you? we're gonna collectivley ignore 69......ok that's one example. Across US, even ""liberal areas"", handled really poorly. Ive open borders advocates say otherwise much worse diseases deal annually. Malaria, Typhoid, etc. Go Slovakia. Ambition matters. worries yo. good thing sure. family ok masks distancing 0 impact us imo we're gonna colectively ignore 69....ok japan returning time perry expedition‚Äî time america could inoculate land rising sun nationalism would trump western formalization Bingo. completely hit nail head. Asking us reduce quality life indefinitely soft-save lives light ask, many people sub like, welp! Gotta stay home 24/7 internet told to. really care ends. okay knowing leave :) Even psychological standpoint, chemical/human experience saving lives staying home vs saving life performing heimlich saving someone drowning feel concrete immediate. feel ""real"", saving lives staying home, even though obviously reduces spread indirectly saves lives. Milk UK fortified. 22-24. Personally, went break pre covid. would first summer single person long time, excited also would first time single, living alone (huge perk dating around), financially stable. We'll likely cannibalize 1nd dose rollout order keep 2nd doses schedule, unless good job ramping up. mention important one explain lack initial cases: African continent HUGE yet **extremely busy** international points entry compared Asia, Europe, North America, South America.

The UK, USA, France, Spain, etc...never chance contain initial outbreak least visited African countries able completely avoid it. read article information Japanese embassy, cannot figure thing out. still give VISAs? yes, enter Japan resident VISA? anyone help, would make day: request VISA weeks. also like 1/10th population. Yea island thing nearly relevant people want think. 'UK virus' everywhere, UKhas put lot resources genome sequencing order identify new strains. know Canada like they're anything like Europe, Thailand takes covid way seriously.

Maybe you, source really matter outcome same? Everyone saying never going happen dare say now...they've saying months preparing people wearing masks distancing 2022 control. Distancing mean measures taking times. shift means reduced capacity major venues incresed attention body relation bodies near you. can't help masking, that's normal family several years, frankly barely notice anymore. see thread filled dumb, selfish individuals.

I picked one biggest newspapers, news magazines news TV stations America. could picked multiple ones them. Pretty much. daily case count 200,000 + unreported cases sustainable figure. Perhaps 20,000/day was, definitely now. 

We need either full shutdown 4-6 weeks wait best precautions point. Since former likely happen least January 20th 12:01pm, I'm thinking latter likely. numbers like see increasing! creative artists make movies, right! Actually we've trending month now. Things much better right now. got downvoted median age africa 20... lol guy^, good thing make laws.  I'm sorry, understand people like that.

My fiance live together. seen family since March. seen family 4 years. Neither us met friends since March. go outside absolutely necessary, almost never since work home, currently unemployed due covid, order groceries delivered us Korea.

People losing minds can't get huge groups people seriously scary me. Like never realized close everyone else mentally unable deal becoming unstable. Like, grew internet. get news, meet friends, relax, work, learn.

I always assumed that, know, 2020 everyone lived, apparently not. data actually shows children lower infection rate compared population?

Did actually look excel sheet data misunderstand % charts? Australia 14 day quarantine period enforced police.  flu rolls every school US every year, saying michigan (before covid) school closures prevent flu? Public schools? sounds wild wouldn‚Äôt feel guilty random Redditor says. paid $130 NAAT test enjoy traveling covid free. real super spreaders I‚Äôm worried snotty mask-less kids; ironically exempt CDC Pretty low. need extended exposure. seconds really enough.

[MUST GO Salmon pacific thing too! heck man. Pacific Native Americans lived salmon eons. Berlin deaths China. Well, saying that‚Äôs easy say hindsight time would made difference zero consensus achieve herd immunity populations infected. Maybe micro level, macro level attainable virus mutate. works vaccines though. think definition clarified rather changed. They'll still send receive goods, allow foreign visitors country. Australia NZ since March. include mail? really, person said quote received information 50%, institute performing vaccine tests accurate information, cant' release yeat Sinovac (the Chinese company) asked us wait little more. Right, even herd immunity happen anytime soon point - POINT - realisation even ""immune"" covid population, vaccine dramatically reduce hospital admissions deaths.

We to, society, admit people get sick die matter course - we're mortal hubris suggest virus needs completely eradicated go back normalcy. many viruses bacteria go around making people ill that's part life. Things shit right virus new, can't live like forever. scientific advisor think humanity continue live distance eachother masked forever talking arse.

As soon vaccine available I'm getting it, soon takes effect people life I'll longer keeping distance them. music's full creative potential crippled pigeonhole status ""dance music""

Nah, problem fundamental that, music without performers' moment emotion. never listen live band twice, can't say electronic music. severe undercounting. People even told testing centers located, go multi-step process approved. test dead bodies covid, despite attending doctors wanting to, death tally severely off. original statement questioning implies *new* changes society come Covid. society *changed*, meaning society one thing Covid something different it.

Your answer say ""system"" broken government care us. new. something wrestling decades. 

So again, *changes* come covid effect society? talking friends day part found really disconcerting. *everyone* stayed put two goddamn weeks (three weeks, tops), whole thing would distant memory.

I excited vaccine announced, reality still many months rubbish deal with. checking online calculator earliest expect eligible vaccine June July (I'm UK). people vaccinated

But perspective Airports planes hotbed transmission.

Masks completely stop spread absence distancing unless something like fit-tested N95. They're risk reducers. 
Thousands people like rationalizing small risks small risks add overwhelmed hospitals, right along people taking precautions. better many, delude paragon safety. hope odds favored family catch it, enjoyed family time. That's crazy already. borders closed everyone since March. I'm shocked Japan open whole time. wonder balance take one dose even it‚Äôs little less effective? understand planning worse outcome, , don‚Äôt see many people influenced negative outcomes. hospitals overrun hundreds thousands dead people, good treatment starting vaccination, yet people won‚Äôt even take minimal steps. 

I‚Äôm convinced power fear people experienced threat directly. two friends got infected careless now, even though immunity, extra careful. There‚Äôs little administration shot due piss poor planning, significantly anything else.

Now, happen Doctor Virology degree University Reddit, let tell ***I*** think this.... Historically, herd immunity applies vaccinations.  

Herd immunity come natural infection. Viruses spread without vaccine reach similar subtly different threshold called ‚Äúendemic equilibrium.‚Äù Well can‚Äôt make everyone happy, you? Nothing makes everyone happy. Median age 20 Africa. North America 40. Trump call xenophobic lmao Facebook group. Repeating flawed data make accurate. 

There's way 4.65 million people Tokyo Covid 500 something deaths. 

We saw enough damage phony antibody tests coming California back spring. Stop repeating nonsense. lot people take way. Dude friend moved got covid within first month. charmed stuff surprised contracted it. Swine flu vaccine caused narcolepsy. Vaccine rollout going take months months... governments announce case creates additional fear. Since March we've told next 3 months, every 3 months.

Herd immunity work either, antibodies last long enough.

Add this, believe stronger strain appeared certain countries (UK).

We still long way solving problem. different someone Trump it./s Yep uk months. Probably first identified uk uk one countries tools detect decency let evryone else know . primary point study, appears 50-80%, unknown duration US UK good job exporting virus everywhere marginally control, like China Italy blamed early on. Except eight months, three weeks. group

lol. many Chinese people exist planet?

Minority group ass. According article, tested negative Tuesday (after tournament) hospital Friday. Sounds like could‚Äôve false negative.

O no, going take hard look! surely get numbers down. Need vs want spectrum. true cutoff different people's. 

Personally, think either visiting family vacationing valid reason. I'm disputing people *think* necessary. However, people also think potable water tap necessity, even though plenty people live without it. requires mental fortitude and/or adaptability willing able give.

As another example, I've people tell going adopt dog get certified emotional support dog rent reasons. believe people need emotional support animals, everyone. clearly people willing take advantage system.

The biggest difference Japan USA, IMO, masked early masked often. Idk ur getting downvoted you‚Äôre right hahaha way science works look variables. thanksgiving caused SoCal spike, everywhere celebrates thanksgiving seen similar spikes. didn‚Äôt.

No one debating SoCal spike real. started thanksgiving. Peak mean nothing lot Americans. Better get together barbeque friends family worry community stop spreading virus. Ie. Excess deaths around 15% higher reported deaths. basically believe saving one 50 year old moral saving three 75 year olds, disagree.

I‚Äôd say well testing!!! make getting tested difficult. prove come contact someone positive. decisions health department make possible outbreaks incompetent it‚Äôs funny! Well bad, science shows otherwise. Kids need education virtual school young kids worthless garbage. Trying keep kids caught plus working home impossible. 

Normal people sick ruining sacrificing lives kids lives this. new ‚Äúvariant‚Äù overhyped BS meant continue scare us buying it. That's feel, see stories like ""hey better want vaccine anything else"" Paywall. another thing worry about. infectious deseases must child get adult deadly.

Young children building immune system schools. schools means building less immunity wich might become problem later life.

The fact young children ( age 10 12 ) ability respond differently new micro organismes might also explain major spreaders virus. researches indicate child catches virus wil deal without becoming infectious.  CoViD 99% sUrViVaL rAtE

I quite like life. happy, think, enjoy successful fulfilling life good friends count on. That's many others say. I'm sorry offended you, personally think benefits society wearing mask outweigh (perceived) downsides (of very, very, few).

You right facial expression lost, can't think single downside wearing masks. Also, like said, facial expression important shopping store? matter subway bus gas station? 

Other countries successfully integrated mask wearing cultures enjoy less illness result it. would love become norm US that, someone getting sick/is sick, wear mask protect around them. worked office building, got sick people office time. Every fall/winter, illness would come sweeping through, hear person. cubes away coughing like mad disgusting. would bad wear mask? 

I'm saying going wear mask 24/7. go store, go crowded place like airport something, gonna wear mask. like that's you, need stoop insulting someone even know based single comment made internet. Grow up, learn empathy, try treat others kindly whether know not.

Happy holidays take care. hope 2021 treats well!  I‚Äôve smoking weed playing video games 9 months also met really hot girlfriend Facebook dude? SOUP YOU! anyone else noticed trend media vaccine-hesitant poc treated rightly mistrustful based history everyone else crazy conspiracy theorist  They're hopeless, seriously. Death cults really disturbing.  Russia's adenovirus vaccine Funny say thing CNN MSNBC. universal complaint....  Relax, everything America. surprising, given Kentucky's senators are. Nope. talked British person chose isolate even though required to, may prevented many infections possibly deaths.

That's positive thing.

The negative thing pointing Swedish government nothing even ask travelers isolated themselves. told colleagues design ‚ÄúNobel quality,‚Äù   

KISS lot people super intolerant anyway. first got Iraq Muslim Kurd working timidly asked permission pray shocked told go I‚Äôd take security. thanked profusely stated previous soldiers worked hadn‚Äôt allowed it. Ramadan less. still can‚Äôt wrap head around fact conversation even happen. It's.... It's...it's almost early stages pandemic confusion, intelligent, patriotic caring people adjusted going along authoritative guidance protect country people.

As opposed uncaring, America-haters throwing unending temper tantrum protective meaaures, name 'freedumb.' I'm always bummed miss crazies... what'd say? people still think essential travel baffles mind. Shut borders, ground flights month - UK... countries.

I can't... can't take shit 3 years... pile becomes mountain? matter hoarding mountain gold became problem: urge need curbing. Everything wrong traveling right now. 

Go read healthcare workers going compassion. Everyone get Japan!! Chasing big 1 six 0 death number. Yeah, normal circumstances...

I‚Äôd rather delay child education year virtual home school bullshit. must missing pleas testimonials healthcare workers, get holiday all. ^^^^ literally denier 

Anyway obvious Russian trolling happened late March early April sub went half million two million members, lot specific words phrases began repeated large number users. doubt covid deniers sub paid anyone obviously losers like one weird dude constantly complaining sweating poorly ventilated room full people close proximity without masks doesn‚Äôt spread covid besides healthy people don‚Äôt get hurt anyway close gyms? Big baby people like this. Nobody paying anything. They‚Äôre losers.

So it‚Äôs just, like, people gloaty mean arguing disingenuously doesn‚Äôt matter grandmother died going die anyway want go gym can‚Äôt tell ‚Äúlife life‚Äôs‚Äù media hype blah blah heartless nonsense.

And like, someone nudging way? Maybe herding you? Who? motives might have? Herding way? Hmm? Ah, science denial ‚Äòmurica continues simply care students. Add thar variant might come UK begin with. UK South Africa way genome sequencing virus samples anywhere else. Lots places could similar variants can't find looking them. vast majority spike happened prior Thanksgiving Fortunately they‚Äôre starting test children. kids little older I‚Äôd sign last decades, medical trials almost always done white men. article talks vaccine trial included 463 Native Americans, news new compared past big trials. public know POC treated appropriately media cover progress? Oh man I‚Äôm sorry. sound gave anxiety immediately. also health problem reduces quality life see people act carelessly mind blowing. Lots people going regrets late. reading completely messed repatriated flight, I'm going malice.

Maybe CDC run political appointments bad thing. entire human population Italy standing top one another's shoulders gigantic tower reaches Moon. 

Nope. Thee could also hundreds thousands apartment blocks one family living would literally living top one another. live Wisconsin another dimension. sacrificed grandmas Fall numbers shrinking winter. live future. 

Wish society could held another couple months, reasons can‚Äôt discussed subreddit, couldn‚Äôt. update noon Thursday, hopefully they're bit late. intentionally avoiding stats, we're breaking records every day. MUST avoiding pleas healthcare workers asking people stay home. get holiday all. Oh, think higher 25k, clear. think lot rich people would happy pay it. Percentage population matter compared percentage *wealth*. done via medical industry/hospitals 'selling' - vaccine distribution set government, costs lot money. I'm saying, I'd fine people paying LOT people get faster (and free) too. already know there's going black market vaccine, I've heard experts talk couple times interviews. Turn white market. willing pay exorbitant amount, that's also fine, chill line rest us. Make option price point makes difference, think. 

Of course, work, corrupt shits administration would pocket money somehow, world kind competent government, might work. play fire, suppose.

If want stand chance virus, schools must remain closed. Full protection appears 5-7 days first dose (figure 1 fda link minus 5 days symptom onset). rapid.

We actually see difference another month though. agree general... community health level... individuals make decisions individual circumstances. least right choose low paying jobs barely don‚Äôt even pay enough make ends meet enough safety net help meet basic needs- food, shelter, heat, transportation... Poorer families likely live high density housing situation multiple generational family units. They‚Äôre also likely underlying health risks. children risk falling behind school technology needs distance learning. sets horrible win choices.

yep know short-term deaths people 60 relief vaccinated. also know get infected people 60 relief segment gets vaccinated. 

What don‚Äôt know chronic issues 60 people get Covid. attacks brain heart blood vessel cells normally resistant influenza type viruses. Hence loss smelling. could see major increases dementia, cognitive issues, heart failures another couple decades. Perhaps perhaps not. dumb gamble. one saying throw normal light fittings. They'll also probably one last things come back normal. feel bad musician/performer friends. made laugh everytime I've seen it... can't believe real life! One example woman whose cells used without informed prior consent (or payout family) develop life saving medical treatments 1950 (which tbh I‚Äôd say considering harm helps others morally obligatory thing do)

The famous example failing treat black people (or ‚Äúblack bodies‚Äù prefer) syphilis like 1930 following decades - obviously unethical wrong shit happened time back day

Why aren‚Äôt Jewish people also encouraged scared vaccine given medical experimentation concentration camps?

Why isn‚Äôt media encouraging ‚ÄúIrish bodies‚Äù scared dont know ever US school, even best ones LAUGH word ""ventilation"".

That doesn‚Äôt really imply it‚Äôs common thought people agree sub. suppose it‚Äôs far technically means one says that... commenting meaning groaning called denier acting like normal point view scientists users sub constantly quoted.

as comment- referring question regarding Nepal India‚Äôs cases?  I‚Äôve come realize thing protest things don‚Äôt like vote wallet. I‚Äôve really started take look companies run, treat employees, ethical general. 

I may able much, least use money ethically. found app tell company-who backs financially, parent company is, kinds things support, etc. it‚Äôs called Buycott use scan barcodes I‚Äôm grocery shopping. Fuck media, give peer reviewed data thing worries kids don‚Äôt yet know long term effects health get this. Sure aren‚Äôt dying much, end long term lung damage something else? feel like lot people still look low death infection numbers kids don‚Äôt think need take much precautions really worries me. Already school system wants ignore guidelines get kids back school full time. lunatics baying against.

The funny thing sub used mock use wearing masks way back official guidance wear indeed many articles would counter productive. 

Now sub 180'd masks obvious means protection. mean, agree mask wearing lets little humility here.  Nothing herd immunity can't solve /s 100% pulled right butthole different coronavirus. Coronaviruses differ many ways, symptoms death rates. Right? Early 40's applying direct-entry nurse practitioner programs right now. want house I'm 80, also intern/resident huge med school debt then. point one getting. sounding alarm bells still killing lot people. 2010, people going pubs/concerts/restaurants, concerned washing hands, never ever wearing masks, going see grandma nursing home kissing cheek also medical care counter everything free market needs.

You know buying time. (You know symptoms)

Even do, know cost (this could fixed) 

You often choice providers, functional monopoly. (Is like going shop around bleeding out) cases getting worse. seriously going ignore situation LA especially?
again, alternate dimensions ppl live in? Yes, I've spoken child (multiple times fact past months) confirm kept safe pandemic. dying negative outcome this? Flying inherently risky, educate traveling.

Huh, interesting. honestly assumed wouldn‚Äôt update Monday, said otherwise, that‚Äôs interesting.

Maybe mistake, given frame gone... it‚Äôs taking bit longer get data together due various delays. I‚Äôm seeing updates mention update site either.

Weird though. technician, ""ferry"" us next elections. lo behold, got pandemic prize. alternate dimension live in? vaccine me!!!! know MANY others get it! think mean ‚Äúintubated‚Äù.

Yes, already live alone, wear masks properly (no nosedicking), social distance, ""stay home"" whenever can, go parties, practice hand hygiene, sanitize groceries takeout/takeaway (only wash hands eating).

Found Belgium then. combined news trying exaggerate everything make trump look bad possibly led whole pandemic blown proportion sounds pretty impossible navigate right now, months go vaccine people. Could implemented now. Heck, even primary care doctor myself, area clinics place want stay away can. :( literally pointing America train wreck right now. China absolutely lied handling seriousness pandemic off. Remember streets lined dead Wuhan? Remember ravaged province early what, October xinnie Pooh chose acknowledge it? may reduced cases now, it‚Äôs shillery assert China viewed covid success story. Seeing mitch's buns affect. likely, possible mental health actually improved. overworked barely saw kids fortunate enough ok financially (not well of, surviving comfortably) nice spending lots time them, especially 1 year old. really missed able go swimming pools theme parks. Can't imagine rough lot people though I'm sure would many times life would destroyed me. Thousands?! Wow! really think that's going take can't even care human beings?

All people power care money power. obvious yet blind. small uptick.

Not near-normal year. July 20, 1969 eight hours. mean either way popular enough point view sub merit dedicated crew people complain daily basis. That's opinion. World Health Organization covid deniers ü§î? Like that's strawman admit it, even admitted mine... Well looks like paying taxes want money getting vaccine nothing prevent transmission masks/social distancing end getting - lot people going get it. it‚Äôs worth, number folks use Botox reasons, like migraines stuff. don‚Äôt get migraines frequently enough consider it, apparently option people.  Insane say it‚Äôs easily treatable. Everyone treated fine. Lots people US legitimate reasons developed mental issues. Europe, example, I've seen many entitled people feel like life longer go party twice week...past midnight. wish people went instead ones they've infected. group brings majority deaths *massive* margin vaccinated late spring, I‚Äôm done. 

I‚Äôve behaved given 9 months life protect people. they‚Äôre safe, I‚Äôm giving anymore. 

Call selfish, I‚Äôm giving life there‚Äôs good reason too. goal Europe too. 2nd wave worse 1st wave.  happened wife's BFF's daughter. still says words British accent day, including real world name. adorable, know would make anyone xenophobic. aren‚Äôt cheap waiting 14 hours. Time worth something, even people think isn‚Äôt. Oh. That's good. urgent care we're allowed certain amount. Again, this. much time wasted bureaucracy make rollout slower. reverse age smooth. I'm one lucky 4 already stress emotional scars Noice know get medical degree 3 years residency?

Doctors borrow 400k 8 years school, interest 8 years residency. 

The 4% interest ridiculously conservative (I borrowed 9%, luckily 4 year repayment statistics section:

The average physician ultimately pays $365,000-$440,000 educational loan plus interest.

$165,000-$240,000 interest.

At current interest rates, $200,000 debt double 10 years even regular payments. talking mRNA vaccine...I'm taking adenovirus vaccine Canada developed China stole return production samples Canada learn read point related thirty prevent vaccinated. thirty percent vaccinated, high risk people older plus staff hospitals means less plus better treatments means hospitals overflo. focused answer tothat part post. Don‚Äôt even far back us remember imminent nuclear destruction hanging us 80s. I'm feeling this, lot. I'm lucky job income affected, anxiety depression gotten worse years improvement.  


I'm extroverted person. like going things. like around people. hate working home. hate social distancing. kind got point decided going actually follow social distancing rules all, would survive this. wear masks try keep six feet possible, can't stay home time. I'm worried dad much; driving even wall he's taken believing conspiracy ""COVID hoax"" thing. lethal? resolved cases numbers worst way calculate CFR moment though suppose technically correct. compare states see unreliable number is. said done I'd expect CFR closer 1% 3% unless there's dramatic change testing treatment. Maybe 1.5%?

Also, say ""over course pandemic"" obviously apply current situation. tried stretching imagination spiralling deepest dark darkest mindhole? watched science program years ago suggested governments sample wastewater airports monitor infectious disease. wonder country. due think actually mutated Kent, found first... food additives grocery store turn brother zombie? brother really living primitive existence growing organic food would say leave alone. using plastics greenhouse hydroponics system ask ""what chemicals gassing plastics turn zombie years"". 

Ask material safety data sheets chemicals house. refrigerator. tell reason start worrying chemical either.  MSDS chemical DMG-PEG-2000. vaccine also contains sucrose. MSDS sucrose says cause ""irritation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain"" ingested. probably best consume pounds vaccine formula. never said thought it, I‚Äôm sorry it, wish speedy recovery without complications.

What I‚Äôm saying idea five minutes near someone outdoors supposed extremely safe encounter. idea it‚Äôs alarming could even say frightening people. even found frightened reading it.  Oh good, it‚Äôs me. I‚Äôve homebound agoraphobe since June suuuuuucks. stress year took mostly-manageable mental illness turned 100. past coworker I‚Äôve known 5 years exhibited really odd behavior year. Prior riots/protests, lockdown, close friend, mentor, someone talk things don‚Äôt normally share others. talk anything coherent fashion talk things. 

But lockdowns began, became someone totally different. began comments eventually ‚ÄòDemocrats would taking freedoms‚Äô things like coffee (jokingly). later called ‚ÄòChina virus‚Äô despite fact husband Asian decent called uncomfortable say things. Notions Fauci tried mass murder ‚Äòhis‚Äô handling pandemic. HCQ real deal treating COVID, despite fact us work clinical research academic level know takes drug FDA approved. wanted get gun protect riots despite nowhere near them. (I‚Äôm owning gun, it‚Äôs odd say need gun something miles miles away you...

She said doesn‚Äôt follow main stream news due partisanship, yet find paired instagram Turning Point USA right wing news agencies mutual friendship. 

On Instagram, pictures family became political sayings. pictures family, make things political.

I know lot plate. recent child didn‚Äôt expect older age, husband times mentioned leaving her. older child difficult, ex. 

Up election like this. last post Harris pushing Biden cliff trumps defeat. she‚Äôs quiet. still makes odd comments times group text I‚Äôve learned disregard.

She recently messaged happy holidays, hoped well (since haven‚Äôt normally reaching normally), difficult year was. told everything going caused lot anxiety hair falling out. comments made, suspect fear, paranoia event.

I‚Äôm sure speak mind tell odd behavior past year, may want consider returning seeing therapist (which move). appreciate advice. McCarthy tuck fucks you? Unpopular opinion, find nurses doctors posting vaccinated little obnoxious. deserve prioritized, rest us patiently wait turn feels little like rubbing faces, especially treating COVID patients.

I'm obviously pro vaccine excited take turn. Well okay originally said misleading lol? stand said ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è could probably become fluent French already. I'm permantently stuck Spanglish mode. Peter Capaldi you? piece shit. Nah, dumb people's opinion mattering, DNC manipulating party pissing enough voters want participate. Similar things time lot people like ""eh, fuck it, know they're scumbags least they're adults""  
Best wishes wonderful darkest dawn‚Äô ever get depth regarding question defines ""covid case""? basically translates ""what makes pcr test turn positive covid ?""

digging deeper get ct rates test undergoes providing result. im sure remember interesting nytimes piece criticism high ct rates pcr tests reached mainstream. 

basically highly questionable whether positive tests based ct rate 30 35(?) really enough put someone quarantine (or count covid infected general) 

the fact dont know ct rate pcr tests undergo laboratory works amount ct raises doubts whole ""covid cases"" subject. recommend look maybe come different conclusions me. 

but believe ct rate unbelievably crucial pandemic far often overlooked misinterpreted. love feedback wife left bipolar disorder honestly wouldn‚Äôt blame even though would miss anything. quite handful sometimes. I‚Äôm Germans one. denied late stage medical attention ventilators chance mutated virus worsen current pandemic? We're seeing mutated virus UK already spreading far Japan. US there's mink tested positive coronavirus, would sucks turns another mutation. vaccine going useless mutations? early say? That'd break Hippocratic oath. Uneducated people still deserve saving. Thats meant late summer/early fall. people want vaccinated No, want stuff face McNuggets blame everything virus already discovered little self reflection pandemic! 3.9% US population 80 years old (and represent 50% covid deaths). That's 13 millions people.
Once vaccinated (by end January?) see huge reduction death. 
Then vaccine additional 70 80 yo, maybe 10% total population, plus obvious people risk essential, death almost disappear. 
I think see equilibrium around 20-30% total population vaccined. genetics also help identify people risk 23andme alert people risk.

2021 everyone else get covid without causing mass death basically. Looks like ye *can* change laws physics all! It‚Äôs actually insanely hard get job now. Hospitals money elective care. They‚Äôre getting grad students take rotation peanuts firing doctors left right realm. elective surgeons. household member tested positive rapid test yesterday. going wait Tuesday get tested job's quarantine, cases going up, y'all think get tested now?

At minimum, opportunity cost could've used debt something else. could've used land something else. could've used *time* something else. Yeah, maybe tree yielded enough fruit cover initial loan got, chose put loan tree instead of, say, going get college degree, decision cost far paying loan.

Like, literally, read first chapter every economics book, beg you. basis economics efficiency allocate *scarce* resources, one fundamental parts economics knowing allocation resource means can't use another opportunity, real cost. Completely agree. aunt diagnosed covid admitted yesterday. waited 12 hours room. 

I hospital last month antibiotic resistant pyelonephritis cousin works hospital admitted warned may wait 24 hours room. lucky, even wait hour. Getting cold flu every good immune system. one ever got sick ever, would susceptible illness disease. think means therefore people see quality store except clean superior customer service?

Yes article good article, didn‚Äôt include initially I‚Äôve already responded person first sent that.

Brand recognition brand. one knows company is, doesn‚Äôt exist. 

Also understanding Walmart‚Äôs brand outdated. LOL.. obviously taking ass CCP. Sorry China, UN.

Ya‚Äôll remember guy liked complain ‚Äúshit-hole‚Äù countries? understand, literally nine months figure out. Wtf about? I'm sure saying lockdowns bad mental health not. think study points people suffering ones recovering COVID.

""The disorders occurred frequently among infected recovered adults, followed healthcare providers, adults community, quarantined adults."" power times war. could likely get away authoritarianism treated war invisible threat.

Yes, really are. even really much question.

Sorry can't handle truth. Creating goals accomplishing thing that's gotten this. Honestly. recently jumped humans. obviously still lot room optimize human ACE2 binding. work major insurance carrier experience similar. WFH since early March, got stipend office equipment, management accommodating non-standard schedules. Folks given opportunity WFH long want to. *we scotland. too* issue hospitals flooded covid patients everyone suffers. elderly. parts health system affected. Even wanted, cant ‚Äúnormal‚Äù even want act selfishly, everyone affected. Since barely even human coronavirus yet

that's rather massive assumption casually making. brightened shitey Christmas this. Thanks particular, claim wasn‚Äôt clear whether study participants given mask guidance specious. Guidance lack thereof, blinded study, uniform. would cut across control test groups equally. definately obsession cleanliness healthy eating now. enough serious anxiety comes suggestion sick much there.

Then ADHD kinda goes along all. old people don‚Äôt jobs.

It true need economy running, especially evident lack aid government. safest straightforward way get people back work lower cases amongst young adult population. best way vaccinating them.

Now, I‚Äôm saying throw elderly bus. get interacting jobs vaccinated vaccinated makes can‚Äôt spread cause significant dent infection rate, needed reopen. invite neighbor dinner, I'm technically gaining friendship food company, right? think farfetched say transactional model applies international relationships.

fuck this. context here, gov't dragging feet going ""level 3"" highest would pretty much involve shutting restaurants moving takeout/delivery. they've done math probably thought worth economic destruction. keep mind seoul basically korean economy. saying right, deal with.

there's joke moved level 2 2.5 2.5 ""alpha"" stage lol. basically said private gatherings ""5"" allowed restaurants split groups going pretty much nothing. SCRUM team use working closely. usually reach physically touch 1/3 team moment. going 100% WFH little scary, video chats messaging really 95% brainstorming general back forths well. miss hanging nerds person ton. currently plans team return office, ever. :( Agreed...nah. Although personally think entire rest world give USA PRC big timeout sit think lately. play others apologized behaviour agreed dicks. opinion though.  Exactly. planning get vaccine even though healthcare workers YOU. know saying agree. Although what's happening normal compared seeing; think people NEED realize ""normal"" viruses point view.

People excited vaccine; brought science biology.

We need careful. Best distillation complex problem. portrayals based ones dearly Fauci, results.

Yeah, true. people bay Seattle. Tech far reaching across USA world. worst death march ball spaghetti legacy code non-technical PM run shit hole project

I'd shoot million times jump woodchipper getting something like that. guess different strokes that. Correction: everyone shallow understanding econ believes that. Factor cascading effects disease availability labour expertise, broken production, transport, supply chains, overwhelmed healthcare systems, multiplier effects combination, lockdown rosy option. said 20 million would receive first dose end December. Last week came said week behind first week January. trying make joke relaxed rules compared western countries. understand different socioeconomic levels difference understandable. brother law finance came back family gathering small family gathering. hearing talk folks giving anxiety. crazy wanting hole room 5 watch movie?

I asthma apparently experiencing anxiety attack  administration criminal criminally incompetent. Hopefully, probably not. think big numbers come CVS starts vaccinating nursing homes California next week... Yeah fine I‚Äôll wear one least get 2nd shot place requires I‚Äôm done masks lol. fundamentally disagree here, challenge provide situation handled new, highly infectious, randomly asymptotic, potentially deadly disease would handled better ANYONE. 

China shit show - EXPECTED new virus spreads undetected significant asymptotic period.

Remember streets New York lined corpses? - brought portable freezers morgues filled.

China done much help rest world control virus, manage get control themselves. started month longer disadvantage significantly less knowledge. 


The US knew December, began classified political briefings since early January, STILL WAITED 45 days anything.

I fault China *a lot,* don‚Äôt see country (with similar population and/or size) handling novel virus well. 

Based EU US response 2-3 months warning, I‚Äôd curious feel differently. reason, may covid wipe portion world population. need learn fragile life planet. you‚Äôre top list groups get vaccinated there‚Äôs decent chance time would eligible companies vaccines approved. could probably skip one go different brand might fewer reactions particular allergies. That's like high schoolers rebelling teachers -- high schoolers think they're rebelling authority, teachers worst benign best care. world outside school give slightest fuck student drops out.  place provide REAL leadership. biliary/GLB/Pancreatic stuff yeah IR less safety efficacy compared interventional endoscopy, plus less interventional sessions cases go endoscopy instead IR surgery. ü§£ü§£ troll symptoms? doesn‚Äôt get reported antivaxxers still find claim reactions covered up. True. 2021 better hang take antidepressant helps you. believe cause he's million times better Trump. population 35k 56 deaths small attribute deaths anything country statistical modelling framework. cutoff point depends level confidence want results would consider population size number deaths, there's specific number outside asking statistical question. San Marino (and Vatican City) excluded every competent analysis country-level outcomes reason. plain untrue flat-out irresponsible thing tell people. 12 weeks infection, 56% patients still visible lung damage.

I'm taking lectures things ""untrue irresponsible"" guy pretending 56% tens tens millions people caught Covid visible lung damage, \*link provided\* states 56% \*so\* seriously ill ended hospital, general population.

How dare peddle fear terror here? That‚Äôs hilarious Probably time someone happy get shot Christmas. fascinates people downvote facts because...why? You‚Äôre allowed say here. America bad country. Everyone else perfect according reddit. Americans still banned even traveling countries world. know think make $7.50/hour able afford start new life else. cost thousand dollars ticket alone. hundreds passport Visa. Even accepted offered job another country (it's hard this) countries require thousands savings account. Plus need couple thousand pay deposit apartment survive start getting paid. 

So no, possible someone working cashier Walgreens simply move another country. even could think would happen US tens millions essential workers left? 

Why assume everyone struggling simply trying hard enough? 
You clearly understand world view.  ton doctors would like 13 average weight doctors? read bold part? Also 4 months really? realize one main public getting vaccine till June July right? Like I'm getting mine till either unless lucky job put limit. Literally .5% country vaccinated... even 20% 4 months nothing. keep saying I'm going delete Facebook account. definitely see negatively affects health mental state. can't pull plug. answer first question, yes. Hospitals follow EMTALA Anti-Dumping laws. 

As second, whether patient likely live not. 
 work case management, understanding every patient needs discharge plan. patient discharged, bed unavailable another patient. mask mandates restrictions last summer 2021, start rebelling them, think necessary degree. African nations particular Nigeria barely touched covid; think death rate like 5 per million entire pandemic. developed countries every single day last month two. parents positive LA County testing Dec. 16.  likely caught company weekend before. 

My dad pulmonary hypertension feared worst. oxygen decade basically started saying goodbyes facetime heard two positive tests.  far, little symptoms mom hardly well. fevers, nausea, low oxygen, etc two weeks since exposed.  Part feels like could instant problem time, part thinks could recoup like nothing happened. anyone know, one feared getting most. 

Seeing stories hearing lack oxygen tubes terrified yet week half almost way it? China hope humanity.
Doubtful.
China better hope humanity west.
fking yes! Showed GF show year... watched 3 times dare watch new episode without every week titans would least worries  I'm 2nd year; understanding medical school spots increased US + Canada quickly government allocated funding residency positions. think fault match algorithm itself. fact, prefer concept crapshoot applying undergrad/med school.

All hope AMA lobbies government increased residency program funding. 300 THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED. small number. cause people like virus begin family November. sister nurse nursing home, brother personal trainer still working customers almost every day...yet thought okay get together June, get together August September. don‚Äôt know point really smacked face, must‚Äôve Thanksgiving warnings goddamn, people like they‚Äôre smart others continue make same, extremely obvious mistakes. 

I glad finally came senses, condolences family‚Äôs wits. Hopefully come senses soon enough Let put way, internet probably waste time. I've definitely conversations real life may gotten someone, thats hard internet/over messages understand you‚Äôre saying could possible. think fact it‚Äôs taken dominant strain London detected September worried. variant obviously global point, sure acting like it‚Äôs contained UK course they'd fire nurse, ""the nurses pick slack""

It would huge loss community sick people, blame whole bunch nurses quitting (if could afford go). Patient care suffer that's hospital going mistreat existing nurses fire good staff crunch replacements.

I restaurant fire staff important banquet skilled replacements -- unless could blow suffer losses -- long manager owners take people fired. review data, found pre-existing condition. trickle Zoomers well get hug friends get vaccinated. Go start working Walmart... get vaccine faster. else wants rebel restrictions mask mandates badly actually it? That's Messi situation may able find someone similar symptoms r/COVID19positive Yeah applied school 4k applications 160 spots.... Good you. Proved wrong Yea take two entire months deaths NY, NY death rate looks better.

WHY DIDNT ANYONE THINK program costs 250k. wish free.... expert opinion?  office job, always remained open, maybe 1/5 1/4 employees office given time, we've many Covid cases, escalating recently. nothing like normal workplace. finally, since November, got point universal mask wearing inside office day, even isolating folks kinda assumed workplace safer true public spaces. mean definitely pay away. pay produce vaccines, pay people distribute them, pay people inject them, you‚Äôre really committed even pay people get vaccinated. pay send vaccines countries economy contact eliminate virus too.

Anything isn‚Äôt scientifically impossible done someone willing commit unlimited resources it. That‚Äôs people literally landed, walked, even drove fucking moon computers still size average living room. way inefficient, wasteful, accomplished precious little way actual scientific study moon, US government willing lay literally unlimited resources making happen cost, did. Simple that. Lol ok stop embarrassing Florida almost half deaths NY. 

New Yorkers would well keep quiet this. actually well developed world.

Can explain eating hamburger Nebraska ranch raised cow improves situation Chinese wet markets?

You seem really smart- explain eating red meat stop sale live bats Wuhan... America alone spent trillions still vaccinated public freaking coronavirus, like airborne ebola. Money clearly enough, industry enough, lucky virus even easy make vaccine reliant mutated 'spike' protein. turned unique strength target essentially, virus complex would easy producing vaccines volume even fast would completely impossible.

Unlimited resources solve everything, that's silly. achieve technology level allows push R&amp;D cycles rapidly. 

No matter much resources Rome dedicated space travel would still failed near tech level required rush fast. throw money iron ore every problem, take generations human though figure secrets humans can't trained that.

It's like top 10% humans drag rest us scientific ladder them. next 10% important work 80% break even represent net losses society. Sooo wait cycles top 10% brilliant people actually come great ideas.. least AI much much faster rate.

So.. bottlenecked fast pump genius level thinkers drive technology level up. **It's like game Civilization basically.. corn cows make get Mechanized Infantry 3000 BC. ;)** America, love pointless empty gestures here. 

What's matter, color bracelets, stickers cars, ""thanks service"" enough?

Oh what's that, want real systemic change? Gtfo, individual liberty important family life. Ok care LMFAO üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Worth it. charge $100 ""administration"". Like private jet manufacturers? ie, ""guns kill people"" argument. Fwiw, I'm still glad I'm Aus decide keep general public. I‚Äôm electrical engineer programming computers since 1980s. Seeing software compiled lifesaving vaccine surreal. Sci-Fi stuff, except real. There's calvary chapel church right street Cal. one I'm sure right it. sickening. main pastor one guys says covid real real pandemic Pelosi/Newsome/Biden. Ok care LMFAO üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Try oreos, man. thing is, virus becomes immune vaccine, undergo significant spike protien mutation, mutation spike protien affects ability virus enter cells.

It‚Äôs completely unrivaled, takes brilliance. 

That said, average medical student going studious classically smart finance cat. top 10 med schools average gpa 3.9+ MCAT nearly 100th percentile. Medicine takes insane studying understanding. Finance takes networking, clout, connections. 

I would say best compromise land tech job (FAANG) SWE.Finance drain you. Medicine self selecting really smart passionate, otherwise miserable. 

Regardless spots top industries (doctor, tech, finance) saturated everyone pretty high caliber. valid reasons go path. long you‚Äôre stupid, life compensation fine (200k+)

They've successfully guilted guess.



My guess really believe danger putting blame mom brother. Otherwise, she'd volunteer quarantine 14 days visit test negative end quarantine moving back you. Things already taking turn worse September. nothing Italian management remarkable even first wave anyway. Italy worse outcomes European country besides U.K. Spain. Actually sets Huawei apart Chinese phone makers Huawei actually designs chips phones. Huawei Kirin chips considered top end smartphone chip, comparable Apple series chips, Qualcomm Snapdragon (which Android phones use), arguably better Samsung's Exynos chips.

The chinese phone makers mainly assemble phones third party components, Huawei develops uses proprietary tech, mostly US government intent banning Huawei costs. Huawei far biggest threat US/European dominance chip silicon technology. It‚Äôs rushed vaccines there‚Äôs credible peer reviewed evidence showing vaccines suppress transmissibility. 

There bunch people online spreading misinformation vaccines suppress transmissibility, thus taking issue protecting others.

The reason masks still needed vaccines don‚Äôt actually work way vaccines traditionally have. explains developed quickly. mean we're completely fucked, patients sent LA.

What people realizing much fucking people's ability pay bills here. pay fines tax payer money haha devastating news. average life expectancy Nigeria 55, doctors probably young. would suggest strain killing young people higher rate seeing,  FoLlOwInG ScIeNcE

Transmission studied atleast Oxford vaccine. pfizer secondary end point testing positive virus. Transmission studied vacci don‚Äôt think BoJo ever said ‚Äòlet rip‚Äô, may mistaken pay fines tax payer money haha People absolutely are, understandably. yeah, it'll dark winter beauty earth. Including ocean, forest mountains everything between. taste energy get coffee tea morning. sound music wake hungover. Love, friendship sadness. Burritos. There‚Äôs lots live for. Call hotline talk someone, darkest times light soon. gotta find reasons, chief, I'm sure they're look them. Put eyes road ahead instead staring abyss. That's always case necessarily binary ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know much 50% was, whether 60%, 70% 80%, it‚Äôs levels allow us reduce impact disease population,‚Äù

So exact number known, reminds Astra vaccine. 64% 92%... ever get final answer? think averaged 75% I'm sure vaccines varies depending individual. Either way threshold value. Dwight ignorant slut people like immunosuppressants vaccine much less effective all. don‚Äôt unless think it‚Äôs thing life happy.

do honestly think 19-20 year olds know certain? Let's face it, every doctor doctor found one true love profession. lot resources late teens. anyone know krogers 35 states injecting people kroger operates 35 states krogers give vaccine? Wording title article confusing. it‚Äôs not. Oh come bubba. interesting enough stick around see ends? Yeah IB take insane intelligence get into. 

Step 1) Go target school, harvard yale princeton etc.

Step 2) maintain shit GPA

Step 3) network

Step 4) work ass off

The defining trait IB insane hours. people 2 year round branching hedge funds private equity.  cases Covid United states realy accelerated around Nov 1. either probably mutated mutated strain England made way United States. go argument I've given increases social pressure others compliant (though back required) rule population density, like NYC spring. America fire. Everyone problems self inflicted America. Korea literally 50 times America Proud state! anyone looking Colorado numbers, also nasty spike late November early December gone back down. Hospitalizations dropped like rock. Hopefully that‚Äôll last one, we‚Äôll one first places vaccinate enough people. someone help out. Seems like isn‚Äôt taking covid seriously enough he‚Äôs making good points support stopping mink farming way see US gov supporting now. happy denounce wet markets countries like comes US A, heaven forfend something cost business single $. leaves likely move requiring vaccine future monitoring continued spread possible mutations. Interesting! Good luck studies Would surprised IMO. LA county population density pretty low, optics aside California pretty conservative since March also high uptick mask wearing, warm weather, basically public transportation, something weird going on. Haha always grass greener either side. think biggest trap job postings simply say ""Software Engineer"" without distinction either front end/webdev back end. Meaning, fullstack expects sides coin random times, that's one I'm in. wish one back/front end could focus ah well.

My work's terrible get extremely annoying times. Periods chill periods hair pulling existential crises.

My company demands high level giving shit code (guessing Faang ones well), good/bad sides. personally would prefer freaking less it, coworkers another story.

Have worked primarily startups career, mid/larger companies?

Interviewing biggest pain ass lol. keep blanking know needs practice. go-to method leetcoding/interview practice every time apply?

Anyways sorry got bit ""scrutinizing-ey"" üòÖ force habit. pretty well thought-out dude. find interesting many opted Adults want. Good luck though! Beginning think I'm group... ""Many people saying"" got source amazingly correct outsmarting harvard? nutritional expert here, absolutely 100% believe everything say, course. Exactly! Nothing closed one following orders. Lol I‚Äôll take invite zoom meeting extract proof needed. I‚Äôm willing invest way much time asshole üòÇ Yeah like billionaires can‚Äôt afford 15th yacht mean Italy look like model September. blindsided huge initial wave able bring virus control keep way 6 whole months. didn‚Äôt know would soon massive second wave. zoom calls. lol advice theoretical hypothesis something happened again? think people infected already wear masks too? can't deal people like time. much. goalposts originally stop hospitals overburdened. 99%+ hospitals, goal accomplished. Yet many states still locked down. don‚Äôt even know goal posts anymore. convinced Counter Strike. average redditor know anything beyond WFH get pizzas delivered days. that's theyre physically incapable reading beyond headline seeing actually reasonably UAW, represents 150,000 workers employed General Motors, Ford Fiat Chrysler, said companies largely stuck precautions protocols. took seriously flatten curve back March

Why medical system beef capacity hold side bargain? sure controversial opinion around but, really think mental health angle sufficiently thought about. felt like public health officials brushed considerations. buy ""better quarantine mental illness loved ones die mentally ill anyway"", felt like never said. recall back March seeing memes put crudely basically going ""how bored/miserable quarantine, there's Netflix!!!"", memes asserted early concerns considered sufficiently give shit anti-vaxxers point. likely people walking around without mask downplaying virus months months. vaccinated people wound infecting harm themselves, karma would start seem little bit real. THATS argument?!? It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre early days thing. like people curling gutter die found yet. We‚Äôve come long way unreported deaths. response many people reported didn‚Äôt actually die COVID? many people would died common flu year due old age severe chronic illness COVID found first? 

You statistically mathematically flawed. 4/5 havent diagnosed yet far stretch, get training emergency medical care. Stop moving goalposts. Wishing best.  What's big deal, viruses supposed mutate one even deadlier so, what's concern exactly? staying home worried. staying home yes? viruses mutate, SARS-CoV2 mutates rate slower influenza HIV error correction mechanism works transcribes RNA. However given widely spread likely thousands different genetic variations now. Thing vast majority mutations really change much virus. three mutations far considered significant change virus' behavior: one early Europe comprises cases world. One Denmark came Mink farms, one.

It's likely variants require new vaccine. one thing part virus vaccines target (the spike) highly conserved needs particular shape sequence unlock receptor cells. Secondly immune systems make variety antibodies viral fragments presented vaccines target different parts spike. even one area mutates antibodies longer effective, parts spike still targeted. mean, possibly. would still say treatments better there's time somewhat greater bolster healthcare systems (though seem straining still). think areas done poorly, every jurisdiction see could possibly improve 'for next time', ""let rip"" gets BoJo much criticism, others yet still made comment anyway

weird Acellular pertussis vaccines theorized potentially stop infection animal models. confirmed, factual. hypothesis. Also like others pointed out, there's course differences bacteria vs viral vaccine. also brings ethical delima lot workers.

If someone shows car accident know person saved, work move covid patient really improving, essentially meaning covid patient 100% die. tacos tacos! going close borders shit hits fan three months after. Old news. Succession season three baby Fun fact- 

(High) Red meat consumption tends correlated smoking, lower quality diet otherwise, higher alcohol consumption. control various lifestyle factors risk factor red meat specifically stomach cancer- exactly leading cause death.

What means find glut observational studies virtually dietary intervention studies support point.

Done wrong yet? what? remember article think WP September saying Italy model management pandemics.

Gotta give Conte, absolute m0ron good PR apparatus. enough time world meet demand race grifting. Oh wow, really??? never realized way North. norm? tell why?   Yeah. sooo many people much activity traveling regions. think Californians generally cautious also tend active social wouldn‚Äôt surprised epicenter new variant virus. Fortunately death rate seem caught massive spike cases (it much worse back summer less cases). Maybe deaths spike soon hope it‚Äôs less lethal.
It‚Äôs also worth noting SoCal, many communities dense living situations, particularly among migrants immigrants. people realize neighborhoods it‚Äôs common 2, 3, 4 families single home. don‚Äôt mean multi generations; mean four entire families living different rooms. Latino/immigrant factor huge many people don‚Äôt fully appreciate that. pop actually even bigger reported many undocumented people live here, whether temporarily not. California wild place best thought large diverse country. ofc higher.

how many blokes thought ''am good others die''? Italy actually deaths US per capita. Imagine born 1900.
When 14
World War begins
and ends 18 years old
with 22 million dead.

Shortly after, global pandemic
Flu called 'Spanish' "",
kills 50 million people.
You come alive free
You 20 years old.

Then, 29, survive global economic crisis started collapse New York Stock Exchange, causing Inflation, Unemployment, Hunger.

At 33, nazis come power.
You turn 39 World War II starts ends 45 Holocaust (Holocaust), 6 million Jews die.
There 60 million deaths total.

When 52, Korean War begins.

At age 64, Vietnam War begins ends age 75

A boy born 1985 thinks grandparents idea difficult life is, survived several wars disasters.

A boy born 1995 25 years old thinks end world Amazon package takes three days arrive get 15 likes photo posted Facebook Instagram. ....

In 2020, many us live comfortably, access different sources home entertainment, often need.

None existed before.
But survived far disastrous circumstances never lost joy living.
 #truthbetold take seriously. know that.

We're running clock now, best ignore dead bodies piling everywhere. guess I‚Äôm fucked aye, seeing I‚Äôm reading every comment Mike Myers/Shrek Scottish accent. never learned scientific method grade school take it? original outbreak. wife's ICU states running gloves. Falls within pandemic approach. lie get people what's right (or case best interest) make either understand, listen take seriously enough. data drives approach degree need bend truth. I'm sure cardiovascular organ damage inflicted lot survivors going ongoing story rest lifetimes. took eight hours get seen Burbank ER pandemic tho 

Fucking agony. developing countries. Medical workers US also dying.   covid, vaccine still help reduce toll virus? facts worked better lies America, telling damn truth might actually work. admissions files weekly, true. it‚Äôs easy noise sort. Minimum gpa experience volunteer work? Nahhhh. I‚Äôm still looking best files. boss mafia boss. Can't shit that. ‚ÄújUsT fLu, bRo!‚Äù Welcome world. People clearly trusted logic, reason intelligence. wants win.  Come let‚Äôs get vaccines rolling! evidence that, anything children less dangerous flu. Thanks merry Christmas! AOC showed us ""me first"" approach morally justified here, no? ...where think CDC gets numbers? 

From CDC FAQ get numbers:

CDC reports COVID-19 case counts, deaths, laboratory testing numbers daily online. #Data COVID-19 website CDC‚Äôs COVID Data Tracker based recent numbers reported states#, territories, jurisdictions. Data dependent jurisdictions‚Äô timely accurate reporting. Yes similar things happened NYC. hardest hit hospitals ones neighborhoods essential workers. weeks overrun. 

Even Mt Sinai, prestigious hospital located Madison Fifth Avenue Upper East side, volunteer group set tent hospital Central Park tents around entrance. Every hospital around tents front ambulances stacked - much worse less affluent areas. Something similar happened guy lived old neighborhood, kind accident work (he fireman) coma weeks came Scottish Irish accent. Where? education free, healthcare free child care affordable government subsidised. Public transport cheap too. way get debt buying house can't pay off. reading article posting nonsense? Right now, course public health agency says it‚Äôs alright take mask off, mass vaccination, that‚Äôll different story. 0.002% eg. 300 million still 600 thousand... read article, I'm lazy, I'm sure basically speech impediment, brain got fucked. remember watching documentary years years ago people kind brain trauma, ""developed"" accents. One woman happen due severe migraines. documentary talked speech impediment.

On side note, really fucked lives people, people around thought faking. You‚Äôre right, bad regarding In-N-Out. accelerated timeline 2 weeks could mean coworker went home infected elderly relatives home coworkers nursing/medical facility. Onset symptoms typically function viral load contact. Sad situation around regardless. info useless without context, lockdowns played huge role mental health decline people, fact it‚Äôs common among people got Covid doesn‚Äôt mean Covid contributed lockdowns. Everyone lockdowns equally, everyone got Covid equally. could lockdowns main contributor getting Covid made worse, could lockdowns didn‚Äôt affect anything Covid huge impact. quote article doesn‚Äôt prove lockdowns weren‚Äôt main contributor yeah, exactly. ?????

Do know straw man is? previous poster asked identify vaccine didn‚Äôt stop transmission. said pertussis, isn‚Äôt caused virus, it‚Äôs false equivocation. pointed out, sending back drawing board evidence.  work forces, burn crosses. want live life fear, doesn‚Äôt mean people can‚Äôt read...


It‚Äôs people like fucking problem here...

I say sincerely...drop dead... -L Ron Hubbard 1952 vanishingly rare instances, sure. brush couple days. Yeah definitely admitted lied. tries make sound nicer saying new day coming follows saying knew people wouldn‚Äôt agree higher immunity % vaccines started rolling out. guess mean next week.

No need guessing, open article within two lines know exactly week mean. Umm, NY one highest per capita death rate USA. Whatever newyork doing, definitely following example. Even places like Georgia fully opened way back summer better rate better example follow. 100 million, think experimental purpose. This. Right along ""masks matter"" lie last spring. finding long immunity lasts. vaccines need boosters. pronounced Glaswegian. essential worker go time though, like I'm missing much couple restaurant visits total per year. people go bars such. people live alone maybe bad course industry throttled, beside go work, eat, watch TV, sleep, go work... ever really. Issue fine biz take away liquor licenses. Defining enforcing acceptable private residence much harder... Yeah, even adults move English speaking countries/regions pick bit accent. really aren‚Äôt faking either, we‚Äôre social animals want say things like people around us do. It‚Äôs totally unintentional time. 

I friend live Australia three years came mostly sounded American weird hybrid. go away though FWIW. r/nottheonion time China knee (the first doctors suspected) already over. US fairly quick ban, large number cases europe.

During next pandemic reflex 'ban travel country X' 'all travellers anywhere need quarantine week'. Travellers evade targeted bans enough info track infection was. need blanket rules. Choice fine, choices infringe others. We're lucky moon nothing Covid confirm culture everywhere.

So cancer. What's point ?

Also, HUGE part culture (music) happens mostly come people ""imported"" forcefully. Awesome, I'm excited see Update CDC tomorrow many vaccines administered total. havent updated count since early Wednesday, update include vaccinations Wednesday, Thursday today. honestly, deaths hospitalizations sink people 70 get it, would point restrictions?

&amp;#x200B;

With majority hospitalizations 95% deaths coming people 75, real possibility COVID less deadly automobile flu come March. Get ready 5000 dead per day soon! No, didn‚Äôt many people die. didn‚Äôt need shut borders plan people flood virus ridden Europe March. dozens glaring mistakes government made, bad people didn‚Äôt want wear masks thought hoax. must live around lot people live earshot NYC massacre. Neat! take next wave COVID variants seriously first one, we're totally fucked. think practical thing better masks can. Get people cloth masks masks use electrostatic filtering least make disposable masks fit tightly.

From I've seen cupped masks form kind real seal around persons mouth. 

Social distance lot harder make work masks masks easier improve social distancing part, unless big spread country rule following citizens perhaps can't swing better masks.

At least manage numbers like good testing contact tracing... maybe course VACCINE COMING. gonna lie lmao Bad idea thing getting pandemic weekly appointments therapist. 

Good weeks, get progress done ‚Äî brainspotting, inner child work, etc. 

Bad weeks, discuss week her, covid dealing me. 

I would bad place without her. 

Mental health needs considered cared like physical health. 

Down stigmas. caring, growth compassion.  think likely Fauci impetus, global pandemic drastic clear need medical professionals caused this. spent months rightfully calling heroes, Even enlisted still residency fill roles hospitals.

I could Fauci, think likely global pandemic. I'm exhausted confused trying understand repercussions covid personal life, occurred pandemic wiping medical professionals developing countries. devastation take decades recover from. LMAO what!!!!!!!! get undereye fillers next week. Nooo.... decide what's important. looks life. Stay tuned ya'll think illusions fact earning potential delayed people go medicine. Doctors never rich friends go finance, goal chose wrong profession. Maybe standards different think possible live comfortably making 250k year managing 250k educational debt. Damm... least 9 million cases Damm... least 9 million cases says conspiracy fool Anecdotally, happened niece. raised Peppa Pig definitely British accent. last paragraph presents interesting question.

While work big tech work tech essential business. pretty good March getting nonessential employees home. I've keep couple folks office support rest essential folks initially struggle going bring in. time went people volunteering come coming anyway.

When things started getting really bad Sept Nov, pull team together force people office. People sick working home literally instruct people come office.

I'm willing bet people get back office they'll rush so. like coworkers, think separated long periods time actually pretty draining people starting appreciate that. question stick people eventually gravitate towards working remotely again. ultimate dad joke 2019 big year me. got girlfriend, band roll job picking up. sudden see other, things music got screeching halt. anxiety got worse. manage, try soldier on, really taxing struggle cope healthy ways. hope soon. there's really much helping otherwise, least that's feel. you‚Äôre paying $150K undergrad, you‚Äôre wrong. Yeah per board, big bad counties aren‚Äôt progressive anti masks. Incidentally it‚Äôs progressive area LA county hospitals ‚Äúoverloaded‚Äù completely agree you. wrote reminds phrase ""people get government deserve"". I‚Äôm sick called noble lies health experts. greatly erodes trust big factor masks vaccine politicized. tell damn truth support data, people aren‚Äôt ready believe it. Lying changing story later inspire faith next time comment. interesting see happens China. Even assuming numbers massaged, impressive life mostly back normal almost everyone else hanging hoping vaccine. (I imagine conspiracy theories creates actually good government, since fuels myth unstoppable power.) Whatever causing everyone else lose control either affect China, covered (if that's possible). maybe turn they're something right one else doing, trouble believing that.

If turns different strains COVID transmissible others, could also explain seemed spreading slowly part world countries quick decisive enough take action early. (This obviously take away success South Korea's government keeping transmission low.) Oy vey Yeah I'm sitting home Christmas grandma went casino. article partially true. Orange County, friend, surgeon, non covid related surgeries nearly back back. place like Apple Valley, Hispanic community broadly infected, means full hospitals, ICU rest. regional, general. know, bet Santa Monica Hospital close full. hospitals farther away lower middle classes, imho uncrowded, thus continue routine surgeries, elective not. Colorado joins Alaska, North Dakota, West Virginia crossing threshold first 1% population vaccinated first dose. like posting talking everyone here. No...he specifically states lied original percentage population needed get get vaccine try get people fence take it...

Now people willing, says actual number higher...

This isn‚Äôt data based...at all... That's good point. definitely get revenge Dr Fauci refusing get vaccine rest us do. You‚Äôll show him. see one person inside that's roommate? took outside mean like, going store whatever.

Of course crazy absolute terms, that's whole point using relative measure allow comparison! people live would feel similar. Hospitals overwhelmed degree (maybe worse without large tertiary hospitals). People know similar number people around got sick died.

I think bit extreme r/bayarea Maybe education process streamlined. Cuba produces medical doctors per capita US -- yet US far wealthier.

Regardless much Trump interfered failed every aspect Covid virus completely controls America.

He nothing make occasional mild mannered speeches tv. already mental disorder seniority . It‚Äôs like mentor thing movie human centipede It‚Äôs mainly issue system capacity. Nearly hospitals liquid bulk oxygen supply. liquid oxygen cold, run vaporizers (think something like radiator) warm goes back gas phase. oxygen gas piped hospital. bulk systems designed handle certain volume, pull much fast (like ton vent patients once) systems freeze liquid isn‚Äôt given enough time warm up. happened hospitals near spring. solutions, though I‚Äôm unsure equipment even available point pandemic. 

Many hospitals using high pressure cylinders (what see urgent cares often larger sized) h excess demand. cylinders changed often vent patients limited supply available. also limited supply medical oxygen cylinders regulators needed operate them. much demand oxygen way deliver utilize basically. looked vaccine actually does...

It‚Äôs literally first vaccine it‚Äôs type thereby evidence safe long term...and also can‚Äôt prove prevents spreading disease suffering asymptotic case...

And Fauci admits lying, comes declares evidence long term safety...or prevent spreading virus...I can‚Äôt trust him... Lol. Med school costs 70k per year. even joking. wife graduated med school 2008 we‚Äôre still paying loans. talking earlier week, remember? going sneak onto Fort Carson steal healthcare workers‚Äô vaccine deserved them...how already forget? i‚Äôm selective mute pandemic made lose lot progress made. could speak small bit towards strangers shop i‚Äôm back completely unable talk anyone aside close family.

(Hey, gotta find silver lining can!) I‚Äôm really starting think continuous propaganda innocent. lied this. Herd immunity unknown number virus. know viruses 70% reasonable number aim for. But...it may high 90%.

This run issues dealing protecting public health. public want hear scientists speak, want numbers. look say 70% enough data show number sound. Sound mean correct.

You also know need keep public interested right thing vaccine developed. time idiots claiming herd reached 20% already achieved it.

So public health know know herd reached know it‚Äôs 20%. say 70% give people number seems achievable. vaccine number get stupid antivaxers well African American population get need lot reach herd protects cannot vaccinated.

It‚Äôs complicated keep public cannot handle truth. yeah would make sense increase CNA applicants something stretch mom RN wouldn‚Äôt allow get vaccine seafood latex allergies.

Even though vaccines now, they‚Äôre still scared shitless. Stay home. lot people take seriously, it‚Äôs you. doesn‚Äôt sound like careful all. Didn‚Äôt go date today? use zoom couldn‚Äôt sneak Fort Carson steal vaccine? one reasons import doctors overseas -- allow AMA limit many educated here.

My understanding AMA also limits number foreign educated doctors get license ‚Äî quite severely. hope everyone good Christmas ride happiness 2021 crush thing. lies this...what else lying about? 

Is lying we‚Äôll able get back normal hit 85% 95%? going get back normal he‚Äôs lying well?


In theory, easily converted taking vaccine...

I‚Äôm left Bernie don‚Äôt fit political mold someone wouldn‚Äôt take vaccine...

I find science fascinating believe global warming biggest threat humanity scientists tell so...

But also tell 34, Covid isn‚Äôt much threat 2nd shot likely knock ass...

The real incentive take vaccine desire get back normal...but since admits lying, currently hope taking vaccine help regard...

And self identified left wing science lover problems this...how many people right changed stance getting vaccine? think read somewhere Australian guy learnt bit Mandarin school something woke without primary language English. returned later iirc. Good, going need lot replacements killed current medical professionals.

Thanks stepping fresh lambs... That‚Äôs completely unrealistic expectation. never approach 90 percent vaccination rate, ever. People A) don‚Äôt take vaccines religious reasons B) don‚Äôt take vaccines allergy health reasons C) don‚Äôt take vaccines don‚Äôt trust them

You‚Äôll wearing mask rest life.

In 4 months seeing somebody wearing mask going rare, whether like Yeah he‚Äôs trash bastardd would beat ass you. example, matching residency program devastating. Doctors killed it. Thank you. well. I'm currently laying cuddling one fur babies. glad always something consistent. :).

Stay safe. here. mention suffered broken engagement March, put bottom, I've nowhere go year except upwards. lot working confident I'm longer suffering depression I've felt life. I'm happier friendlier just.....good. Things good continue get better me. That‚Äôs residency, no? full doctor control amount hours work. take way seriously people barley left house. Don‚Äôt talk loosely goose get strange feeling China using it‚Äôs vaccine gain allies strengthen it‚Äôs position certain countries. hope I‚Äôm terribly wrong this... You‚Äôre right, don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs commercial tests cells available fish caught covid? *serious question* Blatant misinformation. Downvote. don‚Äôt think LA‚Äôs massive problems blamed washed Hollywood actor. residents LA don‚Äôt give shit virus anymore, plain simple. ""okay, medical condition, serve outside then."" think applications school go pretty much economic downturns. Teachers good call schools disarray right now. worry students getting transferring parents schools open though.  sure friend. 24-hour clinic around could get Oxygen levels checked? December probably 30-50% worse November deaths. CDC = 1.01 million 

Bloomberg = 1.23 million 

Both shots administered Antibodies detected symptomatic asymptomatic patients least 5 months post-diagnosis. decrease lot first month still detectable. research pre-immunity antibody test show results T-Cells? I'm eating weed edibles like popcorn get nightmare. Eh, go tech. Way easier. Faang companies pay new grad juniors close 200k. 5 years 300k. uncommon clear 700k+ decade career. Even don‚Äôt get faang you‚Äôll almost guaranteed 150-250k year rest life. 

I spent life 13 30 stoned mind, fell ass backwards company IPO rocket shipped covid, nothing complicated send slack messages computer equivalent connecting legos, clear money year parents made decade.

Is going last forever? No, I‚Äôll prob back 200-250k years depending stock refreshers, someone 2.1 gpa general studies whose math goes far basic algebra, there‚Äôs way would make near much amount work. Yah that‚Äôs going happen. People don‚Äôt wear vaccine, sure shit won‚Äôt wear after. Probably also ducking college program financial aid pretty good move right ‚Äú One individual‚Äù 

you don‚Äôt seem capable extrapolating number.  Maybe that‚Äôs Americans can‚Äôt stay away other. Let‚Äôs pray away Stockton. get scared hearing word. well million people got mRNA shot, nobody died. severe allergic reactions apparently rare enough make headlines.

That's pretty good news, things considered. psychiatric morbidity? abstract says one prevalent disorders, can't find good definition disorder is. vaccines covid make people turn zombies, eat underwear too. Well, since I'm planning getting vaccine, I'll probably eat brain too, I'm betting snack sized based ""rushed"" comment. Usually not. usually hang garages porches middle night. happier also basically guaranteed make residency chosen field

This incorrect makes weep. Residency matching highly competitive highly compensated fields like ortho top. need top class competitive (and remember everyone got medical school essentially top college class) saw really good episode House tho wanted doctor? I've lost patience... disorder? Air made nitrogen oxygen (21%) (and elements like argon carbon dioxide). Medical grade oxygen 99.98% oxygen, tested ensure meets standards. 

Most hospitals run bulk liquid oxygen tanks, liquid run vaporizers warm piped hospital. Drawing much, fast, freeze system (the liquid doesn‚Äôt get enough time warm up). happened several hospitals area spring surge. 

Hospitals also high pressure cylinders need refilled often many medical oxygen cylinders regulators circulation. large high pressure oxygen tank doesn‚Äôt last long vent patients, isn‚Äôt ideal way handle increased demand. Basically demand gets high, oxygen way deliver it. ton doctors retiring early year!! storage experienced staff real newer surveys said 60 percent would take it

This literally measure public perception used data shift policy.... friend‚Äôs mom made start 5th grade. 

But friends Med school started freshman year hs planning. think that‚Äôs normal. 5th grade bs prob abuse. Poor friend. didn‚Äôt actually get medical school either. people wanting epidemiologist! Yeah, that: think one individual less big impact herd immunity... Lockdowns don‚Äôt work apparently. Sad! Yes lmao. Many pre-reqs. think article think it‚Äôs dumb haha Wait, you‚Äôre gonna make something wonder it‚Äôs downvoted? You‚Äôre one facing shit numbers response this. you‚Äôre ignoring it. Maybe big fan President? Seems like two similar mindsets it. like temporary, know vaccinated people carry spread covid need wear masks vast majority vaccinated happen within next year. yes made fact cannot communicate without incivility perfectly clear.

now gotta wait mods job. reddit admins step deaths threats first! either way it'll win humanity! Inspired worst COVID response planet? wrong, they're detectable least 6 months out, likely much longer. Yes, since he's honest good intentions, meaning lie benevolent nature. People like tricked even benefit comes makes look dumb. also med school require prereqs? applicants people already considering potential career path right speed increase drastically January That's like Birmingham...the one Alabama one England. time. We‚Äôre losing influence authoritarian communist China commit human rights atrocities twist arms everyone.

No shit America could better. worst power? No, obviously China Russia worse. poorer less educated corrupt authoritarian. argument. well long take build supplies? agree completely. think lot people r/bayarea likely karma farming, similar many like brag left house since March.


I'm hoping get vaccine 30%ish population March/April. point really see shitty virus chance, especially given mild seasonality (as saw US past summer). keep vaxxing thru summer there's way it'll issue weather cools fall. group people friends family fall one group died? hear one age 120 years age died that's group maybe lucky.  üòÜ üòÇ üòõ 

Go back new normal bruh 60-70 hours humble underestimation. Current MS3 observing workload residents get through. variants place. There‚Äôs lot specific answers let give major one.......they‚Äôre afraid getting sued. healthcare system absolutely fractured right now. let's continue allow/encourage people break guidelines :) test high risk people

You correct, checked paper, good known. Strangely enough, incredibly self-centered ignorant probably fine. probably going frequently, constantly seeing others, etc. I‚Äôm trying avoid goal posts moved letting vaccinated people go back normal. You‚Äôre one moving goalposts insisting EVERYONE continues follow measures even vaccinated Ironic you‚Äôre bitching social media platform. problem virus people get mild cold symptoms days recover fine. can‚Äôt expect people drastically alter life hide year straight. frank, nobody gives fuck somebody else‚Äôs frail grandparent immunocompromised relative. It‚Äôs human nature. Banana bread I've met anti Vax anti Western medicine nurse. Find infected covid /that strain isolate them. Basically trying prevent strain getting country seem futile Less lower initial dose- fewer symptoms feel UK better prepared Italy Spain. may Anglo-centric seems like economically health care system ready deal pandemic better Spain Italy. Catch it? also call family doctor. Though shortness breath wasn‚Äôt best example. large percentage people call ambulance don‚Äôt need one. 50/50 really see catch keep spreading interest Covid bad possible sub becomes irrelevant. Plus they're probably actual shills shady agenda, whether China backed corp owned China. way Reddit, one largest sites world, would let Coronavirus sub anything bunch highly curated, manufactured, fake propaganda. You‚Äôre following conversation.

Protein ‚Äúsupplements‚Äù

If mean whey supplements require... animals!

If mean plant proteins, they‚Äôre poorly absorbed provided studies citing poor bioavailability.

The problem vegan vegetarian diets lead people poor physiological reserve (low muscle) positions horribly get sick injured.

Let‚Äôs encourage people sickly pretending American meat industry reason Chinese wet market diseases... really don‚Äôt know BoJo treated worse leaders Italy Spain. 

Well, actually know zero management pandemics. time June July comes around people settle going hurt they'll take vaccine. They're scared right couple months people okay it. Yeah ever get close 100% need around 70% herd immunity think that's possible July hopefully. like 45% population want take vaccine right now...means need change 15% people yes think happen see giving bad reactions. 40% didn‚Äôt need first place.

But you‚Äôre 100% quote may need rewording. assume meant say everyone hospital dying. 100% people hospital aren‚Äôt dying. Good right thing. despite already knowing new strain back September. delay allowed UK strain spread much have. always struggled depression anxiety, since pandemic I‚Äôve noticed don‚Äôt something day zone hours end. Like I‚Äôll stare wall, goes 3 hours blink eye. Salvini response know portrayal would be. US would given Emmy. birthday! truly hope things mostly normal then. Sorry selfish second vaccine kicks resuming normal life every possible way. I‚Äôve done part hardly left house since March. ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù articles fuck right main talking point antivaxx idiots. Going dark January think February defibrillator March start seeing huge impact vaccines + natural immunity Why? Explain like ""Church"" Scientology. Except went extra mile threatening IRS thousands lawsuits unless granted religion status. California absolutely baffling right now. terrible job updating numbers I, too, shellfish allergy. asthma.

So need vaccinated. 

But EpiPen. Hope need one. People wonder healthcare costs much. can‚Äôt speak services, emergency services, covering portion people can‚Äôt pay. also use ambulance taxi ER family doctor. I‚Äôve literally tell smugly don‚Äôt care much costs cause won‚Äôt pay anyways. sure gradual decent, sercum though! interests big Corps like Amazon Walmart lockdowns remain place, they've posted insane profits massive transfers money small businesses big. orgs buy sell media outlets, shills, whatever else need feed narrative terrified every second life stay inside forever. 

The narrative picked useful idiots raging narcissists get social validation screaming people stay inside times they'll ""kill grandma"". like Reddit post daughter disappointed city took away playground people getting massive upvotes saying ""good stay inside"" evidence point fact active healthy outside incredibly important. raging narcissism really what's crippling us, makes everyone follow easiest ""perceived"" moral high-ground situations. amount pleasure people get yelling people Covid stuff nutty; might well [this top off, indeed dangerous situation, misinformation fucked interests, get shit like [city filling , fucking evil idiots. Nah think actually quotation headlines something. reason like imagined sound says it. think perception, regardless accuracy, BoJo gets harsher treatment though i'm still waiting address articles linked, there's correlation burgers wet markets never claimed (: disorders occurred frequently among infected recovered adults Err... that‚Äôs clinical trials worked?  see I've downvoted 4 times total since posting comment. 

We found fans. everywhere refuse transport. I‚Äôve taken headaches, stubbed toes, wanting pain meds refilled ER. definitely isn‚Äôt thought needed go. Wow 10 million people, care why? Misinformation. Stop supposed mutate one even deadlier so, what's concern exactly?

More cases hospitalizations overwhelmed higher death rates [I talking I've heard directly people live there]
Yeah never lied exeggerate things alternative motive.

All claims [""what heard someone""] without shred evidence, making statements know nothing about. 
Beijing lockdown? LOL sure believe want, argue China subject person actually live China.
PS: know medium-risk-area means? course don't, nearly 330k death U.S yet still blame others wearing mask social-distancing Dec. 2020


Refuse provide facts (""I heard soneone live China""? Haha might well list FOX source, least someone held accountable it)
Provide source outside China argument, yet refuse face deemed ""CCP puppet press"" without looking it. even google page link provided, supposed sources definetely redneck Trumpians white-suprecist bias pigs, hey whatever make happy, whole world watched really happened China, Beijing every meidum cameras hide them.

Talked ""have lot fantasy ideas"" ""have idea hell taking about"", typical redneck Americans lol Time prove braindead stupid americans thanks Trump yet can't help imagine... even controlled eating red meat risk heart disease stomach cancer, eating none getting protein plants supplements necessary would far safer... surely must wrong! somehow! Talk like makes HR demand everyone go back office. compressed oxygen certain ratio gas mix this. scuba cylinders receive non-air oxygen mixes need specially cleaned/degreased non-reactive seals non-reactive lubricants. 
Neat stuff.  course it‚Äôs LA. They‚Äôve flights streaming London months. got load approved legally spending payroll employee working intended. two separate issues treated such. diverting fund load pay fines legal system needs throw book them. Jesus hasn‚Äôt returned. Look every industrialized first world oligarchy, rich murderers first get it. UK 50 times genetic analysis Covid samples USA does. median time genetic analysis 26 days catching late November cases. USA takes 85 days variant might even started wouldn‚Äôt notice till February. imagine living America able feed kids, solid job life year ago. You‚Äôre moving goal posts. wanted people ton carry vaccine card. make card minutes value?

Are trying create world nots? headline dumb. it‚Äôs proven transmissible course reason alarm. don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs going problem. stage virus mutate way issue believe adjust vaccine happens.

Try :-) Maybe ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù many countries. also probably didn‚Äôt originate UK. genomic sequencing many countries picked first. that's right, american farms absolutely innocent. nevermind betting pools covid outbreaks slaughterhouse ptsd muh burger us work living. Staying home option everyone Congress made sure that. well right, one U.S stop protesting anti-mask anti-vax rally, one stop freedom assault others refusing wearing masks.

America, greatest country world sort uncontrolled bleeding (as mentioned video) rare complication COVID, something that's seen rare complication really critically ill patient. inflammatory state/organ failure causes clotting, clotting factors get depleted get bleeding. Known DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation. 4 already mental-disorders. someone runs business advertising end social media. absolutely true.

Social media engages threat detection systems. Imagine 1,000 posts read hour. Well, can‚Äôt possibly read them, do? 

You rank order focus top using views, likes, follows, upvotes, etc. gets upvoted? basic video putting together kid‚Äôs pack ‚Äòn play. makes top extreme negative positive post / pictures / videos. Why? tells us deadly threats competitive threat are. that‚Äôs actually care about. feel like tech companies, maybe nature flexible welcoming change type industry, trusting WFH first place. Many flexible policies even covid (ie one day week could work home) lots virtual collaboration place already. hand, company already huge problem working home covid. simply wasn‚Äôt thing ceo disapproved it. company waited long possible allow working home even though we‚Äôre based office work computers anyway. no, i'm fan trump all

everyone ""shit numbers"" don‚Äôt care employees, care liability. essential worker go time though, like I'm missing much couple restaurant visits total per year. people go bars such. people live alone maybe bad course industry throttled, beside go work, eat, watch TV, sleep, go work... ever really. pay $100 wear mask entire day. everyone seems conveniently omit last part

Yeah shit make it. communists play dirty trade let sell directly HK, go one companies. real need frankly. someone dealt depression (that helped could see friends) also extreme social anxiety living generally like introvert would expected to, Ive felt bad realizing many people experiencing I‚Äôve experience years time. year hard actually think I‚Äôve made healthy mental strides.   This!!! üëÜüëÜ drink daily deal stress dealing people job it‚Äôs gotten even stressful as... people stressed It‚Äôs Australia. Aussies families could return 14 day quarantine (changed hotel quarantine many people didn‚Äôt follow rules). still set now. new variant arrived already (in hotel quarantine). realize people's livelihoods collapsing months. Im justifying following mask mandates right come time willing let go even thats slightly early. say close minded understand views see wrong can‚Äôt flatten exponential item period. either squash completely moment loosen up, goes back exponential. think factories produce either food cars? factory running driving pandemic greedy consumers wait little longer like couple decades ago.

It's 2 weeks instead 2 days. That's big sacrifice. they're verbally abused people they're incubated can't Covid hoax. 

Nice know pandemic 10s millions Americans denied reality selfish shit. Maybe Australian media taking information Guardian. That‚Äôs Italian media outlets do. cunt. Welcome fucking party. Maybe stop mocking mental health, funding funds mental help, idea, FIX FUCKING VA VETS STOP BLOWING HEADS VA PARKING LOTS EVERY WEEK. Big lol every sub acting like it‚Äôs likely vaccine longer work folks like Derek lowe TWIT scientists say it‚Äôs highly unlikely Americans: Grow Buddhism indeed teach virtues, everybody puts theory practice point. mean ‚ÄòBuddhist culture‚Äô hasnt done much Rohingya. 

Also Vietnam State Atheist equally venerable Confucian heritage. Considering success Confucian State Atheist societies East Asia likely influence.

These sorts conclusions dangerous though would like saying Poland better England Catholicism. Yep Wow, ripoff. thought $40 flu shot steep. kind comment came for! Upvote you. Meanwhile GAD really acting doctor giving shit asking Xanax half month early. Hot showers, working Sleepytime Tea lifesaver. I‚Äôm intelligent people usually I‚Äôm right.

Wow sad friend‚Äôs parents. mean yeah seems start super young like there‚Äôs issues home. disappointed ‚Äúwrong‚Äù Med school think that‚Äôs def proof parents alright. Fitness mag? Let's stop talking 12 yr old.  Well... four you... hope happy. took bullet time. Worst anxiety back March gave up. I'm constantly around people care getting sick whole family sick I'm waiting inevitable still taking many precautions can. may effect normal number people change mind follow dropped dramatically. idea account shift not, thought. One kid patient needed transport took 6 hours 2 miles Away. super urgent. told drive kid here. 
There ambulances around. LA county Yup mostly. 5th grade friend was. point, want touch somebody. closer 4 weeks, need ""fully"" effective start protecting people. 50% effectiveness one week first dose still save lot lives. applaud willingness LIVE despite possibility serious side effects. wish best, wish health. Yep. People underestimating important first little bit vaccine is.

Nursing home residents make less half percent US residents, account \~40% covid deaths. 


They're tied first priority states health-care workers, they're easiest vaccinate they're right inside facilities.

By end January, COVID 40% less deadly US (and elsewhere) Pretty sure disorders already there, society ignored whole. exposed psychotics they‚Äôve always spotlight straight them, public, mental breakdowns every day mask wearing miserable hate filled lives.

The fact noticed insane asylum top prospects troubling me. I‚Äôve seen years. mention one mutations I‚Äôm reading becoming virulent. username like that, sure will. requires people think greater good.

A lot testing involved various computer programs amassing sufficient data, helping accumulate readings run calculations, controlling tests per computer program, etc. 

Y2K started approaching decided EVERY computer program audited. lab--the smallest lab rather small department--alone easily 20 programs. 

So auditors come show programs (written HPL early 1980s), COURSE printed reference. shocked. best programs company--the programs already taken account Y2K. written complete genius; written able read *from* damn print-out, problem test portion repeated, could found reading TITLE portion program. printed program headings various portions! Goddamn hate man. wish believed hell charlatans. 

Anyway. tax write off... would cover income taxes least chunk them? like magically give donation money back (or they), really what'd advantage start personal church? see much money churches bring banks, seems like it'd safer bet starting one running business remove taxes. Absolutely (ref first sentence). BIL beat Covid, died sepsis treatments. 

And herd immunity thing slippery, too. instance, take situation multiple person household individuals don‚Äôt follow safe practices. mixing outside house general community, one individual becomes infected statistical certainty household members also become infected. Also, like-minded individuals tend run social circles; complication. Source? That‚Äôs common knowledge. don‚Äôt know think it‚Äôs race... Merry Christmas, everyone! Stay safe!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* already knew hundreds variants vaccine tested them. variant UK first newsworthy variant differed way matters policymakers notably infectious. Nothing would make immunity issue. seems likely giving doses updated since 21st, frustrating harmful. U.K. slightly wealthier Italy Spain significantly. similar country economically, similar healthcare system also (they three fully public healthcare systems). disappoint truth beneath fantasy American dream. rat race sinking ship. Every man another description sentiment individual liberty important thing. Welcome 2020, already mental disorder, one assigned you. do, made worse.

Enjoy stay. know everybody else, household would probably okay knew staying isolated good reason, part shared sacrifice beat thing.

But fact keep going important life events missed people willing change routines one bit demoralizing, depressing, infuriating, alienating. :( It‚Äôs 10% Tokyo It‚Äôs called excess mortality rates. show way normal mortality rates, even account COVID.

Same story pretty much every country. It‚Äôs unique IS. denying rights non democratic country citizens? Typical. know it‚Äôs better though? Oh, I'm sorry Christmas sucked :( It‚Äôs 1000 year, it‚Äôs 200 per year next 5 years. So? protected wear two masks (surgical underneath cloth one top) work one else around does? feel it‚Äôs hoax refuse wear one. mainly interact individuals outside large open space 15 min time.

Step 5: Profit. History repeats self J&amp;J vaccine similar AZ better likely become massed produced vaccine outside China. I'd take grain salt. made right choice. course you‚Äôre downvoted introverts want new reality. i‚Äôm you. we‚Äôre almost friend. Also, cycle really lasts like May-July/June, yeah future medical student, cannot imagine one peers unrelated field switching medicine whim time current cycle. hygiene, would suspect Islam leading aspect. frequently wash hands feet religious ceremonies. Cleanliness seemed especially important.

Example: bidet shower (god miss things back home...) also likely brought popularized muslims Thailand. Prior that, Thai toilets pretty...filthy.  LOL. realize 99,99999999% People age 69 survive? realize that? 
Why affraid virus survival rate?
I say good luck mRNA vaccine, developed six months. Lol love creative(!) racist people get silly little puns. okay tho never balls openly admit racist real life. loved Nara, almost got attacked wild monkeys there. Good times.

People always think ‚Äúif airlines still flying, must OK travel long (wear mask/wash hands/etc.)‚Äù mention Japan older population us Looks like red serious attitude problem. could reason. fly basically immediate family visited past 3 days. claimed Christmas awful distanced. didn't. sister even travelled state kids still in-person school. saw sets grandparents aunts uncles. think distanced. Even mother works medial field... asked least come house claimed distancing. tell no. got mad claiming understand distancing. 

I'm one see anyone stuck nuclear family, yet family thinks even though saw other. Well one (the main one, Dark Lord) Alabama. So. Yeah. one born Pennsylvania, raised Texas. responsibility likely could saved life at-risk person encountered passing. worth it. US valued $$$ would done something COVID-19. Individual citizens may disposable herd valuable.

Saying Trump valued $$$ sees citizens disposable excusing incompetence. Yet vaccine called Pfizer vaccine Biontech vaccine. Interesting. irresponsible half glass could kill non-negligible portion half though. reason flight then? area US reach 0 community cases point summer? /s doesn‚Äôt make look less clueless Sweden Homeless shelter? Yea dude, I‚Äôd rather ICU bed really mean that. Rheyre giving 1 20 Christmases. risk assessment we'd rather gramma around see brother cousin get married respective partners, brother graduate highschool, many holidays get next years, opposed one weird holiday everyone feels guilty edge. Sure, guess could die anything, also factored heart wrenching guilt us would feel ones gave her. 6 million people lmao Nah wrong, next stop congress florida state full dumbass republicans, look red tide rick scott questions florida voter. Coronavirus killing people. Willful ignorance selfishness is. Yes, precautions. 'in theory' lots experience date many places world schools linked major contributor spread.

Schools among last thing close flexing restrictions based virus levels. dont get quote 70x infectious would be... something really hard performers associated places businesses past year.

But think come roaring back get broad vaccinations return kind normal. Going listening live music one favorite things really missed it. going make point going least week soon possible foreseeable future. know missing gone. Also forget hate towards China city wide lockdown. Everyone calling act inhuman. Absolutely. Saying ""this terrible"" (in various forms) boring adds nothing conversation. That's downvote button made for. Especially *your* minority Also forget hate towards China city wide lockdown. Everyone calling act inhuman. mean, good time actually implement nationalism.. fuck Trump republicans doing? Oh, forgot, don‚Äôt give shut nation... Well appreciate that, consider fact live world anecdote considered enough commendable, really showing common human decency. Brazil cases soaring summer starts Read article man gave CPR man dying plane covid 178 passengers person administering CPR notified 10 days. 

It‚Äôs shit storm highest level everywhere. Fuck, I‚Äôm idiot. Actual information moved covid19 sub. strict sharing scientific sources, remnants actual discussion occasionally spill here, mostly cesspool whatever. world get group-thinky conclude ""oh like SARS, rush.""

SARS nearly catastrophic pandemic. South African here, although pandemic still something taken seriously strain far seems slightly transmissible causes younger people present symptoms greater proportions 1st wave, investigations morbidity strain still ongoing, seems least different. Can't blame them.

Their president traveling Florida weekly basis. bullshit. Wow really went made whole ass judgement based one objective simple sentence. don‚Äôt need create altercations head strangers. unnecessary cortisol could shorten lifespan. 

If POC, need speak them. going talk what's best POC try silence person color mentioning history medical experimentation? look like white liberal joke. No, it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm open evidence found says otherwise gladly apologize tone. time misinformation. way navigate vaccines effectively 100% transparent facts. Otherwise end people believing wanted believe even started conversation. See they'd complain making light tragedy. year truly shown country beset sides morons, regardless color, creed, political affiliation, etc. haven‚Äôt seen anyone. everyone going home holidays. spread misinformation. may go doctor hospital various reasons try recuperate homes. 6' never magic distance. distance good enough people remember follow. Things like time spent together also effects this.

The probability infected decreases ish square distance. means double distance, decrease chance infection 4x.

If virus infectious need distance ensure ways limiting spread followed ensure reproduction factor dropped amount increased. Glad did. know is. intentional. ;)

Thank taking bait. FDA recently approved home quick test $30 bluetooth sensor didnt want people testing quickly cheaply couldn‚Äôt track it.

Stopped exchange gifts etc. dad already it, mom vaccinated (obviously almost week) brother works home isolated 2 weeks before, wore mask inside whole time. wish people got it. brother kid came exchange gifts put masks entire 30 minutes. went home. really weird. wish people would chill it. little much assume me, no? hadn‚Äôt gotten tests would help don‚Äôt access them? You‚Äôre saying would better get tested all? flying either way. You‚Äôre terribly mistaken think government hasn‚Äôt played biggest role spread Covid.

Bolsonaro makes Trump look like saint You... actually know 'source' means, you? 10/10 recommend getting gored deer bows don‚Äôt deer cookies left. Yeah let people die! exact games alt right racists play. fact, racists ALWAYS played games like this. Makes think they're intelligent people they're arguing with. You‚Äôre adding problem took flight unnecessary matter saw. spent 269 days hospital going take LONG time recover that. work food service industry. Would considered essential frontline? neither? Forced sterilization Indigenous women occurred well 1970s.  think need robust restrictions place, least US, schools would one last activities focus given experts said relative transmission risk, obvious importance schooling. said, overall strategy regard includes prioritization people working schools vaccination want parents shot first quarter. wonder that's feasible. agree. autoimmune disease acts sometimes. struggle drive/walk could successfully work home. I'd rather wfh waste sick day like normally would. Shocking America, employer keep someone employed work almost full year.

Wait that's shocking considering jobs even sick paid time off. yeah that‚Äôs one I‚Äôm aware though Canadians downright ignorant. Flying Trump flags (WTF?)

When Republicans understand things worried comes covid? long term, sometimes permanent effects Covid rare. 

We know lasting ramifications virus years. ""New Variant"" like places using I‚Äôm sure fox afford bums trump administration planning going route. personally see downfalls

Even setting aside mental health impacts, significant, entire industries totally shut right now. example - worked live events shutdowns watched freelance jobs disappear calendar weekend March everything changed. Still waiting come back, I‚Äôm lucky could take another job meantime. people losing everything (in big cities especially, unionized, specialized jobs people went school make living with). You‚Äôre right, Western European media totally unbiased also 100% factual!!! Damn bad. hoping go Taiwan may something similar see Japan H1N1 virus causes swine flu definitely coronavirus. difference society values lives citizens versus one values $$$ sees citizens disposable. capable discussing without sassy. I‚Äôm going respond otherwise. day? definitely potential get sick someone vaccinated all. 48-72 hours later? Probably small maybe measurable reduction chance. 1 week later? Even more
 2 weeks later? Studies seem indicate 60% protected.

The body needs time create antibodies build defense. absolute minimum 3 days. flu vaccine way, 14 days there. Early 45 news conf 2 pharma dudes. bragged would money making opportunity pharma companies. Early military bragged flying plane load tests US nothing heard. Money rules country. US Surgeon General pleading public stop buying face masks ""They effective preventing general public catching #Coronavirus"". HSE. RIP. Weep much exposure time? Oof Brazil

Coronavirus death us part fun sitting home 15 months. Yep. Facebook, IG etc. horrible mental health.

I miss Facebook all. still risk people 2 three day incubation period. 7 days ain't bad. Smallpox existed thousands years made concerted effort inoculate population 1950s eradicated it

How myopic view development scientific medical knowledge

Until late 1800s even know virus beyond ""thing makes sick"", last 20 years alone understanding molecular biology genetics exploded leading lovely groundbreaking developments like RNA vaccines

I'm sure there'll challenges eradicating COVID-19 whether mutations strains vaccine distribution around world compare ""thousands years human history eradicate smallpox"" dumbfounding everyone else strong swimmer. mean normal

*one single party government country it* Sputnik V's claims taken grain salt? Lizard people Mars. agree, one them. Yeah social distancing pretty big concept define. things like social distancing working home more, staying home you‚Äôre sick norm instead going work, overall approach awareness getting better hope. yeah i‚Äôd love go bar man miss shit sister law occupational therapist hospital. comment people focusing death rates Covid said people survive, end pretty wrecked. 

No ones takes consideration. Especially effect financial level patient healthcare. really named ""Piccolo""??

Not healthiest people, kind people expect waiting Death's doorstep recent times.

If decade, they'd least years them. Basic question someone doesnt know medical field detail: 
1. So, doctors end doing?
1. try residency match subsequent years?
1. go outside US get residency done come US? US federal plan genomic testing. universities states, money it. Asking city testing pretty much answers question. already rationing involved. Smokers last line lung transplants. Drinkers last line livers. well established practice. nurse would gladly send recklessly irresponsible back line. discrimination based religion, politics, sex, etc... absolute refusal care. Theyre simply lower priority reason smokers lungs. save one person save responsible one. Nobody traveled get medical care get rona. back line go. long, though? sacrificed year prime, one last years prime, staying home turning antisocial weirdo, unknown long term effects psyche, negatively affected many relationships life, what? Hospitals overwhelmed. Everyone getting sick Xmas followed getting sick NYE means it‚Äôs going everywhere, far beyond stoppable, weeks. What‚Äôs point sacrifice it‚Äôs going take country anyway?

At rate feel like treated like Sweden said fuck still aren‚Äôt effective preventing public catching. 

After infections reached certain point, asymptomatic transmission proven universal wearing masks made sense prevent transmission don‚Äôt prevent individual catching - unless wearing n95. 

We‚Äôve also reduced arguments simplicity, reality level community spread masks simply can‚Äôt stop transmission. Ian McKays Swiss cheese model probably best terms general hygiene stop transmission. difference individualistic collectivist society. straight selfishness corporate greed. Americans selfish obvious pandemic corporations pushing re-open expense expendable working class. Could genetic. don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs definitive answer Yes, definitely comedy errors. 

That excessive focus perfection goes back beginning. first private labs working PCR test protocol, FDA required prove test give false positive SARS MERS. lab called CDC ask sample them, turned they're dangerous. 

We pandemic plan, originally created Bush, refined swine flu ebola. prepared humanly possible, people charge happens decide ignore plans, we're screwed. really need fix division public health responsibilities. theory, states actual power public health issues, states hamstrung beginning lack testing, mostly federal responsibility. Americans never fail amaze sure. I‚Äôm pretty introverted person well I‚Äôm totally fine working home homebody. everyone way, you‚Äôd think could put aside little while. mean, extroverted friends always expect come comfort zones things, can‚Äôt they?

Thanks stupid airline crew. Ruined Australia. Still, job interviews seem awkward...

What's wrong? wish Japan well, tolerate immigration almost kind ways makes much easier osoe borders. real constituency side.

Additionally cultural heritage one obedience following top leadership, (i.e., see pre-WWII history) CERTAINLY helps here.

But heck yeah infectious disease response scenario envy able impose population. One sounds nicer, like hollywood hero. Let‚Äôs honest. You‚Äôre country like pretend there‚Äôs nothing going staying it. Must nice care. God's waiting room, baby I'm admittedly hesitant vaccine, try research much info possible. I'd much prefer type information readily available keep hidden. least absorb info personal risk analysis. Imagine many people would turned vaccine something like hidden June predict vaccine available people? Yeah ones display get stats, alter raw data indirectly alter information based around it. Pretty simple stuff. know mean, discouraging doubt.

But point still valid every contribution matters whole.

As bad sounds, could worse. I've never heard specialists concierge practice full time. know pay enough however make house calls see hours. likely best people want office.

General concierge medicine usually couple hundred month, personally I've wondered worthwhile dedicated physician Yet US cases came Italy. Please donate Navajo covid relief fund. Anything give help.

Alright buddy, multiple leaders multiple countries advised thing, lockdowns, wrong got feeling there's better way. Must stressful smartest man world. Absolutely true. 

Get enough bleach lungs Covid worries over! great deal us - family 5. pay $200/month. Unlimited visits, immediate appointments, appointment actually long doctor needs address issue, common drugs wholesale... like pennies stuff.  top pay $150/mo insurance company high deductible plan.  pay $4200/year awesome health care. alternative paying much low deductible PPO deal bullshit makes medicine awful paying $30 copays $1 worth antibiotics kids' strep infection top couple hundred gotta spend go urgent care can't get appointment see doctor.  

It's really great. get continuity care, relationship doctor, one 400 patients rather one 3500 (the number doctor started solo practice - followed switched). True, going chart shows positive tests groups (which diverges 10-14 days). mainly wanted counter false claim immunity starts second dose. Pretty difficult take virus one continent another going chips. even going approve vaccine like second week January. Take vaccine get bonus 5 vodka bottles black Adidas tracksuit. Ralph Baric UNC theorized 'G' variant might susceptible neutralization via therapy vaccines. wonder might ultimately find variant well. need find link.... Aussie, find amusing immediately shut domestic state borders enforce localised lockdown anytime there's whiff community transmission. 

Then look places like UK US trillion cases, borders wide open, lockdowns half assed mask wearing politcal.

I guess us Asia Pacific countries different standard... understand made statement based information time. even one young they're low vit d, they're likely fucked, like fucked healthy 50-60 year old getting corona? People free make decisions long wait turn like everyone else. manage buy vaccine earlier get it.... well, there's vaccine grants immunity knives. thought maybe Japan especially cautious high median age apparently median age Japan similar Germany albeit higher population base. Didn‚Äôt realize population Japan much higher Germany. ""Ah, let's ignore house fire, it'll burn eventually..."" victim here. move on.

Never said was, one playing victim. projection evidence reasons bad faith. victims people businesses suffer die encouraged people disregard advice guidance public health experts, scientists, elected officials.

The fact can't even comprehend multi-pronged pandemic containment effort would work think personal convenience absolutely damning. 

Done you. far fewer fat obese people Japan, thats damn sure. also lot smokers. But, really cared one person, happened caught COVID infection wearing mask made bad life choices far like morbidly obese causing Type 2 diabetes VS. someone good shape caught COVID he/she believe masks decided see family.

According you, ignore lifetime bad choices reward 1 good choice, punish lifetime healthy choice 1 bad choice/belief.

I think catching COVID bad enough matter belief yes, he/she may made bad choice, punished making 1 bad decision punished.

I firm believer isolation masks wife healthcare, health care professionals investigate patient's life choices make decisions quality care top crap go currently.

Also, patients currently LIE already (whether contact COVID patients/whether symptoms, etc).  goes effect, makes think tell healthcare people otherwise? know it, know it, everybody knows it. correct. complicated. Wow Michigan‚Äôs vaccine distribution effort complete joke.

Ohio delivered TWICE amount doses. normal civilians know Ohio getting vaccinated anyone nursing home girlfriend works getting vaccinated. There‚Äôs even timeline vaccination here.

While Trump partly blame, Whitmer didn‚Äôt expect fuckery plan beyond me. Go back far? Columbine happened 1999. Everything else after. ignores point: doesn‚Äôt matter do. hospitals flooded either way. whole thing going break down. yeah evolution choices good idea Covid-20 It‚Äôs bullshit? Really?

What Russians saying:

Bolsonaro: missed part thats problem Listen doesn‚Äôt matter won‚Äôt change mind. Go get vaccine can't eat shrimp?! God, wasting time you! /S way protect old folks homes shutting down. impossible protect without anything else. viruses mutate. Coronaviruses mutate much influenza mechanism check RNA delete errors. reason Covid likely like flu, needing new vaccine every year. 

However people infected, higher rate mutations. seeing new strains though, variations, meaning still able prevented vaccine. 

Generally mutations make virus contagious selected displace older versions. also usually less deadly, host time infect people. # *wasnt* ""severe,""but similar *other* allergies

The Pfizer vaccine, though widely distributed, 4-5 times many adverse reactions.

That's universal masking important: everyone spread drops. That's also doomed fail, requires compassion. pretend Americans take covid seriously? I'm heavily introverted, too, &amp; lowered social expectations amazing. explain Sweden's low numbers summer? Seems countries good summer, masks not. Im saying don‚Äôt care people, I‚Äôm saying aren‚Äôt people considerate others.

I‚Äôm saying people don‚Äôt really care anybody themselves. Enough people feel like virus continue spread, regardless charge lockdown measures taken.

None say it‚Äôs hoax. People died, many directly covid. that‚Äôs bummer. lots diseases kill lots people, time. 

A covid patient heart attack dies counts covid death. flu patient heart attack counts heart attack death. covid patient sits hospital isolation gets tested every 2-3 days test negative return nursing home. Every time test positive, counts new case. bet life it.

r u people real? yet determined. 

The number reports I've seen Vitamin deficiency ICU patients overall importance immune system... seems combine melanin/Vitamin issue generally increase poverty, would cover reasons why. lucky able maintain stress free environment. got new job. dont family member expire also. means wearing piece fabric face public staying 6 feet apart

That would also mean activities that's possible remain banned: restaurants, bars, parties, concerts, festivals, on. Ah hear 'another new' start spiel. Sounded like pinning South Africa could still go abroad lads. Tried posting Swedish forum. say full errors, basically fake news doubt source. also say people obsess Sweden anymore. 

Unfathomable, really. post describing effects symptoms Bell's Palsy based experience family member removed (censored) mods last week ""inciting fear"" vaccine. said cases statistical anomaly. Funny FDA considers important enough monitor. I'm anti-vaxer, feel everyone enough info vaccine make right choice themselves. hope stays up... Ah, Fauci method: lie things try get stupid people right thing. work well, it? 

I like misinformation and/or lies, matter intent is. right, think long game that. minister got worry this: congregants fall habit going church? could happen. Then, ministers, long-term setback business. following away weekly ""brainwashing treatment"" lot time think, likely come back. pastors rebuild repair following. 

As atheist, think US made major mistake letting churches go tax-free. created Industry nothing produced-- except maybe infomercials-- services (the economic kind) could minimized neglected completely. even keep financial records. management make money working 1 day week.

As result, proliferation crackpot religions sects run mostly smarmy hucksters, grifters, hustlers. people enormous economic power therefore political power. American megachurch perfect shute money laundering? 

And collateral people's thinking threatens undermine whole political system. Would Trump president without people groomed avoid clear thinking? Probably not.

There's one way separate charlatans &amp; cons sincerely religious:: away religion's tax free status see who's left. mostly sincerely religious. different problem own, least malignancy. NDTV, hell that? Get outta here. 2 times considered going ER. one time dizzy couldnt even crawl. hate vertigo. Second covid back feb. spike temp 105. sure cases double next month LA stay home order since Dec 5? live here? Yes cases exploded thanksgiving since county taken strictest precautions US remain way least 6 weeks... Yes, UK one seems effect virulence  sounds like hopefully mild cases. Dad, 73 severe heart disease, got COVID lost sense smell taste days. Mom, 4 years younger much healthier paper, also got COVID, hospitalized came close dying. It‚Äôs impossible predict get severely ill -even though older people health problems TENDING worse outcomes. church need bailed all?

Christianity bastion hypocrisy greed, least America. feel you. long distance relationship haven‚Äôt seen almost year (i US Singapore, way us meet). It‚Äôs fucking depressing barely managing stay calm. whole lockdown thing ruined mental health We're supposed talk knowledge might cause people act ways make half deaths harder eliminate. (which, fair, probably will) teach high school. kids leave class go 6 classes, different students. meet friends passing periods lunch. reality, it‚Äôs impossible enforce ‚Äúbubbles‚Äù high school. Also remember kids won‚Äôt perfect mask wearing behavior teachers‚Äô attention taken away teaching manage that. Also, classrooms large enough 5 feet students. 

The problem reality schools USA ideal conditions studies reference Ok D0omer line ‚Äòargument‚Äô works well lot people reason. I‚Äôm surprised used 99% since lot deniers say 99.9 99.98% case it‚Äôs framing. 

If someone framed :
How much money would take play game 1% chance killed, answer would quite lot money people would refuse play met number. 

But say 99% survive framing works people. Even though 1 100 dying quite high odds game.  would argue emphasis former conjunction latter. Obviously everyone likes blame president rightfully point start distributing blame mayors governors even fauci? There's plenty blame go around imo think healthy habits along precautions would way better narrative fear lockdown seems prominent measures... boss mad mad openly feel way (teaching Houston). Though private school teacher, pretty certain job school next school-year. think Japan legally block citizens entering country - year. taught lot country, terrifying indictment things come if/when climate change becomes catastrophic problem

We need seriously thinking 33% population doesn‚Äôt believe science, actively try sabotage you. also made undercounting Covid cases deaths basic government policy,

Say louder, people top thread. get fatigued bothered distancing that? also hate rationally too. even let write simple response work anime conventions, thinking thing. Hoping labor day weekend. know people blocked months returning home caused chaos, especially family Japan. Also, teacher U.K. whose school saw nearly 20 confirmed cases week Christmas, confirm theory incorrect. evidence strain contagious regular Rona. idiots Keep mind folks Japan already effectively closed 99% global population since April. Letting paltry foreign workers (these people jobs Japan) take 2 covid tests (both negative) 2-week quarantine start livelihoods going rampantly spread disease. fact, South Korea Taiwan lower deaths per million cases per million Japan never land locked foreign workers.

Do congratulate Japan retarded policies. Japan closes borders. Meanwhile usa people flipping shit asked wear mask Like said, countries seen happens genomic sequencing infrastructure advanced probably bother developing own. People keep pulling world war example WW2 barely touched lives Americans. I'm curious what.... happens something stuck ass leave it.

Other social issues, letting big gubbermint tell do. Japanese wear masks, like, lot. That‚Äôs big part it. Even multiplied covid numbers 20, they're less half per million US's numbers See, that's good leadership.   believe covid deadly?

Vast majority posters already live parents anyway, travel necessary Good luck blaming Trump CA. locked mid March never got back level openness say Texas. Dude, also lived Japan never said salmon isn‚Äôt consumed all. 

What said true. Salmon incorporated Japanese cuisine importing fish. Even salmon sushi traditionally eaten old days.

Tuna is/was remain widely consumed Japan compared salmon. difference actually gave money close down. Like every first world county good ol' U.S.A. borders closed Americans Europeans whole time, been? really closing rest? Hence qualfied original statement There's strawman. We're talking countries hard lockdowns. countries include places like China Australia that. glad live America rather place like things happen. Ok pat back guess? Probs best stuck memes. Bingo Yeah I'm sure underdeveloped world accurately reporting covid deaths right? Japanese peoples tend much healthier though.  America's pre existing conditions, specifically hypertension heart disease led high death rate. Seriously fuck pick Elon, meme retail investors inflating fuck company. fact Koch family gained billions value pandemic? Bezos making billions pulling hazard pay months? Japan also already mask culture place started. Even something minor hay fever would mask up. least we‚Äôd chance keep control vaccine roll underway. need hard reset rn. seriously linking aljazeera?

People justifiable fears regarding ethics medical research bad behavior parts researchers. 

To dismiss hand ""just anti-science"" unfair history, worries need addressed instead pooh-pooh'ed.  Maybe we‚Äôll live homegrown turnips instead. It‚Äôs called taking back control! Wouldn‚Äôt better fatasses keep eating ignore lockdown? support businesses still get sick something feel good about. Japan also testing much all.

Their government criticised little start this. I'd like see much actually done vs. much telling citizens did. Saving face top priority I'm SF well. social interactions outdoors park elsewhere outdoors. Wear masks, keep distance 14000 fewer people died Japan total Jan-Oct compared average year! much people thinking japan hiding covid numbers lmao average person that? Lmao I've never heard situation life want tell 50% Americans trust government happy recommend? Flights UK banned since 21st December spreads faster rate deaths increase. Personally anxiety increased. Xanax still works though. suspect it‚Äôs cabin fever me. futile places waited long accept strict lockdowns necessary, crooked ass police don‚Äôt want jobs enforce lockdown entire world done second knew outbreak Wuhan.  course airlines spread thousands infected world could squashed spread months. 

Live learn. Next time different. user replying comes constantly every Sweden related post try spin negatively. solely post context. get idea from? Depends they‚Äôre classifying deaths whether they‚Äôre testing covid. doubt testing it. It‚Äôs possible many covid deaths don‚Äôt get registered. Well need administer less tests. Since ones catching comparatively. 

The testing, numbers associated people less useless vast majority cases go undetected matter what, 50% don‚Äôt symptoms, people aren‚Äôt getting tested, another 40% super mild symptoms never bother test. 

The relevant accurate number deaths. Everything else extrapolated accurately there. America‚Äôs deaths 50x worse per capita. 

Imo biggest difference culture. Japanese wore masks strictly maintained 6‚Äô distance. America not, there‚Äôs difference. Currently 14 day quarantine required everyone entering Japan. new policy refuse entry non Japanese citizens. Olympics also heard want see sumo match happen like every month? Something else mindful of. definitely needed it. year isolated watching planned family events get cancelled one other, desperately needed travel spend Christmas family. didn‚Äôt though, can‚Äôt work remote mask compliance isn‚Äôt great among coworkers.

Imagine thinking one event he's racist shit bag. pretty sure science proven go church can't get No, said thought would get election. never thought going big deal, that's fucking lie. thought would slow enough get Nov. mexico people care all, throw parties 30 people, refuses wear mask selfish thinking that's like ""I care get Covid, die anyways"". really disappointing. Oh know, lol 3 us microbiologists immunologist haha. technically backyard beers allowed, gatherings sizes currently prohibited. Hard figure out. covid deaths come nursing homes 60% so. 

I mean much put natural causes/old age? backyard beers buddies keep masks and/or keep 6 ft away. doesn‚Äôt nothing. every time I‚Äôve suggested something similar, friends family balk take safety measures, gave started Zoom happy hours again.

Vaccinate old healthcare workers rest fine. didnt see single instance someone calling Trump racist closing borders. once. anyone. right left forums, etc. anti-racists tend believe science, cheered closing borders. Maybe try making different fake argument lol care human toll. never considered cost pets. That‚Äôs another layer sadness whole situation. fair, difference closing borders everyone vs handpicking countries. said, don‚Äôt think USA‚Äôs policy racist.

Also Japan stranger xenophobia regardless Covid border closures.

USA‚Äôs border closure pointless racist opinion. ‚Äòclose‚Äô travel China time infections coming Europe, let 40,000 US citizens per week China virus also checking people‚Äôs passports citizenship, even let Chinese citizens long haven‚Äôt spent last 14 days China.

It seems like issues almost exclusively political. Oxford Gamaleya vaccines similar, Russian vaccine uses effective adenoviruses British vaccine stands benefit.  


I know really hope vaccine work - political obsessions - will. People thing 1918. Taiwan didn‚Äôt even shut 7 deaths. Really sorry hear that. Hopefully period recovery permanent. flu years took weeks shake off. eventually did.

What sad shameful way use freedoms. seriously believe that? Lmao late, news 9! Believe me. get better do. lived China early days pandemic. Thank you? said first COVID-19 vaccinations started slowly last Monday **navigated preparing previously** frozen shots use, finding employees run vaccination clinics, ensuring proper social distancing vaccination. **Some said 100 shots first day.**

**Gunboats.** rule applies foreigners, per article.

Obviously, cannot forbid citizens enter sure exception would made visas travel.

Yes, course. think you‚Äôre making solid point sound dumb. see anyone Xmas. phone calls video chats. Oh, sorry, couldnt read original since removed, thought poking us entirely sympathize situation. sounds terrible. new city brings challenges own, add pandemic hell supposed do? 

I agree last couple points. people innocent claim be. bodies (homeless people) buried mass graves island. 

These bodies still stuck freezer truck morgues. magnify across country. course homeless people, likely pre-existing conditions, getting hit hard right now. since society really cared homeless people? Certainly friend grasping straws justify taking COVID seriously. downvotes show sound like dumb one meanwhile OP git‚Äôn sweet Karma Indeed. (was?) professional, freelance musician. Went school it, made living teaching playing gigs until...March, guess. last gig 2-month pit orchestra run February. Almost colleagues incomes dropped livable (although generally quite modest) near zero period several weeks. Even someone who's industry, hard fathom many musicians taken performing world good--many people said ""fuck it"" started pursuing different line work entirely. I've fairly lucky already set skills related home repair/improvement, I've utilizing time period--however many high level, elite musicians completely, utterly screwed. know make it. bullet train also touristy type thing? I'm American, America objectively terrorist organization... shit country, get wrong, terrorist incredibly overblowing it.  emergency services, mobile ER. literally emergency transport get point (incident site) point B (the ER). smoke resin think nicotine might inhibit virus someone. It‚Äôs fully understood Deaths decline around 40% risk 2% population vaccinated.   can‚Äôt wait March April cases deaths curves go downward spiral. That‚Äôs going awesome watch. lot people think hospitalized acute care ER, try stop dying. 

They think rehab hospitals, home care, outpatient care, long term care, assisted living, rehab last thing mind actually live it. 

For context, acute care going last week life. Everything else easily 2 weeks+ months. That's reality, matter, UK well way reaching HIT even vaccines get deployed. early days pandemic fun, favorite performers LA NYC started teaching classes Zoom. novelty wore off.

It‚Äôs sad. I‚Äôd like keep great community alive, 8 hours back back Zoom work occasional Zoom chat family, don‚Äôt energy take Zoom dance violin class. mean winter season pretty much started. ain't warming anytime soon...at least Chicago lol. yes think Maybe end March, IMO, things start get better. makes mad. Japan always dreamt closing doors foreigners (except chosen elite course) virus given perfect excuse. western country done long time, would worldwide outrage. Japan always gets pass somehow. 
I‚Äôm France, shut UK 48 hours last week media still treating like committed genocide british &amp; french expats. Remember China lied told everyone virus real, allowing spread globally, past point return? too, good times, much blood hands. Asians collectivist. American prides freedom rugged individualism. government tells go nature, results America. government tells cover good also sake neighbors society, Asian culture‚Äôs tend conform. 

It‚Äôs different country culture also thought process many Americans conceive accept.  got that, thought amount vaccines ordered would one first countries vaccinate entire population. late spring early summer latest. That's relatively easy choice make 2 patients arriving time, they've got choose treat. that's choice made. 

What COVID patient brought bad shape. start responding treatment, still poor health. estimate, they've got 50-50 odds survival. couple days treatment, hospital hits 100% capacity. Now, new patient arrives critical condition. almost certainly die without treatment; however, treatment they've got 80% odds survival. cease treatment COVID patient treat new one, turn away new one there's room? Either decision condemns one patient die. utilitarian decision would treat patient higher chance recovery, justify ceasing treatment existing patient still good chance recovering? Got first shot Pfizer morning. totally painless. feeling side effects, stoked follow 21 days. Let's knock sucker out, people. Reaching herd immunity going messy process vary widely location. US certain groups hesitant vaccination also tend live together communities, Republicans African Americans. also likely see retirement communities reach herd immunity faster older people prioritized vaccination. places like North Dakota many natural infections wouldn‚Äôt require many vaccinations get herd immunity. mention factors unrelated immunity drive regional differences infections.

The fact Covid widely circulating US makes different measles outbreaks begin international travel easily traced. Unvaccinated unlucky vaccinated people going regularly get sick via domestic travel create mini outbreaks otherwise safe communities long regions lower levels immunity. think it‚Äôs diversity led Dr. Fauci admit may need something like 90% people US vaccinated truly end epidemic here.

And reaching herd immunity globally even less likely given many poor countries regularly struggle kinds dangerous vaccine preventable diseases. seen diseases natural infections decrease spread eradicate virus own. 

The COVID-19 pandemic die down, sadly COVID-19 stay. That‚Äôs exactly happened. government lie people wouldn‚Äôt hoard masks like hoarding toilet paper sanitizer. They‚Äôve admitted much. 

However certain dumb segment US purposely mischaracterized move government saying masks don‚Äôt anything don‚Äôt wear masks, among stupidities. It‚Äôs amazing 2 countries massive anti-mask populations (US, Sweden) worst death rates yet people haven‚Äôt caught on. polyethylene glycol, PEG reality many people subreddit need face COVID care intentions pure. treat anti-masker wants go vacation way treat responsible rule follower *needs* travel home due family mental health issues. 

What mean? means two options:

- Give everyone traveling benefit doubt, intentions pure travel necessary.

- Lay blanket criticism travelers, regardless intentions reasons.

There third option okay them, okay certain classes people others. happen america? trump right? 0_o said wasn‚Äôt? wonder why? really consider much ‚Äúcovid‚Äùtests USA also show positive regular flu (happened me, I‚Äôve heard stories friends health care) deaths strictly covid.
Now also consider, covid hits obese hardest, USA far larger obese population spoils far larger Japan percentage.

Almost every American fighting give single shit Jews. pumped propaganda reluctantly drafted. didn‚Äôt know scale Jewish persecuation mostly didn‚Äôt care Americans generally hated Jews time.

Maybe us looked NY took future possibility instead big city issue would fared bit better year means 2020. ramps quite bit 2021. We'll likely people vaccinated end 2021, sooner. Last checked, Thanksgiving celebrated Midwest too. cases declining. explain also saying Thanksgiving super spreader? 0.5% US population, continue act like basically exist.

Here study genetic defense coronaviruses East Asian population don‚Äôt need rely racist good Asian stereotypes could still get new variant another country instead UK.

Exactly. So, assume comes everywhere. They‚Äôre demographics don‚Äôt robust knowledge medicine mean ""China Ban"" - prevented direct flights China Chinese nationals?

It derided nationalist still allowed planes China come - Chinese nationals - like virus tell sort passport have. 

Again - point flights China stopped.

And totally stupid Chinese nationals rebooked come US connecting city thats USA able that.

Excellent. gonna okay return bunker cuddle ar-15 trillion.   Yeah, since really can't get again, see problem traveling to/with others already virus well. long everyone seeing memory cells, see issue is.

Sure there's cases reinfection, millions, really moot point. 

I know I'm going get downvoted this, I'm trying rational discussion. physically transporting virus (as germs clothes/hands), traveling manner really affecting anything?  Let's wait already control first? Looks like 20Million allocated administered. still good administration speed time hindered production. heard New Zealand? 

Any better examples island nation sparely populated therefore comparable western nations? Fucking pathetic slow. Get going. I'm flying, I'm driving, I'm even going see family lives fifteen minutes one town over. can't fathom point trips, matter form transportation used.

Japan isn‚Äôt even hardest. 

Stop making things internet.  regularly conversations people deny fact 338,000 Americans died. straight deny numbers facts say shouldn‚Äôt believe everything hear.

The post read Facebook counts numbers compiled CDC, WHO, Associated Press, on. Confirmation bias hell drug. Americans fucking stupid swear God. Yeah, get back us actually peer-reviewed published, thanks. No, daily deaths February mostly got infected Christmas. deaths seeing Halloween week after. Death decline March best.

ICU beds start empty February, start. I‚Äôm smelling end pandemic US.

Starting week people gotten vaccination substantial immunity(Across population whole). biggest holiday year over. see peak cases next week / week after, days get longer days get warmer, virus slowly stop spreading quickly. couple vaccines probably get approved end February.

If feeling down: You‚Äôll get it. will. 60 days, start pinpoint restrictions
can end start rolling back harsh restrictions. Makes sense paper unfortunately issue isn‚Äôt black white you‚Äôre making be. American governmental website hosting result give automatic validity. Neither appeal authority argumentum ad antiquitatem arguments here, fallacies.

I linking particular website appeal authority imply validity vaccine, convenient links hosting information named source. point unreasonable many people make Red Scare type posts implying Russia could develop vaccine, going weak otherwise lying world. Yes, criticisms rushed pace vaccine they're stupid people vested interest developing vaccine virus ravaging country. general consensus seems [it effective vaccine. Cigarettes, weed demonized Japan iirc.  see what‚Äôs happening Los Angeles? downvote much want, i‚Äôm still convinced you‚Äôre living alternate dimension. Awesome! Thanks helpful response. There‚Äôs actually couple studies published showing Covid patients smokers tend less severe symptoms non smokers. it‚Äôs theorized nicotine inhibits somehow. whole ER system based triage, priority patient determined upon arrival, ER staff act accordingly. they‚Äôre backed up, there‚Äôs much triaging do. beds full, everybody‚Äôs waiting. distribution effort fucking joke. cleared up, cheers. message be, assume variant already Canada here's gonna do...

Not, we've tested measly amount samples evidence yet. Kinda reminds start pandemic keep repeating evidence community transmission (while even testing community transmission overly strict testing criteria), suddenly community transmission. lost confidence health professionals. I‚Äôm African, comments honestly make laugh. 

Keep burying head sand confronted problems, looking issues others‚Äô success. 

Might make feel better bit, t‚Äôs going change reality. ""demands source"" ""pretentious"".

You've failed again, ToolFO! Please wait outside. mean didn‚Äôt world wars draft? Seems like bullshit comparison.

Also war actual nazis Americans felt nationalistically obligated even xenophobic towards germans 9 months get ready. Inexcusable. available children key workers believe, sure figure would child everyone work away home. Florida reported 17k new cases today. nothing reported yesterday, that‚Äôs probably couple days combined? Maybe? "".. chin diaper"". made chuckle, lol. countries better generally far less diversity. people page understand benefit working together. happens nationalism means are. It‚Äôs amazing much smarter people education funded valued, eh? ideal, understandable. I'd suggest semi-distancing first week he's back that's possible. Shower (or wait 4 hours after), eat together, long conversations unmasked.

I live household 10 people, must work outside home. We've pretty restrictive throughout, allow certain activities someone willing isolate within house week. Japan's death rate higher US pre covid. US fittest time? Even use analogy, fire put out. care started. need put fire first better analogy would treating drunk last dui crash don‚Äôt understand, I‚Äôd love someone tell I‚Äôm wrong missing, last two weeks Wales second highest per capita infection rate world. usually attributed ‚Äònew‚Äô strain graph, seen before, 10% positives Wales attributed new strain. 

So Welsh managing badly affected overwhelmingly old less infectious version possible country old version higher rate infection somewhere rates new strains high (ie England South Africa) Yep, failed get production ramped up. Given fact I'm saying country ALL, no. make imperalistic state. 

It's lot land inhabited people blindly brainwashed believe corporations looking them. routinely manipulated making DUMBEST political decisions possible THEMSELVES. 

That's country. goddamn insane asylum. 1/8th amount 1/8th elapsed time? understanding significant overlap work, basically banking promising candidates investing production allow jump straight testing able.

Also, link provided say anything concerns me, common side effects already associated vaccines flu jab well aforementioned remote chance allergic reaction. 

That aside, mentioned mRNA vaccines small number promising vaccine candidates. get choice, take one conventional vaccines concerns you. Personally, I'll keep eye news pick apart information comes in.

And back original point, nothing discussed compromises closed border approach. Vaccines track, multiple options different types, meanwhile economy (on whole) great, people general going life without anxiety inducing shadow trying avoid prevalent virus community. hope continues till mass vaccination completed, time comfortably re-open. Today fligt landed misstake tho, 29 passengers UK. expected self isolate test themselves. one contact passengers expected know responsilbe isolating testing. Seems bit.. meh. Like said people selfish want inconvenienced. expect things get worse mid January like said sometimes vaccinate enough people even start making real difference virus spreading control. realize sure seems like waited long enough everyone could pack malls stores outside lockdown zones spend much money big box stores shutting everything down. I'm afraid developing long-term neurological issues, decreased lung function, myriad ""long covid"" symptoms may may permanent dying covid. Well I'm fucked There‚Äôs ton reasons, cultural origin. mask usage insanely high, one. I‚Äôd surprised low 99.5% usage. 

Another huge reason personal space bubble compared western countries. It‚Äôs common someone‚Äôs personal space 4-6ft strangers, 3ish feet friends, around slightly longer foot close friends. lot Japanese friends complain westerners get close comfort. trains packed, leads next point. 

The last reason impacted rates transmission, least opinion, quiet society. don‚Äôt really shout, unless they‚Äôre incredibly drunk, even rare. train rush hour incredibly packed, removed ambient noise tracks, could probably hear pin drop. go way quiet possible, don‚Äôt even breathe hard avoid it. masks would 99% catch aerosolised virus even close together, persons masks would prevent remaining virus infecting them. 

This virus spread asymptomatically, aerosolised, knowledge spread primarily thru droplets. airport would catch symptomatic cases; walk thru temperature scanner arriving internationally. already socially distance compared western countries. Add widespread mask usage, projecting voices, thus preventing spread aerosols farther, perfect conditions minimise transmission. yeah let‚Äôs stop donating blood good idea genius  Yeah, fact hasn‚Äôt happened already dereliction duty current admin. genuinely don‚Äôt know ANYWHERE that. Even true, that‚Äôs micro focused extremely high risk situations it‚Äôs probably even noticed general public. You‚Äôre suggesting really think disruptive daily mitigations still place next flu season that‚Äôs unrealistic. It‚Äôs onestly looking better countries Eastern Asia Oceania.  hard right now. bands solid following getting im drummer band lying low almost whole year now. We‚Äôre cover band miss playing music. nice way make little extra $ plus fun. It‚Äôs pretty clear point restrictions follow hospitalizations. hospitalizations non existent end April/May see restrictions lifted. realistic expectations. There‚Äôs reason consensus amongst sub. 70% still huge difference. Means doubling every two weeks measures stall old variant. Fauci says whatever thinks needs say get people behave way want to. important job, truth accuracy primary goals. That's physically possible current amount doses available expectations. expect restrictions drop summer, instated rolling basis surges occur, removed needed, come back little harsher next flu season holidays. that, mostly limited restrictions like masking public mostly gone good. expectations part. expect people worst possible thing. speaking mandates place basis used...as told months. wrong unattractive, right eat less salmon people think. 

Salmon Atlantic imported time, indeed eat less salmon say, tuna, consume lot Imagine level vitriolic hatred towards 300+ million wildly diverse people.

C'mon dude. better people saying Russians Chinese evil. *north dakota entered chat* ***you angered matthew perry*** Im suppose fly Narita go Kuala Lumpur (ANA). I'd transit 3 hours. wonder that's banned? loll. get fucked.  Yet claim understand numbers around world different. Think that. 

There's antibody cross reactivity there's way young people. developing country poor hygiene tons disease world big problem COVID. virus definitely wasn‚Äôt thing 2019. understand correctly assume developed somewhere around October 2019. there‚Äôs way know sure. 

Also... returned Germany leaving China mid February really alarmist told people shit would hit fan pretty soon. one believed me. seen kind like Ebola, kind thing affects poor countries TV. Even government would stepped in, people would revolted disease would made way country anyways. 

There efforts medium level government management Hubei province soon came attention national government made big steps fast. It‚Äôs possible discuss measures hours end worked... 

I really don‚Äôt believe crap China bought whatever even it‚Äôs chinas fault spread west. bad spot need avoid talking politics making enemies countries wheeler would rather help investigate. zero confidence US could handle crisis now. Even that's case problems rich...you aware entire logic also said as:

""Why rich people guinea pigs? That's POORS' job. money, means we're BETTER. Let those...plebian unwashed masses take risk getting vaccine, let us perfect end. We're rich, DESERVE best."" Hey need overreact, isn‚Äôt everyone said last week? ""We cannot go year economy shut down. can't,"" Cuomo said Wednesday. ""How balance that? keep economy open safely waiting hit full vaccination?

There‚Äôs always 30% dgaf! don‚Äôt first explain evidence China using unwilling test objects? far it‚Äôs dumb conspiracies fairness population density insanely low.... makes imperialistic state, terrorist one. society extremely rule obedient, US's society extreme opposite. Yo Fauci said worry gots tha vaccines mooks! like stated multitude times, expectation, stated course action leadership. Epidemiologists ones make predictions offer measures states following. pandemic, epidemiologists leadership. everyone else jut mouthpiece findings recommendations. Tbf argue police either chance might shoot process.... Closing borders racist fuck It‚Äôs runaway spread point, practically speaking. ‚ÄúBeating‚Äù covid won‚Äôt one defining moment time passed enough herd immunity accumulate vaccines administered becomes another feather cap seasonal illness akin cold flu. Wano closing borders news minor nitpick: Saxony-Anhalt (""Sachsen-Anhalt"") Saxony (""Sachsen""). That's lot ifs. 

How's one you? spend 15 months best years life miserable isolation, lost job/business, maybe relationship, maybe developed mental health issues, die covid anyway?

You make kinds hypotheticals justify situation, say anything odds. 

I socially distance, always wear surgical mask public, get tested somewhat regularly. visit high risk people socialize indoors people households. Beyond I'm trying live normalish life particularly care someone thinks that's irresponsible. Reverse Wano Arc, sorry Kozuki Oden guys need start using ¬´¬†fewer¬†¬ª countable items like ¬´¬†tests¬†¬ª... I‚Äôm not? need genuine human contact. Whats point video chatting dislike way smell?

I‚Äôd like say I‚Äôm that, truth humans biological creatures driven biological needs. may meet someone get along incredibly well, doesn‚Äôt mean genuine connection. video chats world don‚Äôt replace ten seconds looking someone‚Äôs eyes, hug.

And even getting past that, fuck going meet person?  Hell yeah brother! ban travel one country. specifically banned chinese Hong Kong citizens completely fine expats said country 100% non-citizens.

It complete lip service tactic appeal voter base hate china wrong reasons. vastly overestimating lag infection death. Density really impact spread much. countries handled well far dense countries haven't. meaningless statistic. already closures business limits every year flu season: schools close influenza outbreaks, limit visitors nursing homes hospitals year hard hit areas occupancy surges. continue another ILI piled top heap experience year? actually say that? thats huge coming Yup. get ventilator. type thing alcoholics... go bottom list liver transplants, right? common sense solution. Logistically &amp; ethically, I'm sure would work, though. plenty opposed things simply trump one suggesting saying them. Plentg also opposed things trump wrong say group exist simply lie. That‚Äôs blatantly true. Viruses jump animals all. the. time. It‚Äôs preventable. 

There Americans China needed get home. self respecting country leave country people stranded see also think that's due vaccination process requiring two shots. want make sure anyone needing second dose weeks one immediately available early doses sitting around then. kiwi neighbors got knocked *proper* lock reopening protocols. Okay. 

Care explain basis yours, even control internet commenter might hold someone else‚Äôs life hands begin with? literally except residents citizens special exceptions (healthcare workers). live NZ think would know.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* agree everything said always tell ‚Äúhey man, smoke?‚Äù ‚Äú...smoke what?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou already answered question B-)‚Äù Also proof long-term damage. Would want donate child's health science? leadership, epidemiologists. Governments cater people want. really believe kind distancing measures place public come summer yes need manage expectations people putting place restrictions well. Korea too. ask think agreement second. First off, bring nothing conversation statement bringing Trump random. 

Since would like discuss Trump order stop flights China let's look timeline. February, pretty strong evidence virus early November. remember left rags complaining racist him, action correct one, would been. Go look number people traveled United States ban tell effective was? This, like many things Trump done, nothing ploy anger left give right pointless shitty taking points like one. 

Half world shit bed comes handling thing, stop attacking demand better elect lead you. incubation period means you‚Äôd still miss people exposed airport way over. You‚Äôd need keep quarantined 5 days upon entry eliminate pathway. remember sitting back jeep, watching aliens slowly gaining him... ‚Äúmust go faster, smith!‚Äù he‚Äôd say - classic line.

Almost good ‚ÄúLife... finds earf.‚Äù expensive cuban cigars Japan 50% obese like US? Japan seafood rich diet vitamin deficient? Japan...... mean reasonable recommendation realised something like 40% cases asymptomatic help spread it. case plenty people passing around may symptoms know wear mask hence message changed. mutation changed spike protein much antibodies recognise it, meaning vaccine exposure immunity would totally unprotected it. kind mutation possible, unlikely. likely way would happen would via different animal, scared going minks back humans. Japan handled corona poorly compared Asian countries. I‚Äôm really sorry, sounds hard. aren‚Äôt alone feeling alone, helps much. Hang there. year, least, terrible memory someday soon.  Nah friends China told airborne asymptomatic cases. Well apparently doses sitting around told beginning soon get clearnance would enough go around. Talk moving goal posts. Yes, assuming:

1. get (i.e., maintain necessary cold chain);
2. enough get high risk groups;
3. indications highly efficient vaccine less efficient elderly likely cause adverse reactions certain groups;
4. already vaccinated relatively small number care workers likely bring vaccine high-risk groups, sterilizing immunity benefit multiple at-risk patients. Nothing stopping wearing mask around immunocompromised people. Furthermore, definite idea we'll reach herd immunity can't pin lifting restrictions something nebulous. least 60% Americans could vaccinated still might herd immunity, that's reason still pretend we're heavy outbreak mode.  Well, we‚Äôre making assumptions There‚Äôs medical reason Covid would overload anything normal flu season. reason system could strained year virus novel, public immunity. means people extremely vulnerable immune systems (sick people, old people, chronically ill people) getting sick once. That‚Äôs strain. 

Covid average person, pretty standard illness. Really one would overwhelm anything pool hosts left infect young healthy. likely case next fall. don‚Äôt think entirely understand difference pandemic virus becomes endemic. That's refuse wear seat belt.
At speed I'm driving, Im dead anyway. 

Translated: nothing die anyway great strategy Potty training oldest trying youngest today 19 months. Started 2 2 , speech delay oldest, potty training two talking, catching expected developmentally, youngest rapidly growing help big sister. Really merry christmas here. Agreed. Also, look virus spread initially. outrage new virus Wuhan's situation. However, cases already many countries detected yet Yes, well, Americans foolish. Even so, Trump receiving little baseless criticism stopped enacting COVID response. Monoclonal antibodies take long time make limited supply. Right want limit vulnerable (elderly immunocompromosed) problem trusting China‚Äôs vaccine wouldn‚Äôt trust Russia? Russia put first man woman space. Russia long history scientific achievements Russian people actually believe science follow advice scientists. difference: witness 1918. No. people dying, still calling hoax fucking nurses give em good chuckle..... read comment you‚Äôll see criticize countries leadership avoiding mistakes US made learning lesson winter currently in. 

Just silly blaming China botched US response. living New Zealand, Australia others virus control humans? Nice know. Remember US tried everyone called President Trump racist? I‚Äôm honestly sooo glad said fuck medical field 7 years ago now.

So fucking glad. shit isn‚Äôt worth it, one gets paid it, get annoying ass woke commercials idiots clapping every day shift change. much fatter are

Are saying Europeans fatter Americans? 1. I'm American, get yourself.
2. constant Sputnik naming still pathetic. Dec 30th officially reuters, get beef ophthalmologist telling friends SARS misreading test report.

The way treated shameful, honestly... expect CCP. I'm honestly still *far* bothered 2 months later, coming head last year 37,000 Americans died common Flu. averages 27,000 70,000 per year. Nothing shut down, life &amp; economy go on. moment 546 confirmed cases CoronaVirus, 22 deaths. Think that!

Do idea damaging kind misinformation was? retweet day after?

The CCP absolutely could handled better early days, people glass houses fucking throw stones man... There's really leg stand there. there's one thing whole thing exposed, shambles many world's govts are. long form discussion jumping conclusions bad.
Using correct terminology important. 

Only 16 votes 1 comment 2days later. PPP thing going uncovered large scale misappropriation money. Literally cash grab exploitable. again, ""we"" here. also say ""we"" still need put fire first save lives first sit think happened

Why can't both? Governments Asia put strict ban trades they're not. We're mercy basically, next pandemic comes. live schools close flu illness covid lmao? PA never happened entire life planned go Taiwan Japan honeymoon. Flight got cancelled got puppy instead. Also covid-19 revealed something we've known long time many people never wanted kids regret cannot say publicly actions show it.

I'm talking single mom two jobs needs moment's peace, talking people pawn kids everyone cannot stand act parenting long pissed outlets gone due covid. Well, lately, wife seeing COVID patients 4-5 days week practice (purposely temporarily) respiratory clinic see patients. between, sees lot people serious issues would certainly die got COVID. makes sense part first group. Spreading around practice unknowingly would awful, capacity rapid test every care provider every day.

And then, wonder really vaccinating people 80 years old first group. social groups tend small, think would benefit families getting vaccinated first. make sense vaccinated folks retirement homes since that's lot deaths been, awful people losing parents early things like this.

Mostly, feel like little guidance anyone done. hospitals taking advantage full control vaccinate right now, giving physicians sit offices paperwork. absolutely absurd. plan, really isn't, zero federal oversight. province went """"""lockdown"""""""", unsurprisingly involves elementary schools open, highschools opening halfway through. Even ignore long term effects Covid children could facing decades, schools breeding grounds virus, serve drive mutations. get many people infected, suddenly new strains/variants begin popping up, happening lately. Virology nothing new, reason seemed relearn everything past year. USA TWO BORDERS shared countries. TWO!

Are seriously suggesting horrific spread throughout country caused Canadians Mexicans?

Fucking idiot. island help government actively tries sabotage COVID response. guy said ""I wish instead vaccine, would [do essentially another form vaccination], way hell I'm getting vaccinated though"".  said, ""I'm getting mRNA vaccine"", would little different People opposite know advice. simply make different choices, it‚Äôs like repeating thing 10 million times change that. I‚Äôd like talk WHO. changed literal definition ‚ÄúHeard Immunity‚Äù. went number population infected ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù. literally propaganda shit. someone explain this? Vaccins smell fresh Real Estate coming :) point fighting particular battle ""pointless"" though. Words mean things, stupid. IFFFF reach herd immunity, still need wear masks?  steps needed effectively deal COVID, even without lockdown, require government intervention. look Taiwan South Korea, also dealing surge right now. 2JZ engine prices probably went another 20% news üò≠ point even then, recursion. Maybe ""fundamental issues"" result country becoming driven hate, make difference try fix fundamental issues people driven hate they'd rather fundamental issues continue spite people hate.

My point two, fix hatred fixing fundamentals:

 fix abject hatred get everyone page, everyone willing go general strike better treatment and, process, government/corporations would blink first fix fundamental problems. 

If try fix fundamental issues without fixing sheer amount hatred tribalism, people openly try derail attempt fix issues solely spite people's ""THEY"". 

By logic, stands reason fix hatred divisiveness society, fix that, fundamental issues prayer united front. can‚Äôt understand public health experts think life won‚Äôt go back normal achieve extremely high bar totally crushing virus

Maybe know new mutated virus spreading throughout Europe entire world, one twice infectious? That, general public really seems losing stay safe continue wear masks isolate. behaviors never crucial.

Entitled selfish people non-fact-based attitudes wearing masks maintaining isolation biggest driving factors Covid-19 continuing rage control. Nobody wants deal isolation anymore (myself included; I'm going crazy here), people somehow getting false sense 'we getting this'. 

It's definitely fantastic news multiple highly effective vaccines administered now. celebrate that. hope.

That said, 220,000-250,000 new cases every day means still deep shit. 3,000-3,500 deaths day means that, too. new variant virulent heading way long way go. 6 million air travelers past week Christmas also end *lot* new cases fatalities. There's getting around reality. sure hope everybody enjoyed trip meal presents; pay price that.

The important thing get elderly front line workers vaccinated. rest us might get doses June. start saying we're anywhere near moving past this, though. would expect masks distancing last least summer possibly fall. Hopefully sooner orchestra style concerts, everyone seat, wear mask, nobody sings along. I‚Äôm wondering I‚Äôd better back March spent day licking doorknobs quarantined three weeks. Japan done pretty decent job controlling virus, it‚Äôs surprising compare absolute numbers. 

It people isolated first place, could relaxed lot restrictions lead extreme isolation. didn‚Äôt, worst both. 

Also, don‚Äôt downplay long term effects COVID, either. long term negative effects society years come. 

Bottom line, I‚Äôm trying diminish mental health aspect this. sucks, really sucks some. 1) there‚Äôs global pandemic, something gonna suck. 2) I‚Äôm convinced 6mil people traveled Christmas suffered mental health issues severe enough warrant travel. need wear mask unless sick. widespread community transmission, longer knew healthy sick wearing mask everyone made sense. would AZ and/or J&amp;J sterilizing immunity others not. understanding moderna &amp; pfizer checked people symptoms covid AZ/oxford checked weekly biweekly asymptomatic infection.

personally given choice someone automimmune family sides really, really really want even asymptomic infection could activate risk genes. given choice vaccine point would take one lower effectiveness sterilizing immunity. Addtionally live elderly parent want protect even going offered vax know among ones worked I'm going taking care even area manages get enough people vaccinated estimate we've gotten herd immunity.

that said I'm glad AZ/Oxford &amp; J&amp;J testing dosing. lower risk levels might given choice vaccines &amp; results might proving **any** give sterilizing immunity not.

Also eagerly awaiting confirmation vaccines hit infecitous variations. I'm glad UK gov well companies testing. hope countries tests well ensure errors testing &amp; reported results. 5x population. think idiots. Cool, want list 10 news stories specifically focusing aspect COVID-19?

I'll wait. answer question based comment, Red Cross think eligible male who's sexually active another male within past 3 months, person who's sexually active gay male within past 3 months. calmer are, bud never seen school closed day two due illness? Lucky you, rolling thing every flu season. referring hospital load many areas already strained regular ILI's year, get worse new ILI mix. lead limited local closures restrictions now. agree, either one us end, guess shall see.  people U.S. would protest. Lol! protest mask wearing they're probably gonna protest this.. country stop citizens leaving, talking Smoking risk factor Covid though, unless new article that. Last checked healthy adult regular smoker less sever symptome covid healty non-smoker adult. Yes thinking thing. Japan insane population density yet numbers less bad. There's hoshin kanri (top strategy) leaders organization (japanese government) aligns speeches avoid contradictions. prime minister says people wear masks, governor, mayor, etc say same. Japananese people also prone obeying authority hygiene great even pandemic (hand sanitizers, usage masks). think contact tracing used GPS phones (something many people west would find outrageous) japanese citizen understand necessary problem justify anything internet provide people (real fake) back take someone has.

I seen people say going crowded bar totally justified always seem get votes even positive comments.

I yell people online pointless. take covid seriously takes protect others knowing fully well others find reason find people defend them.

At point look test subjects gather data people failings. Good luck dad. glad prognosis good. know relief getting news. father also diagnosed cancer mid pandemic. mind numbingly amount stress/fear/uncertainty. maintain tight bubble, chemo doctors appointments one thing cant avoid. one person comes contact could devastate family without ever knowing it. small effort futile. potential saves someone elses life. Sure, wearing mask go mailbox might seem pointless since much stepped foot grocery store 9 months, neighbors get sleep little bit better night talk mental health, tiny bit less stress little sleep huge impact. Probably til people listen stop opposite ask. must burden know many dead people shouldnt died. defend , OP say 'them' first sentence. However, later indicated otherwise blame u/mailist1 confused. care stuffing travel plans? part problem.

I think we're well past blaming China. US UK gotten things control May, there's sizeable chance world would followed. little upset country might prefer people lol   basically describing humans..nothing America. certainly want think myself. thing air mask mandates whether vanish enforced smaller smaller basis (like going states counties, districts individual cities, think actually happen, starting areas.) Crowded grocery stores bad news. No, it‚Äôs middle pandemic family mostly high-risk Last time checked Europe almost half population voting science denying, anti mask candidates. exceedingly rare ever meet somebody without mask. Coincidentally, kind people that'd rob shops without mask even wear one. news zombie Matthew Perry sailing ghost ship Japan. Indeed. point trying make difference good governance enforcement culture. Since pandemic kills people road accidents, good reason enforce strict COVID rules. hear you. One sisters RN social worker. RN works post op chances coming across someone COVID less sister social worker. know system can‚Äôt perfect overnight grocery store clerks also likely come across someone someone COVID. think important thing vaccine it‚Äôs matter system continuing produce push people. also agree elderly gotten first along ER paramedics. heard nothing paramedics first interact emergency room patience. Basically NZ. that's place recurses, again- worldwide scale wealth inequality, fact conversation Reddit means computer smartphone, global scale means need dragged streets beaten death much billionaire does. North Carolinian, I'm insanely frustrated folks extended family flouting guidelines responding ""well weae masks we're good""

One cousins daughter decided *now* good time buy old city bus travel around country visiting family friends. told ""I'll glad sit outside catch up, can't I'm comfortable state's quarantine requirement state travelers."" never heard back them, assholes.  Except that's new method 2(at least) vaccines based on, no?  Wuhan pool parties allowed anymore? Except that's new method 2(at least) vaccines based on, no?

Not even soul:

White people: POC VICTIMS SYSTEMATIC RACISM scoured thread there's mention it, sound like full lies, argument taking refuge audacity. Good. cited me, theres lot officials studies found significant numbers spread covid school environment. Youre definitely right covid doesnt seem rampant schools hasnt shown signs getting way. 

However, theres also massive inconvenience issues closing schools make people ignore risk. Despite risk, theyll work keep schools open. Parents overwhelmed teens keeping Police away pressing matters 1st lockdown. theres people work people cant afford childcare. there's childcare list issues it. asked alternate reality live in. Wisconsin, like Dakotas, decided move another universe pandemic. governments decided everything possible spread virus bars churches could reopen. hide infections deaths Good job comrade, +1 credit added social score. see cushy government job future. much business acumen. doctor hospital wants hit high score Covid deaths? would look real bad, 'lose license' kind bad. 

And government also going hand free money per death. Hell, money last stimulus long gone, approved next stimulus. Republicans' fault.

But course, facts matter, lies worth objective truth that's choose believe. SMFH indeed. really, ""great"" collectivism literally reduces individual cog worker ant, hive far important. People cannot *just go back*

These experts advise government goverment send gestapo dare friends want open business.

We literally gives way life experts nobody knows anything about. There's going back. Oh ffs.

Does anyone literally anything better do. Yeah makes sense close borders virus already here? 


This countrys stupidly europe, closed borders amd fucked many people virus already there. None taken. agree absurd. Unless area law serves indigent folks, mostly stay home right lawyer. admit system getting unbelievably backed up. criminal trials continued 9 months now. things resume, docket going backed year. guess get it.

I learned buzz coworkers people sending around articles CDC website. General consensus vaccinated March. get vaccine probably June July

Hmm not?

That's extremely unlikely timeline US citizen vaccine availability unless extenuating circumstances reasons wanting wait then. actually true: friend entire family got vaccinated heard doctor father. None would qualified priority groups.  think highly Americans. Well that‚Äôs different argument.
I actually don‚Äôt think UK, parts Europe, USA actually psychological capacity actually necessary get case numbers ‚Äòsafe‚Äô levels, doesn‚Äôt change fact schools open still significant transmission situation vital service young children especially priority many situations feel bad friend, sub misleading headlines sometimes. yes everything said correct. Ive sort accepted best mental health let time past becomes history let events play they're going to. think one way another PANDEMIC ends 2021. 0 cases covid anywhere all, issue things closed capacity limits mask requirements. 

This could late 2021, year now, could soon march April. Nobody knows. pessimist optimist, random redditor even health expert Ph. D. gonna play plays thing part smart like since March get vaccine. every intention doing. would say society whole want kids home avoidable. major hit productivity, even stay-at-home workers, corporations want either.

Is really society rather corporations? WTF talking about. Deaths surge post TG therefore whole ""missing hospitalizations"" meaningless. Oops kind obvious.

Nah dude I‚Äôve 17 years. keep solving problems over. Nothing new different. Unless pickup new technology stack isn‚Äôt cloud based, don‚Äôt much learn AWS/Azure side. 5: 1) boredom 2) sloth 3) gluttony 4) anxiety 5) loneliness.

It'll ok end :) That‚Äôs bullshit excuse. someone something morally wrong, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre hypocrite. 

The blame EVERYONE chooses ignore health rules, science, basic common decency. Politician, layperson, doesn‚Äôt matter, you‚Äôre assholes. Neither copying anything; licensed agreement. live smartest people go investment banking? Everyone I‚Äôve ever known went finance something similar extensive connections usually average slightly average student. look smart hindsight went field doesn‚Äôt require lot educational investment comparison medicine field requires doctorate, often end making ton money based investment. no, I‚Äôve never seen people particularly excellent academically even comes work ethic. proves point headline article 100% true (there deaths)

""deadliest"" implies dangerous adjusted people, absolute numbers. saying equal claiming flu deadly plane crash simply people die former.

I really care silly argument, I'm making mimic craziness smear campaign obsession Sweden. Merry Christmas everyone!

May live long prosper many better days ahead
üññ What's ""normal"" comes virus? really think term applies virus hell. work healthcare legitimate fear right going severe workforce shortages coming years people leaving health professions due exhaustion folks considering entering field decide risks associated pandemic. We‚Äôre seeing increase we‚Äôre actually concerned pipeline shrink. Chocolate coffeine??? botulism toxin kills acetylcholine receptors. receptors part mechanism muscle contraction also related sweating.

And definitely works! people come every six months armpits feet. actually Workers Compensation defense attorney CA (for 10 years now). COVID decent business it‚Äôs going go away eventually, wouldn‚Äôt recommend ‚Äúfocusing‚Äù right now. vaccines roll out... suddenly cases? Coincidence? No. People don‚Äôt know danger imminent death. you‚Äôre 62 finding hard breathe you‚Äôre sitting down, maybe dying? maybe you‚Äôre not, truth trouble breathing call help instead deciding doctor think ambulances expensive. Yes no.

Reddit echo chamber. go political subreddit like aboringdystopia, sure I'm going hear one side. However, Reddit *isn't* going suddenly start suggesting posts radical subreddits start looking vaguely political posts.

Communities like Facebook Youtube Twitter use machine learning suggest new content, tends radicalize people. easy start something vaguely political wind InfoWars bullshit. algorithms prioritize ""engagement"", positive negative, extreme opinions get people worked (and thus *coming back ad driven platforms*) tend get interest. Reddit's algorithm contrast promotes content interacted positively (upvotes), automatically quarantines content subreddit.

Reddit definitely concerning, get wrong, it's... old timer. really optimized information wars like Facebook Youtube, really glorified BBS steroids. use Reddit indoctrinate yourself, Youtube Facebook actively attempt indoctrinate you. difference actually pretty crucial. That's gonna ""Yike"" me... XD reason responsible headlines right now, _before_ vaccine kills someone. well past time remind people medicine, like everything else, subject statistics, means outliers. way, easy counter eventual freakout vaccine death ""well, yeah, that's one 3,300"". 

But no. Instead we've got New York Times, places, reporting [Dr. Fauci skews estimates based science, thinks people need Want really drive home ""it's hoax"" narrative? face pro-mask, pro-vaccine thinking America openly admit lying specifically sway public opinion. Great job, everyone, people totally going believe us now. anyone charting cumulative numbers vacines given per state overall? daily # shots given available? day California collapses reek disaster whole country. People want California fail lose nearly everything hey American people want it. United stand, together fall. 

Last, read that. Many places taking residents areas. Whether example state state county county etc. 

People need accept fact people going follow protocols directions. part rely people government. government busy focus ugly truth. government buffer last resort. surprised people noticed this. people can't get justice country makes think going get assistance pandemic. Justice much easier acquire health assistance. Jeez. hope church gives money actually need. don‚Äôt know Indian media :) I‚Äôm already peak knowledge

Peak reddit, like magically get shape become qualified enlist military sign gain interest. article explained various things going pretty well think: Lags reporting
* Allocating places staff give vaccine also needed treat covid patients
* Deliveries made predictable way hard time setting regular flow getting done efficiently
* communities access vaccines
* Even though states oversee deployment structure overall, leave specifics hospitals, companies, long term care facilities everyone equally equipped handle 24 hour double transoceanic flight. N95 mask whole way, face shield. Completed two week quarantine, symptoms.

The ocean crossing nearly empty. second ocean crossing leg full.

The filtration systems airplanes excellent, airport problematic. However, least, N95 trick. One million tests oer day, case need details rambling garbage. nuked Gandhi holiday cheer. Data scientists  According NYtime's covid vaccine line estimator, mom behind 23 million people vaccine due asthma making us high risk per CDC. dad, though, blessed better genes despite 65, behind 118 million people vaccine. guess eligible vaccine spring, see dad gets it. Ok see, even though deciding get treatment, start treating somebody, even think potential new patient likely live and/or fulfills triage priority list, can't throw streets? generally make sense, right results tying tired paramedics long time.

For discharges significant number people probably die soon want continue throw staffing them, mostly people would probably live, want make sure stable enough situation probably still live discharge? Money talks shit actually hurts people. 

Even then, leaders blame people....and thing happens climate change... facing Titans instead virus least would able hug friends tea together. I‚Äôm doctor, worked several years college realizing wanted applied med school. wasn‚Äôt close oldest person med school class. course majority people went straight people young 19-20 (two year transfer programs) you‚Äôll older man/woman. 

In short it‚Äôs course doable even uncommon. said always tell people thinking applying med school don‚Äôt unless think it‚Äôs thing life happy. It‚Äôs long, stressful, involved, insanely expensive career path. med school, residency, fellowship put 10 years training college finishing heading real world. Well worth though it‚Äôs want. That's people lazy put work. Fighting ignorant reason takes effort, all; able shit chess board fly away, all. people willing did, would much easier everyone.

It's discouraging, know, goddamn important. I'm sure Jared right top /s Guilty asshole. they're asymptomatic spread somebody else, person dies...yeah, that's kind homicide. yes let‚Äôs keep locking country down. Politicians absolutely fucked pandemic (no Trump Reddit. congress bias fucks) makes feel much normal. I‚Äôm wreck I‚Äôm worried won‚Äôt ever ‚Äúreturn normal‚Äù makes feel little relieved remember I‚Äôm going alone.  Yes.

This placebo. Merry Christmas LA. Hype? Merry Christmas LA. Bloomberg number added onto CDC put 1.01 number, tomorrow CDC number posted Bloomberg number upped whatever CDC number is. irrationally terrified this? Every post make involves freaking COVID. billions people living life fine. Yes, getting virus minuscule % actually dying. VAST majority people living lives without fear taking common sense precautions. need chill stop giving people medical personal advice. You‚Äôre qualified. Ya well mayors governors can‚Äôt even follow rules I? Rules thee me. could‚Äôve lot support early didn‚Äôt go rules send covid positive patients nursing homes. course ... people say freedom visit family eat much important covid hoax worse flu  mean market rate biglaw NYC 190k plus bonus sooooooo....

When say worst exactly mean? It‚Äôs certainly worst terms lucrative. mean hours? Competition? Mostly residencies IMO. Schools expanding capacity, afaik increase funding residency slots coincide this. Lmao Yup. loving neighbors Idaho send us sick since they've run capacity. gov many people reject idea mask mandate. 

I think need work together, times feels backwards people reject safety protocols take resources follow guidance. Get better job apply better companies. Gotta find placement patients, problem. Many nursing homes take new admissions tested positive Covid. returning residents, require two negative Covid tests taking back. either two groups discharged, physician dictate discharge summary write discharge medication orders.

Others stable enough discharged. weaned oxygen, need accepted home health agency, SNF benefits expired case managers scrambling find another placement, made enough progress physical therapy discharged, appealing discharge...it's simply dressing wheeling door. complicated process needs nursing, physicians, case management coordination. people already overworked is. can't magically create beds. Tongue cheek. Science never like religion are.  Hey, another dev, gotta say, kudos achieved feel ""super laid back"" nothing complicated send slack messages computer equivalent connecting legos

might actual case specifically horribly misleading. There's reason pay high amount shit regular dev know order successful insane. Correct, I'm going around ~$350k debt medical school alone graduate vaccines solely defined 3 things:

1. molecular structure active ingredient - biology
2. formulation non-active ingredient chemicals needed preserve deliver active ingredient - chemistry
3. manufacturing process needed cost effectively produce scale billions doses - chemical engineering

just know first 2 mean know make 3rd. example, Biontech vaccine lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA. Lab scale manufacture LNPs done hand. make billions doses hand, enough PhD biochemists this. need manufacturing machinery process this. chemical engineers do.

In short, chemical engineering distinct chemistry distinct biology. need 3 bring vaccine market. think might also infectious strain taking hold Happy birthday dr faulci place control pandemic 9% positive test rate? there‚Äôs evidence new strain invalidated status quo (there isn‚Äôt hasn‚Äôt), fear mongering what-ifs speculative, sensationalist media looking clicks articles need right now.

all previous post made couple months ago.
So now, let us formally add
""The Fauci Effect"" list.

Thanks Thank god wrong. don‚Äôt know 5K day even possible. dakotas &amp; Midwest decreasing across board helps immensely üôèüèº Nobody applying medical school career pseudo-politician flip flopped legislative recommendations 10 9 months. Medical school far greater investment sacrifice that. many idiots upvote dogshit? need another income really know it‚Äôs contagious? could extra [super variant makes seem contagious. 

‚Äú80% new transmissions caused fewer 20% carriers‚Äîthe vast majority people infect others none all, it‚Äôs select minority individuals aggressively spreading virus.‚Äù
 
In words, super spreaders could skew numbers. 

If 100 people infected new variant 20 super spreaders would infect people 100 people older variant 10 super spreaders. 

I hope makes sense. WSB Cheers hopefully, ‚ÄúTrump Effect‚Äù. active citizen. didn‚Äôt mean completely stopped testing. still testing people don‚Äôt really seem care anymore based friends said live there. Engineering Social media mistake. can‚Äôt think one platform isn‚Äôt toxic. $$$$$$$$$$$$$ going say. Since lot either retiring dieing Covid 19 well going demand upcoming years health professionals. Looking state economy enter terrible depression people looking careers going stable. local budgets decimated cushy government jobs see lot budgets cuts includes teachers, social workers, social programs etc. Fauci. 


If want career go study health sector quick. said, initial half dose Oxford vaccine (with 90% efficacy symptoms) also 59% efficacy asymptomatic infections. far know, sterilising immunity would block transmission.

Unfortunately dosage tested enough unlikely approved unless AZ/Oxford pull fucking finger trial properly. Don‚Äôt dramatic. It‚Äôs ‚Äúnever see them‚Äù deal. vaccine, light end tunnel whole fucking time considerate spread disease. would hell lot sooner everyone responsible start, like places like New Zealand, no, people would rather go kill relatives peoples‚Äô relatives make temporary sacrifice.

Good fucking god, people made steeper sacrifices times war, yet much people we‚Äôre way worse state be. yeah, I‚Äôm pissed, local hospitals full aren‚Äôt even fucking ambulances people get car accidents. People dying treatable accidents health emergencies space them. didn‚Äôt like that, people like fucked rest us. get haven‚Äôt got pretty much chosen LOL. Shit post Lol remember posts years ago. would shit IMGs program so. matched orthopaedics IMG. Keep feeling insecure. Ummm... pretty easy tell what‚Äôs happening normal. $$ UK variant Covid spreading like crazy. suspect we‚Äôre going see coming weeks across US.

We far behind UK abilities test/track.

Potentially even tougher road ahead us fir next months UK variant overtakes US. still won‚Äôt shut down. Eh suck Benadryl .. it‚Äôll fine originated Wuhan - sure. Another Coronavirus similar sequenced bats several years ago logically makes sense virus distant cousin that. also know almost categorically virus wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúman-made‚Äù closely linked bat virus gene-editing technology nowhere near advanced enough modify viruses like that.  .. fascism.. üôÑ way lies American people ends justify means truly inspires me. can't wait get medical license.  Sidney Powell showing low bar is. takes much I, poor person figure could late 20s go paying bills racking debt? least 1 100 people earth tested positive COVID-19. wait inside ER, usually whatever space available. ton places sit ERs.

Source: Paramedic waited 11 hours one patient inside ER 6 years ago. new occurrence, exacerbating problem that's going wait times years. 2 friends graduated UT law school, probably high class, 2013. HOUSTON (aka super high income area) salaries straight law school medium sized firms $170k each. short - lawyers make ton money graduate good schools right time get good jobs. ü§£ Yup, I'm 100% this. think important note however large majority NYCs cases happened understood widespread virus was. People going parties, riding subway, working offices, spreading virus without idea widespread was. estimated 100,000 people virus NYC time hit first 200 cases. incubation period long, symptoms start takes 10 days average symptoms turn severe. 

NYC absolutely very, good response pandemic fully realized. went fully lockdown, nearly everybody wore masks, everybody stayed indoors, cases/deaths dropped rapidly. Daily deaths went average nearly 1,000 100~ end may, dropped 10 4-5 month span summer. fuck system even allow shit happen though? Ive known people gone process spite lines 'caring others' 'doing good' sure treat med students young doctors like absolute shit. even get kind stockholm syndrome defend whole process went through.  get that, seen Florida states south? restrictions bars dining, 30 thousand plus fans football games, etc. might think restrictions lax it‚Äôs still different world compared states. definitely hero. 20 people counting laughed. Thanks old you? 70,000 70 surrounding areas also served fire department ambulances. They'll call whoever available. problem confusion - 
do want help, cant help theyre overwhelmed right now?

and mind im assuming obvious - dont care - N/A pandemic assume human beings. don‚Äôt give crap herd immunity world vaccine What‚Äôs point making 500K year work like 66+ hours every week? Like literally come home work shower go bed get ready work like hours Computer science degree. 17 years exp. make 90K south Florida. 

Don‚Äôt believe see internet salaries. Ones virus doesn‚Äôt give shit choice individual. never implied that, dangerous disease children. ifr around 0.0005% children ages ifr 0.0007% children ages 5-17 don‚Äôt live California. violation orders here. yeah, 9 months crazy short. 8 yr old isn‚Äôt going remember terribly much. Snippets there. talking 2nd grade. barely recall 2nd grade all. distinctly remember kid sticking staple outlet third grade, that‚Äôs one stupid moment.

Kids super resilient, aren‚Äôt going care long don‚Äôt make unpleasant. def got better defense mean many players became great spot one point  think lot pre-meds assuming would easier get pandemic year (a lot schools omitting deferring MCAT scores) also reports summer lot students deferring 100% online school sucks, schools would likely accept lower performing applicants.

It‚Äôs anecdotal, know people planning applying next cycle, pushed last cycle mentality. Sorry fake news. I‚Äôm med student peer mentor/application advisor. number applicants growing many years. 

Also, can‚Äôt decide less year. prerequisites take minimum 2 years get through. MCAT plus extraneous stuff nearly requirement days (research publications, tons volunteering, shadowing, etc.)

Classic example news outlets seeing trend attributing flavor week. most, Fauci pandemic inspired people fence go applying, would already planning far advance.  Yes, usually houses well. Lies internet connections  Anyone medical condition bad prevents comfortably breathing wearing mask isolating home much possible, almost certain need hospitalisation get it.

Even asthmatic, turns it‚Äôs *easier* breathe wearing kn95. extra CO2 I‚Äôm re-breathing forces lung-blood membrane up-regulate O2 transferred bloodstream. extra humidity I‚Äôm re-breathing definitely soothes asthma, though sounds counterintuitive.

It‚Äôs bit like breathing paper bag you‚Äôre panic attack, practice actually get works make body feel better now. doesn‚Äôt sound like civil discussion. ashamed can‚Äôt discussion someone thinks different Going med school great route 30 years old $500k+ debt making $32k year resident. been, 20 years....

I disagree you..... Times Square closed public NYE 6 pm. I'm sure festivities happening around it, though. new variant appears 70% transmissible current virus, yes, faster transmission means cases shorter period time equals pressure health care systems. good current pandemic, hence reaction countries around world. far doesn‚Äôt appear lethal, obviously good news. 

It necessarily ‚Äúfrom UK‚Äù. UK discovered much genomic sequencing counties therefore discovered first. Since discovered September going many countries now. 

At stage believe vaccines effective it. Mutations expected, it‚Äôs viruses do, one mutated many times. far haven‚Äôt mutations scientists worried regarding vaccine effectiveness. Eventually virus likely mutate way makes vaccine ineffective hopefully time happens many people vaccinated vaccine adjusted work mutation. expected something would worry unless scientists start raising alarm. Ok, good Buddhist look like absolute moron tell problems. false. increase Sweden‚Äôs population causing linear increase deaths. Deaths much complicated.  LOL, hope live see it. Good! new normal crew prevelent sub covid deniers covid conspiracy theorists, agree disagree that? top people perfectly content told indefinitely, included updated description.

That's including thread, rest sub terrible mental health. problem reading thread r/covid19 comments basically logical.  Pretty sure Pfizer reaction. confirms Moderna issue, somewhat expected since they‚Äôre similar. make anyone feel better lol damn, that‚Äôs fucking lot! can‚Äôt wait seeing noticable drop deaths like 1.5-2.5 months. heartbreaking, like entire thread, stay strong - hope son brighten day! Atlanta, club holding NYE bash first line advertisement is: ""Leave mandatory mask home!"" odd mask mandate, there's mandatory mask, whatever. surprising. battle depression anxiety finally overcome it. 

Then came corona.

Instagram models need hide swollen faces, Honestly feel like much better place mentally now. also realized pandemic ends might still hang people person. Lol love going anywhere. mean, you‚Äôre adult. you‚Äôre America ain‚Äôt whole world. control life. Work towards moving somewhere less shitty. Deaths per million:

Germany: 283

USA: 921



How even think remotely similar, much less USA way link agrees also, I‚Äôm providing extra. sure you‚Äôd think case fatality rate would relevant here. post 4-Chan, claiming inside source World Bank pretty much spot predictions (from way back January February) except prediction Sars-Cov2 mutation originating South America would raise CFR 20% double transmissibility. 

All Covid mutations starting get worried dire early 2020 prediction. acceptable government office run people know never know, determining whether reasons travel valid enough? Suppose close friend emergency, family, government decides since family member, cant go see friend. Would okay scenario? Eeeee. link 9 minute podcast.

Anyone listen give TL;DR ?? Duhhhh. say weren't. implying place get covid.  often people speak previously somewhat extensivly exposed (I remember one cases years ago English older Gentleman stroke spoke Welsh afterwards, turns boy lived whales blitz. never spoken Welsh back then, listened people speaking understanding little it.) Chinese vaccine entirely different mRNA vaccine Pfizer Moderna lmao. China haters two things common: blind hate malignant ignorance. many users pointed out, don‚Äôt look Covid death numbers only. First all, reporting sampling standards differ states, making comparisons impossible, also, good response minimizes Covid deaths, mitigates health consequences social disruption. considering according SIDRAP (run Biden‚Äôs new Covid advisor Michael Osterholm) 62 percent excess deaths right ages 25-44 Covid deaths. 

That good response keeps us safe. safe Covid. Excess deaths measure quality public health response takes account.

Here see excess 1 5? Honestly surprised numbers' low. feel like it‚Äôs way latter. part social circle damn near every person 50 person group diagnosed extreme mental disorders dip recently resented wife vibing despite depression, anxiety, PTSD. I‚Äôm letting people failed rehab picked new addictions group enabled people supported stopping therapy medications group actively getting worse. drew head called monster done spiraling nonsense telling psychotic purely jealousy spite. pandemic truly made lot already bad mental situations exponentially worse it‚Äôs absolutely tiring deal ‚Äî I‚Äôm gonna focus growing path leave others past spiral since I‚Äôm mood deal others trying bring drain them. actually covered nose too... I'm trying get political anything, crap. Even Trump, previously said COVID flu ,has said need vaccine point. basically public figure continues downplay this, getting ridiculous. spent 5 min near mom outside giving rent check. Thats it.

Yeah, no. That‚Äôs considered high risk CDC. believe catch virus way. I‚Äôd go far saying virtually impossible. probably happened room mate exposed longer, caught it, got room mate. lack sleep one largest contributors psychosis, mental health issues not, don‚Äôt sleep days you‚Äôll see shadow people.

Especially grandma refuse get vaccined, reason people around wear mask protect her. basically good, safe, treatment exists, available, almost one get access it. I'll say that's dumb situation. Dumb tragic lot people. depends mask though. take cloth masks ""i'm taking seriously"", take ""i'm half assing either know better want wear something bothers me"".

maybe can't get back normal masks, even surgical ffp2. indoor setting, everybody wearing them, it'll reduce risk infection. So...75% California women probably go Pfizer. I‚Äôve lucky.

Biden gave DT walking papers 2020 goal America never eradication, get deaths hospitalizations acceptable levels, goal reached stop social distancing wearing masks. get CA government forced many industries proven vectors transmission following proper safety protocols (e.g. outdoors dining) shut without assistance, yet forced hospitals stop elective surgeries? According NIH, 10% elective surgeries result ICU admissions. nobody talking this? get hospitals make $$$, get (along entertainment industry) strong special interest lobbies, inconsistency arbitrariness whose livelihoods get destroyed (without backing science data) name public health interests, kills public's trust, IMO sadly leading outcome CA experiencing now. think big part story that's getting ignored. mention hypocrisy demonstrated government leaders (e.g. Newsom, Breed). government special interests need part rather marketing solely fault people staying home.

Goddamit China terrible track record comes making vaccines, rediculous. ranges vaccines offer enough protection way vaccines cause actual harm.

The chinese pharma industry joke anyways. US Europe produce far medicines vaccines.

In fact chinese friend told people china prefer western vaccines chinese vaccines. Imagine that. It‚Äôs Christmas, wound me?

Honestly? feel like pandemic hurt much.


I say that, I've lost motivation hobbies. feel even detatched normal. Aside mom, talk one person every days. want actually social again, good gamer friends pandemic made jg even harder stay social... Massachusetts. needs higher forgetting total cost living also. Whereas higher degrees allow time work moonlight, professional health allow part time job. Total cost living better indicator debt end taking on. greatest dad joke ever told... court need person? New data leads shifts pandemic approach. sounds like we're getting better idea what's needed data comes in. it‚Äôs destroying lung capacity rest life crap lesson I'm seeing want money, pay taxes say church Covid numbers fake. haven‚Äôt even looked though. follow excess deaths american too. [This ah, good you. me, shit made anxiety worse, health anxiety always one main acts. think motivation end goal people/powers ‚Äúfear mongering‚Äù world? Also introvert. happy home alone. lots friends, hang online. stresses public people barley know admist pandemic. don‚Äôt know convince mom unsafe. told makes uncomfortable, pretty much told get it.  Well-formulated response. kind weird think it, literally type this, there's presently hundreds thousands (if millions) people across U.S. exposed Christmas gatherings virus. 

That's going come roost starting week, really onslaught mid-to-late January infections evening start turning hospitalizations, ventilations deaths. 

The fact even without Christmas wave there's articles like hospitals overwhelmed concerning, get lot worse I'm afraid. virus highly seasonal none measures done much anything stop it. worst states deaths per capita still toughest restrictions. Covid run burn schedule. vaccine save lives back end came late much that. figure med schedule counselor psychiatrist insurance switched year, got dropped (or accurately suddenly became unable afford either).  Shits pretty rough since then. Scottish spy? ü§îü§îü§î Yes question essentially. Huawei design phones own. Foxconn manufacturing iPhones China magically give Huawei secrets.

Now know anything vaccines. Lol poor little sensitive American Florida numbers see fake. could tell they're still going woman got rid fake numbers.

I stopped caring saving generation back April... Keep mind 2nd shot month after, 1.5 month today would early even Dude. get it. loads better boom pandemic. work healthcare. I'm exhausted FDA historically like accept data nations - claimed population US unique enough (racial diversity, obesity) etc data generated nations may apply. said 3 years referring residency, interest starts compounding, increasing urgency pay off.

Did read link posted? ""This year's medical school graduates owe average 200-250k total educational debt, premedical debt included."" Whether average physician chooses pay minimum monthly payments, saying burdonsome pay debt roughly equal yearly earnings. possible pay 3 years adopt lavish lifestyle decide invest money elsewhere. physician chooses drag loans decade maxize interest pay, time made millions chosen spend invest money elsewhere. wounded Honestly feel like mental health gotten better, idk I‚Äôm definitely seeing fewer parties there‚Äôs one across street right now. 

I call Covid Parties, every party (potential) Covid party. Eh, depends from. use mend fair amount, also use ""fix"" lot, depending I'm talking about. 

We often mend clothing, rather fix it, example. fix flat tire, rather mend it. interesting hear. hope father recovered completely. US mend things, *fix* things. less occasionally: *repair* things. i'm also american think glaz-wee-jin Measures take days weeks impact numbers.

Scientist believe likely cause [the allergic reactions associated (rare) allergic reactions vaccines drugs well....

As trials I‚Äôm sure. may ethical reasons it. It‚Äôs people severe allergies allergic ingredients warning put (in Canada least). help Yee hawing jackasses respect care others pandemic..(most anyway). ""I got truck! ain't care virus"". ""Our football teams good Next year, grab another beer honey"". Easy fix: check patient's social media. they've travelling holidays going large gatherings, take O2 give people actually deserve it. ptsd. pandemic, gotten point rarely needing prn meds. Pandemic triggered heck causing need increase daily meds prn meds. also switched jobs put distance really horrible memories. half time I'm completely numb feeling hard. I'm starting counseling back soon new insurance kicks in. case even medicine. think dermatology requires best brightest? Absolutely not, well compensated good schedule. Well yeah cramps otherwise. There‚Äôs gonna drop low reporting past couple days we‚Äôve 7-day average ~3,200 deaths day unfortunately percentage doctors make much.

The vast majority doctors make $150k less. wonderful news! med students better :) ‚ÄúCatching it‚Äù ... one? strain variant could skew away previous datasets, proving so. Cause they'd refuse take old people mean ‚Äúshining‚Äù. know reality, social media becomes *obviously bad idea*. many people convinced untrue things that's bubble talks social media? much ""manufacturing"" vaccine teach tech behind it? know anything biology vaccines tech world seems like two rather removed. China manufactures (basically) world's iPhones, yet know technology behind it. Yeah, 6 posts saying something, dealing it, much coward even acknowledge bringing something else. we're unable explain ""trying explain concept humor"", distract Merkel literally power longer Xi almost decade lol

Implying that's totalitarianism, what? non-point conversation injected into, stated ""credibility"" required criticize totalitarianism, also, bonus, asked poster mean ""your fake election""? That's something possibly answer, complain oh mean fail badly it. play games defense totalitarian fucks = shit wish real reddit TOS. Yea, imagine little boy interested medicine Fauci.

But people pre-med 3-4 years, MCAT prep year two, ton work get ready even apply. even vaccine, going get back normal summer?

I‚Äôve seen many ignorant people afraid get vaccine due quickly made. think scientist doctors blindly put stuff in, found worked people pushed forward. Completely ignoring many months testing. concern due serval reasons

1. decades, maybe even combined century, vaccine experience general we(scientists) know work people shouldn‚Äôt take major health issues, pregnant, young, allergic it. 

2. make new vaccine flu every year right? 

3. virus dangerous flu (though idiots think it‚Äôs not, remember last time flu caused LA ICU‚Äôs fill beyond capacity? Neither I?) gotten shit ton funding finding vaccine.


So, ignorance greatly delay soon get back normal? I've wondering well mean since still know air travel require vaccinated there's point issuing vaccination document right now. wonder though air travel via vaccination certificates hospitals etc records vaccinated? could always issue vaccination certificates later guess. 

A easier route guess would probably easing border restrictions countries vaccinated majority population. fine, part, covid. light drinker, maybe month, whole life. cope boredom started drinking often, gradually increased point dependent enjoy isolation. I‚Äôm therapy depression/alcohol dependence.

I always thought dream work home deal people, dream anymore. really brought light important outdoor hobbies, rec sports/gym, necessary mental health. it‚Äôs winter I‚Äôve hit time low. happened hospitalized week birthday, fuck 2020 Maybe so, flu worth suffering. personally, cold put commission least month, I'd rather either. boyfriends uncle needed ICU. waited four days get placed room five hours away. feel genuinely sorry you. People like attack anything shout praise vaccine rooftops. legitimate concern. Nobody knows vaccine effectiveness strain. tested updated required. tio can't eat garlic onion anymore since recovered covid. Says smells like rotten meat. Unfortunately majority eat uses garlic onion. hopes nerves get back normal 2-4yrs. Pathetic. 

Maybe, maybe, one day hold right accountable actions. fault American moderate. also sure ‚Äúleft‚Äù referencing entity exists extreme fringes two primary American center-right right wing political entities.

Funny group people think need soft equally problematic DUIs. problem rednecks drinking driving leftists telling whole time? Fuck me, many people American left killed then? Someone hold responsible DUIs causing holier-than-thou messaging!



Lol. actually brainwashed. one many American military turned expatriate dissident. Maybe come spend years outside states see fell victim propaganda, best us can, really mental deficiency leaving unable contextual. many people grades apply holidays?

Iiiiit's circle life...? consolation likely crazy, low IQ. going routine test also vector well idea public space even 30 seconds mask plenty time catch it. would think enough completely prevent virus? Maybe assume he's also advocating continuing lockdowns? definitely big deal people wear masks get herd immunity (hopefully summer). There's nothing difficult wearing piece fabric face months public protect can't vaccinated. still get groceries, go work etc. all. posted another another sub:

I‚Äôm gonna call bit overhyped bs this. think Fauci could influence inspire people go medical field? Yes. think major effect cycle (which applications really begin March end Nov usually)? extent seeing increase, applicants didn‚Äôt even know Fauci‚Äôs name decided would applying. Going medicine drop hat decision. think you‚Äôll see inspire increase applicants explain huge increase applicants. Applying Med school 4+ year process, like going military nearly time (no judgement military video compares increase military volunteering 9/11 this). 

He‚Äôs great guy, like anyone applied medical school easily tell near 20% increase applicants primarily due Fauci cycle. Damn, crazy. I‚Äôm California. may supply shortage hasn‚Äôt hit Kaiser yet.

The poster responding said medicine profitable, isn't, compared finance. I'm 4/5, already depressed whole thing. Gotcha pandemic related mental disorder! know kerfuffles related Oxford/AZ vaccine, led FDA bit skeptical it. chance could reject it? make decision?

If reject it, happens? Oxford/AZ vaccine never released US? another trial? so, long take? underestimate impact online schooling college students. feel everyday. Spot on. 

Source: American. Lol Chinese government controls everything do. Terrifying? Precisely. brain tries leave traumatic event sometimes just... Can't. Lol. Innocent proven guilty except black. 

Healthy proven sick isn‚Äôt covered right. Lol. Hell, SCOTUS rules already Spanish flue. Guess decided? Friend coma brain injury spoke English accent months. weird. Hey leave us lot south m4 alone. ones sound like city folk sound like pirates. choose it. Things OK, seeing means one suffers Yesterday another article said exact opposite worry. hate modern day news everyone quick desperate get first story. Apparently new variant around since September problem time new variant discovered honestly late stopped spread travel restrictions came place especially connected world today hundreds thousands flights flying country. placing travel restrictions one single country probably much especially variant likely already countries travel ban placed on. countries alot sequencing quite likely new variant world countries simply picked yet well. thus - reason keep keepin' (keep living). strength that!  town, glad met doctors access Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) attending patients, according report.

This horrible makes angry. college student pandemic drastically changes life everyday. Online school really sucks. Med school works get right speciality. Yes, go debt schooling, residency pays peanuts, specialties like Ortho pay $500-600k/year.

I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôd $175k/year family medicine job, specialties paying least around $300k+, it‚Äôs bad deal. Reported blocked yeah! pretty sure voting / labor day explains that.

anecdotally - circle people loosened still claim they‚Äôre ‚Äúdoing mask/distancing same.‚Äù thought. issue laws. wore mask around not. kept distance similar situation. you‚Äôre worried sure I‚Äôd say skip it. Better safe sorry. cousin Paris developed schizophrenia staying tiny studio long... sucks man...

But PFAS article.  Saw comment old neck beard that's working social media close 25 years. said social media completely dependent toxic people drive engagement. stands normal societal norms head. Normally toxic people considered problem. social media anyone pushes back toxic people considered problem people run things. Lmao According article, population Morocco 36 million.

People selfish. goes show live spirit Republican POTUS called hoax, downplayed it, said would blow away Easter, devoted zealots followed suit. I'd prefer cash prize thanks people infect housemates even spouses, rate spousal transmission 30%, look table 3 

For explanation, check article ""Why COVID-19 patients infect many others, whereas don‚Äôt spread virus all?"" quote article. referred getting transferred place appropriate medical treatment them. certainly dont forget hands, especially work, ever touched face, mask, ppe would extremely obvious done would black, habits carry thread anti-vaxxers literally harassing bullying people minding business getting vaccinated.

Ok, I'm showing age. China responsible data, countries conducting trial themselves. portion quoted nothing saying.

1 virus genetics drifting - mean vaccine needs get predictive possible mutations roll advance continuous fashion- similar software updates. - never done .

2. fact mutations higher r value may offset ability vaccine push r robustly 1.0 leaving us steady infection rate.

3. People get vaccinated probability infecting others risk reduced means likely take risks become super spreaders 

4. modeled taken account 
By policy makers

These points need answers 
Otherwise 10 yrs sounds right ... good. Botox filler. British people going victims xenophobia. Oh tables turned.  (relatively rushed) vaccine starts zombie apocalypse? Yes, said took rapid PCR. We're still waiting PCR result. said based new studies. Important read actual articles headline. trouble finding numbers. looked time maybe that's got wrong. see 104 daily cases per 100k vs 53k?

Come on, tell ingrained right accept that. matter social norms medical advice me. enough people vaccinated reasonably assume given stranger safe, wear mask would testing?

Is compared country countries general test enough?

Considering amount cases compared tests seems ton.  So, vaccines still effective. Good know. sure it‚Äôs fault. No, he/she blaming employer company.

Okay, possibly stupid questions someone medical field:

1a) stable enough sit ambulance 8 hours waiting admit, really need ambulance? 

1b) much ""sustaining"" ambulance crew do?

2) ambulances priority walk-ins, triage based?

I mean, ambulance crew ability assess site tell patient, ""You're stable, get hospital. going wait 8 hours either way drive we'll available help someone else.""

Also, fuuuuuuuuuck, California screwed. worst worst still come. Stay home bake chocolate chip cookies. would kill weren‚Äôt coward don‚Äôt think read article, look quote. new data surveys many Americans willing take vaccine. worthy receive truth.

Real cases likely 15-20x confirmed ones back then. probably 3x now. government part.

Meanwhile, doctors aren't. state, essentially stopped vaccinating Saturday Sunday (only like 150 vaccines given out.)

Our medical institutions acting sense urgency, nobody seems care. Millions doses sit unused people take weekend holidays off. Yeah think deaths reported yet bad number positions artificially limited.

But that‚Äôs reality is. *People primary physician.* stay home decide ambulance might expensive bad Covid symptoms.

My friend got Covid September really good insurance. shortness breath fainting falling down. called told call 911, sounded like run mile, sitting down. 

He said breaths he‚Äôs taking ambulance it‚Äôs expensive. said vision blurry still drove ER. happened pass driving great, believe danger cars road.

My friend sent home ER, night ended crawl phone call 911 save life. gave o2 almost died ICU survived 3 week hospital stay.

Per worldometer, US population 332m death rate 1019 per million. Japan's 126 million, third ours, death rate 25.

If we'd done well had, there'd approximately 8,000 dead Americans instead 338,000. Conversely, they'd done poorly did, they'd around 129,000 dead Japanese instead 3,200. Tough spot, hope works out! strain spreads best.

Strawman/slippery slope. clearly overpriced, above, money used help vaccinate others, what's issue? We're talking probably 1m 500,000 people would pay skip line, significant across entire US. I'd argue ensure money well spent. Otherwise, it.

I'd favor paying people get vaccine, supply much greater demand.  Here's better idea. Fine arrest actual meaning. throw huge party shouldnt get slap wrist $800 fine. $25k 6 months jail. sort real quick. Caught party spread rona others there? Manslaughter charges every fatality. Maybe people wont flippant restrictions. sociologist saying Western countries people see rules restrictions freedoms liberties can't distinguish tyranny public health measures. Whereas East mindset freedom distinguish clearly two. Plus Asia SARS MERS outbreaks experience dealing coronavirus outbreaks already. Hospitalization needs vary exponentially age. country that's years younger average may half IFR hospital capacity needs. there's lot countries lot years younger.

There might something else going mountainous regions well. Nobody's done real scientific research this, since improving oxygen levels basic first treatment, stands reason descending 500 feet elevation could effective going hospital. Vitamin D, C, Zinc could difference life death 100%. many studies reports thyhave said majority people dying COVID severe vitamin deficiency.

I'd also throw Quercetin mix. remember, doctors giving 100,000iu vitamin day patients severely ill COVID. Start supplementing daily 5,000. 10,000 3 weeks exposed never stop supplementing it. Eh plenty people traveling aren‚Äôt science deniers, lazy take religion coveting wealth, power, fame. That's dangerous one. We've gotta fix political system one. imagine people hold least ridiculous beliefs kind. sounds like UK's ""let's give trying control it"" policy back March, worked wonderfully far. There‚Äôs lot intolerance world. ‚ÄòAmerica beautiful‚Äô ass. hope turn place around.

People flawed health staff that. Sure shouldn't, maybe someone makes bad choice - consequences follow.

Its comfortable admit, would rather resources go someone taking proper precautions someone wildly spreading virus disinformation. didn‚Äôt come Pfizer that‚Äôs sure. Especially texas also, rep state, relatives proudly said would go 2 consecutive gatherings 17 20 people ""because forbidden"".
Most college education, goes show means shit cases. Question: US actually monitoring new strains? I'd find extremely surprising US orders magnitudes cases developed new strains mutations.

Dammit! seems like live Japan (both citizen non-citizen) away short business trip, permitted reentry. perhaps depends reason abroad? mentioned business trip, dunno students, etc. I'm pretty sure us Pacific Asia region, single new community spreading case within... say 10km home would cause grave concern. ""diplomatic"" talk, means might get small freak out.

But others, would like ""10km? neighbor gets COVID here.""

Welp, wild year  comment person non Swedish

No, didn't. said, imprecise regarding wording, nationality person involved irrelevant. Don‚Äôt know brought nationality didn‚Äôt anything it. 

Simply talking person traveled Britain - place potentially dangerous variant virus circulating - found variant virus.

As said, matter person British, Swedish, Mongolian - came Britain. Even Swedish government recognised danger banned entry people Britain, unless Swedish citizens ""transport goods like"".

What incredible government gone extent banning entry non-Swedish nationals Britain, require Swedish nationals quarantined, even come country.

I also remember Tegnell Closing borders, opinion, ridiculous, COVID-19 every European country now.  concerns movements inside Sweden. knappis said ""\[r\]est assured though, variant likely already spreading Sweden"" possible travelers required isolate/quarantine.

Until recently border wide open Swedish government idea many people arriving country carrying virus, done anything stop spreading virus locals.

In case person Britain protect Swedish people government has. Especially clearly said. ""If go public health guidelines put list care"" 100% choice make decisions.

You‚Äôre fully entitled opinion. wonder many people voted Brexit also support closing borders due COVID (i.e. evil immigrants).

Brexiters Trump voters probably share lot values. 40.96% 33.33% ? mental gymnastics help avoid reckoning totals, seems. Could bunch things, dont know yet afaik.

Infact think Australias borders still prevents imports covid countries. countries like Europe etc really quarantine rules/travel bans specific countries. there's always possibility covid imported.

Not without called nation racists, Japan gets pass though true thousands Swedes living UK returning holidays requires qurantine?

Is ban simply foreign travellers, restrictions ever quarantined Swedes?

If case...why bother ban? feel sorry everyone know Republicans definitely displayed level corruption Dems dream allowing made public. amount conservative officials blatantly ousted corrupt, anti science hypocrites astonishing.

AU almost got zero second wave hit Victoria. guess trying point UK could done strict lockdown around time. believe earlier July numbers even lower (around half July 30 figure). interesting different countries react - around 500 enough trigger harsh lockdowns Australia, whereas UK previously much seen much greater numbers seem viewed 500 low enough number open up. I'm saying either wrong time. we've seen Victoria, Australia, one two people lead significant outbreaks, zero, least number easily managed contact tracers,

Government taking decisions based science citizens mind better one lying corrupt. small factor less people dying hospital means less quickly deaths reported. true can't distinguish two. I'm pretty sure people think like either contracted virus and/or passed vulnerable family friends possibly killed them. They're apparently unaware fact every hospital country currently number COVID patients. Locations less spread overwhelmed ICU compared somewhere like LA currently suffering ongoing disaster.

So hospital Bumfucksville Iowa 3 patients whole hospital, COVID hoax hospitals countrywide fine.

Yea Japans government done good coronavirus societies expectations work I'd say care citizens life enjoyment either Yes blame Whitmer job primary factor worn year me. mental, emotional, social cost pandemic hit people hard. yes imperative society minimize spread.

Oh, need pay people stay home business cash pay bills needed Blame mass protest spreader events. muh family Americans gone ‚Äúvaluing‚Äù individualism utterly obsessed - point nothing else matters. concept collectivism, context, seems offend us. couldn‚Äôt agree mean literally 2 weeks ago shit happened school like anyone seems give fuck, hard get away either apparently. suggesting data withheld? really way control it. half ass measures working.

Maybe paper anybody enforcing it? see malls packed, essentially lockdown Same. work live events we‚Äôre feeling like summer fall 2021 going explosion tours. huge touring acts negotiations tours starting Aug-Sept, feel like soon get theatres clubs open audience there. Fingers crossed. What's real plan considering contagious something stop anyways? Locking period time see cases spike done. 

If completely shutdown inter-country travel 6 months, would completely devastate world trade homeless population 1000x, virus would still around. Population density doesn‚Äôt really determine spread COVID-19 much population crowding does. is, persons-per-bedroom much higher correlation virus persons-per-square-mile. Japan doesn‚Äôt housing crisis concentration poverty many places US helps despite much denser cities. Sakoku 2: Pandemic Bogaloo approved use people pre-existing conditions elderly. Furthermore, approved use hospitalized setting basically small window use portion population. Well, don‚Äôt know anything me. don‚Äôt live complete shithole suburbia, know lot people travel far often definitely want shit cereal Lockdown longer solution U.K.

We treat way it. 

The socioeconomic crisis kill people Covid. Sakoku 2: Pandemic Bogaloo But-- inevitable. vaccine coming. loads people dying right died years even decades happened meet one wrong person infected could get shot. without many people like you, there'd loads sick dying too-- orders magnitude. point inform people, providing objective data don‚Äôt people complain UK doesn‚Äôt close border like complained China? hear yourself?

Just curious.

Whitmer tried right thing. president United States shit stirred violence her. literally focus assassination plot president United States mocked encouraged passively aggressively.

The right wing radio media apparatus stirs hate continuously.

And wave away want better?

Disgusting. Truly disgusting. did. hate irrationally. Trump started shutdown travel 9 months ago viciously attacked democrats ""racism""


I wonder would half country feel need contrarian ptsd amongst medical workers must awful.  Never did. ground place  wondering since 99% Covid patients survive shouldn‚Äôt 99 photos survivors every one fatality?‚Äù Piccolo wrote.

What people downplaying virus? emphasize seriousness COVID-19, surprised state comes third confirmed cases U.S. Stupid stupid leadership states say stay home the. Blow orders ‚Äúrules thee‚Äù attitude. People say fuck it. important someone there, need you. you‚Äôre saying responsibilities leader country crisis? Fun! You‚Äôre making lot assumptions: elderly parents didn‚Äôt better age do. don‚Äôt better age. entire lifetime society borrowing future generations, particularly mine.

Would hospitals overwhelmed sooner? Maybe. goes tits 3 weeks like looks like will, seem pointless delayed collapse. Well one people bed ridden feeling like shit months. huge boats. guns. Gunboats. They've calculated many people would die get herd immunity means every person get sick (without vaccines) every person gets sick 3 million would die. 300 million USA % die covid 1% yes would 3 million. Social distancing wearing masks makes harder get herd immunity cause there's herd sitting house stuff. Herd immunity means people would interact spit breaths pretty much everyone would get sick. vaccines cut deaths obviously. good science.

crazy people figured out, fuck scientists amirite fellas? Exactly. reply poster thread, I've tried emphasize can't prove negative. we're looking bad now, certainly speculate fidelity much worse would said f*** it. that's hard hang hat on, can't prove occur. first thought well. suppose Sputnik name cultural resonance. Yes, even would recommend anyone afford get concierge pre-natal care, hospital clinics booked provide adequate care. 70% contagious lockdowns work we've seen work even old strain. literally point lockdowns anymore cannot stop strain that's even contagious (and less deadly) unless literally force people live home rest lives. sure. grandma 94. aunts uncles decided go see xmas. hope get see again.

mods, censor content dislike offends you. culling herd. Constitutionally not.

If culling herd would testing everyone euthanizing test positive.

They letting infection spread know want pretend problem. talk ""herd immunity"" clue. Tell me. I'm even working patient part. I'm paying medical claims. much mandatory overtime really believe reducing transmission 90% whether people actually scared therefore driven reduce interpersonal contacts, 10% public mask orders restaurant closures etc.

People get caught 10%. California good public compliance mask orders (in population centers, insignificant rural exceptions) ever since became statewide law, make big difference.

That's outright call mask orders me, small thing that's easy do. gag every time read people genuinely believe ""god we'd mask public WhOlE tHinG COuLd OVer."" That's good point. I'mma go take vitamins. Pandemics yes happened never businesses shut people told stay inside see family destroy millions lives shutting business shitting economy. can‚Äôt see act power control example success.

Do blame spoons making fat? What. phrase ‚Äúwearing jacket former employer ‚Äú kind reads like terminated Indeed. expected paper, things would lot worse Africa. He's sarcastic, 2 weeks stop anything. Japanese version English version article saying thing... understood correctly, Japanese version saying short-term trips Japanese nationals foreigners living Japan, policy requires quarantine 14 days government considering reject policy. wording strange translated directly English last part article Japanese basically saying even short trips allowed. recent article. Lmg coincidence fattest unhealthy country planet getting destroyed Covid. can't tho. Somehow Trump's fault.

You literally elected fat, unhealthy president. almost karmic.  everything black white you? That‚Äôs great recipe ensuring Democrats don‚Äôt anything ever. Funny .... whole lot people outside America seem okay mental exercise. Makes wonder many people scared covid get thing stuck ass removed.

My first thought ""are people really sticking fewer things asses drawn period isolation?!"" idea probably likely.  None, manslaughter schedule impact problematic seasonal games outdoors travel arrangements tied teams individual tv schedule 

Big corporations rent chalets

It‚Äôs monster machine par military operation never goal ever God, fucking stupid one time confrontation anti-masker, told them, ""I'm free wear mask choose too. Please stop trying take choice away."" lmao actually think what's plan then, wait decades first patients die see symptoms confirm/deny long term side effects?

You can't make policy based unknown long term effects. I‚Äôm starting feel now: I‚Äôd delayed inevitable sacrificing final days world resembling normal. virus edge overwhelming country, thoroughly fucked worry I‚Äôll regret wasted 2020 following rules.

It‚Äôs easy people big families happy relationships say ‚Äúit‚Äôs bad! get time family!‚Äù live alone social interaction outside house, stops?  exactly mutations present, located effect have

They compound data vaccine parts protein targets....they pretty damn good idea this, aren‚Äôt dark

Remember *variant* SARS-coV-2, new strain. Republicans covid-deniers built fantasy-land heads cling anything fits narrative. less kind social application selection bias. look around see things going well respect pandemic, apply whether actions actually made continue make difference. completely get it, think entirely understandable.

However, know legion. Would hospitals even overwhelmed, would even people dying, adopted kind reaction state above? problem kind thinking always can't prove negative. can't say would better worse adopted different behaviors didn't, never know, thankfully, would happened 100% people said f*** it. could infinitely worse right done that, like 5th level hell. again, can't prove negative.

Break come back simple science. best way combat pandemic absent full herd immunity gained vaccinations always things doing. reference ""prime"" - spared thought people like parents, 75 77 years old, worked entire lives able enjoy retirement utterly cancel everything planning last 12 months next fall? many years stretching presumably do. may never get go back things wanted pandemic hit. isolated, Christmas zoom yesterday. understand keep others safe, need do.

The science lie. thought reaching herd immunity without vaccination, meaning letting virus run profligate US population, unthinkable. death toll unimaginable. Yes, people done already done. didn't. context, become vital stop gap help keep things infinitely worse.

Keep faith. vaccine horizon, six nine months crap live with. lifetime, going wind blip you. I'm trying minimize already deal emotionally personally, conditions thing control whether make better worse. Continue opt former. think smoking shown way less negative effect covid would expect meanwhile Philippine Health Secretary see need ban UK arrivals unless local infection happens. reckon it‚Äôs valid sarcastic comment Sweden‚Äôs original failed goal. don‚Äôt 1% chance dying. small chance, maybe 0.05%? Many people around however may much higher chance, maybe 10%. you‚Äôre really saying you‚Äôre selfish exercise sunlight allows get vitamin D... patients hospital covid low amounts vitamin D. get extra vitamin cuts chance bad reaction covid get it. except vitamin deficiency, vitamin commonly included milk, factor virus hits hard. read this. Thank immune system destroy cell produces viral protein, remembers protein destroys virus gets detected future? 

I basic understanding process works, part still confuses me. 
Once immune system creates antibodies antigen supposed destroy whatever antigen's bound to, right? case, considering viral protein comes whatever cell transcribed mRNA sitting receptors surface, immune system destroy healthy cell recognizes antigen surface? don‚Äôt know majority time Yeah even admit we‚Äôre past putting aside little. 3 months ‚Äúa little‚Äù, waiting potentially year hug friend wayyy beyond people handle. 24 started likely 26 hug friend date go movie. government incompetent take care people. idiots need stop citing absolute numbers. Sweden never larger population. It‚Äôs really can‚Äôt social welfare state works well I‚Äôm Scandinavia. don‚Äôt culture right now. one determine person plane (only plane - maybe rail/bus? trip register, car)?

Maybe job? (I want punish person trying keep job feed family) plane rides trips/pleasure. (actually, guessing, days, high percentage probably not)

I seen MULTIPLE false flags duplicate names especially name common enough. (Heck, Indian friends gets detained regularly TSA, SOMEHOW, system flags saying something right (or wrong) ""names"")

That said, saying (Certainly healthcare workers. busy is)? ""appeal"" process would even KNOW classified bottom list? takes hundreds people right thing cancel one two selfish thing. fair, made right choice carry rest life. There's blood hands.

Those selfish people cause unnecessary death, decision stay home means less unnecessary death. 67% people travel Christmas said 'so what' would looking turning parking decks morgues, renting refrigerated trucks. close! Hospitals able vaccinate staff end January. Nursing homes shut doors 100% vaccinate. 6-8 weeks hell.

And know need someone's permission, see large family gathering block, rented cars driveway intergenerational aerosols flying across dinner table, completely valid shit porch. idiots killed grandma. ""I'm young healthy, I'm fine risk"" says everyone know age 70. Someone else posted something like 200k bill 800k bill (I remember honestly bill 10 grand mostly amounts thing) said since good insurance something pay 5000 pocket nothing else that. Which...I thought CARES act thing said apply reason. CARES act run though whatever they're trying now? Regarding final point. UVA, UVB UVC produced sun. atmosphere disproportionately good filtering UVB UVC, filter either.

So surface earth get mostly UVA, smaller amount UVB even smaller amount UVC. also less deadly. people stay even away people really possible unless literally lock everyone homes allow 2 houses every block outside once, course dystopian nightmare nobody would want live in. Quarantine stupid shits - real. Countries less cases less tests. it‚Äôs similar Korea. Tests lower per capita USA less cases per capita. Positivity rates low even though people tested mostly identified contacts people feel sniffles.  That's good tip! token, 1918 rate significant relative comorbidities lot less.   supposed go April obviously didn‚Äôt happen. tickets crazy cheap next April decided take $500 bet I‚Äôll able go... hope let people prove vaccine I‚Äôm part wave 1b state getting soonish. Otherwise, it‚Äôll reminder don‚Äôt gamble! year. congratulations baby. :) Every team chance win final! vast majority died 2-3. stop pretending people 2-3 co-morbidities pictures health lil bit high BP?

Well it‚Äôs though African countries would testing anywhere near rate richer countries. someone risk category, get groceries person things, appreciate responsible too. pregnant getting covid could risk baby too. open entire world 5 months later Japan less fat/unhealthy pekple. fatass major contributor dying covid. next time try put lockdown maybe put lockdown junk going mouth areas ambulances responsible 911 calls long distance transports.

Oh, forgot care people 70. know that, early indications suggesting even first shot Pfizer Moderna vaccines substantially effective AZ one. know would find really hard justify taking, essentially, 1 3 risk options get risk 1 10 1 20. People venting selfish now? agree anything requires federal rather state leadership pandemic must it. Even natural disaster act terrorism affect one area. Coordination resources information across states would enormous positive effect trajectory pandemic. Imagine federal government shared new January state governors established consistent response plan. leaving every state created disaster. vast majority die 2-3 co-morbidities. That‚Äôs REALLY unhealthy person. idea pushed bit high blood pressure makes big Covid risk flat lie.

The discussion American culture leading people they‚Äôre told. 

This person attempted say wasn‚Äôt part culture people watch Fox News are. 

This likely wrong. part American culture Americans ignore told disagree it. Obesity USA systemic, society issue. Look 90% food supermarkets, contain inordinate amount sugar, high fructose corn syrup, sodium, saturated fat, carbs general.

Additionally, become downward spiral get overweight. Depression, anxiety, pressures cause weight gain. gain weight, clothes fit, someone calls fat ass, get depressed, eat, many times even realize. Overweight people shamed instead encouraged improve image. made fun mocked. leads depression weight gain.

I always fit growing up. hit mid 30's started putting weight. Mainly started family, working eating healthy became chore due schedule. life finally relaxed bit decided focus health, dropped 80 lbs. hella tough. suffered sleep deprivation I'm single parent, trying find hour day work out, extra hour day prep food get sort instant meal. Shopping took much longer find foods proper nutritional value, visiting multiple stores get foods needed every store.

It's easy say ""don't eat junk"". agree try avoid much possible. much bigger issue that. True, I‚Äôm too. New Year interesting - people want move around year, many domestic companies given telework staff back office.

It‚Äôs going mess things hit tipping point. Yep.  talking President someone Reddit? read sudoku rather confused. number super spreader events Japan caused US military bases too.

We let fill space conspiracy theories sudoscience. No, insurance does. Sane countries provide healthcare insurance everybody. run public insurance system, others (but still offer way get private insurance).

What sane country let population go uninsured. Significantly higher percentage smokers though. hot flu viruses don‚Äôt like heat... they're probably counting cases better think every cluster Tokyo contact traced lying yourself. cases full community spread. not? Maybe significant percentage difference levels, surely vaccinating earlier saves lives, no? enough 5G towers. /s Far less 50% country meaningfully follows appropriate pandemic limiting procedures. know lot people wear masks public, social distance, still get togethers private family close friends, one wears mask. freedom?

Amazing effective European medicine killing civilians üò¢ That's true, they're probably giving 100-200 significant family gatherings. Still though, everyone works home, quarantines, gets tested, risk going far lower end risk range, may still worth least individuals.

Also weird paradox terms family gatherings - older ill relative is, gathering makes sense - knows many months left? seen half America willing give support him? President wr deserve. racist, petulant know-nothing obese fat turd While, theorethically, Swedes UK still return constitution deny entrance Swedish citizens, practically impossible since direct flights banned way someone UK could reach Sweden also closed.

So kind irrelevant not.

As arrivals ban, cannot retroactively quarantine people. garbage, brief, ad-littered source, vast vast majority reddit users speak Japanese. comes across unnecessary signal ‚Äúhey everyone look know am‚Äù clear: post saying know next vaccines lower efficacy. discussing potential policy implications **if** case. still awaiting endpoints US AZ trial J&amp;J trial. It‚Äôs actual name. It‚Äôs name calling Man I‚Äôm really never gonna get PS5 Yes... that‚Äôs repatriation means. Repatriating citizens home nation. nation must provide way citizens come home, it‚Äôs one benefits citizenship.  This. Self regulation (""Ëá™Á≤õ"") word they've throwing around lot since beginning. Events canceled government properly banned self regulation mentioned reason. Smaller private events even now. goes mask wearing mask mandates, etc.

Their government rules may less strict compared neighboring Asian countries, social regulations end result people aware others compared cultures.

Protecting family nice bonus too, course. home FaceTiming parents. travel personally. Hard though demand 80% ER patients get declined poor choices. 

I grateful healthcare workers. patients treat, even sans Covid, made poor life decisions. certainly could lose 40 pounds stop eating much dairy. Wisconsin life... True, you‚Äôre still danger infecting others go out. feel like lot us look fellow citizens (or friends/family cases) ever again. disregard life safety others really devastating witness :( God forbid care individual people anf rights, treat society like ant colony. I'm certain true. school open entire year. 100% masking, eating outdoors distances, daily self reporting keep anyone sick home. app supportive nurse/admin. Everyone must show filled app child come school. Zero transmission campus far.

It still sucks. different normal school. really scary beginning. better kids home. one person got school yet.

This magic virus. everyone wears mask, keeps windows open and/or uses air purifiers.. spread. saying normal Ohio people get vaccinated Michigan nursing homes? understand.

Seems like Ohio nursing homes worry about. Michigan get fair share vaccine enough give normal people yet.  Hypertension issue lot salt diet. bad obesity still risk factor want similar comparison two western countries similar size geographically, albeit population size, Canada total 15,000 deaths. 1/9th population.

The total amount cases recorded 540k. active cases 75k (our second wave hit us hard, worst we've ever been.) Yet, we're still shit ton better U.S., math:


U.S. population=333 million, about.

U.S. recorded cases= almost 19 million

U.S. deaths: 334k

Daily case count increase= 150k 225k per day so

Daily death toll= 3k day

VS

Canada's population=38 million so

Cases recorded= 540k~

Daily case increase= 6k 7k

Daily death toll=100 150 so

If math population scale balanced:

333 million divided 38 million= 8.76x people

340,000 divided 8.76=38 812 (I'll round 39k)

39k divided 15k=2.6x deaths, even population adjusted comparison.

For case count:

19 million cases divided 8.76= 2,168,149 (which I'll round 2,170,000) 

2,170,000 divided 540,000 = 4.

You guys still 4x cases 2.6x deaths even adjusted population.

Terrible failure government regarding pandemic.

(My data sources comparison, are: worldometer, us covid case count tracker website, ctvnews' covid cases canada tracker)

(70MM voted guy ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) Sadly, it‚Äôs simple. Covid complicating disease several factors need considered. Primarily, national health measures lower Japan‚Äôs many, many categories.  (and whole household, including kids) quarantine least seven days, bring designated placement hazmat suits. act infected get tested soon possible, five days later stay home get result. also applies came Sweden ban.

You can't deny Swedes entry country, much entry part, except banning foreigners. mean less people work leisure announced Saturday halt temporarily ban non-resident foreign nationals entering country starting Dec. 28 discovered first case new variant coronavirus may transmissible, Reuters reports . matters: new variant, found passengers arriving Britain Friday, set concern country Tokyo struggles surge cases heading New Year holidays. Fish high vitamin d, especially salmon eat lot fish usually results strongest amongst severely deficient. 

I felt way long time, LOT people deficient, especially zinc, vitamin magnesium. Like, high double digit % population.  


Another thing learned recently, surprisingly vitamin C much body use sick. RDA normal, healthy people unusual become quite deficient fighting something off. There's long history everyone unwillingly used medical test subjects, we're allocating disproportionate amount outrage towards POC specific examples thats what's limelight days. Dunno you, think losing 300,000 countrymen needlessly pretty legit thing rage about. 'Member pissed country 1/100 killed WTC?

My step-grandfather dead careless chucklefucks like these. supposed cool that? *Oh, biggie, kill family desire comfort convenience.*

Fuck *you* buddy. Fuck every irresponsible piece shit kept pandemic going long much developed world beaten it. Fuck every troglodyte ensured country 4x share death vs rest world.

IMO, anyone following guidelines jailed spot - fuck weak shit. That's people waving guns bombs public - kill nearly many tried. Let infect each-other rest us act like grown adults sense national unity.

They're public health hazard. Fuck feelings. 

But hey glad got something cry-chuckle about, ya psychopath. üëç Korea really blew it. got haughty said don‚Äôt need vaccine ‚ÄúWestern countries need more‚Äù look lol.

Gunboats really take another month second shot current available vaccines U.S. become immune harmful effects virus? Lightest shutdown paper. government can't law enforce shutdown. still trains Japan empty. Shinkansens usually full hand full passengers per car. Also mask wearing anyways normal Japan. Shaking hands also common. Wow, miss misinformation. 
And secondly already looked study. Even see info without conversions. problem lot reporting. make us ready technical documents many us want fully understand, give us info easily digestable format relevant manufactures use. It‚Äôs almost like pandemic following exponential growth curve predicted early on. mention medical bills, fate worse death uninsured... completely wasted year responsible

....did need ventilator last year?

Again, repatriation requirement that‚Äôs still international flights countries. Hey I've seen one, I've seen one, classic! No, first shot indeed given Germany today. whole stock food work entire country tries once?  No, I'm UK get bill go hospital. Hell, I've read plenty stories people deny they've got COVID they're intubated. try think fucked US is, else I'll go mad  shit. care barely breath is, walrus like. mask like death them. Wow, almost got 1 million vaccinated &lt;3 days... goes way beyond risk kids. Imagine opening schools sparked whole European second wave second lockdowns; overall cost unimaginable. may much less costly invest making virtual education effective rather itching return ""normal"" want bother finding better solutions. USA people often can't pay kinds medical bills already amulance trip - heard patients waiting ambulances 8 hours. Even best insurance plan pay 20% bill. bills rack half million that's still cost people afford. CARES act pay medical care people arent informed. many people realize they're sick get terrified asking help costs, delaying treatment. there's ICU costs 8 grand day, that's x-rays, labs, technicians, pulmonologist, respiratory therapy, cardiologist, internist, hundreds PPE, medications, oxygen etc costs get tacked on.

Also many people long term complications able take care home, even young people. may need stay nursing homes recover rehabilitate. That's cheap either. Many people able go back jobs especially job lot physical labor. Covid-19 cause deep lung scars, strokes, heart damage even young people.

I think lot homeless animals too. people may struggle much take care can't get bed, stay long term facility hospital. Possibly can't afford costs animals. job, income, barely scraping by, facing eviction.

People ran adopted animals shelters back March much many shelters ran adoptable pets. Many people also gave pets Christmas gifts, normal times there's usually surge people needing help surrenders holidays impulse gifting dogs cats. Dogs adopted adolescence shelters often need time patience, specialized behavioral training correct problems - puppies need training socialization too. shelters closed taking surrenders animals may get dumped. people go back work school may able take care pets either. Fantastic! feel optimistic day! Although get vaccine probably June July think massive improvements then!  double-check number posting. 
 
Also, quarter people travelling means *at least* half population (the quarter travelling quarter travelling to) meeting people otherwise meet. think we're agreement, looking different points view. 

I'm assuming talking one infected person, every uninfected person. 

You seem talking one infected person. 

In cases advice appropriate, discussing subject. looked chances dying covid mid 30s 4x lower dying causes age. everyone dying causes covid spent last year lives way. think that‚Äôs lot older people aren‚Äôt bothering rules. know life finite they‚Äôd rather live wait day may never come.

WHICH MEANS KILL PEOPLE TAKE LAND muh freedom... I'm one who's spreading plague around. Best president ever vaccine isn‚Äôt approved children take long time be... spent decade Japan still lot friends I'll try offer thoughts that.

Japan like many countries area tradition mask wearing prevent spreading catching disease. I've seen people wear mask day long avoid giving someone else office train cold! 

The culture Japan emphasize causing problems others, might say necessity living tightly packed circumstances. Also TB still major health issue Japan recently, friend's boomer generation father died example.

Japanese people actually critical gov't enough, yet initiative taken safety mitigation actions. 

Unlike US people traveling country forced quarantine 10-14 days. Hotel rooms set aside people way safely this. Meals supplies provided government need go period. South Korea same. 

Half America would flip shit gov't paid measures. President made public statements wearing mask way opponents dissing him. sure came suspect goes admitted desire downplay pandemic. made people even resistant take CDC advise wear masks cultural norm here. 

In US masks associated medical workers seen people ill inherent aversion thinking thinks like many. Tie macho culture reason many men see masks feminine showing weakness. Even people locally pretty good wearing masks saw without men, whole ""I ain't afraid nothin'"" mentality. 

The cultural myth rugged individualism ""I'll whatever darn well want!"" vs Japanese East Asian mythos one national family taking pride showing concern looking others like good father, mother etc respected leads different results. 

It's speculated peoples historically dependant rice farming communal nature intensive cooperation needed grow it. dirt walls around fields much one person build alone, also management water flow many fields possible. People get along work differences peacefully entire community could starve.

Glad Florida I‚Äôm free. Tbh something Americans need know, white. Black Americans unique experience native Americans double whammy experience. White, black Asian need know. Rona lot people soul searching, &amp; liking find didn‚Äôt test identify virus late spring, wasn‚Äôt 27 cases.   

There 2 ways know new virus circulating,   

1) virus accidentally released government lab, way identify 27 cases;   

2) order magnitude ‚Äúflu‚Äù cases deaths Wuhan, 10 X cases deaths ‚Äúflu‚Äù Yeah forced employees work lockdown, that's pretty fucking scummy.


Also I've heard horror stories people work companies. really get Reddit circlejerk around him, he's really better average billionaire. you‚Äôre saying don‚Äôt work america irony statement willingly sacrificed hundreds thousands lives defeat Nazis, ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù. much larger percentage population time, young people whole lives ahead them. people like act like it‚Äôs totally normal demand entire country endure equivalent unjust prison sentence save proportionally smaller number lives. moral level doesn‚Äôt make sense. stupid speed reading... read ""wasted year"". rate, yes... great news! that's achieved deaths declined massively then, would amazing. many people thread suggesting Russian vaccine cannot possibly good? current Russian government sucks, Russians stupid people...they've made incredible scientific achievements throughout history.

Sputnik V developed Gamaleya Research Institute Epidemiology Microbiology, world renowed research institute also developed successful vaccines Ebola MERS-CoV already experience making vaccines coronaviruses. Also hike top island really amazing experience. don‚Äôt first person morning you‚Äôre guaranteed walk hundreds spiderwebs. ended running screaming second half wanted finish hate spiders. I‚Äôve travelled Amazon never bombarded many spiders. Shits alot easier actual Island country one cares vaccine anymore. Everyone‚Äôs fretting mutated strain absolutely grounds concern. Everything seems normal now, even worst things Oh live island. probably already maybe catch squelch it.

What's going economy? Eventually interface rest us. higher consumption rice per capita though huge part Culture. know Nordic/Scandinavian ppl, aloofness &amp; anti-social distancing part national heritage. think bizarre Americans huge celebrations friends/coworkers/relatives every single milestone. remember client Gothenburg remarking ever recall Swede renting restaurant hall event facility anniversary birthday quince sweet 16. Yet, working Boston number invites kind gatherings monthly occurrence pre-covid times. remember someone tried closing borders called racist 4 yrs... even pandemic started everyone screamed racism even louder. Meiji reformers BTFO got passport February travel abroad work also go Japan celebrate new year, yeah COVID threw monkey wrench everything. feel you. worry though since COVID eventually. really, comment explaining big deal headline making mean, generally speaking Japan tend deaths us per capita (pre rona) maybe figured out. except dutch right [here Joe Biden calling xenophobic ‚Äúthe intercept‚Äù calling Yea, would say somewhere around point passive annual income double median annual salary. mean Shawn Michaels copypasta Wow, that's relevant discussion, thank you. Yea, think lot people rosey glasses thinking Japan. inhumane forced people hug. That‚Äôs champions Thailand dm style lockdowns concept that‚Äôs actually likee example, California, 128k 1.2 million doses given out. Hire people. Much better destroying livelihoods. Tons immigrants countries medical background would happily move US nursing job 

At point need stop blaming regular folks moving lives. Well, that's weakness person's logic anyway: auctioning early vaccines, increasing value guaranteeing payment free vaccine...and vaccine's there, COVID relief stimuluses anyway. electricians can‚Äôt work remotely. guess USA needs liberate Japan like middle east. Good thing already base there. obese diabetes makes little less twice likely die Covid. 80 makes 8 times likely die 50. Japan older population terms risk factors probably worse. would thought entire country Japan alt right!? True. consider vile makrell tomat stuff like haha Yes, important. days make significant difference, know does? Showing countries everyone situation.

By EU-wide plan richer countries like Germany show solidarity poorer EU member states. Germany wanted could bought much vaccines started vaccinating much earlier, would've expense countries like Portugal. 


And guess would've followed then? Everyone scrambling get hands vaccines fast possible? Think would've crippled killed citizens.

&amp;#x200B;

So yes, european unity important means save lives, sacrifice That's righty move I've seen Jurassic park Lol, don‚Äôt know difference updating vs. appending? Sure don‚Äôt. haven‚Äôt changed narrative all, whatever. non-Japanese citizens/residents allowed entry unless applied business exemptions begin with. change much new restrictions, merely eliminate non-critical travel select countries previously exempt. Major respect Japan. Fight hard, stay strong. leave house essential reason, I'm capable transmitting virus? wanna guilt trip you, that's sure. completely understand loneliness. feel deeply, sometimes feel going insane.

I'm old lady, cool one! ever wanna chat, I'm open it. Sometimes kvetching stranger really make one feel better things. Look way, could ventilator. saved yourself. That's see it. I've already isolating experiences life, part new. Nope, tan shockingly well skin tone (even tanned looks pale everyone else here!) Ok- paid $10 antibody test mask go (good mask seal) negative COVID test plus wash hands, can‚Äôt miraculously develop COVID spread. all, applaud safety. celebrate christmas. there's like gazllion people china Well they‚Äôre referencing abc report guess should‚Äôve found original source. Japan actually done little. Schools open, restaurants open. US seen far stringent restrictions. mask usage places like Bay Area nearly 100%, strictest restrictions country, still facing major outbreak.

I think really hard compare countries like this. seems possible -- stress possible, good evidence one way, -- populations East Asia greater existing immunity, probably T-cell-mediated related coronaviruses, exists North America, South America Europe.

Countries like Argentina universal, mandated mask-wearing, extreme lockdown measures, massive outbreaks.

Somehow Japan done little, nearly effected nations.

Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia limited spread. fan East Asia, South Asia, Middle East, outbreak becomes severe.

Given horseshoe bats natural reservoir viruses, endemic region, given evidence immune responses Covid-unexposed individuals, think pretty likely least part we're seeing differences existing immunity among different populations. Oh really? think vitamin tested zinc magnesium fine. case magnesium somewhat miracle diet really contain any... 
 
I ask check vitamin next analysis also really diet major way (yay ulcerative colitis)
 
 
However refer vitamin uptake, mean uptake food capacity synthesise using sunlight? Wait, vaccine already going free? tax people already help pay healthcare low income people? one listening anymore. People stopped social distancing stores, traffic quite back March levels it‚Äôs increased significantly stores aren‚Äôt adhering 20% capacity. police refuse enforce anything. example, there‚Äôs technically 10pm curfew don‚Äôt know anyone hassled it. unfortunately people minds bc they‚Äôre still alive there‚Äôs also survivors bias think won‚Äôt get it. know people bubble ventured can‚Äôt even stop anyone house feels hopeless. left house ten times doctors visits. live people haven‚Äôt. Everyone risk contagion there‚Äôs signs government willing anything stricter bc they‚Äôre afraid backlash. minute started walking back restrictions bc anti mask protests lost plot. discounted NYs initial surge, discount FL/TXs initial surge also apples apples comparison.

Face it, say Florida ""almost bad"" meant say ""despite real restrictions florida similar places like LA hellscape restrictions, means restrictions matter much besides ruining livelihoods"" really wonder people refuse participate bull market year ""principles"" would rather let savings rot 0% interest savings account. think they're taking moral high ground?

Most us financial responsibility make much money families, includes taking advantage bull market. interesting blend modern traditional (temples everywhere deep rooted fascination worship technology robotics). East West (lets go watch baseball game eat hotdog, japanese thing believe due american influences). healthy unhealthy (they live 500 everyone smokes drinks like fucking competition).

All tacked onto one cleanest places polite friendly people. happening across world COVID first started. understand people flying home.

Not everyone option drive. live major city good public transit (i.e. DC, NYC, etc.) may even car. mean like 500 years ago Look! walking Trump talking point = Yeah, risk par flu happen high risk groups vaccinated, people go back things normally. that‚Äôs stop spread virus, check everyone coming quarantine first testing. Us done first lockdown useless common sense island clearly isn‚Äôt common. That's country cares country. Us americans never know feeling. NOlympics. ""We're closing gets sick""

""But travelers ones get us si-""

""*No!*"" Smart. countries everyone else gets shit together.  takes two weeks get virus, yet people cant manage day mask wearing, social distancing, gullible misinformation covid. still dealing world wide, force people bring covid seas.

That make people take covid test, airport entry. positive:  go home problem though consider big wealth gap is.

On global scale, debt name $10 pocket, statistically top 10% wealthiest people planet. 

By logic used well, situation call credit card company tell put $10 someone else's credit card debt, *even though less minimum payment, $10 literally vanish even lower debt*, literally bad billionaire. usually considered good form indicate edit comment actually notate that. saying. Otherwise people might get impression dick. see sensitive spot lol understand size, haven‚Äôt heard classified city. feasible. Operationally, utterly ridiculous suggestion salty pushing Thank much! must missed this. suspect many less-than-authentic proofs vaccination used. wow, headline makes sound like big deal, really dramatic article making be. work transportation, since \~March job track restrictions like this, likelihood, American, seen work tried travel past six months.

Japan basically locked countries world since edict even got announced. notice basically mean select countries allowed entry also restricted. Japan nationals, special residents, spouse/children nationals residents still allowed entry, business travel still allowed. Non-critical/repatriation travel low since March; closing borders really going change much.

TLDR: Yes, new strain virus scary; no, Japan drastic headlines making sound

LMFAO true greater good

The greater good. I‚Äôm thoroughly disgusted people. haven‚Äôt seen family since March. I‚Äôve kept kids home school despite wanting go back person learning. rarely go out. get perishables supermarket assholes don‚Äôt care. Man don‚Äôt know roaring twenties soon enough, hope. Dude, *no way* 3%-5% population tens thousands disposable dollars pay vaccine get 5 months anyways. 

Making $400,000 year gets top 1%. represents doctors, lawyers good firms, solid finance jobs. aren‚Äôt people pay $25,000 vaccine. You‚Äôre looking top .1%  literally dramas concierge medicine. Let's post story so? closed borders everyone, specific countries. true, blatant disregard suicides caused economic hardship, increase substance abuse depression due government measures, effect 'remote education' young children, woeful lack consideration personal freedoms forgiven forgotten many people. Japan Korea citizens willing put piece fabric face try protect eachother, instead ""Me freedoms pissed getting haircut."" Sounds like trump plan Sounds like trump plan Sounds like trump plan get ? made mistakes looking options Lol Hard disagree. people parties parties regardless. regional variance compliance huge within LA County. upper middle class Asian neighborhood, single party since March people wear masks take trash single family home driveways.

In another predominantly Hispanic suburb even 20 minutes away, friend says there's still least one party week, usually tons people sometimes including band two. $10 unrelated insurance. administrative fee sorts. test free. Covid testing vs antibody testing. covid tests free antibody ones not. also much higher USA fifty years ago Mmmm nope. hate all. Occasionally even people love act like dicks. hard concept you? better ship bloody car close borders global problem. world probably decades recovering loss. We'll probably see overall decline health outcomes life expectancy unless figure ways get people access care even without staff. discovered September aware transmissible. 

And take long find out? UK government make priority? Goddamn it, right sumo coming new year.

Hope Kakuryu gets retire tournament cancelation Germany work then?

Also, Australia average 9 million annual visitors. US 70 million. Based population, Australia significantly visits per capita  Also 70% Australia lives major cities population isn‚Äôt remote isolated (63% America)

Also tourism travel shut year, dont know geographical location means much America people seem ok schools closing forever, one cares, it‚Äôs sad. Listing study mean evaluated U.S. Federal Government. 
 
Linking American governmental website hosting result give automatic validity. 
 
Also comfortable ignoring criticism Russian doctors scientists poor trial data politicization Sputnik vaccine. 
 
The Sputnik vaccine could work fine, still valid criticism. people know shut fuck swear I'll concede exaggerated, vitamin supplements definitely uncommon. Add tran mackerel tomato, cover lot people. Exactly feasible. open let nature thing. take long find out? People West blaming Chinese government delay couple days confirming human-to-human transmission. also apply standard here, we? well said happened before, yes knew They're also less obese. Covid really affects affluent, affects moreso people already systemic inflammation things like western diet / obesity, lack exercise, lack sunshine, depression isolation, stress overworked.  OP pretty easy Google that. two articles useful. First one recent suggests smoking worse you, links couple articles suggest could good (the reason link refute argument, rather show indeed, people making argument).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ""Stepped help China"" pffhaha Honestly trying downplay mental health struggles all. 

But unfortunately virus here, something give. wish could ways, since can‚Äôt, feel staying home stop spread important mental health toll

It‚Äôs easy thing say chose, don‚Äôt see alternative.

Hopefully end near vaccine rolls out. driver's ed pitched wear seat belts protect others. Drivers ejected moving car threat others. guess UV, could go higher, like x-rays, gamma rays. go body. Talk people tragedy Benghazi 9/11 while. 

Ask personal sacrifices would make prevent another Don‚Äôt worry, things likely start returning normal next spring, next summer probably completely normal. Masks never part New Zealand's response mask mandate issued recently public transport 1 city (Auckland) precaution. walked dog Christmas eve man sitting back patio said hi us. saw husbands Saints hat &amp; loves Saints. 20 ish ft apart &amp; masks on. visited good 30 min. Said lives alone staying home since March. Asked walk see truck knock &amp; say hello (at safe distance course). People lonely. Whoever said might actually close mentally ill detached society don‚Äôt understand basic human nature

Saying something like horrible people‚Äôs mental health. deal w bc know it‚Äôs horseshit imagine someone read didn‚Äôt sincerely hope shit pants public. believe admitted said wear masks afraid general population would buy PPE healthcare workers able to. asking government, then, invoke national emergency act start mobilizing economy make PPE government distribute; government said like 15 cases zero soon. gone spring sun.

When gone spring, said people injecting bleach. Lung scarring (which COVID causes) go away. Ever. seems people get protection 10 days first shot Pfizer's vaccine. would expect least proportional US, also population denser?(citation needed) id expect easier. Average redditor *Ieyaesu left chat* Except you‚Äôre wrong. I‚Äôm solution. solution needs come top, may late that. another type UV light kills virus damage human skin eyes. 

It's called Far-UVC light 222‚Äânm. can't penetrate skin eyes much still kill virus. still rare expensive, could widely US like: OPEN COUNTRY

STOP CLOSED  mom died. dad insanely lonely asked come see him. isolated, traveled see him, didn‚Äôt see anyone else him, plan quarantine get home. piece shit? Every time see US death per capita rate, feel need point Europe bad worse US. say done better, like we're worst far. pointless, school closures harm. new variant contagious, contained. isn't, matter. problem! think that's happen regardless whatever governments decide. Even empathetic reached breaking point. Americans dumbest breed humans. goal never infection levels get 0. lost credibility (if any) past days continued goal post moving. Embarrassing. Knowing Japans history seems like really big deal them. wanna see really crazy results? add ivermectin. researchers, NIH/CDC, especially doctors prescribing it, costing peoples lives ignore many emerging studies. Herer condensed list:  Yes way less younger population. Yeah people like plain better. We've followed pandemic guidelines 100% time. Malta Luxemburg might first given population less half million. milestone look forward to. Yea that's racist all. Except every single expert said two months full mask compliance would wipe shit Herd immunity emergent phenomenon complex system. *destination* arrival time plotted map. completely irrelevant, talking about.

They provided data, West analyse it. Like expect Western vaccines.

We exactly reason trust Russia. work followed enforced. Unfortunately majority Americans acting like children saying dOnT wAnNa LoCkDoWn!!!123

Have heard New Zealand? Stict measures lockdown AWESOME. wow look that, economy recovering wonderfully. I'm sick close minded, immature adults trying spread opinion following countries experiencing second waves worse first wave: Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland Hungary. people countries decide time stop following measures? Strange. worries thanks.  Same... i‚Äôm slowly losing mind. It‚Äôs hard see world ever return way used be. makes fucking sad. need hang hope. Haha need put every small business business right 

We don't. choice government made. Paying businesses close would easy realistic high asymptotic rate

Asymptomatic covid common people thought first. people test positive symptoms pre-symptomatic: systematic reviews included studies sufficient time exclude pre-symptomatic infection estimated proportion SARS-CoV-2 infections remain completely free symptoms 20% (95% CI 17‚Äì25%)7 17% (95% CI 14‚Äì20%). NBA proved teams get corona move everything okay.

They dedicated medical staff give best treatment available end day deaths seem immunocompromised people US it‚Äôs high.

As said, large population US. can't protect vulnerable people unless slow community spread. There's way protect vulnerable everyone else goes life normal.

Also, take immunocompromised need hospitalization, biggest issue need make sure overload hospital infrastructure. overloaded places, done nothing, hospitals would overrun people able recover would died able get treatment. told stay inside isolate

We aren't. anti-lockdown people seem say told stay inside. state America made mandate says people can't go outside. encouraged go outside. states limit crowd size numbers, maybe can't giant bbq park, still go walk friends outdoors. able entire time. know that. someone household must going get groceries without interrogated stepped front door point. 

The time told actually isolate covid, exposure covid, waiting test results public health advertised?

Maybe paying attention? 

Check ad council CDC see entire covid-19 response: http://coronavirus.adcouncilkit.org/

That national campaign. Depending live, almost certainly local campaigns. [New York City put good public health info aspects health Covid: work community mental health center. state local government put covid mandates place use mental health reason. Curiously, also support community mental health efforts. funding cut. Forgive take seriously certain politicians pretend care mental health convenient opened largely summertime okay.

Because could lot things outdoors. outdoors makes circumstances completely different. can‚Äôt celebrate thanksgiving go anywhere Black Friday? dine restaurants shop Walmart can‚Äôt see family Christmas?

Well one stopping anything. Besides, go restaurants, lockdown. original question need shut down, appears shut down. places shut anyway. Maybe restrictions many people indoors, that's country. California New York stricter right now

And one told can't celebrate Thanksgiving see family Christmas. lot people found ways things also safe, plenty people things without safe anyway, one stopped anything. Public health officials local governments asked people travel see people gather indoors people outside household want stop community spread. one told can't celebrate Thanksgiving.

And black friday happen usual. [Online sales people go also don‚Äôt understand get COVID shut entire business

No? run business employee get sick, yeah, guess would shutdown can't work sick, that's covid thing. That's sick thing. owner business get sick, there's reason employees can't keep working. worked went school flu someone looked deathly ill coughing sneezing whole nine yards

And have. People stay home they're sick. mean shut flu. means go infect people sick. evaluating information critical thinking comes handy skill. Anyone paying attention knew bogus said. simple asking medical professionals wear masks job effective? answer always been. I've read well like said stories US. surely conditions would want receive help? brainwashed Covid anything else? Geographically yes, treated island sense. one forcing go donation center donate blood. feel fulfill requirements feel comfortable enough it, donate. don‚Äôt, stay home. Stop discouraging people great cause people driving roads creates traffic. traffic makes dangerous drive. added danger increases number fatal accidents. 


Driving: shameful way use freedoms. Alm6like know wtf agree parent comment. spent 5 days Tokyo 2 Kansai area (Kyoto, Osaka, Nara) wish done opposite. Tokyo great found craving natural beauty Kansai region offers. best ratio neumology units world helps lot (mainly) respiratory diseases extended culture using mask engaging physical contact. ""single topic"" defines country getting good bad numbers. Look sub you‚Äôre on...   Im going bet performance/hireability going judged ability start Zoom session not... That‚Äôs fine what‚Äôs choose. can‚Äôt tell people handle mental issues. fine didn‚Äôt want travel good you. end rope decided day two family difference life death you, good you. Chinese celebrate Christmas, lot them. official holiday Christmas still celebrated people. However chinese, understand celebrate holiday that's got nothing us slightest. Chances would me. Statistically I‚Äôm likely get hit bus shot medical occurrence. 

I could also ended meeting love life. Hey I've seen one Don‚Äôt rely heavily imports exports? mom really like Tokyo. biggest things Mt. Fuji shopping. even really anything wanted show daughters (American born). best cultural stuff Kyoto. Osaka best food stunning aquarium. Nara deer, maple leaves lot temples. also went Kanazawa gorgeous gardens castle. really depends interested suppose two weeks would probably spend least week Kyoto/Osaka/Nara/Kobe area base Kyoto. might take couple days Kanazawa end Tokyo. fly KIX NRT save bullet train ticket. Kind related, tattoo artists well. Spouse artist shops open booming area, high risk complications he's home since March. might time start looking graphic design jobs (which probably long shot anyways since ""formal"" experience field still incredibly talented), unless get lucky break, really hard sell prints. started fine artist landed tattooing try make people want buy ""art"" art unless famous and/or dead. Japanese much different attitude towards civic duty Americans do. attitude come problems sure, sure pull together crisis. Smart. Maybe there‚Äôs 1% chance it. Fine. 6mil people traveled, that‚Äôs 60k people thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm probably good‚Äù spread it. People die result. 

I chose travel don‚Äôt don‚Äôt want kill others. people seem feel differently sad is.  Hopefully released sooner rather later. Shogunate 2.0 lets go Damn, doubt things get better April. Made trip plans back Jan end april. Reddit amazes me. 

When another country it, great idea. US it, president gets called every bad name dictionary. Wait set goals knew achieve? feel like can't keep been. I'm slowly dying inside house. premie baby January one met. work home graduate teaching assistant. classes, classes teach, grading, taking care almost one year old husband works (he whole pandemic essential employee) feel like going crack. lost hope ever returning normal again. miss people. support new mom. hope left. wife visited Japan March U.S. mom met us Philippines I'm sure exactly closed tourists? Shameful. I'm talking countries like France, italy etc travel bans placed UK earlier week honestly late stop spread new covid variant

That's black-and-white thinking. one traveller slips quarantine grows exponentially factor 2 every week, 4000 infections 12 weeks.

If happens 50 travellers, makes 200,000 infections 12 weeks.

I guess makes difference? remember. liberal hypocrites Yeah interpretation comment, criticism referring to. criticize purely basis Russian without additional effort point, personally believe unconstructive lower level discussion. 

Back least reasonable argument looked like discussion might actually hold weight sounds lovely all, need real, human contact. Phone calls texts don‚Äôt time, know?

Also, checked profile: you‚Äôre old nice tits Hey, appreciate every one join wearing masks, social distancing staying hell home. know seem like much, every little bit helps. part solution. right thing. thousands frontline people hospitals need every little bit help give, means staying home safe. awful, yeah. pretty common. tran, cover vit month two. mackerel stuff REALLY supplement suppose uncommon elsewhere covers deficiency... kinda counts? are. That's point. Obviously, people need leave house essential reasons. try limit visits possible. understand that's always case. really help mitigate spread virus, especially since many confirmed cases spread grocery stores. want help community, ask people get trips possible. think they've started yet. least LA. need administer vaccines medical setting, least EMT administer epinephrine quickly. reactions rare serious. Like vietnam korea olympics? Absolutely not. 

Vaccinations need start leg distribution chain ready. need get synchronised 700M people. could understand preference high-prevalence areas proportional delivery according age distribution. chance catching one way WORTH risk. Geez really feel like need explain one. full block (""You cannot go back circumstances"") definitely hard block (one cannot simply buy ticket go back normal flight). occasional repatriated flights (with added package quarantine testing).

Not best solution, perhaps one enough compromise. countries done year ago 3 months far information vaccines incredibly positive, I'm sure referring there. NZ we'll open borders we're good ready. approach afforded us freedom live ""normal"" lives consequently economy bounced back vengeance.

Plus we've nuanced approach occasional border incursions, less emphasis hard lockdowns detective work like contact tracing, genome sequencing. need stupidity vaccine. Better what? Obviously different situation, culture, etc, US Citizen lives full time EU Romanian wife daughter in, guessed it, Romania.

All way back March first wave major lockdowns effect across Europe froced go back States handle critical paperwork. 

Both US EU barred travel other, US citizen able drive across Europe (through Hungary, Austria, Germany, Netherlands (for like 100meters lol) Belgium, France, finally UK). original plan fly flight got cancelled &amp; choice. Like said, US citizen, show passport two cases show flight itinerary &amp; able cross restricted borders. 

And someone jumps throat, taken COVID seriously since first started hearing production shut downs China. I've always taken care get spread virus, self quarantined States arrived. 

#This relevant part.

Coming back bit challenge, issue- bit explaining crossed Eurotunnel France. 

Nevertheless, resident permit Romania, able fly EU without issue. English simply verified residence passport bingo. 

I drove Eurotunnel rode train Channel France told fuck LOL.

After apologizing putting akward situation explained two month old daughter Romania desperately needed get back (I acknowledge bit cheap truth!) well wife, work home. guards discussed briefly sent way Belgium. smooth sailing got Romanian border crossing waited cool 14 hours line car cross (along thousands Romanians trying get home anything got worse)

Once Romania ordered mandatory 2 week quarantine hotel supervised military police. passport vehicle documents confiscated spot put convoy cars escorted city lived several police cars. 

At end quarantine period, documents returned, thanked cooperation sent way family. 

All all, bad experience.. two weeks alone isolation good soul gave time make proper plan start business (which well underway now) different circumstances, probably would roadtrip lifetime, fact hotels stay (all closed obvious reasons) super time crunch flight cancelled 2 days set leave ~30 hour drive home Heathrow, never really chance enjoy it. trip back different reasons- jet lag 40 hours car meant 40 hour drives hell pair..  situation made roadtrip lifetime, something I've always wanted do, grueling affair.

Hopefully settles I'll able take family similar adventure better circumstances comfortable car! 


TL;DR
I'm 'Murican living Romania residence permit. able travel (relatively) freely countries first lockdowns. would imagine Japan would similar exceptions. Super Nintendo Land...  actual mutation different strain? seems low. Canada country ordered vaccines looking per capita basis? getting those? Again, data doesn‚Äôt support hypothesis Thanksgiving spark national surge. forgetting tentacle porn. Tons tons hell kind maniac still Halloween candy left time year? Y‚Äôall got super self control what? moving nyc fulfilling dream best friends post college. move moms basement probably won‚Äôt happen least another half year cause jobs.

Covid might ruin much makes nyc special decade til recovers. 

I think lot people medians 1.5-2 years 22-24 would fucking pissed break couldn‚Äôt move work city dreams. I‚Äôm isolating people think I‚Äôm selfish sad full shit Wait what? wash rice? nobody ever says anything comments reddit, saying anything value. get downvotes every then, definitely seeing side argument. sanity, hope go date hug friend turn 26. risk would die either occurrence nearly nill. go fucking rave smart it. EMT here:

1a. People call 911 sorts reasons, good portion don‚Äôt really need immediate medical care, insist do. can‚Äôt refuse cases, could huge liability issue condition deteriorates end ill dead. patient isn‚Äôt sure ambulance, advise patient get hospital call 911 later condition worsens. 

But patients every right deny care us, sign forms saying acting medical advice. 

1b. normal EMT like me, much. priority really keeping patient stable get hospital. Paramedics administer certain medications start IV‚Äôs. clinically manage issues like pain, seizures, agitation, etc.


2. It‚Äôs triage based, ER staff rate condition prioritize beds based that. Ambulances don‚Äôt get seen faster, despite many people think. air movement outside wanna risk getting potentially life long debilitating disease guest. pre election shenanigans much delay packages, mostly crippled mail effort stop mail ballots--it poor masking social distancing led latest USPS backlog Christmas boxes huge fraction staff covid quarantined due positive exposure. said surprised DeJoy behind bad covid policy led this.

India always pursued foreign policy non-alignment. biggest trading partner US also recently BECA, Signifying increase military cooperation. also held joint drills US, Japan Australia. US-India ties would probably much closer US cooperating much Pakistan past. fact India buys Russian arms means want become dependent one country/system tries pragmatic.

Modis comments Putin reflect sympathy like-minded strongmen, Trump. mean India somewhat pressured praising Russia. That's husband, family friends for. help hard times. lack support around well, time look elsewhere. need look forward better things. Things improve soon. Hang there. got started prophylactic!  several studies shown E Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean Vietnamese) genetic resistance Covid, resistance traced back tens thousands years.

The alternative explanation racist ignorant ‚Äúclean compliant asian‚Äù see repeated board. someone lived Vietnam Japan, idea two wildly different countries able get results based purely cultural ability crazy.

Lol ok Chris Farley Ok I‚Äôm replying FUCK. expert cited article literally said two days ago beat virus vaccinating mainly risk people course trashcan article decides include Keep America! like working home. Pfizer set deliver 255,000 doses year. Moderna, whose vaccine approved Health Canada Wednesday, committed delivering 168,000 month. 10pm curfew talking about, welded home like China. I'd rather Australia, fwiw. Cue people whose pack-a-day grandparents lived past 100. peru it, makes two interesting well thought-out! effects Telecommunications Act '96,

can ELI5 law bad rock? Actually seems like there's lot side effects new mRNA vaccines, undergone proper testing like normal vaccines would rushed testing process, despite entirely new technology vaccine. Several places halting vaccine campaigns it.  New Zealand significantly visitors per capita America (9 mil yearly 26 mil population vs 70 mil yearly 330 mil pop), 96% American transmission community meaning doesn‚Äôt come non residents, tourism larger portion GDP countries. ""Health experts worry public could balk offered shot that's moderately effective.""

I think health experts conserve energy focus area expertise worry much illogical irrational direction public going react, possibilities endless. Stupidity bottomless pit. alternatives, public likely end taking available, even public cannot muster sufficient patience compensate lack vaccine (of level efficacy) proper distancing, masking hygiene.... 

You one two alternatives: let immune system make nice novel virus training wheels inside syringe, wait (not if, when) live virus catches you. Period. God full lol Maybe started April, don‚Äôt remember. border closed year Telling counties take precautions intention enforcing consequences making sure follow through, getting record warned them. comes patients turned away die hospitals near counties overwhelmed, governor throw hands say ""It's fault, warned blew off"". ones ""worth salt"" - ACA sets pocket maximums law. $8k individual $17k family plans.

Which still fly. I'm cautious, talk anyone (don't need thanks bluetooth headphones), follow protocols. even take mask eat plane. continue fly say no.

HOWEVER, correct. **If banned travel maybe would get results achieve.**

I mean, one could get planes allowed right? shut travel month maybe would slow spread virus. INSTEAD, want shut small businesses restaurants created outdoor dining areas? WTF?

Close airlines, end constant corporate-cock-sucking fest, maybe something smart US Govt? HAH, long shot. That's said. say people free make decisions response ""that's works.""

Let us in!  Look filthy gaijin done! found September

by November 25% cases London.. 

and **not** Los Angeles now?

&amp;#x200B;

extremely first detected September***. November around quarter cases London new variant. reached nearly two-thirds cases mid-December. Lol true america Oooh us üá≥üá¥ change would work heartless would switch around: take proceeds doses auctioned put towards buying doses vaccine making free poorer people.

Do that, everything wins: people paying give semblance reward it: donated much money go getting vaccine people need it, reward getting vaccine first- helping people can't pay eventually get easier.

Heck, even get double whammy ""first adopter technology curse"": right, possible later doses vaccine paid able different strains added (like flu shot multiple strains think break year it.) Many people venturing grocery stores non-essential reasons. know. work essential sector. Obviously, people need eat. ill people out. see people time making multiple trips per week sake it. include many people street wearing masks. Yet, people judge choose fly. blatant hypocrisy. fact, many documented cases spread grocery stores, putting others risk. Here's one example: Psychologically learn stuff certain ‚Äùcritical periods‚Äù It‚Äôs philosophical, right return bedrock principal international cooperation.

I meant I'm getting philosophical say yes, bedrock principal, countries bound international cooperation; required cooperate. sovereign. They're *supposed* kill torture citizens either they're really inclined so, well there's nothing stopping someone else decides come make stop.

They said always gonna factor, one/the biggest one entire territory 426 square miles. city Los Angeles, including surrounding cities counties, 469 square miles. find that? Looking best option Canada tracking They've saying ICUs 0% capacity 2 weeks. makes sense compare countries like Japan South Korea pretty much countries US countries taken active measures prevent spread covid US done nothing stop spread. 

Yes, lockdown stay home orders curfews cities US President actively opposing preventative measures months police sheriffs announcing enforce measures, US could pretty much done almost nothing. Shut still got first one yet I'm high risk group. spouse. America, remember happened last time japan closed borders? Im going ask hold one China literally injected million people vaccine trials completed, didn‚Äôt see anyone concerned that. Europe much better, much fatter are. children vaccine won‚Äôt ready end next year, it‚Äôs obviously cards return normal. disease really deadly children result primary focus vaccinating teachers etc. widespread vaccine end Q1 next year they‚Äôll able get then

All tho like user said really need step back look expectations fr understand going americans minds.

I understood since early year. significant portion population legitimately lost reality. Either reality wrong one.

That's me, numbers people insane legitimately ask I'm crazy one... Literally everyone knows this. Every single time someone posts words ""death"" ""coronavirus"" 20 words other, someone talks this. literally not, go off. Easy close borders country literal fucking archipelago. 

Same NZ. Taiwan. Korea peninsula. 

I thought countries figured secret keeping cases reopening. thought it. Turns geography keeping others out.

So next time one countries shame another country (like mine, US) able keep cases people dying, point fact we‚Äôre bunch islands. Hell, Hawaii cases down. 

Idk I‚Äôm sick ‚ÄúAmeRiCanS sTuPid CaNt fOLLow siMpLe MasK diReCtiOns111!1!1!‚Äù

Easy say. don‚Äôt live here. Also, idk US you‚Äôre talking about. Literally everyone wearing mask go out. one dining outdoors. numbers may bump little like flu season nothing significantly enough warrant type closures business limits. It‚Äôs virus, happen. Unless healthcare system threatened, public normal threshold tolerate sickness one year post vaccine/community spread likely slow virus enough hit threshold. dunno, blame falls almost entirely China. lit house fire slow put out, going blamed, fucking person started all?

I'm saying countries criticized handled this, ones started stop love wild meat, ones blame most. learn SARS change now. genetic composition almost universally East Asian. Show place (anywhere world) similar enough genetics high death tolls. exist. Fair enough. think people get big Africa is, long takes cross country let alone continent. time, countries zero near zero testing average citizen. Fuck off. Yikes.

Even then, global scale, that's moot. 

The wealth level globally high person who's situation potentially masses drag rich people streets beat death, rich global scale they, themselves, need dragged streets beaten death. Yeah fair enough Funny drink beers together every weekend. zoom sick seeing family members get sick dying. think takes two weeks get virus. 

People still need work, go shops. shutdown, transmission still occurs. 

In Melbourne, Australia took us months harsh lockdown since July, managed hit 0 community transmission 2 weeks end October. 

The idea 2 weeks takes kill covid seems kind silly me. world always need move on. transmission move on. Much longer term solutions required ""two weeks get virus"" Spoken someone appears unaware NY's rising death rate. Maybe got placebo? Jk jk flew home see parents year. honestly feel bit bad haven‚Äôt seen since March. got tested twice isolated home prior still bit nervous flying risk. two younger brothers still live parents hang friends frequently frankly see myself, lives alone works home relatively small risk introduced back household. I‚Äôd feel terrible decided visit got sick, feels like lose lose scenario. Depends live. fiance work events nearly entire company leaving California work Florida. we're bunch queers trans women. Yeah generally no-no point overweight unhealthy preventable, tbe virus care that. Eating right foods regular exercise works wonders immune system resilience illness Guess what, summer right places, there's massive spike latin america so? making observation/suggestion China likely violated human rights development testing vaccine?

This government harvests organs unwilling donors massive scale, welded people homes enforce quarantine. smart. stop starts shown best course action squashing microscopic invader. Yes U.K. South Africa didn‚Äôt know they‚Äôre looking stuck out. strain becomes prevalent quite quickly noticeable. MIchigan enforced followed. health department fines you, shutters business, state licensing board takes licensing (liquor, operating, lotto). hospitalization numbers fall gets warmer, spike restrictions go back place. current extent, will. closed borders border china, virus deaths would prevented. Throw Fauci blame. means half (or less) logistical capability, financial resources, qualified medical professionals LA County well, right? Yeah, really need manage expectations little better homie. US unfortunately natural immunity capital world, get us heard immunity faster. doubt 'theyre Japanese they're safe' issue? know Canada refuse entry Canadians that's law  days ago read Muslims spent entire month Ramadan 2 Eids lock downs /quarantine. hear complaining defying orders. outrage missing holidays.

I heard religions complaining either. guess matter, right? 

I seen parents since February. outside wearing masks keeping distance. would love visit more, can't risk it. 

It infuriates many people flippant this. Every one thinks exception catch /spread it... do.

The vaccine distribution also shit show. rate I'll lucky get end next year I'm lowest priority. Bull fucking shit understand threat time. gonna say posts Reddit CCP actively trying silence dissent/reveals virus, smoking something else. okay block report dangerous, stupid people.  fits dictionary description. use terror (drone strikes invasions) change ideology area never invited you. feel wrong. announced world police. bomb places indiscriminately killed HUNDREDS THOUSANDS civilians. 

So.... Yeah. 


Objectively terrorist organization. 

Americans leg stand arguing this. stop invading places willy nilly bombing hell countries stop terrorists created first place. 


America PERFECT embodiment ""One man's terrorist another man's freedom fighter."" except people consider freedom fighters already LIVE THERE. 


Terrorist organization. End argument. number studies show masks ineffective non clinical setting years. recently popped suggesting limit viral load receive thus lessen infection. date however science considered inconclusive various studies showing conflicting outcomes yet explanation why. message governments ""wear mask well helps helps doesn't, well much lose"". fair enough really. general rule accepted masks block much water vapour breathe cough - also make throat lips go dry awhile wearing them. However virus water droplets l- viral particles rater like firing sand grains sieve... make won't. answer you‚Äôre looking called ¬´¬†masks¬†¬ª. Japanese didn‚Äôt argue masks efficient not, already knew answer, since that‚Äôs they‚Äôre wearing flu anyway. Also, physical contact. don‚Äôt kiss shake hands greet people. Case points : time we‚Äôve got spikes people didn‚Äôt wear masks talking close others closed spaces like bars host clubs. 2M people vaccinated 0 deaths minor serious cases mostly treated seems.

2M people infected Covid would probably almost 10k deaths lot people hospitalized serious lasting side effects.


How hell anti-vaxxers understand this? blizzard thing many even high risk category. User name checks out! Cases rise thanksgiving higher rate thanksgiving, US, average. vaccinate fast Pfizer, Moderna, Astrazeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson produce. literally province-wide lockdown today. want? Total fckng ignorant. state make law assume federal law. that‚Äôs completely unrealistic even much many us wish wasn‚Äôt. vaccinate 100m people flu three months every year we‚Äôre global pandemic every country competing vaccines they‚Äôre scarce Except are. 

Mandates restrictions laws. They‚Äôre enforced, reality~nobody really follows them. government responds public demand, public demand extraordinarily come spring early summer. city already blatantly said base restrictions solely hospitalizations. numbers plummet, zero incentive ignore public demand. Consider Vietnam, population 95 million total 35 Covid-19 deaths far. Children vaccinated huge impact across board. vast numbers people send kids back vaccine means fewer people workforce, fewer people take infections happen (due chose simply vaccinated). lot teachers return either vaccine. actually know 2 HCW inner circle quit jobs 3rd fighting keep anti-vax. except Dutch presumably. remotely purely political, anecdote life on-topic expect vaccine availability toddler? 1/10th vaccinations .....

We don‚Äôt 200k vaccinated Canadians. something like 1/50th US response retarded. late literally opposite done. 'early' stopping flights joke. enforced tiny handful airports took temp. That's it. plan. screaming stop flights *before* CNY 2019. People talking virus long public figures making statements, least US.  year official outbreak date China allows inspectors look origins!? bit late. I'm pretty convinced Beijing going sure China alone fighting virus allowing CNY 2019 travel. *best* ineptitude corruption Wuhan blame. China refuses accept role global spread SARS-CoV-2, deceived/coerced blamed numerous countries origin virus criticize *anything*. apparently many people important visit familes christmas still alive next christmas. proper shutdown safety citizens,

including parental leave optimistic next person won‚Äôt even supply 3-4 million per day least 3rd vaccine approved. know possible mention US discussion even US? know possible hate Trump's actions criticise China?

I honestly get people like keep bringing US every discussion another country's failures/hypocrisy handling virus. Haha funny number. That‚Äôs cause Austin isn‚Äôt really big city comparison. Yes. Kinda is. fits dictionary description. use terror (drone strikes invasions) change ideology area never invited you. feel wrong. announced world police. bomb places indiscriminately killed HUNDREDS THOUSANDS civilians. 

So.... Yeah. 


Objectively terrorist organization. Every sentence wrong. 

But anyone disagreeing gets comment removed topic.

This weird. Day late, dollar short. variant already spreading control SoCal. I'm sure attitude viewpoints, friends fine seen ten months. Wtf talking about?! Flu virus? fuck been?! cause problems them

 agree this.  Kudos Slovakia beginning already today. NL waiting 8th January infrastructure ready. two weeks, get impatient getting this! isn‚Äôt goal herd immunity February? Cmon. Let‚Äôs this. military wasn‚Äôt busy. think people expecting go away end spring, children vaccinated, majority naysayers vaccine seen enough long term data sway opinions ones need manage expectations. shall see. care that's sad truth. people top care staying top.

That's today. seems bear statement regarding mandates needed going forward. This. GF kids tough enough. completely alone must torture. stated, mandates change fast, look see long term effects are. People may distance homes friend groups, much mandated distancing still occur going forward.

Sorry, false imo. mandates anything happening based rare long term effects. mandates dropped end spring that‚Äôs pretty widely agreed upon here. again, trying manage expectations. one going distance wear masks another year. It‚Äôs like pulling teeth now, there‚Äôs zero chance. love life ok video chats phone calls wearing mask. That's feel it.

Because mine, multiple, different, statistics, supports argument.

What want look at? New infections per capita? Total infections per capita? Pick one best fits narrative go together good starting point, again, supports theory major European countries (in example, since actually click read it, Belgium Spain) poorly, worse, US. true. ban re-entry.

Demonstrably false, since debate centered around keeping retail open sake economy. money people fuck everyone else, usual. crazy people twist assholes come comments like this, people upvote it.

What‚Äôs even infuriating one dads friends died (American) CJD years ago - got eating untested veal. sick year. could donated blood right diagnosis 3 days died. Correct, theory still supported using infections per capita, also using positive test rate, along tests/capita. single number tells us everything need know, obviously. start, infections per capita expect much mandates place distancing masking

Yes, risk rules might change point long Zairyu card good go. really look forward day ‚Äòhealth experts‚Äô go back hole came from. get really annoying while. think need repeat thing 1million times day?

That's bigger issue. even ""give away last 10 dollars require aid another person"", ""if give away last 10 dollars pay little another person's debt, would literally erasing 10 dollars existence."" minimum due met, they'd still penalties it. interest even paid, they'd get 10 dollars swallowed owe more.

Trump got 69 million votes 2016 (2.5 million fewer Clinton) population US around 323 million. Even accounting can‚Äôt vote due age, it‚Äôs far short half people actually live here. 

The US voter turnout problem, basically. 60% eligible voters voted 2016, versus projected turnout 66% 2020 (the highest turnout since 1900, actually!). 

So really it‚Äôs like 30% eligible voters voted him. Slightly voted Clinton 2016. Electoral College essentially makes actual votes matter less geographic distribution, leads sorts unmandated election victories. Every country get set percentage based population, country get higher amount doses time per current scheme. many experts sub filling actual experts us. Let‚Äôs hope read reddit! America's gonna show gun boats again... That's mortality though, many people *who get it* die. country higher mortality, significantly lower infection rates, arguably handling pandemic well preventing infection first place.

Thanks! try. tried since live Florida everything open months...it seems one following rules lol. reported numbers vaccinated 1m people 3 days (one Christmas). It‚Äôs picking up, could easily reach 1m day mid January point no-return rest world refused wear masks kept partying despite WHO‚Äôs warning think better target areas, areas re-open fully. would make much sense. saying.

Yeah that's true, demographic smokers skews older would make difference. people depts owed to, richest rich. need money. What's stopping canceling dept? felt sick shot one time True. let's say vaccines bring us herd immunity.

Here's achieve:

1. significant proportion population immune, least protected worst symptoms. means impact hospitals, etc., much less. 
2. sterilising immunity exists, and/or milder infections mean less virus less time, actual reproduction number lower, meaning Covid outbreak grow slowly brought control less intrusive measures.

Together, two factors mean that, long borders closed (or least managed) possible pursue elimination strategies local level. comment replied literally said ‚Äúyou enjoy Japan baby‚Äù. interesting little action covid opposed sars 2003 thankfully needed significantly contact. Unfortunately, may why.   surge hospitalizations number shown hospitals started previously unheard process turning people away would admitted normal times. Due lack capacity. God knows current ""hospitalizations + turned away"" total is, I'm convinced would reveal massive post Thanksgiving surge. LMAO blame Trump country's fault. People want someone blame. can‚Äôt fix stupid. Yes is. type benefits advantages.  sanity sense security, isnt hospital system works. major accident, go trauma center go trauma bay. initial stabilization sometimes emergency surgery (but thats usually people basically dead) eventually go ICU stable state. arent staking covid patients trauma bay.

In Melbourne seeing 700+ cases per day took 4 months serious lockdown contain it.

The rest world isn‚Äôt NZ levels transmission now, far beyond Melbourne levels 700 per day... NZ length lockdowns won‚Äôt enough. need lockdown harshly NZ Melbourne did, long Melbourne least.  20 years ago think California ban. 2004 2007 bans started. several states still pretty minimal rules. Rightly so. would let country annexed rape corona? Go japan preserve culture too. Good luck 15 year old Reddit  refused outright much deprioritized Governments world asking people avoid travel holidays. worked country? Chinese government learn experience travel warnings Thanksgiving Christmas, stop fooling thinking people voluntarily stay home holidays. No, done things roughly equal terms US. start rereading third paragraph, includes small fraction ways Russia neighbors contributed space travel. say ""first closed cycle engine"", instance, mean say Russian Ukrainian research propulsion one main reasons space travel today. Also consider achievements happened Sputnik, among first Lunar landing, first space station, things already mentioned conveniently ignore.

The postal code system know first used Ukranian SSR. G-force suits Soviet development. GLONASS, used alongside GPS companies Garmin, developed Russia. Gridfins, notably used SpaceX, created USSR, along pressure suits. Numerous elements culture currently active West well - examples include Tetris game *Among Us*, based Mafia.

The USSR course country operations done negligently often sake money - type country factory would receive 40m prefab incinerator pipe use, someone somewhere signed paper, placed bunch prebuilts, got income. However, detract achievements.

The fact view sort cultural competition troubling.  BioNTech vaccine Germany approved Isreal. scrutiny need? 

And would German vaccine manufacturer care domestic US racism? People seek social validation bad choices. good provide that. problematic people using ""mental health"" fig leaf cover fact they're entitled selfish. Responsible people find safe outlets, like meeting parts, Zoom calls, talking therapist, dozens ways take responsibility mental health instead using excuse. western country done long time, would worldwide outrage.

Canada's borders closed since March well.

Okay? 

Also google unless deep dive find, don‚Äôt see anything suggests hospitals practiced all. Many asymptomatic though, might people vaccinated already Covid know it. Probably like way business 'Black Friday'. keep eye news, get consumed low likelihood possibilities allergic response. else fails, mentioned conventional vaccine options. We're going old ground I'm stepping away reddit think we're done here. good one. anybody good articles sources statistics behind expect x amount people get vaccinated? Like, get 2% vulnerable population vaccinated, expect y% reduction hospitalizations z% reduction deaths. I'd super interested seeing modeling. There's pros cons collectivist vs individualistic societies. think saying good idea. gives impression individualistic societies can't make intelligent decisions protect others. entire west part individualistic societies definition. Despite that, many EU countries trouble wearing masks. nothing collectivism vs individualism I‚Äôd liked see reaction certain US president shut borders Maybe unvaccinated get actual disease we‚Äôll hit way current metro area population Tokyo 2020 37,393,000. worried. dense/populated metro area world. Really nice see this, can't wait see number go higher. Wish country also bet Pfizer Moderna. Tbh one factor may lack testing. Japan criticized serious under-testing CARES act joke. I've suffering covid 6 months lot things bot covered physical speech therapy.  Apparently even mandatory social distancing. Whatever else they're doing, working well. mandates merit. merited, there. people. lots places follow simply choice simply cannot afford fined. Around here, hit $7500 violating even mundane mandates. (Even feel written COVID 19 preparedness plan posted high traffic area worth $7500 fine, especially business minimal employees.

Read damn thread. people Japan killed since started died virus. So, no, otherwise healthy population isolation important mental health toll.

To whatever degree masking social distancing helps isolation touch, community destruction income, arts, small businesses society prove far worse long term. 

Then factor alcohol, sugar intake, bad foods WAY consumption, things directly cause death destruction virus itself, realize mental health toll overall ALREADY significantly worse virus even extreme risk bracket 96% survival rate. case wasn‚Äôt totally irrelevant person said ‚Äúi envious first world countries basic human rights competent government‚Äù, overly positive view added negative one counter that. Yes, it‚Äôs much unlogical leap reason all. mindset comment accuse something series, let provide mine: 

Your post evidence stupid unlogical person, stupid people stupid things. case, probably killed someone stupidity. 

Same degree leap theory. lol stuck visiting Japan baby young. comment also mean could go baby older. It‚Äôs funny pictures people getting shot taken shot administered, though photo minutes afterwards would less impactful. No, photo needle action! Aka numbers could skyrocket weeks That's true. Fewer flights, borders definitely closed. Thry could easily blocked tourists agree that. I'm saying blocking lorries strain virus already spread continent known governments since early September ridiculous. 50% population vaccinated, including vulnerable, things different.

Wonder pizza, mcnuggets tbell quesadillas. Everyone Wuhan also wore masks. Right beginning whole mess. help slightest? building new hospitals overnight heavens sake... Yep! CDC statisticians believe every 1 confirmed case 7 additional unconfirmed cases. Approximately 1/3 US, well 100M, covid19. perfectly understandable effect earlier school closures, less immunity built group. provide evidence school children driving infection (many asymptomatic).

The happened Sweden, high schools universities remained closed May June. result, age group overrepresented beginning autumn, slide back average weeks later.

Changing strategy opening closing different parts society drives infection new groups previously less exposure. entirely counterproductive. Thats worst part. worked bother again. Jesus.

Mainstream media want talk though. confirm. already deal depression, complex PTSD, anxiety, pandemic brought worst it. Along adding all-out panic attacks thought I‚Äôd fortunate enough put behind me. intense state anxiety feels impossible maintain yet it‚Äôs constant since start this. Thought I‚Äôd break good many times. It‚Äôs funny UK doesn‚Äôt require masks schools students (only select ages select areas required this) stated condition teachers prioritized vaccine - worst part even system fundamentally year proven system fixed EASILY QUICKLY. Seriously, pandemic, lockdown hurt things, responses shown everyone firsthand: everyone USA decided general strike say ""we're working give us [x]"", matter people ask for, matter pie sky cockamamie seems, country cave within problem- even fundamental issues are, there's large amount people country sides political spectrum totally driven nothing sheer hatred ""other"" they'd RATHER system remain broken sheer spite, they'll gladly trade happiness ""other""'s misery honestly, seeing miserable makes happier happiness ever could.

Literally result fundamental issues. idea point actually making, saying equivalent to:

""

...when B, C,and inevitable results come A. Good luck getting Japanese understand ‚Äúwhere change baby‚Äôs diaper‚Äù.

Thailand whatever takes. noticed more. understand people don‚Äôt trust doctors US. 

He trustworthy must think says manipulation rather facts, mask thing. follow advice think would know physician masks help prevent respiratory viruses. shouldn‚Äôt said don‚Äôt need let health service get them. 

Rock hard place guess, wouldn‚Äôt lied doctor. going couple vaccines choose from, e.g. Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, etc.. Perhaps slow pace little bit determine whether different people taking particular vaccine.  Exactly, except public mask mandates, likely federal incentives maintain those. hospitalizations rise due regular flu season returning, restrictions. Completely realistic exactly told. Works well sarcasm stupidity. usually attributed ‚Äònew‚Äô strain graph, seen before, 10% positives Wales attributed new strain. 

Can point graph mean? believe data discern different strains. Immunity great white blood cells keep genetic memory stuff get. next time get body much prepared. Likely nearly deadly point. give dose. People interact covid patients daily getting doses. administration getting it? even risk? They‚Äôre working home... seen shit lifetime. wait 2 weeks vaccinating. love country looooot people Southern California. takes one small segment population flaunt rules what's currently happening

You say Texas Florida also large populations. Yet, never saw 'it's bad apples' given them. well this, masks social distancing job reduce transmission several orders magnitude, surely bad apples infect bad apples effectively? workplace straight ignored variety covid restrictions. know get away it, theres reason follow rules unfortunately. need find it, actual recent study showing attached comorbidities COVID19 deaths smokers high population. Incredibly surprising. standard practice everywhere ever lived. many staff sick teach, close schools, nearly every year prevent people entering hospitals (which businesses) unless sick needed facility. big news accepted practice. Google large health systems area last years likely find limit visitors flu surges. absolutely morally wrong. Especially anyone who‚Äôs already familiar Japan‚Äôs treatment foreigners (asians particular). birth rate extremely low Japan? imagine probably also factors in.

Also, advantages Japan mask culture, lose extreme population density. It‚Äôs half common people Japan aren‚Äôt anti intellectual anti science default, asked something, went beyond, US, things Govt asked absolute max people do, usually way less. delay bad.

If you‚Äôre dire need receiving antibody results go quest labcorp think provide 24-48 hours you‚Äôve taken Yea, third country never wore masks followed Trump‚Äôs example. pacing vaccination exponential, days behind schedule make things look lot worse really are.  need start filming people dying?‚Äù

There single major nation world recognize America state. I'm continuing conversation someone who's busy licking boot country 

I literally said think America shit country, guess reading comprehension poor that. unknown (since stuff out), level richest rich people, ""spend money make money"" method big point, taking large amounts debt exchange trying grow riches common way help build wealth. afford that? Regardless numbers kept climbing higher higher many experts screaming drastic action kept failing act touting ""everything table"" hesitate hesitated. lot anti vaxxers stupid people it. never know capable of. like keep explaining, normal run mill viruses force closures every year, go away one them? makes medical/scientific sense start defying best practices situation caused first place worsened. ü•≤ resident? [citation needed] America - better veiled marketed imperialism!

I'm kind flippant here. good question. explanation, says:

""Data treated caution. particular, small numbers positives detected Wales, Northern Ireland Scotland leading considerable uncertainty surrounding estimates. uncertainties given cases positive ORF1ab N-genes new variant.""

So, could due small number input data cases. London much larger population, cases, data likely less noisy. no, you‚Äôre thinking swordplay. referring lead singer Journey. India says non alignment, they've historically allied Russia since independence. India fortunately moved closer US time got link Dr. Fauci saying that? Reipdeer Japan better think expediting Pfizer approval going blasted hurt you? mayors health bureaucrats trying micromanage everyone excuse inability anything. anyway, panic everyone potentially overwhelmed hospitals, where's money 5000 page ""relief bill"" mass training ICU nurses even build public healthcare capacity? bullshit 

People West simply refuse hold leaders responsible kind failure much easier turn finger neighbor. Americans, even liberals left-wing types, see people fight governments disruptive. Anyone heard Antifa lately? Americans dying starving, one lifts finger because...politicians morally bankrupt help say mean things Twitter/Reddit them? pathetic.

That said, successful COVID response far based honor system. People love talk NZ Australia, happy stay home, governments enact strict lockdowns rules suggest stay home without pay 4 weeks? mean, that's important, people goodness their, right? No. Also, disease worse older people Africa's life expectancy exactly great. makes zero sense all. Like actually zero. Medically scientifically, zero sense. 

There never another spike one experiencing now. Covid virus. virus, run mill, average, predictable virus. Like keep trying explain you, virus endemic: that‚Äôs it. closures, limits, masks. It‚Äôs another virus circulation like we‚Äôve living thousands years. Definitely type things I'm talking about. Maybe occasional limited 25-50% limitation numbers people large venues hard hit areas. exactly told expect areas start improve drop there, pop somewhere else. literally I've saying since start, reason, received ""We lockdown forever."" long shot said meant. Although factual still find odd places around world honest numbers. Two examples India China.. trying throw shade two countries 1.4 billion people numbers getting them. also dense areas even countries. 

They countries questioning continent Africa too. Tanzania, country 60 million, reported anything long time. Max cases overall 509 according worldometers 21 deaths. See untrue sounds. look stats use density, urbanization, look budgets aid get factors like landlocked, airports flight transportation, famine poverty see talking about. 

The USA needs better deserve criticism, said, need look hell happening places fixated USA. Omg, give already. 'under police protection'. smell something fishy right here. stan Loona want see real rushing, come Ireland receive vaccine today starting 4th remember reading Japan government lax olympics, nice turned around. trend cases meaningfully change Thanksgiving, hospitalizations actually started decrease much country, offset incredible rise California. clear Thanksgiving trend data. also declining population negligible immigration, makes addressing housing issues little easier. human nature, lot people look excuse celebrate. People know contagious dangerous covid way back January, human nature view lockdown inconvenience daily lives. Hence, people trying get town lockdown. 

But December, everybody aware contagious dangerous covid is. folks fleeing London far irresponsible fleeing Wuhan, deserved condemned selfishness. would lot backlash, eyes partisan people Trump would seen right thing US like New Zealand kept virus raged Europe. wish could :( 

So many people work home management board. It‚Äôs disgraceful. Yep know-it-all step brother would never wear seat belt. couple years ago went window car passenger flipped across highway. RIP many. care started

What? What?! you? speak governments citizens world? think nobody cares started? think *want* keep pandemics like future, prevent it, KNOW root cause? 

It's simple fucking around wild animals no. people world love shit thinking makes peepee big. governments intervene shit, keep pandemics. year 2030, scientists finally find trace origin virus, Wuhan. think you‚Äôd surprised number boomers wear them. 

I grew belief car went nowhere without everyone belted in, seatbelts. 

BTW, boomers are, point, 57 older. We‚Äôre idiots. don‚Äôt claim anyone younger is. everyone shopped 2 weeks supermarkets run supplies pretty sharpish. Lol okay dude. I'm saying reason distrust government. stupid distrust government? Frankly, none makes sense. vaccinate elderly first. DeSantis right once. Jeff bezos dept to?  cautions everything schools childcare centers closed, children would become one primary sources transmission. Give single example anything even remotely sensible mask wearing people opposed Trump. Japan try like nothing stop entering warp pipe Super Nintendo land! Placing every single concern vaccine umbrella ‚Äúanti-vaxxer‚Äù must make dismissing easy. 

Im sure square something like Tuskegee Study joke b/c rehab expensive part. Uninsured cost $895 per session, 3 times week. could mandatory quarantines military bases could enforced. still probably wouldn‚Äôt prevented deaths, it‚Äôs one many things could let us handle better. Ultimately humanity standoff other. Debt can't cancelled everyone's debt everyone else, one person's magnanimous enough cancel debt, they're sacrificing money case another person they're debt calls debt in...but likewise, one's willing call debt know call debt force paid, everyone else call debt force pay it.

Somehow, incredible amount debt puts us stasis. Germany lifted restrictions summer. late summer R slightly 1 already. cases already climbing again. people never tightened measures got seasonal. 

But yeah point stupid. Croatia tourist country one without restrictions summer europe. idiot holidays year another country idiot bring covid them. Likely COVID spikes limits many things, trivial average person. Courthouses likely move back Zoom hearings week two. Schools closed week two deep cleaning contingency online plan. might able visit nursing home except plexiglass window weeks. distancing. still restrictions. going big deal, like stated beginning. Global wealth $399.2 trillion. dept $188 keep making false claims without sources. see reason continue discussion you. Well, okay. guess agree disagree end. Thanks providing reasoning ostensibly murderer way stupid. 

PS - it‚Äôs ‚Äúillogical‚Äù argument you‚Äôre alleging made supposed fit stupidity... quite ironic point you, friend üòÇ countries done *to China* one year ago recall everyone thj time called ""racist"" excess 1.75 million people every country planet dead. would true beheading, vaccine shot. Lucky """". 

Like ""lucky"". OP literally ***is Chinese***, correcting knew somebody China.

Peak reddit. That's awful. I'm almost grateful Wisconsin now. ER completely empty went. Literally see single patient. due gross negligence like hosting big kegger pandemic. want blood much pay it. Everyone involved blood gets paid yet say selfish, cuckold. Anyways tried donate second time year get antibody tests never appointments. Waste time. cultural, stupidity lack understanding science. Eh mean even Fauci expects herd immunity end spring might talking adult population w/e. that‚Äôs type restriction you‚Äôre actually talking shit guess agree Absolutely. believe current plan people get vaccine even covid. hear France telling people becomes much widely available, covid, get vaccine.

The overwhelming majority hospitalizations ICU patients 70+ years old. population get vaccinated, hospitalizations dissipate quite rapidly. Dougie calling federal testing going get lot heated kinda question methodology. wife PA brother doctor, they've gotten first dose. sister law social worker close interaction kids, court system, every single day, even first group. I'm lawyer, I'm part group 1C. gone court since March, gone office long. somehow, I'll getting vaccine sister law. Presumably want court systems back running, really important social workers spreading around? They're court too.

Makes think really important ones first -- front line healthcare workers like wife brother -- essential workers part lottery system something, rather putting social workers get lawyers vaccinated first without regard much time they're actually interacting people public. know handful lawyers still going person anything. hope 'culture' mask-wearing sticks around Coronapocalypse.  anyone looked New Zealand versus rest world? mean, seriously.. first world port nation. mean look nuance instead declarative. Look size nation resource allocation, culture..

Did anyone else that, single one perfectly understandable effect earlier school closures, less immunity built group.

That's totally implausible. Estimates perhaps 10% UK population might seropositive. So, effect immunity infections remains minor. think discussion herd immunity already repeated number time, main argument still this: infection fatality rate 1% immunity threshold perhaps 80%, would involve death 0,7 % UK population, 470,000 people. cases per day never high never allowed get high.

The vaccine available general distribution another 4-7 months. told that? Yeah telling dad this. thought 20-30m got flu shot That‚Äôs precisely point. They‚Äôve denying re-entry residents, they‚Äôre foreigners. much doubt Canada would ever that, wouldn‚Äôt get away it. really don‚Äôt get people don‚Äôt lol

My Facebook people actually like  kids? parents refer kids baby even they‚Äôre old. There's lower likelihood getting hurt covid, getting hurt vaccine point according studies. think pass. Right you‚Äôre also arguing anecdotally could say fines live. quick google search tells aren‚Äôt lot states issue fines penalties all. 

But know else awful small business? Limits capacity. that‚Äôs tangible trajectory. Everything else unknown. hope stay safe, also think plan projections way overshot. numbers support herd immunity without children's vaccine. one then, herd immunity via vaccination possibility. I've stated beginning, restrictions nothing like spring really impact daily life all. herd immunity, mandates. feel yet. neither help make rules. Restrictions already common years flu season, depending area. every three years around hospitals visitors policy height flu season. That's restriction, targetted form enforced distancing. That's type thing I'm talking about.  Yeah Lithuania exact thing enforced special workers police caught breaking quarantine way get fine 500‚Ç¨ 4000‚Ç¨ Umm, really: Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) recommends yearly flu (influenza) vaccine children 6 months older ‚Äî United States ideally end October. Life never go back normal, let government 'experts' take control lives much longer.

There's reason say 'new normal' 

If expect government drop restrictions give us lives back, naive . number basic parameters wrong, hence wrong conclusions. IFR *on average* closer 0.3-0.5%, school children 0.003%. long kept locked up, may reach level immunity *within group* thwarts infection spread.

Lighter social distancing basic hygiene measures decrease reproductive number thus HIT significantly. 70% measures taken everyone meets everyone.

Protecting vulnerable infection higher degree low chance become sick allows asymmetric community immunity, HIT achieved significantly fewer casualties. Attempts protect non-vulnerable groups far failed caused many deaths. 

The flu mutates much faster coronaviruses, evading immunity previous exposure, hence yearly vaccinations. viruses mutate become contagious less virulent. happened coronaviruses, happen SARS-CoV-2 well.

All all, closing schools useless pandemic measure irresponsible regard well-being children. unscientific, populistic, outright dumb. age make impending purchases lifetime subscriptions office 365 Microsoft gamepass even sus. Nobody said that, fact almost entire world closed borders US. joke Hey guys Dr. Bonnie said relax I'm going disregard new covid strain üòÖü§£ Fat smoker - common. 

Fat gamer - common. 

Fat American - extra common. selfish parents kid!!! One also see people staying home like oneself. Perception skewed people break bubble. Health agencies make ads show empty streets houses city walls turn glass andn see people inside, talking companion, phoning friends, reading cooking, way taking care society world staying home. know even feels way, form love? taking care protecting life others do. Maybe somebody support way, leker. wait 'til catch country month... variety vectors use. weakened virus first concept ever used vaccination- Edward Jenner essentially identified cowpox (a mild disease, equivalent cold) possible way get immunity smallpox. problem weakened virus vector a. compared modern methods yield great results, still possibility infection- likely harm vaccinated person all, could still spread whatever disease virus- hopefully need explain would bad idea right now. 

Oxford/AZ J&amp;J's candidates use Adenovirus vector (I think virus normally spreads Chimpanzees both). like using weakened virus, A. tweak virons' protein capsules maximize immune response- chance infection transmission dramatically reduced, point could vaccinate humans earth expect none become infectious vaccine itself. concept weakened virus, different protein capsule making effectively harmless. put covid's genetic information, body rest.

Moderna Pfizer's now-approved candidates use genetic information SARS-CoV-2 none proteins actually allow genetic information enter cells make start producing virions. Thus, method also makes vaccination effectively harmless. immune system uses genetic information produce antibodies, far, looks like works great effect. 

My essential point there's really nothing tricksy going vaccines- process OP described, tweaked safety efficacy. They're basically weakened forms virus body uses ensure real virus can't get in. Ho ho ho Three years ago, got hard core, closure superintendent. close. ran teachers, subs, bus drivers. finally closed state told enough staffers legally manage number students. make 9 days end school year enough kids came school due illness make up. put mildly, district parents bit pissed. write like 8th grade student failed English class. Everyone potential disease spreading factor. Therefore, *need* travel justify potential spread disease. People traveling unnecessarily spreading disease unnecessarily therefore harm society.

Think risk resource, like beds hospital. ok use bed hospital actually sick. show want ""prove"" ICU empty, anti mask, that's ok. increasingly, there's call deny critical covid care covid deniers.

It mean go hospital know careful not. mean there's group people think deserve get care, rationed, chose make situation worse first place. Rush would never make load horse shit! free travel well want. one asked stay home months end keep safe. friend: I'm sure interpreted wrong. Also, percentage people (which think high percentage) wear mask properly, even know how. Taking mask eat drink talk, wearing nose pretty much wearing mask all. think mask thing ultimately work US, need education buy-in. works well countries used masks. Ehhh, wouldn‚Äôt hoping festivals summer yet. Idiotic overreaction country still believes they'd host thousands TOURISTS Olympics... True, Sanders bros idiots. silly gives anti media anti lockdown crowd ammo. People realize implications sensationalized headlines lead people think. say natural immunity much death that, spend year saying vaccine vaccine vaccine people start hope snatch say actually vaccine either, people honestly supposed think? 

How pandemic end? ridiculous herd immunity end pandemic one way another like almost every pandemic history two questions when, primarily natural immunity vaccine immunity. Sorry sounds stupid main worry going outside get sun, might contract corona someone get struck hard since I'm likely low vit ( sun skin months. Since March, I've like 3-4 times)

I also heard people darker skin need get around 45 min 1 hr sun daily would complicate things. mean, would certainly look suspicious someone sees dude standing walking around spot hour Good know. many do. small decisions add up. actions futile. Flattening curve keeps patients like dad alive. I‚Äôd family.

I'd everyone's family well, whether anti-maskers, anti-vaccine, whatever. may prejudiced beliefs, may never persuaded take side, collective efforts would show difference make fight pandemic.

Hopefully make trying times. Yup it‚Äôs foreigners spreading virus. Japanese immune clean. much want contain virus understanding real deadly cost absurd. absolutely ignored corona meaningful threat human health. Thank balancing discussion. Understandable nice day Japan cool see guys come shell sometimes. like seeing turtles trying get beach. Pacific salmon almost pink colour I've heard, red stuff think salmon literally called Atlantic Salmon Totally agree, people seek other, religion gatekeeper benefits wealth leader. Masks protect wearer too. sufficient community transmission April 1 justify wearing masks. many cases could prevented people wearing cloth masks early on? NZ variant around quite while, travel U.K. interrupted recently. place looking variant likely find it. much paradox. countries much better health care USA, focus prevention. Japan Lot health policies aimed catching treating chronic illnesses early stages. [How Covid-19 vaccines could rapidly reduce UK‚Äôs death would imagine numbers quite close US. difference staying home 24/7 reducing travel pleasure. people use travel monthly pleasure reducing maybe every 6 months so. even smallest mitigation scorn it‚Äôs perfect (stay inside 100%), it‚Äôs useless.

I wfh‚Äôed 2 weeks curbside take groceries. husband works start small social network decided go office unmasked. coworkers take Covid seriously. mitigated exposure (didn‚Äôt go large cubicle farm), yet people tearing apart r/thebachelor didn‚Äôt quarantine perfectly. Sorry, that‚Äôs could do. knew risks. possible legal US That‚Äôs wrong conclusion make graph still. much evidence countries small enough case numbers actually track every case virus [clearly shows schools transmission Here's rational way discuss it: difference sterilizing immunity, body eliminates virus quickly can't replicate spread further, simply enough immunity prevent getting symptomatic. Last checked, jury still whether natural immunity vaccine immunity enough reach sterilizing immunity. know natural immunity varies individual wanes time, there's good way tell whether particular immune system wipe virus quickly enough prevent asymptomatic carrier, even prevent full reinfection.  
So looks likely natural immunity, variable is, opens real possibility still asymptomatic carrier.  worried long term effects vaccine know years.  happened vaccines say worries unfounded.

This argument still good enough IMO, one less rediculous ones I've heard. 

I'm still going get vaccine second available me. exact kind restriction speaking since beginning. areas hard hit enough see steps, would likely include limiting large venues couple week masking. big deal numbers drop quickly. sustained spread therefore sustained measures way now. common 30's 40's require ventilation. better outcomes. agree typical flu encounter require long term hospitalization, said much last comment. fully manageable. manage something using tools disposal. Like masks distancing hard hit areas relieve hospital strain. Except coming love, hateful nationalism. fewer Fucking ZERO? joking? first got two weeks flatten curve save hospitals, we‚Äôve moved goalposts much want us house arrest ZERO CASES? 

Good know life 22 years old. Good fucking god. absolute trash opinion. It‚Äôs clear don‚Äôt work healthcare, we‚Äôre glad work alongside you. eat eggs veg/vegan diet Europe much beautiful. Save money instead. see infection numbers plummet starting Feb too. With, said, deaths dropping like stone March. check blood long time sorta allowed go rn provide links articles? we'd done well had, there'd approximately 8,000 dead Americans instead 338,000. 

Our leadership hasn‚Äôt consistently made poor decisions, they‚Äôve intentionally made ***wrong*** decisions, siding profits personal, selfish needs instead collective welfare broader population. 

As result, people aren‚Äôt taking seriously need to; rigor masking, social distancing sterilization/cleansing fallen back ‚Äúwhen doesn‚Äôt inconvenience ME‚Äù, believe it‚Äôs annoyance, haven‚Äôt sick yet, never get sick, ignorance actual science disproving myths. 

The ripple effect people see others allowed stores without masks, walking around public without respecting social distancing, start too. 

It‚Äôs multiplicative, like growth new infections fatalities US. They‚Äôre directly correlated. 

This virus going away, spreading faster 6 months ago, another strain even virulent previous strains. 

I don‚Äôt know get ignorant people refusing follow rules benefit all. 

The impart rules laws preventing spread virus, people push back it. must *consequences* violating laws health safety others. Australia, New Zealand, South Korea it. too. Ah fudge. goes uni plans. well probably got hole one I'd argue number I've seen personally high think. that‚Äôs believe completely fine Whenever CCP announces number add extra 0 end you‚Äôll get real number. Baaaaaaa baaaaaa big problem blight shared everybody,

&amp;#x200B;

if disease consequences Ebola, bet people would fear much nobody would even invite neighbours Thanks. 

I heard criteria, seconds, let ask another mind asking.


So go supermarket 10s maybe hundred people building. never stop seconds grab item move on.

If maskless, ""exposure""? employees, spending hours there, exposed?


(fyi, stores community require masks and, finally, seems everyone complying - like spring) Yep. lot replies incentives. negative positive. plane 29 passengers London landed Stockholm today.

Up passengers want test Yea anti vaxxers believe right decide one gets vaccinated. Luckily people NL wants vaccine. Yup - I‚Äôve removed many acquaintances colleagues Facebook.

The decade plus adding old festival music person order improve reach really biting ass days... always spot idiot tendency make assumptions without sufficient data. Cool, acknowledge least 10 articles buried *among literally thousands news stories.* seen 4 articles. Imagine *this* snotty lazy google yourself.

You made specific claim particularly asinine way. asked back up. Imagine ignorant think burden proof someone *else* prove *your own* claim... Yep. common knowledge now. Wait Fauci say 90%? Last read 70%. clickbait article may thinking said said 90 reality read direct quote ""I say 90%"". He's always stuck 70%. Figure 5 shows since mid December, children people age bracket 2 - 24 years 2% rate positive tests. Older people 2 %. Y-axis percentage positive tests.

Children usually get tested less frequently, absolute numbers need corrected that. thought literally established earlier year warm weather doesn‚Äôt slow covid? support Japan closing borders. Mexico closed borders obviously everyone still come visit

On plus side, tourism affected horribly

On negative side, makes covid cases increase much force close everything we're number 4 country covid deaths

So seems acted like economy important people we're losing people hundreds thousands economy still going down

So yeah nice Japan closing borders even tourism important too. They're taking care citizens unlike us bad don‚Äôt wash hands using restroom get vulnerable 10% vaccinated, we'll see huge reduction hospitalizations month later, huge drop deaths.  makes sense. edited comment added see fact correct, lots western michigan articles school closures pre covid flu. Seems shocking remember highschool PA flu stomach bug would rip right let pandemics run course millions people died. get wrong, governments handled special sense idiocy (Except NZ co). completely agree you. get special prize censoring existence late though, especially country origin laid groundwork birth virus via lack enforcement wet market laws. one stating obvious dont want labeled racist. However even racist say group people less prone corona? changing definition? realize vaccinated catching virus effectively similar effect immune system?

So 70% get vaccinated 70% catch virus, theory thing happens. 70% population effectively fight virus. Thus ""heard immunity"" achieved. 

So no, change definition. simply stating 70%+ needs able fight infection order reach heard immunity. That's common flu kill close half million people US year, population virus system either contact vaccine. Humans tribal animals, exception away people stay mentally healthy. parents seen kids/grandkids daily 43 years. healthy them, give huge props good isolating themselves, they're absolute limit now. kind of. one pretty bad situation someone left quarantine positive ended causing breakout going July 4th barbecue Okinawa, weekend governor actually encouraged people mainland come too, really difficult say worse. 

As soon realized happened got locked tight month, base liberty contained. Even still aren‚Äôt allowed eat base indoors (even though Japanese can) mainly don‚Äôt want give media excuse blame us. media ABSOLUTELY looks excuses blame us. 

As example biased Japanese media was, couple weeks 0 base cases, media started reporting ‚ÄúUS military cases: 1,000; New Japanese cases: 50‚Äù time. Notice catch? used overall number next daily number make us look worse. Need take news stories huge grain salt.

Look plague went waves Europe. never hit herd immunity.  alternate universe, Hillary Clinton lost re-election horrific mismanagement pandemic, 20,000 Americans died. lie. said 20 million. lied keep lying.

Remember said masks useless back February? Either they're stupid deliberately lying. expect, honesty valued Americans. Lying over-promising is. Shit country full shit people. Russians trust vaccin. pushed way quickly. 

I believe probably safe likely works. what's point Russian citizens trust take it? Knock knock.

Its United States.

""Open country.""

""Stop... closed"" I've ""heard"" immunity before, get Covid?

Kidding aside, math:

(%Vaccinated+%Infected) = 1-(1/R0)

Hopefully %vaccinated much higher %infected. government churned vaccine 10 months technology that‚Äôs very, new takes 10-15 years perfect vaccine. Plus one really knows side effects said vaccine so.... What‚Äôs point you‚Äôre trying make? Assuming stories true, someone thinks it‚Äôs hoax going convince early January (had least one two jabs) average person politician could care less unfortunately. Damn, little misleading OP title English lol  I'd imagine things ramp pretty quickly, especially companies get vaccines approved. Agreed, prime minister Canada refuses despite repeated calls provincial leader Ontario order save province. It‚Äôs horrible trust reported numbers? tribalism getting worse worse, issue tribes getting vastly different news vastly different sources. politician Eats cheeseburger, half country hears politician slaughtering defenseless animals half hears politician single handed saving local business. They‚Äôre hearing different stories, stories aren‚Äôt even planet. 

Until message get sides reasonably well, we‚Äôre going find enough common ground remember respective humanities. Like what? graph showing want conclude.

The reality UK, Americas large parts Europe reality large infection numbers. bring numbers down, possible open Schools again, Finland, Taiwan Australia. February what, half population sort immunity? Whether it‚Äôs acquired vaccines actually infected. yeah makes sense infection numbers start drop. Thats plan resisting virus restrictions stay around longer Rad! everyone made aware , 210m adults 18 US need 90% vaccinated herd immunity, that‚Äôs 189m. might end little sooner people estimating keep pace Ah yes appears you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôve mislead headlines. said ‚ÄúI think real range somewhere 70 90 percent. But, I‚Äôm going say 90 point though amount immunity required provide immunity entire country may higher ~60-70% R0 3 due regional differences vaccine acceptance, natural infections, people‚Äôs behavior. It‚Äôs reason push people able safely get vaccinated so, need help get. Welcome California, we‚Äôre #1 US 2 million cases counting. pace amazing. think like 1.1 million 14 days 1.9 million 17 days? Something like that? can't find good per-day statistics. ramp think we'll come close 20M. plenty room keep moving them. let ones likely die go, put energy ones likely good outcome. bad disease probably going ever get point ICUs full thirty year olds run 5k's triathlons weekends. already point hospitals either admitting removing support 90 year old nursing home patients make room 70 year old lives home.

Shut borders flights. Hahahaha true story. saw first hand x-ray tech. things people swallow üò≥ Ah sorry never made mandatory, said highly recommend using them. apologies. still wore masks pretty heavily, probably difference normal people versus anti intellectual morons like half America dont shake hands, hug, put dirty shoes inside house No, original plan Dec. 29th got pushed 21st. spread misinformation. 9 month long enough? They‚Äôre still planning holding Coachella. -choshu satsuna japanese, doesnt seem like asia type inmunity covid? cause deaths per capita way low whole world same. half US takes flu vaccine generally period 3 months, would around 50 million per month 1.6 million per day. done. Thank you! significantly infectious

I agree, that's school closures useless. believe reports new variant higher infectivity, end game locking vulnerable hurrying vaccinations. wish states US could close borders, I'm pretty sure unconstitutional. instead people 50 different states traveling freely giant landmass. 

Also, someone lives near major international transportation hub, *really* wish could go way Japan close borders foreigners, definitely *is* constitutional. But... Trump, probably going happen. go Perhaps e.g. Andromeda Strain? No, expecting same. likely going result limited restrictions places surging. Nothing long term nothing affect average person (as masks really affect day day life) Like said, see, thinking hit 80% vaccination time next year reality either, opinion. see plays out. Nope Let's clear up. saying country born in, deserve beaten streets alongside billionaires?

I disagree everyone America huge advantage rest world regardless financial situation. I've expended idea another comment another user thread.

""
Great point, I've given lot thought past. global scale pretty much every American position grateful still think acceptable criticize billionaires. Ultimately think lot blame thrown towards u.s. government well can't imagine running country exactly easy. 

I like tell working improve living conditions everyone respective country, states, cities first step. create fair working model create country every citizen access food, water, shelter, expand helping countries. 

But right, even though there's still many problems America, compared parts world we've got great. 

It's asking point single individual much money? stop helping start help others? answers, know problem exists."" This. Even fatalities, long term organ damage COVID infection, financial devastation long term care American healthcare system enough person cautious. noooo.... seen reports give first dose set aside second dose place return. disruption distribution would really screw things people can't get second doses. another month group lining take it, anti vaxxers, want see many others take major problems. That‚Äôs bummer non Japanese residents planning participating/competing Japan‚Äôs biggest wrestling organizations biggest show year. already sanctioned 5000 attendees instead like 25k. still wonderful NJPW Wrestle Kingdom, even complicated seemed like things looking up. I‚Äôm openly racist... wtf talking üòÇ keep moving goalposts. We‚Äôre never going back normal. government ever lessened control people. said ‚Äúthe US handling COVID better many European countries, say otherwise deny basic science.‚Äù

And best 2 countries ‚Äúdoing poorly, worse‚Äù.

The burden you. Name many European countries.
And since said pick statistic, let‚Äôs use: New Infections per capita. denial phase? regularly donating stopped cases spiked area. Feel guilty want donate nervous risk close quarters donating. good discussion parameters here: nowehere achieved isolate old vulnerable people let younger people infect themselves. notorious example Sweden. 

Also, proponents herd immunity typically want social distancing mask wearing all. going all, closing schools useless pandemic measure irresponsible regard well-being children. unscientific, populistic, outright dumb.

Well, listen scientists. He‚Äôs part CDC. runs entirely different organization. New Zealand Australia, quite European countries, good cooperation lockdowns border closures. public outrage whenever someone case spread it.     

Btw western countries high freedom index too.        Japan dropped hammer travel Japan. Yes, agree frontline workers, so-called ""essential workers"" include people working liquor stores things like that. Chinese people aren‚Äôt like us Americans. Good them. ever mask mandate current one Auckland public transport. effect help contact tracing event another outbreak. Everywhere else every time recommendation (with low uptake) fact Dr Blomfield went way several times early explain werent mandating masks (low infection rate, maintain stock incorrect usage). wear mask shopping level lockdown Mat/Apr caution wasnt mandated.

Btw, outbreak Auckland hasnt one now.  mean, family fine financially we've fortunate enough anyone close us pass year. 

But isolation uncertainty year still debilitating. I've several awful depressive episodes last nine months. fact many people screwing keep trying. slap 'experts say' every moron follow advanced age make impending purchases lifetime subscriptions office 365 xbox game pass even sus. disagree. long forcing essential workers work, need vaccine deserve relief. elderly outside nursing homes, many position isolate. often pools essential workers. Plus, essential workers younger risk severe covid double fucked plan. There's plan Florida address younger pre-existing health problems. essential workers can't afford isolate, huge problem. 

It also address fact younger cases, potentially significant percentages, finding aftereffects months therefore making previously healthy work force sicker. Fewer severe cases, fewer hospitalizations, fewer recorded numbers. certainly help anyone's mental health bunch loved ones die permanently debilitated Covid either. Statistically risk goes exponentially age someone 80 literally like 1,000 10,000 likely get sick die. think makes sense vaccinate people contact first.

Next people spreading really guess likely asymptomatic people spreading really know. say kids, say people work relatively public places like grocery stores. area kid school think vaccinated. lot special needs kids school weeks/months. get wrong, I'd rather everyone worn masks. understand messaging I'm saying.  That‚Äôs true. Mask wearing rates differ greatly throughout Europe, many European countries much lower rates mask use US. harder say less airflow standing around constantly exposed over. accumulates. Hard say. Wasn‚Äôt Japan mostly shut already? know could longer fly awhile now. original statement questioning implies *new* changes society come Covid. society *changed*, meaning society one thing Covid something different it.

Ah, see. one people capacity recognize attitudes shape answer say ""system"" broken government care us. new. something wrestling decades. again, *changes* come covid effect society?

I guess spell out. People become exhausted. corruption, extreme measures, propaganda machines, withdraw individual basis.

Every decision make going 10 times impact life previously, positive negative.

My _point_ people even _aware_ bad is, real _situation_ cement _reality_ heads, opposed theoretical ideals. wife dinner, played bingo yahtzee, unwrapped gifts family Zoom. met midway towns quickly exchanged gifts gas station parking lot day Christmas. same, least everyone employed healthy. That's lot people say, especially COVID relief bill air US unemployment set expire. feel incredibly fortunate, things considered.

Hopefully we'll families reminiscing Christmas year now. see CDC's guidelines, honestly federal plan could even worse depending making decision. basically admitted prioritizing elderly despite knowing would cause deaths white. Can't use regular security guards, kept getting seduced inmates.

Here NZ can't use regular guards either people kept escaping.  excess death info Japan? Yes are. point isolating wearing masks washing hands **mitigation.** Learn words means, demonstrated understanding word keep trying use word ""pointless"" describe situation. point **and always be** mitigating effects pandemic.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* like use 'we' global decision.....where everyone stake situation ultimately everyone's lives risk. I'd say important fix issue hand. Going back analogy more, point complaining fridge manufacturer ever crap workmanship caused fire house still people trapped inside fire brigade taking sweet time getting here. means, everything control needs done stop happening future. Sure thankfully control now. fact media makes big deal day 10 new cases says lot well Australia faring compared countries. thinking too. Stupid healthcare workers wasted half doses refused vaccine. I‚Äôd much rather quickly find someone smart enough take let dose go waste. Read article. come Japanese citizens **and foreign residents** allowed enter must show proof negative coronavirus test 72 hours departing Japan must quarantine two weeks arrival, government said emailed statement. agree. prioritizing based profession living situation, first protecting people opportunity protect physical distancing.

People able work home retired able avoid social contact. smart and, example, always using curbside pickup, fairly easily reduce personal risk near zero.

I see allow 50 year old convenient store worker get sick work 75 year old unwilling protect themself avoiding in-person social contact. lol well shit, guess really both. Guys got range. lot people actively despise born civilization. want live secluded immediate family acknowledge acknowledged human. hate government exists wish could self sufficient rural land kill anyone steps foot it. refuse participate kind public health action takes fantasy world. True That's exactly it, systems finished yet including call scripts. call scripts know say towards questions vaccin could health complications. God knows take 2 months write something like that. fact infect animals makes harder, impossible, eradicate.

It jump animal population, circulate accumulate mutations, jump back human one away go.

Hopefully tracked newer vaccines easier manufacture. Yeah that's understand it, looking concrete stats. confirm, Mexican family tried shame coming thanksgiving Christmas parties year. 4 contracted covid. think it‚Äôs big deal. also blocked visiting caves Wuhan Institute Virology collected bat samples questionable safety conditions. video even get cave ground-breaking research different virus, SARS, carried out... end trip Yunnan trapped field hour"". Yeah tbh, wouldn‚Äôt surprise either country underreporting deaths point world adapts New Zealand's approach *after* getting control longer stricter lock down, keep transmission rates death rates keep hospitals capacity vaccines widely distributed.

Omg eye roll gtfo talking countries like Australia NZ etc took action really early back March we're able successfully stop spread getting bad Europe US. that's whole different case since they're basically covid free strict travel ban/quarantine rules etc since start pandemic obvious really get new strain. I'm talking countries like France, italy etc travel bans placed UK earlier week honestly late stop spread new covid variant since around since September would probably already spread France, Italy etc travel bans we're imposed UK like one person article left UK travel ban infected new variant. Weed? unethical ask. said tests, vaccines. accept fact full lockdowns, partial lockdowns, extensive government regulations going work, prioritize best mitigation strategies real world is.

They work places governments competent enough enforce them. best mitigation strategy good leadership. Sir, Reddit, read-it. Like governor eating health officials French laundry üòÇ Brazil may hiding India primary preference saving lives. get mad covid conspiracies.

SAME. work healthcare/public health landlord loves chat virus hoax, also dangerous ploy China, ofc vaccines work (they get flu every time get flu shot! üôÑ). nod try look horrified (because need place live wanna harassed late next year lease up). 

And course I'm pretty sure landlord gave wife covid. covid within 2 weeks getting new place, unnecessarily long indoor tour hosts wear masks. Makes mad. work fucking month.

Giving vaccine someone pay someone actually needs sit well people. (There may differences opinion American like way healthcare system works, lot us around world that's gross bizarre) people hate rich, think rich makes someone better people rich. can't transport distance anyway. Takes ambulances service long. Saw article saying Los Angeles beginning look UK strain now, late? Seems obvious here, fauci said too. looking month ago every big city? again, vaccines going US exclusively.

But expect February (and early too) stuff available public buying Vitamin D3 supplements recommended?  US going vaccinate 20 million people end 2020? hope okay, I'm sorry. California twice many people Australia Island. Yes, absolutely right! School important extent, missing school weeks turn children socially awkward, incapable adults. clear up. saying country born in, deserve beaten streets alongside billionaires?

I'm saying agree all- people say wealth redistribution big enough global scale, answer would yes, unfortunately. global scale- even developed country means amount wealth, even you, personally, literally single poorest person developed country- much richer average person undeveloped country them, would par billionaire country you, global scale, yes, deserve beaten streets alongside billionaires. people accept wealth inequality built global scale.

But far stuff- agree lot things. honestly, going ""help vs. helping others"", ties real issue wealth whole: biggest problem wealth inequality dreams get fulfilled, new dreams replace them...and fulfilled bare minimums, new things replace bare minimum. best example bare minimums describe water: average right now, every citizen US access water. bare minimum ""you water want it"" fulfilled, maybe problems like Flint ""okay, access water, there's problems pipes need fix give access clean water"" need fixed next...but people access water, instead thinking ""let's help make sure countries access water"", people instead go ""the tap water tastes little off, want Brita filter get better tasting water"", ""I want risk different taps, knows drinks those? want get bottles water"", becomes ""I want lift heavy 30 pack bottles time, want individual bottles water"", becomes ""the normal bottled water barely better tap water, want top-shelf fancy bottled water"", on. People's bare minimum subsistence water met, people want fancier fancier water instead. 

Same point happens everything- instead ""okay, bare minimum subsistence met"", instead trying meet others, people would rather try get better-quality ""what need"" becomes ""what WANT""...and even then, WANT also becomes nicer nicer luxuries well. Eventually, get like tell working improve living conditions everyone respective country, states, cities first step. create fair working model create country every citizen access food, water, shelter, expand helping countries.

But right, even though there's still many problems America, compared parts world we've got great.

*tips le heckin fedora* earlier mutation. discussed comments here: virologist. know think infectuous became dominant Europe, turned less infectuous feared.

The new B.1.1.7 mutation still investigated appearances seems much infectuous variants existing far - responsible majority infections London, 60%. don‚Äôt. cannot force state enforce kind restrictions including mask mandates. kind universal federal imposition would go Supreme Court first. way many states would reject it. It‚Äôs happening. Japan highest national debt world 200% GDP. probably shoot cases throw ditch. Meanwhile people forum worship complete lack freedom country bad they're trying *look* ""good"" host Olympics people notice terribly they've handled pandemic.

Almost government aid, people barely following mask/social distancing guidelines, absurdly low testing, packing *gymnasiums* literally non-essential stuff like *professional wrestling*, etc.

Watching NJPW wrestling shows crowd painful. People barely wear mask mouth stuff like 1-2k people freaking gymnasium, small, enclosed space.

Shinzo Abe cancer. guy he's groomed replace lot worse, since he's also younger. actually issue people think ok infect so-called family members, long as, get sick, stay home go hospital. 

People intentionally gave ""family"" Covid, deserve hospital bed medical professional put families risk treat someone selfish ignorant. /cure weird seeing seem value personal space caring fellow human beings second comes working expect literally work death. Also weird xenophobic 

I'm genuinely curious btw, find hard get proper answers questions though  Antibody test? Antibody test? vastly accurate Magic 8 Balls available? agree lifestyle absolutely. eating habits availability cheap filling food vs expensive nutritional food, certainly makes us target morbidity. Culture plays huge part. G3netics, I'm convinced.  Except that, example, 75 year olds easy tools protect themselves.

On top that, death. long-term effects permanently reduce persons quality life.

Essential workers risk older people able stay home choose to. course can. TFA says closed non-residents only. including China lot parents overwhelmed kids time pretty much let teens go wild. easy say shut schools kids need occupied time. Theres question going do? parents enforce this? Mental health also becoming concern. 

Theres also recent studies say schools open dont pose enough threat close. Apparently kids dont catch spread nearly much do. seems depend read days. happened flu? 330k 25% 1.75 million. gone anywhere anyone house since March. Christmas same. zoom calls Thanksgiving Christmas. 

I love family....and definition family causing possible harm death selfish needs.

Its really sick many Americans care family interferes self-absorbed wants.  I'm glad family like that. Literally every country this. country (unless moved) need go back need stay home like seriously stop selfish. I‚Äôm American desperately want things normal can‚Äôt don‚Äôt take seriously. know Godzilla radiation kills virus protective effect. fully agree. got many arguments people claim close schools, children failure life later on!

And I'm sitting thinking.. parents fucking school stay open, what's fucking point? people nowadays go kids' future market value. lifes. Absolutely. Australia, overseas visitors (or Aussies returning home overseas) quarantine two weeks. state Western Australia, woman runner quarantine days.

There‚Äôs massive manhunt searching twit could brought virus state hasn‚Äôt single case many months. Apparently she‚Äôs special rules don‚Äôt apply her. police released photos warned public go near see her, let know. 

We don‚Äôt muck covid lol. Well one German doctor spoke anti-vaxxers: know people hospitalized COVID often need blood transfusions right? condemning people death there‚Äôs enough blood transfusions. Stop calling bro, annoying. feds incentivize every day without violating state rights. me! Tested neg flying st Thomas usvi! tested neg returned. Don‚Äôt scared, smart. Spreading unavoidable. Controlled spreading hope for. Uncontrolled spreading means overrun healthcare many avoidable deaths people would survived can‚Äôt get treatment. 

Many people want cancer screenings, elective surgery etc continue. can‚Äôt hospitals full covid patients. 

I‚Äôm sure family 45+ would risk scenario. CNN New York Times level Russian propaganda media. redditors wake f realize people can't shut lives entire month?

Where children supposed go school hours? can't stay home, parents working. parents can't stay home, work feed children. Well guess cannot faulted vaccinating seniors first faulted following guidelines put forth CDC believe every state following. Even he‚Äôs right, shithead wrong. think issue manufacturing enough doses. Distribution actually administering shots problem. Americans (especially democrats) scared shirtless Russians love attack every chance get. mean won‚Äôt wouldn‚Äôt even help now... still don‚Äôt get people flying internationally. fault thicker oatmeal hon 90% would mean estimated R0 10, there's way high. us do. nurses family. stayed strict quarantine entire time. wonder unique variant. carriers virus has, longer active host, chance mutation. mutation might something worse, something makes milder effects, effect all. Monkey swings first door left. ANR group banquet hall. ""UK"" ethnicity federal government next nothing force states incentivize anything. That‚Äôs state sovereignty. 

No bro, again, epidemiologists have, actual people charge imposing them. It‚Äôs hysterics point vaccine rollout governed politics rather reality health crisis ground. Lotta places done lot worse Melbourne. Border closed US visitors first week April UV light never doubted ability kill germs - we've using shit decades - moronic suggesting insert skin. Shutting world 2 weeks sounds intelligent don‚Äôt actually contribute anything grown job quickly realize that‚Äôs realistic. sure not. pressure health systems relieved, guidelines relaxed course clear guidelines behave regards risks. see normalcy people vaccinated long herd immunity. evidence suggest effect gets worse subsequent exposure? I.e. might fine first 2 dose course, reason needed take another course vaccines PEG later life, higher risk.


This could jeopardize lot supposed benefits mRNA vaccines (rapid development time) that's true (assuming find PEG alternative). lack reading skills bot account cringey, I'm gonna say lil slower, I.. rather..have..a...politician...in office...than... a.. failled... conman...with no...political..knowledge REALLY think simple. think lot Americans wanting gather private ain't one gonna tell us do. Anyone thinks definition ""family"" means fine endangering lives...you really family. group selfish people getting together needs one else's.

Real families friends intentionally things could cause harm death. Well look Pfizer vaccine, government funding hesitancy longer valid! Jes√∫s. really typed assumed news articles see exist.

How embarrassed deficiency? Yeah anti-mask idiots Reddit used argue incessantly work shut line justification recently, data work countries high mask compliance. ridiculous. Let's keep going analogy. Say brand fridge company suddenly known cause fires. think company do? Recall entire lot. Happens meat, phones, name it. point complaining it. Preventative measure equally important fixing shit hand. No. would‚Äôve easier contain US island. think Americans change get sick, loved ones

It's way world except areas Asia Pacific.  someone explain countries introducing draconian lockdowns point, already vaccine significant portion population already virus. What's exactly purpose destroying economy, already verge catastrophe? protested Melbourne still locked right thing do. I'm protesting using voice solely express selfish idiotic horseshit, deserve ignored truly believe slaughterhouses, destruction native habitats, worker ptsd, zoonotic diseases including covid else far important than..... proteins, also carry risk heart disease cancer. that's even getting environmental effects ofcourse cruelty distrust, aka knowing governments corrupted, think saints worship them, still follow laws morally right thing do. laws followed laws abuse human rights. Wearing masks abuse rights. Looks like PEG suspected causing anaphylactic reactions people while. seriously suggesting anyone really cares pay 15 20 Euro vaccine? Hint: no

The authorization EU delayed, wanted regular/full authorization, takes longer emergency authorization. see reason approach delay came it.

If strong political pressure, mainly Germany, doubtful anyone would received vaccine year.

Remember: millions shots given world first German received vaccine. vaccine developed Germany, German company, funded German government.

And cut stupid talk Russia UK. EU bureaucracy serious problems. denial make worse. hurt you? mad little guy? Apart situation dynamic, happens often children tested less frequently, often symptomatic. smaller absolute number positive tests, concluded less children get infected, wrong - one needs correct relative frequency tests. one this, children show equal higher percentages  I'm really sorry hear got infected I'm glad feeling better. family 3 hard quarantine since March. go anywhere except grocery store parking lot pick groceries curbside pickup. cancelled holidays zoom calls rest family.  friends family same. We've actually cut ones endangering others lives. can't friends family think behavior ok.

Thank do...I'm sure number selfish, self-absorbed people there...but thank you. please know us really everything keep hospital personnel safe risk family's lives treating us intentionally got sick. Happy Holidays! Australia also taking tourists since March.  LAC DPH Health Advisory:

^probably rich private armies. Affording couple security guys protect mob angry people also buy guns. take much practice use gun effectively either. 

In case numbers cases would trivial raise mob that's many times larger largest private security force. Even President US go underground mobs pretty good on-site army, really army large crowd would easily outnumber entire White House staff.

The goes rich person, almost none, dictators, large multi hundred person security forces hand could easily overwhelmed rather small crowds. doubt, cases, crowd would even armed shoot overwhelming numbers usually make things much much worse anybody burn house rich person house ground trivial amount resources. 

In way rich anywhere near safe masses rise crowd come armed rich person kind security force thousands site dictators control real armies. ""Come on!"" - Gob Bluth, Arrested Development countries enforced even though weren‚Äôt legally allowed implement first place? 

How go? vaccine question. Let's say get vaccine exposed live COVID day. Would get sick?  lot fear mongers also exaggerating economic toll lockdowns, too. calmly look facts, make logical conclusions it‚Äôs overblown. facts.

- Every consecutive month thereafter rate dropped reaching 6.9% October 2020.

- According Covid Health Projections Social Distancing Tracker, 50 US States eased coronavirus restrictions degree starting May majority peaking June/July.

- point pandemic Americans ever locked homes forcefully confined.

- Restaurants remained open capacity (carry out, outdoor dining, etc) 50 US States throughout pandemic.

Now I‚Äôm trying downplay economic toll pandemic. realize hit families hard, even entire industries still red. people affect devastating thoughts prayers go them.

But families lost loved ones covid say thing. remains worst public health event America since 1918 Pandemic. COVID-19 top 3 causes death US months now, we‚Äôre seeing overloaded ICU capacity several parts country.

The entire situation sucks end day covid restrictions important reduce strain frontline health care system. ends absolutely justify means, I‚Äôd argue aren‚Äôt enough. well, since admitting defeat even faltering extent acknowledge check source something emotionally comfortable. know happens not. person often maintain opinion fully moment actual heat conflict there's emotional incentive seen correct others perspective may come in. long right particular thing tied personal identity wrong would painful sight.

No don't!

Also, make claim, google search.

LOL main points flattening curve prevent run-up hospitals also give time treatment plans worked (vaccines, medicine infected, etc). October, curve flattened really well things considered bought us six months research time.

The research progressed amazingly fast, know. federal government failed prepping states inevitability happened October- people got COVID fatigue enough people stopped caring curve started spike.

Mathematically position flattening curve anything. daily case count high. curve needs reduced, greatly quickly, want real impact.  Mistrust?

But would anybody reason mistrust government medically exploited experimented people?

That'd silly. boulanger tart au pommes need coin toss ten thousand times realize chance get heads roughly 50%? No, don't. sequencing virus strains. need ten thousand samples know portion samples new strain. many coin tosses effect probability outcome. many virus samples analyze effect portion samples new strain.

The idea samples others turning almost exclusively old strain analyze less samples equivalent claiming likely throw 1000 heads row coin toss, would need throw coin probability reveals itself. makes sense. concerned climate change (I.e. happens earth warms) concerned another pandemic happening life time because............climate change happening, right now, today, causing ......pandemics, bunch things.

No. bat could caught China, sent different country virus mutated eventually made way back China.

LOT people study 3-6 months, get score want, study another 3-6 months take again. average MCAT matriculants med school 80th percentile, get screened anything less 50th (they even open application). bottom 50% gonna retake, take MCAT 3 4 times. Even people 80th percentile retake competitive. So, 3-6 months lucky genius.  Theoretically best people like comfortable inside homes. take every caution outside inside home much. That‚Äôs got vast majority families right? opposed people made bad decisions got ‚ÄòRona? would speculate majority people got infected things ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. 

Access healthcare based life choices since things aren‚Äôt supposed usually need see doctor. came took family member mine Red hat deniers simply fuck off. problem huge chunk population berating government anything. another similarly sized chunk opposite.

Questioning staying inside 2022, cutting countless fear mongering articles, using r/covid19 primary source make ‚Äúcovid19 conspiracy theorist‚Äù.  *enjoy* getting cold flu? *like* body aches, fever, diarrhea, sore throat?

What told you, way GREATLY reduce chances ever get cold flu again? Would interested?

Ok, is: anyone even thinks they're getting sick wear mask duration illness. social norm could looked upom considered rude/disrespectful wear mask sick. keeps germs protects others illness. Also, social distance sick, too, even wearing mask.

That's it!! *Those 2 things need collective vastly reduce number cold flu cases see every year!* People would healthier, productive, able take less medications.

I remember going airport last November influenza outbreak south. fucking disgusting. Literally least 2 every 5 people hacking coughing sneezing. even covering mouth anything, radiating viral bodies space everyone around them. got super sick that. fever, missed 2 days work, felt like death 3 4, took good 2 weeks get back normal could work again. could prevented mask wearing distancing. 

So ask you, rather wear mask get sick? sick sucks, really does. lose good week two living life stupid virus bacteria. 

Personally, would much rather wear mask wish fucking sick people would too. see unreasonable slightest, worth insulting someone about. No, able see facial expressions, quite frankly care. needs see random peoples faces store? business meeting hanging friends family, going eat obviously take off. 

So say ditch masks nobody ever wear mask care spreading illness people ridiculous...for someone refuse wear mask despite sick contagious illness negatively impact other's lives, unreasonable viewpoint (in opinion). isn‚Äôt even ‚Äúnever‚Äù now.

March, lockdowns announced get reliable medical information Covid infection might mean son rare heart valve defect aortic aneurysm, suggested ex stay house, hunker together (when seemed like it'd 2-3 weeks, maybe month). refused, weird he'd rather son apartment building him.

But.

The herd immunity range 70-90% long time, even 90% correct, I'm okay Fauci saying could ""as low 70%."" get Fauci would want encouraging lean toward lower number there's skepticism around vaccine. get would want shift new data comes in, people express confidence vaccine.

I think article overemphasizes ""moving goalposts."" Fauci's statement sound like he's saying ""yeah, lied you"" rather explaining spoke optimistically pessimistic (or maybe realistic).

He's warning us could high 90%...not setting stone that's absolute herd immunity number. optimistic, could low 70%. Idk, that's reads me. I'm still frustrated it, think blatant falsehood. vaccine rollout slow? We‚Äôre apparently 11 million doses delivered given barely 1 million them. get wanting save half, means 4 million least. It‚Äôs absolutely insane terribly they‚Äôre handling distribution them. We‚Äôre freaking there! damn shots, give people! need activate national guard expedite it? Jeez Science says 70-90%

Scientist says low end admits saying opinion higher.

OMGWTFBBQSAUCE HES LIAR! DUMB READING! HES LYING! OMG. TELL EVERYONE TOP NUMBER EVEN DATA DIDNT SUPPORT IT! R SMARTER! needed amount always 70 90%.

First gave lower number make achievable goal. went people vaccinated, safer becomes. straight hopeless. also artificially limit number people become via good ol boys run organization? serious pleasing overbearing parents, work? Oh maybe, would make sense context, though usually see ""CS"" used people: vaccine vaccine yay yay!

covid: time game bois, activating plan B Medical ethics ancient times include requirement, ""First, harm.""  

Lying patient, large group patients, clearly harm. causes patients mistrust advice doctor gives future. 

Instead, say something like, ""We sure, yet, best guess."" communicates truth (the best guess), lie (there really uncertainty), avoids tarnishing doctors reputation guess turns wrong. source this?

You're grasping very, early-year trends somehow claim death carnage Sweden instead.

It's ... unique approach. I'll give that. Reductions 40, 50, whatever percent don‚Äôt work something like covid. remaining percentage going continue spread it. It‚Äôs nothing. Otherwise basically slowing inevitable spread.

## decoy neutralize SARS-CoV-2

Many efforts develop therapies severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) focused interaction spike protein, decorates surface virus, host receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Linsky *et al.* describe de novo design strategy allowed engineer decoy proteins bind spike protein replicating hACE2 interface. best decoy, CTC-445, bound low nanomolar affinity, selection viral mutants decrease binding unlikely would also affect binding hACE2. bivalent version CTC-445 bound even tightly, neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection cells, protected hamsters SARS-CoV-2 challenge. stable decoy potential respiratory therapeutic delivery.

*Science*, issue p. Abstract

We developed de novo protein design strategy swiftly engineer decoys neutralizing pathogens exploit extracellular host proteins infect cell. pipeline allowed design, validation, optimization de novo human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) decoys neutralize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). best monovalent decoy, CTC-445.2, bound low nanomolar affinity high specificity receptor-binding domain (RBD) spike protein. Cryo‚Äìelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) showed design accurate simultaneously bind three RBDs single spike protein. decoy replicates spike protein target interface hACE2, intrinsically resilient viral mutational escape. bivalent decoy, CTC-445.2d, showed \~10-fold improvement binding. CTC-445.2d potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection cells vitro, single intranasal prophylactic dose decoy protected Syrian hamsters subsequent lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Never mind couple illnesses prior covid ran rampant far deadly.

 certain suppose they'd survive covid infection better, absolutely correct ""super healthy begin with"" part statement. I'm saying half right, we're certain exactly makes virus deadly many cases.

If countries would closed borders 60-90 days, stepped help China would mess in, everyone short sighted selfish.  

If lucky things return normal summer 2022. today! Good, people want travel see families able travel. need tyrannical governors enforcing lockdowns work... think concern is? vaccine work? effective less 90%? people dying getting sick taking it? I'm critical trying verify media, reporting agencies, scientific data, news agencies biased governments companies financial forces, what's issue here? We've already got delivery method, need inhale chlorine gas turns hydrogen chloride lungs. might accidentally using words blacklisted sub. Im this, Trump shut whole country people like Nancy Pelosi telling people go parade streets. mention, dems telling people monsters wore masks ‚Äútook away healthcare workers‚Äù... flipped script nowhere said EVERYONE MUST WEAR MASKS!

Apparently Hungary said ""fuck that"", wait European pride ceremony started vaccinating today.

Most countries already vaccine doses lying boxes waiting Sunday come finally open coordinated effort cool pictures.

Ridiculous. joke. saying deliberate. Knock knock, it‚Äôs United States see irony saying ""survival fittest"" demanding everybody accommodates fit survive covid? argument makes sense side. Evolutionarily speaking, let nature take course, survival fittest! can't survive flu, gene pool anyway!

I sure troll, there's way someone could make shit argument sincerity lol Look percentage Americans these. I'm sure there's overlap groups, hypertension almost 40% population obesity 40%. 86% comorbidities might correlation cause effect. countries free Healthcare paid? partially correct. Everyone responsibility themselves. we're also part society action inaction affects everyone. drunk driving laws. we, least, advocate everyone adhere proper covid protocols. one thing actions affects yourself, another affects people.

*Were* empty. Things basically normal even though cases rising quickly. Tokyo hit 1000 cases per day first time ever (Hence border shutdown). border shutdown us mostly xenophobia anyway.

That even include payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes. fact feature public corporations double taxation company shareholders.

Altho, ivermectin used parasitic infections benefit people using ivermectin anyways treat things, impossible helped degree least 42% Americans obese bare minimum 42% underlying condition. they're defining hospital readmissions?  different degrees fucked. We're definitely badly fucked right now, there's big difference between, say, ten people per hospital next week making triage get bed, five hundred people per hospital next week making triage get bed.

It's though literally every person given thrown caution winds. We'd far disastrous situation true.

If hadn‚Äôt left apartment months actually going put many people risk? first time traveled one row showed right flight lines airport. second time slightly busier overall still able distance myself. aisle sat completely clear surrounding rows somewhat vacant. encountered less people flying grocery.


I haven‚Äôt hung friends months, visited girlfriend parents. exposure outside traveling them. see people upset others traveling don‚Äôt understand demonization it. People‚Äôs attitude towards pandemic swings anti-science different breed anti-science authoritarianism. world absolutely bonkers, abide bullshit 6ft rule really 10-20ft, people running around without masks, people socializing going drinking. I‚Äôm lockdown practicing containment, point realize can‚Äôt mitigate risk without everyone board.


Everyone weighed containment options, see people parks socializing barely 6ft away, non-essential jobs marked essential, people pick choose bubbles effectively don‚Äôt bubble. IMO think point reduce many contacts can, point *everyone* made choice isn‚Äôt perfect. Maybe doesn‚Äôt excuse I‚Äôve done, damn it‚Äôs annoying see much white knighting hypocrisy. That's exactly happened Wuhan went lockdown. defeats purpose lockdown give people notice implemented. reason might explain Nordic countries 30% Corona patients hospitals immigrants. course example Finland took almost one year capital region hospitals recommend taking D-vitamin supplements old immigrant... Sometimes political correct kills. Oh, I'm enraged right! situation, information. :-) Ok whatever say  local COVID ward ER taking volunteers anything? 

At least help. Japan country spent time completely isolated mostly self sufficient. western country would able this. Leadership national level sucked balls. help CDC telling people wear masks unless already infected. hurt changed recommendation road one believed them. Dang. 1 month old account. happened main account buddy? racism! Retarded fear porn better analogy driving drunk.

""Muh freedoms! feel scared driving drunk, stay home!"" /s current surge we've seeing almost certainly linked directly Thanksgiving travel yet learning g'damned thing. maybe low-IQ communities simply practice necessary precautions control infection rates? locked everything one month back march, would like China right now: economy back normal. Instead, dummies refusing masks, hawking saline solutions cure, everyone else suffers economy cannot get back normal covid prevalent. idiots scared economic ruin causing economic ruin JFC. desperately Googled hopes bad data. Nope.

Others won‚Äôt either. it‚Äôs mutated spread easily cold. neighbors two households staying Christmas (in tiny 1100 sq.ft. unit), I‚Äôm morbidly wondering going succumb first. Probably me. question one asking this: Japan still suffering? already culture masking pre-covid masks public already ubiquitous. hasnt bloomberg vaccine tracker updated two days?  Shutting travel china make sense? virus originated?

And talking late January here, knows much travel would banned long run become contentious issue 


This comment thread making depressed. zealots can't even admit Trump may accidentally taking right course action early on. Even right thing wrong reason  Exactly. asked question weeks ago kids get back together play- adequate adults involved vaccinated? got slack asking, kids dying, I'm obviously ridiculous. 

The fact virus get brain fuck around (loss smell/taste); else there? new neurological issues going discovered 10 years, caused dormant COVID-19 something? Like chickenpox/shingles. 


Obviously know, one else either, annoying people say ""they dying, nbd."" people killed pandemic Japan died coronavirus. feel like static similar preexisting conditions. look hard enough, find something.

Jumping ""could saved"" ""it's worth it"" debate. responsible minimal consequence terms overall quality life (like wearing seatbelt), course makes sense. lot people. One example: people developed substance abuse disorders due prolonged isolation.

Anime must flow! live agree. 

The government might stupid US response awful. 


One major become like others Western countries culture wearing masks taking seriously transmissible diseases like flu. surface transmission small percentage? I‚Äôm shocked appalled pathetically low testing numbers lack anything close useful contact tracing. It‚Äôs like lessons NZ, Taiwan, South Korea Australia ignored.

How already 3am üò≠ China‚Äôs government sent everyone strict mandates seriously enforced lockdowns. exact opposite people taking precautions own, one mandated required anything. America way fatties Japan. Sounds like US needs fat tax like JP Haha. means. year 2100, people live year 2100. Meanwhile, Aussies Zealanders (tribe) still live year 2020. curious would affect us military government civilian movements. knowing language essential travel Japan? Closing borders would racist tho update weekends? Monday interesting! EpiPen. Hope need one.

I've never use mine years since I've getting them. ones currently expired, ""juice"" inside window still clear, think they've gone bad, either. However, probably visit doctor get fresh ones prior taking vaccine. New Zealand Australia well. NZ repatriation flights since March. (The exceptions studios work here, couple sports teams must isolate go quarantine quite harsh.) affect export stuff? sure wasnt m√∂√∂se? get advice please? employee lives father tested positive Covid right around Thanksgiving. employee tested positive well first week december. much better wishes return work, asked get tested came back negative. father however went get tested well test still coming back positive even though symptoms. safe return work even though healthy negative father lives isnt? sure 6 year old gunna good time you‚Äôre planning look historical items take time so. lol, no. won't, knows better. people wonder even get take right now. Everything buy store packaged sanitized bring home. Russia actually two (approved) vaccines, one adeno, second peptide-based. Also, like nobody washes hands. rarely seen soap public bathroom. Maybe they'll rinse fingers water best. Shows important mask wearing ""sanitation measures"" businesses tout may form theater only. Lol, realized troll, nevermind. takes 1-2 months vaccine immunity build up. first batches start ramp up. good time rush, closely monitor distribution system handling catch problems end stupid situation like boxes vaccines lost forgotten depot. least people traveled car. it'll stop spread they're still gathering others.

Kirk Cameron fucking moron. Smoke what? Right, require anything, lose everything Someone's feeling smart taking undergrad stats look mortality (arguably best number look at) DPC see major European countries fall far behind US. much people math science, amirite?
Look man, get r/conspiracy2 suck pride moment look numbers.

*Of course* type edit reply like coward. shit EXACTLY quote parent comments. 

Like said CANNOT comprehend reason, looking mortality ""infection rate versus population"" ADDITION mortality rate, statistic misleading shit. 

Also saying ignores **biggest fucking issue regards covid**. virus kills like black plague (even though deadly get wrong), virus HIGHLY contiguous due floods medical infrastructure. didn‚Äôt. Cause there‚Äôs pandemic. \#CanRelate dude... want trust Russia? country built hidden room behind washrooms Olympics swap drugged Russian athletes pee clean pee? already called racists wanting 6-8 months ago. Japan shutting inside country outside. almost like exactly every country world right now. Open inside shut outside, travel, immigration fully closed borders least year. smart fucking idea! Huh, one said that. 


They called death ""statistics"" can't fully trusted. point. Sure. Calling something dicks isn‚Äôt hating. dick EU? accounts I've heard EU shitload people acting way US Weebs: O_O Nothing new Japan say we're homies talk bad papa Elon?

He's shitty example point making. rational market enriched much pandemic. company happens meme stock valuation based near monopoly decade so, that's going 2020. right thing... replying comment ignored history post-war work make sure happen again. Human lives mere statistic.  Fantastic comment. think someday name ""Fauci"" elicit much scorn name ""Wolfowitz."" Damn, pissed coffee morning?  Well yes exactly point. seems extremely unlikely new strain wouldn‚Äôt LA yet haven‚Äôt found despite looking it. 

In mid December Wales second highest per capita rate infection world. retrospectively attributed new strain found London according ONS prevalence stats 10% covid cases Wales time new strain. (half size LA County) Hopefully means ramp production PS5 AC air output dry cold, according research better aerosolizing infectious particles. good example plain physics effects virus spread, analyzed terms weather human behavior. live AZ definitely saw huge spike people started turning AC going inside beginning summer, also dry summer virtually rain, lots strong UV though. Hi there, post comment removed suitable r/coronavirus.

Please know alone frustration many people feel same. I'm glad venting want thank using space vent unfortunately, remove comment due fact best-suited sub type discussion.

I suggest checking out: popular sub might helfpul is: /r/SuicideWatch

And general reference heere list mental health subs might helpful oppenly discuss feel; *Diversions Yeah well got 'God Emperor' love long ago. used two remote countries world example. Hollywood rarely makes blockbusters set Africa African leads 

Only disaster movie many Asian actors Great Wall rest California leave can't come back foreigner. work essential sector. I'm wrong all. hypocrisy judge fly, yet people come store multiple times per week put others risk: Ask places like sri lanka cost dealing PRC. saying anything different imperial powers done. certainly better USA, Brits, country ambitions empire. 
Nothing free China days. comes price. Yea you‚Äôre assuming perfectly even age distribution among subgroups within country make assumption specific one them, ignoring variables. 

The average life expectancy doctors Nigeria isn‚Äôt going remotely life expectancy of, example, men aren‚Äôt doctors living Nigerian slum... there‚Äôs many hundreds times men slum skewing average down.

In reality low life expectancy mainly caused high levels infant deaths, high rates maternal mortality, rampant HIV, whole lot preventable, treatable diseases run rampant poor areas. many areas rely traditional medicine rather modern medicine...so die much higher rate. 

 doctor far less likely die factors due knowledge medicine access immediate care, driving life expectancy subgroup significantly. 

Your assumption like saying, ‚Äúdue high number fishermen Norway, Norwegian men twice likely die drowning men USA. assume Norwegian farmer probably twice likely die drowning farmer USA.‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt work like that. done nothing? article suggests may known look now.  agree equivalencies, ok. Hundreds thousands sacrificed lives Jews killed. hundreds thousands sacrificed lives Jewish, went anyway. Willingly. help humankind. stop deadly disease white supremacist madman. 

And people stayed behind broke codes rationed food oil grew gardens...to help humankind. I'm sure felt like unjust prison sentence. 

Currently, 1.8 million people dead Covid. third Jews killed Hitler's Germany. 9 months. supposed let another 1.8 million die ""freedom""?

Patience virtue. guess most. wish could give some! little reduce mortality rates policy level, mortality dependent overall health nation pandemic level knowledge treating symptoms. comparing responses pandemic comparing infection rates per capita time, directly controlled policy. Honestly, worst part even system fundamentally broken.

Rather, year proven system fixed EASILY QUICKLY. Seriously, pandemic, lockdown hurt things, responses shown everyone firsthand: everyone USA decided general strike say ""we're working give us [x]"", matter people ask for, matter pie sky cockamamie seems, country cave within week.

That's problem- even fundamental issues are, there's large amount people country sides political spectrum totally driven nothing sheer hatred ""other"" they'd RATHER system remain broken sheer spite, they'll gladly trade happiness ""other""'s misery honestly, seeing miserable makes happier happiness ever could.  fact anyone currently complying ""come senses confronted reality hospitals deal with."" honestly think anyone complying know hospitals dealing with. suppose theoretically possible avoid literally news, social media, friends family follow news...but many people like LA County?

I think everyone knows. Whether know little, lot, personally, friends/coworkers/the news, know. think every single news source covers COVID situation LA saying bad, really can't imagine saying even louder/more frequently point change anyone's mind needs changed. makes sense though. they're among high-risk groups getting soon, really need it. largest vaccination campaign ever. course going go according plan, dont think anyone actually thinking would 20 million vaccinated end year. looking like may get close 10 million. good point. blamed spike London London restrictions start month despite good amount cases massive surge enevitable. Shutting economy also affects people financially, another way.  Look last REACT study UK ONS. Let never broken sacred COVID rules first line care. Wait, mean? visited Japan U.S. March. seems standard little behind compared CDC count Gee, every turning bizarre day.

I even surprised UK parliament cancels Brexit free trade deal. not. went last year, really fun. Except got reaaaaallly sick afterwards. Fuck experts ban countries time remove nonwhites country It‚Äôs irresponsible news outlets publish stuff. one wants wear masks social distance longer it‚Äôs necessary. there‚Äôs new article every month moves goalposts says ‚Äúnah previous goal wasn‚Äôt good enough, shoot instead‚Äù people get fed think it‚Äôll never end. anti-maskers skeptics thing. Thanks. something new me. Probably everyone wears mask likely hear people arrested news Korean media glorify morons. That's interesting, 1-2 weeks prior criticized UK rushing approval: 


If that's anything go by, means consistent, criticisms Russia's ""rushed approval"" prevent Russian vaccine approved study results presented.  


Unfortunately that's likely wishful thinking. I'm sure we'll hear plenty ""this vaccine never approved Russia rushed approve it"". should. reason allow travel unless specific emergency. Math math silly measure pandemic response per capita deaths though.  Deaths function imported infections, growth rate. Imported infections vaguely correlated population size, also reflection government policy. 

Basically, country 100 million 100 deaths, country 1 million 1 death, 100 million country 100 times worse, broadly speaking. Why? Fauci, guy every left leaning person revers here, one said it. joke. Atlantic Canada. Aw I‚Äôm fine thank you! appreciate that. I‚Äôm girl, ovulation, haha, raised stress anxiety. Soon calmed went back down. also concerns long term effects organ damage. know happening, widely talked about, impacts society significant. Feel free correct me, \~6 people 300k monitored allergic reactions? flu, rubella, common vaccine? agree using military. think Israel it. bets 2020 Olympics getting pushed 2022? question is: worth exposing children novel virus without consent? 

And this, parents well-being heavily depends on. Quite generalization Lol take super woke fact entirely new technology vaccine tested 1/8th amount normal vaccine tested, concern everyone. what? 10m day completely unnecessary need 1m day (and get J&amp;J AZ) herd immunity August September terribly untrue. people China celebrate Christmas. younger generation may use day party.

Source: former colleague mainland China already it, family close start vaccination way paranoid. see going go...people expecting government change decision making processes include expediency going get way time. People sacrifice anything businesses simply provide non-distanced gatherings. simply allowed nursing home follow rules. things really individuals. Yeah mean it‚Äôs pretty understood point children vaccinated effect timeline rly I‚Äôve seen, furthermore people denying vaccine aren‚Äôt people vaccinated end pandemic (at risk people healthcare workers) think expectations pretty justified haha sources? yourself, could elaborate show evidence. 

I've also noticed exact phenomena looking case graphs, even extreme surges cases lockdowns can't extract solid argument impossible know would happen otherwise identical circumstances (same country, people, climate, weather). mostly unenforceable theater. shutting stuff much. Japan doesnt get pass, theyre part political correct West. Maybe France start ignoring media well whatever think best. anything illegal morally wrong country closing borders? Seems like right Japan's government want. Assuming live US third world country. concern me. Hopefully least limit wild animals away human populations. natural logical. Virus spreads exponentially, reason decrease unless govt. hard lockdown again. want to, areas probably something discussing today. 

Also, going sudden miraculous appearance hospital facilities. Nah, that‚Äôs percentage China now. Japanese younger generations smoke less drink less, fucking nightmare tobacco alcohol industries. Risk factors different Japan compared US diseases well. high rates smoking low rates lung cancer. never arguing done defend virus best course action. Americans, clearly haven‚Äôt succeeded this. Look what‚Äôs going on. isn‚Äôt trumps fault. One single person couldn‚Äôt fix this. doesn‚Äôt help trying fix it, democrats everything power make harder him. example, Nancy pelosi taking MONTHS present covid relief bill piece shit mockery American people. 

I simply arguing liberals call anything racist matter context reality simply bc irrational, illogical, non-factually based hatred him. Furthermore, people voted Biden ‚Äúhe wasn‚Äôt racist trump is‚Äù..you‚Äôre harsh reality check. Joey b long political history support discriminating policies. Don‚Äôt say he‚Äôs lesser two evils bc interms polices put place people, Joe Biden supported policies way worse negative affects black American population politicians today. wanna talk different topic isn‚Äôt trump racist liberals low threshold racist trump tho, can. think understand people saying. soon hospitals danger overwhelmed, begin go back normal. political restrictions already waning. already leaders like Governor Cuomo social distancing can't go 9 months, he's guy actually making kind decisions. Coming someone wrong also touch that‚Äôs big bold statement. mean, they‚Äôre still planning Coachella Broadway‚Äôs opening pretty early next year. care deaths, take pandemic seriously. traveled anywhere myself.

I also think people travel Christmas refused medical care, posters suggested. they're not, signaled this. locked Samut Sakhon, provincial governors (such Rayong) added local restrictions, national shut news I've seen. cases detected 38 provinces (counting Bangkok province) yet local restrictions provinces. Testing extensive countries battling much longer, they're playing catch-up outbreak got 1000 infections detection. We've seen countries, gets wide spread, die down. 

A couple sources: comedy reasons, Matthew Perry first flight Japan open back up? One say UK since November, school children show infections age groups. See study discussion: REACT study London Imperial College)  person homeschools kids math science, agree. least political system actually stuff fight covid unlike US Ontario premier values holiday spending peoples health. First, importantly: I'm genuinely sorry loss, hope keeping well.

While understand anger frustration, really need ask insult users sub call names. know difficult, considerable research shows people attacked insulted, makes *harder* change minds become amenable taking measures like wearing masks physical distancing. Moreover, drives people away forum places *won't* challenged live echo chamber conspiracy theories. That's want, I'm sure that's counterproductive want -- control pandemic.

Thank you! obviously  US first dibs vaccine. US already 11million doses Canada 400k doses end year.  met Japanese dude traveling across Europe. shared year prior, finished two year prison sentence marijuana possession....personal possession dealing.

Though 15 years ago, idea drug laws still draconian. forget possibly flu getting /spreading flu! We're middle flu season people believe masks/proper covid safety probably believe flu shot either.

Buckle every one, please stay safe... I'm fucking horrified we're going seeing weeks. 1/8th elapsed time. able long-term study covid mRNA vaccines they're new! No, number NERVTAG report Johnson cited. based modelling data fitting uncertainty. understand details science believe means R0 new variant 1.7 R0 old variant 1.0. supported newer data analyses. There‚Äôs plenty evidence Chinese government imprisons ethnic minorities thousands (possibly millions) there‚Äôs wide scale organ harvesting performed populace. It‚Äôs conjecture use people coronavirus related research, likely much less invasive fatal thing someone. much leap?

Okay, I‚Äôve humored explained reasoning. tell comments amount murder? I‚Äôm understanding comes from. lmao western world ass sub absolutely obsessed blaming every spike holiday sore reason reality situation real driver pandemic people ignoring social distancing going bars/restaurants/parties/not wearing masks/etc every single day year. look trends around major holidays year can't make definitive conclusions. 48 fucking hours, worked protocol re-allowing entry. 
If want blame someone, blame lorrys drivers‚Äô employers planned this, especially since plenty sufficient warning go back home shutdown.

Meanwhile Japan praised basically emptying country foreigners &amp; cancelling people‚Äôs visas without appeal, also gotta appreciate timing : right Holidays many went visit families abroad. We're exporting freedom contagious diseases like forefathers wanted. Im honestly surprised spread covid bases lead national push remove bases. know government never host reasons seems like rest country care Okinawans problems all, guess surprise either things considered, imperialism everything. What‚Äôs point mandate one follows point?

There‚Äôs point all. You‚Äôre arguing faith even still mandates next winter (highly doubtful) there‚Äôs merit even one place isn‚Äôt. 1/50,000 pretty high frequency side effect severe. Vaccines typically incredibly safe. yeah, talking engineering prof hvac cfm/person requirements pointed similar one said ""measure c02, good proxy cfm/person""

-----

file stuff knew enough start April led greediest absolutely incompetent government ever important takeway here, always: ""point airborne pathway important contribution transmission"". US casually administers 200M flu shots every year course 2 months. scale nicely. phase 1a completed end year seem unrealistic. Curious claim that, almost every time COVID-19 comes people claiming ""oh young die fine.""  also count fingers one hand many news stories covered aspect virus. 

I think observation comes looking limited sampling situations, rather broader world. Australia's shut since March. Good call. Covid aren't. Agreed! Japan's geriatric government done horrible job, Japanese people handling extremely well compared Western countries. think country earth 100% compliance ? SK isn‚Äôt utopia people don‚Äôt get murdered everything‚Äôs perfect OP rail pass amazing deal. believe needs purchased trip one's home country (not available Japan) get low rate. really. running practice runs end end. no. Nope. said was, wasn‚Äôt enough evidence H2H transmission MOMENT. Yeah clouds short days. uncommon December winter like general....hence risk Vitamin deficiency easily enjoy country without knowing Japanese. English works cases. Society won‚Äôt distance long term effects meant, like beyond beyond unrealistic expect. Yeah 20 years ago indoor smoking/public places many states already banned. younger millennials take smoking much previous generations due hardcore youth campaigns smoking. That‚Äôs cult positivity crap don‚Äôt need. talking anything else Trump did, talking shutting travel China. know 400k people traveled China US time right? exactly point? failed, need get used figuring history find cases ineptitude. population density low, logistics staff many areas extremely limited. supply deliveries ramp big 3 cities (Toronto, Vancouver Montreal) getting vaccinated quickly. absolutely one first countries vaccinate majority population. I‚Äôd shocked worse 3rd world behind US UK Donating blood one quickest, helpful things Americans do, assuming eligible donate. Thank donating allow nationals come back also foreigners re-entrance permit. 2-weeks self quarantine mandated them. Everyone 16 whatever is. Also, suspect Venn Diagram ""people struggling mental health issues"" ""people who've lost faith assume virus win anyway"" circle. Yes, pre-COVID many times schools close due prevalence flu. common certain percentage student body class, day count ""in school"" day anyway. would made up, sustained days near threshhold would prompt closure limit spread wasted days.  mean, yeah, point become pointless. point starts cost society letting run rampant would. point certain percentage people infected certain percentage practicing noncompliance safety measures, becomes mathematically impossible contain.

The scary thing long term effects letting covid run wild astronomical: think much flu costs humanity annually. Billions, maybe trillions. much lost productivity, especially somewhere like US incredibly unhealthy work culture people expected come work even sick spread illness others. nah, that's honestly reason. much parallel world everything hoax. pray you‚Äôre right. California this, completely unenforced strong guidelines...

Maybe should... know, more?? meaningful impact people affected. mean, lot *""the internet""* telling stay home. top doctors scientists around world - know they're talking (the greater, global ""we"") would listen could months ago.  contained either way. Don‚Äôt believe Japan‚Äôs numbers. mechanisms behind spread influenza coronaviruses pretty much identical. They're enveloped upper respiratory tract pathogens. 

SARS-CoV-2 significantly infectious, that's really difference. efforts curb COVID basically prevented influenza outbreaks. definitely dangerous get sick quickly. Regardless, still preferable avoid vitamin deficiencies, especially considering correlation observed vitamin deficiency Covid severity. problem kind things capacity. built several field hospitals UK, staff - ITU already running stretched hospitals, spare staff. group shot givers one two better trained people case emergency. Kyoto might hard, JR Kyoto Hiroshima ~2hrs, need take ferry Miyajima think takes ~30min. going spend 5-6hrs transit trip. doable wake early get back late.

There handful ryokan Miyajima, I'd recommend making overnight trip it. way visit Itsukushima shrine one day hike mountain other. NC 37th list deaths per 100K state.

Interesting ranking makes NC shithole, NJ, NY, Mass, Conn, top 5, considered ""doing right"".

Hmmm, wonder difference far horrible states gives pass. 1.9 reported. Many actually given. Reporting lags. think it‚Äôs entirely possible places. talking world wide.

I see Fauci doubts thinks 85% need vaccinated. It‚Äôs Americans live way isn‚Äôt conducive stopping virus right now. unfortunately American-centric.

In many countries lower vaccine uptake, include mask wearing working home, get numbers place testing, isolating, quarantine... cautious stop spread.

I‚Äôm glad jury still think change public attitude main thing stopping us achieving it. needs change too.

Say 85% people think ‚Äòthat won‚Äôt happen bother‚Äô. Good. officials said disease contagious incubation period.

Is official said mask doesn‚Äôt work. 

Always watch do, listen say. 

The fact many government banning travel UK, concern. it‚Äôs old variant, bother increasing travel restrictions. dont lockdown fast food restaurants cola factories? Wouldnt save hundreds thousands lives?  us Japan people would calling Trump racist letting people country don‚Äôt hear softies tree people cry xenophobic. worried PC saving citizens. *Commodore Perry entered chat* Good edit! you‚Äôre saying he‚Äôs ever banned China? Isn‚Äôt different said banned Muslim countries? next good even perfect? Let‚Äôs speculate something positively.

Only needing one dose huge improvement can't believe internet memes lied [Suppose hit ""tyrannical governors"" oh boy... Major eye roll. Sorry people would actually take steps try stop disease spread save lives. People mindset restrictions ""tyrannical"" reason fucked. Memes masses. Bezos‚Äôs WaPo libs. Yep. day people saying online ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need mask socially distance‚Äù ‚Äúmasks don‚Äôt help‚Äù lies We'll definitely close 20m first week January still impressive pace. US can't close borders without world getting pissy screaming xenophobe. conveniently forget others. already home? There's pandemic going started ~10 months ago. earth Chicago? saying projection on? goal December 20m vaccinations administered. So, we're factor 10.

""Covid vaccine: U.S. vaccinated 1 million people 20 million December goal"" ... wish articles would make kind comparison would show much projected make pre-pandemic bull market while. 


It doesn‚Äôt explain people *should* lost money restaurants couple small businesses shut down. It‚Äôs presenting simplified view economics riding narrative upper middle class neighbors couple restaurants lost everything, Chinese maker smartphones businesses seeing gains did. Can‚Äôt create ground glass irregularities Camel Cool Menthol tumors. Oxford least approved. seems highly efficient preventing hospitalization. reduce cases lot make sure remaining cases less severe, key return ‚Äúnormality‚Äù CARES gives hospitals money uninsured patients actual Covid treatment, rehab. Honestly, think every nation world thing given point vaccine timeline at. Limiting number new infections herd immunity fastest path global recovery. move, Japan leg everyone else recovery takes hold. Open country. Stop closed. Wait im lost. racist stop people entering US pandemic Japan thing good? 

Dont get wrong agree every country shut travel immigration couple years till get sorted cant keep good bad reddit. idea every country world past 6 months now. I'm sorry, people die anything ""underlying condition."" Using ""underlying conditions"" dismiss covid deaths fucking ignorant. believe me, listen lot two words completely depends next week, lot states starting LTCF vaccination program Monday, start, people vaccinated skyrocket. Unlike certain east Asian country let spread much possible keep playing field fair. problem. Everyone seems excuse different. look celebrities politicians don‚Äôt listen rules telling others follow. I'm sorry what? offend you? tourists yes gradually reopening frontiers long term visas, students workers... know understood well, basically they're closing borders again. We're getting philosophical here, countries literally bound treaties. sovereign could choose otherwise.

You're focusing repatriation I'm talking commercial flights, normal commercial flights cancelled Australia New Zealand done so. Lol!!!! Yeah keep believing that. Conservatives continue block vote basic help struggling Americans inbred followers continue vote them. Can't help average American busy bending spreading cheeks Billionaires. wrong 

White skin originated place black people. fact, evil Dr. Yakub created white man laboratory. Oh, good! I‚Äôm glad know use ambulance get ER taxi, seeing medical services provide aren‚Äôt considered emergency services. I‚Äôll sure keep mind. :) point delaying flood pointless. flood entirely preventable, instead merely marginally delayed, bad worse due 9 months people spending last resources survivr ""Also, bought Xboxes bitcoins I'm mogul started YouTube channel learn tips like these, sheeple.""

 


Is Roger (my 18 year old nephew)? Roger, gave Squirtle doll yesterday Christmas, tell me. swear God Roger, take Squirtle doll right back store going hassle politics again. enough sass yesterday, child. one advocating science. contrary. news sources indicate new, infectious variant U.K. may cause children susceptible (and thus causing greater risk community spread) infection compared March‚Äôs variant. agree point that, prior introduction new variant, children likely aid community transmission. unbiased site WaPo help reinforce without robust evidence fact, ruling discussion school closures U.K., America, curb spread simply ignorant. Snake oil! Get snake oil! I've followed health departments guidelines. I've worn mask since March. seen friends since January. restaurant unnecessary shopping. Order things delivered curbside pickup can. I'm high horse. I'm suppose bunch cry babies ruining continuing spread shit forcing rest us remain stuck home. 1 ventilator person who's flying around country visiting family arnt suppose shouldnt get it. ""But risk take"" fuck life hangs balance bigger individuals time leaders took real action get control. Especially J&amp;J since require one shot. they're approved speed things massively. Good Point open eyes dude! Look LA right now. 2/3 city obeying anti-gathering orders, another 1/3 DGAF. hospital system brink collapse minority ppl still going partying meeting up. healthcare system designed accommodate many critically ill patients once. 

This tsunami covid patients means critically ill receive treatment. Cancer patients, car accident victims, stroke &amp; heart attack care delayed. ppl die, survive permanently disabled rest lives.

Maybe police state like China build special covid death wards send patients palliative hospice care recover own, die, minimal medical intervention. talking mortality rates would skyrocket past 20%. Western nation like US, acceptable. China too. also dicks. Marketplace though lol disagree blip thing.

This forever change view humanity. view pretty. gone pessimism full blown misanthropy. People forget act like never happened. plenty people posting videos spouting conspiracies never actually happen. Hell, doubt placed erect memorials dead. wonder people remember Spanish flu. Well we're gonna remember this. Tokugawa likes this. Calling people idiots telling excellent way bring side /s Great, KEEP GOING faster! Could Japan closed? sayonara tax money foreigners really depends Oxford J&amp;J do, get approved could easily see millions people vaccinated every day. First all, gone topic bringing Israel's treatment Palestinian people coronavirus sub.

Second all, said Hamas uses human shields see document made NATO
 give short version, ""Hamas' common¬†uses¬†of¬†human shields¬†include: ‚àé Firing rockets, artillery, mortars proximity heavily populated civilian areas, often near facilities protected according Geneva Convention (e.g. schools, hospitals, mosques).""

I'm talking terrorism cause Palestinians Gaza state trying spin Israel. Hamas terrorist organization using Palestinians order siphon money leaderships bank account living good life Qatar.
It also worth noting every strike Israel either calls cellphones civilians area warn incoming strike, use knocker bombs small bomb dropped target area people could flee actual bombing, also dropping fliers like 2014 warning leave certain neighborhoods. Israel actively minimizing civilian casualties.

And best tell people read comments know who's actually right who's wrong. analysis suggests number genetic variants associated immune escape emerged global populations Also depends law enforcement willing enforce anything. plenty sherrifs California saying enforce certain mandates rules. He's even incurring bills. article mentions he'll need nurse's aide going forward still fragile. guy going hit out-of-pocket max 2020 2021 add top whatever therapy rehab insurance cover. want even better results, look Australia New Zealand (especially New Zealand). Statistically, Japan Japan US, terms deaths...

The interesting thing think countries relatively close USA terms overall culture politics, whereas Japan excused exotic ""foreign"" culture things ""differently"".

Actually, Japan done relatively little, culture mask wearing hand disinfection worked favour. Australia NZ went hardcore lockdown, people complied, cases extremely low. NZ basically eliminated it, Australia close, despite recent uptick, numbers count single double digits, vs hundreds thousands like US. Put differently, 1 every 1000 Americans dead disease. Statistically speaking, everyone country know least one person personally died one degree separation.

And STILL millions people saying hoax, spouting conspiracy bullshit. ambulance mobile emergency room, aside minor conditions, EMS treat patients. whole point stabilize, transport. patients need stabilization, need less, goalie ultimately get ER, definitely that. ""Americans stupid, selfish, inconvenienced even kills them"" FTFY partner frontline nurse tells similar story. sounds horrific.

Honestly think people focusing death rate far stupid understand chronic effects anyway‚Äîthey‚Äôre busy loudly *wondering* people making big deal virus whose case fatality rate ‚Äúonly‚Äù order 1%. there‚Äôs nothing unusual scary rolling 100-sided die it‚Äôs 1 get blow brains out. Oh look, moderator leaves up. Totally cool. American's proven important freedom right stupid. kill right.  Doesn‚Äôt matter. We‚Äôre past point return. country thoroughly fucked I‚Äôm shocked people completely unaware. So...

Week 1: 500k

Week 2: 1,500k

The second dosing coming week 4 gonna add another challenge, like pace. OP cops military policing state borders quarantine Australia yet many countries lock quickly either become serious issue. fact many countries struggling get people wear masks stay home reason whole thing lasted long. Yes, China hand initial spread country citizens responsible acted fact we're nearly year clear end take couple weeks reported numbers line real time, especially major holidays time year. still think 20m end year won‚Äôt happen we‚Äôll closer lot people saying. pace ramping reported numbers still lagging actual vaccinations. Japan 2: Shogunate boogaloo probably murdered someone. Well University Washington new candidate works may provide strong immunity low chance allergy Thanks insight!

It's interesting see completely opposite way seems handled.

Here, official guidelines seem meant absolute ceiling possible response. (not all) people much, demanded. Always looking loop holes such. ALICE BORDERLAND??? Every country think people still saying big deal point even capable understanding - truly think they're dumb get I've got personal experience this: mom.

She is/was ""it's flu,"" ""it's bullshit"" person 39 year old diabetic friend almost died hospital ""she's believes it."" happened around May June. Fast forward last Sunday, one grandfathers die it. get call Christmas saying ""oh died heart attack. think worried wife handle it.""

Any chance get minimize virus does, take fits world view. care anymore, I've tried tried get others family way matter. care anymore. years pandemic US response nice case study react pandemic. don‚Äôt even miss it. Instead minimizing festivities, expand different direction. 

- Even guest list small, like members household/bubble, still make celebration good, actually even better since budget per person larger. get fancy takeout restaurant meal everyone since aren‚Äôt feeding many people. could go decorations gifts, etc.
- Plus, many ideas virtual events still want get whole family involved. People could done virtual gift openings, games, movies, dinners. Simply searching ‚Äúvirtual Christmas ideas‚Äù Google would enough info throw online celebration year. Yes.

And every country ability emergency approve vaccine without need EU. Gosh must nice live country cares citizens. won‚Äôt allow there. racists country is. Exactly! Hospitalization Death major issues COVID. trying sound like smart weeb saw url say .jp clicked like ""uhh"" thanks lol You‚Äôve explained way much context situational awareness post. go sub‚Äôs infatuation ‚Äúbut things exactly like _______, we‚Äôd better off.‚Äù Scandinavians seem love dairy products. smoke resin protect lungs virus? Argentina government pushing shady Russian vaccine government approved without looking evidence works. hurt lol? Truly don‚Äôt understand ur logic bud. lefties cancel trump banning travel one country, surely internally raging Japan‚Äôs decisions ban countries. That‚Äôs like unspeakable racism book. One country painfully racist them, man must shaking pain right No, try donate money Navajo Nation whenever study done done working age people Tokyo. probably higher people could isolate better, still went 4% 50% months. already spread. Ppl already infected. can't believe still explain long. must American. Royal College Midwives noted two midwives required away maternity unit home birth, would times pandemic would possible.

That's pretty neat service provide first place. understand may able provide time right fear mongering, though. aren‚Äôt going 300k active cases end weekend‚Äî250k presumed recovered.

The headline extremely misleading makes seem like 300k active cases weekend even remotely true. BBC report broadcast 4 days ago, relates alleged coronavirus outbreak Yunnan 2012. Jesus Christ. We‚Äôre saying goddamn thing keep trying argue me.

A two week lockdown option.
Two week lockdown whole comment thread about. Bringing NZ it, 4 week lockdown extremely early, agrees point 2 week lockdown enough/won‚Äôt work.

Yes, strict quarantine border control extended strict lockdown clearly option (however unlikely either implemented). know right. place get dried squid snack junk food morning rushing work need something stat thing THANK YOU. Also suprised downvoted salty americans europeans lmao Lmao could say puppet first government, definitely now. He's putting face line anyone else right now. google cache article: wondering misread apparently didn't... Perhaps stop refusing help score political Exactly putting others lives risk. know medical conditions may prevent shape like others consideration. Obesity disease caused eating much. right thing do. I've supposed living Japan since March 2020. Fuck virus. keep trying tell people think Japan somehow terrific job keeping things control. compared neighboring countries, poorly. Compared island nations (outside GB, cause they're special kind dumb like US), incredibly poorly. low numbers cases deaths, PCR tests still heavily restricted compared countries, Many hospitals even reporting coronavirus infections, many deaths due coronavirus adjacent illnesses pneumonia, stroke, heart failure counted towards coronavirus deaths. much Japan fantastic job preventing deaths infections much incredibly poor job reporting what's actually going here. bit running joke whenever cases reported town area, add end, get accurate number. odd reporting nation wide infections numbers lower many global cities, yet running incredibly low hospital space medical staff, like every country lost control virus, country ICU beds per capita. 

The real response due actions residents, even plenty properly social distance, refuse protect others wearing mask, live life pandemic going on. mention stigma coming corona virus makes people hide/deny symptoms long possible, refuse get diagnosed treated. still co-workers students come despite dealing heavy cold symptoms even running fever. 

This current borber lockdown even apply citizens, likely go track virus ""we can't cancel business trip England, despite access zoom technologies Japanese companies touch ten foot pole. Can't helped jazz"". Meanwhile 14 day quarantine returnees even enforced, much like every government effort control virus. moment UK stain announced here, figured going matter time end getting infected, guarantee even counted whatever number Japan decides report. businesses hit smaller areas, actually, big cities afraid getting nailed start with. Flint couple shut licensing pulled, north getting hit rate one business day. state coronavirus website reports it. Yes, areas enforce others, that's expected. even break government meetings breaking protocol made news several times. ‚Äúnon sterilizing immunity‚Äù thing really speculation bunch downers, dooomers, antisocials, antivaxxers. There‚Äôs evidence whatsoever existing indicate fail prevent asymptomatic infections.

It‚Äôs ‚Äúthey haven‚Äôt proved it‚Äôs true‚Äù talk.

The vaccine companies also didn‚Äôt check trials goblin bed eating dust bunnies, doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs reason believe thing would true. argument people would ‚Äúhave it‚Äù fines penalties incentive maybe state certainly mine even majority United States. keep trying tell you, reality. Numbers looking good neck woods, new cases trending word everything. I‚Äôm worried weeks back surge. Every Western country told people wear masks washing hands enough. Thanksgiving surge still show case numbers? china stop virologists scientific community?

Yes, see NYT: ""What team members know would allowed investigate source all. Despite Dr. Ryan‚Äôs pronouncements, advice emergency committee, organization‚Äôs leadership quietly negotiated terms sidelined experts. would question China‚Äôs initial response even visit live-animal market city Wuhan outbreak seemed originated."" sharpest piece UK 2020 brexit?

BBC Panorama broadcast programme highly critical government's Brexit plans. See .What Xinhua's sharpest piece Xinjiang labour camps 2020? Lockdowns. We‚Äôre going locked one dies ever again. LMFAO misinformation you‚Äôve fed cringy. good, take hour day little research history still think she‚Äôs good fit VP, illogical train thought. evidence there, free btw, gotta look. Don‚Äôt rely mainstream media info really depend J&amp;J Astrazeneca approval point. even one is/are approved, April basically given. Would likely help stopped firing rockets border too. even try suppress zero, Australia New Zealand did. stopped half-ways bit arse. Germany, too. would easy Germany summer months. Yeah real , imagine meltdown would happen that? post says 2012. watch video, page says posted four days ago heading next month.

If happened recently, I'm glad blocked. They're reporters likely proper hazmat/protective gear.

Does anyone want people accidentally become infected different novel SARS virus could spread around world given current events? Yeah, called lying bc proof. heard air bags US Europe positioned differently unsafe car manufacturers assume Americans wearing seatbelts. Nice. many doses Germany recieve? True continue save life healthcare personal obligation. medicine one person available one got going doctor going eat bars ni brainier gets medical attention. would **need** travel justify potential spread disease.

And herein lies problem. defines sufficient ""need"" is?

Is Reddit? government? health experts? individual? doesn‚Äôt change fact schools open still significant transmission situation vital service young children especially priority many situations

The UK REACT study cited elsewhere page showing contrary. also systematic study topic. UK really combines best science worst political responses. world sphere, thought you‚Äôd like know. don‚Äôt understand comment Anything better what? Many people get two doses. cancelled visas? Speaking gaslighting months lockdowns? I'm really sure able get every day adult society think common. way? Yeah, thanks, want hear people... Lots elderly vulnerable people way since March! Trust me, I'm one certainly suddenly going back normal I've vaccine. That's works!  No, become level stupid without brainwashed mountain shitty chump beliefs. Hence Trump 2.0 fend another 4 years.

In southern areas like North Carolina masses knuckle-dragging fox news watchers tell never get vaccinated vaccine ""made dead babies.""

I exaggerating, all. listen people speak honest thoughts, realize world going fucked get together take leadership away America. Ohh okay, kind puts wheelhouse then.

Well here's hoping sooner guys, least months difference! spoke mandates. literally never said whether believed people would wear not. Never said good lol, better politician actually knows politics orange tv chetto wears diapers Yep, purchase home. fedex you. need show upon arrival you‚Äôll get official pass. afraid travel I‚Äôm 25 years old 99% likely suffer Covid? Especially since wear mask little contact people outside home? option *after extended strict lock down.* Swedish solution. tried. resounding success, particularly recently.

A live let die approach considered several countries. understood consequences decided it, even Sweden.

As protecting vulnerable, turns really difficult. virus habit creeping in.

I understand point, two solutions proven work: social distancing (including lockdowns need be) vaccins Bruh foreign citizens literally still allowed entry citizens. There's preference going on. protecting nation. country damn thing. actually don‚Äôt think UK, parts Europe, USA actually psychological capacity actually necessary 

That's inverse racism. Finland, New Zealand, Australia, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam it, can, too. humans. spend much time sub. rotting brain making irrationally angry.

Turn internet go nice walk. problem Japan exemptions first time caused many people stranded. amended international outcry guarantee again. Welcome Ohio, governor starts every news conference talking bad it‚Äôs getting. proceeds tell us essentially: ‚Äúyou‚Äôre adults please listen stay inside, I‚Äôm going mandate anything you‚Äôre adults. Yes getting bad, listen stay inside you‚Äôll fine. please start listening... please..? Oh well, still gonna mandate anything‚Äù.

Our current mandated curfew. Yes *Mandated* curfew, also says it‚Äôs ok curfew picking food it‚Äôs necessity. talking things rationed. agree. one ambulance two calls, one wearing seatbelt not. Treat seat belt person first. Sure *laughs Tennessee* What, 2/3 Americans get flu shot? Straw man slayer! Visit linked subreddit risk. may high amount misinformation.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* really isn‚Äôt true. trajectory pandemic didn‚Äôt actually change around thanksgiving. look line graph 7 day moving average smooth curve peak around last week/week last. must every non-American article one you? Beyond exhausting. stick r/CoronavirusUS, please. Yeah exactly. IMO April decent estimate, May relatively pessimistic, late Feb/March optimistic ""if everything goes perfectly"" timelines.

The idea general public able get vaccinated June/July makes sense consider fact almost every single spare dollar developed world going directed toward fast vaccinations. I‚Äôm US citizen. I‚Äôm NL resident Norway. purchasing agreements European Union quite limited deliveries Q1 end Q2 2021 enough deliveries people bottom priority list vaccinated. know EU managed order 100 million doses Pfizer vaccine hopefully speed things up. ""the number deaths november *adjusted per population* high 10 years that's still nothing compared peak April. thought Sweden would second wave thanks herd immunity totally wrong admit it."" called trying protect citizens. country closed borders multiracial country. Stop ignorant. no, don‚Äôt know reliable either immunity longitudinal be. experts differing opinions, medical scientific recommendations. Saying ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt reason‚Äù discounting reality 300 million people going wear mask 200 cases day. Mandate mandate. government ever lessened control people.

The good thing absolutes one counter-example takes prove false. counter-example: prohibition US. Man eat much fish even bother cooking half time. Yeah no. stuff eat caught pacific stock. let get picture you. salmon fish lived Pacific Ocean. Caught fisherman pacific. Eaten Pacific Northwest. somehow comforting know get royaled forked once. lol users protecting China? course. Nobody calling racist. It‚Äôs smart thing do. Trump shut borders chose single China. stupid idea. I'm antitrumper, ""hesitancy"". complying doesn‚Äôt know hospitals dealing with

Everyone knows, seen it. visual powerful. Kinda like disgusting photos packs cigarette. effective reducing smoking. sub comical. guy says can‚Äôt call entire country people morally corrupt one gets downvoted response saying yes generalize 300 million people gets upvoted. Hysterical. Durham resident here, Toronto lock down. local traffic insane. easy 30min highway drive Toronto. local mall packed parking lots last three weeks. can't lock Toronto without locking neighbor municipality's. Toronto center universe dammed can't shop. time officially reach herd immunity, almost one following remaining mask rules. give summer mass compliance stop. Time tell i'm crazy ahead curve. hope i'm crazy we'll see next year. think balance may key . Understanding pandemic severely altered life - keeping aware luxury vs necessity. many must understand luxury refuse postpone may source loss joys come without choice . Stay safe . Australia NZ closed since March. I'm actually kinda surprised countries still open (especially to, offence, western Europeans Americans)? seatbelt saved life, therefore, won‚Äôt use one? Likely double vitamin deficiency, vitamin commonly included milk, factor virus hits hard.

This shown. causation might opposite (you become vitamin deficient get really sick). How's solo traveller? someone Japanese History's! exist, AstraZeneca trial combination vaccine together Gamaleya institute? Sounds like American lives cheaper Japanese lives /s Point trust data anywhere done japan start, people would impeached trump. period.  got less delusional Olympics, responded quickly. 

I would even argue mostly response common people, shops bussinesses great strict rather government itself. 



Source : Living Japan right now.  one can‚Äôt die animals still spread people. That‚Äôs reason flu always around, even stop people getting it. already closed borders since July? friend mine wanted visit Japan end October, exact reason.

And seen someone mentioning went Japan Christmas Holiday. Strange. Gosh dang plane tickets bought Jan 12th visa app already started! irrational view black &amp; white. government sometimes run bad people lie (like departing administration well documented). consider Trump ""The Government"" consider Democrats ""The Government""? certainly can't claim Americans one thing Americans seriously divided. brushing everyone fat brush define terms. bizarre all. Asian African countries largely took necessary societal steps slow even stop spread.

Meanwhile west mostly decided much inconvenience us. brought false information. I'm putting place. 

Let fix again, fact Israel charge Palestinians Hamas get billions foreign aid Arab League specifically Iran Qatar. Let add fact Hamas spend dime vaccinations budget spent tunnels sometimes built inside Palestinian homes rockets used attack Israeli civilians.

It's fact Hamas uses human shields like putting equipment inside civilian buildings like seen 2014. light unto nations. Not.

Also fact Israel helps numerous African countries advanced agricultural technology help starvation poverty. 

Also Palestinians indigenous Arabian peninsula Judea (Palestine) ‚Äúthe point ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù N weeks second shot‚Äù

And actually isn‚Äôt even really accurate either. look Kaplan-Meier curves Pfizer Moderna vaccines, vaccine placebo groups clear diverge day 10 first shot. Neither phase 3 study included single-shot arm trial, clearly strong protective effect 10-14 days, second shot even administered. Getting second boost dose likely important increasing long-term duration immunity though. Source? finished used food again?  Focused approach, meaning protect vulnerable. seat belt save motorway may prevent maneuvering parking lot. Young? Probably least one comorbities üò≥ would likely case case basis. Contacting State department (not sure called Japan) talking border service arrive. clearly explain address job Japan proper documentations like work visa business contact, I'm sure would fine. initial officer speak budge, get one higher up. article law may blanket ban non-citizens everything done entry point's discretion. believe you. generalizing thing getting annoying. mom's even boomer, grew without seatbelts forgets put one gets neighborhood. Thank God beeping. ‚ÄúMost problematic people using ""mental health"" fig leaf cover fact they're entitled selfish.‚Äù broad sweeping statement, source that? I‚Äôve seen problematic people lean ‚Äúmuh freedom/rights!‚Äù Back comment, never advocated validating bad choices, saying condescending people struggling mentally isn‚Äôt helping terms getting cooperate. ‚ÄúUsing mental health excuse‚Äù - lol. know what, go ahead, tell they‚Äôre selfish liars said, they‚Äôre making excuses, ‚Äúgo outside walk like rest us‚Äù - see far that‚Äôll get you, don‚Äôt sympathy them, give shit return? Thank much kind Redditor. Best wishes well. üòò know would help get transcript podcast maybe bullet points - don‚Äôt time. elderly definitely need vaccine people work need seeing may higher chance infecting people seeing tend see people.

The reason Desantis prioritizing elderly probably political compassionate.  that. actually saying something instead whining prior assumptions meant? say that..... Melbourne fucked right up. Lmao entire comments section mentally ill circle jerk Trump closed borders people said racist protested hugging people San fransisco China town LOL.

he also operation warp speed right try surely helped expect numbers hit waves they‚Äôre hitting 80% population immunized vaccines natural immunity time next year. 30% patients hospitalized 40 there‚Äôs 20% population left infect, justify measures all? no, closing school equitable mask mandate. argument micro kind real universal thing states cities do. 

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre living reality. lost get getting vaccine database ready? seems ridiculous considering lead time vaccine.

Also surely health service database place existing vaccines? dont really understand it. actually arrange liaison ‚Äúbusiness exemptions‚Äù work colleagues. say plane isn‚Äôt empty, it‚Äôs got fair number people flight, less flight Japan before. high profile participants tournament receive testing? think recognize large scale efforts like always issues. long small huge issue aside individual personal impact (which care government level statistics kwim). advocate process improvements know problems bc that's nature situations outside norms operation. Stop trying redefine words. Disease death fact life that's never going away (probably). free barricade house want. expect others follow suit. time traveler.
It Fort Detrick invention time travel.
Trump still president present. 70 years now. Notice beautiful trend least scientific literate people screaming ""trust science"" loudly? irony amazing. Yeah people legitimate concerns simply scientific knowledge fully understand it. important educate treat like idiots.

But hardcore anti-vax group say even 10 years now. Nothing honestly. Luckily probably 5-10% ok even still huge number. Well kind rely US military... point made never implementation details - course it‚Äôs technically possible physically prevent entry anyone. However, [right one basic tenets citizenship principle - cannot return country citizenship time, really citizen? Genetics (or whatever, epigenetics) culture makes difference comorbidities sure. see 50% Japan obese like US? see D3 deficient? could mirror US public policy Japan never see even 10% US deaths. 

For example: matter terms treatment public health, US \_never\_ equal absolute shit lifestyle (probably) worse genetics also. 

I'll say more. Show single East Asian majority country piles bodies covid piling up. exist. Why? know sure, \_NOT\_ public policy alone. need federal plan, 50 different state plans. That, unfortunately, happened whole time. really need see next administration shit together hang next 3.5 weeks. That's wild! I‚Äôve house years"
