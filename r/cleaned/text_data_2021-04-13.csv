0,2021-04-13," Interestingly though, I'd believe one. Clearly Pfizer influence American politicians. recently mostly Astrazeneca, Pfizer well, though decided Astrazeneca vaccine offered 30. Moderns vaccine starting rolled out. 

Most 60% Astrazeneca vaccine. safe assume someone got sick fever body aches vaccine (j&amp;j), covid would‚Äôve done way damage?

My brother got vax, really bold thinking he‚Äôd get covid fine. feel bad cuz right he‚Äôs riding fever first shot Moderna coursing veins. drug store, School Pharmacy university.

While efficacies similar, heard Moderna recipients prone side-effects, especially second dose. hey, I'm complaining. Stoked received either one. ‚ÄúDID SAY PANIC!?‚Äù - Morons fair, Pfizer got best publicity since started. Even allergic reactions like news story day never spoke again. Bruh took shit wtf They're allowed sub reason. Appreciate it! think could quit job magically remove stress life like 6 months, might actually chance turning things around. mind open trying nearly anything point, need time. immune reaction vaccine. first dose adverse immune reaction, would unlikely happen second dose? much I've read, saying unlikely, since yet 100% clear causes cases blood clots seems nobody really knows that. rather take chances covid getting blood clot

what perfect example risk bias random itch, think. It‚Äôs itchy-itchy, I‚Äôm telling you: try touch arm reason. Lol. 1 5 good performance. Texas ranks pretty near bottom fully vaccinated progress. fact they're lowest performing sizeable state relatively tiny states ranked lower.

That said, they're badly infection rate. massive reopening surge yet show. hang another month two may pull confound detractors. absolutely right. Operation Warp Speed proving huge success vaccine rollout US happened Trump administration. voted Biden afraid successes previous administration benefitting from. aunt option sign AZ, called ‚Äúblood clot bottle‚Äù says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait good one‚Äù. eyes - go back line. get Pfizer shot 16 year olds do. 

Just infect isolate 14 days... never said lipid copy. said assumed mRNA code copy. Seeing actually anything better ""make prefusion spike protein yet"", code anyone look at, hard speculate would changed it. Uhh makes feel better. probably correct, although us due slowness European bureaucracy. countries tried act earlier, taken Brussels slowed things weeks. 

But Europe isnt bad think, everyone first shot June. Note also Europe still major exporter vaccins, unlike US. Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna Covid-19 vaccines mRNA based. Wait.... Pfizer going export rest world?  Many Chinese people transit Singapore avoid 14-day quarantine first, Aren‚Äôt also hiking prices too? Dreidels\* give females priority Moderna/Pfizer vaccines males take spots J&amp;J vaccines, discrimination? hi. test result?

wondering cause I'm getting 2nd shot soon worried there's good chance catching covid fully vaccinated.. crowd wear mask? thanks advance. felt like flu shot me, flu shots fairly small needles that‚Äôs right? sore arm next days real though. polite thing wait neighbors fellow shoppers also get vaccinated, antivaxxers feel desire stop wearing masks get chance.

For personally, looks like [1-2 weeks first lot sources put chance still life-alerting covid symptoms months later somewhere around 30%, even though young healthy. Sure, body might treat like cold, might end hospital, might symptoms months months, might kill you. chances way higher catch covid get vaccine. EU vaccines failed europes got awful numbers. 
Screwed response end. EU can't anything itself. 

It's achievement UK spacing vaccinations much longer (12 weeks shots), 3-month backlog people one shot given moment. even decent level protection, get 2nd shot sure. NHS GP network much better set invite remind people CVS. look numbers, Canada hitting highest number far pandemic, they're probably right blaming Canada. understanding incorrect.

Also Europe isnt actually far behind. USA ready first shots late May, Europe late June. However Europe isnt blocking vaccin exports, reasonable achievement probably ask doctor often anosmia spontaneously resolves year. I‚Äôd wager symptoms last long often lifelong. pretty bad hearing rely reading lips help. can't wait day put masks away forget them.

Though honestly they've really nice allergies. Maybe I'll leave out. I'm arguing USA going pull earlier Europeans, absolutely are, they've still taken serious losses strategy. got mine yesterday. slightly tired otherwise fine. husband two days second. Americans. Nothing send, produced USA. ""When get Israel now"" likely answer.

Figuring exactly Israel little tricky though. appear fully reopen (?) R~0.7 (simple worldmeters calc) something like 57% population fully vaccinated. latter number promisingly low, although fully reopened (likely) could still needed prevent fall outbreaks.  FlU tHoUgH! Europe 6 weeks behind exporting countries Canada. bad achievement imho many people / died without vaccine god damn nothing burger. Get back giving people shots. You‚Äôre already higher immunity J&amp;J vaccine. reason aren‚Äôt free.  I'll go no. risk. entire world needs vaccine get time soon. something like occurs results people rejecting vaccines, billions arms waiting. Ultimately part solution. long vaccines go arms trash, risk. rearrangement become risk fraction.

People make decisions. decisions consequences. carelessly got covid anyways, she‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù. üôÑ economies size. 

Is EU tried haggle $10 vaccine. Lol typical It's18-50, half American women overweight. women getting blood clots necessarily ones find bangable, zero risk covid either. Sorry spoil reddit's chivalrous antivax fantasy. Ugh. wanna get ride. USA exporting exactly zero vaccins. So, yes, huge reduction Canada already getting. /s

The point US surplus getting closer however Dat Variant None explains current surge. Indians stopped social distancing long time ago since impossible here. probably new variant that's driving wave. Interesting almost everyone know mild effects j&amp;j got completely pummeled dose 2 phizer moderna

I got j&amp;j yesterday little tired feverish today thats population, yes.  Yeah said treating clots heparin actually make things worse requires specialized treatment. side effects first Moderna shot sucked, wife side effects Pfizer shot. I'm looking forward second Moderna shot April 28th. It‚Äôs completely understandable there‚Äôs distrust hyped. told completely safe, anyone worried it‚Äôs new dangerous conspiracy theorist. Fast forward people pretty much vindicated, clearly didn‚Äôt know everything this. Who‚Äôs say another month, year whatever period time something else doesn‚Äôt pop DNA vaccines prompt body make mRNA via transcription (the extra step you‚Äôre thinking of) yet approved humans. showing promise research advancing quickly vaccines use killed/ weakened versions entire viruses pieces proteins them, DNA. It‚Äôs different mechanism body produce proteins, DNA mRNA vaccines do. That's terrible. hope comes GDP entire European Union 2019: $19.9 trillion USD

GDP USA 2019: $20.5 trillion USD

Raw buying power pretty comparable also need consider vaccines manufactured. appears Pfizer manufacturers lot trouble Belgium facilities. Also linked birth control right? America go brrrrrrrr I've seen interesting thing Colorado vaccinate: CFR dropped factor least 3, hospitalization rate remains constant (hospitalizations/cases remains 4-5%). appears though younger people ~2% chance needing hospitalization older people. seem likely partial vaccination deaths would rise quickly past, hospitalizations still would rise pretty quickly.

What's unknown whether younger people bad outcomes hospital care unavailable. That's entirely correct. least distill point getting to.

I tried come real example, know going write going less confusing anyone else thread written. Further, math person, difficult enough try conceptualize numbers, without put description somebody else make sense of.

So, simplest video find: one gets math bit TLDR; important 95% fewer infections occur... *~200 million* vaccinated people, somehow still managed get infected, deaths hospitalizations caused COVID like hundreds. turns potential death sentence chronic illness (""long covid"") ""have chicken soup take nap."" gotta work arm more. 3 days ridiculous. Thanks. followup phase 3 COVE study group. say press release, COVE group 30,000 participants, believe 50/50 vaccine vs placebo, 15,000 placebo 15,000 vaccinated people original study. 

It's 100% clear press release, read it, entire 30k group (not vaccinated 15k) 900 cases since then, including 100 severe cases. That's muddied fact since placebo group also offered shots 98% got them, point basically whole 30k vaccinated, clear portion 900/100 cases happened vaccination, 1 shot, immediately second shot full effect reached.

The way read cases unvaccinated participants, get ~90% effectiveness numbers. Roughly 900 30,000 got sick, 810/15000 unvaccinated group 90/15000 vaccinated group, something along lines. Get sweet sweet goodness Canada!  Oh man sounds rough. Im really sorry hear although sounds like didnt kill made stronger ways. Hate say im always bad saying good things.

Published Tuesday JAMA Pediatrics, study said ‚Äúmost MIS-C illnesses believed result asymptomatic mild Covid-19‚Äù followed hyper-inflammatory response appears occur patients‚Äô bodies produced maximum level antibodies virus. Experts yet know young people, smaller number respond way.

‚ÄúIt means primary-care pediatricians need high index suspicion Covid prevalent society children often asymptomatic disease initial Covid infection,‚Äù said Dr. Jennifer Blumenthal, pediatric intensivist pediatric infectious disease specialist Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital, involved study.

 researchers evaluated 1,733 2,090 cases syndrome people age 20 younger reported C.D.C. January. 

The findings show although syndrome rare, C.D.C‚Äôs data included patients hospitalized. 90 percent young people experienced symptoms involving least four organ systems 58 percent needed treatment intensive care units.

Many experienced significant heart issues: half developed low blood pressure, 37 percent developed cardiogenic shock 31 percent experienced cardiac dysfunction involving heart‚Äôs inability pump adequately. study said significantly higher percentage patients Covid-19 symptoms experienced heart problems, compared initial coronavirus symptoms. greater percentage initially asymptomatic patients also ended intensive care.

‚ÄúEven kids severe MIS-C, I.C.U. ‚Äî vast majority preceding illness recognized,‚Äù said Dr. Roberta DeBiasi, chief infectious diseases Children‚Äôs National Hospital Washington, D.C., involved research.

The study provided detailed demographic geographic picture syndrome date. 34 percent patients Black 37 percent Hispanic, reflecting way coronavirus disproportionately affected members communities. pandemic went on, authors wrote, proportion patients white increased, comprising 20 percent cases. People Asian heritage comprised 1 percent patients.

 Overall, nearly 58 percent patients male, proportion across ages. youngest group ‚Äî newborn age 4 ‚Äî roughly equal numbers boys girls, male-to-female ratio increased older groups two-to-one male female 18-to-20 group. 

The vast majority patients (nearly 86 percent) younger 15. study found 5 lowest risk serious heart complications less likely need intensive care. Patients 10 older significantly likely develop issues like shock, low blood pressure myocarditis (inflammation heart muscle).

‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs similar saw Covid, older kids seemed severe disease,‚Äù Dr. DeBiasi said. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs makes people really sick Covid inflammatory aspect it, maybe older kids, whatever reasons, make inflammation, whether that‚Äôs primary Covid MIS-C.‚Äù

Still, significant numbers youngest patients developed heart problems. newborn-to-4 age group, 36 percent low blood pressure, 25 percent shock 44 percent treated I.C.U.

Patients ages study occurrence less-common heart issues linked syndrome, including coronary aneurysms fluid buildup. Children 14 likely rash red eyes, older 14 likely chest pain, shortness breath cough. Abdominal pain vomiting afflicted two-thirds patients.

But I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll fine. 48 hours rough though. like flu. India fully open since September least. India crowded. Brazil favelas nothing Indian slums. yet seems even incidence yet unclear, assertions second dose incredibly risky given people, especially young people, one. unvaccinated people dont effect vaccinated people. failing take account people catch coronavirus build immunity contributes towards herd immunity we're ultimately striving for. Instances reinfection extremely rare. I'd also pretty selfish think something like ""everyone get vaccinated feel safe concert."" dont feel safe go. choice all. maths Astrazeneca, never heard J&amp;J (we're UK, AFAIK J&amp;J) purely Zeneca numbers, overall think blown proportion. Focus arm pain feeling rough 48hrs afterwards. believe UK logic risk CVST higher 30s, risk serious illness covid lower 30s. 

As per graphics above, vaccine still favourable 30s low prevalence scenario, justification comes from. Many countries used Sinovac Sinopharm clinical trials approving use (eg. UAE, Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, etc) CVST (the rare clots brain talking about) incidence increases factor 8x amongst women birth control. yes, efficient setup old sears location mall. far I've heard Pfizer vaccines it.

That‚Äôs far likely,‚Äù added ‚ÄúSquawk Street,‚Äù citing data industry group Thrombosis Canada.

This key thing, I've seen said sub several times past day. think factor odds catching covid first place equation well - let's say 100 1 get blood clot covid, thousand 1 catch covid first place assuming ever leave house. still leaves 100,000 1, ten fold higher risk getting vaccine, there's obviously fact blood clots adverse effect covid, could kinds dangerous shit happen you.

I think disconnect risks calculated policy makers, risks individual perspective. individual, understand risk adenovirus vaccines still low, also alternatives available without known risk wait little bit. personal calculation comparing risk catching dying Covid. Firstly, young person risk dying low, somewhat comparable risks JJ AZ vaccines. multiplies risk catching virus risk Covid much lower. Then, power control personal behaviour lower risk contracting covid even statistical average. driving. freak accidents, also control driving behaviour make risk crashing dieing lower statistical average. considering risks personal perspective seems logical wait safer alternative position. 

However, also understand society need end pandemic soon possible. wait two months mRNA vaccine, many lives personally save? could also achieve result monitoring personal behaviour catch spread virus next two months. run ahead get vaccine, essentially \~ 1 600 000 young people end martyrs society.

Sorry europoor ""america bad"" falling apart. way Japan, population 126.2M, seroprevalence 46.8% total deaths 9,425. Either tests inaccurate statistical analysis applied sample wrong. think disaster Manaus, researchers would lot critical seroprevalence estimates. couple notes here:

1. J&amp;J decided halt shipments vaccines EU countries recommendation pause US announced. EU pleased seeking explanation. 

2. affects contracts 2022 onward. Currently concluded contracts viral-vector vaccines AstraZeneca Johnson Johnson remain force. Ordering probably would made difference. Building new production probably would though... That's fine change job every 6 months increase income Tbh Islam taken science seriously past 1400 years. lot science today also found Quran. example, look website explains miracles scientifically. Seems Istanbul thing. heard Istanbul one obeying restrictions, police go around weekends make sure one outside. Really weird inconsistency there.

During weekend allowed go get groceries like 5 PM though, people abuse that, streets definitely lot less busy time lockdown. museums decided close, closed municipalities them, reopened despite rising case numbers open along. It‚Äôs situation regarding cinemas, theatres, libraries community/cultural houses. Curevac even already fridge temperature mRNA vaccine undergoing Phase 3 trials. Well reddit. good know yall care. 
No one anything need. 
Turns something need. 
Cope Good. That‚Äôs felt COVID-19, I‚Äôm fairly young (30‚Äôs) healthy still scared horror stories. ended cold-like symptoms cleared quickly, everyone different. also possible issue wide spread 6 noticed. Possible lots clot cases blamed birth control etc. 

We know. one likes morons lmao need shady cover up, need less tabloid approach.

I see anyone kicking flu vaccines curb Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome, even though risk twice high clotting issue AZ J&amp;J vaccines. Bad advice. Secrecy bad. Doctors NEED know whats going treat people. Doctors also people, sign nda's reveal vaccines may kill people. 


So plan A: email blast FDA every practicing doc usa look this, treat way, ask patients jj vaccine without telling why, expect info leak out. 

B: Tell noone, noone aware. Now, cases find out. People know look. gets worse, people know respond. way worse looks initially, lots lots people die. 

And leaks. Becuase always leaks, deal anyway. 

Which two sounds good you? Disneyland would never ban children parks lol given second dose 7+ million people blood clots? nr shots J&amp;J vaccine 6 cases already reported nr. Dealing right now. Got second pfizer 15 hours ago. feeling hot moment. Unfortunately, cannot. Lest forget it‚Äôs week plus since head China-friendly calling thorough investigation ‚Äúconspiracy theory.‚Äù Good. Seems like best vaccines Moderna Pfizer anyways! provide source information immune reaction much likely occur second shot? sports fan: really preferred games called off. Olympic games happening outside regular calendar (which disrupts preparations qualifications), certain nations athletes excluded, and, all, public international public, make much less interesting before. think going impact transmissions, understand insistence Japan hosting games can't give profit.

They agreed IOC host next games, next games undecided hosts instead compensation. sucks sometimes short term. People die. system critical long term build society medical system worth having. 

How many people would die legitimate fears vaccines killing people? many every year forever? 

If flu vaccine saved 500 lives killed one, thats ok math front. people would afraid. take it. Rational people would anti Vax. 

Besides, doctors. harm. follow logic Moderna... Moderna part project warp speed US right reap rewards. 

You correct Biontech/Pfizer story different. Pfizer EU company source delays EU, collaboration maybe EU company. ultimately Pfizer probably good partner...even Europe 

""Turkish immigrant""

What Turkish heritage founders Biontech anything?  hooking friends family. 

The German government invested hundreds millions euros development vaccine.... understand. would expect kind advantage invested significantly research development production vaccine. Distance key. outside vs inside. Unless believe placing walls around 10 persons 10 meters apart suddenly makes unsafe, vice versa control fact way older women men? Oooo
It's like Canada helps. Welfare hat. 
Go beg china.  approved administered hundreds thousands people? They'll reluctant. Japanese shockingly stupid vaccine fears. *Russell: Sinovac study look vaccine works entire range clinical symptoms, mild infections severe ones, including death. efficacy data 50% mild disease, requiring treatment. infections requiring medical intervention, it‚Äôs 84% moderate-to-severe Covid cases, it‚Äôs 100%.*


*Griffin: impression efficacy seems likely minimum threshold set World Health Organization less efficacious number leading vaccine candidates. may less effective symptomatic Covid (mild infections), efficacy severe cases high, incredibly valuable property vaccine, including one.* exactly sort smug, ""we coronavirus world cup"" attitude perceived almost everyone Australia reddit. Hope borders stay shut bit longer way around here. got vaccinated early, wife hesitant. beg plead tad bit emotional blackmail get take vaccine. couple right days worth mostly Moderna around live one densely populated areas US. went school Germany 60s, bit Sahin. time, generally considered children workers would become workers children academics would become academics. children working class background wanted study, friends family would sometimes ask ""do think better are?"" 

In respect, Sahin fortunate parents encouraged study. 

A low level social mobility obviously bad, system advantage producing large number qualified workers since school leavers opportunity acquire professional qualification dual system, one strengths Germany industry. yet thread literally spreading bullshit. China already viral vector vaccine company called CanSino, already approved use several countries including Mexico, Indonesia, Pakistan, etc. Well, that's good might need now. rules place set government. FDA following them. chance could serious harm, cannot allow proceed. find safe, well, thats cost buisness. 

We could save lives harvesting organs people critical illnesses save 5 lives. purely utilitarian approach medicine works. people sub. sub gone full crazy, I'm mostly shitshow days, there's factual discussions more. nurse second Pfizer dose hyped begin, describing boosts immune system even proceeds say ‚Äòbut it‚Äôs bulletproof still wear mask socially distance others.‚Äô 
Lol Sounds good! two weeks, I‚Äôm going buffet bar hopping friends. Probably US prices well  problem isn‚Äôt it‚Äôs made China, it‚Äôs Sinovac using inactivated virus particles. type vaccine doesn‚Äôt seem effective. Even Western made flu vaccines using inactivated viruses similar efficacy. MRNA vaccines seem rendered type vaccine obsolete. precautions first couple months. clear surface/food contamination wasn‚Äôt huge concern, switched eating takeout container again. 

We still wipe groceries, though. Kinda revelation lot people touch things it‚Äôs kinda gross otherwise, regardless pandemic government media. I'm quite sure could find examples saying that. That‚Äôs incorrect. government could done much did. We‚Äôre always two weeks away Fauci puts it. Thank God live state aren‚Äôt governed lockdown-obsessed people. Yes... go join queue voluntarily inject covid. 100% numbers statistical artefact low case numbers. ONE case would made equal Moderna long-term results, highly likely, vaccines similar.

But look answers thread, people actually believe real value. 100% protection even happen? Every vaccination process flaws, people get illnesses vaccination, people flawed immune systems... Wait wait wait wait wait. one 250,000?!?! someone got shot day pause hormone problems (endometriosis) prescribed estrogen past, worried be? Florida man never stopped impress. 2 doses vaccine start, booster every 6 months? Many EU countries still use AZ unrestricted (which recommendation EMA). give males. go? don‚Äôt think black white think trying paint polarizing decision exact problem. nuance announcement. 

It‚Äôs reminiscent James Comey announcing reopening investigation Hillary‚Äôs emails days election. obligated that? Probably. lack literally nuance, context, reality check? Absolutely. fizzle week later thing left lingering dramatic headline? Yep. Yeah Yes! Like I‚Äôm lucky job bought extra monitor use WFH (and I‚Äôll probably take office three total normalcy return). team meeting yesterday like 10 minute conversation something, important, genuinely could one ‚Äúsorted someone‚Äôs desk required parties‚Äù talks everyone space. can‚Äôt WAIT return office. much. Danke Ursula üòá parts illegal meet someone inside building since April 2020. longest lockdown earth metrics still death rate higher countries nothing.

Yeah brutal. cost lockdown may well overwhelm us yet. Congrats. put butter franks red hot left parts chicken. hail culinary masters Buffalo, New York. **Chances blood clot less 1 million.** 

For entire population. certain demographic (young women) looks like much, much higher. They're overdelivering USA. hot debate pregnant, even aren‚Äôt anti-vaxxers.

If true actually received anti-bodies mom vaccinated that‚Äôs amazing! Given takes 9 months baby born I‚Äôm sure results sporadic going forward lol, identify clear link that‚Äôs going encourage many mothers get vaccinated! Wait, arguing they‚Äôre less effective not? related imagined ease picking vaccine among different set vaccines? Clearly don‚Äôt pets significant ""Walk off""

You raise gender, repeating messages like expect behavioral effects. I'm getting mine put forehead! got J&amp;J vaccine last week. Thank goodness scheduled time. 

I pneumonia glad extra deadly viral version also attacks nervous system heart. one 10 million chance death vaccine better risk vaccinated another week. I‚Äôve started going back office, since live 10 minute walk it, quickly realized much better working home, bed 2 feet away desk there‚Äôs constant, like, aware house ‚ÄúAt Work‚Äù makes least feel less productive. hope people realize return office. mid-Jan. peak:  fewer cases  fewer critically ill  fewer deaths  16 y/o &amp; vaccinated/infected  close pre-covid Remaining restrictions probably lifted That‚Äôs moot point though, year ago knew little virus then, know effectively neuter vaccines get mess quickly Many (most?) colleges also going want see proof meningitis vaccination. No, it‚Äôs not. fully immunized two weeks post second shot. Health professionals touting benefits, include one longer needing wear mask. Nailed Yes, BioNTech small newcomer compared Pfizer, still managed set huge factory local supply chains less year looking produce 750 million doses annually. think pretty amazing feat. think SinoVac particularly 3rd world friendly.

SinoVac charging $37 per dose AZ charging $3.

Ultimately correct approach. evidence borne now.

Betting everything vaccines ever-mutating virus always gamble. Yep I've trying same. got first shot 3/31 told eligible 2nd shot 4/17 schedule 4/22 I've trying get 2nd shot elsewhere. go directly pharmacy web sites sometimes let specify either 2nd shot specific vaccine both.

Given JJ currently hold, CDC stated anywhere matter days weeks obtain clarity, expect EU big delay rollout yet again. that's therapy worked. transgene delivered. designed integrate genome.

The mechanisms entirely different vaccines, integrate. 

Here's example done get integration - purposefully design cassette integrate.

Is reading hard you? day still seeing significantly less deaths per day UK Israel. continue vaccinate conf moths, would probably change much.

My whole family got shots one mass vaccination sites here. recently, make appointments go. &amp; made appt, could see would Pfizer Moderna. seemed like alternated every days available shot appts. 

We took first open slots different days - ended 2 us getting Pfizer 1 Moderna. don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ton difference two data I‚Äôve seen. glad officially second dose vaccinated two days ago! Dont make sorry, talk Germans Swiss.  Similar AZ vaccine, seems risk extremely low except one demographic. EU, young women 25-35 so, risk dying AZ vaccine ballpark dying COVID. news outlets wait evidence, make objectives assessments point people higher risk, vast percentage population safe. jackshit socialism. Hell authoritarian government would made vaccination mandatory.

I agree person replying to, they're going make vaccination mandatory bodies able take risk getting vaccinated, hurt anyone else risk 1/100000. possibility getting sick motivated much active winter wound wonders mental health would really trying time (still was). wanted better shape could get back normal life started back up. There‚Äôs surge SA variants concern. Given success lockdown, current easing likely reversed. Danes refusing vaccinate people - deaths climb unless want stay locked forever... lol. Reddit users lawyers. 

‚Äúno vaccine manufactured company who‚Äôs name starts J caused problems within 2.37 months‚Äù. Lots coming UK media mixing vaccines restricted AZ 30s. Maybe hint follow France/Germany second doses cohort? Canada made agreement proven effective. guess USA country vaccine rollout going fairly well. us position. me, I'll lucky get first dose September/October. I'm still considered one lucky ones; people third-world countries probably functional rollout 2022/2023 result, can't receive vaccine years road, vaccine passports become thing globally able travel properly extremely long time. Deaths per million:
- UK: 1,876
- Israel: 729
- Denmark: 422

If goal war protect people, Israel especially UK failed miserably compared Denmark.

So using analogy, UK Israel would let nuked already winning war war time mentality. Whatever takes indeed. Tuskegee ""Study"" ended 1972. 

In 1966 Black women forcibly sterilized 3 times rate white women. decade 1960-1970 100,000 minority women sterilized without consent (and sometimes without knowledge). sterilizations continued 2010. 

In 2016 40% medical residents believed Black people ""thicker skin"" therefore felt less pain white folk. 

A 2012 study found Black Americans 22% less likely receive pain medication, even presenting symptoms severity white patients.

TODAY Black woman three times likely die childbirth white counterparts.


This system think Black folk *grateful* for? 

It's easy say ""trust science"" science lying families since inception country. Send UK please, we‚Äôll use canceling order, ordering vaccine. JnJ actually worse Sinovac since give 85% protection severe case. Sinovac 100% protection moderate severe case 84% mild.

Additionally, Moderna Pfizer incredibly positive results 100's millions doses. 

You better chance dying COVID getting side affect vaccine. hope staying locked down. *may* dies COVID. could spread someone could. course, sound like someone care. lack demographic context surpluses really helpful.

It looks like they're primarily rural, would smaller populations, less significant terms overall vaccination availability. age group largest number cases 20-29, followed 30-39, followed 40-49. Even though far fatalities among 65+ group, far fewer cases.

I think hospitalization RATE higher older people, far cases among younger. even lower hospitalization rate, roughly number.

At point vaccinations among older, fewer hospitalizations fatalities there, younger vaccinated. FHI said today increase time Pfizer doses six twelve weeks people 45

That would great news, link? Soccer leagues taken crazy precautions.  still outbreaks. Clearly that's happening, fucking stupid Fuck, sucks around, J&amp;J shot particular fantastic vaccine one-dose shot world would amazing.

It shitshow. many AZ available vaccine. Ah dang, skin. hoping like walk metal detector. way people going get *actual* microchips put them! Socialism another form authoritarianism. logistical mess? Seems simpler honest. 

I heard mess UK, lower cases US adjusted population right now. 

In grand scheme things think moot point close vaccines easy get. one dose strategy seems better many ways countries still significant supply issues. believe Chinese vaccines also interesting used high levels countries (37% population 1 dose Chile example, 90% Sinovac, believe, can‚Äôt find source) little success suppressing prevalence (but possibly severe disease).

You're likely get blood clots actual covid vaccine. also likely get struck lightning. think get delay reaction. sometimes wonder vaccine dose got stuck fat released later on. 

But also possible got Covid vaccination site feel better already it‚Äôs probably not. mean, restaurants using disinfectant wipe tables customers anyway... 

The fact probably didn‚Äôt pandemic what‚Äôs really disgusting. 21yo, prolly end 2021 Moderna proven 90 percent effective 6 months highly unlikely magically drops zero 7 months. main reason even testing boosters fall case future virus mutations evade protection. That‚Äôs US drop peak stared well.

Europe can't fired get vaccinated.

In fact, employers can't even ask we're vaccinated. can't ask us health stuff, none business lead discriminatory behaviour. J&amp;J 2

Definitely agree employees first 5 years career though. Right now, per CDC, 0.0016% people got covid vaccine died. data cause death, may related vaccine. argument vaccinated people die covid completely unfounded.

CDC percentage: WANT businesses freedom choose. PATRON business requires masks business *really* want go to, even mask children. **I support, all, mandatory EUA covid vaccines accross board every human.** Like said before, get vaccine stop worrying neighbor. protected. data shows people die COVID.

Please show data frequent people potential create dangerous variants.

Of course do. percentage immunity we're seeing vaccinations infections, rate infection mutations created low.

Edit: Minor clarifications deleted last argument. worth effort. Nah, spent time Reddit honest, would admit it.

All pandemic, even one death COVID many. Commenters brought time. Forget people dying COVID mostly old, sick people end lives anyway. sucks died, obviously it‚Äôs better didn‚Äôt, tragic young person dying. 

Now fast forward vaccine killed women 40. people give shot victims, literally saying ‚Äúthis death rate acceptable, keep using vaccine‚Äù (like comment section, go read). I‚Äôm sorry huge difference 95 year old dying got sick, 30 year old woman dying getting medicine. latter tragic. many Redditors act like it‚Äôs great price pay.  novavax taking long approve? I've dentist times since Covid started. They're safe keep things clean. worry it. early even funny. see may something simple birth control made women's blood sceptible this, maybe first go. might this. hope that's is. 43 year old EU. I'll take AZ vaccine right clinical trials vaccine (as well chAD vector, like Bharat Biotechs) inhalable Intranasal format ongoing now- terms reported association clotting, German researchers specialists field HIT hypothesized lower dose vaccine may give less reactogenecity; helpful recent data also indicated lower doses associated favorable (if superior) immune response 

The intranasal vaccines use smaller amount material taken body little differently, I'm curious see whether translate superior approach- terms adverse evenets

 certainly logistical administration standpoint Intranasal vaccine could justly considered 'game changer' without hyperbole, poorer regions struggling vaccine supply storage find train enough staff mass scale immunize don‚Äôt see problem? One death 7 million Johnson Johnson vaccine pretty fucking fantastic endorsement. great odds especially compared Covid. I‚Äôll take literal less one 1 million chance dying fucked longs rest life.

Also, it‚Äôs said 1000 times needs said again, clots conspicuously women 40. Women 40 tend much higher risk clotting due three risk factors: birth control, recent pregnancy, undiagnosed clotting disorders could genetic part larger problem like lupus. Considering amount clots happen birth control pills alone, I‚Äôd wager heavily something like culprit catalyst. Well woman üòâ literally angry government won‚Äôt give people life-threatening blood clots.

Yes, you‚Äôre right, every morning wake gnashing teeth government isn‚Äôt give people blood clots. Yeah they're liable outcomes however low, would deliver people protect them.

They've seen EU dragged AZ mud. strong desire sharply diverge competing political narrative. Extremism pursuit fighting Covid increasingly seen good. People stopped thinking rationally lot ways started thinking tribally. goes way well seeing obese elderly people high community spread places acting like real mine well running across highway.   may prove true, reality every country except US stretching dosing interval, better immunity offering AZ make huge difference. really dont luxury, infection numbers way worse denmark doubt change time soon. acting bad actor spread misinformation thus make whole thing worse drags longer. talking younger population would make smaller portion received vaccine. probably also adjusted time frame. fucking myopic counterproductive. Imbeciles. sources EITHER contradicting practically useless. Pick one. real world data might actually play AZ vaccinated cohort may less likely overall hospitilized

Unless studies South African variant found completely wrong, that's likely gonna case. Got J&amp;J week ago, GF got second Pfizer next day. one week we‚Äôll fully vaccinated, we‚Äôre planning dining indoors favorite restaurant celebrate. First time dining indoors since last March saying lie news clustered terms googling ""netherlands az factory funded uk"" similar things gets nowhere... source? Condoms break, slip off, holes, expire, etc. They're certainly better pullout method NFP anyone relying condoms prepared get pregnant. Roll dice, get 1 pregnant. That's baiscally odds condoms. Lol alright, I‚Äôll admit, still like boxes stuff bring back grocery store, give everything quick hand sanitizer rub down.

Is overkill? Likely, I‚Äôd expect surge rural areas aren‚Äôt vaccinated things open more. arent told employer fired dont take contraception. Real-world data sure wonderful thing. would interesting see plays out, AZ actually effective elderly, blood clotting issue seem factor people 60+, vaccine may found perfect niche. Gatorade water bottles. Maybe blueberries fruit smoothies antioxidants. sure helps spouse fruit blueberry smoothies moderna second shots mild. 

Could grab Motrin case need rotate Tylenol used one tablet Tylenol moderna second shot. Well, he's predicted NY's decrease correctly, correctly downplayed nationwide March surge many predicating. :shrug: far, he's said borne fruit. EMA ask stall administration! That's thinking reading headline. There's gonna spectators. inoculate everyone involved. That's probably 0% population. great article comment iffy first place.

I‚Äôve issues, main one ‚Äòvaccines aren‚Äôt solution everyone needs get vaccinated‚Äô, contradiction.

Secondly, makes seem like knows Australian healthcare professionals. country America, massive death count awful response covid, keep quiet. I‚Äôm aware know go wrong, clearly Australia sort handle itself. illusion safety dangerous. would much better stop blaming things aren‚Äôt case people worry things actually something concerned. 

Creating sanitation theater creates fear around things don‚Äôt need scared about. weren‚Äôt sanitizing everything wouldn‚Äôt forefront everyone‚Äôs mind time. absence CME wouldn‚Äôt feel unsafe. isn‚Äôt unsafe. leaves people wasting valuable worry time things fuck all.

I mean don‚Äôt get wrong pull mask walking outside past people sanity. However saying hi bigger health hazard wearing mask. people better educated less bombarded things DONT matter, maybe fewer people would hostile things (wearing mask distancing indoors)

I don‚Äôt like hygiene theater anymore like security theater airport, security obscurity software. Things I‚Äôll willingly risk drink beer crowds again: minuscule chances blood clot related death. Sounds good let‚Äôs get poking. used work rent car airport , turrism nobody come travel. Objectively wrong. Vaccines aren‚Äôt 100%. Secondly google ‚Äúmeasles outbreak Disney‚Äù. happens antivaxx people fuck around harm others..even already vaccinated. feel like arm still sore months. time stretch certain way. matter, happening. rate major side effect low compared rates serious complications COVID. Sometimes really wonder parts Europe actively enjoy living lockdown. ""So far across ¬†EU UK, 15 events DVT 22 events pulmonary embolism reported among given vaccine, based number cases Company received 8 March.

Ann Taylor, Chief Medical Officer, said: ‚ÄúAround 17 million people EU UK received vaccine, number cases blood clots reported group lower hundreds cases would expected among general population.""

I little imprecise, seems like 1 500,000 citizens affected.

Those 'odds' could well correct, rolled every time someone takes it. 1 25,000 people affected it. know exact numbers assume mean comparable risk death get covid age group.. chances getting covid general still low one person. Especially masking/distancing. two probabilities (chance actually getting covid chance dying get it) need compared chance dying blood clot definition subjecting risk getting vaccine. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs vaccine is...chicken noodle flavored‚Äù Ding ding ding! I'm 40 got vaccinated AZ last week. regrets link showed, they‚Äôre calling ‚Äútypical use‚Äù includes sometimes sex without condom. Well duh, course don‚Äôt work don‚Äôt use them, like birth control pills work actually take them.

I used condoms every single time sex partner decided kids, worked perfectly. doubt makes us special. They're free refuse. even bother vaccine stay inside?

Hell, even needs immune system never come close proximity another human being?

We entering new age. on, weak socialize. else? obvious? I'm telling that's great suggestion birth control side effects created equal among various methods. 

It's definitely first thing would tell anyone try bad cramps bleeding begin with, example since increased cramping bleeding noted negative side effects. 

You could get lucky DECREASED cramping bleeding, course, there's guarantee. 

If love yours, that's great. I'd say ""try know specific cycle issues risk levels best try whatever method meshes best"" ""IUDS FIRST RECOMMENDATION LIKE MINE NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS.""

The Nuvaring works great known higher risk blood clots methods even though choice recommend everyone matter course. Pure politics, blood clots statically insignificant Correct - know exact amount infections. know rural testing less urban, even factoring error bars, would likely widen gap, decrease.

You also rtfa see increase death count subgroup. Yep that‚Äôs right all. husbands parents 60 (one risk group) work public. Neither able get appointments vaccines. sibling works public hospital hasn‚Äôt vaccinated yet.

Denmark great getting vaccines arms them, it‚Äôs slow going supply issues. I'm Russian do, course. believe process peer-review competence scientists working Lancet. don't, less power üòÅ ohh true. welcome, bonegirl 06.  vaccines make difference 40 million vaccines, all?

I find extremely hard believe. Yea course. would indeed , know ""newer"" pills third especially fourth generation way higher risk thrombosis compared older ones. still restriction them. Often especially young girls get one newer pills, additionally effects like helping acne. Nut tbh rather acne thrombosis, pulmonary embolism strokes. say, compared situation pill actions taken. wonder too. pollster asks ""have vaccinated"" appointment tomorrow, people may respond yes. 

Technically wrong, could see people making error. complications, ultimately thousands die COVID. Great logic study: fear mongering absurd?
Riighht fear mongering fucking virus like 98% chance surviving tootally absurd üôÑ

The fear mongering virus caused cruise ship full people able come land ended forcing everyone ship stay rooms like hostages ot something fucking months people make fun others driving mask on. need run errands public places, put mask leave throughout trip locations, since touching mask ideal. *choice* taking it. effective British variant. 

This study disagrees: shown low efficacy South African variant dominant variant worldwide.

Doesn't matter, *will* become dominant due time countries vaccinated AZ (again, provided data South African variant break Pfizer vaccine well per Israeli data.

Every variant break every vaccine, that's point. good! I‚Äôm rural NH know boony things get real quick haha Honest question here. side effects rare entirely possible cases CVST occurred noticed.

The UK seemed notice CVST (certainly amount cases went significantly) alerted possibility Norwegian health authority. entirely possible countries Sputnik used developed Norway thus investigation deaths following vaccine (as mentioned small problem quite easy miss). may endometriosis, case birth control appropriate treatment. past years, FDA approved endometriosis medication (orilissa). potential cure surgery remove endometrioma followed management medication. surgery, followed 6 months Lupron, doctor explained sort like chemo/radiation remaining microscopic endometrioma, followed higher dose progestin-only birth control (norethindrone). I'm going 7 years remission. highly recommend find gyn specializing endo, extended pain associated menstruation normal adults. (Common, normal.) Like super bowl NCAA tournaments? Don‚Äôt forget baseball opening day. reddit meetup. explain confusion? I'm EU girlfriend China want meet 15 months apart. varies lot region. Booked mine yesterday (I'm 48) earliest could get 28th April. Yeah doesn‚Äôt seem anything beyond thought tbh, something keep eye case, it‚Äôs expected tbh. I'm happy someone loves much remember &lt;3 Nope. I've back work office since July, started living close normally could things started opening back state last May. Even worst shutdowns still grocery shopping, hiking, seeing parents select friends regularly. Fantastic reply. Spot on. One allowed wife get first Moderna shot two weeks ago even though weren‚Äôt eligible state‚Äôs rules many shots enough arms. wasn‚Äôt even ‚Äúwe‚Äôll call left over‚Äù situation. called guy phone asked risk factors could remotely justify getting turn. challenging way, ‚Äúplease help help help us‚Äù kind way.

Well, turns really nasty encounter lower respiratory infection years ago absolutely want repeat, something else legit wife, absolutely fine him. didn‚Äôt lie, went got shots.

Then thing happened another rural county far us. didn‚Äôt even ask justification called get teenage sons vaccinated. Made appointment next morning, little driving, way toward ready resume semblance normal life again. Meanwhile, around us, virus ignorance rage on. Reddit doesnt like 1 500 healthy people dying. luck, like mutations turned dinosaurs chickens longer capable consuming 100+ pound live mammals, mutations render vaccine ineffective also result virus incapable attacking human body. hope so, usually hangars absolutely packed. Yep, removal would answer regardless leader's position spectrum nation. said morning delivere additional 50m doses EU Q2 could almost completely replace 55m doses JJ EU planning Q2

50m doses BioNTech equivalent 25m doses JJ. read Danish.

The whole ""better options available"" thing false premise. AZ vaccine less risky mRNA vaccines people. 

""Under control"" also relative; they're still seeing 1 2 people die *per day* COVID-19, rate people dying blood clots, expect deaths *total* vaccinate *the entire population* AZ J&amp;J. vg literally says friday Japan fugged up. Osaka breaking new cases week, another wave starting tokyo, vaccination slow AF.... olympics still going happen? 

I think wanted everyone else get vaccinated didnt spend vaccinations something, kinda plan polio soviet union saved ass. fun that: find certain number. say regulary 1 10000 woman gets thrombosis (not actual number, taking simple number, would read often really happens), pill 8 times higher (for pills 4th generation). older pill, like first second generation, dangerous, sometimes 2-3 high without pill. known, many ""newer"" pills often used, known solve problems like acne too. Additionally side effects like gaining weight often older ones. seems comfortable one newer generation, really bad side effects happen often.
What needs mentioned everyone gets CVST it. appear leg wherever. often leads pulmomary embolism strokes, also fun deal with. guess based EU works happened last summer, EU add outside countries goes well. Last summer made big deal reopening, barely managed get borders open within EU handful countries suitably low covid cases, borders slam shut months later. Also U.S seem planning vaccine passport doubt EU accept little paper card give proof vaccination. countries: Greece, (Croatia EU schengen zone), Iceland (Europe EU) said already let vaccinated people outside enter. like me, want see friend family member EU really care country meet in, seems options. want go Europe someone another country travel country country like pre-covid days, think wait bit longer. Tfuuuuu... women take pill? smoking??? Yes 40 year olds life important 60 year olds? Great logic smart man. I'd kill 10k people save 3 milion. btw death rate covid women 20s similar AZ vaccine, anything 30yrs several times less likely kill you.
No one said vaccine didnt side effects, every drug side effects hundreds times likely one vaccine.
Even aspirin 15 per 100 000 death rate. ban even saves milions lives? recent Birmingham study real-world (non-trial) data shows lower T-cell response Pfizer/BioNTech Oxford/AstraZeneca 80s.

After one dose. small, non peer reviewed study. Efficacy also much complicated taking headline one single study face value.

Additionally, mRNA efficacy confirmed effectiveness real-world data Israel. [citation needed]

Since primary infection vector airborne, don‚Äôt make assumptions people laying around open mouths, hygienist close mouths. Yeah sports high school, danced afterwards, always feel like outlier time popular thread people 20s 30s circlejerk bodies ""broken"" pops lol demonised thrombosis.
And yes, Pfizer product certainly image. extract extra dose, reduced quantity shipping. asshole AZ authorized US.

&amp;#x200B;

J&amp;J makes 5% overall US supply.

&amp;#x200B;

what attract attention?

assuming roughly number cases ITP.. concerning?

&amp;#x200B;

25 cases J&amp;J (5% vaccines administered).

25 cases Moderna/Pfizer - (95% vaccines administered). misinformation abounding sides, poor science bad actors. remember reading whole 4Chan thread bunch conspiracy loons saying COVID truly airborne (worse measles) government ""downplaying threat"" ensure infection rates sky rocket, declare nationwide lockdown martial law. 

Fact is, first worldwide crisis we've faced age internet, trying sort truth fabrication/manipulation/misinformation difficult. Still is, empirical data draw upon (like article addressing). normal circumstances, yes. global pandemic circumstances, ehhhh. 
The threshold emergency use authorization lower normal authorization process. time, larger sample sizes would studied longer durations, costs great pandemic circumstances pushing vaccines less definitively effective harmless ideal circumstances trade think make. way, vaccine rollout really slow focused AZ vaccines. guess depends whether believe claimed efficacy Sputnik vaccine. know don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre Russia do, power you. think comes people prioritizing marginal community benefit like many deaths possibly prevented. get blood clot, long term health jeopardized simply wearing masks bigger supply comes ? Who's going Pay Healthcare treatment? One woman intensive care jj vaccine. gonna stuck paying huge bills ask expect big pharmacy liability injuries caused vaccine well reading comprehension sucks lol  Boy really gonna seeing headlines like next 10 years we? 39 according Washington post. hyperbole

This wasn‚Äôt doom post btw. curious ny struggling reversal. Ill ask, works healthcare office role, would think would least suggested her. know discussed Dr well. would bet cdc would like hear though. Weird, I'm trouble finding well distinctly recall Pfizer case two tried insist sure vaccine related, also reality even monoclonal bands mean triggered. That's 200,000 cops. Pretty massive response talking 114 million people state. France said they're going use 200k already received earlier week. Cool. I'm sure I'm getting voted though. bonuses? like financial bonuses work? anti-vaxxers going talk luxury part nuances mentioned. Denmark taken better approach decision. Makes think want delay vaccination campaign countries going delayed theirs, economic reasons. tons prescription drugs carry serious side effects don‚Äôt pull shelves 

And lots get onto shelves side effects. reality risk ICU admission prevalence now, risk CVST AZ low. risk vaccine tiny bit higher 30s, makes sense offer alternative. hard get exact numbers fatalities AZ vaccine yet.

The chance blood clots 1 : 250 000, still treated time lucky know watch for, yet guaranteed death.

(Source Gov UK: )

In comparison: Tandem skydiving pretty safe, chances dying 1 : 253 000, similar getting blood clot want quarantine home rest life welcome to. Covid never eradicated vaccinated completely safe resume normal life. This....is really good analogy

90% chance resist. roll 10% chance, still reduces amount damage does. Also spell casted - odds casted relates community spread area. Chin around corner! don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs black white - clearly UK found vaccine doesn‚Äôt kill people often enough. guess Denmark UK different risk tolerances, doesn‚Äôt make either one right wrong. gonna real treat. arm gonna hurt worse gonna get chills fever, decent fever, headache makes head hurt new places new ways.

Then state gonna freeze bunch people gonna lose power gonna fall pool trying break ice pump go out. sure trying make joke here. many Indian states currently facing shortage vaccines sending countries part helping hand geopolitical shit.
Duh, checked username. point CDC recommendations indicator much pressure they‚Äôre atm less indicator do. Many Olympic-tier athletes would easily throw away dream they've working toward lives risk catching Covid. assuming perfect information rational thinking. People misled, misunderstand, etc. 

it generally considered immoral give someone vaccine carries risk disease itself. Ya that‚Äôs said lol. Compared Wyoming it‚Äôs generally population dense tho Layman knowledge here, AZ seems low platelet count (what linked above) + clots brain. unusual combination seems concerning. Good question cases spoken much. Maybe they're common wild. know hear out.
You valuable, life worth living, may seem right everything sucks, feelings valid, okay scream void want. eventually get better promise you. make stupid decision, people love rely you, valuable. Fox News going get host show COVID (because course would), even backed realized incredibly wrong is. Meanwhile, still platform Twitter spreads misinformation 230k+ followers.

It's fucking easy anti-science grifter social media. legitimately sometimes wonder myself. Master's degree well-known school write complete sentences. takes get paranoid boomers shower attention money? would US control J&amp;J vaccinations EU? knew something wrong favela gangsters cared people, government....Oh, South America oh why? father always says Peru becoming new Mexico. parents Peruvian :( :( :( :( post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

This may contentious people, even 97% reduction, people high risk adjusted risk could still worth considering. 

But like 25 year old hanging another 25 year old one vaccinated. risk extremely small. lot people find intolerable continue waiting different risk tolerance/understanding - empathize them.

I working office entire time really let fatigue sink - vaccine better constant malaise. agree. pretty dumb events now, people stupid. both? you. India producing much vaccine,there shortage stopped exports vaccines.Foreign manufacturers given emergency approval days ago beacuse shortage. someone explain stopped? can't read article Officially, kind outing still discouraged CDC. thing officially recommended vaccinated private gatherings vaccinated one non-vulnerable unvaccinated household.

But know messaging designed hold back general reopenings people vaccinated.

Unofficially, reasonably safe. Stop sealioning 1) young people running around go work etc, opposed elderly stay home far easily, 2) numbers young people affected growing quickly, variants helping vaccine doesnt stop transmission... thought name implied that.... bad. Also China would beg differ üòÇ interchangeable lol, glad see you‚Äôre focusing important things though. birth control roughly 1 1000 blood clot nobody seems arms that.... Sounds like feelings two lockdowns- second, harshest one 112 days, wasn‚Äôt one. weren‚Äôt completely restrictions inbetween, also wasn‚Äôt 7 months actually prevented leaving home yeah, HALF YEAR!!! (like flu shot)

I trust immune system develop natural antibodies pathogen 99.95% RECOVERY RATE!! month two enough people vaccinated greatly limit spread, next 4-8 weeks could rough.  billing insurance it. first vaccine billed father's insurance $180. insurance, get free.

Edit: per CMS.gov, vaccine free, providers bill cost administering vaccine. Got vacced UK today also, 25 year old previous health issues &amp; front line worker anything! local centre ‚Äúunder 30‚Äôs‚Äù day today age groups done. recommended 30‚Äôs given Pfizer AZ though. said everywhere, Michigan exception much pause J&amp;J affect EU? looks like pause going last least week now, knew J&amp;J stopped shipments EU blood clot concerns. EU rely heavily J&amp;J vaccine?

I‚Äôm concerned US, Pfizer Moderna enough get everyone vaccinated here. J&amp;J remain paused. They'll meet review 7-10 days. Put fork J&amp;J, vaccine done. Wasn‚Äôt supposed place months ago? 1,000 people still dying every day Covid... saying situation who‚Äôs work done person home 

Ofc really depends work question think friends least one shot CA. Everyone aren‚Äôt anti vaccine unfortunately allowed take route, good news next semester, I'll mostly campus. However, that's without friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Senior year. Woooooo don‚Äôt one still recorded majority insurance. Well there's problem. Thank you, end going it‚Äôs solved delayed reaction that‚Äôs all. appreciate reply! True. remember COVID 19 though either. Sure ... could go wrong? end May

If Netherlands fuck probably around age 40 still F summer us 100% afaik issues first dose, seem appear within week two getting vaccine, clear 1 person 10,000 probably one snorting Amazon packages surge Michigan building while. state shown trajectory. Two weeks ago, vaccination centers vaccine people wanted denied. Why? fit certain age bracket. 

This whole vaccination program mess. least 1 year get right messed it. Meanwhile Union health minister news yesterday asking definite progress shown ""cow science"" August 2021. think people learnt lessons no. so, one? 
This occured India - Sep 23, 2020 (Paper date, infection date)
'It noteworthy genetic variant (S: N440K) found reinfection I2 possibly confers resistance neutralizing antibodies. best knowledge, one earliest reports genetically characterized reinfection know many things science cannot proved hard evidence?

In science, nothing proven. make falsifiable hypothesis, either prove false gain confidence gonna able tiny ass sample size, next couple weeks gonna get data whether like not.

I'm like... gather data, soon single man dies hypothesis dead. That's literally I'm cant say risk 0 questionable fuck hypothesis says so. 

You say data tells you. exists data shows risk men, go that. data yet exists, assume risk evidence says people die.

Not giving people vaccine perceived risk without evidence also people die... covid. know people LITERALLY dying covid? fact. killing men could taken alternative vaccine risk wasnt yet falsifiable enough idiotic.

Based used word here, think understand falsifiable falsifiable hypothesis relies assumption cannot make sort confidence, assumption individuals women exclusive cause side effect

I really feel like understand hypothesis affected far women been' science.

Yes is. making observations creating falsifiable models observations either improve confidence proven attempting base 'scientific fact' nothing correlation. first 10 people die covid complications happened women (maybe women severe prexisting conditions cant see) said ""well cant say men need worry isnt falsifiable"", think sound Intelligent?

I'm simply trying follow scientific process. CDC says chances fomite transmission 1 10,000. getting injured toilet. Michigan I'm located. Many people simply know Department Health county. DOH responsible monitoring infection area, providing tests insurance offering vaccines things like Hep A, B C, viruses like HIV, sexually transmitted diseases. families insurance, get child vaccinated properly go school, maintain record vaccination. 

The DOH help anyone get COVID vaccine free. Call (look like this: ""Rock County Department Health""), go online search Google. registering verifying email, hit ""Get Vaccinated"" button. asked vaccination site like go to. Click it, next screen show available times dates appointments. Select one. given Square Code save phone emailed you. Either bring phone print code bring you. 
If get 2-shot vaccine, next appointment sent immediately. much... guess I‚Äôm working bad assumption rather bad sources. 

I really liked started thought typing rest comment good idea. 

When say ""this sub"", mean lockdown skeptics essentially equivalent predict housing market crash every year hoping eventually find data point confirms guess? CEOs comments investors he's going incredibly conservative. also think they're interested pushing capacity ending mask rules. could see away spacing requirements keeping masks, might worst case scenario comfort. clearly expect full capacity October. 

Of course international parks looked masks outdoors, might help. different? Many women confused governments stopping use vaccine 3 million chance clot, allow contraception 1 10000 chance clots market It‚Äôs embarrassing reeks privilege, honestly. blame two factors. Doug Ford, current premier Ontario, justifiably unpopular PM Justin Trudeau also tends someone Canadians tolerate best vehemently dislike worst. Anticipating incompetence + witnessing early delays + wanting acknowledge successes hands federal provincial governments = ignoring discrediting good news sticking negative narratives based happening months ago. 

The second factor Canadians wanting admit might better US EVERYTHING. superiority complex gets challenged idea US might better equipped something like mass vaccine rollout we‚Äôre disadvantage we‚Äôre world power; mention us lacking domestic vaccine production defunded back 80s. It‚Äôs much easier blame every delay temporary unpopular governments admit never gonna best this. sources EITHER contradicting practically useless. Pick one. Yeah health department going send insurance information (non-existent) primary care physician? appropriately chastised complete misrepresentation issue, changed comment earlier thread. Also, hate posting phone.  1. Michigan isn‚Äôt bloodbath. Yes they‚Äôre healthcare system duress heavy load that‚Äôs bloodbath. Brazil bloodbath. situations same. 

2. Reopening beginning March different trying reopen now, far greater proportion population vaccinated. created false equivalency Oh look, lockdownsceptic logic. 

C‚Äômon man, that‚Äôs reality know that. US enough demand warrant manufacturing there,

The EU inhabitants = demand. it‚Äôs worth I‚Äôm willing agree you. end, trust experts. Here‚Äôs portion CDC statement regarding convene meeting Advisory Committee Immunization Practices (ACIP) Wednesday review cases assess potential significance. FDA review analysis also investigates cases. process complete, recommending pause use vaccine abundance caution. important, part, ensure health care provider community aware potential adverse events plan proper recognition management due unique treatment required type blood now, adverse events appear extremely rare. COVID-19 vaccine safety top priority federal government, take reports health problems following COVID-19 vaccination seriously. People received J&amp;J vaccine develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, shortness breath within three weeks vaccination contact health care provider. 


I feel like reflects general opinion thread. It‚Äôs enough occurrence warrant proper review. short halt review issue plenty good public perception. short halt make considerable impact vaccination rates already ahead expected schedule.


We disappointed road bump likely nothing great concern. Nonetheless, talking vaccine may reach billions people. Pfizer hogging spotlight, I'm glad see Moderna getting love since they've sharing load pretty equally Pfizer got first Pfizer vaccine yesterday I'm weird side affects really scaring me. First common fatigue/arm pain. today back started hurting every time breathed in, googled said type pain either nothing, blood clot. news J&amp;J vaccine yesterday, nervous blood clot. got really panicked suddenly felt really faint ended vomiting. really scared something wrong. sure Pulmonary embolism? Thank much condolences taking time reply. article information provided comforting. Lol semantics

""Is okay go restaurants...""

Fauci: ""no still okay""

Synonym ""okay"" = ""acceptable"" big surpluses EU US 6 months so. almost certainly go rest world  I‚Äôm full lockdowns need restrict high risk situations, require vaccinations. would lot easier financially help industries everything. nah, want vaccine get one pass collectively ignore  Ramadan shitposting lmao curious change FDA full approves Pfizer/Moderna soon thought companies applied recently waiting. fully approved FDA, think many places require it.  vaccine 100% effective

It always confuses people say this. Like course aren't? Life never 100% risk free either. People act like nobody ever died viral infections COVID. can't keep thinking like this. seen argument paracetamol entered trials today pass due close together effective lethal dose are. Goes show much things changed. Yep. early mid June we're literally going run people vaccinate, overall take rate never going go much 80-85%.  Around 1 every 10k people severe skin respiratory complications Paracetamol.

Around 1 every 10k people develop severe neural reactions ibuprofen.

Around. 1 every 8k people suffer sudden death Viagra.

People pop like candy. Unfortunatelly world fear mongering sells newspappers. US enough demand warrant manufacturing there, whilst unaware details, imagine US put forward funding perhaps lucrative incentives production US soil. also assume great base already set manufacturing especially considering Pfizer US company.

But point Pfizer needs access countries outside US fulfil demand opportunities expanding making greater profit. EU ideal place set (atleast Pfizer concerned) ban exports. would need manufacturing outside EU  actually know immunity distributed sample. entirely possible get 90% overall population efficiency localized differences people respond vaccine, people getting 90% getting significantly less. can't control every variable - entirely possible significant number ""breakthroughs"" people generate normal immune response number reasons, studying it. Denmark fewer Corona cases, comparison risk less worth it.

Probably Pfizer delivered Denmark calculated without AZ? real life data, UK reported AZ single dose actually out-performed single dose Pfizer preventing infection elderly, little bit. See investigators found one dose Pfizer vaccine 57% 61% effective preventing symptomatic COVID-19 4 weeks AstraZeneca vaccine 60% 73% effective.""

This may better comparison trials two vaccines used nation time. look forward seeing 2 dose data (not available yet UK delayed second dose) totally agree. want people making decisions based manipulative information. Even statistics representative, people need space make decision without made feel like concerns invalid. Stay safe there! Austrian here, idea that's already implemented. rather easy step. Thank üòä

Seriously. anti-mask/vax person reading this... oh wait probably can't read. Nevermind. I'm worried people around me. Trying safe apossible hard sometimes. Vaccination rate 1% every three days. nearly 40% one dose. 90-days till speculated herd immunity territory. April 12th step 2. first lockdown easings, children returning school, individual visits care homes, meeting friend outside, etc, effect 5+ weeks cases since halved.

Don‚Äôt get wrong, cases almost certainly increase larger easing you‚Äôre right won‚Äôt see immediately (the government repeating point weeks), results step 1 certainly encouraging. people know already gotten first mRNA shot, J&amp;J shot already. mom circle friends long since fully vaccinated. get 2nd shot next week. Aiming late May early June looks easy target. live things quickly moving point want vaccine get it.

We need hold tight everybody gets 2nd shot needed, 2 weeks it. get close finish line bungle would incredibly disappointing. Yep. It‚Äôs right now, Indiana. went Danville first shot three us line.  second shot burb aurora thing, three us line. 

Indiana begging people states get shot numbers don‚Äôt look like shit. reported complications J&amp;J currently 6 7,000,000.

Which actually might ok. country invested heavily RNA vaccines. ordered less AZ. I‚Äôm sure still get used. false, never positives locking economy suffers far go darker lockdown result keeping people safe sooner.

There well documented positive relationship well-timed adequate lockdown (with adequate stimulus spending) better economy. Yes, didn‚Äôt. Oh yeah missing going work deal terrible boss bad pay talking crazy people staying inside hard decision.

And consider getting vaccinated even skeptical vaccines' status. Risk serious side effects appears much lower consequences getting Covid-19. random all. you‚Äôre getting dose doctors office it‚Äôs best trained medical professional makes sure gets recorded. can‚Äôt honestly expect people keep little cards good condition. insurance company knows primary network. makes sense efficient way.

It‚Äôs record anyway it‚Äôs suppose you‚Äôre transferring records correctly necessary. really see unfair considering rational - well documented cognitive biases cause us fail risk analysis. situations experimentally demonstrated people consistently make irrational choices, sense choices inconsistent objectively suboptimal.

It irrational sense risks face vaccine far, far lower risks willingly accept contexts without second thought.

It's also irrational likely risks face vaccine lower risks face covid infection interim. course can't say certain specifically, true people world, aggregate certain harm come delaying vaccinating.  plain wrong. Look Japan's testing rates per capita. near bottom globally. Yet know hospitals near capacity overwhelmed. So, actual death numbers unknown, much, much higher official numbers. Still, probably bit better countries, unclear much. acts antenna stronger 5G signal. ketchup bet. pigeons bats whole time! Still waiting article states vaccine make 100% immune. unethical give people vaccines carry risk prevents. 

Especially alternatives. overwhelming majority people get infected mount good immune response. body keeps blueprints defend future infections many months, potentially years decades. 

So good protection. invincible though still get infected, chances dramatically reduced. I've seen estimates 80-95% reduction risk. 

This said, still important previous infection get vaccinated vaccine immunity likely cause last longer. well immunity vaccine closely studied tracked time due P3 vaccine studies better understanding time. 

Yes prior infection contributes herd immunity, vaccines, herd immunity always achieved via natural  infection.

In US example, total population immunity estimated around 45-60%. it‚Äôs literally article matched ID. Thats federal law long time traveling air. feels odd necessary. necessarily disagree (?)

Yes, it‚Äôs true Pfizer doubled deliveries double June situation improve within weeks. J&amp;J deliver millions beginning May approved stop. Moderna staring deliver quite regularly too. number includes men women weren‚Äòt thrombosis cases women? risk ridiculously low men Yup, lot places country go city fuck 20 minutes fuck lasts 5 hours. don‚Äôt outside border Maine really. stop tying exercise weight loss goals. picked recreational lifting instead, suddenly lack scale-go-down progress entirely surpassed cool newbie gains.  unlike aerobic workout felt like ass sweating 30 minutes, love built breaks rest periods lifting. Squat heavy minute rest two minutes - easy! easy! 

Bike riding, walking listening podcasts, roller skating - exercise *have* something shitty. turn enjoyable time. two years. real possibility boosters thing. Looking likely time goes on... 100 mln doses exported. EU done US - simply banned exports altogether population vaccinated, would vaccinated twice many citizens around 100 countries would little vaccines (other Russian Chinese ones). EU supplying whole world outside China, Russia USA. Even UK imported 1/3 vaccines EU.  I'm already vaccinated ‚ò∫ Lmao comment ‚Äúcall cops, class 2 misdemeanor‚Äù

My understanding best course action think true adverse reaction vaccine go primary physician (if one) find doctor evaluate you.

Ultimately reason phase 3 trials large a) typically need large group evaluate efficacy b) outside trial control group non control group *it *really* hard link ""reactions"" might vaccine. saying happen absolutely (look J&amp;J vaccine - ironically one trialed). actually mass vaccination acting type trial since everyone vaccinated makes easier make connections (ie. 8 women gotten vaccines year apart would harder make connection came J&amp;J)

But answer question - showing typical symptoms - rash/hurt arm/fever/headache... etc... likely need reported - expected. Outside typical symptoms would likely need medical professional ""vouch"" believe whatever reaction due vaccine.

I'm expert feel free correct.  I'm actually pro vax lol want try compare dangers vaccine vs dangers disease I'm willing bet vaccine far safer going without it!   share world together. Unless nation keeps Taiwan-style quarantine, eventually new strains come back across borders. virus truly vaccine immune, takes months go single case full blown pandemic. 

I doubt Taiwan New Zealand keep restrictions majority populations vaccinated. costly maintain strict measures years. fellow Masshole thanks updates üëç Afaik Indian government invested penny vaccine production yet.

There's lot talk companies implementing vaccine passports. New York state even one maintained government. seems lot support mandatory vaccinations mass gatherings domestic flights.

We seem heading direction unless there's significant public pushback. quick punch stuff? Incredible! always look forward comments. wait Pfizer Moderna vaccines reach Europe? eventually.

Note: Pfizer EUA expanded age 12, eligible population increased approximately 6,020,000. think major portion, think that, yes, unmasked vaccinated people contribute spread.

So utilize vaccines widespread case counts drop, let's talk taking masks off.

Because big thing think split society going encourage unvaccinated people go unmasked.

Maybe small events like ""Forgot mask home/in car, well, I'll go unmasked, one say anything, they'll assume I'm vaccinated."" Thank saying this! I've trying follow story since came 1) I'm woman age group trying decide vaccine want 2) inherited rare blood condition makes risk blood clots. use contraceptives. avoid many clotting risks can. something comes saying might cause severe clots, pay attention it. Especially hear blood thinners make worse. literally mobile clinic get J&amp;J shot right came out. reason get day. first dose AstraZenica 5 weeks ago. I'm really hoping prevent second dose.

I'm 35, high risk due heart problem history strokes 20's. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

[Also, Edit: I'm UK. Well lot vaccine centres shut now. definitely shortage doses compared issue logistics  mainly due double mutated L542R covid 19 strain . Many researchers fear may cause
 re- infections , affect children , reducing vaccine effectiveness , higher rate transmission , increase virus adaptability , potentially lethal health care system fails due load cases .
 ( search L542R info ) Brazileans young people European country since third world country. Low life expectancy high child number per woman Er, think New findings Understanding Coronavirus America survey reveal comes attitudes beliefs COVID-19 vaccine ‚Äî willingness get vaccine knowing someone vaccinated perceived risks side effects ‚Äî substantial gap more- less-educated U.S. residents.

And effect seems international Higher levels education also associated positively vaccine acceptance questions Damn. realize EU far behind US UK. Really puts perspective **Previous COVID-19 may cut risk reinfection 84%** 

What strange headline. get reinfected never previously infected?

I would suggest opposite true - risk getting covid second time reliant already before! Assuming crazy decrease J&amp;J pause, looks like we've got long weekend milestones coming up:

* 30% adults fully vaccinated tomorrow

* 200m total doses Friday, 

* 50% 18+ 1 doses Saturday

* 40% total population 1 doses Sunday

Somewhere next 2-3 days also 80%+ seniors 1 doses. I'm kind surprise stories popping Reddit. Reddit Ultra pro Covid vaccine. People raise shit storm amount vaccine induced deaths though. Regardless whether greater good. numbers spit TDEE calculators often generous. meticulously tracking months crunching ate vs lost, got much accurate TDEE hundred calories less estimates. 

But I'm still within standard deviation estimates. eating deficit -500 day days, helping lose lb weight week, help slowly lose. Germany give 60 consult GP may also give younger. sensible thing do. I'm sure looks good say ""Hey think vaccines dangerous citizens, poor however matter go""

Lets realistic here. currently available vaccines seems way saver vaccinating COVID. time though make sense rich nation use problematic vaccines better alternatives available. donating / cheaply selling problematic vaccines developing nations deeply affected COVID vaccine access population sight sense shame would idiotic.  clear June yet Chicago didn‚Äôt open beaches bikes/running paths winter. Lmao another reddit moment soap Lol Corona Virus causes common cold ya I'd say they're compostable start sending countries guarantee proper storage vaccination . world sick needs support exactly talking age group clear onset. already studies last may saying primary means transmission room infected person prolonged period time. Outdoors safe whole entire time places like could never get past ""omg!!!! Look people beach!!!!"" health insurers agree cover people take vaccine? 

The reason cover old people. actually way round, Pfizer majority weeks ago AZ became common. 60/40 split something like now. joke got old 2020... Easy, US paying 37 dose Europe tried negotiate 10 dollars dose. US also signed contracts weeks sooner EU did. paid sooner. That‚Äôs it, whole secret. felt horrid 36 hours bit first moderna. I‚Äôm sure anyone knows exactly why, I‚Äôve read speculation Covid first shot hit u harder. Teachers cannon fodder economy seams. No. Everyone get choice body. Anyone abstaining vaccine isnt putting anyone chose take risk. vaccine produced whose footing bill ones we‚Äôve bought? Netherlands last summer. places past priority group Pfizer isn‚Äôt vaccine. impression transmission long term exposure confined space. Like eating dinner indoors, spending 30 minutes grocery store masked 6 feet everyone called straw man Also, means already disease (and risk group), probably give others chance vaccinated first. got fired march took oportunity go back finish college want open college cuz ""the teachers vaccinated"" wtf country, students lmao. 


Hate shithole country. Wow risk assessments age groups rely stupid statements. sleep deprivation lowers immune response, immune response causing side effects, pull all-nighter getting vaccine immediately going sleep? almost two weeks since first (Pfizer) dose, still swelling it.    Half Pfizer half AZ, Moderna starting 10 million jj vaccines 1/1000000 10 cases 40 percent mortality rate. 

Once narrow subset population seems risk, i.e. women 40. even J&amp;J started rollout, actual number might still rise upcoming days - similar AZ also started ""one million"" probability days numbers showed different picture - [Norway five cases amongst 130000 AZ vaccines \(1:25000\), three died, Germany - that's amongst group negligible risk die Covid. UK alone, COVID-19 killed hundreds people 30.

There 27 women younger 30 years (77 &lt;40 years) total died covid Germany far.

There ~510000 confirmed infections women &lt; 35 years Germany. 

Unfortunately can't quickly find dataset matching age groups, even conservative estimate (deaths amongst women &lt;40yo, infections &lt;35 yo) get 

77/510000=.00015

Data:  that's even considering undiagnosed Covid cases. Looking numbers makes choice ""AZ vaccine"" ""no vaccine"" obvious individual level - that's even choice needs made: vaccines available, viable solution (if current numbers correct) could vaccinate men older people AZ/J&amp;J reserve Biontech-Pfizer women &lt; 40 love thrown vehicle high speed! people care

and government stupid af

it bound happen, thought 5x would died Perfect analogy. Taking conscious action throw switch (authorize vaccine) seen less ethically permissible remaining passive taking action (and turn, hundred people incumbent track perish). Biontech already used general practitioners Germany, lasts days normal fridge temperatures. So, then, wonder people say they've living draconian lockdown year? Yep. would awesome. Trying hold onto remember people feeling way choosing act irrationally. damn, makes lose hope. everyone's choice act, mean impact us care them. ""When came preventing case happening, whether mild severe, Pfizer Moderna vaccines 95% efficacy‚Äîbut doesn‚Äôt mean 5% inoculated people get infected. [to factor virus‚Äôs attack likelihood getting sick exposure.

After that, scientists would predict one coronavirus case every 2,000 people take shots Moderna Pfizer. Johnson Johnson's single-shot, would one 300."" 


This part everyone needs read show others. 0.33 chance getting sick J&amp;J, 0.05% chance pfizer/moderna. hospitalized dying, symptomatic all. Hospitalization death far lower both. slaughter R0 rate matter weeks keep vaccinating. Ignore hype, J&amp;J likely distributed soon next week two, even isn't, 2 even better still protect individual extremely well. 


We 'can' wipe thing these. Utterly totally. Pfizer isn‚Äôt vaccine. told that? Antivaxxers complaining censorship? cop out? world works. literally owe world nothing country thinks best people. means rapidly trying vaccinate entire population. world altruistic want we‚Äôd never war things like hate racism wouldn‚Äôt exist. agree wish would help impoverished nations get vaccines that‚Äôs worms worth opening decide help? many? turn cost American lives? tell American people vaccine tax dollars paid going shipped Uganda wait 4 months get it? that‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs right thing do.... that‚Äôs world works. see beginnings North American civil war here.  happens case death due vaccine? government offer compensation case knew risks? pointed got downvoted some.others simply understand per capita ratio. people least read write? sitting international councils make country geopolitically stronger. Canada's actual influence world little. Canada actually much own, simply follows US LIO leads. keeps getting worse longer goes on, get unmotivated depressed. I'm starting suicidal thoughts......like what's even point anymore. another ''variant'' another ''lockdown''. NEVER end.....it's really started feel way. goals dreams traveling world stolen me. feel like taking experimental ''vaccine'' travel. I'm 24 I'm losing youth this.....this supposed BEST time travel. I'm perfect health, lot energy, etc. I'm really really angry....fuck fuck everything sad reality lot people going need mental help past year. going take people really long time get back ""normal"" get greatly reduced symptoms vaccinated. greatly reduced hospitalizations deaths. people deeply invested media coronavirus story refuse acknowledge natural infection contributes herd immunity. build back better, ofcourse. pause then? pay anything help Pfizer BioNTech develop anything.

You guys ordered coaches wearing masks NFL theatre mandating vaccines too. know fact coaches wearing things anywhere camera like locker room practices. Plus surrounded 50+ dudes wearing them, optics force coaches wear one. I've heard family friend who's fully vaccinated comfortable around fully vaccinated people - *outdoors*. point, deciding life outside four walls home over? truly understand. Agreed, sort like biological version trolley problem. There's gotta they're telling us ""rare clotting"" severe iron weighs shortage country, took year recover believe even tho get vaccinated still catch covid spread unvaccinated people, won‚Äôt symptomatic risk death. think that‚Äôs continue wearing masks, least public, indefinitely. yet known long vaccine efficacy lasts 100% prevents getting (immunity). yeah.

There modifications comfortable mask though, like buying certain masks supposedly comfortable. would make question draftees. wouldn‚Äôt draft anybody sard wouldn‚Äôt get vaccine. Romper room over. It‚Äôs time science. left competition behind, airport. unless resident qualify. current stage vaccinations invitation still working priority groups elderly, severe medical conditions healthcare personnel. We'll fine. Places like Sweden Florida proof need make drastic changes lives coronavirus. Texas proving same. gyms banned. Alcohol cigar vaccines get baby never again?? month seven turn zombies It‚Äôs temporary pause see outcome investigation FDA is. effectiveness J&amp;J vaccine South African variant isn‚Äôt question. paid 100 million dollars JOINTLY help develop vaccine don‚Äôt suddenly get claim work didn‚Äôt essentially fund entire project. people dont realize flu shot usually somewhere 20%-40% effective every year. I‚Äôm man *nobody know* got vaccine me. found eligible made appointments shots. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated others know getting first shot Garbage. 

The UK blocking exports. UK exports components European manufacturing plants allow vaccines made there. UK based company position supply vaccines externally yet still fulfilling existing obligations. need access indoor gym exercise. michael jackson vaccine made moonwalk, I'd take heartbeat. Scomo, you? There's logic statement. vaccine readily available whoever wants someone consciously decides take it, going spread anything people get vaccinated. Therefore mandatory vaccinations anyone supports people showing authoritarian controlling side. vast majority people age groups risk death already vaccinated. incapable exerting kind significant effect, arguing vaccines work. must put something politician's vaccines. ;) It‚Äôs totally cool hate straight men nowadays, particularly cis variety. democrats wonder barely win elections vast majority Americans support leftist economic policy.  Please send anything need us. Signed: Brazil. Thank you. starting worry second shot mishandled something.  guess one things trying find pause takes time. AZ EU countries pausing vaccination vaccine something EMA tried find could correlated birth control pills data conclusive. That's several countries limited use 50+ time being, beginning May, time investigate. assume investigation, suspect easy find meaningful correlations 6 cases 7 million. may simply case findings statistically significant number low even occur demographic. Word agree. would cool though unvaccinated people weren‚Äôt able spread everyone else, especially people can‚Äôt get legitimate medical reasons. Plus that‚Äôs mutates. Hopefully doesn‚Äôt mutate faster vaccines. something impacted unvaccinated person wouldn‚Äôt care all, impacts everyone. need vaccinated attend public school don‚Äôt problem adding vaccine mandatory list school, college, private business wants implement like sports arenas concerts. hope find way securely implement vaccine passport personally don‚Äôt need around unvaccinated people chose skip it. MS vaccinated treatment might fully protective me. I‚Äôve locked away full year point stay locked away another person‚Äôs personal choice, think it‚Äôs fair personal choice also make ineligible certain places like concerts. It‚Äôs choice all. Yeah, expect opened phases border probably reopened Labor Day effective enough us stop using masks finally even apparently effective enough stop spread covid according CDC. ""lessens symptoms"" say even technically vaccine according them. Pfizer develop tho. BioNTech did. latter much point FDA finished investigation, somehow know safe is.

It's probability. underlying issue. specific group may impacted average human?

Come on, man. needs investigation. Sorry hear.

Not trying minimize experience grateful struggle breathe talk friends had. best way surpress negative news. ;) I'm hour south city everyone around getting Pfizer! Interesting. discussion genocide right? that's why. agree piece shit, obvious. Nowhere require proof vaccination. We're regressing 1940s Germany papers end requiring that. Even digital something. said anything **completely** safe? main problem seems people think vaccines (or drugs) even thing. lack able think terms probabilities causing us covid deaths day. Maybe older population getting vaccinated, make young overconfident contribution increase cases hospitalisation. Pro-vaxxers shambles FDA follow protocol.

They want win anti-vaxxers wayyy much. wonder, 
if another reality Covid needed vaccine, 
but pandemic we‚Äôve experienced it, 
AND mRNA vaccine never thing, 
would JJ/AZ approved viable vaccine going usual 10+ development period. Museums open. correct explicit orders close kind facilities subject restrictions like limit public gatherings, made impossible remain open. Many museums reopening online booking system order keep visitors required limit. Germany it‚Äôs mandatory wear FPP2 everywhere can‚Äôt socially distance 1.5m said need vaccines get proper herd immunity, do, unless want start digging graves. suggestion can't reach without though, that's made friend. mess? problem really small resolved soon. incomparable problem AZ. currently used mRNA vaccines functionally identical. simple mRNA code build protein: classic prefusion-locked spike protein. Moderna's 100ùúág dose BNT 30 ùúág, also use different lipid shells mRNA, require freezing slightly different temperatures.

Moderna working several different ""upgrades"" parallel. new lipid shell would refrigerator-stable, B.1.351 spike, multivalent spike (I think mix vaccines basically, could slightly complex piece code make proteins), RBD+NTD-only spike. various levels trial, sadly hugely big ones really doing. BNT made similar announcements safe bet they're working things.

A central question dosage. 30 100 ùúág doses chosen really make sure work, clearly do. could 10 ùúág doses we'd instantly jump hundreds millions doses month quite billions. Again, large trials this, appears aren't.

There's also CureVac mRNA vaccine currently trials bit different: spike nucleocapsid proteins. It'll interesting see results - could either best vaccine worst.

I assume ARCoV vaccine simply copy so-called open source mRNA code used BNT Moderna, seen confirmation. Hopefully uses locked prefusion spike.

mRNA coding entirely infancy, program currently know write ""make protein"". amount variation see pretty limited. Came ask this. rollercoaster 2 months. take big time. Mine sore two days soreness went away entirely third, like nothing happened. odd welcome. Efficacy reduction whatever amount risk would begin with. 50/50 chance catch conversation without vaccine, one 95% efficacy reduces 50% 95% 2.5% chance. situation formerly 75% chance infection, brings 3.75%. relative. Huh? Maybe demand falling because... y'know, people already got it? thought. Got it. Pope onboard I‚Äôm unsure ‚Äúreligious objection‚Äù coming from. seems it‚Äôs people don‚Äôt want whatever reason run legitimate excuses. this, also far likely develop blood clots (among nasty things) contract covid (something like 1 10) getting J&amp;J vaccine (1 million, thereabouts). matter risk assessment.  Easy someone who's job depend things open say. delivery promising Canada? :(  Thank you! I‚Äôm right you. actually messaged doctor today go back original dosage anti-depressants I‚Äôm position decrease right now. got vaccine yesterday morning.

This afternoon heard someone say risk blood clots vaccine MUCH less risk blood clots birth control pills. Although haven‚Äôt verified yet, made feel much better. Yaz years guess ended pretty bad lot women. try unless want inexplicably rise vp level.  Congrats! 2nd little rough (started 10hrs post shot), suuuuuper happy fully vaccinated. get chills/etc remember good sign. Shows body ready kick crap spec COVID comes way. said, hope easy - good luck!! I'm sorry. mean sincerely. I'm happy got vaxed mine schedule soon well. Take care safe. Oh mean sense, thought meant studies found antibodies took different amounts time develop two shots.

I mean guess week faster? Lots places even following official schedule various reasons, probably could get results administering Moderna 3 weeks too, based schedules run studies. perspective big deal 2 weeks first shot, get decent protection illness good protection serious disease/death. timing booster varying week matter much. like two groups constantly lumped together.

Thinking choosing unvaccinated everyone else chance get vaccinated personal choice, therefore able reopen without vaccine passports *not* anti-vaxx. *And* require specialized dry ice storage.

Over year ago begging 67% effective vaccine 90+% hospitalization reduction. Sure mRNA vaccines effective got I'm privileged enough live country them.

If country J&amp;J would gotten heartbeat. Talk COVID-19 hit world stage would thought J&amp;J-like vaccine would highest efficacy humanity could come would undoubtedly end pandemic. Bump According paper published Cell, special coating used vaccine allows stored regular freezer time, help distribution vaccine rural areas. OK good
Thank you. US handles worst, buys salvation. guess February Immunocompromised people take vaccine. did. cases blood clots (I assume biologically assigned birth) women aged 18-48. 

it's also 6 cases 6.8 million, chances absymally small especially listed demographic.  sauce Buffalo people use? Blue cheese? No, evidence low platelet count vaccination. issue AZ (they calling VIPIT VITT), EMA would noticed many patients history low platelet counts. Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) clots caused autoimmune reaction.   ... slightly higher rate expected.  Pfizer still appears stop spread SA variant. that's Canadians make crappy allies.
If hurt us. will. 
But they'll happily take stuff. 

Us gov acting best interest citizens visitors (anyone get vaccinated states. free. Anyone)
Is acting bad faith. normal thing do. 
Glad shoes foot. Canada help us. thing do. One many million doses statistically significant. noise. can‚Äôt make choice yourself? Thanks, fine even get sick, worth little bit discomfort know protected. temperature jumped 99.6F tonight, breaking body aches lessening hours now. I'm starting feel like get good sleep, I'll back normal tomorrow. ""compassionate"" liberals everyone. People probably less likely go places require vaccination. Thanks! say person given one dose? 11.5% given two doses person given one dose. course given one dose given two. That's two given time. means period (now) many people given one dose waiting correct time given second dose. month large number people given one dose earlier year given second dose. Yep. near West Chester, appointments disappear moment they're listed. looked York hundreds sitting open. We're fortunate enough car capability take 4 hours day, drove there.

Also congrats first dose! guess joking, think beetroot, especially beetroot juice, especially good choice this. case beetroot juice, worry long keeps. Radish keeps long time fridge comes naturally divided small pieces. room celery lots recipies... - look high nitrate vegetables web choose taste.  Many state governors following CDC recommendations Biden administration's guidelines creating restrictions. thing goes private businesses.

If messaging change point, we're gonna enter horrible situation governors refuse remove restrictions CDC removes guidelines, CDC refuses remove guidelines they're incredibly conservative recommendations. 

Illinois example provided full reopening plan include lifting mask mandate. waiting CDC remove recommendation.

And end result increased vaccine hesitancy. massive group people sick ""Get vaccinated nothing changes life"" messaging. happens, private companies take matters hands, tech giant end creating vaccine passports. personally want see happen. There's long people this. Ahh, sure minimum incubation rate might be. makes sense, thanks! Well, they're using technology. probable they'll very, similar efficacy. Plot twist: time extra doses arrive, 20% Americans antivaxx dismantled Canada's Conservative Party, Harper, ideology. Team mRNA 4 Life perfectly fine still developing antibodies. plenty indications government would act good faith. don‚Äôt think blame making deals did. reason think we‚Äôd get shit together vaccine rollout. responded conditions saw

I also think cross-border recriminations make cooperation shared interests difficult. much pharmaceutical industry longer North America hurts us shared interest correcting that. Public health issues don‚Äôt stop borders Canadians different us except national identity negatively defined us  Ask r/masks4all lot solutions 1.5 million doses sent ahead schedule March, 5 million doses sent ahead schedule mild allergic reaction IV contrast decade ago. rushed gave shot benadryl fine. realize could actually die it. care tourism industry vote seems.. Please give Canada! No. side effects literally immune response. People getting fevers getting low fevers. Despite everyone thread saying 1 dose might safer J&amp;J, nobody knows all, medical professionals saying bad idea, probably true. reason mRNA vaccines 2 shots first place J&amp;J 1 latter exhibited much stronger immune response first shot early trials.

The chance still getting Covid 1 dose likely severe complications pregnancy much higher reaction severe enough second dose would matter all. People getting fevers like maybe 100 shot, almost everyone symptomatic Covid gets fevers like 102+ roll strategy cases, rolled believe optimal strategy granting safety people reducing deaths. think 3 weeks Pfizer shots 4 weeks Moderna happened nanny dad got first dose.
! ended totally fine said worth sure. think happened covid month first shot. Ahh sorry misinterpreted statement. I've seen lot anti vaxxers trying justify getting vaccine using Spanish Flu example Oh boy, can't wait see good I've finished Pfizer doses. get frequent PVCs, couplets, sometimes short runs called NSVT. muscles started twitching 4.5 years ago, call benign fasciculations. Primarily legs feet constantly. years later got new job week daughter developed epilepsy. Stress went roof thyroid went wack developed heart issues. Thyroid quickly got back normal, heart never did.

I'm told everything benign, unrelenting really impacts quality life can't sleep heart flopping around. Happy though many things could related much worse things. trying keep keeping girls. Male, why? meaning someone *not* getting side effects? Maybe, things promising. Speaking fact poisons impact actually fact studies prove it.

It potential game changer novel viruses, cancer, HIV, hard-to-treat hard-to-vaccinate-against illnesses. two guy late 30s maybe girl 45ish. vaguely mentioned clots.  don‚Äôt really know details them. can‚Äôt speak religions, Muslim scholars made unequivocally clear mRNA vaccines entirely permissible there‚Äôs reason get them. 

Some argue J&amp;J/AZ vaccines due use stem cells production process, still issue guidance take that‚Äôs option available individual. reason disagree know long term effects covid well. possible vaccines could long term effects Covid could well. male female? actually read study 900 infections referring to, accepting numbers. handy I'd like read it. person replying suggested need vaccines reach herd immunity. pointed case Spanish Flu. ""Patients would injected working copies gene attached adenovirus, type cold virus. virus, altered harmless, would infect patients‚Äô liver cells integrate added gene chromosomal DNA.""

I've seen enough people take information wildly context weaponize throughout pandemic. paragraph almost reads like could origins ""Vaccines change DNA"" thing I've heard repeatedly people refusing *any* potential vaccine.

Not intentions all, seeing anything particular sub uses wording plays hands science skeptics makes cringe pretty hard know certain anti-virus subs brigade lurk one particular. Ah yes, golden rule mismanagement. It‚Äôs Brands‚Ñ¢Ô∏è¬©Ô∏è¬ÆÔ∏è baby. Almost fully vaccinated excited see less cautious friends next weeks year challenging distance. (had?) anti-vax friend, STG starts spouting ‚Äútold so‚Äù bullshit, without looking risk clots women face hormonal birth control, childbirth, uhh covid itself....

The people shouted life without risks people posting snarky shit Facebook. Anyway, time new friends. true all. Delhi live reached 60% people infected. Yet getting slammed new variant 80% similar SA variant. Yup, one mid 30s another mid 60s. bad know song South Park? Except many governors businesses openly state restrictions ""per CDC guidelines.""

We've allowed masks social distancing become politicized, disagreeing CDC seen far right radicalism.

Meanwhile we're happy reopen restaurants go eat despite CDC guidelines. 

Pretty soon we're gonna enter horrible situation governors businesses CDC get standoff hoping party remove restrictions first. Meanwhile vaccine hesitation gonna keep rising people get fed messaging of, ""Get vaccinated keep following restrictions guidelines,"" we're gonna see places support privatized domestic vaccine passports alternative restrictions. women? actually negative credibility - whatever says likely false. literally assume opposite says 99% cases.

You're going lot variation. Smaller communities still likely reach higher vaccine percentages first due lower overall population less logistical challenges reaching entire population. 


What want see well numbers hold see natural immunity vaccine immunity end putting dent COVID. We'll see. I've posted times before, standards applied medical regulatory bodies counter-intuitive, particularly subscribe utilitarian approach ethics.

When look utilitarian lens risk profile vaccines question, there's scenario risk vaccine outweighs risk contracting COVID. approval boards like FDA really operate pure risk calculus - implied viewpoint (not COVID, approval issues well) better let hundred people die ""naturally"" let one person die via human agency (administering drug vaccine).

I'm really making value judgement it, interesting real-world ethics experiment prefer hundred deaths disease preferable single death caused human agency.

And much sequencing Canada sure? honey sweet ignore. want communist honey, yum yum got Johnson &amp; Johnson past Saturday. evening time exhausted fell asleep woke chills bad headache. headache lasted Sunday night woke Monday morning feeling fine. Tuesday arm still sore. likely this.  


Though suspect good weather encourages outdoor activity less dense population (Texas huge, making even large cities quite spacious less congested) make big difference. 


The vaccine, natural immunity, 2 factors putting dent spread. We'll see holds. really got great breakdown risks covid/long covid.

the idea living brain fog 2+ years more. seems worse death.

Still people able make informed decisions health. quality sinovac sinopharm still hard me. Let's honest here, china vaccines choice countries zero options left. given choice, would still prefer quality vaccines western companies. Yes, also burnout 10 years ago say yet recognizes early symptoms knows time stop. Buffalo Bills (well, accurately, county executive Mark Poloncarz) actually announced games vaccinated-only season. literally Moderna, got 0 Pfizer Biontech

Without university Pennsylvania NIH we'd neither. 

Kinda EU unable develop tech.

Sorry euros can't find angle. Face it. read article? originally Central Ohio, lives Florida now. 

""Mary-Kate, 36 weeks pregnant, got first round Moderna vaccine. Three weeks later, Addison born. Days birth, Addison‚Äôs blood tested.""

Sounds kind like person first article shared. merely misleading. outright false. Wait, trying say? OP saying Water blue, saying blue colour water saying guess proves point. untested. Well, kinda true.

Those ruined batched arent J&amp;J fault, under-delivery even remotely bad AZ. Note mRNA vaccin produced reliably J&amp;J Moderna vaccins, kinda is. 

There loads valid reasons know read headlines. 

But, get point. 10000% good thing.

Problems happen. important earnest it.

We endured covid year. endure weeks.

Let's introduce new problem mix. country produce vaccine, Federal government done decent job sourcing vaccines. may situation oversupply AZ vaccine. Meanwhile Europe available regular folk till least next year. Noice. It‚Äôs like arguing fiber optic developed talking streaming services. Fact without Biontech, would vaccine fast would something else. Canadian here. Hey hear got extra doses? getting vaccinated inherently *not* personal choice. Vaccinations work population level, individual level. instance, that's measles suddenly reappeared pockets vaccine resistance.

I hope get good vaccine numbers without needing passports, I'm really opposed large events like this. Chinese govt shady bout virus needs held accountable. biotech industry wayyy ahead western world  city, that's why.

Moderna seems going rural areas (which best way it, since rural hospitals deep freezing capacity).

In county 100,000 people spread 20,000 square miles, pretty much Moderna Every adult eligible vaccine April 19th, that‚Äôs month get vaccinated one attends. Furthermore, I‚Äôd shocked Vegas wouldn‚Äôt packed Memorial Day weekend regardless EDC. It‚Äôs getting old people keep panicking large events happening vaccine rollout going strong elderly/at-risk given ample time get vaccine. mRNA developed?
University Pennsylvania. 
They patent. Licence Moderna Pfizer. 

WRONG really bad people claim. Much Europe approaching 20% first doses second doses far behind sticking tested intervals 3-6 weeks jabs. Speed picking considerably second quarter, I'd surprised get around 50% end Q2. always going difficult vaccinate 450M people single country like Israel UK. Especially Europe producing global supply countries hog theirs. Every age certain chance hospitalization. Many countries gotten used apply brakes hospitals full.

If vaccinate old let rip hospitals full... Oh surprise get full hospitals, old people.

Brazil shit stain president, btw, believe brakes. Wrong. Biontech Germany made mrna Pfizer helped logistica sales etc.

‚ÄúBefore messenger RNA multibillion-dollar idea, scientific backwater. Hungarian-born scientist behind key mRNA discovery, career Utter nonsense.

Moderna USA developed vaccin, uses mRNA.

But Pfizer/Biontech also mRNA vaccin developed Biontech.
Biontech European company, vaccin heavily funded EU, USA. 

Remember vaccin Trump tried buy exclusively US? one exactly.

Note Pfizer/Biontech actually developed Turkish immigrant Germany, there's also.

Now, Moderna impressive vaccin. I'm saying USA accomplished anything, have. guys faster rolling vaccins us. Moderna important vaccin, since January.

And I'm probably correct Pfizer 'European', since also produced heavily USA India. 

But 'The USA better' bravado unfounded. Sorry point out. Gyms consistently shown higher risk environments spread. plenty ways work without going gym.

Check /r/bodyweightfitness I'm expert simple.

As far read JJ uses underlying mechanism AZ. So, take precaution, good.

I'm expert though, thought making fun anti-vaxxers decades trusting experts.

Now experts want, decide want ignore them? /u/marimm91 trying say UK delaying second doses prioritize first doses. That's one reasons able reach high rates first doses. Canada also delaying second doses prioritize first doses. Canada significantly behind UK vaccine rollout. 

In Canada said willing let people wait 4 months second dose (I believe Pfizer Moderna, I'm sure vaccines).  work factory, heavy lifting day. Could contributed soreness.  I'm hours south got Pfizer Walgreens, they're distributing I've watching waiting situation Brazil improve long seems worse every day. horribly tragic kinda scary find wondering rest world next. assure Ontario variant spreading across Michigan border lmao.

Source: live Sarnia, Ontario appreciate info. hope well side globe!  would said mild couple days ago, cold thing honestly pretty miserable factually incorrect. government literally administering vaccines almost fast they‚Äôre coming in. 

We‚Äôve 300k doses/day past days think previous infection protects reinfection cases, age groups, (see recent Lancet paper variants (some variants likely escape immune system others) 

From Lancet article: 'In alternative cohort analysis, among aged 65 years older, observed protection repeat infection 47¬∑1% (95% CI 24¬∑7‚Äì62¬∑8). found difference estimated protection repeat infection sex (male 78¬∑4% [72¬∑1‚Äì83¬∑2] vs female 79¬∑1% [73¬∑9‚Äì83¬∑3]) evidence waning protection time (3‚Äì6 months follow-up 79¬∑3% [74¬∑4‚Äì83¬∑3] vs ‚â•7 months follow-up 77¬∑7% [70¬∑9‚Äì82¬∑9]).' Banning *foreign* spectators. Japanese people cannot spread dirty gaikoku virus, safe. /s experience happens native German kids well. gf's parents fight would send lower study path.

I actually like system early life child doors closed. caught corona one whole week first dose, obviously assuming pretty protected reality. reputable news outlet would that. medicine key victory virus.  Hong Kong, vaccinated people 56% male. Hong Kong elsewhere, health workers disproportionately female women live longer. female preponderance universal, explanations need relate male female tendencies local culture, US elsewhere. mean literally 6 6.8 million cares them? I'm glad issue called experts gets proper investigation.

I care whether vaccine safe.

Provaxxers like ""oh no, can't say anything bad vaccine"". fucking cares? want blood clot covid. 

Don't anti-vaxx, also pro-vaxxers. produced vaccine short timeline. Problems expected.

Am taking crazy pills set country back massively? I‚Äôm fully vaccinated soon, feels pointless get thrown another lockdown. math completely wrong group makes 20% total population makes much higher amount people receiving J&amp;J vaccine. 

The vaccine given children, elderly received mRNA vaccines already, women vaccinated men. proportion women aged 20-50 received J&amp;J much 19% (and I'd venture guess 50%)

That even get covering fact excluding people group equation may valid since rare event likely enough statistical power say random chance young women point Olympic Village Virus Village. Yeah 'no ban all'

all government offer assistance companies vaccines produced US given US citizens first. taking care plan offer aid countries. 

I'm sorry Canada needs USA wipe ass. that's case, vaccine makers providers dispatching shots say something effect? I've never came across appointment questionnaire even asked things. none elderly people know asked existing medications.

I‚Äôve pill 7 years, prior starting pill anxiety depression, tried different hormone combinations found one didn‚Äôt seem significant impact mood.

Prior pill severe cramping, went 5+ super tampons day days ruined countless pairs underwear, slept towels, etc.

Since starting pill period comes every Thursday placebo week gone following Monday. light rarely filled regular tampon switched menstrual cup. otherwise unprotected sex, also track fertility I‚Äôm pill use condom highest risk, loose time take pill.

I enjoy taking pill. feel low-risk unwanted pregnancy, less burdened periods use pill skip periods come inconvenient time, still get periods feel less anxious monthly validation birth control methods working!

I worry sometimes long-term side effects pill, point cannot know future, know cost-benefits experiencing now, I‚Äôm really enjoying control feel have.

I hope married next years ready come birth control, start trying kids. I‚Äôm done kids, I‚Äôll see body at, periods manageable, I‚Äôll probably ask husband get vasectomy, explore options birth control.

But now, genuinely enjoy taking pill. seatbelts cars. surprise, many opting vaccine. Flu lot different covid terms mutability. Given everything we've seen far, huge overreaction misstep. extend pandemic causes blood clots higher percentage. idiotic decision making hell talking about? made story told like it‚Äôs true. get big man?! really like I'm seeing numbers New York can't wait flat-line weeks. No, because
1) affects younger women. vaccinate older people AZ JJ people think even making announcement evil.
2) vaccines don‚Äôt cause blood clots, young people still get those.
3) Even young people didn‚Äôt get vaccine, we‚Äôd reach herd immunity eventually people 40+ getting young people already gotten COVID, died (which pretty much them), antibodies.

You literally angry government won‚Äôt give people life-threatening blood clots. nothing remotely bad decision. totally believe cronyism played decision making process. equally believe world reason sing praise UK vaccine success. ""A broken clock right twice day"", yes. Even happened right place right, UK done well.

Cronyism bad, Tories bad, buy things, world black-and-white declare Tory success due cronyism success. one 3 million. one million occurence. That's called luck lol. women even reliably regular cycle.  Netherlands plant

Underrated comment right would mean would observe lot specific thrombosis events also Covid 19 cases. could well case. data this. 2 weeks first dose, damn feels good. 3 weeks till ""fully vaccinated"". gonna lick many doorknobs looking one dose Pfizer instead recommended two doses. would interested see second dose Pfizer changes analysis. Reschedule next week couple weeks. I'd play safe personally. age groups False, vaccinated 1.8% population. 13.3% one dose There's 6 cases right now, bit presumptuous instantly claim there's link gender age 6 people still definitely within realm coincidence. Love posts, thanks I'm aware of, adenovirus vector vaccines seen limited use (Ebola vaccine). never ""possibly dangerous old people"". know effective old people old immune system good new anymore.

But effective. allowing adult accepts risks take shot anyway AZ? Nah dude, probably much PEDs systems blood toxic virus. I‚Äôm becoming actively distressed way downplaying effectiveness vaccines. couple weeks demand falls precipitously really going regret this. want take pay cut, return office *will* function pay cut. Commuting adds hour workday absolute minimum, gas involved costs money increases carbon footprint, parking near job nightmare costs upwards $5/day, getting lunch expensive packing lunch work eats time clock.

Monthly adds 20+ hours, $200-300 expenses, 300+ miles car (which also expands carbon footprint). That's pay cut. even deal childcare costs; numbers I've heard people *do* deal made throw mouth. kind perverse thinking parent stepping back corporate commute getting bombarded ""omg yay we're back normal"" go back hemorrhaging away kid's future tuition. that. wrong almost hurts Netherlands using AZ 60-65 year olds expect quit using AZ group done. Countries low death rates lose vaccinating. ""dry tinder"".  AZ vaccine design gives emphasis toward heightened T-cell response, previously shown generate weaker Antibody stronger T-cell response vs pfizer/BioNtech. One reason heterelogous prime boost combination adenoviral vaccine mRNA may especially well suited

The results demonstrated correlates previously realized large-scale real world data similar age groups showing AZ seemed induce higher protection hospitilization Pfizer/BionTech ( compared one dose) 

Four weeks person first dose Oxford jab, scientists Scotland found reduced hospital admissions 94 per cent. received Pfizer jab 85 per cent less likely admitted hospital (sample size 1.14 million vaccinees)

We arrive quite interesting junction, whereas one hand currently AZ adenovirus vaccines general represented second rate subpar restricted administered countries across age groups population scale individual-level signals heightened risk certain age groups; however terms net reduction illness high spread environment (at least ancestral/b117 lineage)

 country-scale real world data might actually play AZ vaccinated cohort may *less* likely overall hospitilized, even they're likely become infected, confounding cost-benefit-analyis somewhat. certainly see regions instead ploughing full steam ahead mRNA , however going interesting long run see different vaccine decisions made stack up, terms lives saved life lost Tomorrow 8 days, debating canceling dentist appointment tomorrow... get 1 million number from? According Danish health agencies 1 40.000 Norway even higher 1 25.000. predictions always right let change fact too. Seems like might good idea 3 months ago, worth effort change now. We're probably couple weeks away supply outpacing demand. either donated covax sold Sweden/Finland He‚Äôs living total fear. He‚Äôs coward. Instead acting fearful he‚Äôs living denial. else frequenting corona virus subreddit truly believes it‚Äôs another cold? They‚Äôre like this. 16 percent US counties. really terrible.

Also, take issue definition surplus:

""As April 5th, 847 counties least one appointment available local CVS, Rite-Aid Walmart pharmacy.""

How know that's getting filled point? far push looking appointments? He's wrong fact SA variant may able reinfected though. Vaccines also less effective (not _ineffective_, less effective). countries researched manufactured vaccine vaccinated citizens, countries *didn't* research manufacture vaccine some. people still confused this? moronic move six month Pfizer Moderna six months data phase three trial start continue monitor. means least six+ months six months. 

It‚Äôs can‚Äôt say long last need data make claim. could last year even 5 plus years. 

SARS 1 antibodies believe lasted 2-3 years cell response observed even 15 years. got clots recovered though, math wrong. death main concern get covid. imagine various deniers would also deny long covid. study one shot. thought already knew mRNA vaccines don‚Äôt great cellular immunity one shot, 2. I'm skeptical vaccines. fully vaccinated yesterday. asked particular vaccine fantastic OP stated. saying amazing medical breakthrough comparatively great one given good argument particular shot fantastic. completely empathize. I‚Äôm US parents got first dose Pfizer, made sick whole week don‚Äôt want go back second dose still leaves vulnerable don‚Äôt. don‚Äôt know talk miserable experience, feel vaccine suppose prevent feeling like they‚Äôre convinced they‚Äôve given shot covid. Mistrust everywhere. blood clots linger around body isn‚Äôt inevitable block someplace else near future? Scott Montgomery Way Sad, great vaccine think needs evaluated based upon getting serious blood clots leading CSVT (women child bearing age mostly) risk COVID mortality begin with. Young, healthy women pre-existing conditions large least impacted group COVID outside 9 year olds. doesn‚Äôt make sense take vaccine severe illness death rate certain demographic group near, seriously ill death rate COVID demographic group.

And spreading, going assumption older people, e.g. 55+ older, immune compromised conditions already vaccinated vaccinated. They‚Äôre large risk factor tbh still eligible AZ J&amp;J vaccines. AZ still approved SwissMedic though. believe current planning include AZ anymore. really pisses off. rocked vaccination, saw poster saying ‚ÄúWe using AstraZeneca vaccine today‚Äù thought ‚Äúwell fuck.‚Äù

I‚Äôm getting less effective vaccine enough health concerns countries refusing use it. Fanfuckingtastic. news Canada receiving fewer expected doses live France (but I‚Äôm British). vaccine roll fucking terrible everything read biggest reason huge case death numbers France didn‚Äôt lockdown like U.K. schools open week ago. restaurants cinemas curfew life basically ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. speak anecdotally almost everyone know acts like virus isn‚Äôt big deal. parties. Get together meals. Hell neighbours birthday party two weeks ago 40 people daughters birthday! 

What I‚Äôm saying, Boris U.K. government says, lockdown helped crush numbers U.K. far vaccine far. U.K. locked hard January France twiddled it‚Äôs thumbs curfews week ago. It‚Äôs surprise France shocking numbers close nothing possible sadly.

While vaccine doubt helped think biggest impact U.K. numbers right three months hard lockdown starting come of. wish France done same.  believe 80 percent ten days first shot. Yes, males females side effects affect women.  mean pfizer moderna stock price rise alittle? hope so. feel two doses? pronounced side effects already COVID? vaccine point contention familly. Everyone family received shots Pfizer. I'm one vaccinated sister mom pressuring get it. appointment J&amp;J last week psyched beforehand (if appt week later, cancel). 

Why I've ambivalent getting vaccine I'm one family COVID. mild case last July took serology test last week. came back positive antibodies, though nurse said levels low encouraged get vaccine. offered hypothetical ""if antibody levels high, would guidance same?"" said yes shots. remember Pfizer-BioNTech dismissed storage-related logistics. Look fly now. So, send bridge Sweden don‚Äôt actually give shit. I‚Äôve stuck house year want get hyped vaccine US hit harder corona country. need doses far place low infection/death rates Side effects occur overindulge them. specifically describe consumption limits every pack.

Vaccines formulated span 9 months problems? Well.. colour surprised. Lmfao. maybe recognize fewer people dying good, widespread use vaccines result fewer people dying reality vaccines used good thing. Osterholm talking Canada regards hurricanes? 2 billion doses ordered EU - matter increased production allowing earlier delivery.  way dinosaurs eventually became chickens birds enough generations. Eventually, virus mutate enough longer resemble think coronavirus. full J&amp;J use AZ all, certainly (best-case scenario).

With full J&amp;J use AZ 60+, probably (likely scenario).

With J&amp;J AZ 60+, possibly news (likely scenario).

If use one two vector vaccines probably not, even news (worst-case scenario). study right mask compliance longer issue. think good reporting.

It's crazy idea. Search around see doctors suspecting sure looks good say ""Hey think vaccines dangerous citizens, poor however matter go"" 

It look good perfect world actually 100% correct.

AstraZeneca bad vaccine. It'll save millions lives it'll cost hundred lives.

I mean can't possibly obvious trolley problem solution, get stuck again. Yep. You‚Äôre big pharma bots lmao Curevac also start Q2. would make sense, Youyang Gu's final prediction showed slowly rising uptick infections peaking April 10th, looks like Michigan least slowing peaking. heard somewhere younger patients often stay hospital longer older people usually die sooner, explain hospitalizations decreasing. credibility this? What‚Äôs education level?  anyone explain vaccins given men instead women? Since women seem risk deadly side affects. I'd guess that's it. Modern medicine amazing! Yes j&amp;j vaccine pretty incredible look fact speed developed efficacy. guess point compared vaccines, seem fantastic. UK good June receive pending doses.
By May end Pfizer delivered doses contract US. doubt thta doses go waste. Lots neighbouring countries happily take them. Countries higher covid rates older population calculation comes different. AZ? recent (few days) stopped 30s. Denmark Europe pretty ridiculous. Halting life saving vaccine 1 millions chance blood clotting utterly immoral truly demonstrates draconian damaging patients medical regulators be. 8 triggered people downvoted go fly kite. I‚Äôm entitled opinion. like you. dead person isn‚Äôt. administering vaccine results 10 deaths administering results 1,000 would hope choice would blindingly obvious.

This can‚Äôt people failed trolley problem charge public health. I‚Äôm calling laws mandating it. I‚Äôm saying private company doesn‚Äôt want infecting customers employees mandate I‚Äôm it. think right near anyone infect completely disagree maybe good choice live woods don‚Äôt infect others. want live city suburb refrain anything gets close proximity others, least cases get negligible kids get vaccinated. They‚Äôre probably going COVID Even 5 would enough world - bottleneck would filling logistics then.

But takes build one ground up, reason facility went quickly already certified medical laboratory bought another pharma company. Trump: Glad im America.

Short answer no... already small chance getting virus (a lot less 5%), vaccine, much smaller So, reality, odds getting symptomatic COVID-19 vaccination really 0.04% (not 5%) divide number vaccinated people got sick total number vaccinated people. EMA face saving measure. Truth matter want adenovirus vector vaccines know work well. Leave monkey virus monkeys! Already Covid well Pfizer doses.

Can confirm feelings immortality. one said ""completely safe"". even said onset likely people may die vaccine itself. always going rare adverse events. phase 3 trials, blood clots observed. inkling effects vaccine could have. purpose expanded phase trial ensure adverse effect rare nature. one less one million. literally better chance dying covid getting complication jnj. Covid known infect testes, Epidymo-orichitis known secondary infection older male covid patients.

Getting vaccinated likely increase fertility relative infected. would they? everyone‚Äôs premium goes make money Can't nice things ever Without Astrazeneca, Britain happy place today, cases falling deaths falling (there 23 deaths yesterday, UK population 67 million).

Boris Johnson said due harsh lockdown, vaccination program minor role. really don‚Äôt like NYT keeps pushing ‚Äúlet‚Äôs switch prioritizing everyone getting first dose‚Äù strategy. Seems like logistical mess would lead chaos vaccine rollout US already going well. Send UK, we've still go 30 50 years olds vaccinate AZ. Looks like countries doses late again. goals are. 

What think people's goals are? Probably staying shape. feels way high idea talking about. AZ rollout mess Europe. nothing lobbying. already know this. Pfizer much research bthese days. gain revenue proper acquisition. Well see goes. expect see lot people end hospitalized it. really think AstraZeneca one would personally take. I‚Äôm young get country. Early pandemic used wipe everything came house alcohol sanitizing wipes, realized completely paranoid unnecessary. pretty well proven point virus can't transmitted via surfaces like this. Israel's cases rose massively reached 30-40% vaccine coverage. even strict national lockdown place Chile started vaccination program. see many factors play role reducing number infections? Sinovac sure best vaccine there. simply saying nothing saline water wrong.

I would say turning point Chile still lies us. Six instances 7.1 million 0.000014%. risk, extremely low based current numbers. kicked fuss cried moaned UK many! think elephant room ignored here, covid causes far blood clots deaths vaccine ever will. pity - millions people going stuck lockdown months this, thousands probably die get ill too. spent money figuring get people stop overeating exercise more. really easy pick vaccine live first world country 

How us living 3rd, sent vaccine could save lives nothing somehow Pfizer jab get arms ?

This SinoVac difference living dying current pandemic, like not

If worried countries using them, send mRNA vaccines we'll gladly take Yeah, plans can't go wrong make any! Send UK, we'll take them. What? J&amp;J delaying EU launch pending investigation United States. seems real inability assess relative risk countries. seem clinging rigid rules pretending pandemic.

It's telling two countries done vaccinations quick (Israel UK) citizens slip war/blitz mentality everytime crisis, go ""whatever takes"" mode end crisis.

I expect Danes continentals would useless war - they'd arguing nit picking rules got shot. don‚Äôt see kind sentiment? ever see mob like posts mocking people don‚Äôt like work home assert jobs WFH on.

These people bash groups people maintaining friendships members. reason gap big, counted numbers includes figures GGD's. number actually outdated, recent figures estimation, estimation also includes counted GGD figures estimations healthcare facilities, hospitals GP's added top.

Because share GGD vaccinations gotten smaller due GP's vaccinating lot, gap counted estimated number increasing. Boosters variants likely yea.

But thats still smart do, know long vaccine effective.  Oh know. I've trying tell her. Luckily doctor think blood clot hopefully tests come back fine gets conspiracy land absolute waste think little data far assume frequency problems less J&amp;J. 


If vector component issue likely similar due rare need vaccinate tens millions people get good idea, neither USA europe seem keen do. 


If risk turn similar AZ presumably countries suspending restricting AZ J&amp;J would big blow many european vaccination schedules.

However museums closed certain periods depending local conditions restrictions. appears museums opening limited numbers pre-sale ticket system order comply new regulations came effect March 11. Shoes true colors Honestly, view NYC data past 1-2 months encouraging sign difficult cases/hospitalizations move anywhere going forward. Despite variants running wild throughout city economy re-opened anytime pandemic, case positivity/hospitalizations stable nowhere even close levels seen initial 2020 surge. 

The level natural immunity partial vaccination (probably ~70% point) clearly limiting ability virus spread going get difficult head summer majority folks complete vaccination series. 

We're ~3,000 confirmed/probable cases per day right numbers finally moved downtrend...wouldn't surprised see permanently fall &lt;300 June. It‚Äôs men dangerous jobs update figures since Saturday/Sunday. Also, last 10 days, reported vaccinations done GP's and/or AZ vaccinations. added figures total. also made correction. Previously assumed spillage 5%, turns incorrect. spillage turned around 1%, added another 65,000 vaccinations.

And using estimations? messed up. many different systems. Spead covid vaccinated people result mostly mild symptoms. know want heard immunity yadda yadda yadda, vaccinated people getting sniffles oh well!

That‚Äôs inconsistent notion vaccinated people unlikely carry virus. 

I don‚Äôt get it. Everyone saying months you‚Äôre vaccinated still won‚Äôt immediate snap back pre-pandemic life. period adjustment. Well, period adjustment arrives everyone acts like public health folks suddenly lying. years that, 1999 Ingmar Hoerr Curevac doctorate mRNA vaccines started Curevac after.

I agree COVID entirely unnecessary, disease bad enough (e.g. something like smallpox), would 100% expect support public health policy forced vaccinations - including showing folks doors threatening fines detention failure vaccinate without clear medical exclusion grounds. 

The idea people unlimited right perpetuate disease - direct violation non-aggression principle underpins individual-rights oriented approach governing - ridiculous thought. 

(This something happened US rightfully so. approach great (for example, night raids gunpoint), principle sound. Smallpox joke, refusing get vaccinated greatly increased risk killing around - whether wished not. also remember health official speculating NJ cases might caused NYC air blowing across Hudson River Bay. mean, infectious entire world would caught couple weeks. risk 1/100000

Can haz mure vaccines? sheem lot plis? gave good chuckle lol tho? Pfizer/Moderna preferable Sinopharm/Sinovac/CanSino.

Sinopharm higher efficacy AZ (70% vs 79-86%) less side effect serious complication like AZ.

Sinovac similar efficacy JnJ (~60%), JnJ give 85% protection severe case Sinovac give 100% moderate severe. mention recent serious complication related JnJ

CanSino single dose vaccine similar JnJ protection moderate severe case (90%++).

Chinese vaccine fall short compared mRNA vaccine, China process making mRNA. CDC probably right cautious, enough information disagree them, 5 people millions likely end mattering. One recipients died, another critical condition. 

U say anything u want, people can't seem able read. might something people look past, Doctors briefed do, FDA satisfied. One related death 7 million doses tad better odds coronavirus. also things going it, one shot, first vaccine kind, there's already Ebola Vaccine uses viral vector.

Secondly, vaccines required schools vetted, FDA approval gone thru neccessary trials prove safe. joke getting old. related death 7 million doses tad better odds coronavirus

It's even considerably better getting struck lightning. 45M here. gone mine Manchester morning. Saw article yesterday saying open 45+, clicked link booked in. Got jabbed 9:15am. Lots friendly helpful staff directing us park go etc. Well said, there's lot nuance balance risk.

I'm country covid, taking vaccine going let us travel - would people bother getting vaccinated wait better product. risk low, exposing risk need.

### Half people England likely Covid antibodies - ONS

An estimated one two people England antibodies coronavirus, according sample population week ending 28 March.

This figure largely unchanged previous two weeks.

Antibodies Covid found body either past infection somebody vaccinated. proteins blood recognise specific infections fight off.

According Office National Statistics, England estimated 54.9% population would tested positive   antibodies blood test week ending 28 March,

This number 49.1% Wales, 54.5% Northern Ireland 46% Scotland.

The ONS said figures varied across regions, West Midlands highest percentage antibody   positivity England, North East lowest.

‚ÄúThere clear pattern vaccination testing positive antibodies, however detection antibodies alone precise measure protection granted vaccines,"" said ONS.

‚ÄúIt possible antibody levels people low detected tests still high enough grant level protection."" tradition well year now. really need PR department. plus lot developing nations majority variants J&amp;J/Astrazenaca dont really work well Think meant 'its chance million, I'm one chance, still right call'. arguments really matter people remember headline, anti-vaxxer social media idiots ignore arguments. literally inside though. confirm.

Heard side effects bad. Curious hear y‚Äôall‚Äôs experience it. issue supply though. enough doses safer vaccines supplementing one might worth even added risk. Although seems Danish authorities disagree. miss easing lockdown restrictions? Anyone remember risk/reward calculation brief? Something like predicted used 200.000 doses, would result 5 cloths save 1 person hospitlization week? Might remember wrong.. *cries Albertan* We‚Äôre health care workers finally people severe health issues.

I might get first shot June maybe? luck might pick covid waiting üòÇ ask different. asked similar. extremely similar.  certainly mean unmasked vaccinated people causing spike whole point back forth. press conference said AZ risk 1 40.000 though, 1 1 million. second number apparently J&amp;J. did... working variant boosters? We're talking 44 year olds though, Denmark giving anyone. working workplace extremely safe. downer vaccine change much me. kids can't get vaccinated, another doom variant every day, still can't go train sport jolly old Dr. Fauci says ok around unvaccinated people without mask. ""take AZ nothing all"" 

Well, lie. gonna 2 years time we're fully back person :( made single friend year get hospitalised COVID, risk blood clots 1:3

Also: pill smoking drastically chances blood clots Going (or above) speed limit conscious decision someone makes knowing risks. issue vaccine given without risks made aware.  

After risks known, let people whatever want. make risks known. 700,000+ cases

Cases? would use word cases? pretty specific meaning anyone clicking through, going confusing hell.

How many deaths 3.5M+ *cases*[sic] Oregon time period? Maybe 200? Pretty hard actually form accurate comparison feel like calculus vaccinated persons curve.

So, we'll go 200. That's number deaths March 1st April 8th. Vaccinations completed prior Jan 18th/Jan 25th (42/35 days prior March 1st) basically negligible.

So puts equivalent unvaccinated number 0.0057%. So, 2 orders magnitude bigger, still also basically nothing?

A number substituted post pretended accurate number, would elicit identical response people number. 


But numbers apples oranges assuming 700k Oregonians received first dose Feb 18th.  Which, obviously, happen.

Let's look different number: 14500. huge number. nothing. That's get take 4.3 x 10^-6 multiply 12 (months year), US population, 0.85 (amount people get vaccinated).

That's number vaccinated people die country using calculated number. perfect number, think makes point ""stop worrying neighbor"" thing flaws.

This disease still spread without hard pushes government, private businesses, individuals across country. still kill vaccinated people, so, yeah, I'm going ""worry neighbor,"" gets vaccinated, going create better outcomes us. doesn‚Äôt matter. done catastrophic damage vaccine outreach. Fair enough. pretty much mean experience, although would say online education also pretty terrible. good 2 years socializing good quality education lost time we're fully back normal. put safer quotes? believe CDC Kansas State University something? They've already announced measures continue least two weeks. reason pause give time communicate doctors normal treatment clots federal health officials stressed one reason pause use vaccine ‚Äî United States‚Äô third authorized shot ‚Äî **was make sure medical professionals aware blood clots potentially associated vaccine treated conventional drug, heparin, could exacerbate clots.** Yeah, hard overstate screwed nations are. High COVID rates vaccine herd immunity years out. vaccine low rate clotting would different calculation Denmark. That's said all. Look incidence curves, UK peaked start January falling since then. That's way early mass vaccination responsible, that's all. *Now* vaccination might sufficient *keep* cases low. According latest [vaccination vaccinated August.

Pfizer ramping production, hopefully change much put Astrazeneca halt. \^\^ correct answer. People often cite around 40-50% based UK Israel data, countries downslope spike. know good evidence country using vaccines interrupt accelerating spike.  Yes ... article get many clicks. always better make everything sound extreme possible. Actually not. vast majority world 44 years old. risk die covid (just deaths side effects) actually high. Keep good work!  warm weather, irks end still wear masks outside. park lying grass, 20 feet anyone else earlier, someone yell put mask on. prominent hypothesis vaccine causes auto immunity factor part clotting system

Makes sense since widespread micro clotting virus causes also seems immune response related. Dumb dumber. Heres link : Yeah, reminded exactly tetanus shot senior year taken away me... know feels like bud. pull mask security. cannot refuse, concerned vaxxed anyway. pull 5 seconds, hold breath paranoid.

There copper IUDs women love don‚Äôt hormones, metal inflammatory effect worsens periods. okay possibility side effects related hormones (not blood clots though contains progestin, estrogen) also plastic hormone-releasing ones tend greatly reduce bleeding cramping outright stop periods.

The highest dose hormonal IUD called Mirena actually FDA approved treatment heavy menstrual bleeding. doctor recommended specifically bad periods. reduced cramping bleeding benefits hormonal IUD stronger types hormonal birth control hormones released directly uterine tissue.

According CDC , wear mask private settings condition interacting people either:

* Fully Vaccinated
* risk serious illness (I'm sure falls bucket)

Presumably, refers stuff like private family gatherings. Yeah go outside everyday skate lot isolated spot busy outside virus mutate faster take way, apologize response sounded crass.

To mirror zeeke said, tests New York April 2020 vs. 2021 staggering. think there's points keep mind.

Despite vaccines pumped out, mean we're gonna STOP seeing cases. Young people last get vaccinated. successful roll-out plan, immunocompromised older (and risk) got shots first. helped weather storm, mean young people CAN'T get seriously sick catch virus.

Think vaccinated yet. Young people, can't get appointments, anti-vaxxers/those want vaccine. Young people college high school, going parties (at least around me) returning normal lives‚Äîeven without vaccine. overall consensus amongst people know ""my parent(s) grandparent(s) vaccinated - feel guilty going friends...""

Anti-vaxxers want vaccine trust yet‚Äîyes, they're different groups people‚Äîhave viewpoint ""I'm ready go back normal life."" They're getting vaccine, there's finish line. They've returned normal life.

These people still catching virus still risk. Now, 28 healthy mean can't get serious case COVID. know otherwise healthy 40-something year old get appointment yet. used smoke, caught COVID, ICU.

Conversely, let's say healthy 20-something year old. catch COVID get bad fever... get bad anxiety trouble breathing. go hospital. Now, literally check hour later getting IV calming down... they're still recording COVID hospitalization.

So guess overall point COVID still thing... there's people still catching it... young people **are** still risk still cases. numbers always tell entire story good degree sensationalism media. Michigan - much bad place right now. NY month ago? bad people made be. ""Today 700th anniversary 5 year cruise!""  Spread still exponential current levels vaccination.

Michigan proved that. go back pajama wrestling class? trained hard 6 years sport, gave ""for greater good"" since last February. mostly doomsday prepper level compliant CDC guidelines. gym seen 4 infections year, none severe, includes 2 infected interstate tournament. I'm fully vaccinated past second dose, I'm buying hard ""your kids can't get vaccinated going kill MIS-C"" ""the vaccines work variants, MI tons breakthrough cases"" narrative. want stop gaining weight get back training without social pariah. Also, BJJ literally worst activity could possibly pandemic aside licking everything COVID ward. Masks completely incompatible sport people going sweating breathing face 2 hours; part think vaccines could possibly prevent level sustained exposure.  Yeah, still read least 75% Tennesseans would likely take vaccine. know, medical experts led information, anti-mask protests thing.

They've known early 2000's adenovirus vector cause platelet dysfunction. seen early studies gene therapies. expected, go completely ignored. People continue whine social distancing masking, completely ignore exercise taking personal responsibility health. can't approach simple math 6 dead &lt; 1000 dead whatever. likely people may die potential vaccine related clotting would different who's lives would saved reducing covid spread. saving peoples lives expense others. That's harder decision make. seem carry risks

Yeah, carry *different* risks, like PR disasters AZ

Weird, know PR affects vaccine safety effectiveness. They'd never! accept CDC cards. brother vaccinated New Jersey let Mets game last weekend fine. 

Get facts straight start spreading misinformation. risk dying AZ vaccine comparable participating traffic couple months. someone would rather stay inside couple months instead taking AZ vaccine, also rethink whether they'd want go pandemic over. reduce severity chances hospitalised, effects transmissibility unknown currently. Miami currently highest infection numbers Florida. also highest numbers variants. needs explained....? extremely good, let's overstate things. Israel still seeing 200 cases day, indicating virus continues spread local population (as opposed people traveling in). US 36.5x bigger, are, would seeing 7300 cases per day. Much lower, low enough us rescind restrictions (the line seems 10K/day), long way nonexistent.

Vaccinating children may able finish job, may not; still substantial number Israeli adults gotten vaccine intention ever getting it. problem applies every country world. Simply put, people getting comfy bonuses

They afraid lose ever ‚Äúget back normal‚Äù messaging damage expected last far longer.  Europe homogenous US. can‚Äôt compare Greece Ireland example. EU countries reasonably high hesitancy, others, it‚Äôs entirely non-issue. findings imply students made little progress learning home suggest losses even larger countries weaker infrastructure longer school closures.

**2019-2020 U.S. Flu Season: Preliminary In-Season Burden - 56M infected, 62k dead

vs

covid 30M infected 550k dead. Europeans cheering failure personal dislike AZ completely deplorable. 

Who cheering failure vaccine? making seem like remotely common point view even bringing up. Japan want next games.

They want games 11 years now. They've got facilities ready go waiting another 3 11 years would even costly. They'd basically paying double single set games.

They still get benefits increased prestige, increased interest travel, I'm sure exactly TV money flows, Japan balking that, I'm sure IOC find way funnel TV money way compensate loss fans.

In nutshell: Paying reduced benefits better paying twice full benefits. J&amp;J postponed 7 women clotting issues 7 million vaccinated still great vaccine 

That's bit misleading. affects one specific demographic: younger women. everyone else, risk basically zero. 

Only fraction 6.8 million J&amp;J vaccines given younger women. real risk 7 however many J&amp;J vaccines given younger women, group prioritized vaccination. 0.002% vaccinated province. Seems like vaccine works. dad ‚Äúhad trouble website‚Äù sit literally watch make appointment. wasn‚Äôt going convenient otherwise. mom wasn‚Äôt going eligible weeks, went appointment, enough doses get taken care well. 

Luckily don‚Äôt really vaccine-hesitant people family inner circle though, we‚Äôve gotten pretty much soon it‚Äôs available, couldn‚Äôt proud. It‚Äôs funny estimation certain people dropped like rock people risen others last year. Forreal. Efficacy equal effectiveness ughhh Every country stable infection rates suddenly weren't. Funny exponential growth thing works. dangerous

So AZ? Give here. Depends country. Lots antivax France, Netherlands. \#TeamModerna house think discontinuing vaccine cost lives saves. like apples motor oil comparison. 

1.) 16 years driving I‚Äôve show Id/insurance 3 times. don‚Äôt show everytime get car go somewhere 

2.) again, that‚Äôs one time thing. didn‚Äôt show transcripts walking every class. Hell, didn‚Äôt even show MMR vaccine records physically work campus. show signed online masters working physically (possibly unvaccinated -FWIW vaccinated) 2.5 years.

3. Even though I‚Äôm constantly told look young age, I‚Äôve carded maybe twice whole life. counts casinos, bars, anything. Danish authorities made study collaboration Norwegians indicating 1 40000 get serious clots (250 10.000.000) Shhh, interrupting fear mongering panic, we're supposed lose shit this. It‚Äôs not. linear factor delay doesn‚Äôt exponentially increase supply. day can't go steakhouse order shit medium rare day I'm packing moving Mexico!!! Can't say. think there's official breakdown stats SSI. 

Also important remember choice binary. 

It's choice either AZ shot nothing. 

It's choice AZ shot not, AZ shot certain groups waiting vaccines. Serious question. cases jumping much US? many people vaccinated/getting vaccinated many people already prior infection. can‚Äôt wrap head around I‚Äôm sorry? surprised certain conclusion mean jumping conclusion. status may anticipate conclusion, automatically jumping one conclusion. still open whatever may happen. sure. Lol sub loves virtue signaling. still love/trust science *and* admit make right call taking vaccine killed Johnson's middle handling ease restrictions UK April June. respect give credit lockdowns we're still extent them. can't denied impact vaccines having. guess would government want put much emphasis vaccine success fear public ease break restrictions early. all, recently vaccinated first jab. Johnson playing things safe. difference make? irrational fear particular kind vaccine much better irrational fear vaccines; end result still going unnecessary death. people severe anaphylaxis mRNA vaccines blood clots AZ J&amp;J.  Sorry, absolutely right accounts fully admit typed thinking talking J&amp;J vaccine, 6/7.1 million blood clots. I'll take word AZ rate.

And yes, cultural. wrote American viewpoint mentioned. US think, along J&amp;J moratorium, cripple vaccine acceptance US reasons states above. Unsure cultures react.  claim based relative ranking density averages. possible? Sure. inevitable? No. think Angie Rasmussen put best, compared lottery. Jha Rules Darwin awards all. took long? get turn public health partisan issue, followers dumb enough believe it.

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. they, mean every single guy. clear trend imo guys raised affected entitlement. get people want continue on. I'm sick shit. vaccine end (we amazing vaccines) is. also adore pill. used throw much first cycle day actually became unsafe drive. zero symptoms. Switched combination pill mini pill due 30 due slight breast cancer increase risk, apparently it‚Äôs protective ovarian cancer awesome since that‚Äôs one runs family. Definitely hope stay til menopause. would let two weeks run course knowing many people end clots current number J&amp;J vaccines.

Great point. specifically mention one things used justify lowering estimate range (500k 1M) rather keep 1M middle range. larger percentage younger people vaccinated already people priority things like job (healthcare workers, etc). also first line vaccination, lot vaccinated mRNA vaccines J&amp;J available.

Correct. go another way estimating vaccination numbers would involved getting numbers total female teachers health care workers first. method would susceptible dates vaccine approval. Overall, however, agree young women would likely get J&amp;J older women. line: making lot assumptions, even seem like reasonable ones. would nice official numbers.

Yes, Fermi approximations (the estimation method discussing) shockingly accurate despite lack precision. getting official numbers soon but, now, fair say 6 pathological cases less 500,000 total cases relevant age group. 1 83,000 young women potentially vulnerable. could less and, given small number cases (6 significantly different 8 4), could more. 

Still, excellent idea order magnitude. talk Johnson &amp; Johnson now? There's one vaccine causing blood clots. blind faith taking shit government rushes shit way thinking. Maybe bc I'm veteran know first hand gov full shit. sure everyone much blind trust broken ass system? I'm 27, normal BMI, fit. telling I'm 100000x likely die Covid blood clot? Go give talking point geriatric patients buddy. Well, even did, unless post ""I got vaccinated"" sticker front center caption advising people continue mask stay indoors we're #inthistogether think getting full efficacy.  math another thread want see comment history 3-6x riskier go without based data Erm... Danish Health Agency reporting around 1 40,000 10,000 times higher numbers quoting buddy. probably even higher certain age groups. 

Edit: Source - might help hesitancy delivering doses first three months year, still made it. Plus know one situation apologies who's problems similar even worst dont complain üôè wonder Sweden them? genetically one closest countries Norway Denmark, heard anything them. vaccintracker based current pace take account speeding deliveries. simple projection prediction all. Hey, I‚Äôve seen one before! Politics way ruining everything. waited long, schedule two weeks second shot Statistics twist arm making feel safe, they're help make informed decision risk. Forewarned forearmed, etc. 'Grats starting vaccine journey shit ton dying, look to.

What's deaths seem isolated specific groups specific ages. they're offered alternative vaccines. Wth. Canada struggled get vaccines? I‚Äôm assuming US kinda screwed bought everything could piece? can't compare efficacy rates vaccines Yeah know there's risk lot things make less worse knowing get blood clot literally one million. Added  Could see J&amp;J men only, women get mRNA ones? doesn‚Äôt sound good strong feeling they'll vote groups get vaccine, probably gonna restrict either everyone 50 women 50.

If smart tho, allow use populations would unlikely get second mRNA shot, i.e. homeless, regardless minimal clot risk. simply want endorse one vaccine two. plenty people would choose vaccine president got refuse other. Absolutely not. Conspiracy theories greatest! There's burden proof tinfoil hats never go style. urban counties, new infections climbed 6%, 425,000.

But's lets try stats 6% significantly different 10%. Makes wonder there‚Äôs information releasing. Seems like like there‚Äôs real danger vaccine certain groups, don‚Äôt want outright say scare everyone away vaccines. We‚Äôre hurry since athletes staff coming olympics Tokyo we‚Äôve less cases deaths Germany countries. Im sorry post it, need tell situation somebody.  thing need job least bring money home. hard thing . Yes, exactly why! people nuts cling tiny sliver validation. Canada gladly take accept risks. desperate afford blood clots according health Minister big? thought Europe highest numbers vaccine hesitancy. Thanks!  chance getting blood clots child birth. feels really unnecessary. framing question UK ‚Äútake AZ nothing all‚Äù. outright wrong.

No ones saying ‚ÄúI told so‚Äù, maybe reasonable level skepticism wasn‚Äôt backwards hillbilly thinking media portrayed be? Paywall. OP post full text. opposite happened many places world.

In EU everyone talking delays vaccine deliveries, big manufacturers actually over-estimated many vaccines could give, etc. German engineering. German ingenuity. Okay, sure getting much shade.

it's uncommon someone travel Africa, somewhere else, UK?

or even travel somewhere else, infect someone else person travels UK. Yes, hindu devotees reason behind current surge. stellar logic, really. C-suite is! compute. Idiot Americans ignoring lockdown mandatory mask wearing since crap started see decline vaccines hit. I'm sure abiding lockdown procedure helped vaccines responsible decline well. whether rare type clot, putting risk perspective. risk extreme press coverage.

For example, use blood clots ( non deadly type) risk death -

This link says 3% women die blood clots oral contraceptive link also says 1 1000 women experience blood clots per year ( lower tho)

So 3% fatality rate 1 1000 
For vaccine 25% fatality rate 1 150,000 (roughly). 

You fudge numbers around bit depending different stats,, generally see risk dying pill higher taking vaccine.. that, per year! one off.

Like examples, risk dying car crash magnitudes higher. Doubt. good everyone.

Its sad state, likely development world move quickly towards mnra everyone else take get quickly end pandemic now.

then assume mrna come price. seem like amazing tech. Yeah that's reason surge. Maharashtra leading cases large margin Ganga flow there. 

I mean blame religious gatherings much want India stopped social distancing opened country long time ago. allowed kind large crowds, rallies, local trains etc etc. Putting surge ""hindu devotees"" reeks agenda else expect media outlets anyway? US isn‚Äôt interfering elections Latin America anymore

The military CIA coup Evo Morales Bolivia last year. time, considers benefits AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh risks recommends vaccinations continue. 


My feelings matter irrelevant World Health Organization says keep jabbing. going listen experts better listen ? wonder Japan prioritize Olympic athletes training staff &amp; officials vaccine? change positions and/or companies anyone find prime management material. Depends goals are. hard (almost impossible) make progress without proper equipment.

If goal light workout day stay somewhat ok shape, possible. Otherwise, much. wild adenovirus cause problem, safe assume adenovirus carrier vaccine cause blood could also code spike protein. 

If spike mRNA vaccines cause blood clots, difference delivery cell. spike DNA vector vaccines enters cell nucleus, encoding spike mRNA vaccines enter cell nucleus. got second shot Pfizer vaccine üíâ usually throw food bin. Can't careful coroni stuff flying about.

Wat. European production massive. EU lacking behind vaccinating export massively - including US - instead keeping it. still negotiations, EU aiming contract Pfizer 1.8bn doses delivered 2022 2023. They‚Äôll take Uk‚Äôs vaccines again... guess bad luck then.  Okay. didn‚Äôt think case since ‚Äòdelivered‚Äô implies brought somewhere else  try look genome sequencing try explain kind natural mutation could switch 4 adjacent genes middle RNA. 

This virus lab manufactured man made teeth. EU announced order 1800M booster vaccines Pfizer.

US citizens likely safe given much MRNA vaccines Everyone move mRNA developed world, viral vectors basically dead longer term. UK investing huge mRNA capable vaccine factory Curevac failing production far imagine countries closely follow suit Homer Simpson - [Winner Two different clots two diff areas USA exporting exactly zero vaccins.

Sarcasm aside: manufacturers prioritize US supply European production chains well affect Canada. know US got least J&amp;J Pfizer Europe top domestic production. better.

American lives worth less internet like us.  forgot important part:

People cancer affects blood, bone marrow lymph nodes elevated risk COVID-19 vaccine failure, particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia, according new results analysis UPMC Hillman Cancer Center patients.  athletes teams located Olympic Town. guess tested people Japan.

There spreading happening domestic tourists athletes. Pfizer applied approval 12-15 years olds three days ago. means done.

Very likely FDA grant 3-4 weeks.  say peoples countries unvaccinated 80 year olds nothing *happy proud* see extra doses flooding America's 30 year olds.  get seems premature need make statement like even intention athletes vaccinated? I'm sure countries Romania professional athlete, among first get vaccinated. health care professional working private sector UK. colleagues five deep vein thrombosis long covid clients, youngest 33. care home work at, unfortunately got covid, lost 13 residents blood clots. order later. initially chose Pfizer mRNA vaccine choice (which seems correct choice). guess always renew contract future needed. Covid vaccine availability anyway improve dramatically future. 

Also must noted AstraZeneca optimal partner EU J&amp;J currently limbo doesn‚Äôt even deliver anything. basically decided 4th grade end life Germany/Austria teachers give recommendations whether kid able get high school diploma something 'lower'.

19 deaths 18+ million vaccines administered UK, close odds struck lightning. go public, government funded, elementary school without records vaccination 20 years ago. rights then? Oh, right safe learning environment. Dude. vaccines still used. renew contract afterwards however. Yeah wondering thing work podiatrist friend physio we‚Äôve five DVT long covid patients. youngest 33 health issues. care home work at, unfortunately got covid lost 13 residents, lost lives due blood clots. pretty sad situation. worth noting rollout still going people 50s, numbers go further.

Guess country's population getting boosters ready. J&amp;J AZ ones Pfizer Moderna's stuff I'm allergic them. I'm nervous I'm gonna bite bullet hope nothing happens. allergy minor (like hives wear something made it, asthma-like symptoms breathe it, stomach pain diarreah injest it, etc) still. :( EU ordered enough Pfizer vaccinate every citizen twice every year 2023 AZ JJ really needed. Moderna also deliver hundreds millions year next year. basically what's happening? least US. American here, living Denmark. Vaccine news basically nothing. see random stories government purchased X many millions doses (Denmark little 6 million people), yet, anyone whose frontline healthcare worker over, like, 90, essentially equivalent shoulder shrug emoji.

Female, 36, veinous brain stent. Would again. Odd - seems like CDC main page shows 65+ 79.6% age breakdown page shows 65-74 75+ lower number.

I wonder someone set mapping pull incorrectly headline 65+ number? think clear indications women severe side effects vaccine.  He‚Äôs 70‚Äôs. He‚Äôs taking chances. regular younger person, isn‚Äôt serious vaccination. point accept premise one even contract virus? said, means master combing scientific journals.

Always appreciate modesty looks like Pfizer MoDerna truly safe ones? difference healthy person die virus, still develope blood cloths brain (or regions) + unknown long term side effects. course cannot compare lethalities one one, healthy person vaccine use even harming. anti vaxxer vaccinated many much deadly deseases, rushing vaccine really caring side effects ist careless  5B around Canada's budget purchase existing vaccines create domestic capacity 2 years. Indian GDP around 60% greater. Yeah sorry hilarious lol Mind explaining older groups get vaccine? thought they‚Äôd danger due deteriorating health. I‚Äôm going quite frank, acceptable logical conclusion.


And no, doctors don‚Äôt know look treat specifically. unless ability give every single person gets J&amp;J vaccine consistent MRI‚Äôs thorough checkups periodically dosages. practical. halting vaccines companies. stop potential tragedy happening could burden healthcare system.


As much appreciate view would never discourage someone getting one vaccines themselves, also wouldn‚Äôt encourage tell logically speaking they‚Äôll fine. wouldn‚Äôt throw fallacies misrepresented statistics effort shame taking dangerous route. Especially safer alternative.


mRNA vaccines proven much safer. That‚Äôs resources companies need be. too. minimizes issue thought need spend $100 billion internet infrastructure podunk towns get social media learn lies. It‚Äôs clot. AZ gives brain clot, dangerous clot another part body. results possible *because* Election Day. experience second Moderna. Oddly, arm hurt first day either. hurt days first dose. bruise? Oh gosh, bruise. Nothing second though. Weird.  understand concerns grandparents loved ones even covid jab still able contract virus spread onto others. 

Do also get flu jab every year protect loved ones? 

I feel like governments (especially UK) tried install sense heroism getting vaccine, like people get jab better class people dont, even though dont want dont care people, dont faith long term sufficient testing done. 

I way mean offence reply, wanted see side done me. Thanks reply mate, stay safe good day üëçüèª What's actual number instead percentages. I've seen use ""covid explodes 300%"" cases went 3 9 cases. Exactly. parents jumped get likely want adolescents. Regionally, problem, nation wide, we'll okay-especially we're able vaccinate high risk. Seniors well 50% already.

Much anti-vax, anti-mask population also natural immunity. Vaccine immunity stronger, natural still help. appreciate reply üëç  feel need torture us like this?

Why assuming done maliciously? I'm all! choice would go maskless I'm fully vaccinated, I'm going defy rules. wish vaccine days parks could operate normally, since know Disney isnt going allow maskless entry anytime soon otherwise. Care tell US hospitalization rate today compared 3 months ago? AstraZeneca J&amp;J calculated delay vaccination Norway 11-13 weeks. Meaning 18 demographic might wait late fall/early winter first shot. Makes sense mRNA vaccines perform similarly. said infection tests rates artificially low, deaths, anyone else knows certain. Tokyo population 11 million people recorded 1800 tests yesterday. That's artificially lowered. Usa #1 .. heck yea ! love comment much. I‚Äôve reading public health measures fail focus entirely individual choices. Obviously people ultimately choose eat much move, many complex factors, including underlying genetics, mental health/trauma, childhood nutrition, food deserts, super judgey society persistently chastises people overweight/obese. There‚Äôs much could society help people living obesity tell eat vegetables.

Good luck journey, physical health mental health/healing trauma. Twenty-five pounds great start, know matter long takes reach health goals, worthwhile individual. makes happy see first dose 65+ columns still continuing move upward pretty good pace. Obviously I'd love see higher point, I'm glad 80% vulnerable getting least first dose show signs hitting ceiling yet. takes 3 months form habit. don‚Äôt think people realize they‚Äôre used much, it‚Äôs become normal them. Social distancing/Mask wearing end there's herd immunity impossible unless vaccines given almost everyone. 

And AZ vaccine halted, everyone wait Pfizer Moderna one Yeah, sure. I've never enjoyed I've seen it.

Unfortunately indoor live music probably among last thing come back. bunch people singing poorly ventilated rock club (which live music experiences anyway) probably pretty high unsafe activities. I'm hoping see outdoor shows summer, hopefully return indoor shows late summer/early fall.

Canada good ally. I'm glad work them. way high risk us, absolutely way lose. 

I could see case I'd paid research even mRNA tech. pay shots bucks each. 

This really shown friends who's worth friend. 

We incredibly lucky fall EUs lies allowing free trade. mad can't seize vaccines. Inventors mRNA vaccines talking working cancer vaccines decade. me, better flu vaccine pretty far list what's exciting this. word well someone history insanely bad reactions vaccines exactly target audience comment. Fair play situation Ah yes, aware realities one's culture called *checks notes* ""cognitive dissonance"". important remember static threshold. Transmissibility varies seasonally peoples' behavior. Herd immunity summer necessarily guarantee herd immunity winter, example. I‚Äôm little wobbly criticism. mean... maybe put equipment doors? killing ~100 million people got yesterday. Pain arm 12 hours, little sore. That's it. second one round-house kick head. Like fucking magnets. T-cells... vaccine passed phase 1 2, started development way back, lipid coating also developed independently Chinese company, even published paper Cell. Apparently US done 87 million Moderna shots. can't math 900 post vaccine infections / 87 million shots even without shots, look sample 87 million Americans, gotten covid exposed/infected time. 

However, complicated fact that, regardless health officials recommend, we're honest vast majority people fully vaccinated relaxed precautions started lot high risk activities (indoor dining, travel, social gatherings, etc.) fine IMO, can't hide bunker forever, think apples apples comparison vaccine's protection behavior changes.

All said, 900 breakthrough infections, mild, really damn good. J&amp;J trial. received dose early December confirmed received vaccine. 

I‚Äôm concerned lower efficacy, new variants, contracting even mild case Covid ‚Äî don‚Äôt want infect unvaccinated child risk contracting long Covid. 

There plenty vaccine supply community I‚Äôm seriously considering getting moderna Pfizer soon. 

Thoughts? Dreidels tho  speak healthcare workers experience. I‚Äôve seen quite COVID induced blood clots come ER, women. One coworkers 32 year old women ended bilateral pulmonary embolism end COVID experience. I‚Äôve seen one vaccine yet. speaking violence men committed strangers acquaintances.

I mean, set covers 100% human population. Fellas, gay get vaccine? that's name thankfully heard long time. give cite? getting number? Well enough 2? we're bit schedule here... silly. Smoking literally **thousands** times dangerous taking vaccine. correct there's 0.00000011% chance occuring. context, ‚Äúyoung‚Äù seems mean woman pre-menopause, likely 500,000 1,000,000. Herd immunity would happen even without vaccine. Spanish Flu went away year even vaccine. land border mostly closed problem people crossing borders get vaccines. take issue countries preemptively banning exports drugs can‚Äôt make using nationalist rhetoric villainous neighboring countries respond reciprocally. 

I think Canada US cooperated procuring distributing vaccines neither government interested helping last year cooperation could done good competition. Pfizer selling vaccines. currently indication Pfizer (or COVID vaccines) cause infertility birth defects. actually informal count vaccine spot today two times many men women, curious Nothing 100% risk free. risk mitigation, like things life, vaccine much much lower chance causing significant harm virus itself.

My general point whole notion Brits Daily Mail reading, EU hating savages whilst everyone EU magnanimous liberal without bias prejudices seems background assumption vocal minority product nationalist superiority complex. I'm saying one people, fellows definitely throwing fuel fire helping. dumb person unreliable good way, fair :) see people vaccinated say continue wear mask ‚Äúto make others feel comfortable.‚Äù someone also vaccinated, makes comfortable see mask off! signal returning normal, vaccines work, end fear. vaccinated people voluntarily wearing masks settings (not abiding local mandates business rules), trigger stop wearing them? Probably people still travel competitions (I know shouldn't, do). least makes bit sense.

Maybe should‚Äôve added soon. father 61 didn‚Äôt get one yet either. isn‚Äôt far though. think we‚Äôre 18-74 risk group 60-74.

In hard hit locations Oslo heard already vaccinating 50s though?

200k doses AZ/month doesn‚Äôt really make difference. Pfizer nearly replacing AZ supply additional supply (Should additional ~500k Norway Q2 top original order). 

No point taking risk overall impact vaccination schedule low remaining unvaccinated population young. think better idea share EU nations wants use them, due low volume won‚Äôt make much difference.

Losing J&amp;J, happens, significant impact. supposed supply ~1m doses Norway Q2 sufficient ~25% adult population. hope he‚Äôs right. National 7 day average actually showing upward trend line right now. like certainly cause far deaths blood clots ever could.

Not Denmark, spread control experiencing 3rd wave. Depends much you, vaccine, prevalence disease live whether need boosters. already know vaccines marginally less effective variants, know immunity decays. don‚Äôt know exact magnitude two effects, don‚Äôt even know much COVID world year two.

Anyway, hope keep working years. not, big deal, get flu shots every year anyway add top. Sigh. Easter backlog earlier days 7 day average partially account this, looking hospitalizations, looks like bona fide, albeit small, increase. Yeah isn‚Äôt huge part pause roll treatment plans normal way treat blood clots actually makes blood clot worse?   Lol. Can't even say contextually appropriate abbreviation National Socialist German Workers' Party. study exactly vaccines shouldn‚Äôt completely written off, impressive.  vaccinated 48.4% total population (32,326,604 people) first dose. 12.23% second dose (8,170,081).

Of first doses, roughly 21 million AZ 11 million Pfizer.

Without AZ we'd situation France, vaccinated 10 million people first dose huge amount cases deaths every day.

Astrazeneca saved UK. able start re-opening getting back normal week. seemed far ahead beginning testing, would thought would 100% now! get vaccine problems. two shots, outcome 6 months now? whole waiting game get vaccinated :( *look harder

June's looking reeeeeal nice wonder many deaths one day delay vaccination process would cause would compare death count clots whole nation vaccinate AZ JJ. 'The USA better' bravado unfounded.

I interest arguing America ""better,"" argument substantively wrong. BioNTech developed Pfizer's vaccine, yes. order so, licensed patents mRNA technology developed University Pennsylvania Katalin Karik√≥ Drew Weissman. Without underlying tech, none would possible. developed American university, Hungarian researcher American researcher. Nobel handed this, going them. Remember problem specific kind blood clot extremely rare, that's link confirmed. blood clot dangerous without proper training treatment paradoxical. patient given anti-clotting medication, make specific type blood clots worse could kill patient. hospitals trained ready tackle blood clots, dangerous. agree cases go quickly, different million ""surge incoming"" predictions past year. literally said ""nowhere.""

So, said ""nowhere,"" really meant ""no privately owned business?""

And hanging hat difference N4zi Germany level shit plenty freely elected 21st century democracies level shit difference full approval EUA?

3 months (or whatever) we've got fully approved vaccine, acceptable places require proof vaccination (among approved demographics) entry? Wearing indoors fine. outdoors transmission low, matter much. Birth control like 1000x risk, fear mongering absurd context: currently relatively good control pandemic Denmark. countries EU increasing infection rates tightening restrictions, infection rates stable gradually loosen restrictions. may test lot compared countries. yes, possibly learning potential benefit. might countries think take even it‚Äôs free.

Also..women‚Äôs healthcare isn‚Äôt ever prioritized. Prime example, birth control pills significantly higher risk blood clots vaccine appears have, yet...

It‚Äôs connection mind immediately made. demo people getting blood clots also demo people highly likely birth control..or birth control. 

I don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs reason, it‚Äôs immediate ‚Äúduh‚Äù explanation that‚Äôs probably worth looking into. wouldn‚Äôt know vaccines interact meds yet. people actually take finally good news there's decent chance Belgian factory big productivity increase.

I'm pretty sure (but quote me) effect Marburg plant Germany kicking gear. soak food ethanol 30 mins, bombard sucker UV light reheat 400F least hour. never safe. can't name every county US sight counties appear largely rural. need focus vaccine distribution towards urban suburban counties. Symptomatic yes, case vaccine efficacy data. However, severe based symptoms listed, mean one cough. Symptomatic never equated severe cases.

So still claim false seems like you‚Äôre compounding incorrect information. Boris setting another lockdown year? joke seriously suggesting doctors shouldn‚Äôt offer birth control pills women want them? Women likely get blood clots regardless. Things like birth control pregnancy increase risk significantly. Men co-morbidities. Also AZ administered 20 million times UK alone. hardly health workers mostly women. know effects men less, effecting men less already know men lower chance even getting blood clots. [Canada also using AZ vaccinating women healthcare workers, lo behold first blood clot case woman Quebec. Sooooo really bad I‚Äôm fully vaccinated went visit hometown see friends. Pretty sure none consistently wear mask fully vaccinated one. None us got sick, trust vaccines.

My second dose went totally fine, though. Gotcha, appreciate answer. really see problem type thinking long going public spaces visiting others, etc. issue comes people get vaccinated insist shopping person, going restaurants, visiting family/friends work person around others. hope get vaccinated soon!

No Anecdotally people know different, Pfizer AZ. constant would say either one dose gives nasty next day, rarely neither both. coach adverse reaction vaccine (yes, slim chances) sue NFL requiring get vaccine? NFL giving coaches contracts get vaccine? worry lot people ""want vaccine"" enough actually make appointment get it. Especially since Pfizer providing 50 millions doses Q2. virus act like deadly Black Plague, actually 99% survival rate. That‚Äôs nauseating.

Isn't chance dying vaccine 1% well? cry virus big deal chances survive it. thing vaccine? 99% likely survive getting it. 

So according you, ridiculous blown perspective lethality virus is, turn around blow lethality vaccine benefit argument. Hi! first all, important note ‚Äî vaccines still highly effective variants measures, continue nearly perfect preventing severe disease death.

It‚Äôs hard know sorts public health measures place later year ‚Äî almost certainly less we‚Äôre currently (especially you‚Äôre Toronto moment), much things relaxed depend heavily quickly vaccines roll community well transmission suppressed unvaccinated communities. need lockdown (for now) : n95 kf94 masks, glasses, hand sanitizer keep distance. that's all.

But maskless un-vaccinated idiots keep spreading we'll never end this.

that's obvious, no? Paracetamol literally counter medication, would hardly compare vaccine.  

Yes course medicine causes adverse effects, stuff like needs go rigorous testing often time takes years. vaccines rushed like crazy. Sure, urgent, costing lives people saving people ever get tired panicking every single event higher covid risk sitting home alone jerking off? seems exhausting even read statement? explain reasoning process link study postulate possible cause blood clots. absolutely incorrect. he's right ""all predictions""  quote Z Dogg MD someone asked anti-vaxxers live stream encouraging getting vaccinated: ""Let die."" mean yea ideal. people forget large logistical nightmare vaccine distribution is.

Not necessarily, CEO Pfizer recently stated vaccine stored normal freezer temps. That's good example confirmation bias. Yes, end last lockdown people went bit mad. right message send. think Fauci said 2 weeks post-vaccine make post social media.

Denmark shut everyone - done concerns.  always Even CDC says two vaccinated people freely socialize private settings. hookup would fully CDC-compliant. general understanding CDC guidelines erring side caution almost absurd degree.

I can't prove it, would bet money there's risk car accident drive disease transmission setting. Firstly, wearing mask social distancing taking personal responsibility health.

Also, increases need exercise.

Exercise + calorie reduction gold standard. There's reason approve medications based anectdotal evidence, guess argument takes vaccines work body maybe? Also % needed 'herd' immunity. agree must making difference played lower death rates amongst older vaccinated population, dipped much faster. mean, early possible guess? heard, Astra Zeneca 1/40.000 J&amp;J 1/1.000.000, there‚Äôs bit difference able read german, official source: says risc pill newer generation 6th times high woman without pill pregnancy. newest one official data yet, seems 8 times high without, far already known.

And yes, even blood clot, would still take J&amp;J AZ current unvaccinated condition. Norway, vaccine killed people risk demographic (women 18-50) COVID killed, fairly short period time. studies tell vaccine work (to stop symptomatic COVID) 5% cases.

So, no, I'm ""worried"" work. **know** infallible.

Seems logical virus spread enough (in body) causing symptoms, probably shedding enough point build infect others.

Sure, laymen's talk, think I'm coming far left field here.   us afford though. need strive back normalcy, even means new normal wearing masks yearly injections fight virus new strains. Please link study claims get vaccine, 100% immune virus can't spread anymore. I'll wait. heard right, secret ingredient BioNTech vaccine EU flag. that's patriotism veins. sounds like solution speed vaccinations. Right, HIV COVID similar how? Thanks. Could direct something recent moderna? know early (maybe October so) Pfizer t-cell info moderna didn‚Äôt assumed meant moderna may one, since I‚Äôve seen least one study (I‚Äôll go look post this) implies similar t-cell response, granted haven‚Äôt seen whole lot that.

Edit: here‚Äôs study thinking tests response t-cells elicited moderna Pfizer: know getting 30% from. 

From table linked article, says ""efficacy asymptomatic unknown disease"". precisely 28.9%. Yes, convenient travelers, super-duper inconvenient contact tracing. mean you‚Äôre likely die car accident covid.... diarrhoea.... 15 people age 50 died Covid Norway far, makes sense Norway cautious risk catching covid dying lot lower UK parts Europe.  revert back  I'm claiming study conclusive...I'm asking one study, since said 'studies'. say I've looking one I'm interested. worries referring single study, got hopeful all. math wrong

Well, Danish health authorities agree me. direct Appeal Authority part, know. mean telling old white men may able get erections probably best way get jabbed. ‚ÄúKnowingly intentionally killing people‚Äù. You‚Äôre even trying conceal misrepresentation problem. right difference, try least represent difference honestly maintain credibility point (which may validity expressed clearly honestly). No, case there‚Äôs third option ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cause harm giving at-risk demographic vaccines don‚Äôt cause blood clots.‚Äù

This would much trickier problem AZ J&amp;J vaccines. given currently know available options, seems indefensible recommend vaccines young women. Big reason wanting J&amp;J already first Pfizer dose, makes fully vaccinated time one dose. wants 10-12 people, vaccinated, birthday. light end tunnel rushing towards I‚Äôm happy tinfoil-hat part antivaxxers use ammo, use everything ammo anyway.

For merely sceptical part, though, believe handling lot convince vaccines are, overall, dangerous. difficult accuse authorities sweeping anything rug, all. seems like solution would tell women oral birth control pills get mRNA vaccine instead. fave. seems like legit nice guy too. exactly vaccines supposed again? know many people got J&amp;J young women I'm sure compare risk contraceptive pill. know women take contraceptive pill due risks, might want take Pfizer/Moderna instead J&amp;J reason. I've heard parasite swimming dick. ACIP meeting today going come sort decision J&amp;J wait longer that? Like what's purpose meeting? look people close proximity 15 minutes, best gauge that.

It isn‚Äôt exact science, don‚Äôt want call everyone every flight case might infectious yet. don‚Äôt want incite panic, people wearing masks correctly, it‚Äôs unlikely whole plane gets exposed. Unfortunately, article specify, group number calculated for. number calculated overall population women 60, naturally higher rusk SVT, doesn‚Äôt match frequency seen countries like Germany UK hat bigger sample group.

Anyway, pharmaceuticals side effects, rare cases severe side effects. long risks published transparently individual decide whether want take vaccine not. government decide stop using vaccine prudent opinion. put perspective, read rare side effects (up 1 10000) listed ibuprofen. would surprised. regularly take risk using ibuprofen without thinking twice. government step take ibuprofen market? method takes less one minute sync thermometer every day app, upload temps charting app. 1 minute day check cervical fluid observations. we're talking 2 minutes day enjoy sex without barriers hormones. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è That's 100% effective (for me) would greatly benefit charting honest. could help determine hormonal causes irregular cycles find ways correct them. method helped greatly PMS symptoms managing them. need regular cycle chart. Honest question, think city first breakthrough lax health guidelines Florida? I‚Äôve come across articles stating they‚Äôve found antibodies cord blood newborns indicating getting baby :)  previous president US believes childhood vaccines cause autism  What‚Äôs rates that? Considering frequently birth control pills taken implication there‚Äôs large chance cause CVST misleading.

It‚Äôs say birth control pills can‚Äôt cause CVST it‚Äôs way near 1:1000 chance idiot spreading around Lol boris‚Äôs opinion anything medical absolutely relevant mate Interesting, perhaps makes sense. Although I'd still argue benefits far outweigh risks decision left Norwegians whether want assume risk.

Either way, hope comes reasonable conclusion short order, Norway continue vaccination programme strong alternative. Banking on, ""I'm perfect never make mistakes,"" especially given many, ""mistakes,"" manufacturer error, exactly great plan. makes sense can't get vaccine positive test. creating delay get test vaccine. clots caused birth control nearly lethal though. personally, take hormonal birth control anymore think pretty insane we're accepting risk begin with. Thanks providing experience. reluctance get thus far see benefit since I'm relatively young healthy and, importantly, already recovered disease itself. Getting COVID demystified lived fear virus since. parents vaccinated, worried them. There's also (very) low probability chance mRNA vaccine could cause long-term side effect percentage people chance already acquired immunity old-fashioned way. Like everything pandemic, we've learning fly. I'm sure I'll get jab though. first Pfizer shot scheduled next Monday.  EU order biggest supply fucking Astra one.. Jha good initial tiny one February SA many thought large enough conclusive?

Funny write comment study much tinier study call tiny conclusive. Build facility make vaccines house then? Canadas got money? Really? wouldn‚Äôt pissed government hadn‚Äôt offered safer choice? dont see really comparison. think people blowing point makes article, honestly one already know. contain virus bubble things go sideways elsewhere world could come back impact later.  vaccines lockdowns cool nightmare variant spawns knows going problem media even attempt hide fact they're trying make people scared. guess that's surprising, they've done years, somehow people still read think, ""Hmmm yeah guess scared. Thanks!"" mean vaccine caused fainting? getting vasovagal reaction common getting poked needle (not I'm defending astra vaccine, took first shot i'm happy country delivered information potentially dying saying deal it)  Well, India used consist Pakistan Bangladesh even Afghanistan, Islamic countries now. yes, successful look subcontinent whole. long remove Jair Bolsonaro power. Otherwise it'll still variant hotspot higher chance vaccine resistant strains. think poorer countries much care that. vaccine all, everyone would taken AZ, blood clots blood clots. honestly right approach. Sadly enough mRNA go around, storage capacities required available. even worst case reactions J&amp;J AZ still way better COVID. get confused comparisons. Maybe someone help understand. 

I‚Äôm US pause J&amp;J saying 6 7 million less normal occurrence. numbers giving normal occurrence (5 1 million) per year J&amp;J numbers couple months. So, trouble understanding comparison. mean, much rather people like around ton Anti maskers like Florida.   I‚Äôm Canadian, cock. Great, chance people stupid. sound like idiot. lockdown NYC would awful idea. *what going AZ received planned receive?*

Australia take start vaccination program Christmas. irrelevant, would like saying study mice says anything effectiveness humans skip phase II III. yes doesnt work, need real weighs. Oh look someone else repeating 1 million lie. I'm aware. still would suck. Iirc concern type blood clot AZ causes much deatructive - brain blood clot. clots like DVT dangeorus, compared blood clot brain isn't. isn‚Äôt consider thrombosis developing CVST. medication would allowed given 1:1000 chance cause CVST especially birth control pill.... 31yo, second dose AZ last week (social care worker). Absolutely kicked arse day fine since. issues first one, also died yet. Also per living free country. Smoking cause blood clots 100 1.

Fortunately none big issue vaccines don‚Äôt cause issues demographic get one instead. yeah study came live cardboard hours something norm bit least.

Kind like EU countries giving AZ vaccine 60+. two vaccines already available potentially 2 near future that's easy solution. Even get rid cold storage problems, Mrna vaccines still need specialized equipment hard countries get, viral vectors made growing eggs (i.e. flu shots made). Tbh think IUDs default pill there's lot leftover fear mongering IUD 70s. kids would push towards IUD (unless there's something better then). shouldn‚Äôt wait children vaccinated fully open drop mask mandates. soon enough time passed adults access vaccinations need return normal. ""not great improvement"" means continuing 70%+ efficacy really see anything wrong that? far aware, alternative vaccines made available UK anyone 30 stage.

There's way things far likely cause severe harm happen kids everyday pandemic one cares. epidemiologist says ""a bit surprising"" three people hospitalized New Brunswick COVID-19 vaccinated, including someone two doses onset Raywat Deonandan, associate professor University Ottawa, says clinical trials showed vaccinated people still got sick, vaccines ""had 100 per cent chance keeping vaccinated people clinical trial numbers always optimistic real-life situations, said, noting COVID-19 vaccines tested tens thousands people, they're distributed tens millions people ""This probability, certainties,"" ""What done poor job explaining vaccines bulletproof vests."" They're merely mitigation Grant noted vaccine studies conducted otherwise healthy individuals, still soon know groups people evidence older people respond well vaccine, may remain ""somewhat susceptible"" coronavirus, said. cant see ever catch protection variants suggestion add level variables like creating cocktail vaccines Nobody thank VdL, she‚Äôs hopeless hack needs ousted replaced somebody competent. dog example. seem accurate considering J&amp;J issue blood clots actual study initial deployment phase AZ 222 cases 34 million 1st doses given? thats 0.0006% doses? fair countries experts disagree lol something enters popular mythos, impossible get rid it. Fun factoids memorable. ""Pfizer Moderna new techs, JnJ old tech"" (wrong - viral vector vaccines practically new mRNA). ""All vaccines 100% effective severe disease, hospitalization, death."" - wrong, artifact small case numbers (and Moderna two hospitalizations trial group). 

Someone another thread trying argue Sinovac (which *probably* least effective vaccine currently used globally) 100% effective severe disease trial 56-100% confidence interval. 

It's disappointing vaccines - especially mRNA ones - effective there's need lie efficacy. They're anywhere 87%-99% (unlikely 99%; Israel MoH study confounding variable risk exposure differences vaccinated unvaccinated populations) protective severe disease hospitalization real world use. That's crazy good, especially pared high effectiveness asymptomatic spread even mild symptomatic disease. 

Saying they're 100% effective counterproductive two key reasons: 
1) gives anti-vaxxers excuse get vaccinated. ""Well, 100% effective hospitalization death, obligation get it."" less 100% effective, emphasizes importance achieving herd immunity reduce harm - even vaccinated. 
and seeing headlines someone died COVID vaccine enforce 
2) inevitable headlines arrive tragedy someone dying COVID getting vaccinated, leads mindset ""they lied vaccine effectiveness! else lying about?"" 

People well-intended say they're 100% effective, time data misrepresented provides window used promoting vaccinations. ? small country luxury choose formula another one (btw Israel same). Practically 50s vaccinated DK AZ restricted 50s AZ use there. know Corona spreads different now, year later.

I remember friend (who's germaphobe, anyway) would leave Amazon packages outside house three days touching them. Yeah two countries barely 10 million inhabitants combined blame supply demand. Give break üòÇ Pretty sure Biontech huge production capacity Marburg exists without Pfizer involved all. 

Also still Phase 3 trials American involvement Curevac? far know none. Pretty much every decision Macron taken pandemic late increase time Pfizer doses six twelve weeks people

This exactly US shown great immune response one dose demonised? Pfizer generally awful company like big pharmaceutical companies.

The reason Pfizer isn‚Äôt common outside US country hoarding it‚Äôs also ridiculously expensive compared others. two options here: 
\- Knowingly cause harm giving vaccine 
\- Knowingly cause even harm giving vaccine 
Both options uncertainty involved aware likely results. risk 0 hasnt happened guy yet, isnt works. Also, people died clots related covid vaccines, granted case j&amp;j, realistically cant different mention talking shot foe virus symptoms. 

I agree worth it, criticize actions scientists tyrade full exactly correct information. hope 1st 2nd scenario sure. Sure effectively Denmark pushes AZ allotment EU block, Czechia willing buy them. I'm sure occur per contracts. Mumbai, city population 20million, 3800 active cases 12th feb. Today, we're around 90k active cases. diagnosed / tested numbers. We're currently testing capacity, centres literally turning people away. 

Apples oranges, completely agree. took things far lightly assuming pandemic control pretty much too, we're worst we've ever been. Cases dropping like stone 20-somethings still rolling vaccines care homes. Vaccinations going decent impact hospital admissions deaths now, we'd otherwise case rate, low case rate going found lot heavy lifting, definitely lockdown anything dropped lot faster unvaccinated groups. Yup high risk household We're stopping vaccinations, we're continuing vaccinations fast possible, vaccines Astra Zeneca vaccine. estimates, I'm aware of, says, delay time everyone vaccinated 3 weeks. impossible predict much would delay vaccination efforts instead continue vaccinations vaccine, public regards huge scepticism fear. someone house high risk many variables make prediction. I‚Äôm Chicago suburbs old people Nextdoor talking driving ‚Äúred areas‚Äù state get vaccinated. Enjoy shot! Good hear felloww quaritianers   Haematologists around world know symptoms look now, test treatment guy self sacrifices extremely irresponsible way use statistics. Yes, that‚Äôs still EU purchasing plan. Netherlands, Germany Sweden also get Pfizer average. 

What‚Äôs contract buy doses outside common purchasing agreement, eg go directly producer country. 

Exception vaccines EU contracted, eg Russian Chinese vaccines. Yes, have. Don‚Äôt feel bad been. lot people strongly quarantining push viewpoint, choices own. got text message though standard invite system via GP. idea why, way going refuse it. Half undergrad degree effectively taken away me.

Especially go certain weight body probably equivalates starvation I'm barely coming close weight normal thin person age height. Hello,

So saying still chance ü§£

No reason good bad comes mind laugh little Uhhh. J&amp;j one shot. 50 million Pfizer doses covers less half 55m j&amp;j Lockdown get cases low fast possible, vaccinations keep program sufficiently progressed. open much better position countries it. Correct: getting 1/40000 from? agree especially given fast moderna pfizer operations scaling US. We're gonna basically done whole country month rate. start exporting scale hundreds millions doses.

Might mean waiting weeks, maybe couple months. Seems totally worth me. Nows time approve proven therapeutics Leronlimab Cytodyn! Leronlimab saved former Philippine President Estrada took ventilator. one many examples Leronlimab saving lives. FDA &amp; Big Pharma holding back push BP Death Vaxx agenda making people believe it‚Äôs safe change world dynamics CV19. selling HOPIUM üêë killing people CV19 itself. Wake approve LERONLIMAB #FDA linked new study postulates free nucleic acids vaccines may reason behind super rare side effects,

That would imply understand precise mechanism causes VIPIT, no? Seems unlikely... Okay, read ""4 historically black medical schools..."". Thanks clarification.  I‚Äôm bit confused... UK I‚Äôm reading they‚Äôre trialling mixing different jabs jab1 jab2. Thing is, dad (80s) got second jab two weeks ago got AstraZeneca first time round Pfizer time. He‚Äôs trial fuck get mixed jabs they‚Äôre looking it? I‚Äôm pro-vax blood clotting potential side effect proven observable trend really good.


The way people disregarding danger implying people potentially let die greater good really outrageous. I‚Äôm going delay 1-2 months. I‚Äôll need fall sure since return campus, continuing quarantine practice safe social distancing mask usage need leave house.


I‚Äôm rather disappointed people implying concerned potential outcome specific vaccinations ‚Äòthe problem‚Äô you.


I don‚Äôt want die vaccine irresponsibly developed. comes issues known beforehand it‚Äôll even worse.


I‚Äôd rather vaccine take another year potentially lose percentage people like that.  Ireland study showed .1% cases outdoor spread.  Insert copypasta Bering Strait variant Incompetent human? using stuff? quite. Denmark able buy larger share Pfizer countries felt secure volumes bought. EU country wants allotment, bought internally. can‚Äôt find OBGYN willing hysterectomy I‚Äôm using birth control lighten periods. It‚Äôs either bleed heavy become anemic, already is. really sucks don‚Äôt choice.  Tl;dr people exercise healthier healthier people die less Israel‚Äôs economy fully open month cases continue decline. Usually countries control COVID testing enough reporting still excessive deaths way normal. check lot different places site looked low excess deaths Japan compared countries like US Brazil. None. Hence go rigorous testing number low possible, serious risk harm made known *BEFORE* medicine rolled general public, after.  certain demographic groups. 

For instance, 30's women died Norway vaccine clots COVID. guess understand science works, there's actually alot evidence demonstrates P1 evades current natural immunity, conclusively say enough real world data back statement fully yet. That's said ""it may"".

B117 B1351 variants natural immunity probably protects against. Natural immunity likely work P1 significant degree, considering recent study showed likely reinfected large portion people recently two-category dynamical model integrates genomic mortality data, estimate P.1 may 1.4‚Äì2.2 times transmissible 25-61% likely evade protective immunity elicited previous infection non-P.1 lineages. compared neutralization USA-WA1/2020, neutralization B.1.1.7-spike P.1-spike viruses roughly equivalent, neutralization B.1.351-spike virus robust lower.** data also consistent lower neutralization titers virus full set B.1.351-spike mutations virus either subset mutations. findings also suggest mutations result amino acid substitutions K417N, E484K, N501Y receptor-binding site greater effect neutralization 242‚Äì244 deletion affecting N-terminal domain spike protein. 

So yes, P1 avoid natural immunity based evidence have, based tests we've seen, P1 neutralized enough current vaccines warrant usage. major reason CDC encouraging everyone vaccinate even previously infected. 

You go ahead admit wrong. Haematologists around world know symptoms look now, test treatment statement best entirely speculative. overreaction I'm alarmed anyone would say that. government pharmaceutical companies' way ensuring life lost effort save lives. Try explaining families deceased persons government's actions ensure another person die like loved ones overreaction.

The comments see Reddit though. scary easily get control. descending curve January February looked promising. Come man, means need higher % people vaccinated full effect, like Israel's got to. We're getting there, worry. possible get information manufactured? I‚Äôm sure medical community knows, keep seeing Emergent BioSolutions‚Äô name there. actually released vaccines public, destroyed?

The article question hate think often already this: cutting speed limits half would definitely save lives. point consider convenience versus risk generally pick number somewhere middle. thing is, it‚Äôs dad that‚Äôs risk: it‚Äôs people‚Äôs dad may come contact with. Assuming first 70% effective, UK vaccinated 50% population 35% drop would vaccines.

That's best case reality elderly gotten vaccine real drivers spread. one rather important caveat:

Having partially vaccinated population issue. unvaccinated population get sick. Denmark they're young, summer way they're tired lockdown. party mingle summer.

Having large unvaccinated population means:

1. Infections mutations
2. Covid try jump vaccinated population happen often. mutations tries means probability mutation defeat vaccines goes up. Yep, read study think reasonable one MANY reasonable theories time. Bare minimum, something thoroughly investigated. 

As stated above, seems may far rigorous standards free nucleic acids. alone could something would cause Sputnik fail batches AZ/J&amp;J would pass. Additionally, aforementioned QC process could driven process development utilize longer thorough TFF (which would remove nucleic acids). would mean purification protocol *per se* unique rather implemented QC protocol. average age India 26 years old compared 38 U.S., life expectancy 10 years lower U.S. (so *far* lower % elderly people), obesity rate half high. 

It's extremely likely India's death rate (total deaths meaningless comparison given population size differences) lower U.S. based factors alone. Grow up. said. Women want/ need able get it, BC talked something women take serious medication side effects.  Thank clarification -- indeed different kinds blood clots, vaccine indeed potentially deadly. much lower risk vaccination, everyone pointing out, fortunately...! someone obese, Covid showed need change. I‚Äôm 22, know keep living way I‚Äôm living die prematurely. I‚Äôve lost 25 lbs course past 6 months. Still journey ahead it‚Äôs good know it. advice people overweight interactions obese individuals gentle. Obesity caused many things. case, childhood trauma mixed eating disorder. Many obese people already struggle depression anxiety mental health issues contribute weight gain. very, hard. Obese people need help, told existence burden. article exercise groups regardless obesity, hopeful people interpret that's benefit limited to. Whether someone underweight, regular exercise benefits immune system, promotes increased cardiovascular capacity, improves mood. Alright sounds like good time. curious, look like ACIP meeting vote new recommendations J&amp;J vaccines. can't imagine CDC FDA would differ guidance we'll probably see go back online soon. Haematologists around world know symptoms look now, test treatment right, fair point. would note number deaths increased 20% since interview, way young people getting sick, B.1.1.7 variant 60% transmissible original track become predominant strain U.S., what‚Äôs happening Michigan isn‚Äôt exactly great rest us.

Also, one prediction year detailed discussions predictions public‚Äôs benefit. It‚Äôs bad track record all. Almost every comment sub frequent starts downvotes. can‚Äôt take seriously. rare type clot made WORSE blood thinners. God hope so. home state Oregon seen somewhat steady rise cases couple weeks now. vaccinations though I‚Äôm really hoping cases start fall soon Haematologists around world know symptoms look now, hot test treatment [here ...the available options experiencing regional stockouts? ones countries access people may die COVID meantime (more statistically would blood clots)?

The risk assessment nearly simple make be. country decide stand case/death rates. estimate many people may die COVID access vaccines limited stopping administering AZ/J&amp;J vaccines, many people would die blood clot related issues administering AZ/J&amp;J vaccines. Comparing two would give best data make informed, rational decision. Haematologists around world know symptoms look now, hot test treatment shook 12 hours tired day Seems right me, always get downvoted tell people 30% US population TOPS immunity previous infection rather 50% people claim reason, even developing countries people need go every single day work street order survive reached 50% maybe reaching it.

Also another thing I'd like add, since last 14 days around 24 million people given first doses I'd say dont really significant protection, would equate around 7% US population believe. No, *not* make original claim. ""Get lazy arse"" look usernames making accusations please.

Anyway, country also purchased ""many vaccines"" (well, two), entitled choose one want take, that's many countries; saying many vaccines purchases really show anything. Exactly!

And ""not ideal""? No, forbidden Rules PPE. There's correct way put stuff on, take off, adjust touch anything wearing it. Anything else violates rules results severely increased risk contamination. Isnt now? remember seeing paperwork saying ""we arent liable"" Man humans understand risk. 

Shouldn't really compare risk complications risk dying covid. That's really big covid risk anymore. 

We know rarity blood clots age sex can't main factors - see hell lot issues. 

And know staying lockdown, terrible people's mental physical health. know variants rapidly spreading mutating. 

Additionally know modern world information dangerous. headline last forever. vaccines safe. passed trials. Get people's arms. antivaxx shit insane. SAME. entire upper back sore hell... it‚Äôs like worked haven‚Äôt days. Yes, indeed. enormous amount politiking scare mongering vaccine. ridiculous. They'll say ""he's predicted 8 past four waves"" exactly true, general idea correct not. Also severe cramping IUD insertion several weeks. Nothing helped cramping. I‚Äôd insane put again. believe Krispy Kreme, giving free doughnuts people dropped 20 lb.? Oh right, won‚Äôt that‚Äôs popular. Get vaccinated, get free doughnut. sells recently complete study vaccinated people chances getting infected?  standard scientific process fine. lab leak conjecture soundly rejected actual analysis. zoonotic origin conjecture (which is) proven either. pangolin route shot down.

Where again? Ah yes, we‚Äôre blaming frozen seafood unknown origin China constructed report likely origin. Sounds like solid scientific hypothesis. Pretty similar. office never closed day missed Covid, one took husband's O2 low freaking out. 

Husband fully vaccinated now. We've done normal. We've gone eat three times. went mini-roadtrip low density cold beach. awesome. 

However, tried grocery shopping person first time since last March (other single item two) stand it. many people lax mask usage made us super uncomfortable. I'm sure he's right things! things. said February going see something like seen yet country,‚Äù Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director Center Infectious Disease Research Policy University Minnesota, Minneapolis, said NBC‚Äôs [Meet sitting beach it‚Äôs 70 degrees, perfectly blue skies, gentle breeze. see Hurricane 5, Category 5 higher, 450 miles offshore,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúAnd telling people evacuate nice blue sky day going hard. also tell hurricane coming.‚Äù

And he's since quietly backtracked. USA, 16-29 year olds able get vaccines pretty easily. I‚Äôm 25, friends 22-28 years old we‚Äôre point got doses. UK purchased many vaccines, forced take specific one. way, made original claim, get lazy arse provide sources. stored 2-8C two weeks anyone working old school version vaccine? messaging vaccines, actual vaccine similar polio, rhubella (sp), small pox, Etc.... exactly created mechanism. keeps things nice transparent. #5G Gang üí™üò§üíâ one getting downvoted Im delusional idiot Sure buddy.

No one that. EU ordering Pfizer instead AZ J&amp;J reliable, convenient better tested. Dumb statement.

Given risk demographic clots primarily young women, lower risk clotting COVID, may true exactly need investigate. things need look at:

1.) need determine actual risk profile vaccine induced clots young women, specifically, since getting clots. number higher current numbers, 7 million people currently vaccinated young women would risk.

2.) need determine baseline risk kind clotting young women without vaccine.

3.) need determine risk clotting COVID demographic compare rate severity clots clots.

To give idea important, countries europe determined people 30, risk clotting outside vaccine actually *may not* higher risk vaccine induced clotting. Given vaccines available, may advisable divert younger people. also provides argument excluding non-US designed vaccines good.

Pfizer Pfizer/BioNTech.. American-German, main tech (mRNA) BioNTech Yeah, someone doesnt take vaccine decision doesnt stop virus transmitted. really fan potential mandatory vaccines. realize US gov funded good bunch mRNA tech what's used Pfizer moderna vaccines us virtually unlimited supply now? lol guess they'll say anything get people take vaccine. course seriously sick guess getting either.. push local governments build outdoor ""gyms""-like areas - public good way less expensive healthcare costs. high-quality large playgrounds, parks, cycling roads.

Yup. sub pretty much summarized ""anything less severe would get Covid"", read all.

It's like one big pro covid-vaccine tunnel vision here, disregarding serious issues vaccine anything medical outside it. ""Diplomatic tool""...

This crisis repeat one point. States, specially rich ones ability it, shown learned lessons. Big pharmaceutical companies, whether intention accident, failed us big time.

Could agree more!

Yes, CDC says recommendation. state Illinois example said lift mask mandate CDC removes recommendation. People need either stop religiously following everything CDC says, CDC needs start providing advice that's applicable real world. one two things happens, we're one-way road toward vaccine hesitancy endless restrictions. bllod clot brain sounds pretty dangerous might well lead death. sooo, yeah think got Johnson shot two days ago felt much anything.

Because 100,000 times people dying Covid vaccine side effects. need pfizer covishield. need licence covaxin multiple pharma companies boost production. shortage areas. areas nobody's even coming get vaccinated excess doses available. result poor coordination management. awesome man. spent lot time pre-vax accounting interactions, risk (mid 20s major health issues) got COVID outside work I'd blow time quarantine, lose + able see lot family, including two grandmothers, much. got shot booked flight weeks later see older grandma. ever confident without it. shot bought something extremely valuable - time people stay away from. priceless. nausea day it‚Äôs possible still effects blown proportion like covid overall.

chance death normal healthy adult 0.1%

chance blood clot 0.1%

we need stop letting news go crazy making seem 50/50 chance rather really is. I'll pick appt, thanks. literally get told vaccine offering today *if OK that* point vaccination.

You definitely get choice. OK it, say 'No' organise getting different vaccine. Moderna rolled earlier week example. CDC website, 0-17 there's almost 2.9 million documented cases Children Serious Inflammatory Syndrome ***No Covid Symptoms***

That‚Äôs insane. What‚Äôs news newsworthy it‚Äôs generally *not* norm ....it seems literally wasn't, mate. talking deranged stranger? It‚Äôs pretty simple. 1 7 million better 500,000+ dead people (just speaking US alone). Nobody wants one guy died lightning strike, drive home rain storms anyway. It‚Äôs common sense basic risk management. Also, nobody forced take AZ vaccine it‚Äôs sacrificing somebody greater good like you‚Äôre trying portray this. Good good know worst part blocking products countries produce depend entirely complications arise? remember correctly use different Adenovirus' vaccine, unless complication Adenovirus general probably that. Could spike protein general? that's case, COVID would increased risk factor, would Moderna Pfizer vaccines, since body builds proteins.

Either way, need lot research figure going on. hope slowed wealthy countries dropping AZ. tweet video statement, genius. Source? shame Denmark given fear-mongering rationality. There's already shortage vaccines EU they're going say available vaccines? Compare tiny, fully proven risk blood clotting, real risk catching covid19 proven death rate. 


This decision doomed certain number human beings death name safety - peak insanity. charts AZ vaccine risk vs clot risk risk.

As Indian first response anger. Pfizer sought approval early last year. met absolute indifference. Big cities (which coincidentally highest covid cases now) would benefitted now.
Now covid cases skyrocket, government franctically searching vaccines doses.
It's sad. Yes, apply bleach oxidizing agents. pathogen cannot evolve immunity oxidation. need citation understand vaccine magically turns severe disease mild one every single time without giving protection disease something pretty much exists reddit's wishful thinking problem, mine.

The vaccines provide high degree protection asymptomatic disease, severe disease minority cases actually gets infected. I've saying days now. I'm becoming incredibly afraid what's gonna happen supply inevitably outpaces demand next month. Facts. Mass represent exactly treat endometriosis condom? also pertains one ""unsettling"" components vaccination program. often forced get booster shots? must get every 6 months, vaccinate entire country time-frame? sister showed Excelsior Pass (immunity passport) yesterday expiration date 6-months received second dose. People called ‚Äùcovid patients‚Äù general absolutely unhealthy obese. Sure, trying imply able error bars data. meant error bars included making prediction particular day would silly multiple days could day cases start decline. 

Nothing wrong point estimate, point estimate high uncertainty. communicating uncertainty around estimate. Like ""I predict April 15th April 30th cases begin decline"" 

Overconfident predictions lead distrust.  depends. healthy obese? underlying conditions? perfectly healthy 40 human next chance dying. Could get severe symptoms? Possibly. even manageable like virus nature. That‚Äôs decision becomes scary. giving control situation. Even making wrong choice getting it, it‚Äôs personal control. yes consider circulating things cost dying. fully vaccinated 30 dunno. trying speak behalf taking wouldn‚Äôt worst moral decision. Nice exactly establishes vaccine confidence. Forcing vaccine might dire consequences covid good strategy. Although sounds bad way, really matter risk benefit. Single digit million chance rare side effects unfortunately preferable likely least 1 1000 chance death Covid per year. US first year 1.5 every 1000 people died. Countries like Denmark Norway handled pandemic better -- maybe almost order magnitude -- would probably find harder justify risk. got left armpit? It‚Äôs worth noting blood clots occurring vaccine significantly serious average blood clots. special type blood clots much lethal. it‚Äôs really fair comparison simply compare blood clot rate. still agree risks overblown, statistics presented provide accurate risk comparison. Monkey unfortunately doesn‚Äôt lot options, monkey sees one, takes 10% Rural Counties

 90% There's also isolated sycopal reactions post distribution necessarily show trials. Example being, everytime I've got typhoid vaccine body gets really hot immediately collapse pass minutes. Nothing seriously adverse I'm back normal come around. one, reaction needles unless lumbar puncture bother cause kind reaction.

Or, hear here, ship us shit bought paid year ago. boosters likely smoother. ramp production also likely won‚Äôt urgency get booster get people shots. share resources? understand, blood clots may appear healthy, under-40 women around 0.003% time, Covid fatality age group roughly order magnitude higher (I've seen figures around 0.02-0.08%).

All decisions made minimize harm, full-stop. Every death tragedy, full-stop. information comes vaccine may harmful particular demographic, need take absolutely seriously respond order minimize harm.

And time vaccine less harmful virus? Full speed ahead, complies principal minimizing harm person vicinity. 

I think painting people dogmatic psychopathic corners discussion favors. ""conspiracy theory"" weeks ago? Well prescribed medicine packing 60+ years old churches praying powerful god surely (this time) save catching virus dying hadn‚Äôt heard that. Everything I‚Äôve seen mentions affected female. quick search still didn‚Äôt find case, there‚Äôs reason believe affects everyone equally, total pause warranted. logic used J&amp;J shot covid. ""apples cashews"". comparing risks reality greater risk worse negative outcome covid J&amp;J shot.

The choices aren‚Äôt ‚Äúj/j covid‚Äù, correct choice ‚Äúj/j wait moderna/pfizer‚Äù. many young women, compare risks taking J J waiting different brand, difference outcomes much murkier. Yeah no. us debilitating cramps heavy flow risk worse cramps flow IUD acceptable. Sure, people neither, there's way tell one shoved body react.

Since ridiculous period terms cramps blood even regulated hormonal birth control (the ring) would never million years get IUD. ring improvement natural cycle, I'm going stick decide shut baby factory forever husband gets snip.

No one method ""default"" people wildly different reactions them. Different kind blood clots. can‚Äôt really compare birth control induced clots VITT. 

Furthermore superior alternative vaccines available risk inferior vaccine?

On positive note Pfizer/Biontech (again) committed increase number vaccine deliveries Q2 2021. alone offset AstraZeneca vaccines. higher efficacy rate

This bit contentious issue. video watched recently explained can't compare efficacy rates without context like this. argument trials done different times different covid climates data 1:1 comparable. one piece advice matters concerning losing weight; calories in, calories out. people move eat less, they'll lose weight. However, that's easier said done processed, high caloric foods readily available. Statistically speaking, numbers significant enough warrant taking vaccine. Covid somewhere 2 4% fatality rate. fear-mongering irresponsible spreading misinformation. Delaying vaccination thousands people kill far people unproven blood clots. 


You're also far likely develop blood clot sitting arse browsing reddit day. that's dramatic nobody cares. I‚Äôm anti government. also sat another country accounts handled second half pandemic terribly. UK gained much respect way handled vaccine rollout Germany. government doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt also pleased national successes. peculiarly British affliction. I‚Äôve looking one also haven‚Äôt found anything good. It‚Äôs frustrating pretty much infection rate models take vaccination rate account, don‚Äôt plot share vaccination rate model main case number model running Ugh stop repeating bullshit efficacy like morons. Birth control protect COVID.

Pfizer does. without blood clots. Canada also got earlier. could well imagine UK may also benefit somehow even public announcement yet. Fingers crossed. Osterholm made clear. assumed beginning, past data belief african americans would hardest segment population reach. time gone proved case, instead younger republican men, group covid shot. I've read articles it, found one using quick google search.  day 3 Johnson Johnson shot. 12 hours gnarly body aches head vice. Day 2 felt 97% better. last night got serious nausea lasted night. Still feel poopy morning. Anybody else get serious nausea J&amp;J? Okay still mean unusuable. realize majority world access better vaccines next year right? ever. comment like ignorant fact.

Not mention 50% remark misleading first place. Sinovac 78% effective mild symptoms up. 50% number includes mild symptoms, trials even measured J&amp;J Moderna. Sinopharm 79% effective period. I‚Äôm avoiding talk Johnson&amp;Johnson situation household, information comes out. Sputnik also based adenovirus, presumably lack production capacity late 2021. think EU use either. However, individual countries (or regions) may try order them. I'd reckon people even read package insert medication taking, pop pills doctor/pharmacist told them. Czech Republic entered talks buying remaining AZ stock Denmark. Considering pitiful state vaccine supply country, even vaccine ""not good enough"" Denmark would pretty welcome. kill people

I hate train thought letting die sake many. Everyone's life valued. Situation getting better going bring back died vaccine making families suddenly forever them. contracting virus dying it. Distributing mRNA vaccines many parts developing countries would impractical though, risk v reward quite different. Boy, love ‚Äúlet‚Äôs drag forever‚Äù crowd 

(This sarcasm) 

Bet loving life loving bonuses, want drag longer needed Lol responses polar opposites other. I‚Äôd say wait week, nothing lose. reopening possibly delayed weeks.

The vulnerable already vaccinated, Denmark hit especially hard anyway.

By now, since hospitals know treat Covid, vast majority get seriously ill suffer illnesses. statistically significant certain demographic remove total population. 

I want thing maybe bit blind here. sorry hear that. Lockdown rubbish. hope okay.

Except weird new developments block specific parts science. arm pretty sore 5 days. 6th day barely notice it. apply pressure tell.

As comparison, contraceptive pill know cause blood clot rate 0.3 1%,which 10'000 vaccine Cue pearl clutching! Faith healing religions like Christian Scientists.

I'm also advocating top altruism, semblance balance.

It look like effective side effect friendly ones got demonized aka Pfyzer ans Moderna. reasoning regulators Germany, Austria Norway actually applied? interpretation?

The reason ask seems arguing vaccine given risk it. irrational. world downside vaccine. risk get Covid infection, UK risk generally higher risk vaccine.

The UK regulators decided continue recommend AZ vaccine people 30 - given current situation regard prevalence virus, current vaccine supply situation - vaccine safer it. 

In countries mentioned, prevalence new Covid cases much higher UK. Per million population, new case numbers roughly 5x higher Norway 10x higher Germany Austria. risk vaccine 5x 10x higher UK, whereas risk vaccine course same.

Of course, countries huge supplies vaccines need use AZ all, without delaying vaccination programme, course should. case risk AZ vaccine zero. (This may approximate situation parts USA.) case, using AZ make difference vaccinated later, calculations relative risk surely way proceed. test's fault Covid's? CSVT diagnosis requires imaging. poorly described poorly studied reason. long known pregnant women women contraceptives get cerebral venous strokes, incidence may lower types clots, find hard believe much lower cases cause concern. could *any* immune challenge, vaccination actual infection, marginally increases risk CSVT population that's already susceptible CSVTs. We're talking 6 people 7 million here. delays continue, we're condemning thousands people death COVID-19 due immune reaction that's obscure practically impossible study.

Everything course depends immunologic memory, systematically measured Pulendran, immunologist Stanford University Palo Alto, California, reached frustrating conclusion vaccine durability. ‚ÄúI keep saying, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs well understood, it‚Äôs well understood.‚Äô one major issues Probably easier conducting national elections.  idea means. It‚Äôs lot conjecture. you‚Äôre post doctorate know better. Depends risk factors. 25 year old healthy male, basically risk Covid all. looks unlikely, least 2-4 weeks. members ACIP believe enough data say safe, especially 50% J&amp;J vaccines administered past 2 weeks (which long takes symptoms show).

Current discussion seems either realm voting continued pause holding vote today, really thing. know kids district classes set start year went back person/hybrid least one teacher per grade per school ""remote one"" grade level. fill survey start year preferred learning mode tried match person remote teachers students preferred choice within reasonable numbers. 
Problems came changed mind switch remote hybrid (which matching trimesters, even switched remote one month fall january) one way could change choices trimester, due number limits especially person classes (which 2/3 families fall peak heard schools packed remote classes 30+ kids unsual district least elementary level) kids may changed teachers 2 3 times parents keep mind set wanted.

My kids got lucky got matched teacher kept year long, one remote one person mostly case many multiple kids families. vastly encounters cars tho. single shot giving chances. shot avoid getting another vaccine. Plus still 1 20,000 dying car get shot Trust science!!   mean, guess ""long way over"" better another 2 weeks? count tiers quite restrictive UK locked since septemberish last year. includes pretty harsh lockdown since Jan opening amazing. Second dose? Sounds like taking one vaccines link. It‚Äôs sounding like they‚Äôre gonna continue pause, panel pointing lack information evidence make decision. use evidence pure fallacy operating assumption visual trend underlying cause. underlying condition likely owned woman, unique women, cause, idea risk men are. it, hypothetical world turned every woman clots breast cancer, surprise random cases women, smaller percent men get breast cancer might still benefit know. *think* know thats exclusive women, know. given might know cause, idea risk men. Hell, sample sizes small are, theres still luck factos distribution along gender. Men women different, dumb to, investigation (you know, thing they're now), assume human safe another human symptoms based size incredibly small. folks don‚Äôt wear masks, refuse get vaccinated less chances procreate. *is* good news! Currently listening, sounds like going paused information. least one dose. quarter county (~25.5%) fully vaccinated. Still impressive nonetheless! That‚Äôs EU didn‚Äôt stop vaccine exports. EU produced doses would used EU first, numbers would different. 

Since pandemic world wide problem, agree EU policy regarding this. Athletes vaccinated

Source? Amazing, said wrong Thanks DARPA! obese got covid last year. worst thing ever ( fortunately case, given obesity considered risk factor ). said, changed life 100% episode. lost almost 17 pounds body much better used be. easy. fact, pretty hard.

I'm worried children. I've seen many obsese children eating lot fried potatoes crap food. What's going nowadays? really hope people wake late.  post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

EU decided share, taking forever IIRC Moderna side effects dangerous. vaccine simply triggers immune response body, make feel sick hours days, it‚Äôs causing actual health problems. Moderna‚Äôs side effects reported severe Pfizer‚Äôs, maybe Moderna uses larger dose, neither mRNA vaccines known cause clotting issues like J&amp;J might.

The people worried Moderna Pfizer allergic one vaccine ingredients. questions vaccine registration forms weed people. severe allergic reaction, would know.

I don‚Äôt know people downvoting you! It‚Äôs okay questions. don‚Äôt know long immune system remains immune vaccine. way know wait see mean yeah? shit? stable months now, even though we've opened british mutation widespread. United terrible airline. arm sore (got first shot yesterday) absolutely wiped rest day. happens get flu shots expecting that. took 3 naps got 0 work done lol. I've heard 2nd shot side effects noticeable maybe I'll take day get stabbed go back sleep. people don‚Äôt want get likely never likely never worried.

They‚Äôll get they‚Äôre required get go college/a sports game/concert/travel airline, I‚Äôm San Diego too. half fully vaccinated received least one dose? I've seen far, I'm seeing increased demand Pfizer Moderna. downvoted right. 30s alternate vaccine available get one. none available still give person AZ.

Fuck sub full incorrect information. Ridiculous move, good see available others. 30% way toward vaccinating entire population US (that's figuring 20M J&amp;J end). Assuming 90% get vaccinated, one third way there. 

If ramp 4M per day average, could done vaccinations end July. course it'll probably slow way toward end could reach say 5M sustained period 4M average seems possible. That's assuming everyone eligible course, including kids. FDA's discussing right now; know within hour.  implant last form birth control would suggest.

Wow I'm happy doctor weighing here. citations? AZ vaccine *does* less effective rate Pfizer. 

76% - real world efficacy- Pfizer, one clearly outperforming other, almost every metric. isn‚Äôt affecting men?? cases CVST young women haven‚Äôt they?

I agree point kind sexism. agree. It‚Äôs normalized women take birth control even might hurt men want unprotected sex. 

Guess I‚Äôll say goodbye karma Reddit using males can‚Äôt deal comments like this... got first shot yesterday!!! 156 million go. 52 days stay 3 million day pace. Add 14 days every adult wants vaccinated be. around June 20th fully reopen. year. I've feeling something like entire past year able put finger read this. thanks guess We're 100 million vaccines short AZ, means could double current doses given. whats chance j &amp; j vaccine getting unpaused? supposed take days think appointments going get cancelled :( happening happen. Right we‚Äôre still working ample demand though, haven‚Äôt really turned yet.

Colleges requiring in-person classes big step well, well sports teams requiring games, potentially airlines travel. Nope, according study did, would actually kill people use vaccine bullshit red tape EU Can't help much, many people report long covid negative PCR test. might covid related, even without positive test. Maybe due specific variant detected test? IgG test vaccination long symptoms might helped, see way distinguish vaccination induced immunity potential immunity created before, covid-like symptoms. 

Some people long covid get better days Pfitzer shots (the article said could long haulers could virus still alive, somewhere, would ""kicked off"" immunity conferred vaccine. hypothesis.). hope completely recovered soon! None said true. aw man, din't read thing. least fine already it.

And thank telling antidote covid, tell everyone guess big people top like truth come out. needed vitamins! According study did, won't, would actually cause deaths control. Im excited you! case, latest wave killed chance ""full reopening""' us economy year.

Why say that? vaccines effect Israel, wouldn‚Äôt open back up? deny vaccine get immunity naturally catching covid. also feel obligated stay locked anti vaxxers. everyone opportunity vaccinate need open shop. First off, big fan. Thank üòä

I think question analysis soon demand issues, supply. seems like 5/1 numbers may decreasing. Hard know happens then.

I really feel children, cannot vaccinated yet get benefit careful society starting couple months. 6 women probably birth control. CDC investigating that.

More likely J&amp;J vaccine still approved recommended women taking birth control. 

Regardless, it‚Äôs alarming don‚Äôt consider clotting birth control dangerous. much fucking misogyny it‚Äôs gross. Lol what? Doctors refuse acknowledge IUD inserted painful procedure yet people like pass vomit pain. Plus everyone comfortable idea foreign body chilling uterus. Oh idea it‚Äôs actually working it‚Äôs moved risk failing. EU, unlike US UK, exports lot vaccines receives (10s percent) countries can't afford themselves. See COVAX.

US, customary, said fuck everyone else (Canada especially) banned vaccine exports. troubles EU deliveries related that.

So yeah, really puts perspective. father gets first dose next wednesday. Hes last family (immediate extended) get vaccine exception hospitals overwhelmed, no, reason can't reopen. Looking Israel, even get 50% population vaccinated, problem. expect long tail people eventually get vaxxed, maybe right away. 

Personally know folks hesitant, they‚Äôve seen essentially one bad reaction, they‚Äôre signed get one. 

I think we‚Äôll see big slow around 60%, cities/states probably upwards 80% kids approved.  tweets like Trump.

Sad! One word: Politics

If EU makes British vaccine look bad makes EU vaccine look better it‚Äôs like saying better UK.

The EU won‚Äôt care deaths make UK look bad. least sensible people left Europe. lockdownies lives decaying nothing. suggest giving read. might find well, best tool arm information. find here: here:  Well average Joe listens media know understand this. viruses, mean? Probably! mean, one million chance common knowledge, must something else going it. Maybe can't point occurs all? Lol thank god live America actual freedom. UK Europe live dystopian nightmare. opinion downvote idc. üòöüòö One thing conveniently left fact Pfizer Moderna working new covid vaccines variants mind mRNA vaccines effective variants begin with. Much better, thank asking. fever, good! drop oxygen levels 94, one son went 92 day ended back urgent care. back 95/96. lungs clear, exhausted coughing oxygen down. 

One went school today athletics. still home. 19 year old Cali, already got doses might much. Everyone know wants vaccine least first dose now. probably going 60 something percent instead 50, getting much likely require restrictions/limitations/extra steps non vaccinated people. Sure, thinking asymptomatic cases also people may caught COVID early thought flu.

Not sure immunity still holds people, probably true ""infected"" figures counted towards immunity. Check discussion /r/medicine sub. Right outset, doctors asking, six women adversely affected J&amp;J‚Äôs shot birth control?

JFC Per article dated December 2.1 million shots given people,¬†according Centers Disease Control Prevention. That‚Äôs far cry U.S. health officials‚Äô original goal injecting least 20 million Americans first shots end year.

Like night day, took someone taking seriously. tool Europe knows. hope they'll prosecuted crimes done.  Lol, completely misinterpreted point.
Im also young woman never taken estrogen pills get migraines. definitely wasn‚Äôt trying negative category people literally includes myself. 

My point shows society somewhat sexist it‚Äôs perceived normal (or want insist, least some) women UK take pill greater chance blood clots vaccine. But, soon it‚Äôs something affects men well, it‚Äôs banned many countries everyone makes big fuss it. 

I probably could explained better first post though tbf Two five Californians (~40%) least one dose; according California D.P.H., county-- San Diego-- close vaccinating half total population (~49.4%). amazing news eve universal adult eligibility statewide! Arizona registration site says bring insurance card one tried give mine clinic got vaccinated, said need it. Can't people making decisions, silly completely wrong. deaths births documented. Upwards 95% think always used masks since pandemic. dampened transmission rate. need vaccine. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  EU failed experiment hope continent survives hubris. üëÜ Math challenged  ""Any extension pause invariably result vulnerable individuals US, prime candidates Johnson Johnson vaccine, remain vulnerable. risk remain risk.""

Listen guy ACIP, need continue pause J&amp;J vaccine time Cases across country rising, need get people vaccinated. telling Canadian government also millions dollars throw something like Canada smart enough engineers scientists get running given blueprints? Must worth financially, considering many countries world skilled personnel, seems like almost global responsibility 1st world country means producing vaccine right now. even know long need revaccinated. Surely building many vaccine factories right across globe? Idk suggested 6 years also suffer migraines 100 stopped. mileage may vary. 50% 18 seems odd considering many people know heard say getting it. clearly intelligent enough realize problem messaging, vaccine.

The vaccine way this. We're waiting officials (government private) catch up. don‚Äôt change anything? seems like Covid stay. think stay age forever? invincible forever? Gracias Obama Heyo feeling now? got Pfizer ‚Äúfully immune‚Äù 7 days Really funny one friends phobia getting shots, yet became anesthesiologist well. like, huh??  Yeah basically :) Temperature normal, feel pretty fatigued. know normal I'm willing put opposed getting COVID. Uh, part post even slightly political lol Probably Austin. Lancet journal published paper connecting vaccination autism... would careful trusting much got mine, still asked insurance odd since free, seemed surprised told none. also surprising since employer information said ""none"". data posted excludes Texas, 9% US indicates 85.9% 65+ population Texas received least one dose, significantly higher national average.

This account discrepancy. 

Using Demographic data excludes TX, 79.1% 65+ received least one dose.

(79.1%\*91%) + (85.9% \* 9%) = 79.7% really. No. least he's never gonna use stuff himself. might advantage actually! absolutely still go outside. ran winter (including -15F/-26C day) Minnesota year truthfully bad all, need proper attire, afford since gym shut down.

The weather Canada (in parts people actually live, talking Nunavut/NWT) get much worse weather Minnesota.

Gyms essential-ish, also major infection sources. 
Minnesota Department Health rather detailed study, described this, speculation. conveniently leave out. follow literature closely, actually. long-term implications letting COVID circulate indefinitely, one-off solutions one-off mutations. agree. 

It would much worse find hiding it... interesting usually movements happen Tuesdays. Good news regardless.  feels surreal, last year US president telling everyone would disappear 14 months later still struggling it. really mean

Can use example here

I work PRM airport, whole last year able go work, told stay home, paid full

What cannot say vaccine, expect allowed stay home get paid full pulled ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù card, choose vaccine  No? nice attempt try pain rude something lol. don‚Äôt see need take unless it‚Äôs actually way back normalcy. Based awful messaging we‚Äôve gotten far, getting vaccine changes nothing terms getting back normal don‚Äôt see need take point. That‚Äôs all. there's nothing special vaginal sex. suppose less tiresome, sure hell much risky.

As young adult, vaginal sex unavailable time, since multiple ways enjoying sexual contact another person, issue it. comes implementation detail.

Anyway, thread haa gone completely off-topic. Shame us. Pardon! Fertility tracking + diaphragm us! yet cases exploding everywhere. Something right. People given up.   J&amp;J blood clots nothing burger really even deserve mentioned. 1 clot million vaccinations literally nothing. 1 50 covid patients dies, comparison.

mRNA vaccines look great efficacy. Blood clots issue. maybe posted drivel? That's accurate analogy. Allah made compulsory deliver message laws great punishment touch . get money Allah rich , supplies everything provider everyone everything . Muhammad PBUH come miracles still exist till today read ( Quran ) , truly search truth shocked everyone world blind . May Allah guide truthful peace follow light . virus used vector cannot replicate cells. get inside deliver instructions make spike protein, make copies itself. There's every reason expect vaccine end this, long level virus spread still high even vaccinated people uncomfortably high level risk. vaccination rates increase level viral spread decrease tolerable levels.

After all, efficacy based upon relative risk. 90% reduction 10% chance infected quite different 90% reduction 0.1% chance infected. long there's still aggressive spread virus, absolute risk quite lot higher. Yeah NE fucking provincial might well five hours away nearest town places.  69% according u/Wizmaxman according Fauci 85% trust United? Remember United Breaks Guitars? Agreed. I'll correct original post. clots seen AZ J&amp;J ""clots"": recipients experiencing extremely low platelet count time. Unfortunately, due widespread inability recognize thrombocytopenia/thrombus combinatory issues, anything 20 case studies directly linking type issue COVID. Right rate similarly idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura around 9.5k 10 million. That's significant enough difference put clotting risk perspective. hormonal trigger TTP, I'm interested see test anyone ADAMTS13. pause vaccine rollouts test? Absolutely. know many things science cannot proved hard evidence? Thats literally half reason statistics exist. prove risk men, based existing evidence, statistically insignificant. gonna able tiny ass sample size, next couple weeks gonna get data whether like not.You cant say risk 0 questionable fuck hypothesis says so. Thats people die. Potentially killing men could taken alternative vaccine risk wasnt yet falsifiable enough idiotic. 'Men affected far women been' science. falsifiable hypothesis relies assumption cannot make sort confidence, assumption individuals women exclusive cause side effect. Youre attempting base 'scientific fact' nothing correlation. first 10 people die covid complications happened women (maybe women severe prexisting conditions cant see) said ""well cant say men need worry isnt falsifiable"", think sound Intelligent? This. Hopefully plan start public service announcements convincing sitting fence. Looks way get creative like

\- Partnering big companies offer vaccine discounts

\- Opening cruises early vaccinated

\- Offering free concerts condition vaccinated take shot concert

Then think start setting soft deadlines federal government sway

\- military

\- College students

\- Health care workers nursing home staff

I wonder many young people would get vaccinated $20 Starbucks ITunes gift card. much fuel cost however? feeling Michigan first many states resurgence. It‚Äôs free. know Denver rural county. Tomorrow 2 week full immunization day. Time go lick door knobs! That‚Äôs brutal 1 40,000 number certainly verifiable trend - unsourced ""best estimate"" Danish Health Authority. UK actually released statistics complications they've reported 1 250,000. Meanwhile, reported complications J&amp;J currently 6 7,000,000.

I absolutely understand concerning. guarantee would feel concern offered either vaccines. ultimately irrational anxiety, harm caused substantial slowing vaccination rate guaranteed dwarf harm caused side effects. Makes sense since half country stupid shit, think we'll comfortably pass 60%. good stop company selling Aids contaminated blood. Profit insurance called make appointment didn‚Äôt readily available. said never mind, don‚Äôt worry it.  interesting study, hard find lot breakthrough cases since incredibly rare. male I'd chance blood clots AZ I'd 1 % Covid. Also we're currently trying spread Covid Germany vaccine would prevent that. stats right? 1 million get bloodclot? rant confirm either way? No, not. AZ vaccine form deadly covid measurement. GBS (Guillain-Barre Syndrome) happens 1-2 100,000 people (Autoimmune related) people concerned clots happen lower incidence. STOP FEAR MONGERING!!! Yee haw skeeter!! Okay bit context

What fauci say: ""it still safe eat indoors general""

""Even vaccinated people (no specifics fully vaccinated fully vaccinated) need cautious avoid crowded areas""

What fauci say: ""vaccinated people cannot go reataurants"" Lol. feel bad laughing this. May 12 general population April 26 18+ risky around people certain belief system think Covid big deal vaccines let Bill Gates track you. Dude, I‚Äôm going hell, I‚Äôm laughing ass off! Needles reason I‚Äôm nurse. handle bodily fluids ease, moment needle becomes present, go fight mode live United States waiting turn get vaccinated, turn. Make appointment. least try. vaccine free. insurance, still free. free. 

I understand people eligible yet, likely eligible 19th, Monday.

Don‚Äôt depend local pharmacy dose you. likely appointments available nearest mass vaccination sites. mass vaccination sites I've absolutely top notch, well run, clean efficient. Walgreens took relative not. thanks. get reasoning putting though. churlish? easily fixable TV ads (which know coming).

&amp;#x200B;

i've already seen google ads ""find vaccine near me""

&amp;#x200B;

but right now, we're point need chase people get shots.

my state opens 16+ tomorrow (most counties already have).. 

there's ***huge*** demand appts right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I think July/Aug - mass vax centers gone.. people sent neighborhoods. schools, libraries, etc..

Anyone get apportionments aren‚Äôt hard come by. Germany also made expensive difficult get tested like month ago. One friends needed test travel work January cost like 100‚Ç¨ pocket. lot places, symptoms *and* high risk get tested free. everyone allegedly get one free test week there's point everything closed. words, one reason free tests because, theory, needed present negative test go shopping, eat restaurant, go movies. things longer happening, reason someone without symptoms get tested. think people working home paid labor? going different Olympics expect.

Jesus fucking christ. risk ridiculously low sexes L542R

I thought L452R? double mutated strain also E484Q mutation (not confused similar E484**K** mutations found variants like Brazilian, ZA, UK variants).  course, bound Fauci's recommendations. opinion guidance incrementally shift toward restrictions needed vaccinated fairly quickly cases continue fall coming weeks, delaying vaccination buying 5-6 weeks restriction.  chance develop blood clot without vaccine? Coaches replaceable players. higher standard issue, leverage issue.

These million dollar investments management trying protect. 

I imagine required-vaccination clauses probably going part standard language players coaches contracts going forward. know arm implant ones risk? Idk anything birth control gf one may get redone soon. hope local/state governments set vaccinated % goals dropping restrictions. think would reduce vaccine hesitation end pandemic sooner. vaccination rollout complete complete non issue.

So agree then, good federal government absolutely would legislate airlines lose 30 percent revenues, no.

I'd assume would raise ticket prices. deaths continue decline

This aged poorly. 

""The number adults hospitalized Michigan COVID-19 reached 3,918 Monday, surpassing reported peak fall surge virus highlighting state's troubling trend."" Come back Pfizer gets WORLDWIDE tour Africa. Stay local western world. Pfizer could never #TeamAZ

I jest genuinely seen people Twitter use #TeamPfizer hashtag like stanning popstar, really quite depressing walk grocery store almost daily. 15 minutes go there, 15 minutes return. easy reach 22 minutes walk places. Next up: CDC scientists denied boarding multiple airlines. EU legal moral claim vaccines produced companies factories EU member states beyond rights conferred contracts. 

Legal? Yes, do. country block exports company whatever reason. EU could easily, US has. 

Moral? Morality fluid. What's moral one immoral another. EU could easily point fact continent oldest median age also visited continent world. Therefore, citizens risk (which exactly we're seeing, btw). US argue ""our citizens come first"", could've EU.

Face it, EU simply want operate way. could've. values. elegible? Moderna tricks well. well known mRNA research community. adenovirus vaccines see deviations spike protein.

2. New York surrounded states also well vaccination effort.
3. New York probably natural immunity parts country. We've using correlates protection influenza vaccines decades. start covid vaccines soon. pretty obvious neutralizing antibodies, better vaccine whole reason got AZ vaccine early age blood clotting condition, makes vulnerable. got vaccine find stuff, really seem causing blood clots people. feeling little terrified really want go second shot now, I'm given appointment. :-(  Idk fate J&amp;J vaccine air businesses/politicians treating CDC recommendations indisputable laws, see vaccine hesitancy rising vaccinations stagnating reach ""acceptable"" levels herd immunity.

Some counter risk dying virus miniscule havent risk acceptance measures applied implementing various pandemic controls e.g. lockdowns etc I've watching here.

So... limit 60% population vaccine 40% susceptible it? like Canada limit 55 years old older.

There's reason 60yo much lower chances 0 get clots access vaccines chance contracting serious covid infection higher 40 year olds younger? also unclear well

[Archive April 14 (CNA) Taiwan Wednesday reported five new imported cases COVID-19 revoked Cambodia's designation country low-to-moderate risk disease.

Two cases involved migrant workers Philippines, one woman 20s man 30s. tested positive COVID-19 finishing quarantine, Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said.

Two cases, British man 40s Taiwanese man 70s, also tested positive quarantine, CECC said.

The final case reported Wednesday involved Russian man 40s, infected COVID-19 still Russia December, arrived Taiwan negative test taken three days departure, according CECC.

The man traveled Taiwan late January began working ship Feb. 4. sea April 11 stop ports returning Taiwan, CECC said.

On April 12, took self-paid COVID-19 test hospital, result came back positive Wednesday.

To date, Taiwan recorded 1,067 cases COVID-19, 951 classified imported. total, 1,029 recovered, 11 died 27 hospital, according CECC statistics Wednesday.

Globally, COVID-19 infected 137 million people 193 countries regions, 2.9 million fatalities, CECC data shows.

Also Wednesday, Chen said CECC revoked Cambodia's status low-to-moderate risk COVID-19 country recently seen increase case numbers.

In Taiwan, business travelers countries deemed low-to-moderate low-risk COVID-19 apply quarantined fewer normal 14 days, long take self-paid COVID-19 test end quarantine period comes back negative.

Those low-risk countries apply quarantine lifted fifth day arrival, low-to-moderate risk countries seven days.

The current list countries regions CECC deems low risk COVID-19 New Zealand, Macau, Palau, Fiji, Brunei, Laos, Nauru, Marshall Islands, Bhutan, Australia, Singapore Vietnam.

Hong Kong listed low-to-moderate risk. never travel restrictions Michigan, I've encouraged people travel safe, mask up, get vaccinated,"" Whitmer said, according MIRS. ""We need show one another little bit grace. We're eager get out.""

Typical Fox News fake outrage. governor discouraging it, everyone individually. saying travel restrictions good thing? Nah. Yellow mustard. cost effective others.

Yeah til July. think federal government can't make safety regulations airlines?  long term monitoring course year two they're public?  love see seriously lost plot one. moral superiority running amok downvoted? It‚Äôs really obvious majority women world taken estrogen containing birth control.

Many women, like myself, don‚Äôt never take contraindicated conditions. Plenty women already take estrogen containing birth control EXACTLY blood clotting issues it. poo-poo concerns young women clotting issues vaccine ‚Äúbecause take bcp anyway‚Äù nonsense. 1000% this. kinds people ones keeping mask mandates (and similar) around long everyone US wants shot received it.

People getting swiftly growing segment vaccinated populace driven towards non-compliance 'mask up, everyone everywhere' attitude. whole ‚Äòefing world dumb. Except maybe NZ, Vietnam Israel.

They right.  better question would also need set outside US? No, Google Translate givers good results Danish English Good guy CDC... gonna happen though. would like see ""vaccinated only"" fights  No, known suffer low blood pressure sure actually. 20 million first doses 31 March UK 7 million doses USA date IIRC. condition rare picked mass rollout. True. think luxury pick one want opinion isn‚Äôt objective. want go school things need tested (if vaccinated) every third day so.

Denmark 450,000 tests every day (PCR + antigen). Population 5.8 million. Tests free. Ebolavirus vaccine using RSV successfully implemented side effects far know. Sorry knowing Danish  way UK hide behind covid reason Brits suffer economically long time bc Brexit  oh, sure! Yeah EU legal moral claim vaccines produced companies factories EU member states beyond rights conferred contracts. everyone gets taken EU Media Office official line take.  mom also got yesterday. I'm scared too, remember breathe. I'm keeping eye mom, making sure okay difficult part monitoring two weeks. going rough two weeks stay strong! adult seriously feel kids-young adults got stuck this.  2 years HUGE chunk life 16. 

The good news (hopefully) think going societal understandings made allow people reclaim year. forsee lot's college kids taking gap year (or two) employers/families etc. etc. encouraging this.

Congrats success! Good luck goals! didn't, though. EU problems Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna. We'll reach 50% vaccine coverage around mid May. forgot everything allowed take place indoors.

And hospitalizations already back rise.

Fortunately able flag volunteer go lay fainted. Absolutely. don‚Äôt understand that‚Äôs glaringly obvious two nobodies Reddit top health authorities country. So, get right, fine avoid vaccine would save life life others ensure kid slight risk killing zero risk killing others? ethically problematic. good reason that‚Äôs likely going case states end May-ish. Even strict states preference cascade actually ending restrictions beginning. also doubt vaccine passports everyday activities become widespread.

I thought sure mask mandates would gone summer also saw Disney CEO say thought would last till end year (although get better say move timeline push back - massive vaccine rollout)

Thanks reply ‚úåÔ∏è Mask mandate 50% clubs ""100% reopened"" Cool, didn‚Äôt know that. organisation responsible procuring vaccines screws things badly. that, inside (brought inside, touch 3 days, washed hell hands).

If get closer 75-80% vaccination, epidemiologists seem think we'll avoid fate altogether. difference annual COVID society herd immunity.

And say ""it's big deal, it'll sniffles vaccinated people"", 50% scenario creating perpetual petri dish new mutations escape vaccines (and like 10% like South African variant, much that). would matter ***when, if, vaccines stop working***.

I'm saying justification perpetual closure society. I'm saying there's huge difference 50% 80%. might decide reopening society worth cost perpetual COVID seasons. I'm pointing likely cost low amounts vaccine induced immunity. Same! Yay!! cases men women ages. PCR? No. 

Blood / antibodies, yes, could related past infection vaccine. good point mRNA vaccines (vs traditional ones) make body produce ""real"" spike, use prefusion conformation, might make immune system response wider able face variants. Dunno that's case DNA vaccines well (J&amp;J, AZ, etc.). know, chance? Well using delivered vaccines logic, it‚Äôs much better go company delivered exactly planned: Pfizer

While makes sense theory, much data back claim, mRNA widely used humain beings yet (AFAIK, trials cancer patients, looking long term effect tricker healthy young people). said, mRNA appears good tech could well future vaccination. might argue early say that's case not. UK mostly vaccinating old people AZ.

So case, we're really thinking autoimmune reaction -- there's points made there. First, autoimmune reactions present way initial trigger; virtually always present within 2-6 weeks inciting event. reason simple -- autoimmune reaction going strongest (if happens all) early immune response that's immune response going strongest. immune response suddenly going increase without reason future; would incredibly inefficient body, that's pretty strongly regulated immune system.

Basically, someone actually studies medicine molecular biology, seen *single* plausible explanation mRNA vaccines could cause effects way line. molecular biology mRNA mature field -- literally close 60 years old point -- really good understanding mRNA going handled cells going degraded quickly.

I'll take vaccines day. young friends potentially permanent lung damage. thank you. mean even AZ vaccine still extremely low rate blood clotting issue. good they're looking let's pretend like that's high percentage cases either. context really. understanding efficacy essentially well works optimal conditions effectiveness takes account variables directly observed, doesnt work example vaccines, effectiveness would consider someone stopping medication due side effects failure whereas efficacy would discard suboptimal conditions. something like *Cries Canadian* Nobody argue choose long try paint morally superior vaccinated people choose to. cannot assume people behind scenes made good decision. People behind scenes make bad decisions time. doesn‚Äôt mean expertise doesn‚Äôt matter. means limitations sometimes experts looking one perspective. 

If covid 100x deadlier is, think agree pause vanishingly rare side effect would ridiculous. suggestion pause that‚Äôs process anti-science wrong face it. political decision absolutely weigh alternative: people die covid decision. 

I also reject idea 2 approaches: pause vaccine investigation. middle ground possible here: say extremely rare dangerous side effect investigating, given severity pandemic rarity side effect, continuing vaccinate conduct investigation. path would admit public potential problem also note pandemic need keep vaccinating. 

This actually reminds lot different decisions US UK made whether wait second doses. People sub VEHEMENT following stage 3 trial protocols exactly way, anything else anti science.

Tell people get it, agree ""risk"" there's liability AZ. I'm willing take 1 million chance, die it. There's zero risk situations life. larger chance die stroke tomorrow know. Fuck yeah, send shit over. Imagine Morocco considerable intelligence capability Europe one behind clot debacle get rejected vaccines. Depends whether that's bigger smaller shit ton shit ton people dying virus. probably getting soon US lot places hitting supply/demand inversion. public health officials fear could hit large parts nation soon 3 weeks now.

This coupled pfizer's announcement able top pledged doses 10% international doses hitting soon.

That said available options pretty good there's risk adverse side effects rain vastly outweighs risk. struggling fucking hard lot extreme sentiments performatively cautious people hurling around.

I spoke couple friends earlier year talking vaccine coming (I second shot February). mentioned much safer going make feel. One went long tangent *him* he's worried about, chance could asymptomatically pass COVID chain could result literally thousands deaths. used phrase ""blood hands"". extreme example, *many* similar sentiments encountered.

These friends texted week they're getting vaccinated ""freedom dates"" mid-May hang then. I'm like...really? you, understand feeling protection? sure spend whole hangout mentally calculating distance us silently tearing apart tiny, tiny % risk we're taking socializing?

I'm tired performative judgment. I'm tired people acting like excessive, extreme caution socially acceptable way approach this, ESPECIALLY turn fucking dime moment get shot scheduled. im going expectation get infected. whole purpose reduce severe illness. breakthrough talk gives hesitant people reason continue hesitant got first Moderna shot today! ready pandemic!! Yeah killing perfectly healthy people vaccine, cares participated phase 3 trials, nothing professionalism experience AZ. true. absolutely get Covid vaccinated. odds getting course much lower severity case would likely great reduced. certainly still get it, though. 

I saying person replied shouldn‚Äôt go ride car friends. That‚Äôs call (and would likely ride friends). correcting false information here. Haha no. Left upper arm must've affected lymph nodes arm pit area although doc feel swelling. Mine's due next Wednesday, I'll gladly take earlier European country wishes donate AZ. exactly do. need press forward. hundreds dying covid per day immeasurable economic suffering due NPIs, handful clots *very* acceptable trade-off. could *thousand* people get clots vaccine would still less number prevented Covid deaths. pause one-in-a-million side effect penny-wise pound-foolish. I'd specifically high risk younger women? younger men? Conspiracy theories? didn‚Äôt see Fauci admitting understated percentage needed herd immunity purposefully, people would accept goal? said masks weren‚Äôt needed we‚Äôd health workers?

Have even read article? doubt it. What‚Äôs interesting birth control also causes clotting issues‚Äî I‚Äôve seen bad cases‚Äî don‚Äôt take market. surely affects way women 7 7 million too. Fuck em. 

That‚Äôs honest take. don‚Äôt want vaccine, moving without you. I‚Äôm going weep die, end hospital. 

Not worried kids now. want vaccinated, can‚Äôt use kids reason adults go business. Fewer kids died 2020 2019, presumably stuck inside instead swimming friend‚Äôs pool, statistically likely die compared covid. LMAO. would expect someone else take vaccine benefit, ""go live woods?"" afraid covid, one retreating woods? ever read Presidents Cardoso, Lula, Rousseff? them? Go read operation ""Lava Jato"" - uncovered small portion corruption. Cardoso started presidency hand-full apartment tower-blocks Sao Paolo finished 500.

When completely corrupt - say one ""more corrupt"" another?

I think easy North American commentators attach criticism presidents political affiliations oppose - reality rotten. 

This one rotten middle even bigger emergency emergencies Brazil always has. maybe looks bit incompetent, rotten useless normally do. You‚Äôre willing die morons can‚Äôt isolate. Interesting don‚Äôt mean Europe, mean many populations skeptical vaccines Europe. Anybody else pretty much quaritaine since march 2020? Hope get vaccine bad lol think might legit, too.

I'm getting second Pfizer shot two weeks. feeling particularly nervous, get jabbed, knows (I 99.99% sure I'll fine. covid already, too, last March)... effects them? Yes. actions effect others?

Maybe younger woman greater. think lot places virus still far greater risk. arguing data?

The population UK 67.9 million Norway 5.4 million UK 12.5x many people Norway.

All following figures latest available rolling 7-day averages.

* Daily new cases, April 13th UK 1681, Norway 694. UK 2.4x.
* Daily new tests, April 11th UK 892,540; Norway 20,642. UK 42x.

I know get ideas numbers new cases, very, wrong. Norway 7x number said; UK 1/2 number said.

Obviously impossible know many infections recorded (e.g. asymptomatic). tests country does, fewer cases slip testing. UK 42x many tests Norway, 12.5x many people. Per million people, 13,000 day Norway less 4,000 day. quite 4x many 3¬Ω times many. means lower case numbers UK caused lack testing. 

Figures deaths relevant discussion, determined many people getting infected 4 weeks ago more. UK bad January February, still lot people dying compared Norway. we're talking vaccine risk - thought - matters risk infection now, number deaths historically. Vaccines 100% effective John block also vaccine odds getting virus go astronomically compared getting vaccine. Thanks displaying numbers many people died common cold? actual fuck wrong lost semblance compassion?  Outdoors definitely (but realistically unless it‚Äôs densely populated area always safe). Indoors risk transmission high, continue always mask everyone wants vaccine chance get it. Like everything else pandemic people missing it‚Äôs protecting *other* people... Seems like dick move refuse wear mask indoors I‚Äôm protected severe illness, even though there‚Äôs still chance could spread unvaccinated people... vaccine tested millions foreigners, ready Japanese people. don‚Äôt know mutations. Caution warranted. 

Also kids. They‚Äôre lower risk zero risk. also don‚Äôt know long term risks. virus targets heart, brain, lungs knows lasting damage cause heart attacks forties fifties.

It‚Äôs plain stupid socially irresponsible get vaccinated. don‚Äôt think law I‚Äôm private orgs mandating requirement infect customers/employees. bring get hit head HAES arguments. many overweight obese people refuse accept health affected excess weight. ones try lose weight sea misinformation get finding actual helpful healthy advice. shocked many people idea healthy eating looks like. Professor (in northeastern hard-hit state clarify). I've teaching person since September. CDC website, 0-17 there's almost 2.9 million documented cases covid. include 18-20 age bracket, definitely adds hundred thousand cases. Lets say conservatively 3.2 million confirmed cases age range. 24 deaths recorded, there's reporting underlying medical conditions. Rate death 1:133k, 1,700 cases put 
 1:1800. Realistically, much much lower we've way under-reported cases whole 2-3x america. Additionally, study reported major symptoms we're found people aged 18-20 (this actual study, NYT article). 

An article headline causes alarm fear-mongering people casually read headlines understand kid MUCH likely worse outcomes (death serious injury) unintentional accidents covid.

I've waiting autoimmune effect happen though.

Mostly basics vaccine carries RNA get absorbed cell, cells ribosomes read RNA, make coronavirus' spike protein. cause autoimmune response, white blood cells generate antibody spike protein without coronavirus actually present.

This course causes least three major concerns. 1. white blood cells still working antibody, cells cranking spike proteins binding membrane find. fear cause unwanted autoimmune effects, similar urushiol works. 2. Horizontal gene transfer bacterial microbiome, point fear useless we've entered nightmare senario. happens could wind new disease. could benign. could get super TB manfactures spike proteins bind membranes lungs, white blood cells attack lung tissue. 3. I'm keeping myself. Since trying get zero risk society? I'm thrilled vaccinated low risk day day life. need risk zero remove mask go back 2019 life, sorry. millions people gotten AZ vaccine

\[Saruman\] **Tens millions.** \[/Saruman\] Sweden regions vaccinating 70+ moment, one two regions opened 65-70 year olds. 75+ least first dose. would guess Norway similar point vaccination program? really Bush-style $300 stimulus anyone gets it/can prove they‚Äôre medically unable get Switzerland here. Yeah mind getting pre-ordered AZ shipment either... depends jansen.. find funny downvoted this.

AZ went ""totally safe"" ""possibly dangerous old people"" ""recommended older people"" ""young females 99.9 survival rate covid might die vaccine"" countries completely stopping usage, that's like two months period. Meanwhile government still restrict usage all, even more, gives people official informational sheets literally state one (in world) died covid vaccine.

I want get vaccinated fucking nightmare would end, want jabbed something still fully understand  vaccine trains body recognize virus. virus mutates slightly different virus, immune system might recognize well. time enough mutations could render virus different enough body hardly recognizes may need new vaccine designed mimic new mutations provoke strong immune response.

So far, variants COVID proven different enough escape vaccines approved US, though appears reduction vaccines effectiveness mutations. Also, EU countries heavily focused AZ instead BioNTech/Pfizer. Probably countries receive doses help catch faster others. doses already delivered could used.

The problem J&amp;J suspended deliveries getting additional J&amp;J doses rely small stockpile *have* delivered. Maybe I‚Äôm misinformed thought heard health injections. Allergic ingredients? Could please provide source number? government bought doses, everything else logistics administering run NHS. success programme win NHS, government, hence Tories minimising importance. What's SNL reference? I've known Mudasir/Asif meme I'd check out. rural counties people want vaccine, chance? protection week first shot?

Exactly this. switch vaccines problem literally solved.  would horrendously selfish. places hundreds mostly older people dying every single day. 

I'm sure could agreement EU level send doses elsewhere get equal number front queue later want it. Japan everything power make sure go on. sunk much money Olympics would billions sunk nothing Exactly, none vaccines intended prevent infection entirely. doesn‚Äôt matter catch now, it‚Äôs going jeopardize health significant way. risk low 1-in-a-million, investigate continue use it, rather massive time waste cancelling appointments rebooking again. Delaying rollout weeks real human cost well.

I thought US pausing J&amp;J delay rollout much, people getting mrna. know people reschedule cancelled J&amp;J appointments, getting different vaccine either day days later planned. pause seems reasonable me--I'd want know known risks vaccine taking it, investigating think hope better inform people. also Europe still major exporter vaccins, unlike US.

This irrelevant, net imports/exports nothing country‚Äôs generosity, everything settling purchase negotiations took place last year. Pfizer supplying US US paid Pfizer so, wherever Pfizer plant happened located that‚Äôs producing supply irrelevant. Dept. information. think rules change bit depending citizenship, too. know duel citizens traveling back forth year. knowingly making people infected killed even though wanted avoid it? want add this, made completely clear Denmark, dont suspect gender role. reason primarily see women, mostly people work healthcare received vaccine. mostly women 60. stretch consider coronavirus news. article ""One volunteer, who¬†attended 80-minute lecture infectious disease control Games volunteers, said top Japanese expert infectious diseases told count vaccinated ahead event.""

As vaccinating athletes, Japan plan prioritizing (theres short section link topic article) Ah, ol' ""conservative"" mantra ""there perfect solution I'm going destroy chance fix remotely useful fuck everyone else"". would rather die stay home another year

Edit: Living sticks rooting ya! Bend curve! unchecked viral spread

The irony AZ J&amp;J vaccines even used first place *because* this. efficacy rates around 60% piss poor dealing newer variants common. People still getting infected vaccinated incident hospitalization death still down, incident transmission still issue. really ever used vaccines myriad reasons stuck mRNA vaccines work much better side effects random death... chance clotting birth control medications 1/1000. Millions millions women use birth control. fact pausing major vaccination effort stop pandemic vaccines incredibly rare side effect ludicrous. vaccines incredibly rare side effects, still use catching disease worse tiny fraction people issue. No, I'm absolute reverse that. get IUD bad side effects try something else obviously. I'm saying first thing would tell someone looking options try. literally zero restrictions place Japan. Anyone anything want, distancing, mask mandate, nothing. 

Test numbers absolutely way lower shown, I'm conspiracy theorist. report covid tests done private clinics, beginning symptoms four days prove near someone COVID. delaying vaccines shitty ass job they've started. two months, like began. 

Japan New Zealand Singapore, etc actually done good job. numbers artificially lowered, knows many deaths labeled heart attack stroke actually caused covid (but entertain thought since moves kookoo territory). 

The government corrupt, old, touch country deserves zero praise literally nothing Efficiency except administration phase get everyone show twice three weeks. That's small deal talking vaccinating work force.

Like obviously many ways pfizer/moderna mRNA vaccines superior, ways either improve another vaccine fill gaps. submission linking crooksandliars.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 100% though, course going breakthrough cases still widespread community transmission. cases still worth monitoring need caution vaccine escape variants many people infected globally. two? Russian vaccines? Informed consent definitely thing seem overlooking it. perform medical procedures prescribe people medications time potentially severe consequences time. people informed risk still choose go different ""knowingly intentionally killing people"". also appears substantial risk specific demographic, reason can't safely administered everyone else. sorry reaction glad survived.

Beyond that, u/Gregor1368 absolutely correct. doubt medical authorities would allow birth control pills saw rate intensity reactions. change that.

Take whataboutism somewhere else, someone interested reading unsourced lies. not. Surprise surprise. Someone asks source bullshit stopped replying. Could also people made appointments vaccinated gotten yet. Yeah could EU grossly incompetent. Imagine wait far behind line save literally buck. Cheap, stupid decision.  Last summer possible tourists ‚Äúsafe‚Äù counties like Canada travel EU, vaccinations it‚Äôs unlikely open up. would still quarantines summer? Spoiler alert, pills bad too. Anyone serious avoiding pregnancy combining birth control condoms. someone deliberately derailing efforts halt pandemic job. risk CVSTs (what connected AZ) generally considered 5 1 million year.

According Danish data, risk 1 40,000 getting vaccine. Norway 1 25,000.

So 5 10 times higher Denmark Norway compared normal average. 

Are one people crying lockdowns vaccine passports? Honestly, think things like *why* Denmark pro-vaccine population. also cases people 71 yo. Everybody scared poor communication management. see play end (hopefully end) know rules constantly changing, anyone know countries open international travel proof vaccination? comprehensive resources keep track this? 
 
Asking US citizen resident multiple locations Europe Asia targeted business travel. scenes country struggling cope begun emerge doctors speak new variant virus appears spreading faster ever before, affecting young people even children time around pushing India‚Äôs healthcare system brink collapse. States Maharashtra¬†have imposed weekend lockdown¬†in attempt curb infections, Delhi introduced night curfew, total lockdown still ruled out. ""But very, important everybody understand reduction numbers - hospitalisations deaths infections - achieved vaccination programme. People don't, think, appreciate lockdown overwhelmingly important delivering improvement pandemic figures we're seeing. so, yes course vaccination programme helped, bulk work reducing disease done lockdown. So, unlock, result inevitably see infection, sadly see hospitalisation deaths, people got understand that.""

You obviously native speaker, understand adamant making point, get he's saying? NP! didn‚Äôt elect racist orange dictator people arguing motorcycle helmets impair visibility comfort/reaction times, making dangerous. might drive better without helmet, chance serious injury death outweighs difference. 

Just like dying covid lot bigger threat blood clots interesting fact, smoking drinking also cause issues people still regular.

Not taking away covid thing, wish anyone gets it. would silent virus able spread across Japan (Asia) stay Asia? make lot sense either. virus able spread across large population one country would stay country. would virus applies certain race? Similar unbelievable.

Little measures? mean videos/pictures see show people masked almost 100% indoors outdoors. heard ""voluntary"" lockdown measures - probably better compliance rate enforced lockdowns somewhere else. Travel restrictions foreigners. sure mean little measures. seems Western countries done. virus act like deadly Black Plague, actually 99% survival rate. That‚Äôs nauseating.

It's nauseating argue strawmen. nauseating every comment make flaming logical fallacy. nauseating ignorant people like repeat conspiracy theories spread misinformation. Source? getting high failure rate? quick googling finds stuff like ‚ÄúIn general, failure rate perfect use (i.e., condom used correctly every act intercourse) approximately 3%, typical use (condoms used every act intercourse) failure rate 12%.‚Äù fixed. curious, internet searching well. also able find mention regarding AstraZeneca.

That said, means master combing scientific journals. vector vaccines also complicated time-consuming produce mRNA vaccines (especially large volumes). efficiency standpoint mRNA also superior. Yes also consider pill poor method birth control. someone using pill pairing condoms unless easy access abortion get pregnant.

Personally IUD also used condoms reached point life knew abortion access would easy. Pregnancy something fuck around with. well beginning pandemic, what‚Äôs going here? 16% hospitalized patients them, though small percentage corona cases involve hospitalization. I, like you, desk 2 feet bed hate it. WFH really unfair younger lower level employees. likely roommates, crappy living conditions, less space. course management doest see that, zoom call home office bigger bedroom/office combo. also conducted time less 47% vaccinated. 

To push back little that. data reporting delay long couple weeks individual cases.

The reporting delay could 3-4% adult population given time. Appreciate links. someone doesn‚Äôt background medical science, it‚Äôs incredible see technology vaccine creation 2021.

I found video thereputic watch. know lot vaccines/pharmaceutical production, watching professionals thing - extremely competently - gives certain sense joy. Yup, insane especially *are* alternatives *don't* also provide higher efficacy COVID well. AZ J&amp;J vaccines *never* used. Period. two values change risk profile dramatically safer group Denmark wait mRNA vaccine.

This.

It's worth noting also said hesitate start using AZ spread Covid19 somehow exploded again.

So far 60+ &amp; risk vaccinated, unlike nations seeing 3rd wave denmark. (Yet) ""Women comparing risk blood clots vaccines **that (from?)** birth control.""

They're comparing two risks. They're comparing risk birth control, they're comparing risk risk posed birth control. reason take Pfizer one Sputnik V. would that? saw interesting video showing efficacy difference overblown. Long story short, Pfizer Moderna testing mostly US time overall cases relatively low, J&amp;J later cases overall higher also testing foreign counties. mean seriously expect stay home day 1-2 years? Seriously? It‚Äôs funny people know take virus ‚Äúseriously‚Äù preach whole ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù message, ones flying Miami, Cancun, East Asia, last year ‚Äúflights cheap‚Äù... ones protests thousands street crowded would going bars time. Yet I‚Äôm one ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt care‚Äù question validity vaccine (where can‚Äôt hold company distributing liable STILL don‚Äôt know possible long term effects). mean forgive blindly following whatever government says celebrity tells right. something goes wrong health, I‚Äôm one suffers...not them.

The first 2 months, March + April maybe even May, took virus serious. seeing protests/riots summer. basically like ‚Äúhold on...so that‚Äôs fine..but can‚Äôt goto gym?‚Äù. say want saw LOT people without mask. mean..do feel elderly vulnerable...of course. I‚Äôm locking 1-2 years political group preaching ‚Äúdangers‚Äù virus aren‚Äôt even following protocols. brain put 2 2 together see isn‚Äôt adding up. virus deadly contagious, protests would encouraged, bodies would street, people know flew Miami, Cancun, etc..would‚Äôve infected. fly twice job reasons...never got infected. going gym...never got infected. gyms, worked park NYC never wore mask gloves (neither anyone else) we‚Äôre fine. I‚Äôm saying..if contagious people said, we‚Äôd dead. It‚Äôs using brain (I‚Äôm trying come condescending dick). saying..if deadly media makes us believe, people families parks would‚Äôve gotten dead.

But seriously I‚Äôm gonna lock house years. It‚Äôs healthy. There‚Äôs reason prisons punishment. horrible mental well physical health. Also, like said people know preached ‚Äúserious‚Äù virus is...were ones vacationing taking advantage cheap flights protesting. mean...Yeah athletes vaccinated. June US alone could vaccinate every Olympic Athlete excess vaccines one would even notice gone. giving vaccine ""causing"" harm. like letting harm happen. white men

I keep picturing wrinkling skin, ugh. mean, paint good picture head.  I'd rather die point live world want. love life. yes, producing much dont much facilities storage sending poorer countries. India biggest vaccine producing plant world wonder messaging data shows original vaccines still effective 9-12 months later including variants new cases deaths extremely low. ""Come get booster anyway, spent lot money make them""? stopped cases went way up. Looking excess deaths, clearly large amount covid related deaths official numbers. talking groups high risk dying. 50+ would continue. eu don‚Äôt say doses go unless ban exports completely Exciting! Thanks breaking me. helps put numbers perspective.  would surprised anything store them.

The health ministry quite clear *only* taking course action since covid somewhat control, start hitting third wave, keep option re-introducing vaccine. really isn't. taking vaccine knowing intentionally kills people, people see risks differently, inaccurately. IIRC logistics distribute apply rather letting go bad, gave countries. 

Remember giving vaccine people countries still help country imported cases stimulating world economy. best news heard concerning brazil 21 year old here. got second dose Covishield never better. hate train thought letting die sake many.

Why? every day. Lots things kill people still done benefits outweigh individual risk.  understand point. expecting authorities announce they‚Äôd investigate weeks, restrict use AstraZeneca vaccine people aged 65+ (and groups gotten first mRNA vaccine). 

That would yielded almost exactly results without negative stigma attached AstraZeneca vaccine would left countries‚Äô authorities pass judgement AZ vaccine. one man small town grocery store, least feel like small part talking various patrons come talk gotten shot casually. people say they've done it, I've done it, tell elderly boss gotten it, hope makes idea simple vaccination appointment every day topic rather taboo one. loud anti vaxxers would hopefully find hearing others taking casually trusting practice, population around would inclined gotten shot, hesitant would hear good stories often crazy ones.

Typing though, bit pipe dream. majority cases occurred people 60 years age (mostly women). I‚Äôm struggling find specific details people blood clots far. Buffalo, doubtful. Beyond hydrating day abs night after, drank pedialyte got home shot well. can‚Äôt say sure helped, didn‚Äôt side effects post-second shot besides slight arm soreness. Without Astrazeneca, Britain happy place today, cases falling deaths falling (there 23 deaths yesterday, UK population 67 million).  Late october? think we‚Äôre looking December vaccine immunity kick young people. I‚Äôm almost crying look good no, I'm guessing argument countries afford mRNA shots, cooler capacity store them, AZ better vaccine (atleast 30 yo). Logistically impossible western nations Last checked Midwest didn‚Äôt invent Buffalo wings... Chile vaccinated 37% population. 

More 93% vaccine used Sinovac.

Somehow covid case climbing like crazy, 7 day average covid case rise 1400 per day sinovac 7000 per day.

So happy put damn virus behind me!  Well given re-phasing supply (i.e. new order, doses delivered earlier) there's decent chance Belgian factory big productivity increase. factory also supplies UK.

The UK gov transparent future supply details best speculate based news like this. I‚Äôm really shocked got 20% Texans get vaccinated all. risk far higher young women headline number misleading. 

For younger women, risk 6 whatever portion 6 million young women, low-priority group.

Great news, especially terrible news J&amp;J suspended deliveries. J&amp;J order Q2 55 million I'm mistaken, even significant delay there, extra Pfizer doses could make nearly half that. Yep think that's really whole reason pause it. higher risk young women really reason getting vaccine one others. say benefits outweigh risk gets lot harder killing young people since covid nearly dangerous them. everyone seems missed it: vaccine 100% effective, immunity varies wildly individuals, normal discover things widespread rollouts millions discovered trials thousands. blood clots incredibly rare. chances someone reading article blood clot infinitesimally small... framing question UK ‚Äútake AZ nothing all‚Äù. outright wrong.

There effective vaccines (ie mRNA) higher efficacy rate, seem carry risks PR disasters AZ.

Since vaccinated vulnerable population, don‚Äôt see question cannot ‚Äútake AZ wish otherwise wait availability vaccines‚Äù. 

We purportedly best procurement strategy COVID vaccines world yet seem tied AZ still. turns problems low demand vaccines rural Americans instead rich Scandinavian leaders. Welp. I'm fondly remembering many people called plague rat hiking alone last April. fun times. guy another post saying UK going see surge SA variant lockdown lifted...is actual possibility basically 50% vaccinated? BioNTech, distribution rights Europe. Brazilian vaccination rates really low, that's probably going ICU stretched beyond breaking point, they're prioritizing people better chance live. think glass half full vs. half empty.

The vaccine available everyone finish line people (I camp) point, individual get vaccinated rest us go back normal.

But others need see certain level actual vaccinations (Fauci camp), availability matter much people actually taking it.

Because real leadership, think every country, state, city, county, etc. make minds want handle it. probably patchwork. imagining someone covid breathes face, 10% chance contract virus. case. 10% infection rate months, presumably many incidences exposure virus. could break individual events, protection would look much closer 99.5%.

Just definition click bait. Honestly sad. People already fence looking reason justify getting vaccinated. know categorizes family members. problem scientific process work, along displaying absolute commitment focus safety, yet people use example opposite. 

Of course logically, increased hesitancy makes sense risk posed J&amp;J vaccine appears order magnitude less getting COVID itself, especially one risk factors. know, people *terrible* estimating personal risk anything. get remember broader picture mostly good news. 10% increase Pfizer shots, plenty vaccine coverage still puts us maybe week two behind already ‚Äúahead schedule‚Äù schedule. wonder also means 25% boost UK's Pfizer supply? factories end day, Pfizer met production goals UK EU contested Stupid clickbait headline. actually read article , you‚Äôll see Fauci full praise Australian response, offering idea Aussie vaccine rollout, concluded ‚Äúyou always prepared best could be‚Äù 

And context speaking memorial lecture honoring late Australian AIDS researcher. it‚Äôs randomly speaking nowhere either lot likely get blood clot covid vaccine. worried covid blood clot? 

&amp;#x200B;

There nuances this:

1) rate J&amp;J blood clots young women seems much larger headline rate people.  seems primarily affect reproductive-age women, J&amp;J vaccines administered people specific demographic. young women, risk higher headline suggests. 

2) blood clots caused vaccine dangerous ones caused COVID. different type less treatable deadly. 

3) proper comparison risks COVID, rather comparison vaccines cause problem + weeks months extra wait get them. fact, J&amp;J still given people at-risk group (i.e. everyone besides young women), really cause waiting time mRNA vaccines young women anyway. Wow, saved Pfizer/BioNTech again! course offset full 55M J&amp;J doses perhaps (fully) use, great news!  blood disorders also affect males. /r/BrandNewSentence  even experts making decisions?

Just visit Reddit Facebook everyone seems know right thing is. obviously factored everything every unique situation country in. tend agree saying AstraZeneca vaccine plagued poor communication politics beginning. unfortunate reality trust perception important vaccine rollout facts handled differently. Interesting article shocked delighted high uptake I'm doctor, always good get opinion, describe think everyone gets. Everyone gets occasional twitches weirdness, including bobbing thing, people notice it. twitching literally constant, like undulating waves. got misdiagnosed MS worried ALS . stress lead health anxiety. heart problem might semi-related twitching, likely long term extreme stress find unable cope healthy way. cases time managed accept things, gone two long. body never returned normal state.

My advice would chill, see doc trust, heed advice look back. Counseling dealing stress anxiety probably needed doctor time. vaccine shot making post 24/7? would mean us already got far booster?? need get Pfizer Moderna summer get booster? Considering invited give lecture, yes. Also Virginia. mass vaccination site beach convention center Pfizer Moderna. believe one run health department, seem regularly alternate available every days. 

Another mass vaccination site former Macy‚Äôs run FEMA. seem Pfizer. 

It‚Äôs probably combination specific area, vaccine availability, agency charge, storage capabilities. 

I personally didn‚Äôt care - I‚Äôm happy gotten something! side effects second dose Moderna. Husband Pfizer reactions. (But that‚Äôs likely specific individual immune system reaction.) Honest question: buy 50M doses quarter easily, buy more?

because 50m top expected end year brought forward wat See people vaccines also spread virus. Granted unvaccinated vaccinated individuals spread unknowingly. thats assuming people showing signs sick matter 

It's people's right mandatory unless immunization.  vaccine good long per individual. Guessing around flu vaccine range soon see data wise.

Mask still mandatory due fact work protects weather got vaccine not.  reduces people's risk covid among sickness (flu n Common cold).  weather get not, mask mandatory.. however that's also establishment well.  suppose Yup! Like I‚Äôm pretty introverted guy, pandemic hasn‚Äôt bad, even introvert need burn social energy somehow, work always place that. Grabbing lunch, happy hours, chatting around office nice. made genuine friends (now former) co workers. non-work friends too. guess people hopefully going realize missing really comes back. OEGYI rubber stamping everything government wants Hungary great example. thing. chances transmission two vaccinated people lower catching clap encounter :).

Moral story. Get vaccinated always use protection. Would likely true J&amp;J well? guess that‚Äôs true. figured caution study would reasons. saying, anyone thinks would manipulate Italy's China's totally delusional. low risk 20 years olds haven‚Äôt vaccinated yet still staying much possible at-risk people household gotten shot?

My dad last at-risk person house needs vaccinated. got first dose week second dose presumably Mid-May. two weeks second dose presumably end May/beginning June. 

Will safe let guard point? Czech Republic supposedly trying buy supply.

I fucking hope least  Yes possible, enough cases, catch attention anyways. think vaccine country actively sabotage, side effect gained critical mass. Even slight crack, believe vaccine competition, opposition govt entities make known. Sputnik used 60 countries across South America, Middle East, India afaik

I actually interested second part purification process actually significant issue actual cause clots. There's higher risk blood clots birth control pills vaccines. 2 vaccines approved: EpiVacCorona (synthetic peptides) CoviVac (inactivated virus).  Great resource, thank you. realize state department tracking this. 
 
It's frustrating see doctor's note stating COVID last 90 days let bypass testing requirements re-enter US, vaccine gives 20x many antibodies good enough. moot point anyway though. countries checked let in. long take Pfizer produce 14 billion doses? Certainly longer 2-3 years right.

And long gonna take AZ?

Again, question misplaced. produce much, produce much time reliability. Nothing 3-month lockdown then. cool! One nitpick think would make sense account fact immunity vaccination literally 100% perfect, immunity natural infection. would make much difference final estimate since vaccines US effective

Also estimate pretty close one! Boris Johnson is, always full shit.

He beholden hedge fund manager masters one else. know trying make point entire populations countries don‚Äôt go sky diving. know getting 30% from. Per article "" findings show laboratory neutralising antibody titres generated vaccination ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine lower B.1.1.7 lineage, clinical vaccine efficacy symptomatic COVID-19 observed B.1.1.7 variant 70¬∑4%, lower bound 43¬∑6% 95% CI."" 
The article goes say 30% threshold set 30% stopped due overly cautious, similar thing happened phase 3 trials azn believe. 

I believe azn j&amp;j resume week two events rare treated. benefits far outweigh consequences now. Sputnik V? proven effective? Also took AZ first shot, could take lets say Sputnik V second one? evidence **suggest** **some** mutations P.1 variant **may** affect transmissibility antigenic profile, **may** affect ability antibodies generated previous natural infection **or vaccination** recognize neutralize virus.

Your quote says **MAY** work natural immunity **OR vaccination**. literally said comment immunity protect variants, **the vaccine does.**

Proof?

I asked proof vaccination protects natural immunity not, **which around bragging natural immunity silly

""Walking around bragging?"" Gimme break.

And here's study suggesting natural immunity work UK S.A. Laughable say least.
Ppl worldwide thinks know what's going Brazil celebrate news. aren't, statement bullshit. received second Pfizer shot yesterday boy, effects full today. worst flu symptoms years headache, chills fever. Never ceases amaze time that‚Äôs spent studies relating consistent exercise XYZ.

2021 moronic species still doesn‚Äôt grasp this. either safe enough administer public not, public health entities play ""take chances."" another comparison 10 times likely die car accident UK given year get blood clot AZ vaccine.

Nope, paper covers BioNtech ; however anyone that's read Moderna coverage, compare results, data confirmed observed stronger cellular response vs similar study Moderna released earlier. giving countries contractual agreement btw: Everyone least agrees topic: med today, would show high side effects, would never released. reason pill men never got released is, nearly side effects pill women. unbearable, seems.   hurry, want go back japan already die, didnt learn japanese BS! lmao airline like Southwest manifest seating open assigned. Ask Slovakia Brazil. think took Pfizer Moderna.  number people experiencing clotting may low clotting dangerous lead death. 

I wonder cause issue people. know? 70% symptomatic (aka severe, given criteria) disease. Sure. think vaccinated people benefiting vax, whereas people affected extend lockdowns, would make sense lockdowns primary vax secondary now. vax effect gets stronger every day lockdowns get weaker every day people stop cooperating. Eventually vax wins. Can't wait. AstraZeneca 85% effective 65 years old older. similar Pfizer Moderna 65 plus. reason younger get better mRNA seem AstraZeneca seems worse. ""unique"" purification technology two rounds chromatography two rounds TFF (filtration/buffer exchange). 

I'll honest, nothing note protocol. would surprised purification J&amp;J AZ extremely similar. extremely common two rounds chromatographic purification large scales: bulk/rough purification followed polishing purification. Similarly, almost processes involve least one buffer change and/or concentration step involves TFF multiple uncommon. Remember clade? one without D614G. Yeap still alive mutating. true, think said assessing risk stopped now? still much wider mask usage West despite lack mandate though? overwhelming majority Japanese public wanted Olympics cancelled, interpret sign people take seriously even government completely boneheaded. Granted, could definitely better government acted appropriately. Like Taiwan 10 COVID deaths. 
 
Regarding death misreporting, think one needs look excess total mortality compared past year. work deaths go completely unreported, would require whole level tin foil hattery. That‚Äôs rebuttal. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre confident assessment doesn‚Äôt change questions need answered. almost zealous hostility possible explanation zoonotic completely unreasonable.

No one proven reasonable standard zoonotic origin, far doubts problems zoonotic hypothesis simpler explanation: lab leak.

Downvoting, argumentative fallacies, removing article won‚Äôt change anything. one dismissing conspiracy ‚Äúproof‚Äù. It‚Äôs insulting. Definitely. already heard blood clotting syndrome affects relatively young people causing ""drop dead"" weeks COVID even mild illness. 

I know doctor worked nurse got COVID. Two weeks nurse recovered, took part testing new MRI machine hospital. test MRI revealed central venous sinus thrombosis - exact condition J&amp;J paused for. MRI may saved life.

There emerging evidence body's inflammatory response virus harms blood vessels brain. vaccine related clotting may similar inflammatory response. Sure, giving away vaccines going expire don‚Äôt know really taking super shitty situation making little less shitty. It‚Äôs still far acceptable level competency.  Florida 9 thousand cases yesterday. ain't hot. doesn‚Äôt. 

It shows reduced efficacy (as true far know) don‚Äôt see claim 70.4% qualifies ‚Äòlow‚Äô. long take Pfizer produce 14 billion doses? Certainly longer 2-3 years right.

You always going need multiple vaccines vaccinate entire world, even Pfizer can't alone, reasonable amount time.

Also AZ sold developing countries cost perpetuity, whilst Pfizer upping price demand places even reach poorest.

At $20 dose poorest 5 billion, rich countries would need stump nearly $200 billion + costs help store administer it. think money even close there.

AZ/Oxford/Serum Institute delivered vaccines vaccine company worldwide except Pfizer, puts firmly second place. bad imo. certainly isnt ideal, hand major vaccines highly effective preventing hospitalization death 1 million events relatively small price pay humanity whole. eventually theyll able identify risk factors clots people get mrna vaccines. According latest calculations 3.000.000 10.
And yes odds dying thing low acceptable. acceptable? Well 20 year old guy 1 2.000 odds dying year, 1 100.000 likely acceptable. Knowing know now. date would started telling everyone wear masks back start pandemic? (Let's say person national microphone, like Fauci, media outlet, president something) Probably higher natural immunity past infections. NYC first place US spike last March, barely testing available then, cases VASTLY undercounted. 100 Americans per day get new HIV diagnosis, 3% per capita Israeli COVID positives. HIV basically nonexistent America, ongoing issue manage indefinitely? point even quick look general (and visible) behavior explains perfectly : younger, maskless, restaurants bars chance virus stay alive kill humans. heroes virus. Without virus could already NYC half capacity year. Fair - 

That's thing crisis, exposes incompetency otherwise take years/decades expose. someone atrocious economic tax policy effects subtle take time accumulate. someone horrible policy dealing pandemic, obvious right away. Also, that‚Äôs type thing probably won‚Äôt ever self-report. 1 lakh = 100k? 


are indian measurements i've never heard of?  Last month rural county Colorado tried open vaccination sites literally everyone reason state happy, dial back eligibility, practice meant people could call placed list called couple days appointment still available. time happening appointments Denver incredibly hard get major hospital systems still focusing vaccinating people higher risk groups, point telling eligible people doses them. inform promise, shocked outcome. Iam studied biologist germany highly active informing risk pill five years. trust science btw would take AZ without second thought, even now. happening pill incredible alarming completly blows mind. UK 30 offered Pfizer

Because preliminary results seem indicate higher risk developing issue. might senses dispatch vaccine accordingly. countries adjust strategy new information come in.

Whether cutoff 30yo, 55yo, 65yo, males females always debatable, practical statistical decision.






someone else getting Astrazeneca instead them. Aw shit you‚Äôre completly right one, slipped there. point still stands though. Denmark Sweden part EU Danish source, director Danish Health Authority says article: That‚Äôs J&amp;J talking point disproven recent studies showing 90% efficacy mRNA vaccines variants widespread. don‚Äôt hear much anymore. Reddit markup broke link, proper link is: [Endothelial cells orchestrate COVID-19 want update, add backslashes front parentheses around number 20 url:

  [Endothelial cells orchestrate COVID-19 stupid...if J&amp;J vaccine end vaccinating October instead end August Yeah, *huge* surplus like five million doses. Dude, denmark tiny. Permanently 5 weeks ü§î It‚Äôs going mean Covid deaths risk lives elderly high risk, average healthy person.  30% efficacy. great result.

It weirdly low figure though, I'll wait real world data either confirm disprove this. Norway isn‚Äôt EU. states whose cases rising, percentage population would need see vaccinated cases drop again? number herd immunity? stop? Different people different immune systems tend different experiences. first dose completely fine second different. felt mildly shittier hours taking stayed like whole next day. Removed focuses impeachment. COVID. know anacdotal, dick stopped working covid, kept way weeks afterwards. terrified would never come back, finally did. Given 10% covid survivors experience ""long covid"" symptoms lasting least 6 months, I'm surprised ED prevelance high.


Granted that, covid survivors really worried blood clots ED. dick also work dead think we'll using J&amp;J fully. Johnson Johnson problem solved within days Apparently long ago made super-rough estimate number Americans immunity COVID-19, estimating 1/3rd population least 1 dose, 1/3rd population prior infection, even crossover two groups. attempt accurate, though still rough, picture US stands regard immunity:

1. 560K deaths COVID-19 US.

2. agreed upon IFR COVID-19 0.6%.

3. means 93.3 million cases COVID-19 US (three times number reported cases).

4. Let's assume 80% cases still carry sufficient immunity ward virus. 93.3M (.8) = 74.6M.

5. 328 million Americans. 22.7% Americans sufficient immunity infection.

6. According CDC, 36.1% Americans least 1 shot COVID-19 vaccine.

7. Assuming completely even distribution two groups (those prior infection vaccinated), means crossover groups equal (.361) (.226) = .082, 8.2% population.

8. means number people prior infection vaccinated equal 22.6% - 8.2% = 14.4% population.

9. adding percent population vaccinated (36.1%) percent population vaccinated, enough prior immunity ward infection (14.4%), gets 50.5% population immunity COVID-19.

10. almost exactly line super-rough estimate (55% population immune).

11. I've made pretty big assumptions post, notably 80% infected still sufficiently immune, distribution immune infection immune vaccination even. I've also assumed anyone infection immune, even best knowledge, sufficient immunity COVID-19 actually kick 2 weeks first dose vaccine. this, might best treat estimate 2 weeks today, accurate reflection levels immunity today.

12. I've made mistakes math assumptions, please let know.

My super-rough estimate found  Thanks kinds words ‚ù§üôè Moderna Family trigger stop wearing them?

Widespread vaccine availability low case rate. We'll say 20 cases per million purposes here.

The MRNA vaccine got reduces symptomatic COVID 95%. Gotta imagine reduction spread similar number. IE: 100%.

So since likely still relatively small chance spreading it, take relatively simple step reduce small chance even further?

Particularly since there's lot people chance get vaccinated?

If July August rolls around widespread vaccine availability, cases still ""very low,"" I'll probably reconsider case rate thing. Please don‚Äôt take wrong way, think properly convert result six divided seven million percentage. You‚Äôd eliminate two zeros. round up, you‚Äôd get .0001% have, though mine based 6.8 million, rounding lot! tested much every vaccine study linked still shows effective. Hi, hope feeling better! I'd suggest contacting doctor precaution. Yes, I'm US. I'm disputing fact boosters likely required point. I'm taking issue article's implication people already vaccinated (or soon vaccinated) need boosters coming Fall/Winter. feel like dope. I'm vaccinated started talking school teacher want meet hook up. He's vaccinated too. cases surged badly live even though we're vaccinated surge bothering me. time though know much longer hold intimate someone. seems like every time I'm ready another surge happens. Also part like getting vaccinated going squash fears I've gotten vain. one scientists worked radio months ago. said thanks CRISPR able synthesize OG virus's spike protein mRNA within week getting genome sequence, Jan 2020. course go months safety efficacy trials also scale ""1 machine lab"" ""supply chain go BRRRR"" last year.

In comparison, first mRNA vaccine took *ten years* go lab phase trials. Except situation like this: imagine several different contraceptive pills available, caused blood clots others didn't. expect medical regulator restrict prescriptions ones cause blood clots? Yes. fine. Get better reading subtext effective vaccines (ie mRNA) higher efficacy rate, seem carry risks PR disasters AZ.


Yes take much longer roll out. Squashing covid save lives &amp; fewer risks. Especially one low risk jabbed purportedly best procurement strategy COVID vaccines world yet seem tied AZ still.


Because that's what's available large quantities. Mrna subject EU's whims. framing question UK ‚Äútake AZ nothing all‚Äù. outright wrong.


Groups 1-9 represent 99% preventable deaths COVID-19 according NHS wales. Blood clots tragic 150k deaths rank 19 known blood clot deaths. everyone else jabbed speculative moment. youd shocked. netherlands, olympic athletes granted vaccine priority certain at-risk groups pushed back list. Preprints India suggest vaccine effective SA variant explain math going here? I'm dumb brain can't process calculations. go, don‚Äôt skimp dentist appointments, you‚Äôll fine, I‚Äôve times cleanings, mine extra careful all. phrasing question 100% fear mongering Everyone's acting huge surplus vaccines. That's simply true maybe richer countries majority world even started vaccinations many countries even enough vaccines entire population year. Got second dose moderna yesterday. Today birthday I‚Äôm bed tired headache slight fever. Still worth it!!! Moderna. sat little cubicle saw sign wall saying 'Todays vaccine Moderna' - made think board restaurant - Soup Day ... decision makes sense given situation Denmark in. per Danish-Norwegian study, estimate 1 40,000 statistically would get AZ complications, also applies 65+ year olds.

You look context Denmark vaccine. Daily infections low, large portion population risk group COVID19 already vaccinated

If Denmark continued vaccinating AZ, given portion AZ contrast vaccines, would statistically, estimated press conference, prevent 1 death. Continuing would statistically get 5 people AZ complications.

Also risk group AZ complications risk group COVID19, another ethical dilemma.

They underlined agree EMA, another context Denmark hesitate use vaccine. way people thinking ""too superior"" MRNA, BTNX üöÄüåï variant boosters antivaxers going cause rest us need really. Wiping table standard operating procedure clearing table. didn‚Äôt use top bleach spray bottles fresh rag. I‚Äôm sure places didn‚Äôt.

 Using strong disinfectants also bad long term. overuse antimicrobial soaps linked resistant bacteria‚Äôs germs time, instance. trying fear monger. Downvote me. ""walk"" damn hard?? probably little. Case rates actually go right getting shot, likely people let guard down. 

cases go around 12 days first shot, delays time someone infected time get symptoms positive tests, protection might start early 5 days first shot (5 days + week reporting delay = 12 days). looks like takes weeks REALLY ramp up, I'd still pretty careful you. body wants one million. agreed, like hate sub can't stay away. topics always juicy people always saucy here. since beginning beginning great resource. even guess sometimes uplifting threads enjoy too. Heretic fair point interesting see. claim mNRA vaccines effective yet proven real world side-by-side data suspect much closer trial data last year implied. also 50 60 yo understand countries taking actions 100% political/emotional since scientific community prove 100% problems AZ associated. I‚Äôm inclined agree. Last year one first group suggest taking virus seriously (and caught flack it), one first suggest masks event cancellations. I‚Äôve strict. feel like one who‚Äôs saying yes, end soon, vaccines really work. Almost opposite time last year. I‚Äôm trying look actual data, cases, read past headlines. normal Easter everyone vaccinated except toddler. awesome, safe. Or, safe anything ever be. Interesting it. detached point view makes sense countries bite bullet inject AZ JJ. Look UK example. well governments think enough risk stop it. tell something, unless complete moron. Manda saporra pro Brasil caralho young, wear mask maintain social isolation chances death COVID AZ J&amp;J vaccines. Surely many, extremely talented medical professionals coming similar conclusions, inclined refer expertise. Otherwise start path covid deniers.

I'd expect incidents type complex know, well likely concern long term adverse effects they'd absolutely talking (oh btw, know jabbed millions theres potential issues tick tick tick). Men don‚Äôt take contraception cause blood clots... so, it‚Äôs acceptable risk. /s activities simply last year, mask no. two weeks, plan stuff like:

* Go shoe shopping
* Get haircut
* Get pedicure eyebrows waxed
* Use cardio equipment gym long period time
* maskless indoors around extended family

Things I'll still cautious about:

* wear mask indoors strangers
* eat inside restaurant til CDC says safe
* go giant ass parties dozens strangers  studies papers regarding Sputnik V ? say studies plural, studies aside initial tiny one February SA many thought large enough conclusive?

I'd make decision getting vaccine even Covid - even J&amp;J since clotting issue miniscule chance. That's different know it.

Immuno compromised people offered jab first place.

I'm talking healthy anti-vax morons.  Lol everyone know VA got Pfizer, including myself. It‚Äôs number according SSI believe - what‚Äôs happening Denmark. smaller population likely throw numbers bit. However, said, Denmark significantly robust monitoring system problems vaccines, trust number procure much I‚Äôm government example. many? 

The figure I've heard clotting 6 per 6.8 million doses. Moderna testing trial someone struck lighting smaller sample size Take Italy example, around 400+ deaths/day. 29, AZ vaccinated, worries really think decisions political/commercial bias behind them. extremely over-reaction given every medical act comes associated risk (in particular case 1:100k 1:1M).

Overall feel better today, feels like took cold medicine last night I'm foggy today, makes sense. don‚Äôt vaccinate younger people open country up, what‚Äôs stop catching virus starting new wave exposed? virus isn‚Äôt going disappear anytime soon small study showing SA variant caused mild/moderate infection people AZ (sub-optimal doses timing) far aware anything published shows SA variant hospitalizes AZ recipient's frequently vaccines. nauseating. Please stop absolutist, morally superior bullshit. death person tragic. Unfortunately we‚Äôre situation thousands dying day, 3 million far. Difficult decisions *do* need made. It‚Äôs fucked situation, know it, virus dangerous, orders magnitude dangerous vaccine side effects, potential mutate outmaneuver vaccination efforts, we‚Äôre fucked again.

It would nice live world dangerous side effects vaccines, treatment deadly disease, don‚Äôt live world. Yeah think they're mostly going CDC tells right now. numbers plain false. Denmark estimated anywhere 1 25K 1 100K.  Last year media members public fell pattern pessimism COVID pandemic seen scientifically informed opinion. Largely happened response COVID denial.

However can't break pattern, even evidence backs fact vaccines really effective reducing illness and, data backing up, transmission.

The problem, see it, educated classes society associated pessimism pandemic, vaccines, etc. valid scientific viewpoint, really based evidence really valid outlook. really stems fact education true scientific analysis thinking poor country. anti-vaxers. Even otherwise educated classes society ""taking COVID seriously"" ""trusting science"" trouble really thinking adjusting opinions scientific manner evidence builds changes. 

Most people care seen ""scientifically minded individual"" actually hard work basing opinions data. one wants first person say ""Hey, maybe fully vaccinated people worry much"" optimism associated, wrongly, unscientific covid denial.

don‚Äôt take serious lol lol? Yes affected women I'm sure 7 think severe cases want little research Idiots happens unable reach heard immunity due vaccine skepticism? creates bit circular reasoning. 

If people exposed places, count getting inside. turn around use evidence relative risks getting inside vs. outside. 

And really, exposures same. distance, length time, even way wind air conditioning flowing adds subtracts risks. ones let logic reason get way.

Pssshh that's challenge them! even know meaning words. I‚Äôve listened Osterholm‚Äôs podcast since started last Spring, grateful providing valuable info helped keep away virus whole year. That‚Äôs it.

The humility part saying recent podcast explanation Michigan‚Äôs cases risen much, mentioned states haven‚Äôt surge yet. far recall statements podcast, basically said maintain humility trying claim know virus doing.

He predicted huge numbers deaths. predicted millions Americans would infected still tens thousands. begged people travel holidays said going terrible surge winter. predicted B.1.1.7 would take make ‚Äúwhole new ballgame,‚Äù young people showing hospitals ever before.

I heard say things, listening hours podcast workouts basement. right it.  problem lies fact risk mentioned lost lives.

I'll honest sounds like personal vendetta AZ. /r/awww I'm spreading misinformation though. saying true. vaccine grants 100% immunity. mRNA vaccines continue look better every week clearly gold standard real world evidence backing effective vaccines including variants don‚Äôt seem risk bloodclots. Good thing government banned sports, gyms, fitness classes. would almost say let people skip queue willing take astrazenca, risk, accounts tiny.

They unofficially Montenegro. People come take even way outside priority groups We‚Äòre pandemic, AZ shot would used regular situation other, safer alternatives available like biontech moderna.

- two weeks delay vaccination rollout them, may able prevent one case admissions intensive care unit, S√∏ren Brostr√∏m estimates.
Conversely, expect five people get severe blood clots use 200,000 AstraZeneca doses Statens Serum Institut currently hold.
- assess answered - justified continue using AstraZeneca, says.""

From That's great all, except people fly get covid keep themselves, instead spread others. Almost like contagion personal health. 
 
There reason governments bailing airlines, continue exchange common-sense safety measures make better everyone. 
 
Now, tell people get blood clots flying (spoiler, do) personal choice. flying spread blood clots. vaccine 100%. say nothing prove many reason believe opposite?

A vaccine prevent sick, mean can't catch pass along.  immunization. imagine bullet proof think cdc say keep wearing mask social distance. Perhaps risk lower, still cure end all.  hell vaccine last like flu vaccine month people may lose protection. Maybe last little longer, knows.  last longer year,  see individuals scream got vaccinated, getting Corvid-19. mean, hurt look guess... right predictions

This simply true, I'm sure people keep saying fact. fact he's wrong often consistently talks people annoyed him. admitting know something quite change tune him. logic dumb makes sense.

Well, likely got inside first place. exposure *indoors* huge risk really. facing massive vaccine shortage India well. State supplies dwindled, vaccine manufacturing stalled due lack resources number people infected rising exponentially. shit situation here. Plus, Prime Minister really give shit busy campaigning party worker State elections. leaders basically care. mask less idiots less problem people care getting vaccinated. looks like could come local subs. many posts like that. There's shortage beds, icu wards, remedvisers vaccines many places India. Terrible condition here.

Also, I‚Äôm Vancouver P1 variant spreading rapidly. Hospitalizations ICU admissions surging. Initially detected Whistler outbreak, spread throughout Greater Vancouver western Canada people visited Whistler spring break. young patients hospital, seems driven increased number cases rather increased lethality. Exponential growth + transmissible = bigger problem increased lethality. different kind tests, Austria publicity reasons (we going fix testing, lol) anything resembles test counted such, places PCR counts Ya assume Olympic village controlled like bubble. havnt read Games idk. makes huge difference, AZ scheduled deliver little compared Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna (from July). don‚Äôt lose much dropping it.

I still remain hopeful J&amp;J frequency severe side effects, dropping much greater impact. talk Chile's boom cases vs. lull deaths note worthy? death cases barely raised. *have* time. need bull-rush vaccine order put end pandemic. clots written acceptable losses - would far fewer clots would prevented covid cases, trade-off weighs heavily favor pressing forward. 1 day second dose far I'm slight... kidding. thought obligated post every vaccine comment. saw women childbearing age.

My wife keeps asking ""can come over"" ""is ok comes over"" last night like....we're vaccinated, literally anyone want come over. That's point! (we children keeps simple us) This. imagine countries requiring participants vaccinate going. USA, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, UK, among many others certainly will. Especially younger grades. daughter 1st definitely go back, matter involved tough her, teacher great trying help everyone best could.

However son 4th grade better ever. kept remote rest year works him, also convenient since December get biopsy begnign tumor removal knee, normal year may missed ton due appointments, physical therapy surgery recovery itself. remote missed day hours there. chance continuing 400+ deaths per day like Italy example? everybody rejecting AZ waiting MRNAs couple months. see play along. bet many people people day resulting delay vaccination. calculated based numbers weeks ago, something like 1/200,000 die blood clots. huge problem prioritizing elderly reason. short-sighted pathos-driven policy. idea retired couple pushing 80 higher priority 20-something waiting tables absolute joke goal stop spread. 81 upvotes tell everything need know ""why.""

People care. There's enough reasons exercise eat healthy. Risk COVID another long list gotten people become healthy. reminds whenever people talked vaccine news last summer, they‚Äôd like ‚Äúit‚Äôs 12-18 months away best.‚Äù like, numbers 6 months ago now. Holyshit Quebec we‚Äôre ""lockdown"" schools still open makes sense guess worldwide problem I'm back this.

Then make carry passport saying got said vaccine want go store restaurant, shame endlessly anti-vaxxer don't.  everyone wearing masks maintaining social distance? real world, uneducated guess would numbers change. sincerely hope not, Oxford vaccine got ray Sunshine! Economic damage isolation also cause deaths though, less 1 million odds problems acceptable risk point.  yep. fill SEC football stadium, possibly large baseball stadium, young women, give J&amp;J, would expect 1 get blood clots (on average). Reports local place one day AZ one side room, Pfizer other, pot luck side went. I'm sure would happened insisted getting one type, without good reason (other personal preference) I'm biased work VA, significant amount vets vaccinated that‚Äôs neighbourly. started guys lepers, could easily blocked cross-border healthcare workers crossing work watched hospital systems border cities crumble even worse lost 25% workforce overnight.

Yeah, mean guys sending Americans back US border. Everybody laughing US started we‚Äôre top game year later people sudden acting like it‚Äôs US‚Äôs duty help everyone out. 

Fuck outta lol. can‚Äôt cherry pick like US not. either don‚Äôt. US already sending insane amount leftover supplies neighbors.

Hopefully this, Canada smarten decide build vaccine plants house avoid mess like future. Ya requires precondition get covid19 first place whereas vaccines given want it

So need also account probability getting covid19 well  must one mRNA ones, talk Oxford one. Let Google find out. EU seems generally anti-covid vax US. Also France often cited anti-vax country disagree , won‚Äôt die vaccine knew side effects hand Japan 100 million shots 100 days challenge? mRNA efficiency makes mRNA look great. mRNA vaccine probably approved somewhere next month. Phase 3 trials already well underway, done recruiting administering now. enough data end month/beginning next month. already rolling review EMA. Switzerland, EU UK (only 2nd generation) ordered vaccines. vaccine stored fridge temperatures. understand 'efficacy' vaccine - 100 people give vaccine, 80 disease, 20 did; efficacy 80%.



No 80% reduction probability compared vaccinated. 

So 100 people vaccinated 25 become infected. behavior exposure 5 /100 would infected. I'm right (and please educate I'm wrong), factors decide whether vaccine work one individual other? 80 people vaccine intended job, saved even repeated exposure disease?


There two extremes here. vaccine works 100% time 80% people 0% time remaining 20% vaccines works 80% time 100% people.

Reality probably somewhere between. say matter still slim chance vaccinated. said people compromised immune systems probably susceptible post vaccination. really know exactly middle ground. part missing 20 _do_ get covid get mild cases, hospitalized, die.

So, 80% effective preventing infection, 100% effective preventing serious illness, hospitalization death. Go car, safe There's one issue. issues?

The problem expecting 100% safety. still safe, safer things like oral contraceptives. need figure reason think stopped. Yes, tracked antibodies part phase 3 trials I'm pretty sure. Fauci pulled antibody/time charts briefings. Salty Strassgaten chatting shit Oxford AZ vaccine usual. 37 proudly made AZ, waiting second one. Can‚Äôt wait!  country already vaxxes 30yo poulation? I'm jealous yes, probably zero anyone perimenopausal woman. 

I agree obvious answer give younger women mNRA vaccine instead resume vaccine everyone else. really poorly written.

To get straight, saying likely survive covid get blood clot AZ? really think massive impact Denmark‚Äôs vaccine rollout? Ok good, making feel better. 22 minutes day optimal amount exercise best health mortality outcomes. follow links, amount intentional exercise needed negate effects sitting ass day.

There 40% reduction early mortality associated 7 hours moderate intense activity week. goes well beyond intent studies backing intense physical exercise primes immune system everything else, guarantee. fit still develop COVID-19. One friend's wife avid runner. Months recovering COVID-19 finally able get short walk around neighborhood, pushing wheelchair could sit to.

The best defense catch first place. Yeah I'll take miniscule risk health order immediate measureable damage liver, brain body general.

You might think I'm joking, really not. wanna get fucked drunk bunch strangers, want crowd again, want feel would feel comfortable I'm ok small chance getting mild case COVID-19. extremely risk averse might make different decision. combination factors. think likely related unvaccinated people confusing ""it's ending"" ""it's over"" starting behave accordingly.

Airlines really picked pace well, lots lots travelers unvaccinated.

I think mixed messaging around vaccinations helping, either. spoke many people March, ""vaccines protect transmission"" lie proliferating, asking point vaccines even were. think certain subset people going see headlines, start wonder pandemic ever going end, say fuck begin returning normal anyway. honestly, even find mindset completely irrational. starting look like pandemic actually going end, maybe make sense adjust risk tolerances attempt resume normal life.

All way related pandemic fatigue.

Let people decide, doctor, whether take risk. Don‚Äôt stop everyone trying get back normal quickly possible. vaccine still going save far lives takes timeframe would wait vaccines production ramp up. 

If consider life equal, still right call. still suck, one want deaths, like purposely killing people sake global immunity. giving vaccine lower chance die virus. individual CDC pages reactions adverse &amp; many people side effects doses. side effect pain injection site. vaccines still effective. nothing worry about! one lucky ones :) part, Eatman still glad got vaccinated. recovered 10 days. friends nearly lucky ‚Äî friends gotten vaccinated.

So vaccine worked.  missing paper says anything moderna? hasn‚Äôt known long time. inferred might connection early last summer nothings really firmer studies come through. yes, scientific cautious, scientist know day age would willfully ignorant potential power contagious virus knew nothing about? risk cautious extremely low high reward, also ‚Äúbanning outside‚Äù literally never thing time got US That's important keep mind. definitively concluded J&amp;J leads slightly higher risk blood clots, circumstantial evidence raised flag.

The current guidance something like -15C something. may early tell, may not. remember last year 3 month mark pandemic people COVID reporting long term symptoms. far, we're 3 months vaccines heard long term symptoms.

This one ""time tell"" deals, think.  really saying indoor dining unacceptable vaccinated? Really?? J&amp;j/adenovirus question: seems like it‚Äôs adenovirus component causing rare blood clot issue. question is, vaccine goes tells body do, adenovirus disappear? us got j&amp;j shot always worry CVST now?  conspiracy theories about? deemed conspiracy last year governments would bring covid passports yet we're seeing looking make real thing. conspiracy theory crazy doesnt mean false. got first Pfizer vaccine easy, it‚Äôs impressive efficiency organization I‚Äôve seen several vaccination locations.

Exactly. I'll rather sit home 12 months waiting vaccine without blood clot dangers, expose possible early death 30.  young healthy enough pretty much chance dying covid.

I get point whole comment need say something this.

The likelihood getting covid dying small. live immunocompromised spouse, give covid could die.

I could see symptoms know it. work delivery truck driver. I'm restaurants hospitals. could give people everything safe, pass someone else.

If get vaccine end blood clot, cannot pass blood clot onto someone else die it. individual issue. survive it, likelihood getting covid spreading partner vulnerable people drops dramatically. Eh university told B117 variant I'm assuming tested sample further. type RT-PCR test developed predicted wave every time one, correct. thing is, however, predicting another wave constantly, many false alarms. hit 17, eventually win hand. Israel 57% might enough (though probably fully reopened despite claiming have, R~0.7 currently). flu vaccines use adenoviral vectors. live attenuated, inactivated, recombinant based platforms.

 I'm also reasonably sure there's FDA approved AD vector vaccines, I'm aware rVSV vector ebola (Ervebo), AD vector based ones. That's present patients, develop CSVT following inoculation also develop thrombocytopenia. person responded exclusively mentioned 'brain blood clot', CSVT.

I'm sure relevant anyway, really matters overall risk life-threatening long-lasting problems. matter whether either occurs 'common' blood clot, CSVT mixed thrombocytopenia, problem. Anywhere tracking outcome? can't find many updates Good thing many jurisdictions banned No, issues reported (afaik) Pfizer Moderna vaccines. American. don‚Äôt read Reddit articles. case, set production US? wife got 1st 2, Moderna vaccine. 
Should worried? risk medication like hasn‚Äôt thoroughly tested don‚Äôt know. Maybe blood clots worst gets, maybe blood clots sign larger issue, way know without time spent it.  rate blood clots might pretty low, still much higher odds getting lottery jackpot. 
I know bit irrationnal clots scary wanna end statistic. saw dead pigeon eaten another pigeon. sure turned doesn‚Äôt matter, spawns pointless discussions creates scary buzzwords prevent people getting vaccinated first place. let actual experts study back end. want show beautiful mug world.  help w South African variant ?

Talk powerful vaccine that‚Äôs capable 120 EPS (exposures per second). #PfizerMasterRace would like get Oxford University / AstraZeneca vaccine United States. bullshit. Masks vaccinated people pure security theater anti science. able spread concern. half adult population UK received first dose vaccine somewhat-overlapping 25%+ country infected. suppressed B-117 transmission average 50k confirmed cases per day fewer 3k.

If variant spreading easily, strongly suggest immunity effective it. Good parents feeding 80+ pigeons backyard think horrible idea. think pigeons pets... convince get rid them? abundance caution thing. take feel like need it. actually critical, would tell tough home remedies.

Also I'm pretty sure ibuprofen. Ibuprofen really anti inflammation drug pain reliever. Reducing inflammation typically reduces pain. sure going go ahead ignore vaccines also 90% effective preventing illness together. developing vaccines original SARS well RSV (a similar virus) dengue past, vaccines based traditional vaccine types (subunits, inactivated virus, etc).  Traditional vaccines, unfortunately, SARS RSV studies shown cause type immune response called TH2 response. lead severe auto-immune reaction someone exposed virus future. DNA/RNA vaccines limit proteins body produces anti-bodies (the ""spike"" protein SARS-COV-2) therefore suppose cause TH2 auto-immune over-reaction.

* Deltas based changes actual number people CDC source data may match differences rounded percentages.
* Texas (about 9% US population) excluded CDC source due lack age-related vaccination data, data may match national totals.
* Currently, vaccines approved use ages 0-15. CDC reports vaccinations 0-17 age group. 16-17 age group calculated using 2019 Census estimates US 11.4% aged 0 17 ages 16 17, assumes 0-17 age group doses given ages 16 17.

If died blood clot AZ vaccine still would probably feel right call. really wonder north Korea right think that's trying figure now. reason many stupid ideas get traction days social media. part call stupidity see it. Deliveries are, I'm talking liability EU whipped AZ thrombosis/efficacy issue. German media literally running 17% efficacy rate stories unsubstantiated. title implies patients fully vaccinated. weren't. post covers important topic unfortunately title bad.

Do people actually think this? would think anyone basic education understands concept efficacy. think quite presumptuous label **any** sentiment ""hurt helps"". pandemic studied years come. Books written it. Future policy makers, scientists, etc. studying school.

Surely anyone braincell understands still risk. risk getting car. risk eating romaine lettuce, etc. whole lot psychological risks living fear, social distancing, many things become sad reality.

And going North Korea disrespecting Kim jong un dangerous obesity. You‚Äôre point is? Yes. PCR test done come back negative. Questionable. mostly states getting doses arms, feds. 3: think ever explode, show evidence ""infected"" presenting spikes surface. mRNA last long inside cell. 

3/4: yes, sometimes ends production spikes.

I'm sure get better answers people, familiar, look free NYT explanation:  get J J shot people subreddit logically consistent?

The argument positive effects vaccinating AZ outweighs risk people dying upvoted parroted throughout thread.

Yet people voicing opinion likely ridiculed kind thinking relation anti-lockdown rhetoric; positive keeping economy going outweighs lives lost.

ETA: mention still denial AZ vaccine linked toblood clotting. guess OK ignore science convenient. Neither side terribly consistent. vast majority doses went old people arent affected clotting.

Once roll AZ vaccine young women numbers going shoot up. can't lie - love read post every afternoon. looked like world back January tremendously uplifting datapoint inspired by. Try weed. Game changer I'm 24 Astrazeneca doses. dead either! young healthy enough pretty much chance dying covid.

I speak UK figures youngest person dying covid NI 17 year old died something completely unrelated tested negative days died.

Uk counts covid death someone dies positive covid test past 28 days. matter die respiratory related blood clots that.

The way get actually accurate figures compare 2020 deaths 2019 deaths. 

When take fact account also take account Younger people nearly risk elderly people 0.195% number gets skewed way way down.

I don‚Äôt see reason think that. Much made mRNA vaccines adenovirus vector vaccines also pretty new. first one approved FDA 2019 (ebola) hasn‚Äôt seen widespread use

They different technology traditional inactivated virus vaccines like SinoVac problem blood clotting (which honestly marginal), there's many issues, namely:

-reportedly low efficacy certain variants (namely SA British ones), although still needs studied further;

-clear difficulties scaling production mass supply, AZ's incompetency nature vaccine itself. cannot coincidence AZ struggling meet commitments pretty much everywhere, whereas Moderna Biontech powering through. March 2022 makes sense, could vaccinate Pfizer 2022 Why? worried vaccine doesn‚Äôt work? Another one bites dust.

Citizen Science one way average person contribute society. needs accessible, easier use. mind using pc number crunch protein folding. opinion, needs baked infrastructure. They're opinions actually enforced since pulling vaccines.

Medicine science exactly science do, changing actions new data becomes available. (citation needed) Short answer mRNA vaccines straight better across board. significantly higher efficacy risks associated. There's absolutely reason waste funds vaccines AZ J&amp;J provided replace 1:1 (or close) Pfizer Moderna countries handle storage distribution. Yep, birth control relies able consistently take daily pill tight intervals much room slip off. Condoms aren‚Äôt 100% birth control sure isn‚Äôt close either.

FDA CDC recommended ""pause"" administering vaccines said probably days investigate. point investigating understand risk people meaningfully consent return administering vaccine.

Guidance best spot treat potential blood-clot symptoms could well thing that's needed make vaccine total godsend. people 65. ""it mostly hit women"" part probably AZ vaccine mostly given health pros Denmark, Norway Germany, disproportionately many women group.

The 1 40000 Danish news, Danish, Google Translate generally works fine translating mother language Danish child language English ;-) )

So, main source S√∏ren Brostr√∏m, would Danish Pendant Fauci, less. Same. country eligible Pfizer, AZ we're getting. Kremlin wouldn‚Äôt reveal three vaccines currently approved use Russia president taken.

My guess ... none them. Bet got Pfizer vaccine, secrecy. TBH since almost cases blood clots women ages 18-49, simply give group. can't afford *not* use somehow. went dentist Covid vaccines even approved, go dentist Pretty sure studies consistently confirmed vaccines use USA work current variants, including one. moron ways one.

&amp;#x200B;

And MMR thing despise anti-vaxxers.

Measles totally wiped UK called doctor turned wrong got struck spread bullshit autism enough people believed disease came back.

&amp;#x200B;

Anti-vaxxers dangerous. vaccines would still millions people dying smallpox diseases somehow anti-vaxxers would rather catch diseases simple jab. It‚Äôs wrong paint rural counties brush. Colorado, 9/10 top counties percentage people least one dose vaccine rural. San Miguel County (population 8,179) already vaccinated 73 percent eligible residents.

The reason county far southwestern Colorado vaccine surplus region state phenomenal getting shots arms. Thanks info. change 5% 1% would raise estimate 150,000. Makes sense know AZ counted.

It'll interesting see ramp, 700K estimated next week, fast people go frustrated started cheering Dutch eventually got right. know. Everybody knows. everybody it. clear path returning normal life best interests continue it. People can‚Äôt social isolate anymore. Vaccinating people en masse, whatever way possible, needs goal. 

I see lot threads focus death driving factor? Death covid rare overwhelming majority global population. It‚Äôs long-term effects survivors need keep mind, vaccines important things driving herd immunity right now. Agreed, I‚Äôm honestly happy vaccines available period. get 2nd dose Friday it‚Äôs almost emotional thinking everyone gone last year. Npr know better make statement without backing days. many died, less 10, 100, even 1000. 74 million ppl vacinated going deaths still. Whatever company Pfizer decided partner with? BioNTech developed vaccine partnered Pfizer, way around. Pfizer's manufacturing certainly incredible deserves credit, without BioNTech vaccine produce. White people less hesitant group Makes sense. Thx. remember people suggesting AZ well accidentally used half dosage trial. younger women, vaccinations given older individuals due prioritizations. I.e. rate affects likely get affected, probably higher. need pause evaluate. serious issue brushed know actual risks relevant populations. way 16% covid patients blood clots. reality chance avoiding dying COVID five thousand times greater chance getting blood clot. 

Not avoiding getting COVID, avoiding dying it. know. mean even ibuprofen increases risk stroke heart attack. Still got life changing heart attack taking much ibuprofen shit would still suck even risks extremely low. Nope, risk unvaccinated 40 woman catches covid-19 dying around 0.2% (1 500). 

The risk catching covid-19 makes difference (Denmark low numbers) along long wait get alternative, two values change risk profile dramatically safer group Denmark wait mRNA vaccine. say, sure, doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs correct he‚Äôs saying Countries: hmm maybe ban AZ.. big, certainly bunch. issues bloodclots helping. number studies shown vaccines protective asymptomatic cases well symptomatic. know one week. two weeks first shot 90% effective. Europe, dumbass. think US somehow blocking shipments Canada Europe? France. 70%+ anti vaxers there. varies country. UK 90% uptake. moral objection I'm dying turned vegetable clot brain. Thank sacrifice, people like means I‚Äôve got wait less mRNA shots. closed personal travel. Thousands people cross daily various allowed reasons. That's likely US going J&amp;J vaccine scrap completely. countries AZ far that's option obviously. Besides Covid also causes rare blood clots proposed making vaccine mandatory scared anyway. point care everyone gets vaccine lowers chance getting virus. young healthy (enough) fully vaccinated already, fear getting bad case covid never point. Also everyone get flu vaccine every year, sure point here. decision makes sense me. Denmark well pandemic. one two deaths day. options.

Given bad press AZ J&amp;J getting, entirely possible might successful vaccination program stick Pfizer Moderna. Less hesitancy = higher ultimate vaccination level done. Might take little longer, wind better.

Countries high infection high mortality option take things slow careful. Would cost many lives. thing even minor OTC drugs often rare severe side effects. 6 people 7 million clots. That's still remarkably good numbers think it. india manufacturing sending countries? also leaning multiple Q&amp;As experts Danish news.

Check instance those. That's they're saying. They're upset vaccines wasted, want let countries take advantage sudden surplus. I'd like learn more. guarantee assume 3 weeks 12 weeks makes difference 


Assumption guarantee calculated risk. *barely* know causes clotting, true rates now. know affects mostly younger people, know older people prioritized vaccinations. rate complications younger people could much much higher 1 million number that's thrown around. 

Birth control known risk, doctors discuss patients. new developing risk needs properly evaluated people make informed decisions. Oh, okay, thought bit say country run, nevermind then. don‚Äôt see stall reduce production

Since FDA stopping J&amp;J, J&amp;J holding EMA reviewing that... 

I surprised see J&amp;J used 60 (or 55 whatever) only. great, time get lots J&amp;J howmany 60+ still need first jab? Yeah, mean, unless course you‚Äôre close 1 million died. sucks. 
So, like, statistics involving people cool‚Äîbut still people. 

And argue deaths greater good ok best interest society‚Äîwhat else apply to? 

Because could argue, there, covid partially result climate change. Climate change result people. One biggest issues overpopulation humans. 

So, seems like earth producing something efficiently wipes population would beneficial planet whole?

I mean, humans 1 8.7 million living species found earth. That‚Äôs way less significant 1 million. 

That whole logic baffles me. Denmark can. Northeast full rural areas, talkin bout They‚Äôre manufactured Europe. Europe wants claim vaccines, so. tried this. nearly caused computer self-destruct. Unfortunately NHS medical records already sold companies Well buying many tickets, bound ""win."" [Kumbh Mela Cut Short, Say [this video Indian government account.  Novavax??  Definitely well.

Regardless, people shouldn‚Äôt give shit vaccine get job: prevent severe cases covid hospitalization, completely eradicate covid usual vaccines (DPT, MMR, seasonal influenza, chickenpox, etc) around (or than) rate adverse reactions.

Lead antivirals super effective, can't catch covid-19 dead. LOL Thank you, 1990s Diet Guru. mostly women childbearing age, there's sort connection found. decision body could produce mutation wipes millions. Nice individual decision made there, bud. Yeah honestly US vaccinated age groups spread covid highest infection rates (18-39) first. know would never happened think R-value would probably permanently 1 vaccines already given. Three cases, one death Sweden 8th April latest could find. restricts use AZ vaccine 65+ now. risk unvaccinated 40 woman catches covid-19 dying around 0.2% (1 500).

This like order magnitude. closer 1 7500 women 40. Granted, everyone develops ITP AZT JJ vax die, especially new vigilance, risk death clot still least order magnitude less COVID. vaccinate soon possible since covid raises risk clots enormously. I‚Äôm vaccinated. concern people can‚Äôt get vaccinated health reasons kids, whose risk lower don‚Äôt know long term effects yet. think people Europe flat-out refuse Sputnik unless it‚Äôs manufactured Europe. trust vaccine manufactured Russia. prefer wait see happens. still anti bodies blood rush.

From covid unvaccinated women died 0.2% that's 1 500.

It's even comparable. another episode Reddit fails figure world's obesity problems. Hm, guess three word reply wasn‚Äôt encapsulating enough, agree you. me, trolley problem is: leave folks open chance getting COVID pull lever chance giving blood clots. read somewhere recently there‚Äôs greater risk women developing blood clots taking pill people taking vaccine.

I struggled find comparable figures Denmark, odd reason. thought would vital easy find, right? UK excellent indicator anyway. ""I'm sure could, I'm gonna.""

Pick one though, roughly half country vaccinated counting? point, there's whole wave people die could otherwise vaccinated. I‚Äôve never really noticed tbh, lets cheap sunscreen I‚Äôm lazy shave third top fourth

This guy seems adept presenting valid point destroying credibility unnecessary hyperbole Im getting second shot Friday! little nervous lol Oh? Show something peer reviewed ‚Äòlong Covid‚Äô nebulous symptoms linked sars-cov2. Even Brazil fully vacinated risk still high. Half countries world hardly care covid Also, one person believing something whole-heartedly mean one person right. exceedingly rare effect health authorities greenlit using available information. able detect rare event literally tens millions doses given, short omniscient, think made best possible decision time. Like wtf. trash.  Honestly logically consistent. foundation anti vaxxer movement government hiding information regarding entering bodies. vaccine causing autism idea, instance, one thought.

In Israel, cases began plummet reached 54 percent first dose vaccinations. may reach lower percentage US UK however since choose exclude people already infected COVID initial vaccinations. UK also choosing give many first doses possible first, administer second doses after.

The UK administered first doses 48 percent population, US done 37 percent. unlikely either reached heard immunity yet, enough people get vaccinated will. vaccine outreach lowering vaccine skepticism important. reach numbers needed heard immunity, still see virus spread, also increases possibility additional variants.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* gotta even-odds another lockdown yeah would best solution.

currently country pressuring older people take vaccine despite EMA saying risk neither age sex specific argument die covid otherwise.

it comes younger people got offeredAZ earlier didn‚Äôt accept high risk dying covid.

what fear, offer AZ older people don‚Äôt want it, say vaccine deniers move younger folks without vaccinated older people anxious AZ. point soon unvaccinated people nobody 60 anymore wants vaccine stockpile get bigger again. surely lift rules.

from ethical stand point think giving 60+ highly problematic many people 60 feel like government wants clean image failing get us vaccines forcing older people take risky vaccine probably wouldn‚Äôt used choice. Countries choice like US Switzerland already excluded AZ vaccine program. /: Originally yes, Pfizer found stored temps Moderna. bunch friends luck randomly stopping pharmacies last appointment day asking shows leftover doses. It‚Äôs high probability work, timed errands run work way got lucky eventually. pharmacies don‚Äôt want throw dose don‚Äôt to. Alternatively, volunteer vaccine clinic couple days they‚Äôll give dose. Yeah hate it. fact attitude human life normalised accepted appalling honestly. Okay, would likely include time periods risk person spreading lower vaccinated person spreading today, correct?


When 5 6 new infections (not cases) per day US, much lower risk one person spreading disease currently exists vaccinated person spread it.

I know sounds surprising, true. relying whole ""We know slows/stops spread."" realizing 100.0% stopping symptomatic COVID, going 100.0% stopping spread either.

My point is, would put masks people benefit lower benefit calling insignificantly small.

And, get it, kind faked tricked saying this, I'm trying show people's risk assessments necessarily going bang perfect. 
That legend broke brain may effect, good they're careful time really side 11 days. sure kind contract involves zero payment... know one example, quite exports genuine donations, nothing SII contracts. Thank much!! That‚Äôs kind :) Canada really shit job far. We‚Äôll take left overs. Dude. Lambton region 104 active cases TOTAL right now. 10 minutes Port Huron, MI. Windsor-Essex region near Detroit also significantly better rest Ontario care-count. theory dumb makes sense. Oh come on, blood clots vaccinated people due virus. I've seen claim lot time makes sense. Sure, virus cause blood clots ‚Äî different type (no thrombocytopenia), also, would somehow imagine rare cases, something researchers investigating *would do* run COVID test?

Note even received vaccine, still possible test prior COVID infection looking antibodies part virus protein, since that's one that's vaccine. odd, United told fancy video ad theres 0% chance corona spread airplane. show study would surely great news poorer countries. Especially competition means case lower prices. chance get shot yet point? EMA talked. week infrastructure, put ton money transportation education, way literally changed airports two cost pretty penny. 100%. Absolute POS. lot people head Oxford AZ vaccine 'second rate' Pfizer one, really think headline efficacy rates symptomatic covid phase 3 trial whole picture. Particularly said phase 3 trials conducted different ways necessarily figures directly compared many people do.

I think we'll see studies like AZ par Pfizer 2 vaccines essentially head head UK right seeing Pfizer perform much better AZ. wait another, say, 4 months get vaccine want, what's risk contracting COVID meantime? assume contract COVID also going awful you. I'm medical expert, sounds like there's risk assessment needs happen uncommon best (won't rare since immunocompromised) side effects vulnerable COVID indefinite amount time longer. Osterholm predicts next 6 14 weeks ‚Äúmay‚Äù darkest days pandemic. 11 weeks later it‚Äôs clear fears doom didn‚Äôt come No, equivalent entire populations countries *have* died covid.

I'd much rather risk 0.0004% chance potentially getting blood clot, confirmed deaths vaccines yet, 0.0003% chance dying covid, 0.195% chance contracting possibly getting one myriad effects it, like reduced lung capacity loss taste smell. ‚Äúgrifting POS‚Äù? Really? Oh see. Lol. Well hope gets better time. damn, dad suffered minor stroke approx. 16 days taking AZ vaccine. determined exact cause help guilt have. asked take presented information that's rare occurrence benefits greatly outweigh risk. Oh, many similarities.

Viral disease, zoonotic origin (not proven COVID presumed), global pandemic, spread international travel, asymptomatic spread, dependence changing individual behavior reduce spread, deadly others, massive variation seriously individuals take it, massive global resources devoted treatment prevention, spread continues regardless lower rate individual choices.  Maybe use vaccine intended. supposed double dose vaccine. Hes fucking worst. Backtracking SOB.

OK, maybe Ding N95 underwear worse, Osterholm grifting POS. try hard area get parents vaccinated slots fill really quick. relatives countries still dont know vaccinated.

Refusing vaccine increasing cases. Unfortunate sad reality US. damn stupid?  think short delay discuss confirm experts prudent result significantly deaths any. However, use vaccines means clear loss life think ""covid patient"" number would amended ""civod patients ICU"" 

Sadly, never know, since OP provide sources. Mirena lightens periods cramps users. first week insertion rough longer get cramps real period - spot. situation pretty typical. someone also vaccinated, makes comfortable see mask off! signal returning normal, vaccines work, end fear. 

You idea go 100% masks vaccinated hasn't.  mean choice Astrazeneca isn‚Äôt vaccine. Women UK 30 offered Pfizer instead know still clotting issues much AstraZeneca. 

As woman 30 I‚Äôd pretty pissed government rushed forced take Astrazeneca, change minds months later miss chance slightly safer one. comparison placebo group. numbers would 80% fewer cases vaccine group control group. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

My friends want go grab deserts new bakery asked wanted go separate cars it‚Äôs kind far takes whole fun catching friends drive. 

I‚Äôm vaccinated, they‚Äôre they‚Äôre cautious people. Can‚Äôt really keep much distance enclosed car lol thoughts? ridiculous. vaccines end. end need learn live virus. cannot continue years years.  governments sue AstraZeneca. actually know case like this. sister law doses Moderna vaxx still got symptomatic covid two weeks later. Fatigue, body head aches. pretty mild though.  27 though likely would mild case anyway. however still transmit brother unvaccinated even mild case.

So it. fully vaccinated still became infected transmitted covid. 

The vaccine still job protected serious illness, think need careful bit longer everyone wants vaccine get one. cases breakthrough think rare cases, vaccinated people still able transmit. likely already covid vaccine. Delhi 17k (official) cases today... Imagine number counted. 100+ deaths. hear ambulance noise days. Situation grim actually supports idea toxic masculinity big reason difference US. Toxic masculinity least partially cultural can't separate them.

Asian cultures associate many things masculinity Americans do. Like big deal like San Rio type toys guy girl. Maybe separate constitution physical strength better US. medication vaccine exists ever exist unfortunately cause adverse, potentially lethal reaction least one person.

That's reality. Acetaminophen killed people, take market? heck? Don‚Äôt trust science? need vaccines! estimate chance 1 40.000 develop blood clots AZ vaccine Norway. reach herd immunity using m-rna, could potentially save lot people unneccessary harm.

Also whole argument, making sure people trust vaccines. Denmark pro-vaccine population atm, think authorities want stay way. *JUST WAIT TWO WEEKS* *Over-80s show similar antibody responses following single vaccination either Pfizer AstraZeneca vaccine ‚Äì cellular responses enhanced AstraZeneca Hmmm... sounds like thinking guy D.C. year ago, results same. always wondered vaccines made. fascinating! cool job. Thanks links! vaccine post flair? like every post vaccine nothing else see almost 200m doses given? think americans believe science all. BioNTech shots*
Not Pfizer fact still near 50-60 percent immunity seen Israel needed really slow spread. We‚Äôre about. 25 percent fully vaccinated probably 10-15 percent additionally infected. didn‚Äôt numbers would probably seeing surges countries people much more. great greater sense, incredible news personally. want J&amp;J vaccine, one option scheduling month out. schedule two-dose vaccine wanted. clots vaccine rare type harder treat deadly. unlike normal ones, blood thinners actually make worse. part J&amp;J pause give time communicate Woodcock federal health officials stressed one reason pause use vaccine ‚Äî United States‚Äô third authorized shot ‚Äî make sure medical professionals aware blood clots potentially associated vaccine treated conventional drug, heparin, could exacerbate clots. Depends kind numbers look at, vaccine states. Certain vaccines mandatory law (i.e. polio) de facto mandatory mandatory almost schools daycares. Vaccination rates non-mandatory vaccines 0-3 year olds region 90% (2016). 16 year olds drops slightly lower. (source, dutch there's lot doubts new corona vaccine rates vaccine doubters rise well. everyone get vaccinated. brought time time again. immunocompromised (and children, currently) rely everyone else get vaccinated safe. 

Once reach heard immunity, agree remove vaccine passport restrictions. then, cannot allow unvaccinated congregate en-masse. Period. Otherwise every single major gathering potential super-spreader event. US UK. worry places vaccinated nearly quickly, includes world outside UK, US, Israel. mistake, realized post sinovac using adenovirus. 

Any testing labs indicate efficacy p1? uk numbers suggest AZ effective UK variant.  see people vaccinated say continue wear mask ‚Äúto make others feel comfortable.‚Äù

Honestly, might lot hive mentality lumping ""ANTI-MASKERS"" ""*them*"" know mean... 

It's becoming obnoxious clouds high horses generalize someone might want breath fresh air outdoors someone worships **REDACTED**. fat people get larger dose vaccine skinny folks? about, no? 

Well that‚Äôs neighbourly. started guys lepers, could easily blocked cross-border healthcare workers crossing work watched hospital systems border cities crumble even worse lost 25% workforce overnight. haggle price next time might get paid less did.

Again, I‚Äôm Canadian, Europeans doesn‚Äôt apply here. Masks probably last restriction go. Relatively speaking lowest economic impact compared closures capacity limits. People think lockdowns work masking ridiculous love pointing TX FL run tail legs MI pointed counterpoint. Viruses complicated single data points mean nothing. distribution 4M day without J&amp;J.

So technically, administration could move 5M day every American vaccinated would supply constrained even without J&amp;J. run demand issues first. Supply issue,and end month it'll walk everywhere. 

I think issue ease administration J&amp;J vs mrna ones. That's it'll great J&amp;J coming weeks. able go everywhere. Think food trucks cruising around neighborhoods. liquor stores grocery stores. Gas stations. sort thing needs flexible product. number need get majority country opens removes mask mandates? Nope. compliance. Vaccines end game. world forgotten basic probability, statistics, math works? reaction completely overblown. first women sexual agency make choice.

Second lifelong abstinence realistic expected. called get added hospital waitlist, even real appointment, insisted insurance info literally ran phone make sure valid. Honestly shouldn‚Äôt given info desperate vaccine. 

I wonder many people wouldn‚Äôt even waitlist didn‚Äôt insurance info. wonder it‚Äôs even legal sort appointment availability privately insured. Meanwhile got shot somewhere else two months later text ask want schedule appointment. Nope. late. think numbers pretty high. getting them? 

I've heard 30% before, people admitted hospital COVID, meaning severely ill. Getting first dose saturday. can't wait over. great since figured young healthy guy going dead last. Yeah, probably right. people disagree radicalized. 1. able unilaterally would have. can't.

2. lol ok Covid theatre exactly 90% measures absolutely nothing. went flight weekend amount theatrics going vigorously wiping plane every ten minutes making sure put mask whenever drinking eating, fking ridiculous. Meanwhile half crew passengers (especially 10-14 year olds) wearing nose taking talk. let us take it‚Äôs going garbage show. It‚Äôs total joke whole thing   get epic Election Day music networks cover vaccination numbers.  Oslo Viken, sure, rest country. 94% relative control group original trial. every 100 people hospitalized control group, 6 vaccine group.

That‚Äôs across age groups though. Recent data suggests effects somewhat correlated age, young people might even effective.

Also depending study quoting might original covid, variant numbers different. even younger people getting clots. younger *women*. know young men can't get. Obviously would tricky things sort out, seems pretty worthwhile. Indonesia get Sinovac vaccines much lower price, also, logistic Sinovac vaccine easier cheaper. Drammen-ish her. H√•pet er ikke ute! Forh√•pentligvis s√• stresser de ikke med gjen√•pning, da det bare f√∏rer til √∏kt smitte atter en gang, og vi m√• stenge ned igjen. Yes, much deadly. Germany 53 cases far AZ vaccines 10 people died. least weeks ago estimated women 20 60 risk 1 60.000 get blood clot AZ vaccine. pretty high risk, especially considering deadly blood clots low risk dying COVID 20-40-year-olds.

I personally take birth control pill either, exactly blood clot risk (I family history blood clots). average Joe IQ 100. really thousand people really make world go round. like think January 6th personification death era refused go quietly. we've got shots arms, states essentially opening up, people safely traveling seeing thanks cohesive vaccine rollout. case count still high given this, approach clearly organized focused. blood clots happening small rate risk absolutely worth reward. shots small risks determined worth it. Birth control likely give blood clot give women daily basis. Well, live south vaccinated really need God help. fine, even among lemmings refuse. They're ones praying suppose. Thank extra info. Much appreciated. Oh god ok? letting deal consequences actions

The problem consequences extend everything right. vaccine 100% effective history anaphylaxis vaccine ingredients recommended take them. Also pool unvaccinated individuals large enough risk virus continuing mutate finds variant escapes immunity. cynically, giving vaccine skeptics hope wait restrictions lifted may discourage getting vaccinated.

I suspect we're well way reaching levels immunity remove restrictions. think ignore numbers blindly let unvaccinated population fend deserve it. pog strict? drives bananas good portion states US ‚Äústay home order‚Äù last year, none enforced. I‚Äôm thinking J&amp;J news might delay herd immunity 1 2 months, due damage public trust really legitimate safety concerns. 

Maybe August cards point? Running europeans probably point. AZ's excuse contracts called UK delivery Europe.

The EU wants make sure front line reliable manufacturer boosters. donate release contracts diplomacy needs dictate.

Also, accident preferred partner BioNTech German company. Bottom line want treat vaccines like airplanes going forward make sure plenty manufacturing R&amp;D capacity shit hits fan. Burying lead contract calls manufacturing done continent. That's overbuying vaccine fine, get Pfizer build factories EU long term needs run WTO issues. Yes am, took AstraZeneca one February booked second one May. Yes, covid struck 20 demographic hard unfortunately Small correction, people die clots caused vaccine. Two case series published NEJM, google vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia. However, risk indeed low benefits outweigh risk clotting. But, would still understand people hesitant preferring take mRNA vaccine choosing remain isolated. Big yikes. 

This exactly every public health official saying need maintain social distancing/masks significant saturation vaccine.

But folks didn‚Äôt want hear it. would take risk Astra end lockdown. got vaccinated January Moderna. However, though understand concern need conduct investigation matter, way media networks carrying nothing sensationalism borderline absurd. really 80%. 

That comes form tiny study relatively young health care workers. 

There much larger studies UK Israel (over million people Israel study) showed 74% 66% three weeks first dose (Pfizer). 7-day moving average right around 3.3M/day. We'll cross 200m Friday. EU done US done beginning, pharmaceutical companies would producing numbers inside EU much resources would need produced outside meet international commitments. companies bases within EU like Pfizer relied ingredients countries UK, ofcourse might re-route ingredients.  majority recent studies seem amply demonstrate reduction carbohydrates actually lead significant benefits total cholesterol reduction, increases HDL reduction blood triglycerides. Furthermore KDs reported increase size volume LDL-C particles considered reduce cardiovascular disease risk since smaller LDL particles higher atherogenicity. Disagree. die impacted getting shot.  really think there's chance vaccine passports used majority country domestically. might favor New York California even Biden favor national ones. see used fly domestically. Zero now. Merced County, last one, moved red tier today. provide us link? would interesting.  tried Toronto end well.

No, many European countries did. costs cents ive copying cards people laminating copies instead I‚Äôm really confused new trend setting hard dates 100% business capacity reopening making indication whatsoever plan lift mask mandates

Saying it‚Äôs safe enough pack people club safe enough stop forcing everyone wear masks in, like, grocery store sounds like total bullshit Rules dirty peasants, overlords. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair say that. real world trials younger generation like elderly referenced  major caveat variants, requiring lot antibodies fight off. Even seems SA variant able break degree based latest Israeli study. way criticize strategy, rather definitely calculated risk guarantee. don‚Äôt see would affect whether improves immunno response you‚Äôve infected. masks try reduce risk happening.

The vaccine effective preventing serious illness death infected regardless. seen EU dragged AZ mud.

That's entirely AZ's fault. first pregnancy childbirth kill lot women.

Second disagree assessment. get pregnant privilege living somewhere safe, legal, accessible abortion would 100% go means necessary obtain one even meant would almost certainly die process. Right, meanwhile US week two behind UK vaccinations, curve looks nothing like UK's. cancer, probably kill you.

We could take action surgery 1% chance surgery kill instead 50% chance cancer will. unwilling knowingly kill people going sit watch die slowly painfully.

Absolutely. slightly flawed vaccine enormously better vaccine. vaccinate AZ reason deaths continent go surpass UK.

Both France, Italy others vaccinating AZ still large numbers people 55(?) 60 vaccinate. Denmark Norway, refusing AZ altogether, lower death rates UK consider step. 

In Italy, specifically, 95% deaths people 60 deaths behind us question comes remaining AZ. 

The reason pandemic died simply lack supply. large part AZ failing meet obligations. U.K. probably start moving smaller second shot dose interval. single worked well U.K. strain SA Brazil strains pick need second shot max antibodies. thing is, trying apply rational thought broad reaching understanding underlying mechanics vaccination group clearly get it.

Its far likely they'll go ""see? vaccines made phase 3 still major problems life-threatening side effects pulled. could case vaccines. better safe sorry.""

Even people exactly anti vaxxers simply nervous likely put news: ""This traditional vaccine even undetected problems, mRNA vaccines new knows side effects could waiting months even years line.""

There might assholes happy deaths compared somewhere else, assholes everywhere happy angry everything anything.

Condoms good alternative birth control still risky birth control. replace IUD expired live NY get pregnant super easy get abortion, financially well (with unlimited sick time) easily afford so. risk pregnancy using condoms catastrophic. poor woman living Georgia increased risk going tolerable regardless side effects BC.

Being able allow increased risk pregnancy immense priviledge women afford.

There's nothing prove there's many reasons believe opposite. gold would get It‚Äôs really interesting AZ performs least well mRNA vaccines compared equals study (vs comparing trial efficacy rates) one person said anything like false, exaggerated statements making.

You might realized Covid-19 far common cold. want permanent hybrid model. want chained desk run Excel Solidworks 8 hours, greatly miss team events occasional big meeting. theory yes. practice mutations may slightly reduce efficacy doubtful single mutation would drop efficacy 60-95% zero. 

More likely would slight reductions mutants get away original virus. may take years even decades protection fall zero. China admit effective? comparable risk death COVID19 40 women?

People keep comparing overall risk death COVID19. since problem seems affect demographic risk analysis look demographic. 250 million doses enough half EU population, leave second shot. higher chance blood clot birth control drug, like significantly higher.  Compared ADs? I'd doubtful. J&amp;J mentioned half 7,000,000 given last 2 weeks. Sounds like jury could still those. Also one clotting case clinical trials 25 year old male fever / headache day 9. Still awaiting official recommendation.

Johnson Johnson.. go around donating doses manufactured private entities countries 

there's one part slightly incorrect. Indian labs manufacturing vaccines license. means manufacturer free please end product. must meet supply requirements license holder. private entity bound contracts seeing contracts upheld. Neither Indian state manufacturing lab owns vaccines. india wants vaccines, must purchase whatever cost manufacturer vaccine developer decide. someone else willing pay more, they'll get vaccines first.

In simpler terms, ""vaccine diplomacy"" thing exactly say - optics.

A good analogy phones - Foxconn manufactures many Apple products them. must supply ipads iphones whomever apple wants contract with. Foxconn cannot, own, decide iphones ipads go. vaccine manufacturing situation almost exactly same. AstraZeneca vaccine dangerous taking long haul flight - four million people might develop clot. contraceptive pill likely kill you.

Need atleast 3 times much every month complete vaccinations year end. risk analysis ""get vaccine vs. get vaccine get COVID"" perfectly clear, real life risk analysis vaccinating entire population also includes infection rates, many vaccines available sources, big portion population already vaccinated, many things.

The Danish health authority estimated rejecting AZ vaccine would result 2 extra cases COVID severe complications nationwide due vaccination delays, administering planned 200,000 doses AZ vaccine would result 5 cases blood clotting high risk fatalities occurring.

5 2, math says administer vaccine.  choose one hundreds locations city offer one ones 90% efficacy stigma dangerous / less effective. Vaccine production 'stalled'. Production numbers steady. What's happening equipment need come US/EU stuck due export controls. affect new production capacity , existing production. Also, vaccine demand shot eligibility increased Ages 45+.

What implying drastic fall production. That's true all.

So better give AZ vaccine older, shortage, Pfizer youngest, lesser blood clot risk (possibly one statistical norm.)

Regarding question exactly spike protein expressed:
That depends mainly mRNA sequence. called ""signal peptide"" start protein coding sequence acts like address put newly synthesized protein. 

Then, second determinant whether protein contains ""membrane anchor"", region hydrophobic/lipophilic amino acids, want lipid membrane, free floating water. 

BioNTech/Pfizer released mRNA sequence, nicely analysed here: 1) use signal peptide virus, initial expression protein localisation real infection. is, endoplasmic reticulum, found secretory pathway way cell surface 2) spike protein naturally contains membrane anchor (""transmembrane domain"") C-terminus (the ""last"" part). means protein anchored lipid membrane (e.g. lipid membrane ER, one ends viral membrane). antibodies spike already there, bind protein mark cells destruction (""opsonization""). However, primary mechanism induces immunity goes step further:

Cells continuous turnover proteins, degradation pathways include proteinases (proteins cut proteins). produce smaller fragments (""peptides"") cell presents professional immune cells surface (via MHC1), kind like checksum/overview proteins recently cell. 

The peptides MHC1 detected cells found normal cell may lead cell killing infected cell. 

Optimally vaccine express protein random cell, ""professional antigen presenting cells"", e.g. dendritic cells (DCs). job essentially closely interact B cells, showing proteins they're making (MHC1) picked outside surface (MHC2). Former prime cells, latter B cells. 

And indeed, mRNA vaccines targeting DCs expression spike: 
Data BioNTech: 
Review: makes think sure side effect several months - years - mRNA vaccines used massively humans yet? 

Your FAQ says rightly end, vaccine causes widespread problem future (which, again, unlikely), would reasonable suspect hypothetical adverse event would occur natural infection well.

But broken RNA DNA coming process production? (I read somewhere Biontech vaccines 70-75% pure, 100 99.x%). assume small bits RNA destroyed body, DNA production process could made through? 

Thank :)  booked Disney trip early October; I'm fully vaccinated I'm obviously hoping mask mandate gone then, I'm also realistic getting hopes up. Maybe they'll something like masks outdoors, wear go inside? Even would nice. Isnt Q2 already? can't enforce nonvaccinated people wear them. ah see. immuno comprised people morons, risk. supposed know vaccines effective 2 years covid19 even existed 2 years. good tomorrow morning based others got moderna. keep drinking fluids take Tylenol fever spikes high. 

I good night second day got shot morning. roughly 36ish hours post shot fine. Love attitude subreddit

Vaccine considered dangerous despite one thirty-five thousand/two-hundred fifty thousand chance? 

Give nations. people take risk since poorer matter. scraps. fantastic one shot. huge game changer comes vaccinated teenagers high-school, homeless, walk appointments big box stores available that. pause old university vaccinated hundreds students J&amp;J

I agree technically superior Pfizer Moderna. fact appeals demographic people that's faster efficient particular needs. changed topic like 5 times one paragraph. r/Coronavirus btw Exact boat I'm in. feel great, like day 3 bad cold terms body grossness. arm hurt. took day ahead time slept in, I'm glad went route.

Whatever company Pfizer would chosen partner would vaccine used US. Pfizer obviously tried pick one best companies available BioNTech, choice change tested mass produced vaccine. 


BioNTech's production impressive future completely irrelevant US, currently discussing. Andres57 implied German funding reason Americans getting vaccinated, truth.

In addition, mRNA technology used developed funded US. really idea US somehow thankful Germany vaccines totally absurd. Texas currently much higher new covid case rate per capita California, fatality rate. Texas fortunate even worse problems given public attitude toward restrictions, suggesting perhaps they're reckless bravado indicates. RIVM website stated two weeks stopped counting AZ vaccines total limited visibility much actually administered GP‚Äôs. Yesterday confirmed despite stop, limiting people 60, doses assigned GP‚Äôs fully used - added numbers. 

Otherwise nothing add comments made others poor way Dutch government RIVM handled pandemic. It‚Äôs total disgrace - neither public media seems care much it. People ‚Äúenough‚Äù, government pressure reopen despite continually high number new cases full hospitals. 20s doses Pfizer, feels good American. yeah complain management room properly ventilated i'm told shut safe clean surfaces every hour. getting broad ballpark range never claimed fact (read word ""likely"")? mix sources commonly accepted estimation techniques. get similar range many ways. it:

Approximately 6.8 million Americans vaccinated J&amp;J. I'm excluding countries data surrounding 6 cases USA. 

Roughly half recipients assumed women. means approximately 3.4 given women ages. likely [higher women tend live longer older people vaccinated first, since interested ""young"" women adjust estimate fact. age groups care men women almost exactly 50% population. vaccine gap may continue younger ages feel comfortable assuming that. assume does, adjust estimate roughly 20%.

Next, define ""young women"" which, case, seems pre-menopausal women. 6 data points I'm projecting range 16 (minimum age vaccinated) 50 (close average age menopause). adjust range adjust estimate. 

In many states, women age group opened vaccinations many women qualified immediately either pre-conditions, working health care, working education. need guess ages. [We use real lower three buckets website cover ages 18 49. That's close enough age range made adjustment. used 45 top age range adjust slightly. gives us approximately 20.8M fully vaccinated young people 68.2M fully vaccinated people overall, **30.5% fully vaccinated people range.** (Since J&amp;J one shot vaccination ignore partially vaccinated people mix data Pfizer Moderna). 

We take approximately 3.4M doses applied women multiply 30.5% find estimate **1 million young women vaccinated**. 

If want conservative, however, use 44 45 top range. also worth conservative. real number may well 1M certainly 500k. overly cautious approach led say 500k 1M, would probably accurate give range 800k 1.2M.      People vulnerable would already dead things. building resistance people would died earlier. survivors would tend fewer issues peanut allergies. may issues multiple concurrent infections. Like fighting SARS 2 also suffering chronic issues like malnutrition.

The age demographics would younger less deaths per capita general. live edge rural - suburban TX big multi-county vaccine hub closing down. started vaccinating January beginning April got everybody waiting list. adult still wants vaccine go smaller facility now. vaccine rate pretty low here. Rural county authorities never took pandemic seriously promoted personal freedom public safety. official message always ""If concerned family's health means feel free take whatever precautions feel necessary. concern you, continue live lives normal. Businesses free choose what, measures wish take enforce property"". Also there's lot misinformation spread local social media accounts that's accepted ""everybody entitled opinions"". we've always terms protecting ourselves. way someone else could numbers New York? Oh boy memorial day weekend Vegas gonna awesome! Booked hotel room months ago anticipation. vote yet? I'm still alive kicking 8 weeks on! 34, male UK.

Everything besides Huntsville rural fuck  One time went ""free"" STD clinic university's campus six months later got bill $100. good insurance, I'd worried something like happening too.

EDIT: think actually, first symptoms 6 13 day range still.  Never said 200.000 would infected. Point disease kills far people, vaccine would worst case scenario. also rethink whether they'd want go pandemic over.

Meanwhile risk dying home skyrockets. concept? Yes. Someone probably tell TV networks they‚Äôre carrying like getting J&amp;J shot death sentence. situation differ months. last year vaccins. 50% 6 people? 7 million doses given? Lol. That‚Äôs statistically insignificant af, especially compared birth control clotting.

Month | Equivalent Percentage Population Fully Vaccinated
---|---
One (Dec 14 - Jan 14) | 1.8%
Two (Jan 15 - Feb 14) | 6.5% (8.3% total)
Three (Feb 15 - Mar 14) | 7.8% (16.1% total)
Four (Mar 15 - Apr 14) | 14.4% (30.5% total)

This math count two doses two-dose vaccine one person equivalent, one dose J&amp;J one person equivalent.

It's encouraging, distribution numbers four months high. reminder reason seeing sharp flattening curve still 30.5% way complete vaccination program, less halfway 70% equivalency. Diplomacy! relevant thread? Yeah, typical response. Tired achy starting night later day lasting 24 hours.

Not speaking comment thread, funny see people talk second dose way concern give amount alcohol plan consume St Patrick's Day/Halloween/Christmas/New Years So, I'm side argument actually apt hurt helps. 

90 percent measure effectives exposure set period time. indicate 90 percent people become 100 percent immune. reach herd immunity persistent risk exposure (although diminishing time vaccination rates go up) exposure continue carry injection risk. Fortunately infections generally expected mild.

However, response actually increases risk transitional period can't get vaccinated yet due qualifying yet ever due underlying condition. don‚Äôt think shame ever work. think results people becoming entrenched beliefs. think best bet private companies make difficult people exist normal society without one. Eventually people cave convenience. Same. applied schools graduate program extend college another year got scammed third fourth years. Probably people actually generally positive experience working home, things considered. lack commute biggest one opinion - people get spend time family, better mental health etc. ancillary benefits saving lunch/clothing expenses, forced deal office etc.

From personal perspective general consensus friends, family, colleagues, seems hybrid model would ideal people love ability forced office 5+ days week. First 50 million took 77 days, second took 31 days, next done 3 weeks. Lower per capita, age demographics. Fewer people live long enough vulnerable demographic. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

Honestly, might already time disengage numbers. highly doubt hospitals even get overwhelmed given immunities high risk people vaccinated.

If numbers health scares and/or death low, would never remove shots (during pandemic, needs them) administered. 

Time wake people. 

If took shot, please monitor health moving forward. got fixed. Welp. Minnesota never looked red. skimmed article, believe immunity measured within 7 months infection. positive, told local health department immunity might last 3 months. either case, July 8 months ago definitely bad idea get vaccine. irrelevant sense says absolutely nothing real-world vaccine efficacy. relevant sense something worth studying. Unfortunately, Fertility Awareness Method lumped less reliable ""Rhythm Method"" studies. reliable look actual women use methods backed science. Think mRNA rollout keep way. worst probably past us. imply that. reminder vaccination process global effort exclusive USA ...even die...it right call.  
  
Uh saying? got vaccine too, shit ton people started dying it, would absolutely right call. Yea, morbidly interesting thing consider. Fits right song that's ironic things claims be. read donate blood american red cross tell covid antibodies. give interesting/useful info? I've never donated blood. First, 6 7.1 million, 1 40000. 

Second, think wrong people exactly anti vaxxers simply nervous likely put news: ""This traditional vaccine even undetected problems, mRNA vaccines new knows side effects could waiting months even years line.""

people like mentally broken. can't imagine amount therapy need get back semblance normal brazillians would gladly take vaccine available since president scumbag believes vaccines turn people alligators, thus impeding proccess obtaining vaccines. long first dose 80% come in? Like I'm planning go let people spit got mine yesterday I'm wondering I'll considered relatively safe next dose. It‚Äôs really weird nausea pain associated it. Everyone else know nausea also pain. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre feeling better! Ibuprofen also risk Stevens-Johnson syndrome, skin *literally* starts fall off.

However, also ~ 1 1,000,000 chance happening. unfortunately? Athletes vaccinated foreign spectators aren‚Äôt allowed. Humanity 1 - Smallpox 0

SARS-CoV-2 animal reservoirs though would much, much harder. Professional sports pretty much played pandemic long heard nothing handful athletes getting sick team time none long term issues sitting week two. Olympic level athletes feel safely compete precautions taken. Considering article citations facts head, may want reconsider. thinking thing. *want* die... got J&amp;J right thing do. 

The alternative get covid maybe die, maybe J&amp;J supposedly 5 related deaths US? covid what, 600,000 related deaths US?

And real talk, blood clots symptom virus people. boss got tested positive virus, months vaccines rolling out.  know, could virus incubation period, known, answered ""ayy, contact virus past 14 days"" signing vaccine, low behold virus active time.

It's smart put distribution hold. panic premature. Science can't account people lying. Taking (expirimental) vaccines consequences trading lives random young healthy individuals old ill. mention actively giving someone blood clots killing markedly different someone catching covid dying. Also imagine blowback. Antivaxxers become even influential. thinking holistically.  old people vaccinated Chile. There's magical way young people get infected more. even keep account variants prevalent mRNA vaccines tested NYC numbers keep down. Normalcy sight! would riots.

Then swept people didn‚Äôt know much afraid vaccines anyway. thread nationalism frustration AZ Europe.

The European governments tried blame lack vaccines AZ, therefore another effort say ineffective toxic. around 20% Indian deaths documented normal circumstances, let alone correct cause death. inappropriate compare two. DIC like clotting issue vaccine far dangerous tricky DVT birth control.

We also fully understand mechanism, rate, risk. can't get informed consent patients nobody actually ""informed"".

After spent year promising new tech would safe we'd cautious possible, worst thing say ""ok, maybe it'll kill chance realllllllly small, take anyway"". mean, hand vaccine. KNOW certain number citizens die it. fully aware it. less people dying vaccine COVID several mutations, speed even virus left alone... really understand kind hesitancy, seem like pretty level-headed person, I'll ask. What's thinking process behind this? vacuum, definitely understand wary long-term information vaccine. long-term information long-term effects COVID either. know appear great number concerning things happening, like long COVID, organ damage, neurological damage, etc. know never seen anywhere near rate serious complications post vaccine we're seeing people COVID. guess understand hesitancy comes in. know couple people feel way, asked get offended start talking putting ""chemicals"" bodies, check out. chance either AZ J &amp; J vaccine. 

I‚Äôm also curious chance people various cohorts getting clots brain COVID. 

I remember last year, reading article doctor among first realize COVID could cause strokes young, healthy people. 

He described watching brain scan, seeing small infarcts brain guy 30‚Äôs, happening real time. 0.00006% chance mortality. incidence miniscule.  Uhhh no? EU would include Denmark, Norway Sweden. Clearly Denmark permanently stopped Sweden 65 plus Imo, best way strip away bonus might have

Regardless vaccine not

Sorry, deny one thing (depends reason tbf) deny hold hand say ‚Äúgimmie bonuses pandemic‚Äù another specially women 40 appear risk devoping blood clots 1 30,000 40,000 cases 

And look risks involved used anti-conception pills :) Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* got positive covid test report VAERS? Stopping Johnson Johnson vaccine peak ignorance science fear mongering. 1 death 1 set serious side effects 7 million doses given far incredibly good ratio benefit vs harm. Didn‚Äôt know medical establishment fell antivax panic porn. Sad. napkin math, gives us range 1 220,000 worst case, 1 1.3 million best case. Still better risk catching Covid, 2 working vaccines makes sense pause J&amp;J vaccine investigate. Especially given clots related AstraZeneca vaccine fall similar demographics group. That's wrong amazing. Side effects happen whatever dose, hence list every side effect encountered even extremely rare. Well odds working dying really low compared odds retired dying. think likely would've +EV survival vaccinated spreads first, unequal death rate, think really close two options I'd need see studies confirm guess I'd advocate strongly either approach. Either way time, point moot I'm US. Everyone getting vax shortly.  statistically?

risk blood clots J&amp;J **0.000088%** (6 6.8 million, death 1, even less likely).

risk getting blood clots covid directly?

**16.5%** (165,000 blood clot cases every 1 million infected)

so math, it‚Äôs probably better take vaccine. like‚Ä¶ LOT I‚Äôm young (20) Astra Zeneca early country (UK, back March). day got it, news stories blood clots came out. terrified. couple weeks later announced stopping country 30s. bad fever flu/covid symptoms 24 hours fine. don‚Äôt really see fuss about, taking pill gives risk getting blood clots vaccine, women that. ü§î cases jumping much US?

Cases jumping much US.

Case counts basically flat US places big jumps.

7 day rolling average US Mar 15th 55,860. Yesterday, 72,262. That's increase 16,400. Michigan alone accounts 5600 increase. Fine. happens get home quarantine. You‚Äôre alright, Europe. We‚Äôll give miss year. J&amp;J sounds like backing out. also I‚Äôm curious affective. age range, common health concerns get affected, side affects treatable.  
  
I guess sad part mass vaccinations. really time studied. *letting* die. allowing free individuals make decision themselves. long accurately informed risks, government say it. want literally slit throat, state moral right *forbid* so. it, ~~Jedi~~ Moderna man.  cvst, rare type stroke, one died, likely others still got brain damage  taking issue article's implication people already vaccinated (or soon vaccinated) need boosters coming Fall/Winter

Seems like general American rhetoric swung ""believe science"" ""things need get back normal"" opposition party power people getting vaccinated. Pretty soon America's interest virus fade away become ""somewhere else problem."" 

Its endemic going kill hundreds millions people next decades. Yet thing people seem care consuming media issue narrative tailored facilitate reopening bars/restaurants, schools, offices fast possible. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* you, I‚Äôd wait little longer official announcement this, think it‚Äôs pretty unlikely Disney keep mask mandates still August majority country abandoned 2-3 months point 

You absolutely person planning around this, $$$ incentive Disney get many people possible come...who hell wants wear mask theme park humid, 90+ degree heat  Really ridiculous remove 'Business Insider' also political coverage, primarily business news outlet indicated name site. almost certaintity getting covid since can't expect keep social distancing mask wearing forever unless complete germaphobe. 1 100 chance dying, assuming risk factors. that's asking self ... must American thing.  know that, thanks. Certainly makes sense me. Remember already vaccinated young people (great) risk factors. misleading look entire age cohort. population awaits vaccination generally healthy. Dude vaccination rate stabilized. relative shortage (in words difference rates today compared earlier). However, absolute shortage (current vaccination rates, comparable US bsrely cover large population) Thanks! country block exports company whatever reason. 

Er ... give ownership blocks it, EU simply want operate way. could've. values.

Yeah, imagine doubts 'values' thing lines take morning. obvious? last impassioned response removed uncivil. Which, fair, felt strongly saying. Let try calmly.

I think asker's phrasing comes across fear-mongering someone defensive. get it, lot anti-vaxxers speak bad faith. However, think post read bad faith poster makes pattern rejecting pro-vaccine replies stirring arguments vaccine data. happened. poster began particular post ""Yay!"" reads someone showing positive feelings toward vaccine news moving simple question.

I believe fair expect everyone hedge vaccine-related questions ""I'm anti-vaxxer BUT"" questions respected. think fair wise shame people expressing concerns. ""Fear-mongering""? asker *is* afraid? People allowed search answers explanations points concern. situation, another two vaccines *have* found cause blood clots. Someone know difference vaccines work versus mRNA vaccines reason wonder sure happen Moderna Pfizer. 

Heck, nobody asked Johnson Johnson's AstraZeneca's vaccines cause blood clots, answer either.

Good, true science able face questions. people looking answers, whether due fear not, questions respected. shamed asking questions, told part problem asking questions, whether religion, political leader, drug getting injected arm, I'd probably anti-vaxxer myself. Clearly member Volt gang 30 yr old. got mine Texas. underlying health issues. agree good reason halt entire population. ""The number adults hospitalized Michigan COVID-19 reached 3,918 Monday, surpassing reported peak fall surge virus highlighting state's troubling stopped people dying it‚Äôs blood clotting side effects. That‚Äôs science.  know I'm talking population density although factor 6 months like really short lol.

Yeah, feels like experience job would onboarding team learning projects. Honestly, feel ""100% capacity masks"" going de-facto ""mask recommendation"". can't see things fully open yet people masking percentage right now. yet everyone okay contraception. Ok so, pretty much given US never approve AstraZeneca, anyone predictions decide do? mexican I'm desperate them. Thank you! figured won‚Äôt really know July so, guess wait out. Thank you!! I'll take two, please thank you. people catching unlikely hospitalized die seems like really big deal.

This aged poorly.

""The number adults hospitalized Michigan COVID-19 reached 3,918 Monday, surpassing reported peak fall surge virus highlighting state's troubling Could conservative schedule offered Disney CEO something parks catering predominately children? produce sell? There's incredibly huge demand. can't speak Disney particular county likely drop masks June put pressure Disney same. went 1 theme park mask last month miserable - absolutely worth Florida heat. Huh? thought completely safe!? gives?  small events like ""Forgot mask home/in car, well, I'll go unmasked, one say anything, they'll assume I'm vaccinated.""

Now makes sense. Terrible opinion. vaccine isn‚Äôt dangerous people fine able take others aren‚Äôt willing  Agreed spoken logically. cannot tout false promises sure. like said enough extended data reached hope soon."
